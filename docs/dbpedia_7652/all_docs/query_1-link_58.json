        "text": "Back for season 14 starting Friday January 7th, meet the new lineup of queens and guest judges. Learn everything you need to know about RuPaul’s Drag Race, entertainment's number 1 drag show for the series premiere episode.\n\nWhat Is RuPaul’s Drag Race?\n\nThis Emmy award-winning series, airing on VH1, is the fiercest competition on television. Each week drag queens participate in fabulous performance and fashion-based competitions. Challenges in episodes may range from acting to makeovers to “reading,” one of the series’ most popular recurring challenges that involve cast members satirically criticizing each other. The two contestants who fail to outshine the others must battle it out in an over-the-top lip sync performance only a queen worth staying in the competition can deliver. The queen whose talent scores her first place will win the $100,000 grand prize, a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics and more importantly, the title of America's Next Drag Queen Superstar.\n\nSpin-offs of RuPaul's Drag Race\n\nFor a deeper dive into the drag queens’ lives on the show we are gifted with RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked! where contestants let it all hang out. Extra fierce behind-the-scenes clips, drama and secrets too juicy for the primetime slot are aired on VH1 in 30-minute segments following each new episode of the main series.\n\nTo date, RuPaul’s Drag Race has spawned three spinoffs in the U.S. - RuPaul’s Drag U, RuPaul’s Drag Race All-Stars, and Dancing Queen - as well as numerous international versions in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Spain and Chile.\n\nThe Judges of RuPaul's Drag Race\n\nRuPaul Andre Charles, known simply as RuPaul, is the main judge and host. He is an American drag queen, actor, model, singer, television personality, and author. Along with him on the judges' panel is Michelle Visage, a radio DJ, singer, actress, producer, media personality, and television host who has been the longtime co-host of The RuPaul Show. Carson Lee Kressley, best known for his style guidance on the series Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and How to Look Good Naked, sits at the table with his expertise as a television personality, actor, and designer. Joining them is TV Personality, author and celebrity news correspondent Ross Mathews.\n\nSeason 14 also includes a star-studded list of guest judges—Alec Mapa, Lizzo, Alicia Keys, Christine Chiu, Dulcé Sloan, Loni Love, Taraji P Henson, Andra Day, Dove Cameron, Ava Max, Nicole Byer and TS Madison. They will all appear throughout the season to lend their celebrity input and advice on the queen contestants’ performances. Along for the race are also famous faces who will drop in and lend their expertise from Jennifer Lopez, Leslie Jordan, and Sarah McLachlan to the president of Anastasia Beverly Hills, Norvina.\n\nMeet the RuPaul's Drag Race Season 14 Cast\n\nThis season has 14 contestants all battling it out in a candy-themed competition with their fiercest and sweetest drag. Each brings a unique drag style that will proudly represent the culture. Let’s meet the queens and America’s next future Drag Queen Superstar.\n\nIntroducing Alyssa Hunter\n\nThis Puerto Rican queen was born for this, telling VH1, “I think I was doing drag in my mama’s belly.” Pulling from inspiration from drag queen Alyssa Edwards and Miss Continental 2000 Danielle Hunter, this queen is a combination of delicate, strong and sexy. A double threat in modeling and acting, she is prepared to runway-walk all over the competition. Declaring, “I’m gonna be the first Puerto Rican queen to take that crown home,” Hunter is representing, ready for whatever RuPaul has up his skirt.\n\nIG: @thealyssahunter\n\nQueen Angeria Paris VanMicheals\n\n“I was born for the crown. I put on crowns like I put on drawls.” Miss Angie has already declared herself the winner. Hailing from Atlanta, this country queen is known for her makeup artistry, painting faces better than Picasso. She believes she has this in the diamond-studded bag because she has the charisma, the uniqueness, the nerves, the talent, but most importantly the heart. As “a pageant girl to the core,” she is ready for this competition from the inside and out. Ready to entertain for days.\n\nIG: @angeriavm\n\nPresenting Bosco\n\nThe name comes from her childhood puppy and it fits as she is ready to dog the competition. Her “drag is equal parts evil and naked,” a diabolical combination that might just win her the crown. She is here to bring slut to drag, embracing body, skin and all its goodness. With years of dancing under her corset, she is sure to bring a twist to this drag race. Bosco reminds us that “they say ‘crack is wack’ but have you seen this ass.” So all you haters know where to kiss… the crown.\n\nIG: @hereisbosco\n\nWelcoming Daya Betty\n\n“I stink really bad. I don’t ever wash my tight.” This is a royal confession, a bit of a shocker but Daya Betty wants to invigorate all your senses. Luckily our television is no smell-o-vision. Her name is a spin on diabetes as this queen is diabetic and embracing every part of her. Going by Betty when she’s feeling extra sexy and Diahrrea when not so much. You might know her drag sister Crystal Methyd, who was a former contestant on Season 12 of the show, and Daya Betty is trying to bring the crown home for the family. She describes herself as “a human mood ring” dabbling in the playful side of life but loving the grundy parts too. This down-to-earth queen is ready to get her acrylic nails dirty.\n\nIG: @dayabetty\n\nDrag Queen Deja Skye\n\nShe is a crafty queen with the ability to create spectacular costumes that are sure to be show stoppers. Her name is the combined inspiration of Beyonce’s song “Deja Vu” and Skye’s childhood puppet crush Skye Nakaiye from the series Puzzle Place. An in between of campy and funny drag, she can do it all, comedy, singing, and dancing. She “never wants to be put in a box” so this queen is sure to defy expectation and bring a uniqueness you’ll want to tune in for. As cliche as it sounds, she is here to be the best her, and the $100,000 grand prize would just be icing on the cake.\n\nIG: @dejaskye\n\nRuPaul's Contestant Jasmine Kennedie\n\nThis queen Jasmine is sure to outdo her Disney princess namesake. Her last name pulls from Jackie Kennedy, matching the former first lady in style and class. A self-proclaimed housewife by day and drag queen at night, Kennedie is a showgirl big on pageantry. This larger-than-life fashionista matches the big city she represents, New York City, baby. She says, “the second I could perform in front of my family and have a high heel on” she was all for it. With a touch of old school and new school, Jasmine Kennedie brings a twist on tradition that no other contestant dares to. This triple threat will dance, act and sing her way to the finale.\n\nIG: @jasminekennedie\n\nIntroducing Queen-Jorgeous\n\nThis queen is of course gorgeous and that is partly where her name comes from, along with her birth name Jorge. Her drag revolves around dance, dazzling us with flips and dips. Her “Tex-Mex, hella chunti, hella bad bitch” drag style will add Southern flair to her moves and grooves. We have the movie To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar and John Leguizamo’s character Chi-Chi Rodriguez to appreciate for encouraging Jorgeous to enter the drag world. From her painted lips she’s declared, “There has never been a short Latina winner and it’s my turn now.”\n\nIG: @jorgeous_1\n\nSay Hello to Contestant June Jambalaya\n\nIn a playful alliteration on her birth month and last thing she ate, June Jambalaya was born. Describing herself as “the real housewife of drag,” she is sure to be the star of this season. Drag has allowed her to bring her love of fashion, hair and dance together to create new art. She will bring more fashionable outfits, more glamourous hairdos and the best choreography to this upcoming season. June Jambalaya, who likes “to wear nice clothes and do ratchet things,” is the real definition of ghetto fabulous. Hopefully, RuPaul likes.\n\nIG: @junejambalaya\n\nMeet Queen Kerri Colby\n\nKerri Colby is here to show us how to be “that bitch.” Hailing from the city of Los Angeles, she is all human hair wigs and decked-out ensembles. The Colby stems from the legendary haute couture fashion brand House of Colby while the famous Kardashian family gave Kerri inspiration for a K-name. Although she likes high art and high fashion she is not just a pretty face. She’s eloquent, articulate, and has a big heart. Colby says, “I actually care so much more about others than I tend to care about myself.” Many take her big heart as ingenuine and quickly label her fake, but this multitalented queen won’t let that stop her. RuPaul is a big inspiration for Miss Colby, so she is not here to fumble the crown. As she puts it, “The crown’s already mine baby, I just came to wear it better.”\n\nIG: @kerricolby\n\nSeason 14's Kornbread “The Snack” Jeté\n\nOh baby, does this queen have a killer story about where her name came from. Binging on the prison docuseries we all love to watch before bed, this queen was drawn to one woman who shot her cheating husband while having cornbread for dinner. In fear, no one would eat cornbread with this lady in prison, and now no one is going to mess with Miss Kornbread either. She is LA all day, thanking the LA drag community for helping her reach royal success. This queen is giving “100% authenticity.” She is here to win by all means necessary, especially to take home that money honey. Miss Kornbread is prepared to “shake a titty for the paper” and be our delicious queen.\n\nIG: @kornbreadthesnack\n\nHello Queen Lady Camden\n\nThe royalty is already in her name. This queen reigns from Camden Town in London, bringing “British grit” to one-up the competition. Some days she is “regal refined from the ballet world” and sometimes “just trash from Camden.” You never know what you might get with this Missus, making it all that much better. A self-proclaimed Spice Girl, “Garbage Spice,” she is a “trained ballerina meets 90s pop princess.” Her British flare and American sass may just be the right combination to win her the crown. Monarchy is in her blood, so watch out competing queens.\n\nIG: @ladycamden\n\nSeason 14 Contestant Maddy Morphosis\n\nHer name is a play on metamorphosis, which to this queen is “the epitome of what drag is.” And of course Season 14 is coming in hot with a few firsts. Miss Maddy is the very first cis-gendered heterosexual drag queen to appear on the show. She is here to bring a uniqueness to RuPaul’s Drag Race that the show has never seen before, encouraging other straight men to embrace their femininity and simply be you. She is ready to tear down on stage, not interested in pageantry drag but more campy. This queen takes pop culture and things outside of drag and makes them drag. So let’s see if this queen has the wig, waist and wit to win.\n\nIG: @maddymorphosis\n\nRuPaul's Queen Orion Story\n\nThis queen is out in the open, not afraid to show off her rhinestone panties. Being a mama’s girl and pothead is where she got the inspiration for her name, using her mom’s maiden name Story. She is the first Michigan girl on the show ready to represent her state. Her style is “vintage sixties kind of like Maude, a lot of Barbarella“ so she is bringing the classy classics to drag and only making it grander. She is not here to play letting everyone know “I don’t entertain conflict. I end conflict.” Oh yes, this queen is here to win, end of story.\n\nIG: @theorionstory\n\nQueen Willow Pill\n\nWillow comes from Buffy the Vampire Slayer because who doesn’t love a lesbian witch? And the Pill is very fitting as this queen has an array of medications to start her day. Although she faces a few medical issues, this queen takes that darkness and throws it into her drag to make it “fun and weird and scary.” A mix of “adorable and a little psychedelic,” there is no telling what Miss Willow Pill will hit the runway with. Yvie Oddly is a big inspiration for her. You fans of the show might know her as the Season 11 winner and Miss Willow is determined “to keep the crown in the family.” Will the glorious pink lightning strike twice?\n\nIG: @willowpillqueen\n\nWhere to Watch RuPaul's Drag Race Season 14?\n\nYou can watch RuPaul's Drag Race on VH1.
