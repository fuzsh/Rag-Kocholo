        "text": "I AM the sort of person who has left fancy business dinners early because it was 99-cent Big Mac day. When nobody is looking, I will switch off NPR and sing along to the Backstreet Boys. In my lifetime, I've probably seen ''Beastmaster'' more times than I've seen all the Merchant-Ivory films put together.\n\nBut, with the exception of some bouts with unemployment after college, I'd never spent much time watching daytime soap operas. There just didn't seem to be any fun in a genre that had been parodied to death yet never seemed to get the joke. Then, one afternoon at work, I wandered into the lunchroom and happened to glance at the television.\n\nOn the screen, I saw a teenage girl surrounded by the flames of hell and jitterbugging demons. And that wasn't the weird part. No, that was the fact that this Hades was inside her bedroom closet. Oh, and nearby stood a cackling witch and a boy doll, which the witch had turned into a little person.\n\nActually, there were two witches. The other one had arrived in town recently and tricked the teenage girl's cousin into selling her mortal soul, which was liquid and fit into a tiny bottle that the second witch carried around like a necklace to taunt the soulless girl. But then a young angel who looked suspiciously like the second coming of Shirley Temple suddenly appeared . . .\n\nIt was as if David Lynch had taken over ''All My Children.'' And since that first encounter, I've come to consider ''Passions'' the ''Twin Peaks'' of daytime. It's a staggeringly psychotic blend of supernatural thriller, melodramatic soap opera and situation comedy, featuring acting that would make a pro wrestler blush. I'm never quite sure whether this is a ''laughing at'' or a ''laughing with'' kind of show; either way, I'm still laughing.\n\nI can't get enough of moments like the ''Psycho'' parody, which culminated in the witch Tabitha and her living doll disguising themselves as a nun and a rabbi to elude an axe-wielding lesbian who chased them through an airport. (Tabitha is played by Juliet Mills, whose glee in portraying this villainess must surely be a reaction to the time she spent as a sickeningly sweet, spellcasting nanny 30 years ago on ''Nanny and the Professor.'')\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
