While sleeping she levitates to the window and floats down to the little girl, who warns her of the evil around them. Meanwhile, Tabitha tells the doll she's sewing that \"it's beginning\" and then tries to eavesdrop on Grace and the little girl. After catching Theresa fantasizing about Ethan, Luis reveals he once dreamed of going to college. Despite their moment of closeness, the underlying tension between them about the Cranes does not go away. A worried Ethan calls Gwen, who is at the hospital, for an update on Sheridan. He tells his parents, Ivy and Julian, about the accident but Julian is only worried about how this will affect the family image. Ethan is annoyed at his father's cold attitude.

Luis asserts that his father's been gone for ten years-he either abandoned them or he's dead. Pilar refuses to believe him. Ivy denies Ethan's suggestion that she seemed unusually interested in Julian's conversation with Sam Bennett, but it is clear that the mention of Sam's name greatly affected her. When Ethan leaves, she takes out a locket and listens to a song that obviously holds great meaning for her. Julian walks in and the two bitterly argue over Ethan's priorities. When Julian walks away, Ivy fingers a revolver. What does she have in store for her husband? Theresa confides in her mother that she dreams Ethan will show up at their door, just as, unbeknownst to her, he arrives to update Pilar on Sheridan's condition.

At the police station, Sam and Luis discuss their distrust of the Cranes. Sam goes on the internet to try to find information about Grace's past.

Meanwhile, Tabitha dresses up as a fortune teller at the carnival and Theresa and Whitney enter her booth. Faith sees Sam's message on the internet that he's looking for information on a woman named Grace who was rescued from a fire twenty years ago. She replies under the name \"Seeker.\" After Sam coaxes \"Seeker\" for more information, Grace gets scared and turns off the computer-it could be one of \"them.\" Later, she's about to sign on again when the room gets cold and she sees the doorknob turning.\n\nWednesday, July 14, 1999 | Episode #8\n\nFaith's door opens and it's her sixteen year old daughter, Charity. She asks her mother why they're always moving from town to town. Charity wishes she could go to school and have friends like normal kids. Faith reveals she has a sister named Grace-Charity's aunt. Charity tries to persuade her mom to go public with her search for her sister, but Faith mysteriously says she can't. Finally, Charity convinces her to go to the carnival in Harmony.

Rosie tells Timmy he doesn't like him; Timmy responds by kicking her and saying he doesn't like her either. Terrified, Rosie kicks him off the pier into the water but Timmy manages to escape. After Sheridan accepts his proposal, Jean Luc tells the carriage driver to hurry-he has another surprise for Sheridan. Mimi calls after them, trying to stop them, but Jean Luc ignores her.

Tabitha shocks TC by recounting information about his past that TC has never told anyone-that TC resented his father for working at the country club until he realized he did it for TC and his mother. Tabitha also says TC's father died young because of the events surrounding TC's leg injury. TC agrees with Tabitha when she says he would kill whoever caused the injury. He demands to know who's responsible but Tabitha says he'll find out in due time. A shaken TC leaves. Meanwhile, Whitney tells Eve that TC went to find the fortune teller.

Of course, Miguel will win and she will be the mystery date. Jessica overhears Kay's plan. Luis agrees to be in the contest, not knowing what it's about. With Gwen's encouragement, Ethan also agrees to be in the contest.\n\nFriday, July 16, 1999 | Episode #10\n\nOn the phone, Jean Luc tries to end his association with Roger, his contact in the drug business, but Roger tells him that's not the way it works. The waiter approaches Sheridan with Mimi's message. The door is locked to the terrace, so the waiter directs Sheridan to another door. Just when Sheridan moves off, Jean Luc approaches Mimi and angrily tells her to leave. Sheridan calls out but Jean Luc covers Mimi's mouth and locks her in a storage closet. Jean Luc leads Sheridan back into the restaurant and tells her he's going to take her to his country house. Jean Luc stops at his apartment, where Roger and a thug are waiting for him.
