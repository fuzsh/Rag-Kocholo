        "text": "Mystery of Chad Harris: Fate Delivers Us, Chapter Twenty-Four\n\n\" Grandmere, what are you doing here?\", Simone asked, going into her arms for a hug.\n\nMadelaine never took her eyes off of Charity.  She has the gift, Madelaine thought.  I can feel it from here. \n\n\" Well, cant a grandmother visit her family?\"\n\n\" Youve never visited us, Grandmere.\", Simone says curious.\n\n\" Well, I missed you so much from the last time you visited, plus Piccola went to visit her family in the Delta, that I thought I would come and visit you.\"\n\nJust then, Chad, Whitney, Ethan, Theresa and Gwen come into the living room.\n\n\" Grandmere? Is that you?\", Whitney asks.\n\n\" Yes, its me, Child. Get over here.\"\n\nWhitney goes to hug her grandmother. \" Is something wrong? Why are you here?\"\n\n\" Your sister asked the same thing. I just decided to visit my family. Well, hello, Chad.\", Madelaine says, opening her arms to him.\n\n\" Hello, Mrs. Russell.\"\n\n\" So, Whitney, Simone, arent you going to introduce me to all your friends?\"\n\nSimone took the introductions. \" This is Jessica and Kay Bennett.\"\n\n\" Sam and Graces girls.\"\n\n\" This is Charity Standish, Jessica and Kays cousin.\"\n\n\" From Graces side of the family.\"\n\n\" Yes, I am, Mrs. Russell, but, why would you say that?\", Charity asks curiously.\n\n Because I can feel the gift in you as I did in Grace., Madelaine thought.\n\n\" Because, I remember Theodore telling me about you when you first arrived.\", Madelaine said to Charity.\n\n\" This is Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and his sister, Theresa.\"\n\n\" Pilar and Martins children.\"\n\n\" You knew our father?\", Theresa asked.\n\n\" Indeed I did. Fine man.\"\n\n\" And, this is Ethan Crane and Gwendolyn Hotchkiss, his fiance.\"\n\n\" A Crane, in THIS house? How is this possible?\", Madelaine asks with curiousity. \" Does your father know about this, Whitney?\"\n\nWhitney felt her grandmothers intense eyes boring into her. \" Of course, Grandmother. He knew that Ethan was coming over.\"\n\n\" Well, I guess things HAVE changed in Harmony since I was last here.\"\n\n\" Mrs. Russell, I dont know what youre heard about the Cranes, but I doubt it was from first hand experiences.\", Ethan said, extending his hand.\n\nNOT taking his hand, \" I never had to HEAR anything about the Cranes. Anything that I know about them, I KNOW about them. \"\n\n\" Well, I doubt this is going to be settled this evening. Grandmere, you must be exhausted. Would you like to go upstairs and freshen up?\", Whitney said, motioning towards Simone.\n\n\" Grandmere, Whitney is right. Well take you upstairs to the guest bedroom. Chad, you want to help with the luggage?\"\n\nSimone didnt need to say anything. Chad, Miguel, and Kay (to be close to Miguel), had picked up the bags.\n\nMadelaine smiled at Ethan, but, spoke to Simone. \" Youre right, Simone Darling, I do need to freshen up. It was nice meeting you all.\"\n\nMadelaine left the room, and Gwen shivered.\n\n\" That was intense. She DEFINITELY does not like the Cranes. Her eyes \"\n\n\" They look through your like you were glass.\", Ethan says. \" Theresa, does she come often?\"\n\n\" Actually, no. Ive known Whitney ever since we were in pre-school together, and I cant remember once her grandmother coming to visit Harmony.\"\n\n\" I cant either.\", Jessica says, \" though, my parents have been to New Orleans several times. We even went as a family twice, and stayed at her house. It is so beautiful. A Mansion. Nothing nothing like the Crane Mansion, but, to regular people, the only way to describe it would be a Mansion.\"\n\n\" Charity, you seem a little quiet.\", Theresa says. \" Anything wrong?\"\n\n\" Nothing wrong. Just a feeling Im getting.\"\n\n\" What?\", Jessica asks.\n\n\" Something bad is going to happen to the Russells.\"\n\nEveryone looked at Charity with curious eyes.\n\nKay, Simone and Whitney were emptying the luggages and placing things in the drawers and closets according to Madelaines instructions. Chad and Miguel were rearranging the furniture to Madelaines instructions.\n\n\" Simone, where are your parents?\"\n\n\" They went out for a nice night at the Sea Scape, Grandmere. You know the Sea Scape.\"\n\n\" The people who bought my restaurant.\"\n\n\" Yes. Its pretty formal.\"\n\n\" Well, Ill take a quick shower, and then youll call me a cab. Ill join your parents.\"\n\n\" At the Sea Scape?\", Whitney asked.\n\n\" Of course, Darling, unless theres a reason you think that your parents wouldnt want me there?\"\n\nWhitney wasnt going to touch that with a ten foot pole. \" No, Grandmere, Im sure theyll be glad to see you. \"\n\n\" Well, thank you for all your help, but, I think I can handle things from here. Call me a cab, Whitney. Have it delivered here in thirty minutes.\"\n\n\" Yes, Grandmere.\", Whitney says, closing the door on her way out.\n\n\" Whitney, do you think Mom and Daddy want Grandmere there on a romantic night out?\"\n\n\" Of course not, Simone. But, there are two choices: her with them, or her downstairs with us. Which will it be?\"\n\n\" Ill call for the cab. \"\n\nAs they began the salad course, Eve dropped her napkin. TC leaned over to get it, and saw Ivys action with Sam underneath the table. TC tapped Eve, and she leaned under the table to see what TC had just seen. When they both came back up, Eve glared at Ivy, and spoke up,\n\n\" So, Grace, why dont you tell Ivy and Julian about the plans for your second wedding?\"\n\nThe food fell off of Ivys fork when she heard Eves question. \" Second wedding?\"\n\n\" Yes. Sam and I are going to renew our vows. Our first wedding, though nice and sweet, well, we were young, and didnt have a lot of money, and so, it was pretty simple. I thought this time, wed renew our vows in the church, and have a REAL reception, here at the Sea Scape!\", Grace says with a smile.\n\n\" Sounds lovely. Instead of wedding cake, are you going to be serving your famous Tomato Soup Cake?\", Julian snarled, gulping his martini.\n\n\" No, Julian.\", Grace laughs. \" But, if youre missing it, Ill make sure to deliver one to the house this week.\"\n\n\" Oh Goody.\", Julian chimes back, the sarcasm going straight over Graces head.\n\n\" Eve is going to be my Matron of Honor; the girls are going to be bridesmaids, and TC is the best man, with Noah, Hank and Luis groosmen.\"\n\n\" It sounds absolutely romantic, doesnt it, Ivy?\", TC glares. \" Such a statement for Grace and SAM to make about their love and life together. A life filled with joy, love, family, and everything that one dreams about. Isnt that right, Sammy?\"\n\n\" Absolutely, TC. I cant believe how lucky I was to find a woman like Grace. A woman full of love and honesty. A woman who would stand by me, and never desert me. A woman that has shown me what it REALLY is to be loved. A woman \"\n\n\" Well, hello everyone.\"\n\nThe table turned to look at the newest arrival.\n\n\" Mama?\"\n\n\" Mother Russell?\"\n\n\" Miz Madelaine?\"\n\nMadelaine goes over to TC and gives him a kiss on the cheek. \" Yes, its me, Theodore. \"\n\n\" What are you doing here? How did you get here?\"\n\nMadelaine looks dead at Julian, \" My, my legs are tired, I do wish I had a seat.\"\n\nJulian got up and handed Madelaine his seat. \" Mrs. Russell.\"\n\nMadelaine didnt acknowledge Julian, and sat down in the seat. \" Well, to answer your questions: Piccola went to visit family in the Delta, and I came to visit you. When I got to your house, your daughters informed me where you were, so I came onto the restaurant. My my doesnt everyone look handsome tonight?\"\n\n\" Thank you, Miz Madelaine.\", Grace says.\n\n\" Well, I know my son and daughter-in-law, and the Bennetts, who are you?\", Madelaine says, looking at Ivy.\n\n\" Im Ivy Crane.\"\n\n\" Of course you are. Nice to see you again, JULIAN.\"\n\nJulian gives her a nervous smile. \" We meet again, Mrs. Russell. Its been awhile.\"\n\n\" I doubt its been long enough. Those who say that things never change, havent been to Harmony lately. I arrive here, and see you having dinner with Julian Crane, Theodore how curious. Of course, maybe I shouldnt have been so surprised, considering that I found a Crane in YOUR home. Ethan, I believe his name is \"\n\n\" Thats my son.\", Ivy volunteers.\n\n\" How nice for you.\"\n\n\" The dinner was my idea, Miz Madelaine.\", Grace chimes in.\n\n\" Of course, Grace. It would have to be.\", Madelaine says, glaring at Julian, who downs his new martini in one gulp.\n\n\" Well, Miz \" Ivy stops herself as Madelaine stares at her. \" Mrs. Russell, what brings you to Harmony?\"\n\n\" Only to check up on my family. To make sure that everythings in order. Is that ok?\", Madelaine says, turning to TC.\n\nTC kisses his mothers cheek. \" Of course it is, Mama. Ive very happy that youre here. Isnt that right, Eve?\"\n\nIvy noticed Eve tensing up and putting on a killer smile. \" Of course. Were so happy to have you, Mother Russell.\"\n\nJulian has waived down the waiter, and ordered himself another martini, and Madelaine places her order for dinner.\n\nThe phone rang, and Inez Ford fumbled for it in the dark.\n\n\" Yeah?\"\n\n\" Inez, sweetie, its me, George.\"\n\n\" You back home?\"\n\n\" No. On a case in Seattle. Checked my voicemail. You have something for me?\"\n\n\" I sure do.\"\n\n\" Which case?\"\n\n\" The case of the kid from Harmony..whathisname, Chip?\"\n\n\" Chad.\"\n\n\" Yeah, that one.\"\n\n\" Spill it!\"\n\n\" Nope. Itll keep until you get back.\"\n\n\" Am I going to kiss you?\"\n\n\" Honey, Ive decided. I get your box at Camden Yards for 3 months.\"\n\n\" Hot damn. If its THAT good, you can have it for the season.\", George says laughing.\n\n\" See ya later, George. I need my beauty sleep.\"\n\n\" Nite.\""
