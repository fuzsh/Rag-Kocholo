        "text": "Kay is the middle Bennett child. She refuses to get along with her sister, teasing her constantly. She developed a crush on friend Miguel, and uses her best friend, Simone, and his best friend, Reese, to try to get closer to him. His growing relationship with Charity is a threat to her, so Kay has been doing everything to get rid of Charity, knowing she is her cousin. When Simone suggested that Charity's long-lost aunt might be her mother's sister, Kay did everything she could to make sure that the two never met -- her crush on Miguel proved more important to her than her mother's happiness.\n\nAlthough she pretended to support Charity and Miguel, in reality, she was trying to keep them apart. After the incident in the mineshaft, Kay became more determined than ever to get Miguel...and sold her soul to Hecuba in order to get him. She helped Hecuba arrange for the demons of Hell to get their hands on Charity, but there's one problem...the demons had their hands on Kay, too!\n\nKay has her soul back but she is still up to no good. With the help of a book of spells she has frozen Charity and hid her in a cave. While replacing her with a \"Zombie\" Charity whom is doing her evil bidding."
