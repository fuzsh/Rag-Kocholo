        "text": "HarmonyFile:Harmony, New England.jpg\n\nAn aerial view of Harmony (as seen in the Passions closing credits)\n\nPassions locationCreated byJames E. ReillyGenreSoap operaTypeCity\n\nHarmony, New England is a fictional town that is featured on the American television soap opera Passions, which aired on NBC (1999–2007) and later on DirecTV (2007–08). The series followed the romantic and supernatural adventures of the town's residents.\n\nA coastal New England town founded in 1646 with a small population, Harmony features a large fishing industry. The shots of the town shown on screen are filmed in the real town of Camden, Maine.\n\nLocation[edit]\n\nThroughout the show's run, Harmony has only ever been identified as being in New England, which is traditionally made up of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island; and on the Atlantic coast, thus eliminating the land-locked Vermont. Though early episodes implied that Harmony is in Maine, this was never established. Characters also frequently take trips to Boston, which is implied to be a manageable distance away.\n\nIn 2002 and 2007, Theresa Crane and Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald, respectively, are sentenced to death by the state; only New Hampshire and Connecticut still allow capital punishment. However, during Luis and Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald's double trial, the jury foreman declares their case names as The Commonwealth v. Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and The Commonwealth v. Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald,[1] and, of the four US states that are also US commonwealths, the only commonwealth in New England is Massachusetts.\n\nCastleton is a fictional town near Harmony where Faith and Charity Standish briefly live in 1999; it is noted to be a thirty-minute drive away from Harmony.[2]\n\nNearby locations[edit]\n\nCastleton - a neighboring town, and formerly the home to Faith and Charity Standish\n\nDansville - nearby town\n\nBridgeton - nearby town\n\nRichville - nearby town and the location of Norma and Edna's asylum\n\nAimville - nearby town\n\nNorth 22 and North 137 are highways near Harmony.\n\nDemographics[edit]\n\nHarmony is home to the affluent Crane family, which has long thrived on the rest of Harmony's citizens' wealth. The majority of Harmony's families, such as the Bennett family and the Russell family, appear to be middle class, though some families, like the Lopez-Fitzgerald family, are decidedly poorer.\n\nCrime, in recent years, seems to have dramatically risen. Beginning in December 2006 and lasting through August 2007, Harmony was terrorized by a mysterious masked person known primarily as the Blackmailer; he was later revealed to be Vincent Clarkson. As the Blackmailer, Vincent was seemingly untraceable, caught only after he revealed his identity to his mother, Eve Russell. Vincent murdered Rae Thomas, Simone Russell's girlfriend, and Dylan Flood, a bartender at the Blue Note; he also raped half-sister Fancy Crane twice and set fire to Dylan's apartment. Aside from Vincent, Alistair Crane is widely known to have murdered his son, Chad Harris-Crane, raped ex-wife Katherine Crane and last wife Theresa Crane, and kidnapped his grandson, Marty Lopez-Fitzgerald, until his murder in May 2008.\n\nAll of the characters featured on the program are Roman Catholic. Though most of Harmony is primarily Caucasian, there is a significant Latino and African American population.\n\nAdministration[edit]\n\nThe chief executive of Harmony is Mayor Anawalt,[3] who frequently allows himself to be influenced by Alistair Crane and his family members for personal gain. Anawalt, as Harmony's mayor, holds a significant amount of power over the Harmony Police Department and its chief, Sam Bennett, and Bennett's subordinates, including Detective Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald, Officer Fancy Crane, Officer Hank Bennett and Officer Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald. Though Anawalt is on the Cranes' payroll, along with several officers, Chief Bennett and the Lopez-Fitzgeralds all spurn such bribery, and Officer Crane is not involved in her grandfather's and father's dealings.\n\nHarmony also has a court system, and its most prominent judge is JE Reilly, who delivers verdicts according to the will of the highest bidder.\n\nInstitutions[edit]\n\nCrane Industries is a global corporation, it is the main employer of the town of Harmony and is headed by Theresa Crane. Divisions include fisheries, music production, and fashion design. Besides Alistair Crane, Theresa Crane, Julian Crane, Sheridan Crane, Valerie Davis, and Ethan Winthrop are all employed by Crane Industries, and Chad Harris-Crane, Fancy Crane, Fox Crane, Sheridan Crane, Kay Bennett, and Jared Casey were at one time employed there.\n\nHarmony Hospital is the main hospital in Harmony. Eve Russell is the most prominent physician there.\n\nThe Crane Cannery, owned by the Crane family, deals with the canning of fish products. Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald worked there briefly in 1999, Kay Bennett has been employed there since 2004, and Julian Crane was believed to have been murdered there in 2002.\n\nDaily Private Lives is a tabloid magazine based in Harmony that revealed Ethan Winthrop's true paternity in 2001. Vincent Clarkson was a reporter there before his supposed death; JT Cornell was the editor before his death in 2006.\n\nThe Book Café is a café owned by the Crane family; Beth Wallace had owned and run it for many years herself before financial difficulties forced her to sell it to the Cranes.\n\nThe Blue Note is a jazz club built by Julian Crane and formerly managed by Liz Sanbourne. Noah Bennett is a bartender there.\n\nThe Bennett Bed & Breakfast is owned by Sam Bennett and was run and co-owned by Grace Bennett before she moved to Italy in 2004.
