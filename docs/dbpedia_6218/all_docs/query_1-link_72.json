        "text": "Rainfall from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to end by noon Friday.\n\nThe heaviest rain from Debby have shifted into Virginia around 4 p.m. Thursday as the storm continues to move northward, according to the National Weather Service in Raleigh.\n\nHowever, meteorologists predict that central North Carolina, including the Triad, will continue to experience intermittent scattered rainfall through the night and into the late morning Friday.\n\n“Even though that steady band of rain that dumped two to four inches of rain last night will be moving up into Virginia in the early afternoon, we’re still going to be dealing with one wave after another of these scattered downpours and scattered dusty showers,” Nick Petro, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said during the weather briefing on Thursday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“It’s just going to be off and on rain with heavy downpours at times and gusty winds at times, right through this evening.”\n\nAnd while it’s challenging to pinpoint exactly which area will experience the heaviest rainfall, Petro said, the Triad is expected to see significant rain around 9 p.m. Thursday.\n\nThe Triad experienced notable power outages, with Duke Energy reporting that 10,500 customers in Forsyth County, 7,336 customers in Guilford County, and 1,325 customers in Davidson County were without power at the height of the storm on Thursday morning. Strong winds are expected to diminish as the storm moves out of the state.\n\nChaewon Chung covers climate change and the environment in the Triad and Northwest North Carolina.
