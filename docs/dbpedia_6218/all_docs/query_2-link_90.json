        "text": "Many more countries have become democracies over the last two hundred years. The chart shows — based on data from Regimes of the World (RoW) — that a much larger share of countries are now democracies.\n\nIn the late 18th century, no country could be meaningfully characterized as a democracy. RoW classifies almost all of them as closed autocracies, in which citizens do not have the right to choose their political leaders through elections.1\n\nElections spread throughout the 19th century, but they were often marred by limitations. Many countries became electoral autocracies, in which political leaders were chosen through elections, but citizens lacked additional freedoms to make those elections free and fair. Only a few countries held elections that were sufficiently meaningful to call them electoral democracies.2 And even fewer had the additional individual and minority rights and the constrained governments to consider them liberal democracies.3\n\nElectoral and liberal democracy then spread to many countries in the 20th century. By the end of the century, they had become common political systems around the globe and could be found across all world regions.\n\nToday, the world is about evenly split between autocracies and democracies, according to this data. Most non-democracies are electoral autocracies. And more than a third of all democracies have the additional individual and minority rights that characterize liberal democracies.\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nIn this chart, we identify the political systems of countries with the Regimes of the World data by political scientists Anna Lührmann, Marcus Tannenberg, and Staffan Lindberg4, published by the Varieties of Democracy project.5\n\nRoW distinguishes four types of political systems: closed autocracies, electoral autocracies, electoral democracies, and liberal democracies.\n\nClosed autocracy: citizens do not have the right to choose either the chief executive of the government or the legislature through multi-party elections\n\nElectoral autocracy: citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature through multi-party elections; but they lack some freedoms, such as the freedoms of association or expression that make the elections meaningful, free, and fair\n\nElectoral democracy: citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature in meaningful, free and fair, and multi-party elections\n\nLiberal democracy: electoral democracy and citizens enjoy individual and minority rights, are equal before the law, and the actions of the executive are constrained by the legislative and the courts\n\nWe use the RoW classification and V-Dem data but expand the years and countries covered and refine the coding rules, as explained in our technical article on the RoW data.\n\nWe use the RoW data here, but there are several other leading approaches to measuring democracy, which sometimes classify countries differently. You can explore them in our Democracy Data Explorer.\n\nBillions of people have gained democratic rights over the last two centuries. The chart shows that many more people now live in democracies, based on the Regimes of the World (RoW) data.\n\nIn the 19th century, few people had democratic political rights. In 1789, almost everyone lived in political systems that RoW classifies as closed autocracies. No country was a democracy, and only 22 million people lived in the two countries classified as electoral autocracies: the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nSince then, many have gained democratic political rights, especially in the second half of the 20th century. By 2023, about 1.3 billion people lived in electoral democracies in all regions of the world: many live in the populous countries of Indonesia, Brazil, and South Africa. Another billion people lived in liberal democracies, such as those living in Chile, South Korea, and the United States.\n\nWhile democratic rights have spread far, they are still far from universal. Because the world’s population grew faster than democracy spread, the total number of people without democratic rights is higher than ever. Almost all of them reside in just one country: China.\n\nThere have also been recent setbacks, with many people losing political rights. Most prominently the 1.4 billion people living in India, which — according to the RoW data — became an electoral autocracy in 2017. Other data sources agree that India has become less democratic, but overall still consider India a democracy.6\n\nWe have an article that discusses the trends in more detail:\n\n200 years ago, everyone lacked democratic rights. Now, billions of people have them\n\nHalf of all countries are democracies. But how many people enjoy democratic rights?\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nTo see what share of the world’s population lived in each regime, you can tick the ‘Relative’ box in the interactive visualization.\n\nFor data on countries’ populations, we rely on combined data from Gapminder, the History database of the Global Environment (HYDE), and the United Nations Population Division.\n\nIn this chart, we identify the political systems of countries with the Regimes of the World data by political scientists Anna Lührmann, Marcus Tannenberg, and Staffan Lindberg4, published by the Varieties of Democracy project.5\n\nRoW distinguishes four types of political systems: closed autocracies, electoral autocracies, electoral democracies, and liberal democracies.\n\nClosed autocracy: citizens do not have the right to choose either the chief executive of the government or the legislature through multi-party elections\n\nElectoral autocracy: citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature through multi-party elections; but they lack some freedoms, such as the freedoms of association or expression that make the elections meaningful, free, and fair\n\nElectoral democracy: citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature in meaningful, free and fair, and multi-party elections\n\nLiberal democracy: electoral democracy and citizens enjoy individual and minority rights, are equal before the law, and the actions of the executive are constrained by the legislative and the courts\n\nWe use the RoW classification and V-Dem data but expand the years and countries covered and refine the coding rules, as explained in our technical article on the RoW data.\n\nWe use the RoW data here, but there are several other leading approaches to measuring democracy, which sometimes classify countries differently. You can explore them in our Democracy Data Explorer.\n\nDemocracy is young in most countries that are democratic today. The chart shows that most electoral democracies are younger than their more senior citizens, according to the Regimes of the World data.\n\nBased on the data, many democracies are less than a generation old. Some are younger than 18 — not older than the children in these countries — and others are only as old as the country’s young adults. In these democracies, most young people have experienced authoritarian rule, and older people have lacked democratic political rights for most of their lives.\n\nA larger group of countries have been electoral democracies for one to three generations. In them, children and young adults have only known life in a democracy. But their parents and grandparents have still experienced non-democratic rule.\n\nOnly a few countries have been democratic for a long time and have been electoral democracies for three generations or more. Democracy there is older than almost all of their citizens.\n\nBecause electoral democracy is defined as political rights being broad, but not necessarily universal, not everyone has enjoyed democratic political rights even in these countries. For example, governments in some countries have forbidden parts of the population, such as women, to vote and stand in elections.\n\nLiberal democracy, in which citizens enjoy additional individual and minority rights, is an even rarer and more recent achievement than electoral democracy. And democracy is a recent achievement regardless of the measure used.\n\nWe have an article that provides more detail:\n\nIn most countries, democracy is a recent achievement. Dictatorship is far from a distant memory\n\nHow old are democracies across the world?\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nIn this chart, we identify the political systems of countries with the Regimes of the World data by political scientists Anna Lührmann, Marcus Tannenberg, and Staffan Lindberg4, published by the Varieties of Democracy project.5\n\nRoW distinguishes four types of political systems: closed autocracies, electoral autocracies, electoral democracies, and liberal democracies.\n\nClosed autocracy: citizens do not have the right to choose either the chief executive of the government or the legislature through multi-party elections\n\nElectoral autocracy: citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature through multi-party elections; but they lack some freedoms, such as the freedoms of association or expression that make the elections meaningful, free, and fair\n\nElectoral democracy: citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature in meaningful, free and fair, and multi-party elections\n\nLiberal democracy: electoral democracy and citizens enjoy individual and minority rights, are equal before the law, and the actions of the executive are constrained by the legislative and the courts\n\nWe use the RoW classification and V-Dem data but expand the years and countries covered and refine the coding rules, as explained in our technical article on the RoW data.\n\nWe use the RoW data here, but there are several other leading approaches to measuring democracy, which sometimes classify countries differently. You can explore them in our Democracy Data Explorer.\n\nThere are large differences in the degree to which citizens enjoy political rights — between democracies and non-democracies, but also within each group. The chart — relying on the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) data — shows that some countries are much more democratic than others.\n\nWhile almost all countries are much more democratic than they were 100 years ago, there are still large differences between them.\n\nSome countries — mostly located in Europe and the Americas — are highly democratic: they have elected political leaders, elections are broadly free and fair, and most citizens have the right to vote.\n\nOthers, especially in Asia, are highly undemocratic. Based on V-Dem, this includes countries such as China, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia. There, citizens do not have the right to choose their political leaders in popular elections.\n\nMost countries, often in Africa and Asia, fall somewhere in the middle. Political leaders are elected and citizens have the right to vote there, but their rights to associate and express their opinions are limited, and elections are not entirely free and fair.\n\nThe chart looks at electoral democratic institutions. Looking at liberal democracy or data from other leading approaches shows similar differences.\n\nWe have an article that provides more detail and discusses the trends over time:\n\nPeople around the world have gained democratic rights, but some have many more rights than others\n\nHow democratic have countries been across the world? And how big are the differences between them?\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nIn this chart, we rely on the Electoral Democracy Index by the Varieties of Democracy project5to measure democracy.\n\nThe Electoral Democracy Index scores each country on a spectrum, with some countries being more democratic than others. Political systems with the following features are considered more democratic:\n\nElected political leaders: broad elections choose the chief executive and legislature\n\nComprehensive voting rights: all adult citizens have the legal right to vote in national elections\n\nFree and fair elections: no election violence, government intimidation, fraud, large irregularities, and vote-buying\n\nFreedom of association: parties and civil society organizations can form and operate freely\n\nFreedom of expression: people can voice their views and the media can present different political perspectives\n\nWe expand the years and countries covered by the V-Dem data as explained in our article on the data.\n\nWe use the V-Dem data here, but there are several other leading approaches to measuring democracy, which sometimes score countries very differently. You can explore them in our Democracy Data Explorer.\n\nThe world has become less democratic in recent years. The chart shows that more countries have been autocratizing recently, based on the Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT) data.\n\nThe number of countries that are autocratizing has been increasing: for 2023, ERT identifies 42 that were autocratizing — close to an all-time high.\n\nFor a long time, the number of autocratizing countries was offset by democratizing ones. But since 2013, the number of countries that are becoming more autocratic has been higher.\n\nThe countries that are becoming less democratic are both eroding democracies and hardening autocracies.\n\nOther approaches to measuring democracy also suggest that the world has recently become less democratic — the number of democracies has declined; fewer people are living in democracies, countries and people have on average fewer democratic rights, and more people live in autocratizing countries.\n\nThe world was at its democratic ‘all-time high’ in the early 2010s. But since then it has fallen, and now looks more like the 2000s, the 1990s, or even the late 1980s, depending on which democracy measure we rely on.\n\nWe have seen similar democratic declines before, and past declines were reversed. People fought previous phases of autocratization in the 1930s and 1960/70s, turned the tide, and pushed democratic rights to unprecedented heights. We can do it again.\n\nWe have an article that provides more detail:\n\nThe world has recently become less democratic\n\nMany more people have democratic rights than in the past. Some of this progress has recently been reversed.\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nFor data on which countries are becoming less or more democratic, we rely on data from the Episodes of Regime Transformation project.7\n\nWe use their data to identify which countries are autocratizing, democratizing, and which countries are not clearly moving in either direction.8\n\nERT seeks to strike a balance between large and small changes in how democratic countries are.9 It captures smaller changes in the level of democracy that fall short of regime change. At the same time, it only codes a country as autocratizing when there is a substantial decrease in its democracy score. This is because very small decreases may be fleeting and not indicate broader shifts towards less democracy, or overstate changes altogether because the measurement is uncertain.10 ERT also allows for temporary stagnation because autocratization may not happen abruptly in one year, but slowly over several years.11\n\nWe use the ERT data here, but there are several other leading approaches to measuring democracy, which sometimes classify or score countries differently. You can explore them in our Democracy Data Explorer."
