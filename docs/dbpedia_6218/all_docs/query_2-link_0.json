The election was held during the Fourth Party System. Republicans retained control of the presidency and both houses of Congress, while third parties suffered defeats.\n\nIn a re-match of the 1896 presidential election, Republican President William McKinley defeated Democratic former Representative William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska.[3] McKinley's previous running mate, Vice President Garret Hobart, had died in office, so the Republicans nominated New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt as their vice presidential candidate. McKinley again won by a comfortable margin in both the popular vote and the electoral college, and he picked up a handful of states in the West and the Midwest. McKinley's win made him the first sitting president to win re-election since Ulysses S. Grant in 1872.\n\nRepublicans won minor gains in the House, maintaining their majority.[4]\n\nIn the Senate, the Democrats made moderate gains while the Populist Party lost three seats. Republicans continued to maintain a commanding majority in the chamber.[5]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\n1900 United States presidential election\n\n1900 United States House of Representatives elections\n\n1900–01 United States Senate elections\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nBailey, John W.
