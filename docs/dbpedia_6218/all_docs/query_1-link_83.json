        "text": "Seneca Nation of Indians businessman J. Conrad Seneca on Thursday stood under a pole tent erected in front his travel plaza business in Irving to announce his candidacy for president of the Seneca Nation of Indians.\n\nA current member of the Seneca Nation Council, Seneca – owner of Tallchief Territory — Home of Native Pride – said he is running to provide leadership to help unify the Nation.\n\nJoined by his wife, Nicole, and family members and supporters, he outlined a number of issues he said are critical to the Nation, including settling its unresolved Class III gaming compact with the State of New York.\n\n“I think the governor and the next (Seneca) president, if it is myself, need to sit down at the table and work these things out,” he said in regards to the stalled negotiations.\n\nThough he doubted that an agreement is likely before the Seneca Nation elects a new government administration in November, he said he is hopeful a new administration will bring some new energy and vision to the talks.\n\n“I think inserting some new energy, some new vision, some new personality, I think can help the situation and push it forward,” said Seneca, who is also a member of the Seneca Party.\n\nThe most important aspect of the new agreement, he said, is making sure that it expresses the will of the Seneca people.\n\nThe gaming compact between the Seneca Nation of Indians and New York State, which was set to expire at the end of next week, has been extended through March, according to Gov. Kathy Hochul's Office.\n\nThe tribe operates three casinos and has more 5,600 employees. Seneca on Thursday also expressed the view that the state has no right to share in the revenues that the Nation garners from gaming.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“According to the Indian Gaming regulatory Act, no state has the right or authority to receive revenue unless the Indian Nation that’s gaming receives just compensation for it,” Seneca said. “In that sense, if we’re not getting what we believe is value from the state, then they don’t get anything.”\n\nRobert Odawi Porter, who served as Seneca Nation president from 2010 to 2012, announced his support of Seneca for president.\n\n“My experience with J.C. goes back to those days in the early 1990s when I was the 28-year-old duly minted attorney general and within a few months of that time period, we got thrust into what I call a war with New York State over their efforts to impose taxation on our nation and to violate our treaty rights as a nation. And I didn’t know J.C. Seneca really at all, but in the fog of that conflict, in the fog of that war, J.C. stood out through the telephone in my years as a leader of our people at a time of great crisis,” Odawi Porter said.\n\nSeneca also addressed other critical issues he said are facing the Nation, including alcohol and drug addiction.\n\n“We have a continually growing drug and alcohol problem within our territories and our people. We need to find ways to help those that want help, to provide the assistance and, perhaps, even a facility that accommodate the treatment of those in need to fight addiction,” Seneca said.\n\nIn a video posted last week, Rickey Armstrong Sr. said that earlier this summer, the Nation and Hochul administration had only a “percentage point” difference in their positions on the revenue sharing rate, but that the state’s offer had gotten “significantly” worse since then.\n\nSeneca said he was unaware if others had announced their candidacy for Seneca Nation president but anticipates others will make their announcements in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThe Seneca Party Caucus to nominate all candidates is set for Sept. 20 at Seneca Fire on Route 438 on the Seneca Nation Cattaraugus territory and at Seneca Fire on the Allegany territory in Salamanca.\n\nThere are 30 elected offices in the Seneca Nation of Indians.\n\nThe current president of the Seneca Nation is Rickey Armstrong Sr.\n\nSeneca, a U.S. Air Force veteran, has been elected and/or appointed to a number of local and national Native American governments and organizations. He was first elected to the Seneca Nation Council in 1990.\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nHarold McNeil\n\nStaff Reporter\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
