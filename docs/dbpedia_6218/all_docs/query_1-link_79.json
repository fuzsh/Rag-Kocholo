        "text": "Tropical Storm Debby was expected to whisk winds and big water to areas of drought-parched Southwest Virginia overnight Thursday into Friday.\n\nAfter some rain Wednesday into Thursday night, the Debby downpour started about midday Thursday and was expected to continue into Friday, said Christopher Grover, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Blacksburg.\n\n“In the Roanoke area we can see areas of 4-6 inches of rain, especially more in localized areas with heavier showers,” Grover said. “Winds are expected to be around 25-45 miles per hour, gusts particularly.”\n\nEmergency management staff were on standby across the region, including swift water rescue teams and a joint urban search and rescue task force comprised of personnel from Salem, Roanoke and Roanoke County Fire-EMS squads.\n\nWater levels in the Roanoke River were forecast to reach a minor flood stage, estimated at close to 12 feet high within city limits by Friday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. An earlier forecast had called for the river to rise to 14 feet.\n\nWith flash flood warnings active through Thursday night and a flood watch in effect until Saturday, authorities reminded motorists and pedestrians not to attempt passing through waterways overrun by water.\n\n“Turn around, don’t drown,” Grover said.\n\nIn recent days, the final stages of work on the Mountain Valley Pipeline were paused so construction crews could devote all of their time to storm preparation, the company said Thursday.\n\nSome portions of the project’s path through Southwest Virginia still consist of bare earth, making them more vulnerable to erosion.\n\nStorm preparation work “involves routine maintenance on the right-of-way and installation of enhanced erosion control devices, including in steep slope areas and certain active construction areas,” company spokesman Shawn Day wrote in an email.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlthough the natural gas pipeline went into operation June 14, Mountain Valley is still working on final restoration, which entails stabilizing the ground over the buried pipe, planting grass and vegetation to limit erosion, and restoring the right-of-way to its original condition.\n\nThrough July 19, final restoration was ongoing along about 80,000 linear feet of the route through Giles, Montgomery, Roanoke and Franklin counties, according to a construction status report filed this week with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\nMuddy runoff has long been a problem for Mountain Valley, and opponents say heavy rain on steep slopes could cause a landslide and rupture the pipe, which is transporting gas at high pressure.\n\n“The MVP project team continues to work with state and federal regulators to ensure the protection of sensitive resources and remains focused on the safe, responsible operation of the project and final restoration of the right-of-way,” Day said.\n\nIn Roanoke, city offices closed two hours early, at 3 p.m. Thursday.\n\nRoanoke’s public works division preemptively placed street closure barricades at 12 flood-prone locations across the city, and doubled its on-call staff, a city spokesperson said. Parking was restricted Thursday morning on Salem Avenue between First and Second streets, a flood-prone part of downtown.\n\nAs of 4 p.m. Thursday, there were 6,500 customers without electricity in the Appalachian Power coverage area, including more than 1,000 around Vinton, and another 600 near Cave Spring, according to an online map.\n\n“We’re watching the path of Debby and we put all of our crews on alert to be prepared if there are outages, but it’s a large area to cover,” said Appalachian Power spokesman George Porter. “We haven’t started to move resources into any other areas just yet. We have everyone in their specific locations on standby.”\n\nThe electric utility lowered the water level at Claytor Lake on Wednesday by about one foot ahead of the storm, he said. Smith Mountain Lake’s level was not lowered.\n\nThe Roanoke and New River valleys remained in a state of moderate drought as of midweek, according to the National Drought Mitigation Center. Grover with the NWS expected the drought to cease after this heavy downpour generated by Debby.\n\nStaff writer Julianna Stephenson contributed to this report.\n\nLuke Weir (540) 566-8917\n\nluke.weir@roanoke.com\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nLuke Weir\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
