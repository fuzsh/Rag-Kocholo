        "text": "History of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives\n\nIn 1682, William Penn arrived in Pennsylvania from England and in November\n\nof that year ordered an election to take place for an Assembly to meet at\n\nChester. The first Pennsylvania Assembly met in Upland, Chester County on\n\nDecember 4 through December 7, 1682. Complete membership in the\n\n1682 Assembly is not known. Presumably each county elected seven\n\nrepresentatives - Bucks, Chester, Philadelphia, and the lower\n\nthree counties of New Castle, Kent, and Sussex, which later\n\nbecame the state of Delaware. The identity of the first\n\nSpeaker is also unknown.\n\nIn 1790, Pennsylvania's second Constitutional Convention was held resulting in the creation of the State Senate, making the General Assembly a bicameral legislature. Since 1790, Pennsylvania held other Constitutional Conventions in 1838, 1874, and 1968. Additionally, fifty-six more counties were created, totaling sixty-seven. The current number of Representatives is 203, and in 1968 the representation system changed from county-based to district-based (population).\n\nAdditional Links\n\nPennsylvania Capitol Preservation Committee\n\nThe Pennsylvania Capitol (Tours and Welcome Center)\n\nThe State Museum of Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania State Archives\n\nLibrary of the Senate of Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania Constitution\n\nHistory of the Pennsylvania Judicial System"
