        "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Election Commission is releasing 54 more Administrative Fines cases with $94,027 in civil money penalties, bringing to 823 the number of cases made public with $1,118,286 in fines collected. In addition, there are numerous cases in various stages of the Administrative Fines process. Closed Administrative Fines case files are available in the FEC’s Press and Public Records offices.\n\nThe Administrative Fine Program, authorized by Congress in 1999 in response to a legislative recommendation made by the FEC (see News Release May 31, 2000), has a twofold purpose: to free critical Commission resources for more important and complex enforcement efforts, and to reduce the number of financial reports filed late or not at all. The Administrative Fines Program encompasses a range of civil money penalties set high enough to discourage committees from considering them an acceptable ‘cost of doing business’, but not so high as to be exorbitant.\n\nCivil money penalties will be determined by the number of days late, the amount of financial activity involved, and any prior penalties for reporting violations. Election sensitive reports (reports and notices filed prior to an election) will receive higher penalties.\n\nPARTY COMMITTEES 1. AF 960 RESPONDENTS: 15th District Democratic Party, Patricia A.
