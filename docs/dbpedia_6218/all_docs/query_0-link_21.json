        "text": "Prior to 1938, voter registration was handled by the city clerks and, in unincorporated areas, by the County Auditor. It was not until the election reforms of the early 1930s that the oversight of voter list management transferred to the County Auditor. Prior to that, each city clerk managed their own list and did not publish voter registration numbers. No precinct could have more than 250 registered voters and in a state with 898,159 (1938) registered voters that meant 3,593 precincts. There was no singular tracking of overall voter registration numbers until the mid 1930s.\n\nElection Date Description Total Counties Total Precincts Eligible Registered Voters Total Ballots Counted Turnout 11/7/2023 General Election 39 8,078 4,829,084 1,758,084 36.41% 8/1/2023 Primary 36 6,474 3,865,926 1,116,963 28.89% 4/25/2023 April Special Election 19 3,189 1,671,514 530,405 31.73% 2/14/2023 February Special Election 29 2,543 1,370,164 451,969 32.99% 11/8/2022 General Election 39 8,021 4,806,852 3,067,686 63.82% 8/2/2022 Primary 39 8,018 4,803,741 1,941,933 40.43% 4/26/2022 April Special Election 19 1,106 763,829 240,236 31.45% 2/8/2022 February Special Election 38 5,348 3,080,390 966,966 31.39% 11/2/2021 General Election 39 7,722 4,814,675 1,896,481 39.38% 8/3/2021 Primary 37 6,774 4,355,213 1,294,522 29.72% 4/27/2021 April Special Election 19 576 326,147 111,739 34.26% 2/9/2021 February Special Election 27 973 760,234 300,066 39.47% 11/3/2020 General Election 39 7,436 4,892,871 4,116,894 84.14% 8/4/2020 Primary 39 7,435 4,612,018 2,510,881 54.44% 4/28/2020 April Special Election 10 140 52,179 25,031 47.97% 3/10/2020 Presidential Primary 39 7,399 4,553,013 2,256,488 49.56% 2/11/2020 February Special Election 39 3,573 2,107,506 754,603 35.81% 11/5/2019 General Election 39 7,361 4,503,871 2,035,401 45.19% 8/6/2019 Primary 35 6,421 3,967,681 1,173,009 29.56% 4/23/2019 April Special Election 16 902 546,595 164,099 30.02% 2/12/2019 February Special Election 33 2,680 1,614,219 531,768 32.94% 11/6/2018 General Election 39 7,269 4,362,459 3,133,462 71.83% 8/7/2018 Primary 39 7,126 4,299,309 1,753,545 40.79% 4/24/2018 April Special Election 24 1,390 834,458 263,045 31.52% 2/13/2018 February Special Election 37 4,850 2,761,020 896,507 32.47% 11/7/2017 General Election 39 7,310 4,265,433 1,582,481 37.10% 8/1/2017 Primary 36 6,351 3,781,977 1,017,946 26.92% 4/25/2017 April Special Election 15 568 388,199 125,027 32.21% 2/14/2017 February Special Election 35 1,445 815,106 314,039 38.53% 11/8/2016 General Election 39 7,165 4,270,270 3,363,440 78.76% 8/2/2016 Primary 39 7,147 4,102,624 1,431,058 34.88% 5/24/2016 Presidential Primary 39 7,142 4,088,029 1,421,841 34.78% 4/26/2016 April Special Election 22 3,489 989,862 323,691 32.70% 2/9/2016 February Special Election 34 5,370 2,227,833 741,857 33.30% 11/3/2015 General Election 39 7,237 3,974,947 1,528,272 38.45% 8/4/2015 Primary 34 5,917 3,356,735 817,876 24.37% 4/28/2015 April Special Election 20 3,363 1,720,133 480,586 27.94% 2/10/2015 February Special Election 35 1,408 771,690 314,606 40.77% 11/4/2014 General Election 39 7,068 3,922,248 2,124,330 54.16% 8/5/2014 Primary 39 6,978 3,925,663 1,222,710 31.15% 4/22/2014 April Special Election 21 3,159 1,589,634 586,032 36.87% 2/11/2014 February Special Election 37 3,190 2,245,127 744,899 33.18% 11/5/2013 General Election 39 7,014 3,914,786 1,772,290 45.27% 8/6/2013 Primary 36 3,505 3,221,285 837,098 25.99% 4/23/2013 April Special Election 21 478 272,986 107,132 39.24% 2/12/2013 February Special Election 31 1,118 760,369 305,806 40.22% 11/6/2012 General Election 39 6,975 3,904,959 3,172,939 81.25% 8/7/2012 Primary 39 6,978 3,731,657 1,435,928 38.48% 4/17/2012 April Special Election 21 647 476,048 189,110 39.72% 2/14/2012 February Special Election 39 2,324 1,394,035 586,487 42.07% 11/8/2011 General Election 39 6,792 3,658,413 1,936,950 52.95% 8/16/2011 Primary 35 5,123 2,776,149 819,991 29.54% 5/17/2011 May Special Election 6 96 67,614 32,616 48.24% 4/26/2011 April Special Election 16 281 126,081 59,936 47.54% 2/8/2011 February Special Election 28 967 674,769 290,286 43.02% 11/2/2010 General Election 39 6,777 3,601,268 2,565,589 71.24% 8/17/2010 Primary 39 6,778 3,592,079 1,471,791 40.97% 5/18/2010 May Special Election 1 27 11,389 6,605 57.99% 4/27/2010 April Special Election 15 828 538,920 213,163 39.55% 2/9/2010 February Special Election 35 2,379 1,615,185 646,608 40.03% 11/3/2009 General Election 39 6,767 3,583,278 1,823,364 50.89% 8/18/2009 Primary 32 4,785 2,334,067 724,598 31.04% 5/19/2009 May Special Election 9 276 100,586 47,472 47.20% 4/28/2009 April Special Election 2 31 4,124 2,284 55.38% 3/10/2009 March Special Election 18 557 353,088 163,045 46.18% 2/3/2009 February Special Election 21 740 391,851 161,131 41.12% 11/4/2008 General Election 39 6,671 3,630,118 3,071,587 84.61% 8/19/2008 Primary 39 6,674 3,417,355 1,455,756 42.60% 5/20/2008 May Special Election 11 523 354,659 154,001 43.42% 4/22/2008 April Special Election 6 56 27,211 12,413 45.62% 3/11/2008 March Special Election 12 409 278,200 109,937 39.52% 2/19/2008 February Special Election 39 6,685 3,311,503 1,386,701 41.88% 11/6/2007 General Election 39 6,691 3,288,642 1,645,652 50.04% 8/21/2007 2007 Primary -
