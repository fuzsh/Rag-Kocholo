        "text": "The State Duma in the Russian Empire\n\nThe first representative body of legislative power was created in the Russian Empire in 1905 as result of the revolution. On 6 August 1905, Emperor Nicholas II issued a Manifesto on Establishment and Organisational Rules of one of the parliament chambers – the State Duma. The State Council of the Russian Empire became the second chamber. The Duma should have exercised only quasi-legislative function. However, on 17 October 1905, the Emperor signed a new Manifesto establishing that no law could enter into force without an approval of the State Duma.\n\nThus the State Duma was transformed from an advisory body to a legislative organ. Overall four Dumas gathered till 1917. The Duma consisted of landowners, representatives of the industrial middle class, merchants, city intellectuals, and peasants. A total number of elected delegates of the Duma varied from 478 to 525 in different years.\n\nThe First State Duma of the Russian Empire\n\nThe term of work – 27 April – 8 July 1906\n\nThe Chairman: Muromtsev S.A. (Constitutional Democratic Party)\n\nThe opening of the first session took place on 27 April 1906 in Tauride Palace in Saint-Petersburg.\n\nThe elections to the First Duma were conducted in accordance with a law of December 1905. Six curia were established: landowners, city habitats, peasants, workers, Cossacks, and non-Slavic people. There was no universal (women, young people under 25, military people, some nationalities could not vote), equal (landowners’ curia: one elector from 2 000 persons with a right to vote, city habitants curia – from 4 000, peasants curia – from 30 000, workers curia – from 90 000) and direct voting.\n\nThe First State Duma was restricted in its powers and authority. In accordance with the Code of Main State Laws, approved by Nicholas II on 23 April 1906, the Emperor took decisions regarding ministers’ appointment, Russian foreign policy, and declaration of a state of emergency. The Code also provided that the Emperor was entitled to issue new laws on his own behalf.\n\nThe main issue discussed by the First State Duma was land. The Duma also attempted actively but unsuccessfully to conduct political reforms and called to stop repressions of participants of the Revolution (1905–1907). Overall the delegates approved only one law initiated by the Government. This law assigned 15 million rubles to people affected by crop failure.\n\nThe First Duma was dissolved by Nicholas II. It is known as “the Duma of people’s anger”.\n\nThe Second State Duma of the Russian Empire\n\nThe term of work – 20 February – 3 June 1907\n\nThe Chairman: Golovin F.A. (Constitutional Democratic Party)\n\nOne of the main tasks of the Second Duma was a resolution of procedural issues as the delegates were intended to expand the authority of the representative body.\n\nThe main focus of their attention was an agrarian question and they paid less attention to governmental drafts, counter-revolutionary repressions and measures to improve the financial position of lower classes of the Empire.\n\nThe Duma was dissolved in only 102 days after the beginning of its term. 55 delegates were accused in a plot against Emperor’s family. Some members of social democratic faction were said to have connections with “a military organization of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party” that was planning armed uprising on 3 June 1907 (the so-called the Coup of the June 3rd).\n\nNew Regulations on elections were published together with the Manifesto on the dissolution of the Duma.\n\nThe Third State Duma of the Russian Empire\n\nThe term of work – 1 November 1907 – 3 July 1912\n\nThe Chairman: Khomyakov N.A. (1907–1910, Union of 17 October), Guchkov A.I. (1910–1911, Union of 17 October), Rodzyanko M.V. (1911–1912, Union of 17 October).\n\nThe Third Duma was the only one of four State Dumas in the Russian Empire that worked the full statutory five-year term.\n\nElections were held in accordance with new Regulations on elections of 3 June 1907. The new Regulations restricted election rights of peasants and workers and decreased the number of representatives of so-called national remote areas.\n\nThe delegates discussed a wide variety of questions: army reforms, peasants issue, in relation to “national remote areas”, etc. The draft should have been proposed by no less than 30 delegates to become a law. All legislative initiatives were revised by the Duma at three stages of the lawmaking process.\n\nAlmost 30 commissions were created to work on drafts. Some of them consisted of several dozens of people, e.g. a budget commission. Elections of commission members were held at a general session of the Duma with prior approval of candidates within factions. The majority of commissions included representatives of each Duma’s faction.\n\nThe drafts that were initiated by ministries, first of all, were revised by Duma’s Gathering that included the Duma Chairman, his comrades, the Duma Secretary, and his comrades (all these titles were set forth in documents on creation and organization of Duma’s work). The Duma’s Gathering issued a preliminary report on allocation of a draft to one of Duma’s commissions and after that, the report was approved by the Duma.\n\nRequest system was widespread. The delegates having gathered a certain number of signatures could ask a government to provide a report on its actions.\n\nThe Fourth State Duma of the Russian Empire\n\nThe term of work – 15 November 1912 – 6 October 1917\n\nThe Chairman: Rodzyanko M.V. (Union of 17 October).\n\nThe work of the Fourth Duma was defined by events inside Russia and on the international arena. After the beginning of the First World War and several large defeats of the Russian army, the serious political conflict appeared between the Duma and executive power. On 25 February 1917, Emperor Nicholas II signed a decree on the dissolution of the Duma till April 1917. However, the Duma continued to gather at private sessions.\n\nThe Duma was one of the centers of opposition to Emperor Nicholas II. On 27 February its members formed the Temporary Committee of the State Duma that by forming the Temporary Government de facto became the supreme authority in the country.\n\nAfter the monarchy ceased its existence in Russia the Duma never gathered in its full completion. However, the Temporary Committee of the State Duma had regular sessions.\n\nOn 6 October 1917, the State Duma was dissolved by the Temporary Government prior to elections to the Constitutional Assembly.\n\nThe legislative process in 1917–1991\n\nAfter the February revolution Soviets became a representative body. In accordance with adopted Constitutions of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and Soviet Union of Socialist Republics (USSR), legislative acts were reviewed and adopted by different bodies such as All-Russian Central Executive Committee, All-Russian and All-Union Soviets, Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR and USSR, Soviets of people’s delegates of USSR.\n\nAt the beginning an election system was very complex with a lot of stages, not all citizens could vote. However, in 1936, the Constitution established general, equal, direct elections. Moreover, delegates received parliamentary immunity.\n\nOn the last stage of the existence of the RSFSR, a position of the President of the Republic was established. He was a superior official and head of executive power. Soviets of people’s delegates and Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR lost a significant part of their competence. Later the President of the RSFSR ceased their existence by a decree.\n\nIn 1993 elections to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the first convocation were held.\n\nThe State Duma in modern Russia\n\nThe State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the first convocation\n\nThe term of work – 11 January 1994 – 15 January 1996\n\nThe Chairman: Rybkin I.P.

Moreover, civil society institutions were defined in legislation, e.g. the Public Chamber was established; legislation on non-profit and self-regulatory organizations was updated.\n\nTo improve a process of state-building, laws on the abolishment of elections of regions’ heads and on the introduction of a mixed system of regional elections in Russia were adopted.
