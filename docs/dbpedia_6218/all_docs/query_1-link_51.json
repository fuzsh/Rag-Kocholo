        "text": "(1) Some may regard Donald Trump's remarks on January 7, 2021 to be a \"concession\" because he acknowledged that a transition to a \"new administration\" would take place. The APP does not consider this to be a traditional \"concession\" as there is no acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the election, a pledge to work for the greater good of the country, and does not directly address President-elect Biden congratulations on his election victory.
