        "text": "The 1900 United States House of Representatives elections were held for the most part on November 6, 1900, with Oregon, Maine, and Vermont holding theirs early in either June or September. They coincided with the re-election of President William McKinley. Elections were held for 357 seats of the United States House of Representatives, representing 45 states, to serve in the 57th United States Congress. Special elections were also held throughout the year.\n\nMcKinley's Republican Party gained thirteen seats from the Democratic Party and minor parties, cementing their majority. A reassertion of Republican control in the Mid-Atlantic was key in the gain of new seats. However, with an improved economy, especially in the industrial sector, the election cycle featured no keystone issue, resulting in a general support for the status quo. The fading Populist Party held on to five House seats, while the sole member of the Silver Party changed parties to Democratic. This was the last time a third party headed into house elections with a party leader. All subsequent third parties to serve in the House would not select a party leader."
