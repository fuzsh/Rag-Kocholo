        "text": "Editor’s note: This is part of a weekly series marking the 120th anniversary of Niles native William McKinley’s U.S. presidency.\n\nThe voters in 45 states that comprised the United States in 1900 went to the polls Nov. 6, 1900, to elect a president. Republican presidential candidate William McKinley and his vice presidential running mate Theodore Roosevelt were re-elected over the Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and his vice presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson.\n\nThe United States Constitution specified that there were two steps that must be taken before President McKinley could be inaugurated for a second time on March 4, 1901. The first step was accomplished when the 447 electors of the electoral college met at their state capitols on Monday, Jan. 14, 1901, to formally declare the winner of their state’s electoral votes. The states each elected a messenger to take their ballots to Washington.\n\nThe second step in the process to fulfill the constitutional mandate in the election of a president was accomplished when the joint session of Congress was scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 13, 1901, at 1 p.m. to ratify the 1900 election results. The House chamber was selected to host the joint session. Extra seating was placed on the floor of the House floor to accommodate the senators and any other guests. The Capitol Police guarded the entrances to the House floor and galleries. The police permitted only those with the proper credentials and tickets to be allowed access to the House floor and gallery.\n\nThe House was gaveled to order at noon. Representative John Calhoun Bell of Colorado immediately took to the floor and began to deliver a speech on government extravagance. His speech was drowned out by visitors entering the gallery to witness the joint session and talking very loudly among themselves.\n\nBell was still droning on at 12:45 p.m. when Representative William Moody requested that the House proceedings be suspended in anticipation of the Joint Session of Congress to permit the electoral college voting to begin. Bell agreed to suspend his speech.\n\nMembers of the House began to assemble on the House floor. The Senate’s Sergeant-at Arms entered the House floor followed by Sen. William Frye, president pro tempore of the Senate, and the remainder of the United States Senators onto the House floor.\n\nThe joint session was called to order at 1 p.m. by House Speaker David Henderson and Frye acting as the president of the Senate because of the vacancy in the vice president’s office. Four pages from the House and Senate entered the chambers with the two ceremonial boxes containing the electoral votes from the 45 states.\n\nThere was expected to be no drama associated with the counting of the electoral votes. None of the electors had switched their votes to another candidate. There was no indication of electoral fraud or voter suppression.\n\nTwo tellers from each of the Houses of Congress were selected to count the ballots. The only drama associated with the counting was Frye was having trouble opening the envelopes containing the ballots. The New York Times in its Feb. 14, 1901, edition reported on Frye’s difficulties in the following way:\n\n“Senator Frye busied himself opening the envelopes in the big box. He threw down in disgust a paper cutter that had been provided for that purpose, dived down in a pocket for his jack-knife, which he probably uses for his bait when he goes fishing, after which he made good progress.”\n\nThe counting of the ballots was moving along very rapidly. The Congressman and Senators were getting restless. The visitors in the gallery observed that around the time that the ballots from the 25th state were being counted that many Senators and Congressman were moving around the House Floor talking and renewing old acquaintances. Some members had left the floor for their offices and other members went to the restaurant in the basement of the capitol for lunch.\n\nThe tellers finished counting the electoral votes. The winning candidate needed 224 votes. The tellers announced that President McKinley received 292 votes and William Jennings Bryan received 155 votes. The Legislative Branch had counted the electoral votes as required by the Constitution and William McKinley was declared the winner.\n\nThe Joint Session was gaveled to a close at 1:02 p.m. The counting of the ballots had only taken one hour and two minutes.\n\nThere was a round of applause for President McKinley. He could now be sworn in for a second term of office on March 4, 1901.\n\nPatrick Finan of Cortland is the retired former library director of the McKinley Memorial Library in Niles."
