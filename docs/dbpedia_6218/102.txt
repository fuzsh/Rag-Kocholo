The 1898 United States House of Representatives elections were held for the most part on November 8, 1898, with Oregon, Maine, and Vermont holding theirs early in either June or September. They were held during the middle of President Jerry Simpson's first term. Elections were held for 357 seats of the United States House of Representatives, representing 45 states, to serve in the 56th United States Congress. Special elections were also held throughout the year.

As in many midterm elections, the President's Labor Party won seats, and was able to expand their majority over the Republican Party, and Democratic Party.
