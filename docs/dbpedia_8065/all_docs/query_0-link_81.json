        "text": "In the post Dayton Bosnia and Herzegovina, a state in which the war ended in 1995, there still exist unsolved issues considering the complex traditional, religious and national structure. The same applies to the system of education Considering the changed social circumstances, new state organization and formation of government, even with all constitutional principles and legal regulations, it is very diffi cult to establish normal courses of social functioning. In that respect, education is struggling with systematization, especially due to different national, political, traditional and especially language interests of the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nevertheless, in spite of the diffi culties, some solutions in education were achieved. Each constitutional nation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has its own educational system which permeates into the others, complements others in an agreed reciprocity and correlation and in that way manages to establish a common but complex system of...\n\nEducation represents a fundamental pillar of Kosovo’s legal framework for the protection and promotion of the rights of communities including the right to receive public education in their own language. At current, there are two parallel education systems operating in Kosovo. One of them is run by the Government of Kosovo, more specifically the Ministry of Education, Science and Technologies (MEST), which provides education in Albanian, Turkish and Bosnian languages. The other is run by the Republic of Serbia and its Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development and provides education in the Serbian language. These two education systems in Kosovo do not recognize each other and there is no convergence between the systems at any level: they have been coexistingseparately since 1999. This study’s remit does not include the legal status of the parallel Serbian education system in Kosovo There is a remarkablelack of knowledge on the Serbian education system in Kosovo. No study thus far has mapped the exact outreach of Serbian-language schools in Kosovo or the conditions under which suchschools operate. In light of this, ECMI Kosovo’s missionis to outlinethe factual situation regardingthe current conditions of the Serbian education in Kosovo, and to map and assess its quality, challenges and shortcoming through measurable indicators inspired by EU educational standards. The goal is to address necessities by means of a detailed policy for the advancement of the education provided in the Serbianlanguage in Kosovo. The data collected isheterogeneous and revealssubstantial diversitybetween the four municipalities in the north of Kosovo and the Serb-majority areas scattered throughout the rest of Kosovo. It can be observed that schools in the four northern municipalities have better working conditions and equipment than the schools in the rest of Kosovo. The evaluation highlights serious concerns about infrastructural deficiencies and lack of space. In the south of the country schools are located in buildings not intended for this purpose. The biggest concerns are hygienic conditions and lack of indoor toilets, especially in the schools situated in the Gora region. The initiatives to assist Serbian-language schools in Kosovo have so far been fragmented and somewhat inconsistent. The northern municipalities benefit from proximity with Serbia and numerous opportunities for joint workshops, seminars and other initiatives. For this reason, ECMI Kosovo advocates for a coordinated action to support Serbian-language schools. Proper financial coordination among Kosovar authorities, the Serbian government and the international community would allow for an efficient use of both money and energy. This should be preceded by a political agreement between Belgrade and Pristina on this topic. A common plan should be drafted for long-term support and to create sustainable solutions.\n\nThe aim of the paper is to present research on language and identity of the youth in Slavonski Brod, the town on the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina, which, due to its geographical location, has been under a significant influence of the neighbouring Bosnian dialects. This is a town characterized by great immigration processes during 1990s, in the times of Croatian War for Independence and the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Throughout history, Bosnian Sava basin was inhabited mostly by Croats. After the occupation of this part of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Serbs during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s, Croats were forced to leave the area and they inhabited Slavonski Brod in great numbers. Today, twenty or so years after the occupation of Bosnian Sava basin, a great number of young people can be heard using elements of Bosnian lexicon as well as syntactic structures typical for the parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina where a considerable flow of refugees came from.
