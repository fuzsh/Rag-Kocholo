        "text": "3. The perpetrator confined one or more women forcibly made pregnant, with the intent of affecting the ethnic composition of any population or carrying out other grave violations of international law.\n\n3.1. The perpetrator confined one or more women.\n\nGeneral evidentiary comment\n\nForced pregnancy is a new crime under the Rome Statute, and resulted from one of the most controversial negotiations in Rome. (E. La Haye, Article 8(2)(b)(xxii)-4Forced Pregnancy, in R. Lee (ed.), The International Criminal Court: Elements of Crimes and Rules of Procedure and evidence: (2001), p. 193). Several delegations, including the Holy See and the United Arab Emirates, feared that policies not to provide abortion services might be interpreted as forced pregnancy under elements proposed by the United States and Swiss delegations. In the end, no compromise was reached and the elements of the crime reproduce verbatim the definition of forced pregnancy contained in article 7 (2) (f) of the Rome Statute. As a result, the structure of element 1 does not match other crimes in the Statute and does not correspond to the structure set out in paragraph 7 of the general introduction to the Elements of Crimes document.\n\nForced pregnancy was not included in the Statutes of the ICTY or ICTR, and has not yet been addressed in any international criminal judgments. Accordingly, many of the means of proof below have been formulated based on evidence adduced in other crimes with similar elements. Regarding the means of proving the confinement of one or more women, one commentator has noted:\n\nThe words unlawful confinement should be interpreted as any form of deprivation of physical liberty contrary to international law and standards.215 In contrast to paragraph 1(e) [of Article 7 of the Rome Statute, Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty], this definition does not require the deprivation of liberty to be severe. (M. Boot, (f) Forced Pregnancy, in O. Triffterer (ed.), Commentary on the Rome Statute (1999), article 7, margin No. 108).\n\n215. It has also been noted in the commentary on the definition of torture, regarding the concept of lawful sanctions, that [i]t is international law and not domestic law which ultimately determines whether a certain practice may be regarded as lawful, Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on torture, U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/1998/17, para. 42; see margin No. 104.\n\nThe means of proving confinement for forced pregnancy are therefore excerpted from the means of proof for unlawful confinement, article 8 (2) (a) (vii), which similarly does not require proof of severity. The means of proof may expand or narrow when the ICC judges interpret article 7 (1) (g)-4 in future cases.\n\n3.1.1. Evidence showing confinement of one or more women.\n\nP.1.

The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (1991) also points out that deprivation of liberty is referred to by different names, including, apprehension, incarceration, prison, reclusion, custody and remand, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Fact Sheet No 26, Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, p 4.

Dominic Ongwen, Decision on the confirmation of charges against Dominic Ongwen 23 March 2016\n\n, para. 111-112, 136-139:\n\n\"111. (P-101) testified on 9 and 10 November 2015 (ICC-02/04-01/15-T-13-CONF-ENG and -T-14-CONF-ENG). She testified that she had been in captivity with the LRA for eight years from her abduction in August 1996 by Dominic Ongwen and other LRA fighters until her escape in July 2004. The day she was abducted, Dominic Ongwen forced her to become his so-called \"wife\" and continued to have sex with her by force repeatedly until her escape. She was beaten when she refused to have sex with him, and at no time was she able to escape. As his so-called \"wife\", Dominic Ongwen also made her perform domestic duties for him, including cooking and fetching and chopping wood. As a result of rapes by Dominic Ongwen, (P-101) became pregnant three times. The second and third of her pregnancies fall within the Courts temporal jurisdiction, and for the duration of both these pregnancies she remained confined to Dominic Ongwens household without the possibility of escape.\n\n112. In light of the available evidence, the Chamber considers that there are substantial grounds to believe that Dominic Ongwen committed pursuant to article 25(3)(a) of the Statute against (P-101), between July 2002 and July 2004, the crime of other inhumane acts as a crime against humanity in the form of forced marriage pursuant to article 7(1)(k) of the Statute (charge 50); the crime of torture as a crime against humanity pursuant to article 7(1)(f) of the Statute (charge 51) and as a war crime pursuant to article 8(2)(c)(i) of the Statute (charge 52); the crime of rape as a crime against humanity pursuant to article 7(1)(g) of the Statute (charge 53) and as a war crime pursuant to article 8(2)(e)(iv) of the Statute (charge 54); the crime of sexual slavery as a crime against humanity pursuant to article 7(1)(g) of the Statute (charge 55) and as a war crime pursuant to article 8(2)(e)(vi) of the Statute (charge 56); the crime of enslavement as a crime against humanity pursuant to article 7(1)(c) of the Statute (charge 57); as well as the crime of forced pregnancy as a crime against humanity pursuant to article 7(1)(g) of the Statute (charge 58) and as a war crime pursuant to article 8(2)(e)(vi) of the Statute (charge 59) during her two pregnancies within the relevant time.\n\n136. Under charges 61 to 68 the Prosecutor alleges Dominic Ongwens criminal responsibility for the abduction of girls and women to serve as domestic servants, forced exclusive conjugal partners and sexual slaves in the Sinia brigade. The LRA practice of abduction of women for the purpose of turning them into forced so-called \"wives\" of LRA fighters, involving the systemic commission of a series of sexual and gender based crimes, is well established in the evidence before the Chamber. It should be added that, in line with the charges, the factual analysis of the Chamber is confined to this practice as it occurred within the Sinia brigade between 1 July 2002 and 31 December 2005. For its conclusions, the Chamber has reviewed the transcripts of the testimonies of Dominic Ongwens so-called \"wives\" (P-99, P-101, P-214, P-226, P-227, P-235 and P-236), who observed the relevant facts within the group in which they were confined, as well as the statements of numerous other witnesses who were also present in the Sinia brigade and able to observe this practice and the conduct of Dominic Ongwen in relation to it (P-142, P-199, P-202, P-205, P-233 and P-250). The Chamber has also taken note of the records of intercepted LRA radio communications for the dates of 1 April 2003, 2 April 2003, 10 March 2004, 4 August 2004, 26 June 2005 and 10 July 2005.\n\n137. This evidence demonstrates that there was a common plan between Joseph Kony and the senior leadership of the Sinia brigade, including Dominic Ongwen, to abduct women and girls in order for them to serve as forced \"wives\", domestic servants and sex slaves to male LRA fighters. Between 1 July 2002 and 31 December 2005, women and girls were systematically abducted in northern Uganda in line with this plan. They were distributed to LRA fighters as so-called \"wives\" with no choice on their part and were regularly raped by their so-called \"husbands\" for protracted periods of time. Also, their movement was confined and they were forced to perform various domestic duties. They lived under constant threat of death or severe physical punishment if they failed to respect the exclusivity of the socalled \"marriage\" imposed on them, if they did not submit to sexual intercourse, if they tried to escape, or if they failed to perform any other duty assigned to them. Indeed, they were regularly beaten as punishment, coercion or intimidation.\n\n138. The evidence is clear as to the fact that this conduct was ordered by Joseph Kony. The execution of the order in the Sinia brigade depended, however, on the conduct of the brigades commanders. The Chamber finds that the practice described above was an inherent design feature of the LRA and that no leading role in the LRA could be obtained or sustained without knowledge of the practice and without an intent to perpetuate it. Indeed, according to the evidence, Dominic Ongwen issued specific orders for abduction of women and girls, regulated the distribution of victims to LRA fighters, and maintained, within his authority as commander of first the Oka battalion and later the Sinia brigade, a disciplinary system which created the coercive environment in which the conduct in question was possible.\n\n139. In light of the available evidence, the Chamber considers that the objective elements of the following crimes are sufficiently established by the evidence: other inhumane acts as a crime against humanity in the form of forced marriage pursuant to article 7(1)(k) of the Statute (charge 61); torture as a crime against humanity pursuant to article 7(1)(f) of the Statute (charge 62) and as a war crime pursuant to article 8(2)(c)(i) of the Statute (charge 63); rape as a crime against humanity pursuant to article 7(1)(g) of the Statute (charge 64) and as a war crime pursuant to article 8(2)(e)(vi) of the Statute (charge 65); sexual slavery as a crime against humanity pursuant to article 7(1)(g) of the Statute (charge 66) and as a war crime pursuant to article 8(2)(e)(vi) of the Statute (charge 67); and enslavement as a crime against humanity pursuant to article 7(1)(c) of the Statute (charge 68).\"\n\nProsecutor v.

Once detained, the Muslims were surrounded and could not leave, being controlled by HVO soldiers and snipers stationed on the surrounding hillsides.1684\n\n1682.

Evidentiary comment:]\n\nP.5. Not sufficient: Evidence of a failed attempt to impregnate.\n\nA. Evidentiary comment:\n\nDuring Preparatory Commission proceedings from March to August 1998, a distinction was drawn between the term forced pregnancy and the term forcible impregnation. One scholar has suggested that use of the term forcible impregnation would have permitted prosecution for the inchoate offense of attempting to forcibly impregnate, while the term forced pregnancy restricts prosecution to cases where pregnancy actually occurred. Similarly, forced pregnancy could only be prosecuted where a victim is capable of conceiving: Assaults on victims who cannot bear children due to age, physical incapacity, or sex cannot be prosecuted as forced pregnancy because the victims cannot become pregnant.(Boon, K., Rape and Forced Pregnancy under the ICC Statute: Human Dignity, Autonomy and Consent, 32 Columbia Human Rights Law Review 625, at 660 (2001)). Where a woman is killed immediately after a rape, intent to commit forced pregnancy cannot be proven (K. Askin, War Crimes Against Women (1997), p. 276). However, forcible impregnation also fails to capture all of the elements of forced pregnancyit refers only to forcibly making a woman pregnant as opposed to keeping her pregnant. (C. Steains, Negotiation on the Term Forced Pregnancy, in R. Lee (ed.) The International Criminal Court: the making of the Rome StatuteIssues, Negotiations, Results (1999), p. 366).\n\nThe restriction of prosecutions to situations where pregnancy actually occurred also means that certain types of sexual assault cannot be prosecuted as forced pregnancy. For example, penetration by objects incapable of causing pregnancy, and oral and anal penetration, could be prosecuted as rape under article 7 (1) (g)-1 but not as forced pregnancy.\n\n3.2.2. Evidence that one or more women were forcibly made pregnant.\n\nA. Evidentiary comment:\n\nAccording to commentators, the term forcibly in the first element of forced pregnancy means done by or involving force, which does not necessarily require the use of violence. (see M. Boot, (f) Forced Pregnancy, in O. Triffterer (ed.), Commentary on the Rome Statute (1999), article 7, margin No. 109; Boon, K., Rape and Forced Pregnancy under the ICC Statute: Human Dignity, Autonomy and Consent, 32 Columbia Human Rights Law Review 625, at 661 (2001)). The definition of forcibly is instead similar to that used in the second element of article 7 (1) (g)-1, the crime against humanity of rape. Forcibly therefore includes force and threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power. This definition parallels footnote 12, which defines the term forcibly as used in article 7 (1) (d), crime against humanity of deportation or forcible transfer of population. As there is not yet any forced pregnancy jurisprudence, some excerpts from means of proof for the forcible element of rape are included below.\n\nP.6. Evidence of the forcible nature of the initial act leading to pregnancy.\n\nA. Evidentiary comment:\n\nThough vaginal rape may prove to be a common method of causing a forced pregnancy, vaginal penetration with sexual organs is not necessary for a finding of forced pregnancy. Forced penetration could apply to any situation or technology by which a woman is made pregnant against her will. The phrase forcibly made pregnant only requires the prosecution to prove that the woman was physically pregnant and that she came to this state through forcible means. (Boon, K., Rape and Forced Pregnancy under the ICC Statute: Human Dignity, Autonomy and Consent, 32 Columbia Human Rights Law Review 625, at 671-72 (2001)).

The Appeals Chamber notes, for example, that in some domestic jurisdictions, neither the use of a weapon nor the physical overpowering of a victim is necessary to demonstrate force. A threat to retaliate in the future against the victim or any other person is a sufficient indicium of force so long as there is a reasonable possibility that the perpetrator will execute the threat.161 While it is true that a focus on one aspect gives a different shading to the offence, it is worth observing that the circumstances giving rise to the instant appeal and that prevail in most cases charged as either war crimes or crimes against humanity will be almost universally coercive. That is to say, true consent will not be possible.\n\n161. California Penal Code 1999, Title 9, Section 261(a)(6). The section also lists, among the circumstances transforming an act of sexual intercourse into rape, where it is accomplished against a persons will by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another (Section 261(a)(2)). Consent is defined as positive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will (Section 261.6).\n\nProsecutor v.

The Trial Chamber, however, accepts the testimony of D.B. who testified that, prior to the intercourse, she had been threatened by Gaga that he would kill her if she did not satisfy the desires of his commander, the accused Dragoljub Kunarac. The Trial Chamber accepts D.B.s evidence that she only initiated sexual intercourse with Kunarac because she was afraid of being killed by Gaga if she did not do so.\n\n667. The Trial Chamber further accepts FWS-50s testimony about her being raped in a beast-like manner by an old Montenegrin soldier that night who wielded a knife and threatened to draw a cross on her back and to baptise her.\n\n711. The three soldiers then took her to the banks of the Cehotina River in Foča near Velečevo, where the accused tried to obtain information or a confession from FWS-183 concerning her alleged sending of messages to the Muslim forces and information about the whereabouts of her valuables while he threatened to kill her and her son. By his attempt to intimidate her, Dragoljub Kunarac also showed his hatred for Muslims, his intention to intimidate her, and his intention to discriminate against Muslims in general, and FWS-183 in particular. All three soldiers raped FWS-183. In the course of the rapes, Kunarac forced her to touch his penis and to look at him. He cursed her. The other two soldiers watched from the car, laughing. While she was raped by Dragoljub Kunarac, FWS-183 heard him tell the other soldiers to wait for their turn. Subsequently, she was raped vaginally and orally by the other soldiers. The rapes resulted in severe mental and physical pain for FWS-183.\n\n761. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that it has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that, while in Radomir Kovačs apartment, FWS-87 was raped by both Kovač and Jagos Kostic. Kovač reserved FWS-87 for himself and raped her almost every night he spent in the apartment. Jagos Kostic constantly raped A.S., and he took advantage of Kovačs absence to rape FWS-87 too. He threatened her that if she reported this to Radomir Kovač he would kill her. Kovač knew at all times that the girls did not consent to the sexual intercourse. Jagos Kostic could rape A.S. because she was held by Kovač in his apartment.

Out of fear that he would kill her she complied with his orders. Mr. Delic told her to get on the bed and to turn around and kneel. After doing so he penetrated her anus with his penis while she screamed from pain. He was unable to penetrate her fully and she started to bleed. Mr. Delic then turned her around and penetrated her vagina with his penis and ejaculated on her lower abdomen. After the rape Ms. Antic continued crying, felt very ill and experienced bleeding from her anus, which she treated with a compress, and was provided with tranquillisers.\n\n961. The third rape occurred in Building A. It was daylight when Hazim Delic came in, armed with hand grenades, a pistol and rifle.

The Trial Chamber rejects the evidence of the accused Dragoljub Kunarac that he was not aware of the fact that D.B. only initiated sexual intercourse with him for reasons of fear for her life. The Trial Chamber regards it as highly improbable that the accused Kunarac could realistically have been confused by the behaviour of D.B., given the general context of the existing war-time situation and the specifically delicate situation of the Muslim girls detained in Partizan or elsewhere in the Foca region during that time. As to whether or not he was aware of the threat by Gaga against D.B., the Trial Chambers finds it irrelevant as to whether or not Kunarac heard Gaga repeat this threat against D.B. when he walked into the room, as D.B. testified. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that D.B. did not freely consent to any sexual intercourse with Kunarac. She was in captivity and in fear for her life after the threats uttered by Gaga.\n\n711.

By his attempt to intimidate her, Dragoljub Kunarac also showed his hatred for Muslims, his intention to intimidate her, and his intention to discriminate against Muslims in general, and FWS-183 in particular. All three soldiers raped FWS-183. In the course of the rapes, Kunarac forced her to touch his penis and to look at him. He cursed her. The other two soldiers watched from the car, laughing. While she was raped by Dragoljub Kunarac, FWS-183 heard him tell the other soldiers to wait for their turn. Subsequently, she was raped vaginally and orally by the other soldiers. The rapes resulted in severe mental and physical pain for FWS-183.\n\n816. The Trial Chamber has no doubt that it was at least a predominant purpose, as the accused obviously intended to discriminate against the group of which his victim was a member, ie the Muslims, and against his victim in particular.\n\nProsecutor v. Zejnil Delalić et al., Case No. IT-96-21-T, Judgement (TC), 16 November 1998, para. 495:\n\n495. The Trial Chamber considers the rape of any person to be a despicable act which strikes at the very core of human dignity and physical integrity. The condemnation and punishment of rape becomes all the more urgent where it is committed by, or at the instigation of, a public official, or with the consent or acquiescence of such an official. Rape causes severe pain and suffering, both physical and psychological. The psychological suffering of persons upon whom rape is inflicted may be exacerbated by social and cultural conditions and can be particularly acute and long lasting.\n\n[B.

Witness K testified about an occasion when one of the cleaning ladies in the camp, Vinka Andzic, came to fetch her, saying that Radic needed her. Radic had previously attempted to coerce her into having sex with him by saying that her children would not be killed if she would agree to having sexual intercourse with him.896 She was led upstairs to the conference room where Radic was waiting. Witness K noticed a foam mattress on the floor,897 and stated that ShCe told me that my children would not be harmed . . . .Then he attacked me, he assaulted me, and he raped me.898 After Radic left, she said that she stayed in the room for a while to try to stop her bleeding, which was due not only to her menstruating but also to the forced penetration of her vagina.899\n\n896.

Witness AT testified that Radic called her out of her room several times during her 23 days spent in Omarska camp. Like other women, she was taken to a room at the end of the corridor, where a sponge mattress was on the floor. The witness described how, on one such occasion, Radic told her to take her clothes off and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him.904 She emphasized: I defended myself, and I asked him why he was doing that. But I had to, under pressure from him, to take my clothes off and lie down on the foam mattress.905\n\n555. The Defense pointed out that the witness acknowledged, during cross-examination, that Radic had helped her by bringing her food and water and by moving her husband from the white house to the glass house.906 However, the Trial Chamber does not find that this fact discredits the testimony of the witness in any way. Indeed, the evidence suggests that he regularly attempted to bribe or coerce victims to agree to sexual intercourse in exchange for favors. The Trial Chamber recalls previous holdings by the Tribunal, as well as Rule 96, dealing with evidence in cases of sexual assault, which states that a status of detention will normally vitiate consent in such circumstances.907\n\n904.

Dragoljub Kunarac et al., Cases No. IT-96-23-T and IT-96-23/1-T, Judgement (TC), 22 February 2001, paras. 574-575, 583, 711:\n\n574. The women were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, where they were mistreated in many ways including, for many of them, being raped repeatedly. Serb soldiers or policemen would come to these detention centres, select one or more women, take them out and rape them. Many women and girls, including 16 of the Prosecution witnesses, were raped in that way. Some of these women were taken out of these detention centres to privately owned apartments and houses where they had to cook, clean and serve the residents, who were Serb soldiers. They were also subjected to sexual assaults.\n\n575. In particular, the Trial Chamber finds that the Muslim civilians held at Kalinovik School, Foca High School and Partizan Sports Hall were kept in unhygienic conditions and without hot water. They were provided with insufficient food. Their freedom of movement was curtailed; they were not allowed to go to any other territory or to go back to their houses. Most of their houses were burnt down or ransacked. They were guarded and lived in an atmosphere of intimidation. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that Kalinovik School, Foca High School and Partizan Sports Hall served as detention centres at the relevant time.\n\n583. Dragoljub Kunarac also knew that Muslim women were specifically targeted, as he himself took several of them to his men and raped some of them himself. In the course of one of these rapes, he expressed with verbal and physical aggression his view that the rapes against the Muslim women were one of the many ways in which the Serbs could assert their superiority and victory over the Muslims. While raping FWS-183, the accused Dragoljub Kunarac told her that she should enjoy being fucked by a Serb. After he and another soldier had finished, Dragoljub Kunarac laughed at her and added that she would now carry a Serb baby and would not know who the father would be. In addition, the accused Dragoljub Kunarac removed many Muslim girls from various detention centres and kept some of them for various periods of time for him or his soldiers to rape.\n\n711. The three soldiers then took her to the banks of the Cehotina river in Foca near Velecevo, where the accused tried to obtain information or a confession from FWS-183 concerning her alleged sending of messages to the Muslim forces and information about the whereabouts of her valuables while he threatened to kill her and her son.

The interrogation of Witness A continued in the pantry, once more before an audience of soldiers. Whilst naked but covered by a small blanket, she was interrogated by the accused. She was subjected to rape, sexual assaults, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by Accused B. Witness D was also interrogated by the accused and subjected to serious physical assaults by Accused B. He was made to watch rape and sexual assault perpetrated upon a woman whom he knew, in order to force him to admit allegations made against her. In this regard, both witnesses were humiliated.\n\n128. Accused B beat Witness D and repeatedly raped Witness A. The accused was present in the room as he carried on his interrogations. When not in the room, he was present in the near vicinity, just outside an open door and he knew that crimes including rape were being committed. In fact, the acts by Accused B were performed in pursuance of the accused's interrogation.\n\n129. It is clear that in the pantry, both Witness A and Witness D were subjected to severe physical and mental suffering and they were also publicly humiliated.\n\n272. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that all the elements of rape were met. Again, the rapes and sexual assaults were committed publicly; members of the Jokers were watching and milling around the open door of the pantry. They laughed at what was going on. The Trial Chamber finds that Witness A suffered severe physical and mental pain, along with public humiliation, at the hands of Accused B in what amounted to outrages upon her personal dignity and sexual integrity.\n\nProsecutor v. Jean-Paul Akayesu, Case No. ICTR-96-4-T, Judgement (TC), 2 September 1998, paras. 430, 437:\n\n430. Witness NN confirmed on examination that the man who raped her penetrated her vagina with his penis, saying he did it in an atrocious manner, mocking and taunting them. She said her sister was raped by the other man at the same time, near her, so that they could each see what was happening to the other. Afterwards, she said she begged for death.\n\n437. According to Witness PP, who then went to Kinihira herself, the three women were forced by the Interahamwe to undress and told to walk, run and perform exercises so that they could display the thighs of Tutsi women. All this took place, she said, in front of approximately two hundred people. After this, she said the women were raped. She described in particular detail the rape of Alexia by Interahamwe who threw her to the ground and climbed on top of her saying Now, lets see what the vagina of a Tutsi woman feels like.\n\n[B. Evidentiary comment:]\n\nP.8.7. Evidence of taking advantage of a coercive environment.\n\nProsecutor v. Miroslav Kvočka et al., Case No. IT-98-30/1-T, Judgement (TC), 2 November 2001, paras. 548, 561:\n\n548. Radić grossly abused his position and took advantage of the vulnerability of the detainees. On one occasion he called Witness J into his office and told her that he could help her if she had sexual intercourse with him.\n\n561. In considering whether severe pain and suffering was also inflicted upon the other victims of sexual violence, the Trial Chamber takes into consideration the extraordinary vulnerability of the victims and the fact that they were held imprisoned in a facility in which violence against detainees was the rule, not the exception. The detainees knew that Radic held a position of authority in the camp, that he could roam the camp at will, and order their presence before him at any time. The women also knew or suspected that other women were being raped or otherwise subjected to sexual violence in the camp. The fear was pervasive and the threat was always real that they could be subjected to sexual violence at the whim of Radic.\n\nProsecutor v. Anto Furundija, Case No. IT-95-17/1-T, Judgement (TC), 10 December 1998, paras. 89, 271:\n\n89. The further abuses visited upon Witness A, who remained in the custody of the Jokers for several weeks, are not the subject matter of the charges against the accused. Witness A continued to be detained until she was released in a prisoner exchange on 15 August 1993. Whilst in captivity, she was repeatedly raped, sexually assaulted and subjected to other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. As a result, she experienced severe physical and mental suffering.\n\n271. The elements of rape, as discussed in paragraph 185 of this Judgement, were met when Accused B penetrated Witness A's mouth, vagina and anus with his penis. Consent was not raised by the Defence, and in any case, Witness A was in captivity. Further, it is the position of the Trial Chamber that any form of captivity vitiates consent.\n\nProsecutor v. Zejnil Delalić et al., Case No. IT-96-21-T, Judgement (TC), 16 November 1998, para. 495:\n\n495. Furthermore, it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which rape, by, or at the instigation of a public official, or with the consent or acquiescence of an official, could be considered as occurring for a purpose that does not, in some way, involve punishment, coercion, discrimination or intimidation. In the view of this Trial Chamber this is inherent in situations of armed conflict.\n\nProsecutor v. Jean-Paul Akayesu, Case No. ICTR-96-4-T, Judgement (TC), 2 September 1998, para. 688:\n\n688. The Tribunal notes in this context that coercive circumstances need not be evidenced by a show of physical force. Threats, intimidation, extortion and other forms of duress which prey on fear or desperation may constitute coercion, and coercion may be inherent in certain circumstances, such as armed conflict or the military presence of Interahamwe among refugee Tutsi women at the bureau communal.\n\n[B. Evidentiary comment:]\n\nP.9. Not required: Evidence that the victim did not consent.\n\nA. Evidentiary comment:\n\nSeveral scholars have suggested that the elements of force in rape and forced pregnancy differ in that forced pregnancy generally does not require proving of lack of consent. Any form of coercion or force or threat of force against the victim or a third person217 negates consent and any form of captivity negates consent.218 This principle applies with equal force to the crime of forced pregnancy. (M. Boot, (f) Forced Pregnancy, in O. Triffterer (ed.), Commentary on the Rome Statute (1999), article 7, margin No. 109).\n\n216. The Oxford Concise Dictionary, supra note 138, 459-460.\n\n217. Prosecutor v. Furundzija, supra note 98, para. 185.\n\n218. Ibid., para. 271.\n\nUnlike rape, forced pregnancy does not require a separate inquiry into whether or not a woman consented to the act that made her pregnant. The elements of forced pregnancy provide for the objective act and the perpetrators subjective mental state, but they do not consider the victims intent or agency. [ ] Furthermore, given the fact that a woman must be confined, by definition, for an act to constitute forced pregnancy, it is only in rare situations that consent could be relevant due to the effect of that confinement on her capacity to make genuine and uncoerced choices.209\n\n209. Legal doctrines on research experiments on prisoners are relevant to this point. The presumption that prisoners are less able to choose and are more vulnerable than free populations has led to detailed regulations on when prisoners may participate in medical experiments. See Garnett, supra note 129, at 478.\n\n(Boon, K., Rape and Forced Pregnancy under the ICC Statute: Human Dignity, Autonomy and Consent, 32 Columbia Human Rights Law Review 625, at 671-72 (2001)).\n\nSince consent also cannot be raised as a defense to the crime against humanity of sexual slavery, art. 7(1)(g)-2, reference to the means of proof for sexual slavery may be helpful.\n\n3.3. The perpetrator intended to affect the ethnic composition of any population; or.\n\n3.3.1. Evidence establishing the ethnic composition of a population.\n\nA. Evidentiary comment:\n\nThe requirement of intent to affect the ethnic composition of a population represents a compromise between Catholic and Arab countries who wanted a high-threshold ethnic cleansing type of intent, and the other group of countries that found such a requirement to be too restrictive, given that forced pregnancy could occur in a variety of different situations (C. Steains, Negotiation on the Term Forced Pregnancy, in R. Lee (ed.) The International Criminal Court: the making of the Rome StatuteIssues, Negotiations, Results (1999), p. 368).\n\nThe specific mental element of intent to affect the ethnic composition of any population is in some ways similar to a common element of the crime of genocide contained in article 6 of the Rome Statute, intent to destroy, in whole or in part, that national, ethnical, racial or religious group (see M. Boot, (f) Forced Pregnancy, in O. Triffterer (ed.), Commentary on the Rome Statute (1999), article 7, margin No. 110). The specific intent required for forced pregnancy, however, is simultaneously broader and narrower than that required for genocide. The intent for forced pregnancy is broader than that for genocide because the perpetrator need not intend to destroy the ethnic group in whole or in partit is sufficient to only attempt to affect the ethnic composition of the population. However, the intent for forced pregnancy is also narrower than that for genocide because only the intent to affect the ethnic composition of a groupand not the national, racial, or religious composition of the groupis sufficient.\n\nThe following means of proof for establishing the existence of an ethnic group are excerpted from those for the common elements of the crime of genocide (article 6 of the Rome Statute). The differences in intent between forced pregnancy and genocide should be taken into account when relying on these means of proof. Jurisprudence of the ICC regarding forced pregnancy will hopefully clarify the specific intent requirement.\n\n3.3.2. In relation to consequence: Evidence showing that the perpetrator meant to affect the ethnic composition of a population.\n\nP.10.

[ ] (b) Many reports state that the perpetrators said they were ordered to rape, or that the aim was to ensure that the victims and their families would never want to return to the area. Perpetrators tell female victims that they will bear children of the perpetrators ethnicity, that they must become pregnant, and then hold them in custody until it is too late for the victims to get an abortion. Victims are threatened that if they ever tell anyone, or anyone discovers what has happened, the perpetrators will hunt them down and kill them.\n\nReport on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia submitted by Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, pursuant to Commission resolution 1992/S-1/1 of 14 August 1992, at p. 69:\n\nP.11.

The perpetrator intended to carry out grave violations of international law.\n\nA. Evidentiary comment:\n\nThe phrase grave violations of international law is used only in the forced pregnancy provisions of the Rome Statute, and thus causes some evidentiary difficulties. It may be helpful to refer to the means of proof for violations of the fundamental rules of international law, contained in article 7 (1) (e), crime against humanity of imprisonment or other severe deprivation of liberty. However, grave violations of international law may prove to be a far broader category than violations of the fundamental rules of international law. One commentator noted:\n\n19.
