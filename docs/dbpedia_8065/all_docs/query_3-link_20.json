        "text": "This article presents a brief survey and analysis of the most intimate coupling of culture and national projects that occurred in Central Europe following the success of the Italian and German nation-states established in this manner during the third quarter of the nineteenth century. Language is the very`stuff' of culture as well as the instrument of communicating and reaffirming cultural difference vis-aÁ-vis other cultures. As such, language became central to the processes of nation-and nation-state-building in Central Europe, leading to politicisation of language and also of linguistics and philology, which were expected to fortify the nations and their nation-states than rather to lend themselves to objective research. It is proposed that this specific Central European interweaving of language and national projects may be better comprehended through the application of Einar Haugen's model of language standardisation and Miroslav Hroch's model of nation-building. These two models in the Central European case seem to be closely corresponding to each other. The short catalogue of language elements used to produce national differentiation closes this contribution.\n\nThe First Czechoslovak Republic (October 28th, 1918 – september 30th, 1938) was formed through the assimilation of different ethnic groups: a large majority of Czechs and Slovaks and “minorities” constituted by Hungarians, Poles and over 3 million German speaking individuals. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the causes and consequences of the linguistic policies abided by in the first Czechoslovak Republic which were presented in the Constitution of 1920 (together with the Language Act) and, especially, to compare and apprehend their impact in the German and Slovak speaking population.\n\nLanguage, besides being known as the best form of communication known to man, is also known to serve as a marker of (national) identity. In countries such as Yugoslavia, Serbo-Croatian, as the language used by the majority of the population, saw itself splinter into allegedly different languages from the 1990s onwards, from the breakup of the Yugoslav state, as it was used as a separating factor for the strengthening of national identities. In Czechoslovakia, on the other hand, even though the state boasted two separate languages (however genetically close), linguistic nationalism did not find a fertile ground to flourish with the breakup of Czechoslovakia. This article explores the linguistic, political and societal differences and similarities between linguistic and political issues in Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, comparing the diverging policies of language as a defining factor of national identity.\n\nThe author traces the development of Central European languages and the transition from religion-based self-determination to language-based nationalism. He explores the emergence of nation-states through linguistic component. He names ethnolinguistic groups and minorities existing in Central Europe and evaluates their influence within nation-state.
