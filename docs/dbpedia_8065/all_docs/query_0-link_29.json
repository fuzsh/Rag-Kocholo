Please call the case.\n\n7 THE REGISTRAR: Good morning. Case number IT-95-9-T, the\n\n8 Prosecutor versus Blagoje Simic, Miroslav Tadic, and Simo Zaric.\n\n9 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes, Mr. Pisarevic.\n\n10 WITNESS: SIMO ZARIC [Resumed]\n\n11 [Witness answered through interpreter]\n\n12 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Good morning, Your Honours.\n\n13 Examined by Mr. Pisarevic: [Continued]\n\n14 Q. Good morning, Mr. Zaric. Yesterday, before we adjourned, we\n\n15 talked about your first information that you submitted to the command\n\n16 about the situation with the morale in the 2nd Bosnian Brigade and about\n\n17 the things that you had found in place when you assumed the post. We are\n\n18 talking about the situation that you found in the 2nd Posavina Brigade.\n\n19 Once you informed the command about the situation, did the command\n\n20 decide to draft a more detailed information about the causes that had a\n\n21 direct bearing on the situation with morale and relationships in the 2nd\n\n22 Posavina Brigade, and who was tasked with drafting this information?\n\n23 A. Such a decision was indeed made at the level of the command of the\n\n24 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade. The body that I was the head of was tasked\n\n25 with drafting such a document.\n\nPage 19555\n\n1 Q. According to the authorities and the competencies of the body for\n\n2 morale and religious and legal affairs, was that your obligation, as the\n\n3 person who was at the head of that body?\n\n4 A. Yes, precisely so. Besides me, there was just another legal\n\n5 officer in the body, and another officer who was in charge of civilian\n\n6 issues. So as regards the drafting of this information, I had to do most\n\n7 of it, because I was an assistant commander.\n\n8 Q. Mr. Zaric, how did you obtain information, how did you get by the\n\n9 knowledge that you later on incorporated into your report?\n\n10 A. In order to draft such a report that would reflect the real\n\n11 situation as regards the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade, I used the best\n\n12 method of work that was available to me at the time. That means that I\n\n13 would go directly to all the infantry battalions, to all the independent\n\n14 units which were on the strength of the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade, and\n\n15 I talked to the most responsible persons in those units, starting with\n\n16 their commanders and their assistants, especially those in charge of moral\n\n17 guidance and security, and very often, in agreement with the assistants\n\n18 for morale guidance of these units, I also used those moments when the men\n\n19 of certain units were supposed to relieve other men who were on the first\n\n20 front lines, to talk with them about the problems that were visible in\n\n21 their units. Then I would draft notes and I would thus obtain information\n\n22 as to how the last men in the unit thought about the situation that was in\n\n23 place in the area of responsibility of the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade.\n\n24 Q. When you were drafting this information, this document, did other\n\n25 members of the command participate in the drafting of this information?\n\nPage 19556\n\n1 If so, could you then tell us who those people were who, together with\n\n2 you, participated in the drafting of this information.\n\n3 A. When I was doing this work - and I must say that I had to invest a\n\n4 lot of effort to reach every unit and to carry out all these talks - and\n\n5 when this information was prepared in its, so to say, roll version, then a\n\n6 Working Group was assigned by the command, who was supposed to provide\n\n7 certain input into that information and help me to prepare this\n\n8 information in the most correct way. Members of this Working Group were\n\n9 Mr. Marko Tubakovic, who was the assistant commander for replenishment and\n\n10 personnel affairs in the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade, and I believe that\n\n11 it was in his job description to do that, because he was the one who had a\n\n12 lot of contact with the units on the ground. And there was also Mr. Jovo\n\n13 Savic, a captain, who was a member of the operative educational body, and\n\n14 also a member of the staff of the brigade.\n\n15 Q. In what month were you given the task to prepare this information,\n\n16 and during which months did you work on the drafting of this information?\n\n17 A. I got this task in late October, once I drafted my first\n\n18 information that I wrote based on the first time I saw the situation.\n\n19 Having realised that this called for a more elaborate analysis that would\n\n20 show what had a bearing on the morale of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, the\n\n21 command decided that this information indeed should be drafted, and I\n\n22 dedicated most of the time to drafting this information during the months\n\n23 of October and November 1992.\n\n24 Q. Mr. Zaric, this information, or this document, rather, was it a\n\n25 subject of any discussion by the command of the 2nd Posavina Infantry\n\nPage 19557\n\n1 Brigade?\n\n2 A. Yes. This document was the subject of discussion, and let me\n\n3 first tell you: I personally drafted this information, taking into\n\n4 account certain suggestions by my colleagues from the Working Group, and\n\n5 this material that was drafted by me and my Working Group was read to the\n\n6 command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade. All the members of the command were\n\n7 present and they discussed this information that they had just heard.\n\n8 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Can we have P127 ter put before\n\n9 Mr. Zaric. This is the information, i.e., the document that we have just\n\n10 been talking about.\n\n11 Q. Mr. Zaric, while we are waiting for this exhibit, can you please\n\n12 tell us: When was this information adopted?\n\n13 A. This information was adopted in late November or, to be more\n\n14 precise, on the 29th of November, 1992.\n\n15 Q. Can you please look at this information very briefly, and then we\n\n16 will talk about the discussions that ensued and the way this information\n\n17 was adopted. Can you please tell us if this is that information.\n\n18 A. Yes, that is the information that I drafted.\n\n19 Q. Mr. Zaric, who were the people present at the session of the\n\n20 command when the discussion took place about this information and when\n\n21 this information was adopted?\n\n22 A. When the information was being adopted as a document, with the\n\n23 conclusions that arose from the discussion, that session of the command of\n\n24 the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade was attended by the following people:\n\n25 On behalf of the command of the Eastern Bosnia Corps, as our Superior\n\nPage 19558\n\n1 Command, there were two assistant commanders of the Eastern Bosnia Corps.\n\n2 One of them was my immediate superior, according to my subordination\n\n3 line. That was Colonel Zivko Dosen. And the other one, the other\n\n4 assistant who also participated in this discussion was Colonel Dragan\n\n5 Jakovljevic, who was assistant commander of the Eastern Bosnia Corps for\n\n6 intelligence and security.\n\n7 Q. Let's just clarify one thing. What was Zivko Dosen's role?\n\n8 A. Zivko Dosen was assistant commander of East Bosnia Corps for\n\n9 morale, guidance, religious, and legal affairs.\n\n10 Q. Which members of the command were present when the information was\n\n11 discussed and adopted?\n\n12 A. All the people who put their signature on this information were\n\n13 present, and the only person who was absent was Captain Milojevic, who was\n\n14 the assistant commander for logistics. He had participated in previous\n\n15 discussions, but on that particular day he was absent, for certain\n\n16 reasons, and I believe that there was another member of the command who\n\n17 was absent. He was the assistant chief of security. All in all, there\n\n18 were 13 of us who signed this information, who had participated in the\n\n19 discussion and who had drafted the conclusions that you can see at the end\n\n20 of this information.\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, can you please look at the last page of this document.\n\n22 Was it decided by the command that all the present -- on behalf of the\n\n23 command should sign this information?\n\n24 A. Yes. It was decided that all the members of the command should\n\n25 sign this information. We're talking about the army, so there was no\n\nPage 19559\n\n1 voting, as one would have at a political forum. When the discussion\n\n2 ended, a proposal was heard and put forward that all the members of the\n\n3 command should put their signature on this information and thus support\n\n4 what is contained in this information, and this is exactly what happened.\n\n5 Q. Did all the members of the command who were present there\n\n6 personally sign this information?\n\n7 A. All to the last signed this information, and all the members of\n\n8 the command really eagerly, and in the most responsible and constructive\n\n9 way, participated in the discussion, so that the fact that they put their\n\n10 signature and supported this information gives this information the\n\n11 character that it has.\n\n12 Q. Mr. Zaric, can you please look at number 3, where it says \"the\n\n13 command of the brigade.\" Can you please read what it says under number\n\n14 3. Is that you, and is this your signature?\n\n15 A. Yes. This is me and this is my own signature.\n\n16 Q. Mr. Zaric, how was this document which was adopted at the session\n\n17 of the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade evaluated by your superior officers?\n\n18 I'm referring primarily to Mr. Zivko Dosen, who was your immediate\n\n19 superior, as regards the organ for morale, religious, and legal affairs?\n\n20 A. This information was evaluated with a very good evaluation by\n\n21 Mr. Dosen and Mr. Jakovljevic. Our command passed a test of maturity and\n\n22 humaneness by speaking out in the way that it did in this document.\n\n23 Perhaps I'm being immodest, but I know because I participated at a meeting\n\n24 in the East Bosnia Corps, where the commander himself, General Simic, and\n\n25 others who took part in the debate, referred to this document of the 2nd\n\nPage 19560\n\n1 Posavina Infantry Brigade, mentioning it as an example of how other units\n\n2 should have the strength to speak out in public about the morale of the\n\n3 soldiers of the army of Republika Srpska.\n\n4 Q. Thank you. What did the command decide to do? No. I withdraw\n\n5 this question. Just tell us: To whom was this information sent?\n\n6 A. The information had the character of a confidential document. In\n\n7 its original form, it was submitted to the Superior Command, that is,\n\n8 directly to the command of the East Bosnia Corps, which then had its\n\n9 headquarters in Bijeljina.\n\n10 Q. And what did the command decide as to how this information should\n\n11 be used in the future?\n\n12 A. The command decided that this information should be forwarded, or\n\n13 rather, that all the soldiers in the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade should\n\n14 be acquainted with the content of this information, in a reasonable\n\n15 manner. And I must say that two or three days after this information was\n\n16 adopted, a meeting was held in Obudovac which was attended by all the\n\n17 commanders of the infantry units and the independent units, their\n\n18 assistants for morale and security, and I was also at this meeting. So\n\n19 was Chief Milan Josic, and part of the meeting was attended by the\n\n20 commander of the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade, Mr. Mile Beronja.\n\n21 At this meeting, we informed all those present about the positions\n\n22 taken by the command, about the situation we had found, and we gave all\n\n23 these men the task, because we considered them to be most responsible for\n\n24 the situation in their units, of transmitting this information and these\n\n25 evaluations to the soldiers, without referring to the original text of the\n\nPage 19561\n\n1 information, but simply saying that this was one of the documents debated\n\n2 at the command of the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade.\n\n3 In its original form, the document was not forwarded to\n\n4 lower-level units as a confidential document, because we did not want it\n\n5 to give rise to other kinds of reactions.\n\n6 Q. Very well. Did the command decide that this document, that is,\n\n7 this information, should be forwarded to the representatives of the\n\n8 civilian authorities?\n\n9 A. No. There was no mention of this, but it was decided that the\n\n10 representatives of the civilian authorities should be informed about\n\n11 certain standpoints which were expressed both in this document and in the\n\n12 debate that was held, and part of the information that was crucial for the\n\n13 people then in power in the municipality of Samac and Pelagicevo under\n\n14 formation.\n\n15 Q. Mr. Zaric, what happened after this information about the\n\n16 situation as regards morale was adopted and signed at the command of the\n\n17 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade?\n\n18 A. I have to say that after a few days I was sincerely disappointed\n\n19 to a certain extent because the original text of this document, as far as\n\n20 I was able to learn, was taken by Commander Beronja, although we hadn't\n\n21 agreed that this should be done and had acquainted Mr. Milan Simic and\n\n22 Mr. Todorovic with this document, and he was accompanied by a man who was\n\n23 working in the command for replenishment and personnel affairs and who was\n\n24 not a member of the command but was an influential man in the brigade\n\n25 command.\n\nPage 19562\n\n1 Q. Was a meeting held, Mr. Zaric?\n\n2 A. Yes.\n\n3 Q. Between the command and the representatives of the civilian\n\n4 authorities?\n\n5 A. Yes, right away, because the disclosure of certain matters from\n\n6 this document, as was unfortunately done by our commander, reverberated\n\n7 like a bomb that had exploded in our small area, and right away a meeting\n\n8 was held.\n\n9 Q. Mr. Zaric, who convened that meeting, and where was it held?\n\n10 A. As far as I know, the meeting was called by the commander of the\n\n11 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade, and the meeting was held in Pelagicevo, in\n\n12 one of the rooms there. And the commander invited the representatives of\n\n13 the authorities from the Samac Crisis Staff and people from the\n\n14 authorities in Pelagicevo, as an integral part of the municipality under\n\n15 formation.\n\n16 Q. Was the meeting attended by all the members of the command?\n\n17 A. I can't be absolutely certain that they were all there, but 90 per\n\n18 cent of us members of the command were certainly present.\n\n19 Q. And was the meeting attended by some commanders of the infantry\n\n20 battalions from the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade?\n\n21 A. Yes. The battalion commanders were there, and the commanders of\n\n22 the independent units. So this was an important meeting of the most\n\n23 important people from the military, and also the most responsible people\n\n24 from the civilian authorities.\n\n25 Q. Did you attend the meeting, Mr. Zaric?\n\nPage 19563\n\n1 A. Yes, I did, of course.\n\n2 Q. Thank you. Who of the representatives of the civilian authorities\n\n3 of Bosanski Samac attended the meeting? Can you enumerate the names?\n\n4 A. Of the representatives of the authorities, there was Mr. Blagoje\n\n5 Simic, as the president of the Crisis Staff; Milan Simic, as the president\n\n6 of the Executive Board of the Municipal Assembly of Samac municipality;\n\n7 then there was Stevan Todorovic, as the chief of the public security\n\n8 station of the municipality of Bosanski Samac; there was Mr. Savo Popovic,\n\n9 as a member of the Crisis Staff of the municipality of Samac; there was\n\n10 Mr. Bozo Ninkovic, who at that time -- I don't know whether he was a\n\n11 member of the War Presidency. I'm not sure of that. But I know he did\n\n12 attend the meeting, if in no other capacity than as the chief of the\n\n13 ministry department for National Defence at the level of the municipality\n\n14 of Bosanski Samac. Along with all these gentlemen, there was also a guest\n\n15 who had arrived with Mr. Todorovic and whose name was Ostoja Minic. He\n\n16 introduced himself as a High Representative of the Ministry of the\n\n17 Interior of Republika Srpska.\n\n18 Q. Thank you. As far as you can recollect, was the meeting also\n\n19 attended by Simeon Simic?\n\n20 A. It's possible, but I'm not a hundred per cent certain of that.\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, who chaired and presided over the meeting?\n\n22 A. The meeting was chaired by our commander, the commander of the 2nd\n\n23 Posavina Brigade, Major Mile Beronja.\n\n24 Q. Can you tell us who took part in the debate at this meeting?\n\n25 Primarily I mean the representatives of the civilian authorities who\n\nPage 19564\n\n1 attended the meeting.\n\n2 A. I remember well that the discussion included a brief intervention\n\n3 by Mr. Blagoje Simic, but he was not among the first to speak from the\n\n4 civilian authorities, and a very long polemic and discussion was conducted\n\n5 by Mr. Milan Simic, as the representative of the Executive Board,\n\n6 Mr. Stevan Todorovic, as the chief of the public security station; and to\n\n7 our great surprise, Mr. Ostoja Minic, who had arrived as a guest and\n\n8 introduced himself as a High Representative of the Ministry of the\n\n9 Interior of Republika Srpska.\n\n10 Q. Can you remember whether Mr. Bozo Ninkovic took part in the\n\n11 discussion?\n\n12 A. Yes. Mr. Bozo Ninkovic also took part in the discussion, and on\n\n13 behalf of the brigade command, there was a brief discussion by the\n\n14 commander, who made a few brief comments. Then the Chief of Staff and one\n\n15 of the battalion commanders, Mr. Savo Bosic.\n\n16 Q. Thank you. Can you recall, after all this time has elapsed, what\n\n17 Mr. Blagoje Simic said at that meeting?\n\n18 A. In my opinion, Blagoje Simic was the most sensitive to the fact\n\n19 that this information touched upon political issues, and he felt that the\n\n20 command and the military should not be dealing with these issues. He\n\n21 thought it was not proper for the military to give political assessments,\n\n22 and that's what he mostly complained about, because he felt that this\n\n23 could upset the relationship between politics and the military as a\n\n24 defence component. This was the most serious criticism put forward by\n\n25 Mr. Blagoje Simic at that meeting.\n\nPage 19565\n\n1 Q. You have already said that Stevan Todorovic also took part in the\n\n2 discussion at that meeting. First of all, tell me: What state was\n\n3 Mr. Todorovic in at that meeting? Could something be noticed on him?\n\n4 A. Yes. I have to say, and it doesn't refer just to Mr. Todorovic,\n\n5 that it was sad to see in what state Mr. Todorovic, Mr. Milan Simic, and\n\n6 Mr. Ostoja Minic, who introduced himself as a High Representative, were\n\n7 in. They were more than drunk, without any feeling of responsibility for\n\n8 what was said at that meeting which, in my view, was very important.\n\n9 Q. Thank you. Can you now tell us briefly what Stevan Todorovic said\n\n10 at that meeting.\n\n11 A. Stevan Todorovic evidently had at his disposal information as to\n\n12 who might be the author of the document, regardless of the fact that there\n\n13 were 13 signatories to the document. He used the word -- rather, he said\n\n14 that the KGB system could be seen in this document, the KGB was the secret\n\n15 service of the former Soviet Union and part of the Yugoslav UDBA, U-D-B-A.\n\n16 He was alluding to the fact that I was the author of this document, and he\n\n17 wanted to say that it was something that any person should condemn rather\n\n18 than giving it its proper weight. He said that there were many\n\n19 insinuations, lies, that there was slander in the document. He said that\n\n20 these were Stalinist methods. These were very harsh words. He felt that\n\n21 this was some kind of military putsch, that it was to bring into question\n\n22 the existing authorities in the municipalities of Bosanski Samac and\n\n23 Pelagicevo.\n\n24 Q. You have already said what kind of state Mr. Milan Simic was in.\n\n25 Can you tell us briefly what Mr. Milan Simic said at that meeting?\n\nPage 19566\n\n1 A. Mr. Milan Simic was very arrogant. I had never seen him in that\n\n2 light before. He supported the approach of Mr. Todorovic as to the way in\n\n3 this information was drawn up and what its outlines were. And then he\n\n4 addressed all of us in the command in a very cynical manner. He said we\n\n5 had to bear in mind, because the army was dependent on them - and when I\n\n6 say \"them,\" I meant the authorities - so he said if the Executive Board,\n\n7 and I and my men don't bring cigarettes to the soldiers on the line, if we\n\n8 don't bring them food, how do you think you will survive? And this caused\n\n9 a lot of bitterness and outrage, so that one of the commanders who was\n\n10 present and who had a lot of authority in the 2nd Posavina Infantry\n\n11 Brigade, and that was Mr. Savo Bosic, who was the commander of the 1st\n\n12 Infantry Battalion, which was part of the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade.\n\n13 He spoke.\n\n14 Q. Can you remember what Mr. Savo Bosic said on that occasion?\n\n15 A. Mr. Savo Bosic said to Mr. Simic, first of all, you should have\n\n16 arrived at this meeting in a normal state and not drunk. Secondly, he\n\n17 told him that it was very sad that the first man of the executive\n\n18 government should have such an arrogant attitude toward his own army,\n\n19 because we were an army originating from that area. In the morning we\n\n20 were defending the lines; in the afternoon we were working on the fields\n\n21 and in the factories. So Mr. Bosic responded to this very primitive\n\n22 reaction by Mr. Milan as a representative of the executive government in\n\n23 the municipality of Samac.\n\n24 Q. Sir, at some point you mentioned Mr. Simic. Were you thinking of\n\n25 Mr. Milan Simic?\n\nPage 19567\n\n1 A. Yes. I was thinking of Mr. Milan Simic, as the president of the\n\n2 Executive Board.\n\n3 Q. Do you recall what Bozo Ninkovic said at that occasion?\n\n4 A. Bozo Ninkovic introduced himself as being the representative, and\n\n5 in fact he was one, of the ministry of the National Defence of the\n\n6 Republika Srpska, and as chief of the department, stating that, according\n\n7 to him, there were some elements and that the army, in spite of the laws\n\n8 of the National Defence, was mixing itself in other competencies which\n\n9 were not its place. He didn't have any particular arguments to support\n\n10 this theory, but I would say that in this litany of critics of this choir\n\n11 of people who came to tell us various things, he was just basically\n\n12 supporting all the complaints that the other ones were formulating.\n\n13 Q. Mr. Zaric, please tell us, according to your recollection: How\n\n14 did Ostoja Minic behave and what did he say at the meeting in question?\n\n15 And I'm thinking of that man who was representing the Ministry of the\n\n16 Interior of the Republika Srpska.\n\n17 A. That's a story on its own, I must say. I saw him for the first\n\n18 time then. Even though he introduced himself as being some kind of an\n\n19 inhabitant of Donja Dubica, that he was born in the municipality of Odzak,\n\n20 that he was a compatriot, he was so drunk that it was incredible. But he\n\n21 very openly, very openly and in a way was a very destructive conversation,\n\n22 he said and started to threaten, stating that this material is a criminal\n\n23 act and that he directly -- or that it directly criticises constitutional\n\n24 order of the Republika Srpska, and stating that he had the occasion to\n\n25 control the work of the security station and that many things that were\n\nPage 19568\n\n1 said as an indicational way, because in that context the information was\n\n2 not talking about the authors of these actions, but it just stated the\n\n3 actions. He said that the security post was working well, and accordingly\n\n4 to the law, that there's nothing illegal going on at that security\n\n5 station. And he was a member of a work group which represented the\n\n6 Ministry of the Interior, and this work group came even before and after\n\n7 on the territory covered by the security station. Now, as to what was\n\n8 found in that security station, we've heard Mr. Slavko Paleksic, who\n\n9 testified before this Honourable Court, and I believe that everything was\n\n10 said through him.\n\n11 Q. You told us who were the members who took part in this\n\n12 conversation, but did you, Mr. Zaric, take part in this conversation?\n\n13 A. Unfortunately, in spite of the fact that I was trying to find my\n\n14 words, or find words from my commander - I was sitting right next to him.\n\n15 I was sitting to his left side, and to his right side, the chief of the\n\n16 staff, Mr. -- Captain Josic was there, Major Beronja was his name, and he\n\n17 didn't allow me to talk because he said that it was not a good moment to\n\n18 speak. The atmosphere was not good, and that is why I shouldn't be\n\n19 defending the -- whatever this information was stating. So that's why I\n\n20 must say that the command did not have its chance and the members of the\n\n21 command did not get a chance to explain to these men who represented the\n\n22 authorities to say what was our purpose, why was this information\n\n23 written. Maybe I'm not being modest, but I am one -- I was one of the\n\n24 most influential people who worked on the drafting of this information. I\n\n25 was never given the chance to even say a word during that meeting.\n\nPage 19569\n\n1 Q. Mr. Zaric, tell us: How many times did you ask the commander to\n\n2 give you the possibility to speak or to take the floor?\n\n3 A. Well, a few times, three times, actually. Whenever these men from\n\n4 the authorities would take the floor and they would evaluate us the way\n\n5 they were, I thought that it was very important to show and to explain\n\n6 what were the purposes why and how we got these informations which were\n\n7 stated in this document called the information. And in spite of the fact\n\n8 that I myself wanted to participate in this meeting, I was not given a\n\n9 chance to take the floor.\n\n10 Q. Mr. Zaric, how did this meeting end?\n\n11 A. This meeting ended, I would say, in an atmosphere which was\n\n12 resembling the Far West.\n\n13 Q. Can you describe to us what do you mean?\n\n14 A. When Mr. Ostoja Minic, who was a man who introduced himself as\n\n15 being a High Representative of an organ of the Ministry of the Interior of\n\n16 Republika Srpska, he said some very heavy words and he was insulting the\n\n17 command. He was saying that it was our responsibility to -- for if a\n\n18 putsch would occur and we should expect that the authorities would\n\n19 change. And the other members of the command had a very strong opinion\n\n20 also, but Mr. Jovan Erletic entered in a sort of a verbal duel with him.\n\n21 He was a member of the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade and he was present.\n\n22 So he was the one who had this verbal duel with him.\n\n23 Q. Did I understand you correctly? This meeting basically was not\n\n24 fruitful; it did not bring out many conclusions?\n\n25 A. No, because this verbal duel, in the end, turned out to be a scene\n\nPage 19570\n\n1 in which Mr. Minic got up, walked towards Mr. Erletic, and the latter is a\n\n2 very strong man, a very robust man, and he answered at that moment in such\n\n3 a way that he did not allow Mr. Minic to approach him and to grab him by\n\n4 the jacket. So he grabbed the other one and they started to push each\n\n5 other. There was some pushing and shoving and they were shoving each\n\n6 other on the wall. And I was more under the impression that we were in a\n\n7 restaurant of the Far West rather than at a very important meeting.\n\n8 Q. After this incident, did this meeting continue, or was it over?\n\n9 A. No. It was interrupted at that point. We each went on our merry\n\n10 way, and basically it just ended without any conclusion. And I think that\n\n11 given the seriousness and the character of the people who were present\n\n12 there, this meeting ended without a conclusion and without any serious\n\n13 messages that could objectively be given or be brought after such a\n\n14 serious meeting.\n\n15 Q. After this meeting was ended, Mr. Zaric, tell me: Were there any\n\n16 procedures taken against you on behalf of some authorities of the civil\n\n17 authorities?\n\n18 A. After this information and after this meeting, I was basically set\n\n19 aside from that very moment up until the end of the war. Some people from\n\n20 the authorities didn't really like me, and I don't -- I can't even tell\n\n21 you how lucky I am to be alive today and to be testifying here before this\n\n22 international criminal justice court.\n\n23 Q. The Ministry of the Defence of the Samac department, did they send\n\n24 some kind of a letter to the attention of the Eastern Corps, Eastern\n\n25 Bosnia Corps?\n\nPage 19571\n\n1 A. Yes. Right after, one or two days after the adoption of this\n\n2 information, a letter arrived. This letter was drafted on behalf of the\n\n3 department of the Ministry of Defence of Samac, and in this letter I was\n\n4 being degraded. This letter stated about the desertion of my son Mirel,\n\n5 who was 17 years old at the time. He was going to the fourth year of the\n\n6 gymnasium, and they were saying that I had some dubious contacts with some\n\n7 people on the municipality. And they suggested in this letter that the\n\n8 command of the brigade should think seriously about how exemplary or how\n\n9 recommended it is that such a man should be at such a high position within\n\n10 the command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade.\n\n11 Q. Thank you, sir.\n\n12 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Could the witness please be shown\n\n13 the document D31/4.\n\n14 Q. Mr. Zaric, please take this document and put it on the ELMO so\n\n15 that we can all see it.\n\n16 MR. LAZAREVIC: I believe we have some technical problems. We\n\n17 cannot see anything on the ELMO.\n\n18 JUDGE MUMBA: We can go ahead, Mr. Pisarevic, because -- what the\n\n19 document is all about and then discuss it with the witness.\n\n20 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Very well.\n\n21 JUDGE MUMBA: We don't need to have it on the ELMO. We already\n\n22 have it, actually, because it's an exhibit.\n\n23 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you. Your Honour, it is not\n\n24 necessary, but I just thought that it would facilitate the matter.\n\n25 Q. Mr. Zaric, you have read this document, you know its contents?\n\nPage 19572\n\n1 A. Yes, and I will remember this document until I die.\n\n2 Q. Mr. Zaric, tell us: Is there anything in this document that\n\n3 resembles the truth?\n\n4 A. Those are all lies and defamations. There's not one single word\n\n5 of truth in this document. And as you can see, this document was\n\n6 forwarded to very important organs from the municipality and the territory\n\n7 of the East Bosnia Corps. And, according to Mr. Ninkovic, it was just to\n\n8 shed a very ugly light on my own person.\n\n9 Q. Very well. Thank you. Could you please tell us if this document\n\n10 was discussed during a meeting of the 2nd Posavina Brigade.\n\n11 A. Yes, it was discussed during a meeting of the command, and as a\n\n12 member of the command when this document was forwarded, I, as a member,\n\n13 insisted that the command should take positions regarding some evaluations\n\n14 of myself which were stated in this document. I wanted them either to\n\n15 support me or to condemn this disqualification or this way of behaviour.\n\n16 The command reacted in a very positive way, and they had written a letter\n\n17 back to the author of this text, Mr. Bozo Ninkovic.\n\n18 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Could we please show Mr. Zaric\n\n19 Document D32/4. That is a letter of the command of the 2nd Infantry\n\n20 Posavina Brigade.\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, please take a look at this document. We are not going\n\n22 to discuss the content, because the document speaks for itself. But just\n\n23 please confirm to us, if you can: Is this the document which is actually\n\n24 a letter, stemming from the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade, forwarded to\n\n25 the Ministry of Defence of Posavina, department of Samac, and is this an\n\nPage 19573\n\n1 answer to the letter sent by Mr. Bozo Ninkovic, who was at the time chief\n\n2 of the ministry, the department of Ministry of Defence in Bosanski Samac?\n\n3 A. Yes, this is a reaction to this letter. It is. This letter was\n\n4 sent from the command and this letter was sent to Mr. Ninkovic.\n\n5 Q. Mr. Zaric, is this written by a commander or does this stem from\n\n6 the command, as a general body?\n\n7 A. It comes from the 2nd Posavina Infantry Brigade, but this document\n\n8 is signed by the commander.\n\n9 Q. Very well. Thank you.\n\n10 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] We do not need this document any\n\n11 more.\n\n12 Q. Mr. Zaric, the command of the East Bosnia Corps, did it take any\n\n13 measures with regard to this document or was it something that was\n\n14 discussed only by your own command?\n\n15 A. As far as I know, the command of the East Bosnia Corps did not\n\n16 take any particular measures once they received this information. They\n\n17 left it to us to deal with this internally, in our area of responsibility,\n\n18 to the best of our abilities.\n\n19 Q. Mr. Zaric, are you aware of the fact that there was a session of\n\n20 the Municipal Assembly of Samac municipality on the 16th of December,\n\n21 1992, in the Trile restaurant in Pisari village?\n\n22 A. I'm aware of the fact, and I personally attended that session.\n\n23 Q. How did you attend that meeting? In what capacity? In what\n\n24 capacity did you attend the meeting that was held on the 16th of December,\n\n25 1992?\n\nPage 19574\n\n1 A. I had the authority of the commander of the 2nd Posavina Infantry\n\n2 Brigade, Major Beronja, to go to that meeting. It was also in the\n\n3 description of my job. It was more normal for the assistant commander for\n\n4 morale, religious, and legal affairs to represent the command as a liaison\n\n5 officer between the command and the civilian bodies. Very often times I\n\n6 was bypassed, but this time, Commander Beronja gave me his authority to\n\n7 attend the session which was held on the 16th of December, 1992, in Pisari\n\n8 village, in the well-known restaurant Trile, and that's how I went and\n\n9 participated in that session, as a guest, on behalf of my brigade.\n\n10 Q. Can you tell us in brief outlines: What was discussed at that\n\n11 session and whether the information drafted by the 2nd Posavina Infantry\n\n12 Brigade was considered at that session, and was it in any way discussed?\n\n13 A. As far as I remember, there were several items on the agenda, and\n\n14 this information, as a document, was not on the agenda; at least, I didn't\n\n15 see it. However, there was another evaluation of security and political\n\n16 situation that was elaborated by a document drafted by the Crisis Staff.\n\n17 This was one item on the agenda and this was the information that was\n\n18 discussed and which gave the tone to the entire session which was held on\n\n19 the 16th of December.\n\n20 Q. Mr. Zaric, although you were only a guest at that session, were\n\n21 you given an opportunity to take the floor and address the deputies of the\n\n22 Municipal Assembly of Samac?\n\n23 A. Yes, I was given that opportunity. I was given the opportunity to\n\n24 speak. I can only say that one of the participants in the discussion was\n\n25 the former or the first president of the Executive Board of the Municipal\n\nPage 19575\n\n1 Assembly of Samac, Mr. Mirko Jovanovic. And when we considered the\n\n2 evaluation of the security and political situation, that was done on the\n\n3 basis of a particular bulletin, and my name was mentioned as one of the\n\n4 first traitors of the Serbian people and the author of some dubious\n\n5 material. Then I received attacks from the most responsible persons from\n\n6 the government; however, I tried to contribute in my own style and I tried\n\n7 to explain what was treated by the information that I authored. However,\n\n8 my impression was that my words did not penetrate the minds and the\n\n9 conscience of the deputies of Samac municipality.\n\n10 Q. Who were the deputies who portrayed you as a traitor of the\n\n11 Serbian people?\n\n12 A. First of all, I would like to say that the information was\n\n13 presented in a bulletin, with particular iconography, and that was signed\n\n14 by Mr. Blagoje Simic. Who were other people who supported that text, I\n\n15 wouldn't go into that, but I know that at that session, the attacks on me\n\n16 were by Mr. Milan Simic, by Mr. Stevan Todorovic, Aco Jankovic, especially\n\n17 Mr. Simeun Simic and also Mr. Blagoje Simic, who said that I engaged in\n\n18 politics while I worked in the army.\n\n19 MR. LAZAREVIC: There are two words missing here. When Mr. Zaric\n\n20 was talking about Mr. Blagoje Simic, he said also in the milder form.\n\n21 This is what we heard of what Mr. Zaric said. I don't see this in the\n\n22 transcript.\n\n23 JUDGE MUMBA: Is that line 20 or line 19?\n\n24 MR. LAZAREVIC: It's page -- it's page 22, line 19.\n\n25 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. I think we can clear the confusion.\n\nPage 19576\n\n1 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n2 Q. Mr. Zaric, you were talking about the people who participated in\n\n3 that session, and you mentioned that Mr. Blagoje Simic also spoke. Tell\n\n4 us: What did you say a little while ago? How did Mr. Blagoje Simic talk\n\n5 about you and about the information that you authored?\n\n6 A. What was recognisable at that session, and the way I had seen and\n\n7 perceived Blagoje Simic, he did not participate in many discussions.\n\n8 However, he always protected the political core, and in that meeting he\n\n9 also pointed to the fact that either I or the command of the brigade\n\n10 interfered too much in politics. And according to him, this was not the\n\n11 task of the army. That was his opinion. And I was given the chance to\n\n12 react, and I said that his words were too harsh and that this is not what\n\n13 the army did. And that is the only thing that he said. He talked about\n\n14 the political engagement. If the Trial Chamber deems it necessary for me\n\n15 to say what other participants said, I will gladly do that and you will\n\n16 become aware how much calmer and milder Mr. Blagoje Simic was with respect\n\n17 to the other participants in the discussion.\n\n18 Q. Was his position milder than the position of other participants in\n\n19 the discussion?\n\n20 A. Absolutely. His position was much, much milder. However, when he\n\n21 presented this political differentiation, he was talking to me and he was\n\n22 addressing me, and he didn't attack me as much as the others did.\n\n23 Q. Mr. Zaric, are you aware of the fact that some deputies of the\n\n24 Municipal Assembly of Samac, who were SDS members, who didn't agree with\n\n25 the discussion and the overall politics, walked out of that assembly and\n\nPage 19577\n\n1 the SDS party? Are you aware of the fact? Do you remember that? And if\n\n2 you do, can you tell us who these people were.\n\n3 A. I remember two cases. One was -- involved Mr. Milan Jekic, who at\n\n4 the beginning of the war was the assistant commander of the police station\n\n5 in Bosanski Samac. Formerly he had been an SDS deputy. At that\n\n6 particular session of the assembly, he publicly voiced his disagreement\n\n7 with the policy of the Serbian Democratic Party and the words of some\n\n8 people who participated in that discussion, and he said that from then on\n\n9 he should not be considered a member of the SDS and he would no longer\n\n10 come to any of the sessions of the assembly. As far as I know, Mr. Jekic\n\n11 didn't go back on these words.\n\n12 The second participant in that discussion who was very critical\n\n13 against Mr. Milan Simic and the work of the Executive Board was Mr. David\n\n14 Simic who was also a deputy and a member of the Serbian Democratic Party.\n\n15 However, later on I heard that he did not abandon his seat in the assembly\n\n16 and that he remained a member of the assembly. But at that particular\n\n17 moment, he was very negative towards some of the moves by the Executive\n\n18 Board and by Mr. Milan Simic, who at that time was the head of that body.\n\n19 Q. At that session, what did Mr. Mirko Jovanovic say? He was the\n\n20 former president of the Executive Board of the Samac municipality and the\n\n21 president of the --\n\n22 MR. LAZAREVIC: [Previous translation continues]... Question posed\n\n23 by Mr. Pisarevic was not properly recorded. The question was: \"At that\n\n24 session, what happened to Mr. Mirko Jovanovic, former president of the\n\n25 municipal board -- Executive Board,\" I'm sorry. The question was not:\n\nPage 19578\n\n1 What did Mr. Mirko Jovanovic say?\n\n2 JUDGE MUMBA: Let's just have the question posed again.\n\n3 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n4 Q. Mr. Zaric, what do you know about -- what happened at that session\n\n5 to Mr. Mirko Jovanovic, the former president of the Executive Board of the\n\n6 Municipal Assembly of Samac, who, at the same time, was the president of\n\n7 the Executive Board of the Assembly of the Serbian People of Samac\n\n8 municipality and Pelagicevo under formation?\n\n9 A. Mirko Jovanovic was given an opportunity to say for the first time\n\n10 before the highest body as to how he had been removed from his position as\n\n11 the president of the Executive Board, and for what reasons. He thought\n\n12 that this was an illegitimate act, and he said that some move that had\n\n13 been taken at the beginning, in the early days of the war, were not the\n\n14 moves that he, as the president of the Executive Board, could have\n\n15 seconded. His attendance of the funeral of Aleksandar Vuk, a Special, who\n\n16 was killed on the 1st of May of 1992, from which he couldn't return\n\n17 because of certain problems, that is, the corridor in the area of Brcko\n\n18 municipality was cut off, he was late, and that was used as a reason for\n\n19 the people in the government to believe that he did not want to go on\n\n20 performing his tasks. He said that he didn't want to leave the Serbian\n\n21 Democratic Party. He said that within his abilities, he would continue\n\n22 fighting for some of the goals. And as far as I know, Mirko Jovanovic,\n\n23 either that year or in the following year, he became a deputy in the\n\n24 peoples assembly of Republika Srpska.\n\n25 MR. PANTELIC: I do apologise to my learned friend. Intervention\n\nPage 19579\n\n1 to the transcript with regard to the interpretation. It's page 25, line\n\n2 13. Mr. Zaric said: \"Before the highest legislative body,\" I believe,\n\n3 and we heard that. And the other issue, maybe my learned friend\n\n4 Mr. Pisarevic can clarify whether Mr. Zaric is speaking on the legislative\n\n5 body on the municipal level or it's a higher level, in order to clarify\n\n6 that. Thank you.\n\n7 JUDGE MUMBA: First of all we deal with the omission of the\n\n8 legislative body. Do you accept what Mr. Pantelic has said, that you had\n\n9 said it was before the highest legislative body?\n\n10 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, yes.\n\n11 JUDGE MUMBA: That's all right. The second part where\n\n12 Mr. Pantelic wants to clarify, you can clarify that with Mr. Simo Zaric, I\n\n13 think.\n\n14 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n15 Q. Mr. Zaric, when you said \"the highest legislative body,\" were you\n\n16 referring to the Municipal Assembly of Bosanski Samac being the highest\n\n17 legislative body on the territory of the municipality of Bosanski Samac?\n\n18 A. Yes. That's precisely what I meant to that. I meant that, yes.\n\n19 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, as Mr. Zaric has\n\n20 already mentioned the bulletin that was published, I would ask that\n\n21 Exhibit D29/4 be put in front of him. This is the bulletin in which the\n\n22 role of Mr. Zaric was mentioned.\n\n23 Q. Mr. Zaric, please have a look at the document before you put it on\n\n24 the ELMO. Have you seen it? First tell us, Mr. Zaric: What is this\n\n25 bulletin?\n\nPage 19580\n\n1 A. This bulletin is one of the ways in which the public was provided\n\n2 with information about the assessments made by the people in the\n\n3 authorities, or rather, what the authorities felt the people should be\n\n4 informed about. There were many such bulletins published during the war,\n\n5 and the chief ideologues and editors of everything contained in these\n\n6 bulletins were Mr. Simic and Mr. Bozo Ninkovic.\n\n7 Q. Mr. Zaric, you mentioned Simic. Since we have had many people in\n\n8 these proceedings with the last name of Simic, could you tell us his first\n\n9 name?\n\n10 A. I said Simeun Simic. I said Mr. Simeun Simic. I don't know\n\n11 whether it entered the transcript.\n\n12 Q. So the person is Mr. Simeun Simic, is it not?\n\n13 A. Yes, it's Mr. Simeun Simic, and I think that the title of this\n\n14 bulletin deserves attention. I wish to draw everyone's attention to this.\n\n15 Q. Mr. Zaric, please tell us: Is this a regular issue of the\n\n16 bulletin or is it a special issue?\n\n17 A. This was a special issue, and here in the middle it says that it's\n\n18 a special issue. And it was specially published for the first assembly of\n\n19 the municipality of Samac and Pelagicevo under formation, which was held\n\n20 on the 16th of December, 1992.\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, would you please turn to page 3. I think it's page 3,\n\n22 where your name is mentioned.\n\n23 JUDGE WILLIAMS: Excuse me, Mr. Pisarevic. Before we do that,\n\n24 Mr. Zaric had stated a couple of lines before, I think it was lines 16 and\n\n25 17 on page 27, that he thought that the title of the bulletin deserved\n\nPage 19581\n\n1 attention.\n\n2 Perhaps, Mr. Zaric, you could tell us what the title is and why it\n\n3 deserves attention before Mr. Pisarevic moves on with his next question.\n\n4 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n5 Q. Yes. I interrupted you.\n\n6 A. Would the usher please help me, because I don't know how to work\n\n7 this equipment. It should be moved a little bit. If you can move it up a\n\n8 bit.\n\n9 The first thing I want to say is that this is a special issue, and\n\n10 here in the middle, that's what it says, that it's a special issue. This\n\n11 large title here says: \"Enemies don't have a chance.\" This is the chief\n\n12 political message of this bulletin. And on the right and left, it\n\n13 mentions the assessment of the security situation in the municipality.\n\n14 Because of this phrase here, which is so evident on the front page, and\n\n15 the fact that it's a special issue, I think this has a certain weight,\n\n16 especially if you look at pages 2 and 3, and there you can see something\n\n17 connected to my name, and some other people who are called to task in this\n\n18 material.\n\n19 MR. PANTELIC: Could Mr. Zaric be so kind to read the full title\n\n20 the -- of this bulletin.\n\n21 JUDGE MUMBA: I'm sure he can read that, because it's --\n\n22 MR. PANTELIC: No, no, no. [Interpretation] No, Mr. Zaric. Just\n\n23 the topic, the topic. You don't have to read every word. What it says\n\n24 here in a slanting line, could you read out the whole title, please.\n\n25 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] The writing says: \"Political and\n\nPage 19582\n\n1 security situation in the municipality.\"\n\n2 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Very well.\n\n3 Q. Mr. Zaric, before you look at the page I wanted you to look at,\n\n4 would you please tell me: Did this bulletin have the character of a means\n\n5 of information in the municipality of Samac in 1992 and 1993? Was it part\n\n6 of the media, so to speak?\n\n7 A. Yes, it was. And I don't know in how many copies it was printed,\n\n8 but there were enough to reach all the institutions in the municipality\n\n9 and the soldiers, the ranks. So it was a means of information until\n\n10 conditions were created for a proper newspaper, which was called Corridor,\n\n11 later on.\n\n12 Q. And who published this information?\n\n13 A. It was the bulletin of the Crisis Staff, as the highest\n\n14 legislative body in the municipality.\n\n15 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, I think it's time\n\n16 for a break now.\n\n17 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. We'll take our break now.\n\n18 --- Recess taken at 10.30 a.m.\n\n19 --- On resuming at 11.01 a.m.\n\n20 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes, Mr. Pisarevic.\n\n21 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n22 Q. Mr. Zaric, will you please look at this document which is before\n\n23 you, the bulletin. Can you tell us whether your name is mentioned here\n\n24 and whether it says that you are neither a deputy nor a member of any\n\n25 assembly body?\n\nPage 19583\n\n1 A. On page number 2 of this bulletin, the middle paragraph, there is\n\n2 a sentence which reads as follows: \"The fact that this is a strange\n\n3 session of the assembly is also shown by the fact that the agenda contains\n\n4 some material authored by Simo Zaric, who is neither a deputy nor a member\n\n5 of any assembly organ.\"\n\n6 Q. Thank you, Mr. Zaric. Where it says \"material,\" do you understand\n\n7 this to mean the information drawn up by the command of the 2nd Posavina\n\n8 Infantry Brigade?\n\n9 A. Yes. This is the material mentioned in the bulletin.\n\n10 Q. Mr. Zaric, would you look at the signature at the bottom of the\n\n11 page. What does it say here?\n\n12 A. In the signature, it says \"president of the War Presidency of the\n\n13 municipality of Samac, Dr. Blagoje Simic,\" and there is his signature.\n\n14 Q. Is there also a stamp? If you can read it. If it's not legible,\n\n15 don't try. It's not really very legible.\n\n16 A. Well, obviously this is the stamp of the Crisis Staff, because I\n\n17 can see that it mentions the Municipal Assembly. But I don't see the\n\n18 entire text. I see that part of it says \"Samac,\" so I assume this is the\n\n19 official stamp then used by the Crisis Staff for its needs.\n\n20 Q. Very well. Thank you. We no longer need this document.\n\n21 Mr. Zaric, did you suffer any consequences after learning of the\n\n22 existence of this information and after this bulletin was published? Did\n\n23 you continue holding the post of the assistant commander for morale,\n\n24 religious, and legal affairs in the command of the 2nd Posavina Infantry\n\n25 Brigade?\n\nPage 19584\n\n1 A. Yes. I stayed on until the autumn of 1993, when I was definitely\n\n2 replaced and assigned to the duty of a private in a unit.\n\n3 Q. Mr. Zaric, as a private in the army of Republika Srpska, where did\n\n4 you go to the war theatre?\n\n5 A. I was in quite a few places, from Han Pijesak, in the direction of\n\n6 Zepa, on Majevica, in Bosansko Grahovo, in Krupa, in Glamoc, in Drvar, and\n\n7 there is no part of the war front in the area of responsibility of the 2nd\n\n8 Posavina Infantry Brigade where I was not with the military.\n\n9 Q. Thank you, Mr. Zaric. And throughout this time, you were a common\n\n10 private in the army of Republika Srpska?\n\n11 A. A common private, although I had an officer's rank. I was\n\n12 commanded by common privates or by sergeants. But I didn't mind. All I\n\n13 wanted was to survive.\n\n14 Q. Thank you. Mr. Zaric, do you have any information about the\n\n15 arrest of Stevan Todorovic and Milan Simic by the military police from\n\n16 Brcko, that is, from the East Bosnia Corps of the army of Republika\n\n17 Srpska?\n\n18 A. Yes, I did have this information.\n\n19 Q. What did you know about the arrest of Stevan Todorovic and Milan\n\n20 Simic?\n\n21 A. As far as I can recall, this was sometime in the first half of\n\n22 November 1992. The members of the military security of the East Bosnia\n\n23 Corps, or rather, their representatives, acting through the military\n\n24 police on the territory of the municipality of Brcko, arrested Mr. Stevan\n\n25 Todorovic and Milan Simic, for certain reasons I was not aware of, and\n\nPage 19585\n\n1 this, of course, gave rise to reactions by certain political structures\n\n2 and some members of the renegade forces. And a part of the road passing\n\n3 through the territory in the direction of Bijeljina and Brcko was cut off.\n\n4 Q. The cutting off of the corridor, where it did happen? In the area\n\n5 of what municipality?\n\n6 A. This happened on the territory of the municipality of Samac, at\n\n7 two points. One was at the crossroads in Crkvina, where part of the road\n\n8 leads in the direction of Modrica, and further on, in the direction of the\n\n9 western part of Republika Srpska; and the other part of the road leads in\n\n10 the direction of Gradacac. The other large point where a bottleneck was\n\n11 created to prevent people from using the corridor, this was on the road to\n\n12 Gradacac, near the village of Kornica, where the road turns left to the\n\n13 village of Gornja Slatina. It was at this crossroads that the barricade\n\n14 was set up, blocking passage along that communication.\n\n15 Q. Can you be a bit more precise as to which forces took part in the\n\n16 closing off of the corridor?\n\n17 A. I was unfortunately a participant of this drama. When we talk\n\n18 about the corridor of Crkvina and the stopping of people to cross were\n\n19 members of the Special Forces, they wore camouflage uniforms, they had\n\n20 hats on their heads. We couldn't see their faces. And there was a\n\n21 member -- there were members of the special force, and they were in the\n\n22 direction of Kornica, going towards Gornja Slatina.\n\n23 Q. Mr. Zaric, when you talk about members of Special Forces, who are\n\n24 these people?\n\n25 A. By closing off the corridor, we knew that Mr. Dragan Djordjevic,\n\nPage 19586\n\n1 Crni, was leading that action, and he was also accompanied by Mr. Slobodan\n\n2 Miljkovic, Lugar. He was his fateful assistant. And there were also some\n\n3 other people with them, some volunteers who had come at the time from\n\n4 Serbia to our territory. And there were some local members of the Special\n\n5 Forces who in them saw their heroes.\n\n6 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you have an encounter with these people who were on\n\n7 these barricades which, through the corridor, was cut? If you did have\n\n8 any contacts, please tell us what happened.\n\n9 A. Yes, I did have a direct contact, first in Crkvina in a car in\n\n10 which I was. At that point, it was in the afternoon hours and I was going\n\n11 in the direction of Pelagicevo. I was headed to the command in\n\n12 Pelagicevo, where I was the assistant of the commander for morale,\n\n13 religious, and legal affairs. I was also accompanied by at the time by\n\n14 Captain Jovo Savic. He was also a member of that command. We were\n\n15 stopped at the point by an officer of the police station, Mr. Tesic\n\n16 Djordje. He came by car, and behind him we could see four or five special\n\n17 members, members of the Special Forces. They were armed to the teeth.\n\n18 They had hats on their heads and we couldn't know who was there. We didn't\n\n19 recognise them. We didn't know who they were, who was hiding behind these\n\n20 uniforms.\n\n21 Mr. Djordje approached us and told us: Where are you coming\n\n22 from? How come you came here? They have the task to kill you.\n\n23 I was so surprised, and I was so astonished by this, and by such a\n\n24 reaction of Mr. Djordje Tesic, whom I had known as a very serious police\n\n25 officer, because before the war he also worked for a certain period of\n\nPage 19587\n\n1 time on the territory of the Republic of Croatia. To be more precise, in\n\n2 Osijek. And because of the war before -- because of problems before the\n\n3 war, he came to Samac and became a professional police officer at the\n\n4 police station of Samac. He only said the following: Turn around and run\n\n5 away before Lugar shows up.\n\n6 Q. And what did you and Mr. Jovo Savic do at that point?\n\n7 A. I was driving the car. I did not have time to think. I was under\n\n8 the impression that this was no joke. We turned around and we went back\n\n9 where we came from. We went in the direction of Bosanski Samac, and from\n\n10 that crossroad, all the way up until Bosanski Samac and up until the\n\n11 building in which I live, there's approximately 4 kilometres. That's the\n\n12 distance between the crossroads and my building.\n\n13 Q. Did you have other encounters of the sort?\n\n14 A. That evening we hid in such a way that it would look like it was\n\n15 an event from a film. We noticed that in Samac arrived a car. Some\n\n16 people were inside that car and they had special uniforms. They wore\n\n17 these special hats. And we went around that settlement, that part of the\n\n18 town, and very quickly we were able to put the car in the garage and to\n\n19 enter my apartment building, the number 4, the entrance number 4 of that\n\n20 apartment building, and we were following from upstairs and we could see\n\n21 them drive around, because we couldn't understand what had happened to us,\n\n22 to me and Captain Savic. We had spent all that night awake. We stayed\n\n23 up, and we were ready that should they enter the apartment building, we\n\n24 were ready to fight back with weapons in order to save our lives. But\n\n25 that night, nobody came into that building, into my building. Nobody came\n\nPage 19588\n\n1 into that entrance, since Mr. Savic and myself were awake and we were\n\n2 watching to see what was going on around the building.\n\n3 Q. So Mr. Jovo Savic, Captain Jovo Savic and yourself, what did you\n\n4 do in the morning?\n\n5 A. In the early morning hours, around 6.00 a.m., as soon as daytime\n\n6 came, we thought the situation became more or less normal, so Mr. Savic\n\n7 and myself drove in the direction -- through Crkvina in the direction of\n\n8 Kornica. And what's interesting to say here is that that morning, in\n\n9 Crkvina, there were no patrol cars, there was no checkpoint, and we\n\n10 thought that the situation had gone back to normal. But around 6.30 a.m.,\n\n11 we arrived to the second checkpoint, where we could see a tank, a Praga,\n\n12 some military vehicles. The situation was horrifying. We saw, on the\n\n13 road that goes from Gornja Slatina towards the crossroads, that there were\n\n14 dozens and dozens of various vehicles, from trucks to buses. Everything\n\n15 was blocked. And near that crossroads, as we were going from Crkvina to\n\n16 the crossroad, we -- Mr. Vincetic got into our car. I remember that last\n\n17 name because the son of that Vincetic died, and that's why that man had\n\n18 gone from Obudovac, and he asked us if we could give him a ride.\n\n19 When we approached the crossroad, all of a sudden Captain Savic\n\n20 said: Look, there's Lugar with his team, with his group of people, at the\n\n21 crossroad. And we were at that point approximately 50 to 70 metres away\n\n22 of the crossroad. I stopped my car, and to the right-hand side, Captain\n\n23 Savic saw, from that house where we had stopped, his wife was born in that\n\n24 house and this is where her parents lived. So we thought that maybe it\n\n25 was a good idea to stop and to very calmly go and pay them a visit. It\n\nPage 19589\n\n1 was his in-laws. And we thought that maybe we can have a coffee and think\n\n2 and see, evaluate how Mr. Lugar would react, and all these volunteers who\n\n3 were armed to the teeth and who were, all them, aside from Lugar or two or\n\n4 three men, wore these camouflage uniforms and these hats, and we couldn't\n\n5 see who they were.\n\n6 Q. What happened afterwards?\n\n7 A. We stayed there about half an hour. We had coffee. We were\n\n8 looking out the window to see what the situation was like. The situation\n\n9 did not change. And then we evaluated that it would be a good idea to get\n\n10 in the car and go on our way, because we thought that Mr. Lugar would come\n\n11 with his group of people, because they were very attentive to our car and\n\n12 they were very often looking at the car and in our direction. So we got\n\n13 in the car. I was driving for about 20 to 30 metres, and all of a sudden,\n\n14 in the direction of the car, that police officer, Djordje Tesic, who had\n\n15 told us the previous evening to stop, or who had stopped us at the\n\n16 crossroad in Crkvina, and behind him, Mr. Lugar was walking in the middle\n\n17 of the road, and to the left, as well as to the right, he was accompanied\n\n18 by five special members, and they were dressed in such a way as I already\n\n19 described to you. Their weapons were pointing at us, and they all started\n\n20 heading in the direction of the car in which we were, and that I stopped.\n\n21 Mr. Tesic, Djordje, only said the following: Gentlemen, you are\n\n22 under arrest. And from this moment on, you will have to go to the base in\n\n23 Hrvatska Tisina.\n\n24 I only asked: Who gave such an order, and who can give such an\n\n25 order? At which point, Mr. Lugar came to us by car, so he approached us,\n\nPage 19590\n\n1 and I must say that he is very particular. I'm not going to describe him\n\n2 to you. He is very cynical. When you look at him, you fear. So he came\n\n3 close to me. He was about 20 centimetres away from me. He looked inside\n\n4 the car. He saw Captain Savic. He also noticed Mr. Vincetic, whom he\n\n5 probably didn't even know. And he said: Look at my little birds. They\n\n6 came me on their own. As if we were some little birds, and as if we had\n\n7 flown into his nest. That's what he meant. So he said: Little birds,\n\n8 where are you flying to? Where are you going? That's what he said, in a\n\n9 very arrogant way. I tried to be very determined, and I said: I'm going\n\n10 to the command of the brigade. I'm going to work. He said: What\n\n11 command? Of which brigade, Mr. Zaric? And I said: Mr. Lugar, you know\n\n12 very well that I'm a member of the command and that I'm going to\n\n13 Pelagicevo.\n\n14 At that point -- and I just want to say this before: That when\n\n15 they started walking towards the car I said to Captain Savic not to move\n\n16 his hand or his arm. I didn't move either because I knew what the\n\n17 reaction would have been. If they wanted to kill us, I thought that it\n\n18 was sufficient to make a wrong move and they would have pierced the car\n\n19 with bullets. We just stayed calm, and I believe that this is what helped\n\n20 us not to get killed at that time.\n\n21 Now, to the right-hand side of me where Mr. Jovo Savic was\n\n22 sitting, he was also approached by one of these men who were wearing a\n\n23 camouflage uniform. And when this other guy saw Savic, he said: Uncle,\n\n24 what are you doing there? When he said something, he recognised that it's\n\n25 Mihajcic, who is a member of his family and who was wearing this\n\nPage 19591\n\n1 camouflage uniform. So when he said \"Uncle,\" this calmed Mr. Lugar down.\n\n2 And so he said, literally, the following: Gentlemen, go directly to\n\n3 Pelagicevo. I'm going to be there in half an hour from now and I want to\n\n4 find you at the command.\n\n5 We didn't say anything. I was only thinking whether I would get\n\n6 out of that situation alive and whether there would be no incident as the\n\n7 car leaves. Fortunately, there was no other incidents, there was no other\n\n8 measures taken towards us. The car just started, we turned left. And I\n\n9 must say that hundreds and hundreds of buses, trucks, and people were\n\n10 stopped on that road, and they -- it was very difficult to drive, but we\n\n11 went on through the right and we were able to go through and drive on. So\n\n12 we got to Donji Zabari, where at that point there was a forward command\n\n13 post of the East Bosnia Corps.\n\n14 Q. So how did it end, this closing off of the corridor situation?\n\n15 A. Mr. Jovo Savic and myself were in Donji Zabari and we found there\n\n16 the commander of the corps. He was already a general at the time, General\n\n17 Major Novica Simic. We told him what happened, and we asked him: How is\n\n18 it possible that someone should behave that way and close off a corridor?\n\n19 He told us that he was following the situation. He thinks that our\n\n20 commander, Beronja, was quite guilty for it. It was his fault. That's\n\n21 what he said at the time. But he also told us not to be scared to go to\n\n22 the command and that he informed about this the commander and General\n\n23 Mladic, as well as the commander of the 1st Krajina Corps, Mr. Momir\n\n24 Talic, who was very soon supposed to send an armoured unit of his which\n\n25 was supposed to make sure that this corridor be reopened.\n\nPage 19592\n\n1 Q. And in the end was the corridor reopened after a period of time?\n\n2 A. Yes, during the day the corridor was reopened and an armoured\n\n3 unit, tank unit, bearing other means, arrived from the part of Odzak which\n\n4 is in the zone of responsibility there, who was headed by Colonel\n\n5 Dupljanin. And because of such an important number of men who arrived and\n\n6 because they were quite impressive, the people who had closed off the\n\n7 corridor, such as Crni, Lugar, and other special members, must have\n\n8 thought that they stand no chance and that it would not be a good idea to\n\n9 fight. And fortunately, through the intervention of Colonel Beronja, who\n\n10 went there on the premises, the barricades were removed, the special\n\n11 members were withdrawn, and the corridor was reopened.\n\n12 Q. Do you know what happened to Mr. Todorovic and Mr. Milan Simic?\n\n13 Were they released from prison?\n\n14 A. Yes. I know that several days later they were released.\n\n15 According to my information, they were taken to Bijeljina, where they were\n\n16 interrogated by the security organs, and later on, upon somebody's\n\n17 intervention, they were released and they were -- they returned to\n\n18 Bosanski Samac. And this contributed to the calming down of the\n\n19 situation.\n\n20 Q. Mr. Zaric, what happened after that to those people, Crni, Lugar,\n\n21 and others who were in the area of Samac municipality?\n\n22 A. As far as I know, given the dramatic nature of that situation\n\n23 before the corridor was closed, information was available to us that a\n\n24 group of scouts from the 2nd Krajina Brigade had been illegally arrested.\n\n25 Their commander was Jovo Vukobrat and their area of responsibility was\n\nPage 19593\n\n1 towards Gradacac, in that part. And these scouts had been arrested by\n\n2 Crni, Lugar, Captain Jez, who discharged the duties of the assistant\n\n3 commander of intelligence and security in the 2nd Posavina Brigade,\n\n4 unfortunately. And after the incident with the corridor, I suppose that\n\n5 this situation was taken the most of, and it seems that during the arrest\n\n6 of these scouts, one of them was killed in a very brutal manner and was\n\n7 hidden in a kiln by those who had killed him. And that's when Crni,\n\n8 Lugar, and their group of specials were arrested, among them was a person\n\n9 from the territory of Samac municipality. These people were taken to the\n\n10 remand centre of the military prison in Banja Luka, and later on\n\n11 proceedings were initiated against them by the military prosecutor and by\n\n12 the military court.\n\n13 Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Zaric. Now I would kindly ask you to\n\n14 tell us something about the events that have been mentioned by various\n\n15 witnesses before this Trial Chamber. The first thing I'd like to ask you\n\n16 is the following: Mr. Zaric, together with Teodor Tutnjevic, also known\n\n17 as Toso, were you ever in the police station in Bosanski Samac in the\n\n18 period between 18 April and 26 April 1992? I'm talking about an event\n\n19 which allegedly happened during the night.\n\n20 A. No. I was never in the public security station during the night.\n\n21 The longest period of my stay there was on the 26th of April, 1992.\n\n22 Q. Mr. Zaric, are you familiar with any person whose nickname is\n\n23 Bokan?\n\n24 A. I know of Bokan only from the media, from the newspapers. I\n\n25 believe that he belonged to some pro-Chetnik units. All I know about this\n\nPage 19594\n\n1 person I read in the newspapers.\n\n2 Q. Mr. Zaric, in the police station in Bosanski Samac, did you ever\n\n3 see or were you present while somebody was cocking their pistol against\n\n4 Mr. Sulejman Tihic's head and fired in the air?\n\n5 A. Nothing like that ever happened before my eyes.\n\n6 Q. Between the 17 April 1992 and the end of 1992, did you ever give\n\n7 an interview or did you ever participate in any radio show? When I said\n\n8 \"interview,\" I meant whether you ever spoke to a journalist of Radio\n\n9 Samac.\n\n10 A. No, I never gave any interviews. I never appeared on any shows on\n\n11 Radio Samac at that time.\n\n12 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you ever issue an order to anybody regarding their\n\n13 work obligation, either those in Bosanski Samac or in Odzak?\n\n14 A. Never. This was not my task. I did not have any reason to do\n\n15 that. All that was under the authority of the department of the Ministry\n\n16 of Defence, so anybody who says differently is lying.\n\n17 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, I would like to go\n\n18 into private session because I'm going to mention some names of the\n\n19 witnesses who were protected before this Trial Chamber.\n\n20 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. Can we go into private session.\n\n21 [Private session]\n\n22 (redacted)\n\n23 (redacted)\n\n24 (redacted)\n\n25 (redacted)\n\nPage 19595\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Page 19595  redacted  private session.\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 19596\n\n1 (redacted)\n\n2 (redacted)\n\n3 (redacted)\n\n4 (redacted)\n\n5 [Open session]\n\n6 THE REGISTRAR: We are in open session.\n\n7 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n8 Q. Mr. Zaric, do you know a citizen of Bosanski Samac by the name of\n\n9 Amir Dervic?\n\n10 A. I know Amir Dervic. We are nodding acquaintances. He is the\n\n11 brother of a Dervic whom I knew better. We used to call him Les. He\n\n12 worked in the public security centre, in the communications department,\n\n13 and that's how I also know the younger Dervic, his brother.\n\n14 Q. And do you know whether Amir Dervic was a member of the 4th\n\n15 Detachment of the JNA?\n\n16 A. Yes, he was a member of the 4th Detachment, and his commander was\n\n17 Dzemal Jasenica.\n\n18 Q. Mr. Zaric, on the night between the 16th and the 17th April 1992,\n\n19 did you use a Motorola to communicate with Amir Dervic and did you issue\n\n20 orders to him?\n\n21 A. I did not have any Motorolas available to me. The only\n\n22 communication means that we had was Rupovka 12, and we used it to\n\n23 establish communication with the commander. So any story about Motorolas\n\n24 [Realtime transcript read in error \"moment row las\"], Rupovkas or any such\n\n25 thing is just a fabrication.\n\nPage 19597\n\n1 MR. LAZAREVIC: Just one small clarification. It's not clear what\n\n2 the answer is here. \"So any story about moment row las\"; it's Motorolas,\n\n3 here on page 43, line 24 and 25.\n\n4 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. Yes. Perhaps Mr. Zaric can just repeat what\n\n5 he said slowly.\n\n6 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n7 Q. Please, Mr. Zaric.\n\n8 A. I said that I did not have a Motorola. Motorolas were not at the\n\n9 time available to us. We did not have them at our disposal. And to be\n\n10 more precise, never during the war on the defence line of the town of\n\n11 Samac Motorolas were used as the means of communication among the men on\n\n12 the front line. We used a different means of communication. It was a\n\n13 very simple means of communication. We did not have Motorolas, and\n\n14 especially not on that morning that you have just referred to.\n\n15 Q. Mr. Zaric, you mentioned this wire connection. Let's clarify this\n\n16 a bit. What do you mean when you say: \"We had a wire connection\"? Wire\n\n17 means of communication.\n\n18 A. Yes, wire communication. When the line of defence was\n\n19 established, when trenches were dug and bunkers erected, and when trenches\n\n20 were traced for the army to move safely through, then we also established\n\n21 a wire connection. That means that we put a coil of wire on a little\n\n22 device that only had one receiver, and then when you turn this coil\n\n23 several times, then it starts ringing, and the next such device was a bit\n\n24 further, and another one a bit further, all along the trench. This was a\n\n25 direct link to the person who was the commander of that defence line. And\n\nPage 19598\n\n1 every of these devices had its communication. So when somebody called,\n\n2 they would say: Can number 1 respond? And number 1 would respond. There\n\n3 was also number 2, number 3, and number 4. When the coil is turned,\n\n4 everybody's line is ringing, everybody picks up the receiver at the same\n\n5 time, but then the person calling has to identify the one whom he wants to\n\n6 respond. And vice versa: If the person on the line wanted to communicate\n\n7 with the base, they did the same thing. And that's how the communication\n\n8 was established. That is what we did in order for the army to communicate\n\n9 on the defence line.\n\n10 Q. Mr. Zaric, is that a classical telephone wire line?\n\n11 A. Yes, it is a classical telephone wire line.\n\n12 Q. This way of communication by way of classical telephone wire\n\n13 communication, could that be eavesdropped on? Could anybody in the enemy\n\n14 forces hear that?\n\n15 A. No, nobody could tap into that line. Nobody else could hear that\n\n16 communication. It was impossible.\n\n17 Q. Thank you.\n\n18 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] And now I would kindly ask the\n\n19 Trial Chamber to allow me to go into private session, because I'm going to\n\n20 mention a witness who testified here as a protected witness.\n\n21 JUDGE MUMBA: We'll go into private session.\n\n22 [Private session]\n\n23 (redacted)\n\n24 (redacted)\n\n25 (redacted)\n\nPage 19599\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Page 19599  redacted  private session.\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 19600\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Page 19600  redacted  private session.\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 19601\n\n1 (redacted)\n\n2 (redacted)\n\n3 (redacted)\n\n4 (redacted)\n\n5 (redacted)\n\n6 (redacted)\n\n7 (redacted)\n\n8 (redacted)\n\n9 (redacted)\n\n10 (redacted)\n\n11 (redacted)\n\n12 (redacted)\n\n13 (redacted)\n\n14 (redacted)\n\n15 (redacted)\n\n16 (redacted)\n\n17 (redacted)\n\n18 (redacted)\n\n19 (redacted)\n\n20 (redacted)\n\n21 (redacted)\n\n22 (redacted)\n\n23 (redacted)\n\n24 [Open session]\n\n25 THE REGISTRAR: We are in open session.\n\nPage 19602\n\n1 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n2 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you ask Stevan Todorovic, the chief of police in\n\n3 Bosanski Samac, to release some other people from detention, in addition\n\n4 to Tihic and Witness N?\n\n5 A. In principle, I did not conceal my dissatisfaction, and there was\n\n6 a constant verbal skirmish going on. I felt that people could not be\n\n7 arrested and deprived of their liberty without certain criteria being\n\n8 applied, and this is what Mr. Todorovic and the police were doing. He\n\n9 always said that I should not get involved with that, that he was in\n\n10 charge of that, so I was constantly, how shall I say it, trying to\n\n11 intervene verbally with Mr. Todorovic. And I remember well an incident\n\n12 when Mr. Esref Zaimbegovic, whom the Crisis Staff appointed in the\n\n13 beginning to be the coordinator in Utva, and I was -- no, in Uniglas, and\n\n14 I was encouraged by this, because when it so happened that when I went to\n\n15 see Mr. Simic in the Crisis Staff, Mr. Blagoje Simic, I would see\n\n16 Mr. Simic sitting in an office working with people, and Esref Zaimbegovic\n\n17 working in the next office as coordinator. And I thought that conditions\n\n18 were being created that were normal and that the situation would develop\n\n19 along those lines. But this lasted only for a brief period. And I have\n\n20 to say that I heard from people working in the crime detection service\n\n21 that not only there, but all the coordinators and all the directors were\n\n22 asked to provide lists of employees in those companies, and then\n\n23 Mr. Todorovic would evaluate from his own viewpoint who was where. And I\n\n24 know that he also detained Mr. Esref Zaimbegovic, who had an MA in\n\n25 economics and who was one of the best businessmen then residing on the\n\nPage 19603\n\n1 territory of the municipality of Bosanski Samac.\n\n2 Q. Mr. Zaric, can you tell us what the ethnicity of Mr. Zaimbegovic\n\n3 was?\n\n4 A. Mr. Zaimbegovic was by ethnicity a Muslim, and I know that before\n\n5 the war he was the president of the municipal committee of the league of\n\n6 reformist forces, which was led at that time by Mr. Ante Markovic. That\n\n7 was his political affiliation.\n\n8 JUDGE MUMBA: Mr. Re.\n\n9 MR. RE: Yes, Your Honour. At line -- sorry, page 49, line 8,\n\n10 Mr. Zaric said that: \"In principle, I did not conceal my dissatisfaction\n\n11 and there was a constant verbal skirmish going on. I felt that people\n\n12 could not be arrested and deprived of their liberty without certain\n\n13 criteria being applied.\" In my submission, it would be appropriate for\n\n14 Mr. Zaric to explain to the Trial Chamber during his examination-in-chief\n\n15 what this certain criteria was. It's a matter which is more appropriate,\n\n16 in my submission, to be dealt with now than in cross-examination, as he\n\n17 has raised it and left it unanswered in his own evidence.\n\n18 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. I think Mr. Zaric can explain that, because\n\n19 that is his evidence.\n\n20 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, you've understood the objection of my learned\n\n22 colleague. Could you explain what you meant by \"criteria,\" the word\n\n23 \"criteria\" that you've mentioned? What did you mean by that?\n\n24 A. What I was able to feel after the very first days, and when I was\n\n25 going to the public security station, I meant what are the criteria which\n\nPage 19604\n\n1 were used in order to detain people, and I got the following information:\n\n2 It is because they were possessing illegal weapons, and this is why they\n\n3 were detained. And their names were on the list of the war plan which\n\n4 belonged to that service, and those people were deployed in some\n\n5 paramilitary units. However, and I do not want to go in depth as to what\n\n6 are the criteria. Mr. Todorovic was establishing those. If I were a man\n\n7 and chief of the public security station and if I were an important man, I\n\n8 don't know if I would apply the same criteria. But I wanted to say:\n\n9 Aside from the fact that they had spoken about it, it was very clear, very\n\n10 soon, and we were able to see that the prisons were full of people who\n\n11 neither had any weapons nor whose names were on those lists. So when I\n\n12 talk about that verbal disagreement, I always -- actually, I meant that,\n\n13 and this is why I'm also mentioning the name of Esref Zaimbegovic, Dragan\n\n14 Delic [Realtime transcript read in error omitted words \"Dragan Delic\"],\n\n15 and others who were brought, according to me, without any reason and what\n\n16 kept in custody for months and months on end in various prisoners and\n\n17 detention centres.\n\n18 MR. LAZAREVIC: Can we just have the name of Dragan Delic. I\n\n19 believe that we all heard this name while Mr. Zaric was giving his\n\n20 testimony, and I haven't seen this in transcript. Because when he was\n\n21 referring to people that according to his position were arrested with no\n\n22 good reason, the name of Esref Zaimbegovic was mentioned but also the name\n\n23 of Dragan Delic.\n\n24 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. That is agreed that it was mentioned. You can\n\n25 proceed.\n\nPage 19605\n\n1 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n2 Q. Mr. Zaric, can you tell us if Mr. Stevan Todorovic allowed anybody\n\n3 to leave the Detention Centre? Did he agree to your plea?\n\n4 A. No, I think that my interventions had a counter-effect. And after\n\n5 those -- or immediately after those interventions, these people for whom I\n\n6 had intervened actually had a worse treatment than before my\n\n7 interventions.\n\n8 Q. Mr. Zaric, in the barracks at Brcko, did you see a witness,\n\n9 Witness N?\n\n10 A. Are you talking about --\n\n11 Q. Do not mention his name, please. I am talking about the witness\n\n12 that I mentioned earlier on.\n\n13 A. Yes, I have seen him.\n\n14 Q. Did you speak to him at that point, or when you saw him then?\n\n15 A. Nothing in particular, only briefly. We had about half an hour,\n\n16 or I had about half an hour to talk to all the detainees whenever I would\n\n17 go to see them.\n\n18 Q. After that brief conversation, did you make any notes?\n\n19 A. I cannot recall at this time.\n\n20 Q. Mr. Zaric, do you know a man - he's a citizen of Bosanski Samac\n\n21 and he's known as Kemal Mehinovic?\n\n22 A. Not very well, but I do know him from sight.\n\n23 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you ever talk to Savo Djurdjevic? He was a police\n\n24 officer on service. And did you ever tell him that somebody was beating\n\n25 up Kemal Mehinovic -- here somebody else should beat Mr. Mehinovic?\n\nPage 19606\n\n1 A. I didn't know that Mr. Mehinovic was in prison up until some\n\n2 documents were disclosed.\n\n3 Q. Please go on.\n\n4 A. I had no idea that Mr. Mehinovic was in prison, and it is only\n\n5 after some documents of the Prosecution were disclosed when I came on my\n\n6 own free will to The Hague. I had not received any communications. I\n\n7 have not seen -- had not seen that man in prison. I had not had any\n\n8 conversations with this man. And I would never have asked anybody to\n\n9 apply any kinds of measures towards him or anybody else. That would be\n\n10 the only detainee that I would have intervened for. So I never, ever\n\n11 intervened for anybody, and I didn't even know that he was in detention.\n\n12 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you ever tell any police officer at the police\n\n13 station in Samac--\n\n14 MR. LAZAREVIC: I apologise, because the transcript was not quite\n\n15 clear. Because here it says: \"So I never, ever intervened for anybody.\"\n\n16 And this would probably cause some misunderstanding, because Mr. Zaric was\n\n17 a couple of minutes ago talking about his interventions made to\n\n18 Mr. Todorovic, to do something about certain detainees to be released from\n\n19 the detention. So just if this can be clarified.\n\n20 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, a few moments ago you talked about Mr. Mehinovic. It\n\n22 was not too clear in the transcript as to what you said regarding\n\n23 Mr. Mehinovic. What did you say, please?\n\n24 A. I said that I never asked any police officer whatsoever to do\n\n25 anything, to apply any measures regarding Mr. Mehinovic, and I did not\n\nPage 19607\n\n1 know that Mr. Mehinovic was in detention in Samac.\n\n2 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you ever ask any police officer in the police\n\n3 station of Bosanski Samac to beat up any detainee detained at the police\n\n4 officer [as interpreted] or to apply force?\n\n5 A. No, never. Quite to the contrary; whenever I had the opportunity,\n\n6 I said the contrary, especially when I was talking to police officers who\n\n7 were not newly arrived and who were not the yes man of Stevan Todorovic\n\n8 and I was always encouraging them to behave correctly towards those men.\n\n9 That's the only thing that they could have ever heard from Simo Zaric\n\n10 whenever I would go and pay a visit to that police station. That is quite\n\n11 rare, actually, even if that's the main reason for my being at the public\n\n12 security station.\n\n13 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you ever use the telephone at the police station of\n\n14 Bosanski Samac to talk to somebody regarding some exchanges?\n\n15 A. Never with anybody on that subject. I did not discuss exchanges\n\n16 with anybody, neither from the public security station and neither from\n\n17 any other place, and everything I said, I maintain.\n\n18 Q. Mr. Zaric, do you know Mrs. Snjezana Delic?\n\n19 A. Yes, I do.\n\n20 Q. How long have you known Mrs. Snjezana Delic from Bosanski Samac?\n\n21 A. Maybe ten years prior to the war. She was a young woman then.\n\n22 Then she was a professor. She was working at the school centre and she\n\n23 was one of the professors, one of the teachers who taught my son Mirel.\n\n24 Q. Mr. Zaric, do you know whose wife she was, who she was married to?\n\n25 A. She was married to Dragan Delic, who was the president of the\n\nPage 19608\n\n1 management board of Mebos. It's a company in Bosanski Samac.\n\n2 Q. Mr. Zaric, do you know Hasan Delic, the father of Dragan Delic and\n\n3 the father-in-law of Snjezana Delic?\n\n4 A. Yes, I do know him very well, Mr. Hasan is of an older\n\n5 generation. He's older than me. But he is a man who, up until his\n\n6 retirement, worked in the public security station, and this is how I knew\n\n7 him. But I also knew him as a member of the Second World War defence --\n\n8 he participated in the Second World War, and I used to see him a lot.\n\n9 Q. Mr. Zaric, what were your -- what was your relationship with him\n\n10 and with the father?\n\n11 A. Well, I would say that the relationship was very friendly.\n\n12 MR. LAZAREVIC: We have some small misunderstanding here in the\n\n13 transcript on page 55, line 9. The question that Mr. Pisarevic posed\n\n14 was: What was your relationship with him? Referring to Hasan Delic,\n\n15 father of Dragan Delic. And then Mr. Zaric replied to that question. So\n\n16 this is -- the way it was recorded here might suggest that about some\n\n17 relation between father and son.\n\n18 JUDGE MUMBA: I don't see that myself.\n\n19 MR. LAZAREVIC: Well, you see, Your Honour, on page 55, line 9,\n\n20 here it says: \"Mr. Zaric --\"\n\n21 JUDGE MUMBA: What was he describing.\n\n22 MR. LAZAREVIC: -- \"What was your relationship with him and with\n\n23 the father\"?\n\n24 JUDGE MUMBA: Was it a relationship between Mr. Zaric and the son,\n\n25 and then the relationship between Mr. Zaric and the father?\n\nPage 19609\n\n1 MR. LAZAREVIC: No, no. He was talking about Mr. Hasan Delic, the\n\n2 father --\n\n3 JUDGE MUMBA: Maybe we can just go over it. Yes. So we come --\n\n4 we deal with it that way.\n\n5 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n6 Q. Mr. Zaric, what was your relationship with Hasan Delic? How would\n\n7 you describe that relationship?\n\n8 A. My relationship with Hasan Delic, Dragan's father, was very\n\n9 correct, even friendly.\n\n10 Q. Thank you. Mr. Zaric, during the war, were you in Dragan's and\n\n11 Snjezana's house?\n\n12 A. Yes, I was on one occasion.\n\n13 Q. How did that come about? How did you find yourself in the Delic's\n\n14 house?\n\n15 A. I'll try to be brief when I explain this, but before I give you my\n\n16 answer, I have to give you one fact. Dragan Delic, Hasan's son and\n\n17 Snjezana's husband, had been arrested. That was in mid-April. I don't\n\n18 know the exact date. And he was brought to the public security station in\n\n19 Bosanski Samac. And I know very well that he was one of the people who\n\n20 were transferred to Brcko with the group who went there. I also know that\n\n21 Dragan Delic then was returned from Bijeljina to the area of Samac. That\n\n22 was again in mid-May. And since our former friendship, Hasan Delic, his\n\n23 father, was very concerned about the lot of his two sons. Dragan was in\n\n24 the prison, and the other son, Hazim, had a work obligation. So I\n\n25 understood him as a parent. He tried to see whether I, on my part, could\n\nPage 19610\n\n1 do something about Dragan, to see whether I could have Dragan released\n\n2 from prison. What I could do through the people who worked in the crime\n\n3 department, I could ask them about the reasons why Dragan had been\n\n4 detained, and I received information from Milos Savic, who told me that\n\n5 Dragan Delic had been charged, together with some people from Mebos, of\n\n6 having abused the funds of that company for illegal arming of Muslims in\n\n7 Bosanski Samac, also that they had formed a work group consisting of\n\n8 accountants who went to Mebos, made an analysis, and decided that the\n\n9 books were cooked.\n\n10 I carelessly --\n\n11 MR. LAZAREVIC: I apologise. Again we have some small\n\n12 misunderstanding. Here on page 57 it says that after this group of\n\n13 bookkeepers or accountants checked the records of Mebos factory, they find\n\n14 out - that is Mr. Zaric said - that it has nothing to do with truth. But\n\n15 here it says: \"And decided that the books were cooked.\"\n\n16 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. I think he can -- Mr. Zaric can give us that\n\n17 again.\n\n18 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n19 Q. Mr. Zaric, please.\n\n20 A. The team of financial experts which went on Milos Savic's\n\n21 instructions - that's my information - checked the allegations and issued\n\n22 a written report and stated that Dragan Delic did not participate in any\n\n23 financial [indiscernible], nor the financial funds had ever been used for\n\n24 illegal arming of Muslims, and this is what I wanted to say. And it is\n\n25 this precise information that I conveyed to Mr. Hasan when I received this\n\nPage 19611\n\n1 information, and that was -- I can't remember exactly when, but it was\n\n2 sometime in June. And I told him that I believed that everything would be\n\n3 all right, because I had heard that Dragan had nothing whatsoever to do\n\n4 with the type of crime that he was charged with.\n\n5 Hasan, as a father, went again to the public security station and\n\n6 said to Mr. Todorovic that he had heard from me, which was a fact, he\n\n7 said: Simo Zaric told me that my son was not guilty, that he didn't do\n\n8 what you say he did. That's why I had problems with Stevo. Stevo told me\n\n9 that I disclosed information to a balija, and I don't want to use any more\n\n10 of the terms that he used. And despite all that, Stevo did not want to\n\n11 release Dragan Delic, against whom there were no grounds whatsoever to\n\n12 keep him in prison.\n\n13 In late June, in the evening, Hasan Delic found me and told me:\n\n14 Simo, I need to talk to you about something important, but can you come to\n\n15 my place when it gets dark? And he also told me: But I won't be in my\n\n16 apartment. Mr. Hasan lived in a different part of the town. I will be in\n\n17 Snjezana's apartment. Dragan Delic had a house in where his wife,\n\n18 Snjezana, resided together with his two children. I said to Hasan that I\n\n19 would be there in the evening, and that's exactly what I did. That's how\n\n20 I visited the Delic family, and I found Hasan, Snjezana, and her two\n\n21 children in that building.\n\n22 Q. What did you talk about, and what did you learn from them?\n\n23 A. I had some bad news from them. The first thing that I learned was\n\n24 from Snjezana, who told me that during that day, Mr. Blagojevic had paid\n\n25 her a visit, that is, Mr. Stojan Blagojevic, and that he was looking for\n\nPage 19612\n\n1 some other women with whom he had an interview, and that he also had an\n\n2 interview with her, and that he was surprised that she did not have a work\n\n3 obligation, and that he also told her that early on the following day she\n\n4 should report to the Tekstilac company, where she would be working. The\n\n5 Tekstilac company was a factory where the production had started, and\n\n6 there was also a restaurant where ladies were cooking meals for the army.\n\n7 Q. Did you then also learn that Mr. Stojan Blagojevic had confiscated\n\n8 Dragan Delic's passenger vehicle?\n\n9 A. Yes. They told me that the vehicle had been confiscated, and they\n\n10 showed me a document about that vehicle. I don't know whether it was a\n\n11 Yugo or a 101, but if I were to see this document, I could remember.\n\n12 Q. It is not important.\n\n13 A. In any case, this vehicle had been confiscated on that day, and it\n\n14 was confiscated by Mr. Stojan Blagojevic, who was accompanied by Mr. Aco\n\n15 Jankovic.\n\n16 Q. And what did you tell Mrs. Snjezana Delic in the presence of her\n\n17 father-in-law, Hasan Delic?\n\n18 A. I told her that, as far as I knew, that the women with young\n\n19 children, and her children were under the age of 10 - I don't know how old\n\n20 they were, but they were young, in any case - that these women could not\n\n21 have a work obligation and that this was the position when it came to the\n\n22 work obligation, and that I would talk to some people from the Ministry of\n\n23 Defence and I would check that. And as far as the vehicle was concerned,\n\n24 I told her that I didn't know anything about that, but the document that\n\n25 she had received, I told her that she should keep it and maybe in the\n\nPage 19613\n\n1 foreseeable future you could be able to either return the car or you could\n\n2 be compensated for the possible damage. That is what I told her in the\n\n3 presence of her father-in-law, Mr. Hasan Delic.\n\n4 Q. So what about her work obligation? Did she have to comply with\n\n5 that obligation?\n\n6 A. No, she did not have that obligation, because she had young\n\n7 children who were very young. And on the following day, I talked to\n\n8 Mr. Milos Bogdanovic about that. He told me then: Simo, I'm leaving the\n\n9 secretariat, but in any case, I can tell you that this is not possible,\n\n10 and Stojan Blagojevic does not have the authority to order anybody to have\n\n11 a work obligation.\n\n12 I asked him to do something vis-a-vis Stojan Blagojevic and tell\n\n13 him that it was not his place to get involved in that. Later on, I heard\n\n14 that Snjezana did not go to that factory and that she did not have a work\n\n15 obligation, so I assume that Mr. Blagojevic did receive a certain\n\n16 instruction to the effect that this was not up to him to order anybody to\n\n17 do work obligation.\n\n18 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, I believe that it is\n\n19 the time for a break.\n\n20 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. We'll take our break and continue at 12.50\n\n21 hours.\n\n22 --- Recess taken at 12.30 p.m.\n\n23 --- On resuming at 12.52 p.m.\n\n24 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes, Mr. Pisarevic.\n\n25 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.\n\nPage 19614\n\n1 Q. Mr. Zaric, do you know the person called Esma Fitozovic from\n\n2 Bosanski Samac?\n\n3 A. Yes, I know her.\n\n4 Q. Did you ever, during 1992, have any sort of conversation with her?\n\n5 A. Not an official one.\n\n6 Q. And did you ever order her to report to the police station in\n\n7 Bosanski Samac every day?\n\n8 A. No, absolutely not.\n\n9 Q. When you went to the police station, did you ever see Mrs. Esma\n\n10 Fitozovic there in the police station?\n\n11 A. Only once in one of the offices of the crime department on the\n\n12 upper floor.\n\n13 Q. When you said that you never had an official conversation with\n\n14 her, what were your private conversations about, when you had an\n\n15 opportunity to talk to her? Just briefly.\n\n16 A. Our conversations were brief. I know Mrs. Esma Fitozovic rather\n\n17 well, and since I had an opportunity to talk to Mr. Milos Savic and\n\n18 Mr. Vlado Sarkanovic and receive information that the members of the\n\n19 police had searched her apartment, and on that occasion they had found\n\n20 over 30 kilogrammes of explosives under her mattress and some other\n\n21 material. That's why she was asked to come for an interview, to the\n\n22 police station. At the moment when we were together in one of those\n\n23 offices, I told her: Esma, how is it possible for you to allow this to\n\n24 take place? How could you sleep on so much explosives?\n\n25 Her reply to me was: Don't ask me anything, Simo. I swear by my\n\nPage 19615\n\n1 children that I don't have an idea what my husband had done. He has fled,\n\n2 and he has abandoned me and my children.\n\n3 And that was the end of all the conversation between me and\n\n4 Mrs. Esma Fitozovic.\n\n5 Q. When she said \"my husband,\" she meant Mr. Alija Fitozovic, who was\n\n6 one of the witnesses before this Honourable Chamber.\n\n7 MR. LAZAREVIC: But there is one more thing in the transcript.\n\n8 Because Mr. Zaric was referring -- it was -- it's all right. It's now\n\n9 been corrected. I'm sorry. No. I apologise again. Here on page 61, on\n\n10 line 14, it says: \"Our conversations were brief.\" And Mr. Zaric was\n\n11 talking in singular about that one and only conversation that he had with\n\n12 her. So this could maybe provoke some misunderstanding.\n\n13 JUDGE MUMBA: But he has explained as to what he discussed with\n\n14 her during -- at the police station. So we can proceed, Mr. Pisarevic.\n\n15 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n16 Q. Mr. Zaric, do you know a citizen of Bosanski Samac, Esref\n\n17 Kapetanovic? Let me remind you. Esref Kapetanovic, also known as major's\n\n18 son [as interpreted]?\n\n19 A. Yes, I do know him. For a brief moment I could not remember who\n\n20 you were talking about, but I do know this lad.\n\n21 Q. Did Mr. Esref Kapetanovic, in May 1992, ask you for some\n\n22 assistance?\n\n23 A. Yes. He came to my apartment and we had a brief conversation in\n\n24 my apartment.\n\n25 Q. What did he want from you? What did he ask you to do?\n\nPage 19616\n\n1 A. He briefly informed me that Jelena Kapetanovic, whose last name\n\n2 was Stanisic at that time, they lived together. He said that she had been\n\n3 isolated, that she was in Crkvina, and he asked me if I could help him and\n\n4 have Jelena released from that isolation.\n\n5 Q. What did you reply to him, Mr. Zaric?\n\n6 A. I told him: I have no authority whatsoever, but my suggestion to\n\n7 him was that he should go to the Red Cross and see if these people could\n\n8 help him, primarily to see why Jelena, being a female, had been isolated.\n\n9 And then he told me: I went to the Red Cross, and their answer to me was\n\n10 rather inconclusive, very ambiguous. And then I said to Mr. Kapetanovic:\n\n11 I'm very sorry, but at this moment, I can't help you with that at all.\n\n12 Q. Thank you. Mr. Zaric, at any point, through the radio\n\n13 communication, did you negotiate about the exchange of some pilots?\n\n14 A. No, no pilots, or anything along these lines. That is absolutely\n\n15 not true.\n\n16 Q. Mr. Zaric, do you know a citizen of Bosanski Samac called Kemal\n\n17 Bobic?\n\n18 A. Yes, I do.\n\n19 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you say to Sejdin [as interpreted], Naser, known as\n\n20 Cakar that he should arrest Kemal Bobic, and he was a police officer at\n\n21 the station in Bosanski Samac?\n\n22 A. No, neither Bobic or anyone else. That's my one and only answer\n\n23 to this question.\n\n24 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you ever have an opportunity to see Kemal Bobic,\n\n25 who had been beaten up and was in the office of Stevan Todorovic?\n\nPage 19617\n\n1 A. No, but I did hear that he was in prison.\n\n2 Q. Mr. Zaric, on the 17th of April, 1992, did you participate in the\n\n3 collection of weapons in the building in which you lived and which was\n\n4 known as number 62?\n\n5 A. No.\n\n6 Q. Mr. Zaric, in Vuk Karadzic Street in Bosanski Samac, did you ever\n\n7 participate in the unloading of weapons from a truck to the house of\n\n8 Mustafa Omeranovic?\n\n9 A. No. That's a lie. My sister and my brother-in-law live there,\n\n10 but this is just a fabrication.\n\n11 Q. Just say yes or no.\n\n12 A. No.\n\n13 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, may we now move into\n\n14 private session, because we will talk about a protected witness.\n\n15 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes.

PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n16 Q. I would like to talk about your family, Mr. Zaric. You have told\n\n17 us so far that on the 16th of April, 1992, in the afternoon hours, that\n\n18 you were in your mother's house in Trnjak and that this is why you were\n\n19 late to the meeting of the municipality, the local commune of Bosanski\n\n20 Samac, and it was the meeting of the coordination body. Tell us, please:\n\n21 Talking about the estate where your mother lives, whose estate was this?\n\n22 A. This estate belonged to my father, and he had -- I had inherited\n\n23 that estate. But through a decision of the court, while my mother was\n\n24 alive, she was to benefit from it, to live on there, and then my sisters\n\n25 too. But while my father was still alive, I was the only male member of\n\nPage 19626\n\n1 the Zaric family, so I inherited the whole estate.\n\n2 Q. Did you take care of that estate?\n\n3 A. Yes, constantly.\n\n4 Q. Did you also take care of your mother?\n\n5 A. Yes, especially I took care of my mother.\n\n6 JUDGE MUMBA: Mr. Pisarevic, I think we've been through this\n\n7 evidence before, and constantly you talk about travelling to go and see\n\n8 his mother and [Microphone not activated] --\n\n9 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, that is partially the\n\n10 fact, because the witness only partially testified on this. But I would\n\n11 like Mr. Zaric to talk to us about the fact as to where his mother was on\n\n12 the 16th, 17th, 18th, and the 19th of April. I believe that this is\n\n13 important and pertinent for the defence of Mr. Zaric.\n\n14 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes, but he can deal with that, but we also have his\n\n15 evidence as to where he, Mr. Zaric, was during those days.\n\n16 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, of course. Thank you.\n\n17 Q. Please tell us: How old was your mother at the time?\n\n18 A. My mother was around 70 years old at the time. She was in her\n\n19 late 70s and she was about to turn 80.\n\n20 Q. Thank you. Did your mom live on that estate in the village of\n\n21 Trnjak in Sava ?\n\n22 MR. LAZAREVIC: [Previous translation continues]... Not quite\n\n23 accurate. \"She was in her late 70s and she was about to turn 80.\" This\n\n"
