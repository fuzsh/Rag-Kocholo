        "text": "The most provocative performance on the Poets' Square this summer (considering that I don't remember so many audiences and interlocutors who wanted to participate in the conversation) was organized by a guest from Zagreb, Dr. Snježana Kordić.\n\nHer research interests include language policy, sociolinguistics, the ideology of linguistic purity, nationalism, the history of the emergence of nations, and in addition, she has researched numerous grammatical topics.\n\nSnježana Kordić arrived at Poets' Square with the book \"Language and Nationalism\", which was published in 2010 by the prestigious Zagreb publishing house \"Dirije\". In the book, identity is exposed as a construction, and culture as inconsistent with the nation\".\n\nTogether with Aleksandar Huto Kon, a translator, poet and humanities researcher from Zagreb, who conducted a conversation with her, Snježana Kordić delighted the audience, both with her expert arguments and charm - this couple was escorted off the Budva square with a standing ovation, even their dissenters.\n\nAnd the conversation about the book \"Language and Nationalism\" began with the question why in Croatia, as soon as someone mentions that there, in Montenegro, Serbia and Bosnia, they speak a common language, they are immediately accused of linguistic unitarism.\n\nWhat exactly is linguistic unitarism, and how does it relate to the term polycentric language?\n\n\"Linguistic unitarism would be if, for example, Montenegrins had to speak Ekavian if someone ordered them to from Belgrade. Or, if they demanded from Croatia that everyone in Bosnia must speak about, August, and the like, or if Croatia from Belgrade demanded that he should not speak Ekavian, but Ijekavian, or that when a person performs in public somewhere, on television, or goes to court, he must not use his variant of the language, but must force himself to speak in that \"official\" language.\n\nThe core of the polycentricity of the language is, therefore, the recognition of those differences and not interfering with the fact that some nation speaks it with its own differences.\n\nAnd as we can see from practice, there is no linguistic unitarism in these areas, it never existed. Why? Because a polycentric language is the opposite of unitarism - as soon as it is said that a language is polycentric, it is precisely asserting that several nations speak that language, with national peculiarities in pronunciation.\n\nThe core of the polycentricity of the language is, therefore, the recognition of those differences and not interfering with the fact that some nation speaks it with its own differences. It can also be said that this language that we all speak here was polycentric from the start - that is, even in the XNUMXth century there were peculiarities of Montenegro in terms of language, and peculiarities of Serbia, and peculiarities of Croatia and Bosnia, that's why all these peculiarities are there today - Montenegro is still completely recognizable as far as language is concerned, and Croatia, and Serbia, and Bosnia, which means that language unitarism never existed, that our common language is polycentric from the very beginning and standardized as such.\n\nMaybe I should mention something else about polycentricity - why are they centers at all? Because each of them can independently publish grammars, dictionaries, independently publish and write spellings, no one from the center has the right to order someone else in that center not to write spelling grammars or not to write in them what is special about their variant. \"\n\nWhat three very ordinary examples would you give to convince a language layman that Montenegrins, Croats, Serbs and Bosnians speak the same language?\n\n\"We don't even have to go beyond linguistics - for example, I come from Croatia and speak a Croatian variant, and we don't need a translator, you all understand me here in Montenegro. If an Italian was sitting here now, you would have to have a translator. Our mutual intelligibility is, therefore, proof that we are talking about a common language.\n\nSo, he doesn't even think about questioning whether there is XNUMX% intelligibility between us or not\n\nMutual intelligibility is the main criterion in linguistics to determine whether it is one language or several different languages. Mutual intelligibility can, of course, be measured, there are tests for it, linguists have been doing this for more than sixty years, and there was a discussion among linguists about what percentage of mutual intelligibility is needed to say that it is a common language.\n\nThey agreed, through various tests and through the years of their implementation, that between 75 and 85 percent mutual intelligibility makes a language common. Now you estimate the mutual intelligibility between us, it is much higher than 85 percent.\n\nAnd what is interesting, let's say, in these countries of ours, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, the question of let's measure mutual intelligibility, and see what it is, whether we are below that percentage or not, is not even raised at all.\n\nSo, there is no thought at all of questioning whether there is XNUMX% intelligibility between us or not. There are, of course, a number of other linguistic criteria - one is the difference in language, versus the sameness in language, and this is also measured on various levels.\n\nCroats, Serbs, Montenegrins, Bosniaks, in that list of one hundred basic words, all words are exactly the same\n\nHere is one dimension of it - in linguistics it is known for various languages ​​that each of them has something called a basic linguistic treasure. A Swedish linguist, Moris Schvadesh, made a list of one hundred words for each language almost a century ago, which shows how, for example, numbers, personal pronouns, nouns like woman, man, dog, fish are expressed in a particular language. ..\n\nAnd he said that 85 percent of the words must be the same out of those hundred or so basic linguistic treasures in order to say that it is the same language. The successors of Moris Švadeš were even more liberal, and lowered that percentage to 75 percent of the basic linguistic treasure.\n\nAnd that basic language treasure, in our case, is one hundred percent the same. Croats, Serbs, Montenegrins, Bosniaks, in that list of one hundred basic words, all the words are exactly the same.\"\n\nCan you say something about the very term language competitiveness that you mention in the book, and what are its cultural and economic consequences?\n\n\"The bigger a language is, the better it does on the international market, the more speakers it has, the more interesting it is for others who don't know it to learn it. The competitiveness of a language is determined by the economic strength of the country where it is spoken, how much it exports, how much it is for interesting for tourists, how many films, music they produce...\n\nIt is also harmful because there is a real conflict between Montenegrins - some are now in favor of introducing these new letters, other Montenegrins are against it\n\nThus, a number of factors affect the \"market value\" of a language. The same applies to language variants - one variant is more competitive than another variant of the same language, which we can easily see in the example of the American variant of English versus the British one, or German versus Austrian.\n\nWhat happened here, in these countries of ours, with the introduction of \"new\", \"separate\" languages, is actually to the detriment of all of us, because we thereby reduced the competitiveness of languages ​​in every sense, economic, cultural, literary.\n\nSo, let's take the most recent example - Montenegro, since I'm already here, and let's start from the introduction of new letters - ś and ź. Introducing letters in Montenegro now, which will be a difference compared to the variants of the same language in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, destroys the prestige and competitiveness of the Montenegrin variant, and what is being done is to the detriment of the Montenegrins themselves.\n\nBecause we no longer live in the XNUMXth century, when most of Europe was illiterate, but literate. Today, in the XXI century, in Montenegro as well as in Europe, people are literate, they speak the language very well, they are educated, they know how to write.\n\nThe language policy that is currently implemented in Montenegro, therefore, is in contradiction with linguistics\n\nTo now reach those educated people who have literature in their language variant, and to introduce new letters to them, is cultural suicide for several reasons. One reason is that, in principle, Montenegrins are now declared illiterate, because they are offered new letters.\n\nWhat have they been doing so far, is it wrong, not good? Parents and previous generations write in one way, and children will now be taught to use new letters in schools. Then, a split is created between Montenegro now, and the complete cultural and literary production in Montenegro until now, because that cultural production of Montenegrin writers, journalists, authors, is suddenly out of date, illiterate, outdated, which is again a shame for Montenegrins.\n\nIt is also harmful because there is a real conflict between Montenegrins - some Montenegrins are now in favor of introducing these new letters, other Montenegrins are against it, so there is a split in society. And it is known in linguistics that the most important goal of any language policy must be to prevent conflicts in society, smooth it out, if it happens to exist.\n\nThe language policy that is currently implemented in Montenegro, therefore, is in contradiction with linguistics, because it is going to create a conflict within society that has not existed until now.\"\n\nYou use the term Serbo-Croatian language, is it not possible to replace that name with Croatian-Serbian language, or, if we want to be very precise, call it Montenegrin-Bosnian-Serbo-Croatian, which would include all peoples who use that language?\n\n\"Of course, it is possible. It is also possible to call the English language American-English - Canadian-Australian - South African and so on, but it is not made that way. It is also possible to call the German language German-Austrian-Swiss, but it is not. Then, French-Canadian - Belgian, so it's not.\n\nNo polycentric language enumerates all the nations that speak that language in its name. It was the same here - why do I even use the name Serbo-Croatian language? Because linguistics didn't start with my generation, this language didn't start with my generation either, but the beginnings of it were in the XNUMXth century, when this language became supra-regional, in linguistics it is said that it became standardized, and in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia.\n\nWe can say that this model of two-part naming, when naming the edges of a language space, is the same as, for example, the Indo-European language\n\nJust then, when linguistics was established as a modern science, in the middle of the XNUMXth century, the name Serbo-Croatian appeared in linguistics for that language. They chose it that way, at that time, as a two-part, and I must mention, it was not chosen by people from these areas, but by Jakov Grimm, a famous German writer, who traveled in these areas, saw that the people certainly called that language, and then he took one name that simply marks the extreme parts of that area where that language spreads.\n\nSo, Serbs and Croats, they are the edges of that area, and the linguistic area also includes what is inside them, namely Montenegro and Bosnia. That's how the two-part name of the language was born, so it was born long before the first Yugoslavia, it was not introduced by people from these areas, and it simply spread in science.\n\nWe can say that this model of two-part naming, when naming the edges of a language space, is the same as, for example, the Indo-European language, and includes not only the languages ​​spoken in India and Europe, but also the languages ​​in between.\n\nLinguist has existed for two hundred years, linguists have inherited that term, and because I am a linguist, I speak Serbian-Croatian. If I wasn't a linguist, I don't know how I would speak.\"\n\nIs national identity even related to language?\n\n\"It is not related to language at all, this idea that a nation must have a separate language is an outdated thing that arose also in the XNUMXth century, when nations, large groups of people, began to exist in the first place. The first nation on the European continent was France, which was created at the end of the XNUMXth century, then Germany, and it was believed that nations are made on the basis of language.\n\nThe last great representative of the idea that the people must match the language was Adolf Hitler\n\nKarl Marx mentioned language as one of the four criteria for the creation of nations, and perhaps this idea has remained alive in these areas for so long, precisely because Marxism ruled here.\n\nHowever, in the XNUMXth century, it was not yet known how nations were formed, because they were still emerging, and in the XNUMXth century, when a large number of nations had already been formed, it was seen that nations were formed arbitrarily, not based on objective and measurable criteria. , and that is why science rejected the idea of ​​equating language and nation already in the middle of the XNUMXth century.\n\nThe last great representative of the idea that the people must match the language was Adolf Hitler. After the fall of Adolf Hitler, that idea was really completely rejected in Europe, because it is seen that it is simply not true - nations exist, regardless of whether they share a common language with another nation.\"\n\nNova the letters cultural suicide\n\n\"The introduction of new letters destroys and reduces the competitiveness of the Montenegrin variant of the language. Because books, newspapers, and all future written production from Montenegro will contain the new letters ś and ź.\n\nWhen in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, they open a book and see these new letters, of course, it makes reading difficult, it diverts from the content to some unnecessary things, so the audience there, who normally have no problems with the common language, will probably have a distance thus.\n\n\"The introduction of new letters to literate, educated people is now in a way cultural suicide\"\n\nThis means that Montenegro, which has about six hundred thousand inhabitants, in principle loses the market for its writers, its authors in Croatia, which has four and a half million inhabitants, Serbia, which has seven million inhabitants, and Bosnia, which has two million, which makes it loser.\n\nIntroducing new letters to literate, educated people is now, in a way, cultural suicide. It is such a harmful act for the Montenegrins themselves.\n\nGallery"
