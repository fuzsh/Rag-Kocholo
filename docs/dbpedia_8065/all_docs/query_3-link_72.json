        "text": "aha,there it is in latin\n\nit is an vatican dokument\"Provinciale Vetus\" in a work betven 1060.-1075\n\nafter the list of ungarian towns(Civitates Ungarie) it lists civitas Dalmatie et Croatie within one metropolis with Solin on its front,it lists the next tovns:\n\n- metropolis civitas Salona (Solin, capital town)\n\n- civitas Jadera (Zadar)\n\n- civitas Scardona (Skradin)\n\n- civitas Tragurium (Trogir)\n\n- civitas Belgradum (Biograd-na-Moru)\n\n- civitas Arbum (Rab)\n\n- civitas Absara (Osor)\n\n- civitas Vecla (Krk)\n\n- civitas Sissia (Sisak)\n\n- civitas Ragusium (Dubrovnik)\n\n- civitas Catara (Kotor)\n\n- civitas Stagnum (Ston)\n\n- civitas Mucrona (Makarska)\n\n- civitas Bosna (Bosna, t.j. Visoko)\n\n- civitas Dulcinium (Ulcinj)\n\n- civitas Suacium (Sva&#269\n\n- civitas Antibarum (Bar)\n\n- civitas Delminia (Duvno)\n\n- civitas Nona (Nin)\n\nbosnia is not the only metropolia inside croatia that vas named by a riverLika,Sana,Vrbas,were all like that,Lika vas even a BANATE just as bosnia\n\nhere another yugoslavian map of all those metropoilas or however u wana call them\n\nno bosnia is not defined,couse of the minimalistic aproach,well Tito basicly invented Bosnia and Hercegovina and the Muslim nation baack in the 70-s he couldt teach it as etnic croatian,but the sources...\n\nnow lets look at what modern history has to say\n\nWOOOW bosnia is tera incognita!!!\n\nisnt it interesting that the most politicly debated teritoy has an fog of war on it???\n\nINTRIGUING HA?\n\nHistoryans are komformists in terms of bosnians etnicity,they dont want to give it to noone so the bosniaki can develope theyr own identity wich is noble but not the apsolute truth\n\nnow u remember that map of the frankisch swords,there are early christian curches in bosnia who are exactly the same as those in dalmatia,you know those with \"tropleter\" and the croatian name in mention,so there is croatian architecture in bosnia\n\ndo u know that sarajevo does not have an agheology college? it is the capital of bosnia and the bigest city 500 000-300 000 habitans now on the other hand we hawe mostar 64 000, and it has an arc. college hercegovina has many founds even mentions of the croatian name, sarajevo finances Semir Osmanagic to dig up an hill in case it is a pyramid same time is states to croats archeologists that it has not enough money for konzervation of all those things they requested,mainly medieval graves,forts etc.\n\nHercegovina is more explored than geograpical bosnia,bosnia is one of the most unexplored regions in europ and they just ignore it and keep diging hills hahahah\n\nSemir Osmanagi? - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia not a real scientist!!\n\nthat document can be read here this is froma an zurich university!\n\nIncertus_098_cps2.\n\nWell first of all Snježana Kordić conclusion is that neither Serbian language or Croatian language exist at all. But that we share one language. Which is false. Its her opinion.\n\nShe got money to wrote that book from Ministry of Culture of Croatia. During time when Serbs were in Ministry of Culture of Croatia.\n\nOne Serb have duty during that time for nothing more than Croatian literacy.\n\nHe said that Ivo Vojnović is Serb not Croat. During that time we have plenty \"serbophile\" ideas.\n\nWhy dont trust Frljić who said that he dont speak Serbian or Croatian but Croatian Serbian?\n\nWhy dont trust Jovan Deretić who said that all IE languages originate from Serbian?\n\nexactly comformistic komunist party filosofy,in my mind,like we are all brothers we are all nonserbs noncroats lets live in one state with belgrade as capital and dinari as valute\n\nThats true. Croatian \"patriots\" claim that Croatia was to Drina river, and to the Albania. Including Pagania, Hum, Travunia, Duklja.\n\nSerbian \"patriots\" claim that those Sclavinia are Serbia.\n\nYugoslavian historians who were not \"patriots\" claim that those sclavinias were mixed. Because of peace.\n\nSome say they were nor Croats or Serbs.\n\nIts debate which historians for decades didnt solved. Neither we here will.\n\nBut we are not nationalists if we discuss it.\n\nIts good for speculation when historians cant say for sure.\n\nGood to know is that most modern historians will give Pagania to Croatia.\n\nTravunia to Serbia. Duklja mixed or totaly different. And Hum mixed. Or to Croatia.\n\nDAI does not speaks of Duklja, it is byzantine at the time...\n\nTravunia is basicly town of Trebinje, it could be mixed, although there are sources of Croat majority there till 17.century...\n\nps. shouldn't we get back to the subject?\n\nWhat happened in early February 1943, to thousands of inhabitants of the municipality of Pljevlja, Priboj, Foca and Cajnice. According to Chetnik report, there was a killing of about 9,200 Muslims, of which about 1,200 men and 8,000 women, the elderly and children.\n\nTranslation from:\n\nhttps://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokolj_muslimana_Sandžaka_i_istočne_Bosne_1943.\n\nIt continues:\n\nThis massacre of civilians was ideologically motivated, and his goal was ethnic homogenization of planed Greater Serbian state space.\n\nIs this link true?\n\nThis is something as Srebrenica before Srebrenica?\n\nI don't know. But I do know of this misconception about Chetniks as being hardcore Orthodox, Muslim-hating, Serbian savages from the mountains.\n\nFirst of all, Chetniks didn't hate Islam. In fact, they saw them as allies as an article written in the paper called \"Istok\" (\"East\") suggests:\n\n\"Muslims create their future position in the new upcoming state by collaborating with Yugoslav army in the Fatherland and by fighting the common enemy they hit the foundation to their standing......Muslims will be equal and even by all laws, will have their civil freedoms, religious freedoms, property freedoms, etc.\"\n\nThis declaration was made by General Dragoljub \"Draza\" Mihailovic to the Muslims across Yugoslavia. The editor of the paper, Mustafa Mulalic, further writes his own two cents on this offer made by Draza:\n\n\"...the only solution for Muslims is by joining the new Serbian federation\".\n\nSecond, not only did Chetniks not hate Muslims, there were plenty of the Muhammedans in the Chetnik movement, for example, Avdi-beg's Flying Chetnik Brigade. So this talk about some \"ideological\" extermination of Muslims is BS if I ever saw one.\n\nThird, Chetnik movement wasn't uniform. There were various branches that worked separately of one another. It was a loose confederation of groups, if anything. The largest and de jure leading, that of gen. Draza Mihailovic was pro-Allies, while some, like that of Kosta Pecanac, collaborated with the Nazis. Kosta Pecanac, by the way, was killed by Mihailovic for this very reason in 1944.\n\nBy the way, I just opened your link and it's completely empty. Mistake?\n\nAs mills first pointed out its NATIONALISM, and that we Croats could also claim that Croatian states, based on sources and archaeology, are :\n\nPannonia, Dalmatia (as all people agree)\n\nI agree.\n\nbut also:\n\nBosnia and Duklja\n\nI disagree. Other than a short ruling period over the area there's not much evidence Croats were ever a majority in the area. DAI describes the border between Serbian and Croatian tribes very well.\n\nLjudevit indentity is not questionable. You see thats exactly what Serbs trying to do. To question everything what is Croatian.\n\nThat's kind of the point of learning. You won't learn anything new if you're stubborn and drunk on nationalism. That said, you do the same as is evident throughout your 'contribution' to this thread.\n\nAre you opsessed with us?\n\nNot at all. I respect my neighbors very much and have no ill feelings towards them. But we're allowed to have misunderstandings every once in a while.\n\nDuring 10 century it was obvious that Pannonia is part of Croatia.\n\nSisak story...Magyars....\n\nYes, it was a part of the Croatian kingdom, not necessarily part of Croatian ethnos. Antun Radic, brother of Stjepan, wrote a very interesting article on the matter.\n\nBut if you are revisionist we can question is Borna Croat or Frank?\n\nI'm a little distraught with you labeling me as 'revisionist'. First of all, there needs to be a common opinion before there can be a revision of it. By the way, my post on Pannonian Croatia was more comical and with an intentional tone of irony. It wasn't a serious question.\n\nOr better is Tesla Croat? There are rumors that something is hidden in Belgrade...\n\nWell, as long as there are rumors there will be conspiracy theories. Him being Croat is certainly among the top ones.\n\n...open thread of Pannonia and start discussion...maybe someone join in it...\n\nI would find it boring...\n\nI'm sure you would. But I have nothing to add in such a topic.\n\nDoes Sclavinias and Pannonia have something with Sandjak?\n\nSerbs do you want to derail thread? ....What are you hiding about Sandjak ...hm\n\nThat's a very clever way to direct the blame. A debate is a two-way street and you've 'contributed' to it as much as I did."
