SCARLETT Johansson has made a rare comment about her short-lived marriage to Ryan Reynolds.

The superstar couple were married for three years - between 2008 and 2011 - although separated a year before their divorce was finalised.

Marvel star Scarlett, 38, touched on the first of her three marriages in a conversation with Gwyneth Paltrow, 50, on her Goop podcast.

Scarlett corrected her friend when she wrongly stated that she had been married twice.

Gwyneth said: "Oh that's right, because I forgot that you were married to Ryan Reynolds!"

She then laughed: "Goals!"

Scarlett said of her and Ryan's brief union: "We weren't married very long, but we were married when I first met you, for Iron Man [2] or whatever."

Revealing she is a fan of the actor, who is the lead star in the hit Deadpool franchise, Gwyneth said: "We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house".

Scarlett then described him as a "good guy."

Following the collapse of her relationship with Ryan, Scarlett married Frenchman Romain Dauriac, 41, in 2014, which again last three years.

The couple had a daughter called Rose, who is now eight.

Then in 2020, Scarlett married former Saturday Night Live writer and comedian Colin Jost with whom she has son Cosmo, one.

Ryan is now happily married to Blake Lively, 35, with whom he tied the knot just a year after divorcing Scarlett.

The couple have kids James, eight, Inez, six, Betty, three, and recently welcomed their fourth child.

As well as an A-list movie star, Ryan is also co-owner of Wrexham AFC with actor pal Rob McElhenney.

The duo have transformed the Welsh club's fortunes and have become local heroes in the mining city.

And they'll be jetting in to watch the team win the Conference, should they beat Boreham Wood tomorrow.
