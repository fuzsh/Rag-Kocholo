Scarlett Johansson Made A Rare Comment About Her Marriage To Ryan Reynolds

Scarlett and Ryan were married from 2008 to 2011.

Scarlett Johansson has been married three times — but you might only be able to name her current husband!

While Scarlett tied the knot with SNL star Colin Jost in 2020, she was actually married twice before that.

She was most recently married to Romain Dauriac from 2014 to 2017, AND she was literally married to Ryan Reynolds for three years before that!!

And if you forgot that Scarlett and Ryan were ever an item, you're not alone.

During an appearance on the Goop podcast, Gwyneth Paltrow incorrectly noted that Scarlett had been married two times — and she had to be corrected.

"Oh, that’s right, because I forgot that you were married to Ryan Reynolds! Goals!" Gwyneth said.

"We weren’t married very long, but we were when I first met you, for Iron Man or whatever," Scarlett explained to Gwyneth.

Continuing her rare comments about Ryan, Scarlett added, "He's a good guy."

Scarlett hasn't often spoken about her very private romance with Ryan, but she did once comment about getting married so young.

"The first time I got married, I was 23 years old. I didn’t really have an understanding of marriage," Scarlett told Vanity Fair in 2019. "Maybe I kind of romanticized it, I think, in a way."

While their marriage may have ended, it does sound like Scarlett and Ryan are still on good terms.
