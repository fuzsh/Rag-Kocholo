        "text": "Scarlett Johansson got candid about how she feels about her first ex-husband, Ryan Reynolds, more than a decade after their divorce.\n\nDuring an appearance on the “Goop” podcast Tuesday, host Gwyneth Paltrow asked the “Marriage Story” actress how many times she had been married, to which she replied, “Three times.”\n\nPaltrow, 50, responded, “Oh, that’s right because I forgot you were married to Ryan Reynolds. Goals.”\n\nJohansson, who was married to the “Deadpool” actor from 2008 to 2010, noted they “weren’t married for very long.”\n\nWhen the “Shakespeare in Love” actress declared, “We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house,” Johansson said, “He’s a good guy.”\n\nThe “Lucy” star, 38, and Reynolds, 46, announced their split in December 2010 following two years of marriage. They finalized their divorce the following July.\n\nThough the duo rarely speaks publicly about their short-lived romance, Johansson briefly touched upon the subject in a 2019 Vanity Fair profile.\n\n“I mean, the first time I got married I was 23 years old,” she said at the time.\n\n“I didn’t really have an understanding of marriage. Maybe I kind of romanticized it, I think, in a way,” she went on.\n\nFollowing their split, the “Avengers” actress wed journalist Romain Dauriac in 2014.\n\nThe exes, who called it quits in 2017, continue to co-parent their 8-year-old daughter, Rose.\n\nJohansson then began dating “Saturday Night Live” funnyman Colin Jost in 2017, and the couple got engaged two years later.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThey tied the knot in a private ceremony at the actress’s home in Palisades, NY, and welcomed their first child together, a son named Cosmo, in 2021.\n\nReynolds, for his part, began dating “Gossip Girl” alum Blake Lively in 2011.\n\nThe following year, the pair tied the knot on a South Carolina plantation — a venue for which they later apologized after backlash."
