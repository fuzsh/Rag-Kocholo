        "text": "Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost have tied the knot.\n\nThe couple were wed in an intimate ceremony over the weekend, according to a post by the Meals on Wheels America Instagram account. Johansson’s rep also confirmed the news to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe program shared the news of the couple’s nuptials, adding Johansson and Jost’s “wedding wish” is for people to support Meals on Wheels America via donations and “help make a difference for vulnerable older adults during this difficult time.”\n\nJohansson and Jost got engaged in May 2019 after dating for two years.\n\nJohansson, 34, was previously married to Ryan Reynolds and journalist Romain Dauriac, with whom she has a daughter named Rose, who was born in 2014. This is the first marriage for the 36-year-old Jost, who is the co-head writer at SNL and co-anchor of “Weekend Update.”"
