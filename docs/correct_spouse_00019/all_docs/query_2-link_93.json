Please consider donating to celebrate the happy couple by clicking the link in our bio.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Black Widow’ co-stars Florence Pugh and Scarlett Johansson talk ‘sisterly bonding’\n\nThe Saturday Night Live star and the Black Widow actor got engaged in May of 2019 after two years of dating.\n\nREAD MORE: Colin Jost tells Ellen DeGeneres he wants ‘Weekend Update’ co-anchor Michael Che to object at his wedding to Scarlett Johansson\n\nTrending Now\n\nJapanese gymnastics captain, 19, out of Olympics for smoking, drinking\n\nKamala Harris’ top picks for VP could also be her strongest competitors\n\nLast October, Johansson gushed about Jost’s proposal on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, “He did [do it in a romantic way], he killed it. It was a very James Bond situation. It was surprising. He’s got a lot behind that [Saturday Night Live] news desk he’s hiding.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“He’s very charming and very thoughtful and romantic,” she added. “I was surprised, even if you imagine what that moment is going to be like, it’s still, it’s a beautiful moment. It was very personal. It was a very special moment and I think more than anything, when someone tells you they want to share the rest of their life with you, it’s a lovely, special thing.”\n\nJost later confirmed to Andy Cohen that their original wedding plans were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“This is also not the time to get all your elderly, at-risk relatives together in one big group,” he said.\n\nJohansson was previously married to Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011 and Romain Dauriac from 2014 to 2017, with whom she shares daughter Rose, 6. This is the first marriage for Jost."
