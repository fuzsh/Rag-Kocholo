        "text": "Article updated on 02/03/22: Scarlett Johansson is an award-winning actress and has starred in some of Hollywood's most revered and successful films including Black Widow, Marriage Story and Lost In Translation.\n\nShe is also a mother to her seven-year-old daughter Rose Dorothy, whom she shares with her ex-husband Romain Dauriac, and newborn son Cosmo, who she welcomed with her current husband Colin Jost last August.\n\nAfter formerly opening about the 'life-changing' experience of motherhood on PEOPLE (The TV Show!), the 37-year-old actor has now discussed being 'so protective' during her pregnancies, as well as rediscovering herself.\n\nSpeaking with Vanity Fair, the Outset founder said: 'Obviously having children is the biggest life-changing thing. I have two children, [and] after having my daughter [Rose], it took me a long time to have that kind of new-beginning feeling.'\n\nShe continued: 'I was so in it in that primary, preoccupied phase, where you're still connected to your baby. And then I went into work pretty quickly after that.\n\n'I always felt like I was trying to keep up and create some sort of work-life balance, which I think is probably a lie.'\n\nReferring to her first-born child, the star went on to say: 'It wasn't until my daughter was more independent of me, probably around two, where I rediscovered myself. I was like, \"What is most important to me in my life?\" I felt like the work that I was doing and the choices that I was making personally should be intentional in a certain kind of way, where I didn't want to feel like life was happening to me. I knew more what I didn't want in my life and in my career.'\n\nSpeaking specifically about her pregnancies, she said: Iâ€™ve been so protective of both pregnancies, not wanting to feel scrutinised in the public eye. I wanted to be able to have my own feelings about my changing body without other people also telling me how they saw me, whether it was positive or negative,' she added.\n\nJohansson highlighted that only during her pregnancy did she realise the true extent to which people judge you. 'Their hopes or their judgment or their desire, a lot of that is put on pregnant women,' she said.\n\nAnd while addressing the 'great' and 'wonderful' comments she would receive while pregnant, Johansson also recalled facing criticism.\n\n'While I was definitely excited to be pregnant in some ways, I also had a lot of not-great feelings about it, and that would be scrutinised by â€” I'm talking about, like, women that were close to me. You expect it from men, but from women, it's like, \"Come on, girl, you've been through it.\"'\n\nRecalling one encounter in particular, she explained: 'One friend, when I told her that I was pregnant â€” she knew I was trying to get pregnant â€” she was just like, \"Oh s***. Great, but not great.\" And I was like, \"You're a true friend.\"'\n\nArticle originally published on 13/12/21: Scarlett Johansson has opened up about her baby Cosmo, four months after she and husband Colin Jost announced his arrival.\n\nLast week the actor appeared on PEOPLE (The TV Show!) and shed light on Cosmo and his current obsession - his feet.\n\n' It's the best,' she revealed. 'I mean, feet, who knew? There they are. Life-changing.'\n\nAccording to the new mum Cosmo will 'stare at them, pull on them, chew on them', noting: 'It's just unbelievable. I mean, can you imagine you never realised you had feet and then you looked down and there they are? You're like, \"Whoa.\"'\n\nJohansson also discussed her seven-year-old daughter Rose Dorothy's excitement over her films. The actor co-parents Rose with her ex-husband, journalist Romain Dauriac.\n\n'I think she's pretty excited about the fact that I'm in Sing 2,' Johansson said of her daughter. 'Although it's probably more abstract to her. Like she just recently figured out how animated movies work because that's kind of a surreal, kind of concept.'\n\nOn August 14, Jost confirmed during a stand-up comedy gig that he his wife of just under a year were expecting a baby, addressing ongoing rumours for the first time.\n\nHowever, just days later, on August 18, the Saturday Night Live cast member clarified that, actually, their baby has already been born.\n\nTaking to Instagram, Jost shared a statement that read: 'Ok, ok, we had a baby... we love him very much' accompanying the image with a caption featuring a hashtag which read #wegotawaywithitforalongtime.\n\nThe comedian also revealed his baby boy's name to be Cosmo, which according to Name Berry is of greek origin and means 'order, beauty'.\n\nContinuing his statement, Jost explained that 'privacy would be greatly appreciated' for the private couple before finishing with a joke, directing all inquiries to their 'publicist' Michael Che - his longstanding SNL cast member and fellow half of the comedy duo that present the parody 'Weekend Update' segment on the sketch show. Since then, Che has joined in on the fun changing his Instagram bio to 'Cosmo's publicist'.\n\nJohansson and Jost married in October in a small, private ceremony in New York State, following their May 2019 engagement which was symbolised with a stunning pear-shaped engagement ring."
