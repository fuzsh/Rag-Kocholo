The Golden Globe nominee and the Saturday Night Live star were first spotted together in May 2017 at an afterparty celebrating the NBC variety show’s season 42 finale. One year later, he called Johansson his “girlfriend” during a “Weekend Update” segment on SNL. By February 2019, Us Weekly broke the news that the couple had moved in together. “Colin is still head over heels for Scarlett,” a source told Us at the time. “He thinks she is incredible, kind, beautiful. He is beyond doting to her and loves showing her off when they’re out. Scarlett loves Colin too, and they are in it for the long haul. … Colin gets a starry-eyed look in his eyes when he talks about her.” Johansson and Jost revealed their engagement in May 2019 after two years of dating. By October 2020, it was announced that the twosome had quietly tied the knot amid the coronavirus pandemic while surrounded by immediate family and loved ones. The couple welcomed their first child, son Cosmo, in summer 2021. (Johansson is also the mother of daughter Rose, whom she shares with ex-husband Romain Dauriac.)

Like, what?!” she told the magazine. “I said I was just going to ignore that.”\n\nCredit: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nOctober 2020\n\nThe couple secretly tied the knot more than a year after announcing their engagement. The news of their nuptials was announced by the Meals on Wheels Instagram account.\n\n“We’re thrilled to break the news that Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost were married over the weekend in an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and love ones, following COVID-19 safety precautions as directed by the CDC,” the statement read. “Their wedding wish is to help make a difference for vulnerable older adults during this difficult time by supporting @mealsonwheelsamerica. Please consider donating to celebrate the happy couple.”\n\nCredit: MTV\n\nMay 2021\n\nThe comedian decided to join in the fun by pulling a prank on the actress as she was being honored with a Generation Award at the 2021 MTV Movie and TV Awards. Jost poured slime on Johansson as she was finishing her speech at the May 2021 event.\n\n\"What the f--k?\" the Black Widow star asked her husband.\n\n\"MTV! You got slimed!\" he responded, shortly before being informed that slime was used during Nickelodeon award shows.\n\nJost did help clean up the accident by offering his wife a towel.\n\nCredit: Anthony Harvey/Shutterstock\n\nAugust 2021\n\nDuring a stand-up set in Ridgefield, Connecticut, the Coming 2 America star revealed that his wife was expecting the couple's first child. “We’re having a baby,\" he said from the stage. \"It’s exciting.” The news came just months after Johansson first sparked pregnancy rumors when she was absent from all in-person press events for Black Widow ahead of the film's July 2021 release. Fans noted that her virtual interviews were all shot as close-ups, hiding everything below her shoulders.\n\nCredit: Amazon/YouTube\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nThe parents starred as themselves in an Amazon Alexa commercial, set to air during Super Bowl LVI. In the clip, Jost and Johansson say it's almost like the smart assistant can read minds, and then they imagine scenarios where Alexa reacts to their thoughts. The blender turns on as Jost bores his wife with details of his tanning plans, and Fleetwood Mac's \"Little Lies\" plays after Johansson assures her husband that love scenes are \"the worst.\" After Alexa outs them as terrible dinner party hosts, they realize it's best that the automated system hasn't achieved telepathy yet.\n\nCredit: Danny Moloshok/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nMarch 2022\n\nWhile reflecting on the beginning of her relationship with the comedian, Johansson revealed that they met multiple times before she took a romantic interest in him. \"He’s a very — I think — a cute guy, but the other times that I was [at SNL], I was in a relationship and I was not [looking],\" she recalled during an interview on The Drew Barrymore Show. \"This time, it was the timing was right. ... I think you have to recognize when it’s not the right person, but sometimes it’s a good person but the timing is off, and it’s important to be open to that too.\"\n\nIt's also a good thing that the pair began dating when they did, as Johansson also joked that she wouldn't have dated her now-husband when they were in high school. \"Personally, my brother had that same haircut, both of my brothers, and I just can’t [do that],\" the Oscar nominee said after looking at a picture of Jost as a teenager. There’s no way. I mean, who decided on that cut as a stylish thing?\"\n\nCredit: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nJohansson revealed during an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show how she and Jost came up with the idea for their son’s moniker. “We just threw a bunch of letters together,” she quipped, referring to the unconventional name. “I just really thought it was charming and our friends liked it.”\n\nWhile the actress and the comedian were fans of Cosmo, Johansson confessed that her mother-in-law wasn’t big on the name when he was first born. “Colin’s mom had a little bit of a harder time with it,” the Sing 2 star said. “She kept suggesting other versions of it for a while. I was like, ‘He’s already here. He’s out. Like, it’s past that time.'”\n\nThe Robot Chicken alum also noted that there is a connection between Cosmo and her daughter Rose’s name: they both have floral roots. “Cosmo is a really sweet little flower that comes in different shades of orange and yellow and stuff like that,” Johansson explained. “That's why my daughter liked it too.”\n\nCredit: MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nApril 2023\n\nThe Her actress opened up about finally finding the traits she needed in a partner with Jost.\n\n\"I didn't know what I wanted or needed from somebody else,\" she said, recalling her past relationships during an appearance on Gwyneth Paltrow's \"Goop\" podcast. “I never realized, 'Oh, it's really important for me, I need to be with a compassionate person. That's a fundamental characteristic that has to be there.' … I think identifying those things was a game-changer for me.”\n\nJohansson added that with the comedian she was \"finally able to step back and actually respect myself enough to know what those [fundamental] things were and be OK with it, you know? That was a life lesson.\"\n\nCredit: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images for Prada)\n\nJune 2023\n\nJohansson revealed the secret to her and Jost’s marriage during an appearance on CBS Mornings.\n\n“I will say, we have such a — we laugh a lot and we communicate with one another and check in,” Johansson said in June 2023. “I’m married to a writer, he’s a comedy writer. He can get, like, very in his head sometimes, he’s sort of introverted. I’m extroverted, and so I think the key for us is just always checking in, just asking at the end of the day, ‘How was your day?'”"
