        "text": "Scarlett Johansson’s love life has always been a topic of interest for fans and media outlets alike. She has had a few high-profile relationships over the years, with her most notable being her marriage to French art collector Romain Dauriac. The couple began dating in 2012, and they got engaged in 2013. They tied the knot in a secret ceremony in 2014 and welcomed their daughter, Rose Dorothy, later that year. However, their marriage did not last, and they announced their separation in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore Dauriac, Johansson was married to actor Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011. She was also in a relationship with actor Sean Penn in 2011, which caused a media frenzy due to their 24-year age difference. The actress is currently married to comedian, and writer Colin Jost, and recently explained why their marriage works.\n\nAlso Read: “It doesn’t seem unreasonable”: Scarlett Johansson Lends Support to Husband Colin Jost Amidst WGA Strike Despite Her Association With $29B MCU\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScarlett Johansson Explains What Keeps Her Marriage Going\n\nDuring a recent episode of Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop podcast, the 38-year-old Black Widow star discussed the lessons she has learned from being in a relationship with her husband, Colin Jost.\n\n“I didn’t know what I wanted or needed from somebody else,” Johansson told Paltrow. “I never realized, ‘Oh, it’s really important for me, I need to be with a compassionate person. That’s a fundamental characteristic that has to be there.’ “\n\nAccording to Scarlett Johansson, it is crucial to identify the fundamental qualities that you require in a partner for a lasting relationship. “For longevity, anyway,” she stated during her conversation on Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop podcast. The actress also revealed that recognizing these essential qualities was pivotal for her, ultimately leading her to find her husband, Colin Jost. Johansson and Jost got married in October 2020.\n\n“And I think that understanding what those fundamental things are that you need in a partner is a must, I think — for longevity, anyway.”\n\nAlso Read: “She was super excited to work with Tom”: Lindsay Lohan Addressed Auditioning for Tom Cruise to Become His Next Wife Alongside Scarlett Johansson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScarlett Johansson Supporting Colin Jost Through WGA Strike\n\nScarlett Johansson’s husband, Colin Jost, is among the writers affected by the ongoing WGA strike. As the situation unfolds, Scarlett Johansson is reportedly experiencing the highest level of anxiety. According to her, Colin Jost is a pragmatic individual who tends to approach stressful situations calmly, making him the least stressed person in their relationship.\n\n“It doesn’t seem unreasonable, what they’re asking for,” Johansson told Variety. “It’d be great to see both sides come to terms without having to have this humongous, potentially devastating impact for people financially and otherwise. I just don’t know why this can’t be figured out. It’s been looming for so many months and even years. How did it get to this point?”\n\nAlthough Scarlett Johansson does not directly connect the ongoing strike with her legal battle against Disney, she perceives the underlying principles to be similar. Both situations seem to prioritize corporate profits over the welfare of individuals. Johansson empathizes with the writers’ cause as a bystander and expresses her solidarity with them.\n\nAlso Read: Scarlett Johansson’s Husband Colin Jost Embarrassed $180M Actress on Live TV for Stealing Asian Roles\n\nAdvertisement"
