        "text": "Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost’s love story is one for the ages. The famous actress and Saturday Night Live writer and performer seemingly hit it off during one of Johansson’s stints on the show, and since then, have proven themselves to be adorable both on and off the red carpet.\n\nAhead, see everything you need to know about Johansson and Jost’s relationship—from their engagement to marriage and family life.\n\nJune 12, 2023: Scarlett shares the secret of her happy marriage.\n\nThe actress opens up about the key to her successful marriage to Jost during a conversation with Gayle King, Tony Dokoupil, and Nate Burleson on CBS Mornings.\n\n“I don’t profess to know anything about that,” Johansson says of the so-called “secret” to a successful marriage. Though, she adds, “We laugh a lot, and we communicate with one another and check in.”\n\n“I’m married to a writer; he’s a comedy writer,” Johansson continues. “He can get, like, very in his head sometimes; he’s sort of introverted. I’m extroverted, and so I think the key for us is just always checking in, just asking at the end of the day, ‘How was your day?’”\n\nMay 23, 2023: They take the Cannes red carpet.\n\nThe two make a sweet joint red-carpet appearance at the 76th Cannes Film Festival, where Johansson looks lovely in a baby-pink Prada gown.\n\nAugust 18, 2021: They welcome their first child.\n\nA month after Johansson’s pregnancy is confirmed, the pair officially announce the birth and name of their first child, Cosmo Jost, via a joint statement shared on the SNL comedian’s Instagram.\n\n“Ok ok we had a baby,” they write, adding that “His name is Cosmo” and “We love him very much.”\n\n“Privacy would be greatly appreciated,” the note continues. “For all inquiries please contact our publicist @chethinks.”\n\nJuly 6, 2021: Scarlett’s pregnancy is confirmed.\n\nPage Six reports that Johansson and Jost are expecting their first child together.\n\n“Scarlett is actually due soon, I know she and Colin are thrilled,” a source tells the outlet. This marks the first child for Jost, and the second for Johansson, who shares a daughter with ex-husband Romain Dauriac.\n\n“Scarlett is pregnant but has been keeping it very quiet,” an additional source shares. “She has been keeping a very low profile.”\n\nOctober 29, 2020: Their secret wedding is confirmed.\n\nNews breaks of the couple’s wedding, an “intimate ceremony” in October, per an Instagram post from Meals on Wheels America.\n\n“We’re thrilled to break the news that Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost were married over the weekend in an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and love ones, following COVID-19 safety precautions as directed by the CDC,” the account writes in the caption. “Their wedding wish is to help make a difference for vulnerable older adults during this difficult time by supporting @mealsonwheelsamerica. Please consider donating to celebrate the happy couple by clicking the link in our bio.”\n\nJanuary 2019: They hit the red carpet for awards season.\n\nThe couple make joint appearances on the red carpet for both the Golden Globes and SAG Awards, where Johansson is a nominee for her roles in Marriage Story and .\n\nDecember 15, 2019: Scarlett gushes over Colin on SNL.\n\nFor a sixth time, Johansson returns as host to Saturday Night Live, marking her first official appearance on the show since getting together with the comedian.\n\nProving just how smitten she is with Jost, the star adorably says during her opening speech, “I just want to say that this place means so much to me. I have so many friends here, and I met the love of my life here.” Meanwhile, Jost looks visibly surprised and moved by her words in the clip.\n\nMay 19, 2019: Their engagement is confirmed.\n\nJohansson’s publicist, Marcel Pariseau, confirms the news of the pair’s engagement to Associated Press.\n\nMonths later, in July, the actress debuts her stunning 11-carat engagement ring at Comic-Con. On The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Johansson says she was “surprised” by the proposal, and adds that Jost is “very charming, very thoughtful and romantic.”\n\nApril 22, 2019: They take the Avengers: Endgame premiere.\n\nAnother year, another Avengers premiere. Jost supports the Black Widow herself at the Los Angeles Convention Center for the world premiere of Johansson’s starring Marvel film, Avengers: Endgame.\n\nSeptember 17, 2018: They debut at the Emmys.\n\nThe actress and SNL comedian hit the red carpet together for the 70th Annual Emmy Awards, where neither can keep their eyes off of one another.\n\nMay 17, 2018: They debut at the Met Gala.\n\nJohansson and Jost hit their first Met Gala red carpet as a couple, looking as though they’d fallen right out of a fairy tale while dressed to the nines for the occasion’s theme: “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.”\n\nApril 23, 2018: They take the Avengers: Infinity War premiere.\n\nJost accompanies Johansson to the Avengers: Infinity War premiere, marking the pair’s official red-carpet debut.\n\nThe following day, Johansson promotes the movie with an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she displays a priceless reaction to a throwback photo of her boyfriend with a beard.\n\nDecember 16, 2017: They make a cameo on Michael Che’s Instagram Story.\n\nJohansson and Jost are seen holding hands while ice-skating in SNL writer Michael Che’s Instagram Story, further confirming their romance to the public.\n\nNovember 30, 2017: They make their official debut.\n\nThe couple attend their first public event together: the 2017 Museum Gala at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where there is PDA aplenty.\n\nLater the same month, a source reveals to People that the couple have also already met each other’s families.\n\nSeptember 17, 2017: Colin gushes over Scarlett at the Emmys.\n\nJost opens up about his new romance with Johansson on the red carpet at the 69th Annual Emmy Awards, telling Entertainment Tonight, “She’s wonderful. She’s working, so otherwise, she’d be here. She’s pretty cool … It’s hard to have a lot of complaints, she’s pretty awesome.”\n\nMay 12, 2017: Their romance is confirmed.\n\nAfter hosting SNL for a fifth time in March 2017, Johansson returns once again in May for a cameo on the show’s season finale. Per multiple Page Six sources, the actress and comedian are later spotted kissing at the show’s afterparty, effectively confirming their new romance.\n\nAn alleged witness reportedly tells the publication, “Scarlett and Colin were making out at the bar at the SNL season finale party … They would make out a bit, then go back to talking. They were at the bar in front of everyone … they made out at least twice.”\n\nCirca 2006 or 2010: They meet and connect through SNL.\n\nJohansson met Jost for the first time in 2010, while filming a sketch he wrote during one of her many appearances on Saturday Night Live, the actress recalls years later to The Hollywood Reporter. “It was some dumb parody that he had written, and he was in there partly directing this segment we had to do,” she revealed to the magazine in 2019. “That’s my first memory of him. He seemed very confident at the time. I don’t know if he felt that way, but in that environment, if you’re not confident as a writer, your stuff just never gets produced.”\n\nMeanwhile, Jost places their first meeting years earlier—in 2006, which marked Johansson’s first time hosting the show. “The first time she hosted [early 2006] was the first year I was a writer on the show,” he said to Entertainment Tonight in 2017. “So, we’ve kind of known each other since then … she’s the best.”"
