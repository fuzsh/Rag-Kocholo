        "text": "S carlett Johansson and Colin Jost have been making headlines for the moment Jost was tricked into roasting his wife during a Saturday Night Live segment 'Joke Swap'.\n\nAnd while Jost's face dropped the moment he saw his wife's name on the teleprompter, we doubt there were any hard feelings considering the duo have shared an adorable 18-years of history.\n\nThe couple first met in 2006. It was Jost's first year as a writer on Saturday Night Live and Johansson was the host.\n\nWatch the video above.\n\nREAD MORE: Adorable advice Taylor Swift gave Travis Kelce before his performance\n\nThe comedian noted in his memoir A Very Punchable Face that his first impression of his future wife was that she had a \"a grace and a smile that I've still never seen in any other human,\" describing her as \"beautiful, smart, sweet, and intimidatingly sophisticated.\"\n\nThat night, Johansson was a part of a sketch that Jost had written, in his memoir he reflected on a particular line he had written for her.\n\n\"The only line I remember from the sketch is when Scarlett's bratty character says, 'This party is literally worse than the Holocaust',\" he said. \"That was my Shakespearean sonnet for the woman I would one day fall in love with.\"\n\nFor years, Jost and Johansson were in and out of each others lives, with the Black Widow actress appearing as host on SNL several times.\n\nModern Family star announces big marriage milestone\n\nBut it wasn't until a 2017 appearance on the show that rumours of a romance between the two began to swirl when a source at the event told Page Six that the duo had been \"making out at the bar\" during the after party.\n\nIn September that same year, Johansson finalised her divorce from French journalist Romain Dauriac – with whom she shares her daughter Rose – and Jost publicly confirmed that he and the actress were now dating.\n\n\"She's pretty cool… it's hard to have a lot of complaints, she's pretty awesome,\" he told ET on the Emmys red carpet. \"I'm very happy. I feel very lucky.\"\n\nThe two weren't shy about their new love, with Jost making references to his \"girlfriend\" in SNL skits and the couple walking several red carpets together including the Avengers: Infinity War premiere and the 2018 Met Gala.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here\n\nBy May 2019, the couples publicist had confirmed to the Associated Press that the two were engaged, with Johansson appearing at a Comic-Con panel a few months later wearing an 11-carat diamond ring that Business Insider estimated to be worth $450,000 (Approx. $671,000 AUD.)\n\nDuring an October 2019 appearance on The Ellen Degeneres Show, Johansson said that Jost \"killed\" his proposal.\n\n\"He's very charming and very thoughtful and romantic. But yeah, I was surprised. Even if you kind of imagine what that moment's gonna be like, it's still a beautiful moment,\" she said.\n\n\"I think, more than anything, when someone tells you they want to spend their life with you, that's a lovely, special thing.\"\n\nBy December, it was her sixth time hosting SNL. In her opening monologue she joked about her and her future husband's careers in the spotlight, \"The show is bad, what are they gonna do, fire my fiancé? Oh no, what will we do without his paycheck?\"\n\nBefore closing out by sharing that the show \"means so much\" to her, \"I have so many friends here, and I met the love of my life here.\"\n\nOn October 29, 2020, the couple made a very unconventional announcement via the Meals On Wheels America Instagram page with a picture of the Staten Island Ferry and the words \"Jost Married\".\n\n\"We're thrilled to break the news that Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost were married over the weekend in an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and loved ones,\" the caption read, adding that their wedding wish was to make a difference through the charity.\n\nBy August 2020, Jost had shared the news that the couple had welcomed a baby boy.\n\n\"Ok ok, we had a baby... His name is Cosmo,\" he wrote in an Instagram post, with a second slide asking for privacy and directing all questions to his \"publicist\" Michael Che.\n\nREAD MORE: Star breaks down in tears during Girls Aloud tribute\n\nJohansson later explained why she and Jost chose to name their son Cosmo during an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show.\n\n\"It just seemed like a refreshing – it's so charming. Our friends all liked it,\" she said, joking that the two \"just threw a bunch of letters together\".\n\nIn late September, Jost revealed on an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers the one part of parenting he was struggling with.\n\n\"I think when you have a decent imagination, it's worse. You don't have rational fears, you have creative fears,\" he said, sharing that his number one fear for Cosmo was \"eagles\".\n\n\"We go for walks, and I'm scanning the horizon. I'm on eagle watch,\" he said. \"And then we go for a walk, and she's got Cosmo in the stroller, and Scarlett puts a little hat on his head that has mouse ears on the hat. And I'm like, 'You're dressing our baby like food.'\"\n\nIn April 2023, Johansson opened up about her relationship with the comedian on an episode of the Goop podcast with Gwyneth Paltrow, sharing why their relationship works so well.\n\n\"I never realised, 'Oh, it's really important for me, I need to be with a compassionate person. That's a fundamental characteristic that has to be there,'\" she said. \"It worked with Colin and I because I was finally able to step back and respect myself enough to know what those [fundamental needs] were.\""
