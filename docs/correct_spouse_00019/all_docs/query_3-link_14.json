        "text": "Just call him Mr. Outset.\n\nColin Jost shared a tongue-in-cheek skincare tutorial on Wednesday, testing out some of his wife Scarlett Johansson’s skincare products in a hilarious new video titled “In the Women’s Bathroom with Colin Jost.”\n\nThe “Saturday Night Live” star, 41, repped his wife’s brand, The Outset, in a blue logo hoodie ($115) in the clip, telling the camera that he was “here in the office building where my wife allegedly works.”\n\nJost said he found himself in a “public women’s bathroom” after the “Black Widow” actress, 39, told him to “show people your skincare routine.”\n\n“I’m going to demonstrate what I believe to be my skincare routine in this random public sink. Every New Yorker’s dream,” he quipped.\n\nWhen it comes to filming a good tutorial, Jost joked that in terms of “pro moves” you “want to find the place that has like, the harshest, worst lighting” and to make sure to “just sort of frame up the paper towel dispenser.”\n\nHe started out by splashing water on his face and using the Outset’s Gentle Micellar Antioxidant Cleanser ($32) before drying off with a wash cloth, adding that “drying my face is a really nice followup to wetting my face.”\n\nThe comedian then moved on to the brand’s Firming Vegan Collagen Prep Serum ($46), saying, “I really smear it so I feel like a real man.”\n\nAs he gets ready to apply the Outset’s Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer ($44) a woman walks into the restroom but assures Jost it’s okay to keep filming.\n\n“Really excited for the moment when she comes out of the bathroom and then needs to wash her hands and I’m like, ‘I’m kind of doing my skincare routine,'” he joked.\n\nJost finishes up with the Smoothing Vitamin C Eye + Expression Lines Cream ($42), sharing that he’s looking “forward to talking to building management after this” when he’s “fully reported” for filming in the ladies’ bathroom.\n\nFor more Page Six Style ..\n\nSee the best celebrity looks of the week in our new series, “Instantly Iconic Style”\n\nBrowse the best fashion and beauty products, according to celebs\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThis isn’t the first time the standup comedian — who married to the “Avengers” actress in 2020 and welcomed a son together in 2021 — has gotten involved with The Outset.\n\nJohansson told InStyle that her husband helped test out all of her products ahead of the line’s launch, sharing “He’s the first partner I’ve ever had that uses an eye cream.”\n\nPerhaps he can share more of his skincare faves soon."
