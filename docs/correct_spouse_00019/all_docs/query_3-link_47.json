        "text": "It's been five years since they were first rumored to be dating, but now Oscar-nominated actor Scarlett Johansson and Saturday Night Live star Colin Jost are officially a married pair. They've known each other — casually, at least — since 2006, but the stars aligned many years after. That being said, their relationship timeline is definitive proof that good things can, in fact, come to those who wait.\n\nIt's pretty safe to assume that Johansson would probably consider herself a \"relationship\" kind of gal. Over the last decade, she's rarely been single for long, which might be one of the reasons (if not the reason) it's taken her and Jost a while to get together.\n\nIn 2005, Jost got his big break when he was hired as a writer for SNL. Shortly thereafter, in January 2006, Johansson made her debut as host on the sketch comedy show. Years later, Jost told Entertainment Tonight that was when he and ScarJo first crossed paths. Alas, he had to wait quite a while to make his move, as she was dating Josh Hartnett at the time. Johansson and Hartnett split in November 2006, but she wasn't single for very long. She was basically in back-to-back serious relationships — two of which led to marriage — from that point on."
