        "text": "Ryan Reynolds, 46, has been happily married to Blake Lively since 2012, with the pair recently welcoming their fourth child.\n\nHowever, this was not his first marriage, having previously tied the knot to Marvel star Scarlett Johansson.\n\nTheir romance kicked off back in 2007, with the pair getting engaged in 2008 thanks to their undeniable chemistry.\n\nLess than five months later, they A-List couple wed in Vancouver and hoped for a happy long future together.\n\nSadly, this did not work out with their busy Hollywood schedules, and they announced their split in 2010 in a joint statement.\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Amanda Holden and Les Dennis' turbulent marriage\n\nAs reported by FandomWire, the Deadpool star spoke out shortly after his painful divorce, sharing his doubts on whether he wanted to marry again.\n\nHe explained: \"Anyone who gets divorced goes through a lot of pain, but you come out of it. I'm not out of it yet, at all.\n\n\"I don’t think I want to get married again…But you always re-evaluate these things.\"\n\nRyan did appear to re-evaluate as he went on to remarry his Gossip Girl star wife Blake in 2012.\n\nThe beloved Hollywood couple went on to have three daughters James, eight, Inez, six, and Betty, three.\n\nEarlier this year, they welcomed their fourth child, whose name or gender hasn't been revealed.\n\nDON'T MISS...\n\nMeghan Markle will ooze glamor at gala by wearing ‘show-stopping’ gown [ROYAL]\n\nAmanda Holden admits end of marriage to Les Dennis 'was my fault' [INSIGHT]\n\nChristine McGuinness ‘channels Pamela Anderson’ in plunging swimsuit on holiday [PICTURES]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Goals!\"\n\nScarlett quickly laughed before reflecting on her previous marriage, quipping: \"We weren’t married very long, but we were when I first met you, for Iron Man [2] or whatever.\"\n\nGwyneth then added: \"We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house.\"\n\nThe Black Widow star laughed and then nodded in agreement, as she said: \"He's a good guy.\"\n\nAnnouncing their split in 2010, the statement read: \"After long and careful consideration on both our parts, we’ve decided to end our marriage.\n\n\"We entered our relationship with love and it’s with love and kindness we leave it. While privacy isn’t expected, it’s certainly appreciated.\""
