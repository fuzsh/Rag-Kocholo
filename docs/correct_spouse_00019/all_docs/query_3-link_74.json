        "text": "Scarlett Johansson isn't feeling too bad for husband Colin Jost over his upcoming work project.\n\nWhile the comedian is on break from his usual post as Weekend Update co-host on Saturday Night Live, it's not exactly summer break for him as he prepares to become a different kind of host for NBC for the upcoming Paris Olympics.\n\nStill, the Fly Me to the Moon actress isn't convinced the gig isn't a vacation disguised as a job.\n\nTo cover the surfing portion of the Olympics, the second time the category has been included in the summer games, Colin will jet off to Teahupo'o, Tahiti, where the competitions will take place starting on July 27.\n\nScarlett, speaking on the Today Show Monday, July 8 with anchor Savannah Guthrie, jokingly wondered about her husband's new role: \"Even I'm like, 'How did you get this gig?' I just want to know.\"\n\nShe further shared: \"When they announced the Paris Olympics he immediately found out that the surf competition [is] in Tahiti which is so cool,\" and noted: \"He loves to surf, we have a place in Montauk, he's always out there surfing.\"\n\n\"Somehow the dream became a reality, and now he's going to be in Tahiti for two weeks,\" she continued, before joking: \"I'm like, 'Poor you.'\"\n\nMORE: Scarlett Johansson's 'shocking' ChatGPT voice 'imitation' claims — inside the star's legal challenge\n\nMORE: Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost's son Cosmo is taking after dad in rare picture of private life\n\nShe went on: \"He's like, 'Poor me I'm going to be all over the place,'\" adding: \"I'm like, are you? I think if you can have a piña colada on air while you're working it's not technically work.\"\n\nIn a press release from NBC sharing the news last month, Colin said: \"I'm honored to get to watch the best surfers in the world compete on one of the heaviest waves imaginable, and to help showcase the rich history of surfing in Tahiti.\"\n\nMORE: Michael Douglas' surprising DNA connection to Scarlett Johansson revealed\n\nHe also joked: \"My Writers' Guild Health Insurance is excited to see what the coral reef does to my back.\"\n\nMORE: Scarlett Johansson showcases never-ending legs in flirty mini dress ahead of special celebration\n\nMolly Solomon, Executive Producer and President of NBC Olympic Productions, also shared: \"Although the setting is a little different than the Weekend Update desk in Studio 8H, Colin, an avid surfer, is going to bring his unique flair to reporting on the competition, athletes, and beautiful surroundings in one of the most breathtaking Olympic venues ever.\""
