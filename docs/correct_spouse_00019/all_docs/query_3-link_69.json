I just want to know,\" Johansson, 39, said during her Monday, July 8 appearance on the Today show to promote her new movie with Channing Tatum, Fly Me to the Moon. Johansson inquired about Jost, 42, secured the new gig after host Savannah Guthrie mentioned the Saturday Night Live comedian is helping NBC Sports cover Olympic surfing competitions from the island of Tahiti, in the South Pacific Ocean.\n\n\"It's even worse of a boondoggle than Paris, which we're already getting away with - he's going to Tahiti to cover surfing. What?\" Guthrie, 52, said.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Is this a job? How is this?' When they announced the Paris Olympics, he immediately found out that they were doing the surf competition in Tahiti, which is so cool,\" Johansson, who has been married to Jost since 2020, said of her husband, \"He loves to surf, we have a place in Montauk, he's always out there surfing.\"\n\n\"Somehow the dream became a reality and now he's going to be in Tahiti for two weeks. I'm like 'poor you,' \" she added, mimicking a tear rolling down her face.\n\nRelated: Colin Jost Tricked into Joking About Wife Scarlett Johansson During SNL's Weekend Update Joke Swap\n\nNBC announced Jost's participation in its surfing coverage on June 26; the sport will make its second appearance ever at the Olympics after it debuted when Tokyo hosted the Summer Olympics in 2011, as the outlet said at the time.
