        "text": "Scarlett Johansson had her first bb with Saturday Night Live head writer and husband Colin Jost back in 2021; but, honestly, their relationship has had *tons* of extremely cute mems, between their intimate wedding to all of their general red carpet cuteness. And frankly, it’s way more fun to stare at a couple making out at the Academy Awards if you know a little about their relationship, which brings us to this comprehensive and surprisingly sweet timeline of ScarJost's (sorry, it’s happening) love story. Come on in, the water’s fine!\n\nJanuary 14, 2006\n\nScarlett hosts SNL and meets Colin for the first time—at least, according to him. “The first time she hosted was the first year I was a writer on the show,” he told Entertainment Tonight. “So we’ve kind of known each other since then.…She’s the best.”\n\nCool, but meanwhile, Scarlett told the Hollywood Reporter that her first memory of Colin was from her third time hosting the show in 2010, when she did a 16 and Pregnant–themed sketch:\n\n“It was some dumb parody that he had written, and he was in there partly directing this segment we had to do. That’s my first memory of him. He seemed very confident at the time. I don’t know if he felt that way, but in that environment, if you’re not confident as a writer, your stuff just never gets produced.”\n\nLol, awk.\n\nMay 20, 2017\n\nScarJo hits SNL again and is seen partying with Colin after wrapping up the night. Page Six reports that the couple was kissing at a bar. OKAY!!!!\n\nSeptember 17, 2017\n\nColin gushes about Scarlett on the red carpet, saying, “She’s pretty cool.…It’s hard to have a lot of complaints, she’s pretty awesome. I’m very happy. I feel very lucky.”\n\nThat same month, Scarlett and her ex-husband Romain Dauriac finalize their divorce.\n\nNovember 30, 2017\n\nScarlett and Colin make their debut as a couple at some swanky party at the Museum of Natural History in New York City.\n\nThat same month, a source tells People, “They’re very much in love. It’s serious. They’re both very respectful of each other’s careers and very supportive. They’re super cute together.”\n\nDecember 16, 2017\n\nScarJo shows up in Michael Che’s Instagram Story holding hands with Colin while ice skating. It’s honestly like something out of a rom-com.\n\nApril 23, 2018\n\nColin joins ScarJo on the red carpet for the premiere of Avengers: Infinity War and they’re spotted kissing:\n\nTruly hope this is a sign of things to come during awards season 2020.\n\nMay 7, 2018\n\nThe couple attends their first Met Gala together, so you KNOW things are getting serious:\n\nSeptember 17, 2018\n\nAnother day, another red carpet. This time ScarJost hits up the Emmy Awards:\n\nApril 23, 2019\n\nColin joins ScarJo for the premiere of Avengers: Endgame, and they manage not to make out all over the place:\n\nMay 19, 2019\n\nColin and ScarJo are engaged! The actress’s publicist confirms as much to the Associated Press, while a source tells People, “Scarlett likes Colin’s sarcasm and wit. They share a love for acerbic humor and outrage at social issues gone bad. They have much in common.”\n\nJuly 22, 2019\n\nScarlett debuts her massive 11-carat diamond ring at Comic Con. Wow, I’m blind:\n\nOctober 18, 2019\n\nScarlett opens up about her engagement on Ellen, saying Colin did a “whole James Bond situation” with his proposal. I have no idea what that means but hopefully a car chase was involved.\n\nDecember 15, 2019\n\nScarlett hosts SNL again and makes a ton of jokes about Colin, saying, “The show is bad, what are they gonna do, fire my fiancé? Oh no, what will we do without his paycheck?”\n\nBut then things get super cute when she says, “I just want to say that this place means so much to me. I have so many friends here and I met the love of my life here. Merry Christmas.”\n\nJanuary 5, 2020\n\nAwards season is officially in full swing, which means Scarlett’s invited to all the shows and Colin tags along as her dutiful plus-one.\n\nHere they are on the Golden Globes red carpet:\n\nJanuary 19, 2020\n\nCheck out Scarlett and Colin being cute at the SAG Awards:\n\nOctober 29, 2020\n\nScarJost officially tied the knot! Scarlett and Colin got married and announced the news through a Meals on Wheels Instagram:\n\nThe Insta reads:\n\n“We’re thrilled to break the news that Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost were married over the weekend in an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and loved ones, following COVID-19 safety precautions as directed by the CDC. Their wedding wish is to help make a difference for vulnerable older adults during this difficult time by supporting @MealsOnWheelsAmerica. Please consider donating to celebrate the happy couple by clicking the link in our bio.”\n\nNo pics of the wedding though, boo-hoo.\n\nApril 21, 2021\n\nStill no wedding pics, but we get the next best thing: Scarlett talking about her and Colin’s wedding! “I think just keeping it intimate and small made it feel intentional,” she says in an interview with People. “We wanted it to feel like it had an intentional intimacy as opposed to being something that felt like we were restricted by all these things.”\n\nThankfully, Scarlett acknowledges that the wedding took place at “such a delicate time” and as such “there was a lot to take into consideration because of all of the CDC guidelines and making sure everybody was comfortable and safe, following all the COVID-19 protocol,” she adds.\n\nJuly 6, 2021\n\nIt’s the moment you’ve been waiting for, y’all—Scarlett is pregnant with her first child with Colin! Yay, babies!\n\nA Page Six source has the intel and says, “Scarlett is actually due soon. I know she and Colin are thrilled.” True to the nature of their relationship, another source says that “Scarlett is pregnant but has been keeping it very quiet. She has been keeping a very low profile.”\n\nThe source adds, “She hasn’t been doing many interviews or events to promote Black Widow, which is surprising since it is a huge Marvel/Disney release and she is both the star and an executive producer,” discussing Scarlett pregnancy speculations concerning her absence from the Black Widow premiere from last month.\n\nNovember 18, 2022\n\nScarlett and Colin leave bb Cosmo at home when they make their first red carpet appearance in over two years (!!) at the 35th Annual American Cinematheque Awards where the actor is the recipient of the evening's American Cinematheque Award.\n\n“I feel very fortunate that I've been able to take this time to really enjoy the early stages of my motherhood with our son,” she tells Entertainment Tonight. “It's been wonderful. I'm in a 'baby bliss bubble.'”\n\nFebruary 6, 2022\n\nThe couple stars in an iconic Super Bowl commercial, where they discover that their Alexa device can read their minds, and, well, you just gotta see for yourself how it all unfolds:\n\nSeptember 26, 2022\n\nDuring an episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show, Scarlett makes the joke that she and Colin “just threw a bunch of letters together” and named their son Cosmo. “It just seemed like a refreshing—it's so charming. Our friends all liked it,” the celeb adds before commenting on the fact that both of her children's names are flowers. “They are both flowers. Not a lot of people make that connection. Cosmo is a really sweet little flower that comes in different shades of orange and yellow.”\n\nApril 18, 2023\n\nWhile speaking with Gwyneth Paltrow on the , Scarlett opens up about her marriage to Colin and reveals that their relationship has been so successful thus far because they, “Move around the world in the same way.”\n\n“I never realized, 'Oh, it's really important for me, I need to be with a compassionate person. That's a fundamental characteristic that has to be there.' It worked with Colin and I because I was finally able to step back and respect myself enough to know what those [wants and needs] were,” she adds.\n\nBRB literally sobbing right about now. Anyway!! We, of course, will be updating this timeline with any new ScarJost developments as they come."
