Please consider donating to celebrate the happy couple by clicking the link in our bio.\"\n\nThe two first announced their engagement in May of 2019 after dating for two years. Johansson has been married twice before: once to Ryan Reynolds in 2008 before splitting in late 2010, and the second in 2014 to French journalist Romain Dauriac, with whom she shares a daughter, Rose Dorothy Dauriac. Johansson and Dauriac ultimately separated in the summer of 2017.\n\nIn July of last year, Jost reportedly joked about his forthcoming marriage to the Avengers actress while speaking at a celiac disease research benefit. \"I'm getting married, and it's such a crazy thing,\" he said, according to Page Six. \"I was so scared of marriage for so long because every time I talked to someone who just got married, or was about to get married, it's like, 'Oh my god, you got to do it ... What could go wrong?'\"\n\nHe continued, \"Then you talk to someone who's been married for five years, and they're like, 'Don't rush into it â¦ you have your whole life ahead of you. Don't have kids. They're the worst.'\"\n\nAs an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news. She also writes on social movements, connecting with activists leading the fight on workers' rights, climate justice, and more. Offline, sheâs probably spending too much time on TikTok, rewatching Emma (the 2020 version, of course), or buying yet another corset.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaaa2Rqf3SFj25mrJuRp7mmwNNmoaigkaPAtLvNZpqopJmjequ70q1kppmip7amsI4%3D"
