        "text": "Marvel star Scarlett Johansson has opened up on marriage to Deadpool's Ryan Reynolds.\n\nSome may forget that the two superhero actors were once married, having wed in 2008. The couple separated two years later with their divorce being finalised in 2011.\n\nAppearing on Gwyneth Paltrow's podcast this week, Johansson made a rare reference to her marriage to Reynolds, after being asked by the host if she'd been married twice.\n\nRelated: Marvel's Scarlett Johansson lines up first major TV role\n\n\"Three times,\" Johansson replied.\n\n\"Oh that's right,\" Paltrow answered. \"I forgot that you were married to Ryan Reynolds. Goals!\"\n\nJohansson then explained: \"We weren't married very long, but we were when I first met you for Iron Man or whatever.\"\n\n\"We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house,\" Paltrow added, with Johansson agreeing: \"He's a good guy.\"\n\nFollowing her divorce from Reynolds, Johansson married French journalist Romain Dauriac in 2014, with whom she shares a daughter. Johansson and Dauriac separated in 2016 and divorced in 2017.\n\nIn October 2020, Johansson married Saturday Night Live writer Colin Jost, with whom she shares a son named Cosmo.\n\nRelated: Marvel stars Scarlett Johansson and Owen Wilson's Netflix rom-com gets scrapped\n\nWhen asked by Paltrow what she's learnt about marriage or long-term relationships over the years, Johansson said her past experiences prepared her for marrying Jost.\n\n\"I think one of the things that I realised is that there are certain fundamental things in your own personality that you need — me, anyway — I needed to share with the other person,\" she explained.\n\n\"I never realised, 'Oh, it's really important for me, I need to be with a compassionate person'. That's a fundamental characteristic that has to be there.\""
