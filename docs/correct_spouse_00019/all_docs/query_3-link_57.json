        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y.-- They’re the couple no one saw coming and the pair who make headlines everywhere they go.\n\n“Saturday Night Live” head writer Colin Jost, 37, popped the question to his girlfriend of two years, actress Scarlett Johansson, 34, in May. The couple, who earned the nickname “ScarJost,” are the last to throw their love affair in the public eye, but media outlets everywhere have documented a fair amount of the couple’s history.\n\nHere’s how the two entertainers found love in the industry.\n\nNOVEMBER 2010: LOVE AT FIRST SKETCH\n\nJohansson hosted “SNL” three times before appearing in a sketch written by Jost in November 2010. The Grymes Hill native wrote a scene that parodied MTV’s “Teen Mom” and “16 and Pregnant.”\n\n“It was some dumb parody that he had written, and he was in there partly directing this segment we had to do,” Johansson told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n“That’s my first memory of him. He seemed very confident at the time. I don’t know if he felt that way, but in that environment, if you’re not confident as a writer, your stuff just never gets produced,” she added.\n\nMARCH 2017: JOHANSSON GETS DIVORCED\n\nAfter Johansson hosted “SNL” for the fifth time on March 11, 2017, People magazine reported that the “Don Jon” actress filed for divorce from her second husband, journalist Romain Dauriac. She was previously married to “Deadpool” actor Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011.\n\nJost was romantically linked to Rashida Jones for “a couple of years” until they broke up in 2016.\n\nMAY 2017: PARTYING IN NYC, ‘SCARJOST’ GETS CLOSER\n\nAccording to Life & Style magazine, Johansson and Jost were set up on a date by “SNL” co-star Kate McKinnon sometime between March and May of 2017. The two were spotted at a New York City cast party for “SNL” after the show.\n\nPage Six reported from “multiple sources” that Jost and Johansson “made out at least twice … at the bar in front of everyone.” E! News reported the couple was keeping things “fun and casual.”\n\nJULY 2017: SPOTTED ON THEIR FIRST DATE\n\nThe couple was spotted by Daily Mail on a date at The Palm restaurant in East Hampton, Long Island, on July 3, 2017. The soon-to-be couple was caught again later that week in Montauk, Long Island, at Ditch Plains Beach with Jost’s brother and sister-in-law.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2017: DODGING DATING QUESTIONS AT THE EMMY’S\n\nJost was flying solo at the Emmys in 2017, where he was asked about his relationship with Johansson by Entertainment Tonight. He said, “She’s wonderful,” but that “she’s working, so otherwise she would be here.”\n\n“She’s pretty cool,” he continued. “It’s hard to have a lot of complaints … she’s pretty awesome.”\n\nIn that interview, Jost also revealed he actually first met Johansson in 2006, when she first hosted “SNL.\" It was during his first year as a writer for the show before he landed the “Weekend Update” gig and became a head writer.\n\nNOVEMBER 2017: MEETING THE FAMILIES, ‘THEY’RE VERY MUCH IN LOVE’\n\nPeople magazine reported that the couple celebrated Johansson’s birthday with an “intimate dinner at 1700 House in the Hamptons.\" A source, identified as Jost’s friends, said the pair met each other’s families and are “very much in love.”\n\nNOVEMBER 2017: ‘SCARJOST’ MAKES FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE\n\n“ScarJost” stepped out for the 2017 American Museum of Natural History Gala on Nov. 20, 2017.\n\nDECEMBER 2017: HOLDING HANDS ON ‘SNL’\n\nSure, closing “SNL” while ice skating at Rockefeller Center was a special moment for comedian Kevin Hart, but America’s eyes were on Jost and Johansson. The couple held hands as they skated across the screen and stood next to each other during the episode’s last bit.\n\nMARCH 2018: ‘SCARJOST’ IS ‘GOING STRONG’\n\nAt this point, Johansson had become a regular at “SNL” after-parties. The couple was reportedly “going strong” yet tabloids tried to spread rumors of toxic behavior, labeling Jost a “party animal.\"\n\nAPRIL 2018: PHOTO OPS AT THE ‘AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR’ PREMIERE\n\nJost was Johansson’s plus one at the “Avengers: Infinity War” premiere in Los Angeles. The couple was still considered “new” in the public spotlight while posing for photos on the red carpet.\n\nMAY 2018: JOST AND JOHANSSON ATTEND MET GALA\n\nJost pulled off some serious “James Bond” vibes at the star-studded 2018 Met Gala, hand in hand with his movie star girlfriend.\n\nJULY 2018: FLIPPING OFF FANS OVER DINNER\n\nIt’s all fun and games until you try to sneak a photo of this A-list couple. Page Six reported that Johansson flipped off a fan taking photos of her and Jost at Shagwong Tavern in Montauk, Long Island.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2018: JOST IS 'CHANGING’\n\nJost’s “Weekend Update\" co-star Michael Che poked fun at him for “changing” since he started dating Johansson.\n\n“You don’t invite me places,” Che said on “Ellen.” \"And when you do, you ditch me.”\n\nHe added that the Staten Island native had “better things to do\" with Johansson than to “come to this dive bar with me and watch a Yankees game.”\n\nSEPTEMBER 2018: JOST HOSTS EMMYS, TAKES JOHANSSON AS HIS DATE\n\nChe and Jost co-hosted the 2018 Emmys, where Johansson and Jost walked the carpet together before Jost’s first hosting gig.\n\nAPRIL 2019: COUPLE OF TWO YEARS GRABS HEADLINES FOR HOLDING HANDS\n\nShortly after attending the “Avengers: End Game” premiere, Johansson and Jost made headlines for holding hands at an “SNL” cast party in New York City. Outlets picked up on the story despite the fact that they had already been together for two years.\n\nMAY 2019: THEY’RE ENGAGED!\n\nJohansson’s publicist Marcel Pariseau told The Associated Press about the engagement, but said there is “no set wedding date.” Talks of marriage already had been circulating for months.\n\nJULY 2019: THE ‘WOW’-WORTHY ENGAGEMENT RING\n\nAn appearance at the San Diego Comic-Con sparked an online frenzy when Johansson rocked her 11-carat engagement ring during an “Avengers” panel.\n\n“Scarlett’s 11-carat, light brown diamond looks to be a spin on two stone shapes, mixing an oval and pear to create an elegant egg shape. We can estimate a ring like this to be priced over $400,000,” Alicia Davis, Shane Co.'s vice president of merchandise, told Page Six Style.\n\nJULY 2019: JOST ‘WAS SCARED OF MARRIAGE’ BEFORE JOHANSSON\n\nLove has certainly altered Jost’s thoughts about the future. Jost performed at a celiac disease research benefit in the Hamptons and decided to talk about his new engagement.\n\n“I’m getting married, and it’s such a crazy thing,” he said. “I was so scared of marriage for so long because every time I talked to someone who just got married, or was about to get married, it’s like, ‘Oh my God, you got to do it … What could go wrong?’ Then you talk to someone who’s been married for five years, and they’re like, ‘Don’t rush into it … you have your whole life ahead of you. Don’t have kids. They’re the worst.’ ”\n\nIn September, Jost performed at the St. George Theatre for a Staten Island Museum benefit comedy show. Johansson wasn’t spotted in the audience, but maybe they’ll have a Staten Island night out before “ScarJost” officially gets hitched."
