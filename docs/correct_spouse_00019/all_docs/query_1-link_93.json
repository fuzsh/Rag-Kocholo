        "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow interviewed Scarlett Johansson this week on the Goop podcast on the occasion of Johansson’s skincare brand The Outset being sold at Paltrow’s wellness company. The main headline that came out of the conversation was Johansson’s kind words about her first husband Ryan Reynolds, who’s currently married to Blake Lively. She called him a “good guy.” Johansson and Reynolds were married in 2008 and announced their separation in December 2010. The divorce was finalized the following July.\n\nPaltrow asked how many times Johansson had been married, to which she replied, “Three times.” And Paltrow responded, “Oh, that’s right because I forgot you were married to Ryan Reynolds. Goals. We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house.” To which Johansson replied, “He’s a good guy.”\n\nThough it’s very nice, it’s a thin quote and not something that would typically generate so many headlines. Johansson explained away the memory lapse by how short the marriage was; they “weren’t married for very long,” she said. But still, it shouldn’t be so easy to forget two superstars were once betrothed. Even Paltrow forgot.\n\nI suppose this was pre-Deadpool and Reynold was more of an up-and-comer who had starred in romantic comedies and one National Lampoon film. Reynolds hadn’t yet burnished his name as America’s sweetheart. And anyway, what’s more universal than taking any excuse to look back and go: “Oh, right! Remember that? Huh!”\n\nJohansson has talked about marriage more generally over the years, especially while promoting her role in Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story. She played a mother of one who, despite her best intentions, falls into a nasty divorce from her husband, played by Adam Driver. In 2019, when she and Colin Jost were engaged, she told Vanity Fair’s Chris Heath that failure in marriage inspired her to do better in her next relationship.\n\n“The idea of building a family, making a family, and having that work, I like that idea. I think that would be wonderful. I’ve always wanted that. I wanted that also in my marriage to my daughter’s father as well. It just wasn’t the right person,” Johansson said in reference to her second husband Romain Dauriac.\n\n“But I like that idea…. I mean, the first time I got married I was 23 years old.” Johansson continued, referring to Reynolds. “I didn’t really have an understanding of marriage. Maybe I kind of romanticized it, I think, in a way. It’s a different part of my life now. I feel like I’m in a place in my life, I feel I’m able to make more active choices. I’m more present, I think, than I’ve been before.”"
