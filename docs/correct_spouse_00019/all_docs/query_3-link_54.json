        "text": "Colin Jost has reportedly confirmed his wife Scarlett Johansson is pregnant with their first child together.\n\nReports surfaced via Page Six in July that the Black Widow star swerved promoting the Disney film in person because she is due ‘very soon’.\n\nAccording to the same publication, the Saturday Night Live star revealed they are expecting a baby are ‘excited’ about the new arrival.\n\nA source revealed that on stage in Connecticut at the weekend, Colin apparently told the audience: ‘We’re having a baby, it’s exciting’.\n\nScarlett is already mum to six-year-old daughter Rose with her ex-husband Romain Dauriac.\n\nShe and her comedian husband tied the knot in a low key wedding in 2020 after three years of dating, which they revealed through a statement from Meals on Wheels America.\n\nThe Marriage Story actress was also previously married to Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011.\n\nColin, who fronts Saturday Night Live’s Weekend Update, dated Parks & Recreation star Rashida Jones for three years until 2016.\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Tonight about getting married in a pandemic, the writer said he didn’t mind not being fully involved with organising.\n\nColin shared: ‘I’m very happy to rely on someone who has a lot better taste and knowledge of things. That’s sort of what I’ve learned in general in my life. I’ve never been like, “Oh, should I wear this shirt?”…I never know, so I always would rather someone else tell me.’\n\nHe added that finding the right partner was more important than the wedding, calling it a ‘way bigger decision’.\n\nMetro.co.uk has reached out to reps for Scarlett and Colin for comment.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Back to the Stage: Matt Willis on his acting return after lockdown ‘put everything out of reach’"
