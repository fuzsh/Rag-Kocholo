        "text": "While we all know Blake Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, for being lucky enough to be Blake Lively's husband (and Deadpool, too, I guess), he was once married to another well-known actress. Back in 2008, Reynolds was married to Scarlett Johansson. Though they called it quits in 2011 and are both happily coupled up with other people, Johansson opened up about why her first marriage didn't work out.\n\nWhile chatting with Vanity Fair, Johansson credited the dissolution of her marriage to Reynolds to how young she was the time. “The first time I got married I was 23 years old. I didn’t really have an understanding of marriage. Maybe I kind of romanticized it, I think, in a way,” Johansson explained.. “It’s a different part of my life now. I feel like I’m in a place in my life, I feel I’m able to make more active choices. I’m more present, I think, than I’ve been before.”\n\nJohansson married French journalist Romain Dauriac in 2014, but they called it quits three years later in 2017. They share a 5-year-old daughter named Rose, as well. Now, though, Johansson is preparing to marry her fiance Colin Jost. The 35-year-old actress explained to Vanity Fair why she feels more prepared to say \"I do\" this time around.\n\n“The idea of building a family, making a family, and having that work, I like that idea. I think that would be wonderful. I’ve always wanted that. I wanted that also in my marriage to my daughter’s father, as well. It just wasn’t the right person. But I like that idea,\" Johansson said.\n\nPhoto: Getty"
