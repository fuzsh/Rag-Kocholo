        "text": "For two superstars, Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost—she, the highest-paid actor for two years in a row, and he, half of Saturday Night Live’s Weekend Update team—are decidedly private about their personal lives. “When I’m not working or promoting something, I try to be as under-the-radar as I can,” Johansson told Arianna Huffington in an Interview magazine feature back in 2011. “The more that people think they know about your personal life, the more difficult it becomes to preserve [the acting].” Still, both have made headlines for their real estate purchases over the years: Johansson has owned homes in Los Angeles, New York City, and the Hamptons, and Jost has owned properties in New York City and the Hamptons as well. When the couple married in October 2020, however, they took their privacy to the next level, keeping the details of their marital home—and their life with son Cosmo—under wraps. Below, we’re taking a look back at some of the pair’s residences.\n\n2003\n\nJohansson had already been acting for nearly a decade when she landed the role of Charlotte in Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation, which catapulted her into superstardom. That same year, she picked up a one-bedroom condo in Hollywood for $372,000. The pad reportedly measured 1,148 square feet and featured hardwood floors and marble countertops throughout, with enviable views of downtown LA and the Griffith Observatory. The actor held onto the spot for about a decade, selling it in 2013 for $470,000.\n\n2007\n\nHer next purchase was a Spanish villa in the coveted Outpost Estates neighborhood of Los Angeles for $7 million. According to reports, the residence was originally built in 1931 but had been substantially restored by the time Johansson snapped it up. There were seven bedrooms and seven bathrooms spread out across 4,352 square feet, with several first-floor rooms opening out onto a shared center atrium. Original tiling, a chef’s kitchen, and a pool added to the appeal of the home, which was ultraprivate and set behind high walls. Johansson ultimately listed the home for $5.1 million a few years later, in 2010, and sold it for $4 million.\n\n2008\n\nThough it wasn’t her first NYC pad, Johansson’s contemporary Sutton Place penthouse was probably her longest-held. (According to reports, she previously owned a Tribeca loft that sold at a loss earlier in 2008.) The Asteroid City star paid $2.1 million for the two-bedroom, two-bathroom place that was, by celebrity standards, relatively modest. The penthouse measured 1,270 square feet, with an additional 500 square feet of sunny terrace. There was an updated kitchen with white marble countertops and a primary suite with an attached private sunroom, massive walk-in closet, and spa-like bathroom. One particularly unique feature of the unit was a wall of glass bricks that separated the second bedroom from the living room. Johansson upgraded the pad and then listed it nearly a decade later—only to have it linger on the market for two years before selling at a loss for $1.87 million in 2022.\n\n2010\n\nTwo years after getting hitched, Johansson and her first husband, Ryan Reynolds, purchased a stunning Los Feliz mansion known as The Wong House for $2.9 million. Built in 1969 by architects Buff & Hensman, the midcentury post-and-beam residence is still considered a significant modernist home. The house featured two bedrooms, three bathrooms, a dining room, a library, a saltwater pool, and an outdoor bath by the primary suite. Though Johansson and Reynolds announced their decision to split that December, they still worked as a team to spin a profit on the property. The couple upgraded the place over the next few years—including the addition of solar panels for more eco-friendly living—before flipping it back onto the market for $3.65 million in early 2012. They ended up selling it for $3.5 million later that year.\n\n2011\n\nMeanwhile, Jost was on the rise over at Saturday Night Live after working behind-the-scenes as writing supervisor for several years. He dropped $1.77 million for a 1,400-square-foot duplex apartment in the West Village, a veritable bachelor pad with standout features. The two-bedroom dwelling, in a 1929 building, featured a wood-burning fireplace, French doors, and lots of exposed brick, with a private courtyard that could be converted into an outdoor screening room. A spiral staircase connected the two floors. Once Jost and Johansson got married and welcomed their son Cosmo in 2021, however, he listed the place for $2.5 million, a slight bump above what he’d paid for it a decade earlier. The unit ultimately sold for $2.32 million in 2022.\n\n2014\n\nJohansson began dating French journalist Romain Dauriac, who would become her second husband, in 2012. Two years later, while engaged, she snapped up a two-story, four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath traditional-style beach house in the Hamptons for $2.2 million. The residence was custom-built in 1999 and measures 3,500 square feet, with pristine pine flooring, clean white walls, and a primary bedroom with its own fireplace and balcony. The three guest bedrooms are all en suite and have their own private balconies as well. A heated swimming pool and deeded access to the ocean are extra perks to the ultraprivate retreat. Johansson still owns this residence.\n\nLater that year, she and Dauriac quietly wed in Montana following the birth of their daughter Rose Dorothy. Together, they picked up a $3.88 million home in Los Feliz, a 3,500-square-foot, two-story mansion set behind a security gate at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac. The dwelling, originally built in the 1940s, comprises four bedrooms, four full and two half bathrooms, and such charming details as a step-down living room with a carved marble mantelpiece, a private balcony off the primary suite with views of the Hollywood sign, and an eight-person spa by the swimming pool. Though Johansson and Duariac’s marriage did not last—their divorce was finalized in 2017—Johansson does still own the property.\n\n2015\n\nJost ventured into the Hamptons real estate market just one year after Johansson did, snapping up an ocean-view house out in Montauk for $2.149 million. The property, set on 1.2 acres, includes a 2,600-square-foot main house with four bedrooms and two bathrooms, living and dining rooms separated by a double-sided floating fireplace, a renovated chef’s kitchen, and a primary suite with its own pantry and wet bar. Jost’s Hamptons haven also has a 180-degree view of the ocean from an expansive back deck with a pool. The SNL star likely still owns this home.\n\n2018\n\nJohansson and Jost, both New York City natives, were already dating by the time the Her actor snapped up a $4 million residence in Palisades, New York, located about 26 miles north of Manhattan. (Other celebrities who also reside in the town, formerly known as Snedens Landing, include Bill Murray, Diane Sawyer, and Björk.) The home, better known as the Ivy House, was designed by Eric Gugler, an American Neoclassicist architect known for creating the Oval Office in the White House for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1933. The aptly named home—it is indeed covered in ivy—overlooks the Hudson River and features a pool and adjacent cabana guest house. Built in 1953, it still retains many period details, including New Orleans–style wrought iron railings on the second-floor balcony, as well as carved mantel fireplaces, built-in shelving, and original wood floors. The couple still maintain this residence, which previously belonged to Hollywood star Brenda Forbes. It’s also where the pair tied the knot in October 2020.\n\n2021\n\nJost and Johansson currently appear to live in a new pad together, though details of their marital home are nearly nonexistent. A few months after the pair secretly wed, Jost joined Ellen DeGeneres as a guest on her talk show, giving fans a small glimpse into the private couple’s new residence. During the interview, Jost noted that his Weekend Update cohost Michael Che hadn’t given the newlyweds a wedding gift yet, but that Che had already proclaimed it to be something that would double as a housewarming gift, leading fans to believe that Jost and Johansson had purchased a new place together."
