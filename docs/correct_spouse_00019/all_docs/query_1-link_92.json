        "text": "Friendly exes! Scarlett Johannson had made a rare, sweet comment about her short-lived marriage to Ryan Reynolds, calling him a \"good guy\".\n\nThe two movie stars were married between 2008 and 2011. The Black Widow star, 38, rarely talks about her former marriage to Ryan, 46 or former husband Romain Dauriac, but on Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop podcast, the mom-of-two briefly mentioned her former love when the host asked about her relationship to marriage.\n\n\"You've been married two times? Three times?\" her Avengers co-star Gwyneth asked Scarlett, who confirmed it was the latter to which Gwyneth then exclaimed: \"Oh that's right! I forgot that you were married to Ryan Reynolds! Goals!\"\n\nAs Scarlett giggled, she quipped: \"We weren't married very long,\" although Gwyneth added: \"It counts. We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house.\"\n\n\"He's a good guy!\" Scarlett shared before revealing that her marriage to Saturday Night Live star Colin Jost works because she realized she needed \"fundamental things\".\n\n\"I didn't know what I wanted or needed from somebody else,\" Scarlett said. \"One of the things I realized was there are certain fundamental things in your own personality, for me, anyway that I had to share with the other person. You have to compromise all the time and sometimes your lives separate and then come back together, but I never realized [before], 'Oh, it's really important for me - I need to be with a compassionate person.'\"\n\nMORE: Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost's property portfolio: from the Hamptons to LA\n\nMORE: Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost's private sanctuary to raise new baby boy\n\n\"That's a fundamental characteristic that has to be there,\" she continued, adding: \"That was a game changer for me.\"\n\nRyan - who is now married to Blake Lively and has four children - wed Scarlett in September 2008 on Vancouver Island.\n\nThey split two years later and divorced in 2011. Scarlett went on to marry French advertising agency owner Romain in 2014 after giving birth to their daughter; they divorced in 2017. The 38-year-old married Colin, 40, October 2020, at their New York home. They welcomed a son in August 2021.\n\nRead more HELLO! US stories here"
