He seemed very confident at the time. I don't know if he felt that way, but in that environment, if you're not confident as a writer, your stuff just never gets produced,\" she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch 11, 2017: Johansson spoofed Ivanka Trump on \"SNL.\"\n\nAppearing in a fragrance sketch titled \"Complicit\" as Ivanka Trump, Johansson hosted \"SNL\" for the fifth time in her career on March 11, 2017.\n\nJust two months before, People magazine reported that Johansson had filed for divorce from her second husband, journalist Romain Dauriac — she was previously married to \"Deadpool\" actor Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011.\n\nAs for Jost, his relationship with \"Parks and Recreation\" actress Rashida Jones had ended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMay 21, 2017: The two reportedly got close at an \"SNL\" cast party.\n\nAccording to Life & Style magazine, Johansson and Jost were set up on a date by \"SNL\" co-star Kate McKinnon sometime between March and May of 2017.\n\nThe two reportedly showed some PDA at the cast party.
