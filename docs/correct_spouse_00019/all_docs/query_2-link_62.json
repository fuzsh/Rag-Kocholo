        "text": "Scarlett Johansson is married to Saturday Night Live cohost Colin Jost. Which means she sometimes has to endure jokes that are either cringe or aimed at her.\n\nDuring her Thursday visit to The Kelly Clarkson Show, Johansson admitted that she “blacked out” during one rendition of the segment, the annual joke swap between Jost and Che.\n\n“We need to go into like, witness protection after that night,” Johansson joked. “Like, I am absolutely terrified we’re gonna be like, targeted. It’s so bad. I black out for that period of the night. I don’t — I actually don’t remember it.”\n\nThe Weekend Update annual joke swap segment is simple: Che and Jost take turns reading jokes written for them by the other man. Che always tries to trick Jost into cold reading offensive jokes, some of which mention Johansson.\n\nIn May, Che made Jost quip about OpenAI’s voice feature stealing Johansson’s voice.\n\n“ChatGPT has released a new voice assistant feature inspired by Scarlett Johansson’s AI character in Her,” Jost said. “Which I’ve never bothered to watch, because without that body, what’s the point of listening?”\n\n“That’s like a tame version,” Johansson said.\n\nClarkson agreed: “It’s Daytime [television], we kept it tame.”\n\nJohansson later described the segment as “brutal,” adding, “I feel like every year it gets worse, it’s just terrible.”\n\nOf the Her joke, she said, “It’s painful. I mean I really do — I actually don’t remember that segment. I fully blacked out.”"
