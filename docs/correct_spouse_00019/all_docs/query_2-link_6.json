        "text": "Colin Jost has never been afraid to crack jokes about his wife Scarlett Johansson – but his most recent one has raised some eyebrows.\n\nDuring his appearance on Saturday Night Live’s Weekend Update segment on May 18 – the season finale – he joked: “ChatGPT has released a new voice assistant feature inspired by Scarlett Johansson’s AI character in Her. Which I’ve never bothered to watch, because without that body, what’s the point of listening.”\n\nThe twist of course was that the lines were fed to him by his mischievous co-host Michael Che as part of an SNL tradition on the last show of the season.\n\nBut the incident he was referencing – a likeness of Johansson’s voice being used in the latest ChatGPT update – was not a joke. The actress recently released a statement in relation to the voice robot, saying she was “shocked, angered and in disbelief that [ChatGPT founder Sam] Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference,” per CBS News.\n\nJohansson has often been vocal in interviews about her experiences of being “objectified” and “hyper-sexualised” early on in her Hollywood career, so it’s no wonder Che knew his joke would land his friend in hot water.\n\nHere’s what we know about Colin Jost.\n\nWhat does Colin Jost do for work?\n\nAccording to his website, Jost, 41, is a writer, performer and author. He is best known for his work on Saturday Night Live’s regular Weekend Update segment, and has been writing for the show behind the scenes since he joined in 2005.\n\nHow did Colin Jost and Scarlett Johansson meet?\n\nPer People, Jost and Johansson first met back in 2006 when she hosted SNL. “The first time she hosted was the first year I was a writer on the show,” Jost told Entertainment Tonight in 2017. “So, we’ve kind of known each other since then … she’s the best.”\n\nHow many children does Scarlett Johansson have?\n\nThe 39-year-old Avengers actress has two children: nine-year-old Rose Dorothy from her relationship with ex-husband Romain Dauriac; and two-year old Cosmo with Jost, per People.\n\nWho else has Scarlett Johansson dated or been married to?\n\nThe Black Widow actress has been married three times. Her ex-husbands include Ryan Reynolds (who is now with Blake Lively) and French journalist Romain Dauriac, per Us Weekly.\n\nShe has also dated a number of fellow celebrities in her lifetime, including Jack Antonoff (famously Taylor Swift’s musical collaborator), Jared Leto, Derek Jeter, and Sean Penn, per the same source."
