        "text": "Scarlett Johansson recently made a rare comment about her ex-husband Ryan Reynolds.\n\nDuring an appearance on the Goop podcast, Gwyneth Paltrow incorrectly noted that Johansson had been married twice — and the actress corrected her.\n\n\"Three times,\" Johansson said.\n\n\"Oh, that's right, because I forgot that you were married to Ryan Reynolds! Goals!\" Paltrow replied.\n\n\"Yes. We weren’t married very long,\" Johansson laughed. \"He's a good guy.\"\n\nPaltrow isn't the only one who forgot the actors were an item in the late 2000s. In our first instalment of our 'I Completely Forgot About' series, we look back at Ryan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson's relationship.\n\nWatch: Our favourite celebrities doing impressions of other celebrities. Post continues after video.\n\nVideo via Mamamia.\n\nScarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds started dating in April 2007.\n\nBoth had recently come out of relationships – Johansson had been dating actor Josh Hartnett, while Reynolds had recently called off his engagement to singer Alanis Morissette after four years together.\n\nDuring their first few months dating, the actors kept their relationship as private as possible.\n\nThough they were occasionally photographed together, they never confirmed they were dating, with both their reps routinely refusing to comment.\n\nHowever, in May 2008, Johansson's rep announced they were engaged.\n\n\"They're both thrilled,\" they told People at the time.\n\nOn September 27, 2008, 23-year-old Johansson and 31-year-old Reynolds married in a private ceremony at a remote wilderness retreat on Vancouver Island in Canada.\n\nOnly a handful of family and friends attended, and no photos have ever been shared from the day.\n\nIn an interview with Glamour the following year, Johansson discussed getting married young.\n\n\"I never really thought about it – it just kind of happened,\" she said.\n\n\"It seemed natural, the right thing to do. It was kind of a celebration of the time.\"\n\nBut both being actors, she later admitted that their work commitments had taken a toll on their relationship.\n\n\"We have no time for dates,\" she told Time Out. \"We work and then go home and – I, anyway – just stare at the wall for a few hours before I go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Like in any profession, it's difficult. You want to make sure you have time to invest in your family. It's a challenge, but it's worth it,\" she added.\n\nBy 2010, the couple were living on opposite sides of the country.\n\nJohansson was living in New York while she starred in A View From the Bridge on Broadway, while Reynolds was filming The Green Lantern (with his future wife Blake Lively) in Los Angeles.\n\n\"We entered our relationship with love and it's with love and kindness we leave it. While privacy isn't expected, it's certainly appreciated.\"\n\nIn the years since their split, Johansson and Reynolds have spoken about their relationship and its demise in more detail than when they were together.\n\nIn April 2011, Johansson spoke to Vogue about their marriage and the little-known details about it.\n\n\"We always kept our story private – how we met, our wedding, everything,\" she said. \"It was about us.\"\n\nSix months later, Reynolds reflected on the pain of divorce.\n\n\"I don’t think I want to get married again,\" he told Details. \"But you always re-evaluate these things. Any kind of crisis can be good. It wakes you up.\"\n\n\"I gotta say, I'm a different person than I was six months ago.\"\n\nJohansson has since said that she believes they didn't work out because they didn't spend enough time together. She also admitted that she was young, and didn't really understand what marriage meant.\n\n\"Relationships are complicated, and being married is a living, breathing process. I think I was not fully aware of the peaks and valleys. I wasn't prepared to hunker down and do the work,\" she told Cosmopolitan.\n\n\"We spent so much time apart. It's very difficult. It's bad,\" she said about their relationship before noting that she doesn’t regret marrying the actor.\n\n\"It seemed like a very romantic thing to do, and it was.\"\n\nThe actress has also spoken often about the difficulty of being romantically involved with someone in her field.\n\n\"Acting is a very strange world to be co-existing in,\" she told Parade in 2015.\n\n\"It’s very volatile. There’s always going to be a more successful person. It’s related to rejection. Because actors, if they’re not having success, connect it directly to unpopularity—to the fact that nobody wants them.\n\n\"[Marriage] takes a lot of work. It takes a man who’s not only confident in the love that you have for one another but confident in what he has going on in his own career. He has to be in a field that’s completely different from yours.\"\n\nSince their relationship ended, Johansson has married twice more.\n\nShe was married to French journalist Romain Dauriac from 2012 to 2017, and welcomed a daughter with him named Rose. She's now married to Saturday Night Live co-head writer, Colin Jost, and they also have a son.\n\nWhile Reynolds has since married his Green Lantern co-star Blake Lively in 2012 and welcomed three daughters, James, Inez, and Betty.\n\nFeature image: Getty.\n\nLove watching TV and movies?
