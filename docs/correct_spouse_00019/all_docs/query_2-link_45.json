        "text": "I have to confess that I, like Gwyneth Paltrow, had completely forgotten that Scarlett Johansson was once married to Ryan Reynolds. Perhaps that’s because, vibe-wise, Reynolds and Johansson’s current husband, Colin Jost, are basically carbon copies. Perhaps it’s simply because Johansson so rarely comments on the marriage, which was her first.\n\nAs a guest on Paltrow’s Goop podcast, Johansson answered that she’d been married three times. “Oh, that’s right because I forgot you were married to Ryan Reynolds,” replied Paltrow. “Goals!” Laughing, Johansson said, ”We weren’t married very long,” but added they were together when Johansson and Paltrow first met for Iron Man. Said Paltrow, “We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house.” Johansson replied, “He’s a good guy.”\n\nReynolds and Johansson were married for three years from 2008 to 2011, and the few times either actor discusses the marriage or the reason for the divorce, they always keep it classy. “The logistics of being with another actor are challenging. There has to be a real understanding of how you share your time, especially when two people’s careers are going at the same rate,” Johansson told Cosmopolitan in 2016. “Or even if one person is more successful than the other, that also proves challenging. There may be a competitive thing.”\n\nAlso reflecting on the relationship, Reynolds once said, per InStyle, “Departing a relationship and still maintaining the idea that this is still the same person I married is a great luxury that I experienced. Thankfully I was in a relationship where two people chose to remain on the high road in every regard.”\n\nIf only every divorce could be as chill as Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds’s."
