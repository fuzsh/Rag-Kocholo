        "text": "What once was. Ryan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson were briefly married before they ultimately found the loves of their lives.\n\nThe Marvel actors began their romance in 2007 after they both got out of serious relationships. Reynolds was engaged to Alanis Morissetteâ whom he had been dating since 2002 â but the duo mutually called off their wedding in 2007. Johansson, for her part, had split from her Black Dahlia costar Josh Hartnett after a year of dating.\n\nThe Black Widow actressâ romance with Reynolds started to heat up and one year later, the pair were engaged. In September 2008, they walked down the aisle in a remote wilderness retreat in Vancouver Island, Canada.\n\nTwo years after their private nuptials, the Deadpool star and Johansson announced they had called it quits.\n\nâAfter long and careful consideration on both our parts, weâve decided to end our marriage,â the twosome said in a statement obtained by Us Weekly in December 2010. âWe entered our relationship with love and itâs with love and kindness we leave it. While privacy isnât expected, itâs certainly appreciated.â\n\nFollowing their divorce, Reynolds moved on with Blake Lively and the duo tied the knot in 2017. They welcomed their four children, daughters James, Inez and Betty and a fourth child in 2014, 2016, 2019 and 2023, respectively.\n\nJohansson, for her part, went on to marry Romain Dauriac in 2014 but the twosome divorced three years later. The exes share daughter Rose, who was born in 2014. The Oscar nominee later moved on with Colin Jost in 2017 and the couple wed after three years of dating. In August 2021, Johannsson and the Saturday Night Live star welcomed their son, Cosmo.\n\nNearly a decade after her split from Reynolds, the Avengers actress opened up about their marriage in a 2019 profile with Vanity Fair.\n\nâI mean, the first time I got married I was 23 years old,â she recalled to the outlet at the time. âI didnât really have an understanding of marriage. Maybe I kind of romanticized it, I think, in a way. Itâs a different part of my life now.â\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nFour years later, Johansson made another rare comment about her first ex-husband while chatting with Gwyneth Paltrow, who forgot that the pair were previously married. The Lost in Translation actress noted that she and the Red Notice actor âwerenât married very longâ and he was âa good guy.â\n\nKeep scrolling to see Johansson and Reynoldsâ relationship timeline:\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKSt0aWcraxdn7yprc2sqqimXZa7pXnRspinZaKaxq%2B7y52qZqyYmnq4rdhmq6GdqWLEpr7EaA%3D%3D"
