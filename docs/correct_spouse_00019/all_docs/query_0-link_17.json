        "text": "Ryan Reynolds, 46, and Blake Lively, 36, are the epitome of couple goals, and make us truly believe in soulmates. Therefore, it’s hard to imagine that the Deadpool actor was married to someone else before tying the knot with the former Gossip Girl actress, with whom he shares daughters James, 8, Inez, 7, Betty, 4, and a fourth whose name has not yet been revealed. Sources close to the couple confirmed in February 2023 that they had welcomed their fourth daughter, but no other details are currently known.\n\nPrior to marrying the Age of Adaline actress in 2012, the Spirited actor was famously engaged to Alanis Morissette from 2004 to 2007, and then got married to Scarlett Johansson in 2008, only for them to divorce in 2011. The internet has always wondered what really went on between Reynolds and Johansson as the two never really spoke about their marriage after they released a joint statement in 2010 to tell fans that they would be divorcing.\n\n“After long and careful consideration on both our parts, we’ve decided to end our marriage,” their joint statement read at the time. “We entered our relationship with love and it’s with love and kindness we leave it. While privacy isn’t expected, it’s certainly appreciated.”\n\nScarlett Johansson Talks About Her Marriage To Ryan Reynolds\n\nThe Asteroid City actress, 38, briefly reflected on her marriage to Reynolds on Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop podcast after Paltrow said that she actually forgot the two were even married. \"Oh that's right! I forgot that you were married to Ryan Reynolds! Goals!\" Paltrow exclaimed on the podcast. \"Yes, we weren't married very long,\" Johansson confirmed, to which Paltrow said, \"It still counts!\"\n\n\"We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our home,\" Paltrow continued, which Johansson laughed at, and then added: \"He's a good guy!\" Seems like there are no hard feelings between the exes then!\n\nThe Black Widow star has since been married twice since divorcing the Free Guy actor – she was married to French journalist Romain Dauriac between 2014 and 2017 and they share eight-year-old daughter, Rose. She has been married to Saturday Night Live comedian Colin Jost since 2020, and they announced the birth of their son, Cosmo, in 2021.\n\nWhy Did Scarlett Johansson And Ryan Reynolds Get Divorced?\n\nAlso in the podcast, the Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona actress talked about Jost and the reasons she thinks their marriage works when her previous two didn’t. Although she didn’t directly say it, fans think that she is suggesting that her marriage to Reynolds didn’t quite work out because she wasn’t in the mature stage of her life that she is in now. (FYI, She was just 23 years old when they tied the knot, and he was 31.)\n\nJohansson also said that compassion is a \"fundamental characteristic,\" which could suggest that it was missing in her first two marriages. \"I didn't know what I wanted or needed from somebody else,\" the Sing actress told Paltrow. \"I never realized 'Oh, it's really important for me, I need to be with a compassionate person.' That's a fundamental characteristic that has to be there.\"\n\nJohansson also briefly reflected on her past marriages in a 2019 interview with Vanity Fair, which might also give fans an insight into why she and Reynolds and even Dauriac got divorced, saying: \"The first time I got married I was 23 years old. I didn’t really have an understanding of marriage. Maybe I kind of romanticized it, I think, in a way. It’s a different part of my life now. I feel like I’m in a place in my life, I feel I’m able to make more active choices. I’m more present, I think, than I’ve been before.\""
