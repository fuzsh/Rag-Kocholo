        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost have tied the knot a year after engagement.\n\nMeals on Wheels America announced Thursday on Instagram that Johansson and Jost married over the weekend in an intimate ceremony. The couple encouraged support for the food-delivery charity as their “wedding wish.”\n\nThe post said the couple’s wedding followed the COVID-19 safety precautions as “directed by the CDC.”\n\nThe actress and “Saturday Night Live” star got engaged in 2019 after dating two years.\n\nJohansson, 34, was previously married to actor Ryan Reynolds and journalist Romain Dauriac. She and Dauriac share a daughter named Rose, who was born in 2014.\n\nThis is the first marriage for the 38-year-old Jost, who is the co-anchor of “SNL’s” Weekend Update. Jost performed on the most recent episode, which was hosted by Adele."
