        "text": "“I remember her being beautiful, smart, sweet, and intimidatingly sophisticated,” Jost said of his first impression of his future fiancée in his recently published memoir. “And she had a grace and a smile that I’ve still never seen in any other human.”\n\nBut their connection was strictly platonic at the time, as Johansson soon started dating actor Ryan Reynolds, whom she would later marry before the two divorced in July 2011.\n\nAfter the “Avengers Endgame” star remarried and then divorced her second husband, Romain Duriac, with whom she shares her 5-year-old daughter Rose, she returned to “SNL” to host once again and sparked a romance with Jost.\n\nThe two kept their relationship private for a short time before making their public debut as a couple in November 2017. Two years later, Jost popped the question with an 11-carat diamond, which Johansson flashed for the first time during a San Diego Comic-Con 2019 panel.\n\nJohansson said Jost “killed it” in his proposal, which she said came as a surprise.\n\n“He’s very charming and very thoughtful and romantic. But yeah, I was surprised,” she explained, calling his approach a “a whole James Bond situation.” “Even if you kind of imagine what that moment’s gonna be like, it’s still a beautiful moment ... I think more than anything, when someone tells you they want to share the rest of their life with you, it’s a lovely, special thing.”\n\nJohansson and Jost reunited on the “SNL” stage last year, with the Oscar nominee declaring she had met the “love of my life” on the program.\n\nAnd as for their wedding ceremony, the real question is whether Jost’s “Weekend Update” co-anchor, Michael Che, had any objections."
