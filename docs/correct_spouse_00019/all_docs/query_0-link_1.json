        "text": "Scarlett Johansson had a good, friendly laugh while talking about her marriage to Ryan Reynolds in a new interview with Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nThe Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona star was a guest on Paltrow's this week, and during the talk opened up about her past relationships, including her first two marriages.\n\n\"You've been married two times? Three times?\" Paltrow asked Johansson, who confirmed it is the latter.\n\n\"Oh that's right! I forgot that you were married to Ryan Reynolds! Goals!\" Paltrow excitedly said.\n\nAt that, Johansson giggled. \"Yes! We weren't married very long,\" she said, before Paltrow chimed in, \"It still counts!\"\n\n\"We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our home,\" Paltrow continued, making Johansson laugh again.\n\n\"He's a good guy!\" Johansson finally said, wrapping up the conversation on her famous ex.\n\nJohansson was married to Reynolds from 2008 to 2011. She was just 23 and he was 31 when they tied the knot. After their split, the actress moved on with French journalist Romain Dauriac; they were married from 2014 to 2017 and welcomed daughter Rose Dorothy Dauriac (now eight). (Reynolds married Gossip Girl alum Blake Lively in 2012, and they now have four children.) In 2020, Johansson married Saturday Night Live comedian Colin Jost, and a year later, they welcomed son Cosmo Jost (now one).\n\nIn her talk with Paltrow, Johansson spoke about how her past relationships helped her realize what she truly needs from a relationship, and eventually led her to find Jost.\n\n\"I didn't know what I wanted or needed from somebody else,\" she said. \"I never realized, 'Oh, it's really important for meâ€”I need to be with a compassionate person. That's a fundamental characteristic that has to be there.'\""
