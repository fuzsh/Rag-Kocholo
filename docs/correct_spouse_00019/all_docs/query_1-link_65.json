        "text": "Scarlett Johansson has some kind words for her ex-husband Ryan Reynolds. Johansson, 38, reflected in a new interview with Gwyneth Paltrow on the three times she’s been married. Though the Goop founder completely forgot the Lost In Translation star was married to Reynolds, 36, she added, “Goals!”\n\nJohansson laughed at Gwyneth’s reaction and noted that her three-year marriage to Reynolds wasn’t “very long, but we were married when I first met you.” Despite their divorce, it doesn’t seem that Johansson holds any ill will toward Reynolds, who’s now married with three kids to Blake Lively. When Paltrow gushed, “We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house,” Johansson replied, “He’s a good guy.”\n\nRELATED: Scarlett Johansson Is ‘Too Fragile’ To Be On Social Media\n\nAfter Johansson’s divorce from Reynolds, she married journalist Romain Dauriac from 2014 to 2017 (another three-year marriage). The couple share daughter, Rose, 8. Johansson then got together with Saturday Night Live‘s Colin Jost, whom she’d known for a decade. They got married in 2020 and welcomed their son, Cosmo, in August 2021.\n\nFundamentals of a Relationship\n\nIn her new interview, the actress reflected on what she’s learned from her past marriages and how they’ve positively impacted her current one. “I would never have probably been ready for a relationship like the one that I have with Colin at different times in my life,” she said. “Because I wasn’t comfortable setting my own boundaries. I didn’t know not only what I wanted, but what I needed from somebody else.”\n\nShe has come to learn “that there are certain fundamental things in your own personality that you need” from a partner. “It’s hard to be in a relationship anyway because you have to compromise all the time and sometimes your lives separate. And they come back together and blah blah blah,” she continued. Scarlett never realized that what she needed was a compassionate partner for her relationship to last. “That’s a fundamental characteristic that has to be there.”\n\nListing normal relationship struggles like disagreements and work, Scarlett says that identifying those things are “a game changer” for her. “You get wrapped up in things that are shiny and attractive in somebody. Whatever that could be, they’re sexy or passionate — in different kinds of ways that are really appealing.” She adds that examining those fundamental characteristics might not be exactly “the sexiest thing to do,” but it’s what worked for her and Colin. “I was finally able to step back and actually respect myself enough to know what those things were and be OK with it.”\n\nThese Celebrities Share The Same Ex\n\nHollywood can be a small dating pool. Celebrities hook up with each other in their same social circles. And there is no shortage of Hollywood divorces. The dating world of the rich and the famous is small for those who are in it. As a result, there are many celebrities who share the same lovers.\n\nTake a look below at which celebrities have been with the same person:\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
