        "text": "Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost are now husband and wife.\n\nThe Instagram account for Meals on Wheels America announced that the pair tied the knot over the weekend in an intimate ceremony. Neither Johansson or Jost, who appeared on Adele‘s episode of Saturday Night Live last weekend, have commented on the news.\n\n“We’re thrilled to break the news that Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost were married over the weekend in an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and love ones, following COVID-19 safety precautions as directed by the CDC. Their wedding wish is to help make a difference for vulnerable older adults during this difficult time by supporting @mealsonwheelsamerica. Please consider donating to celebrate the happy couple by clicking the link in our bio,” the organisation wrote on Instagram.\n\nIn lieu of a photo of the newlyweds, Meals on Wheels shared an image of the Staten Island Ferry with the words ‘Jost Married’ written over it.\n\nTheir nuptials arrive more than a year after the couple got engaged in May 2019, following two years of dating.\n\nThey were first linked back in November 2017 after meeting on SNL, where Jost serves as co-head writer and “Weekend Update” co-host. Johansson made her romance with Jost very public while hosting SNL for the sixth time last December.\n\nDuring her opening monologue she said, “I just want to say that this place means so much to me. I have so many friends here and I met the love of my life here. Merry Christmas,” before sharing a kiss with her fiancé. Earlier this year, Jost accompanied Johansson on the awards circuit for her performances in both Marriage Story and Jojo Rabbit.\n\nLike many engaged couples, the COVID-19 pandemic postponed their nuptials. In July, Jost played coy on SiriusXM’s Andy Cohen Live about when they would wed.\n\n“We don’t know what’s even legally allowed, right? This is also not the time to get all your elderly, at-risk relatives together in one big group,” he said, per Entertainment Tonight.\n\nThis is the first marriage for Jost and third for Johansson. She was previously married to Ryan Reynolds (2008-2010) and Romain Dauriac (2014-2017). She has a daughter, six-year-old Rose, with Dauriac."
