        "text": "Ryan Reynolds went through a tough time when he divorced Scarlett Johansson in 2011. At that point, he didn’t want to marry again. But meeting Blake Lively changed everything. She helped heal his heart and made him believe in love once more.\n\nReynolds was deeply affected by the divorce.\n\nIn December 2010, Scarlett and Ryan filed for divorce after 2 years of marriage. During that time, Ryan acknowledged going through much pain but still hoped for the future. Despite this, the divorce seemed to impact his perspective on relationships. He admitted to not wanting to marry again, “I’m very happy not to be in a relationship right now.”\n\nOleg Nikishin / East News\n\nIn 2019, Scarlett Johansson opened up about her first marriage, highlighting that she got married at the young age of 23. “I didn’t really have an understanding of marriage. Maybe I kind of romanticized it,” she added.\n\nHe crossed paths with Blake while working on a movie.\n\nIn 2010, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively got to know each other while filming the movie Green Lantern, where they portrayed romantic interests. During that period, Blake was in a relationship with her fellow Gossip Girl actor, Penn Badgley. Despite this, Ryan and Blake built a strong friendship.\n\nLooking back on their initial bond, Reynolds mentioned, “We were buddies for a long time, which I think is the best way to have a relationship, to start as friends.”\n\nA year after meeting, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively’s friendship blossomed into a romantic relationship. At that point, Blake had already ended her relationship with Penn Badgley. Although Reynolds had previously mentioned he wasn’t keen on getting married again, he could not resist falling in love with Blake, and their relationship soon became deeply committed.\n\nAFP PHOTO / HECTOR RETAMAL / AFP / EAST NEWS\n\nThe love story of Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively started in a unique way. It happened during a double date, although they were initially with other people. It turned out to be an awkward situation because they felt a strong connection and were clearly attracted to each other.\n\nAfter that memorable moment, they began dating and eventually tied the knot in September 2012. Today, they are a happy family with four children, and they’ve become one of Hollywood’s beloved couples, with a large following who admires them.\n\nThey support each other during difficult moments.\n\nRyan consistently showers praise on his beloved partner, Blake, whenever he has the opportunity. He shared that she’s been instrumental in making him a more empathetic person, handling anger and hate with understanding.\n\nFurthermore, Ryan credits Blake for playing a significant role in mending his relationship with his father, James Reynolds, before he passed away in 2015. He expressed that Blake helped him cherish the positive memories of his father.\n\nRyan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson are not the only ones who found love only after a divorce. Nicole Kidman, Salma Hayek, Chris Pratt, and others show us that finding happiness doesn’t always mean staying with your first love."
