        "text": "The actress opens up about the key to her successful marriage to Jost during a conversation with Gayle King, Tony Dokoupil, and Nate Burleson on CBS Mornings.\n\n\"I don't profess to know anything about that,\" Johansson says of the so-called \"secret\" to a successful marriage. Though, she adds, \"We laugh a lot and we communicate with one another and check in.\"\n\n\"I'm married to a writer, he's a comedy writer,\" Johansson continues. \"He can get, like, very in his head sometimes, he's sort of introverted. I'm extroverted, and so I think the key for us is just always checking in, just asking at the end of the day, 'How was your day?'\"\n\nJohansson and Jost are expecting their first child together, according to Page Six.\n\n\"Scarlett is actually due soon, I know she and Colin are thrilled,\" a source told the outlet of the couple's growing family. This would mark the first child for Jost, and the second for Johansson, who shares a daughter with her ex-husband Romain Dauriac.\n\n\"Scarlett is pregnant but has been keeping it very quiet,\" an additional source shared. \"She has been keeping a very low profile.\"\n\nThe couple married in an \"intimate ceremony\" in October, and broke the news via an Instagram post for Meals on Wheels America.\n\n\"We're thrilled to break the news that Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost were married over the weekend in an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and love ones, following COVID-19 safety precautions as directed by the CDC,\" the account wrote in the caption. \"Their wedding wish is to help make a difference for vulnerable older adults during this difficult time by supporting @mealsonwheelsamerica. Please consider donating to celebrate the happy couple by clicking the link in our bio.\"\n\nWhen Johansson returned to host Saturday Night Live, she proved just how smitten she is with Jost. The star adorably said, “I just want to say that this place means so much to me. I have so many friends here, and I met the love of my life here.” In the clip, Jost looked visibly moved, as well as surprised, as if he had no idea she was going to mention him in that way.\n\nHaving hosted SNL for a fifth time in March 2017, Johansson returned for a cameo on the show's season finale in May. According to Page Six, the actress' romance with writer Colin Jost was confirmed by multiple sources who saw them kissing at the show's afterparty. An alleged witness told the publication, “Scarlett and Colin were making out at the bar at the SNL season finale party... They would make out a bit, then go back to talking. They were at the bar in front of everyone... they made out at least twice.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Johansson recalled meeting Jost when she filmed a sketch he'd written during her appearance on Saturday Night Live in 2010. She explained, \"It was some dumb parody that he had written, and he was in there partly directing this segment we had to do... That's my first memory of him. He seemed very confident at the time. I don't know if he felt that way, but in that environment, if you're not confident as a writer, your stuff just never gets produced.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jost places their very first meeting earlier. He told Entertainment Tonight, \"The first time she hosted [early 2006] was the first year I was a writer on the show... So, we've kind of known each other since then... she's the best.\" Either way, it sounds as though Saturday Night Live is responsible for the couple's eventual romance."
