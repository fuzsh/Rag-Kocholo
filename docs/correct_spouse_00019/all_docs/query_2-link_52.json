        "text": "ScarJost has expanded the family. Scarlett Johansson and husband Colin Jost are proud new parents to a baby boy. The arrival of the newborn comes less than one year after the pair exchanged vows in October 2020.\n\nJost personally took to Instagram to confirm the news on Instagram on August 18. \"Ok ok we had a baby,\" he wrote. \"His name is Cosmo. We love him very much.\" The proud dad also requested privacy and tagged the \"no kids\" account that has held the public responsible for protecting the children of celebs. He also tagged Michael Che as his publicist (which was done in jest).\n\nIn reality, Johansson's publicist Marcel Pariseau first confirmed the baby news to People. The baby boy joins his big sister, Rose Dorothy, age 6. Johansson shares Rose with her ex Romain Dauriac.\n\nThe comedian confirmed his wife's pregnancy in mid-August, though it's unclear whether he had already welcomed the baby at the time. During a stand-up performance, Jost reportedly shared with the audience at Ridgefield Playhouse in Connecticut: \"We're having a baby, it's exciting.\" Page Six first broke the story they were expecting in July, and the news they were parents in August.\n\n\"Scarlett is actually due soon,\" a source said. \"I know she and Colin are thrilled.\" Johansson, 36, fueled pregnancy speculation after she was noticeably missing from several promotional events related to her Marvel flick Black Widow. It was reported that those few interviews she did agree to were shot over Zoom to conceal her pregnancy.\n\nThis will be Johansson's second child. She is mom to her six-year-old daughter, Rose, whom she shares with her ex-husband Romain Dauriac. It will be the Saturday Night Live personality's first child, though he has likely honed his parenting skills as stepdad to Rose. Johansson and Jost married in October 2020 after dating for three years. Like many couples, they had to modify their nuptials due to COVID. Here's what to know about their relationship and wedding.\n\nHow Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost Embraced Wedding Trends\n\nJohansson and Jost made the leap of faith to marry in October 2020. The couple exchanged vows in a minimony at their home in Palisades, New York. Like millions of couples who faced postponed weddings amid COVID, the dynamic duo also faced their own set of challenges as they planned. In a People interview, Johansson revealed additional details about her nuptials, including seemingly relatable snippets for most COVID couples.\n\n\"I think just keeping it intimate and small made it feel intentional,\" the actress told the mag. \"We wanted it to feel like it had an intentional intimacy as opposed to being something that felt like we were restricted by all these things.\"\n\nJohansson and Jost's minimony reflected much of The Knot's 2021 wedding trends, especially the notion of intentionality while planning a wedding. The couple also took full health and safety measures into account for the event at home. \"There was a lot to take into consideration because of all of the CDC guidelines and making sure everybody was comfortable and safe, following all the COVID protocol,\" she added in the same interview.\n\nThat wasn't the only trend from ScarJost's wedding day. The newlyweds, very aware of their platform and presence, also made a splash on social media with a \"big reveal\" opportunity. They debuted the announcement of their wedding via Instagram by supporting Meals on Wheels America. \"We're thrilled to break the news that Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost were married over the weekend in an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and love ones, following COVID-19 safety precautions as directed by the CDC,\" the post read. \"Their wedding wish is to help make a difference for vulnerable older adults during this difficult time by supporting @mealsonwheelsamerica. Please consider donating to celebrate the happy couple by clicking the link in our bio.\" (Jost and Johansson also joined to-be-weds Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom in promoting charities to announce life stages.)\n\nMany 2020 couples opted for minimonies (small ceremonies) and backyard microweddings, which were attended only by their direct loved ones in order to make their marriage official. It has been an increasing trend among many newlyweds to also plan a second event (either a sequel wedding or an anniversary reception) to formally mark their spousal status, something that will be ever-popular in 2021.\n\nIn early November, Jost debuted his solid gold wedding band on SNL's Weekend Update. \"I don't know what's gonna happen with this election, the tension is just killing me,\" Michael Che said to his co-host. \"I don't know what this world's gonna be after Tuesday. I may never see you again, Colin. I mean, we might both get drafted in the race wars. It's not fair, you just married Scarlett Johansson, and I just bought an electric bike. We're both doing equally great.\"\n\nJohansson and Jost got engaged in May 2019, announcing their nuptials to the Associated Press through her publicist. Four months later, the Marvel actress joked that she needed all the help before her nuptials. \"I don't know!\" she remarked in one interview. \"Can you help me?!\""
