        "text": "Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost are certainly cementing themselves as a Hollywood power couple despite often keeping their relationship low-key.\n\nThe pair made July 8 their date night at the New York premiere of Fly Me to the Moon, and they even share screen time together in the romantic comedy-drama, thanks to a cameo from Colin.\n\nThe 42-year-old Saturday Night Live writer makes a surprise appearance in the film alongside his 39-year-old wife, who leads the cast alongside Channing Tatum.\n\nThe actress appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and spoke about the upcoming movie, also commenting on her husband's cameo joking: \"Oh yes, I know him!\"\n\nScarlett explained that Fly Me to the Moon director Greg Berlanti was the one responsible for the special appearance, as he was a fan of the comedian and decided to recruit him for the role.\n\nShe joked: \"Greg, our director, is a huge fan of Colin's, and Colin…I think he had to do it because it's in our prenuptial agreement. If I ask him to do something, he has to be there to support me.\"\n\nJimmy, left in hysterics, quipped that it also involved him making cameos in all her films, and asked her about running lines with him, which she said was a mixed bag.\n\n\"You'd think that would be very convenient because you have a partner there to help you out to learn your lines for tomorrow, whatever,\" she continued. \"He does real serious…he really commits to the line reading. And it's not always the performance I want it to be.\"\n\nREAD: Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost's son Cosmo is taking after dad in rare picture of private life\n\n\"Just say the line!\" she blurted, and Jimmy even added that he wasn't \"going for the Oscar here,\" and Scarlett continued: \"Big dramatic pauses, he gets really into it, and I'm like, 'I can't focus, forget it, forget it! I'll just learn them myself.'\"\n\nShe couldn't stop herself, however, from complimenting him for a job well done in her new movie. \"He's great! He's so funny, off-the-cuff, and charming and great!\"\n\nPOPULAR: Michael Douglas' surprising DNA connection to Scarlett Johansson revealed\n\nThe Black Widow star recently made an appearance on the Today Show and commented on her husband's Olympics hosting gig — but he's not going to Paris, he'll be reporting on the surfing competition in Teahupo'o, Tahiti.\n\n\"I'm like, how did he get this gig?\" the actress joked on the NBC morning news show, although did share that her husband was extremely excited about the role as an avid surfer.\n\nMORE: Scarlett Johansson makes revelation about rarely seen son — and he's adorable\n\n\"When they announced the Paris Olympics, he immediately found out that they were doing the surf competition in Tahiti, which is so cool. He loves to surf, we have a place in Montauk, he's always out there surfing,\" she told host Savannah Guthrie.\n\n\"And somehow the dream became a reality, and now he's going to be in Tahiti for two weeks, and I'm like, 'Poor you.'\" She continued: \"He's like, 'Poor me, I'm going to be all over the place,' and I'm like, 'Are you?' I think if you can have a pina colada on air while you're working, that's not technically work.\""
