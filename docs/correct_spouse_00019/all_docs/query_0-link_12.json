        "text": "SOURCE: NEW YORK DAILY NEWS nydailynews.com\n\nScar-Jo, Reynolds make better friends than spouses with divorce officially filed\n\nGatecrasher\n\nFriday, December 24th 2010, 4:00 AM\n\nKramer/AP; Corkery/News\n\nRyan Reynolds officially ended his marriage of two years Thursday to Scarlett Johannson when Reynolds filed for divorce in Los Angele Superior Court.\n\nDivorcee-to-be Scarlett Johansson is living by a new motto these days: \"Keep your friends close, and your exes closer.\"\n\nThe curvy actress and her abs-fab hubby of two years, Ryan Reynolds, officially ended their marriage of two years Thursday when Reynolds filed for divorce in Los Angele Superior Court.\n\nBut a source close to the actress tells us the circumstances surrounding the filing are evidence that Reynolds and Scar-Jo are on great terms.\n\nThe source explains that although Johansson initially pulled the plug on the marriage earlier this month, the couple decided Ryan would make the initial filing to ensure Scar-Jo would no longer look like \"the bad guy\" in the breakup.\n\nThe couple also decided Reynolds would file during the holidays, when press coverage is lighter, and Scarlett’s response to the divorce petition was filed at the same time.\n\nOddly enough, our source says Scar-Jo and her future ex-husband communicate more now than they did before their split.\n\nThe insider adds Johansson is in close contact with another ex: Jared Leto.\n\nThe actor/30 Seconds to Mars singer and Johansson dated from spring 2004 until early 2005 when Leto, who was 33 at the time, reportedly called it quits because Scarlett, then 20, was too young.\n\nBut this fall, when Johansson and Reynolds were on their relationship roller coaster, our source says, Johansson and Leto hung out together here.\n\nThe two dined at Blue Ribbon in SoHo on Oct. 12, the same restaurant where, People.com reported, Johansson and Reynolds ate the Friday after announcing their split. Johansson and Leto were also spotted walking together on the lower East Side early in the morning of Oct. 29.\n\nLeto’s tour schedule has since taken him overseas, but our source says the two continue to stay in close contact via phone.\n\nJohansson, now 26, has also been leaning on her pal and former “A View From the Bridge” co-star Liev Schreiber for support.\n\nReps for Johansson and Leto could not be reached for comment by deadline.\n\nI would date Sean Penn .. he's just such an interesting-sounding man and really talented and passionate on what he does.. I would pick him over Ryan any day, don't know much about Ryan but he looks quite.. simple.\n\nThat being said, it doesn't look like they're dating to me.. she's got her legs on his lap, surely that's a bit of contact but I've done that before with friends (and they weren't even close), table's small, legs are tired, you ask if they mind, big deal.\n\nIf they're dating though, they're both equally lucky..\n\nI would date Sean Penn .. he's just such an interesting-sounding man and really talented and passionate on what he does..

I guess time will tell."
