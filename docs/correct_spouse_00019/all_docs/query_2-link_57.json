        "text": "Awkward!\n\nColin Jost had to make a wisecrack about his wife Scarlett Johansson’s body during his and Michael Che’s fan-favorite joke swap segment on the “Weekend Update” portion of the “Saturday Night Live” Season 49 finale on May 18.\n\nThe pair each write offensive jokes that they swap and read on-air, with no warning about what they have to say.\n\nJost, 41, got tricked by Che, 41, into making a joke about Johansson, 39.\n\n“Oh God,” Jost said as he looked at the camera and saw an image of his wife that read, “ChatGPT.”\n\nWhile trying to hold back his laughter, Jost said: “ChatGPT has released a new voice assistant feature inspired by Scarlett Johansson’s AI character in ‘Her.’ Which I’ve never bothered to watch, because without that body, what’s the point of listening?”\n\nJost covered his face with his hand after cracking the joke about Johansson.\n\nThe live audience, meanwhile, laughed loudly and cheered.\n\nChe looked over at his mortified co-host and smiled and laughed to himself.\n\nIronically, Jost and Johansson owe their entire relationship to “SNL.”\n\nThe couple met in 2017 when Johansson hosted an episode of the late-night sketch comedy show. They got married in 2020 and welcomed their son Cosmo the following year.\n\nJohansson also has a 9-year-old daughter, Rose, from her previous marriage to French journalist Romain Dauriac.\n\nLast year, Johansson revealed on “The Kelly Clarkson Show” that Jost sometimes tries his jokes out on the actress — and it doesn’t always go well.\n\n“He’ll love a play on words or a pun that have now become dad jokes,” she said. “They used to be just like duds and now they’re dads.”\n\nDuring another one of Johansson’s interviews on Kelly Clarkson’s talk show in 2021, the “Black Widow” star admitted that she gets nervous watching her husband on “SNL.”\n\n“I now rarely watch without having a sense of … not overwhelming panic, just like a slight underwhelming panic, because I just feel like at any moment something’s going to fall apart,” she explained. “And that’s the excitement of ‘SNL’ and for all audiences, right? Because it’s absolutely live.”\n\nJohansson continued: “But when you’re emotionally invested in it, and not just entertained by it, it takes on a little bit of a different life.”"
