The former set numerous records at the time of its release for an R-rated comedy and his performance earned him nominations at the Critics' Choice Movie Awards and the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nReynolds was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 2010 and was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2017. As a businessman, he holds an ownership stake in Mint Mobile and is a co-owner of Welsh football club Wrexham A.F.C.; the latter was documented in the Emmy Award-winning TV series Welcome to Wrexham. In 2020, Reynolds sold his ownership stake of Aviation Gin to Diageo as part of a $610 million deal.[1] He also sits on the board of the Match Group.[2]\n\nEarly life\n\nRyan Rodney Reynolds was born on October 23, 1976, in Vancouver, British Columbia. He is the youngest of four sons. His father, James Chester Reynolds, was a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman before retiring from the force and going to work as a foods wholesaler.[3][4][5] His mother, Tamara Lee (née Stewart), worked in retail sales.[6][7] Reynolds has two brothers who work in law enforcement in British Columbia, one of whom followed their father into the RCMP.[8][9] His paternal grandfather, Chester Reynolds, was a farmer who represented Stettler in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1940 to 1944.[10] Reynolds has Irish and Scottish ancestry, and was raised in the Roman Catholic Church in Vancouver's Kitsilano neighbourhood[11][12] and Vanier, Ontario (now a neighbourhood in Ottawa).[13]\n\nReynolds has been involved in acting since age thirteen. He graduated from Kitsilano Secondary School in 1994, which he attended with actor Joshua Jackson.[14] Reynolds played small roles in a number of television series, but became discouraged and quit acting at age 19 to enroll at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. A few months later he ran into fellow actor Chris William Martin, who convinced him to try again and move with him to Los Angeles.[15][16]\n\nCareer\n\nSee also: Ryan Reynolds filmography\n\n1991–2003: Early work\n\nReynolds's career began in 1991 when he starred as Billy Simpson in the Canadian-produced teen soap opera Hillside, distributed in the United States by Nickelodeon as Fifteen. In 1993, Reynolds played a child who moves from India to Canada after the death of his father in the film Ordinary Magic.[17] Between 1993 and 1994, he had a recurring role in The Odyssey as Macro.[18] In 1996, he had a supporting role as Jay \"Boom\" DeBoom in \"Syzygy\", the thirteenth episode of the third season of The X-Files, and co-starred with Melissa Joan Hart in the TV movie Sabrina the Teenage Witch.[19] In 1996, Reynolds played Bobby Rupp, boyfriend of murdered teen Nancy Clutter, in a two-part miniseries In Cold Blood, an adaptation of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel of the same name. He also appeared in the anthology The Outer Limits episode \"Origin of the Species\", which originally aired on November 14, 1998. Beginning in 1998, Reynolds starred in Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place, playing medical student Michael \"Berg\" Bergen throughout the show's four-season run. He starred in the National Lampoon movie Van Wilder in 2002, appeared in The In-Laws with Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks, and also in the Canadian production Foolproof in 2003.[20]\n\n2004–2015: Romantic comedies and widespread recognition\n\nAlthough he had performed primarily in comedies, Reynolds underwent intense physical training to play an action role as the character of Hannibal King in the 2004 film Blade: Trinity.[21] The same year, he made a cameo appearance in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle as a nurse. Reynolds played George Lutz in the 2005 remake of the 1979 horror film The Amityville Horror.[22] Also in 2005, he played a waiter named Monty in Waiting... and appeared as music executive Chris Brander in the romantic comedy Just Friends alongside Amy Smart and Anna Faris. In Just Friends, Reynolds lip-synced \"I Swear\" over the end credits. Additionally, he played an FBI agent alongside Ray Liotta in the 2006 crime action film Smokin' Aces.[23] Reynolds played the protagonist in the 2008 film Definitely, Maybe.[24] He also appeared in the second-season finale of the television series Scrubs.

The film did not fare well either financially or critically, but his role made him one of the few actors to have headlined films based on both Marvel and DC characters.[31] In 2011, he co-starred in the comedy The Change-Up, as well as narrating the documentary film The Whale. In 2012, he portrayed an agent in Safe House, alongside Denzel Washington.[32] He then had starring roles in two DreamWorks Animation feature films, The Croods and Turbo, both released in 2013.

This was followed by a supporting role in the financially successful biographical film Woman in Gold before he returned to the thriller genre with Self/Less, also in 2015.\n\n2015–present: Established actor and Marvel work\n\nIn 2016, Reynolds found critical and commercial success with Deadpool, a film that had been in development as early as 2000. After portraying Wade Wilson / Weapon XI, in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, he became heavily involved in the development of a Deadpool film. Deadpool featured a reboot of the character, ignoring the events of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and establishing a new backstory for the character that was closer to the Marvel Comics source material. The film takes place within the larger 20th Century Fox X-Men film universe, being made possible by the reset timeline in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Deadpool made several box-office records, including a worldwide opening of $264.9 million from 62 markets, which was the biggest of 2016, the biggest for an R-rated film, and the second biggest for Fox behind only Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith ($303.9 million).[34][35] It also recorded the biggest IMAX 2D worldwide opening of all time with $27.4 million from 606 IMAX theatres, eclipsing The Dark Knight Rises ($23.8 million).[36][37] The film's financial and critical success led the studio to move forward with a sequel.\n\nAlso in 2016, Reynolds had a supporting role in the Ariel Vromen-directed thriller Criminal. On December 15, 2016, Reynolds received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.[38][39] Reynolds co-starred with Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson in the science fiction thriller Life in 2017, which reunited him with Safe House director Daniel Espinosa.[40] Reynolds began filming Deadpool 2 in June 2017.

The film, The Croods: A New Age, was also released in 2020.[52]\n\nIn 2021, Reynolds starred in three films. The first, Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, is an action comedy film directed by Patrick Hughes and written by Tom O'Connor and Brandon and Phillip Murphy. The film is a sequel to the 2017 film The Hitman's Bodyguard which also featured Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, Salma Hayek, and Richard E. Grant, who reprised their roles. Beginning April 2019, Reynolds shot his second 2021 film, science fiction action comedy film Free Guy, directed by Shawn Levy, from a screenplay by Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn, and a story by Lieberman. Reynolds stars as \"a background character who realizes he's living in a video game. With the help of an avatar, he tries to prevent the makers of the game from shutting down his world.\" Also featuring Jodie Comer, Lil Rel Howery, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Joe Keery and Taika Waititi, the film was theatrically released in the United States on August 13 by 20th Century Studios.[53][54] In his last film of the year, Reynolds starred alongside Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot in Netflix's thriller Red Notice, written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber.[55]\n\nIn October 2021, Reynolds announced he was taking \"a little sabbatical\" from his work after the production of Spirited.[56] In March 2022, Reynolds starred in Netflix's science-fiction adventure film The Adam Project, directed by Shawn Levy.[57][58]\n\nBusiness ventures\n\nIn January 2018, Reynolds started the production company Maximum Effort and signed a three-year first-look deal with Fox.
