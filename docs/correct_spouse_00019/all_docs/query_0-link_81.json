        "text": "Scarlett Johansson has made a rare comment about ex-husband Ryan Reynolds in a new interview.\n\nDuring a conversation on Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop podcast, the Black Widow star opened up about her previous marriages and spoke about her relationship with the Deadpool actor.\n\nThe pair tied the knot in 2008 but announced that they were separating in 2010, releasing a joint statement which read: \"After long and careful consideration on both our parts, we’ve decided to end our marriage.\n\n\"We entered our relationship with love and it’s with love and kindness we leave it. While privacy isn’t expected, it’s certainly appreciated.\"\n\nWhen Gwyneth asked, \"You’ve been married two times?\" she replied: \"Three times.\"\n\nThe Goop founder responded: \"Oh that’s right, because I forgot that you were married to Ryan Reynolds! Goals.\"\n\nScarlett laughed, before adding: \"We weren’t married very long, but we were when I first met you, for Iron Man or whatever.\"\n\nWhen Gwyneth added that 'we love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house', Scarlett continued: \"He’s a good guy.\"\n\nRyan went on to marry Blake Lively in 2012, and the couple share four children together - daughters James, 8, Inez, 6, and Betty, 3, with their fourth child (whose name has not yet been publicly shared) born earlier this year.\n\nScarlett later married Romain Dauriac in 2014 and they welcomed their daughter Rose the same year. However, they separated in 2017 with Scarlett going on to marry Colin Jost in 2020. Their son Cosmo was born in 2021.\n\nDiscussing her marriage to Jost, Scarlett shared: \"I knew Colin for a long time, but only kind of through work. And when we first started seeing each other, I would never have probably been ready for a relationship like the one that I have with Colin at different times in my life.\n\n\"Because I wasn’t comfortable with setting my own boundaries, and I didn’t know what I wanted or needed from somebody else.\"\n\nShe added: \"Obviously, it’s hard to be in a relationship anyway because you have to compromise all the time. But I never realised, 'Oh, it’s really important for me, I need to be with a compassionate person. That’s a fundamental characteristic that has to be there.'\""
