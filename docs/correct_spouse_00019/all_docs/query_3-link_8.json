        "text": "Scarlett Johansson has some thoughts on husband Colin Jost’s upcoming Olympics reporting job in Tahiti.\n\n“I’m like, how did he get this gig?” the “Fly Me to the Moon” actor, 39, joked to Savannah Guthrie during a visit to TODAY on Monday.\n\nJost, 42, will be covering the Paris Olympics surfing competition as part of NBC’s Olympic coverage. He will be reporting from Teahupo’o, Tahiti, which is part of French Polynesia, starting July 27.\n\nThe “Saturday Night Live” star is an avid surfer, so he was thrilled to land this particular gig, Johansson said.\n\n“When they announced the Paris Olympics, he immediately found out that they were doing the surf competition in Tahiti, which is so cool. He loves to surf, we have a place in Montauk, he’s always out there surfing,” she told Savannah.\n\n“And somehow the dream became a reality, and now he’s going to be in Tahiti for two weeks, and I’m like, ‘Poor you,’” she added, drawing a fake tear down her cheek.\n\nShe also teased her husband over his reaction to his upcoming travels to Tahiti.\n\n“He’s like, ‘Poor me, I’m going to be all over the place,’ and I’m like, ‘Are you?’” she said. “I think if you can have a pina colada on air while you’re working, that’s not technically work.”\n\nThe Olympic surfing competition will take place over four days between July 27 and Aug. 5, with the exact days to be determined by weather conditions.\n\nIt’s the second time surfing has been included in the Summer Games; the sport made its debut at the Tokyo Games held in 2021.\n\nIn Tahiti, Jost will be interviewing athletes and possibly even catching a few waves himself, according to an NBC Sports press release.\n\n“I’m honored to get to watch the best surfers in the world compete on one of the heaviest waves imaginable, and to help showcase the rich history of surfing in Tahiti,” Jost said in the release. “And my Writers Guild Health Insurance is excited to see what the coral reef does to my back.”"
