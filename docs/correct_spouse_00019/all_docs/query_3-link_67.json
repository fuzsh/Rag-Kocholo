        "text": "Husband of the year.\n\nScarlett Johansson joked that her prenup with husband Colin Jost is the reason why he made a cameo in her new movie “Fly Me to the Moon.”\n\n“Greg Berlanti was our director. [He’s] a huge fan of Colin’s,” the Marvel actress, 39, said on Monday’s episode of “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” when discussing Jost’s cameo.\n\n“Colin … I think he had to do it ’cause it’s, like, in our prenuptial agreement,” Johansson joked. “If I ask him to do something, he has to be there to support me. He has to be in every one of my films.”\n\nJohansson, who stars in the new rom-com opposite Channing Tatum, said that Jost, 42, helps her prepare for work.\n\n“I run lines with him,” she shared. “Which is great. You’d think that would be very convenient because you have a partner there to help you out. You learn your lines for tomorrow or whatever. He does, like, real serious … he really commits to the line reading.”\n\nShe continued: “It’s not always the performance I want it to be. I’m just like, ‘Say the lines!’ Big dramatic pauses. He gets really into it. I’m like, ‘I can’t focus. Forget it. I’ll just learn them myself.’\n\n“He’s great,” Johansson added about her husband. “He’s so funny and off-the-cuff and charming and great.”\n\nThe couple met in 2017 when Johansson hosted an episode of “Saturday Night Live.” Jost has worked on the sketch comedy show since 2005.\n\nThey got married in 2020 and welcomed their son, Cosmo, the following year.\n\nJohansson also has a 9-year-old daughter, Rose, from her previous marriage to French journalist Romain Dauriac.\n\nWhile Johansson is busy promoting “Fly Me to the Moon,” Jost is preparing to travel to Tahiti to cover the surfing competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics for NBC.\n\nThe “Black Widow” star discussed her husband’s new gig on Monday’s episode of “Today.”\n\n“Even I’m like, ‘How did you get this gig?’ I just want to know,” she said in the interview with Savannah Guthrie.\n\n“When they announced the Paris Olympics, he immediately found out that the surf competition [is] in Tahiti, which is so cool. He loves to surf, we have a place in Montauk, he’s always out there surfing,” Johansson continued. “Somehow the dream became a reality, and now he’s going to be in Tahiti for two weeks. I’m like, ‘Poor you.'”\n\nShe quipped: “I think if you can have a piña colada on air while you’re working, it’s not technically work.”\n\n“Fly Me to the Moon” is in theaters Friday."
