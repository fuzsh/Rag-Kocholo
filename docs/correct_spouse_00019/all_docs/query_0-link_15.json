        "text": "This one falls very much into the ‘it’s all water under the bridge now’ category of celebrity news (they’re both very happily settled with others) but Scarlett Johansson maybe just gave the rather cryptic reason for why her marriage to Ryan Reynolds ended: They were too competitive.\n\nTalking to Cosmo, Scar Jo (without naming any names) said: “The logistics of being with another actor are challenging. There has to be a real understanding of how you share your time, especially when two people’s careers are going at the same rate. Or even if one person is more successful than the other, that also proves challenging. There may be a competitive thing.”\n\nThat’s all the explanation you’re ever going to get from Scar Jo on this one…but since she’s currently with an art dealer (hi Romain Dauriac!), we assume she’s not talking about her current relationship, and most likely about the 3 years she spent married to Reynolds, who is, you may know, an actor."
