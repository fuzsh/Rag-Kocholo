        "text": "Scarlett Johansson's character, 'Black Widow', and Ryan Reynolds' character, 'Deadpool', share two connections. Firstly, they are both Marvel Comics characters. Secondly, the actors who portrayed them were previously married. Ryan Reynold and Scarlett Johansson were together for three years before calling it quits in 2010.\n\nadvertisement\n\nReynolds and Johansson were rumoured to be a couple after Reynolds ended his engagement with fellow Canadian actress, Alanis Morissette, in 2007. People magazine reported in May 2008 that Reynolds and Johansson were engaged. Four months later, the couple got married at a wilderness retreat in Vancouver Island, Canada. This was the first marriage for both the actors. Unfortunately, their marriage did not last long, and they eventually decided to part ways in 2010. They released an official statement announcing the same. The statement mentioned:\n\n\"After long and careful consideration on both our parts, we've decided to end our marriage. We entered our relationship with love, and it's with love and kindness we leave it. While privacy isn't expected, it's certainly appreciated.\"\n\nRecommended read: Joe Jonas' Exes Unite, Ex-Wife, Sophie Turner And Ex-Gf Taylor Swift Spotted Happily Exiting A Diner\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nScarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds’ relationship lacked warmth\n\nWhile Scarlett and Ryan’s official divorce statement might give an idea that their relationship was just fine, and it ended on a good note but, several sources who were close to the ex-couple reveal otherwise. A source revealed to InTouch Weekly that the duo lacked warmth in their relationship as they both were very strong-willed people. The source said:\n\nadvertisement\n\n“They’re both strong-willed and stubborn people. There was a lack of warmth between them, that was troubling. He can be an overbearing control freak. He’s more traditional, and she’s more independent. When he wanted her there, he expected her to drop everything and come to him. She got tired of the double standard.”\n\nScarlett Johansson revealed that she and Ryan Reynolds hardly ever got time to go on dates\n\nScarlett Johansson, in an interview with Time Out New York in 2009, revealed about her equation with her then-husband, Ryan Reynolds. She stated that they never had time to go on dates. She further added:\n\nadvertisement\n\n“We have no time for dates. We work and then go home, and I, anyway, just stare at the wall for a few hours before I go to sleep…Like in any profession, it’s difficult. You want to make sure you have time to invest in your family. It’s a challenge, but it’s worth it.”\n\nAfter their divorce, both Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds shared their thoughts on marriage\n\nIn 2011, Scarlett Johansson shared her thoughts on marriage with Cosmopolitan UK, and she mentioned that relationships are complex and that marriage is a process. She said:\n\nadvertisement.\n\n\"Relationships are complicated, and being married is a living, breathing process. I think I was not fully aware of the peaks and valleys. I wasn't prepared to hunker down and do the work.\"\n\nPost their divorce, even Ryan Reynolds shared his thoughts on marriage in an interview with the Daily Mail. He said that he does not want to get married again. But destiny had other plans. He met the Gossip Girl actress, Blake Lively, and the rest is history! The much-in-love couple often share their funny banters on their respective social media accounts proving why they are one of the power couples in Tinseltown. The couple has four children. They welcomed their fourth one in 2023.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nDon’t Miss: Chris Evans Spills The Tea On His Romance With Alba Baptista, Says, 'After A Few Months Of Dating..'\n\nIn an interview with Cosmopolitan in 2016, Scarlett Johansson spoke on the importance of making time for a relationship. She highlighted the challenges one faces if both partners belong to the same field of work. She said:\n\nADVT.\n\n\"The logistics of being with another actor are challenging. There has to be a real understanding of how you share your time, especially when two people's careers are going at the same rate. Or even if one person is more successful than the other, that also proves challenging. There may be a competitive thing.\"\n\nScarlett Johansson’s relationship with Colin Jost\n\nadvertisement\n\nRyan Reynolds is not the only one from the ex-couple who found love again. Scarlett, too, found the love of her life, Colin Jost. Although Scarlett and Colin met in the 2000s but, their love blossomed only after the Black Widow actress called her marriage off from her second husband, Romain Dauriac, in 2017. Colin and Scarlett got married in 2020 and welcomed a boy in 2021.
