        "text": "Scarlett Johansson is revealing just how terrified she gets when her husband, Colin Jost, and Michael Che keep to their Saturday Night Live tradition and swap jokes on “Weekend Update.”\n\nDuring a recent appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, The Avengers star called the bit, in which Jost and Che write offensive jokes for each other to read live on air without seeing them beforehand, “brutal.”\n\n“We need to go into witness protection after that night. Like, I am absolutely terrified we’re gonna be targeted. It’s so bad,” Johansson said of the segment. “I black out for that period of the night. I actually don’t remember it.”\n\nHost Kelly Clarkson also pointed out how Johansson will sometimes be the subject of one of the jokes, including in the most recent “Weekend Update” during the SNL season 49 finale on May 18. “ChatGBT has released a new voice assistant feature inspired by Scarlett Johansson’s AI character in Her,” Jost read aloud, as written by Che. “Which I’ve never bothered to watch, because without that body, what’s the point of listening.”\n\n“As soon as the picture came up, I was like [screams],” the Fly Me to the Moon actress told Clarkson while covering her face. “It is brutal. It is brutal. I feel like every year it gets worse. It’s just terrible.”\n\nJohansson added, “I mean, I really do, I actually don’t remember that segment. I fully blacked out. And they do it at Christmas, too. It’s like a little gift to each other.”\n\nJost and Johansson tied the knot in October 2020 and share a son together. The Black Widow star also shares a daughter with ex-husband Romain Dauriac."
