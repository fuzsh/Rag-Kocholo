        "text": "Actress, SNL Five-Timer, singer, and entrepreneur Scarlett Johansson visited The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on November 18. If anyone wonders how the Asteroid City actress maintains such glowing complexion, she's happy to tell you: The secret is her own skincare line, The Outset, she told Jimmy Fallon.\n\nJohansson launched the line in March 2022 with beauty executive Kate Foster, though she told Fallon the products were \"five years in the making.\"\n\nFallon thanked Johansson for sending him The Outset's products, which he just so happened to have underneath his desk. \"Actually, you probably sent it for Nancy,\" Fallon said, referring to his wife of 16 years, Nancy Juvonen.\n\n\"You need it, too,\" Johansson told Fallon, before quickly and hilariously trying to backpedal. \"I mean, not—you don't need it You have working skin—\"\n\n\"Working skin?!\" Fallon laughed. \"That's not a thing anyone says to anyone else, that you have 'working skin'. I have a face that looks like it needs help!?\"\n\nWatch Scarlett Johansson use her skincare products on husband Colin Jost\n\nAs Johansson told Fallon, The Outset's products were developed at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, which made it difficult to product-test safely. But she says Jost, who she met on the set of SNL and welcomed son Cosmo with in August 2021, was already a skincare enthusiast.\n\n\"He's the first man I've ever met that used eye cream before,\" Johansson said (Jost is on TV super late at night, so that's a wise choice in our book). \"I never used eye cream, he used eye cream first.\" Joking about revealing his regimen, she added, \"he's got great eyes!\"\n\nRELATED: Colin Jost Has a Hilarious Update on His Ferry with Pete Davidson\n\n\"Colin would love this,\" Fallon said, calling the \"Weekend Update\" host \"the greatest.\"\n\nJost is definitely game to support Johansson's business. Exhibit A: The video The Outset shared that found Johansson applying her products to Jost's face.\n\nThe video includes funny outtakes that reveal Johansson and Jost's dynamic. \"I'm mostly thinking, just about how I have to go back into a comedy community after this,\" Jost says as his wife rubs a mask off his face with a soft cloth.\n\nWatch Johansson and Jost demo The Outset, while sharing some of their family's holiday traditions and memories, below."
