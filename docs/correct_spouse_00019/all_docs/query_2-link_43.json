        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nScarlett Johansson and Colin Jost's love story is one for the ages. The famous actress and SNL's head writer seemingly hit it off during one of Johansson's stints on the show, and since then, they've proven themselves to be adorable both on and off the red carpet. Here's everything you need to know about Johansson's and Jost's relationship—from engagement, to marriage, to now expecting parents.\n\nJune 12, 2023\n\nThe actress opens up about the key to her successful marriage to Jost during a conversation with Gayle King, Tony Dokoupil, and Nate Burleson on CBS Mornings.\n\n\"I don't profess to know anything about that,\" Johansson says of the so-called \"secret\" to a successful marriage. Though, she adds, \"We laugh a lot and we communicate with one another and check in.\"\n\n\"I'm married to a writer, he's a comedy writer,\" Johansson continues. \"He can get, like, very in his head sometimes, he's sort of introverted. I'm extroverted, and so I think the key for us is just always checking in, just asking at the end of the day, 'How was your day?'\"\n\nJuly 2021\n\nJohansson and Jost are expecting their first child together, according to Page Six.\n\n\"Scarlett is actually due soon, I know she and Colin are thrilled,\" a source told the outlet of the couple's growing family. This would mark the first child for Jost, and the second for Johansson, who shares a daughter with her ex-husband Romain Dauriac.\n\n\"Scarlett is pregnant but has been keeping it very quiet,\" an additional source shared. \"She has been keeping a very low profile.\"\n\nOctober 2020\n\nThe couple married in an \"intimate ceremony\" in October, and broke the news via an Instagram post for Meals on Wheels America.\n\n\"We're thrilled to break the news that Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost were married over the weekend in an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and love ones, following COVID-19 safety precautions as directed by the CDC,\" the account wrote in the caption. \"Their wedding wish is to help make a difference for vulnerable older adults during this difficult time by supporting @mealsonwheelsamerica. Please consider donating to celebrate the happy couple by clicking the link in our bio.\"\n\nJanuary 2019\n\nThe couple hit the red carpet together for awards season 2020, with Johansson nominated for her roles in Marriage Story and Jojo Rabbit. Pictured at the Golden Globes, Jost also accompanied Johansson to the SAG Awards.\n\nDecember 2019\n\nWhen Johansson returned to host Saturday Night Live, she proved just how smitten she is with Jost. The star adorably said, “I just want to say that this place means so much to me. I have so many friends here, and I met the love of my life here.” In the clip, Jost looked visibly moved, as well as surprised, as if he had no idea she was going to mention him in that way.\n\nSee the original post on Youtube\n\nMay 2019\n\nJohansson and Jost revealed their engagement in May 2019, with Johansson’s publicist, Marcel Pariseau, confirming the news to Associated Press. In July 2019, the actress debuted her stunning 11-carat engagement ring at Comic-Con. On The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Johansson said she was \"surprised\" by the proposal, calling Jost, \"very charming, very thoughtful and romantic.\"\n\nApril 2019\n\nAnother year, another Avengers premiere. Jost supported the Black Widow herself at the world premiere of Avengers: Endgame at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nA year on from Jost's solo Emmys appearance, the comedy writer hit the red carpet with his beau, and they couldn't keep their eyes off one another.\n\nMay 2018\n\nJohansson and Jost hit the Met Gala red carpet as a couple, and looked as though they'd fallen right out of a fairytale.\n\nApril 2018\n\nJost accompanied his girlfriend to the Avengers: Infinity War premiere in Los Angeles on April 23, 2018, where the couple made their red carpet debut. While promoting the movie during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Johansson was shown a throwback photo of her boyfriend with a beard, and her reaction was simply hilarious.\n\nNovember 2017\n\nThe couple looked beyond adorable as they attended their first public event together. Johansson and Jost stepped out for the 2017 Museum Gala at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and there was PDA aplenty. The same month, a source revealed to People that the couple had already met each other's families.\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nAt the 2017 Emmy Awards, Jost opened up about his romance with Johansson and told Entertainment Tonight, \"She's wonderful. She's working, so otherwise, she'd be here. She's pretty cool... It's hard to have a lot of complaints, she's pretty awesome.\"\n\nMay 2017\n\nHaving hosted SNL for a fifth time in March 2017, Johansson returned for a cameo on the show's season finale in May. According to Page Six, the actress' romance with writer Colin Jost was confirmed by multiple sources who saw them kissing at the show's afterparty. An alleged witness told the publication, “Scarlett and Colin were making out at the bar at the SNL season finale party... They would make out a bit, then go back to talking. They were at the bar in front of everyone... they made out at least twice.\"\n\nSee the original post on Youtube\n\nSomewhere between 2006 and 2010\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Johansson recalled meeting Jost when she filmed a sketch he'd written during her appearance on Saturday Night Live in 2010. She explained, \"It was some dumb parody that he had written, and he was in there partly directing this segment we had to do... That's my first memory of him. He seemed very confident at the time. I don't know if he felt that way, but in that environment, if you're not confident as a writer, your stuff just never gets produced.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jost places their very first meeting earlier. He told Entertainment Tonight, \"The first time she hosted [early 2006] was the first year I was a writer on the show... So, we've kind of known each other since then... she's the best.\" Either way, it sounds as though Saturday Night Live is responsible for the couple's eventual romance.\n\nSee the original post on Youtube\n\nYou Might Also Like"
