        "text": "Much beloved actress Scarlett Johansson, 38, is known across the world for her blockbuster hits, but without any social media accounts the star has shed very little light on her personal and romantic life with many often forgetting she was married for the first time at the age of 23.\n\nScarlett and fellow A-lister Ryan Reynolds, 46, tied the knot in 2008 when Scarlett was just 23, years before either of them would achieve global renown in the MCU.\n\nWhen they announced their split in 2010, the couple issued a statement saying: “After long and careful consideration on both our parts, we've decided to end our marriage. We entered our relationship with love and it's with love and kindness we leave it.”\n\nOver the years, both actors have remained relatively quiet on the topic of their first marriage with Scarlett opening up a few years after the split to Cosmopolitan saying that “the logistics” of being married to another actor were surprisingly challenging.\n\nNow, speaking with her MCU costar Gwyneth Paltrow, 50, Scarlett made a rare comment about her former love.\n\nREAD MORE: Paul O'Grady funeral: Comic Julian Clary gives 'entertaining' eulogy in 'fitting' send-off\n\nShe shared: “We weren’t married very long. We were married when I first met you on Iron Man. He’s a good guy.”\n\nGwyneth fawned over the thought of Scarlett and Ryan together, declaring it “goals” and adding: “We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house.”\n\nScarlett has since been married to journalist Romain Dauriac, 41, for a brief three years before they divorced in 2017.\n\nNow the actress is in the throws of love with Saturday Night Live star Colin Jost, 40, as she shared another rare insight into her current marriage.\n\nShe revealed: “I’ve never probably been ready for a relationship like the one that I have with Colin at different times in my life because I wasn’t comfortable setting my own boundaries, I didn’t know not only what I wanted but what I needed from somebody else.\n\n“Obviously it’s hard to be in a relationship anyway because you have to compromise all the time but I never realised like it’s really important for me, I need to be with a compassionate person.\n\n“That’s a fundamental characteristic that has to be there and I think understanding what those fundamental things are that you need in a partner are a must for longevity.\n\n“That’s why it worked with Colin because I was finally able to step back and actually respect myself enough to know what those things were and be okay with it.”\n\nElsewhere in the podcast, Gwyneth and Scarlett addressed their alleged feud on the set of Iron Man 2 in 2010, which Scarlett was shocked was even a rumour.\n\nThe Black Widow star gushed: “You were so nice to me on that movie, I was so petrified.\n\n“I was so out of my comfort zone, I’d never done anything like that before. Plus you guys had established deep friendships.”\n\nGwyneth interjected, declaring that Scarlett’s presence was a more-than-welcomed addition to the group and she was “so happy to have another woman around”."
