        "text": "Colin Jost may be sleeping on the sofa moving forward.\n\nThe “Saturday Night Live” star cracked an offensive joke about his wife, Scarlett Johansson, in the “Weekend Update” segment during the Season 49 finale of NBC’s Emmy-winning late-night comedy series on Saturday.\n\n“ChatGBT has released a new voice assistant feature inspired by Scarlett Johansson’s AI character in ‘Her,'” Jost began while giggling.\n\n“Which I’ve never bothered to watch, because without that body, what’s the point of listening?”\n\nThe joke, which shocked the audience, was delivered during a traditional bit that requires Jost and co-host Michael Che to write offensive jokes for each other. They read the quips live on air without having seen them beforehand.\n\nObviously, Che set up the 41-year-old by making him take a dig at his wife. However, this wasn’t the first time Jost poked fun at the “Black Widow” star, to whom he’s been married since 2020.\n\nJust last month at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, Jost name-dropped Johansson, 39, while delivering an assessment of the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nThe “Tom & Jerry” actor put the actress on blast when he thanked her for “agreeing to individually meet everyone in this room” after the dinner. He then jokingly encouraged the crowd to “come right up” to her.\n\nIn January, Jost also shared a tongue-in-cheek skincare tutorial while testing out some of his wife’s skincare products — in a women’s bathroom.\n\nIn the clip titled “In the Women’s Bathroom with Colin Jost,” the “How to Be Single” actor repped his wife’s brand, The Outset, while telling the camera that he was “here in the office building where my wife allegedly works.”\n\nHe then went on to try various products from the line while cracking jokes along the way."
