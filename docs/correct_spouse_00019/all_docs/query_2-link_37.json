        "text": "In May 2017, Scarlett Johansson started dating Saturday Night Live comedian Colin Jost. Two years later, in May 2019, Scarlett Johansson's publicist confirmed to The Associated Press that she and Colin Jost were engaged.\n\nThe pair tied the knot in October 2020, as revealed by an Instagram post by Meals on Wheels. The duo often shares glimpses of their life together on social media, and they welcomed their first child, a son named Cosmo, in August 2021.\n\nColin Jost quickly rose to fame through his work on Saturday Night Live, joining the show as a writer in 2005 before becoming a \"Weekend Update\" co-anchor alongside Michael Che in 2014. His sharp wit and comedic timing have earned him multiple Emmy nominations and a loyal fan base. Additionally, Jost has ventured into film, making appearances in movies such as How to Be Single, and has even authored a memoir, A Very Punchable Face, detailing various moments in his life and career. Prior to his relationship with Johansson, Jost was linked to Parks and Recreation actress Rashida Jones.\n\nScarlett Johansson and French journalist Romain Dauriac started dating in late 2012 after being introduced by mutual friends, tattoo artist Fuzi Uvtpk. The couple remained largely private, but they made headlines in September 2013 when they announced their engagement. Johansson and Dauriac tied the knot in a secret ceremony in Montana in October 2014, shortly after welcoming their daughter, Rose Dorothy. However, their marriage came to an end in 2017, with the couple finalizing their divorce and settling custody issues amicably.\n\nRomain Dauriac gained fame for his work as a journalist and editor, predominantly in the realm of art and culture. He previously served as the editor of French urban art magazine Clark and later co-founded a creative advertising agency. Although not as widely known in the entertainment industry as some of Johansson's other partners, Dauriac's relationship and marriage to the actress skyrocketed him to a higher level of notoriety. Dauriac has since maintained a low profile, focusing on co-parenting his daughter with Johansson.\n\nDating from late 2011 until 2012, Scarlett Johansson's romance with ad executive Nate Naylor blossomed after being introduced through mutual friends. Despite the couple keeping a relatively low profile during their time together, they were occasionally spotted attending events and sharing public displays of affection. However, after less than a year together, the pair went their separate ways, citing long-distance challenges and demanding careers as the primary reasons for their breakup.\n\nNate Naylor rose to prominence as a successful advertising executive, working with high-profile clients and campaigns throughout his career. While not a household name in the world of entertainment, his relationship with Johansson catapulted him into the media spotlight. Since parting ways with the actress, Naylor has remained mostly out of the public eye and has continued to focus on his work in the advertising industry.\n\nScarlett Johansson and Sean Penn surprised the world when they began dating in early 2011. The pair met at a party hosted by director Spike Lee, and they were soon spotted spending time together at various events, including the White House Correspondents' Dinner and a vacation in Mexico. Though their whirlwind romance was brief, lasting only a few months, it generated considerable media attention due to the notable age difference between the two. The couple ultimately decided to call it quits, citing busy schedules and differing priorities.\n\nSean Penn is an acclaimed actor and filmmaker, boasting a career that spans over four decades. With two Academy Awards under his belt for his performances in Mystic River and Milk, Penn has solidified his status as one of Hollywood's elite. In addition to his accomplishments on screen, he's known for his philanthropic efforts, particularly in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Penn's romantic history is equally noteworthy, having previously been married to Madonna and Robin Wright, as well as being linked to a slew of other high-profile figures, including Charlize Theron.\n\nScarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds first crossed paths at a party in 2007, and it wasn't long before sparks flew between the two. By September, their relationship was in full swing, and they got engaged in May 2008. They married later that year in a private ceremony in British Columbia, Canada. However, after just two years of marriage, the couple announced their separation in December 2010, finalizing their divorce in July 2011. They cited irreconcilable differences and long periods apart due to work commitments as the primary reasons behind their split.\n\nRyan Reynolds is a highly accomplished actor, best known for his roles in films like The Proposal, Deadpool, and Free Guy. His charming personality and comedic talents have earned him legions of fans worldwide. In addition to his successful acting career, Reynolds has ventured into business, becoming a co-owner of Aviation Gin and Mint Mobile. Following his divorce from Johansson, Reynolds found love again and tied the knot with actress Blake Lively in 2012, with whom he shares three children.\n\nRumors swirled in 2007 about a possible romance between Scarlett Johansson and Justin Timberlake when the actress starred in Timberlake's music video for \"What Goes Around... Comes Around.\" The chemistry between the two was undeniable, but both parties insisted they were just friends. Nonetheless, speculation about their relationship status persisted, particularly when they were spotted spending time together following Timberlake's split from Jessica Biel in 2011. Despite the rumors, neither Johansson nor Timberlake ever confirmed a romantic relationship.\n\nJustin Timberlake rose to fame as a member of the hugely popular boy band *NSYNC before launching an incredibly successful solo music career, with hits like \"SexyBack,\" \"Cry Me A River,\" and \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\" Additionally, Timberlake has made a name for himself as an actor, starring in films like The Social Network, Friends with Benefits, and Inside Llewyn Davis. His love life has also been a topic of interest due in part to his high-profile relationships, which include Britney Spears, Cameron Diaz, and his now-wife, Jessica Biel, with whom he shares two children."
