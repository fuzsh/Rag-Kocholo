        "text": "Scarlett Johansson fans could be seeing a lot more of husband Colin Jost in the future.\n\nOn Monday night's episode of \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" Johannson joked that her husband made a cameo appearance in her upcoming movie, \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" because it was written in the prenup.\n\n\"Greg Berlanti was our director … [he’s] a huge fan of Colin’s,\" Johansson began. \"Colin … I think he had to do it ’cause it’s, like, in our prenuptial agreement.\"\n\nSCARLETT JOHANSSON AND COLIN JOST WALK THE OSCARS 2020 RED CARPET TOGETHER\n\nJohansson jokingly added, \"If I ask him to do something, he has to be there to support me. He has to be in every one of my films.\"\n\nJohansson and Jost, a comedian and writer best known for his work on \"Saturday Night Live,\" tied the knot in October 2020. In August 2021, the couple welcomed their first son, Cosmo.\n\nThe Marvel actress was previously married to actor Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011 and French journalist Romain Dauriac from 2014 to 2017. Dauriac and Johansson share a 6-year-old daughter, Rose. This is Jost's first marriage.\n\nJohansson previously gushed about Jost's marriage proposal. \"He did [do it in a romantic way], he killed it,\" she told Ellen DeGeneres in 2019. \"It was a very James Bond situation. It was surprising. He's got a lot behind that [\"Saturday Night Live\"] news desk he's hiding.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

It was very personal. It was a very special moment and I think more than anything, when someone tells you they want to share the rest of their life with you, it's a lovely, special thing.\"\n\nDuring her appearance on \"The Tonight Show,\" Johansson admitted that she sometimes turns to Jost to help her with her lines for films — but it does not always work out as planned.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\n\"I run lines with him,\" Johansson said of her husband. \"Which is great… you’d think that would be very convenient because you have a partner there to help you out. You learn your lines for tomorrow or whatever. He does, like, real serious… he really commits to the line reading.\"\n\nShe continued, \"It’s not always the performance I want it to be. I’m just like, ‘Say the lines!’ Big dramatic pauses. He gets really into it. I’m like, ‘I can’t focus. Forget it. I’ll just learn them myself.’\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJohansson and Channing Tatum star in \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" a film based on the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing, which is set to debut in theaters Friday."
