        "text": "Most people love Saturday Night Live because it brings the laughs. For Scarlett Johansson, 36, and Colin Jost, 39, however, SNL is more meaningful than that: It's the place where their love story began.\n\nThe couple first met while the actress appeared on the late-night sketch show nearly a decade ago. While it took some time for their paths to cross again, the wait was worth it: On October 29, 2020, Colin and Scarlett announced that they were married after three years of dating. What's more, the couple is reportedly expecting their first child together.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the couple's budding romance, including some of the sweetest moments they've shared on Saturday Night Live over the years.\n\nNovember 2010: Scarlett and Colin work closely together on SNL.\n\nThe two first connected while creating a parody sketch in 2010, though they were both in committed relationships with other actors at the time (Scarlett was married to Ryan Reynolds, and Colin Jost was dating Rashida Jones). Combining the popular MTV shows Teen Mom and My Super Sweet Sixteen, Scarlett hilariously played a teen mom giving birth at her birthday party.\n\nIt turns out, Colin wrote the SNL sketch. While sparks didn't fly between the two back then, his confidence and writing skills grabbed her attention. \"He seemed very confident at the time. I don't know if he felt that way, but in that environment, if you're not confident as a writer, your stuff just never gets produced,\" she reflected in The Hollywood Reporter in 2019.\n\nBut Colin remembers things a bit differently: The SNL star recalls working with the actress in 2006. \"The first time she hosted was the first year I was a writer on the show,\" Colin told Entertainment Tonight. \"So, we've kind of known each other since then ... she's the best.\"\n\nSummer 2017: The pair starts quietly dating.\n\nAfter reports that fellow SNL star Kate McKinnon set them up, Colin and Scarlett were spotted on a date in July 2017. This was just a few months after Scarlett divorced her second husband, Romain Dauriac.\n\nSeptember 2017: Colin publicly discusses their relationship.\n\nAll eyes — and ears — were on Colin when he walked the red carpet at the 2017 Emmys. When asked about his reported relationship with Scarlett, the \"Weekend Update\" co-host gushed to Entertainment Tonight: \"She's wonderful. She's working, so otherwise, she'd be here. She's pretty cool ... It's hard to have a lot of complaints, she's pretty awesome.\"\n\nA few months later, the couple made their first public appearance together at the American Museum of Natural History Gala.\n\nThings really became official when the two were spotted holding hands during Kevin Hart's closing monologue in December of that year. Earlier that night, Scarlett reprised her role as Ivanka Trump in a now-viral sketch.\n\nMay 2019: The couple confirms their engagement.\n\nAfter nearly two years of dating, Scarlett's publicist confirmed that the pair was engaged. Even though they've kept most of their relationship private (aside from the occasional red carpet walks), Scarlett couldn't help but share details of the exciting moment with Ellen DeGeneres. \"He killed it. He did a whole James Bond situation. He's got a lot behind that news desk that he's hiding,\" she said. \"More than anything, when someone tells you they want to spend the rest of their life with you, it's a lovely and special thing.\"\n\nThe actress debuted her engagement ring at Comic-Con in July 2019. The 11-carat ring, which was designed by James de Givenchy of Taffin, is reportedly worth $450,000.\n\nDecember 2019: Scarlett confesses Colin is \"the love of my life\" on SNL.\n\nAnd now, for the moment everyone's been waiting for: While hosting SNL, Scarlett gave a sweet shoutout to her husband-to-be — and to the show itself for being the reason why they ended up together. \"I just want to say that this place means so much to me. I have so many friends here and I met the love of my life here,\" Scarlett said.\n\nOctober 2020: Scarlett and Colin get married.\n\nLike many other couples, Scarlett and Colin had to postpone their wedding due to the coronavirus pandemic. After months of waiting, the pair decided to move forward with an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and loved ones. The couple announced their marriage in a clever way: They let Meals on Wheels America share the big news in an Instagram post, urging followers to consider donating to the cause to celebrate the happy couple.\n\nJust weeks before, Colin opened up about their wedding plans, telling Ellen DeGeneres that he hopes his \"Weekend Update\" co-anchor Michael Che objects during the ceremony. \"That's part of why we've just been postponing it. We can see him getting ready for the wedding, and we're like maybe we should wait another day,\" he said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. \"I want to ask him to do an objection at the wedding. A lot of people do speeches, but I think it would be nice in that moment, so few people utilize that moment to object.\" It's still unknown if Colin's wish came true.\n\nJuly 2021: Scarlett and Colin are reportedly expecting a baby.\n\nPage Six, citing multiple sources, confirmed on July 6 that Scarlett and Colin are expecting their first child together. One \"insider\" claimed, \"Scarlett is pregnant but has been keeping it very quiet. She has been keeping a very low profile.\" Other sources alleged that this is the reason Scarlett has been skipping so many in-person premiere and promotional events for her big summer movie Black Widow."
