        "text": "Actress Scarlett Johansson married comedian Colin Jost in October 2020. Since then, the couple’s personal life has been a hot topic among fans, given their individual popularity and fame from before they tied the knot. While discussing her married life with Jost, Johansson revealed some secrets from behind closed doors, including a bizarre fetish of her husband of three years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview, Johansson stated that it does not take much for her to get Jost amused. The actress revealed her husband enjoys the different voices she can cook up. Given the strange source of Jost’s amusement with Johansson’s voice, fans might be curious to learn about its true nature. Here is what Scarlett Johansson has said about her husband Colin Jost’s voice fetish.\n\nAlso read: What Did Scarlett Johansson Say About the Reason Behind Her Divorce With Ryan Reynolds?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScarlett Johansson Reveals Husband Colin Jost Has a Voice Fetish\n\nIn November 2021, Scarlett Johansson became the 35th recipient of the American Cinematheque Award. While walking the red carpet at the award ceremony, Johansson spoke with People about her then-newly married life with her husband, Colin Jost. During the chat, Johansson was asked what was sure to crack up her comedian husband.\n\n“I’m sure I have all kinds of weird voices that I probably do. He’s a sucker for a creepy, weird voice or a strange, far-away stare or smile.”\n\nJohansson made the above statement, explaining the simple trick she uses to get Jost laughing. The Saturday Night Live star’s amusement with his wife’s voice is understandable since Johansson has demonstrated a wide range of voice acting skills during her career. Her soulful and soothing voice as the AI Samantha in Spike Jonze’s Her left a strong impression on viewers. Meanwhile, Johansson also voices the treacherous snake Kaa in 2016’s The Jungle Book.\n\nAlso read: “It’ll keep coming back, s*ck your blood”: Scarlett Johansson Hit Rock Bottom in an Awful Relationship With a Mystery Ex-boyfriend\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScarlett Johansson Does Not Find Colin Jost Funny at Home\n\nWhile Scarlett Johansson’s voice acting range is proof enough to understand Colin Jost’s fascination and amusement with her creepy and weird voices, the same cannot be said for the comedian. During an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show in 2022, Johansson was asked whether her husband could get her to crack up with his jokes.\n\nAlso read: “He can get, like, very in his head sometimes”: Scarlett Johansson Reveals Colin Jost’s One Trait That Makes Their Marriage Work\n\nConsidering Jost is one of the funniest faces on television’s most popular variety comedy series, making his wife laugh should not be difficult for him. However, Johansson revealed during her conversation with Clarkson that Jost often uses her as a test subject for his new jokes. However, Johansson stated she often does not find her husband funny at home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“He’ll love a play on words or a pun, and it’s just really … they used to be just kind of duds, and now they’re dad jokes.”\n\nUltimately, Johansson is not a fan of dad jokes, even if they are from her husband. As a result, it seems like his wife’s voice easily amuses Jost, while it takes an effort for the comedian to make her laugh. Nontheless, Johansson and Jost have been happily married for three years now. They also welcomed their first son together in August 2021."
