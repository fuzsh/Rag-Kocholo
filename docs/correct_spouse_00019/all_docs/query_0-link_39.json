        "text": "Scarlett Johansson is sharing the lessons she's learned from her romantic past just in time for the release of her marriage-themed movie The Marriage Story.\n\nIn a new interview with Vanity Fair, the Marvel actor opened up about her three-year marriage to Ryan Reynolds, explaining to the magazine that she wasn't prepared at the time for that kind of relationship.\n\n\"The first time I got married I was 23 years old,” Johansson said. “I didn’t really have an understanding of marriage.” She added, “Maybe I kind of romanticized it, I think, in a way.\"\n\nIt's easy to forget that these two were ever even an item—they divorced in 2011—considering they are both halves of beloved Hollywood power couples. Reynolds went on to marry Blake Lively, with whom he shares three children. And Johansson recently got engaged to Saturday Night Live star Colin Jost.\n\nBut it doesn't appear that Johansson has any ill will toward her ex. Instead, she simply looks back on that time of her life as a growth period.\n\n\"It’s a different part of my life now,\" she said. \"I feel like I’m in a place in my life, I feel I’m able to make more active choices. I’m more present, I think, than I’ve been before.”\n\nThe 35-year-old also isn't jaded about the institution of marriage despite being divorced twice. (She was also married to French Journalist Romain Dauria. The two share a five-year-old daughter, Rose.)\n\n“The idea of building a family, making a family, and having that work, I like that idea,” the actor said. “I think that would be wonderful. I’ve always wanted that. I wanted that also in my marriage to my daughter’s father as well. It just wasn’t the right person. But I like that idea.”"
