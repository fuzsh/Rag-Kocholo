HARRISBURG, Pa. (3/30/23) – On March 29, 2023, The YWCA of Greater Harrisburg hosted its 34th Annual Tribute to Women of Excellence at the Hershey Lodge to honor outstanding women in professional and executive positions for contributions to their community. Jade Honey, 2022 HYP President, introduced Meghan Bachmore for her award.

“Meghan embodies the characteristics of a true servant leader, something many don’t achieve under forty, let alone thirty,” Honey said.

The distinctive title of “Woman of Excellence” is bestowed on women who are active in the community as mentors, role models, and volunteers, serve on boards or committees of various nonprofit organizations, demonstrate integrity, strength of character and leadership, raise and donate money to important causes, and embrace the mission and vision of the YWCA. The Emerging Leader Award recognizes the efforts of women under the age of 30 on behalf of the community, particularly with regard to mentoring younger girls.

Meghan reflected on her time as Executive Director of HYP.

“Over the last year, I have met some of the strongest leaders our community has to offer, who have spent generous amounts of time ensuring I felt assured, confident, and capable in my role as Executive Director. “

Proceeds from the event go towards supporting the YWCA’s mission. The YWCA Greater Harrisburg is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women, and promoting peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all.

This event was sponsored by Highmark and hosted at the Hershey Lodge.
