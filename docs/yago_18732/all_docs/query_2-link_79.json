        "text": "About the Keynote:\n\nWhat would you do if you knew you could not fail? Chasing Failure is all about having a vision for a dream, a goal, a mission, and knowing that the road will be paved with failure, but still proceeding with conviction and passion. This is what sets those who succeed beyond measure, from those who simply exist. The fear of failure will keep you inside a box, stall innovation, and make sure you hesitate anytime you even think about taking a risk that could help you achieve goals beyond your wildest dreams. As leadership expert Ryan Leak shares, you don’t actually have to get over the fear. Just do it scared and take really good notes.\n\nWhen you’re Chasing Failure, you’re either going to win or you’re going to learn. Hopefully, both will happen. Ryan shares the blueprint for success by giving you an approach to see what the predictable failures might be, so you can circumvent those more easily, or deal with them more effectively when they arise.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nHow chasing failure will take you further than chasing success.\n\nA roadmap to the discipline needed to succeed through failure.\n\nUnderstanding how to become today who you intend to be tomorrow.\n\nAbout Ryan:\n\nRyan Leak is a best-selling author, esteemed executive coach, and a highly sought-after transformational speaker.
