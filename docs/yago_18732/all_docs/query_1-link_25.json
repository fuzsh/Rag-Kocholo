        "text": "An ex-crack cocaine user testified this afternoon that she was terrified when Harrisburg drug dealer Daniel C. Harris told her he shot someone in February.\n\nThat someone, authorities say, was Matthew Harrell, who died in a city crack house from three bullet wounds on Feb. 20.\n\nLindsey Moyer told a Dauphin County jury on the third day of Harris' murder trial that Harris was agitated when she got into a car with him soon after Harrell's slaying.\n\n“He was really wasted,” Moyer said. “He said, ‘Some (expletive) went down at Chuck’s place and I just shot somebody.'”\n\nHarrell, 45, was killed at a Thompson Street drug den rented by Chuck Long.\n\nSenior Deputy District Attorney Johnny Baer is seeking a first-degree murder conviction and life prison sentence for Harris. Baer claims Harris shot Harrell during an argument over stolen drugs.\n\nDefense attorney Gary Kelley is arguing that police did a shoddy investigation and arrested the wrong man.\n\nMoyer’s testimony was matter-of-fact.\n\nThe 29-year-old East Shore woman said she began using crack when she was 15, but claimed she has been clean for months.\n\nShe met Harris, whose street name is “D Block,” in a city alley a day or two before Harrell’s murder, Moyer said.\n\nShe said they struck a deal for him to use her car and pay her in crack. That common transaction is called a “fiend float,” Moyer said, explaining that the “fiend” is an addict and the “float” is a vehicle.\n\nMoyer said she loaned Harris her car the night Harrell was killed. He didn’t pick her up later at a bar as arranged, she said, so she went looking and found him and the car at 14th and Derry streets.\n\nA “Spanish” man she didn’t know was in the car with Harris, who was drunk and had a pistol in his lap, she said.\n\nWhen she started yelling at him, she said Harris told her, “Just settle down. You don’t know what happened.” Then he told her he shot someone, she said.\n\nMoyer said Harris also showed her a large bleach stain on his shirt, implying that he’d used bleach to remove a blood stain.\n\n“How did he appear to you?” Baer asked.\n\n“Distraught,” Moyer replied. “I think he was a little scared about what he just did.”\n\nShe said she told Harris to take her home, where he passed out on her floor. He finally left and she didn’t see him again.\n\nMoyer said she didn’t ask Harris for details about what happened.\n\n“I didn’t want to know,” she said. “I wasn’t raised around people like this, you know.”\n\nOn cross-examination, Kelley attacked Moyer’s credibility, noting for example that she didn’t at first tell police that Harris was drunk. Moyer insisted that although she had been using crack and drinking beer the night of the slaying, she was aware of what was going on.\n\nCity Detective Ryan Neal said Long and another key prosecution witness, Tandras Jones, identified Harris as the killer from a photo lineup.\n\nKelley quizzed Neal on the meaning of the street phrase, “I caught a body,” which Harris used in texting an ex-girlfriend soon after Harrell was shot.\n\nNeal said the phrase refers to a murder.\n\nKelley presented evidence from the Urban Dictionary, a reference for street slang. The dictionary’s first definition did refer to murder, but a second said the phrase also can refer to having sex with a woman.\n\n“Have you ever heard it used in a context other than murder?” Baer asked Neal.\n\n“No,” the detective said.\n\nTestimony is expected to conclude Thursday morning, after which Judge Richard A. Lewis will send the case to the jury."
