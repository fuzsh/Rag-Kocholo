        "text": "Pennsylvania's House Republican leaders — accusing Democratic colleagues of an \"illegal\" power grab and \"paperwork insurrection\" — are seeking the ouster of their chamber's chief clerk.\n\nState Rep. Dawn Keefer (R-Cumberland/York) said Wednesday afternoon that she's introducing a resolution to remove House Chief Clerk Brooke Wheeler. Keefer and other Republicans leaders are accusing Wheeler of a \"secret\" swearing in ceremony for state Rep. Joanna McClinton (D-Delaware/Philadelphia) as new House majority leader even after the GOP caucus advised her that the composition of the political body is, at minimum, tied.\n\nThe authority standoff, and resulting attempt to oust the House's chief clerk, foreshadow what could be an especially contentious legislative session in 2023.\n\nWho has the majority in the PA House?\n\nAt issue is what constitutes a majority in the chamber. Democrats say they hold a narrow 102-101 advantage after the midterms.\n\nNot so fast, say House Republicans.\n\nGOP leaders point out that state Rep. Tony DeLuca (D-Allegheny) died Oct. 9, before his re-election but after the deadline to remove his name from the ballot, following a lymphoma diagnosis. Even without the resignations of state Reps. Austin Davis and Summer Lee — incumbent Democrats who were elected to higher office — Republicans are arguing that the divide is even at 101-101.\n\n“While admitting three vacancies exist by calling special elections in the 32nd, 34th and 35th districts, vacancies that gives Republicans a 101-99 majority in the House, Democrats are creating internal confusion by simultaneously speciously alleging they have a fake, gerrymandered majority that has the authority to conduct the business of the House,\" state Rep. Bryan Cutler (R-Lancaster), House Republican leader, said in a press release.\n\n“Instead of working cooperatively to navigate the unique circumstances before us, House Democrats have instead set a terrible precedent for what to expect over the next two years and beyond. Moreover, they have started this session with a sad waste of time and resources that is reminiscent of the failed petty conduct their caucus has been engaging in for the better part of the last decade.”\n\nHouse Republican Caucus spokesperson Jason Gottesman shared an opinion from the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau, also suggesting that the Democrats' victory lap is premature.\n\n\"Under current law, an individual must at least be elected and living to qualify as a member of the legislative caucus,\" associate counsel Peter Klein wrote in a non-binding advisory opinion. \"The Democratic Party won 102 House elections at the November 2022 general election, but the House Democratic Caucus is able to seat only 101 members due to the death of member-elect Anthony DeLuca. The House Democratic Caucus falls short of the 102 members necessary for a majority.\"\n\nPast political battle: GOP senators remove Fetterman as Senate president, Capitol devolves into partisan fight\n\nWhen are the PA special elections?\n\nMcClinton, meanwhile, has said that she's already scheduled the special elections to replace DeLuca, Davis and Lee for Feb. 7.\n\n“To ensure every Pennsylvanian has representation and to restore the state House to its full complement as quickly as possible, I set the special elections for early February,” McClinton said. “By having all three elections on the same day, hopefully we can maximize voter awareness and participation.”\n\nBut Cutler has claimed the authority to schedule special elections still rests with him and has issued his own writ to fill the vacancy in DeLuca's district. The state department has rejected Cutler's writ, saying it was filed prematurely.\n\nNicole Reigelman, McClinton's press secretary, dismissed the GOP's maneuvers. She accused Cutler of spreading \"inaccuracies\" about the process and McClinton's efforts to communicate with him through the transition.\n\n\"For the third time in as many years, House Republican leaders are actively working to disenfranchise voters and change the outcomes of elections by taking extraordinary action to hold onto power despite having lost the majority in the Nov. 8 election,\" Reigelman said.\n\nAre PA Republicans poised to sue?\n\nThe dispute over the legitimacy of McClinton's appointment as House Majority leader and the effort to oust Wheeler compound a litany of political battles in the Capitol that have recently included a GOP-led attempt to impeach the Democratic district attorney of Philadelphia. Gottesman declined to confirm whether litigation on the leadership spat was forthcoming.\n\n“Constitutional officers hold dispassionate, non-partisan positions of public trust and confidence,\" Keefer said. \"By aiding House Democrats in their illegal behavior and picking sides, Chief Clerk Wheeler has broken that trust and destroyed that confidence. She is no longer fit to serve in her position, and I will be introducing this resolution seeking her removal.\"\n\nIn a letter to Cutler and McClinton, Wheeler described being caught in a situation of \"unprecedented complexity.\"\n\nShe wrote that she's not taking a position on which legislative leader has control of the chamber — explaining that she signed Cutler's and McClinton's special election writs as a witness and was not picking sides in the ongoing power struggle.\n\n\"I submit only that at the time of my signature of attestation on Leader Cutler's writ, Leader Cutler purported to have the authority to issue the writ as Speaker of the House of Representatives,\" she wrote. \"Likewise, at the time of my signature of attestation on Leader McClinton's writ, Leader McClinton purported to have the authority to issue the writ as Majority Leader of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nBruce Siwy is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network's Pennsylvania state capital bureau.
