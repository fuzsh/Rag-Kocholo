        "text": "The Harrisburg City Council is the legislative branch of the city government of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and consists of seven members elected at-large.[1] The council president is elected by the council members and presides over city council meetings. In the event of illness or absence of the president, the vice president presides over the meetings. Each member's term is four years, serving part-time. There are no limits on the number of terms a member may serve.[1]\n\nLegislative process\n\n[edit]\n\nEvery proposed ordinance is initially in the form of a resolution introduced by a council member. Before a resolution can be enacted, it must be referred by the president of the council to an appropriate standing committee, considered at a public hearing and meeting, reported out by the committee, printed as reported by the committee, distributed to the members of the council, and made available to the public. Passage of a bill requires the favorable vote of a majority of all members. A resolution becomes law upon the approval of the mayor. If the mayor vetoes a bill, the council may override the veto by a two-thirds vote. City Council also confirms all department directors and certain other mayoral appointees.[1]\n\nCity Council considers and evaluates legislative concerns consisting of committees on:[1]\n\nAdministration\n\nBudget and Finance\n\nBuilding and Housing\n\nCommunity and Economic Development\n\nChildren and Youth\n\nParks and Recreation\n\nPublic Safety\n\nPublic Works\n\nCity Council members\n\n[edit]\n\nThe City Council members as of August 2024 are:[2]\n\nName Took office Term expires Party Danielle Bowers† October 9, 2018 January 2028 Dem Jocelyn Rawls January 3, 2022 January 5, 2026 Dem Crystal Davis January 2, 2024 January 2028 Dem Ausha Green January 2, 2018 January 5, 2026 Dem Ralph Rodriguez January 3, 2022 January 5, 2026 Dem Lamont Jones January 2, 2024 January 2028 Dem Shamaine Daniels 2014 January 5, 2026 Dem\n\nKey to Chart\n\n† President of Council\n\nFormer members\n\n[edit]\n\nName Took office Left office Party Gloria Martin-Roberts 2004 2012 Dem Patty Kim 2004 2012 Dem Eugenia G.
