        "text": "Alter Names\n\nThe same person can appear under different names in public records. Quite often, people use short versions of their name (i.e. Randy vs. Randolph), sometimes they use their name’s international variations (Victor/Vittore). It is quite rare but still happens that a person can be found being listed under a completely different name.\n\nAlter Name Full NamePersons Count ?Share ?
