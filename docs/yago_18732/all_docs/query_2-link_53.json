Boyle (PA-13) released the following statement ahead of President Trump's scheduled appearance in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania:\n\n\"When President Trump visits Pennsylvanians, he better be ready to explain why he's pushing a disastrous tax reform plan that could jack up their taxes by $11,000 a year – all so the President's wealthy and well-connected buddies can pocket billions. They have a right to know why healthcare premiums could go up nearly $6,000 in our commonwealth under Trumpcare, putting affordable care out of reach for so many working families. For all his campaign promises, why hasn't the President passed a single piece of legislation to address our crumbling infrastructure, or raise wages, or create quality jobs in our country? Pennsylvania wants answers, Mr. President.\""
