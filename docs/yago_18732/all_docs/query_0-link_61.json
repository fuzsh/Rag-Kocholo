Some few of the farmers sold eggs at 65 and 68 cents, and western and storage eggs could be bought a few cents cheaper .\n\nThe long cold spell is blamed for the high prices from now on they should be some cheaper.

President Wilson's address to Congress brought about considerable selling of grain today, chiefly by dealers who drew quick inference that the outlook for an early peace had been improved.

As measured in terms of security values, Wall Street did not take kindly to president's comprehensive statement of war aims as set forth in his unexpected message to Congress today. Stocks declined. The address as viewed by financial interests, offered little hope of an early solution of the many grave problems now engaging the attention of this country and its associates in the war. Previous to its delivery--in fact, throughout the forenoon and during the early midsession--prices were one to three points higher in the several groups of peace and war shares and considerably higher in certain specialties .\n\nFor example, American Tobacco made an extreme gain of 14 points, presumably in connection with the stated retention of its existing div dend rate and Texas Company advanced points. Various other speculative issues received much of their upward 1m- pulse from the decision of the Supreme Court setting aside the Fed. eral income tax on stock dividends. Immediately after publication of the salient features of the president's address the list began to sell off. reacting two to five points under lead of United States Steel and investment rails .\n\nThe decline was desultory at first, but became general in the last hour, the market showing little recuperative power at the close. Sales amounted to 775.000 shares. A very large proportion of the day's irregular operations en the bonds centered around the Liberty issues, the selling at 98.88 to 98.76 the first 4's or converted at 97.84 to 97.78, and the second 3's at 96.66 to the new 10 wrecord of 96.26. Total sales of bonds, par value, aggregated $4,850,000. LOCAL BUSINESS NOTES Blast was taken off Robesonia furnace, thus ending its first run since it was rebuilt in 1915 .\n\nIt has been in blast continuously for almost 27 months. except when banked tor short periods for lack of coke. The shut-down was due to the necessity of relining. When rebuilt the furnace was lined with what is known as a semi-thin lining, which was expected to last 18 months to two years, so that the length of the blast was most agreeable to the management. The for iron is so great that work will be pushed night and day, and the furnace started again at the earliest possible date .\n\nThe capacity of the furnace is 1,200 tons.
