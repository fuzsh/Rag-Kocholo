        "text": "HARRISBURG (WPVI) -- Former President Donald Trump held a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday.\n\nIt was his first event in the Keystone State since the attempted assassination on July 13.\n\n\"As you know, this is my first return to Pa. since our rally in Butler. We're going back to Butler too,\" said Trump at the Farm Show complex.\n\nTrump launched into remarks criticizing Biden-Harris policies, focusing on the border and public safety.\n\n\"They're letting horrible people into our country. They are poisoning our country by contrast. If I'm elected, on day 1 we will begin the largest deportation in American history,\" the former president said.\n\nTrump also touched on his near assassination, taking a moment of silence for Corey Comperatore -- the man shot and killed at the Butler rally. Trump and two others were also injured by the shooting.\n\nMany of those in attendance Wednesday were also at the Butler rally. Others felt compelled to come because of the tragic day.\n\n\"It's one of the reasons I'm here -- to support him and let everyone know they're not going to scare us off. Even a bullet won't stop us,\" said Valerie Mansberger, of Newville.\n\n\"After what happened there with the assassination attempt, I knew I had to come,\" added Ryan Morris, of New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nThe visit comes with most polls showing the race between him and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris remains tight.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris and her future running mate will crisscross the country together next week, a source familiar confirmed to ABC News.\n\nHer campaign confirmed that she will first stop in Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nSources say other stops include western Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nAccording to ABC News, six officials are on the vice president shortlist, including Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.\n\nTrump questions Harris' race in NABJ interview\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump's interview at the National Association of Black Journalists annual convention in Chicago kicked off with a contentious start as he falsely questioned Vice President Kamala Harris' race.\n\nThroughout the appearance, Trump went on to say his vice presidential pick \"does not have any impact\" on the election. He also said he would pardon Jan. 6 rioters who assaulted police officers \"if they're innocent.\"\n\nABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner and Semafor political reporter Kadia Goba interviewed Trump on stage at the event.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump questions Harris' race in NABJ interview in Chicago, says VP pick 'does not have any impact'\n\nThe first question came from ABC's Scott, who asked about Trump's past inflammatory rhetoric toward women of color.\n\n\"I want to start by addressing the elephant in the room, sir. A lot of people did not think it was appropriate for you to be here today,\" Scott said. \"You have pushed false claims about some of your rivals, from Nikki Haley to former President Barack Obama, saying that they were not born in the United States, which is not true. You have told four congressmen, women of color, who were American citizens, to go back to where they came from. You have used words like 'animal' and 'rabbit' to describe Black district attorneys. You've attacked Black journalists, calling them a 'loser,' saying the questions that they ask are, 'stupid and racist.' You've had dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar a Lago resort.\"\n\n\"So, my question, sir, now that you are asking Black supporters to vote for you, why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that?\" Scott asked.\n\n\"Well, first of all, I don't think I've ever been asked a question. So, in such a horrible manner, a first question. You don't even say hello. Who are you? Are you with ABC? Because I think they're a fake news network. A terrible network,\" Trump began.\n\nWhen ABC's Scott followed up by asking him to answer her question, Trump responded: \"I have answered the question. I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\nThe former president went on to mock Harris and when asked about Republican comments that she is a \"DEI\" hire, Trump deflected -- asking the journalist instead to define DEI, which she did repeatedly.\n\nTrump also appeared to question Harris' race.\n\n\"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now, she wants to be known as Black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?\" Trump said.\n\nHarris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother.\n\nNew Pennsylvania poll\n\nA new survey of 600 likely Pennsylvania voters by Susquehanna Polling & Research puts Harris in front by four percentage points in the state.\n\nSusquehanna was among the most accurate pollsters in Pennsylvania in 2020.\n\nFox News polls released last week showed Harris and Trump statistically tied in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, improvements from Biden's standing in the three states.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Biden had 46% support from senior voters and 33% support from white voters without a college degree. Harris matched him among voters 65 years old and up and saw support from white voters without a degree jump to 41% since April. Biden took 40% support among men and 36% support among white men, numbers that jumped to 45% and 42% for Harris, respectively. Biden took 28% support among self-identified independents, a figure that rose to 30% for Harris."
