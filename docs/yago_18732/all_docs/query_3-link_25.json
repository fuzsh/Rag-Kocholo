        "text": "Jerene “Jerry” Mae (Shelly) Crist\n\nAwesome Mom & Grandma -\n\nJerene “Jerry” Mae (Shelly) Crist, age 99, of Dillsburg , and formerly of Lower Allen Township , died on Wednesday, July 9, 2014 at her home. Jerry was born on Thursday, November 12, 1914 in Newport to the late William Cleveland Shelly and Agnes Pearle (Knouse) Shelly. Jerry was the widow of Russell C. Crist, whom she married on December 5, 1946, and who died on October 12, 1989. In addition to her parents and husband, Jerry is preceded in death by her son, Russell L. Crist, and her seven siblings.\n\nJerry’s survivors include her children: Linda Welshans of Mechanicsburg, Nancy I. Miller of Richmond, VA, Bonnie J. Anthony and her husband, Larry, of Dillsburg; her ten grandchildren; her eleven great-grandchildren; her two great-great-grandchildren; her sister, Bertha Troutman, of Boiling Springs; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nJerry was a woman ahead of her time. She drove and jockeyed semi-trucks from Harrisburg to Philadelphia. Jerry was a very strong woman, who worked at the Camp Hill Bake Shop in Lemoyne, and only stopped working to take care of her extremely ill husband. She was an awesome mom and grandma who always seemed to be smiling and happy. Jerry’s whole face would smile when anybody entered her room.\n\nAll are welcome to join Jerry’s family at her viewing on Tuesday, July 15, 2014, from 10:00 a.m. until time of service at 11:00 a.m. at Myers - Buhrig Funeral Home and Crematory , 37 East Main Street, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055, with Pastor George A. Spangler officiating. Burial will follow in Woodlawn Memorial Gardens in Harrisburg.\n\nThe family suggests memorial contributions to Homeland Hospice , 2300 Vartan Way, Suite 115, Harrisburg, PA 17110."
