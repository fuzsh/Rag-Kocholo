Then there are HERO leaders—those who go beyond providing free coffee in the office or giving 10 percent of proceeds to charity. This book is for the leaders, entrepreneurs, and small business owners who understand what Henry Ford meant when he said, “a business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.” Hero leaders make money, but they also create a culture in which people are the priority. Hero leaders not only go the extra mile—they take their teams along for the ride.\n\nThe call to hero leadership is a choice to be more than good, more than great, no matter the circumstances. Becoming a hero is a conscious choice leaders and companies make: to decide what you value and hold yourself accountable to live those values consistently and sustainably in everything you do. There is no better time than now to discover your own hero factor. And your origin story begins now.\n\nLearn how to:\n\n- Invest in people as a path to more inclusion\n\n- Recast the role of business leadership beyond politics\n\n- Serve others/the common good\n\n- Avoid failure, reasons why not, and the lure of the dark side when things get tough\n\n- Know the line between hero and martyr\n\n- Create the next generation of hero leaders\n\nGlobal business celebrity and prime-time TV & Radio Host, Jeffrey W.

Drawing upon his own business back stories including his time as CMO of Kodak and sharing examples from the many leaders featured on “The C-Suite with Jeffrey Hayzlett,” Hayzlett imparts ten core lessons that dare readers to own who they are as a leader and/or company, define where they want to go, and fearlessly do what it takes to get there—caring less about conventional wisdom, re-framing limitations, and steamrolling obstacles as they go.\n\nJeffrey Hayzlett is a big, boisterous guy who has the guts to get in your face and tell you exactly why your business isn't doing well. In short, he asks the questions that most business managers are afraid to ask. And as Jeff points out, if you aren't willing to look at what's working and what isn't - and then take the necessary steps to fix them -- well, you and your colleagues and employees are in for a tough ride.\n\nKnown for his outspoken appearances on numerous TV reality shows…\n\nJeffrey Hayzlett is a big, boisterous guy who has the guts to get in your face and tell you exactly why your business isn't doing well.

THE MIRROR TEST, named in Inc. Magazine's top 3 Biz Books, 2010, and Fast Company 's Best Books for Business Owners, 2010, will teach readers -- through entertaining and timely anecdotes -- how to thoughtfully yet aggressively evaluate, deconstruct, and then reconstruct one's business..\n\nIn his unique, confrontational manner, Hayzlett will coach small business owners and managers on topics such as:\n\n- Give your business the mirror test - is your company really breathing?\n\n- Here's how you and your company must adapt...or die.\n\n- The bottom line of your business really is... your bottom line. You have to focus on it.\n\nHayzlett's big booming approach is direct and to the point, but done so with a smile on his face. Chock full of inspirational business stories and insights from his own career, Hayzlett and THE MIRROR TEST comprise a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWhat’s stopping you from making the changes your business needs to thrive? The most dangerous move in business is the\n\nfailure to make a move at all. The history of business is filled with companies that are no more because their leaders refused to enact change when the writing was on the wall. Fear. Apathy. Lack of personal responsibility. These simple human flaws can turn a good company into a dead company.\n\nThe writing on the wall has never been clearer than it is now—and marketing…\n\nWhat’s stopping you from making the changes your business needs to thrive?
