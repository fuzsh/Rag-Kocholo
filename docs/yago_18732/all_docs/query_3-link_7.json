        "text": "Running political campaigns is never easy, and in the ever-changing landscape of operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, many on the job have been forced to adapt the tried-and-true approaches to typical campaign work. Much of it has become digital in many ways, pressing the top firms to find new efficiencies and make up for the personal touch lacking in COVID-era campaigns. Pennsylvania’s top political consultants include a variety of old and new, as well as national and local firms working to get candidates elected all across the commonwealth.\n\nIt didn’t escape our notice that the final roster for this list is light on diversity in virtually every sense of the word. It’s dominated by straight, white, middle-aged men. But no matter how you slice it, right now, this is an accurate reflection of the most powerful people in this arena.\n\nOur rankings are determined by the recent political consulting work done on behalf of candidates across Pennsylvania, factoring in wins and losses in statewide and local races and the campaign spending and prominence of candidates. City & State reached out to each operative on the list to learn their top clients and biggest accomplishments. Some shared, others passed, and we filled in the rest with our own research and reviews of public filings.\n\nHere are the 2022 Political Consultants Power 50.\n\n1. Ray Zaborney\n\nFounder, Red Maverick Media\n\nRay Zaborney has served as an adviser to some of Pennsylvania's top political leaders for more than 15 years.

Known in Republican circles as a results-driven political strategist, Zaborney is credited with helping a sizable chunk of GOP members win seats in the House and Senate.\n\nKey clients: Jake Corman, Dan Meuser, John Joyce, John DiSanto, Mike Regan, Frank Farry, Larry Hogan, Senate Republican Campaign Committee, House Republican Campaign Committee, Congressional Leadership Fund, Henry McMaster, Chris Christie (2016 SuperPAC)\n\nBiggest accomplishment:\n\n“Helping Megan Sullivan win statewide judicial seat and helping to launch Jake Corman’s gubernatorial campaign.”\n\n2.

The Pennsylvania Council on the Arts and the Susquehanna Arts Museum are among her affiliations.\n\nKey clients:\n\nJake Corman, Corbett for Governor, Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy\n\nBiggest accomplishment:\n\n“Jen worked to help launch the campaign of Senate President Jake Corman for Governor and continues to serve as an advisor to the campaign.”\n\n3.

For the Supreme Court election in Pennsylvania last year, the team led an independent expenditure campaign.\n\nKnown as a \"top campaign operative,\" Mike DeVanney managed Bill Scranton's 2006 gubernatorial campaign and created advertising that won multiple Pollie and Reed awards. Together, Harris and DeVanney have run campaigns ranging from local elections to presidential super PACs to a one-time very costly bid for the U.S. Senate.

Chris Gebhard and Westmoreland County District Attorney Nicole Ziccarelli, both of whom went on to win their most recent races.\n\nAs the former top aide to the Republican Senate majority in the State Senate, Todd Nyquist could be considered the main driver of growing the Republican majority and making sure that it continued to function. As a staff administrator for the Senate Republican Caucus, Nyquist kept a close eye on legislative, budgetary and personnel issues before co-founding Long Nyquist & Associates with Long.
