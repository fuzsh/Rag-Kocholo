        "text": "Una Martone has articulated that her purpose in life is “to help people see their best so that they can be their best!” She considers herself fortunate to fulfill this purpose through Leadership Harrisburg Area where she has served as President & CEO since 2007. Highlights of Una’s tenure with LHA include the creation of Beyond Leadership, a curriculum on servant leadership that she conceived, created, and has delivered to hundreds of people since 2015. Una is also responsible for the addition of the Alumni Circle Enrichment Series, Board Strong, The Color Code, and an original Diversity, Equity & Inclusion training program that has reached over 6,000 people since 2020. Una created the first and only community-wide volunteer fair which has been executed by three consecutive CLS classes serving more than 100 non profit organizations (unduplicated). All told, LHA’s profile has increased under Una’s leadership – a measured 500% increase with an outreach of over 6,500 people each year. Una’s love of curriculum development is accompanied by a focus on community partnerships, fund & resource development, and the creation of strategic alliances. Una’s efforts have increased the organization’s budget which prompted moving to a larger facility, adding team members, and acquiring a company vehicle (branded) which, in turn, have significantly increased the organization’s ability to address community needs. Una’s work has been recognized throughout Central Pennsylvania and beyond. She has received numerous awards and distinctions including 2009 Robert D. Hanson Award for Excellence; 2012 Women of Excellence (TWE); 2018 Business Woman of the Year; 2018 Luminary Award; 2020 Women of Influence Circle of Excellence; 2021 Outstanding Service Award; and 2023 Facilitator of the Year Award.

A member of the Rotary Club of Harrisburg since 2006, Una served as Club President in 2012/13 and then went on to serve in several roles with Rotary District 7390. She was nominated to serve as District Governor in 2015 and, after serving as DGN, DGE, and the associated role of District Foundation Chair, Una fulfilled her term as District Governor, one of 103 women in the world at the time, in 2017/18. Una completed the Rotary Leadership Institutes and became certified as RLI Faculty in 2018. She spends many weekends training Rotarians across the Mid Atlantic and Northeast USA. Una has also been a presenter/facilitator with the Mid Atlantic President Elect Training Seminar and was elected as Executive Trainer for 2022 and 2023. Una serves as a Training Leader for Rotary Zones 28 & 32 (Northeast USA and Canada); and has the distinction of serving as a Training Leader for the Rotary International Assembly in 2020 and 2021 (virtually). Una recently accepted an international appointment as a member of the Marketing Committee for the Rotary International Convention 2023 in Melbourne Australia. Una is a Paul Harris Fellow x3 and has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for The Rotary Foundation and Polio Plus.\n\nUna earned a Bachelor’s Degree from the University of Central Florida and has followed that with a number of professional certifications including: Certified Fundraising Executive (CFRE); Certified in Organizational Leadership (The Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership); and Certified Interpersonal Skills Trainer (Color Code International). In 2023, Una was awarded a scholarship to become a certified coach in Positive Intelligence through Shirzad Chamine’s multi-million dollar international campaign. Una is a first generation American of Irish descent; the youngest of 7 siblings; married to Mike for 31 years; and mother to Michael (28) and McCaffrey (24). As of this year the family birthday list is over 70 people and growing! The holidays are always an adventure!\n\nDuring her more than 40-year tenure with PSECU, Margaret Delmonico contributed to many aspects of the credit union’s operations. She began her career helping PSECU members directly with their financial accounts as a member service representative. She later assumed a supervisory role managing staff and the delivery of quality member services in the credit union’s loans area. Next, Margaret moved on to Marketing where she began building mutually beneficial Select Employee Group (SEG) relationships with Pennsylvania-based employers, as well as bonds with university and community groups inside and outside PSECU’s field of membership. Prior to her retirement, Margaret served as PSECU’s Director of Public Relations. In this role, she oversaw the credit union’s community involvement and outreach, including its corporate communications, financial education programming, and corporate social responsibility efforts. This position called for the highest ethical standards, professional excellence, and the embodiment of shared credit union values and principles. Throughout her tenure, Margaret served and impacted numerous community organizations with transformational affect including the Central PA Food Bank, Art Association of Harrisburg, Harrisburg Rotary Foundation, and Leadership Harrisburg Area. Margaret earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater and speech communications from DeSales University (formerly Allentown College of Saint Francis DeSales) and holds a Master’s Degree in communication/journalism from Shippensburg University. In 2020, Margaret was named 2020 Credit Union Hero of the Year. She received the Platinum Award for Servant Leadership from Leadership Harrisburg Area also in 2020 and in December 2021 agreed to come out of retirement to join LHA’s staff as Executive Trainer.\n\nLexi joined LHA’s staff in 2022 after graduating from Juniata College.
