        "text": "Harrisburg School District Continues to Next Steps of Superintendent Search\n\nThe Harrisburg School District (HSD) is continuing into the next phase of its superintendent search with the Pennsylvania School Boards Association (PSBA). The search began on Tuesday, June 11, with the District advertising for a candidate who has an aptitude for working in a culturally diverse community and possesses strong skills in school finance, budgeting and cost-effectiveness strategies. The desired candidate would also lead the implementation of the District’s Amended Recovery Plan to ensure that initiatives, action plans and goals are achieved. The search’s open application period included a comprehensive statewide and nationwide advertising and recruitment campaign, including outreach to the National Alliance of Black School Educators and the Association of Latino Administrators and Superintendents.\n\nThe application period closed on Monday, July 8 with a competitive number of candidates applying for the role. The search will now continue into the next stage with the selected candidate being appointed in Fall 2024. The District appreciates the community and employees who responded to the survey seeking input on our next superintendent. Over 150 survey responses were received.\n\nWe will continue to keep you informed as the process continues. Meanwhile, we are pleased to introduce our Acting Superintendent, Dr. Marcia Stokes. Dr. Stokes has served as the Chief Financial Officer of Harrisburg SD since January 2022. Prior to joining the Harrisburg School District, Dr. Stokes served as a financial and operational leader in school districts in Pennsylvania, New York, and Louisiana for over 15 years. Before entering the field of public education, she was a financial executive for a global bank, a Commissioned Officer in the United States Coast Guard, and an elected school board member. Dr. Stokes is a proven, results-oriented leader who is committed to serving the students, families, and staff of the Harrisburg School District and its school community."
