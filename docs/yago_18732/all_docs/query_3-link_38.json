What other position in the world allows you to drink on the sundial? No, really, he actually drinks while perched on a sundial. No one knows what time it is, thanks to Falco!\n\nThomas Fullery\n\nPeter Covington\n\nBlackfryar\n\nItinerant Actor • Revels' Guild\n\nThanks to poor stage direction and a hastily thrown together stage near a cliff, Thomas finds himself without an acting company to work with.

She likes to share\n\nZephyr Smythe\n\nSam Gialanella\n\nBlackfryar\n\nSoothsayer • Revels' Guild\n\nSo far not a single one of Zephyr's prognostications has come true, but they don't let that bother them because they have seen the future and they know what a success they're going to be.

Back to work tomorrow, though!\n\nChristopher Marlowe\n\nDom Hernandez\n\nBacchanalian\n\nWriter • Revels' Guild\n\nWriter, Rapper, Drinker, Spy.\n\nAgatha Weatherwax\n\nJackie Holzel\n\nBlackfryar\n\nTravelling Storyteller • Revels' Guild\n\nAgatha has a tale for every tavern and a jest for every journey.
