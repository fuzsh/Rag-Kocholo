        "text": "President Joe Biden is expected to be among the special guests attending an ice cream social at his Harrisburg area campaign headquarters on Sunday.\n\nThe event, from 5 to 7 p.m. at the Biden-Harris headquarters in Lower Paxton Township, is by invitation only. It will be Biden’s first visit to the region since Labor Day 2020 when he stopped by the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO office in downtown Harrisburg.\n\nBiden was scheduled to speak before the National Education Association in Philadelphia on Sunday, but the campaign cancelled those plans following the National Education Association Staff Organization’s Friday announcement it was going on strike. His campaign said the president will not cross a picket line.\n\nThis visit to the area comes as Biden is trying to shore up support for his re-election following his poor debate performance June 27 that has Democrat Party insiders and pundits questioning whether he is the best candidate to take on presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump in November. And it has some speculating whether Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, just 18 months into his first term, may be a viable replacement.\n\nInvited guests received notices about the ice cream social on Friday asking them to RSVP if they planned to attend."
