Who We Are

Leadership Harrisburg Area is a bridge between people, businesses, and the organizations that address the greatest needs of our communities. We are a private, non profit organization established in 1986 with an alumni base of 1200 business and community leaders throughout Pennsylvania's Capital Region.

Why It Matters

In addition to a technically skilled workforce, the continued success of the Capital Region, of any region, depends on people who are practiced in leadership, teamwork, and problem solving. The Capital Region needs people who are self-aware, aware of the community around them, and are well networked. We need people who are willing to share their time, talents and resources with others. This is the essence of Leadership Harrisburg Area and why we matter.

How You Can Help

You can help the Capital Region by participating in one of Leadership Harrisburg Areaâ€™s programs or supporting someone from your organization to participate.
