        "text": "Introduction\n\nBreast cancer (BCa) is the most common malignancy among women around the globe, and it is recognized to be the second most common cause of death in women [1]. Its rate is rising rapidly in Asian women and the developing world. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, Asian Indian/Pakistani women residing in the United States seem to have a higher frequency of BCa particularly at a younger age (< 40 years) compared to Caucasians [2]. The data from South Karachi, a pragmatic representative of the population of Pakistan, revealed that BCa accounted for approximately one third of cancers in women [3].\n\nHormone receptors such as estrogen (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs) play a seminal role in determining the treatment strategy and prognosis of patients with BCa. In addition, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) has been found to be overexpressed in a subset of invasive BCa and is associated with poor prognosis [4], [5]. According to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database, Asian Indian/Pakistani women residing in the United States had more ER/PR-negative BCa (30.6%) compared to Caucasians (21.8%) [2]. These data are similar to studies undertaken on samples of BCa from women residing in Pakistan that showed that 60% to 65% of the tumors expressed ER/PR [6], [7]. Furthermore, frequency of HER2 expression has also found to be higher in Pakistani women with BCa (30%-39%) [6], [8], [9] in contrast to Caucasians (25%-30%) [4], [5].\n\nOnly a limited number of studies have evaluated the role of the androgen receptor (AR), phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), and phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog (pPTEN) as potential predictive or prognostic markers compared to the large number of studies on ER, PR, and HER2.\n\nAR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor; its expression on BCa is known to be linked with improved survival [10], [11], [12]. Hu et al. assessed AR status in a large (n = 1467) cohort of patients with BCa; they found 91% and 86% 5-year survival in patients with AR-positive and AR-negative tumors, respectively [11], whereas other studies have not found a similar association with survival [13], [14]. AR expression has been observed in approximately 40% to 80% of BCas [11], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Although a significant number of patients with BCa express AR, the underlying molecular mechanisms of AR signaling pathway in BCa biology have not been intensely studied, and the role of AR on survival in patients with BCa needs further delineation.\n\nProtein kinase B (more commonly referred as Akt) is a serine/threonine kinase, which plays a role in BCa growth by promoting cell survival and inhibiting cell death [20], [21] and is being considered as a potential target for BCa therapy [22], [23], whereas PTEN, a well-recognized tumor suppressor gene, negatively regulates Akt and has been shown to inhibit BCa growth [24], [25]. Nagata and colleagues reported loss of PTEN in 50% of patients with BCa [26]. AR has been shown to increase PTEN expression by activating its promoter that in turn lowers Akt activity and decreases cellular proliferation in BCa [27]. Wang et al. also reported that AR increases PTEN expression and inhibits Akt phosphorylation in BCa cells [28]. PTEN is a positive modulator, whereas Akt is a negative modulator of AR transcriptional activity. The cross talk of AR signaling with Akt and PTEN that may have clinical significance in the development of BCa has not been well studied, though the expression of Akt and PTEN in BCa tissue has been reported [29], [30], [31].\n\nTo our knowledge, to date, no studies have been undertaken examining the expression of AR, active form of Akt (pAkt), and stable form of PTEN (pPTEN) on BCa in a cohort of Pakistani women. In this study, our aim was to determine the immunohistochemical expression of AR, pAkt, and pPTEN in Pakistani women with invasive BCa and their role as potential prognostic markers. We also examined the significance of AR expression on patient's survival after stratifying by ER, pAkt, and pPTEN status and endocrine treatment.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe expression of AR in this study, as determined by immunohistochemistry, demonstrated that 47.5% (95 of 200) of invasive BCa tumors, from a Pakistani cohort, expressed nuclear AR. This is similar to other reported studies, where the percentage of AR-positive tumors ranges from 40% to 80% [11], [17], [18], [19]. This wide range may reflect genuine biologic variations, arising due to environmental and genetic diversity across the globe.\n\nIn the current study, tumors that expressed AR were of low or intermediate grade (grades I and II) and expressed ER and PR, which is consistent with previous studies [11], [33]. We also found that AR expression in tumors was significantly associated with longer OS, with a survival advantage of 4.4 years, in comparison to women whose tumors did not express AR. Our data are consistent with previous studies that have assessed AR expression in BCa and its potential as an additional prognostic marker [10], [11], [12], [40], [41]. A recent meta-analysis showed that expression of AR in breast tumors emerges as an indicator of better survival [12]. We found a significant association between lymph node involvement and poor survival, whereas factors including age, HER2 status, ER, PR, and tumor size demonstrated no association with prognosis. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates a potential prognostic value of AR expression in Pakistani women who have been diagnosed with invasive BCa.\n\nWe further analyzed the prognostic significance of AR in patients who were stratified by ER status. Our analysis showed that patients with AR+/ER+ tumors had better OS compared to the group that was AR−/ER+. We also found that patients with ER-negative tumors expressing AR (AR+/ER−) had a better survival than patients with AR−/ER− tumors. However, despite displaying a positive trend of AR expression with survival, a significant association could not be ascribed in AR/ER subgroup analysis, and we would cautiously attribute this to the small sample size and low number of deaths. Previous studies suggest that AR expression is associated with improved survival among women with ER-positive tumors [42], [43]. Data supporting this assertion are based on an in vitro study that showed that AR interacted with estrogen-responsive elements on the ER gene and inhibited ER-mediated growth of BCa cells [44]. The role of AR in patients with ER-negative tumors has not been fully elucidated as only a few studies have examined AR’s role in these patients [36], [45]. There is inconsistency in studies examining AR expression in ER-negative BCa. Peters et al. found no association, whereas Agoff et al. found an association of AR expression with improved survival in patients with ER-negative tumors [45].\n\nExpression of ER in tumors holds considerable value for the prediction of response to endocrine therapy [46], whereas only 50% of ER-positive tumors respond to endocrine therapies [47], [48]. To date, clinical benefits of AR expression in patients receiving endocrine therapy have not been exhaustively studied [49]. In our study, patients with AR+/ER+ tumors, receiving endocrine therapy, showed improved survival, compared to patients whose tumors were AR−/ER+. These results suggest that AR expression increased the sensitivity of tumors to endocrine therapy and AR negativity could possibly be associated with decreased response to endocrine therapy. Previously, Park et al. demonstrated AR as a marker for better response to endocrine treatment in ER-positive tumors [50]. Additionally, an in vitro study has found that aromatase inhibitors have a greater antiproliferative effect on AR+/ER+ BCa cell line. The inhibitory effect may have been due to inhibition of estrogen synthesis and activation of the intracellular AR signaling, caused by sustained androgen levels [51]. Taken together, these findings suggest that AR expression could be an additional significant marker for endocrine responsiveness in ER-positive cancers.\n\nRole of PTEN as a negative regulator of Akt signaling pathway is well recognized, and these two variables are found to be inversely related with each other [52], [53]. To date, little is known about the AR-mediated regulation of Akt and PTEN expression. Therefore, we determined AR status along with pAkt and pPTEN in the same cohort of patients with BCa and analyzed the potential prognostic significance of AR in patients stratified by pAkt and pPTEN status. We found expression of pAkt and pPTEN in 81.3% and 50.6% of invasive BCa, respectively. We did not find independent association of pAkt or pPTEN expression with any clinicopathologic characteristics or survival, which is in contrast to previous studies showing association of activated Akt and loss of PTEN with poor survival [30], [37]. Absence of independent prognostic significance of pAkt and pPTEN in our study could be due to the ethnic background of the patient population and/or the number of patients studied.\n\nTo date, a very limited number of studies have examined the expression of AR/Akt/PTEN and their association or cross talk in BCas. Wang et al. reported positive correlation between AR and PTEN expression in BCa tissues [27]. Aleskandarany et al. also demonstrated a direct correlation of pAkt expression with AR status in invasive BCa [34]. Conversely, Lin et al. described an inverse relationship between Akt and AR signaling pathways, indicating that Akt inactivates AR [54] and promotes AR degradation [55] that resulted in suppression of AR-induced apoptosis. A few in vitro studies showing the related role of Akt, PTEN, and AR in BCa suggest that AR lowers Akt activity and increases PTEN expression that in turn decreases BCa cell proliferation [27], [28]. Collectively, these studies suggest that PTEN-Akt is a complex signaling pathway, operated under multiple levels of feedback; AR pathway is known to be involved in this feedback loop and has been shown to downregulate Akt and upregulate PTEN expression.\n\nUnlike previous studies, we did not find any association between expression of pAkt and pPTEN with AR status. This suggests presence of mechanisms other than AR that might be responsible for regulating Akt/PTEN expression. However, we found that expression of AR was associated with significantly longer OS in patients with pAkt-positive tumors, suggesting protective role of AR in these patients. We also found a survival advantage with only 7.1% deaths in patients with AR+/pPTEN+ tumors, whereas loss of expression of both markers was found to be associated with lower OS with 32% deaths. These results suggest that AR-PTEN coexpression might be decreasing the cellular proliferation and increasing apoptosis (action mediated by pAkt), resulting in increased OS in the subset of patients with AR+/pPTEN+ tumors.\n\nReportedly, patients with Akt+ and PTEN− tumors have been shown to exhibit worst survival; however, these patients were not stratified into AR-positive and AR-negative groups [31]. We stratified tumors in context of combined expression of pAkt and pPTEN and determined the impact of AR expression on survival in patients with pAkt+/pPTEN− tumors. We found that, in a subset of women with pAkt+/pPTEN− tumors, expression of AR conferred a survival advantage, whereas loss of AR reduced the survival. Our results suggest that AR, independent of its coexpression with pPTEN, could be negatively regulating Akt-mediated proliferative effect as shown by survival advantage of 2 years in patients with AR+/pAkt+/pPTEN− tumors when compared with AR−/pAkt+/pPTEN− tumors. This did not reach to statistical significance possibly due to low number of patients (n = 31) in this subset ( D). The mechanism of these important observations where AR appears to negate the proliferative and antiapoptotic effect due to activation of Akt and loss of PTEN, respectively, warrants further study.\n\nIn the current study, survival analysis was limited to patients who went through a follow-up of 5 years or more (n = 82). A distinctly better survival was observed not only in patients with AR expression for whom we had 5-year follow-up but also in patients whose follow-up was between 2 to 11 years (n = 200, data not shown). However, relatively small number of deaths (n = 16) restricted us to perform multivariable analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, we found that, in a cohort of Pakistani women with BCa, expression of AR conferred a survival advantage independent of other markers. Furthermore, expression of AR in pAkt+/pPTEN− subgroup could be useful in distinguishing BCa with more favorable prognosis. Future studies on larger cohort of patients would be helpful in establishing the role of AR, pAkt, and pPTEN expression as significant independent prognostic and predictive factors in patients with BCa."
