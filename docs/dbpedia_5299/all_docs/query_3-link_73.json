        "text": "Ayesha Faridi, CNBC India's News Hottie\n\nOverall Hotness: 7.5/10\n\nFace: 8/10\n\nBody: 7.5/10\n\nLegs: 7/10\n\nPersonality: 7.5/10\n\nCNBC India has a couple of hotties working the desk, Ayesha Faridi and Tanvir Gill. Of the two, I like Ayesha better, she's got more maturity and she's better looking overall.\n\nI won't lie to you, the Indian accent when speaking english isn't all that attractive. But Ayesha more than makes up for it with her good looks. She has a really nice smile and her very nice teeth. Her hair is flowing and I like how she does her makeup. She does a kind of reality show called \"Get a Life\" and I took quite a bit of photos from there where she shows more of her body.\n\nFor an Indian chick, she has a decent rack. She's still really thin, but like I said, her boobs are nice. She seems to be a cool chick to hang out with, some of the pictures had her skydiving and clubbing and stuff.\n\nThis is what it says about her on CNBC's bio section:\n\nShe is a journalist by training, having graduated from Delhi University. Prior to joining CNBC TV18, she has worked as a reporter and producer with the BBC World Service and MTV India. She anchors Power Breakfast, CNBC TV18's morning news hour, Your Stocks a stocks query show and Get A Life, a daily lifestyle/arts segment. She also heads the news ticker team at CNBC-TV18. Also co-hosts the popular segment Saas Bahu & Sensex, alongwith Tanvir Gill.\n\nI took this from one of her regular news segments for CNBC India,\n\nSome more pictures of Ayesha in various poses,"
