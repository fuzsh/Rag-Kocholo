        "text": "The book\n\nComputations in algebraic geometry with Macaulay2, edited by David Eisenbud, Daniel R. Grayson, Michael E. Stillman, and Bernd Sturmfels; Springer-Verlag, September 25, 2001; number 8 in the series \"Algorithms and Computations in Mathematics\"; ISBN 3-540-42230-7.\n\nThe journal\n\nThe Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry -- This electronic-only journal is devoted to software related to research in algebra and geometry. Each short article is accompanied by the appropriate source code. The aim is to promote the development of good code and free software for the mathematical research community.\n\nSome software distributions that refer to Macaulay2\n\nAn old version of Macaulay2 is an optional component of Sage.\n\nTeXmacs, a \"what you see is what you get\" editor based on TeX, which is being developed to serve as a user interface for Macaulay2 and other symbolic algebra programs by Joris van der Hoeven.\n\nMacaulay2 is included in the Knoppix/Math CD.\n\nSome news items that refer to Macaulay2\n\n2006 Fields Medalist Andrei Okounkov mentions Macaulay2 in an interview: \"This brings up many issues. I am not an expert, but I think we need a symbolic standard to make computer manipulations easier to document and verify. And with all due respect to the free market, perhaps we should not be dependent on commercial software here. An open-source project could, perhaps, find better answers to the obvious problems such as availability, bugs, backward compatibility, platform independence, standard libraries, etc. One can learn from the success of TEX and more specialized software like Macaulay2. I do hope that funding agencies are looking into this.\"\n\nSome course materials that refer to Macaulay2\n\nREU 09: Algebraic Geometry Group, an REU program at Mount Holyoke conducted by Jessica Sidman, Summer, 2009.\n\nIntroduction to Algebraic Geometry, by Donu Arapura.\n\nPolytopes and toric varieties group, an REU program at Mount Holyoke conducted by Jessica Sidman, Summer, 2005.\n\nComputer algebra and geometry, an REU program at the University of Georgia conducted by Dr. Bill Rulla [email protected], Summer, 2002.\n\nSome books that refer to Macaulay2\n\nComputational methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, by Wolmer V.

Grayson, Jürgen Herzog and Michael Stillman; Algorithms and Computation in Mathematics, 2, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1998.\n\nUsing algebraic geometry, by David Cox, John Little, and Donal O'Shea, Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 185, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1998.\n\nSolving systems of polynomial equations. by Bernd Sturmfels, CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics, 97, Published for the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences, Washington, DC; by the American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2002.\n\nIdeals, Varieties, and Algorithms, by David Cox, John Little, and Donal O'Shea, Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 185, Third Edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, Springer, 2006.\n\nComputational Algebraic Geometry, by Henry Schenck, Cambridge University Press, 2003.\n\nInstructions\n\nHow to cite Macaulay2\n\nSome papers that refer to Macaulay2\n\nMany of the older citations to papers below were obtained using a full text search at arxiv.org for \"Macaulay2\" or \"Macaulay 2\" but not \"Cohen Macaulay 2\". More recent searches search simply for \"Macaulay2\" in the text of the paper, which is now our preferred way to type the name. We are missing some of the results between 0908.2609 (2008 Sep) and 1110.4080 (2011 Oct), since we were tardy in trying to use the arxiv's full text search function, and there is a limit of 200 results; the results we have in that interval were obtained from google.
