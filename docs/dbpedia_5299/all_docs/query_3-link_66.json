        "text": "Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has spoken his heart out on controversial political issues relating to Indira Gandhi and NAMO. He has also discussed the current state of the market and offered important tips to us on how to find multibagger stocks\n\nRamesh Damani has overcome his long-standing aversion towards Banks and NBFC stocks by adding a high-quality HFC stock to his portfolio. The HFC has ambitious plans and may become a mega multibagger\n\nToday’s dramatic plunge in the Sensex gave Porinju the much needed opportunity to buy stocks at cheaper prices. He has issued the clarion call that there is now a golden and once-in-lifetime opportunity for us to pick smaller businesses in India and become rich\n\nPorinju Veliyath has recommended a high-quality stock which has low downside risk and potential for high upside. We need to immediately apprise ourselves of the merits of the stock and decide whether it deserves to be added to our portfolios\n\nShankar Sharma has sent the clarion call that the Bull market in small-cap stocks is just starting and that there is no dearth of multibagger stocks to be found. He has also revealed his favourite stocks and sectors\n\nAn elite FII has made an aggressive purchase of Dolly Khanna’s high conviction stock pick. We can no longer stay aloof from the stock but have to join the party ASAP\n\nRakesh Jhunjhunwala’s latest stock is one where Porinju Veliyath has already pocketed multibagger gains. It is explicit that more gains are due from the stock and so we have to make a beeline for it\n\nVijay Kedia has confidently declared that he is “very bullish” about the stock market and that there is a “revolution” happening. He has also discussed his latest multibagger stock pick\n\nNovice investors have been buying so-called “Lakh crore ki kahani” stocks in an aggressive and no-holds-barred manner. This has spooked eminent investors Samir Arora and Ramesh Damani. The duo has united in warning us not to get carried away but to play safe\n\nCLSA, the elite international brokerage, has sent the clarion call that the housing sector is at a “tipping point” and that it is the Indian economy’s “next big growth driver”. It is imperative that we act on this advice and load our portfolios with housing finance stocks without any further delay"
