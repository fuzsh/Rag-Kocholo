        "text": "The Correlates of Educated Womenâs Labor Force Participation in Pakistan: A Micro-Study\n\nMuhammad Zahir Faridi ( ) and Ayesha Rashid ( )\n\nAdditional contact information\n\nLahore Journal of Economics, 2014, vol. 19, issue 2, 155-184\n\nAbstract: This study attempts to determine the factors that affect educated womenâs decision to participate in the labor force. Based on a field survey conducted in the district of Multan, we find that a number of factors have a positive and significant impact on womenâs decision to work. These include women who fall in the age groups 35â44 and 45â54, the coefficients of all levels of education, the presence of an educated husband, marital status, family structure, and family expenditure. The presence of an educated father, being an educated married woman, location, distance from the district headquarters, the husbandâs employment status and income, and ownership of assets significantly reduces womenâs labor force participation. The results of the earnings equation show that variables such as women who live in an urban area and their level of education and experience are associated with a substantial increase in earnings with each additional year. The number of children has a negative and significant impact on womenâs earnings. The hours-of-work model shows that age and the number of completed years of education have a positive effect on working hours, while the number of dependents and the number of hours spent on household activities have a negative effect on working hours.\n\nKeywords: Human capital; labor force participation; earnings function; time allocation; Punjab; Pakistan (search for similar items in EconPapers)\n\nJEL-codes: D00 J21 (search for similar items in EconPapers)\n\nDate: 2014\n\nReferences: View references in EconPapers View complete reference list from CitEc\n\nCitations: View citations in EconPapers (2)\n\nDownloads: (external link)\n\nhttp://121.52.153.179/JOURNAL/Volume%2019-2/06%20Faridi%20and%20Rashid.pdf (application/pdf)\n\nRelated works:\n\nThis item may be available elsewhere in EconPapers: Search for items with the same title.\n\nExport reference: BibTeX RIS (EndNote, ProCite, RefMan) HTML/Text\n\nPersistent link: https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:lje:journl:v:19:y:2014:i:2:p:155-184\n\nAccess Statistics for this article"
