        "text": "Annual Conference 2017-2018\n\nThe conference was titled, âPartnerships for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)â\n\nWith the adoption of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 193 countries in 2015, world entered into a new era of development agenda. It marked a transition from Millennium Development Goals (MDGs-year 2000-2015) to SDGs (Year 2015-2030). While MDGs relied heavily on the governments, SDGs have acknowledged the role of businesses and civil societies along with the governments in achieving the goals.\n\nSDGs follow a pragmatic approach and focus on holistic development of society and the planet. A need for a collaborative action between governments, business and civil society is envisaged for realization of 17 SDGs and 169 targets by 2030. A collaborative partnership approach with involvement of multiple stakeholders is required. Along with financial investments, private businesses also have the potential to provide necessary technical expertise and bring on board professionally trained human resources. It would require social sector organizations like government, NGOs, civil society institutions to embrace opportunities to design programmes which creates impacts on communities and at the same time generates returns for investors. The foundation is cognizant of clear linkages between SDGs and its overall work. ABF projects are contributing in progressing towards achievement of SDGs.\n\nThe conference was inaugurated by the Hon. Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Mr. Devendra Fadnavis. The key note address was delivered by Mr. Sonam Wangchuk, an innovator and education reformist emphasizing the need of personal social responsibility towards alignment with the SDGs. A panel discussion comprised of Mr. Amit Chandra, MD, Bain Capital, Mumbai, Mr. Arun Maira, Former Member of Planning Commission, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Help Age International, Mr. Praveen Singh Pardeshi, Additional Chief Secretory, Govt. of Maharashtra and Mr. S Ramadorai, Chairman, Axis Bank Foundation, Advisory Board Tata STRIVE, AirAsia India, Tata Advanced Systems Ltd. and Tata Technologies.
