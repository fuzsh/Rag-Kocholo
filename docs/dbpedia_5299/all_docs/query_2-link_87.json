Jaipur and affiliated to Dr. B.R.Ambedkar University, Agra which runs the B.Ed. Program. It is situated on Anoopshahr Road, Post C.D.F, Near Jamalpur Railway Crossing, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\nDescribe your experience of this work in 50 words including at least 5 good things : My​ experience at Al-Barkaat Institute was really amazing. In the internship programme, I along with my fellow interns took different skills of language and taught them to the students of B. Ed. It was a 21 day programme (2nd December 2020- 22nd December, 2020). I took 4 classes - 2 classes individually and 2 classes combined with my fellow interns. I learnt many things like :\n\na)How to deal with students online as well as offline and also how to continuously monitor them.\n\nb)I learnt to work and overcome my stage fright.\n\nc)I learnt how to manage and organize events.\n\nd)I learnt to work in coordination with my fellow interns. (How to take class without any chaos, devise activities together and to give each other equal time to interact with students).\n\ne)I also managed to take classes individually, create links for the classes and devise activities based on topics and events.\n\nf)I learnt and worked hard on how to record and make videos with clarity and upload them on YouTube.\n\ng)I gained confidence while dealing with students since I used to be under confident.\n\nh)I learnt how to practically apply what I have learnt in my class. (E.g Task components, designing and giving topics for syllabus).\n\ni)I also learnt to maintain and record the important documents related to my internship program. (Like it is done in Portfolio).\n\nIn short, working at such a renowned Institution was actually worth it.\n\nHow is this going to benefit you in the future? This experience is surely going to benefit me in​ future since I have always wanted to become a teacher. This internship has helped me in many ways. It has helped me to clear my doubts regarding different topics, to deal with class, manage time and also organize extra curricular programmes. Apart from this, I have gained confidence and learnt to interact with learners smoothly which is surely something required for a teacher.\n\nDo you like this new component of the newly introduced syllabi? Why? Definitely, yes. I​ liked this new component which is introduced here. Because this will help us, the students to discover themselves, to work on themselves, to learn and get exposure to different things. This will definitely help them in building confidence and will make them work hard. It can be an impetus for a positive change in students.\n\nDid you get sufficient help from the Department? The Department of English was very​ helpful and supportive. When we were offered this internship, our teachers especially our Chairman and the co-ordinators were very much satisfied and gave a yes to this internship. They were quite considerate and had instilled their trust in us.\n\nWhat challenges did you come across? The challenge was to find the internship programme​ during the Pandemic. This is the reason it got a little difficult to find the internship programme too early and then I had to manage it alongside (MA ELT) presentations and assignments. Also, it was not a work from home internship. Rather I had to go to Al-Barkaat to take my classes. Apart from going there to take the classes, I also had to go there to discuss the time table and syllabus. Managing to do my assignments and presentations (of M.A- ELT) alongside these things was not an easy task but it went quite well.\n\nDo you have any suggestions to improve the programme? Yes. Even though the department​ was quite considerate, I believe the students must have been given more clarity regarding the outreach and internship programmes. There should have been a session regarding these programmes in the starting of our 3rd semester (August, 2020) and then there would have been regular such sessions to check the progress of students since this was something introduced for the first time.\n\nSection 1\n\nEvent Registration\n\nInternship Programme\n\nFeedback from Internship and Outreach Students\n\nStudents’ Feedback on Internship and Outreach Programme\n\nName of the Student - Aliza khan\n\nEmail - alizakhan3107@gmail.com\n\nName of the Organisation where you worked - Muslim Taleem-O-Tarbiyat Hr Secondary School\n\nDescribe in 20 words the Organisation that you worked in.\n\nIt is a UP board based school which is established in 1988, which worked for the welfare of the education of the minorities section.\n\nDescribe your experience of this work in 50 words including at least 5 good things.\n\nMy experience was good. It taught me so many things in practical life. It made me responsible towards my duties. I got to explore many ways to teach different level of learners. It improved my temperament in dealing with the learners, that is I learnt to be calm while dealing with them.\n\nHow this is going to benefit you in future?\n\nIt made us all punctual and responsible towards our job, which will help us in the future life whenever we will be exposed to the work.\n\nDo you like this new component of the newly introduced syllabi? Why?\n\nYes, I like the new component of the newly introduced syllabi. It is because it makes us do things in real life which eventually make us experienced.\n\nDid you get sufficient help from the Department?\n\nYes the department helped us throughout the process. They guided us properly and they were considerate too.\n\nDo you have any suggestions to improve the programme?\n\nIt can be better if the proper guidelines are given for making the portfolios.\n\nWhat challenges you came across?\n\nYes, there were many challenges that I came across with one of the main challenge was the \"language\" that I have to take a lot of care about while teaching the learners.\n\nFeedback Form\n\nEvent Registration: Internship Programme\n\nName of the Student: Aamna Siddiqi\n\nEmail: asra27998@gmail.com\n\nName of the Organisation where you worked: Al-Barkat Institute of Education.\n\nDescribe in 20 words the Organisation that you worked in:\n\nThe Al-Barkaat Institute of Education is a College in Aligarh that offers various graduate and Post Graduate courses for students. As interns, the Institute offered us a great environment to allow us to indulge in developing our teaching skills through proper teaching and learning environment.\n\nDescribe your experience of this work in 50 words including at least 5 good things:\n\nThe experience was extremely productive and enhancing in terms of teaching and learning.\n\nThe institute offered a purely academic environment as an Assistant Teacher.\n\nWe improved on teaching and answering questions/queries\n\nWe indulged in practical implications of our M.A.(ELT) lll semester syllabus such as tasks designing and giving feedback etc in our daily lectures.\n\nDeveloped an all-inclusive syllabus.\n\nEngaged in collaborative and team work.\n\nHow this is going to benefit you in future?\n\nIt was an insightful experience and it developed our confidence as a teacher and provided a platform to practice our skills.\n\nDo you like this new component of the newly introduced syllabi? Why?\n\nYes. It paved way for practical learning and gave an insight about our strengths and weaknesses in terms of teacher and learner.\n\nDid you get sufficient help from the Department?\n\nYes. All the time.\n\nWhat challenges you came across?\n\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, We grappled a lot to find an internship that best suited our course and would have enhanced our experience, but fortunately we got one which is why we joined it a little late\n\nDo you have any suggestions to improve the programme?\n\nABILITY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMME\n\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK FORM INTERNSHIP\n\nName: SAUMA AFREEN\n\nENROLLMENT NO.: GI2189\n\nCLASSROLL NO. 19ENM24\n\nEmail: afreensauma@gmail.com\n\nName of the Organization that I worked at:\n\nPocketful of Sunshine India\n\nDescribe in 20 words the organization that you worked at.\n\nAn organization focused on providing a safe environment for children, with special focus on underprivileged children of day laborers and housemaids etc., in Delhi. Their aim is to prevent children falling prey to various kinds of exploitation.\n\nDescribe your experience of this work in 50 words including at least 5 good things.\n\nIt was my first real time working experience so naturally work ethics was one. Other than that,\n\nThis gave me an opportunity to reflect on the conditions of an underprivileged lot of our society, learning about things they cannot access.\n\nI definitely brushed upon my writing skills, a slight difference to my usual creative writing.\n\nRealtime application of the writing techniques I learned during coursework and other programs that I undertook over years.\n\nDeadlines, formal correspondence, maintaining a balance between work and my studies.\n\nAn experience worthwhile and also an improvement in my researching skills.\n\nHow this is going to benefit you in future?\n\nApart from reflecting nicely on my CV, this was a good experience for me as I have always been passionate regarding these sensitive issues that our society has been struggling since forever. Writing about them is perhaps a very small thing, but it is a step in my drive to be a bit helpful to those in need by first educating myself on the related issues and then using the knowledge to help them out.\n\nDo you like this component of the newly introduced syllabi? Why?\n\nYes, this indeed is a great initiative taken by the department and I would like to thank the department for this opportunity. I quite liked doing what I did as it was something practical and beneficial.\n\nDid you get sufficient help from the Department?\n\nFor this particular internship that I applied for, I did not need any approval or such thing from the Department. However, the Department did help others for the same.\n\nWhat challenges did you come across?\n\nThe guidelines and specifications for both Ability Enhancement Programme and Dissertation Project were informed to us quite late into the semester. Both the programmes were quite intensive and required students to prepare ahead of time. Particularly for Internship, applying and securing an internship during a pandemic where remote working was the only available option, was a tough job. Another thing was simultaneously attending classes and for preparing for continuous assessments.\n\nDo you have any suggestions to improve the programme?\n\nFor this, I believe briefing students a semester prior would help in a better facilitation of this great initiative so that students could apply and work in person during the summer break. Since this was an unusual past year, most of the things were moved online and some of us were able to attend virtual classes and work offline. But this perhaps might revert back again by next year.\n\nAlso, I would like to suggest the Department to connect and collaborate with a few institutions locally and for online work opportunities as a safe option for those who could not secure internships on time.\n\nFeedback from Internship and Outreach Students\n\nEvent Registration: Internship Programme\n\nName of the Student: Mohd Ahmad\n\nEmail: ahmadasadullah22@gmail.com\n\nName of the Organisation where you worked\n\nSwami Shiksha Charitable Trust\n\nDescribe in 20 words the Organisation that you worked in.\n\nIt is an organisation which aims at reaching out to the underprivileged children of our society for their basic needs, like: their education and basic amenities through various campaigns and events on regular basis.\n\nDescribe your experience of this work in 50 words including at least FIVE good things.\n\nMy experience was good.

Why?\n\nYes, I like the new component of the newly introduced syllabi. It is because it makes us do things in real life which eventually make us experienced.\n\nDid you get sufficient help from the Department?\n\nYes, the department helped us throughout the process.

It was beneficial in many ways-\n\nImproved my content writing skills\n\nImproved Language skills\n\nEnhanced vocabulary\n\nImproved Multi-tasking skills\n\nHelped in building CV résumé\n\nThe Unpaid Internship for a Student Campus Ambassador with the Kalam Foundation was a training into practical application and learning experience with management and organization of events. It was beneficial in the following ways-\n\nHelped to contribute to the society\n\nTo become a part of some noble work by providing financial support and health benefits to the needy\n\nHelped in building a strong CV\n\nHelped to gain experience in conducting Online festivals\n\nHelped with managerial skills\n\nHow this is going to benefit you in future?\n\nBoth the Internships were of a different nature of work, from Content Writing to student Campus Ambassador, which were very beneficial in not one, but many aspects. These Internship experiences are going to benefit a lot to me in future, thereby increasing my job prospects other than providing me a plethora of opportunities in the particular area of work. The Internships proved to be a good experience gaining platform for me and would also help me into enhancing my knowledge and Communication skills.\n\nDo you like this new component of the newly introduced syllabi? Why?\n\nThis new component recently induced was a very impressive boundary pushing move to the overall teaching and learning system. Also, it was quite receptive among all the students for the major reason being- personality and CV development of students with experience and a practical approach to applied educational skills.\n\nDid you get sufficient help from the Department?\n\nThe Department was very cooperative and helpful in all possible ways along with proper guidance and leniency on deadlines from the teachers and course coordinators.\n\nWhat challenges you came across?\n\nThere were quite a few challenges-\n\nTight Academic Schedule with assessments and online classes\n\nTime Constraints\n\nRegular Internship Commitments that demanded regular research and writing\n\nManaging Internship work and studies along with Preparation for Exams\n\nDo you have any suggestions to improve the programme?\n\nAlthough the Programme is quite acceptable for practical reasons but it would be highly appreciated if the students be made aware and provided a prior information about any such programme, for the reason that getting enrolled in any Internship requires prior application and scrutiny time, which some students found very difficult-to get enrolled into the Internships.\n\n*___________________________________________*"
