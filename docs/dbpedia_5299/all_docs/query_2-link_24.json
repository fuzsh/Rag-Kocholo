        "meta_description": "Background Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) increases propensity for premature atherosclerotic disease. Knowledge of inpatient outcomes among patients with FH admitted with acute myocardial injury (AMI) is limited.\n\nObjectives Our study aimed to identify myocardial injury types, including type 1 myocardial infarction (MI), type 2 MI and takotsubo cardiomyopathy, assess lesion severity and study adverse short-term inpatient outcomes among patients with FH admitted with AMI.\n\nSetting Our study retrospectively queried the US National Inpatient Sample from 2018 to 2020.\n\nPopulation Adults admitted with AMI and dichotomised based on the presence of FH.\n\nStudy outcomes We evaluated myocardial injury types and complexity of coronary revascularisation. Primary outcome of all-cause mortality and other clinical secondary outcomes were studied.\n\nResults There were 3 711 765 admissions with AMI including 2360 (0.06%) with FH. FH was associated with higher odds of ST-elevation MI (STEMI) (adjusted OR (aOR): 1.62, p<0.001) and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) (aOR: 1.29, p<0.001) but lower type 2 MI (aOR: 0.39, p<0.001) and takotsubo cardiomyopathy (aOR: 0.36, p=0.004). FH was associated with higher multistent percutaneous coronary interventions (aOR: 2.36, p<0.001), multivessel coronary artery bypass (aOR: 2.65, p<0.001), higher odds of intracardiac thrombus (aOR: 3.28, p=0.038) and mechanical circulatory support (aOR: 1.79, p<0.001). There was 50% reduction in odds of all-cause mortality (aOR: 0.50, p=0.006) and lower odds of mechanical ventilation (aOR: 0.37, p<0.001). There was no difference in rate of ventricular tachycardia, cardioversion, new implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation, cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest.\n\nConclusion Among patients hospitalised with AMI, FH was associated with higher STEMI and NSTEMI, lower type 2 MI and takotsubo cardiomyopathy, higher number of multiple stents and coronary bypasses, and mechanical circulatory support device but was associated with lower all-cause mortality and rate of mechanical ventilation.\n\nNo data are available.

        "text": "Background\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a genetic disorder that causes markedly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which can lead to early atherosclerotic disease. The global prevalence of FH is estimated to be 1 in 313 in the general population, with higher rates among high-risk groups such as those with premature myocardial injury and LDL-C >190.1 FH can be diagnosed either genetically or clinically, with several genes identified that follow a Mendelian pattern and could be autosomal dominant, such as ApoB receptor, LDL receptor and PCSK9 related, or autosomal recessive, such as LDLRAP1.2 3\n\nPatients with FH have a disproportionately higher burden of morbidity, especially at a younger age. In a French lipid registry study, patients with probable FH who were admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were 12 years younger than those without FH but had double the rates of 5-year mortality and atherosclerotic complications.4 While long-term adverse outcomes following atherosclerotic events are well established in patients with FH, the impact of recent advances in treatments of atherosclerotic disorders on inpatient mortality during admission for acute myocardial injury is still unclear. There is scarcity of data from the USA on FH among hospitalised patients admitted with ACS. There are currently no data on non-type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) among patients with FH including takotsubo or type 2 MI.\n\nIn this study, we hypothesise that patients with FH, despite having higher morbidity, are likely to have lower inpatient mortality rates during admission for acute myocardial injury due to recent advances in treatment of atherosclerotic coronary lesions and novel therapies for hyperlipidaemia and diabetes. To our knowledge, there is currently only one large cohort study on this topic, based on the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database.5\n\nMyocardial injury pattern\n\nPatients with FH had a higher prevalence of STEMI and NSTEMI, consistent with what is widely reported in literature. Prevalence of non-type 1 MI among patients with FH has not been previously reported. It is widely reported that hyperlipidaemia is a risk factor for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.12 13 There are no previous studies that specifically investigated an association of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or type 2 MI with FH. Our study observed a lower prevalence of type 2 MI, takotsubo cardiomyopathy and other forms of acute myocardial injury among patients with FH compared with those without. Our stated rate of takotsubo cardiomyopathy of 1.69% agrees with the incidence rate of takotsubo cardiomyopathy among patients with acute MI in the HORIZONS-AMI trial of 0.5–2.1%.14 The lower comorbidity burden and younger age are likely protective against the occurrence of demand ischaemia and takotsubo among patients with FH.15 16 This favourable outcome of lower odds of non-type 1 MI persisted after accounting for age and comorbidity burden. Studies have reported a better lifestyle among patients with FH, starting from an early age compared with the general population. This could explain a potentially robust cardiometabolic reserve in times of stress compared with the general population.17 It has been hypothesised in many translational studies that there are other factors such as enhanced thrombogenicity that plays a role in the pathogenesis of coronary disease in patients with FH besides elevated LDL.18 This likely makes patients with FH prone to type 1 MI compared with others such as type 2 MI or takotsubo.\n\nPrimary and secondary clinical outcomes\n\nLike observations made by Kheiri et al, we also observed increased utilisation of mechanical circulatory support among patients with FH.19 Additionally, we studied the rate of intracardiac thrombus and observed increased odds among those with FH, a problem that was previously not studied. The concept of enhanced platelet activation has been studied and reported to be higher in patients with elevated serum cholesterol. This, together with a higher rate of transmural infarction, may explain these observations.20\n\nWe also believe that higher prevalence of STEMI with transmural ischaemia and myocardial stunning is the likely cause of increased mechanical circulatory support device use as well as higher risk of intracardiac thrombosis.\n\nIn our study, we observed a paradoxically lower all-cause mortality among patients with FH admitted with acute myocardial injury and this reduction remained significant among patients with type 1 MI after stratification. Our findings agree with the findings of prior similar studies. For instance, in an analysis of a readmission database between 2016 and 2018, Elbadawi et al found that patients with FH admitted with acute MI had a non-significant trend towards lower mortality.8 Similarly, an NIS-based study that looked at outcomes of acute MI between 2016 and 2018 found lower odds of inpatient mortality among patients with FH.5 Several studies have found a negative correlation between serum LDL and short-term mortality after MI.21 22 The relationship between serum LDL and mortality is however not present linearly across all spectra of hypercholesterolaemia. For example, in a Danish population-based study, Johannesen et al found a U-shaped relationship between serum LDL and mortality following acute MI, with mortality reduction occurring between LDL level of 70 mg/dL and 140 mg/dL. They added that these observations applied only to patients who were not on statin therapy.23 Explaining this well-known lipid-ACS paradox has however been challenging. Some authors believe that the negative relationship between moderately elevated serum LDL and mortality may be a simple case of lead-time bias. It is thought that early screening offers patients with FH earlier treatment with statins which are known to improve outcomes during acute MI.24 25 There have been some postulates about the mitigating effect of increased remnant lipoproteins. They are often elevated in patients with FH and their levels have been shown to correlate negatively with mortality and adverse outcomes after MI.26\n\nAdditionally, Ravnskov et al, in a systematic review, found no significant difference in mortality between cohorts with and without elevated LDL-C and confirmed a similar U-shaped association as stated above. They reported that this observation was present independent of statin therapy.27 Studies have found a better lifestyle, including higher physical activity and less smoking among patients with FH which may portend an overall improved cardiovascular health. Patients with FH, though at increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis, may have a more robust cardiometabolic reserve to survive acute stress such as MI.17\n\nFinally, ischaemic preconditioning, a concept widely proven to be protective in animal models but without much empirical backing in humans, has been considered as well.28 29\n\nWe also found a higher rate of revascularisation among patients with FH. This may be due to more STEMI and high-risk NSTEMI in this group. Evidence from previous studies supports this observation. For instance, in a case series of 45 young patients who underwent coronary angiography, those with FH had more complex CAD compared with those without FH.30 Similarly, a French registry study with 5147 patients found a higher prevalence of triple-vessel CAD among those with FH.31 Another review of the RICO database in 2021 by Yao et al found that definite FH, as determined by a Dutch lipid clinic network score >6, was associated with more complex coronary lesions, including a higher syntax score, more bifurcation lesions and more multivessel disease.32 In addition to the clinical outcomes, it is worth noting the healthcare utilisation among patients with FH. We observed a reduced length of stay in the hospital but no significant difference in total charges. However, a study by Patel et al, based on electronic record reviews, found high annual total revenue among patients with FH.33\n\nStudy strengths and limitations\n\nOur study was based on large, pooled data, which increased its power. With FH being an uncommon condition, our study design and large database of the NIS provide a good basis for hypothesis generation. The NIS is generated at the hospital level and weighted to reflect the US population thus a reliable source to make hypotheses about population-wide problems in the inpatient setting. One limitation is that the NIS may be subject to coding errors which puts it at risk of misclassification bias. Using a specific and sensitive endpoint such as all-cause mortality as a primary outcome minimises such risk. Our study includes data from 2018 to 2020 during which the NIS relies on ICD-10 codes that have improved specificity and are universally comparable. Additionally, most diagnoses of FH are made in the outpatient setting, often by experts in their field and often may require further testing including genetic study and thus are less likely to be misclassified.\n\nAnother limitation is that the NIS does not include information on outpatient care. An important limitation pertaining to this study is that the NIS does not contain codes for medical therapeutics. Nonetheless, the observations made raise pertinent hypotheses that may need future robust controlled trials to ascertain."
