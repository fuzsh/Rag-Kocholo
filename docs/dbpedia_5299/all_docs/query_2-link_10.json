        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nSclera, fibrous layer of eye coats posterior five sixths, and is composed of diverse size and shapes of collagen fibers, with haphazard alignment. In contrast, cornea has aligned collagenous framework, hence transparent. Sclera is thinnest at equator of eye where extraocular muscular attachments occur, thickest at back and weakest where optic nerve (ON) exits through it, imparting a sieve-like appearance called lamina cribrosa (LC).1 LC of optic nerve head (ONH) is a composite layer with mesh-like appearance due to penetrance of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons of retina.1 LC is thus a reticulated, porous anatomical part of sclera that plugs-in posterior scleral deficiency.2\n\nHistory of LC considered as main site of RGC damage dates well back.3 LC is considered a site for initiation of glaucoma pathology. ONH is defined as region from where RGCs exit eye, through LC via scleral canal.4 There are no histologically distinct layers of ONH, studies describe it to be consisting of superficial retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), prelaminar tissue (PT), laminar tissue composed of LC itself and retrolaminar layers.5-9\n\nGlaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible loss of vision worldwide.9 Historically glaucoma is defined as elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)> 21mmHg, attributed for obstruction to outflow of aqueous humor (AH) at trabecular meshwork, leading to chronic IOP elevation resulting in damage and paralleling visual field (VF) impairment.10 Studies done at population level reveal that about 1/3rd of glaucoma sufferers have normal levels of IOP. Thus, current revised definition can be “progressive, chronic optic neuropathy in adults where IOP and other unknown factors contribute to characteristic acquired atrophy of ON and loss of RGCs”.11 POAG is most predominant type, accounting for 3/4th of total burden. This form of ON atrophy is manifested by a cascade of clinical signs summiting at level of ON and whole spectrum is known as GON."
