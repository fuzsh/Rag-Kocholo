Some are better known than others but they all demonstrated a range of beautiful leadership qualities that we can learn from today.  In Paradigms of Leadership – an ongoing Lecture Series – Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad chooses exemplary figures in Islamic history of every generation, geography and gender, drawing out particular lessons for us: both in the way they carried themselves through society and in the principles they employed in handling the urgent challenges of their day.",
