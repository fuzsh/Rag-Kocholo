        "text": "Vijay Kedia has fairly admitted that his stock recommendations have not fared as well as expected. However, he has expressed confidence in the stocks and opined that they will also sparkle some day soon and deliver hefty gains to investors\n\nPortfolio is sluggish, stock recos are not doing well\n\nVijay Kedia‘s USP is his sincerity and honesty of approach.\n\nMost people, whether Gurus or novices, are loath to admit that they went wrong in their stock picks or recommendations.\n\nHowever, Vijay Kedia has no such qualms.\n\n“Whatever stocks we have discussed in the past, all have not fared well,” he admitted fairly to the distinguished interviewing panel of Ayesha Faridi, Abha Bakaya and Nikunj Dalmia.\n\nHe also disclosed that he has dumped some of the stocks and is holding on to some.\n\n“I quit Karnataka Bank a long time back …. Whatever we have discussed in the past on your channel, I am holding all those stocks …. Maybe I have sold a small portion of some of those stocks to buy some new stocks,” he stated.\n\nVijay Kedia’s latest portfolio looks as follows:\n\nPortfolio of Vijay Kedia as of 30.09.2019 Stock Name CMP (Rs) Nos of shares Value (Rs Cr) YoY Gain (%) Sudarshan Chemical 405 19,85,215 81 8.5 Vaibhav Global 833 7,00,000 58 28 Repro India 625 7,53,343 47 12 Cera Sanitaryware 2549 1,40,000 36 11 Everest Industries 297 7,65,000 23 (34) Lykis 20 41,84,383 9 (18) Kokuyo Camlin 71 10,10,000 7 (37) Affordable Robotic 65 10,72,000 7 (32) Cheviot Company 648 1,00,740 7 (4) Innovators Facade Systems 31 19,99,432 6 (50) Yash Papers 52 4,76,859 3 (12) Panasonic Energy 151 93,004 1 (38) Total 285\n\nAs we can see, Sudarshan Chemicals is the crown jewel of the portfolio with a massive allocation of Rs. 81 crore.\n\nIt is surprising that while other specialty chemical stocks are surging like rockets and delivering massive gains (see list), Sudarshan is sluggish.\n\nThankfully, Vaibhav Global brought a smile to Vijay Kedia’s face with a spirited performance and gains of 28%.\n\nIt may be recalled that Vijay Kedia has fondly described Vaibhav Global as the stock “he cannot take eyes off“. He has given 10 cogent reasons for his conviction in the stock.\n\nEverest Industries and Kokuyo Camlin, both of which were recommended to us, have disappointed with losses exceeding 30%.\n\nHowever, given the powerhouse credentials of both stocks, the under-performance may be temporary.\n\nCera Sanitaryware is in the limelight because Guy Spier, the accomplished value investor, has added it to his portfolio.\n\nGuy Spier’s interest in Cera is a clear indication that the stock is deeply undervalued, has margin of safety and is on a multibagger trajectory.\n\nSME Stocks\n\nVijay Kedia has also developed a penchant for investing in SME stocks.\n\nHe has two SME stocks in his portfolio, being Affordable Robotics and Innovators Facade Systems.\n\nBoth stocks are sluggish and have posted heavy losses.\n\nAccording to some experts, SME stocks are “Hero ya Zero” stocks, meaning that they can be either “multi-baggers” or “multi-beggars“, but nothing in between.\n\nYash Papers, new entrant in the portfolio\n\nVijay Kedia has added a new small-cap stock into his portfolio, namely, Yash Papers.\n\nApparently, the Company manufactures “compostible tableware” out of “sugarcane waste bagasse” and is likely to prosper in the crackdown against plastic.\n\nVijay Kedia’s allocation to Yash Papers is quite small at present.\n\nObviously, he will want the Company to prove its mettle before trusting it with more money.\n\nIf I have Rs. 5,000 Cr, I will invest in the same stocks\n\nVijay Kedia made it clear that he has full confidence in the stocks in his portfolio and that their under-performance is temporary.\n\n“I am fully convinced if I have Rs 5,000 crore today, I will invest in the market right now,” he roared.\n\n“Even if I am giving another chance, I do not think I will do something different or buy some other stock or sell the existing stocks. I am comfortable, I am okay with the stocks in my portfolio,” he added.\n\n“I am 100% invested since last 30 years,” he added emphatically.\n\n(Vijay Kedia flanked by Ramesh Damani and Raamdeo Agrawal)\n\nStay far away from ‘Bhangaar‘ stocks\n\nIt is well known that Vijay Kedia has been running a crusade to warn novices not to get trapped in ‘Bhangaar’ stocks.\n\nHe repeated the grim warning again.\n\n“Last Diwali, I thought that maybe 90% of the stocks in the market are bhangar (junk). This Diwali, I think 95% of the stocks are coming into that category. It is very difficult to say when all these stocks are going to revive,” he said.\n\nBottom is in place. Time is ripe to search for “diamonds” in “trash”\n\nVijay Kedia opined that the severe price correction coupled with the reforms introduced by the Government is sending the signal that the market has made a bottom and that we can resume our buying activity.\n\nHowever, he did caution that we have to keep the long-term horizon in mind and not expect quick-fire gains."
