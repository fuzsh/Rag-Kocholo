Ayesha Faridi, CNBC India's News Hottie

Overall Hotness: 7.5/10

Face: 8/10

Body: 7.5/10

Legs: 7/10

Personality: 7.5/10

CNBC India has a couple of hotties working the desk, Ayesha Faridi and Tanvir Gill. Of the two, I like Ayesha better, she's got more maturity and she's better looking overall.

I won't lie to you, the Indian accent when speaking english isn't all that attractive. But Ayesha more than makes up for it with her good looks. She has a really nice smile and her very nice teeth. Her hair is flowing and I like how she does her makeup. She does a kind of reality show called "Get a Life" and I took quite a bit of photos from there where she shows more of her body.

For an Indian chick, she has a decent rack. She's still really thin, but like I said, her boobs are nice. She seems to be a cool chick to hang out with, some of the pictures had her skydiving and clubbing and stuff.

This is what it says about her on CNBC's bio section:

She is a journalist by training, having graduated from Delhi University. Prior to joining CNBC TV18, she has worked as a reporter and producer with the BBC World Service and MTV India. She anchors Power Breakfast, CNBC TV18's morning news hour, Your Stocks a stocks query show and Get A Life, a daily lifestyle/arts segment. She also heads the news ticker team at CNBC-TV18. Also co-hosts the popular segment Saas Bahu & Sensex, alongwith Tanvir Gill.

I took this from one of her regular news segments for CNBC India,
