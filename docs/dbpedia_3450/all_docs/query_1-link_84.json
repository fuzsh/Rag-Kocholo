        "text": "Cheryl Birtwick is 16 years old, rich, and freshly orphaned. Having no home and no one left to care for her but a giant trust fund and a passel of attorneys, she is sent to live with Lane family. Tim Lane and his daughter in law and grandson live on a massive ranch with three horses. They are well loved in their small farming community, and treat everyone around them with love and respect. Tim even helps the other farmers around him by giving them the rights to some of his crops for very little money. The only problem is, Tim is also short on funds, as many of his neighbors are, and soon learns he may lose his home if he doesn't pay the bank $25,000. Cheryl learns that he needs money and does what she can to help her new family keep their home. In the meantime, Cheryl conquers her fear of horses and makes a strong bond with one of Tim's prize horses; Black Beauty.\n\nA mysteriously spreading period of postcard winter conditions, complete with snow, over most of the northern hemisphere shortly before Christmas influences several otherwise unrelated lives. Most obviously, weather channel presenter Billy, a former studio boss, whose show now becomes news again, gets to know his prompter text writer Joey. Businessman Warren, a gifted lier who pretends to be stuck in airports to explain his delay on the way home to his gullible wife, is found out and dumped by his conquest in Baltimore. Young mother Pilar, who got a bad custody deal for her darling little boy Miguel, is unable to deliver him to dad because of the snow; he asks the judge for full custody as punishment, but... Young Luke, who recently moved out of home, learns most of his guests, including his bossy mother, who came to cook the Christmas dinner where he is house-sitting, are stuck in traffic, so he decides to cook the goose with weird ex-socialite aunt Lula, who then forces him to a twist... In the South, even bride Stacey, who always got her way, is unable to wish away or ignore the unprecedented winter weather; the groom and her best friend, a cellist who nearly knows her from school, seize the opportunity... A bitter woman from greater Chicago visits Virginia and confronts her past...\n\nIt charts the breakdown of a working class family when the teenage daughter befriends a refugee girl. Helen has been married to Paul for 25 years. They live a monotonous and frozen existence. Helen is desperate, damaged, and looking for change. Paul - bitter, hypocritical and bigoted, sick and tired of being in the poverty trap - is on the brink of a breakdown. His biggest fear is change. Into their lives comes Tasha, a Romany Czech refugee, awaiting her British passport and her chance for freedom - a concept taken for granted by all those around her. Told in three revelatory narratives, each from a particular character's point of view, reveals how the disintegration of an ordinary working class family finally comes to a head when unexpected emotions are unleashed.\n\nOzzie (Steven Kynman) is a young koala living in Australia. He is kidnapped by two goons, Buzz Maroni (Peter Rowley) and Tank Emerson (Ralf Moeller), who work for Max Happy (Dame Joan Collins), President of Happy Toys. Legend says that Ozzie speaks English and Max wants to clone Ozzie into hundreds of koalas and sell them for a fortune as talking pets. Buzz and Tank \"lose\" Ozzie on the plane ride home by accident to Justin Morton (Spencer Breslin), an eight-year-old who is celebrating his birthday with his mom, Beth (Rachel Hunter), with a trip to Austrailia. Ozzie winds up in Justin's backpack. When Max finds out the koala is missing, a screwball comedy chase begins and ends in a surprise that knocks Max off her throne.\n\nLittle Men is a story that captures how we grow up. The film takes the question of, \"Whether girls should be allowed in the clubhouse,\" and focuses on the reality of the situation. The children, boys and girls, each realize if he or she is a leader or a follower, and struggle with this issue. The children, learning, fight to grow and to understand the next stage in their life, reminiscent for those who are already Big, and foretelling for those still Little.;"
