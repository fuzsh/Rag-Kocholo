        "text": "Influential Jewish guitarist Yossi Piamenta, often referred to as the “hassidic Hendrix,” has passed away at the age of 64 after a battle with cancer, according to The Jerusalem Post.\n\nBorn in Jerusalem in 1951, Piamenta moved to New York in the 70s. He notably shared the stage at B.B. King’s in 2004 with the likes of Jon Gutwilig, Marc Brownstein, Jamie Shields and others during an aftershow following the Jammys.\n\n“It’s very rare to find in any generation someone who is able to really come up with something new and have a unique style. He did it with his guitar and also his personality,” hassidic rocker Lazer Lloyd told The Jerusalem Post."
