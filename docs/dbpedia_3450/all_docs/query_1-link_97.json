We’ll always remember your amazing musicianship, your silly sense of humor, and your loving spirit. Some of our best gig stories occurred while you were at the helm of the drums, not to mention some of the best music. Sleep in peace Michael. See you in the stars.\n\nHazel Miller: I’m so sorry to hear that Michael Berry went home. He was a great person, musician and family man. He will be remembered always.\n\nBrian Mikulich: That’s terrible! I remember seeing Michael play with the group Rare Silk at a jazz event back in 1981 or so. It was the first time I heard a vocal rendition of “Spain”. His playing seemed so clean and tasty. After their set, I saw him walking by in the hallway and managed to say something like “Hey, um…you sound really good” in a dorky awkward teenage way. He stopped and looked at me, gave me a big smile and a nod and said “Thank you. Thank you very much” and walked away. When he said that, I saw a glint in his eye that suggested he was a very nice and sincere gentleman. That’s the only social exchange I ever had with Michael and I remember it vividly. RIP, Michael.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOther Notable Musicians’ Deaths…\n\nAugust 2015\n\n24: Vardo Rumessen, 73, Estonian musicologist and politician.\n\n23: Helen Kemp, 97, American singing teacher and choir director; Yosi Piamenta, 63, Israeli musician, cancer.\n\n22: Mariem Hassan, 56–57, Western Saharan singer, cancer.\n\n21: Daniel Rabinovich, 71, Argentine musician and comedian (Les Luthiers).\n\n19: Doudou N’Diaye Rose, 85, Senegalese drummer, composer and bandleader.\n\n18: Russell Henderson, 91, Trinidad-born British jazz musician; Roger Smalley, 72, British-born Australian composer."
