But with funky jams that fuse Jewish sounds with the sixties rock he was weaned on, it may be more appropriate to label him the Israeli-born Trey Anastasio. Now a resident of Canarsie, Brooklyn, Piamenta has recorded with Stan Getz and performs with a jam band that includes his flautist brother, Avi."
