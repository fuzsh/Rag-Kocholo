        "text": "Lubavitcher Rebbe on Torah Study\n\nTorah describes the symbiotic relationship between the sea-faring tribe of Zevulun and the scholarly tribe of Issachar. Zevulun supported the Torah study of Issachar, and shared in the merit of that study.\n\nAt the same time, Torah instructs all Jews, even the most philanthropic, not to suffice with supporting Torah scholars, but to engage in study themselves.\n\nIn this talk, the Rebbe demonstrates how even the busiest of people can toil in the study of Torah, “day and night.”\n\nPurim, 5732 – February 29, 1972\n\nFrom Living Torah Volume 144 Program 573\n\nCrown Heights Rallies Against Iran\n\nOn Wednesday August 26, NYS Senator Jesse Hamilton, NYS Assembly Member Dov Hikind, NYC Council Member David Greenfield, NYC Council Member Chaim Deutsch, and community advocates called for NY Congress Members to Vote Against Iran Nuclear Deal at a rally in Crown Heights.\n\nIn addition, community residents Rabbi Jacob Goldstein, Cantor Shlomie Rabin, and Devorah Halberstam joined in urging members of Congress to vote \"no\" on the Iran nuclear deal. Rabbi Jacob Goldstein, Chaplain Colonel (Ret.) of the US Armed Forces, served 38 years in the military including five deployed combat missions. Devorah Halberstam is the mother of the late Ari Halberstam, who was killed in the terrorist shooting on the Brooklyn Bridge in 1994.\n\nClick Here for pictures.\n\nA Crown Heights resident argues with Neturei Karta counter demonstrators across the street of 770 Eastern Parkway.\n\nIran Protest In Crown Heights Led By David Greenfield\n\nTwin Baby Girls Pretending to be Asleep\n\nThese clever twin babies know exactly how to pull the wool over their mum's eyes at bed time – by pretending to be asleep when she checks up on them.\n\nIn a hilarious video, twin toddlers are seen playful and giggly as they stand in their cot. As soon as their mother says \"Hi babies\" on the monitor, both hit the bed pretending to be fast asleep.\n\nThey certainly don't fool mum Judy Travis, who bursts out laughing on camera.\n\nThe 29-year-old Seattle resident shared the video online saying: \"I rarely talk with the girls through the baby monitor. But when I do, this usually happens.\"\n\nMan Apprehanded for Shoplifting in Williamsburg Pharmacy\n\nA Williamsburg pharmacy owner, along with his employee and an elderly bystander, managed to catch a shoplifter with a bagful of merchandise before he exited the store. Though the perp struggled to break free, the men were able to hold on to him long enough for Shomrim to arrive.\n\nThe incident occurred today, Tuesday, at the Remedies Pharmacy in the heart of Williamsburg, located on the corner of Bedford Ave. and Wallabout Street.\n\nThe suspect, a middle-aged African-American male, was alleged to have previously stolen from the pharmacy, and he was recognized by a store employee before making off again with a bag filled with stolen goods.\n\nThe storeowner and his employee managed to apprehend the thief and hold on to him – despite his fierce struggles – until Shomrim volunteers arrived and forced him into immediate compliance.\n\nThe entire drama was captured on video, which was obtained by CrownHeights.info\n\nWorld Record for Highest Cliff Jump\n\nA Brazilian-born canyoneer has set a pulsating world record after leaping almost 60 meters from a cliff and into a pool of water.\n\nLaso Schaller is a world-renowned canyoning expert who uses rope, harnesses and other rigging equipment to descend rivers in ways few others have before. The 27-year-old regularly leaps off 25m, 30m or even 35m cliffs, but recently decided to tackle Switzerland's famed Cascata del Salto waterfall for a world record cliff-jump attempt.\n\nWith the help of a support crew, Schaller spent several days building a high-dive platform and studying the cliff face before taking the leap which, to be exact, was from a height of 58.8 metres.\n\nTo further ensure his safety, the team also set six tanks in the pool to aerate the water and soften the landing.\n\nHis plunge was nevertheless horrifying, with a point of view camera that was mounted to his helmet providing a dizzying perspective of what he faced.\n\nIt's estimated Schaller reached a speed of 123km/h before he hit the water and even though his feet-first entry was perfect, he actually missed the landing zone and instead plunged into the harder water in the centre of the pool. The impact was akin to a gunshot, resulting in a mad scramble by rescuers who had to drag him back to dry land.\n\nSchaller was on his hands and knees for several tense moments before managing to climb onto his feet and raise his hands in triumph, triggering a roar of delight - and no doubt relief - from onlookers.\n\nIf you are scared of heights, don't watch this video."
