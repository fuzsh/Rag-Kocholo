        "text": "By Sandy Eller\n\nIssue of September 10, 2010/ 2 Tishrei 5771\n\nGershon Veroba, a Far Rockaway resident, is so much a local booster that he named his production company Town 6 Entertainment. So why would he go to the trouble of producing a concert in a venue 6,000 miles away?\n\n“A lot of Americans are in Israel for Sukkos, both visitors and yeshiva kids,” Veroba told The Jewish Star. “I wanted to offer wholesome entertainment for yeshiva kids that would attract Americans tourists as well. A concert offering quality music, but in Israel, where music is truly appreciated.”\n\nThat’s how Rock Ami (Rock My Nation) was born last year, and the formula worked. Veroba teamed up with an Israeli producer, RNY Productions, and featured performances by the Moshav Band, SoulFarm, Yossi Piamenta and by Veroba himself. Over 700 people attended and the concert was so successful, Veroba recalled, that long after the music ended, large circles of people still sat on the floor singing.\n\n“People in Israel are connecting with their core,” Veroba continued. “No more secrets, no more worrying about what people will think. So when they go to a concert, they are happy to sing along, something they would never do in the States, because they feel less inhibited in Israel.”\n\nRock Ami 2010 takes the stage at Jerusalem’s Kraft Stadium on Sept. 28, with a line-up that includes SoulFarm, Hamakor, Y-Love, Sabbo and Veroba’s fellow-Far Rockaway resident, guitarist Aryeh Kunstler.\n\nVeroba has big hopes for the Rock Ami festival which will also feature street performers, local artists and family activities.\n\n“I hope this grows and grows till we outgrow this stadium and move on to a bigger venue,” he said.\n\nWith appearances on over 50 Jewish albums, Veroba’s is one of the most storied careers in Jewish music. The son of a mixed marriage between a chazan (his father) and an opera singer (his mother), Veroba’s music career began in high school when he recorded his first song. He officially hit the Jewish music scene in 1983, appearing on an album with his band The Jewish Blues. Veroba’s solo debut, Man to Man, in 1983, made him the first Jewish music artist to perform all the vocals and instruments on an album. He recorded the album himself in his home.\n\nVeroba is best known to some fans for his Jewish-themed parodies of popular songs. One of his more popular tunes was a take on Billy Joel’s “Piano Man,” titled “Chazan Man.” Both Paul Simon and Ringo Starr have heard Veroba’s parodies and said they liked them, he said. Knowledgeable listeners to his “Variations” series recognize the musicianship Veroba demonstrated in recreating the original music.\n\nHe has ended his parody project, he said, explaining that he felt he had taken that particular style of music as far as he could. His most recent album was the a cappella “Little David,” released in 2009. Veroba also regularly performs with high end simcha bands.\n\nRabbi Eytan Feiner, rav of the White Shul, praised Veroba’s music, describing it as an “intricate tapestry woven from widespread diversity.”\n\n“It is music that moves you with lyrics that captivate and stir the soul to really think,” Rabbi Feiner said.\n\n“Music can be like a good sefer,” Veroba maintains. “In Israel they aren’t afraid to use music to deliver a meaningful message.”"
