        "text": "We‎ regret to inform you of the Petirah of Yossi Piamenta, the world-renowned Jewish singer and entertainer who was Niftar today following an illness. He was 64.\n\nThe following is from YWN:\n\nYossi had the Zechus to be Misameach thousands upon thousands of Chasanim and Kallah’s at weddings in the past 35 years. His music touched many of us, and many of his songs are played at weddings every night.\n\nYossi Piamenta was battling a dreaded illness since being diagnosed more than a year ago, as thousands of his fans continue to pray for his recovery.\n\nSadly, he was Niftar on Sunday afternoon.\n\nNever the one to say no, Yossi would always drop all he was doing and run to hospital or private home to cheer up those suffering from illness and disease. Yossi did countless amazing acts of chesed which did quietly for so many years. Chesed that we will never even know about.\n\nAlwasy seen with a huge smile, Yossi was always seen holding a Sefer Tehillim in his hands in between dance sets at weddings – praying for the unfortunate ones.\n\nPiamenta was born in Jerusalem, Israel in 1951 to Yehuda and Genia Piamenta. In 1962, when he was 12 years old, Piamenta moved with his family to Tel Aviv, Israel. There, he received his first guitar from his uncle, Albert Piamenta, an Israeli saxophonist. Growing up, he practiced traditional Judaism.\n\nIn his 20s, Piamenta moved to New York, together with his brother, Avi Piamenta, with the intention of working on a joint album with American saxophone player Stan Getz. The album was a success but Piamenta disapproved of the entertainment industry lifestyle and turned to religion, joining the Orthodox Jewish community.\n\nPiamenta lived in Flatbush, New York, for over 20 years before moving back to Israel.\n\nIn August 2014, Piamenta – together with Avi Piamenta and Naftali Kalfa – released a single, “Yaancha,” calling it a “prayer for Piamenta’s recovery.”\n\nEven after taking ill, Yossi traveled to the Gaza border during the last war to play for the soldiers.\n\nLevaya details have not yet been made available."
