        "text": "\"Kulanu\"\n\nThis was a song I composed and performed for the Kulanu Center for Special Services, an great organization that has served families for many decades. I was asked to create an emotional song that accurately conveys their mission, \"to enable each individual to reach their full potential, empowering them to become a participating and accepted member of society, with a good quality of life and a hopeful future.\"\n\n\"Save The Last Dance For Me\"\n\nA favorite of mine since I was a kid. This version is the arrangement Michael Bublé recently made famous and captures the spirit of the original with a bigger sound.\n\n\"King Of Tony's\"\n\nProduced by Aaron Appelbaum (Nafshenu Orchestra), this album was arranged by Yaron Gershovsky, engineered by Larry Gates, a\"h, featuring composer Eli Nathan, Dov Levine and myself. An amazing experience and a successful album that people still comment on today. This song was given to me as an acting performance as well as a dramatic vocal, so it presented some awesome artistic challenges in telling a story.\n\n\"I've Got You Under My Skin\"\n\nThere's nothing like performing a fully orchestrated Nelson Riddle arrangement of a Sinatra classic. It makes you want to be a better singer.\n\n\"It's Never Too Late\"\n\nOne of 2 songs I performed on the JEP 5 album. This one was recorded at Newfound Sound in New York City, engineered by the great Larry Gates, a\"h, performed with my buddy, Rivi Schwebel.\n\n\"Shower The People\"\n\nJames Taylor has been an influence on my music since his first album. I recorded this song more to put myself in his shoes than to make a performance demo, but I'm really proud of how it came out!\n\n\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\"\n\nBelieve it or not, I remember when this came out. Every note in the arrangement and every nuance Franki Valli put into it made an impression on me that will last a lifetime. I hope it shows.\n\n\"Little David \"\n\nComposed by Moshe Yess, this song's original title is \"The Fight In The Man.\" During religious mourning periods like post-Passover \"Omer\" and the \"3 Weeks\" in the summer approaching the Tish'a B'Av commemoration of the burning of the Holy Temple, many limit their music listening to songs containing only vocals and no instrumentation. This song, composed by my friend, Moshe Yess, a\"h, is a clever perspective of Jewish history and courage.\n\n\"Hand Of Hashem\"\n\nThis song was originally recorded on the Judaéa album in 1981. 10 years later, I was asked to perform it live at Brooklyn College as a one of the guest opening numbers for the Miami Boy Choir's first annual \"Miami Experience.\"\n\n\"Sweet Caroline\"\n\nI've always loved doing my Neil Diamond imitation, but now people actually pay me to do it! Here it is for FREE!\n\n\"September\"\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire, one of my favorite groups of all time, had songs that are funky, superior in production and innovative in arrangement and melody. \"September\" is a song I've recorded here for the original cover, as well as on my own \"Impressions\" album with lyrics re-written for Jewish life. You can check that one out, too, here."
