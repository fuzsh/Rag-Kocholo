RubyMine Description

You can take advantage of language-specific-aware syntax and error highlighting, code formatting and completion, as well as quick documentation. Smart search allows you to jump to any class or file, symbol, or any IDE action, tool window, using smart search. You only need one click to switch between the super method, declaration, test, usages and implementation. You can navigate in Rails projects with super-fast navigation thanks to an MVC-based view and model, class, gem dependencies diagrams, and a project view and model. Code inspections are a great way to follow community best practices. They check your code for any errors and offer quick fixes. Automated, but safe refactorings make your code cleaner and easier to maintain. Rails-aware Refactorings allow you to make project-wide changes. For example, renaming a controller will also rename views, helpers, and tests.
