        "text": "Code inspections\n\nIn PyCharm, there is a set of code inspections that detect and correct abnormal code in your project. The IDE can find and highlight various problems, locate dead code, find probable bugs, spelling problems, and improve the overall code structure.\n\nInspections can scan your code in all project files or only in specific scopes (for example, only in production code or in modified files).\n\nEvery inspection has a severity level â the extent to which a problem can affect your code. Severities are highlighted differently in the editor so that you can quickly distinguish between critical problems and less important things. PyCharm comes with a set of predefined severity levels and enables you to create your own.\n\nInspections and their settings are grouped in profiles. Each profile contains the information on the enabled inspections, a scope of files that they analyze, and their severity levels.\n\nAccess all available inspections and their settings\n\nIn the Settings dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S) , go to Editor | Inspections.\n\nUse to filter the inspection list. For example, you can filter inspections by severity or by language.\n\nCode inspections with Qodana\n\nOn top of running code inspections in your IDE, you can inspect your code using Qodana:\n\nRun PyCharm inspections locally including your IDE, and as a part of CI/CD pipelines.\n\nRun resource-consuming inspections using your CI/CD infrastructure.\n\nEnforce quality standards with quality gates in your CI system.\n\nShare the same inspection profile, both within the IDE and the CI tool.\n\nAccess inspections that are available only in Qodana, such as security checks and license audits.\n\nAccess historical overviews of inspection results\n\nYou can compare inspection results between commits to better understand your progress.\n\nFor more information, refer to Qodana.\n\nYou can use the PyCharm command-line interface to run inspections.\n\nLast modified: 26 May 2024"
