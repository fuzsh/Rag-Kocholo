One of the most wanted TeamCity features was to have .NET inspections results right on build server. Starting with the latest EAP you have it!\n\nThe only thing you need to do to get all the benefits of ReSharper’s analysis right in TeamCity is to add Inspections (.NET) build runner as a build step to your build configuration.\n\nConfiguration is quite easy, so let’s just take a look at how the results look when this runner is configured – you can find them at the dedicated “Code Inspections” tab of the build results.\n\nHere we’ve got all the usuall options like exploring overal inspections statistic, opening problematic sources in IDE, viewing inspections description, etc.\n\nMoreover, using this build runner together with another fresh feature – build failure conditions, you can update your builds status based on of inspections results.\n\nWhat’s next? First of all, in the nearest future it will be possible to share ReSharper inspections settings profile between your team members and use this profile in TeamCity build. More to come, you will be able to ask TeamCity to run custom inspections related to your code base as well.\n\nAs always, your comments and feedback are very much welcome. To try it, install TeamCity 7.0 EAP build.\n\nEnjoy!"
