        "text": "Severity levels of code inspections\n\nEach JetBrains Rider code inspection has one of the following severity levels:\n\nError\n\nCode inspections with this severity level are aimed at code issues that either prevent your code from compiling or result in runtime errors. Most of these inspections are not configurable, that is you cannot disable them or change their severity level.\n\nIn design-time inspection, JetBrains Rider displays unresolved symbols in red:\n\nand highlights erroneous statements or part of them with a red curly underline:\n\nIf there is at least one error in the current file, the status indicator displays the Error icon, and red markers are shown for each error on the error stripe.\n\nCode issues that are found with inspections having the 'Error' severity level, appear in the All Solution Files tab of the Problems tool window Alt+6 if the solution-wide analysis is enabled.\n\nWarning\n\nThis severity level corresponds to compiler warnings and to other issues that do not prevent your code from compiling but may nevertheless represent serious coding inefficiencies. For example, JetBrains Rider informs you about redundant type casts or namespace import directives, incorrect format strings, declared but never used local variables or private fields, unused private methods, and so on.\n\nIn design-time inspection, JetBrains Rider displays redundant symbols with greyed text:\n\nand highlights statements or part of them with a yellow curly underline:\n\nIf there is at least one warning in the current file, the status indicator displays the Warning icon, and yellow markers are shown for each warning on the error stripe.\n\nWarnings also appear in the All Solution Files tab of the Problems tool window Alt+6 if the solution-wide analysis with warnings is enabled\n\nSuggestion\n\nCode issues with this severity level provide insights into code structure, drawing your attention to things that aren't necessarily bad or wrong, but probably useful to know.\n\nIn design-time inspection, JetBrains Rider highlights suggestions with a green curly underline:\n\nand adds green markers for each warning on the error stripe.\n\nHint\n\nThis is the lowest severity level. Code issues with this severity bring your attention to a particular code detail and/or recommends a way of improvement.\n\nIn design-time inspection, JetBrains Rider highlights hints by adding a dashed green underline to the initial two letters of the corresponding symbol:\n\nUnlike errors, warnings and suggestions, hints are not taken into account when you navigate between code issues in the editor, and not shown in the error stripe.\n\nNote that when you place the caret over a highlighted hint, no popup is shown, the corresponding message only appears in the status bar."
