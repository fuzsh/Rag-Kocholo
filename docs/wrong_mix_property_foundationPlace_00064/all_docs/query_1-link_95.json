        "text": "Created with love by Miodec.\n\nSupported and expanded by many awesome people.\n\nLaunched on 15th of May, 2020.\n\ntotal tests started\n\n-\n\n-\n\ntotal typing time\n\n-\n\n-\n\ntotal tests completed\n\n-\n\n-\n\ndistribution of time 60 leaderboard results (wpm)\n\nabout\n\nMonkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. It features many test modes, an account system to save your typing speed history, and user-configurable features such as themes, sounds, a smooth caret, and more. Monkeytype attempts to emulate the experience of natural keyboard typing during a typing test, by unobtrusively presenting the text prompts and displaying typed characters in-place, providing straightforward, real-time feedback on typos, speed, and accuracy.\n\nTest yourself in various modes, track your progress and improve your speed.\n\nword set\n\nBy default, this website uses the most common 200 words in the English language to generate its tests. You can change to an expanded set (1000 most common words) in the options, or change the language entirely.\n\nkeybinds\n\nYou can use tab and enter (or just tab if you have quick tab mode enabled) to restart the typing test. Open the command line by pressing ctrl/cmd + shift + p or esc - there you can access all the functionality you need without touching your mouse\n\nstats\n\nwpm - total number of characters in the correctly typed words (including spaces), divided by 5 and normalised to 60 seconds.\n\nraw wpm - calculated just like wpm, but also includes incorrect words.\n\nacc - percentage of correctly pressed keys.\n\nchar - correct characters / incorrect characters. Calculated after the test has ended.\n\nconsistency - based on the variance of your raw wpm. Closer to 100% is better. Calculated using the coefficient of variation of raw wpm and mapped onto a scale from 0 to 100.\n\nresults screen\n\nAfter completing a test you will be able to see your wpm, raw wpm, accuracy, character stats, test length, leaderboards info and test info. (you can hover over some values to get floating point numbers). You can also see a graph of your wpm and raw over the duration of the test. Remember that the wpm line is a global average, while the raw wpm line is a local, momentary value. (meaning if you stop, the value is 0)\n\nbug report or feature request\n\nIf you encounter a bug, or have a feature request - join the Discord server, send me an email, a direct message on Twitter or create an issue on GitHub.\n\nsupport\n\nThanks to everyone who has supported this project. It would not be possible without you and your continued support.\n\ncontact\n\nIf you encounter a bug, have a feature request or just want to say hi - here are the different ways you can contact me directly.\n\ncredits\n\nMontydrei for the name suggestion\n\nEveryone who provided valuable feedback on the original reddit post for the prototype of this website\n\nSupporters who helped financially by donating, enabling optional ads or buying merch\n\nContributors on GitHub that have helped with implementing various features, adding themes and more\n\ntop supporters"
