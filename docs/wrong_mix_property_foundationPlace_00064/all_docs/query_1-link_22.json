        "text": "You may have discovered that AppNee has hardly been updated in recent months, and the missing download links in many posts cannot be repaired. The reason is that our 2TB hard drive is physically dead (the data on it cannot be recovered with a normal recovery), and everything about our website is stored on it (the source code of website and software projects, especially all released and reserved versions of software – many of them are out of print, and you can’t find and download them anywhere except AppNee on the entire Internet).\n\nIn an effort to make up as much of the loss as possible, until recently we were able to revert updates to some smaller apps. Later, we will try to restore all software updates if possible, but we still can’t fix any older versions of software – because this data disaster is the worst in the past 10 years, there is any backup.\n\nSince advertising revenue can no longer offset the expenditure of VPS and bandwidth, AppNee finally decided to block ad-block plugins since August; if the result is not as expected, we may manually block all users who are blocking AppNee’s ads according to the server log.\n\nIt’s a pity to do so, but this website has reached an unsustainable bottom line. If you can’t accept it, please switch to other similar websites that can be found everywhere on the Internet. In addition, to block appnee.com, you can use hosts or firewall."
