        "text": "If this checkbox is selected, on hitting a breakpoint, IntelliJ IDEA will show the location of this breakpoint in the editor and will attempt to bring its frame to the front.\n\nSelect how you want to remove breakpoints:\n\nBy clicking them with the left mouse button\n\nBy dragging them to the editor or clicking them with the middle mouse button. In this case, clicking a breakpoint will toggle its state between enabled and disabled.\n\nYou can also choose whether you want a confirmation dialog to be displayed when you are about to remove a conditional or a logging breakpoint\n\nWith this option you can control whether the -Djava.compiler=NONE parameter is specified when the application is launched. This parameter affects JIT compiler, and if the option is turned on, JIT compiler will be disabled.\n\nThe alternative source switcher appears on top of the editor if in project there is more than one class with the same fully qualified name.\n\nUse this spin box to specify the port on which the built-in web server runs. By default, this port is set to 63342 through which IntelliJ IDEA accepts connections from services. You can set the port number to any other value starting with 1024 and higher.\n\nIf this checkbox is selected, then the files on the built-in server running on the specified port are accessible from another computer.\n\nIf this checkbox is cleared (by default), then the debugger listens only to local connections.\n\nFor security reasons, any request to a page on the built-in server from outside IntelliJ IDEA is by default rejected and a Page 404 is displayed.\n\nTo allow access to the requested page, select the Allow unsigned requests checkbox."
