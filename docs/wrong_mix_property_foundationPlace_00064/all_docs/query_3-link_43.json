        "text": "Work offline\n\nA lot of features in IntelliJ IDEA require access to the Internet. If you are working offline (for example, in an isolated environment), there are some aspects that you should keep in mind.\n\nAccess documentation offline\n\nIf you don't have internet access to view the online help, you can use the IntelliJ IDEA Help plugin, which serves the help pages via the built-in web server for offline use.\n\nBy default, IntelliJ IDEA is configured to check for updates automatically and notify you when a new version is available. Updates are usually patch-based: they are applied to the existing installation and only require you to restart the IDE. However, sometimes patch updates are not available, and a new version of IntelliJ IDEA must be installed.\n\nIf IntelliJ IDEA does not have HTTP access outside your local network, it will not be able to check for updates and apply patches. In this case, you have to download new versions of the IDE and install them manually as described in Standalone installation.\n\nFor more information, refer to Update IntelliJ IDEA.\n\nPlugins\n\nUsually, plugins are installed from JetBrains Marketplace. However, you can set up a custom plugin repository in your local network and configure IntelliJ IDEA to use it for installing and updating plugins.\n\nAlternatively, you can download and manually install plugins from disk.\n\nLicense activation\n\nYou can evaluate IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate for up to 30 days. After that, buy and register a license to continue using the product.\n\nIf IntelliJ IDEA does not have HTTP access outside your local network, you will not be able to use the JetBrains Account for signing in. However, you can generate an offline activation code that will be valid during your subscription term.\n\nIf your organization has at least 50 active subscriptions or licenses of JetBrains products, you can use the Floating License Server to activate IntelliJ IDEA instances within your company network. Keep in mind that the License Server itself requires internet access for connecting to the JetBrains Account.\n\nFor more information, refer to Register IntelliJ IDEA.\n\nCode inspections\n\nSome code inspections verify external resources. For example, the Non-existent web resource inspection highlights dead links. If you don't have internet access, these inspections will not work and dead links will not be highlighted.\n\nFor more information, refer to Code inspections.\n\nExternal documentation\n\nExternal documentation opens the necessary information in a web browser so that you can navigate to related symbols and keep the information for further reference at the same time. However, if you don't have an internet connection, online documentation is not accessible. In this case, you can download it and open it by means of the Quick Documentation popup.\n\nAccess SDK documentation offline\n\nDownload the documentation package of the necessary version.\n\nThe documentation package is normally distributed in a ZIP archive that you need to unpack once it is downloaded.\n\nFor example, you can download the official Java SE Development Kit 20 Documentation and unzip it.\n\nIn the Project Structure dialog Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S, select SDKs.\n\nSelect the necessary JDK version if you have several JDKs configured, and open the Documentation Path tab on the right.\n\nClick the icon and specify the directory with the downloaded documentation package (for example, C:\\Users\\jetbrains\\Desktop\\docs\\api).\n\nApply the changes and close the dialog.\n\nAccess library documentation offline\n\nYou can add downloaded documentation to your project to be able to access it offline.\n\nIn the main menu, go to File | Project Structure Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S and click Libraries.\n\nSelect the library for which you want to add the documentation and click in the right section of the dialog.\n\nIn the dialog that opens, select the file with the documentation and click Open.\n\nApply the changes and close the dialog.\n\nWhen the documentation is downloaded and configured, hover over the necessary symbol in the editor or place the caret at the symbol, and press Ctrl+Q (View | Quick Documentation).\n\nFor more information, refer to Quick Documentation.\n\nVersion control systems\n\nMost likely, your source code is under some sort of version control system (VCS). If a remote repository is not in your local network, and there is no internet access, IntelliJ IDEA will not be able to communicate with the VCS. For example, if you are using Git, you will be able to commit your changes but wonât be able to push them to the remote repository or pull updates from it.\n\nFor more information about VCS integration, refer to Version control.\n\nTasks and issue trackers\n\nYou can set up a connection with an issue tracker to work with tasks and bugs assigned to you directly from IntelliJ IDEA. For example, you can connect to YouTrack, Jira, GitHub, and so on.\n\nIf the issue tracker server is not in your local network, and there is no internet access, IntelliJ IDEA will not be able to sync your issues. In this case, you will be able to work only with local tasks that you create yourself.\n\nFor more information, refer to Manage tasks and contexts.\n\nMaven dependencies\n\nBy default, Maven connects to remote repositories and checks for updates on every launch. Resolving Maven dependencies can require downloading new artifacts. You can switch to offline mode if you want Maven to use only those resources that are available locally.\n\nSwitch Maven to offline mode\n\nIn the Maven tool window, click .\n\nThis will append the --offline option to all Maven commands that IntelliJ IDEA runs. It will also report any items that cannot be found in the local repository.\n\nUsage statistics\n\nWhen you run IntelliJ IDEA for the first time, you are prompted whether to send anonymous data on the features and plugins you use, your hardware and software configuration, file types, number of files per project, and so on. This does not include any personal or sensitive data, such as parts of your source code or file names. This information is collected in accordance with the JetBrains Privacy Policy and is used to help improve the products and overall experience.\n\nEven if you enable anonymous usage statistics, it will not be sent if there is no HTTP access outside your local network. Also, you can disable this feature entirely if you agreed at first and then changed your mind later.\n\nDisable sending usage statistics\n\nIn the Settings dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S) , select Appearance & Behavior | System Settings | Data Sharing.\n\nClear the Send usage statistics checkbox.\n\nLast modified: 11 February 2024"
