        "text": "Hello everyone, personally I’m a big fan of jetbrains products and your IDE, when I saw the elixir plugin (although it’s not official obviously) caused me great excitement since it has all the features I could wish for.\n\nHowever…and after configuring both erlang and elixir sdk, it seems that autocomplete only works with the projects I create from scratch inside intellij…if I try to import an existing project, with a mix file, following the instructions that appear in the readme of the plugin, I simply don’t have any autocomplete or jump to source code or any other cool functionality.\n\nHas anyone had this problem and solved it?\n\nthank you very much to everybody\n\nI use it with RubyMine and it works very well for me. I get autocomplete, jump to definition, debugger, test runner, etc.\n\nNot sure which JetBrains IDE in particular you are using, but the single language (‘small’) IDE’s don’t have a global SDK setting like IntelliJ itself does, but once set for a project, it should remember it. You just have to remember to do it when you open an existing directory as a ‘new project’ in the IDE the first time or you’ll get a message that the Elixir Facet SDK is not defined.\n\nDepending upon the OS and how you installed Elixir/Erlang, you may just not be pointed at the correct directory. Open the options under Elixir in the Languages & Frameworks under settings and make sure that both the Elixir and Erlang directories are pointed at legit locations for your installations. I have had situations where setting it from the top level didn’t set both correctly underneath so I always set both underneath by expanding the setting menu. I’m on OSX and have used it with both HomeBrew, and now ASDF installations of Elixir and Erlang with no problems.\n\nIf you still have problems, open an issue on GitHub or message @KronicDeth. He’s usually quite responsive and helpful.\n\nEDIT - so I just tried it with a NEW project and you are correct that you can’t get the SDK to set for some reason. My older projects work fine. I see a few others posting the same…I just haven’t created one from scratch yet. Hopefully, he’ll have an update out soon.\n\nEDIT #2 - OK for RM I have a work around that may be similar to what you’re doing. It seems there is a bug in the latest JetBrains IDE where it won’t let you set the main Ruby SDK if you open an existing directory as a project. In the small IDE’s the primary language SDK has to be set in order to set the Elixir SDK. Since RM is not setting the Ruby SDK, the plugin cannot set the Elixir one as an addon module. What worked for me was to create an empty Ruby project and specify a Ruby SDK. This creates literally an empty directory…then do mix new with that same directory name and let it write into that directory. The Ruby version sticks, allowing setting of the Elixir one. I think this is more a JetBrains issue than an issue with the Elixir plugin."
