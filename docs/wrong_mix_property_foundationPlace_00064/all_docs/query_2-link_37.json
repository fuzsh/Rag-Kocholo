        "text": "<<Hi Nicola, I just got inspired by this thank-you message and decided to send one as well :) I think you are doing a really important thing, especially for younger professionals. You are helping them understand how they can build their careers at home, in local communities, and in Europe, showing that not all roads lead to the USA. Your blog has helped me a lot with my anxiety about \"choosing\" the right path, by showcasing more of the opportunities available and concentrating the european tech community, with a clearer realization of what my actual needs are. That's great!>> Such a great message to receive! - Important thing for younger professionals - Help them understand how to build their careers at home in local communities - In Europe - Showing how not all roads lead to USA - Your blog has helped me a lot with my anxiety (!!) - Showcasing more of the opportunities available - Concentrating the European community How nice in that? ü•π I‚Äôll be honest, putting yourself out there in this content game, being your true self as much as possible, is not easy. On social media, some people will like what you say, some people will not. I received this message in a moment where I wasn‚Äôt feeling super happy about my LinkedIn journey, and this person's kind words warmed my heart ü•∞ Checkout theeuropeanengineer.com to get tons of free content to help you navigate the weird world of Tech in Europe. Letsgoo\n\nIf you want to achieve anything remarkable in your career, you‚Äôll need to grind. If you grind for a long enough period of time, doing something you‚Äôre not in love with, you‚Äôll burn out. To achieve what I believe is something significant within CS careers, I had to grind a lot. I loved a lot of it: the CS ‚Äúsub-culture‚Äù and ‚Äúmodernity‚Äù of the field, the flexibility of CS jobs, CS as a science (the abstraction of it yet its enormous implementation potentials), I liked how close it was to mathematics (my favourite science), the internet, etc. Did I love all of it? No. Did I burn out a bit? Yes. If instead of switching to CS after my BSc in Automation Engineering, I had sticked to Automation Engineering, could have I achieved similar results? Yes. At least in theory. Since there were too many things about Automation Engineering that were bugging me, I would have probably burnt out much more. Now an anecdote: Before joining Oracle, I had an interview with an SVP there. I asked him if he had any advice to have a remarkable career in tech. He said: \"Work very hard, at least early in your career. Later on, as your skills compound, you can relax a bit.\" I asked: \"How do I avoid burning out when working a lot?\" Him: \"Try to work on things you genuinely like. You'll still burnout. But you'll burnout less.\" I love this advice. It's harsh, but it's true. At least in my experience. I'm not saying it's worth it to grind to have a remarkable career. This would depend on the individual‚Äôs personality, values and overall life goals. I'm only saying that IMO a high degree of intensity and hard work is required to achieve anything significant, especially in highly competitive fields. And that it's easier to be intense if you genuinely love what you do. Thoughts?\n\nNone of my parents went to uni. They barely funded my BSc (had to work part-time throughout all of it). I graduated from a degree I wasn‚Äôt really into. Somehow managed to pivot to CS. Landed a dev job in Switzerland. An internship at Amazon Barcelona. Finally, a 200k job in Big Tech Switzerland. Is a 200k Big Tech job in Europe an ‚Äúimpressive achievement‚Äù? Maybe. One of my friends is from the US, his dad has a 20 years career in tech, his older brother was making 500k in Big Tech before my friend even graduated. He almost defaulted to a 200k tech job early in his career, and has then grown his career to being a staff dev, with a 500k-700k TC. Does it make sense for me to compare my achievements to his? No‚Ä¶ Was I \"unlucky\"? Also no. - I was lucky to have a family that instilled in me the value of education and always made me feel like I could do anything I wanted in life. - I am very lucky to have an EU passport. - I've always been quite healthy. - I have talents like being good at analytical and creative problem solving. - I was lucky to easily find a path that fit my talents and situation. Maybe you didn't have these or other advantages. Should you feel sad about it? Would it make sense for you to compare your career milestones to someone else‚Äôs achievements? No. I understand that having a feeling of progress is good, and that having measurable results makes it easy to track progress. But never make the mistake of comparing yourself to others. First of all, you don't know about the challenges that other people‚Äîwho might seem ahead of you in some aspects‚Äîexperience in other areas of their life (areas where you might be thriving). Second: It‚Äôs your life. Your journey. Look outwards for inspiration. Look inwards for self-worth. You are the one in charge of the \"performance evaluation of your life\". Also, chill out. Life is much bigger than any \"career milestone\" you might be worrying about today. Attached, a video to help us put things in perspective. üôÇ"
