Check out what’s new:\n\nSupport for local Go installations with asdf. asdf is a CLI tool that lets you manage multiple language runtime versions. In response to feedback from the community, we’ve decided to include it in the upcoming version.\n\nCustom message formatting for printf-like functions. This feature allows for the provision of hints and highlights for message formats in custom functions.\n\nExtract Parameter refactoring. The 2023.3 release comes with the first part of the highly anticipated Extract Parameter refactoring. The Create Parameter quick-fix for unresolved references allows you to select an unresolved reference and use the quick-fix option to create a parameter.\n\nCreate function quick-fix. This quick-fix allows you to type a non-existing function name and then generate implementation in a package of your choice.\n\nSwitch generation for enums. GoLand can now assist in writing switch statements for enums. It suggests generating cases for all the values in completion.\n\nParameter hints for slice expressions. Slice expressions can be confusing, especially those with three indices. GoLand will now show you hints while you’re building slices.\n\nImproved error handlers and code folding. In 2023.3, you’ll have more options to set up code folding for better readability. You can manage the folding options in Settings | Editor | General | Code folding.\n\nCode coverage profiles for programs. This feature allows you to see exactly what code has been reached in single or multiple runs. It also helps detect dead code.\n\nApart from the listed GoLand-specific functionality, you’ll find dozens of features implemented in IntelliJ IDEA and WebStorm and supported by GoLand.\n\nHere are some highlights:\n\nExtended Dev Containers support provides a convenient and fast way to integrate additional tools, runtimes, and libraries essential for development.\n\nKubernetes tooling with multiple enhancements available out of the box.\n\nYou can now create public or private GitLab snippets directly within the IDE.\n\nThe debugger now features the Run to Cursor inlay option.\n\nThe all-in-one diff viewer allows you to see all the modified files from a changeset in a single, scrollable frame instead of going through each file one by one.\n\nThe HTTP Client received several large improvements, including an enhanced Structure view, support for in-place variables, and OAuth 2.0 support.\n\nThat’s it for today!\n\nWe need your feedback to make new features even better. Share your thoughts on Twitter, leave your comments below, open an issue in our tracker, or drop us a message in the #goland-gophers Slack channel.\n\nHappy developing!"
