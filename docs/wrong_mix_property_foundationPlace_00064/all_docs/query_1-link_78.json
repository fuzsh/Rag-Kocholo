        "text": "Igor Bukhman, the billionaire cofounder of the gaming giant Playrix, has thousands of employees divided between Russia and Ukraine. The war sparked an internal battle at his company and now Bukhman finds himself in the middle.\n\nBy Iain Martin & Jemima McEvoy\n\nIgor Bukhman awoke on the morning of February 24 in his West London home to a text message from the manager of one of Playrix’s Ukrainian studios: “It’s started,” read the text, which followed with a photo of the manager’s wife cradling a shotgun, and their daughter sheltering in their basement from Russian airstrikes.\n\nBukhman flicked on the TV. The invasion was all over it. He skimmed news apps on his phone. “We didn’t really believe it would happen,” says Bukhman, a Russia-born billionaire who has thousands of employees working on mobile games in Russia and Ukraine. While he reeled in shock, his Ukrainian staff swung into action.\n\nSlack channels normally busy with collegial chat, funny memes and updates about the company’s stable of games now thrummed with talk of evacuations and aid donations. “We are not hands-on with everything. They started reacting much faster than we did,” says Bukhman of his 1,500 employees in the war zone. “I knew the main decisions and provided resources, but I believed this would all be over in a few days.”\n\nIgor and his younger brother, Dmitri, who share decision making at the 18-year-old company—games such as Fishdom and Gardenscapes are the source of the pair’s more than $16 billion combined fortune—were soon pacing the historic streets between their residences in the affluent London district of Kensington, hashing out a plan. “We are not a big company,” Bukhman, 40, says. “I mean, we have big revenues, but we are just two people, and we have managers, but they are working on games. We don’t have a plan B.”\n\nHours into the invasion the brothers put their Ukrainian staff on paid leave. In the next two days they set up hotlines to help employees evacuate, and 48 hours later paid a bonus equivalent to a month’s salary to their entire 4,000-person workforce, including the 1,500 in Russia. Bukhman says the payment reassured staff about the company’s stability and supported not just Ukrainians on the front lines but Russians hit by the collapse of the ruble.\n\n“We won’t be able to continue working the way we worked before, but I think we will be able to continue working in Ukraine.”\n\nBut the pair soon found themselves on the back foot again. Even as hundreds of their colleagues scrambled for safety, clashes between Playrix staff broke out on Slack. After a few swapped jokes, a Ukraine-based employee hit back: “It’s probably easy and fun for you. . . . You didn’t wake up at five in the morning to an incredible ‘boom.’ ”\n\nOver the next few days, these spats spun into “outbursts of uncontrolled hatred between employees,” Bukhman says. At first the brothers urged an end to “political” discussions; company moderators then started deleting posts about the war before shutting down the Slack channels entirely. Some employees were furious; at least one quit. “We do not forbid anyone to express their opinion publicly. We only ask that we leave at least a few channels as a space for business communication,” Bukhman told staff in a note. “We are literally between two fires. It’s difficult for us to make decisions, but we must do it.”\n\nPlayrix and its billionaire founders are in a tough spot, but they’re hardly alone. Many entrepreneurs turned to Russia and Ukraine in recent years to tap cheap tech talent. Now they find their businesses in a war zone. Grammarly, based in San Francisco but started by two Ukraine-born billionaires, Alex Shevchenko and Max Lytvyn, opened an office with 128 workstations in Kyiv in 2020. Snapchat and Lyft also had offices there, while Amazon-owned Ring employed more than 1,000 contractors in the Ukrainian capital. IPG Photonics, Ubisoft and World of Tanks game developer Wargaming have (or had) significant Moscow outposts.\n\nMany Ukrainian professionals are among the 3.7 million who have fled to neighboring countries, while others, mainly men, have swapped their keyboards for Kalashnikovs. One of the earliest civilians killed was Tatiana Perebeinis, the chief accountant of Palo Alto search optimization startup SE Ranking.\n\nAt the same time, tens of thousands of Russian tech workers—who either oppose the war or have found that sanctions and Russian internet restrictions have made it impossible to work—have decamped to Armenia, Georgia and Turkey. Bukhman has no plans to pull out of Russia but says Playrix has already helped around 10% of his 1,500 Russian staff relocate abroad.\n\nOther companies have taken a harder line. JetBrains, the Prague-based company that owns Android’s key coding language and which is run by two Russian billionaires, Sergey Dmitriev and Valentin Kipyatkov, shuttered its Russia offices in March. Staff who won’t move to the Czech Republic or elsewhere will be let go. JetBrains won’t say how many of its 1,900 employees are affected, but last April it announced a 1,000-desk campus expansion in St. Petersburg and had offices in Moscow and Siberia.\n\nBuzzy San Francisco-based workplace collaboration startup Miro, which raised $400 million at a $17.5 billion valuation in January, also closed its Russia office and terminated workers who wouldn’t move. “There’s an exodus of tech companies from Russia because it’s economic suicide to stay, and it’s physically not safe to be there now,” says Mikhail Mizhinsky, managing director of Relocode, a London-based firm that helps Russian startups set up shop in Europe.\n\nRussia is trying to halt the brain drain with a new tax break that exempts tech companies and their workers from income tax for three years. The government is also promising that tech workers will be exempt from any military draft. But as sanctions ramp up and air routes out of Russia close, it probably isn’t enough to convince anyone to stay.\n\nThe war hits very close to home for some, such as Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko, the billionaire cofounders of British digital bank Revo­lut, which at a recent $33 billion is one of the world’s most valuable startups. Storonsky’s father was born in Ukraine; he grew up in Russia but left at age 20 and is now 37 and a British citi­zen. Yatsenko, who called Vladimir Putin “one of the most brazen liars in history” the day the war broke out, hails from the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, now largely destroyed by Russian artillery.\n\n“When I was growing up, the notion of war between Russia and Ukraine was unthinkable. Not just because war and the loss of innocent lives is always wrong, but because to me, Ukrainians and Russians are kin,” wrote Storonsky in a blog post on March 1 that condemned the war but stopped short of criticizing Russia itself. He led an appeal that raised $11 million from his customers for Ukrainian Red Cross. Revolut, which at the start of the conflict had around 50 employees in Ukraine and a small number in Russia, kicked in another $2 million.\n\nFifteen hundred miles from Kyiv, Playrix’s discreet offices in a business park in Dublin’s suburbs lie nearly deserted while outside the Irish celebrate St. Patrick’s Day. Bukhman snaps down the boardroom’s blinds to dim the sun streaming over the craggy Dublin Mountains. “Some of us work on the Russian calendar,” he says with a shrug.\n\nPlayrix has billed itself as an international company, albeit a mostly Russian-speaking one, since the brothers moved it to safe (and low-tax) Dublin in 2013. The company’s comfortably plush offices now nestle among neighbors like Microsoft Ireland. It’s a world away from Playrix’s origins in the bedroom the Bukhman brothers shared growing up in Vologda, a small Russian city some 300 miles northeast of Moscow.\n\nTheir father, who trained as a veterinarian but worked as a security guard, and their mother, who was a hiring mana­ger at the city’s big employer, a ball bearing factory, struggled to make ends meet, Bukhman says. “We always had food, but by the end of the month there was no money.”\n\nGrowing up in one of the few Jewish families in the remote city, which even Russians know mainly from an eponymous Soviet-era pop song, left Bukhman feeling like something of an outsider. “In a way I didn’t feel Russian,” he says. “It was hard for me to say publicly that I was Jewish even though we never personally faced any kind of direct anti-Semitism, but we heard from our parents and grandparents that you should be careful.”\n\nBukhman started coding in 2001 while studying applied mathematics at his hometown’s university after a professor mentioned that there was money to be made writing shareware. Igor recruited his younger brother, Dmitri, who was still in high school, to start building games and screen savers. They worked on a Pentium 100-powered computer given to them by their grandfather. “We clearly didn’t have enough money to buy a computer ourselves,” he says. “When we started making money, one of our first purchases was another computer, which doubled our productivity.”\n\nThe brothers formally established Playrix in 2004 and started hiring developers and artists in their hometown. The company graduated from making simple puzzle games for home compu­ters to building Facebook-powered social games to compete with Zynga’s then popular Farmville before finally settling on free-to-play apps in 2009. Along the way they made several acquisitions of stand-alone game studios in Ukraine.\n\nPlayrix’s games, like puzzler Homescapes and city builder Township, are stalwarts on App Annie’s list of top downloads. Playrix’s games are free, but players pay an average of $5 a month in “microtransactions” of a few dollars each to unlock new levels or otherwise upgrade. The majority of Playrix’s $2.7 billion in revenue stems from players in America, but the games also do well in China.\n\nMicrotransactions helped the brothers bootstrap the business without taking any outside investment. They had long yearned to move away from their hometown, but the situation became urgent a decade ago, when Russian police appeared at their office with questions about their finances. Turns out they’d been sold land by someone who didn’t own it. “It’s not even about the money. I lost my belief in the system and the feeling that we could be safe,” Bukhman says.\n\nHe and Dmitri immigrated to Israel in 2016. The brothers then moved to London in 2020. Like several other Russia-born billionaires, they asked Forbes to be listed as Israeli rather than Russian for the Billionaires rankings. In instances where they had long since relocated, we agreed.\n\nPlayrix boomed during the pandemic, with revenue jumping 53% thanks to savvy marketing that hoovered up players stuck at home. It’s now the world’s fourth-largest mobile gaming company (by revenue) behind China’s Tencent, NetEase and Activision. The net worth of the Bukhman brothers, who together own 96% of the company, has more than doubled since 2020.\n\nBut years of rapid growth from the remove of Dublin were poor preparation for the current crisis. Young, lean tech companies don’t typically spend much time making geopolitical contingency plans. Still, some startups had quietly been planning for the worst. Among the best prepared were those with roots in conflict-ridden countries. Tel Aviv-based website builder Wix began moving key Ukrainian staff to Poland in January. As tensions mounted in February, it made the extraordinary offer to pay its entire 1,000 Ukrainian staff to move with their families temporarily to Turkey. When Russian troops invaded, a fleet of buses chartered by Wix swept the rest to relative safety in western Ukraine. Israeli freelance marketplace Fiverr, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, also had a plan in place by late January to evacuate Kyiv-based staff out of Ukraine or help those who stayed.\n\nMany Israeli startups have deep ties to Ukraine thanks to decades of Jewish emigration from the former Soviet Union, and their emergency plans were well rehearsed. “Let’s say we are used to having contingency plans,” says Marian Cohen, CEO of Israeli High-Tech Association, a lobby group.\n\nWhile few were as prepared as those businesses, some were quick to step up. Executives at Revolut denounced the war quickly and publicly, and the company sprang into action, helping evacuate staff and cutting off Russian accounts. By mid-March, it was waiving fees on transfers to Ukrainian bank accounts and lessened identity checks for new customers who might have fled without passports or other essential docu­ments. Snap suspended ad sales in Russia within a week of the invasion, helped evacuate 300 Kyiv-based staffers (who had largely built the AI technology that powers the apps’ selfie filters) and donated $15 million in aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe Bukhmans’ public position has evolved significantly since the start of the war. When Dmitri first addressed employees after the invasion on February 24, he declared Playrix “apolitical.” Four days later, as they announced the additional paychecks for their employees, the brothers in a public Facebook post declared the war a “great tragedy for everyone, including our company.” They called for it to end, making them some of the first Russian billionaires to speak out against the invasion, writing that “violence can never be the solution to a problem.”\n\nThat wasn’t enough for some Playrix employees, who blasted the statement as too little and too late. “For five days, Playrix didn’t even call what was happening a war,” says one Ukrainian employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I am very angry that the company does not want to call a spade a spade.”\n\nThough it was intended as a peacekeeping move, the purging of the Slack channels only escalated staff frustrations. For many Ukrainian employees, Slack was the only means of contact with colleagues in Russia and Ireland.\n\nA Playrix producer who has remained in his hometown, Kharkiv, despite constant Russian bombing, says he was “shaking with anger” as he watched the company delete posts from Ukrain­ian employees. He could understand why Playrix would want to limit testy political discussion, “but it’s one thing when it’s a political opinion, quite another when it’s a war,” says the producer, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions. He eventually quit Playrix in protest.\n\nOthers have signaled plans to follow. One longtime employee of Playrix who chose to stay in Ukraine through the war says she has decided to leave as soon as it’s over. “The company’s position became clear: ‘We’ll get you out of the country, but if anybody wants to stay and help or fight for their freedom, don’t expect any help.’”\n\nInternally, the founders have acknowledged feedback from employees that they should take a stronger public stance. “On social networks, [Dmitri] and I expressed our support for Ukraine in the words we could use,” Igor wrote to employees on March 4. “But we have 16 offi­ces and 1,500 employees in Russia. . . . We cannot take an open position now because we have a responsibility to our employees and families.”\n\nDraconian Russian laws now criminalize even describing the invasion as a war and threaten Russian citizens with treason charges if they provide “material help” to Ukraine. At the start of the conflict, these concerns weighed heavily. Playrix now seems more confident in its position. After initially discouraging employees from donating to Ukrainian causes and fretting internally about giving extra checks to staffers in the war zone, Playrix announced on March 11 that it would donate $500,000 to Ukrainian Red Cross, following in Revolut’s footsteps. One mass Slack channel has been reopened and the rules have been relaxed.\n\nThings remain far from perfect. Bukhman, who still has many longtime employees deep inside Russia, expects more workers to quit. His managers are even working to devise ways to minimize how much Ukrainians have to interact with Russian speakers, including Bukhman himself. It is not a recipe for harmony, but perhaps harmony is too much to ask for. “We won’t be able to continue working the way we worked before,” Bukhman says, “but I think we will be able to continue working in Ukraine.”\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesCargill Dodges Russian Missiles But Vows To Keep Feeding Both Sides Of The Ukraine WarForbesHow Bad Inflation Might Get, According To The Companies That Will Raise PricesForbesA Guide To The Private Jets And Helicopters Owned By Sanctioned Russian Billionaires"
