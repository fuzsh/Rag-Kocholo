Invited speaker at several International Conferences and Congress.\n\nEvgeniy Galimov, Ph.D., is a researcher and data scientist at Imperial College Health Partners. He earned his Ph.D. from Lomonosov Moscow State University, where he focused on mitochondrial ROS signaling and its regulation by p66shc and mitochondrial antioxidants. During his postdoctoral work at University College London, Dr. Galimov investigated the mechanisms of organismal death, particularly the roles of Ca2+ and ATP in this process.\n\nDr. Galimov also developed a model of C. elegans evolution and, for the first time, demonstrated that aging and death could indeed be adaptive for a species, determined by ecological conditions. This work was significant because the previous theoretical consensus held that aging could not be adaptive. Given that C. elegans is an established aging model, this finding could help reinterpret the existence of single mutations that dramatically extend C. elegans lifespan. Additionally, Dr. Galimov developed a deep-learning model capable of classifying lifespan in C. elegans and identifying morphological features that influence the prediction.\n\nCurrently, Dr. Galimov is engaged in Real World Evidence health data research focused on age-related pathologies.\n\nLorenzo Galluzzi is currently Assistant Professor of Cell Biology in Radiation Oncology with the Department of Radiation Oncology of the Weill Cornell Medical College (New York, NY, USA), Honorary Assistant Professor Adjunct with the Department of Dermatology of the Yale School of Medicine (New Haven, CT, USA), Honorary Associate Professor with the Faculty of Medicine of the Paris Descartes University (Paris, France), and Faculty Member with the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and Biotechnology of the University of Ferrara (Ferrara, Italy) and the Graduate School of Pharmacological Sciences of the University of Padova (Padova, Italy).\n\nPrior to joining Weill Cornell Medical College (2017), Lorenzo Galluzzi was a Junior Scientist of the Research Team âApoptosis, Cancer and Immunityâ at the Cordeliers Research Center (Paris, France; 2012-2016). Lorenzo Galluzzi did his post-doctoral training at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center (Villejuif, France; 2009-2011), after receiving his PhD from the Paris Sud University (Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France; 2005-2008). He is also Associate Director of the European Academy for Tumor Immunology (EATI), Co-chair of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Immunogenic Cell Death Working Group, and Founding Member of the European Research Institute for Integrated Cellular Pathology (ERI-ICP).\n\nLorenzo Galluzzi is best known for major experimental and conceptual contributions to the fields of cell death, autophagy, tumor metabolism and tumor immunology. In particular, he provided profound insights into the links between adaptive stress responses in cancer cells and the activation of a clinically relevant tumor-targeting immune response in the context of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Lorenzo Galluzzi has published more than 400 scientific articles in international peer-reviewed journals. According to a survey published by Lab Times, he is currently the 6th and the youngest of the 30 most-cited European cell biologists (relative to the period 2007â2013), and he was nominated Highly Cited Researcher by Clarivate Analytics (formerly, Thomson Reuter) in 2016 and 2018.\n\nDavid Gems is Professor of Biogerontology, and Research Director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing at University College London, UK. He received his undergraduate degree in Biochemistry from Sussex University, and a Ph.D. in Genetics from Glasgow University. After a postdoc at Imperial College London he obtained a fellowship to study the biology of ageing with Don Riddle at the University of Missouri-Columbia, USA. He then returned to the UK with a Royal Society University Research Fellowship to start his own lab at UCL in 1997. His work uses the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans to try to identify general principles that govern the development of diseases of ageing (or to put it another way: to understand the underlying causes of senescence).\n\nLeonard Pershing Guarente, Ph.D., MIT Novartis Professor of Biology, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA Leonard Guarente formerly studied gene regulation in eukaryotes (1980-1995). In these early studies, his lab first purified the TATA-binding protein TBP and cloned the gene, discovered UASs, identified the first heteromeric transcription factor (HAP2/3/4/5), and provided the first evidence for coactivators. He then turned his studies to the mechanism of aging and its regulation using yeast and subsequently higher organisms. His lab began studying aging in 1991 and showed SIR2 is a critical longevity gene in yeast and C. elegans His lab discovered the novel biochemical activity of the SIR2 gene product - NAD-dependent protein deacetylase. This activity suggested that SIR2 might link diet to aging, addressing the longstanding question of how calorie restriction (CR) slows aging. His lab established a system to study CR in yeast and showed that CR extended the life span in yeast mother cells by activating SIR2. More recently, his lab has made several findings regarding the mammalian ortholog of SIR2, SIRT1. Importantly, it controls several physiological processes impacted by CR. First, Sirt1 renders cells stress resistant by inhibiting pro-apoptotic transcription factors p53 and forkhead. Second, Sirt1 also regulates many metabolic functions influenced by diet, for example the mobilization of fat from white adipocytes upon food limitation, and the increase in muscle maintenance during CR. These findings show that the life and health extension by CR are not passive events, but result from the activation of Sirt1, which then impacts on cellular and organismal processes to deliver the benefits. More recently, his and other labs have linked SIRT1 to protection against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and osteoporosis in mouse models. Dr. Guarente received his B. S. from MIT and his Ph. D. at Harvard, under the supervision of Jon Beckwith. He trained as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard with Mark Ptashne and has been on the faculty of MIT since 1981, where he is the Novartis Professor of Biology. His book Ageless Quest (Cold Spring Harbor Press, 2003) describes the pathway of discovery of SIR2 as a key regulator of life span in response to diet.\n\nMichael N. Hall, PH.D., Professor of Biochemistry, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland\n\nMichael N. Hall received his Ph.D. from Harvard University and was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Francisco. He joined the Biozentrum of the University of Basel (Switzerland) in 1987 where he is currently Professor of Biochemistry. Dr. Hall is a world leader in the fields of TOR signaling and cell growth control. He discovered TOR (Target of Rapamycin) and subsequently elucidated its role as a central controller of cell growth. TOR is a conserved, nutrient-activated protein kinase. The discovery of TOR led to a fundamental change in how one thinks of cell growth. It is not a spontaneous process that just happens when building blocks (nutrients) are available, but rather a highly regulated, plastic process controlled by TOR-dependent signaling pathways. As a central controller of cell growth, TOR plays a key role in development and aging, and is implicated in disorders such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes.\n\nProfessor Philip Hanawalt, Ph.D., is Howard H. and Jessie T. Watkins University Professor in the biological sciences department and Professor of dermatology at Stanford University.\n\nHe is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, since 1989.

Dr. Horvath's research lies at the intersection of aging research, epidemiology, chronic diseases, epigenetics, genetics, and systems biology. He works on all aspects of biomarker development with a particular focus on genomic biomarkers of aging. He developed several epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation data. Salient features of this epigenetic clock include its high accuracy and its applicability to a broad spectrum of tissues and cell types. In epidemiological studies, Horvath co-authored the first articles demonstrating that epigenetic age predicts life-expectancy and is positively associated with obesity, HIV infection, Down syndrome, cognitive decline, Huntington's disease, early menopause, Werner syndrome. Using genome-wide association studies, his team identified the first genetic markers (SNPs) that exhibit genome-wide significant associations with epigenetic aging rates. Horvath developed widely used systems biologic approaches (notably weighted correlation network analysis, WGCNA) which lend themselves for integrating gene expression-, DNA methylation-, microRNA, genetic marker-, and complex phenotype data.\n\nStephen P. Jackson, Ph.D., Professor, Head of Cancer Research UK Laboratories The Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK\n\nSteve Jackson is well known for his pioneering work on cellular responses to DNA damage, particularly events regulated by DNA-damage-activated protein kinases. His group identified many key DNA-damage-response proteins and established how they interact with damaged DNA and with one another in regulated ways. Steve's research also helped us understand how such proteins impinge on telomere maintenance and on chromatin structure, and revealed that impairments in these responses cause genome instability, immune deficiency and cell-cycle progression defects. In 1997, Steve founded KuDOS Pharmaceuticals Ltd, to transfer knowledge of DNA repair to medical applications. KuDOS, acquired in 2006 by Astra Zeneca, is now conducting several Phase 1 and Phase 2 oncology trials and has other products in pre-clinical development. Steve's academic group maintains strong scientific links with KuDOS, but research in his lab remains independent of the company.\n\nHeinrich Jasper, PhD, Professor, Buck Institute for Age Research, Novato, CA, USA.

The Kapahi lab was the first to identify the role of target of rapamycin (TOR), a molecular pathway which is involved in nutrient sensing in all species ranging from plants to humans, in mediating lifespan extension by DR. Research in the Kapahi lab proposes that changes in mRNA translation downstream of the TOR pathway are key mediators of its lifespan effects. His laboratory is employing an interdisciplinary approach combining biochemical, genetic and genomic techniques, to understand how DR mediates changes in lifespan and metabolism using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cell culture systems. Due to the robustness of TOR and its strong conservation across species, identifying the molecular mechanisms that modulate lifespan upon DR holds great promise for finding potential targets for enhancing healthspan in humans. Work in the lab also has the broader significance to help uncover the role of nutrition and identify therapeutics for age-related human diseases like cancer, diabetes and neurodegeneration. Dr. Kapahi did his Ph.D. with Dr. Tom Kirkwood at the University of Manchester, UK and his postdoctoral studies with Dr. Michael Karin at University of California, San Diego and Dr. Seymour Benzer at California Institute of Technology. Dr. Kapahi is a recipient of the Ellison Medical foundation New Scholar award, Eureka award from the NIH and the Nathan Shock New Investigator Award from The American Geronotological Society.\n\nCynthia Kenyon, Ph.D., member of the National Academy of Sciencs, American Cancer Society Professor and Director of the Hillblom Center for the Biology of Aging\n\nCynthia Kenyon received her PhD from MIT in 1981, where, in Graham Walker's laboratory, she was the first to look for genes on the basis of their expression profiles, discovering that DNA damaging agents activate a battery of DNA repair genes in E. coli. She then did postdoctoral studies with Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, studying the development of C. elegans. Since 1986 she has been at the University of California, San Francisco, where she was the Herbert Boyer Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics and is now an American Cancer Society Professor. In 1993, Kenyon and colleagues' discovery that a single-gene mutation could double the lifespan of C. elegans sparked an intensive study of the molecular biology of aging. These findings have now led to the discovery that an evolutionarily conserved hormone signaling system controls aging in other organisms as well, including mammals. Dr. Kenyon has received many honors and awards for her findings. She is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Institute of Medicine and she is a past president of the Genetics Society of America. She is now the director of the Hillblom Center for the Biology of Aging at UCSF.\n\nArnold J.

He is interested in the biochemical and molecular basis of longevity ??? in particular the role played by mitochondria in lifespan regulation. Contrary to the widely reiterated Free Radical Theory of Aging, Ristow has repeatedly shown that the health-promoting effects associated with low caloric intake, physical exercise and other lifespan-extending interventions may be due to increased formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) within the mitochondria, causing a vaccination-like adaptive response that culminates in increased stress resistance and extended longevity, a process a. k. a. mitochondrial hormesis or mitohormesis. He works with the roundworm C. elegans and mammalian model organisms, as well as humans.\n\nDavid M. Sabatini, M.D., Ph.D. is Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well as a member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. He has been an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 2008 and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2016.

From 1992 to 1996, Manuel worked as postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of David Beach, at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (NY, USA). During this time, Manuel made his most important discovery with the cloning and characterization of p16, which defined a new class of cell cycle regulators and was soon recognized as a key tumor suppressor. In 1997, Manuel returned to Spain as an independent investigator, initially at the National Center of Biotechnology, and since 2003 at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center directed by Mariano Barbacid. The main contributions of Manuel during these years have been related to the concept of oncogene-induced senescence as a tumor suppression mechanism, the role of p19Arf as an oncogenic sensor, the generation of novel mouse models with increased cancer resistance, and the identification of senescent tumor cells within premalignant tumors. More recently, Manuel's laboratory has discovered a cis-regulatory element at the p16 and p19Arf locus, has dissected the role of DNA damage and oncogenic signaling in p53-mediated cancer protection, and has reported the anti-aging activity of the Arf/p53 module.\n\nGerald S. Shadel, Ph.D., Professor of Pathology Departments of Pathology & Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT\n\nGerald S. Shadel, Ph.D. is a Professor of Pathology at Yale University School of Medicine with a secondary appointment in the Department of Genetics. He has almost 25 years of experience studying mechanisms of gene regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and is currently regarded as a leader in the areas of mitochondrial gene expression, biogenesis, and signaling, a trajectory that began as a Damon-Runyon postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University. The research in his lab, first in the Department of Biochemistry at Emory University and currently at Yale University, has focused on factors and mechanisms that govern yeast and mammalian mitochondrial gene expression and mtDNA maintenance, the requisite signaling pathways involved in regulating these processes, and how associated defects are involved in human disease and aging. Upon moving to Yale (in 2004), in addition to carrying on basic studies in yeast (mostly involving TOR signaling pathway regulation of mitochondrial function and life span), cultured cell models (mechanistic studies of the mechanism of mtDNA expression/maintenance) and in vitro biochemical approaches (regulation of human mitochondrial transcription using recombinant systems), his lab has increasingly shifted to analysis of mouse models of human disease with a focus on those that have mitochondrial involvement, including cancer, Ataxia-Telangiectasia, and deafness. Finally, he was awarded the \"AMGEN Outstanding Investigator Award\" from the American Society for Investigative Pathology (ASIP) in 2007 and is a permanent member of the NIH study section on Cellular Mechanisms in Aging and Development (CMAD).\n\nVladimir P.

He is recognized for the purification and cloning of the cell-signalling molecules S6K1 and S6K2. Dr. Thomas's laboratory is focused on elucidating the role of these kinases in cell growth, and is responsible for the identification of the upstream regulatory components that control their activity, including the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex. Recently, the Thomas group has focused on the role that this pathway plays in the regulation of appetite and energy balance, the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and diabetes, and the pathogenesis of cancer-related syndromes such as type 1 neurofibromatosis. The Thomas laboratory has recently shown that S6K1 plays a critical role in a negative feedback loop to monitor insulin signaling, and is following up on this observation to study how the pathologies underlying cancer, obesity and diabetes are intimately linked through mTOR/S6K signaling.\n\nJonathan L. Tilly, Ph.D., Full Professor, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Harvard Medical School\n\nIn addition to his academic appointment at Harvard Medical School , Dr. Tilly is the Director of the Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital , Chief of the Division of Research in the MGH Vincent Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Service at Massachusetts General Hospital , and an Affiliated Faculty Member of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. Dr. Tilly is recognized for more than 20 years of work directed at elucidating the mechanisms responsible for normal (aging-associated) and premature ovarian failure. Much of his earlier studies focused on the genes and signaling pathways that activate or repress apoptosis in female germ cells (oocytes), and how prevention of oocyte death could be used to extend the functional lifespan of the ovaries into advanced ages. More recently, the Tilly laboratory has re-directed its efforts towards defining the contribution of rare oocyte-producing or oogonial stem cells (OSCs) to development, function and failure of adult mammalian ovaries. In addition to initially demonstrating the existence of oogonial stem cells in adult mouse ovaries in 2004, Dr. Tilly's laboratory has since purified OSCs, demonstrated the impact of aging on the function of these cells, and identified several agents that activate OSCs in vivo as a means to increase the size of the oocyte-containing follicle reserve as it becomes compromised by advancing age.\n\nJohn Tower, Ph.D., Associate Professor, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA John Tower received his PhD in 1988 from The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Biochemistry, Cellular, and Molecular Biology Training Program, where he worked under the direction of Dr. Barbara Sollner-Webb on the topic of rDNA transcriptional regulation.
