        "text": "Jetbrains is a company which offers a variety of IDEs and tools to developers for more than 20 years. These IDEs make development easier and faster at the expense of mobility and intelligence, but all this has a cost, Memory, CPU load, and indexing time. Because of this, many customers have switched to different code editors. (VsCode, Atom, Brackets, etc.).\n\nBack in November 2021, Jetbrains announced a new product called Fleet pronounced as /fliːt/. Fleet is clearly aimed at the “smaller” IDE segment currently dominated by Visual Studio Code and takes a very interesting approach.\n\nSeveral days ago Jetbrains announced the preview release of Fleet. And, as a loyal customer, I tried it and want to share my thoughts with you. Will it really replace VsCode or not?\n\nI’m gonna start with the cons.\n\nPricing\n\nOne of the main reasons VsCode is so popular is that it’s free, open-source, and has a rich plugin library. Fleet is also currently free but it appears it will be paid product. Personally, I was expecting it to be free for all and always. That is the first thing I didn't like. Let’s continue.\n\nExtra application\n\nThe second thing I wasn't expecting and didn't like was that you need to install the Jetbrains toolbox (Extra application) to install Fleet (But whyy??). Ok, let’s continue.\n\nIt’s not unique, or something new.\n\nWhen you try it you’ll see that it hasn’t decided what it tries to be. It’s like a merge of Jebtrains and VsCode. VsCode influences UI but it's neither Jebtrains nor VsCode. When you start to use Fleet in editor mode, it’s not more than Notepad++, TextPad, or just simple VsCode. It has very basic syntax highlighting for most popular languages, but, let’s say, it doesn’t have autocomplete that event Notepad++ has.\n\nMemory\n\nAlthough, Fleet should be lightweight, still takes too much memory. I have opened the same application in VsCode and Fleet (without smart mode) and there is a big contrast between them. Fleet uses almost 12X more memory than VsCode.\n\nLack of functionality\n\nTo put it simply, you are very limited in functionality. You can’t format code, and can’t use the “go to definition” functionality. I think it’s the very basic functionality of code editors and I’m very disappointed with it.\n\nThe lack of plugins and customization\n\nI wasn’t expecting, that the new product would be rich with plugins, themes, and other features. So I can’t count it as a minus of the product.\n\nSmart Mode\n\nPushing the smart mode (flash-like icon in the top right corner) button, an IntelliJ-Code-based engine will power up in the background, but it takes almost 3–4 seconds to start the IntelliJ instance, and indexing takes too much time. which is almost the same amount of time as for other Jetbrains IDEs. You’ll probably agree that several seconds of waiting for just code completion is not something we, developers want.\n\nAll this is not impressive at first look, but let’s move to an interesting approach and pros of Fleet.\n\nUI\n\nThe first thing I really liked is the minimalistic UI. I liked how minimalistic and easy it is to use. Not too cluttered with pointless buttons, texts, and menus. (But it took some time to find where the Terminal tab was). If you are familiar with VsCode then, it’s definitely something you'll like.\n\nSmart Mode\n\nAs I mentioned earlier just one click and a simple code editor starts using Intellij code-processing engine. This enables code completion, code refactoring, auto imports, and other heavy operations. Long story short, your editor will turn into IDE with just one click.\n\nGit\n\nFleet has built-in Git support. I really liked how easy it is to compare branches, see changes, work with branches, and commit or revert code. (And also supports docker out of the box.) Plus one point from me :).\n\nCollaboration\n\nWith Fleet, you can work on code together with your team, friend, or whoever you want. You can do much more than just share editor. You can share terminals and debugging sessions, perform code reviews and etc. (This feature is also built-in.)\n\nRemote machine\n\nI think the innovation in Fleet is a remote machine. You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful pc at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client. This approach allows you to leverage higher computing capacity and avoid running heavy tasks locally.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnd there is the question: “Will Fleet kills VsCode?”. The answer is NO absolutely No. (At least, not for now.) In my opinion, both have different uses and it makes it hard to compare. VsCode itself is older, more “experienced” and a leader in the code editor's “world”. It has much more options, plugins, themes, and community. Since it is open source, it makes it easier to contribute and create a bunch of plugins and features.\n\nBut I don't think that Jetbrains launched Fleet to kill VsCode or some other code editors, It’s something else. Overall, I think fleet has good potential to become maybe not “the one and only” code editor/IDE, but at least, one of the best. Jetbrains has 20+ years of experience developing IDEs and I believe everything is ahead. As time goes let’s hope it gets better and better.\n\nThanks for reading my article.
