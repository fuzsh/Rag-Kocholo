        "text": "I guess you don't have enough rights to see your current idea location. Try to issue command like\n\nls your-path-from-which-idea\n\ni.e.\n\nwhich idea | ls\n\nas root and you'll probably see contents of a folder above your current idea install folder. You can remove the folder via full path then as root (via sudo).\n\nTo remove the product completely, do the following:\n\nDelete the installation directory\n\nDelete the \"config\" and \"system\" configuration directories. These contain IntelliJ IDEA's caches, configuration and plugins.\n\nSee http://devnet.jetbrains.net/docs/DOC-181 for the OS specific locations of these two directories.\n\nThat should be all you need.\n\nWarning: Deleting directories is never a good idea. It can render some package managers broken or software in a extremely difficult to recover half-installed state!\n\nBest always to first uninstall the way you installed it. And after having successfully removed it the correct way, you can start deleting any left-over configuration files.\n\nSome likely ways to check for installations and how to remove (if the installation is ultimate edition):\n\nsnap\n\nsnap list | grep -i intellij\n\nsudo snap remove intellij-idea-ultimate\n\nflatpak\n\nflatpak list --app | grep -i intellij\n\nsudo flatpak uninstall com.jetbrains.IntelliJ-IDEA-Ultimate\n\napt\n\napt list --installed | grep -i intellij\n\nsudo apt purge intellij-idea-ultimate\n\nNot 100% sure if it's that, but I was able to find the location under the shortcut I had on desktop. It was XFCE and I right-clicked on the shortcut, went to \"properties\" and then \"launcher\". Under command there was a path that looks like installation directory for me (named idea-IC-191.7479.19)."
