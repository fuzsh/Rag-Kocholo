        "text": "IntelliJ IDEA runs code inspections to find and highlight syntax errors, dead code, possible bugs, bad coding style, and other problems. You can also run all the configured inspections for a specific project from the command line and store the results as an XML, JSON, or plain text file with a report.\n\nThe command-line inspector launches an instance of IntelliJ IDEA in the background where it runs the inspections. It will not work if another instance of IntelliJ IDEA is already running. In this case, you can use inspections in the running instance. Use the command-line inspector for automated regular code analysis of large projects with many contributors.\n\nOptions\n\nOption\n\nDescription\n\nInspection profiles\n\nAn inspection profile is an .xml file that specifies enabled inspections and their options.\n\nBy default, project inspection profiles are stored in the project directory: .idea/inspectionProfiles.\n\nGlobal IDE inspection profiles are stored in the IDE configuration directory under inspection.\n\nInspection results\n\nYou can open the generated XML file with inspection results in IntelliJ IDEA or any text editor as a regular file. However, it is more convenient to analyze it using the Offline View of the Problems tool window:\n\nView inspection results\n\nOpen the project for which you ran the inspection.\n\nIn the main menu, go to Code | Analyze Code | View Offline Inspection Results\n\nSelect the directory with the inspection results and click OK.\n\nLast modified: 11 February 2024"
