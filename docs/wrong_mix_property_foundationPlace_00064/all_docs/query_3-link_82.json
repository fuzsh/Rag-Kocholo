        "text": "News\n\nOver the last year there have been many rumors about death of Flash, just as rumors about its second life, inspired by Apache and new Adobe AIR features. Since the release of IntelliJ IDEA 11.1 we gather Usage Statistics, which helps us understand better your real needs and allocate resources correspondingly. The statistics of course does not represent the full worldwide picture, but it lets us analyse how IntelliJ IDEA is used for ActionScript and Flex development.\n\nThe good news, as it turns out, is that the number of active ActionScript and Flex developers has been growing constantly. As a proof, here’s a chart showing how many times Flash Run Configuration was started each month:\n\nHere are some more Flash-related statistics in case you’re interested.\n\nTarget platform:\n\nPure ActionScript vs Flex:\n\nMaven Flexmojos vs standard project setup:\n\nAs a conclusion we would like to say a huge thank you to all who agreed to send Anonymous Usage Statistics to JetBrains.\n\nIf you haven’t done this since you first started IntelliJ IDEA, please open Settings (Preferences on Mac), search for the Usage Statistics settings page and select the checkbox.\n\nDevelop with Pleasure!"
