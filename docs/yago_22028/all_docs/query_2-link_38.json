        "text": "Adolf Frederick (born May 14, 1710, Gottorp, Schleswig—died Feb. 12, 1771, Stockholm, Swed.) was the king of Sweden from 1751 to 1771. He was the son of Christian Augustus, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, and of Albertina Frederica of Baden-Durlach.\n\nWhile Adolf Frederick was bishop of Lübeck (1727–50), he administered Holstein-Kiel (1739–45) during the minority of Duke Charles Peter Ulrich (afterward Peter III of Russia). In 1743 he was elected heir to the throne of Sweden by the “Hat” faction. His election was secured by the Russian empress Elizabeth, who, as a result of Russia’s defeat of Sweden in the 1741–43 war, was able to demand that Adolf Frederick be named heir under threat of Russian annexation of Finland and the eastern part of Sweden. He thus succeeded to the throne after the death of Frederick I (1751).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
