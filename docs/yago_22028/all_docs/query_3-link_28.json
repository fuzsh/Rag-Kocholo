        "text": "Gustav, Prince of Wasa (1799-1877), was the only son of Swedish King Gustav IV Adolf, and crown prince of Sweden before his father abdicated following a coup d’etat in 1809. In otl prince Gustav was, as a pretender in exile, first engaged to Princess Marianne of the Netherlands, but this was broken off after Charles XIV John, the new Bernadotte King of Sweden, complained. He ended up marrying his cousin Louise of Baden, with whom he only had one surviving daughter, thus ending the male line of the Swedish branch of house Holstein-Gottorp.\n\nWho would Gustav have married if his father hadn’t been deposed, or even if his father was deposed but his son was allowed to succeed him (likely under a regency of otl Karl XIII)? His otl first engagement could’ve gone through due to Charles XIV not being in a position to complain, but he may have preferred another marriage if he’s either Crown Prince or even King of Sweden (and maybe Norway depending on how that whole situation develops).\n\nPerhaps he’d be a suitor of Princess Vilhelmine of Denmark like otl King Oscar I of Sweden was, but could such a pairing have come to pass? If so the Swedish Holstein-Gottorp line might end with him anyway as Vilhelmine likely was infertile. Who’d succeed him in the case of him not having children?\n\nWhat other potential brides might he have sought after? I’m interested to hear your thoughts.\n\nIt probably depends what is exact POD. If prince Gustav marries when his father is still king it very much depends what Gustav IV Adolf thinks being important match for Sweden. And of course speciality what kind of relationships Sweden has other nations. But I would guess that German princess seems most likely.. Or then someone from Denmark depending what kind of relationships Denmar(-Norway) and Sweden have.\n\nSomeone Russian grnad duchess seems really unlikely. Not sure would someone Habsburg or French princess (but not from Bonaparte family) be possible."
