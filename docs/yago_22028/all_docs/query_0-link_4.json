        "text": "Profession: King of Sweden\n\nBiography: Gustav IV Adolf was a King of Sweden who ruled from 1792 until his deposition in 1809 and was the last Swedish monarch over Finland. His reign ended following a military coup, resulting in the significant limitation of royal power and his family's exclusion from succession. After abdication, he lived in exile until his death.\n\nGustav IV Adolf was born in Stockholm as the son of King Gustav III of Sweden and Queen Sophia Magdalena. His early education was entrusted to a series of tutors, with Nils von Rosenstein having a significant influence on his liberal upbringing. At 13, he became king after his father's assassination, with his uncle Charles serving as regent.\n\nIn 1796, Gustav IV Adolf's trip to Saint Petersburg aimed at arranging his marriage with Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna was unsuccessful due to his refusal to allow her freedom of worship.\n\nWhen he came of age, ending the regency, he became increasingly involved in European anti-Jacobin politics, married Friederike Dorothea of Baden, and delayed his coronation to avoid calling a diet due to the country's financial troubles.\n\nDuring Gustav IV Adolf's reign, Sweden entered the Third Coalition against Napoleon, leading to costly military campaigns. After Russia's allyship with France, Russian forces occupied Finland, marking the start of Sweden's loss of the territory. The resulting poor political and military decisions by Gustav IV Adolf led to a coup d'Ã©tat and his eventual forced abdication. In exile, he lived a reclusive life under a pseudonym until his death.\n\nGustav IV Adolf married Frederica Dorothea Wilhelmina of Baden, and they had five children. His lineage included Crown Prince Gustav and Princess Sofia Wilhelmina, connecting him to the current Swedish royal house. After divorcing his wife, he had mistresses and an illegitimate son. His remains were eventually returned to Sweden for burial after a suggestion by King Oscar II.\n\nBorn: November 1, 1778\n\nBirthplace: Stockholm Palace, Sweden\n\nStar Sign: Scorpio"
