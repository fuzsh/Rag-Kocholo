After graduating Chaffey H.S., class of 62' he married his high school sweet heart Karen Halgren, and then went on to serve in the U.S. Army in Germany. Upon his return, worked for the phone company for the next forty plus years, working his way up from linesmen to project manager. Dale enjoyed volunteering his time serving youth, missionary, and genealogical research programs in the LDS church. His passions included backpacking, fishing, old Chevy pick-ups and John Deer Tractors. Life long Ontario resident, Dale passed away peacefully at his home, surrounded by family and friends. Dale is survived by his wife Karen of 50 years, sister Sue DuBois, 6 children; Robin, Tionna, Stephanie, Naomi, Nicole and Dale Nicholas, as well as 25 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren. He will be missed."
