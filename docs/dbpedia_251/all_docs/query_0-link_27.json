        "text": "Former consultant physician Selly Oak Hospital (b 1932; q Oxford 1960; FRCP), d 21 November 2001.\n\nSome will recall Thomas Low-Beer's love of interminable walks or his fascination with mud. Others will remember his chaotic ward rounds and clinics. Students will remember his clear teaching—even though today teaching through anecdotes is somewhat frowned upon. Tom moved to the United Kingdom via France a step ahead of the Nazis. He had a talent for languages and he also had that central European cultural passion that made him more than a mere observer of art. He took that eye for art into his clinical practice and saw patients and their maladies as he would paintings, to observe, understand, and treasure. After retirement he trained as a guide to the Barber Institute of Fine Arts in the University of Birmingham and he acquired and planted a wood. Two days before he died—following a car crash in South Africa—he had trekked for nine and a half hours climbing a mountain. He leaves a wife, Anne, and two sons."
