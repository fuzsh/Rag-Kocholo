        "text": "The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Project\n\nAMBASSADOR STEPHEN LOW\n\nInterviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy\n\nInitial interview date: December 5, 1997\n\nCopyright 2000 ADST\n\nQ: This is the third interview that Steve has done. Steve and I are old friends. We agreed that a more complete interview should be done since the first was done almost 10 years ago.\n\nLOW: The first was a videotape.\n\nQ: We tended to be rather short.\n\nLOW: It was an hour long.\n\nQ: So, we&#039;re going to do a full-blown interview now.\n\nLOW: Then there is another one we did on the background of FSI [Foreign Service Institute] and the creation of The National Foreign Affairs Training Center.\n\nQ: So, we&#039;re going to concentrate on your Foreign Service career. I&#039;m Charles Stuart Kennedy and this is being done on behalf of The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. Let&#039;s start at the beginning. Please tell me when and where you were born and something about your family.\n\nLOW: I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on December 2, 1927, the youngest of four children. My father&#039;s name had been Lowenberg. He dropped the “enberg” at the time of World War I. He was of German Jewish background. My mother, who was born in Milwaukee, came from the same background. I believe her great grandfather was one of seven brothers who came over after the 1848 revolutions in Europe. My paternal grandfather arrived at the age of three or four in about 1857 also following the upheavals of 1848 which had taken them to Milan, Italy where he was born, from Germany which they left in the previous century.\n\nQ: So you&#039;re part of the &#039;48ers. My family also came over then.\n\nLOW: Both sides were in business. My mother&#039;s family was in manufacturing in Milwaukee. My father worked for a small chemical manufacturing company that made soda ash which is a major component in both soap and glass manufacture. Procter and Gamble and Pittsburgh Plate Glass were the major users of the product.\n\nQ: That&#039;s why your family was in Cincinnati; Procter and Gamble and Pittsburgh Plate.\n\nLOW: For some reason I never became closely attached to the city.\n\nQ: Let&#039;s talk about elementary school.\n\nLOW: I went to a good private elementary school run by a friend of my parents, a legendary teacher by the name of Mrs. Lotspiech. After that I attended a public high school called Walnut Hills. My parents were firm believers in public education. Walnut Hills was excellent, and the leading college preparatory school in Cincinnati. It provided a good education with fine teachers. But I had always had minor health problems brought on by asthma, which I still have. My parents debated sending me to a military school but in the end decided on a school in Colorado\n\nQ: This was during high school.\n\nwas always music around our house. All of us children played instruments. We went to concerts. I sang in school, played the piano and clarinet, later a guitar and now the cello.\n\nQ: Was there sort of a German community there? Music is ofteassociated with that.\n\nLOW: Cincinnati is a major German town, and was known for its beer, symphony and opera. But it&#039;s also a southern city. There was no particular German community that I was aware of.\n\nQ: Where did you go in Colorado?\n\nLOW: I went to one of the two residential prep schools west of the Mississippi. At that time there were only two, one in Colorado Springs called the Fountain Valley School, and the other in California. It was an important experience for me. I think it was the first real intellectual challenge I had. Although we had good teachers at the public high, the ones in Colorado were even better. We had a good European history course, for instance, and good literature, music, and acting. I have always thought that a taste for acting is quite common among Foreign Service officers.\n\nQ: What was the composition of the school?\n\nLOW: At Fountain Valley, it was white, male. It hadn&#039;t yechanged. It&#039;s now a very different school.\n\nQ: Were you getting any more in history or that sort of thing athat point?\n\nLOW: Yes, I had good history classes at both Walnut Hills anFountain Valley.\n\nQ: Of course, you would have been getting out of school just aWorld War II was well underway.\n\nLOW: It was the class of 1945. I finished at Walnut Hills in 1944 and Fountain Valley in 1945. The war was just about over by that time, but there was still a draft.\n\nQ: Many of our interviewees found that their interest in foreign affairs came to them through reading the papers, geography... They found out where Wake Island was, Guadalcanal, Kiev, these battles that were raging. Were you still sort of Midwestern?\n\nLOW: No, we followed it very closely. I can remember the day and the moment the war was declared on September 3, 1939. My parents and I got lost driving from Cleveland to Cincinnati we were so absorbed in listening to the radio. And I had two brothers in the services. My oldest brother was a pilot stationed at Pearl Harbor Dec. 7. And my next brother was in the Navy. We followed it very closely. But I didn&#039;t translate that in those years into an interest in foreign affairs. That didn&#039;t come until much later.\n\nQ: You got out in 1945. The draft was still there.\n\nLOW: Yes, although I guess I was exempt as long as I was in college. I went right on to Yale, a few weeks after graduating from Fountain Valley. At that point, I became convinced that sooner or later I was going to get drafted and might as well get it over with. So I enlisted after a year and a half at Yale. I did a year and a half in the Army finishing as a “buck” sergeant in the Medical Corps. I was a recruiting sergeant figuring that the more people I recruited, the less likely I would have to stay in the Army - though I enjoyed the experience which was very good for me.\n\nQ: You were at Yale a year and a half. What were you taking?\n\nLOW: You don&#039;t specialize in those first years at all.\n\nQ: Did you have anything that was getting to you?\n\nrather small, but very pleasant man. I felt like I was about two feet tall. I walked down and he gave me some nice words of advice and I left.\n\nI went to the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) to ask them about their program. SAIS had recently opened a summer program in New Hampshire. It admitted me on the condition I go to the summer school. I had travel plans that year and didn&#039;t want to go to summer school. So, I applied to Fletcher, which admitted me without condition. I entered the following September.\n\nI had begun my own travels with a kind of a world plan in the back of my mind to travel first north, then south, then east, and then west. Without a very firm commitment to that plan, it actually worked out. The first summer after the Army, a couple of my friends and I bought a ambulance from the Army for $400. Goodyear provided us with six brand-new tires and we drove to Alaska, sold it there, and worked for the summer. I think I made more money that summer working for the Alaska Road Commission than I made at any time the rest of my life. They paid extraordinarily high wages. I drove dump trucks and built roads. But with the money that I earned there, I went to Colombia the next summer, deciding to spend the whole time there rather than travel around Latin America. I flew down, went up the Magdalena River on a sternwheeler and when I finally got to Bogota stayed in a “pension” run by four remarkable sisters. I put an ad in the paper advertising myself as a “professor de Ingles de Yale Universidad.” I had a number of private students and enjoyed Bogota although it was just a year after the great “Bogotasso” following the murder of the populist leader Gaitan and you could still hear firing in the hills. After a month or so there, I traveled around the country before returning to Yale.\n\nQ: Had you studied Spanish?\n\nLOW: Spanish was my language in high school.\n\nQ: As you were doing this, were you in any contact with the embassor consulates or anything like that?\n\nLOW: I don&#039;t think I even knew where the embassy was. I guess knew there was such a thing, but that&#039;s about it.\n\nThen I finished Yale and went to Fletcher taking another step in the gradual process of moving towards diplomacy. At first, I confess it was not a passionate attachment, at least not a conscious one, though a number of things had been pointing in that direction. At that point it was rather a faute de mieux kind of thing. No other direction interested me. I didn&#039;t want to go into business nor stay in Cincinnati. International relations interested me the most. Even after I entered the Foreign Service, I was not at all certain that this was the way I wanted to spend my life or that I was adequately equipped to do it. It wasn&#039;t really until five, six, seven years in the Foreign Service that I became completely convinced that, yes, indeed, this was something that I could do for the rest of my life.\n\nQ: At Fletcher, what were you taking? Could you describe Fletchein those days? We&#039;re talking about when?\n\nLOW: 1950-1951. Fletcher was going through a change at that point. It used to offer a one year master&#039;s program. During the course of the year I applied for a Fulbright to France, which, to my amazement, I was granted. So, I finished the first-year master&#039;s program and went to Sciences Po (the Institute d&#039;Etudes Politiques), part of the University of Paris. It was kind of a finishing year to my general education rather than a scholarly education. But I learned a lot particularly about the artistic world from the interesting American expatriate community living there. Towards the end of the year, I bought a motorcycle and traveled all over Europe and North Africa.\n\nI had taken the Foreign Service Exam in Paris and did not pass. So, I decided that I would continue my education. I was becoming increasingly interested in the substance of\n\nLOW: I think so. I think it produced a literature in particular which was different from that being produced in the United States; cosmopolitan, sensitive, joyous. It was no more valid than what was being produced at home, but it gave a breadth to American literature. This was, after all, where many of our later authors like James Baldwin came from. Some of my friends were southern writers. I think they contributed importantly to the development of American literature and art after the war.\n\nQ: What about the French students you knew? Did they seem to have different mindset or outlook?\n\nLOW: Oh, yes, very different. I remember taking a trip with a group of French student colleagues. I considered the trip leader, a faculty member, to be quiet, thoughtful, modest and considerate, as well as being very knowledgeable - a very impressive person. But mFrench colleagues, despised the man because he wasn&#039;t adequately assertive and authoritative; he didn&#039;t flash his brilliance or put them in their place when they challenged him. I found the American attitude towards scholarship and leadership completely different from that of the Europeans. Americans wanted leaders to be colleagues interested in a dialogue. The Europeans looked for academic authoritarianism. Much later in my life when I directed Johns Hopkins SAIS Bologna Center (1987-92), I found a similar difference. Faculty (and administration) were the enemy to many of the European students rather than guides helping the learning process and sharing their knowledge base and analytical tools.\n\nQ: Did you find it hard to craft your papers to reflect this?\n\nLOW: No, I have to say that I didn&#039;t write many papers. I was an “auditeur libre,” which meant that I was free to attend the classes I wanted. I wasn&#039;t inscribed in a degree course of study. My French was adequate to understand the lectures and participate in discussion, but it wouldn&#039;t have been good enough to master the voluminous reading assignments or write papers. I had learned French the summer before in a 10 week program at the School of Far Eastern Languages at Yale, which, I believe, was the first\n\nexperiment in the country in intensive language training. It was developed during the war to teach Far Eastern languages (Chinese and Japanese in particular), but had then spread to use the same methods to teach French. We learned an amazing amount in a short time, but it was a conversation program. We were able to do fairly well, but I wouldn&#039;t have been able to do a degree course. My Spanish was in about the same shape at that point.\n\nQ: When did the Philippines cross your mind? Were you lookinaround and thumbing through a catalogue or something?\n\nLOW: I guess I had long had an interest in the Far East. I hadn&#039;t been aware of it, but I know that one of the things that I considered while still at Yale was the Yale in China Program. I made some inquiries, but I wasn&#039;t ready to commit myself at that stage, and the program was very much up in the air with the Communist regime having just come to power.\n\nQ: By that time, Yale-in-China had pretty well disappeared.\n\nLOW: Right. I became interested in Indonesia. I wrote two or three papers at Fletcher about it, and learned about Indochina in France. I became aware that excellent things had been produced by the Dutch, French and British on Indonesia, Indochina, and Malaysia. But there was a void as far as the Philippines were concerned, in part because the library in Manila had been virtually destroyed during the war. There was very little documentation. But there was a great deal in Washington at the Library of Congress and Archives. I began to define a topic. After I finished my course work, I came to Washington and began to rummage through the two sources. It was startling to find thirty year old books which had been checked out once if at all. Some had never been moved from the shelves. Of course, in those days, you had stack privileges. You could just wander through the library. I had a desk in the Library of Congress Reading Room. I was in the process of getting married. Sue was also working on her Ph. thesis.\n\nQ: While you were doing all this, I take it the Foreign Service wanot a burning desire. It was a job.\n\nLOW: No, it was more than that. I had a growing interest in foreign affairs, the policy process and its impact, and I was fascinated by the prospect of becoming involved in it.\n\nQ: While you were in Washington, had you done some scouting around,talking to Foreign Service officers?\n\nLOW: No. I came to Washington specifically to work on my thesis. It seemed to me worth doing and I wanted to complete it before going on to anything else. I didn&#039;t think much about jobs and a career at that point, although the interest in the Foreign Service was certainly there. It was the only thing that I ever considered. You have to remember that jobs weren&#039;t as difficult to find at that moment in history. So I was taking things one step at a time.\n\nQ: So, your going for a doctorate was not tied to a future career in the academic world?\n\nLOW: No, not at all. It&#039;s hard to go back and figure out why I wanted so badly to finish the thesis. I was interested in the subject, and wanted to pursue it further, right to the end. I thought it wouldn&#039;t hurt to have this as a fallback. I think it was a matter of wanting to complete what I was doing before going on to something else. It is a feeling I have had about many things.\n\nQ: When you took the Foreign Service Exam, could you describe how iseemed to you, some of the questions, people, how it worked?\n\nLOW: In those days, the written exam lasted three and a half days. They asked about everything from agriculture to zoology in multiple choice questions each morning, then questions and answers each afternoon and on the fourth day, if I remember correctly. You get pretty good at taking exams. I kind of enjoyed it. Being graded on the curve, it was\n\nneither hard or easy. Not that you knew all the answers, but you knew that it depended on what you knew in comparison with what everybody else knew more than anything else. Most people had to prepare for it. You had to review everything you had studied. That&#039;s a very healthy process. I&#039;ve always felt that when reviewing subjects, you learn as much as you did the first time. So, I rather enjoyed the process.\n\nThe oral was a comfortable process of an hour or maybe an hour and a half interview here in Washington with six or seven examiners. It was rather relaxed. I remember very little of it, except that it was a friendly give and take. I don&#039;t remember any terribly difficult questions or any unpleasant encounters. At the end, they called me back and said, “Okay, you passed.”\n\nQ: Was Cromwell Richards the head of it at that time?\n\nLOW: I really don&#039;t remember. It was a fairly distinguished group of people. Joe Green was probably one of them. But beyond that, I don&#039;t remember.\n\nQ: While you were in Washington doing your Ph. and courting Suand getting married-\n\nLOW: We were married by then. We were married in 1954.\n\nQ: Were you a part of any Washington young group or something likthat?\n\nLOW: No, not at all. We had our hands full with our theses and work. We had a few friends. Some of them were also doing research at the Library; a Japanese-American and an Iranian. There were also some of our friends from Fletcher. But for the most part, we were pretty busy with our own activities.\n\nQ: You came into the Foreign Service on January 3, 1956. Could yocharacterize your Foreign Service class?\n\nLOW: I believe it was, all white male. I think there were a few women at that point, but not in that early class. There may have been in the second half of the class. There were 40 or 50. I never got to know that group as well.\n\nQ: What was your first job?\n\nLOW: Unbelievably, my first job was in INR [Intelligence anResearch] working on Philippine affairs.\n\nQ: You did that from when to when?\n\nLOW: It would have been March, 1956 to July 1957. I was immediately assigned to DRF, the Far East Division, as the Philippine and Malaysia analyst - while I was still finishing up my dissertation on the Philippines.\n\nQ: Was there any logic to this? Did somebody say, “Do you knoanything about the Philippines?”\n\nLOW: I think so. I think that there definitely was. INR looked at my background and said, “Good, we can use him.” It was a great assignment for me from whicI learned so much. You learn how reports from the field are used, and how they fit into the system in Washington. A lot of people have trouble understanding that even though the Secretary of State may not read your reports, they form views of the people who are writing the memos which go to the Secretary and can often be very influential. It gave me a great respect for the non-electronic analytical papers called “despatches” which don&#039;t exist anymore. They were read by the worker bees in not just the Department of State, but the Departments of Labor, Commerce, Defense, the CIA and elsewhere around the government. It was interesting; I was the analyst for both Malaysia and the Philippines and found the comparison of the reporting from the two places fascinating. We had the most superb reporting from Singapore and Malaysia because the U. was not the responsible government there. As observers, some of our officers were brilliant. I\n\nremember particularly a fellow by the name of Anderson who wrote the most thoughtful analyses. We really had a feel for what was happening in Malaysia. But we got very little good analysis from Manila because we were so involved with the government of the Philippines. It was quite clear that there were opinions all up and down the line in the embassy but nobody felt free to ruminate, speculate, or analyze. We had some detailed reports of the government in one state or another, but nothing that really gave the kind of insight that we had in Malaysia. So, it was a very interesting experience. I had a wonderful boss, Dick Stewart, responsible for Southeast Asia who really taught me how to write.\n\nQ: This is so important.\n\nLOW: He was patient but very demanding. I won&#039;t say that I became a brilliant writer, but he certainly pointed me in the right direction. One of the best parts of that job was that I got to know the desk officers in the Department. We were then in the old SA-1 building, the big, tall building overlooking the hole that they were punching in the ground to build new State. It was an interesting period.\n\nQ: I&#039;m not too familiar with the exact dates, but I would think that you would have two things going on in Malaysia and in the Philippines. This would be insurrections, the Huks and Magsaysay. Also in Malaysia, you were having the insurrection. This was after the Geneva Accords or whatever dealing with Indochina and the division. The Korean War had not been that long ago. I would have thought that there would have been a lot of “whither Southeast Asia” here.\n\nLOW: Interestingly, these were quite separate. There was no bringing together of Southeast Asia. There was no relationship between the insurrection in Malaysia and what was going on in the Philippines, nor with Indochina that I could see at that level. I did find that we would go into a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) meeting and there would be 40 people in the room. Not many of those 40 knew a lot about the Philippines. I was doing a great deal of the basic drafting of our Philippine analyses and writing some of the\n\nLOW: That was the period when Magsaysay was president of the Philippines. He was killed in an air crash. I remember going over to the desk and helping write letters of condolence. Though I was primarily involved in research analysis in both countries, I was able to get some idea of what the operational side of the Department was doing. It was an a very good first assignment.\n\nQ: With the Philippines, what was the feeling about, while Magsaysay was there, his leadership? After Magsaysay&#039;s death, what was the feeling?\n\nLOW: He was clearly our golden boy; a very impressive figure. He was an intelligent, non- corrupt, and strong leader who could have developed the Philippines and our relationship with it in a very positive way. So, it was a great tragedy. The old political class was still there and ready to take his place. Some were better than the others, but none had the vigor, leadership quality, or standard of values that Magsaysay had. So, it was a great blow.\n\nQ: You had studied the Philippines quite closely for your dissertation and then on the desk on the INR side. Did you see a problem of not having been there and not having that finger feel?\n\nLOW: Yes and no. There is no question that you would know the detail better, you would be able to analyze the day to day happenings better if you had experience on the ground. In the first place, I had the benefit of the reporting, which was not enormously analytical, but it gave you a lot of the factual background of what was happening. So, you weren&#039;t entirely without that. The expression “A little knowledge is a dangerous thing” is a fair expression, but I&#039;ve always felt that a little knowledge is better than no knowledge. Every little bit is helpful. I had somewhat more than I would have had otherwise, but it has to be put in context.\n\nQ: Did you have to deal with old Philippine hands there with the “little brown brothers,” which was the expression of our colonial time? Were they hanging around? I&#039;m thinking particularly of the Department of the Interior or the Army?\n\nLOW: I didn&#039;t. The two desk officers were first-class people who were good analysts with prior service in the Philippines which had given them an understanding of modern Philippine problems. I think they are the ones who had to deal with the old stereotypes. I didn&#039;t in INR. Nor did I have enough time on the desk to do so. The desk officers would not have given me responsibility for dealing with the Pentagon. The contact I had with the military through INR was with pretty sophisticated officers who were beyond those stereotypes. I did find it many years later in some of the old timers in the Philippines when I eventually got there, which wasn&#039;t until my last assignment in the Foreign Service 30 years later. But I was fascinated going to a conference in the Philippines with some of the old timers. They knew the country well and loved it. But they were the most extraordinarily patronizing people. I am speaking of foundation people and advisors in the mid-1980s. The State Department people, the young people who were running the thing, certainly were not burdened with that kind of attitude. They may have had to deal with it. I didn&#039;t.\n\nQ: From your perspective in INR, what about the role of the CIA?\n\nLOW: As an analyst, you really didn&#039;t have that much involvement. I can&#039;t throw any light on it. This was the operational side. I think quite properly, the analyst is kept out of it. You&#039;re trying to look at the broader picture, of what the major trends are, what the longer-term picture is. I think that we just weren&#039;t involved in the Agency&#039;s activities. I think we benefitted from that. So far as the analytical side of the Agency is concerned, my recollection is that they were pretty competent.\n\nQ: I was wondering about reports that came in."
