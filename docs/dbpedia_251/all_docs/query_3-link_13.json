        "text": "Since we began work at this historic church, we’ve been asking why it was dedicated to St. Stephen. How does he, as our patron saint, speak for this community for almost 200 years? I’ll call him Stephen from here on (except in image captions) to distinguish him from his churches mentioned in the text (St. Stephen’s).\n\nSome public material from the 1980s-90s for our St. Stephen’s claims this Episcopal church honored the Gothic cathedral in Vienna, mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese there with the same name.\n\nWhy? There are Gothic and Neo-Gothic churches that look more like ours (an architectural issue), that bear other names (an issue of message), within the Anglican Communion. Our consecration sermon applauded such Anglican churches as the ideals met in this new early American Neo-Gothic one. Where does Stephen fit in? The consecration sermon tells us nothing.\n\nSo what’s in a name? The many examples emphasize having to choose: Christian elements, geographic designations (like the 10th Street Episcopal Church), or today’s Ultra-Hipster possibilities (The Edge Church).\n\nNames, websites on church branding insist, should convey meaning, especially for the choice of a model human to signal who the community is and what it does—identity and mission.\n\nToday, we look for that message in Stephen in the first of two parts, this one focused on this church's first century. It’s timely. Reflecting on our given patron saint dives deep into the self-examination that religious institutions and St. Stephen’s, in particular, have undertaken over the last years. The pandemic has provided both a space and an urgent push to such re-evaluation. We’re in an accelerated process of Becoming, the very nature of Advent. To consider our community’s relationship to Stephen within this church season, which includes his feast day (December 26), seems uncannily right.\n\nWho Was Stephen?\n\nStephen was a star, a pivotal player in the formation of the Church, foregrounded in Luke’s account of that process in Acts (Acts 6-7). He was also the formidable voice that publicly presented, before the highest Jewish council (the Sanhedrin), the doctrinal foundation of the Church, an act of bearing witness that precipitated his death.\n\nTo judge by his Greek name, Stephen was a Hellenistic Jew in a diverse community dominated by Hebrew Jews. Scholars give his dates as 5 AD to 34 AD, meaning he was born after Christ’s death, and acted and died in his 20s. He was in Jerusalem as the number of followers of Christ’s teaching exploded to the point that the Twelve (Apostles) felt they could not preach, pray, and serve their community. When Hellenistic Jews complained that their needy widows were neglected in the group’s charitable services, the Twelve ordered them to choose seven among them to attend to this business, who must be “of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom [Acts 6: 3].” The first appointed was Stephen.\n\nThe youth not only met the Twelve’s requirements; he was extraordinarily multi-faceted. He was already full of the faith and power, performing miracles and wonders. He was open, committed, and admired for his character and wisdom. Unlike the humble Apostles, Stephen was highly educated, a top student of the top Jewish law professor, Gamaliel, a force on the Sanhedrin. Stephen’s judgment and trained intelligence masterfully engaged with the conceptual and the practical. He was a riveting, transformative preacher as well as effective administrator. He was also a peacemaker in his quarrelsome world.\n\nThe excellent Stephen inevitably posed a threat to some. He was brought before the Sanhedrin, falsely accused of blasphemy against Moses and God, and of announcing the destruction of Solomon’s Temple.\n\nIn a brilliant and forceful defense—its importance to Luke signaled by his making it the longest in Acts—Stephen refuted charges by arguing that his group followed Christ as the fulfillment of all prophecies since Abraham. The group also respected all covenants since Abraham as the assembled judges and their fathers failed to do. His group, he contended, posed no threat to the Temple since, according to the prophet they all purportedly heeded, God stated he was in no one or manmade place, only in those he himself made—everywhere. Stephen berated his judges for violating God’s word by insisting on a single sacred place and manmade building as God’s house (Solomon’s Temple). While arguing, the youth became radiant as he reported a vision of the risen Christ standing to the right of God in support of his defense. Unable to respond to his arguments and offended by his rebuke and sacrilegious vision during questioning, a furious contingent removed him and had him stoned to death outside a city gate. Stephen sacrificed diplomacy and his life to bear witness.\n\nAs he died, Stephen echoed Christ’s plea for forgiveness of his executioners.\n\nThis first Christian martyrdom after Christ’s opens a pivotal new chapter in Church history. Standing by Stephen’s clothing, as witness and reported supporter of the execution, was Saul of Tarsus, a fierce persecutor of Christ’s followers. Saul was another of Gamaliel’s gifted students whose subsequent conversion to Christianity with the name of Paul transformed him into one of the foremost Christian missionaries and martyrs. Perceiving Stephen’s death as escalated persecution, the Apostles scattered, spreading the Word and Church, fulfilling Christ’s command to bear witness throughout the world.\n\nStephen himself became an unusually wide-ranging model and symbol. His martyrdom was the first of the newborn Church, a cornerstone for an entity reinforced over centuries by acts of borne witness. As the leading inaugural deacon of the Church, he came to embody the earthly Church and its commitment to service within a diverse community. As a compelling orator, he became one of Christianity’s most brilliant evangelists and apologists. He prefigures the Church Fathers for his learned perspective on doctrine and Christianity’s deep history and future only a few years after Christ’s life and seminal impact.\n\nWhy did a 19th-century Episcopal Church Choose Stephen?\n\nWhat little we know comes from the bishop who ritually founded St. Stephen’s: the Bishop of Pennsylvania, The Right Rev. William White. His report of his year’s activities to the Diocesan Convention in 1823 tells us that, on May 30, 1822, he laid the cornerstone for a church in Philadelphia named after “the first martyr, St. Stephen.”\n\nHonoring the first martyr seems an easy way to link the New (an American Protestant church) to Christianity’s foundations through the familiar fatal act of bearing witness. Yet there are subtleties to consider.\n\nSt. Stephen’s was hardly the first American church; there were many from the colonial period, even Anglican churches just in Philadelphia that became Episcopal ones, like Christ Church. Nor was it the first “native” Episcopal church or even the first St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in the Diocese. That last honor apparently goes to a church in Wilkes-Barre, founded in 1817 as the town became a booming city, thanks to the revolutionary new fuel source found there, anthracite coal."
