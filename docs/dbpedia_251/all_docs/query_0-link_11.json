        "text": "American diplomat\n\nStephen Low (December 2, 1927, Cincinnati – November 15, 2010) was an American diplomat.[1] He was a graduate of Yale University and Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. He was a United States Ambassador to Zambia (1976–1979) and Nigeria (1979–1981) as well as Director of the Foreign Service Institute.[2]\n\nDiplomatic career\n\n[edit]\n\nStephen Low was a Foreign Service officer.[3]\n\nHe was a senior member of the National Security Council Staff from 1974 to 1976.[4]\n\nHe was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Zambia on August 5, 1976. He presented his credentials on August 31, 1976, and left the post on July 5, 1979.[2] While serving in Lusaka he played a key role in the negotiations seeking a solution to the conflict in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), working along with British diplomat Johnny Graham as the U.S. member of the Anglo-American Consultative Team for Rhodesia. Low's solid work in Zambia was an important component of the U.S. contribution to the international efforts to facilitate a settlement for Rhodesia, helping to bring about the Lancaster House Agreement in December 1979 which led to the formation of independent Zimbabwe.[5]\n\nHe was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Nigeria on September 20, 1979. He presented his credentials on November 29, 1979, and left the post on July 4, 1981.[2]\n\nHe was appointed Director of the Foreign Service Institute on May 4, 1982. His appointment was terminated on April 3, 1987.[2]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
