        "text": "Analysis Paralysis....ever heard of it? It's the need to have everything planned out to perfection before you take action. I have seen a number of Freight Agents fall victim to this over the year. The potential is there, they could make it...but they get in their own way trying to plan everything, research everything until they could recite every detail back in a court of law, then figure out the best strategy. And waiting so long to just pick up the phone or send the email. I am a planner...so I could very easily fall victim to this mentality myself. Sometimes it just feels comfortable to research and plan instead of doing. But, I have a plan for that. (Isn't is ironic, don't you think..)I put actual productivity goals in place for myself every single week so that I don't fall victim to just thinking about something and never getting off the starting block! If you have been a Freight Agent for 3 or 6 months and haven't moved a load, or if you haven't hit your goals for 3 or 6 months in any area..stop right now! Look at your productivity each day and decide to win. Change the narrative of planning for it and just do it. You may not know everything yet, but I guarantee that you will learn more by doing the action for just one day than you would have with a week of research! So, get after it! Mondays don't win themselves!\n\n27\n\n4 Comments\n\nNow that we are halfway through July, I wanted to look at where the dry van truckload spot market was at. Using data from DAT Freight & Analytics, I‚Äôve calculated the dry van spot market cycle indictor as broker buy contract rates less dry van TL spot rates divided by the average of the two series. One chart below. Thoughts: ‚Ä¢Historically, when this ratio falls below 10%, we tend to see a bull market pricing cycle begin, which is picked up well the Bureau of Labor Statistics primary service producer price index for general freight trucking, long-distance, truckload (https://lnkd.in/gUXXNHrd). Conversely, anytime we see the series move above 15%, we enter a bear market pricing cycle. Key dates for bull cycles labeled in black, bear cycles in red. These dates mirror swings in observed contract & spot rates picked up by BLS. ‚Ä¢The bad news for carriers is that July‚Äôs reading of 15.8% is well away from the 10% threshold. As such, there aren‚Äôt signs of the market being ready to turn. ‚Ä¢For the market to turn, we need more freight demand. Unfortunately, as I‚Äôve been noting frequently, demand conditions just aren‚Äôt great now. For example, Cass Shipments, which tracks the trucking ton-mile index quite closely, fell in June to the lowest level since the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic (https://lnkd.in/gAZb34hZ). As I‚Äôll share next week, machinery manufacturing and wholesaling is especially weak. Implication: I continue to see few signs that the dry van truckload sector will enter a bull market pricing cycle in 2024. It increasingly looks like any capacity tightening felt in June was just a return of seasonality. Continued weakness in pricing and freight demand reinforces my emphasis on why domestic manufacturing activity must be front and center in discussions about freight demand, with less attention given to retail sales. #supplychain #supplychainmanagement #freight #trucking #economics #markets\n\n274\n\n13 Comments\n\nXPO was one of the last LTL carriers to announce their 1Q24 earnings, and did so on May 3rd. This was arguably a case of saving the best for last. XPO did not disappoint, showing off the best margin improvement both year over year and sequentially. They did this while simultaneously showing decent growth figures, particularly on a sequential basis, which indicates XPO has some solid momentum going right now. Let‚Äôs go take a look: üî¥ Revenue was up a strong 9.0% over last year, with shipment counts up 3.8% and tonnage up 1.8%. üî¥ Rev/cwt excluding fuel was up an impressive 9.8%, with weight/shipment only down -1.9% and length of haul up 2.0%. üî¥ XPO‚Äôs 1Q24 OR was 85.7, a very nice improvement from their 89.6 OR in 1Q23. üî¥ On a sequential basis, revenue was up 2.9% with shipments rising 4.1% and and tonnage rising 6.1%. üî¥ XPO was one of the few carriers to improve their OR from 4Q23 to 1q24, going from 86.5 to 85.7 (Saia was the only other one to improve sequentially). üî¥ Their claims ratio has dropped to 0.3%, from 1.2% two years ago, driven by a more than 70% reduction in damage frequency. üî¥ Service has improved 8 consecutives quarters in a row. XPO believes they are on their way to becoming the best-in-class LTL service provider. üî¥ Of the 28 Yellow terminals purchased in Dec 2023, 6 were opened in April and 6 more will open in 2Q24. Another 12 will open later in 2024, and all 28 will be operational by early 2025. üî¥ XPO is showing obvious momentum, as shipment counts per day in 2024 are growing compared to last year, and the growth is showing signs of accelerating. While all of the momentum and positive news coming out of XPO cannot be solely attributed to Dave Bates, his joining of the company as COO in April 2023 is definitely having an impact. The margin improvements over the last 2 quarters are impressive. One would be hard-pressed to find another LTL carrier who has improved service, improved margins, and taken market share as well as XPO has of late. They sure seem to have the ‚ÄúMo‚Äù going right now. Check out the üöõLet's Talk Logistics üöõnewsletter where additional management commentary and insight regarding XPO‚Äôs recent quarter results and future plans will be expanded and expounded upon by the LTL Observers. You can check out other LTL carrier earnings news there as well. A link to the newsletter is in the comments.\n\n211\n\n4 Comments\n\nAs a highly experienced shipper for over 35 years who managed a $100 million transportation cost for a complex logistics operation, if you asked me if I would switch from OTR to IMDL now, my answer would be absolutely \"NO\" because it is not competitive. As a highly experienced Northeast Regional IMDL Operations manager, if you asked me if you should switch from OTR to IMDL, my answer would be that you should begin talks with your service provider way before the market changes to lock in rates before it does. When you have profound experiences working on both sides of the fence, you better understand the whys, the benefits, and the reasons because I have worked in both operational trenches, made those critical decisions, and moved those levers that saved $millions due to those real-life logistics experiences. It's that value-add that can not be bought but earned. RGTX Logistics is that partner who understands your business because we literally have been in your shoes. We are here to make sure your operations don't get side-railed.\n\n14\n\n2 Comments\n\nToday is my 6 year anniversary at TQL. A lot of things have changed since I started my freight brokering career in 2018. Here are some of the key things I have learned and adopted to guarantee success. 1. Transparency is key: No matter if you're talking to a customer, prospect, or carrier, transparency is the #1 thing that has helped get through stressful situations. Be upfront with your customers and carriers!! This is logistics, nothing ever goes perfectly as planned and the sooner you realize that the better off you will be. Freight is not always about being perfect, but how you handle situations when things do not go as planned. Hold yourself accountable! 2. Stress management: This career can be the most rewarding and fulfilling career out there but can also be very high stress. Learn how to deal with your stress in a positive way. I have seen people come and go in this industry because they could not deal with the stress without turning to vices. Go on a walk, read, hit the gym, pray, whatever you need to do to keep yourself sane. 3. Speed: In the world of logistics, timing is everything. Being able to troubleshoot issues quickly and efficiently will take you a long way as a broker. Ideally, when you talk to a customer about issues, you are coming to them with the problem AND the solution in hand. Easier said than done I know, but if you can get this down, your customers and carriers will appreciate it. 4. Don't lose sight of the big picture: I cannot tell you how many times I have seen brokers go for the big margins and wins every chance they get, with no vision of the long term. Yes, we are here to make money, but more importantly you are here to provide value for your customers. Think about where your relationship could be with your customers in 3-5 years and reverse engineer back to step 1. Would you rather make a few extra bucks right now and not work with a customer down the road? Or have that great customer 3 years from now and have more freight than ever because you spent more time building value than jacking up your rate? 5. Last, be a partner: This is a very cutthroat industry. You will constantly have other brokers and asset carriers coming after the same clients you have. How do you stand out? Be obsessed with your customers operations. I truly believe if you want to build the most amount of value, you need to know as much about your customers operations as if you were an employee there. If you just call and say, \"do you have anything going out this week?\" every time, you'll never be more than a quote and a truck and are easily replaceable. There is a ton more I can go into, but these 5 things have helped me the most in my career. Enjoy and happy hunting!\n\n121\n\n9 Comments\n\nSo one of the big stories of late is that FedEx Corporation is exploring opportunities to unlock shareholder value with their FedEx Freight division. Keep in mind that while FedEx Freight only represents 10% of FedEx Corp's total revenue, they are the #1 LTL carrier in the US, by far. Their $9B in revenue is well above ODFL at #2 with $6B. But while the corporate parent looks to unlock future shareholder value, the amount of value the FedEx Freight team has created over the last few years deserves a mention. Actually, a shout-out. There is a saying in the LTL industry that you cannot shrink your way to prosperity. To prosper, a carrier needs to grow. If you are not growing, you are dying. But let's take a look at FedEx Freight, using their recent 4Q24 (March-May 2024) compared to 4Q21 (March-May 2021) as a basis. Granted, COVID played a massive role here. But I think the story is what FedEx has done since COVID, and since the Yellow Corp closure: * Their daily shipment count is down -21%, from 117,312 to 93,080. * Their revenue however is up 3%. * Their OR has improved from 83.9 to 78.1. * Their operating Income has improved from $360M to $506M. Now that is some impressive value creation. And what is so fascinating, at least to me, is that FedEx Freight has done this by intentionally shrinking post-Covid. They are still closing terminals, while other LTLs are expanding their networks. Let's sit back and see how this story plays out for the rest of 2024.\n\n170\n\n16 Comments"
