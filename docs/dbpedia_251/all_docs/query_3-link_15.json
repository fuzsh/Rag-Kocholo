He has published reviews in Theater Journal and Canadian Theatre Review, and is slated to published articles in Modern Drama and Theater Research In Canada this year. His scholarly interests include musical theater, queer theory, sex and sexuality, gender, critical race studies, and gay culture. His doctoral research argues that an aesthetic of theatricality is the constitutive feature of gay culture in the twenty-first century."
