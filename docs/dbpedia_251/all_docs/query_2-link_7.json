        "text": "A male name. Greek Στεφανάς from στέφανος ‘crown', a common Greek personal name, borne by the first christian martyr. Stephanus, Stefanus is found in England only as a monk’s name before the Norman Conquest, but became a common christian name soon after. It occurs in Domesday Book. The surnames Stephen, Stephens, Steven, Stevens, Stephenson, Stevenson, Steveson, Steverson, Stinson, Stimson, Stimpson, Stenson, Steenson are derived from it. Stevyn was the usual Middle English form.\n\nStefanus Domesday Book 1086, Curia Regis Rolls 1196-1220. Stephanus Hundred Rolls 1273. Steuen Yorks Poll Tax of West Riding of Yorkshire 1379 1379. Steven Lincs 1450, Cocke Lorelle’s Bote c. 1515. Stevyn Lincs 1450, The Coventry Leet Book 1491, Promptorium Parvulorum 1440.\n\n— The Oxford Dictionary of Christian Names (1947) by E. G. Withycombe\n\nGreek Στέφανο, the first Stephanos (cf. German Stephan; French Stéphan, much more frequently Etienne) was probably ‘so called by an exulting family whose father had returned with the parsley as crown (στεφάνη, stephanë) upon his brow. For Stephanos was an old Greek name... before it came to that Hellenist deacon who first of all achieved the greatest of all the (Christian) victories, and won the crown,’ Yonge. Its use in England dates from ca. 1300: a use accelerated by its prevalence among kings, especially Stephen of England (1105-54) and Stephen the First of Hungary (977-1038), who, for his defeat of the pagan nobles and his admirable Kingship, was canonized. Moreover, there are sixteen other Saints, for the ‘Hellenist deacon’ was naturally one, being known to religious fame as ‘the First Christian Martyr’ (Benedictines).\n\n— Name This Child (1959) by Eric Partridge"
