        "text": "The Stephen Klein Wellness Center (SKWC) is a partnership between Project HOME, Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals, Inc., Jefferson Medical College Department of Family and Community Medicine, MPOWER, and Stephen Klein. It expands the health care services that Project HOME, with Jefferson Family Medicine, have been providing to formerly homeless and low-income people in North Philadelphia.\n\nNamed for its lead funder, a champion of this project for years, the SKWC will include primary care, behavioral health, dental care, a pharmacy, on-site legal counseling, and a Philadelphia Freedom Valley YMCA with babysitting services.\n\nThe project was made possible due to the leadership of Monica McCurdy, Project HOME’s Vice President of Healthcare Services as well as Jefferson physicians Lara C. Weinstein, MD, MPH, James D. Plumb, MD, MPH and Richard C. Wender, MD, chair, Department of Family and Community Medicine. Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals has shown its support with a one million dollar gift to the project. Part of our funding is made available by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) through a grant.\n\nWith a transformational leadership gift from Leigh and John Middleton, Project HOME created a public/private initiative to end and prevent chronic street homelessness in Philadelphia. MPOWER comprises visionary leaders who have joined with Leigh and John Middleton to ensure that together we realize this bold goal. This vital project is the third project of MPOWER.\n\nSince 2011, Project HOME and its community partners have created a new strategic and collaborative approach to provide housing, healthcare, education, and employment. Under Project HOME’s lead, MPOWER has identified the longest-term and most vulnerable people living on the streets and developed a comprehensive program of permanent housing (with services designed to break the cycle of homelessness) and also the necessary capacity to prevent chronic street homelessness in the future.\n\nIn addition, MPOWER will pilot evidence-based practices in drug- and alcohol-free housing coupled with employment, leading to greater economic independence for people struggling with addiction and chronic street homelessness. To prevent future homelessness, MPOWER will create new permanent supportive housing with strong education and employment opportunities targeted to youth aging out of foster care or who are experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe financial leverage and collaborative impact of the MPOWER allows Project HOME to greatly expand its housing and services, including building six new residential programs with a total of 500 additional housing units—doubling overall housing capacity—and a new wellness center offering integrated health care services including primary, behavioral health, and dental care, together with wellness programs. Not only does the MPOWER help Project HOME carry out its mission of ending homelessness, it generates economic and fiscal impacts throughout the City of Philadelphia and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\nOn a daily basis, we witness the tremendous strength and courage of men and women who have overcome homelessness. And daily, we experience what happens when a community with a shared vision comes together—what Jon Bon Jovi calls “The Power of We.” Together, we can seize this opportunity and make the ambitious hope of ending chronic street homelessness in Philadelphia a reality. We invite every sector of society to join us in this hope—and help make Philadelphia the first major city in our nation to end and prevent chronic street homelessness."
