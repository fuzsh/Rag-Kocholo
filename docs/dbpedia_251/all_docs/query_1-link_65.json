        "text": "She has delivered on these promises through the Future Ready Plan, an economic development approach that empowers our local workforce, supports small business, and unleashes the power of innovation. Under her leadership, Miami-Dade County released the globally renowned Sea Level Rise and Climate Action Strategies that push forward to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and 50% reduction by 2030.\n\nMayor Levine Cava has tackled the housing and affordability crises head on, increasing tenant protections and rapidly accelerating the supply of new affordable and workforce housing. She has made historic investments in housing solutions, including a new Office of Housing Advocacy, expanding programs to prevent over 26,000 households from losing their homes, and offering mortgage, utility, and condominium special assessment relief. Her stewardship of the countyâ€™s SMART Plan will expand five key transit corridors, connecting every corner of Miami-Dade with the most energy efficient and reliable public transportation options."
