        "text": "Just curious what your impressions are of the name Stephen nowadays. What would you think if you met a baby Stephen?\n\nThis name is currently #311, and has been on a downward slope since peaking at #19 in 1951. The name Steven has been the more popular variant in recent memory and is currently #200 after peaking at #10 from 1955-1960. The two combined would have landed at #6 in their heyday. I have read somewhere that Steven was the original Jaxon, which made me laugh, but also got me thinking about how nice the original Stephen is.\n\nA bit of background from wikipedia: Stephen or Steven is a common English first name. It is particularly significant to Christians, as it belonged to Saint Stephen (Greek Στέφανος Stéphanos), an early disciple and deacon who, according to the Book of Acts, was stoned to death; he is widely regarded as the first martyr (or \"protomartyr\") of the Christian Church.\n\nDoes this name need to wait for the \"100 Year Rule\" for a fresh start, or is it truly timeless?"
