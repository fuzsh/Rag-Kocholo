You receive a set amount of money from the government, a private source or a nonprofit organization to help with your university expenses, and you don’t have to pay it back as long as you follow the grant’s guidelines. However, if you withdraw from school before a semester is complete, you may be required to refund some or all of your grant money.",

You receive a set amount of money from the government, a private source or a nonprofit organization to help with your university expenses, and you don’t have to pay it back as long as you follow the grant’s guidelines. However, if you withdraw from school before a semester is complete, you may be required to refund some or all of your grant money.\n\nGrants can only pay for courses that are in a student’s degree program. Therefore, if you decide to take electives or courses that are not geared for your particular degree program, you will need to make arrangements to pay for those courses outside of grants. Learn more about the U.S. Department of Education's Title IV regulation and how it impacts your degree plan on the Plan of Study webpage.\n\nGrant eligibility\n\nGrants are need-based, and eligibility is determined by the FAFSA application. Some grants also require a minimum grade point average (GPA).\n\nHow to apply for a grant\n\nFilling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the first step to apply for grant assistance. Learn more about the FAFSA application requirements process and deadlines on the Applying for Aid webpage.\n\nThere are three categories of grants that you can automatically apply for when completing the FAFSA."
