In my tenure in retail I immediately fell in love with helping and supporting customers. I thought that is where my career would stay and I was so excited for my future. However, I was offered an opportunity as a Human Resources Manager and to pursue personal growth, I accepted it. After being in the position for a few months, I recognized the impact I could make if employees loved where they worked. The company would flourish, customers would be happy and managers could begin to look to the future. Win, Win, Win! What I wasn't prepared for was hearing that employees didn't have trust in their HR Leaders and although it wasn't entirely our fault, we are the only ones that can change it. On social media, in stores and other spaces you can hear how society feels about the HR Professionals in their life, you just have to listen. \"They can't be trusted!\" \"They are only here to terminate employees!\" \"My HR manager invited me to a Teams Meeting, I must be losing my job!\" and countless other statements that don't begin to encompass what we actually desire to do and many times deliver on. According to an article in the Harvard Business Review, \"The way most Human Resources Departments are running; it just isn't working for employees.\" Crucial Learning conducted a study in 2022 of 993 employees and found that 37% of employees believe that HR is more concerned with compliance to policies than concerned about them. They will go to their peer, trusted manager or just about anyone else before going to HR. If you are an HR Professional, this should motivate you to \"do something!\" Switch up your method, ask questions, show you care. Believe it or not you can care about the company you work for and it's goals and also care about the employees (work force, middle managers and your corporate officers). It is up to US to change this perception of who we are and what we are here for. We are their Advocate as a Coach, Advocate as a Mentor, and Advocate as a Mediator. Our number one priority shouldn't be to keep employees in line for the sake of the business, but to inspire, coach, and mentor employees to grow into their full potential! I recently sat with a few peers in the industry and a new HR professional asked, \"What can I do anyway, I'm only one person?\" I responded to her, \"said 100,000 HR Professionals!\" You see each of us DO make a difference and all together we can impact the culture of our employees and companies.\n\n2\n\nThe key difference between a leader and a boss lies in their approach to managing and inspiring their team: 1. **Approach to Authority:** - **Leader:** A leader earns respect and trust through their actions, integrity, and ability to inspire others. They lead by example and empower their team. - **Boss:** A boss often relies on their position of authority to command and control their team, expecting obedience and compliance. 2. **Focus:** - **Leader:** A leader focuses on the growth, development, and well-being of their team members. They aim to cultivate a positive environment and build a cohesive team. - **Boss:** A boss is primarily focused on achieving goals and meeting deadlines, sometimes at the expense of team morale and individual development. 3. **Communication:** - **Leader:** Leaders communicate openly, encourage feedback, and foster a collaborative atmosphere. They listen to their team's ideas and concerns. - **Boss:** Bosses often communicate in a top-down manner, giving instructions and expecting them to be followed without much discussion. 4. **Motivation:** - **Leader:** Leaders inspire and motivate their team through a shared vision and by recognizing and appreciating their contributions. - **Boss:** Bosses may motivate through fear, authority, or incentives, focusing more on results than on the journey to achieve them. 5. **Problem-Solving:** - **Leader:** Leaders involve their team in problem-solving, leveraging diverse perspectives to find the best solutions. - **Boss:** Bosses may dictate solutions and expect their team to implement them without input. 6. **Relationship with Team:** - **Leader:** Leaders build strong, trusting relationships with their team members, fostering loyalty and mutual respect. - **Boss:** Bosses maintain a more hierarchical and transactional relationship with their team, where respect is often one-sided. Overall, leaders tend to inspire and cultivate a sense of shared purpose, while bosses focus more on control and direction to achieve immediate results. As a leader I would ask myself everyday did I make a difference in someone’s life, what did I accomplish today. If I couldn’t answer that question I didn’t end my day.\n\n30\n\n2 Comments\n\nMaking the most of your investment. Run the play is something that has been driven into me for years. It has helped me to be successful for many years. District and regional managers have made visits to stores to ensure standards and the \"play\" was being run. But most district managers know very little about the middle management that will possibly be the future leaders of their company. Middle management is the backbone of most companies, and they do it all from the least to the greatest. I wish that when corporate visits were made, they would spend more time getting to know middle management and finding out from them what upper management is doing to develope and support them. Now that would make for some dynamic and enthusiastic up and coming leaders. Investing in people is better than checking a box to make sure that all the ducks are in a row.\n\n1\n\nTop 5 things I've learned in the past 4 months of being a Store Manager of two stores. 1. Listening is a much more important skill than speaking. Your team will respect you and appreciate any advice you give them much more if you first take the time to listen. 2. Assess who is on your team. This means figure out who they are as a person, the skills they possess, and where they want to end up. And to the last point, not everyone will want to be in management like you...and that's ok! 3. It's ok to let the team make small mistakes. Often, associates will learn best from making mistakes and come back much stronger than if you had just taken over in the moment. 4. Develop and foster a culture of team work and positivity. This part can be the biggest challenge of all for some leaders. Culture is a living and breathing thing and without giving it attention it can fall apart. Encourage team members to share best practices with each other and celebrate all wins. 5. Be creative. There are many complex issues you will face as a leader. Sometimes the answer is right in front of you, other times you will need to get very creative and outsource some ideas from your fellow leadership. It never hurts to collaborate.\n\n39\n\n3 Comments\n\nRed Flags Alert: 15 Warning Signs Your Retail Store is Struggling Are you worried that your retail store is losing its lustre?

Jenn was a ray of sunshine to all those who knew her. ☀️ Yesterday I was doing an interview for a different district team. During the interview it came out that this candidate many years ago was hired by Jenn. She shared how way back then as she applied for a seasonal sales associate Jenn made her feel so special. The candidate shared how Jenn as her leader said words like “I see something special in you” “you have so much potential” those words made a lasting impression on her. This candidate said how she thought of those words and how Jenn made her feel. Hoping Jenn would be proud as she is now years later interviewing for a Store Manager position. This was such a beautiful moment and I was so grateful that this candidate shared this with me. This moment has made me pause and reflect on how….every day we are leaving our legacy with those we lead and interact with. 💙 There is power in how we use our words. 💙 There is power in how we invest in people. 💙 There is power in being kind. 💙 There is also power in how clear we are as we coach people to reach their potential 💗We have a opportunity every day to make a difference in someone’s life. I know personally this was a reminder to not waste a single opportunity to smile and make someone’s day. #ginghamnation #oneteam #leader #leadership #empower #kindness #legacy #retail\n\n837\n\n32 Comments"
