        "text": "Born in Pleasanton, CA and still resides in the Bay Area in Danville. Piscotty attended Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton before playing collegiately at Stanford. Drafted in the supplemental round (36th overall) of the 2012 First-Year Player Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. Is one of many players with Bay Area / Northern California ties in camp this spring with San Francisco. Scott Alexander (Santa Rosa), Brandon Crawford (Mountain View), J.D. Davis (Elk Grove), Mitch Haniger (Mountain View), Joc Pederson (Palo Alto), Sam Long (Fair Oaks) and Logan Webb (Rocklin) are all on the Major League roster. The non-roster invites from the greater Bay Area are: Brett Cumberland (Turlock), Sam Delaplane (San Jose), Nick Duron (Salinas), Kyle Harrison (San Jose), Trevor Hildenberger (Mountain View), Joe Ross (Berkeley) and Drew Strotman (Sunnyvale).The pick that the Cardinals used to draft Piscotty in 2012 was the compensation pick they received when Albert Pujols signed with the Angels. Piscotty is one of four players in camp this spring that went to Stanford. Tristan Beck, Erik Miller and Austin Slater are the others. Piscotty was a junior in 2012 when Slater was a freshman. Graduated from Amador Valley High in Pleasanton where he was a four-year letterman in baseball and also played one year of varsity basketball. Piscotty was a team captain on the team as both a junior and senior. He was named the league’s MVP as a senior. Piscotty actually went to Stanford baseball games as a kid when his uncle would take him for his birthday. Spent three years on campus at Stanford from 2010-2012 where he was first-team All-Pac 10 in 2011and 2012 as a sophomore and junior. Piscotty started all 172 games during his career at Stanford and hit .340 with 132 career RBI. In 2011 he led the Cape Cod league in batting (.349.Went back and completed his Atmosphere and Energy Engineering degree at Stanford during the 2014offseason.In 21 career games at Oracle Park, Piscotty has slashed .325/.395/.623 (1.019 OPS) with four doubles, two triples, five homers and 17 RBI. Piscotty’s mother, Gretchen, was diagnosed with ALS in May of 2017. After the season, Piscotty requested and was granted a trade to Oakland so that he could be closer to his mother as she fought the disease. Gretchen passed in May of 2018 and in2019, Stephen and his father, Mike, founded the ALSCure Project in honor of Gretchen with the sole purpose of finding a cure for ALS. In 2020, the A’s designated sections 106, 107 and 108 the ALS Cure Project Foul Zone. The sale of cardboard cutouts in the section helped raise $76,000 for the foundation. Each time a fan bought a cutout in those sections, a photo was taken and then given for Piscotty for him to sign. He signed over 1,200 photos in total. If a foul ball was “caught” (hit your cutout), he’d also sign the ball before it was mailed to the fan. It was somewhat of a full-circle moment as Stephen and his younger brothers, who grew up A’s fans, would run around the Coliseum as kids chasing after foul balls. Their family had season tickets in Section 220 and they’d take the foul balls home they did get and put them in a case. Stephen’s younger brother, Austin, also ended up playing one season in the A’s Minor League system in 2018 after he was drafted out of St. Mary’s earlier that year. Piscotty and his wife, Carrie, have one child, Aiden, and make their offseason home in Danville.\n\n2022\n\nAppeared in 42 games for the A’s before eventually being released on Aug. 16...
