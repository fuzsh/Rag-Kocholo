        "text": "I am pretty uncompromising about modern design. For me, modern design is not the latest, wearying neophilia from the Milan Furniture Fair or Yodobashi Camera (Tokyo's barking mad high-voltage emporium of electronic devices, many of them satisfying needs you have not yet imagined: 'total multi-media life' they call it). Nor do I care much for the look-at-me silliness of a new generation of techno-organic designers who are more interested in creating problems than in solving them. Wanders, Boontje, Urquiola and the rest of them are welcome to splash around in their self-indulgence, just don't expect me to take much interest when there's still work to be done on the Modernist Project Phase One.\n\nModern design, at least as it revealed itself to me, is all about making the best of contemporary possibilities, of democratising beauty and maintaining a faith in the belief that better products and better environments are life-enhancing. Voltaire said it was the purpose of art to improve on nature. I'd say that it is the purpose of design to improve on industry. This seems uncontroversial, but tends to annoy even the most unlikely people. Long ago, my colleague Lynn Barber interviewed me (for another newspaper). She found it risible that I cared about the appearance of teapots, something which she construed to be arrogant and effete elitism. But really it's quite the opposite: my inspiration has always been that of the old Italian Communist Party - the best salami for everyone! Design is (at least meant to be) the ultimate in pop acceptability.\n\nWhat errant gene made me so obsessive in this belief that the visual quality of ordinary things is superabundantly important? The very first photograph of me does not show a swaddled baby with a cuddly toy, but a plump little thing sitting by the huge reflector headlamp of the Georges Roesch-designed 1936 Talbot 110 Speed Tourer which my father owned when I was born. One of its cylinders lacked a piston, resulting in badly compromised infant journeys, and my subsequent attitude to machinery (balanced between infatuation and loathing) may have been influenced by this half-recovered memory of flawed magnificence. Later, I saw a gorgeous, aerodynamic Lotus XI racing car on a trailer bound for the Aintree circuit. I was probably about six, and it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen: sensuous, simple, forward-looking, fresh and exciting. Soon I had a Corgi Toy model of the Lotus. Later, I learnt that it had been drawn by Frank Costin and engineered by Colin Chapman; the latter's motto 'Simplify and add lightness' still seems a useful metaphor for efficient behaviour.\n\nIt must have been an influence that my father worked in aerospace, although in those days we called it an aircraft factory. An indulged only child, I was taken on tours to the de Havilland compound at Hatfield, where they made the Comet. To me, the jet engines were not mere machines but diagrams of perfection. Again, long before I knew that Le Corbusier had said 'L'avion accuse!' (meaning, more or less, 'The aeroplane points the way'), I marvelled at the clarity and beauty of the Comet's elegant profile and clean surfaces, which offered a rebuke to the clutter of the world at ground level. At weekends I prowled the factory floor, and in my father's office - camel-hair coat on the stand, frosted-glass windows, the smell of hot oil in the air - there was an IBM Selectric 'golfball' typewriter which I was allowed to play with. Here was my first contact with a handsome, human-scale modern machine. Later, I discovered that this typewriter had been designed by Eliot Noyes, an architect trained by the Bauhaus's Walter Gropius when he was exiled to Harvard. Noyes turned a lump of office equipment, easily ignored, into a handsome object which dramatically lifted and enhanced any environment, like having a pulsating American dream on your desk. Then, for my 11th or 12th birthday, I was given a portable, plastic Olivetti Dora. I taught myself how to type and it came with me everywhere. So before I was 13 I had worked out the rules of good design from first principles: beautiful and useful!\n\nSeven years later, the designer of my Olivetti, the mercurial Ettore Sottsass junior, designed one of the most significant consumer products of its day. The bright-red Olivetti Valentine was a typewriter (developed from my Dora) intended as a fashion accessory for use in discos and bars rather than typing pools. In the way it broke barriers and altered perceptions, in the way it inspired demented cupidity, the Olivetti Valentine anticipated the iPod. Later, I donated my Dora to the Design Museum.\n\nIt helped that I was coming of age in Liverpool; what few modern buildings the city possessed stood out in bracing contrast to the decaying Victorian and Edwardian pomp, and the Viennese-style brick council estates which succeeded, in their urban impact, the parkland mansions of the great shipping families, mostly now fled. An example was Gerald Beech's 1961 Liverpool University Sports Pavilion in Allerton. I can recall it now as seen from the suburban dual-carriageway: across the green playing fields, geometrical, glassy, airy, fine - a simple composition that seemed a structure full of future hope and confidence, not one buttressed by the mawkish comforts of history and memory. A design of utter clarity.\n\nBut this was also the age of pop, so I learnt about graphics. Album sleeves before 1966 were mostly routine publicity photos of artistes beaming as if auditioning for toothpaste ads, but in 1966 The Beatles' Revolver, with its elaborate drawing by Klaus Voorman, demonstrated that there was a new medium to exploit. And exploit it people did: Martin Sharp's sleeve for Cream's Disraeli Gears added psychotropic colour to available resources. Then, in 1967 and 1968, Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton's Beatles' covers finally obscured any remaining distinction between 'high' and 'low' art.\n\nI cannot imagine how my name got on to the mailing list, but on the day it arrived in 1968, John McConnell's Biba catalogue came to school with me. It would be wrong to call it 'sensational', because it was muted, cool and understated. I had never seen anything quite so wonderful on paper.\n\nPenguin Books was a part of this, too. I read the design credits on the reverse of the paperbacks I bought so avidly every month and found names including Fletcher Forbes and Gill, Gerald Cinnamon and Germano Facetti. Penguin was a rare example of a modernist experiment that was unambiguously successful. Each title was a small masterpiece of modern design: elegant typography in a disciplined grid together with picture research which has forever influenced my perception of culture - and all for three shillings and sixpence.\n\nAn intense period of autodidacticism now taught me I was not alone. I read Nikolaus Pevsner, but I also read Tom Wolfe, the most eloquent apologist for popular culture. Of the Teen Fair drag strip at Burbank, Wolfe wrote: 'I don't have to dwell on the point that cars mean more to these kids than architecture did in Europe's great formal century, say, 1750 to 1850. They are freedom, style, sex, power, motion, colour - everything is right there.'\n\nWhen I came to London as a schoolboy, my first place of pilgrimage was the Chelsea Drug Store on the King's Road (now, dear me, a McDonald's). This was 1968 and the Drug Store's neighbour, film director Joe Losey, was condemning it as a source of 'rubbish, noise and hippies' - so this was absolutely splendid. A year later the Rolling Stones mentioned the Drug Store in 'You Can't Always Get What You Want'. And three years later, in a fug of uncontrolled substances, it closed, but a firm connection had been made in my mind between modern design and pleasure.\n\nBy the Seventies, after a spell at university, these diverse experiences were coming together; it would be too self-aggrandising to call it a 'theory', but it was a sequence of firmly connected convictions. My near-congenital fascination with objects could now be more positively interpreted as a nerdish expertise in the history and practice of modern design. I saw an early publicity shoot for the new hatchback Renault 5 on the Plaka in Athens in 1973 and resolved to have one... I soon did, but not before working my way through some splendidly eccentric Citroens.\n\nPoverty as a university teacher held me back as a consumer, while enhancing my appetite for affordable beauty. I coveted David Mellor's 'Chinese Ivory' cutlery and bought a set one piece at a time from Liberty. Then, increased prosperity extended my horizons. I found an example of Dieter Rams's 1956 Braun SK4 record player in a friend's house. This was the machine so austerely beautiful that the Germans called it 'Schneewittchenssarg' (Snow White's Coffin). Of course, now it is a technological antique, but it remains unsurpassed in industrial aesthetics, an astonishingly disciplined but exciting exercise in harmony and restraint. I could not say that a pilgrimage to see the east window of York Minster would have been more exalting.\n\nI never acquired a copy of Snow White's Coffin because I never much cared for music (and design is nothing if not practical), but I did now begin to assemble a small catalogue of personal goods which met the criteria of being beautiful and useful, and (to be honest) 'useful' also in the sense of establishing a place in the busy field of social competition. A Mont Blanc pen and a Rolex watch were acquired, I tell myself, not as status symbols but as examples of products which had reached a sort of timeless perfection. When these two items later became notorious yuppie totems, I toyed with the idea of hiding them in a drawer, but decided that would be pitiably precious.\n\nAnd then there was the rosewood and leather Eames chair, surely the ultimate de luxe relic of the Machine Age. First made for Billy Wilder in 1955, this gorgeous, overly complicated piece of furniture was a modern reinterpretation of the traditional leather club chair. No one has ever made anything more comfortable, nor, since its almost universal adoption by prosperous architects everywhere, anything so drenched in the symbolism of stylish wellbeing. So far as I am concerned, until someone discovers a new material, or there is a fundamental change in human physiology, there will never be a better chair.\n\nAnd here is the rub in this business of modern design. Designers think they can radically improve the status quo yet simultaneously believe they have found lasting solutions, invulnerable to the depredations of time and taste. In truth, the Eames chair I adore is an antique, so maybe I am more conservative than I thought. Still, I suppose one benefit of maturity is to appreciate that consistency is a puerile temptation. To confess, I don't own an Eames a chair. Certainly, it remains a potent symbol of modernism, but they work well in big New York spaces, not in narrow London houses.\n\nAn autobiography with objects has its absurdities. There are all sorts of nostrums about objects telling the truth, but often they tell lies. Daniel Boorstin heartbreakingly said: 'Nearly everything we do to enlarge our world, to make life more interesting, more varied, more exciting, more \"fabulous\", more promising, in the long run has an opposite effect.' So much of the modern world is redundant. I'm becoming more convinced by a paraphrase of Thoreau's belief that 'a man can count himself rich by what he does not want'. Or 'beware of any enterprise requiring new clothes'.\n\nDesign is sometimes described as problem solving; in fact, it's often just an ancient problem restated in a new form. Books and laptop apart, I own very few objects - in fact, only two worth reporting in recent years. I don't listen to music, but I still found an iPod irresistible as an object. I don't drive much, but I have a Smart Car. Each reminds me of why I found design interesting in the first place. Each is a visual and tactile pleasure; convenient too. The iPod and Smart Car offer an ingenious transformation of experience, enhancing the owner and the environment by their mere presence. An old designer once said a motorcar (or even an MP3 player, if he had known of such things) should be like a birthday present. And another added that getting into a car should be like going on holiday for a while. All this is true, but it's the stuff of dreams. Which was, perhaps, the point in the first place."
