        "text": "Stephen Dedalus, fictional character, the protagonist of James Joyce’s autobiographical novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and a central character in his novel Ulysses (1922). The name Stephen intentionally recalls St. Stephen, the first Christian martyr. Joyce gave his hero the surname Dedalus after the mythic craftsman Daedalus, who devised the Labyrinth for King Minos of Crete and who created wings of wax and feathers for himself and his son Icarus.\n\nIn A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, set in Dublin in the late 19th century, Dedalus rebels against what he sees as the pervasive repressive influence of the Roman Catholic Church and the parochial and provincial attitudes of his family and of Ireland itself. He leaves Ireland for France in order to fulfill the artistic promise inherent in his name.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Literary World (Characters Quiz)\n\nIn Ulysses Dedalus is once more a searcher, this time for meaning in his past and present life. He symbolizes Telemachus, the son of Ulysses (Odysseus)—here embodied in Leopold Bloom, the universal man.\n\nBloomsday map of Dublin featuring sites from James Joyce’s Ulysses"
