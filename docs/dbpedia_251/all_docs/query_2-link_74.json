        "text": "Stephen Stanley knows the struggle it takes to turn his heart over to a higher power. The Christian rocker's latest viral hit \"Whatever It Takes\" details just how far he's willing to go, even as he's plagued by self-doubt, slow progress and past transgressions.\n\n\"'Cause I've been reckless with my heart, no/ I'm falling apart, I don't wanna be the same/ I need you to be the change/ I surrender all I am, I know I've made mistakes/ But the past will wash away/ I'll do whatever it takes,\" he vows in his trademark throaty growl over tenacious power chords.\n\nIn this episode of Positive Vibes Only, the Capitol Christian Music Group signee delivers a powerful performance of his latest single, which begins in dreary grayscale before being injected with punchy splashes of color as he arrives at the song's triumphant bridge.\n\n\"Whatever It Takes\" is featured on Stanley's debut full-length Divided Frame of Mind, which also includes previously released fan favorites like \"Rest In The Father,\" \"The Heat\" and \"Note to Self\" featuring Riley Clemmons.\n\nOn the album, the singer isn't afraid to face his demons and dive into the realities of mental health struggles and internal anguish. As he explained in a press statement, \"Sometimes you have to go to that dark place to find the light.\"\n\nPress play on the video above to watch Stanley's moving performance of \"Whatever It Takes\" and check back to GRAMMY.com for more new episodes of Positive Vibes only.\n\nPositive Vibes Only: Cochren & Co.

But deep down, he believes that God will always have their backs, because \"there's somethin' about the name Jesus.\"\n\nIn this episode of Positive Vibes Only, Cole delivers a live performance of the song \"SBTN,\" which originally features Kirk Franklin and arrives on Cole's newest album, SORRY, I CHANGED, out April 26 via Provident Label Group. The project also sees appearances from fellow gospel singer DOE.\n\n\"I'ma give You Praise/ Your mercy follow me all of my days/ Always gon' love me, despite my ways,\" the Christian rapper sings. \"And I know that/ That I'm blessed/ And I'm highly favored/ Why would I worry?\"\n\n\"[This album] is not just music, but it's a movement of people that have been through it all, not perfect by any means,\" Cole said in an Instagram post. \"Through it all, you're still standing and molding into the person God is calling you to be.\"\n\nPress play on the video above to watch Aaron Cole's comforting performance of \"SBTN,\" and check back to GRAMMY.com every Monday for more new episodes of Positive Vibes Only.\n\nContemporary Christian trio Selah has found liberation from their anxieties thanks to the power of their newest song, \"Higher Name\" released on March 22.\n\nDespite grappling with sorrow, pain, and doubt, they have found a path that consistently offers them freedom and security. In this installment of Positive Vibes Only, Selah delivers a stripped-down performance of \"Higher Name,\" with Allan Hall playing the keyboard while Amy Perry and Todd Smith sing on the track.\n\n\"No higher name/ That's worthy of praise/ That can free us from our chains,\" Selah declares in the chorus. \"Author of faith/ Your kingdom reigns/ Jesus, The Name above all names/ You're the one that we proclaim/ The eternal God who saves.\"\n\nBeginning April 19, Selah will perform a string of live shows, including the Singing in the Sun Festival in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and appearances at the 40 Days and Nights of Gospel Music at the Ark Encounter in Williamstown, Kentucky.\n\nAccording to their artist biography, Hall says, \"From the beginning, our words have been comfort and encouragement, and I don't think that has ever changed as a part of our mission...
