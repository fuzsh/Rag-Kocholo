        "text": "Dr. Stephen DeMeo is a board-certified neonatologist who joined WakeMed Physician Practices – Neonatology in 2015. Originally from New Hampshire, he travelled to Pennsylvania for college and medical school. As a child, Dr. DeMeo was drawn to science and biology. Childhood interactions with his pediatrician helped pique his interest in the field of medicine, as well as his desire to help others and a personality that has always been very people-oriented.\n\nDr. DeMeo completed his fellowship at Duke University in neonatal-perinatal medicine, and his internship/residency at the Jefferson/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in pediatrics, where he served as chief resident. He earned his medical degree at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, a master’s degree in medical education at the University of New England, and his undergraduate degree at Muhlenberg College.\n\nIn addition to his work in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), Dr. DeMeo serves as the pediatric clerkship site director for the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine here at WakeMed. His clinical interests include neonatal intubation competency in trainees, curriculum development in intensive care, medical education research and the Institutional Review Board, and immunization in extremely low birth weight infants. Dr. DeMeo is board certified in pediatrics and board eligible in neonatal-perinatal medicine. He is also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics – Sections on Perinatal Pediatrics, Osteopathic Pediatricians and Medical Students; the American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians; the American Osteopathic Association; and the North Carolina Medical Society.\n\nWhen away from the hospital, Dr. DeMeo enjoys spending time with his wife and two daughters. New to North Carolina, they have fun exploring their hometown of Raleigh as well as the entire state. Trips to the N.C. coast have been especially memorable. Music is also very important to Dr. DeMeo. He plays the guitar and even spent eight years as part of a band while living in Philadelphia."
