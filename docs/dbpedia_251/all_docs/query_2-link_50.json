        "text": "St. Stephen I (born, Rome [Italy]—died August 2, 257; feast day August 2) was the pope from 254 to 257. He was a priest when consecrated, probably on May 12, 254, as the successor to St. Lucius I. Details of Stephen’s papacy are known principally through three reports contained in the letters of his rival, Bishop St. Cyprian of Carthage.\n\nStephen I restored the two Spanish bishops Martial of Mérida and Basilides of León-Astorga, whose colleagues accused them of having apostatized by sacrificing to pagan gods during the persecution of Christians under the Roman emperor Decius. The Spanish episcopate, however, did not accept Stephen’s restorations and appealed to the African bishops led by Cyprian, who cautioned the Spanish church against the bishops’ reinstatement. Concurrently, the Gallic bishops denounced Bishop Marcianus of Arles as a schismatic follower of antipope Novatian. Despite a letter from Cyprian endorsing the Gallic position and asking for a successor to the see of Arles, Stephen apparently refused to depose Marcianus.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 19 Things to Know About Christianity"
