        "text": "San Jose becomes the first city in California to choose to implement AB 1033, allowing homeowners to sell ADUs separately from their primary residences. Representative Phil Ting, a San Francisco Democrat who authored the bill, and San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan held a press conference on Friday, emphasizing that this is a new path to affordable housing. \"We all know that homeownership has become out of reach for many residents in San Jose and across California,\" Mahan said. \"We need to incorporate the innovation inherent in our region into housing policy to keep the American dream alive, and this new ordinance does just that. San Jose will continue to lead the way, but we can't solve this crisis alone, and I look forward to seeing other cities in California follow suit.\" ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful to the City of San Jose for seeing the impact my legislation could have on their community. ADU ownership can provide a pathway to buying a first home and can even help our seniors downsize,‚Äù said Ting. ‚ÄúWith this more affordable housing option, increased homeownership can help create stronger communities.‚Äù San Jose has built nearly 1,400 new ADUs in the past five years, with thousands more under construction. That number represents about 23% of San Jose‚Äôs new housing stock during that same period. Now, homeowners in San Jose can sell their ADUs individually, similar to how you would sell a condo. AB 1033 went into effect this year, but cities must take additional steps and opt-in to the law. ‚ÄúBeing able to sell my ADU was another reason to build my backyard addition, and it was one of the smartest things I‚Äôve ever done,‚Äù said Joyce Higashi, an ADU owner in San Jose. ‚ÄúNot only has it increased my property value, it‚Äôs generated more rental income than I ever expected.‚Äù The Casita Coalition, a statewide organization dedicated to removing barriers to building more affordable, sustainable housing, was a strong advocate for the legislation. They developed a model ordinance that San Jose used to draft the local legislation needed to take advantage of the new law. ‚ÄúWith homebuyers across the state facing an extreme shortage of new home inventory, we applaud Mayor Mahan and the City of San Jose for creating new possibilities for homeownership,‚Äù said Rafael Perez, Casita Coalition board chair.#SanJose #California #AB1033 #AccessoryDwellingUnits #HousingPolicy #AffordableHousing #HousingInnovation #PhilTing #MattMahan #HomeOwnership #CommunityBuilding #RealEstate #HousingReform #UrbanDevelopment\n\n1\n\nüçúAnybody up for some ramen? I am excited to share that I am back in the garage, building again (it‚Äôs actually a house in the Berkeley Hills). We are taking the wraps off of Supercog AI, a new startup focused on solving Application Integration using LLM powered agents. My co-founder in this new venture is a great friend of mine (and a former co-founder partner), Alex Osborne. Alex and I have worked around the application integration space for a long time, and we are unrealistically excited about applying the GenAI stack to this problem. Not many people relish the task to get some bits to move from system A to system B. But it‚Äôs a critical job to be done, and that‚Äôs led to a lot of brittle scripts, a myriad of inflexible ‚Äúno code‚Äù tools, and a lot of hand crafted SQL. But the power of the Large Language Model, trained on a huge corpus of information, offers a remarkable tool to solve this problem. The LLM you use today already knows the APIs of hundreds of popular systems. It knows the SQL dialects of every major database. It understands the semantics and data schemas of many popular SaaS systems. It understands much of the specific domain in which your business operates. I like to call the AI revolution ‚Äúthe last platform shift‚Äù. That may turn out to be hyperbole, but I definitely believe we are in the very early stages of seeing what this new stack can enable. I know we are hardly the first folks to claim that ‚Äúamazing stuff is coming!‚Äù. But this is why Alex and I have decided to focus on a real and hard problem. If we can prove that LLMs can power a new way to solve this problem, it will be the first successful *new* approach in 15 years.. We will have much more to share about this new platform soon. In the meantime, if you‚Äôre interested in getting a peek - or even better if you have application or data integration tasks that you would like some help with - please reach out because we want to help. #genai #startups #backinthegarage\n\n163\n\n37 Comments\n\nA data-driven approach to driving wound healing outcomes Marcella Gomez, University of California, Santa Cruz https://lnkd.in/gAkWZYJT Meet: https://lnkd.in/g4AAWkcK YouTube Stream: https://lnkd.in/gwtqaTmf Talk details: https://lnkd.in/gWn3B3cU Subscribe for talk announcements: https://lnkd.in/g5ciuNuX Abstract: Precision medicine requires an ability to predict the response of an individual to a prescribed treatment regimen a priori. Thus, advancement in the field is challenged by a lack of predictive models and, arguably, a lack of time-series information for a highly dynamic system. Here, we discuss work in wound healing, for accelerating wound closure. We argue that timing of treatments is as critical to consider as the choice of drug or therapy. Due to system size and complexity, data-driven methods need to be explored to develop multi-dimensional quantifiable indicators tracking systemic changes. In this work I discuss how bioelectronic devices enhanced with deep learning can help facilitate real-time sensing and actuation for automated decisions in treatment for wound healing and preliminary work in transcriptomic based classification of wound states. Bio: Marcella M. Gomez is an associate professor at UC Santa Cruz in the department of Applied Mathematics and Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for Baskin Engineering. She received her PhD from Caltech in 2015 and a B.S. from UC Berkeley in 2009; both degrees in Mechanical Engineering. Her research interests are in the broad field of bio-control leveraging methods in machine learning and control theory. Applications range from controlling single-cell response to driving complex systems such as wound healing. #modeling #simulation #medicine #healing #trauma #predictivemodeling #datascience #data #woundhealing #biology #bioengineering #systemanalysis #sensing #omics\n\n5\n\n<rant> Yesterday morning I wrote a post about the phrase \"scaling independently\" while waiting for my KIND cluster to spin up, and I promised that I would give an example of where you really DO want things to \"scale independently\" in a separate post. Well, that post is here. Let's talk about #apachekafka and its new Raft-based metadata solution, known as KRaft (yes, it evokes Mac-and-Cheese, which is partially why I like it so much). KRaft is a replacement for ZooKeeper's former role in Kafka. In a KRaft-based cluster, the Metadata Quorum is a group of Kafka Servers that have the \"controller\" role. The Metadata Quorum stores information such as \"what topics exist in my cluster?\" and \"which Broker is the leader for which Partition?\" and \"which follower replicas live on which Broker?\". This information is CRITICAL for the availability and consistency of a Kafka cluster. In order to ensure consistency of the Metadata Quorum, one specific Controller is chosen as the leader. All write requests go through that leader. In order to ensure availability of the Metadata Quorum, there can be \"follower\" Controllers in the Metadata Quorum which also store the metadata updates (synchronous replication). In case of failure of the leader, one of the followers can become the leader. In this specific case, it DOES make sense to scale the Brokers and Controllers independently. Why? First, the Controllers don't actually scale. One can be a leader at a time, so the others are just providing backup (note: for reasons beyond the scope of this post, it's best to have an odd number). Additionally, before KIP-853 is implemented, it's actually really hard to add or remove Controllers to/from the Metadata Quorum without downtime. Secondly, it's possible for a misbehaving client to take down a Broker, for example by sending way too much data to a specific partition. If it's just a single Broker that's lost, most of the cluster will continue on and live to fight another day. However, losing a Controller is a Very Bad Thing. Thus, by separating the Controllers from the Brokers, we can improve the availability of the cluster. It is indeed possible to run Kafka with some servers that share the responsibility of Controller and Broker. This is great for development (especially local dev) and also in *SOME* highly resource-constrained production environments. However, I would suggest as a rule of thumb that you should probably: - Separate out your Controllers on their own isolated machines - Start with a Metadata Quorum of size 3, which allows losing one Controller and continuing on alive - Put your Brokers on another set of nodes. Now, there's another good example of how Kafka scales X and Y independently: Compute and Storage. Watch out for the next \"Colt Rant\" about this, coming later this week! </rant> PS‚Äîhere's the link to the previous post: https://lnkd.in/gXU77rKW\n\n12\n\n6 Comments\n\nSome takeaways for a Jeff Hinton interview with timeless insights. My POV as an app builder is that models are now being improved for better UX (faster response/multi-modal) and reasoning capability and cost continues to improve. The technology headroom remains strong, and the integration of LLM into all software experience will continue and expansion of the reach (invasion) of software + intelligence will also continue. - Next word prediction is not merely parroting of training data. To do next word prediction well, LLM needs and already exhibits strong reasoning behavior. This would continue to scale / improve with more data / training. - LLM is a compression of human knowledge. The compression mechanism is identifying similar concepts across domains and reduces duplications among them. This can also be a source of \"creativity\" as LLM \"sees\" correlations of seemingly unrelated ideas through this compression. LLM can be more creative as it sees similiarity / correlations across all domains beyond (human) convetional wisdom. - LLM can exceed the quality of its training data. Jeff gave an example of an experiment where a model trained on 50% intentionally incorrectly labeled data, can still perform at 90+% accuracy after training. - Multi-modal models can improve the overall world understanding and lead to better overall reasoning. It does not even need to generate multi-modal output. - Not ML specific, but an interesting life insights. Bad intuition comes from believing (or wanting to believe) everything you are told. It diminishes the ability to make a clear choice that would lead to differentiated success (or failure).\n\n4\n\nüéØ about 8 years or so ago I wrote a document for the infra teams I was running with a few principles/guiding rules. üìà The point was for the team to know what I thought so that they could go faster and not have me as a blocker. 1Ô∏è‚É£ First one on the list was: Borrow, Buy, Build in that order. üëá The order presumes the same quality and the right cost/benefit. Whenever the provider infrastructure provides a set of primitives to achieve our intended results (including scalability, manageability, performance and resilience), we should use them (Borrow). If not, then we should look at what we can buy that can achieve the same thing (Buy) and only then should we think of building a solution (Build). üíØ I still advise anyone to use this order as a default.\n\n51\n\n4 Comments\n\nWe need to move past the idea that knowing everything is the best; asking good questions is a much more critical and underrated skill that we need to embrace. I‚Äôll demonstrate with a case study on how the exact problem to solve can dramatically shift based on answers to basic questions. But first, why does this matter? This is because good questions are the cornerstone to truly understanding the underlying requirements. So many issues would simply not exist if the right questions were asked at the right time - Many products with little to no adoption would not be built - Numerous designs would not be scrapped very late in the game - Countless incidents would be caught before they make it to production Let‚Äôs use my favorite leveling question shared previously https://lnkd.in/gxCHTWSu. \"Imagine you join our team/company X and discover that our SLAs (Service Level Agreements) are consistently in the red. What steps would you take to address this issue?\" Fundamental questions to ask: Q1: Are the customers actually unhappy? If there are no customer complaints, the problem may boil down to a simple SLA update. If there are complaints, changes to the system are likely necessary Q2: What specific SLAs are in red? How long is ‚Äúconsistent‚Äù? If multiple SLAs (latency, availability, consistency) have been red for 12 months, it's a deeper systemic problem. If a single SLA is red for 3 months, it‚Äôs a simpler problem. Q3: What is the SLA and what is the system performance? If the SLA and system performance don‚Äôt diverge that much, it can be solved with incremental steps. However, if the SLA is 99.99% and performance is 99%, then deeper issues must be addressed. To recap‚Ä¶ Asking the right questions at the right time can entirely transform the approach and solution, saving a lot of time, effort and grief. It is a critical skill for senior engineers. I‚Äôll leave you with this iconic clip from Margin Call‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúExplain, as you might to a young child. Or a golden retriever‚Äù ~~~ ‚úçÔ∏è Do you agree? Share if you have examples where the right question changed project‚Äôs direction. ‚ôªÔ∏è Repost if this is helpful.\n\n30\n\n2 Comments\n\nInteresting article from Bloomberg about life at Google's X in a time of layoffs and cost reduction at https://lnkd.in/gmw3GG7C. X is a component of Alphabet (Google's parent company) that incubates new ideas. They have been responsible for some great successes - getting Waymo and a lot of Google's AI work started - but they've also had projects that didn't survive - like Google's attempt to provide Internet access via weather balloons. When you work at a company that has hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues, it's hard to get a lot of interest in an entirely new business idea that brings in hundreds of millions. If you have a project that improves ads revenue by that amount, or decreases capital expenditures, you can do it, but if you want to, say, build wearable tech, it becomes hard to attract the attention of marketing or product. So, new ideas often die on the vine. For the most part, this is good and proper. Companies may have the financial wherewithal to branch out, but more often than not, they consider it a distraction. And they are probably right - it's hard to argue that Meta was right to divert such a huge chunk of their resources to chase after the metaverse. They've (rightfully) pulled back, and are more focused on their core business again. On the flip side, if you are in the tech sector, and you don't innovate, you are likely to get left behind at some point. So, you need to make and manage these investments somehow. When I joined Google, the CEO had a 70-20-10 rule - 70% of effort went to core businesses, 20% to broader efforts to improve Google, and 10% to stuff that's completely blue-sky. This is probably not completely right, but it is also probably not completely wrong. X is the division of Alphabet that is *specifically* designed to bring blue-sky products to life. Unsurprisingly, they've had to pivot and rethink their strategy many, many times. The article interviews a number of people who have worked at X over the years; it's well worth a perusal, for folks who are interested in the story.\n\n18\n\n2 Comments"
