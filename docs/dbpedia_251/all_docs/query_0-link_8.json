        "text": "In the highly competitive world of SAAS, it‚Äôs crucial to gain customer feedback and gauge interest as early as possible. The best way to do this is to talk to your customers before spending time and money on development. But it can be difficult to explain an innovative product without showing it. We recently empowered American Logistics (AL) to showcase their new design through rapid prototype development. What did it involve? 1. Quick Iterations: We were able to develop working prototypes within weeks, allowing for fast testing and refinement 2. Enhanced User Experience: By simplifying complex workflows, we made the system more intuitive and efficient 3. Live testing: With our efficient and quick development, the AL team were able to showcase and gain user feedback during tradeshows Rapid prototype development does more than just visualizing your product; it leads to a better understanding of product-market fit and allows you to more effectively use your time and funding. Learn more about how we drove digital success for American Logistics and how we can do the same for you! #prototype #uxdesign #SAAS\n\nRemote work enabled me to hire an expert team of UX designers and researchers dispersed across Canadian cities. It allowed me to support employee wellbeing so that precarious child care situations, creative passions and needs at home could be balanced with flexible work. We never missed a deadline; our work was always of a top quality. I could hire for the best talent and recruit from outside government. I couldn't offer the pay of private sector, but I could offer a healthy work environment and flexibility - something which many creatives (and folks in general) covet more than money. A slow creep to the end of remote work will make this impossible for many managers working in the federal government in IT. And equally, it will make it hard to retain managers and executives who are also subject matter experts in the field. It's really disappointing to see, and I hope there will be flexibility given so that we can retain the best talent in house. When you foster a work environment that is enticing to IT talent, you build real functional IT capacity within the government.

The top 5 questions show key stakeholder and user insights, plus app integration. The last 5 are follow-ups, guided design thinking, and long-term-strategizing. 1. How much of your analytics from the app do you want to remain digital? The company is still paper-driven. There's a reason for that, and phrasing the question this way shows that the digital format is the primary source of data, but not in a negative/dismissive tone since I do not know the reasons for not being primarily digital. 2. How do you want to receive electronic notifications of appointments from customers? A simple automated push to a digital calendar may not be the right choice for a paper-based business. Other options for notifications of scheduling appointments may need to be considered. 3. What is your clientele like? The stakeholder knows their demographic market and clients the best. This gives insight into what potential features may be needed based on existing users. Also gives insightful qualitative data on who is using the app. 4. Why are you wanting this app? The simple question is the most important. I like to lead with this question to get the stakeholder's mind thinking more in line with design thinking. 5. Has or is your company considering a move to a less paper-driving business model? This may not seem like a UX design question; I am pulling from my non-UX background in data entry experience. Design choices can be made early on that will ease the transition of paper data to digital data in the future, or if they stay paper-driven then design choices will need to be made to maintain relevance as technology changes. 6. Do you want to grow the app as your business grows? This is a good follow-up question to gain insight into what the stakeholder wants right now and later. Plus shows that you are open to future work with the client after the project. 7. How much administrative involvement do you want with the app? This circles back to the paper-driven model. It's important to know how hands-on or off the stakeholder wants to be in the business operations of the app. 8. Are there other features you would want in the app besides booking? This is a standard self-explanatory question to ask a stakeholder. It gives directions for the design. 9. Do you want the app to be a webpage, downloadable, or both? This is also a standard question to ask early in the design process. 10. How do you want this design to help enhance your brand image? This comes directly from my own psychology UX playbook. Framing an open-ended question like this helps shift the stakeholders more toward design thinking.

My journey in accessibility design has been enlightening. Here are some key takeaways from the course: - Designing for All: I learned that good accessibility isn‚Äôt just a legal requirement‚Äîit‚Äôs essential for reaching the full potential of any product. By considering accessibility, we include millions of people worldwide who live with disabilities. - Proactive Approach: I discovered that incorporating accessibility into the design and development process is crucial. It‚Äôs not just about code optimization; it‚Äôs about advocating for users with disabilities throughout the entire development lifecycle. - Optimizing Usability: I now know how to assess and optimize for common accessibility issues. Avoiding classic mistakes ensures a better user experience, benefiting everyone. - Effective Testing: I gained practical skills in conducting accessibility tests with users who have disabilities. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding and expertise. Aaccessibility matters. By embracing it, we create products that are meaningful and usable for everyone.

Unfortunately, I see the previously over-promoted notionary that Democratization of Design and the strange belief &/or attitude that Everyone is a Designer is Culprit Numero Uno. Design should be radically inclusive when it comes to participation in the process, contributions to the contextual knowledge needed for The Designers to do Our job and keep The Work accountable to The People ( users / customers / participants / primary target audience / other non-primary user types ) and to The Business ( strategy / objectives / economic sustainability and fiscal health / etcetera ). Divergent Phases allow for the most inclusionary Ways of Being for Design across Our Extended Design Teams. And then, whether you believe in Double Diamonds or not, there are those times that we do not like to discuss out loud all too often when Convergent Phase Ways of Being need to take precedent in Design, and that's when we need to put our Business Hats On tight, ...\n\n3\n\n9 Comments"
