        "text": "The historic The Club at Snoqualmie Ridge in Snoqualmie, Washington, will host the 19th Boeing Classic as PGA TOUR Champions resumes on Aug. 9.\n\nThis year's Boeing Classic features a strong field of competitors. Ernie Els, the current Charles Schwab Cup leader, has won three tournaments and achieved seven top-10 finishes this season. Jim Furyk, a three-time winner on PGA TOUR Champions is also participating. Fred Funk, with nine victories on this circuit, adds to the experienced lineup. Stuart Appleby, currently ranked 19th in the Schwab Cup standings, and Steven Alker, last season's Schwab Cup runner-up, round out the field.\n\nIn last year's Boeing Classic at The Club at Snoqualmie Ridge, Stephen Ames delivered a masterclass performance, clinching his fourth victory of the season with a tournament-record 19-under par. Ames dominated the field, shooting an exceptional 9-under 63 in the final round, which included two eagles, to set a new 54-hole course record of 197. His seven-stroke victory over defending champion Miguel Angel Jim√©nez was the largest margin in the tournament's history."
