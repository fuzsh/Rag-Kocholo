        "text": "96. Memorandum From Stephen Low of the National Security Council Staff to the President’s Deputy Assistant for National Security Affairs (Scowcroft)1\n\nSUBJECT\n\nPanama Canal Negotiators\n\nI’d like to call your attention to a personnel problem which I believe to be of some importance.\n\nThe Deputy Canal Negotiator is a Foreign Service Officer with the personnel rank of Minister by name of Morey Bell. His relations with the Pentagon have steadily deteriorated over the last two years and reached the place where DOD simply has no confidence in him and is deeply concerned over his influence with Bunker. There are many in Defense genuinely interested in obtaining a treaty who believe that the Negotiators (i.e., Bell) are not getting the point across to the Panamanians that there is no more slack in the lands and waters proposal and that if there is to be Defense support for a treaty, Panama will have to accept it more or less as it stands.\n\nThings reached such a point that Clements raised the issue with Ingersoll, requesting either that Bell be replaced, or that a second Deputy be named from the Defense Department.\n\nIt is my understanding that the matter has never been presented to Bunker but instead was referred to the Secretary, who may have some hesitation about appointing DOD people to positions of this kind based on considerations beyond the Panama issue.\n\nFrom my own experience, Defense has very strong grounds for its complaints in this case. I believe that without a better basis for trust as the negotiations proceed, we will not get Defense’s support for the treaty which ultimately emerges, and, as a result, seriously damage our chances of obtaining its approval in the Senate.\n\nRecommendation"
