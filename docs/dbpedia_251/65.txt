Stephen Center has served homeless and low-income individuals in Omaha since 1984. Established as a 501(c)(3) in December of 1983, the organization was founded by Sharon and Dick McNeil, who recognized a distinct need to assist those living in poverty in south Omaha. The name Stephen Center was chosen in honor of the Apostle Stephen, one of the first Deacons of the church and a man of faith who committed his time to giving food and charitable aid to the poor.

In partnership with the McNeil family, the St. Vincent de Paul Society of Omahaâ€™s Holy Ghost Church purchased a 103 year old building on Q Street for $10,000. It was a grass roots community effort that transformed the existing building into a shelter for homeless men in early 1984. From those humble beginnings in a rundown former pool hall and bar, Stephen Center has grown to include a multi-facility campus designed to support vulnerable men, women and children as they seek to overcome homelessness, addiction and poverty.
