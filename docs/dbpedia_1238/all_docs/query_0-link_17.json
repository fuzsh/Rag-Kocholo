        "text": "This article addresses the issue of historical knowledge in relation to material evidence. More specifically, it asks, What objects capture the historian’s attention and what knowledge is gained from those objects? What does the historian’s gaze select as “things of history” and thus as removed from a world of object assemblages and fluid matter? Is it the case that only artifacts deliberately produced or modified by humans (regardless of the purpose) count as “things of history”? Or do physical entities produced by unintended human and nonhuman factors also display temporal endurance or alteration occurring over time and resonate with humans? Are “things of history” only entities endowed with shape, or do formless materials qualify too? In this article, I outline a theory of intentionality in relation to material items for two main reasons. First, it allows for a “critique of material evidence,” which is still missing in the historical discipline. Second, it enables us to address any remaining epistemological, ethical, or political issues, biases, or contradictions associated with the multifaceted research on material culture that affect the way we do history.\n\nConfronted with Ferraris's philosophical theory, this chapter reflects on the historian's and epigraphist's relationship to 'documents.' Various examples demonstrate that Buckland's response to Ferraris on the theme of \"What is a document?\", in particular his tripartite division of documents, can be applied to the study of ancient history. However, far from being mutually exclusive, the three definitions-made as, made into, considered as-most often interfere in our use of documents, and indeed they did interfere at the time these objects were produced. And they also interfere in their 'second' life (afterlife) as searched for and studied objects. It is the scholar who 'makes the document' and not the other way round. For many relics of antiquity, the recognition of their status as documents is a recent fact. The most interesting thing for a historian is to ask a question, preferably a new one, and to try to identify a group of traces that can be used to answer it, in order to create documents that can be used scientifically for this purpose."
