SNYDER & CO., 44O FOURTH AVENUE, NEW YORK 1 6 COPYRIGHT 1946 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY PRINTED AND BOUND IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BY STANFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS TO %ATHRYN HARROD YWASON FOREWORD Danzig, one-time part of the domain of the Teutonic Knights and later nominal vassal of Poland, a powerful member of the Hanseatic League, a great seaport of Prussia, and after the first World War a Free City under the League of Nations, has always been a European danger spot. Few areas of its size in the world have had a more checkered history. Today it again faces an uncertain future, with its destiny to be decided at the peace table. Pole and Teuton once more will see their vital interests a pawn on the chessboard of world politics. Once more the Great Powers face the problem of giving Poland an access to the sea through a great German city. The Danzig dilemma is still unsettled, and a just and permanent solution will again tax the wisdom and the vision of the statesmen striving for a permanent and equitable peace. Dr. John Brown Mason has written an objective and scholarly account of Danzig, with particular emphasis upon the political and economic problems presented at the Paris Peace Conference and the administrative problems which arose while Danzig was under the protection of the League of Nations. Pie has not only documented his study carefully from all available printed sources but has spent considerable time in Danzig investigating the problem at first hand. The result of his labors is an impartial, exhaustive presentation of the Danzig problem as it will be presented to the Peace Conference con- cluding World War II. Certain areas, such as Danzig, Tangier, and Shanghai, seem to require some kind of international administration. The experiences of the past should assist the political planners of the future to avoid some of the mistakes of their predecessors. This excellent presenta- tion of The Danzig Dilemma by Dr. Mason is a timely contribution to the study of the problem of international administration. Graham H. Stuart Stanford University, California December 1, 1945 Danzig^ September 20, 1939 Albert Forster Gauleiter of Danzig To Herr Reich Leader Philipp Bouhler Berlin Dear Fellow Party Member Bouhler: On the occasion of Danzig’s reunion with the German Reich, and at my request, the Fiihrer yesterday awarded the Golden Party Badge of Honor to the Fellow Party Members mentioned on the enclosed list. The Fiihrer signed the original list, which is in my possession. I should be grateful to you if you would have the words “Sep- tember 19, 1939” engraved on these fifteen insignia of honor. When I come to Berlin in the near future I shall call for the insignia and take them back to Danzig. The entrance of the Fiihrer into Danzig was a fantastic event. He was enraptured by the beauty of Danzig. He also liked our new party headquarters very well. All of us are happy to have had the Fiihrer with us. With best regards, in old friendship, and Heil Hitler ! Your Albert Forster [Translation of the Frontispiece letter] PREFACE The writer is deeply indebted to various friends and colleagues as well as to institutions and endowments for invaluable aid in the preparation of this study. Parts of the manuscript were read by Professor Pitman B. Potter, of American University, managing editor of the American Journal of International Law (chaps i, iv-vi, xiv, xvii) ; and parts by Miss Nina Almond, librarian (chap iii), Professor PL H. Fisher, direc- tor, (chaps, i-iii), and Dean Ralph H. Lutz, former director (chap, iii) of the Hoover Library on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stan- ford University; and parts by Mr. Robert B. Schwenger, of Kensing- ton, Maryland The entire manuscript was read by Dr. Ewart Lewis of Oberlin, Ohio, by Professor John D. Lewis of Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio, and by Mr. Andrew B. Foster of Chevy Chase, Maryland. While the manuscript has greatly benefited by their many suggestions, the author, of course, is responsible for all statements of facts or of opinion A special word of appreciation is due to Professor Graham H. Stuart, of Stanford University, editor of Stanford Books on World Politics, who encouraged the writing of this study and who proved very helpful throughout its progress. Thanks are also due to Professor Wm Hawdey Davis, editor of the Stanford University Press, and his staff for their interest and able assistance, and to Mr. Stanley P. King of the Food Research Institute, Stanford University, for the preparation of the map. The writer is grateful also to Mrs John W. Guerard of Fresno, Cali- fornia, for stylistic and grammatical improvements in the text. A grant-in-aid from the Social Science Research Council made possible the completion of this study, which originated while the writer held a Carnegie Fellowship in International Law permitting research in Geneva, Berlin, Danzig, Warsaw, and Lwow (Lemberg). The publication of this volume has been aided by the American Council of Learned Societies from a fund provided by the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Sincere appreciation is hereby expressed to these institutions for their interest and assistance. Acknowledgments are also due for permission to use the valuable collections of the Hoover Library on War, Revolution, and Peace at xt xii THE DANZIG DILEMMA Stanford University, where most of the writing was done; and to the libraries at Stanford University, the University of Cali- fornia (Berkeley), the University of Chicago, the University of Wisconsin, and Fresno State College, and for the helpful assistance of the staffs of these libraries. In foreign countries, research materials were made available at the Library of the League of Nations at Geneva, at the Preussische Staatsbibliothek, the Universitatsbibliothek, and the Institut fur auslandisches offentliches Recht und Yolkerrecht in Berlin, at the Stadtbibliothek and the Staatsarchiv in Danzig, and at the Library of the Jan Kasimir University in Lwow. Among foreign scholars, government officials, and publicists too numerous to enumerate, special thanks are due to a number of men in Geneva, Danzig, Germany, and Poland who were very helpful in the earlier stages of this study. Their wide knowledge, their divergent vieAvs, and their frequently deep feelings on the subject of the Free City of Danzig provided a challenge to the writer. He has attempted to furnish a description and analysis of the complicated international problems brought into relief by the word “Danzig’’ that may be acceptable as a factual, objective basis for further study, reflection, and future peace planning, even if all readers may not agree with the opinions and conclusions here expressed. It is also hoped that the experience of the Free City will be found of value in solving similar problems, such as that of Trieste. John Brown Mason Washington, D.C. October 15, 1945 ADDENDA The frontispiece to this book is a reproduction of the letter of Albert Forster, Gauleiter of the Danzig district of the Nazi Party and Hitler's trusted lieutenant in the Free City, more powerful than its government. Reich Leader Bouhler, to whom the letter was writ- ten, was one of nineteen Reich Leaders, highest officials of the Nazi Party. The stamp in the lower left-hand corner of the letter indicates that Forster’s letter was received in the Chancellory of the Fuhrer, where the author of this book found it in the summer of 1945. The marginal note, which was in red pencil, directs the preparation of these special insigTiia. After this manuscript had been set in pages the author was able to secure in Germany a copy of Georg Crusen's detailed study Der Pariser V erirag voni 9. November 1920 xTccording to a conversa- tion with Dr. Crusen, retired former Chief Justice of the Free City, his book w^as printed in 1936 but was suppressed immediately on the pretext that it w^ould give valuable information to the Polish gov- ernment. Of the 500 copies printed, some ten or twelve were al- lowed to be distributed among high Danzig officials and “trusted” German professors of international law. The others were impounded by the German ( Foreign Office. Their fate is unknown Dr. Crusen himself had only one copy which the writer has deposited in the Hoover Library for War, Revolution, and Peace. References to Crusen’ s study have been added wherever it was possible to do so without remaking pages, though lack of space makes it necessary to cite only author and pages, without repeating the title.

The brave and tenacious Polish stand on that outpost of the Cor- ridor was characteristic of the intensity of the struggle between Teuton and Pole over Danzig and the neighboring region where they had long faced and fought each other. Although Hitler used the separation of Danzig from Germany and the existence of the Cor- ridor as an excuse for launching his attack on Poland,^ the real causes of the conflict w^ent deeper and were buried in past centuries. The Free City of Danzig, established in 1920 under the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, was but the most recent of many attempts to simplify, if not to solve, the long-standing problems*^ resulting from the overlapping Lebensramn of two expanding nations in a geographically and economically strategic area. ^ Friedrich Heiss (ed), Dandg im Reich (Berlin, 1939), p 42. - Ibid , pp. 7-8 ^ For an eyewitness account see William Shirer, Berlin Diary (New York, 1941), pp. 213-16 Otto D Tolischus, They Wanted War (New York, 1940), p 302. ^ See Hitler’s letter to M.

Poland, not wishing to begin her new existence landlocked and surrounded entirely by hostile states, demanded that in addi- tion to the Polish Corridor, which had no port, the city and harbor of Danzig be given to her. Although in the dim past Danzig had in fact been a settlement of Slavic fishermen, and later a part of Poland, it was also true in 1919 that her population had been German for centuries. Clemenceau himself admitted that “for a long time the population has been German by a large majority.” In addition, there was in Wilson’s program another Point which called for the prin- ciple of self-determination of a people, the right to choose its own national rulers. Much as some of the Allies wished to help the Poles at the expense of the Germans, they did not dare to violate this principle too flagrantly. When LI03M George warned them at the Paris Peace Conference, “Gentlemen, if we give Danzig to the Poles the Germans will not sign the treaty, and if they do not sign, our \\vork here is a failure,” a compromise solution was worked out. As the strict and radical application of either of the two doc- trines would have nullified the other, Danzig was taken away from Germany without being incorporated in Poland. It was made a Free City, placed under the protection of the League of Nations, and endowed with a status of its own. Poland was given extensive and important rights in the Free City — rights not usually granted to a foreign power — thus providing her with access to the sea wdthout putting close to four hundred thousand Germans under Polish rule. These privileges included rights to the use of the port and the rail- roads of Danzig and to postal and telegraphic facilities; they also involved the inclusion of Danzig in the Polish customs system and guaranties for Poland concerning the conduct of the Free City’s foreign relations. THE FREE CITY Geographically, Danzig is located on a large bay of the Baltic Sea, with the Hela Peninsula affording a great degree of protection from the storms of the sea, to whose fury its large cemetery for unknown sailors and fishermen gives eloquent if mute testimony. The territory of the Free City comprised 754 square miles, or THE DANZIG DILEMMA 5 about one-third as much as the state of Delaware/ including tiic cities of Danzig, Zoppot, Tiegenhof, and Neuteich, as well as 252 villages and 63 hamlets, with a total population in 1919 of 357,000, which ten 3 ^ears later had increased to 408,000, the district (Sfadt- kreis) of the city of Danzig alone numbered 195,000, at the earlier date, and 235,000 in 1929. Of the population in 1929, 224,000 were Evangelical Protestants, 157,000 Roman Catholics, and 10,000 Jews, while the rest belonged to a few other denominations or had no church affiliation.® THE GERMAN CHARACTER OF DANZIG The population of the Free City was predominantly German. According to the census of 1923, which provided detailed linguistic information in addition to the usual census data, the Free City territory had 366,730 inhabitants, of whom 30,809 were foreigners Of the total number, 348,493 spoke German habitually, 12,027 spoke Polish (or Kashub and Masurian, two Slavic dialects related to Polish), and 1,629 were bilingual, using both German and Polish.

High Commis- sioner Halving stated in his Decision of September 5, 1921 : . al- most the whole of the inhabitants of Danzig (possibly without ex- ception) talk German and the vast majority are unable to talk Pol- ish.”^\" In Morrow’s viewa wTiting in 1935, Plaking’s wmrds ‘liave lost none of their truth wdth the passage of fourteen years.” Except for the special conditions resulting from the establish- ment of the Free City and her special relationship to Poland, the Constitution and laws of Danzig were remarkably similar to those of the German Republic. In many instances constitutional or legal provisions were identical. The structure of the Free City’s govern- ment w^as modeled after those provided for in the 1919 constitutions of Weimar and the city-republic of Lubeck. Danzig officials were German-trained and were freely exchanged with civil servants from the Reich as Danzigers were accepted into the German government service and Reich officials were called to Danzig.^'^ Throughout her existence as a Free City, her political and cultural life w^'as charac- teristically German in all its aspects, including the bad ones. THE POLISH MINORITY The Polish inhabitants, whether citizens of Danzig or not, en- joyed special minority rights which were embodied in the Treaty of Versailles, in the Constitution of the Free City, and in agreements between Poland and Danzig. In general these rights corresponded to the racial, religious, and linguistic guaranties provided for in the European minority treaties after the first World War. Unfortu- nately, between the two governments there w^as continual friction and controversy over the Polish minority, a controversy not settled in its main issues until 1933. As mentioned, the 1923 census data show^ed a total of 12,027 Polish-speaking inhabitants, counting the Kashubian and Masurian dialects as Polish, plus 1,629 bilingual residents, speaking both Polish and German.

THE DANZIG DILEMMA / police registration records showed 17,000 Polish nationals residing in the Free City,^^ in addition to an undisclosed number of Polish- speaking Danzig nationals. He estimates that at that time the Free City had about 25,000 inhabitants of Polish speech — or about six per cent of the total population — of whom approximately seven thousand were citizens of Danzig, while most of the others were subjects of Poland/^ Polish publicists offer different sets of figures concerning the size of the Polish-speaking population of Danzig. The extreme is represented by Casimir Smogorzewski, who claimed a third of the Roman Catholic population of the Danzig diocese as Polish that would mean a total of some 47,000 Polish Catholics, a figure for which there is no other support. Other Polish claims were more moderate In 1928 when the present writer visited Warsaw to gather data on Polish attitudes toward Danzig, Mr. Orlowski, Chief of the Danzig Section of the Foreign Office, estimated that not more than six per cent of the Dan- zig citizens and not over ten per cent of the residents (including foreigners) were Polish. Mr. Henryk Strasburger, one-time Polish Diplomatic Representative in the Free City, and other Polish writers have claimed a figure of some twenty thousand for the Polish mi- nority, including both Danzig and Polish nationals/^ a total which about coincides with Morrow’s estimate of not more than five per cent of the total population. Some indication of the size of the Polish element among Danzig citizens is contained in the election statistics. The number of votes cast for the two Polish parties ranged from a high of 9,321 (6.2 per cent of the total vote) at the 1920 election to a low of 5,764 (3 . 1 per cent) in 1927.-® In the 1933 and 1935 elections the Polish party totals were 6,743 and 8,310, respectively.-\" IS According to written statement addressed to him by the Department of For- eign Affairs of the Danzig Senate on June 16, 1934; see Foster MS, “The Free City of Danzig,’' Appendix A, p in. 1C Ibid., p, 253 1\" In his book, La Polognc rcstauree, quoted in Morrow, Peace Settlement, p. 109.

Between the Poles and the Germans in Danzig ex- isted deep-seated racial antipathies, aggravated by historical wrongs each had suffered at the hands of the other. Most important of all, Poland was a nation of some thirty million people, confronting a mere four hundred thousand people in Danzig The Allied Powders, foreseeing disputes, proceeded to provide methods of settling them by peaceful means. They put complete jurisdiction over all differences arising between Danzig and Poland in the hands of the League, acting through a resident High Com- missioner, to whom ail matters ‘'affecting the relations between Po- land and the Free City” might be referred by either party. His deci- sions could be appealed to the League Council. Until 1933 hardly a meeting of the League Council passed with- out consideration of some matter concerning the Free City. Like problem children elsewhere, Danzig received a great deal of study and attention. A large number of disputes between her and Poland involved such varied questions as railways, the status of Polish na- tionals in Danzig and that of Danzig nationals in Poland, also com- munications and military questions, as w^ell as the conduct of the Free City’s foreign relations. Did the Poles, for instance, have the right to ship war materials via Danzig when they had their own port of Gdynia to expose to the dangerous explosives ? Should Polish warships be allowed to anchor in the Danzig port when they had harborage of their own a few miles to the east? All of these and many more questions W'ere passed upon by the busy High Commissioners, who sighed many times under the burden of their weight and intricacy. The League Council did not always prove able to keep up with the disputes ; early in 1933 twenty- five were still pending in Geneva. THE LEAGUE CONTEST WITH NAZISM In that memorable year of 1933 the Nazis came into power in the Free City as well as in Germany. To the surprise of everybody, including most of the Nazi rank and file, relations between the new government of Danzig and that of Poland improved considerably. An understanding was reached to the effect that all future differences would be settled by direct negotiations between them, without the help of the League of Nations. By agreeing to this Nazi proposal the Poles helped to undermine the effectiveness and prestige of the THE DANZIG DILEMMA Q League and contributed further to their own isolation brought about by their rapprochement with Hitler Nevertheless the League continued to be kept busy with Danzig affairs. While in the past the Poles and the Danzigers had com- plained bitterly about each other, they now appeared fairly amicable However, many Danzigers began to denounce bitterly their own government, they were opposed to Nazism and wished to say so in public. By asking for help against their fellow-countrymen, they put the League in a most delicate situation This was due to the fact that the League setup concerning Danzig was really twofold, one part dealing with Danzig-Poland relations, the other attempting to make Danzig safe for democracy. In 1933 the Free City had a Nazi government which wished to make Danzig a miniature Third Reich. Hitler had been voted into his Third Reich office, and then had done away with the Constitution which made such things possible. Although the Danzig Nazis hoped to do the same thing on a smaller scale, in the election of April 7, 1935, they polled only 57 per cent of the total vote (incidentally, an interesting expression of German sentiment where elections w^ere free), whereas they needed a twm-thirds majority as well as the con- sent of the League Council in order to change their Constitution. Therefore they proceeded to twist and bend the Constitution to serve their purposes. Since in this process parts of the Constitution were broken off, the anti-Nazis in Danzig insisted that the League put them back where they belonged, claiming that certain measures of an anti-Catholic or anti-Jewush character and measures dealing with the freedom of the press, of speech, and of elections and with per- sonal liberty were unconstitutional. In support of their stand they dug up a resolution of the League Council of 1920 to the effect that 'The constitutional life of the Free City of Danzig must always be in accordance with the terms of this democratic Constitution” (curi- ously enough, a subject of the Emperor of Japan had proposed the resolution). The Catholics, Socialists, and Jews in Danzig, tucking this Coun- cil resolution of 1920 under their arms, hurried to Geneva, where they petitioned the League of Nations for restoration of their do- mestic constitutional rights The Council, puzzled like other mortals by questions of constitutional law, finally appointed a special Com- mittee of Jurists — one Dane, one Swede, and one Swiss — to deter- mine to what degree the Constitution of Danzig had been violated. They found several infractions. Soon afterward another action by the Danzig government w^as declared unconstitutional in an Ad- 10 THE DANZIG DILEMMA visory Opinion of the World Court. The League Council was em- barrassed. What should it do ? The simple fact was that the National Socialists in the Free City were feverishly busy creating a Danzig government exactly after the Hitler model, not only because they wished to be in power, but also — and this was very important — because the 1935 election in Danzig showed over forty per cent of the population to be in opposition to the Nazis in spite of all attempts to convert or intimidate them. Such a showing must of necessity create a bad impression in the Third Reich; the Nazis were therefore bound to try to get rid of all opposition within the Free City, by any and all means at their disposal. Since their efforts coincided largely with the period of decline of the League of Nations, their strong-arm methods proved successful. DANZIG AND THE POLISH CORRIDOR Often as Danzig and the Corridor have been linked in public print, their problems were not identical. ““ Comprising the major part of the old Province of West Prussia, known as Pomorze under the Polish rule, the Corridor contained some 6,290 square miles, an area roughly the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. From a narrow width of twenty miles near Danzig it widened to fifty or sixty miles from Pomerania to East Prussia and to more than a hundred between the pre-1914 Russo-German frontier and the Baltic Sea. In addition to being important as Danzig’s geo- graphic back door, the area had a varied and distinctive economic character. The forested, slightly mountainous northern section gives way to rolling plains, cultivated by industrious and capable peasants, who normally reap a plentiful harvest of livestock, grains, potatoes, and sugar beets; in good times their surplus of agricultural com- modities was shipped abroad or sent to the interior of Poland. This was due primarily to the more advanced German type of farming in this part of Poland, contrasting sharply with that of other parts of the country. In the south there is a considerable amount of indus- try, with scattered towns, notably Bromberg, Thorn, and Graudenz. In the area close to Danzig, the one-time tiny fishing village of 300 people known as Gdynia, transformed by Poland into a modern port, literally dug out of the shoreline and built into the water in a place where nature had made no provision for a harbor, expanded with For an excellent study of the Corridor problem see Morrow, Peace Settle- ment, chapters vi— xii. THE DANZIG DILEMMA II amazing speed into a city of over 100,000 population. Since the Corridor comprised approximately a million people, over half of whom were Polish, with a few Kashubians, also Slavic in origin, and about 385,000 Germans (in 1910)“^, it had its own economic as well as strategic importance, both greatly enhanced as the years went by More important still, the Corridor served as a kind of economic crossroads, where the commerce between the Reich and East Prussia met the Polish trade moving to and from the sea. The Free City of Danzig, on the other hand, only one-eighth the size of the Corridor, was a highly developed shipping and commercial center with a popu- lation of 400,000, of which 95 per cent were German. As an able student of the problem puts it : The Free City and the Corridor are contiguous, it is true, and there are bonds between them ; but they are divided in race and religion, in politics and in culture, and they perform distinct economic functions. It is this division which explains the creation of Gdynia, wFile in turn Gdynia heightens the contrast between Danzig and the Corridor.-^ GDYNIA RISE OF A RIVAL After Danzig had been shorn of her importance as a German military and naval center and had become a free city, expected to live in close collaboration with Poland, commerce again provided her economic lifeblood. Owing to her geographic position, she had been a trading center for 900 years. In direction, her commerce had shifted in historic periods and changed in character, “now moving “The city itself looks like a mushroom growth, much like our Western towns of thirty-five years ago” (Shirer, Berlin Diary, p 176). The official German census figures for 1910 were 528,000 Poles (including Kashubians), and 385,000 Germans; see H W. V. Temperley, Peace Conference of Paris, II, 214-15 The Polish census of 1931 lists 1,086,000 people in the province of Pomorze, of whom 977,000 were Polish-speaking and 110,000 (10 1 per cent) German-speaking; see Foster MS “The Free City of Danzig,” Appendix A, p. ii, quoting Pierzusce Tymcoasowe Wyniki Spisii Andnosci Z Dn. 9 Grudma 1931 R. (Warsaw, 1932). Foster also refers to the ethnographic map on p 6 of the Rzecs- pospolita Polska Atlas Sfatysfycany (Statistical Atlas published by the Central Statistical Office of the Republic) (Warsaw, 1930) The Poles do not count the Kashubs separatel}^ Many Poles had, of course, come into Pomorze since 1919, while many Germans had departed. The writer recalls a statement made to him in 1928 by Freiherr von Thermann, German Consul-General in Danzig (later well known as the Nazi ambassador to Buenos Aires), to the effect that his office was refusing consular visas to Germans living in the Corridor and wishing to move to Germany, since Berlin wanted as large a German population as possible to remain in the Corridor.

The profound differences between the Germans, who deeply re- sented being torn from their Fatherland, and the Poles, equally resentful because they did not get control of the city and the port wxre not allayed by the fact that Danzig’s commerce assumed greater proportions after the establishment of the Free City than at any time during the nineieenth and twentieth centuries. Nor was the situation improved by the competition of the new port of Gdynia,\"^ located only eleven miles w'est of Danzig wdiere the Polish Corridor meets the sea By 1933, it had outdistanced ancient Danzig in volume and value of goods handled. The ‘'up- start” port, on which Danzigers had looked first wdth contempt and then with growdng anxiety, had become a pow^erful weapon in the hands of Poland and an implicit threat to the economic existence of the Free City. The clash betw^een the two rivals led to intensified disputes betw'een the Free City and Poland that put a heavy strain on the League of Nations machinery for settling them. When the Nazi government came into office in Danzig in May 1933, a broad agreement w^as concluded^''' that seemed to settle this as well as other outstanding issues. But the Nazi attitude w^as obvi- ously based upon the desire of the Hitler government to have peace- ful relations with Germany’s eastern neighbor while it was busy in the \\vest and south, reoccupying and refortifying the Rhineland, building a navy, annexing Austria, and destroying Czechoslovakia’s independence. When it became evident that France and Great Britain were not walling or able to put a stop to Nazi expansion, Poland found out by bitter experience that Hitler’s promises could not be relied on — not even his signature on the solemn Treaty of 1934, proposed by him and guaranteeing the mutual boundaries of Germany and Poland for ten years. It wns obvious now’ that the Nazis, merely biding their time, had effectively neutralized Poland by protestations of good w’ill and an apparent readiness to settle disputes on an amicable basis. Foster MS, p 6 See below, pp. 130 it See below, p. 137 THE DANZIG DILEMMA 13 DANZIG A SYMBOL OF DEFEAT The repossession of Danzig by the Reich was as much a necessity for the Nazis as it was an answer to the patriotic prayers of Germans of all classes, creeds, and political beliefs. In fact, because of the age- old struggle between the Slav and the Teuton along Germany’s east- ern boundaries, the very German character of the city, and the great charm of Old Danzig, the city became a symbol of Germany’s “bleed- ing borders” which endeared itself to Germans beyond the compre- hension of the average foreigner. Emotions thus became identified with one of the hardest problems tackled by the Paris Peace Con- ference. When Hitler had achieved his aims elsewhere, he turned his full force on Poland. The bloody fight was on. And as the spectacle of two rival seaports receded, the struggle for possession of the vast hinterland moved into the foreground of events. 2 A THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY^ (997-1918) When in 997 St, Adalbert, bishop of Prague, traveled to Sam- land, east of Pomerelia, to convert the heathen Prussians, he boarded his ship at Danzig. He was accompanied to the port by soldiers of the Polish Duke Boleslas the Brave (992—1025), who controlled this coastal territory as far as the present city of Stettin. In St. Adal- bert’s biography, by the Roman abbot Canaparius, we find the first mention in history of Danzig, as Gyddanyzc. The meaning of the name remains unknown, ~ and whether it is of Germanic or Slavic origin is still a topic of controversy, although claimants for the Slavic origin seem to have made a better case.^ Gyddanyzc was then probably a modest settlement of Kashubian fishermeiP who also did some occasional trading with their neigh- bors. Commercial relations gradually expanded, until during the eleventh century, judging from the hundreds of coins excavated in the region, they reached from Danzig to Germany, England, Bo- hemia, and Hungary. In the more immediate neighborhood, trade found its way to Pomerelia and Prussia, and on the inland route to Thorn and Posen. As civilization advanced, St. Catherine’s, the first Christian church in the Vistula district, was founded. Built about 1150, St. Catherine’s still stands in impressive beauty, located on the ancient, tree-bordered moat in the heart of the city. ^ Except as otherwise indicated, this historical account follows Erich Keyser, Danzigs Geschlchte (Danzig, 2d rev ed., 1929). An evaluation of books on Danzig history is found in Catherine Snell Crary, “The Free City of Danzig.

A THOUSAND YEARS OF lilSTORY ^5 DANZIG AND POMERELIA, 1123-1308 While Pomerelia was included in the Polish diocese of Wlocla- wek in 1123,^ it was not politically subject to Poland. The local duke, Swantopolk (1222-1266), for example, defended his rule victoriously against the Polish dukes who attempted to subject him, while Pope Gregory IX recognized his independence and threatened the Polish princes with heavy ecclesiastical penalties in case they continued to wage war on him. Despite the fact that the native rulers of Pomerelia were Slavs, they appreciated the more advanced Teutonic civilization and en- deavored to attract German immigrants by founding convents and monasteries (for example, in 1170 and 1209), endowing them with large tracts of lands, and filling them with German nuns and monks. Duke Swantopolk granted his protection to the Lubeck merchants who brought salt and cloth to Danzig, lowered the customs duties in their favor, and expressly prohibited the exercise of the right of salvage against them In 1235 he gave Danzig the constitution of a German city, granting it the German law code of Lubeck.® The development of commerce and settlement went hand in hand, resulting in the German colonization of wide stretches of Eastern Europe. The German merchant imported food and raw materials from these sparsely populated districts; the German agriculturist, whether peasant or big landowner, sought land to insure the economic future for himself and his children, and the monks went forth to make converts both for Christianity and for Teutonic civilization. The monasteries promoted the settlement of peasants, and the mer- chants established market-places, cities, and churches. Danzig merchants and artisans profited considerably from Ger- man immigration into Pomerelia and Prussia. It was also to local advantage that German businessmen, traveling to the new cities of Riga and Reval farther east on the Baltic coast, found it convenient to establish themselves at Danzig as well.’^ ® The Polish Professor Simon Askenazy, Danz'g and Poland (London, 1921), p. 7, speaks only of '‘the spiritual guardianship of a Polish bishop,” giving the date as 1148. ^ According to J. Kauffmann, Danzigs Dcutschtum, sfaatliche Selbstandig- keit und Geltiing in dcr V crganqcnhcit. Urkundcn in Lichtlnldcrn aus dcni Dan- zig er Staatsarchiv (Danzig, no date), p. 3, the law of Lubeck was thoroughly Ger- man. Askenazy, Danzig and Poland (London, 1921), p. 7, states: “Under the rule of the Slav princes of Pomerania, Dantzig grew and was transformed step by step — thanks partly to the introduction of industrious German colonists during the thir- teenth century.” In 1295 the law of Magdeburg was substituted for that of Lubeck \" See Erich Keyser, Danzig (Berlin, 1928), for a fine collection of photographs of the city. 10 THE DANZIG DILEMAIA Imports came to Danzig by sea or through romerelia; exports were shipped upstream on the Ahstula River or on the old commer- cial highway into the interior of Pomerelia. The economic develop- ment of Danzig', although continuous, made slow progress. It was handicapped by Sw'antopolk’s fights with his brothers and the Teu- tonic Order, which kept the region, city, and countryside in a state of continuous excitement. After Swmntopolk’s death (1266), his sons fought each other bitterly. One son, Wartislaw, Duke of Danzig, enjoyed the support of the Teutonic Order. His brother Mestwfin offered Danzig to the Margraves of Brandenburg if they would save him in the emergency. The Brandenburgers, welcoming the opportunity to extend their rule to the mouth of the 'Vistula, occupied Danzig in 1271. When Mestwin regretted his bargain, he obtained the help of Duke Boleslas of Great Poland, reconc|uered Danzig, and punished severely the burghers and noblemen who had done homage to the Margrave Upon his death in 1294 the first personal union took place between Pomerelia and Poland under Mestwfin's successor — Przemyslas, Duke of Pomerelia and King of Poland. During the struggle for succession which follow'ed Przemyslas’ assassination two years later, the several contestants for the rule of Pomerelia called in their neighbors for assistance. Danzig was occupied in turn by the Teutonic Knights (1301), the Branden- burgers (1308), and again the Knights (1308); the rule of the Order over Danzig lasted from 1308 until 1454. THE EMERGENCE OF THE POLISH STATE The Polish state emerged on the European scene in the middle of the tenth century after many long wars with Czechs, Russians, and Germans, during which it had extended its frontiers to include what is now knowm as Eastern Galicia and Silesia. It had gained a strong foothold on the Baltic shore in the north and had added the Slovak country beyond the Carpathian Mountains in the south.^ In the days of Boleslas the Brave (992-1025) and again, after heavy reverses, under King Boleslas III, the Wry-Mouthed (1102-1138), Polish armies controlled the Baltic coast as far as the present city of Stettin. [Across the] plains and up and down the rivers, the frontiers of Poland moved back and forth for eight hundred years, according to the fortunes of war and the marriage of princes. The Czechs and the Magyars from the south, the Tartars from the east, and the Swedes and lesser tribes 8 Roman Dyboski, Outlines of Polish History (London, 1925), p 17. Hereafter cited as Polish History. A THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY 1/ from the north provided from time to time the forces by which, or against which men moved these boundaries. But from the very beginning of re- corded history of these regions to our own day two other peoples with brief intermissions, have been pressing forward or were being pressed back in conflict with the Poles ; the Germans from the west, the Russians from the east.® The early Polish conquests were not lasting, for with the death of Boleslas III another period of Polish decline followed — a longer and darker eclipse than before. For two centuries and more (the largest part of the twelfth, the entire thirteenth, and the first third of the fourteenth) Poland existed only as a group of warring prin- cipalities.^® In addition, the Tartar invasions, the first of which in 1241 devastated the whole of Poland, scourged the country periodically for almost five hundred years. No wonder that a Poland torn intern- ally and threatened externally by Tartars was unable to prevent the German Drang nach Osten, which had been definitely under way since the eleventh century and was now led by the Teutonic Knights. DANZIG AND THE TEUTONIC ORDER, 1308-1454 The religious Order of the Teutonic Knights consisted of Ger- man knights who had dedicated their lives to the fight against the infidel. Formed in the beginning of the thirteenth century in con- nection with the Crusades, it was ready early in the fourteenth cen- tury to shift operations entirely from the Mediterranean to the Baltic and the Vistula. It had been ''an ill-starred moment for Poland/\" to quote the Polish professor, Roman Dyboski, when they were summoned as allies against the heathen Prussians by one of the Polish territorial princes, Conrad of Masovia, in 1226, and encour- aged by a grant of land. They exterminated the Prussian nation root and branch, and its name was appropriated afterwards by its German succes- sors. But the rescuers soon became a thorn in the side of the rescued ; combats against the German Knights henceforward are an even more constant feature of medieval Polish history than the periodical fights against the Tartars. By uniting with her northeastern neighbor, Lithu- ania, against the common foe, Poland finally beat down the German Knights and succeeded in securing access to the Baltic for good; but it took more than two centuries of wars to achieve that end, and in vanishing from history at last, the German Knights left behind them as ^ H H. Fisher, America and the Nezv Poland (New York, 1928), pp. 4-5. Dyboski, Polish History, p. 20 ; Robert H. Lord, “The Resurrection of Po- land,” in Temperiey, Peace Conference of Paris, VI, 221. THE DANZIG DILEMMA i8 their successor in early modern Europe the secular duchy of Prussia, which from a vassal of Poland, developed into one of its powerful de- stroyers/^ It must be added, of course, that in addition to its destructive features, the Order also had to its credit great civilizing accomplish- ments in this wilderness area, consisting of marked advances in com- munications and agriculture, through the building of roads and canals, the draining of land, and many other improvements.'\" As a part of the domains of the Teutonic Knights, Danzig pos- sessed several advantages. The arms of the Order protected the city against the foreign aggressions, which had been so prevalent in pre- ceding decades, thus allowing commerce to develop undisturbed. While the diplomatic connections of the Grand Master gained pro- tection and recognition for her citizens when traveling or residing in foreign countries, the Order did not interfere unnecessarily in municipal affairs, but confined itself to the exercise of its sovereign rights. ^ Numerous immigrants from western and central Germany con- tinued to arrive and settle in the city, which around 1300 had a popu- lation of between 1,500 and 2,000. The Danzig historian, Erich Keyser, who is also a student of population, estimates that in the decades toward the end of the fourteenth century 30 to 45 per cent of the inhabitants in the city proper were between the ages of 20 and 40 years — an age proportion, he points out, similar to that of the United States at the turn of the nineteenth century. In both cases — the colonization of German eastern Europe and the building up of the United States — the large number of persons in the prime of manhood resulted from the immigration of young and enterprising persons. To their energy \\vas due the first period of Danzig’s boom and prosperity. By 1416 Danzig had a population of 20,000, one about equal to that of Hamburg, Liibeck, or Nuremberg.^\"^ Danzig’s commerce flourished and greatly expanded in the four- teenth century, while under the military protection of the Knights trade relations grew up with the Prussians on the eastern side of the Vistula. As a result of increased wealth, architecture flourished. In Dyboski, Polish History, pp 21-22 12 Morrow, Peace Settlement, p 4. 12 After 1350, immigration became so heavy that in some years as many as 300 persons acquired Danzig citizenship; the annual average for 1364-1399 was 175. A number of these immigrants were Scotchmen, according to Erich Keyser, Bevol- kerungsgeschichte Deutschlands (Leipzig, 1938), p. 266. Danzig’s suburb of Alt- schottland has enjoyed this name since the fifteenth century. Ibid., p. 203. A THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY jp 1359 St. Mary’s Church was enlarged, the city hall was finished in 1382, and Arthur’s Court, the merchants’ splendid meeting place, was remodeled. These richly decorated Gothic buildings are still landmarks in Danzig. At first a majority of the inhabitants made a living as artisans; only later did commerce take first place in the city’s business life. Although the butchers, bakers, and smiths belonged to the oldest guilds, in numbers they were surpassed by the brewers, who counted not fewer than 378 members in 1416. The business in the meat markets next to St. Mary’s became so brisk that it was necessary to prohibit the carrying of pigs, baskets of meat, and halves of beef and hogs through the church. DANZIG AS A HANSEATIC TOWN But Danzig’s ambitions went much farther. Her increasing pop- ulation and expanding industry gave the merchants an early oppor- tunity to take part in the activities of the Hanseatic League and to send their own fleets of ships to the busiest ports of the Baltic and North seas. During the century and a half of Danzig’s existence under the Teutonic Order she formed increasingly closer relations wdth the League, seeking its support in order to strengthen her posi- tion in relation to the Knights, and also against Poland, as the prob- able successor of the Order. Although Danzig had participated in the affairs of the League as early as 1295, realizing that economic advantages could be gained in foreign countries only in co-operation with other German cities having similar aims, she first sent one of her city councillors to the Hanse meeting in Greifswald in 1361 ; after 1377 she was represented at all the League meetings. The Hanseatic League played a dominant role in northern Euro- pean trade in those days. The ships of its member cities plied from the Gulf of Finland to the Bay of Biscay, exchanging fur, hemp, and honey from the northern countries for the fruits of the south and carrying cloth from England and Flanders as well as herring from Sweden and grain from Prussia. The member cities of the League were united in common aims, leading even to joint military action. For instance, they conquered Copenhagen, forcing the king of Denmark in 1370 to grant them special concessions at Falsterbo on the Schonen. Here the herring caught by the Danish fishermen Morrow, Peace Settlement, pp. 22-23 See W. R. Shepherd, Historical Atlas (2d rev. ed., New York, 1921), p. 98, “Medieval Commerce,” showing sea routes of the Hanseatic League and territory of the Teutonic Order. 20 THE DANZIG DILEMMA were salted and packed in barrels to serve as Lenten food in the interior of Germany, and among the numerous ships from many ports and the thousands of people assembled each fall quantities of other goods as well Avere marketed^'' Toward the turn of the fourteenth century a significant change took place in Hanseatic trade that greatly affected Danzig. A num- ber of states began to curtail the special trading privileges of the German merchants in their ports and to stress the development of their own economic life. Dutch and English traders wanted to deal with the hinterland themselves, instead of being limited to the Han- seatic towns as intermediaries. Danzig suffered further losses when in 1429 tolls were levied on ships passing through the Sound on their way to the North Sea. Since at the same time the herring business on the Schonen de- creased, she had need to look around for new commercial opportuni- ties. Although her trade with Russia always remained small, her business relations with Lithuania became increasingly valuable.^' Danzig merchants located in Kovmo exported wax, leather, and hemp to western Europe via Danzig, and imported salt. Commerce with Poland also increased considerably, exports from that country con- sisting primarily of wood, ashes, pitch, and tar. From Posen, Polish cloth w^as shipped via Danzig to Novgorod; goods w^ere exchanged with Hungary and the Near East via Lemberg and Cracow; yew wood was sent from the Carpathian Mountains to England to be made into crossbows ; and for a long time timber took first place in imports from Poland. As in more recent times, merchants located in the city at the mouth of the river advanced money to the Polish raftsmen for the purchase of the logs up the Vistula. Peaceful relations betw'-een Poland and the Teutonic Order be- came of more and more importance to merchants of Danzig as trade changed its primary direction from the old western-to-eastern- Europe route toward the establishment of close economic ties be- tween the north and the south. In the course of time friction arose betw^een the Teutonic Knights and the Danzig burghers over the increasingly lucrative economic activities of the Order — often a source of keen competition for the Danzig merchants. Moreover, difficulties concerning the centralizing o o ^^Hans Becker, “Danzigs Handelsbeziehungen zu Danemark” in Hanns Bauer and Walter Millack (eds.), Danzigs Handel in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart (Danzig, 1925), pp. 42-44 Hereafter cited as DanHgs Handel Walther Recke, “Danzigs Handelsbeziehungen zu Osteuropa,” in Bauer and Millack, Danzigs Handel, pp. 16, 21-22. A THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY 21 policy pursued by the Grand Master threatened to curtail the liberties of the towns under his rule. Unfortunately for the Teutonic Order, it was at this time waging a losing war against Poland. After the disastrous defeat of the Knights at Tannenberg in 1410, Konrad Letzkau, the burgomaster of Danzig, went to the field camp of the Polish king, Jagiello, to do him homage. The king, who already considered himself the suc- cessor of the Teutonic Order, granted Danzig important privileges but soon had to flee. Although now Danzig had again to subject herself to the Order, the city was not punished for her desertion to the enemy , in fact, the same burgomaster was entrusted with politi- cal missions by the Grand Master. Plowever, Danzig refused either to furnish soldiers for the Avar with Poland or to accept a property tax designed to help the Order pay its Polish obligations resulting from the Peace of Thorn in 1411. At length open hostilities broke out between the Knights, who blocked trade on land and water in order to force the city into sub- jection, and the citizens, who now began to strengthen their forti- fications. While new negotiations were taking place, suddenly the burgomasters, Konrad Letzkau and Arnold Hecht, and a city coun- cillor were taken prisoners while conferring in the castle of the Order and were killed Eight days later their bodies were given over to the enraged citizens Although the resistance of the city was now broken and a heavy fine was levied upon it, this horrible deed deepened the rift between Danzig and the Order more than any previous or subsequent occurrence. During the succeeding years the relations between the Order and Danzig improA-^ed someAAdiat; but elseAvhere discontent greAv. Fac- tions eA^en appeared among the Knights, A\\dio Avere at times guilty of insubordination toAvard their superiors. Individual officials mis- used their power, since the government of the Order Avas Aveak. Al- though reluctant to break Avith the Knights, Danzig at last took the decisive step by joining the other cities that had offered their submis- sion to the king of Poland in exchange for support against the Order. On March 6, 1452, Danzig and Poland Avere joined in a personal union ; and on July 16, 1454, Danzig paid homage to the Polish king in return for the grant of important privileges By this action the patricians shoAved that they were not conscious of — or at least set no high value on — ties of race with the Teutonic Knights. They thought only of the menace to Danzig’s commercial power and of their desire to see Danzig as strong and independent as possible in the impending changes in the balance of poAver in THE DzVNZIG DILEMMA eastern Europe As Morrow remarks, through these struggles for independence, the Danzigers still further strengthened their proud civic patnotibin that runs like a scarlet thread through the history of their subsequent rela- tions with the Polish kings. In these years they learnt to think and feel and to act as Danzigers, and to place the interests of Danzig before those of the States to which they were bound either by allegiance or by racial ties.^^ After the Knights had voluntarily vacated the Burg, the Dan- zigers tore it down to prevent the Polish king from possessing a fortified place near the city.^^ Since the burghers and the city coun- cil were one in the endeavor to gain under the new state as much eco- nomic and political independence as possible, Danzig entered the thirteen-years war of Poland against the Order, making enormous sacrifices, maintaining large forces of mercenaries, and taking part in several sieges, until the second Peace of Thorn in 1466 confirmed the separation of West Prussian cities from the Teutonic Order and gave the sovereignty over the land of the Vistula to the king of Poland. DANZIG AND POLAND (1454-1793) Danzig’s secession from the state of the Teutonic Knights con- tributed greatly to the immense growth of the city, now free from a restraint which had become more and more oppressive. When Danzig acknowledged Casimir of Poland as sovereign,^*^ she did so upon her own conditions and for the sake of gains which had caused her to forsake the Order, The city now had such power that she was the subject of the Polish king more often in name than in fact. Casimir early confirmed the rights of Danzig to make her own laws and to enjoy absolute freedom of internal administration; indeed, decrees of the Polish king and diet needed the consent of the Danzig council and of a committee of burghers in order to attain the force of local law. Since she enjoyed the privilege of levying taxes and customs duties in her territory and of coining her own money, the city’s influence grew with her wealth. The harbor and shipping were also under the city’s control. The right to stop imports and exports IS Morrow, Peace Settlement, p. 22. See Shepherd, Historical Atlas, p. 88, ‘'Decline of German Power 1380-1560,” showing losses of Teutonic Order domains to Poland. This event has lent itself to widely divergent interpretations by German and Polish historians, described in Morrow, Peace Settlement, p. 23 n. 20 E. Witte, Die Rechsstelhing Polens in Danzig zur Zeit Kasimirs IV und Heute, published doctoral dissertation, University of Konigsberg, 1933 A THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY as she saw fit gave the whole trade of the Vistula into her hands, while the privilege of maintaining her own troops and erecting for- tifications added greatly to her power. Danzig was able to remain a member of the Hanseatic League, to conclude offensive and defensive alliances with foreign nations, to maintain her own diplomatic representatives abroad, and to receive the envoys of other powers. A highly favorable financial position enabled her to use the powerful language of ''large loans'' when ne- gotiating for advantages with a king who had desperate needs and decreasing opportunities to provide for them out of his own means. While other Hanseatic towns lost more and more of their power to neighboring princes, Danzig gained a position that gave her the might, although not always the legal right, to pursue her political and economic policies even against the will of the sovereign. The rights which the Polish king possessed in Danzig were few in number and slight in importance.^^ As a sign of his sovereignty he was allowed to appoint from among the councillors a Burgrave who was his deputy, entitled to confirm sentences of death imposed by the Danzig court. The city was also obliged to pay the king an annual rent of 2,000 Hungarian guilders and to provide shelter for him and his suite during three days each year. Although the Polish kings attempted to secure control over the harbor and its customs revenues, as the Knights had tried to do, they did not succeed. The burghers were united in opposition to such a decisive step, and Poland became increasingly dependent upon the support of Danzig. During the almost 350 years of Danzig-Polish union, Poland enjoyed the desired access to the sea, subject, however, to considerable restriction imposed by the coastal city in her own favor. The burghers were skillful in the exploitation of Danzig's favor- able geographic and economic position. While the political connec- tion with Poland was important for the city in the sense that it had exchanged the increasingly strict rule of the Teutonic Order for the loose sovereignty of the Polish kings, it was not the favor of the Polish kings that made Danzig great. She held her own without the Polish state, often enough in opposition to it. The goal of Danzig politics was always to control the Polish trade but to be ruled as little as possible by the Polish kings. “^Genevieve Levesque, La situation Internationale de Danfcig (Paris, 1924), p. 16. For examples of Danzig’s diplomatic correspondence, see Kauffmann, Danzig s Deutschtum, pp. 16, 21-22. “2 Camille Piccioni, ‘He Statut International de Dantzig,” in Revue Generate de Droit International Public ^ XXVIII (1921), 84. 24 THE DANZIG DILEMMA At the same time Danzig consistently refused to renew relations with the Teutonic Order. A revolt against the city council failed immediately when it became known that its leader intended to hand the city over to the Knights. When they attempted to reconquer tlieir lost territories, Danzig soldiers and ships joined the Polish army on at least two occasions to repulse the attack by the Knights Danzig now developed into one of the largest commercial cities of Europe, with trade relations extending to other Baltic ports, and to Holland, France, England, and Scotland. The prosperity resulting from these extensive trade relations enabled the burghers to finish the tremendous buildings, most of which were begun under the rule of the Knights, with larger means and a more mature taste. The Town Hall tower was considerably increased in height; Arthur’s Court, rebuilt after a fire, became the favorite place for festivities and has remained so down to the present time; St. Mary’s, finished at last, was richly decorated by artists from the Rhine and the Dan- ube, who evolved a characteristic Danzig style. THE RISE OF THE REFORMATION In the early sixteenth century, the Protestant Reformation found its way to Danzig, in spite of opposition by the king and the church of Poland. As in other German cities, the local religious changes were closely associated with political and social movements arising from dissatisfaction with existing conditions. Reaction against the excesses of the mob set in, however, strengthened by the serious efforts of King Sigismund to restore the old church order against the increasing' influence of the Lutherans. When Sigismund occu- pied the city in 1526 with an army estimated at 8,000 men, he found the population of the city divided. The patricians hoped to regain through the king some of their political power, recently lost through democratic innovations in the city government. Because of the dis- cord among the citizens the king was enabled to sentence the leaders of the new Protestant movement to death or exile. In the ‘'Statuta Sigismund!’' he reorganized the political and ecclesiastical govern- ment of the city; the teaching of the new creed was now forbidden by threat of capital punishment, but its followers were allowed to leave the town. WAR WHTH POLAND In 1572 the election of strong Stephen Bathory, prince of Tran- sylvania, as king of Poland, threatened to aggravate recent conflicts between Danzig and Poland over measures that would have endan- A THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY 2 ^ gered the city’s control of the port and of shipping and decreased her political and military freedom of action. Although the envoys of Danzig had pointed out the established rights of the city, even begging' the monarch on their knees for mercy and justice, the new measures had been put into law (1570). The citizens demanded that the new king confirm the old privileges of the city before they did homage to him. Stephen Bathory refused, advancing in 1576 toward the city with an army of some 17,000 men, while the Danzigers burned down their suburbs to deny them to the approaching enemy In spite of the heavy defeat suffered by the Danzig troops, a strong bombardment of the city by the Poles was unsuccessful After some six months of formal war, the siege of Danzig was lifted. Upon payment of 200,000 gxiilders, all of her established privileges were confirmed and the exercise of the Lutheran creed was again guaran- teed. Danzig had shown that if pressed too hard she was willing to engage the Polish king' as an opponent. With her own strength she had preserved her freedom. POWER AND PROSPERITY During the sixteenth century the enormous growth and crowding of population in western Europe, with the consequent need for im- ports of foodstuffs from the less densely populated eastern surplus regions, proved advantageous to Danzig. She was greatly helped by being a part of the large economic region of the Polish-Lithuanian union reaching from the Baltic to the Black Sea. As the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 and the subsequent closing of the Bosporus to trade stopped the ship- ments of South Russian and Ukrainian grain via that route, it was Danzig’s good fortune to be situated at the mouth of the Vistula River. The exports from the Russian-Polish grain belt now went by this river route to the Baltic. In addition, the growth of the Polish state’s power resulted in domestic peace and economic prosperity in the country, so often torn by violent discord, thus increasing its desire for greater ex- change of goods with the west. Since Danzig had centuries-old, Hanseatic relations on the shores of the Baltic and North seas, great commercial wealth flowed to the city. Goods came from Poland on Vistula rafts and large barges. As formerly, they consisted of grain, timber, flax, pitch, and tar, now in increasing amounts. The popu- lation of Danzig grew rapidly until in 1577 it was about 40,000 and in 1600 about 50,000. Traders’ profits came more and more from their efforts as middlemen, from storing goods arriving from the ^6 THE DANZIG DILEMMA interior, and from selling them to the Dutch, often at a considerable increase in prices. The city’s connection with the Hanseatic League'\"\"^ continued until she became the leader of all the Prussian and Livonian (Lat- vian) member cities. Trade also increased with Lithuania (bound to Poland by personal union), Finland, Sweden, and later Antwerp, which imported enormous amounts, most of them to be sent farther west and south. Salt was imported directly from France, and later from Spain and Portugal, two states willing to accept timber and grain from Danzig. In addition, Europe’s southern fruits, spices, oils, rice, and wine also found their wa}^ to Danzig. When in the second half of the sixteenth century the religious and political disputes in Flanders and Holland paralyzed the local economy, the Italian cities of Florence, Genoa, and the Papal States managed to get their grain directly from Danzig. Trade with Venice was especially lively. Thus Danzig extended her prosperous trade relations over an area reaching from the Gulf of Finland to Portugal and the Adriatic Sea, even to the Levant. Her rich patricians built magnificent homes, full of splendor and comforts. Architects and artists from Holland and Italy found a liberal reception, while the arts and sciences were cultivated in her institutions of learning. TWO CENTURIES OF WAR AND SUFFERING Even though at the close of the sixteenth century Danzig was at the peak of her power and prosperity, signs of change were ap- pearing on the horizon. Peace lasted only a few more decades. For the next two hundred years eastern Europe was torn almost without interruption by wars between Poland and Sweden, Russia and Prus- sia, over the predominance of power in the Baltic Sea and the politi- cal hegemony in the lands along the Vistula. Danzig now suffered for the very reason that her geographical situation was so favorable and important in world commerce; she was too strong to be over- looked by the warring powers, and too weak to defend herself by her own efforts. In addition, political and religious unrest disunited the Danzig population. Not only did Catholics and Protestants fight one another, but Lutherans and Reformed, Calvinists and Men- nonites engaged in quarrels. At first, Danzig was able to keep aloof from Poland’s conflict 23 Erich Keyser, “Danzigs Handel und die deulsche Hanse/’ in Bauer and Millack, Danzigs Handel, pp. 5-15. A THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY 2 ^ with Sweden, although she suffered from its eft'ects. But Gustavus Adolphus carried the war to East Prussia and in 1626 to Danzig, in order to keep Poland away from the Baltic Sea and thus paralyze her economic life and political and military power. The immense debts Danzig contracted in order to pay the costs of war became more and more oppressive because at the same time important changes took place in European economic life. As a result of its continuous w^ars and internal revolts, Poland became a poor country where agricultural pursuits were impossible and traffic was dangerous Poland’s immense forests had been ruthlessly exploited, her rich timber greedily cut down. Since during the Swedish wars the western European states had been cut off from Polish and Rus- sian grain, they had increased their own agricultural production. Danzig naturally suffered from the greatly diminished exports of Polish wood and grain. Impoverished Poland, at the same time, was unable to import via Danzig as many goods as formerly. Poland further raised her customs duties, even on mere transit goods, in order to increase her revenues. When Holstein, Mecklenburg, and Denmark erected their own flour mills and Sweden began to smelt her own iron ore, Danzig industries suffered. When the Swedes were defeated at Poltawa in the Ukraine in 1709, the Russian troops advanced toward the Baltic in order to attack the Swedes in western Pomerania. They occupied the terri- tory near Danzig for a number of years, and were slow to leave even after Danzig had given Peter the Great a gift of 140,000 taler. To .add to the plight of the people, the plague invaded Danzig in 1709, killing 25,000 of her inhabitants. In the struggle for the Polish succession between Stanislas Leszczynski (father-in-law of Louis XV of France) and August the Strong, the Elector of Saxony, Danzig took the wrong side. She supported Leszczynski (1733) in the expectation that he would become a weak king whose rule would affect Danzig more lightly than that of his opponent. The city had to submit to a siege, suffer the destruction of 1,800 houses by bombardment, and carry the cost of warfare amounting to millions of guilders. DECLINE When Danzig first acknowledged the sovereignty of the Polish king, the action had seemed favorable for the city because Poland was a weak state likely to leave her much freedom. Now that Danzig was in great need, and the rise of the modern states had put an end to the era even in eastern Europe when city-states could pursue their ^8 the DANZIG DtLEAIMA own international policies, it was to her great disadvantage that she could not expect support from a weak Poland. The long wars and the fact that the Poles mined more and more salt than formerly and needed less from abroad naturally liad a very unfavorable influence on Danzig commerce. The ports of Stectiii and Konigsberg became stronger competitors. Of still greater con- sequence was the progress of English trade in the Baltic; it almost monopolized commerce with the newly opened Russian ports, while Dutch shipping, upon which Danzig’s connection with western Eu- rope primarily depended, decreased more and more Danzig’s reve- nues decreased immensely, while the city’s expenses for the king of Poland and for her foreign relations doubled. In the hundred years between 1650 and 1750 the population decreased from 77,000 to a mere 46,000. A demand by numerous merchants and artisans for more demo- cratic government in Danzig resulted in royal decrees depriving the privileged patricians of a part of their political and administrative influence, but the grants were dearly paid for. From now on Danzig needed the consent of the monarch when she wished to increase her troops and open or close the harbor for shipping. Danzig’s military autonomy and economic independence were thus decreased. In the meantime Poland’s rapid decline was hastened by increas- ing intrigues of ioreign powers, while her neighbors — Russia under Catherine the Great, and Prussia under Frederick the Great — rose in power and prestige. Finally, in 1772, the first partition of Poland took place.“^ Danzig did not yet become a part of Prussia, because of opposition by Catherine, who refused to accept Frederick’s sug- gestion that both Danzig and Thorn should become free and inde- pendent cities. Instead, Danzig was cut off from her Polish economic hinterland and surrounded by Prussian territory, with its high pro- tective-tariff wall, with the rcsult that she declined steadily. While Danzig suffered under Prussia’s strict measures against her commerce and trade, the economic conditions of neighboring cities under Prussian rule improved. Although Frederick anticipated that sooner or later the Danzigers would no longer be able to oppose their inclusion in Prussia, the people still indignantly declined all suggestions that they subject themselves voluntarily to the king of Prussia. The patricians, who were afraid of losing their freedom under Prussian rule, were too engrossed in traditional ideas to under- F. Reddaway, “The First Partition,” in W. F. Reddaway and others (eds.), The Cambridge History of Poland, 1697-1935 (Cambridge, Mass., 1941), pp. 88-111. A THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY 2Q Stand the signs of the times. Because of the Russian opposition, Prussia did not push the matter. A PART OF PRUSSIA, 1793-1807 At last, on the occasion of the second partition of Poland in 1793, Danzig was taken over by Prussia. There were still many Danzigers who objected, especially the lower classes, who had been influenced by the slogans of the French Revolution and feared that the Prussian monarch would limit their personal freedom. The merchants, on the other hand, had been proposing the Anschhiss for years as the only possible road to economic salvation for Danzig. The city was now occupied by Prussian troops, and did solemn hom- age to the king of Prussia. After 339 years, Danzig again had a Teutonic sovereign. In examining the various causes of Danzig’s downfall Morrow finds that war was the principal one, together with the internal col- lapse of the Polish Republic and the earlier dissolution of the Han- seatic League. He concludes that : The psychological effect of this slow process of decay upon the Danzig patricians was marked in the extreme. It serves to explain much that is not at first sight explicable in the subsequent history of this city, that was once the greatest seaport in northern Europe. With their high estate the Danzigers lost the self-assurance that had formerly character- ized their undertakings. ''The citizen [of Danzig] sighed and bemoaned the changing times. But he lacked the courage and energy necessary for fresh achievement and could not bring himself to assimilate the spirit of the new age by turning his back resolutely upon outworn customs and opinions.” Hence it came about that Danzig fell spiritless and de- fenceless beneath the sway of the Prussian sceptre.-^ Owing to the political pacification and the economic furtherance which the Prussian state devoted to the recently acquired parts of former Poland, Danzig’s trade in grain and timber increased rapidly after the annexation, and industry again flourished. Under such circumstances, the population acquiesced in the new political orientation more quickly than had been anticipated. Pro- tected against external enemies, the Danzigers were able to devote themselves to their industrial and commercial enterprises and enjoyed a happy though brief period of prosperity. After Prussia’s decisive defeat by Napoleon in 1806, Danzig was besieged for ten weeks and was finally occupied by the French.

It was Napoleon’s intention to weaken the Prussian state by the loss of this commercial center and to make it an important base for his own military operations. The old Danzig constitution was now restored but was later changed so as to safe- gTiard the French influence. The financial demands upon the city were immense, the expenses for the forces of occupation alone being 30.000 taler a month. Because of Napoleon’s Continental Blockade, only eleven ships came to Danzig in 1807, fifty-six in 1808, and seventy-three in 1809. Exports were burdened by high fees. Only after 1810 did shipping again increase. When Napoleon prepared for the invasion of Russia, Danzig became one of the important centers where he gathered his armies. The city had to support over 11,000 men at its owm expense for several months. This heavy burden was met in part by melting the gold and silver possessions of the churches and by cuts in salaries for ministers and teachers. In fact, Danzig’s existence as a '‘Free State” under Napoleon’s rule w'as marked by hard times and much suffering. After Napoleon’s defeat the Russians laid siege to Danzig, caus- ing great want among the population. As the result of famine many civilians starved to death ; others ate dogs and cats, spicing the meat with the salt found in old herring barrels ; drinking water was scarce ; and fever and typhus spread rapidly. By the end of the year 1812 the city had only 16,000' inhabitants. Although for a while it looked as if the Russians would try to keep Danzig in their possession, or at least continue it as a free state open permanently to Russian influence, Danzig w^as at length again taken over by the Prussian authorities. But her commerce was destroyed, her storehouses had been burned, and her exchequer was empty. BACK TO PRUSSIA, 1814-1920 The annexation of Danzig by Prussia in 1793 and again in 1814 meant, of course, the loss of the political independence she had en- joyed for centuries. However, significant developments in the trends of international trade during the nineteenth century affected Danzig more than the loss of territorial sovereignty, resulting in the decline A THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY JI of her outstanding importance as a port and center of international commerce. The city’s economic ties with western Europe greatly decreased in value as the result of several changes in trade over which Danzig could not exercise control. After the Continental Blockade Danzig’s commerce decreased considerably, and in 1821 some of her best- known firms went bankrupt England received timber from Canada and the Scandinavian countries instead of from Poland. Great Brit- ain, Spain, and Portugal imposed a protective tariff on Polish grain, while American farm exports greatly increased in competitive impor- tance. Russian grain was again shipped through the Bosporus to the Mediterranean. Russia also imposed high duties on exports via the Prussian border, endeavoring to direct the Polish surplus to her own ports of Riga and Libau. A temporary change for the better set in around the middle of the century. England went over to the free-trade system in 1846; the duties imposed upon goods passing through the Danish Sound were abolished in 1857, and favorable commercial treaties with Russia increased imports into Poland, Dan- zig’s natural Hinterland. The great increase in Danzig’s trade toward the end of the century was due largely to the growing prosperity of an increasing population in the Prussian provinces of West Prussia and Posen. It now became necessary to enlarge the harbor to handle the imports and exports of staples, including Russian raw sugar and salt, Ameri- can petroleum, English anthracite, and Scotch herring. The new Kaiserhafen was built in 1903. The number of ships sailing from Danzig fluctuated. About the middle of the century it went up once more, reaching a total of 3,200 in 1862. Later their number de- creased again with the advent of the steamboat, which pushed the sailing vessels off the sea, limiting them to coastwise shipping. By 1910, steamships to the number of 2,230 entered Danzig, as against only 315 sailing vessels. A number of factories were built in the second part of the nine- teenth century. They included several chemical and furniture fac- tories, breweries, a glass mill, a freight-car-nianufacturing concern, and the spacious railroad repair shops, as well as artistic silver and gold smithies and an amber-cutting shop. In 1853 a rifle factory was taken over by the state, which also owned the artillery works. However, the city did not become an outstanding industrial center. The chief factors against Danzig’s international commercial im- portance were the basic transportation trends of the nineteenth cen- tury. By the 1830’s the Baltic Sea had lost her old-time commercial ^2 THE DANZIG DILEMMA predominance The trade of northern and central Europe, including Germany, no longer went across the waters of the Baltic. It turned largely to the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean Tlie Baltic Sea was now on one of the sidelines of u'orld trade, rather Ilian in the center as formerly. And with the shift in commerce ^ Danzig vras also almost secluded geographically, in spite of the digging of the Kiel Canal In addition, her generally shallow coast was not invit- ing to ocean giants. With the exception of Stettin, the Baltic ports declined. Both Danzig and Liibeck, once the most important ports of northern Europe, now lost their leading positions to Hamburg and Bremen. The introduction of railways was of great importance to Danzig, as it made freight traffic independent of natural waterways, such as rivers. But the actual construction of the railway net by the Prussian authorities tended to neglect Danzig in favor of her rivals, Hamburg, Stettin, and Konigsberg. Stettin was given rail communication with Poland earlier than Danzig, to the considerable advantage of Stettin. Since freight took much less time by train, Stettin soon controlled the market of western Poland, and Hamburg controlled that of Upper Silesia and southern Poland. Danzig’s direct connection with Berlin via Koslin was not finished until 1870, whereas Hamburg’s direct line was built in 1846. Faced with these unfavorable trends and factors, Danzig capital- ized her military and administrative importance. After 1891 the city was the seat of the Seventeenth Army Command (once under Field Marshal von Mackensen of World War I fame), the staffs of two infantry divisions, the famous Death Head Hussars brigade and a field artillery brigade, and after 1894 a military staff school. It was also the garrison for a number of regiments of infantry, ar- tillery, engineers, and hussars. The Totenkopfhusaren reportedly were the favorite regiment of the German Crown Prince, their hon- orary commander. Because of its favorable location on the protected Bay, the city was chosen as the site of the first Prussian navy yard, which in 1871 became an Imperial navy yard. It built warships and in later years especially submarines. The famous Schichau Yards built large warships and commercial liners, including the sister ships named ''Columbus” (1913 and 1922, respectively), of over 30,000-ton size. As the capital of the province of West Prussia, Danzig was the seat of various provincial authorities. They included governmental offices dealing with matters of education, taxation, postal, telephone, telegraph, and railroad service, and public health, as well as the A THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY JJ provincial archives, museum, diet, and chambers of agriculture and trade. The impact on the city's character was profound. Losing her importance as a center of international trade and developing into a seat of governmental administration and the principal eastern Ger- man military and naval center, she became a city of civil servants {Beaintcnstadt) , with a heavy admixture of men in army and navy uniforms. The civil servants and officers came to Danzig from all over the Fatherland and, in turn, her sons went into all corners of Germany in similar capacities. The local patrician families became submerged in the process, while Danzig patriotism gave way to a loyalty of wider scope — to Prussia and, after 1871, to the Kaiser Reich. When 1918 saw the defeat of the Empire, Danzig felt it deeply as a German city. Her attention was soon directed toward the resurrection of the Polish state and its possible expansion toward the mouth of the Vistula River. HISTORICAL SUMMARY In her thousand 3Tars of known history Danzig has run the gamut of fortune and misery, ranging from leading membership in the Hanseatic League to pestilence and destructive war. After the first historical mention in a.d. 997, under the name of Gyddanyzc, when she was a modest settlement of Kashubian fishermen, Danzig existed variously under the Teutonic Knights and Polish princes, with long periods of local sovereignty in between. Owing to her favorable location, her commerce developed early, until, by the elev- enth century, it extended as far as Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, Prussia, and England. German influences were strong in her early history, when Slavic dukes encouraged the settlement of German monks, nuns, and mer- chants. The German law of Liibeck was granted to Danzig in 1235 by Duke Swantopolk. With the rest of Pomerelia, the city became a part of the territory belonging to the Teutonic Knights in 1308. Under the rule of the Teutonic Order (1308-1454), German immi- gration increased and trade prospered. On the other hand, friction 26 After the establishment of the Free City the large residence formerly occu- pied by the German Army Command became the abode of the League of Nations High Commissioners, who considered it too large, uncomfortable, and expensive When an attempt was made by High Commissioner McDonnell to move to more congenial quarters he was persuaded to remain, on the ground that greater prestige attached to this building than to any other in Danzig (see Foster MS, “The Free City of Danzig,’’ p. 47). This was a significant comment on the changed mentality of a city that had existed for many centuries by and for its commerce. THE DANZIG DTLINAOIA developed between the burghers and the Knights and, \\\\ hen the Order crumbled, Danzig joined a personal union with Poland in 1454. In the following period of the rather nominal rule by the Polish kings (1454-1793), Danzig enjoyed immense gronth. She developed into one of the largest and richest commercial cities of the time. As early as 1295 she had participated in the aitairs of the Hanseatic League, becoming in the course of time the leader of all Prtwsian and Livon- ian (Latvian) member cities. Fleets of her ships went to the busy ports of the Baltic and North seas, where the Hanseatic League played a dominant role. While acknowledging Casimir of Poland as her sovereign, Danzig was able to remain a member of the Hanseatic League, to conclude offensive and defensive alliances with foreign nations, to maintain her own diplomatic representatives abroad, and to receive the envoys of other powers. The rights of the Polish kings in Danzig were few in number and slight in importance. During the 340 years of Danzig-Pohsh union, Poland enjoyed the desired access to the sea via Danzig ; but the city had such financial and other power that she was the subject of the Polish king often in name only. Danzig now became one of the largest commercial cities of Europe, with trade relations extending from the Gulf of Finland to Portugal and the Adriatic Sea, even the Levant. In those pros- perous days the burghers built the magnificent public and private buildings which still characterize the city. But at the turn of the sixteenth century Danzig had reached the peak of her power and prosperity and signs of change appeared on the horizon. After a few more decades of peace, eastern Europe was torn almost continuously for some two hundred years as Poland and Sweden, Russia and Prussia sought power in the Baltic Sea and political hegemony in the lands along the Vistula. Danzig was too strong to be overlooked by the powers and too weak to defend herself by her own efforts. She suffered greatly from war and occupation by foreign troops, the plague, and loss of commerce. Danzig de- clined and her population decreased sharply. On the occasion of the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 she was taken over by Prussia. After a brief interlude (1807-1814) as a Free State by decree of Napoleon, Danzig settled down to the life of a Prussian adminis- trative and military center, enjoying a quiet prosperity, Avhile losing her former glory and wealth. During World War I she contributed her share like any other part of Germany. At the war’s end Danzig- found herself separated from the Fatherland and once more set out on a career of independent statehood, subject to certain restrictions in favor of Poland, the natural hinterland of the Vistula city. 3 DANZIG AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE The story of Danzig at the Paris Peace Conference forms a dramatic chapter, and like so many in the city’s history is intimately tied up with that of Poland. The attempt to solve the Polish ques- tion proved to be one of the most vexing problems before the dele- gates assembled to reconstruct war-torn Europe. THE CAUSE OF POLISH FREEDOM The dream of Polish patriots of the resurrection of their ancient state saw a fulfillment in Paris that went far beyond their fondest early hopes. At the outbreak of World War I the slogan of a reborn, free Poland was still a matter of rhetoric, confined to holiday occa- sions in self-governing Austrian Poland where such demonstrations were possible. When the fighting started^ the hopes of Poles flamed up ; but their opinions as to how their national aspirations could best be realized were deeply divided. In fact, in the words of the Polish historian, Roman Dyboski, ‘'disputes between supporters of Russia on the one hand, of the Central Powers on the other, became unfor- tunately the dominant feature of Polish life during the first two years of the war.”^ Joseph Pilsudski, leader of the Polish Socialist party, who had grown up during bitter struggles against Russian tyranny and had lately received support from Austria, led the group supporting the Dual Monarchy. On the other hand, Roman Dmowski and his National Democrats co-operated with Russia, and looked upon Germany as the most dangerous enemy to Polish na- tionality.” Between these extreme tendencies were all shades of opinion.
