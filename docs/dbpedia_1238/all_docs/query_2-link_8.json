        "text": "The Polish version of the article was published in Roczniki Humanistyczne 56 (2008), issue 2. This article is an attempt at systematizing the body of inscriptions that accompanied the heraldic and iconographic inscriptions on Polish military flags and standards in the course of past centuries. It presents the suggestion of dividing them into four groups. The first comprises property inscriptions, giving information about who the flag belonged to, who its owner was or who used it. In the second group are inscriptions called ‘funding’ ones; they contain data referring to the funders or makers of those objects. Commemorative inscriptions were included in group three; they commemorated important events connected with the history of the unit or with its tradition. The fourth group consists of inscriptions in the form of sentences, mottos or apostrophes, usually having a lofty and solemn character. In practice, inscriptions belonging to different groups often appear side by side on the sa...\n\nAny account of Prussian historical identity and its legacy in modern Germany is a difficult and contentious undertaking. This has much to do with the loaded associations that swirl around the word Prussia and its sinister counterpart &quot;Prussiandom,&quot; but it is also because of the origin of the Prussian state itself. As Christopher Clark writes in &lt;i&gt;Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600-1947&lt;/i&gt;, his wonderful history of this extinct European power, Prussia vindicates the view that states are not natural formations but &quot;contingent, artificial creations.&quot; Clark frequently reminds us that the kingdom of Prussia had no natural boundaries, and that there was no specifically Prussian culture, language or cuisine. Prussia was a patchwork, consisting of disparate ethnic and cultural groups spread over wide-ranging and not always contiguous territories. Prussian identity was thus &quot;curiously abstract and fragmented.&quot; Even the name Prussia...\n\nThis paper is concerned with the transformations that took place in the late-medieval and early-modern borderland of Silesia, Greater Poland, Brandenburg and Lusatia in the forms of arms and armour used between the end of the 15th- and the beginning of the 16th century. Gothic elements of arms and armour still exist in the iconography of the borderland until the 2nd decade of the 16th century. Fully developed Renaissance arms and armour (Maximilian, fluted, costume) appear in iconography of this region not earlier that 1530s.\n\nIn the Jelenia Góra department of the State Archives in Wrocław is stored a small part – consisting of 60 archival units – of the current records (Registratur) of the Prussian State Library in Berlin (Preußische Staatsbibliothek) from the years 1939–45. It is a remnant of the office of the Berlin library: catalogue and acquisition departments which operated in the foothills of the Karkonosze mountains in the last months of the Second World War. The first main group of files contain correspondence regarding the mandatory copy (5–14, 23, 24, 27, partly 25 and 28). Along with the transfer of the acquisition department to Jelenia Góra, correspondence regarding the mandatory copy was sent as well. Files preserved in Jelenia Góra can be divided into three groups: concerning the official prints from 1936–1944, correspondence with the military authorities, bulletins and newspapers published in prisoner-of-war camps. The second main group consists of files illustrating the process of obtaining by the Berlin library of manuscripts and prints during the war apart from the mandatory copy (numbers 15–22). These files can be divided into two categories: correspondence with civil institutions as well as military and police authorities of the German state. The aim of this article is firstly to present the archival fonds “Prussian State Library Department in Jelenia Góra” and to indicate its historical value; secondly, to discuss issues that complement our knowledge on the Berlin library’s war activities in the field of acquisition; thirdly – perhaps most importantly – to show clues for further archival searches."
