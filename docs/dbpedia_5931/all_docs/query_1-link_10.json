        "text": "Currently the Autonomous Parisian Transportation Administration (RATP) is the sole bus operator in the capital but is under strain due to worker strikes.\n\nThis has resulted in the French Government considering permitting other companies to run services, with a view of alleviating pressure during next year's Games.\n\nThe PCF proposed to the National Assembly that this could lead to further social conflicts, with civil unrest lasting for more than three months mainly down to the increase of the retirement age from 62 to 64.\n\n\"In 2024, it will collide the allocation of lots to private companies, the allocation of personnel and social negotiations,\" PCF member Stéphane Peu, also Seine-Saint-Denis representative at the National Assembly, told French newspaper Le Monde.\n\nPeu had alleged Île-de-France Mobilités' President Valérie Pécresse of acting \"in a totally irresponsible way\" by engaging in the \"madness\" of allowing competition to the bus network and wanting to be \"the [Margaret] Thatcher of Île-de-France\".\n\nThe PCF had originally proposed a Bill to postpone other companies operating until the end of 2028.\n\nThis was then reduced by two years by the National Assembly before the PCF withdrew it altogether with Peu stating that \"compromises with the majority are only made in one direction\".\n\nThe IDFM is expecting to transport approximately seven million people during the Olympic Games, scheduled to take place from July 26 to August 11, and a further three million for the Paralympics from August 28 to September 8.\n\nRATP is aiming to recruit more than 6,600 new employees this year, with 4,900 of those on permanent contracts.\n\nIt hopes to hire 2,700 bus drivers as well as 400 metro drivers, 700 station agents, 400 maintenance workers and 120 security guards.\n\nThe recruitment drive also takes this year's Rugby World Cup into consideration.\n\nThe tournament is due to run from September 8 to October 28 in venues across the country."
