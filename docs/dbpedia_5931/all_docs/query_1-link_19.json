        "text": "Solution\n\nProviding customized mobility service\n\nThe Boulonnais federation of communities covers 22 municipalities around the city of Boulogne-sur-Mer. To connect its 120,000 residents, the regional authority has developed the Marinéo network, comprising 23 routes – 15 city and eight “green” – to service the rural districts, coupled with school services, on-demand transportation and services for people with reduced mobility.\n\nFree shuttles serve the center of Boulogne-sur-Mer, while two routes operate on market days, enabling residents to go shopping without having to take the car.\n\nBuilding strong relationships with the regional authority\n\nSince 2013, Marinéo has been operated by CTB, a subsidiary of RATP Dev. It implements the strategies defined by the regional authority and fulfils the role of technical consultant. One of the major projects undertaken, the moving and upgrading of the bus station, was an opportunity to introduce new passenger services such as contactless passes that can be topped up at self-service machines, and information displays indicating traffic and timetables in real time.\n\nInnovating to improve the well-being of local residents and protect the environment"
