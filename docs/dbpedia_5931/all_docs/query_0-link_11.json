        "text": "My London reports that the parent company of one of London's biggest bus operators has placed its London operations 'under strategic review', signalling it is considering shutting them down or selling them off. RATP Group, which is the Parisian equivalent of TfL, is the majority shareholder in RATP Dev Transit London which runs hundreds of TfL bus routes under its London United, London Sovereign, London Transit and Quality Line brands. The report refers to the strike for more pay last year which resulted in a 10% pay award. Given TfL's finances, I doubt that this increase was funded by TfL, so RATP presumably have to make efficiency savings to cover it.\n\nCommuters using London buses face disruption as operator considers selling up\n\nEXCLUSIVE: The Parisian equivalent of TfL appears to be falling out of love with its London buses\n\nThe parent company of one of London's biggest bus operators has placed its London operations 'under strategic review', signalling it is considering shutting them down or selling them off. RATP Group, which is the Parisian equivalent of TfL, is the majority shareholder in RATP Dev Transit London which runs hundreds of TfL bus routes under its London United, London Sovereign, London Transit and Quality Line brands. In the event of a sale or withdrawal, there could be some disruption.\n\nIn a letter seen by MyLondon, RATP Dev Transit London managing director Bill Cahill explains to colleagues: \"As you are all aware the bus market and wider transport sector in London have faced, and continue to face many challenges - from rising energy prices to record inflation and driver shortages - all of which have resulted in service issues and penalties. This situation has intensified over the past year impacting our business significantly. This situation is not sustainable long term.\"\n\nIn September, after a series of bus strikes and sustained industrial action from 1600 of its bus drivers in the Unite union, the company agreed a 10 per cent pay increase, up from the initial offer of 3.6 per cent. As a result of the service disruption, TfL was able to withhold some of the payments it issues to the company for the running of bus services on its behalf. London Transit, one of the RATP Dev brands was the worst-performing bus operator of TfL services in recent league tables.\n\nIt's probably becoming too much effort for euro companies after brexit, see also Abellio big pay rise and constant rumours that DB want out of Arriva.\n\nTo be fair, DB has wanted to dump the UK operations ever since it bought Arriva (only buying them for their European operation). They've just been unlucky (or lucky depending on your view of Arriva) in that no-one so far has wanted it!\n\nIt does raise an interesting question though, who would be in the market to buy RATP Dev Transit London (or all of RATPs UK operations). First does seem to be on a buying spree, but would they want to return back to London?\n\nTo be fair, DB has wanted to dump the UK operations ever since it bought Arriva (only buying them for their European operation).

First does seem to be on a buying spree, but would they want to return back to London?\n\nThe problem with DB and its disposal of Arriva (and they are looking to dispose of in-toto) is that they don't have a clear strategic view as to what they want to do. Firstly, it was an IPO (Initial Public Offering), and then a more conventional sale to a financial institution. They probably need to sell something, but that could easily be their freight arm, DB Schenker. Then there's the issue of not really understanding the UK market (risk vs reward) and the pressures of capital investment in the absence of a low-risk return though in RATP's case, even a regulated model is proving to be quite risky!\n\nNot certain that First is a likely purchaser or on a buying spree. They've bought Ensignbus... They've sold First Scotland East and closed Southampton recently.\n\nRATP - London, in the form of London United, London Sovereign and more recently London Transit have recently lost a load of recent Route awards,\n\nThey have just lost: -\n\nH91 to Metroline\n\n142/642 to Metroline\n\nH32 to Abellio\n\nN97 to Go-Ahead\n\nIn the pipeline: -\n\n265 to Go-Ahead (from July 2023)\n\n404 to Abellio (from Sept 2023)\n\nH17 to Metroline (from Sept 2023)\n\n229 to Metroline (from Sept 2023)\n\n223 to Metroline (from October 2023)\n\n228 to Metroline (from Jan 2024)\n\n9/N9 to Metroline(from Jan 2024)\n\nIs it because their bids have been on the high side?\n\nYou are right about these losses, except that it is route 251 not 229 lost to Metroline in September. Route 229 is an Arriva route elsewhere in London.\n\nUnless a new or familiar player comes in, such as National Express or an international company not yet present in Britain, we could have piecemeal divestments to existing operators. RP is on a lease of up to 10 years and is rumoured unsuitable for electrification. We could then have for example CO/BT/SO divested to Go-Ahead, X/S/V/AV/FW to Stagecoach and FW/TV to Metroline. Transport UK Ltd, the management buy-out of Abellio, may not be sufficiently established and may meet with too many competition concerns to be in the running for any acquisitions from RATP.\n\nYou are right about these losses, except that it is route 251 not 229 lost to Metroline in September.

Stagecoach & Metroline might be better placed and if First wanted to re-enter London market - no issue, ditto National Express.\n\nIt has been stated by some that there is no official policy from Tfl, I have also heard that 25% is the limit.\n\nIt might well be that economically, now is a bad time for any company to be investing in major bus companies."
