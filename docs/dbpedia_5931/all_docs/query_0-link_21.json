        "text": "In the Paris metro, on the more modern line 14, an amused young man elbowed his neighbor. \"Look, it's Jean Castex,\" he pointed out. On the train, the former prime minister looked like the meme he eventually became, after a photo of him on a folding seat made its way around social media. The two couldn't help but pull out their phones to take a picture.\n\nA few seats away, a father pointed out the famous passenger to his daughter and asked if he could take a selfie. As the new CEO of the Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP, the state-owned Paris transport operator), Castex kindly agreed, removing his mask – he is one of the few passengers to still wear one. Then he changed metros to a different line, the older line 6, which uses rubber metro tires. Castex paused on the platform, sniffing the air: \"Can you smell the 6? Ah, the rubber-tired metro,\" he said.\n\nThen there was another interruption. This time, a passenger called out to him: \"If I may say so, we see you on TV every night... Have you seen the waiting times [for the metro]? What are you going to do about it?\" Castex gave his reason, then shot back, \"And you, what are you doing right now? As you may know, we're looking for people to hire at RATP. Come join us!\" referring to the staff shortages the RATP has been facing since the Covid pandemic. The young man left, without leaving his CV.\n\nTense talks with regional officials\n\nNonetheless, the new head of Paris transport did take the question seriously. He is concerned about the decline in public transport services Parisians have seen last fall, as well as the rising staff shortages and absenteeism. At the RATP headquarters, along the Seine in the 12th arrondissement, where he took up his post on November 28, Castex barely takes the time to look at the view of the famous river or the Eiffel Tower. Instead, he asked for a screen to be installed with \"the network's daily forecast\" as a matter of urgency. Since then, he has been able to follow the traffic on the metro and the RER commuter trains, which connect suburbs further out from Paris and regions to the city center, in real-time and has been racking his brain to find solutions to repeated technical incidents and the increasing number of abandoned or forgotten bags and passenger accidents that have been disrupting the lines.\n\n\"I want to improve the situation, that's what I'm paid to do,\" he explained bluntly, anticipating what Valérie Pécresse would ask him on Friday, January 13. Pécresse, the president of the Ile-de-France region (which includes Paris), called an exceptional board meeting of Ile-de-France Mobilités (IDFM), the organization that organizes transport in the region. She asked the head of RATP to come and present \"line by line\" his roadmap for improving the standard of service. IDFM, whose acronym appears on the sides of buses and the metro, is RATP's biggest client, with revenues of €4.8 billion expected in 2023."
