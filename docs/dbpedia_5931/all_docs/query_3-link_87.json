        "text": "BANGKOK: Thailand’s main opposition Move Forward Party (MFP) will select a new leader on Thursday, a senior official said, before it relaunches under a new name to counter a court-mandated dissolution.\n\nThe Constitutional Court in Bangkok, Thailand’s top court, voted unanimously on Wednesday to dissolve the MFP, the vanguard of the country’s youthful pro-democracy movement, and ban its executive board members from politics for 10 years.\n\nThose banned include 43-year-old Pita Limjaroenrat, who led the reformist MFP to a shock first place in a general election last year after striking a chord with young and urban voters with his pledge to reform Thailand’s strict royal defamation law.\n\n“Today there will be an internal meeting among 143 people to agree on the selection of a new leader and party committee,” MFP deputy leader, Sirikanya Tansakul, who is expected to succeed Pita, told Thai television on Thursday.\n\n“We are moving to a new home,” she said.\n\nPita’s bid to become prime minister was blocked by conservative forces in the Senate. A fragile coalition of army-linked parties took office instead under Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin.\n\nThe European Union, the United States, the United Nations and human rights groups blasted the court’s decision, which the EU said harmed democratic openness in Thailand.\n\nThe MFP said soon after the ruling that it would relaunch under a new name on Friday.\n\nThanathorn Juangroongruangkit, who led the MFP’s predecessor, the Future Forward Party (FFP), before it was dissolved by the Constitutional Court in 2020, said the new party had the opportunity to become even stronger.\n\n“We want to build a mass party where people actively participate in politics,” he said in a post on social media platform X.\n\n“A strong mass party is the only weapon the people have to create change,” he said, adding that the new party would focus on elections due in 2027.\n\nThailand, Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, is known for chronic political instability, with a dozen coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932.\n\nThe Constitutional Court is due to deliver another major decision next Wednesday, this time on accusations that Srettha had violated ethical rules by appointing a minister who had served time in prison.\n\nAn unfavorable ruling could force Srettha out of office after just a year.\n\nThai media have touted Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, as a potential successor to Srettha.\n\nkeywords\n\nBEDMINSTER, New Jersey: Former President Donald Trump said Thursday he thinks he’s “entitled to personal attacks” on his Democratic rival, adding he’s “very angry” at Vice President Kamala Harris and questioning her intelligence.\n\nTrump was asked during a news conference whether his campaign needs more discipline as he faces a Democratic ticket newly energized since Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the party’s presidential candidate.\n\n“As far as the personal attacks, I’m very angry at her because of what she’s done to the country. I’m very angry at her that she would weaponize the justice system against me and other people, very angry at her. I think I’m entitled to personal attacks,” Trump said at his New Jersey golf club, where he invited reporters in his quest to saddle Harris with Biden’s unpopular economic record.\n\n“I don’t have a lot of respect for her intelligence and I think she’ll be a terrible president,” he added.\n\nThere is no evidence that Biden or Harris weaponized the criminal justice system to target Trump, who has pledged to retaliate with criminal investigations of Biden and his relatives if he wins.\n\nTrump also took issue with Democrats branding him and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as “weird.” Harris is “weird in her policy,” he said.\n\nTrump stuck close to his scripted economic message for more than half an hour, reading from a binder in front of him in a news conference at his New Jersey golf club.\n\nLater, he veered into familiar stories he enjoys telling at his rallies.\n\nA day earlier, he had struggled to make a sustained case for his economic policies during a meandering speech that his campaign had billed as a major policy address.\n\n“Kamala Harris is a radical California liberal who broke the economy, broke the border and broke the world, frankly,” Trump told reporters.\n\nTrump was flanked by popular grocery store items, including instant coffee, sugary breakfast cereals and pastries, laid out on tables as he highlighted the cost of everything from food to car insurance to housing. Posters showed the increase of prices for grocery staples.\n\nAt one point, as Trump talked about the 2020 election he lost, he noticed a box of cereal. “I haven’t seen Cheerios in a long time,” Trump said. “I’m going to take them back to my cottage.”\n\nAs he turned to walk back inside, Trump did not respond to shouted questions about when he last went grocery shopping. The event came one day after the Labor Department announced year-over-year inflation had reached its lowest level in more than three years in July — the latest sign that the worst price spike in four decades is fading.\n\nBut consumers are still feeling the impact of higher prices — something Trump’s campaign is banking on to motivate voters this fall. A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that Americans are more likely to trust Trump over Harris when it comes to handling the economy and immigration, issues he has put at the center of his case for returning to the White House.\n\nHarris is planning her own economic policy speech Friday in North Carolina, promising to push for a federal ban on price gouging on groceries.\n\nTrump predicted he would beat Harris by more that he would have beaten Biden by “once she’s exposed.” “People don’t know who she is,” Trump said.\n\nA small crowd of Trump supporters watched his news conference from the periphery, occasionally cheering him on. But without a crowd of thousands to please with red meat attacks on his enemies, Trump stuck closer to his prepared remarks.\n\nTrump continued lobbing insults at Harris and Biden at an evening event dedicated to Jewish voters, where he was introduced by GOP megadonor Miriam Adelson to an audience that included a Holocaust survivor.\n\nHours before the news conference, Trump’s campaign leaders announced they were expanding his staff, bringing a number of former aides and outside advisers formally into the fold.\n\nCorey Lewandowski, Taylor Budowich, Alex Pfeiffer, Alex Bruesewitz and Tim Murtaugh will advise the campaign’s senior leadership.\n\nLewandowski was Trump’s first campaign manager during his 2016 campaign. Budowich and Pfeiffer are moving over from MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC. Bruesewitz produces pro-Trump content for a large social media following. And Murtaugh was the communications director for Trump’s 2020 campaign.\n\nSummer has been the time for shakeups in Trump’s two prior campaigns. This year’s change comes weeks after the campaign itself was transformed by Biden’s decision to end his reelection campaign and endorse Harris.\n\nTrump gave his top advisers a vote of confidence Thursday, writing on his social media platform that his management team headed by Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles is “THE BEST.”\n\nTrump spoke to the press as he has stepped up his criticism of Harris for not holding a news conference or sitting down for interviews since Biden made way for her.\n\n“I think I’m doing a very calm campaign,” Trump said after being asked about criticism from Republicans who want him to focus less on personal attacks.\n\n“Some of you will say, ‘He ranted and raved,’” Trump said to journalists. “I’m a very calm person, believe it or not.”\n\nNEW YORK: As students return to colleges across the United States, administrators are bracing for a resurgence in activism against the war in Gaza, and some schools are adopting rules to limit the kind of protests that swept campuses last spring.\n\nWhile the summer break provided a respite in student demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war, it also gave both student protesters and higher education officials a chance to regroup and strategize for the fall semester.\n\nThe stakes remain high. At Columbia University, President Minouche Shafik resigned Wednesday after coming under heavy scrutiny for her handling of the demonstrations at the campus in New York City, where the wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments began last spring.\n\nSome of the new rules imposed by universities include banning encampments, limiting the duration of demonstrations, allowing protests only in designated spaces and restricting campus access to those with university identification. Critics say some of the measures will curtail free speech.\n\nThe American Association of University Professors issued a statement Wednesday condemning “overly restrictive policies” that could discourage free expression. Many of the new policies require protesters to register well in advance and strictly limit the locations where gatherings can be held, as well as setting new limits on the use of amplified sound and signage.\n\n“Our colleges and universities should encourage, not suppress, open and vigorous dialogue and debate even on the most deeply held beliefs,” said the statement, adding that many policies were imposed without faculty input.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania has outlined new “temporary guidelines” for student protests that include bans on encampments, overnight demonstrations, and the use of bullhorns and speakers until after 5 p.m. on class days. Penn also requires that posters and banners be removed within two weeks of going up. The university says it remains committed to freedom of speech and lawful assembly.\n\nAt Indiana University, protests after 11 p.m. are forbidden under a new “expressive activities policy” that took effect Aug 1. The policy says “camping” and erecting any type of shelter are prohibited on campus, and signs cannot be displayed on university property without prior approval.\n\nThe University of South Florida now requires approval for tents, canopies, banners, signs and amplifiers. The school’s “speech, expression and assembly” rules stipulate that no “activity,” including protests or demonstrations, is allowed after 5 p.m. on weekdays or during weekends and not allowed at all during the last two weeks of a semester.\n\nA draft document obtained over the summer by the student newspaper at Harvard University showed the college was considering prohibitions on overnight camping, chalk messages and unapproved signs.\n\n“I think right now we are seeing a resurgence of repression on campuses that we haven’t seen since the late 1960s,” said Risa Lieberwitz, a Cornell University professor of labor and employment law who serves as general counsel for the AAUP.\n\nUniversities say they encourage free speech as long as it doesn’t interfere with learning, and they insist they are simply updating existing rules for demonstrations to protect campus safety.\n\nTensions have run high on college campuses since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants assaulted southern Israel and killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took about 250 hostages.\n\nMany student protesters in the US vow to continue their activism, which has been fueled by Gaza’s rising death toll, which surpassed 40,000 on Thursday, according to the territory’s Health Ministry.\n\nAbout 50 Columbia students still face discipline over last spring’s demonstrations after a mediation process that began earlier in the summer stalled, according to Mahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator working on behalf of Columbia student protesters. He blamed the impasse on Columbia administrators.\n\n“The university loves to appear that they’re in dialogue with the students. But these are all fake steps meant to assure the donor community and their political class,” said Khalil, a graduate student at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs.\n\nThe university did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.\n\nThe Ivy League school in upper Manhattan was roiled earlier this year by student demonstrations, culminating in scenes of police officers with zip ties and riot shields storming a building occupied by pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nSimilar protests swept college campuses nationwide, with many leading to violent clashes with police and more than 3,000 arrests. Many of the students who were arrested during police crackdowns have had their charges dismissed, but some are still waiting to learn what prosecutors decide. Many have faced fallout in their academic careers, including suspensions, withheld diplomas and other forms of discipline.\n\nShafik was among the university leaders who were called for questioning before Congress. She was heavily criticized by Republicans who accused her of not doing enough to combat concerns about antisemitism on the Columbia campus.\n\nShe announced her resignation in an emailed letter to the university community just weeks before the start of classes on Sept. 3. The university on Monday began restricting campus access to people with Columbia IDs and registered guests, saying it wanted to curb “potential disruptions” as the new semester draws near.\n\n“This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in the community,” Shafik wrote in her letter. “Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead.”\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters first set up tent encampments on Columbia’s campus during Shafik’s congressional testimony in mid-April, when she denounced antisemitism but faced criticism for how she responded to faculty and students accused of bias.\n\nThe school sent in police to clear the tents the following day, only for the students to return and inspire a wave of similar protests at campuses across the country as students called for schools to cut financial ties with Israel and companies supporting the war.\n\nThe campus was mostly quiet this summer, but a conservative news outlet in June published images of what it said were text messages exchanged by administrators while attending a May 31 panel discussion titled “Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present and Future.”\n\nThe officials were removed from their posts, with Shafik saying in a July 8 letter to the school community that the messages were unprofessional and “disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic tropes.”\n\nOther prominent Ivy League leaders have stepped down in recent months, in large part due to their response to the volatile protests on campus.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill resigned in December after less than two years on the job. She faced pressure from donors and criticism over testimony at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy.\n\nAnd in January, Harvard University President Claudine Gay resigned amid plagiarism accusations and similar criticism over her testimony before Congress.\n\nLARGO, US: An electrified crowd filled a community college gymnasium outside Washington on Thursday — supposedly to cheer lower drug prices, but the Democratic voters in attendance were more excited to celebrate White House candidate Kamala Harris.\n\n“We love you,” screamed one attendee, as the vice president took the floor alongside President Joe Biden at the event to highlight a deal reducing medication costs for retirees on social welfare programs.\n\nIt was the first joint appearance by Biden and Harris since the president announced on July 21 that he was dropping his reelection bid, paving the way for his deputy to take the top spot on the Democratic ticket.\n\n“With Kamala Harris, we are very hopeful and we think she’s going to do it,” said Kimberly Pennamon, 53.\n\n“Prior to the announcement of her candidacy, people were really feeling disengaged,” she told AFP. “The energy is so high now.”\n\nThe mostly African-American crowd was squeezed onto the benches of the school gymnasium in Prince George’s County, a Democratic stronghold in Maryland where more than 89 percent voted for Biden in 2020.\n\nHere, more than 60 percent of the population is Black, and many attendees had high hopes of seeing Harris, who could be the first Black woman, and the second Black person, to ascend to the Oval Office.\n\nSome attendees said they hadn’t gone to any political rallies since Barack Obama’s successful presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012. Now, they say they feel inspired to do so again.\n\nThat was the case for Effie Hillian, 71, who came with a friend.\n\n“We are very excited, very hopeful,” the retired teacher said repeatedly, overflowing with enthusiasm.\n\nRegina Young, 68, noted that she supports Biden, saying “we love him.”\n\n“But the kind of things that people are anticipating happening are different because she’s a woman, she’s a woman of color, she’s like a brilliant woman with lot of experience... people are very excited about that.”\n\nRetiree Mary Larkin said Harris “saved the country and she saved (Biden).”\n\n“I was worried for him. I was very supportive of him, and I would have supported him every minute of the way, but I’m happy that he was the bigger person and stepped down and made room for new people,” she said.\n\nThe 77-year-old snapped photos of Biden and the woman who she hopes will soon have the title “Madam President.”\n\n“It’s a Christmas story I will tell to my grandkids,” she said, gleefully.\n\nIn a sign that the star draw on Thursday was Harris, dozens of people started filing out of the gymnasium as Biden spoke, saying they wanted to beat the traffic out of the parking lot."
