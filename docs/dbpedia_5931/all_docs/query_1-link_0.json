        "text": "French public transport operator\n\nFor other uses, see RATP.\n\nThe RATP Group (French: Groupe RATP) is a French state-owned enterprise (EPIC) that operates public transport systems. Headquartered in Paris, it originally operated under the name Régie autonome des transports parisiens (English: Parisian Autonomous Transport Administration). Its logo represents, in a stylized version, the Seine's meandering through the Paris area as the face of a person looking up. The company had described itself as the fourth-largest presence in public transport.[1]\n\nRATP Group was established in 1949 with the express purpose of operating Paris' public transport system. During the twentieth century, it focused solely on the provision of the capital's various forms of transit, from the Paris Métro, Île-de-France tram, and the RATP bus network, as well as part of the regional express rail (RER) network. However, since 2002, RATP Group's operations have no longer been geographically restricted; it has competitively pursued contracts to operate transit systems around the world. It also had a partnership with, and a minority shareholding in, Transdev, which has further involved RATP Group in various global transport operations. During 2002, RATP Dev was created as the Group's dedicated international operations and maintenance subsidiary; it is present in 16 countries across Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America.\n\nRATP Group's Paris-related activities are still a major part of its business through to the present day; in 2019, it was recorded that, in the Île-de-France region, it carried roughly 3.3 billion passengers per year.[1] In 2019, RATP Group's consolidated revenue was €5.704 billion; it employed 64,000 people at that time.[1] In recent decades, the company has operated on an increasingly competitive basis as a result of legislative changes.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe RATP was created on 1 January 1949 by combining the assets of the Compagnie du Chemin de fer Métropolitain de Paris (CMP), which operated the Paris Métro, and the Société des Transports en Commun de la Région Parisienne (STCRP), which operated the city's bus system.\n\nPrior to this, the CMP had absorbed the Nord-Sud Company in 1930 and the Ligne de Sceaux in 1937, which operated commuter rail to the suburbs.[citation needed] The STCRP had been created on 1 January 1921 by the merger of about half a dozen independent bus and streetcar operators in the Paris area. By the time the STCRP was merged into the RATP, all of its streetcars had been replaced by bus routes.[citation needed]\n\nShift towards competitive operations\n\n[edit]\n\nA major change in French law came on 3 November 2009, when article 5 of the ARAF (French rail regulatory body) law came into effect. This law opens public transport operation to competition. The law was part of a broader push by the European Union to open all passenger transport operation to competition. Under this law, the RATP Group lost the exclusive right to operate all new public transport lines immediately. The company's exclusive operation rights for existing lines would expire over time, with the bus network going out to bid 15 years later in 2024, the tram network (Lines T1, T2 & T3) going out to bid 20 years later in 2029, and the Metro and RER lines out to bid 30 years later in 2039.[2]\n\nWith the RATP anticipating this shift to a competitive environment, the company began to reorganize itself.\n\nIn the early years of the 21st century, a partnership with Transdev resulted in RATP acquiring a minority shareholding in that group, with its many worldwide transport operations. However, in 2009, the Caisse des dépôts et consignations, the majority owner of the Transdev, started negotiations with Veolia to merge Transdev with Veolia Transport. As part of the resulting agreement, made in May 2010, it was agreed that RATP would take over ownership of some of Transdev's operations in lieu of cash payment for its holdings in Transdev. This gave RATP a considerable number of international operations.[3][4][5]\n\nIn 2009, RATP entered the United States by purchasing transit contractor McDonald Transit Associates.[6] McDonald operated Fort Worth Transportation Authority (now Trinity Metro) in Texas, Votran in Florida, and Waco Transit System in Texas, among others. On 1 August 2011, the RATP Group purchased Stagecoach Metrolink's contract to operate the Metrolink light rail system in Greater Manchester, England until July 2017.[7] Two years later, in 2013, RATP purchased the nearby long-established coach company, Selwyns Travel, a National Express operator.\n\nPresidents\n\n[edit]\n\nThe current president and CEO of the RATP, Jean Castex, is in office since 28 November 2022.[8]\n\nHiba Farès is the Chairman of the Board of RATP Dev since January 2022.[9]\n\nOperations in Paris\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Paris, RATP operates, under its own name, on behalf of and under contract with Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM), the Paris region transit authority. RATP's services constitute, in their own right, a multi-mode public transportation infrastructure, but also contribute to a larger multi-mode system extending out into the surrounding Île-de-France communities.\n\nRATP's services in the Greater Paris area include:\n\nThe Paris Métro, a system of mostly underground rapid transit lines which run throughout the city, with some lines extending somewhat beyond the city boundaries. The Métro has 16 lines with 226.9 km (141.0 mi) of track and 308 stations.[10][11] Three metro lines are fully automated and driverless: Line 1 (since 2012), Line 4 (since 2023) and Line 14 (since its opening in 1998).\n\nOrlyval, the automated shuttle serving Orly Airport.[12]\n\nParts of the RER, the Paris regional express rail network that runs mostly underground in the centre of Paris and overground in the rest of the region. RATP owns and operates most of lines A and B, both together representing approximately 115 km (71 mi) and 66 stations. The rest of the RER network is operated by SNCF.\n\nNine out of the fourteen lines of the Paris tram system (T1, T2, T3a, T3b, T5, T6, T7, T8, T10) totaling 109.6 km (68.1 mi) and 197 stops.[13][14][15]\n\nThe extensive Paris city bus system (351 lines with a total length of 3,861 km (2,399 mi)), including the night buses of the Noctilien network.\n\nTwo BRT lines: the Trans-Val-de-Marne (TVM, 19.7 km (12.2 mi)) and line 393 (11.7 km (7.3 mi)).\n\nThe Montmartre funicular.\n\nParis bus route 341 was RATP's first line equipped with 100% electric full-size buses (starting June 2016).[16] By early 2021, there were over 150 full battery electric buses in the fleet with a target of 1,500 by 2025.[17]\n\nOperations outside Paris\n\n[edit]\n\nRATP Dev (Dev being a contraction of Développement, French for development[18]), established in 2002 as a 100% subsidiary of the RATP Group, provides operations and maintenance of passenger transport services outside of the \"historical\" RATP network in the Greater Paris area although it also operates some specialised services within Paris. RATP Dev is present in France as well as in 15 other countries, namely Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Egypt, Hong Kong, Italy, Morocco, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
