        "text": "Yellow Buses has scooped a major international award for its work in ‘staff transport’.\n\nThe Bournemouth-based company has put into place a number of schemes and innovations to help its workforce.\n\nThese include extra bicycle racks, showers, an internal bus service to get drivers into town, and a secure room where staff can leave their motorcycle gear.\n\nYellows’ parent company RATP, which is the fifth largest urban transport operator in the world, organised the ‘environmental awards’ across the 15 countries it operates in.\n\nThe Yellows were nominated in the ‘climate, air and energy category’ of the inaugural competition.\n\nIts Operations Manager Mike Conroy travelled to the transport giant’s HQ in Paris to collect the trophy for Yellow Buses.\n\nHe said: “We are always trying to make things easier for our staff and we have introduced a number of schemes.\n\n“Individually they are small things but add up to quite a significant improvement for our staff who turn up at work at all hours of the day and night.\n\n“We now run internal bus services from our Yeomans Way HQ into town and back to help our staff get to where they need to be.\n\n“We’ve added racks for cycles and motorbikes and installed showers and a secure room where staff can lock up possessions and those who use motorbikes can store their leathers and helmets.\n\n“We won’t stop here and will continue to listen to our staff and introduce things that make life and work easier for them.”\n\nwww.bybus.co.uk\n\nNote to Editors:\n\nFor more information, please contact: Andrew Diprose, Director, Deep South Media Ltd, PR consultants to Yellow Buses, on 01202 534487. Or Ed Baker on 01202 534487 or 07788392965.\n\nAbout Yellow Buses:\n\nYellow Buses operates a fleet of 137 buses and 18 coaches with a staff of 450.

The multimodal network operated by RATP in the Paris region, with its 14 metro lines (including two driverless lines), two regional express network (RER) lines, seven tramway lines, 350 bus lines and shuttle services catering to the region’s two international airports, is the largest of its kind in the world to be managed by a single company.\n\nRATP group can devise, design and implement infrastructure development projects, operate and maintain networks irrespective of the transport mode (metro, regional train, tramway and bus) and develop innovative services to promote mobility such as passenger information, electronic ticketing, pricing and customer marketing. The automation of Paris metro’s Line 1, which was completed at the end of 2012, is a world first and once again has demonstrated the ability of RATP group to complete particularly complex projects.\n\nRATP group has a workforce of nearly 60,000 worldwide and in 2015 generated revenue of 5,556 million euros.\n\nRATP Dev:\n\nRATP Dev is RATP a group subsidiary set up in 2002 to export the Group’s operation and maintenance knowhow outside the historic network operated by RATP in the Paris region.
