        "text": "French mobility company RATP Dev, part of the RATP Group, is a pioneer of cutting-edge technology that plans to bring its expertise to the Australian market.\n\nCities around the world have begun to recognise the need to invest in sustainable transport networks. Not only to respond to the urgency of the climate crisis, but also to improve urban areas’ socio-economic standing, something that a robust and efficient public transport system can accelerate among local communities.\n\nTraditionally, transport networks, particularly private transport such as road travel, have been large emitters of greenhouse gases. In Australia, transport is the third largest emitter (18.6 per cent), behind electricity (32.9 per cent) and stationary energy (21 per cent), according to data published by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology.\n\nRATP Dev general manager for Australia and New Zealand, Denis Masure, said it’s no surprise that MPs here in Australia are debating a climate bill that would enshrine emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050.\n\n“As engines of growth for the economy, cities play a pivotal role in responding to the climate crisis by reducing emissions – especially as they produce more than 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.\n\n“This is unsurprising given cities are catalysts for industry growth and home to millions of people often densely populated in small areas who rely on transportation.\n\n“However, sustainable public transport networks offer a way to mitigate the risks associated with climate change – and many companies working in the industry are finding innovative ways of deploying cutting-edge technology that is contributing to decarbonising the sector.\n\n“Ultimately, the goal of such initiatives is to create cleaner, healthier and more affordable transport networks in cities around the world.”\n\nGovernments like Australia’s, France’s and Canada’s have begun to further invest in public transport networks in order to tackle climate change and provide the best mobility service to residents of cities, as well as boost local economies and provide tangible change for communities.\n\nIn France, the Government has invested in an automated transit network in the country’s capital region called the Grand Paris Express, which includes 68 new stations and 200 kilometres of additional tracks.\n\nSimilarly, Australia is investing an impressive $120 billion over 10 years from 2022-23 in transport infrastructure across the country. This is part of a broader strategy to reduce congestion and better connect communities.\n\nADDING VALUE TO CITIES\n\nOne of the most useful tools for cities looking to build sustainable transport networks has been automated metros, which are increasing popular in cities around the world.\n\nAs is well-known, this is because automated metros are a powerful and agile mode of transport that is best suited to an ever-changing urban environment and an important tool in reducing emissions. Automation also includes enhancing performance, high-quality customer experience and service quality across the network.\n\nMasure said not only are automated metros popular with urban residents because they offer an unparallel high-quality experience with frequency, speed, safety and access to information (real-time travel data), but they can offer social and environmental benefits as well.\n\n“For example, automated metro systems add value to communities, particularly for citizens that may have been geographically isolated prior to the establishment of new lines. Their stations can transform suburban and/or deprived areas of the periphery of cities that will reinvigorate the surrounding area. This may take the form of greater investment in housing, schooling and entertainment,” he said.\n\n“Take Line 4 of the Paris Metro – in connection with the new line 15 Grand Paris Express, it has helped to better serve the Victor Hugo eco-neighbourhood in the Bagneux area of the city. This has already helped to expand construction of new dwellings and revitalise the culture of the area.”\n\nRATP GROUP PIONEERS\n\nMasure said that companies such as RATP Dev, a subsidiary of RATP Group, the third largest international public transport operator in the world and a pioneer of the automated metro, are well positioned to support the deployment of public transport technology – particularly automated metro systems.\n\nRATP Dev began its activity in France 20 years ago, then extended its offer in other countries worldwide. The company now operates and maintains tens of thousands of kilometres of automated metro, urban-interurban-intercity train, tram and bus networks in countries around the world.\n\n“Automated metro holds the key to unlocking economic, social and environmental change in urban cities around the world. A mixture of greenfield and brownfield networks will turbocharge the development of automated metro. Local governments in cities must continue to develop their public transport capacity, and specifically, automated metro systems, in order to deliver real change to local communities,” he said.\n\n“RATP Group is known worldwide for its innovative technology. One example is its expertise in converting services to automation without disruption: for example, on the Paris Metro Line 1, the oldest and busiest line on the Paris Metro, and Metro Line 4, the second busiest line, both of which are brownfield projects.”\n\nLine 1 of the Paris Metro was created in 1900 and has been 100 per cent automatic since 2012, which is the first 100-year-old high-capacity metro line to be fully automated without operational interruption and converted to GoA4 (highest grade of automation).\n\nSimilarly, Line 4 is the second 100-year-old metro to be fully converted to GoA4. The line’s recent extension to Bagneux will be linked with the future Grand Paris Express Line 15. In turn, this will undoubtedly support the urban development of the Victor Hugo eco-neighbourhood.\n\nOne of the most unique aspects of RATP Group’s work is how it is able to work without interruption to regular service.\n\nLine 14 is being extended in stages without major disruption to regular services and passengers. While there already had been an extension north in 2020, the final extension north to Saint Denis Pleyel will be completed with the southern extension to Orly airport by 2024 – in line with the Paris Olympics.\n\nWork as part of the Grand Paris Express Project will be delivered by 2024 to expand capacity following the completion of further lines.\n\nThis project resembles the Western Sydney Airport metro project, currently underway in the city – not only because of connecting cities to airports more effectively, but also will give rise to the new Western Parkland City, a new western economic corridor contributing to strong trade, freight and logistics.\n\nParis Metro, Line 1 (Lyon station)\n\nLOOKING TO AUSTRALIA\n\nIn Australia, RATP Dev is leveraging its own work internationally, the experience of the RATP Group with the Paris Metro and 2000 in-house engineers, to roll out cutting-edge technologies in cities across the country.\n\nIn fact, the company brings 120 years of experience in metro operation and over 70 years in semi and fully automated metro (currently operating eight GoA4 lines globally) to the market.\n\nMasure said RATP Dev also has a commitment to be a partner for governments through the development of real estate projects in cities.\n\n“The company’s real estate projects are redeveloping public transport infrastructure in built-up urban areas,” he said.\n\n“This is better integrating mobility into communities. This has developed sustainable buildings, such as new neighbourhoods that have schools, housing and entertainment. RATP Group’s metro maintenance centres have been converted into buildings for public services, hanging gardens and urban agriculture.\n\n“In Australia, RATP Group offers expertise in automated metro. This will provide safe, innovative, efficient and sustainable mobility systems to cities across the country.\n\n“The company can help to create sustainable and innovative solutions for green mobility, responsible development and “more liveable cities” in Australia, which must respond to increase economic pressures utilising environmentally sustainable solutions.”\n\nSince its foundation in 2002, RATP Dev’s goal has been to develop, operate and maintain new transportation systems in France and around the world – in fact, RATP Dev is present in 14 countries on four continents around the world. This expertise has been underpinned by the know-how of the RATP Group.\n\nFundamentally, the automation of metro systems is an innovative and sustainable solution for the future. These networks contribute to the energy transition of cities by encouraging the uptake of public transport as opposed to cars and other vehicles.\n\n“Ultimately, this will accelerate the fight against climate change, respond to customers’ needs and improve socio-economic positions of citizens of cities around the world,” Masure said."
