        "text": "Contracts signed across the GCC states over the past few years could drive French transport operator RATP Dev’s global headcount by up to 50 per cent, according to Olivier Badard, senior vice-president for the firm’s Asia, Middle East and North Africa operation.\n\n“Our current backlog in the region could increase our global headcount by 50 per cent,” Badard tells MEED. “We expect comparable growth for the company’s [financial] performance.”\n\nThe firm, along with local partner Saudi Public Transport Company (Saptco), recently won the SR8.5bn ($2.27bn) contract to operate and maintain lines 1 and 2 of the Riyadh Metro.\n\nThis is the second major contract the team has signed with Arriyadh Development Authority (ADA) since 2014, when it won the $1.77bn contract to procure, operate and maintain the Riyadh bus network, which includes three bus depots and 1,000 buses.\n\nIt is also the second major urban rail contract it signed in the GCC since December, when it won, along with fellow French firm Keolis and local Hamad Group, the $3.5bn, 20-year O&M contract for the first phase of the Doha Metro and Lusail tram.\n\nBadard estimates RATP Dev’s headcount across the GCC could reach 7,000 once the three transport projects are in full operation sometime around 2020. This could take its current global headcount to around 23,000.\n\nRiyadh award\n\nThe $23bn Riyadh Metro has six lines and will extend 176.5 kilometres and have 85 stations.\n\nADA awarded the Flow consortium - comprising France’s Alstom and Italy’s Ansaldo STS and Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane - the$2.9bn O&M contract for lines 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Riyadh Metro.\n\nBadard maintains that they have exactly the same scope as the Flow Consortium for lines 1 and 2, which is to operate and maintain the entire infrastructure from the rolling stock to the signalling and telecoms systems. The main difference, Badard cites, is that they did not have to form a consortium with the rolling stock supplier to win the contract for lines 1 and 2. “We have an existing expertise… it does not mean we will not reach out to subcontractors in some cases, but this [urban rail O&M] is our DNA,” he tells MEED.\n\nPopulation doubts\n\nRiyadh’s bus network is expected to enter operations by mid-2019, several months prior to the completion of the $23bn Riyadh Metro.\n\nAlthough some doubts remain whether Riyadh’s population, known to be heavily attached to private cars, will actually adopt the public transport system once it becomes available.\n\nBadard maintains ADA’s multiple initiatives to promote the “attractiveness and opportunities” offered by the public transport network to Riyadh’s population will eventually pay off. “A lot of work is being done to ensure the bus routes are customised and completed according to the phased opening of the Riyadh metro to ensure both networks work seamlessly,” he explains.\n\nThe executive says RATP DEV also endorses recent initiatives by the ADA such as the transit oriented development (TOD) projects that aim to increase usage of the public transport network. “We are in continuous discussions [with ADA] in terms of the best way to add value … by developing real estate or retail spaces particularly in areas close to the most iconic metro stations.”\n\nFuture opportunities\n\nBadard says they are keeping their eyes open to future opportunities in Saudi Arabia, particularly with the municipal public transport operators such as Metro Jeddah Company and Mecca Mass (MMRT).\n\n“We keep an open dialogue [with them]… we understand they are still evaluating the best routes to implement their [public transport infrastructure] plans,” he adds.\n\nThe executive concludes by saying his firm is “keen to add value to Dubai’s Roads & Transport Authority (RTA)” in a clear reference to the Dubai Metro and tram, whose first five-year O&M contract was awarded in 2008 to UK-based rival Serco. The contract has since been extended to 2019."
