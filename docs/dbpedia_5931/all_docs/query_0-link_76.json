        "text": "Olivier and I, and our daughter Leyla, moved ‚Äúback‚Äù to France in 2009, after 18 years of life in the US. Leyla was 4 years old when she attended her French pre-school, and she was bilingual.\n\nHer English was much more developed than her French, and she had quite a strong American accent. Her voice pitch and intonation were American.\n\n1- Organization of Daycare in the US versus France\n\na) Private daydaycare the US\n\nLeyla had been with a nanny since she was 4 months old, part time first, then full time, allowing me to go back to work. When she was 2, we enrolled her at Creative Corners, a very dependable and outrageously expensive day care in Winchester. Creative Corners offered all kind of mentally-challenging activities, lots of arts and crafts, and had a great indoor and outdoor play area. There were up to 8 kids, 1 teacher and 2 helpers per group, 2 groups in one big common space.\n\nb) Public daycare In France\n\nWhen we moved to France in December 2008, Leyla had just turned 4 (she was born in November) and went to ‚Äúla Moyenne Section‚Äù which I believe is 2 years before Kindergarden.\n\n‚ÄúLa maternelle‚Äù starts at 3 years old and is composed of:\n\n‚Äì ‚Äúla petite section‚Äù (3 years old),\n\n‚Äì ‚Äúla moyenne section‚Äù (4 years old)\n\n‚Äì ‚Äúla grande section‚Äù (5 years old).\n\nNone of this is compulsory. Learn More about the French school system\n\nClasses run from about 8:30 AM-12 PM, with a morning break, then the option of lunch √† ‚Äúla cantine‚Äù or back at home, then 1:15 PM-4:15PM, with naps for the littlest ones and one afternoon break. Then possibly ‚Äúla garderie‚Äù which is supervised (or so it claims) play till 6:30 PM or 7 PM.\n\nThere is one teacher and one helper per class of‚Ä¶ 22 kids !!! And it gets even worse at ‚Äúla garderie‚Äù where there is one or two supervisors for all the kids of the school who need to stay after school‚Ä¶ Of course, this varies tremendously according to each school, but these numbers are far from being uncommon.\n\n2 ‚Äì Dependability of Preschools in France\n\nIn France, there is usually no school on Wednesdays (although that is in the process of changing with the new ‚Äì and very controversial ‚Äì school reforms that the current government is putting in place this year and next), and tons of vacations, holidays, long weekends, not mentioning the strikes‚Ä¶\n\nIn the US, CC was open every weekday, snow storm or shine, 7 AM to 6 PM (with flexible drop off/ pick up times within this frame)‚Ä¶ I believe they may have been closed on a couple of national Holidays, but not all of them. They would give us a schedule at the beginning of the year, and plenty of reminder ahead of time.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out my options in France since no-one seemed to care to explain the whole picture. It was amazing how even the school principal or the person in charge of the ‚Äúcommunaut√© de communes‚Äù (a government organization who is supposed to help the families integrate their community and other things which I have not figured out yet) could not give me a clear picture of what I was supposed to do with my kid when there was no school !!!\n\nI first started to look into hiring a nanny, which seemed to be the only option at that time. Oh my Goodness‚Ä¶. The nanny wanted to be ‚Äúdeclared‚Äù, so officialy she could get a pay check with the benefits, and being new to the system, I had to fill a HUGE file to get into ‚ÄúLes Allocations familiales‚Äù‚Ä¶ It was such a mess !!! I finally found someone who reluctantly accepted some cash while my file was getting processed‚Ä¶ And then, miracle, I heard of ‚Äúle centre a√©r√©‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúLe centre a√©r√©‚Äù is a government sponsored yet private center which takes your kids from 8ish in the morning till 6ish in the evening. You can enroll the kid for the full day (including lunch) or half a day. They are opened on Wednesdays, and during school vacation. They offer all kind of arts and crafts, some outings, and have a big outdoor play area (our ‚Äúcentre a√©r√©‚Äù in Paimpol is even by the beach‚Ä¶). ‚ÄúLes centres a√©r√©s‚Äù quality varies a lot from town to town, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard. You need to go every month to city hall (‚Äúla mairie‚Äù) to register your kid, and there are specific dates you need to go to enroll your kid during vacation times. All this during working hours of course, Monday-Friday, so this AGAIN is a big mess for working parents.\n\nI am lucky since both Olivier and I work at home, and Olivier‚Äôs family is always ready to help with Leyla, but I really wonder how French parents who both work and have no family nearby can cope with all the days when school is closed‚Ä¶\n\n3 ‚Äì Cost of Preschools in France\n\nIn France, public school is completely FREE (including lots of the books and basic supplies needed).\n\n‚ÄúLa cantine‚Äù and ‚Äúla garderie‚Äù are extras‚Ä¶ a whoopping max of 4 Euros a day if you were to enroll your child to lunch and maximum of after school care. And of course, you could receive government help if you needed help to pay this.\n\nFor ‚Äúle centre a√©r√©‚Äù , it‚Äôs free if you are under a certain income level. Then it varies depending on the towns, but I‚Äôd say about a max of 12 Euros for the whole day including lunch and snacks. You may have to pitch in a couple of Euros for a special day trip to a castle, or an amusement park‚Ä¶\n\nSo let‚Äôs say your kid goes to la cantine, la garderie, et le centre a√©r√© = ~112 Euros per month.\n\nIn the US, Creative Corners cost us 1,250.- USD A MONTH (in 2007) and we had to pack her lunch!\n\nNow of course, you‚Äôll note that these are public school costs but most of the private system is also incredibly ‚Äòcheap‚Äô compared to the US (and a lot of other countries). Leyla is currently in a private school and we still only pay about ‚Ç¨40/month on top of the costs above.\n\nThere is a big trend right now in the US to be a ‚Äúhome maker‚Äù: many women these days say they choose to stay home and raise their family. However the price of day care being so prohibitive, I can‚Äôt help but thinking: ‚Äúis it really a choice ??‚Äù. Or is it that women (who stay home more often than men) can‚Äôt afford to work, and stay home not because they want to, but because they cannot do anything else. And when it‚Äôs not a choice, being a home maker can be really, really difficult.\n\n4 ‚Äì Teaching Philosophy of Preschools in France\n\nWhen Leyla was at CC in Winchester, all the day‚Äôs activities were optional: Leyla could learn the alphabet, or sit quietly in a corner and draw. She could go play outside with all the kids, or stay in and read a book. Nothing was ever imposed, except a quiet time at nap time.\n\nBy the time she was barely 4, she could write her alphabet, her name and a couple of common short words, could count till 100. Teachers couldn‚Äôt stop telling us how wonderful, kind, social, intelligent and loving Leyla was :-) Leyla looooooved going to CC, she had many friends there and they even threw a party when she left and I have kept all the drawings and pictures they took that day.\n\nWhen Leyla started ‚Äúla maternelle‚Äù in ‚Äúmoyenne section‚Äù in France, the school was thrilled to have a bilingual child (read my section on how to raise a bilingual child), and Leyla had no problem adapting to speaking French all day. She seemed happy enough, her voice pitch dropped and after maybe 3 months, her French was as good as any other kid her age.\n\nOlivier was dropping her off in the morning: there was no alloted time to speak to the teacher who was welcoming all the other kids/families (with another teacher (grande section), parents were not even allowed into the classroom at all, they had to say goodbye to their kid at the door.)\n\nThen I would go pick her up at 6 at ‚Äúla garderie‚Äù.\n\nThe big surprise came at the end of the first trimester, with Leyla‚Äôs grades.\n\nWell, not exactly grades, no numbers or letter, but definitely red marks and comments on ‚Äútests‚Äù:\n\n‚Äì ‚ÄúLeyla doesn‚Äôt do what the teacher asks‚Äù\n\n‚Äì ‚ÄúLeyla takes too much time doing the exercise‚Äù\n\n‚Äì ‚ÄúLeyla is not precise enough‚Äù\n\n‚Äì ‚Äúcould do better‚Äù (already, sigh‚Ä¶.)\n\nIt was the first time I had heard the preschool gave tests. And the first time I had heard there was something wrong with Leyla‚Äôs work.\n\nThe teacher, who my husband saw every morning, never mentioned anything (was she trying to be discreet in front of the other parents ???).\n\nNeedless to try to describe how shocked we were‚Ä¶ With Leyla‚Äôs results, all the red marks, as much as with the fact that the teacher didn‚Äôt say anything to us about it!!\n\nSo we asked for an appointment with the teacher. And then she repeated the remarks: Leyla was smart enough, there was nothing wrong with her, her French level was good enough, but she didn‚Äôt seem to pay attention when there was a test, and would be reluctant to stop drawing or playing when the teacher was teaching something.\n\nAnd then it hit me‚Ä¶ Leyla didn‚Äôt KNOW what a test was.\n\nShe still operated under the ‚Äúparticipation at will‚Äù of the US!\n\nWhen I said this to the teacher, she was so surprised and didn‚Äôt even register the possibility‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhat do you mean Leyla doesn‚Äôt understand what a test is. It‚Äôs obvious! It‚Äôs school: she has to do what she is being told to do!‚Äù‚Ä¶\n\nI felt like I came from another planet!\n\nBack home, we had a quiet talk with Leyla, and explained that this was different now, that school was her ‚Äújob‚Äù, that she had to obey the teacher and pay attention to what she taught, stop playing/drawing when the teacher said so, and that there would be tests and grades, and that it was her job to get good grades at school, just like our jobs were to make money to pay for the rent and the food etc‚Ä¶\n\nLeyla understood, and from that day on, she has been a A student.\n\nNow, it pains me to say Leyla learned NOTHING more than what she already knew in the first 2 years of ‚Äúmaternelle‚Äù in France.\n\nBy the end of ‚Äúgrande section‚Äù (she was 5 1/2), she could count to 100, write her name, and knew the alphabet. Everything she already knew when she left Creative Corners. So much for matching a kid‚Äôs potential‚Ä¶\n\n5 ‚Äì Difference in School Education France Versus US\n\nAdapting to the French system was not easy. The price break was awesome, what a relief, but all the rest was‚Ä¶ quite a disappointment compared to our experience at Creative Corners.\n\nThe way the teacher treat the kids in France is VERY different‚Ä¶ They are not going to say lots of good things about your kid, and are more likely to point out the problems than the positive. If you get a ‚Äútout va bien‚Äù (all is well), then you should be happy, it means your kid is doing what‚Äôs expected, and that‚Äôs a good thing.\n\nIt‚Äôs like teachers want to keep school a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù place for the kid. They have their own life here, and parents are not on the need to know list. Maybe it builds independence? Or maybe the teachers just don‚Äôt have enough time for the parents‚Ä¶\n\nI remember going to a parent‚Äôs reunion for Leyla (I had to cancel 2 lessons to be there since it was at 4 PM, again, how do working parents cope?) and the teacher said ‚ÄúI have nothing special to tell you. Leyla is doing great, she is happy, obedient and has a good attitude in class‚Äù. That was all I could get from the teacher. Next parent‚Ä¶\n\nOne thing is certain: the French system, from the very beginning, promotes fitting in the system. And you get yelled at when you don‚Äôt. Not a great way to form future thinking out of the box, entrepreneurs or to develop originality and self-esteem‚Ä¶ I hate to think my Leyla is being raised to fit in a (shoe) box.\n\nShe is getting no glory at all from being the first in her class (she told me she asked her teacher, who looked around before telling her under big secret she had the best grades, as if it was something to be ashamed of). Is it to spare other kids feelings? Sparing kids feelings didn‚Äôt seem to be the top priority of French teachers to me‚Ä¶\n\nAnyways‚Ä¶ I wanted to share some of my experiences with you and of course, they will be different for everyone (based on the school & region) but I thought it might be an interesting perspective on this subject‚Ä¶ Let me know what you think in the comments!\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to know more about the French school system, read this article.\n\nYou may also be interested in my tips on how to raise a bilingual kid.\n\nWe are lucky that Leyla always wanted to contribute to French Today: she recited several French poems and even sang for you, and lately, she developed her own French videos to learn French ‚Äì check them out!\n\nTo learn French in context, check out French Today‚Äôs downloadable French audiobooks: French Today‚Äôs bilingual novels are recorded at different speeds and enunciation, and focus on today‚Äôs modern glided pronunciation."
