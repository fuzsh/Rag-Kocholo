        "text": "RATP Dev Transit London is one of the largest bus operators in London, running 1,065 buses and carrying some 180 million customers every year safely to their destinations.\n\nWe run 90 routes in and around the capital, mostly under contract to Transport for London (TfL), the capital’s transport authority. TfL has ‘ownership’ of all bus routes in London and awards them to bus operators through a competitive tendering process, usually for a term of seven years.\n\nWe run our bus routes from 10 operational bases. Many of our bus routes are 24-hour operations and most run seven days a week.\n\nAs well as daily commuters, our diverse customer base includes shoppers, tourists, visitors to London and people travelling to hospital appointments. Our uniformed, knowledgeable drivers are trained to recognise the special travel requirements of all customers, and this can include wheelchair users, the partially sighted, the hard of hearing and visitors to the capital who do not speak English and are lost.\n\nWe are highly supportive of ‘green’ transport solutions and look for ways of reducing the impact our operations have on the environment. With over 31% of our in-service fleet being fully electric, we have the third greatest proportion of electric buses in our fleet within the London market.\n\nWe currently operate 19 electric routes from six converted garages and we are working towards a fully electric fleet by 2030. This is in line with the Mayor of London's ambitious plans for a zero-emissions bus fleet in the capital by 2034.\n\nSUPPORTING YOUR TRANSPORTATION TO BRING US CLOSER TOGETHER."
