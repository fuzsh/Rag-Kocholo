        "text": "From a contractual standpoint, the Gautrain is overseen by the Gautrain Management Agency (GMA), which holds the contract with the Bombela Concession Company (BCC). The latter is accountable for the train system as a whole. Falling under the umbrella of the concession company, Bombela Operating Company (Pty) Ltd (BOC) is specifically responsible for the operation and maintenance of the system.\n\nAs a Level 2 BBBEE contributor, BOC demonstrates a strong commitment to local empowerment and social responsibility, in particular via robust community engagement. Moreover, the company’s in-house training programmes have contributed to the creation of employment opportunities for young people, who make up 35% of the workforce.\n\nBOC also prides itself on achieving gender balance, with a workforce that is 50% female. Notably, women are well-represented in both technical and leadership roles within the company.\n\n“Governments have the responsibility to improve the lives of their citizens, they might not always have the requisite funds or expertise to do so solely through tax collection. This makes the need for PPPs even more acute. Such effective partnerships bring about clear objectives, accompanied by rigorous measurement metrics. If you’re off track, you face penalties; if you don’t deliver, you’re held accountable. The level of accountability even extends to details like lost passenger property. “It’s really value for public money,” says Kubheka, summing up the benefits of such an approach. “The local government sets the targets, you know where the money is going, and you know what you’re paying for.”\n\nThis focus on ‘value for money’ is not just a catchphrase; it forms the essence of PPPs, making them an attractive and viable model for other African nations grappling with the complexities and funding aspects of meeting growing public transport needs. And as these partnerships prove their worth in enhancing infrastructure and service offerings, they could very well become the ‘preferred normal’ for the future of public transport across the continent.\n\nNthabiseng provides insights into what “operating and maintaining” really means for the Gautrain, South Africa’s premier public transport initiative in Gauteng. “Operating and maintaining means the everyday, every minute role of making sure the trains run on time, that the stations are clean and safe, that the travellers have a pleasant experience, and that the trains are kept in good shape,” she explains. This is a 24/7 undertaking requiring an integrated ecosystem that comprises everything from real-time mobile apps for train schedules to seamless payment options and above all a broad range of employees, from drivers to station agents. “Think of a journey you make from home to the office,” Kubheka continues, “it starts with the app for real-time info, followed by parking or bus options, and culminates in a safe, clean, and punctual train ride. All in all, we’re talking about a workforce of 500 direct and 1,600 indirect people committed to serving the public around the clock.”\n\nGoing beyond the operational aspects, Kubheka emphasises the broader vision underpinning the Gautrain initiative. “The Gautrain reflects the Gauteng province’s ambition—of modernity, effectiveness, dynamism, and environmental goals through public transit. It is one-of-its-kind in the country and serves as a showcase of what public transport could be in South Africa.”\n\nDesigned primarily with professionals and students in mind, the Gautrain is just one piece of the public transport puzzle. As Kubheka notes, “Other examples of public transport systems that our parent company, RATP Group, operates—such as in Cairo, Casablanca, or Riyadh—are designed to meet the broader needs of the population. Whether it’s to make travel easier for those who can’t afford a car or to make it faster and safer for those who can, each city we serve has its unique challenges and opportunities.”\n\nKubheka encapsulates the universality and adaptability of public transport initiatives. “Every city is different—culturally, economically, socially. Yet, whatever their specific aims may be, public transport can support them and make everyday life a bit easier for a lot of people every day.”\n\nAddressing the pressing challenges posed by rapid urbanisation in Southern Africa and beyond, BOC, backed by the seven-decade expertise of RATP, stands ready to demonstrate its capacity to meet these growing public transport needs. The company’s approach is unique; it goes beyond mere operation and maintenance of transport systems. RATP longevity and success in the field comes from a holistic involvement starting from the planning phase—working closely with government officials and considering town planning and community impact alongside technical details. Their modus operandi considers how every new station or route will affect and benefit the community around it, exemplified by their well-planned networks in cities like Paris, where every few steps give you access to a train or a bus stop.\n\nThe goal for BOC is not just to import a successful model but to adapt and integrate it, taking into account the particularities of the environment they operate in. With a proven track record and expertise, BOC is well-positioned to offer a range of effective and sustainable transport solutions that can be tailored to the unique challenges of each country. Whether it’s through the Gautrain in South Africa or their other international projects, BOC aims to be a transformative force in public transport, from the planning stages right through to operation and maintenance. Their comprehensive approach aims to create transport solutions that are not just efficient but also deeply embedded in the communities they serve.\n\nThe Bombela Operating Company (BOC) is actively gearing up for the future of the Gautrain concession. Currently in its 13th year of a 15-year operating and maintenance contract, the firm’s immediate focus is to strategically position itself for the forthcoming tender and procurement procedures that will define the post-2026 landscape.\n\nBOC’s dedication to delivering top-notch service is anticipated to give it a competitive edge as new opportunities emerge.\n\n“Regarding the period after 2026, our vision for the train system is unequivocal. We aspire to extend our role beyond the current contracts, a goal that is essential not just for the company, but critically for our workforce too. We pride ourselves on having constructed a strong team with a 50-50 gender split, which is commendable. Our team continues to benefit from the robust leadership we have assembled to guide and administer the company,” says Kubheka.\n\nIn anticipation of the next contract term, BOC is proactively investigating possible enhancements to the system. The firm is eager to incorporate innovations that have proven successful in other markets, as long as these align with the criteria set out in the upcoming Request For Proposal (RFP).\n\nThe next five years are set to be a period of significant transformation. BOC is aiming not merely to renew its contract for operating and maintaining the Gautrain, but also to broaden its reach in public transportation both locally and across the region. As a company committed to delivering daily value to the communities it serves, the potential for broadening its range of services could have a wide-ranging impact on public transportation solutions in Southern Africa."
