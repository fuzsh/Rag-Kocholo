        "text": "Template:Use dmy dates\n\nFor London United Tramways (1894 - 1933), see London United Tramways.\n\nLondon United\n\nLondon United is a bus company operating in Greater London. It is a subsidiary of the RATP Group and operates services under contract to Transport for London.\n\nTemplate:TOClimit\n\nCompany history[]\n\nLondon United was established in December 1988[1] as one of 12 operating subsidiaries of London Buses in preparation for privatisation. In November 1994 it was sold in a management buyout.\n\nThe company's name was derived from the former London United Tramways, that operated trams and trolleybuses in west and south west London until absorbed by the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933. London United adopted the former tram company's ensignia, based on the coat of arms of the City of London, as its logo.\n\nIn 1995, London United purchased the Westlink business from Stanwell Buses Limited[2] with garages in Hounslow Heath and Kingston upon Thames.\n\nIn August 1997 London United was sold to Transdev. In 2002 Transdev purchased fellow London operator London Sovereign from the Blazefield Group.[3]\n\nIn April 2006 both operations were rebranded with the Transdev name and logo, removing the London United and London Sovereign brands, although both companies continued as separate legal entities.\n\nIn November 2009 Transdev purchased NCP Challenger with seven Transport for London contracted routes, 87 buses and garages at Park Royal and Twickenham.[4] These were integrated into the London United business.\n\nMergers and demergers[]\n\nIn 2009 Transdev's majority owner, Caisse des dépôts et consignations, commenced negotiating with Veolia Environnement to merge Transdev with Veolia Transport. As part of the resulting agreement, it was agreed that the RATP Group, which had a minority shareholding in Transdev, would take over ownership of some of Transdev's operations in lieu of cash payment.\n\nThis resulted in London United transferring to the RATP Group, while London Sovereign remained with Transdev and become part of the merged Veolia Transdev group.[5][6][7][8]\n\nThis agreement took effect in March 2011, and RATP Group renamed its newly acquired business London United.[9]\n\nLivery[]\n\nLondon United had an all red livery with a light grey skirt. This was later changed to all red to comply with Transport for London requirements.\n\nBut sometimes\n\nGarages[]\n\nLondon United operates eight bus garages.\n\nFulwell (FW)[]\n\nMain article: Fulwell Bus Garage\n\nAs of 2023, Fulwell garage operates London bus routes 33, 65, 71, 216, 371, 481, K3, 24-hour routes 85 and 281, school routes 681 and night routes N33 and N65.\n\nFulwell also operate shuttle buses to and from Twickenham Stadium on behalf of the Rugby Football Union on match days.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWhen new, the Template:Convert/acre site was described as one of the finest plants in the country and was the main depot of London United Tramways with 20 covered tracks. The garage is nowadays divided into two sections, one used by London United, with an entrance off Wellington Road, and the other by Abellio London with an entrance off Stanley Road.\n\nFulwell was the first garage in London to receive trolleybuses in 1931, and together with Isleworth was the last to operate them until 1962. The last trams operated from the depot in 1935, although some of the tram tracks were, until recently, still visible in the cobbled surface of the Stanley Road entrance. The garage has never reached its capacity, even taking in much of the work from Twickenham when it closed in 1970, and in 2001 107 buses were allocated. In 1999 the garage housed 13 London Country buses after Arriva Croydon & North Surrey shut its Leatherhead garage. The buses on route 85 were operated from the forecourt with Arriva drivers. The large forecourt is at present partly used as the bus stand for route route 267.\n\nOn 5 September 2011, route 110 was transferred to this garage from Hounslow (AV) garage.\n\nOn 1 October 2011, route 290 passed to Abellio London.\n\nOn 2 March 2013, route 33 was transferred to this garage from Twickenham (NC) garage.\n\nOn 31 May 2014, route 391 was transferred to this garage from Stamford Brook (V) garage.\n\nOn 4 October 2014, route 110 was transferred to Hounslow (AV) garage from this garage.\n\nOn 8 August 2015, route 216 was transferred to Hounslow Heath (HH) garage from this garage.\n\nOn 2 July 2016, route 216 was transferred to this garage from Hounslow Heath (HH) garage, except certain trips worked off route 696 allocation.

The garage along with many others was requisitioned in the First World War. Hounslow was the subject of two firsts in 1925 and 1930 with the first pneumatic tyre buses and the original Dennis Dart allocated respectively. The garage had one problem though: the roof was too low and only open toppers and single deck vehicles could use the depot until the mid-1930s when the roof was raised.\n\nA London Transport survey in 1947 found that 92 vehicles were allocated to Hounslow, a garage with a capacity of 72. This was mainly achieved by parking buses on a plot of land behind the garage that was also used to stand vehicles terminating there on layover. The garage was rebuilt in the early 1950s and included a new bus station in front of the garage. The planned allocation was now up to 120 vehicles, although the allocation in 2002 was 127.\n\nHounslow's first one man operated double deckers were MCW Metrobuses delivered in 1982 for routes 111 and 202. With the allocation still high, Hounslow runs a number of night services on behalf of other London United garages to enable it to fit the buses into the garage. It was also the first garage in London to operate a low-floor bus with the arrival of Wright Pathfinder bodied Dennis Lance SLF in December 1993.[10]\n\nThere were plans to relocate the garage away from the town centre, and allow the expansion of the adjoining bus station. In 2005 an unsuccessful planning application for a site in Hanworth Road was lodged. This was largely due to a campaign by residents overlooking the site.\n\nIn late 2007 the bus station in front of the garage was closed for rebuilding. The overall roof was removed and the eight bus bays demolished. In their place have been built just two stands for routes 120 and route 281. The other seven routes that previously served the bus station now stand on the garage forecourt (the old bus station) but pick up passengers in the road outside. One exception was route 81, where buses ran out of service to and from the bus stand at Isleworth Fire Station however this has since been discontinued and buses again turn around in the bus station.\n\nOn 2 September 2006, London United commenced operating routes 203, 697 and 698.\n\nOn 3 May 2010, route 698 was transferred from this garage to Hounslow Heath (HH) garage.\n\nOn 4 October 2014, route 110 was transferred to this garage from Fulwell (FW) garage.\n\nOn 24 June 2017, route 120 passed to Metroline and route 419 was transferred from Shepherd's Bush (S) garage to this garage.\n\nOn 16 September 2017, route 222 passed to Metroline.\n\nOn 30 June 2018, route 419 was transferred from this garage to Fulwell (FW) garage.

Originally built as Chiswick Tram depot, it had latterly been used to operate the British Airways bus service between Heathrow Airport and the West London Air Terminal in Kensington.\n\nThe original plan was to create a temporary home for the Riverside garage buses and staff whilst that garage was re-built with a view to taking on the workload from Mortlake and Turnham Green which were to close. However this idea was changed and the garage took on the work from Turnham Green which closed and also inherited the garage code V. Following service reductions, Mortlake and Riverside closed in 1983, with some of their work moving to Stamford Brook.\n\nIn 1981 Stamford Brook took on Airbus routes A1 and A2 following the withdrawal of the existing British Airways services between Heathrow Airport and central London. These vehicles were transferred in 1994 to West Ramp (which became an outstation of V) leaving the garage with an allocation of MCW Metroriders, MCW Metrobuses, Leyland Olympians and Dennis Darts.\n\nThe garage closed in 1996 and became a store for unlicensed buses held for possible future use. In 1999 it reopened to cater for increased demand in the area. In 2001 the allocation consisted entirely of Dennis Darts.
