        "text": "ArcelorMittal is eyeing the potential acquisition of Liberty Steel France, which includes a steelmaking plant at Ascoval and rail rolling mill at Hayange, a source within the Luxembourg-headquartered company told MetalMiner.\n\n“We were interested last year, when they were available,” the source said.\n\nBids are due for assessment likely in July, the source added.\n\nEach month, MetalMiner hosts a webinar on a specific metals topic. Explore the upcoming webinars and sign up for each on the MetalMiner Events page.\n\nArcelorMittal strategy\n\nOne analyst expressed his surprise on ArcelorMittal’s interest in those plants. In February, the steelmaker announced financial results for 2020, stating that its strategy would be to focus on organic growth.\n\nArcelorMittal also rolls rails in Europe at Gijón in Spain and Luxembourg’s Rodange mill. It also does so in Poland at the Dąbrowa Górnicza and Królewska sites.\n\nThe financial difficulties that Liberty’s parent company GFG Alliance now faces could possibly allow ArcelorMittal to acquire the assets at lower prices, the analyst added.\n\nRothschild & Co (Paris) is managing sale of the assets on Liberty’s behalf, a spokesman for the steelmaking group told MetalMiner in an email.\n\nA reduction in working capital support since the collapse of Greensill Capital prompted Liberty Hayange and Ascoval up for sale, the spokesman noted.\n\n“Given the strength of the steel market and the high-quality products we produce, we remain confident that we can secure new financing,” the spokesman’s email added. “At the same time, we are taking prudent steps to explore sale options for these businesses and will be inviting interested parties to submit offers.”\n\nLiberty plans"
