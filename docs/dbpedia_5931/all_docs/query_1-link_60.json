        "text": "You can either buy single tickets or a “Pass Navigo Easy”. The pass costs €2 and allows you store up to 30 tickets on it. There is no individual name on the pass, which means it can be successively used by different users.\n\nTicket prices will increase compared to usual prices for the duration of the 2024 Olympics. The surcharge will be effective from 20 July to 8 September 2024. Single metro tickets will rise from €2.10 to €4, and a book of ten tickets from €16.90 to €32. Train and RER tickets will cost €6.\n\nTourists can opt for a Paris 2024 pass (“Passe Paris”), which will enable them to travel throughout the region for a gradually increasing rate which ranges from €16 per day to €70 per week. The pass gets cheaper the more days you purchase. The pass offers illimited access to all competition sites and \"fan zones\", as well as the two main airports of the region (Orly and Charles de Gaulle). You can purchase the pass via the forthcoming Transports Publics Paris App or online at this link: Paris 2024 Pass | Île-de-France Mobilités (iledefrance-mobilites.fr)\n\nIf you hop on a bus without a ticket, you can buy one directly from the bus driver. From the 20 July 2024, bus tickets will cost €5.\n\nGood to know: metro tickets never expire. You can therefore stock up on tickets before the price increase and use them during the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nAll the bus lines, tramway carriages and stations and RER stations in Paris are accessible for disabled people. There are a couple of plans in place to make the Olympics and Paralympics more accessible for tourists with disabilities.\n\nThe Transport Paris 2024 App:\n\nThis new app dedicated to public transportation during the Olympics integrates information regarding the accessibility of different transport methods and includes a “wheelchair user” feature which displays only select wheelchair accessible routes.\n\nThe “Navette”:\n\n200 vans will, upon reservation, transport wheelchair users to and from competition locations. These vans will depart from 8 stations:\n\nAusterlitz;\n\nGare de l’Est;\n\nGare de Lyon;\n\nGare du Nord;\n\nMontparnasse;\n\nSaint-Lazare;\n\nBercy – Bourgogne Pays d’Auvergne ;\n\nRosa Parks (RER E) in the 19th district of Paris.\n\nThe service costs €4 per person per ride, or €8 round trip.\n\nTo reserve, check the email confirmation you received after purchasing a PFR (Personne en Fauteuil Roulant) ticket from the official Olympic Games website. Click the link provided to you in the email to access the reservation portal. Reservations are compulsory and must be made more than 48 hours before the event.\n\nMore information on Paris 2024 - Practical information accessibility\n\nMetro:\n\n29 Parisian metro stations are accessible to people in a wheelchair.\n\nLine 14 is fully accessible to people with reduced mobility, from Orly airport to Saint-Denis Pleyel.\n\nYou can find lifts in service on Shared from elevators. (iledefrance-mobilites.fr)\n\nThere is a dedicated accessibility platform for Île-de-France, called INFOMOBI. It is both a call centre, available 7 days a week, from 7am to 10pm, at +33 09 70 81 83 85 (this number might be surcharged if you have a subscription with a foreign operator), and a centre providing personalised responses by email to any questions and requests for information relating to accessibility in Île-de-France.\n\nRER (Assist’enGare):\n\n100% of RER lines A and B are accessible, as well as all the train stations serving the Olympic venues.\n\nAssist'enGare provides free assistance from a designated meeting point to your spot in the train or at RER stations in Paris.\n\nTo use this service, however, it is recommended to make a reservation 3 months before the date on which you plan to travel, either:\n\nVia Internet\n\nBy phone from 8am – 8pm, at +33 09 72 72 00 92\n\nVia RogerVoice\n\nTo find an accessible itinerary from start to finish and anticipate your needs, you can use this feature from “Île-de-France Mobilités” and tick the box “Find the routes suited to passengers in a wheelchair” under “Access facilities”: Journey planner (metro, bus, tram, RER, train, bikes...)
