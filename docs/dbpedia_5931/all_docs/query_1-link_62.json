        "text": "The takeover of line 3 by RATP Dev will take effect after a mobilisation phase that will include an audit of the existing situation, recruitment, handover, assessments, training and other preparatory steps.\n\nThe National Authority for Tunnels (NAT – Government Agency under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport, and owner of the Cairo Metro network) and RATP Dev, a subsidiary of Parisian public transport operator RATP Group, have signed an agreement for the operation and maintenance for Line 3 of the Cairo Metro for a period of 15 years.\n\nThe partnership is part of the Egyptian Government’s endeavour to strengthen the role of the private sector in maximising the efficiency and quality of services provided to citizens.\n\nRATP Dev Mobility Cairo will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of Line 3 as well as the operational commissioning of future extensions of the line, which are under construction. Its prime mission will be to offer the population of Cairo ‘state-of-the-art metro services’ with commitments to higher punctuality and regularity, acclaimed customer service practices and strong asset maintenance capabilities.\n\nRATP Dev Mobility Cairo noted that it will invest in local human capital and will offer diverse job opportunities to Egyptians, with the objective of achieving at least 90 per cent localisation rate. A Mobility Training Centre will be established in Cairo to ensure proper transfer of expertise, and it will be complemented by specialised training overseas.\n\n“We are humbled by the trust that the Egyptian authorities have placed in us and honoured to participate in the development of urban transport in Greater Cairo. The metro is an important economic lever of the city. We want to make it more efficient, innovative and sustainable to improve the quality of life and mobility of Cairo’s population. RATP Dev and the entire RATP Group will mobilise the best of their knowhow and technical and human expertise to make Line 3 a world reference in terms of quality and reliability. This contract is a reflection of the long-lasting relations between Egypt and France in the transport sector,” said Laurence Batlle, Chairwoman of the Executive Board of RATP Dev."
