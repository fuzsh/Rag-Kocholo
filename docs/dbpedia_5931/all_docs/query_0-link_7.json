        "text": "Thanks to our safe, efficient and innovative mobility solutions, we share in their lives as they go about their business : going to school, studying, meeting up with friends or family, going to work, taking care of themselves… Quite simply, living.\n\nSince 1954, this commitment has been the pride of our employees.\n\nAt the request of elected in France’s metropolises, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC) support department for semi-public urban transport companies is spun off in 1989 and becomes Transcet. That same year, the transport branch of the CDC, headed by Philippe Segretain, bought Progecar, a regional group of coach transport companies.\n\nIn 1992, Transdev went international. The merger of Progecar and Transcet places the new company Transdev (Société européenne pour le développement du transport public) under the sign of Europe.\n\nCaisse des Dépôts et Consignations creates a strategic partnership with RATP, which held 25.6 % of Transdev’s capital. This merger creates a strong synergy between the two operators, enabling them to offer a complete range of transport services. RATP brings its expertise in heavy rail and the operation of major metropolitan networks. Transdev brings its knowledge of the competitive environment, its expertise in intercity road networks, tramways and light rail systems, and its expertise in bidding for tenders.\n\nThe merger between Transdev and Veolia transport became effective on March 3. The new entity Veolia Transdev is owned 50% by Véolia and 50% by the CDC. On December 6, 2011, Veolia Environnement sells its public transport activities. At the same time, Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations confirment its commitment to Veolia Transdev.\n\nIn 2006, Transdev acquired the leading Dutch operator, Connexxion, and become the fourth largest private operator in Europe.\n\nIn 10 years, the Group will have seen its turnover increase fivefold. More than half of the turnover (52%) is now generated internationally.\n\nPhilippe Segretain, on his retirement, was replaced in 2008 by Joël Lebreton. In 2009, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations and the Veolia group announced their intention to merge Transdev and Veolia Transport.\n\nIn 2013, two years after the merger with Veolia Transport, the Group decided to keep the single name of Transdev.\n\nIn order to reduce its debt, Transdev withdrew from 10 to 27 countries in which the Group is present.\n\nThe “new” Transdev is aiming for annual revenues of €6 billion, 60% of which are outside France, with four main zones : France, the Netherlands, North America/Great Britain and Asia-Pacific-Southern Europe.\n\nIn 2016, Thierry Mallet succeeded Jean-Marc Janaillac, and became Chairman and CEO of Transdev Group.\n\nOn July 29 of the same year, Veolia and Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, Transdev’s co-shareholders, reached an agreement to buy 20 % stake in the transportation company held by Veolia.\n\nThe agreement was finalized on December 21.\n\nThe same year, Transdev invests in the future, creating Transdev Systèmes Transport Autonome (STA), and developing the Maas.\n\nThe German Rethmann Group, specialized in waste treatment and logistics, buys out the shares of Véolia.\n\nThis new shareholding structure allows Transdev to accelerate its development in France and internationally.\n\nRethmann holds 34 % of the capital and Caisse des Dépôts 66 % of the shares.\n\nThe company is taking a lead in zero-emission mobility and is beginning to accelerate its efforts to offer energy mixes.\n\nThe Transdev Group has a Purpose :\n\nWe empower freedom to move every day\n\nthanks to safe, reliable and innovative solutions\n\nthat serve the common good."
