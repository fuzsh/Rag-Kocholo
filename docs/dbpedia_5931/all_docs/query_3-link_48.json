        "text": "In relation to the RATP Group (French: Groupe RATP), best known as the RATP or Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (in English: Autonomous Parisian Transportation Administration), is a state-owned public transport operator and maintainer headquartered in Paris, France. Formed in 1949, it has its origins as the city's public transport operator. Its logo represents, in a stylised version, the Seine's meandering through the Paris area as the face of a person looking up.\n\nToday, the RATP is still responsible for most of the public transport in the Greater Paris area, including the Paris Métro, Île-de-France tram and RATP Bus Network, as well as part of the regional express rail (RER) network. In the Île-de-France region, the RATP carries about 3.3 billion passengers per year.\n\nWhile RATP's Paris-related activities are still a major part of its business, its operations have extended since 2002 to include business around the globe in various modes of urban and regional transportation. RATP Dev, the Group's international operations and maintenance subsidiairy, is present in 13 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.\n\nIn 2019, the Group's consolidated revenue was 5.704 billion euros; it employs 64,000 people. The company qualfies itself as the fourth largest actor in public transport.\n\nEarlier, the CMP had absorbed the Société du Chemin de Fer Électrique Nord-Sud de Paris in 1930 and the Ligne de Sceaux in 1937, which extended commuter rail to the suburbs. The STCRP had been created on 1 January 1921 by the merger of about half a dozen independent bus and streetcar operators in the Paris area. By the time the STCRP was merged into the RATP, all of its streetcars had been replaced by bus routes.\n\nIn the early years of the 21st century, a partnership with the Transdev group resulted in RATP acquiring a minority shareholding in that group, with its many worldwide transport operations. However, in 2009, the Caisse des dépôts et consignations, the majority owner of the Transdev group, started negotiations with Veolia Environnement to merge Transdev with Veolia Transport. As part of the resulting agreement, made in May 2010, it was agreed that the RATP Group would take over ownership of some of Transdev's operations in lieu of cash payment for its holdings in Transdev. This had a considerable impact on RATP's international profile.\n\nIn 2009, RATP entered the United States by purchasing transit contractor McDonald Transit Associates. McDonald operated Fort Worth Transportation Authority (now Trinity Metro) in Texas, Votran in Florida, and Waco Transit System in Texas, among others.\n\nOn 1 August 2011, the RATP Group purchased Stagecoach Metrolink's contract to operate the Metrolink light rail system in Greater Manchester, England until July 2017. Two years later, in 2013, RATP purchased the nearby long-established coach company, Selwyns Travel, a National Express operator.\n\nThe current president and CEO of the RATP, Catherine Guillouard, was nominated on 2 August 2017. The previous RATP CEOs were Élisabeth Borne, Pierre Mongin and Anne-Marie Idrac.\n\nIn Paris, RATP operates, under its own name, on behalf of the Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM), the Paris region transit authority. RATP's services constitute, in their own right, a multi-mode public transportation infrastructure, but also contribute to a larger multi-mode system extending out into the surrounding Île-de-France communities.\n\nRATP Dev (Dev being a contraction of Développement, French for development), established in 2002 as a 100% subsidiary of the RATP Group, provides operations and maintenance of passenger transport services outside of the \"historical\" RATP network in the Greater Paris area although it also operates some specialised services within Paris. RATP Dev is present in 13 countries, namely Algeria, Egypt, China's special administrative region Hong Kong, France, Italy, Morocco, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Wholly and partly owned operations include the following:\n\nRATP Dev's presence in the United Kingdom is mainly concentrated in London with its portfolio of bus services on behalf of Transport for London. Through its three subsidiaries London United, Quality Line (acquired as Epsom Coaches in April 2012) and London Sovereign (acquired in April 2014), RATP Dev manages 1129 vehicles on 96 routes out of 10 garages, and has 3387 employees, as of 2020. Early 2021, RATP Dev announced that it is to close its Quality Line subsidiary and Epsom depot.\n\nOutside of London, RATP Dev manages, since 2011, the Air Decker, a bus service connecting Bristol Airport with Bath.\n\nRATP Dev manages touristic hop on hop off tour operations using double-decker buses: \"Paris L'OpenTour\" in Paris, The Original Tour in London (acquired in September 2014) and the Bath Bus Company in several cities in the United Kingdom (Bath, Cardiff, Eastbourne and Windsor. As of 2021 RATP Dev will add a hop on hop off circuit in Brussels, Belgium, to its network (as part of an eight-year concession granted by STIB, 12 electric vehicles).\n\n\"Slide Ealing\" is a ride sharing minibus service (microtransit) launched 12 November 2019 in London, in partnership with MOIA.\n\nSince 2013, RATP Dev, in a consortium with TPG and Pomagalski, manages the Salève cable car, in the French Alps. Ridership of the cable car has increased by 50% since 2013, notably after the introduction of shuttle buses from Annemasse and Saint-Julien-en-Genevois. The contract of the RATP Dev-led consortium has been renewed in 2019 for 12 additional years, until 2031.\n\nRATP Dev established in 2018 a \"regional office\" in Singapore for Asia-Pacific albeit not having any operational activity in the city-state. In December 2020, RATP Dev and SBS Transit announced a partnership for future rail projects in Singapore, without referencing specific commercial targets.\n\nIn September 2020 RATP Dev announces a partnership with Getlink to jointly bid under the \"Régionéo\" brand name for regional rail services in France which will gradually opened to competitive tendering.\n\nThe Paris Métro, a system of mostly underground rapid transit lines which run throughout the city, with some lines extending somewhat beyond the city boundaries. The Métro has 16 lines with 219 km (136 mi) of track and 302 stations. Two metro lines are fully automated and driverless: line 1 (since 2012) and line 14 (since its opening in 1998).\n\nOrlyval, the automated metro shuttle connecting Antony station (RER B) and Orly Airport.\n\nParts of the RER, the Paris regional express rail network that runs mostly underground in the centre of Paris and overground in the rest of the region. RATP owns and operates line A (except the Nanterre-Préfecture - Cergy-le-Haut and Nanterre-Préfecture - Poissy branches) and line B (except the part north of Gare du Nord), both together representing approximately 115 km (71 mi) and 66 stations. The rest of the RER network is operated by SNCF.\n\nEight out of ten lines of the Paris tram system (T1, T2, T3a, T3b, T5, T6, T7, T8) totalizing 101.9 km (63.3 mi) and 183 stops.\n\nThe extensive Paris city bus system (351 lines with a total length of 3,861 km (2,399 mi)), including the night buses of the Noctilien network.\n\nTwo BRT lines: the Trans-Val-de-Marne (TVM, 19.7 km (12.2 mi)) and line 393 (11.7 km (7.3 mi)).\n\nThe Montmartre funicular.\n\nFuture CDG Express, express rail link between Paris Gare de l'Est and Charles de Gaulle Airport (in the Hello Paris joint venture with Keolis)\n\nAgglobus, the urban bus network of Bourges in the Cher department (since 2011, renewed for the 2017–2022 period)\n\nCars Jacquemard, a coach operator in the Eure department\n\nCars Perrier, one of the operators of the Sqybus network serving the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines suburb near Paris\n\nThe CTRL network of Lorient Agglomération in the Morbihan department (for the 2018-2022 period)\n\nCom'Bus, Yvelines and Val-d'Oise departments\n\nThe Impulsyon urban bus network of La Roche-sur-Yon in the Vendée department (since 2010, renewed for the 2017–2023 period)\n\nThe Irigo multimodal in and around Angers including the Angers tramway (for the 2019-2025 period)\n\nThe Kicéo urban bus network of Vannes in the Morbihan department (for the 2017-2023 period)\n\nLignes de Vienne et agglomération (L'va) in and around Vienne in the Isère department (since 2011)\n\nLe Vib in Vierzon in the Cher department (since 2011, renewed in 2015 for 8 more years)\n\nThe Marinéo urban bus network of Boulogne-sur-Mer in the Pas-de-Calais department (for the 2013-2020 period)\n\nMouvéo, the urban bus network of Épernay in the Marne department (since 2016)\n\nOndéa, the urban bus network of Aix-les-Bains and its surroundings in the Savoie department (2015-2020)\n\nPAM 91, 92, 93 and 95, paratransit in the Essonne, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-d'Oise departments (Greater Paris area)\n\nThe STIVO urban bus network in Cergy-Pontoise\n\nTransports annemassiens collectifs (TAC), urban bus network covering the Agglomeration community of Annemasse – Les Voirons (joint control with TPG)\n\nTransports de l'agglomération de Charleville-Mézières (TAC), urban bus network of Charleville-Mézières and Sedan in the Ardennes department (since 2012, renewed for the 2017–2024 period)\n\nTBK bus and coach network covering Quimperlé and surroundings in the Finistère department (for the 2020-2028 period)\n\nTransports urbains laonnois (TUL), the urban bus network of Laon in the Aisne department (for the 2016-2022 period)\n\nThe Transvilles multimodal network in and around Valenciennes, including the Valenciennes tramway (since 2015)\n\nThree express coach routes using the A14 motorway, in the Greater Paris area.\n\nGautrain, regional express train in Gauteng province, South Africa, linking Johannesburg, Pretoria and O.
