        "text": "From Montreal to Sydney via Santiago, London, Paris or even Cairo and Mumbai, SYSTRA has been involved in almost 1 metro line in 2 in the world. Whether it concerns networks created from scratch or new lines, extensions or optimisations going all the way to full automation of an existing infrastructure, our urban mobility experts cover all the specificities of metro projects.\n\nThe tramway is one of the only modes of transport that offers decision-makers and public authorities the solution to a complex challenge – how to offer a transport service that is rapid, high capacity, and reliable, operates long hours, is independent from road traffic flow and as carbon neutral as possible… all at a limited roll-out cost.\n\nThe socio-economic development of cities is intrinsically linked to the ease of mobility. An efficient public transport system is one of the main structuring elements of connection between residential neighbourhoods and points of interest of the population. Thus, a high-quality public transport system is an essential element for the development of large urban centres. Modern and high-performance, BRT systems could combine the flexibility of a bus with the benefits offered by semi-dedicated or dedicated corridor transport.\n\nBig drops in level, a weak hold on the ground or even short distance travel, these questions find their answers with SYSTRA and its expertise in other urban modes such as cable cars, funiculars, monorails or even people movers.\n\nSoft mobility or active modes of transport, such as cycling, walking or electric scooters, are sustainable modes of transport that are becoming very popular in cities. The use of bicycles is growing by 10 to 15% per year in large cities. SYSTRA has established itself as a leader in the implementation of cycling projects, from the definition of strategies to the detailed design of cycling routes and post-project monitoring.\n\nFacilitating the movement of people, rail is also a major player in the transport of freight and merchandise. The construction of huge rail networks is currently underway in the Middle East and India, overcoming topographical and climatic constraints to interconnect cities, logistics hubs and free production zones. SYSTRA is contributing all its know-how, from design to site supervision and contract management.\n\nStations have become living spaces in their own right, whether they are created from scratch or renovated and fitted out. We have the expertise to manage not only passenger flows, traffic and passenger information, but also visual identity, lighting and sound. We carry out accessibility work to make it easier for people with reduced mobility to move around stations. Because a station is a living place, it is essential to make it pleasant and reassuring to facilitate the traveller’s experience.\n\nWe aim to produce an efficient design to create buildings that operate on lighter costs and fewer resources. Our approach also makes it possible to optimise the number of technical rooms while respecting availability requirements. We pursue excellence in high-performance mechanical, electrical, water and waste systems.\n\nUsing 3D modelling, we optimise structural efficiency and rapid schedule.\n\nDepot facilities and operation control centres are the hub of operations that provide services to operate passenger trains (rolling stock) safely and efficiently and where the trains can be maintained, serviced, and stored when not in use.\n\nOur operation and maintenance services are enhanced by an extensive experience in the planning, design, and construction of all major forms of transport infrastructure; and by an engineering approach that guarantees a strong interaction between the O&M provider requirements and the Design team from the early stage of the project and for the whole lifecycle of the system.\n\nBridges are a major product line for SYSTRA and a cornerstone of our technical excellence in providing safe, efficient and economical solutions.\n\nWe have a global network of excellence in bridge engineering, bringing together more than 350 large infrastructure experts based in the United States, France, Canada, India, Korea and Dubai. This is one of SYSTRA’s strengths. This unrivalled technical expertise enables us to work on all types of bridges.\n\nOur services extend to all project phases, from upstream studies to full project management in close collaboration with manufacturers, and even maintenance and independent certification.\n\nSYSTRA has designed and built underground structures all over the world in the most demanding conditions. Whether crossing dense urban areas, mountains or the sea, railway or road tunnels or underground stations, we have solid references on all types of underground structures, designing and supervising deep excavation, whatever the geological or geotechnical context, environment or purpose of the work. We also master all methods of tunnel construction, from the traditional method to drilling by tunnel boring machine, in all types of soil or rock.\n\nOur approach to transport systems integration is based on over 65 years of experience in projects around the world. SYSTRA ensures that systems are fully integrated at each stage of the project, from design to testing and commissioning. We embed advanced processes and tools, including building information modelling (BIM), which are essential in managing interfaces.\n\nThe aim of Systems Assurance is to plan all the systems aspects of engineering activities. It is an essential activity for guaranteeing that products comply with all the requirements of the transport system, including those of the FMDS (Reliability, Maintainability, Availability, Safety). Anomalies and shortcomings are thus limited during systems integration. Our global approach ensures that each sub-system demonstrates the same level of Systems Assurance, from design to implementation, to enable a safe and efficient commercial service.\n\nSignalling and telecommunication systems are essential for the safety of passengers and the performance of transport systems. Improving these systems, is the most effective way to increase passenger service and revenue, while minimising capital expenditure. Our considerable experience in enhancing control and communications systems allow transport networks to migrate to advanced systems without operational disruptions.\n\nThe choice of traction power source is a major decision for a new build project or for the migration of diesel-powered rolling stock to cleaner energy alternatives. We design the electrical architecture to ensure cost-effectiveness and a high reliability of the transport system, even in degraded mode. We pay particular attention to electromagnetic compatibility as it can potentially heavily impact the stability and the performance of the system.\n\nThe commissioning of a new or upgraded line must be prepared well in advance. We ensure operational readiness before an operator takes over the line by defining operations and performance indicators, setting resource levels and preparing the timetable. Our unique experience of operations and maintenance allow us to accompany operators to smoothly take over the running of new or existing lines.\n\nThe choice of rolling stock is the most important choice made by any operator. This essential link in the user experience, with an operating life of 30 to 40 years, represents a vital investment in the commercial success of a transport offering. It is the safety and performance of the rolling stock, as well as the quality of the maintenance equipment, that make our customers’ operations efficient and optimise the passenger experience.\n\nSYSTRA has built up a reputation for technical excellence through the successful completion of motorway projects around the world, such as in India and Brazil.\n\nWe provide design and engineering services for all types of roads and motorways.\n\nOur teams have experience of designing in accordance with various international codes.\n\nThe creation of transport hubs is accompanied by more global urban projects including new urban functions, whether residential, tertiary, retail or service. Accompanying urban development therefore requires a multi-disciplinary and comprehensive approach.\n\nThis is why SYSTRA has integrated teams of architects, town planners, landscape architects, ecologists, civil engineering, hydraulic engineering, engineering structures, building, environmental and biodiversity experts, acousticians, as well as furniture and signage designers, and also acts as a land operator.\n\nOur role is to improve railway efficiency to maximise mine profitability. Our expertise in railway engineering and technical services for the mining industry originates from experience acquired with major mining companies worldwide, thanks to our knowledge of heavy rail standards and practices. We provide reliable and cost-effective solutions during every stage of a project cycle, from preliminary planning to ongoing operations.\n\nAs an engineering company, SYSTRA supports its clients in all transport infrastructure projects, including airports and ports.\n\nOur network of experts, located in all regions of the world, can help you to design and organise airport terminals, model port terminals, carry out environmental studies or provide building expertise.\n\nPlanning today for efficient travel tomorrow is the key to the consultancy work entrusted to SYSTRA. Our network of more than 1,000 consultants is located throughout the world to deal with all your problems and provide tailor-made support.\n\nChoosing SYSTRA for the design of a project means opting for a global leader in the design of infrastructure, both railway lines and civil engineering structures. From preliminary studies and sketches to execution studies and independent review, our design departments are involved at every stage of the studies and in every field. Layout, geotechnics, earthworks, underground or overhead infrastructures, systems, but also the design of rolling stock, buildings, operating and maintenance schemes, with constant attention paid to the environment, and sustainable design and construction.\n\nSYSTRA is an expert in Project Management and Construction Supervision services. From Light Rail and Mass Transit to High Speed Lines, not to forget Conventional Rail and Exceptional Infrastructure, our Engineers have managed the delivery and supervised the construction of some of the largest and most complex transportation projects. With blended teams of Project Management and Technical experts, we tackle your challenges as a true partner, always keeping in mind the best project interests.\n\nSYSTRA is committed to the quality of the transport service offered to passengers and supports its clients throughout the testing and commissioning process. Our integration experts define the test strategy, then plan, manage and conduct the tests from the factory to the site, manage the overall tests, organise the handover of the transport system to the operator and supervise the start of commercial operation.\n\nDigital engineering is playing a crucial role in the rail transport sector to address climate change and improve the overall performance of assets. Using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and 3D modelling, engineers can optimise operations, reduce energy consumption and minimise environmental impact.\n\nTomorrow’s infrastructure is also what exists today. Indeed, the transport networks we use on a daily basis may be decades or more old. Yet the risks associated with poor asset management are real, from the design of the assets to their end of life. Taking care of existing networks and implementing good asset management is therefore a prerequisite for the development of sustainable mobility, guaranteeing the safety of users and respecting the environment.\n\nRailways have been at the heart of SYSTRA’s vocation since 1957, the year of our very first assignment: preparing the electrification of the Indian rail network. Always at the service of economic and social development, we have since been involved in all aspects of projects, both in the design and construction of new lines and in the modernisation and upgrading of existing links, meeting the highest technical standards and the most stringent environmental requirements.\n\nStations have become living spaces in their own right, whether they are created from scratch or renovated and fitted out. We have the expertise to manage not only passenger flows, traffic and passenger information, but also visual identity, lighting and sound. We carry out accessibility work to make it easier for people with reduced mobility to move around stations. Because a station is a living place, it is essential to make it pleasant and reassuring to facilitate the traveller’s experience.\n\nDepot facilities and operation control centres are the hub of operations that provide services to operate passenger trains (rolling stock) safely and efficiently and where the trains can be maintained, serviced, and stored when not in use.\n\nOur operation and maintenance services are enhanced by an extensive experience in the planning, design, and construction of all major forms of transport infrastructure; and by an engineering approach that guarantees a strong interaction between the O&M provider requirements and the Design team from the early stage of the project and for the whole lifecycle of the system.\n\nBridges are a major product line for SYSTRA and a cornerstone of our technical excellence in providing safe, efficient and economical solutions.\n\nWe have a global network of excellence in bridge engineering, bringing together more than 350 large infrastructure experts based in the United States, France, Canada, India, Korea and Dubai.
