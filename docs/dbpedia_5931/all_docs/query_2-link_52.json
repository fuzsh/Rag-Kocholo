        "text": "The C1 and 70 services in London will soon utilise only electric vehicles as the wider RATP organisation moves increasingly to electric drive\n\nRATP Dev UK and Transport for London (TfL) have agreed to convert London routes C1 and 70 to full electric operation by 2018.\n\nA total of 36 zero-emission electric buses will serve the two routes and run out of Shepherd’s Bush depot. The operator plans to implement the necessary infrastructure for charging and parking, and has future ambitions to convert the depot’s entire fleet to electric.\n\nRATP Group said it is already strongly committed to the transition to low emission vehicles through its Bus 2025 programme. The ambitious plan will see RATP run a 100% low emission bus fleet in the Paris region by 2025.\n\nElisabeth Borne, President and CEO of RATP group, welcomed this agreement with TfL Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown, during a visit to London.\n\nShe said: “RATP group is taking a clear stance as a European leader in the energy transition. In Paris, we already operate 630 hybrid buses, 55 electric buses and 140 buses using renewable gas.\n\n“We are proud to pursue these innovations on our London network and to be working alongside with TfL to build a more sustainable London. I am delighted at the progress made by our London business and look forward to working with TfL for many years to come.”\n\nTfL’s Managing Director of Surface Transport, Leon Daniels, said: “We’re delighted to be working with RATP Dev to deliver greener buses for this city.\n\n“They will help improve air quality and offer a better journey experience for customers. This is a momentous time as we help deliver the Mayor’s vision for cleaner, safer transport network.”\n\nTim Jackson, CEO of RATP Dev’s UK operations, commented: “TfL is a benchmark in terms of quality and innovation among international transport authorities and remains one of our most important customers.\n\n“Our strong relationship with TfL and the support of our parent company have allowed us to further realize our ambition to offer an innovative and sustainable mobility service to Londoners, as well as to the inhabitants of all the cities in which we operate around the world.”"
