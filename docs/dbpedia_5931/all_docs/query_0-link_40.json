Flight fees cover aircraft, flight simulation, flight instructor and FAA knowledge exam fees. VA students are responsible for FAA Certification exam fees. The training hours and fees outlined in the Auburn University Bulletin are the minimum to complete a flight lab course. Students requiring additional instruction will incur additional flight lab fees. Unexpected large changes in fuel prices may necessitate the addition of a fuel surcharge for all training airplane usage. Fuel prices are subject to change from term to term.\n\nAdmission Procedures for Freshmen\n\nFor Fall 2025 enrollment, admission to the Professional Flight degree program is a two-step process. Students must: 1) apply and be admitted to Auburn University through one of the four Early Action Decision rounds, and 2) apply and be admitted to the Professional Flight degree program through a secondary application. The Auburn University Admissions Office determines eligibility for admission to the university. Students who are denied admission to Auburn University or have a deferred decision will not be eligible to complete the secondary application. The secondary application will be evaluated on various academic, personal, and professional characteristics linked to success within the aviation industry.\n\nAdmission Procedures for External Transfer Students\n\nFor Fall 2025 enrollment, admission to the Professional Flight degree program is a two-step process.

If a student is unable to achieve this certificate, they should not incur the time and expense of all preliminary ratings. A copy of the 1st class medical certificate will be collected by the School of Aviation before a student can begin flight training at Auburn.\n\nAcademic Standards for all Enrolled Professional Flight Students\n\nProfessional Flight students must earn a grade of at least C in all courses in the major and maintain a minimum 2.70 overall GPA. The Professional Flight curriculum is designed for the progressive development of flight knowledge and skills, and students who earn less than a C will not be allowed to progress to the next course. A course where a student earns a grade less than a C may be repeated once only. Completing the repeated course successfully will allow the student to continue progressing through the Professional Flight degree curriculum. Students who earn a grade less than C in two or more Professional Flight major courses or maintain an institutional GPA below 2.70 will be required to meet with the school director and may be considered for dismissal from the program.\n\nAdvanced Credit for Pilot Certification\n\nPer the Professional Flight curriculum model, students may earn advanced placement credit for pilot certification/rating upon evidence of the FAA pilot certificate/rating at enrollment. Evidence consists of the certificate and the knowledge and skills required to exercise the flight privileges associated with the certificate. To receive advance placement credit for pilot certification/rating earned elsewhere, students must pass a 25-question general knowledge written exam administered by their assigned flight instructor and pass a proficiency flight check to Auburn University’s End-Of-Course standard for the corresponding FAA certificate/rating. To be considered for advanced placement credit, incoming students must complete their certificates/ratings before matriculation into Auburn University. Note: Ground and flight training for Private Pilot and Instrument Rating-Airplane completed at another FAA-approved Institution of Higher Learning (IHL) may be applied towards FAA R-ATP reduced hours eligibility.\n\nOrientation for Incoming Students\n\nCamp War Eagle is Auburn's two-day orientation program for incoming freshmen. On the second day, you will attend a group advising session with School of Aviation staff to plan your fall semester schedule and sign up for classes.\n\nAll transfer students are required to attend Successfully Orienting Students (SOS), Auburn’s one-day orientation program for incoming transfer students. SOS emphasizes university services, meeting with academic advisors, small group discussions on college student life led by upper-class student leaders, and class registration.\n\nIncoming Professional Flight students:\n\n1. Must bring an original birth certificate (with the raised seal), a government-issued photo identification, or current passport to Camp War Eagle/SOS. The Transportation Security Administration requires pilot schools to keep a copy on file for every student pilot.\n\n2. Must obtain a FAA 1st Class Medical Certificate before classes begin. Students will not be allowed to register for a flight block without a current medical certificate. Click here to find an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME). Be sure you carefully proof all information on your student pilot certificate before leaving the physician’s office. Click here to learn more about the FAA’s medical requirements.\n\nNote: An applicant to AU who is a non-U.S. citizen (including lawful permanent residents) must participate in the Flight Training Security Program (FTSP) and undergo a security threat assessment and receive approval from the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) when seeking flight training at AU leading to private pilot instrument rating, and multi-engine certification.\n\nStudent Life\n\nMajor coursework for the professional flight degree starts in the freshman year with ground school and flight education courses for the Private Pilot Certificate or the next certification or rating if the Private Pilot Certificate has already been attained.\n\nIn addition to flight courses, students take university core curriculum courses that promote the development of analytical and critical thinking skills, communication skills, and mathematical skills to prepare for the 21st-century workforce. Students should join a student organization such as Professional Pilots of Tomorrow, the War Eagle Flying Team, or Women in Aviation to connect with other students, alumni, and industry professionals.\n\nStudents complete additional pilot certificates and ratings in their sophomore and junior years and continue taking courses from the university’s core curriculum and an increasing number of aviation courses. Eligible students may apply to a pilot career development program. Students who fly during the summer semesters can accelerate their flight education and ratings.\n\nAs seniors, students continue to advance their flight education and ratings and work towards completing their academic coursework. Students pursue flight operations internships to build professional experience and networks as they begin the job interview process. They may consider running for an officer position in a student organization to develop leadership skills in the aviation environment. Students who have completed flight instructor certification are eligible to work as university-employed flight instructors. Graduate school is an option for those wishing to continue their education.\n\nEquipment\n\nAuburn’s flight training aircraft fleet comprises G1000-equipped Cessna 172SP Skyhawks and Piper PA-44 Seminoles. Advanced Aviation Training Devices (AATDs) include Frasca and Precision Flight Controls DCX Max flight simulators and a Flight Deck Solutions A320 Advanced Fixed-Based Procedure Trainer.\n\nAccreditation\n\nThe Professional Flight degree is accredited by Aviation Accreditation Board International (AABI), the organization responsible for academic accreditation of aviation and aerospace educational programs.\n\nStudent Achievement Data\n\nComprehensive Assessment Plan"
