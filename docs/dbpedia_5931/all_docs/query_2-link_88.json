        "text": "RATP Dev North America announced at the 2017 APTA Expo that its two subsidiaries — McDonald Transit Associates and RDMT — will operate under the RATP Dev corporate name. Rebranding of McDonald Transit and RDMT simplifies client interactions by immediately connecting clients to the parent company in North America.\n\nAcquired by RATP Dev North America in 2009, McDonald Transit Associates has more than 3,600 employees, and operates more than 1,700 revenue vehicles which have achieved more than 50 million annual revenue miles of service and more than 73 million annual passenger trips. RDMT, which is a partnership between McDonald Transit and RATP Dev North America, operates streetcars in Washington D.C. and Tucson, Arizona. The brand consolidation will benefit current bus, paratransit, rail, and streetcar riders while continuing to experience the same high-quality services they have come to expect.\n\n“This rebranding is intended to serve our clients first and foremost,” said Catherine Chardon, CEO of RATP Dev North America. “Our clients will easily be able to identify RATP Dev by a single name in all of our operational locations across North America. We will be focusing on new initiatives in Safety and Security Systems and Product Innovation for both the bus and rail divisions.”\n\nThroughout the past year, RATP Dev has been at the forefront of helping clients use cleaner diesel equipment and introduce electric, hybrid and/or CNG vehicles. True to RATP Dev’s goal of driving innovation from the ground up, the company has undertaken development and demonstration of autonomous, first mile/last mile solutions and led the charge in meeting the demand for ride share programs and solutions to offset the rising costs of paratransit services.\n\nThe executive leadership of RATP Dev North America will remain strong with both Blaine Rigler, now serving as President of RATP Dev North America Bus, and Steve Bethel, Vice President RATP Dev North America Rail working under the leadership of CEO Catherine Chardon.\n\n“This is a win-win. As we operate as one unified brand, our commitment to our clients and employees remains strong and unwavering,” stated Blaine Rigler, president of RATP Dev North America Bus. “The RATP Dev brand has such a strong reputation that it will be an anchor for serving our clients and recruiting top talent in North America. We look forward to working with our expert bus and rail teams throughout the country while aggressively recruiting highly skilled industry leaders for new operations.”\n\nVice President North America Rail, Steve Bethel added, “One brand will enable our clients to connect with RATP Dev’s world-wide expertise. We want to bring state-of-the-art rail services to cities throughout North America.”"
