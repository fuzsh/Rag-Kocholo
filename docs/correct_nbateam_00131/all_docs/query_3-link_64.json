        "text": "by Marcel Mutoni / @marcel_mutoni\n\nKevin Durant has gotten all of the pub for his performance during the World Championship, but the tourney’s best player has actually been Luis Scola. And yesterday against Brazil, Scola proved once again why he’s the top dog.\n\nThe Houston Rockets’ forward led Argentina to a thrilling 93-89 win against regional rival Brazil, pouring in 37 points and inspiring teammates with gutty, relentless play:\n\nScola, the Houston Rockets forward who came in as the tournament’s leader with 29 points per game, scored 10 of Argentina’s final 12 over the last three-plus minutes. “I know that my team is going to look for me at the end of the game,” Scola said. “It’s nothing to really think about, you just have to play your game.”\n\nPlaying without San Antonio Spurs star Manu Ginobili and the Philadelphia 76ers’ Andres Nocioni, the Argentines were in danger Tuesday of elimination before the semifinals for the first time since missing the 2000 Olympics. But Scola wouldn’t let them. “He’s so thirsty, playing basketball, never tired of running and fighting for the ball, that we’ve got to follow him,” center Fabricio Oberto said.\n\nThe man who signed Scola to a contract extension this summer, GM Daryl Morey, certainly noticed the performance: “Scola goes into video game god mode to finish off Brazil. Wow.”\n\nYour move, Kevin Durant."
