        "text": "Luis Scola accepts benching to play for winning Pacers\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — Luis Scola has not had much interaction with his new Indiana Pacers teammates yet — but he was with one of them when he learned he was traded.\n\nHe was standing next to newly signed Chris Copeland on Saturday at a clinic as part of the NBA's Basketball Without Borders Program in Scola's native Argentina when he got a tap on the shoulder telling him he needed to take a phone call.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns had traded him to the Pacers in exchange for forwards Gerald Green and Miles Plumlee and a lottery-protected first-round pick in the 2014 draft.\n\n\"We didn't get to speak after that,\" Scola said of Copeland. \"I had to get home, and six hours later, I was on a plane.\"\n\nBy Tuesday morning, Scola was in Indianapolis for his formal introduction with the Pacers, who are expecting the 6-9, 245-pounder to provide a strong offensive option off the bench.\n\n\"He's one of the smartest players this league has ever seen,\" Pacers coach Frank Vogel said. \"He's one of the savviest players ever at the power forward spot. With all his international experience, he's just a guy that really makes his teammates better and makes the offense flow.\n\n\"It's just a great addition and an upgrade for our club.\"\n\nScola spent one season in Phoenix after playing his first five in the NBA for the Houston Rockets. The Suns went 25-57 this season and figure to struggle again next season as they embark on a rebuilding project.\n\nScola will be playing for a team in a cold-weather city for the first time and joked that his first reaction was that he was going to have to buy a coat and a new wardrobe.\n\nOne of his first tweets following the trade included \"Necesito abrigo.\" Translation: I need a coat.\n\nThere was some sadness, too.\n\n\"I've got four kids (ages 7 and younger) and a family,\" he said. \"The moving part is really hard and that was my first reaction, 'Oh, my God. We've got to go through that again.' \"\n\nBut he also realizes he's joining one of the NBA's best teams. The Pacers are hoping moves to upgrade their bench — including the addition of Scola — this summer will be enough to push them to an NBA title.\n\n\"I'm 32 years old,\" Scola said. \"I don't know how many more years I'm going to play. We all know the older we are, the more you know, and we all know it's about winning. People won't care about all the numbers you have if you play on a bad team. It's all about winning. I know that. The older I am, the stronger I believe that.\"\n\nScola will have to make one major adjustment. He's been a starter in 429 of his 487 NBA games. He came off the bench 15 times last season in Phoenix, the first time he had come off the bench since his rookie season of 2007-08.\n\nBut for the Pacers, he's being counted on to back up David West.\n\n\"It's not my choice, but I am going to embrace my role,\" he said. \"It's a different role, but I think we've got a bunch of new players that can make a difference in the role they play. I will try to be one of those players.\"\n\nVogel added, \"A guy like Luis Scola can not play the entire game, come in, and make game-winning plays. You can start him, and he's going to make winning plays. He's just that kind of basketball player. I really don't have a lot of concern about that.\"\n\nScola has tasted basketball glory at Bankers Life Fieldhouse before. He played for Argentina when it beat the USA and went on to win the silver medal in the 2002 World Basketball championships there.\n\n\"I have a lot of memories here, and it was great,\" said Scola, who has played for Argentina in the past three Summer Olympics and won a gold medal in 2004. \"But it happened 11 years ago, so I'm happy for some new memories.\"\n\nCelebrating an NBA title with his teammates at the fieldhouse next June certainly would qualify as that.\n\n\"I'm not here to break anything,\" Scola said. \"I know this team has great chemistry. I am very, very happy to have an important role on a good team.\""
