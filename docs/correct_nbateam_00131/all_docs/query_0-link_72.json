        "text": "louis scola, currently in the ranks of the Phoenix Suns, is frustrated with the way the season is going. The Arizona team, which has had a slight improvement with the coaching change, is in last place in the Western Conference with a negative record of 23–54. The Argentine player assures that he does not know how they have been able to win so many games, since they do not know how to play well on the court.\n\n\"We just don't know how to play well,\" he declared. louis scola after the defeat against the Hornets. «We don't know how to play basketball and that's why we lose. Until we learn to play 48 minutes, we are not going to win games. I'm surprised we win this way. I'm also surprised we don't fix it. We saw the problem around the same week and couldn't fix it. It's very frustrating. A bad year,\" said the player of the Suns."
