        "text": "The Phoenix Suns have been awarded Luis Scola in a waiver auction after he was waived via the amnesty provision by the Houston Rockets.\n\nA player being waived under the amnesty provision goes into a waiver auction where teams blindly bid on that player. Phoenix will pay whatever amount it bid on Scola's contract for this season and picks up the remainder of the contract. The Rockets had used the amnesty clause on Scola in an effort to help clear the roster as their complete rebuild continues.\n\nTo make room for Scola the Phoenix Suns used the amnesty provision on Josh Childress who will now be subjected to a waiver auction. If no team places a bid on Childress then the Suns will be responsible for his contract but it will no longer count against the salary cap."
