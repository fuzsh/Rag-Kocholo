        "text": "The Cavaliers missed out on a golden opportunity on Sunday when the Phoenix Suns were awarded the rights to free-agent power forward Luis Scola. The Suns submitted the highest bid for the 6-foot-9, 245-pounder, who was waived by the Houston Rockets on Friday using the amnesty provision. The Cavs were reportedly one of the teams that submitted a bid, along with Dallas, Charlotte and possibly New Orleans. Teams would have had to offer at least $3.4 million in the first year and about $10.1 million over three years. The 32-year-old averaged 15.5 points and 6.5 rebounds last year. Scola would have been a major asset to the Cavs, who wouldn’t have been able to trade him until next summer. If they had claimed him, they might have stepped up their attempt to trade forward/center Anderson Varejao. What wall? Cavs point guard Kyrie Irving, who fractured a bone in his right hand on Saturday in Las Vegas, disputed a statement in the team’s news release. The release said Irving was injured when he slapped a padded wall at the gym where the Cavs had practiced. On his Twitter page, Irving said, “I didn’t punch the wall…at all … Not even my character.” Regardless of how Irving was injured, he’s expected to be sidelined 6 to 8 weeks and have surgery in the near future. The Cavs expect him to be ready for training camp. Flynn workout Agent Rich Paul confirmed a media report that the Cavs are scheduled to work out free-agent point guard Jonny Flynn on Monday in Las Vegas. The Cavs might be interested in signing the 6-foot, 185-pounder to be their backup point guard. The 23-year-old averaged 4.5 points and 3.3 assists in 29 games for Houston and Portland last season. Bynum rumors end Rumors died down about Los Angeles Lakers center Andrew Bynum coming to the Cavs in a three-team trade. Orlando would have dealt Dwight Howard to the Lakers in the rumored scenario. The Magic would have gotten prospects and draft picks. It was the second major trade rumor in a week that involved the Cavs that might not have had much merit. The Cavs were also linked to a rumored blockbuster involving Howard in which the All-Star center would have been traded to the Brooklyn Nets. That trade possibility was negated when the Nets re-signed center Brook Lopez to a maximum contract.\n\nOriginally Published: July 15, 2012 at 8:43 a.m."
