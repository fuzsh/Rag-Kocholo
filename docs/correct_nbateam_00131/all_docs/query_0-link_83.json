        "text": "The Brooklyn Nets reportedly agreed to a one-year deal with Luis Scola. The veteran big man played last season in Toronto.\n\nAfter missing out on a few restricted free agents, including Portland Trailblazers’ Allen Crabbe, and Miami Heat’s Tyler Johnson, the Brooklyn Nets were still able to add some quality role players that can provide some minutes off the bench.\n\nJust a few days ago, Brooklyn added guard Greivis Vasquez, who is also a veteran that can help mentor some of the young guards on the roster including Jeremy Lin and Sean Kilpatrick.\n\nEarly Tuesday afternoon, sources indicated the Nets have indeed added another veteran in Luis Scola.\n\nScola, has spent significant time overseas in Argentina and Spain, but also with the Houston Rockets, Indiana Pacers, Toronto Raptors, and Phoenix Suns.\n\nAt the age of 36, Scola is still a productive big man to bring some energy off the bench and give Brook Lopez a rest from time to time. He isn’t a signing for the future, but for now adds another body to a frontline that has taken a step back, and will provide some veteran leadership in the locker room for the Nets this season.\n\nGetting Scola for a bargain for the upcoming year helps Brooklyn for free agency next off-season since it seems scheduled to increase even more. Once again, general manager Sean Marks is making smart business decisions that will benefit this franchise moving forward."
