        "text": "The Phoenix Suns have reportedly added another former member of the Houston Rockets.\n\nNot long after the Suns agreed to terms with former Rockets point guard Goran Dragic, general manager Lance Blanks made a move for Luis Scola, who was recently amnestied by Houston.\n\nThe news comes from ESPN's Brian Windhorst:\n\nLuis Scola has been awarded to the Phoenix Suns via amnesty waiver claim, source tells ESPN\n\nâ€” Brian Windhorst (@WindhorstESPN) July 15, 2012\n\nLet's take a closer look at this newest development.\n\nWhat it Means\n\nThe Suns now have a legitimate power forward to put next to rising center Marcin Gortat.\n\nThe 32-year-old Scola took a step back in 2011-12 during his fifth year with the Rockets, as he averaged 15.5 points and 6.4 rebounds per game, his least productive season since 2008-09.\n\nNonetheless, 15 points on 50 percent shooting to go along with six rebounds per contest is nothing to shrug at. Scola has some of the best footwork of anyone in the league, and he's used to playing with Dragic, who will run the point for Phoenix.\n\nScola was definitely over-payed in Houston, but he certainly wasn't someone who belonged on the amnesty wire, and Phoenix made that clear with this quick pickup.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nThe Suns' starting lineup for 2012-13 is beginning to take shape.\n\nDragic and Jared Dudley will run the guard positions while Scola and Marcin Gortat will be inserted at the 4 and 5. The small forward position is still unclear, with Michael Beasley and others competing for the spot.\n\nWhile the Suns are still likely a fringe playoff team, this addition makes them much better on the offensive end and gives them solid frontcourt depth.\n\nOn the flip side, this could mean less minutes for second-year player Markieff Morris, who showed flashes of brilliance during his rookie season, putting up 7.4 points and 4.7 rebounds in under 20 minutes per contest.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Phoenix's rotation plays out with Scola now reportedly in the mix."
