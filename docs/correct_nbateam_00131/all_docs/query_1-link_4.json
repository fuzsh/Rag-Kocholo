        "text": "The Indiana Pacers have agreed to send Miles Plumlee, Gerald Green and a 2014 first-round draft pick to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for forward Luis Scola, a person with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal had not yet been announced. The addition of Scola should make Indiana even more of a threat to the Miami Heat's throne, as he will add frontcourt scoring to a group that consistently struggled on the offensive end.\n\nAfter pushing the Heat to seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pacers re-signed forward David West to a three-year, $36 million deal and will now pair him with Scola.\n\nMORE:Twitter reaction to Pacers’ pickup of Luis Scola\n\n\"Luis will be a very important asset to our team and to our bench,\" said Pacers President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird. \"He has NBA experience, international experience and is the type of player that will fit in nicely on our roster. I want to thank Gerald and Miles for their contributions. They had tough years last season, but worked hard, never complained and contributed to the great chemistry our team had. I think Gerald and Miles will be solid additions in Phoenix and we wish them well.\"\n\nThe 33-year-old from Argentina has averaged 14.2 points and 6.6 per game in his six seasons. He averaged 12.8 points per game last season for the Suns, though his shooting percentage (47.2%) was a career low.\n\n\"I'm very, very excited to play for the Pacers,\" said Scola. \"They are one of the top three teams in the NBA with a good shot to win a championship. I think it's a great team and this is a great opportunity. I can't wait.\"\n\nThe Suns, meanwhile, their third first-round pick of the 2014 draft (the pick from the Pacers is lottery protected). Phoenix went just 25-57 last season, but hired general manager Ryan McDonough away from the Boston Celtics this summer and has since embarked on an aggressive rebuild.\n\nThe 27-year-old Green averaged seven points per game and shot 36.6% from the field last season in 60 games for the Pacers, and Plumlee – who was drafted 26th overall out of Duke in 2012 – played in 14 games"
