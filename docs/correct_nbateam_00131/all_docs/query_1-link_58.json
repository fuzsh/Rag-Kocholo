        "text": "Luis Scola could be headed to the Pacers as trade talks between Indiana and the Phoenix Suns have become 'serious', according to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports. The 33-year old Scola would add a front court scorer to Indiana's bench.\n\nThe veteran power forward averaged 12.8 points and 6.6 rebounds per game on 47.2 percent shooting in his first season with the Suns last year. Scola spent the first five seasons of his NBA career with the Houston Rockets before he was amnestied a year ago to make room for James Harden.\n\nThe Pacers' shaky bench was an issue throughout the team's impressive playoff run, but it's something Indiana has sought to resolve this offseason. The Pacers have already replaced D.J. Augustin with C.J. Watson and signed Knicks wing Chris Copeland as an additional scorer. Scola would seem to fit in perfectly with the recently re-signed David West to give Indiana a strong power forward combination.\n\nIf the rumored trade goes through and one tosses in Danny Granger's return from injury, the Pacers seem to have improved on the group that pushed the eventual champion Miami Heat to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• Kenny Anderson reveals being sexually abused\n\n• The Dwight Howard Effect\n\n• Ziller: Why extending DeMarcus Cousins isn’t a risk\n\n• LBJ likely done with Team USA | Best (and worst) Olympic moments"
