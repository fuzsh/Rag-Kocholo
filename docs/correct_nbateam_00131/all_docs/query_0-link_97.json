        "text": "NBA Regular Season 2012-2013, Game 72:\n\nPhoenix Suns 88 at Utah Jazz 103\n\nEnter the Dragic?\n\n.\n\nThe Basics:\n\nWell, Enes Kanter got tangled up with Hamed Haddadi early in the game and left with a subluxed / dislocated shoulder and did not return. That's when at least half a dozen women turned off the game. (Really? How big is Kanter's harem at this stage? I can do what I want, I'm Enes Kanter Babbe. Have a nice life.) Goran Dragic did not play in this game -- isn't this making sure we win. The Suns want the Lakers lotto pick, and if the Jazz get in the playoffs, the Suns get it. This game was a little fishy in that regard, but hey, it's not like the Suns are tanking.\n\nAnyway, getting to the game . . . I only saw the first half but please feel free to fill me in on all the details I missed. From what I did see, there wasn't much in the way of defense. Both teams started off making at least 9 of their first 10-12 shots. Speaking of shots (no, not Randy Foye's \"gastric distress\"), Luis Scola took 18 of them, and Wesley Johnson too 16. That ended up being 44.7% of all the FGA the Suns took. Yikes. They both finished with over 20 points, but managed only 2 assists total. Hog the ball much?\n\nOn the Jazz side of things we had a matching 25 points from Al Jefferson and Gordon Hayward. Al finished with 25 and 9, with 2 steals, 2 blocks, and 1 assist. He also shot the ball 23 times to get 25 points and went to the line once all game against an undersized team. Hayward had 25, 6 assists, 5 rebounds, 3 made threes, and shot 60 fg%. Mo Williams missed a double double by a single bucket, finishing with 8 and 10, as he was doing point guard things today. The other two starters (Paul Millsap and Randy Foye) finished with 12 points each, Foye is shooting better (and less frequently), who knows is there's a relationship there? He also continues to do good things besides shooting as he had 3 assists, 3 rebounds, and 2 steals. Millsap added 4 rebounds, 2 steals, 2 assists, and 1 block.\n\nAll in all our starters looked really good on the boxscore against a lotto team playing without two starters right now, one of whom was healthy but sat.\n\nI felt like Derrick Favors and Marvin Williams had good games as well.\n\nTwo in a row baby! And Enes will have an MRI tomorrow and we'll find out more about his injury then."
