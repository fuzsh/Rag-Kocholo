        "text": "Daryl Morey is always trying to make a play. From what I can gather, everyone in Houston is on the table. Everyone. It’s a good strategy. I don’t think the Rockets are married to moving up. Nor are they married to getting vets. They’re just looking for the best possible deal. I wouldn’t be shocked to see Kevin Martin or Luis Scola moved. If they keep 14, look for them to try to add a center or point guard. Bismack Biyombo, Nikola Vucevic and Jimmer are options there. If they move up, I agree that Valanciunas could be the guy.\n\nBuchanan compares Freeland’s situation to that of Luis Scola, who enjoyed several successful seasons in Europe before joining the Houston Rockets three seasons ago at age 27. Freeland, 24, did not start playing basketball until he was a teenager and has made gradual improvement since the Blazers drafted him with the 30th pick in 2006. He had his best season in 2010-11, averaging 13.2 points and 6.1 rebounds, and another season in the ACB League can only help. “Next summer we’ll take a really hard look at bringing him over,” Buchanan said. “He’ll be 25 and starting to enter the prime of career and will have another high-level European season under his belt. Next summer, we’ll have serious discussions about it.”\n\nThe Rockets are saying Scola isn’t available, but I wonder if that will change. They also expect to re-sign Yao, which is a very risky move. If they’re re-signing Yao it makes sense to keep Scola as part of your veteran core. If Yao gets hurt again, Scola should be on his way out shortly thereafter. Plenty of playoff teams would love to have him, and the Rockets don’t look like a playoff team without Yao or Battier in the mix. I know the Rockets like the Morris twins, and they would definitely like to move up. Don’t be surprised if they make an unconventional pick, though . . .if they drafted a point guard it wouldn’t surprise me at all, even though they don’t need one. That’s Daryl Morey’s M.O.\n\nArgentina’s basketball player Luis Scola on Monday confirmed that he will travel to China later this week while expressing hope he will be fully recovered from a knee injury before the pre-Olympics Mar del Plata tournament in August, local press reported. Scola, who plays in the NBA Houston Rockets and won gold in the Athens Olympics 2004, said he is hopeful that he will be fit to play in the upcoming tournament. Scola’s visit to China is part of a trip that seeks to promote the sport in several cities across China.\n\nHouston Rockets forward Luis Scola has had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and is expected to recover in time for training camp. The 6-foot-9 Scola was Houston’s leading rebounder at 8.2 per game and second-leading scorer at 18.3 points per game this past season. The Rockets finished 43-39 and missed the playoffs."
