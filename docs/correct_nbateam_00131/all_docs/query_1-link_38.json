        "text": "Coach Alvin Gentry told me that the main post option was Luis Scola. You, on the other hand, are number one on defense. Marcin Gortat: Unfortunately… I’ve been doing the dirty work all my life, and now I have to come back to that. I will fight for what’s mine. I’ll try to prove to the coach that I can play an important role in the offence. Unfortunately, I don’t think I’m even an option for Gentry. He doesn’t even take me into consideration. The situation is critical. We’re playing the same thing we’ve been playing last year, but the truth is we have a completely different set of players. I don’t think it really works. I can’t get frustrated now though, I have to stay positive.\n\n“Obviously, it’s helping me,” Scola said of Dragic. “But two don’t make a team. Everybody needs to know each other and what we do, we’re struggling a little bit in the process, but we still have to find a way to win basketball games. “We need to start building. We’re not there right now. I think we have good players; we can play. We showed we can play… We got to get in our heads and figure out how to… We know it’s going to take some time, so we need to learn to do that while being effective. Because if not, it’s not only going to be a bad year, it’s going to be a long year.”\n\nAs Arizona Sports 620’s Craig Grialou reported Tuesday afternoon, Morris and Scola were involved in an-court confrontation which led to some pushing and shoving, as well a few choice words shared between the two. Jared Dudley — the longest-tenured player on the active roster — was asked about the altercation and didn’t seem too displeased with its timing or the fact that it happened for all to see. “Me personally, I don’t mind it,” Dudley told Arizona Sports 620’s Doug & Wolf Tuesday. “The only reason I don’t mind it is because it happens when you battle against someone.”\n\nNow they must get his head and his heart in Phoenix. Scola has done the former, immersing himself in his team and moving his family to the Valley. The latter is a work in progress for a 32-year-old who had never switched teams in the NBA (five years in Houston) or Euroleague (seven years with Tau Ceramica). “I’m happy to be here,” Scola said. “I feel like they wanted me here. It’s a good place. We have a good team. Life goes right with whatever happens on the court. Whatever happens in the season will determine if I’m happy or not. As of now, I’m very happy. Hopefully, I play well, we win games and this is a great place. I’m very optimistic.”\n\nDuring many phone calls this summer, Scola, now a Phoenix Suns forward, gave positive feedback. He promised Prigioni he would enjoy the adventure. Prigioni, now a 35-year-old rookie with the Knicks, knows he is here in large part because of Scola. “I have a lot of respect for him both as a person and a player,” said Prigioni, who is the oldest N.B.A. rookie in the last 40 years, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. “He really wanted me to make the jump, and I appreciated that.”"
