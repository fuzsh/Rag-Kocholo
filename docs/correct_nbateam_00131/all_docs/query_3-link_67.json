        "text": "Ferro Carril Oeste (1995–1998)\n\nScola started his career with the Buenos Aires youth teams of Ferro Carril Oeste. He made his professional debut with the same club's pro team in the Argentine league during the 1995–96 season, at the age of 15.\n\nCabitel Gijón (1998–2000)\n\nAfter the 1997–98 basketball season in the Argentine League, Scola moved to Spain and signed with Saski Baskonia. He was loaned to Gijón Baloncesto, where he helped the then Spanish League Second Division club achieve promotion to the Spanish League First Division. He then was loaned back to Gijón through the 1999–2000 season, before arriving at Baskonia, where he played for seven seasons.\n\nTau Ceramica (1998–2007)\n\nWith Saski Baskonia, Scola reached the EuroLeague Finals in the 2000–01 season, and three consecutive EuroLeague Final Fours, between 2005 and 2007. His outstanding performances earned him an All-EuroLeague Second Team selection in 2005, as well as two All-EuroLeague First Team selections in 2006 and 2007.\n\nAlthough Scola did not win the EuroLeague championship with Baskonia, he did win with them every major Spanish League title, winning a Spanish ACB League championship in 2002, three Spanish King's Cups in 2002, 2004, 2006, and three Spanish Supercups in 2005, 2006, 2007.\n\nNBA\n\nIn the summer of 2005, the San Antonio Spurs of the NBA (who drafted Scola in 2002), attempted to negotiate with Baskonia to buy out his contract. After throwing around numbers as large as US$15 million, Baskonia settled on a number of over $3 million for the buyout of the contract. This made it difficult for Scola to join fellow Argentina national team member Manu Ginóbili in San Antonio, because of the NBA's rule which limits teams to paying no more than $500,000 of a player's buyout. Scola would have been responsible for paying Baskonia the remaining $2.5 million amount of the buyout. When the deal to buy out Scola's contract fell through, the Spurs instead signed an Argentine national team teammate and friend of Scola's, Fabricio Oberto.\n\nHouston Rockets (2007–2012)\n\nOn July 12, 2007, the Spurs traded the rights to Scola, along with center-forward Jackie Butler, to the Houston Rockets, in return for Vassilis Spanoulis, a future second-round draft pick, and cash considerations. He signed with the Rockets soon after and his sticky buyout situation was resolved a few days later. Scola signed a three-year contract with the Rockets, at a salary of $9.5 million. Scola placed third in the NBA 2007–08 Rookie of the Year Award voting and he was also named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. On March 13, 2010, he scored a career high 44 points against the New Jersey Nets.\n\nOn the afternoon of December 8, 2011, the day before the 2011 NBA lockout ended and players could move between teams, the Rockets, the Los Angeles Lakers and the New Orleans Hornets agreed to a trade that would have sent Scola, along with Goran Dragić, Kevin Martin, and Lamar Odom to the Hornets. In exchange, the Rockets would have received Pau Gasol, and the Lakers would have received star point guard Chris Paul. That night, after other team owners voiced their opposition, league commissioner David Stern nullified the trade.\n\nOn July 13, 2012, he was waived by the Rockets using the league's amnesty clause to provide salary cap relief. It was widely noted, however, that Scola was not cut due to a lack of performance; rather, the deal was an attempt to clear cap space for the Rockets to trade for former Orlando Magic All-Star center Dwight Howard. Howard was instead traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the Rockets used their cap space to gain former Oklahoma City Thunder Sixth Man of the Year shooting guard and Olympic gold medalist James Harden.\n\nPhoenix Suns (2012–2013)\n\nOn July 15, 2012, Scola was claimed off amnesty waivers by the Phoenix Suns. Reportedly, the Dallas Mavericks and the Cleveland Cavaliers were also interested in acquiring Scola during the amnesty process. On November 21, 2012, Scola was relegated to playing off the bench for the first time in his NBA career since the start of his rookie season. He regained his starting spot less than a month later, and on December 29, he scored a season-high 33 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves. While Scola did become a leader for the Suns, he finished the season with declining averages, as his 12.8 points per game were his lowest since the 2008–09 season.\n\nIndiana Pacers (2013–2015)\n\nOn July 27, 2013, the Suns traded Scola to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Gerald Green, Miles Plumlee, and a future second round draft pick. In his two seasons for the Pacers, Scola played a back-up power forward role to David West as he started just 18 games over his two-year stint.\n\nToronto Raptors (2015–2016)\n\nOn July 15, 2015, Scola signed with the Toronto Raptors. He made his debut for the Raptors in their season opener on October 28, recording eight rebounds while taking no field goal attempts in a 106–99 win over the Indiana Pacers. He helped the Raptors make the Eastern Conference Finals in 2016 for the first time in franchise history.\n\nBrooklyn Nets (2016–2017)\n\nOn July 13, 2016, Scola signed with the Brooklyn Nets. He made his debut for the Nets in their season opener on October 26, scoring eight points in a 122–117 loss to the Boston Celtics. On February 27, 2017, he was waived by the Nets.\n\nShanxi Brave Dragons (2017–present)\n\nOn July 9, 2017, Scola signed with the Shanxi Brave Dragons of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nArgentina national team\n\nWith Argentina's junior national teams, Scola won the gold medal at the 1995 South American Cadet Championship, the gold medal at the 1996 South American Junior Championship, the gold medal at the 2000 FIBA Americas Under-20 Championship, and the bronze medal at the 2001 FIBA Under-21 World Cup.\n\nAs a member of the senior Argentina national team, Scola has won several medals: the silver medal at the 1999 South American Championship, the bronze medal at the 1999 FIBA Americas Championship, the gold medal at the 2001 FIBA Americas Championship, the silver medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship, the silver medal at the 2003 FIBA Americas Championship, the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games, the silver medal at the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, the bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, the bronze medal at the 2009 FIBA Americas Championship, the gold medal at the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship and the bronze medal at the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship among other titles. At the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship tournament, Scola became the all-time leading scorer in FIBA AmeriCup history, and won his 4th tournament MVP.\n\nScola broke two records of the Argentina national team at the FIBA World Cup, during the 2010 edition: top overall scorer for Argentina at a World Cup (beating Ernesto Gehrmann's 331 points) and most points scored for Argentina in one game at a World Cup (scoring 37 against Brazil in the round of 16, therefore beating Alberto Desimone's 35 points scored against Mexico in 1963).\n\nClub level\n\nSpanish League Champion: (2002)\n\n3x Spanish King's Cup Winner: (2002, 2004, 2006)\n\n3x Spanish Supercup Winner: (2005, 2006, 2007)\n\nArgentina national team\n\n1995 South American Cadet Championship: Gold\n\n1996 South American Junior Championship: Gold\n\n1999 South American Championship: Silver\n\n1999 FIBA Americas Championship: Bronze\n\n2000 FIBA Americas Under-20 Championship: Gold\n\n2001 FIBA Under-21 World Cup: Bronze\n\n2001 FIBA Americas Championship: Gold\n\n2002 FIBA World Championship: Silver\n\n2003 FIBA Americas Championship: Silver\n\n2004 Summer Olympic Games: Gold\n\n2007 FIBA Americas Championship: Silver\n\n2008 FIBA Diamond Ball: Gold\n\n2008 Summer Olympic Games: Bronze\n\n2009 FIBA Americas Championship: Bronze\n\n2011 FIBA Americas Championship: Gold\n\n2013 FIBA Americas Championship: Bronze\n\n2015 FIBA Americas Championship: Silver\n\n2017 FIBA AmeriCup: Silver\n\nClub level\n\nSpanish League: Rookie of the Year (2000)\n\nSpanish Supercup: MVP (2005)\n\nAll-EuroLeague Second Team: (2005)\n\n2× Spanish League MVP: (2005, 2007)\n\n2× All-EuroLeague First Team: (2006, 2007)\n\nNBA All-Rookie First Team: (2008)\n\n2016 NBA Atlantic Division Sportsmanship Award\n\nArgentina national team\n\n2000 FIBA Americas Under-20 Championship: MVP\n\n2001 FIBA Under-21 World Cup: All-Tournament Team\n\n2007 FIBA Americas Championship: MVP\n\n2009 FIBA Americas Championship: MVP\n\n2010 FIBA World Championship: All-Tournament Team\n\n2011 FIBA Americas Championship: All-Tournament Team & MVP\n\n2013 FIBA Americas Championship: All-Tournament Team\n\n2015 FIBA Americas Championship: All-Tournament Team & MVP\n\nCareer statistics\n\nNote: The EuroLeague is not the only competition in which the player participated for the team during the season.
