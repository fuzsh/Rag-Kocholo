        "text": "Amid the DeAndre Jordan drama Wednesday night, the Toronto Raptors added to their own frontcourt by signing power forward Luis Scola.\n\nThe six-foot-nine Argentinian, who played for the Indiana Pacers this past season, announced on Twitter he would be heading north.\n\nScola averaged 9.7 points and 6.5 rebounds per game with the Pacers this past season.\n\nThe Raptors have called news conferences for 10 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. ET Thursday when president and general manager Masai Ujiri will make what the team calls major announcements.\n\nThe 35-year-old Scola has previous played for the Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets, and was drafted by the San Antonio Spurs in the second round of the 2002 draft.\n\nScola won a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics with Argentina, while winning a bronze in the 2008 Beijing Games. Even though he was drafted in 2002, he didn't start his NBA career until the 2007-2008 season with the Rockets\n\nToronto's big catch in free agency was forward DeMarre Carroll, who the Raptors lured away from Atlanta.\n\nCanadian Cory Joseph of Pickering, Ont., announced on Sunday he would also be joining Toronto."
