        "text": "Scola catches the ball at the high post guarded by Taj Gibson. He does a dribble hand off with Goran Dragic who is guarded by Nate Robinson.\n\nAfter the handoff, Scola sets a screen on Robinson. Dragic uses the screen and dribbles toward the corner. Gibson stays with Dragic, and Robinson fights over Scola's pick.\n\nDragic passes out of the oncoming double team to a wide open Scola, who buries the 18-foot jumper.\n\nThe Suns come out in a double high post set with Gortat and Scola at the elbows. Tucker and Brown start the play in the corners. Dragic initiates with a pass to Scola then cuts down the middle of the lane. Gortat pivots and moves toward Brown in the corner.\n\nGortat sets a screen on Rip Hamilton and Brown cuts to the wing. At the same time, Dragic sets a screen on Taj Gibson.\n\nGortat rolls to the middle of the key. Scola hits him with a pass from the high post. Gortat catches with only Kirk Hinrich between him and the hoop. He scores easily.\n\nThe Suns come out in double high post again. Dragic dribbles at Scola who vacates his position and cuts toward the hoop. Gortat comes out to set a pick on Russell Westbrook.\n\nDragic uses the screen and dribbles back to his left. Hasheem Thabeet goes with Dragic to prevent penetration. Scola cuts toward the elbow.\n\nDragic passes to Scola at the elbow. Gortat rolls down the lane.\n\nSefalosha slides into the paint to help on Gortat who is rolling freely to the basket. Brown cuts from the corner to the wing and catches a pass from Scola. Brown nails the wide-open three."
