The Rockets waived Luis Scola so they could clear space for Dwight Howard, and it looks like the Phoenix Suns have taken full advantage, winning the amnesty auction and picking up the power forward for the next few seasons. Per ESPN: “The Phoenix Suns have won the amnesty auction for former Houston Rockets forward Luis Scola, according to sources with knowledge of the auction outcome. The NBA’s 30 teams were notified shortly after 5 p.m. ET on Sunday that the Suns won the blind bidding for Scola, which requires interested teams under the salary cap to bid no less than $3 million for this season and $10-plus million for the next three seasons. It was not immediately known how many teams placed bids on Scola beyond the Suns and the Dallas Mavericks.”
