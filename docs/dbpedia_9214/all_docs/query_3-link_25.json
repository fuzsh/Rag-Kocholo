        "text": "The Hungarian Forint (HUF) is the official currency of Hungary, a landlocked country located in Central Europe.\n\nThe Hungarian Forint was introduced in 1946, replacing the Hungarian Pengő at a rate of 1 Forint to 400 octillion Pengő.\n\nThe Magyar Nemzeti Bank (Hungarian National Bank) is responsible for issuing and managing the Hungarian Forint.\n\nExchange Rate System\n\nThe Hungarian Forint operates under a floating exchange rate system, where its value relative to other currencies is determined by market forces, such as supply and demand.\n\nThe Magyar Nemzeti Bank may intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary to maintain stability or prevent excessive fluctuations.\n\nThis system allows the Hungarian Forint to respond to external shocks and changes in global market conditions while maintaining a certain level of stability.\n\nSubdivisions and Denominations\n\nThe Hungarian Forint is subdivided into 100 smaller units called fillér; however, fillér coins are no longer in circulation.\n\nCoins are issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 Forints.\n\nBanknotes are available in denominations of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 Forints.\n\nEconomy and Challenges\n\nHungary’s economy is primarily based on industry, agriculture, and services.\n\nThe industrial sector, which includes automotive, pharmaceutical, and information technology industries, is a significant contributor to the economy.\n\nAgriculture, particularly the production of grains, fruits, and livestock, is also important for employment and exports.\n\nThe services sector, including tourism, has been growing in recent years, contributing to the country’s economic development.\n\nHowever, Hungary faces various economic challenges, including high levels of public debt, a rapidly aging population, and vulnerability to fluctuations in global markets.\n\nThe government has been working on policies to promote economic growth, attract foreign investment, and address social issues such as income inequality and unemployment.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, the Hungarian Forint is the official currency of Hungary and is managed by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank.\n\nThe currency operates under a floating exchange rate system, with its value determined by market forces and potential intervention from the Bank.\n\nThe Hungarian Forint is subdivided into fillér, although fillér coins are no longer in circulation, and is issued in various banknote and coin denominations.\n\nHungary’s economy is primarily based on industry, agriculture, and services, but the country faces challenges related to high public debt, an aging population, and vulnerability to global market fluctuations."
