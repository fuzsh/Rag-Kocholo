The note is in good condition.\n\nHistory note\n\nIssued for use in Austro-Hungarian POW Camps and printed in German on one side and Hungarian on the other. By the early twentieth century the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire had evolved into a multi-lingual, multi-racial politico-military structure which encompassed much of Central Europe. In 1275 Rudolf of Hapsburg had gained territory from Ottokar, King of Bohemia and began the Hapsburg family's rise to its subsequently powerful Imperial and dynastic position. The status of the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary reflected the dominant Austro-Hungarian ethnic composition of the later Empire. During the First World War the Austro-Hungarian Empire was one of the Central Powers, fighting with Imperial Germany, Turkey and Bulgaria.The Empire fought protracted campaigns with Russia and Italy, which led to the establishment of numerous Austro-Hungarian POW camps.The collapse of the Empire in1918 led to the establishment of the independent republic of Austria and the short-lived republic of Hungary.\n\nObject Details\n\nCategory\n\nCurrency\n\nRelated period\n\nFirst World War (production), First World War (association)\n\nCreator\n\nGlobus, Budapest\n\nProduction date\n\n1916\n\nMaterials\n\nwhole: paper\n\nCatalogue number\n\nCUR 16945\n\nObject associations\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.
