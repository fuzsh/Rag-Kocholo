        "text": "Facts about Hungarian currency\n\nIf you think 20,000 is a big number for one banknote, just wait until you hear about the pengő (Hungary’s previous currency). The pengő suffered from the world’s most intense case of hyperinflation ever, and 29 zeroes had to be dropped when the pengő was replaced by the forint in 1946. Good grief.\n\nThe forint has experienced its fair share of inflation too, which is why the fillér subunit was rendered useless and taken out of circulation in 1999.\n\nA 1992 design of the 100 Ft coin was rapidly replaced in 1996 because people complained that it was too big and ugly. Fair call.\n\nEach Hungarian banknote features a famous leader or politician on one side and a related place or event on the other.\n\nThe term ‘forint’ actually comes from Florence, where fiorino d’oro (gold coins) were minted from 1252."
