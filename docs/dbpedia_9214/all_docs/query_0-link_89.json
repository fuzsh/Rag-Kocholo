        "text": "What is forex trading?\n\nForex trading is the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another.\n\nCurrencies are traded through a “forex broker” or “CFD provider” and are traded in pairs. Currencies are quoted in relation to another currency.\n\nFor example, the euro and the U.S. dollar (EUR/USD) or the British pound and the Japanese yen (GBP/JPY).\n\nWhen you trade in the forex market, you buy or sell in currency pairs.\n\nImagine each currency pair constantly in a “tug of war” with each currency on its own side of the rope.\n\nAn exchange rate is the relative price of two currencies from two different countries.\n\nExchange rates fluctuate based on which currency is stronger at the moment.\n\nThere are three categories of currency pairs:\n\nThe “majors“\n\nThe “crosses“\n\nThe “exotics“\n\nThe major currency pairs always include the U.S. dollar.\n\nCross-currency pairs do NOT include the U.S. dollar. Crosses that involve any of the major currencies are also known as ” minors”.\n\nExotic currency pairs consist of one major currency and one currency from an emerging market (EM).\n\nMajor Currency Pairs\n\nThe currency pairs listed below are considered the “majors.”\n\nThese pairs all contain the U.S. dollar (USD) on one side and are the most frequently traded.\n\nWhile there are EIGHT major currencies, there are only SEVEN major currency pairs.\n\nCompared to the crosses and exotics, the price moves more frequently with the majors, which provides more trading opportunities.\n\nCurrency Pair Countries FX Geek Speak EUR/USD Eurozone / United States “euro dollar” USD/JPY United States / Japan “dollar yen” GBP/USD United Kingdom / United States “pound dollar” USD/CHF United States/ Switzerland “dollar swissy” USD/CAD United States / Canada “dollar loonie” AUD/USD Australia / United States “aussie dollar” NZD/USD New Zealand / United States “kiwi dollar”\n\nThe majors are the most liquid in the world.\n\nLiquidity is used to describe the level of activity in the financial market.\n\nIn forex, it’s based on the number of active traders buying and selling a specific currency pair and the volume being traded.\n\nThe more frequently traded something is the higher its liquidity.\n\nFor example, more people trade the EUR/USD currency pair and at higher volumes than the AUD/USD currency pair.\n\nThis means that EUR/USD is more liquid than AUD/USD.\n\nMajor Cross-Currency Pairs or Minor Currency Pairs\n\nCurrency pairs that include any two of the major currencies except the U.S. dollar are known as cross-currency pairs or simply as the “crosses.”\n\nMajor crosses are also known as “minors.”\n\nWhile not as frequently traded as the majors, the crosses are still pretty liquid and still provide plenty of trading opportunities.\n\nDon’t confuse minor currency pairs with the seven major currency pairs, all of which include the U. S. dollar against one of the seven other most liquid currencies in the world.\n\nThe most actively traded crosses are derived from the three major non-USD currencies: EUR, JPY, and GBP.\n\nEuro Crosses\n\nCurrency Pair Countries FX Geek Speak EUR/CHF Eurozone / Switzerland “euro swissy” EUR/GBP Eurozone / United Kingdom “euro pound” EUR/CAD Eurozone / Canada “euro loonie” EUR/AUD Eurozone / Australia “euro aussie” EUR/NZD Eurozone / New Zealand “euro kiwi” EUR/SEK Eurozone / Sweden “euro stockie” EUR/NOK Eurozone / Norway “euro nockie”\n\nYen Crosses\n\nCurrency Pair Countries FX Geek Speak EUR/JPY Eurozone / Japan “euro yen” or “yuppy” GBP/JPY United Kingdom / Japan “pound yen” or “guppy” CHF/JPY Switzerland / Japan “swissy yen” CAD/JPY Canada / Japan “loonie yen” AUD/JPY Australia / Japan “aussie yen” NZD/JPY New Zealand / Japan “kiwi yen”\n\nPound Crosses\n\nPair Countries FX Geek Speak GBP/CHF United Kingdom / Switzerland “pound swissy” GBP/AUD United Kingdom / Australia “pound aussie” GBP/CAD United Kingdom / Canada “pound loonie” GBP/NZD United Kingdom / New Zealand “pound kiwi”\n\nOther Crosses\n\nPair Countries FX Geek Speak AUD/CHF Australia / Switzerland “aussie swissy” AUD/CAD Australia / Canada “aussie loonie” AUD/NZD Australia / New Zealand “aussie kiwi” CAD/CHF Canada / Switzerland “loonie swissy” NZD/CHF New Zealand / Switzerland “kiwi swissy” NZD/CAD New Zealand / Canada “kiwi loonie”\n\nExotic Currency Pairs\n\nNo, exotic pairs are not exotic belly dancers who happen to be twins.\n\nAn exotic currency is a currency from countries with developing or emerging markets.\n\nExotic currency pairs are made up of one major currency paired with the currency of an emerging economy, such as Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Poland, Chile, Turkey, or Hungary.\n\nBasically, an exotic currency pair includes one major currency alongside an exotic currency.\n\nThe chart below contains a few examples of exotic currency pairs.\n\nWanna take a shot at guessing what those other currency symbols stand for?\n\nDepending on your forex broker, you may see the following exotic currency pairs so it’s good to know what they are.\n\nKeep in mind that these pairs aren’t as heavily traded as the “majors” or “crosses,” so the transaction costs associated with trading these pairs are usually bigger.\n\nCurrency Pair Countries FX Geek Speak USD/BRL United States / Brazil “dollar real” USD/HKD United States / Hong Kong USD/SAR United States / Saudi Arabia “dollar riyal” USD/SGD United States / Singapore “dollar sing” USD/ZAR United States / South Africa “dollar rand” USD/THB United States / Thailand “dollar baht” USD/MXN United States / Mexico “dollar mex” USD/RUB United States / Russia “dollar ruble” or “Barney” USD/PLN United States / Poland “dollar zloty” USD/CLP United States/ Chile\n\nIt’s not unusual to see spreads that are two or three times bigger than that of EUR/USD or USD/JPY.\n\nDue to the overall lower degree of liquidity, exotic currency pairs tend to be far more sensitive to economic and geopolitical events.\n\nFor example, a political scandal or unexpected election results can cause an exotic pair’s exchange rate to swing violently.\n\nSo if you want to trade exotics currency pairs, remember to factor this into your decision.\n\nFor those of y’all who are really mesmerized by exotics, here’s a more comprehensive list.\n\nCurrency Code Country Currency Code Country AED UAE Dirham ARS Argentinean Peso AFN Afghanistan Afghani GEL Georgian Lari MYR Malaysian Ringgit AMD Armenian Dram GYD Guyanese Dollar MZN Mozambique new Metical AWG Aruban Florin IDR Indonesian Rupiah OMR Omani Rial AZN Azerbaijan New Manat IQD Iraqi Dinar QAR Qatari Rial BHD Bahraini Dinar IRR Iranian Rial SLL Sierra Leone Leone BWP Botswana Pula JOD Jordanian Dinar TJS Tajikistani Somoni BYR Belarusian Ruble KGS Kyrgyzstani Som TMT Turkmenistan new Manat CDF Congolese Franc LBP Lebanese Pound TZS Tanzanian Schilling DZD Algerian Dinar LRD Liberian Dollar UZS Uzbekistan Som EGP Egyptian Pound MAD Moroccan Dirham WST Samoan Tala EEK Estonian Kroon MNT Mongolian Tugrik MWK Malawi Kwacha ETB Ethiopian Birr THB Thai Baht TRY New Turkish Lira ZAR South African Rand ZWD Zimbabwe Dollar BRL Brazilian Real CLP Chilean Peso CNY Chinese Yuan Renminbi CZK Czech Koruna HKD Hong Kong Dollar HUF Hungarian Forint ILS Israeli Shekel INR Indian Rupee ISK Icelandic Krona KRW South Korean Won KWD Kuwaiti Dinar MXN Mexican Peso PHP Philippine Peso PKR Pakistani Rupee PLN Polish Zloty RUB Russian Ruble SAR Saudi Arabian Riyal SGD Singaporean Dollar TWD Taiwanese Dollar\n\nDID YOU KNOW? There are 180 legal currencies in the world, as recognized by the United Nations. That’s a lot of potential currency pairs! Unfortunately, not all of them are tradable. Forex brokers tend to offer traders up to 70 currency pairs.\n\nAside from the three main categories of currency pairs, there are other “groups” of currencies that are thrown around in the FX world that you should be aware of.\n\nG10 Currencies\n\nThe G10 currencies are ten of the most heavily traded currencies in the world, which are also ten of the world’s most liquid currencies.\n\nTraders regularly buy and sell them in an open market with minimal impact on their own international exchange rates.\n\nCountry Currency Name Currency Code United States dollar USD European Union euro EUR United Kingdom pound GBP Japan yen JPY Australia dollar AUD New Zealand dollar NZD Canada dollar CAD Switzerland franc CHF Norway krone NOK Sweden krona SEK Denmark krone DKK\n\nThe Scandies\n\nScandinavia is a subregion in Northern Europe, with strong historical, cultural, and linguistic ties.\n\nThe term “Scandinavia” in local usage covers the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.\n\nTogether, their currencies are known as the “Scandies“.\n\nBack in the day, Denmark and Sweden established the Scandinavian Monetary Union to merge their currencies to a gold standard. Norway joined later.\n\nThis meant that these countries now had one currency, with the same monetary value, with the exception that each of these countries minted its own coins.\n\nBut then World War I happened, the gold standard was abandoned and the Scandinavian Monetary Union disbanded. These countries decided to keep the currency, even if the values were separate from one another. And this remains the state of things.\n\nIf you notice their currency names, they all look similar. That’s because the word “krone or krona” literally means “crown”, and the differences in spelling of the name represent the differences between the North Germanic languages.\n\nCrown currencies. What a cool name huh?\n\nI don’t know about you, but saying “Hook me up with some crowns yo.” sounds way cooler than “Hook me up with some dollahs yo.”\n\nCountry Currency Name Currency Code Denmark krone DKK Sweden krona SEK Norway krone NOK\n\nSEK and NOK also have cool nicknames, “Stockie” and “Nokie“.\n\nSo when paired with the U.S. dollar, USD/SEK is read “dollar stockie” and USD/NOK is read “dollar nockie”.\n\nCEE Currencies\n\n“CEE” stands for Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe is a term encompassing the countries in Central Europe, the Baltics, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Europe (the Balkans), usually meaning former communist states from the Eastern Bloc (Warsaw Pact) in Europe.\n\nCentral and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) is an OECD term for the group of countries comprising Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and the three Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n\nRegarding the FX market, there are four main CEE currencies to be aware of.\n\nCountry Currency Name Currency Code Hungary forint HUF Czech Republic koruna CZK Poland zloty PLN Romania leu RON\n\nBRIICS\n\nBRIICS is the acronym coined for the association of six major emerging national economies: Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa.\n\nOriginally the first four were grouped as “BRIC” (or “the BRICs”). BRICs was a term created by Goldman Sachs to name today’s new high-growth emerging economies.\n\nBRIICS is the term created by the OECD, when it added Indonesia and South Africa.\n\nCountry Currency Name Currency Code Brazil real BRL Russia ruble RUB India rupee INR Indonesia rupiah IDR China yuan CNY South Africa rand ZAR\n\nBRICS+\n\nAt the BRICS Summit held in September, 2023, the BRICS+ countries announced plans to expand the grouping to include new members!\n\nArgentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been invited to join as full members from January 2024.\n\nThe BRICS Plus countries vary significantly in their economic and demographic impact.\n\nThe five BRICS countries represent about 41% of the world’s population, 32% of global economic output (adjusted for purchasing power), and 20% of global goods exports.\n\nIncluding the five ‘Plus’ countries, the combined bloc accounts for roughly 45% of the world’s population, 36% of global GDP, and 25% of global goods export\n\nSummary\n\nWhew! That was a lot of information on currencies but you just raised your FX IQ points!\n\nLet’s summarize what you’ve learned in a series of questions:\n\nWhat is a currency pair in forex?\n\nA currency pair is a pairing of currencies where the value of one is relative to the other. For example, GBP/USD is the value of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nWhat are the major currency pairs?\n\nMajor currency pairs (“majors”) are those that include the U.S. dollar and are the most frequently traded. There are seven of them: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD.\n\nWhat are the currency crosses?\n\nCurrency crosses (“crosses”) are the more frequently traded currencies that do NOT include the U.S. dollar in their pairing. Crosses include EUR/GBP, EUR/CAD, GBP/JPY, EUR/CHF, EUR/JPY, etc."
