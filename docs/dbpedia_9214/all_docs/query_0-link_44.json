        "text": "This post covers money-related issues for visitors who need clarification on the official currency of Budapest or which currency they should bring to Hungary.\n\nBy sticking to this post, you will have some valuable money tips for Budapest.\n\nWhat is the Currency?\n\nExchange Rates\n\nCash vs. Credit Cards\n\nExchange Locations\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat Currency Is Used in Budapest and Hungary\n\nThe official Hungary currency is the Forint (HUF), Budapest's preferred and most widely accepted form of payment.\n\nWhile Euros might be accepted in some tourist-oriented establishments, the conversion rates are often unfavorable, so it's best to have Forints with you.\n\nHere is the denomination of Hungarian Banknotes and Coins:\n\nHungarian coins are available in 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 Forint. The 1 and 2 Forint coins were discontinued, but prices are still given in these amounts, and the total is rounded to the nearest 5 Forint when paying in cash.\n\nThe banknotes are available in 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000, and 20,000 HUF denominations.\n\nWhile the official currency in Hungary is the Forint, some businesses in Budapest, exceptionally those catering to tourists, may accept Euros.\n\nHowever, the exchange rate these businesses provide may not be as better as that offered by a bank or currency exchange office.\n\nJust like Euros, the US Dollar and British Pound are not commonly accepted in Budapest.\n\nWhile some souvenir shops or tourist-centric businesses might accept them, the exchange rate could be more favorable.\n\nUnderstanding Forint Exchange Rates\n\nThe exchange rate for the Hungarian Forint varies, as with all global currencies, and depends on current financial market conditions.\n\nThe most common conversions are from Euros, US dollars, and British pounds.\n\nAs of Mar 2024, the following exchange rates apply.\n\n$1 equals approximately 363 HUF, and $100 equals approximately 36,352 HUF.\n\nЄ1 equals approximately 394 HUF and Є100 equals approximately 39,416.80 HUF\n\n1 GBP equals approximately 460 HUF, and 100 GBP equals approximately 46,008 HUF\n\nThere are several ways to exchange currency in Budapest:\n\nCurrency Exchange Offices: These are located around the city, at the airport, and near shopping markets, especially in tourist areas. Check the exchange rate and commission beforehand. We include 3 recommended exchange offices below.\n\nBanks: Banks often offer better exchange rates compared to exchange offices. However, they may also charge a small fee. Remember that banks in Hungary usually close early in the afternoon, and most are closed on Saturday.\n\nATMs: Withdraw Forints directly from a local ATM or cash machine, as they often offer competitive exchange rates. This method can be the most convenient as ATMs are commonly found around the city.\n\nHowever, check with your own bank about any applicable foreign conversion fees.\n\nCash vs. Credit Cards\n\nCredit cards, visa, and Mastercard are widely used as payment methods, but some smaller places or markets may only take cash.\n\nFurthermore, having a small amount of local currency on hand is helpful for small transactions like tipping, paying for a taxi, or buying items at local markets.\n\nHow much cash you carry with you per day depends on your personal spending habits and daily plans. Having around 10,000 - 15,000 HUF per day should suffice for meals, local transportation, and small incidental purchases.\n\nFees associated with card transactions\n\nRemember that while using credit or debit cards can be convenient, there may be foreign transaction fees associated with their use abroad.\n\nThese fees vary by bank and card type, so it's recommended to inquire about potential charges before your trip.\n\nThe Best Places to Exchange Currency in Budapest\n\nHere are the 3 best places to exchange money in Budapest, Hungary.

Instead, you can exchange money when you reach Budapest.\n\nWhat is the best way to pay for things in Budapest?\n\nNot all places accept euros and dollars in Budapest.
