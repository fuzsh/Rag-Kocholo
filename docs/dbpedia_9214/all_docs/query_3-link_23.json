        "text": "Before visiting Hungary, it’s helpful to know a little about our currency, and how it works, that is why we made this Hungarian money guide for you, so you can find every useful information about paying in Budapest. Most importantly we have our own currency:\n\nThe official currency of Hungary is the Hungarian Forint (HUF). Take a look at this guide to the Hungarian Forint from using cash machines to cash payment.\n\nBanknotes come in denominations of 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000 and 20,000. All of them are watermarked, contain an embedded vertical security strip of thin metal, and are designed to be suitable for visually impaired individuals. Six different coins are in use: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 forint coins.\n\nCurrency Exchange for Travelers in Budapest\n\nYou can exchange your currency in Budapest at banks, currency exchange offices, and some hotels. We recommend changing up to 20€ at the airport upon arrival, as the exchange rate is far from being the best there. Additionally, we advise avoiding Orange ‘InterChange’ currency exchange businesses located everywhere in Budapest, as they offer the worst rates compared to other establishments. Our recommended exchange office chain is the Correct Change, they have plenty of offices in the city center and surprisingly they are really correct!\n\nNavigating Cash and Card Payments in Hungary\n\nIn the vibrant streets of Budapest, managing your finances efficiently is crucial for a seamless travel experience. While Hungary is increasingly card-friendly, having a mix of cash and card can be a savvy choice. Here’s a breakdown to help you strike the right balance:\n\nThe Card Advantage\n\nHungary, especially Budapest, has embraced card payments, with the majority of establishments accepting cards, even in smaller shops and bars. Using your card for most transactions is convenient and widely accepted. However, it’s essential to be mindful of potential fees from your bank. Some banks charge fees for international card usage, so it’s advisable to check with your bank and weigh the costs. Using your card also ensures a favorable exchange rate compared to withdrawing cash.\n\nCash Reserves for Added Convenience\n\nWhile card usage covers the majority of your expenses, having a small cash reserve (about 1/3 of your total budget) is recommended. This can be particularly handy for tipping our Free Budapest Tour guides, market hall purchases, public toilets, or in the rare instance where card payments might not be accepted Locals often emphasize paying in Hungarian Forints (HUF) rather than Euros, as the latter may incur less favorable exchange rates. Keeping around 20,000 HUF (approximately 50 Euros) in cash can provide a safety net for those few instances where cards may not suffice.\n\nATMs: Choose Wisely\n\nWhen withdrawing cash, opt for ATMs located inside or next to bank branches, avoiding those branded as ‘Euronet.’ This precaution ensures a more secure transaction and minimizes the risk of unfavorable exchange rates.\n\nAlways choose to withdraw Forints from established banks like Raiffeisenbank, K&H, ERSTE or OTP for better rates. Keep in mind that using ATMs, while convenient, might incur fees depending on your bank back home.\n\nPaying in Hungarian money (HUF) Matters:\n\nWhether it’s for dinner, a glass of champagne at the State Opera House or a local market find, paying in Hungarian Forints is advised. It not only aligns with the local preference but also safeguards you from potential rip-offs associated with using foreign currencies.\n\nFun facts about Hungarian money:\n\nWhy is Hungarian money called Forint?\n\nThe name forint finds its origin in the city of Florence, where gold coins minted since 1252 were called fiorino d’oro.In Hungary, the gold-based currency Florentinus was used from 1325 under the reign of Charles Robert; after that, several other countries followed this example.\n\nWhy Hungary Does Not Have the Euro as a Currency?"
