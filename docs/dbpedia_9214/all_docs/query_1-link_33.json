        "text": "Hungarian forint bank account vs Wise account\n\nIf you need to send, receive, and hold HUF you may be able to open a Hungarian forint bank account with your normal bank. That means you can transact in Hungarian forints from wherever you call home, without needing a local address overseas.\n\nWise accounts are a great alternative. Use the Hungarian forint details which come with a Wise account to safely receive money in Hungarian forints, which you can convert to spend conveniently in the US. Wise converts at the mid-market rate with no hidden fees.\n\nHold your funds in Hungarian forints or 40+ other currencies in your Wise account, send payments to 160 countries, and get an optional Wise card, to spend and withdraw your Hungarian forints easily in the currency of your choice.\n\nThe number of currencies you can receive money in depends on your location. Check which currencies you can receive."
