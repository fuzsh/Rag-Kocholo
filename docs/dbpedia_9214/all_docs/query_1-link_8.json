        "text": "On my photo tours I hear a lot of foreigners saying:\n\n‚ÄúOh, hungarian money is so confusing‚Äú\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Monopoly money‚Äú.\n\nAnd so on‚Ä¶\n\nIn this short and straight-to-the-point article I will introduce you the hungarian forint. What notes and coins it has, and I also give you tips on exchange and share my personal opinion.\n\nForint banknotes and coins\n\nHungarian forint is one of the oldest moneys in Europe: the first forint dates back to 1325!\n\nAt that time they used the design that came from Florence, Italy. Hence often is was referred to as florin, even in the 19th century.\n\nHowever, nowadays, it‚Äôs officially named forint, NOT florin.\n\nSpanish still can it florin, but English should call it forint üôÇ\n\nHungarian forint is abbreviated to HUF.\n\nForint has no ‚Äúcents‚Äù. We used to have fill√©r, which was similar to cent: 100 fill√©r used to be 1 forint.\n\nBut as the forint got inflated in the 1990s, using fill√©rs did not make sense any more, and they were withdrawn.\n\nThe 1 forint and 2 forint coin was also withdrawn, that‚Äôs why the smallest forint we have is the 5 forint coin.\n\nYou can clearly see that the 100 forint coin is the odd one out in terms of design and size.\n\nTo be honest, I don‚Äôt know why they went with this design.\n\nForint to USD exchange rate\n\nAs of October, 2019, 1 USD equals roughly 300 HUF. This makes it very easy to calculate with.\n\nHistorically, the USD-HUF rate used to be around 250, but due to the hungarian government financial policy, and the uncertainty of Brexit, forint tanked in the last year.\n\nAt least it‚Äôs good for the tourism üôÇ\n\nHere‚Äôs a graph showing the USD-HUF exchange rate over the last 10 years:\n\nForint to EUR exchange rate\n\nThe same weakening can be observed with the euro to forint exchange rates.\n\n1 euro equals to around 330 forints as of 2019, October.\n\nHere‚Äôs a graph showing the EUR-HUF exchange rate over the last 10 years:\n\nWhere to exchange hungarian forints?\n\nThere are dozens of money exchange places in Budapest, and also in every bigger cities across Hungary.\n\nMoney exchange in hungarian is P√©nzv√°lt√≥.\n\nAlmost everywhere they speak English, so you should have no trouble.\n\nBefore exchanging, make sure to check not only the exchange rate, but also if they have any kind of commission as well.\n\nSome places have very attractive exchange rates, but they throw a hilarious commission fee on you.\n\nHere are money exchangers in Budapest (on Google Maps)\n\nDo they accept euros in Hungary?\n\nNot officially, but at many tourist-frequented shops euro is also accepted.\n\nBut please keep in mind, that they accept it at a pretty bad exchange rate, and almost always they will give you back in forints only.\n\nWhy doesn‚Äôt Hungary have euro if it‚Äôs in the EU?\n\nThis is something people ask me all the time!\n\nAlthough Hungary is part of the European Union since 2004, and Hungary wanted to introduce euro for many years, we were not allowed to do that.\n\nThe answer is simple: if a country wants to join to the euro-zone, then it needs to fulfill several financial criteria.\n\nThis is to protect the euro from getting weaker, otherwise a badly performing economy would have serious effect on all the other countries using euro.\n\nMy personal view: most hungarian people would not like to get rid of forint in favour of the euro.\n\nEspecially, the current hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, would not want that, as he is always preaching against the EU.\n\nWhy I think the forint is a cool money?\n\nAnother personal opinion of mine.\n\nAs someone born and raised in Hungary I take pride in having a currency that can be found only in this country.\n\nInstead of using an all-the-same euro, we have a national money!\n\nOf course, this often causes problem in the economy, but still, many people are quite attached to our historic money.\n\nFew other things why I prefer forint to the EUR / USD‚Ä¶\n\nForint notes have equal sizes. Unlike the euro, where the 5 euro bill is so much smaller than the 100 bill. The 100 EUR bill is so wide, that it doesn‚Äôt even fit into a normal wallet!\n\nWhereas the hungarian forint notes have equal sizes (154 x 70 mm).\n\nI also like the fact every forint banknote is different in color. I always have a hard time to read the different US dollar bills ‚Äì only the pictures and numbers are different there, the color is the same."
