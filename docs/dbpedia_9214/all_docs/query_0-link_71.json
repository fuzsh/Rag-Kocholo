        "text": "Is it a good time to buy Hungarian Forints?\n\nAs the exchange rate increases, there are more Forints per Euro.\n\nAs the exchange rate decreases, there are fewer forints per euro.\n\nThe path of the chart illustrates whether today's exchange rate is favorable compared to the previous time period.\n\nValid predictions about the future formation of the exchange rate are not possible.\n\nWhy is the Conversion Rate different from the International Reference Rate?\n\nThe International Reference Exchange Rate is notified by the European Central Bank and acts as a base price for transactions between the two currencies.\n\nBuying and Selling Foreign Exchange requires the involvement of people and processes that cost money.\n\nThe Conversion Rate is therefore adjusted to cover this cost.\n\nWe improve our processes and offer excellent exchange rates.\n\nIs it better to buy Hungarian Forints from Greece or use my card abroad?\n\nUsing your card abroad, either at ATMs to withdraw cash in local currency or at markets, incurs additional bank charges.\n\nFrequent questions\n\nHow can I buy foreign exchange?\n\nComplete your order online and collect your change from the store of your choice.\n\nHow much currency can I order?\n\nYou can order value exchange from 300 euro up to 1.000 euro.\n\nHow can I pay;\n\nYou can pay by cash or card at the nearest store.\n\nWhen will my currency be available?\n\nYour exchange will be available the next business day from the order.\n\nDo I need a certificate for the transaction?\n\nA valid certificate is required to complete the transaction (ID card, passport)"
