        "text": "Hungarian Forint is the official currency used in Hungary, a country strategically located at the center of Europe. Its capital Budapest is fast becoming one of the most popular cities to visit. Tourist attractions include the 125 thermal springs, the bank of river Danube, etc. With all these attractions comes the need for money and because of this need, many exchange offices are littered around the city, even banks and hotels aren’t left out too. Before you start looking for the best places to exchange your money in Budapest, here are worthwhile tips you need to know.\n\nThings to know before exchanging money\n\nActual exchange rate: The mid-market rate is the exchange rate that is found on Google. By knowing the actual rate, you can easily compare two money exchange offices before making a decision.\n\nRate fluctuates: Exchange rates vary, fluctuate and is determined by factors such as interest rate, economic decisions, and economic growth.

Also, it doesn’t hurt to know the actual rate of your currency when converted to Forint or Forint to your currency before setting out\n\nAirport, banks, train stations and hotels are not an option: While these places may seem safe, they are not in any way friendly to your pocket. They offer exorbitant rates than what you will get in the open market a block or two away.\n\nAsk questions: you are allowed to ask loads of questions. Don’t shy away from asking about their rate, how their commission is calculated. It can never hurt even if you ask for a receipt or not, but what may hurt in the long run is giving them your money without knowing a thing or two about how their rate is calculated.\n\nNo commission: As you go around looking for a reputable exchange office, try and flee from all that advertises ‘no commission’. This is because their commission is hidden in the actual charge, while the ones that charge for commission upfront collect what they advertise.\n\n5 best places to exchange money in Budapest\n\n1.
