        "text": "At The Currency Shop, we keep things nice and simple. Because every company has different exchange rates and fees, finding the best deal can be a minefield. That’s where we step in. We bring together all your options, highlight the fees and rates per provider, and show you the best possible deals.\n\nHow to buy Hungarian Forint (HUF) with NZD\n\nBuy HUF Online\n\nThis is usually the cheapest way to buy currency, but you need some time. You can choose where to pick the order up from or get it home delivered.\n\nMoney Changers\n\nThis is the best way to get currency quickly. You will find them in major shopping centres and towns.\n\nMoney Tips\n\nThe HUF 'buy' rates are better in your city. So it can be worth going there if you're exchanging more than $2,000\n\nAlways ask for a better rate. We've found you can often get a better deal just by asking, particularly if you're buying more than $100\n\nBank\n\nMost banks do exchange currency. The issue is that they often have high fees, and don't offer very good rates. It's always better to compare rates elsewhere before deciding, but as a standard rule it's best to avoid your bank. Especially for a popular currency like the Hungarian Forint.\n\nAirport\n\nYes, you can buy currency at the airport. But that doesn't mean you should. While it's convenient, it's also very expensive.\n\nMoney Tips\n\nOrdering it online and picking it up at the airport is much cheaper than buying it in person\n\nIf you've run out of time before your trip, it's definitely better to buy currency when you get overseas, or use your debit card instead\n\nWe compare New Zealand's most trusted brands\n\nOur most frequently asked questions\n\nWhy should I choose The Currency Shop?\n\nMany people are not aware of the true cost of transferring money. But it is pretty standard to lose up to 8% of your money each time you transfer money internationally, depending on your method. We think this is far too much. That’s why we help you find the best way to transfer your money and avoid those costly hidden fees and charges. And it works. On average, we save our customers $4,000 each year.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIt’s pretty simple. Whether you need travel money or would like to transfer money overseas we just need a little info to point you in the right direction. First, you tell us what you are looking for then we compare hundreds of providers to find the best deal for your current situation. We’ll highlight all the available options and recommend the best one for you. You can then decide which option you prefer, and click through to their site to secure the deal.\n\nIs it safe?\n\nYes. The Currency Shop holds an Australian Financial Services Licence (462269) and is a member of the Financial Ombudsman Service. We closely vet our providers and only partner with the largest, safest and most trusted money transfer companies in the world. That just makes sense.\n\nWhat does it cost?\n\nThe Currency Shop does not charge you. Instead, we receive a referral fee from the banks and money transfer companies that we are partnered with. This does not affect the price you pay.\n\nYour currency knowledge centre\n\nGuide\n\nNew Zealand Dollar Forecasts\n\nForecasts for the New Zealand Dollar from bank experts are revised throughout the year. This article looks at the different outlooks and is updated regularly.\n\nGuide\n\nHow to Buy Currency: Online Versus In-Store\n\nBuying travel money online is one way to reduce stress and potentially save time – but are there any disadvantages you need to be aware of?\n\nRead more ⟶\n\n3 min read\n\nGuide\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to Currency Exchange in New Zealand\n\nThere is no single way to exchange currency that is always the cheapest. It really depends on what currency you are buying, how much and where you are.\n\nRead more ⟶\n\n3 min read"
