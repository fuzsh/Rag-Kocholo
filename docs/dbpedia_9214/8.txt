This POST “Hungarian Forint” was originally published on December 26, 2019, and has been updated as of June 22, 2023.

Hungarian forint

The Hungarian forint is the currency of Hungary since 1946. It is represented by the symbol Ft and the ISO code 4217, HUF.

The forint is also known as forinto (in Hungarian, forint), denomination that comes from the Italian city of Florence, in which there were 1,252 “fiorinos”, gold coins circulating in Europe.

The Hungarian forint is divided into 100 filerest although these decimal units are not actually used or in circulation in Hungary because of their very low value at the exchange rate with the euro (see below).

Currently the exchange rate of the euro against the guilder (see below) is:

1 euro is equivalent to about HUF 369.69 Hungarian forints.

1000 Hungarian forints are equivalent to 2.70 euros.

History of the Hungarian forint

In addition to taking its name from the “fiorina” coins minted in Florence (Italy) in 1252, the same name is attributed to the “florentinus” gold coin that had circulated in Hungary since 1325, deriving from the current “forint”. King Charles I of Hungary (1288-1342) is credited with introducing a complete monetary system in Hungary based on the implicit value of the coins, expressed in the gold metal.

Between 1868 and 1892, the currency of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was called “forint” (in German it was referred to as “Austro-Hungarian guilder”). Later, the forint becomes the official currency of the Republic of Hungary on August 1, 1946 after the end of World War II.

From then until the 1980s, this currency remained relatively stable in the markets, but the transition of Hungary to a market economy in the early 90s of the last century, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, had serious consequences on its price.

In those 1990s, the value of the Hungarian guilder (inflation in Hungary was double digits, even reaching 35% in 1991) deteriorated greatly. Since 2001, Hungarian inflation remains in a single digit and the forint is a fully convertible currency. Especially since the accession of Hungary to the European Union on May 1, 2004.

In fact, Hungary is on track to abandon the forint and join the other 19 countries of the European Union of the 28 that already use the euro.

Hungarian forint banknotes

Forint banknotes have existed since 1946, the date on which the Hungarian National Bank (Magyar Nemzeti Bank – MNB) introduced banknotes with its first two denominations, the 10 Ft and the 100 Ft banknote.

A complete redesign of all banknotes was carried out between 1997 and 2001, gradually issuing new denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 forints.

Each current forint banknote shows a famous Hungarian leader on the obverse, and somewhere linked to it on the reverse. All notes have a watermark and a visible metal band. All 1,000 forints banknotes and theirs superiors in value have the same size of 154 x 70 mm.

Commemorative banknotes have also been issued: those of 1,000 and 2,000 forints to commemorate the millennium of the birth of the Hungarian state, and those of 500 forints that commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution.

Euro to Hungarian forint exchange rate

The euro to forint exchange rates oscillates at all times. If you search on Google “euro to hungarian forint rate” you will find dozens of websites (“currency converters”) that offer a “rate” of the day. Something like this (June 22, 2023):

As you can see, the exchange rates last year have oscillated between 312 and 335 forints per euro, but keep in mind that this graph represents the value of the “currency” forint against the euro, and not that of the paper currency, which is lower.

In fact, in the currency providers in Spain you can buy today (June 22, 2023) Hungarian forints at an exchange rate of between 253.44 at any airport and 349.65 HUF for each euro from Cambiator. Nothing to do with the Euro to Hungarian florint currency exchange (369.69 today).

So, when you see these values in Google and other currency converters with your mobile, keep this in mind:

-This is an unreliable rate. That is, if you click on the “Disclaimer” link, you get this Google Finance warning: “Google cannot guarantee the accuracy of the exchange rates shown. Confirm the current rates before making a transaction that may be affected by changes in exchange rates. ”

-These rates you see are usually wholesale prices of the Hungarian forint currency against the Euro currency and not those of paper currency;

-Only banks can have these rates with each other. That is, it is impossible to get them as a individuals.

If you need paper forint banknotes you will have to go through the retail travel money market (bank or currency exchange supplier). This market means that the Hungarian forints have had to be “transported” by someone for you to enjoy them (or bought from travelers from Hungary passing through Spain previously).

In other words, moving banknotes from one place to another has logistic costs that will make their selling price more expensive (the exchange rate that will be applied to you by the seller).

The Hungarian forint is a currency not very common or abundant in Spain, so it is not so easy to find it available for sale. Therefore it is good to anticipate the purchase and order it online to get a better price.

Where to exchange hungarian forints in Spain

The 3 most popular places to change HUF in Spain are banks, currency suppliers and the airports.

Of these, the least recommended place to buy are airports and any business that charges you a commission in addition to a “margin of exchange” (difference between the price for which you paid the currency and the price for which they sell it to you).

That is, most banks and some currency providers charge you a commission when you change in person without first going through their website to book online and thus avoid this commission.
