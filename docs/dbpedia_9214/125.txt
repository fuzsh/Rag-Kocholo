Description

The forint is the official currency of Hungary. The official currency symbol; Ft. The name forint, comes from Florence, where gold coins known as fiorino d’oro have been struck since 1252. From 1325 under Charles Robert, Hungary adopted florentinus (later forint), a gold-based currency, with several other countries following Hungary’s lead. The forint was the name used for the currency of the Austro-Hungarian Empire between 1868 and 1892. The introduction of the forint in 1946 was a critical step in stabilizing the Hungarian economy following World War II, as the pengõ had become nearly unusable due to significant hyperinflation between 1945 and 1946. Consequently, of the currency introduction, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (Hungarian National Bank) issued notes in denominations of 10 and 100 forint, followed by a better quality series whose denominations were 10, 20, and 100 forint in 1947 and 1948. The 50 forint note was introduced in 1953, followed by the 500 forint in 1970, 1,000 forint in 1983, and 5,000 in 1991. Between 1997 and 2001, a totally redesigned new series of banknotes in values of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 forints was gradually issued. Nonetheless, a newly redesigned version of the 1997 banknote series entered circulation in 2014, starting with the 10,000 forint banknote and ending with the 500 forint banknote in 2019.

The 1000 forint note front design presents the bust in the Buda Castle (Budapest) of Matthias Corvinus, also called Matthias I (1443 –1490), who was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1458 to 1490, then elected King of Bohemia in 1469 and who finally adopted the title of Duke of Austria in 1487. The bust is accompanied by the Shield of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (Hungarian National Bank) logo and the silhouette of a crow with a ring in its beak, on a background with a view of the former capital of the Kingdom of Hungary (western part of Budapest) and an artistic design with two human figures that they bear a laurel wreath. The reverse of the note illustrates the Fountain of Hercules and a work of art from the Royal Palace of Visegrád, on a background containing the opposite and reverse of the Matthias golden florin representing King Saint Ladislaus (King of Hungary from 1077 and King of Croatia from 1091) and the Shield of Matthias, which were used in the reign of Corvinus. The lettering of the note is presented in the Hungarian language. This note is part of the 2017 – 2021 series, and its color is blue.
