The Hungarian Forint is the official currency of Hungary. Its currency symbol is Hf, and you might see it abbreviated to HUF when buying foreign currency.

The modern Forint was reintroduced to Hungary in 1946, following the Second World War. The Forint was the country’s official currency between 1868 and 1892, when it was replaced by the Pengő. It’s named after the city of Florence in Italy, where gold coins called “fiorino d’oro” were minted in in the early 13th century.

Hungary is the only country where the Hungarian Forint is used. It isn’t accepted as currency in any other country or territory. While Hungary is a member of the European Union, it has not yet made the switch to Euros.

The lowest denomination of Hungarian Forint banknotes is 500 and the highest is 20,000. Notes also come in 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 and 10,000 Forint. For smaller purchases, you can use Forint coins too, they come in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 Forint.

One Hungarian Forint is divided into 100 Fillér, but Fillér are no longer in circulation. The lowest denomination you can now use is a 5 Forint coin.
