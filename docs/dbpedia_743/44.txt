Source Notes

Sabian Symbols No.264. Church of Light old-file had 11:00 PM; Sy Scholfield quotes newspaper article in New York Times for 11 PM: "Hoboken Astrologer Reads Dempsey Victory in Stars,", June 24, 1921, p. 22. However Scholfield adds that the time is suspect because the same astrologer in the newspaper article (Professor Gustave Meyer, Hoboken Astrologer), gives Georges Carpentier's time at 10 AM whereas Gauquelin via Steinbrecher gives 6 PM for Carpentier.
