William Harrison "Jack" Dempsey (June 24, 1895 – May 31, 1983), known as the The Manassa Mauler, was an American professional boxer. He was a cultural icon of the 1920s. He held the World Heavyweight Championship from 1919 to 1926. Dempsey's aggressive style and exceptional punching power made him one of the most popular boxers in history.

Dempsey was born in Manassa, Colorado and grew up in Colorado, West Virginia, and Utah, in a poor family. His parents were Mary Celia (née Smoot) and Hiram Dempsey, and his ancestry included Irish, Cherokee, and a Jewish paternal great-great-grandmother. Both parents became Mormon converts, and Jack was baptized on August 2, 1903, after he reached the required age of accountability.

Jack Dempsey first started boxing professionally in 1914. He first started boxing under the name of "Kid Blacky" and later boxed under the name of the "Manassa Mauler" after his home town of Manassa, Colorado. Throughout the 1920’s and 1930’s he was extremely popular and is probably one of the most popular boxing champions of all times. He knocked out Jess Willard in 1919 to win the heavyweight boxing title. He lost the heavyweight boxing titles in 1926 to Gene Tunney. He lost again in his second fight with Gene Tunney because of a long count. He knocked Tunney down in the seventh round but because he did not go to a neutral corner immediately the referee delayed the count. Tunney got up at the count of nine and went on to win the bout on a decision. He retired from boxing afterwards.
