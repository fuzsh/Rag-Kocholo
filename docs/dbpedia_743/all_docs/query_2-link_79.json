        "text": "Monday, Feb. 13, is the 100th anniversary of one of the most curious fights in the annals of boxing. On this date in 1917, at Murray, Utah, future heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey was knocked out in the opening round by Fireman Jim Flynn, a journeyman who had won only ten of his last 32 fights. There are varying accounts of the fight and the question of whether Dempsey went into the tank is a question that vexes boxing historians to this very day.\n\nDempsey went on to fame and fortune. In 1962, a panel of 40 experts assembled by The Ring magazine named him the greatest heavyweight champion ever. That placement struck many as an affront to Joe Louis. After winning the title, Dempsey made only five successful defenses. But whatever one’s opinion of Dempsey, it’s undeniable that he seized the imagination of the public like no athlete before him. With assists from promoter Tex Rickard and his wily manager Doc Kearns, he introduced the phrase “Million Dollar Gate” into the lexicon. He overshadowed his era, wrote Paul Gallico, and this was no ordinary era but America’s Golden Era of Sports.\n\nHow did Dempsey lose to a palooka like Fireman Jim Flynn, and lose in such a humiliating fashion?\n\nFIREMAN JIM\n\nFireman Jim Flynn was born Andrew Chiariglione in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1879. Like many fighters of Italian ancestry, he found it advantageous to adopt an Irish ring name. At times he also used the aliases Andrew Haynes and Andrew Haymes.\n\nFlynn heeded Horace Greeley’s admonition: “Go West, Young Man.” At age nineteen, he surfaces in Butte, Montana, where he had his first 11 recorded fights. A wild-and-woolly copper mining town, Butte was an ideal nursery for a boxer. Prizefighting, one might say, was the municipal sport. Stanley Ketchel, the legendary Michigan Assassin, had his first 39 fights in Montana, 26 in Butte.\n\nIn 1902, Flynn moved 900 miles south across the Rocky Mountains to Pueblo, Colorado, the city with which he would be identified. It was in Pueblo, a steel making city that was also an important railroad hub, that Flynn acquired his nickname. But he wasn’t a conventional fireman. He heaved coal into furnaces on steam locomotives.\n\nFlynn had 47 fights under his belt when he made his first foray into California, opposing Tommy Burns in Los Angeles. Burns had won the vacant heavyweight title six months earlier, upending Marvin Hart, and was making his first title defense. The Pueblo fireman weighed 169 pounds for this contest. Tommy Burns came in at 170.\n\nFlynn didn’t fare well. Burns knocked him senseless before the referee stopped the contest in the 15th round. Fireman Jim later had two fights with Jack Johnson, the second of which was contested for Johnson’s heavyweight title. In those fights he also absorbed bad beatings. But Flynn had some good moments during his choppy career. In 1910 he won a newspaper decision over Sam Langford. This was the middle match of his three encounters with the fabled Boston Tar Baby. He was knocked out in the other two.\n\nWhen Fireman Jim met Dempsey he was 37 years old and a full blown heavyweight, carrying 190 pounds, or thereabouts, on his 5’10 ½”-inch frame. And for all the tribulations that he had experienced inside the ring, one could certainly build a case for him against the man that Damon Runyon would dub the Manassa Mauler. Dempsey was a fearsome hitter, but at age twenty-one he was still a work in progress. The presumption was that Flynn’s greater experience would serve him well if he could carry the fight into the late rounds.\n\n——\n\nNowadays Murray, Utah is a white collar suburb of Salt Lake City. The leading employers are health care providers. But in 1917, Murray was an industrial city that housed one of America’s largest smelters. A trolley line ran down the center of the main street. The air was thick with soot.\n\nPrizefighting was illegal in Utah, but that was a joke. Promoters circumvented the law by billing their shows as exhibitions. Moreover, the authorities were disinclined to intercede if a portion of the proceeds was earmarked for a worthwhile cause. That was the case with Dempsey-Flynn. The promoter cast his show as a benefit for the volunteer fire department. The fight was held in their building. (It would subsequently be written that the fire department received only $250 of an estimated $3000 gate.)\n\nTHE FIGHT\n\nPrior to World War I, very few boxing writers were accorded the dignity of a byline. The inconsistencies in so many post-fight reports are undoubtedly related to this convention. Without the transparency of a byline, ring correspondents, often stringers, were more disposed to play loose with the facts.\n\nSome newspaper accounts say that Flynn knocked Dempsey cold with the first punch that he threw, a punch that landed within 10 seconds of the opening bell. At the other end of the spectrum we have the recollection of Billy Roche, a famous referee, who would write that Flynn knocked Dempsey down six times before Dempsey was all in. When he wrote this, Roche must have had Alzheimer’s. He actually worked Fireman Jim’s corner.\n\nSeveral Dempsey biographers, including Roger Kahn, will only allow that Dempsey was vanquished inside of the first two minutes. It wasn’t the referee who stopped the fight according to most re-tellings, but rather Dempsey’s brother Bernie who was working as his chief second. “I was just getting my second wind when Bernie threw in the towel,” recalled Dempsey in his 1977 autobiography written with his stepdaughter Barbara Piattelli Dempsey. This version of events crept into Dempsey’s obituary in the New York Times which said that he was knocked down several times before his brother interceded to stop the carnage.\n\nAs mentioned, during this era first-hand reports weren’t always dependable, but newspaper stories by eyewitnesses, as a rule of thumb, are yet invariably more trustworthy than “facts” set down long after the fact. Turning to the next day’s story in the Salt Lake City Deseret Evening News, here is what we discover:\n\nFireman Jim hit Dempsey with four punches, two on each side of the head, before knocking him into dreamland with a terrific left hook to the jaw. Dempsey got in a few licks too; the fighting was described as fierce. The final punch arrived at the 25-second mark (likely an estimate). There is no mention of Dempsey’s brother throwing in the towel and, by all indications, the referee saw no reason to count; that would have been superfluous.\n\nWAS IT A FIX?\n\nAlmost immediately, there were rumors that the fight was fixed. Dempsey’s soon-to-be ex-wife, an older woman named Maxine Cates, threw fuel on the fire in interviews conducted after their marriage had dissolved. But Maxine, a footloose woman of easy virtue – when Dempsey met her in 1916 she was working in a Salt Lake City bordello – wasn’t the most credible witness because she had an axe to grind. Her brief union with Dempsey left her bruised, emotionally and physically.\n\nBoxing historian Monte Cox authored the most in-depth analysis of the fixed-fight hypothesis. For Cox, the most damning evidence that the fight was fixed appeared in the tenth chapter of a 23-part series about Dempsey that ran in 1920 in the Chicago Tribune. The headline “Dempsey’s Lone KO of Career a Raw Frame Up” and sub-headline “Needed Money so Flopped to Flynn” said it all.\n\nThe author of the series, identified only as “Eye Witness,” claimed to have interviewed three Salt Lake City boxing insiders – a gym operator, a newspaperman, and Dempsey’s manager of the moment – who were all at the fight and had knowledge that it was bogus. “Dempsey, an unknown struggling, hungry fighter at the time, had the necessary motives to accept a payment to lay down,” concluded Cox who noted that Dempsey never fought in Utah again.\n\nThere is, however, a fly in the ointment. It’s very easy for a boxer to play act and fool the spectators into thinking that he is rendering an honest effort. In a sense, boxers rehearse when they spar. However, it takes a very good actor to feign grogginess for any considerable period of time while people are crowding in on him. According to the ringside scribe for the Deseret Evening News, “Dempsey was insensible for several minutes and when brought back from the land of nod he evidently thought he was still in the prize ring and attempted to slug his seconds.”\n\nReminiscing, Dempsey said that when he walked into the ring he realized that he hadn’t warmed up properly. This reporter is inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. With all due respect to Monte Cox, I sense that the fight was legit.\n\nDempsey caught up with Fireman Jim again the next year in Fort Sheridan, Illinois, an Army post on the shore of Lake Michigan, and knocked him out in the opening round. But Flynn soldiered on. Following his retirement at age 44, he reportedly drove a cab for a time in Phoenix. He died at age 55 of heart disease at a hospital in Los Angeles.\n\nJack Dempsey lived to a ripe old age, dying of natural causes in 1983 at age 87 in the bedroom of his apartment in New York. Long after his fighting days were over, he remained in the public eye. “When he entered a crowded room,” wrote Paul Gallico of Dempsey the elder statesman, “he was never less than 12 feet tall.” Fireman Jim Flynn couldn’t extinguish the flame.\n\nCheck out more boxing news on video at The Boxing Channel.\n\nPost Views: 0\n\nIn an unprecedented development, the Boxing Writers Association of America has started a “watch list” to lift the curtain on ring officials who have “screwed up.” Veteran Texas referee Laurence Cole and Nebraska judges Mike Contreras and Jeff Sinnett have the unwelcome distinction of being the first “honorees.”\n\n“Boxing is a sport where judges and referees are rarely held accountable for poor performances that unfairly change the course of a fighter’s career and, in some instances, endanger lives,” says the BWAA in a preamble to the new feature. Hence the watch list, which is designed to “call attention to ‘egregious’ errors in scoring by judges and unacceptable conduct by referees.”\n\nContreras and Sinnett, residents of Omaha, were singled out for their scorecards in the match between lightweights Thomas Mattice and Zhora Hamazaryan, an eight round contest staged at the WinnaVegas Casino in Sloan, Iowa on July 20. They both scored the fight 76-75 for Mattice, enabling the Ohio fighter to keep his undefeated record intact via a split decision.\n\nAlthough Mattice vs. Hamazaryan was a supporting bout, it aired live on ShoBox. Analyst Steve Farhood, who was been with ShoBox since the inception of the series in 2001, called it one of the worst decisions he had ever seen. Lead announcer Barry Tompkins went further, calling it the worst decision he has seen in his 40 years of covering the sport.\n\nLaurence Cole (pictured alongside his father) was singled out for his behavior as the third man in the ring for the fight between Regis Prograis and Juan Jose Velasco at the Lakefront Arena in New Orleans on July 14. The bout was televised live on ESPN.\n\nIn his rationale for calling out Cole, BWAA prexy Joseph Santoliquito leaned heavily on Thomas Hauser’s critique of Cole’s performance in The Sweet Science. “Velasco fought courageously and as well as he could,” noted Hauser. “But at the end of round seven he was a thoroughly beaten fighter.”\n\nHis chief second bullied him into coming out for another round. Forty-five seconds into round eight, after being knocked down for a third time, Velasco spit out his mouthpiece and indicated to Cole that he was finished. But Cole insisted that the match continue and then, after another knockdown that he ruled a slip, let it continue for another 35 seconds before Velasco’s corner mercifully threw in the towel.\n\nControversy has dogged Laurence Cole for well over a decade.\n\nCole was the third man in the ring for the Nov. 25, 2006 bout in Hildalgo, Texas, between Juan Manuel Marquez and Jimrex Jaca. In the fifth round, Marquez sustained a cut on his forehead from an accidental head butt. In round eight, another accidental head butt widened and deepened the gash. As Marquez was being examined by the ring doctor, Cole informed Marquez that he was ahead on the scorecards, volunteering this information while holding his hand over his HBO wireless mike. The inference was that Marquez was free to quit right then without tarnishing his record. (Marquez elected to continue and stopped Jaca in the next round.)\n\nThis was improper. For this indiscretion, Cole was prohibited from working a significant fight in Texas for the next six months.\n\nMore recently, Cole worked the 2014 fight between Vasyl Lomachenko and Orlando Salido at the San Antonio Alamodome. During the fight, Salido made a mockery of the Queensberry rules for which he received no point deductions and only one warning. Cole’s performance, said Matt McGrain, was “astonishingly bad,” an opinion echoed by many other boxing writers. And one could site numerous other incidents where Cole’s performance came under scrutiny.\n\nLaurence Cole is the son of Richard “Dickie” Cole. The elder Cole, now 87 years old, served 21 years as head of the Texas Department of Combat Sports Regulation before stepping down on April 30, 2014. At various times during his tenure, Dickie Cole held high executive posts with the World Boxing Council and North American Boxing Federation. He was the first and only inductee into the inaugural class of the Texas Boxing Hall of Fame, an organization founded by El Paso promoter Lester Bedford in 2015.\n\nFrom an administrative standpoint, boxing in Texas during the reign of Dickie Cole was frequently described in terms befitting a banana republic. Whenever there was a big fight in the Lone Star State, his son was the favorite to draw the coveted refereeing assignment.\n\nBoxing is a sideline for Laurence Cole who runs an independent insurance agency in Dallas. By law in Texas (and in most other states), a boxing promoter must purchase insurance to cover medical costs in the event that one or more of the fighters on his show is seriously injured. Cole’s agency is purportedly in the top two nationally in writing these policies. Make of that what you will.\n\nComplaints of ineptitude, says the WBAA, will be evaluated by a “rotating committee of select BWAA members and respected boxing experts.” In subsequent years, says the press release, the watch list will be published quarterly in the months of April, August, and December (must be the new math).\n\nCheck out more boxing news on video at The Boxing Channel\n\nPost Views: 0\n\nRival boxing shows compete this Saturday as light heavyweight world titlists are featured in New Jersey while former world champion welterweights and middleweights tangle in New York.\n\nA mere 150 miles separate the two fight cards staged in Uniondale, N.Y. and Atlantic City.\n\nBut there’s no mercy inside the boxing ring and certainly no mercy between boxing promotions. While Main Events stages WBO light heavyweight titlist Sergey Kovalev and WBA light heavyweight titlist Dmitry Bivol in separate bouts, DiBella Entertainment stacks former champs Andre Berto against Devon Alexander in a welterweight clash.\n\nTake your pick.\n\nRussia’s Kovalev (32-2-1, 28 KOs) has lost some luster and hopes to reboot his popularity with a win against Canada’s Eleider Alvarez (23-0, 11 KOs). But he will be directly competing against WBA champ Bivol (13-0, 11 KOs), also of Russia, who defends against Isaac Chilemba (25-5-2) of South Africa.\n\nHBO will televise both light heavyweight title fights.\n\nBivol, 27, has slowly, almost glacier-like slow, picked up fans along the way by training in Southern California. The quiet unassuming fighter with a conservative style and cobra-like quickness appeals to the fans.\n\n“I do not think that now I am the best light heavyweight, but I am now one of the best. One of four guys,” said Bivol during a press conference call. “But I hope in not the far future, we will know who is the best.”\n\nThat, of course, would mean a date with Kovalev should both fighters win on Saturday. Nothing is certain.\n\nKovalev, now 35, has lost some of that fear factor aura since losing back-to-back fights to now retired Andre Ward. Though he’s cracked two opponents in succession by knockout, many are pointing to the potential showdown with Bivol as the moment of truth.\n\n“Most likely this fight is gonna happen since both Sergey and I are HBO boxers and as long as that’s what the people want, most likely the fight will happen,” said Bivol. “Me and Sergey will make sure to give this fight to the people.”\n\nIt’s time for the build-up and it starts on Saturday Aug. 4, on HBO.\n\n“That’s certainly a goal of Sergey’s and he’s made it very clear to me that that’s what he wants to do,” said promoter Kathy Duva, CEO of Main Events. “He wants to do unification fights if he is successful with Eleider Alvarez. That’s what he wants to do next; he’s been very clear about that.”\n\nDiBella\n\nFive former world champions stack the fight card at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York.\n\nFormer welterweight world champs Andre Berto (31-5, 24 KOs) and Devon Alexander (27-4-1, 14 KOs) lead the charge in a 12-round clash. FOX will televise the main event and others at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET.\n\nBerto, 34, has been fighting once a year so it’s difficult to determine if age has crept into his reflexes. When he knocked out Victor Ortiz in a rematch two years ago Berto looked sharp and dangerous. But against Shawn Porter a year ago, the crispness seemed gone and he quickly lost by knockout.\n\nAlexander, 31, has the advantage of being a southpaw. But he always seems to do the minimum when he fights. Last February he slowed down and allowed Victor Ortiz to steal the fight. All the commotion by the announcers was for naught. Defense does not win fights, it allows you to win fights. The lack of offense in the latter rounds cost Alexander a win in a match that entered the books as a majority draw.\n\nIt’s a curious matchup of former world champions.\n\nPeter “Kid Chocolate” Quillin (33-1-1, 23 KOs) the former WBO middleweight titlist meets J’Leon Love (24-1-1, 13 KOs) in a super middleweight bout set for 10 rounds. It’s another intriguing fight especially between two fighters with great personalities.\n\nQuillin, 35, was ambushed by Daniel Jacobs in the first round a year ago in losing the title. Was it bad luck, age or both? As a fighter the Brooklyn-based prizefighter has a ton of followers who like him as a person. Few are as classy as Quillin.\n\nLove, 30, has long been a mainstay in Las Vegas and since his amateur days his abilities have been touted. Throughout the years Love has shown that charm and friendliness can go a long ways, even in the bitter wars of prizefighting. But the time has come to see if he belongs in the prizefighting world. Quillin will present an immense challenge for Love.\n\nA number of other interesting fights are slated to take place among former world champions including Sergey Lipinets who lost the super lightweight title to Mikey Garcia this past winter. There’s also Luis Collazo in a welterweight match.\n\nOne world title fight does take place on the card.\n\nFemale WBA super middleweight titlist Alicia Napoleon (9-1) makes the first defense of her title against Scotland’s Hannah Rankin (5-1). It’s a 10 round bout and the first time Napoleon defends the title since winning it last March against Germany’s Femke Hermans. Ironically, Hermans now has the WBO super middleweight title after defeating former champ Nikki Adler by decision this past May.\n\nL.A. Congestion\n\nNext week the city of Angels will be packed with three fight cards in four days.\n\nFirst, on Wednesday Aug. 8, 360 Promotions stages Abraham Lopez (9-1-1, 3 KOs) versus Gloferson Ortizo (12-0-1, 6 KOs) in the main event at the Avalon Theater in Hollywood, Calif. This is Filipino fighter Ortizo’s ninth fight this year. You read that correctly.\n\nAll of Ortizo’s fights have taken place across the border in Tijuana. The 32-year-old now returns to California against another Californian in Lopez. He’ll be looking for his fourth consecutive knockout, but Lopez, 22, has not lost a fight since his pro debut. Inactivity might come into play for Lopez who hasn’t stepped in the boxing ring in over a year.\n\nNew York’s Brian Ceballo (3-0) returns in a six round welterweight bout against local fighter Tavorus Teague (5-20-4). Ceballo, who is promoted by 360 Promotions, looked good in his last appearance. The amateurish punches seen in his first two bouts were gone by his third pro fight. His opponent Teague has ability and can give problems if Ceballo takes his foot off the pedal.\n\nOne of Gennady “GGG” Golovkin’s training partners Ali Akhmedov (11-0, 8 KOs) makes his California debut when he meets Jorge Escalante (9-1-1, 6 KOs) in a light heavyweight match.\n\nFemale super lightweight Elvina White (2-0) is also slated to compete. The entire fight card will be streamed at www.360promotions.us and on the 360 Promotions page on Facebook. First bell rings at 6:15 p.m.\n\nBelasco Theater in downtown L.A. is the site of Golden Boy Promotions fight card on Friday Aug. 10. A pair of young prospects will be severely tested.\n\nSan Diego’s Genaro Gamez (8-0, 5 KOs) meets Filipino fighter Recky Dulay (10-3, 7 KOs) for the vacant NABF super featherweight title. For Dulay it’s always kill or be killed. Five of his last fights have ended in knockout wins or losses.\n\nGamez, 23, seems to thrive under pressure and broke down two veterans in back-to-back fights at Fantasy Springs Casino. Now he returns to the Belasco, a venue where he has struggled in the past. But this time he’s the main event.\n\nAnother being severely tested will be Emilio Sanchez (15-1, 10 KOs) facing veteran Christopher Martin (30-10-3, 10 KOs) who is capable of beating anyone.\n\nSanchez, 24, lost by knockout in his last fight this past March. He’s talented and fearless and one mistake cost him his first loss as a pro. He’s not getting a break against Martin, a cagey fighter who has upset many young rising prospects in the past. Martin also has experience against world champions. It’s an extremely tough matchup for Sanchez.\n\nThe fight card will be televised by Estrella TV beginning at 6 p.m.\n\nWorld Title Fight\n\nOn Saturday, boxing returns to the Avalon Theater in Hollywood.\n\nThe main event is a good one as Puerto Rico’s Jesus Rojas (26-1-2, 19 KOs) defends the WBA featherweight world title against Southern California’s Jojo Diaz (26-1) in a 12 round clash. It’s power versus speed.\n\nRojas, 31, is one tough customer. When he took the interim title against Claudia Marrero last year he chased down the speedy southpaw Dominican and blasted him out in the seventh round. Several months earlier he obliterated another Golden Boy prospect, Abraham Lopez (not the same Abraham Lopez that is fighting on the 360 Promotions card), in eight rounds. Now he has the title and defends against the speedy southpaw Diaz.\n\nDiaz, 25, just recently lost a bid for the WBC featherweight title against Gary Russell Jr. Though he lost by decision three months ago, that fight might be easy in comparison to this challenge against Rojas.\n\nThe former Olympian won’t be able to take a breath against the Puerto Rican slugger who is about as rough as they come.\n\nTwo more undefeated Golden Boy prospects get a chance to eliminate each other when Philadelphia’s Damon Allen (15-0-1) meets East L.A.’s Jonathan Navarro (14-0, 7 KOs) in a super lightweight fight set for 10 rounds.\n\nPhillie versus East LA is like fire versus fire in the boxing ring. Boxers originating from those two hard-bitten areas usually have go-for-broke styles that result in pure action. Allen versus Navarro should not disappoint.\n\nAllen, 25, is not a hard puncher but he’s aggressive and like most Philadelphia fighters, he’s not afraid to mix it up.\n\nNavarro, 21, lives in East L.A. but trains in Riverside under Robert Garcia. He’s slowly finding his timing and will be facing the fastest fighter since his pro debut in 2015.\n\nOthers featured on the card will be Hector Tanajara, Aaron McKenna and Ferdinand Kerobyan.\n\nThe card will be streamed on the Golden Boy Fight Night page on Facebook beginning at 6 p.m.\n\nCheck out more boxing news on video at The Boxing Channel\n\nTo comment on this article at The Fight Forum, CLICK HERE.\n\nPost Views: 0\n\nManny Pacquiao isn’t quite ready to retire, and more big-money fights against high-level competition seem to be on the 39-year-old’s way.\n\n“I feel like I’m a 27-year-old,” Pacquiao told GMAnetwork.com’s Jamil Santos last week. “Expect more fights to come.”\n\nPacquiao (60-7-2, 39 KOs) looked exceptionally sharp in his seventh-round knockout win over former junior welterweight titleholder Lucas Matthysse on July 15 at Axiata Arena in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was Pacquiao’s best performance in at least four years, netting Pacquiao a secondary world title at welterweight along with a slew of renewed public interest in the boxing superstar’s career.\n\nBut what comes next for the only fighter in the history of boxing to capture world titles in eight different weight classes? TSS takes a detailed look at the potential opponents for one of the sport’s most celebrated stars.\n\nCream of the Crop\n\nPacquiao looked good enough against Matthysse to suggest he’d make a viable candidate to face either Terence Crawford or Vasyl Lomachenko next. Crawford is ranked No. 2 on the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board’s pound-for-pound list while Lomachenko slots at No. 1.\n\nWhile Pacquiao is no longer under contract with longtime promoter Bob Arum at Top Rank, most industry insiders expect he will continue working with Arum’s team in some capacity so long as his career keeps moving forward. Pacquiao started his own promotional venture, MP Promotions, to co-promote the Matthysse bout with Oscar De La Hoya, but Top Rank was still involved in the fight which is why the bout ended up streaming on ESPN+.\n\nTop Rank’s two hottest commodities at the present are Ring Magazine and WBA lightweight champ Lomachenko and welterweight titlist Crawford. Both are highly-regarded, multi-division world titleholders in the primes of their careers who are universally considered the top fighters in boxing.\n\nLomachenko and Crawford would each present a unique set of problems for Pacquiao stylistically. Of the two, Pacquiao probably matches up best with Lomachenko at this point in his career. Crawford (33-0, 24 KOs) is much larger and heavier than both Pacquiao and Lomachenko, and unless Pacquiao just really wants to test himself against someone incredibly dangerous, it’d probably be best for Team Pacquiao to avoid fighting Crawford at all costs. Crawford would be a heavy favorite against Pacquiao and most boxing insiders don’t believe this version of Pacquiao could compete with Crawford.\n\nLomachenko (11-1, 9 KOs) is naturally smaller than Pacquiao and has never fought above 135 pounds. If Pacquiao could lure Lomachenko to 140 pounds or above, he’d find himself in a winnable fight against a top-notch opponent. Lomachenko would probably be the slight favorite based on age alone but Pacquiao’s power and athleticism would give him a realistic chance to pull the upset.\n\nOther Notable Possibilities\n\nFormer junior welterweight titleholder Amir Khan has long been angling for a bout against Pacquiao. Khan faces Samuel Vargas on Sept. 8 in another comeback bout against lower level competition. Khan (32-4, 20 KOs) bravely moved up to middleweight to fight Canelo Alvarez in 2016 but was knocked out in the sixth round. He left the sport for a spell but returned to boxing in February as a welterweight with a sensational first round knockout win over Phil Lo Greco. A win over Vargas puts Khan in good position to secure a bout with Pacquiao, and the fight is a reasonable move by both camps. Pacquiao would probably be the heavy favorite, but Khan’s speed and long reach give him a decent chance to pull the upset.\n\nFormer welterweight titleholder Jeff Horn won a controversial decision over Pacquiao last year in Australia. The bout grabbed huge ratings for ESPN and there have been many debates since it happened as to which fighter truly deserved the nod from the judges. Horn (18-1-1, 12 KOs) doesn’t possess elite level talent, but he’s huge compared to Pacquiao and fights with such ferocity that the two can’t help but make an aesthetically pleasing fight together. Pacquiao would be the heavy favorite to defeat Horn if the two fight again.\n\nPacquiao vs. PBC fighters?\n\nBoxing’s current political climate and the ongoing battle of promoters and television networks for the hearts and minds of boxing fans usually leaves many compelling fights between top level stars off the table. Fighters promoted by Top Rank and Golden Boy are almost never able to secure bouts with fighters signed to Al Haymon to appear under the Premier Boxing Champions banner and vice versa. But Pacquiao’s free agent status opens up new and interesting possibilities for the fighter to pursue noteworthy PBC fighters.\n\nThere had been lots of chatter about Pacquiao facing Mikey Garcia next. Garcia (39-0, 30 KOs) has been decimating competition at both lightweight and junior welterweight. Garcia is considered by most experts to be one of the top 10 pound-for-pound fighters in the sport. He’s the TBRB junior welterweight champion and a unified lightweight titleholder (WBC, IBF). While Garcia is hoping to land a big money bout against IBF welterweight titleholder Errol Spence, most boxing experts believe the jump up to 147 pounds would be too much for the diminutive Garcia who began his career at featherweight. A better welterweight target for Garcia would be Pacquiao who also began his career in a much lower weight class.\n\nSpence (24-0, 21 KOs) is probably the best of the PBC welterweights. He’s considered by many to be on par with Crawford at 147 so it would be an incredibly dangerous bout for Pacquiao to go after at this point in his career. But Spence is aggressive and fights in a style that Pacquiao traditionally matches up very well against. Spence would be the favorite based on size, age and skill.\n\nSlightly less dangerous to Pacquiao would be facing the winner of the Sept. 8 battle between Danny Garcia and Shawn Porter. Garcia (34-1, 20 KOs) and Porter (28-2-1, 17 KOs) are fighting for the vacant WBC welterweight title and the possibility of capturing another world title in his career could sway Pacquiao to seek out the winner. Pacquiao could find himself a slight favorite or underdog depending on which of the two fighters he would face, but both would be winnable fights.\n\nThe WBA welterweight champion is Keith Thurman. Thurman (28-0, 22 KOs) is a good boxer with tremendous power but Pacquiao’s speed and athleticism would probably give him the leg up in that potential matchup. Thurman hasn’t fought in over 16 months though and recent pictures suggest he’s not in fighting shape at the moment, so the likelihood of a Pacquiao vs. Thurman fight is pretty much nil.\n\nSome fans want Pacquiao to face Adrien Broner. Broner (33-3-1, 24 KOs) is a solid contender at 147 but probably doesn’t have the skill to seriously compete with Pacquiao. Pacquiao would be a significant favorite and would likely stop Broner if the two were able to meet in a boxing ring.\n\nMayweather-Pacquiao 2?\n\nPacquiao lost a unanimous decision to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2015, but the circumstances surrounding the fight, and the fact it was the biggest box office bash in the history of the sport, have led many to suspect the two fighters would meet again in a rematch.\n\nYes, Mayweather (50-0, 27 KOs) is retired, but he’s unretired several times in his career for big money fights including last year’s crossover megafight with UFC star Conor McGregor. While it seems unlikely to happen, Mayweather-Pacquiao 2 would still be a huge worldwide event worth millions of dollars to both fighters so those following the sport can never say never to the idea of it happening again.\n\nWhile Mayweather is 41, he’d still get the nod as the betting favorite should he fight Pacquiao again based on what happened in the first fight as well as his stylistic advantage over Pacquiao.\n\nPacquiao vs. McGregor?\n\nMcGregor’s bout against Mayweather last year was such a financial success and the MMA star made so much more money in the boxing ring than he did as a UFC fighter that the idea of him returning to the sport to face Pacquiao isn’t as far-fetched as one might think.\n\nPacquiao vs. McGregor would be an easy sell to the general public. According to CompuBox, McGregor landed more punches against Mayweather than did Pacquiao, and the general consensus is that Mayweather-McGregor was more fun to watch than Mayweather-Pacquiao.\n\nThe size difference between the two would lead to an easy promotion. McGregor is a junior middleweight and Pacquiao has only competed at the weight once back in 2010. Despite all that, Pacquiao would be a significant favorite to defeat McGregor and rightly so. He’s too fast and too good a boxer, and his aggressive style would likely lead to a stoppage win.\n\nPacquiao’s Top Targets\n\nPacquiao’s top targets should be Mayweather, McGregor and Lomachenko. Pacquiao would stand to make the most money facing either Mayweather or McGregor. Pacquiao’s reportedly injured shoulder heading into 2015 bout left many wondering how the fight might be different had the Filipino gone into things at his best, and Mayweather’s age might play more of a factor in the second fight than it did in the first. A Pacquiao-McGregor fight would be a worldwide spectacle, one Pacquiao would be heavily favored to win. Besides, it’d be interesting to see if Pacquiao could stop McGregor sooner than historical rival Mayweather. Finally, Lomachenko might be trying to climb up weight classes too fast, and Pacquiao would certainly be fit to test the validity of that theory. It’d be one of the biggest fights in boxing and a win for Pacquiao would be another huge feather in the cap of one of boxing’s true historically great champions.\n\nCheck out more boxing news on video at The Boxing Channel\n\nTo comment on this article at The Fight Forum, CLICK HERE.\n\nPost Views: 0"
