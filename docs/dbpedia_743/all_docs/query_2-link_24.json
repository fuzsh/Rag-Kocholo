        "text": "A FLAME OF PURE FIRE\n\nJack Dempsey and the Roaring 20's\n\nBy Roger Kahn\n\nIllustrated. 474 pages. Harcourt Brace & Company. $28.\n\nJack Dempsey, the brutal ''Manassa Mauler'' of the 1920's, not only helped make boxing a big-time sport, but he also helped turn sports into a big business. He belonged, along with Babe Ruth, Red Grange, Bobby Jones and Johnny Weissmuller, to the so-called golden age of sports, and he is remembered to this day for his unaccommodated ferocity in the ring. Red Smith hailed him as ''a tiger without mercy'' and ''187 pounds of unbridled violence.'' Joyce Carol Oates described him as ''the very embodiment of hunger, rage, the will to do hurt; the spirit of the Western frontier come East to win his fortune.''\n\nIn his new authorized biography, ''A Flame of Pure Fire,'' Roger Kahn gives us a kinder, gentler Dempsey. Although Mr. Kahn -- a friend of the fighter, who died in 1983 -- talks of Dempsey's ''snarling intensity'' in the ring, he also deems him ''a cold professional, a gorgeous craftsman.'' Mr. Kahn's Dempsey sometimes sounds more like his famous rival, the bookish Gene Tunney. He describes Dempsey as ''a thinking, even intellectual, boxer'' and observes that his diaries reveal ''a thoughtful, introspective young man, and in a sense, the champion as existentialist.''\n\nIn addition Mr. Kahn tries to argue in this book that Dempsey ''all by himself'' symbolized ''America in the Roaring 20's.'' ''Dempsey's great years, across the bounding and increasingly unzippered days from 1919 to 1927, play in a grand sense against a wild American epoch,'' he writes. ''Prohibition was wild and the suddenly fast-and-loose stock market was wild and down the road two great show trials blossomed wildly into causes, still well remembered.''\n\nThere are two problems with this premise. In the first place Dempsey is a somewhat dubious representative figure. Yes, he embodied fame and glamour and the raucous, restless temper of the times, but then so did a host of others. Second, Mr. Kahn's determination to open out Dempsey's story into something larger causes him to lard the boxer's tale with dozens of panoramic asides, reminiscent of Frederick Lewis Allen's ''Only Yesterday.'' These asides -- about everything from Sacco and Vanzetti to Warren G. Harding, from women's suffrage to Prohibition -- have little to do with Dempsey, and they end up feeling irrelevant and pretentious.\n\nWhen Mr. Kahn sticks to Dempsey's story and controls his own taste for romance-novel prose (''Trouble was dark-haired and gorgeous''), the results are decidedly better. Mr. Kahn succinctly sketches in Dempsey's peripatetic and impoverished childhood in Colorado and Utah and his hardscrabble adolescence working in the mines and riding the rails.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
