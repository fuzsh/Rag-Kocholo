        "text": "It’s In The Details’\n\nTitle Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney Transfers Year 1927\n\nSize 1″ x 1 1/2″ (approximately) / 6″ x 9″ for full sheet Images Color\n\nType Stamps Number in Set\n\n20\n\n1927 Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney Transfers Set Overview\n\nThis unclassified stamp/transfer set is largely unknown aside from perhaps early boxing collectors. Even though the transfers feature two American boxers, the set was actually produced in Germany.\n\nA total of 20 stamps were in the set. They were initially distributed in unperforated sheets, though you can often find individual transfers on their own. These are called by stamps and transfers by collectors, but ‘transfers’ is most appropriate.\n\nThese stamps are full color and feature pictures of boxers Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney. The subject matter of the set is a boxing match between the pair. In particular, the set references the famous ‘Long Count’ fight. A header was at the top of these transfer sheets with the ‘Fight of the Century’ moniker that was given to this match because ofits importance. Because of that, it can conclusively be dated to no earlier than 1927 — the year that fight happened. While an exact date is not printed on them, the transfers are generally considered to be a 1927 issue.\n\nDempsey and Tunney fought both in 1926 and 1927 with Tunney winning both times. But Tunney was only knocked down in the 1927 bout and, as a transfer in this set pictures that, we know these represent the later fight.\n\nThe transfers included various pictures of the fight. In addition to the action poses, there are portrait images of both. Headers included writing that was both presented normally but also backwards. The backwards writing, of course, was done for transfer issues so that the text would display correctly when used since the image would be reversed when applied.\n\nWhile there are 20 individual transfers two pairs of them clearly belong together to form one longer transfer.\n\nOne transfer reads, ‘Dempsey is Pushed’ and the other next to it reads, ‘Against the Ropes.’ Another set has transfers that read, ‘Tunney on the Floor to’ and ‘The Count of Nine.’ The pictures on those individual transfers join together to form a longer one, as shown here.\n\nIn addition to this transfers set, a similar set was also created for baseball players. The boxing transfers are generally a little easier to find than the baseball set.\n\nFull sheets of the boxing set are not too expensive, often selling for about $100 or less.\n\n1927 Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney Transfers Checklist\n\nAgainst the Ropes\n\nDempsey Delivers Blow to the Right Eye\n\nDempsey Hits Left to the Jaw\n\nDempsey is Pushed\n\nDempsey Getting Careful\n\nDempsey Lands Blow to the Heart\n\nDempsey Takes the Offensive\n\nDempsey’s Face is Covered with Blood\n\nDempsey’s Power is Broken\n\nGene Tunney\n\nJack Dempsey\n\nThe Count of Nine\n\nThe Fight is Getting Hot\n\nThe Fighters in a Clinch\n\nThey Shake Hands\n\nTunney Delivers Right to the Liver\n\nTunney Knocked Down to the Count of Nine\n\nTunney on the Floor to\n\nTunney Takes Cover\n\nTunney Victorious!\n\nFollow Pre-War Cards on Twitter and also be sure to like our page on Facebook."
