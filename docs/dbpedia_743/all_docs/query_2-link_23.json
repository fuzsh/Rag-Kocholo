I'm new here and have a question concerning our Jack Dempsey.\n\nThis fish belongs to my daughter who recently married and moved FAR from home (1200 miles to be exact). He is about 7\" long...maybe 8 years old and living in a 50 gallon tank with an undergravel filter. He eats mostly pellets and dried shrimp, although we keep live guppys with him continuously. He rarely eats them.\n\nSo, I'm looking for a new home for this fish, but he is in a borrowed tank and it's hard to find someone who will take him locally. One fellow said he has a very large tank with some Wide Mouth bass (about 12-14\"?) in size. I am concerned that the bass will beat up on the JD or eat him.\n\nI am not at all familure with taking care of this fish and don't know what is the best thing to do. I feed him and keep the water balanced, but other than that, I'm a novice.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Would you put this fish with a large mouth bass--twice his size? My gut says no.\n\ntomahawk\n\nFeeder Fish\n\nFeb 2, 2012\n\n72\n\n1\n\n8\n\nConnecticut\n\n#2\n\nI think the bass would eat the JD in no time - they eat sunfish and other fish roughly the same size.\n\nAlso, bear in mind that the Largemouth Bass is a cooler water fish - likely more comfortable in 60-70F water. I dont think the JD would not like that at all.\n\nSent from my iPad using MonsterAquariaNetwork app\n\nMTBjake\n\nJack Dempsey\n\nDec 12, 2011\n\n1,513\n\n5\n\n36\n\nMenifee, Ca\n\n#3\n\nA 12\" lmb would QUICKLY make a meal out of that JD. Don't do it.\n\nSent from my iPhone using MonsterAquariaNetwork app\n\nfarraway1\n\nFeeder Fish\n\nJan 2, 2013\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nOhio\n\n#4\n\nThank you so much for the replies! I had a feeling it wouldn't be a good idea.\n\nBelly up\n\nPiranha\n\nSep 19, 2008\n\n637\n\n169\n\n76\n\nWolverine, MI\n\n#5\n\nWhy not keep him? If you do you will find Jack Dempsies are one of the easiest fish on the planet to have. They can tolerate a wide range of water conditions and many have good personalities.\n\nfarraway1\n\nFeeder Fish\n\nJan 2, 2013\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nOhio\n\n#6\n\nA am strongly considering keeping him. He's no bother to me. Maybe I'll change my mind the first time I have to do a tank clean-out.\n\nAquanero\n\nGlobal Moderator\n\nFeb 16, 2009\n\n10,324\n\n528\n\n1,101\n\nNew Jersey\n\n#7\n\nBasicly all you really need to do is a weekly water change of between 25 & 50% (when it comes to water changes more is better). Keep the filter clean, a once a month cleanning should suffice. If the UG filter is all the tank has I would suggest adding a Hang on the back type filter to the set up otherwise if the fish lived 8 years sombody's been doing somthing right so just keep it, sounds like you kind a like already anyway.\n\nfarraway1\n\nFeeder Fish\n\nJan 2, 2013\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nOhio\n\n#8\n\nThanks everyone! What is the life expectancy of a Jack Depsey? A 50 gal tank is sufficient for a fish this size, correct? I have no plans to increase the tank size, so if not, then I do need to find a better home for him.\n\nMTBjake\n\nJack Dempsey\n\nDec 12, 2011\n\n1,513\n\n5\n\n36\n\nMenifee, Ca\n\n#9\n\nThanks everyone!

Good luck with him. &#128077; I'm glad you're gonna hang on to him.\n\nSent from my iPhone using MonsterAquariaNetwork app"
