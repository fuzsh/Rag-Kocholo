        "text": "HESPERIA — Valerie Leighton said she’s heard rumors that her grandfather’s boxing championship belt is currently in the High Desert.\n\nThis is just not any belt. It belonged to one of the most iconic figures of the 1920s, Jack Dempsey. Dempsey reigned as king of the heavyweight division from 1919 to 1926 as his bouts shattered prizefighting attendance records.\n\nLeighton said the man she simply knows as “Poppy” purchased property in Hesperia in the 1950s, and partnered with M. Penn Phillips to build the Hesperia Inn and golf course. A Jack Dempsey Museum would later follow in a back room of the Western Arcade, featuring countless pieces of memorabilia from Dempsey’s glory days.\n\nBut years after the museum’s closure, Leighton’s mother was forced to sell various items from Dempsey’s collection, including the heavyweight championship belt.\n\n“I was left with a pair of his boxing shoes that he fought in, one of his money clips and a bunch of photos,” she said. “I just want to know what happened to that title. It’s such a personal item that I would love to be able to see it if I can’t have it. I would love to be able to have it back, just because of the sentimental value, but I imagine the belt must be worth a significant amount of money. Unfortunately my mom had to get rid of a bunch of things to live. I can’t blame her, but I really wish that was never sold.”\n\nLeighton said she never really understood how much of an icon \"Poppy\" was until she grew older. To her he was just a sweet man who would never be caught dead in casual clothes. Dempsey always wore a suit and had a cigar in his mouth until his death in 1983.\n\nLeighton now lives in Hesperia, but she grew up in the San Fernando Valley and remembers Dempsey painting her family’s house in his suit with his shirt sleeves rolled up and his customary cigar in his mouth.\n\nGrowing up, Leighton had a hard time believing the man who would dirty the entire kitchen as he made fudge had also won 51 professional fights by knockout and was nicknamed \"The Manassa Mauler.\" Dempsey won 65 fights, lost six, had 11 draws and one no contest.\n\n“Poppy was the sweetest man you could ever meet,” Leighton said. “He was a very generous and giving man. Nobody ever said anything bad about him. Although New York was home and his main base, Hesperia was near-and-dear to him. He fell in love with the area, purchased his property and partnered with Mr. Phillips.”\n\nThe two built the once-lavish Hesperia Inn and golf course, which attracted A-list celebrities at the time.\n\nBut according to local historian Griz Drylie, once Phillips left in the 1960s, the area lost its luster. Drylie’s wife, Shelly, owned and operated her restaurant Shelly’s Place in the same building that housed the museum. Drylie confirmed the details Leighton shared of Dempsey’s days in Hesperia.\n\nDempsey died of natural causes at the age of 87 in his apartment in New York, but his legend lives on.\n\nIn 2014, Dempsey was inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame and Leighton was invited to accept the honor for him. Dempsey was inducted under the “Pioneer Class” along with Archie Moore. Other fighters who were inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame last year were George Foreman, Evander Holyfield and Roberto Duran.\n\n“I’ll tell you one thing, that Duran fell in love with Valerie,” said her husband, Jerry Leighton. “He was infatuated with her; he wouldn’t leave her alone and he was kissing her arm.”\n\nLeighton laughed as she shared her experiences with the boxing greats. The award now sits on top of her big-screen television. She still doesn't have that title belt, but she has hope that it's out there — maybe somewhere in the desert town that her grandfather helped put on the map.\n\nJose Quintero can be reached at 760-256-4122 or JQuintero@DesertDispatch.com.
