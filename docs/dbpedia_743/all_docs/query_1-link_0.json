        "text": "Nonpareil Jack Dempsey (born December 15, 1862, Curran, County Kildare, Ireland—died November 2, 1895, Portland, Oregon, U.S.) was an Irish-born American bare-knuckle fighter who was the world middleweight champion from 1884 to 1891.\n\n(Read Gene Tunney’s 1929 Britannica essay on boxing.)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nDempsey, who moved to the United States as a young child, was a proficient wrestler before he began his career as a boxer. For his first fight he gave his name as Jack Dempsey, and he fought under that name thereafter. (Fighting under an assumed name was not uncommon, as boxing was illegal and not entirely socially acceptable.) Years later a young heavyweight named William Harrison Dempsey paid tribute to the great bare-knuckle fighter by boxing under the same name, Jack Dempsey. Since two great fighters are known by this name, the first is also referred to by his ring name, the Nonpareil (“unequaled”).\n\nOnce Dempsey began boxing, in 1883, he turned professional almost immediately, winning the middleweight world championship against George Fulljames the following year. Dempsey was a clever, agile, skilled boxer who could adjust his style to his opponent. He did not lose a fight until 1889, and that was to George LaBlanche, who used a “pivot” punch that would soon be barred in boxing. Dempsey retained his title despite this loss, as LaBlanche was over the weight allowable for a middleweight. In fact, Dempsey frequently fought men who had a great weight advantage over him; during his career as a middleweight, he never weighed more than a welterweight."
