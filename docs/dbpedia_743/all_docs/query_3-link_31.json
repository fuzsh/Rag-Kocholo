He held the World Heavyweight Title in boxing from 1919 to 1926.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nHe would spend nights in hobo camps in his youth when he had no money. He won a handful of fights in the mining towns around Salt Lake City before going pro.\n\nTrivia\n\nHe became a member of The Ring magazine's Boxing Hall of Fame in 1951. One of his earliest fights, in Salt Lake City as a teenager, ended in a knockout, with him defeating his opponent with just one punch. His first big fight came on Independence Day in 1919, with him as the underdog, but earning a victory over world heavyweight champion Jess Willard to claim the title.\n\nFamily Life\n\nHe was married four times, and had three kids, one adopted.\n\nAssociated With"
