        "text": "Lt. Commander Jack Dempsey at the Manhattan Beach Coast Guard Training Facility now Kingsborough Community College.\n\nDuring World War II , former World Heavyweight Champion Jack Dempsey was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Coast Guard Reserve. He reported for active duty on 12 June 1942 at Coast Guard Training Station, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York, (Now Kingsborough Community College) where he was assigned as “Director of Physical Education.” He was promoted to lieutenant commander (temporary) in December 1942 and commander (temporary) in March of 1944.\n\nDamon Runyan nicknamed Dempsey the “Manassa Mauler” during the fighter’s first, unsuccessful trip to New York, in 1916.\n\nIn 1944 he was assigned to the transport USS Wakefield. In 1945 he was on the attack transport USS Arthur Middleton for the invasion of Okinawa.\n\nIn July of 1945 he assigned to the Commander, 11th Naval District for assignment to Military Morale Duty. In fact he even wrote a book about his time at the Manhattan Beach Coast Guard Training Station titled ” How to Fight Tough”.\n\n.\n\nHis orders: “Make ’em tough!” His task: to teach rookie Coast Guardsmen how to fight down and dirty in the face of the very real threat of enemy troops infiltrating American shores. Get in the ring with “the Manassa Mauler” as he gives 18 fully illustrated lessons in the art of bashing and brawling on the battlefield, including Subduing an Armed Enemy, The Unbreakable Strangle, Beating the Punch, Hammering Your Way\n\nJack Dempsey first started boxing professionally in 1914. He first started boxing under the name of “Kid Blacky” and later boxed under the name of the “Manassa Mauler” after his home town of Manassa, Colorado. Throughout the 1920’s and 1930’s he was extremely popular and is probably one of the most popular boxing champions of all times.\n\nJack Dempsey and Babe Ruth-two of the most famous athletes of the 1920’s and good friends at the Ansonia Hotel in NYC.\n\nSo when World War II rolled around he jumped at the chance to serve. He was first commissioned as a Lieutenant in the New York State Army National Guard, but he resigned and took a commission United States Coast Guard and would advance to the rank of Commander.\n\nEulance Peacock, member of the 1930 American Olympic Team and co-holder with Jesse Owens of the world’s 100-yard dash record, leads a class in sitting up exercises at Manhattan Beach Coast Guard training station.\n\nDempsey was made Director of Physical Education at The Coast Guards Manhattan Beach Training Facility in Brooklyn New York.\n\nInstead of just teaching physical fitness Dempsey taught the new recruits how to fight. He worked with B.J. Cosneck, who was the Coast Guards hand-to-hand combat expert and a college wrestling champion.\n\nDempsey and Cosneck would prepare the recruits to fight it out on the battlefield or in a barroom brawl. They would teach recruits self defense techniques from come-alongs to strangles. During his time with Cosneck, Dempsey would write his first book titled appropriately “How to Fight Tough.”\n\nPaul (Tiny) Wyatt, one-time leading contender for heavyweight boxing honors, sparring with Hart Kraeten, former Golden Gloves champ, at the Manhattan Beach Coast Guard station.\n\nThe book was easy to follow guide that told soldiers and sailors how to fight. It included boxing, wrestling, and jujutsu techniques. B.J. Cosneck would write his own book called American Combat Judo after the war which is also another less known but no less important work in the field of martial arts and close combat.\n\nManhattan Beach Coast Guard training station. Lou Ambers, former world’s lightweight champion, sparring with Marty Servo, well-known pro, as Eristus Sams, former Tuskegee football and track star, referees. All three are boxing instructors at the Manhattan Beach Coast Guard training station\n\nTraining countless sailors would have been enough for Dempsey to silence most critics, but while serving as a morale officer in the Pacific he would achieve heroic status.\n\nDuring the invasion of Okinawa the last Japanese strong hold before Japan Dempsey was serving on the attack transport USS Arthur Middleton as the morale officer which was a non-combat assignment.\n\nWhen Dempsey then age 49 saw men he trained going into combat he insisted he go along and join the fight. For that act he would make himself a Coast Guard hero. After the war he would continue to serve with Coast Guard Reserve until 1952. As a solider and a world class competitor, Dempsey understood the difference between sport combat and real combat, and made sure every man he trained knew it.\n\nStrangely, though, Mr. Dempsey’s popularity never approached its peak until he had lost the championship. He was reviled as a slacker during World War I, and although a jury exonerated him of a charge of draft-dodging, the odium clung to him until the night Gene Tunney punched him almost blind and took his title.\n\n”Lead me out there,” Jack told his trainer after that bout. ”I want to shake his hand.”\n\nBack in their hotel, Estelle Taylor Dempsey was appalled by her husband’s battered face. ”Ginsberg!” she cried, using her pet name for him. ”What happened?”\n\n”Honey,” the former champion said, ”I forgot to duck.” From that day on, the gallant loser was a folk hero whose fame never diminished. Almost 23 years after he lost the championship, he was having breakfast with friends in Chicago, where Ezzard Charles and Jersey Joe Walcott were to box the following night for his old title, left vacant by the retirement of Joe Louis. A stranger passing their table recognized the old champion.\n\nManhattan Beach Coast Guard training station. Boxing is compulsory in the four-week intensive course at Manhattan Beach Coast Guard training station. Lou Ambers, former world’s lightweight contender, show a class of enrollees how to lead and block punches.\n\n”Jack Dempsey!” he said, offering his hand. ”Oh, boy, Jack, do I know you! Do I remember how you gave it to Jack Willard back there in Toledo!” Leaning forward, he put his face close to Jack’s ear, and his voice dropped to a conspiratorial level. ”I hope you beat hell out of that guy tomorrow night,” he said and turned away.\n\nSpeechless for an instant, Mr. Dempsey stared after him. ”Well, I’ll be damned,” he said. ”He thinks I’m still champion!”\n\nTo many, Mr. Dempsey always remained the champion, and he always comported himself like one. He was warm and generous, a free spender when he had it and a soft touch for anybody down on his luck. After retirement from the ring, he made his headquarters in New York in Jack Dempsey’s Restaurant, first at the corner of 50th Street across Eighth Avenue from the old Madison Square Garden and later at 1619 Broadway, where his partner was Jack Amiel, whose colt, Count Turf, won the Kentucky Derby.\n\nAt almost any hour, Mr. Dempsey was on hand to greet friends and strangers with a cordial, ”Hiya, pal,” in a voice close to a boyish treble. (He wasn’t much better at remembering names than Babe Ruth, who called people ”kid.”) He posed for thousands of photographs with an arm around a customer’s shoulders or – if the customer preferred, and many males did -squared off face to face. Autographing tens of thousands of menus, he never scribbled an impersonal ”Jack Dempsey” but always took the trouble to write the recipient’s name and add ”good luck” or ”keep punching.” His ebullient good humor was even demonstrated against the occasional drunk who simply had to try out his Sunday punch on the old champion.\n\nGrantland Rice said Mr. Dempsey was perhaps the finest gentleman, in the literal sense of gentle man, he had met in half a century of writing sports; Mr. Dempsey never knowingly hurt anyone except in the line of business.\n\nJack Dempsey and Charlie Chaplin\n\nIn the ring, he was a tiger without mercy who shuffled forward in a bobbing crouch, humming a barely audible tune and punching to the rhythm of the song. He was 187 pounds of unbridled violence. That isn’t big by heavyweight standards, yet in the judgment of some, this black-browed product of Western mining camps and hobo jungles was the best of all pugilists. In 1950, a poll by The Associated Press named Mr. Dempsey the greatest fighter of the half-century.\n\nSeptember 15, 1923: Jack Dempsey/Babe Ruth/Christy Walsh\n\nCertainly nobody surpassed him in color and crowd appeal. He drew boxing’s first million-dollar gate in fighting Georges Carpentier, boxing’s largest paid attendance in his first bout with Tunney and the biggest ”live” gate in their second meeting. As champion, Tunney received $990,445 for the latter fight, which grossed $2,658,660. He gave Tex Rickard, the promoter, his personal check for $9,555 and Mr. Rickard wrote a check for $1 million, the biggest purse ever collected for a single performance in sports before the days of closed-circuit television.\n\nDempsey was less than two weeks past his 24th birthday but had been through more than 80 professional fights, some unrecorded, when he burst upon the championship scene like a mortar shell. It was July 4, 1919, a blistering day on the shore of Maumee Bay outside Toledo, Ohio. Awaiting the opening bell as challenger for the heavyweight title, the 6-foot-1-inch contender was tanned and fit at 187 pounds. But he looked no more than half the size of Jess Willard, the champion, a pale tract of meat measuring 6 feet 6 1/2 inches tall and weighing 245 pounds.\n\nThree minutes later Willard looked like a case for the coroner. He had been down seven times, and one left hook had broken his cheekbone in 13 places. Thinking the seventh knockdown had ended the fight, Dempsey and his manager, Jack (Doc) Kearns, left the ring but were called back.\n\nAfter two more rounds the helpless Willard was spared further damage when one of his seconds signaled surrender by throwing a towel into the ring.\n\nNow it was Dempsey, heavyweight champion of the world, and the bottom line of his record read: ”KO 3.” But the winner’s jubilation was tempered by the discovery that Mr. Kearns had bet $10,000 of their guarantee on a first-round knockout, taking odds of 10 to 1, and the remaining $17,500 had gone for ”training expenses,” an omnibus term in the manager’s lexicon.\n\nJoe Louis, Joe Frazier, and Jack Dempsey\n\nIn a ghost-written autobiography many years later, Mr. Kearns took partial credit for the destructive effect of his man’s punches. He wrote that he had used plaster-of-paris bandages on Dempsey’s hand and that these had hardened into casts inside the gloves after being doused with water. Dempsey denied that his gloves had been loaded, and the tale never won general acceptance because Doc Kearns was known to be a creative artist who seldom let truth spoil a good story.\n\nThe destruction of Willard convinced boxing men of the new champion’s greatness, but the public was slow to accept Dempsey because of his war record. Ostensibly doing essential work in a Philadelphia shipyard, he had posed for a news photograph holding a riveting gun and wearing overalls, with patent-leather shoes. The fancy footgear raised noisy doubts about his contribution to the war effort.\n\nMore than two years after the armistice, Mr. Rickard capitalized on this unfavorable publicity to build up the first million-dollar gate. Carpentier, the light-heavyweight champion, had been decorated in the French armed forces. When Mr. Rickard matched Dempsey with the Paris boulevardier in a wooden arena called Boyle’s 30 Acres in Jersey City, the ”hero” became a sentimental favorite over the ”slacker.” A crowd of 80,183 paid $1,789,238 to see Dempsey win by a knockout in the fourth round.\n\nHaving broken all financial records, Dempsey and Mr. Kearns proceeded to break the city of Shelby, Mont. After an oil strike near their small community, Shelby boosters gave way to delusions of grandeur and promised the champion $250,000 to defend his title against the light-hitting Tommy Gibbons. The promotion laid an egg, but Mr. Kearns collected the entire guarantee and had a locomotive and caboose waiting to rush the money and the champion’s party out of town as soon as Dempsey had won on points. Behind them, the banks that had put up the cash closed. Shelby had a hole in the seat of its civic breeches for a generation.\n\nTo those who saw it, the Dempsey-Firpo bout of 1923 was the most wildly exciting ever fought for the heavyweight title. Luis Angel Firpo of Argentina, unpolished and untamed, dazed the champion with a right to the jaw seconds after the opening bell. Only half-conscious, Dempsey dropped Firpo four times. Firpo knocked the champion into the press row, where reporters instinctively raised hands and shoved to protect themselves. Thus aided, Dempsey got back in the ring and put Firpo down once more before the bell. Two more knockdowns finished the Argentine in the second round.\n\nThe Firpo fight was Dempsey’s fifth title defense (he had knocked out Billy Miske and Bill Brennan before meeting Carpentier). Three years later he made his sixth and last against Tunney, the Shakespeare-loving veteran of the Marine Corps who had moved into heavyweight ranks after winning the American light-heavyweight championship, losing it and winning it back.\n\n”I never seed anything like it,” Mr. Rickard said, watching 120,757 customers crowd into the huge horseshoe in Philadelphia then called Sesquicentennial Stadium. The promoter had been told the fight would draw big in Philadelphia, but he had not dreamed what a stir it would make.\n\nDown in Maryland, for instance, was a racing official named Jim Milton. He was the starter when the Havre de Grace track opened in 1912, and when he retired half a century later he had started every race at that track except the last one on the program on Sept. 23, 1926. He left that to an assistant starter and caught a train for Philadelphia and the fight.\n\nMany years afterward Mr. Tunney was told about Mr. Milton’s only dereliction. ”He probably was betting on Dempsey,” he said. If he was, he lost. Jabbing and circling through a drenching rainstorm, Tunney won going away.\n\nOne day less than a year later, the pair met again in Soldier Field in Chicago in a match that would make Dave Barry the world’s most widely known referee. In the seventh round Tunney was knocked down for the first time in his life.\n\nGracious outside the ring, Dempsey in battle was no slave to the rules. Not many years ago, when Joe Frazier was champion, he was scandalized by films of Dempsey crouching over a fallen Firpo ready to slug him as he rose. ”That’s bad for boxing,” Frazier protested.\n\nWith Tunney on the floor, it did not occur to Dempsey to retire to a neutral corner until Barry stopped the count and led him across the ring. Returning, the referee started the count all over. Tunney got up at ”9” – it was established that he had had about 14 seconds to recuperate – and won a clear decision, scoring a knockdown in the eighth round. To this day, the Dempsey cult believes Tunney was saved by the long count; Tunney always insisted he was in full control throughout.\n\nThat was the last time around for Dempsey as a fighter of importance. Thirty-two years had passed since his birth on June 24, 1895, in Manassa, Colo., to Hyrum and Celia Dempsey, who had paused there with their brood on a meandering journey from Mudfork, W.Va. Manassa was only one of many stops for a nomadic family, but years later the fact that Mrs. Dempsey had given birth there inspired Damon Runyon, the sportswriter, to dub the new champion the Manassa Mauler.\n\nHyrum Dempsey was a tough, restless descendant of Irish immigrants who had quit a job as schoolteacher to venture west. There was a strain of Indian blood in both parents revealed in the baby’s blueblack hair and high cheekbones. They named him William Harrison Dempsey and called him Harry, but at 16 he went his own way and adopted his own names.\n\nThe first was Kid Blackie. For about three years he fought under that name in mountain mining camps. Between saloon bouts he worked in the mines, shined shoes, picked fruit and hustled, riding the rods on trains and sleeping in hobo jungles. Meanwhile, his older brother, Bernie, was boxing as Jack Dempsey, having borrowed the name of an oldtime middleweight known as ”the Nonpareil.” One night in Denver, Harry substituted for Bernie and was introduced as Jack Dempsey. The name stuck.\n\nHe was managed for a while by one Jack Price and later by John (the Barber) Reisler before he and Mr. Kearns became partners. They started slowly but picked up speed as they moved. By the time they reached Maumee Bay and the rendezvous with Willard, Dempsey’s record included 21 first-round knockouts. If any other puncher ever dealt such swift destruction to so many, the record books do not report it.\n\nWillard had won the championship in 1915 and defended it once in a 10-round no-decision match with Frank Moran in 1916. On Feb. 15, 1918, an item in The New York Times reported that Dempsey had knocked out Fireman Jim Flynn in one round, adding that Willard had agreed to meet the winner of a bout between Dempsey and Fred Fulton.\n\nThat bout took place on July 28, 1918. It lasted 23 seconds. One punch was thrown, a right by Dempsey. Fulton was counted out and his name entered in the long list of Dempsey’s victims -Gunboat Smith, Carl Morris, Bill Brennan, Billy Miske, Battling Levinsky, Arthur Pelkey. There wasn’t a heavyweight of repute Dempsey hadn’t beaten, except Willard.\n\nAfter taking care of that oversight, the new champion took his time about defending his title. In 1920 he took on two of his old victims, Miske and Brennan, and disposed of them. In 1921 he beat Carpentier, in 1922 he rested, and in 1923 he beat Tommy Gibbons and Firpo. Three years intervened before he fought again and lost to Tunney.\n\nLike John L. Sullivan, Jim Corbett and other champions before him, he gave the stage at least as much attention as he bestowed on the ring. He accepted a featured role on Broadway in a play called ”The Big Fight,” directed by David Belasco. The feminine lead was Estelle Taylor, his wife.\n\nIn his early days in the mining camps, he had been married to Maxine Gates, a saloon piano player, but not for long. Miss Taylor was a star of silent films whom he met in Hollywood. After their Broadway adventure, they went back to Hollywood and made a movie called ”Manhattan Madness,” which was also a disaster.\n\nBy this time Dempsey and his manager had fallen out. A series of suits and countersuits kept them in litigation right up to the Philadelphia match with Tunney in 1926. The distraction was no help to Dempsey in his preparation for the bout, but when he lost, he did not mention this as an excuse.\n\nHe had learned that fighters suffer many distractions. ”Some night,” he told a young boxer, ”you’ll catch a punch between the eyes and all of a sudden you’ll see three guys in the ring against you. Pick out the one in the middle and hit him, because he’s the one who hit you.”\n\nMr. Dempsey and Miss Taylor were divorced, and he married the singer Hannah Williams. They had two daughters, Joan in 1934 and Barbara in 1936. He and Miss Williams were divorced in 1943.\n\nIn 1958 he was married for the fourth time, to the former Deanna Piattelli, who survives. He later adopted her daughter from a previous marriage. She took the name Barbara Dempsey and helped him write his 1977 autobiography, ”Dempsey.”\n\nIn 1938 Mr. Dempsey was the first winner of the Edward J. Neil Memorial Plaque, awarded by the New York Boxing Writers Association to the man who had done the most for boxing that year. He was elected to the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1954. Except during World War II, when he enlisted in the Coast Guard and was commissioned a lieutenant commander, he remained identified with the ring, as a referee of boxing and wrestling and a participant in various promotions.\n\nIn the early days of Louis’ reign as champion, Mr. Dempsey lent his name and restaurant facilities to a ”white hope” tournament, a term that had survived in boxing long after its racial implications had evaporated. Dropping into Dempsey’s, John Lardner, the writer, saw a horde of young males devouring steak and chops.\n\n”Finest bunch of white hopes ever assembled,” the proprietor said proudly. ”What about him?” Mr. Lardner asked, indicating a husky young black in the middle of the pack. Mr. Dempsey fetched him a slap on the shoulder.\n\n”You got a good eye for a fighter,” he said. ”He’s the best prospect in the bunch.”\n\nCity University of New York Chancellor Robert J Kibbee, with glasses,looking on, in back at Groundbreaking of the new Kingsborough Community College Campus-President Leon M Goldstein and Brooklyn Borough President Sebastian Leone with shovels.-1974\n\nFrom personal memories and the New York Times-\n\nDr. Robert J. Kibbee, (Bob) to his friends and colleagues was one of those rare and special people who quietly make a huge difference in the world around them and I will always remember him with fondness and pride .\n\nHe unfortunately passed away much to young at the age of 60. His death, after a long illness, came two weeks before he was to retire from the post he had held for more than a decade as Chancellor of the City University of New York, a university he helped save for all of us.\n\nWhenever I pass by our college’s Kibbee Library or walk into it and see the small display of his life, lovingly curated and cared for by Tina Kopel , I think back to his many visits to KCC and his warm courtship of then KCC Professor, Margaret (Peg) Rockowitz and then later, Mrs. Robert J Kibbee.\n\nAs most of you might not be aware Bob Kibbee was the son of the very famous and wonderful actor Guy Kibbee, whose movies many of us grew up with.\n\nDr. Kibbee’s father the great character actor Guy Kibbee\n\nThis was a very heavy burden for a young man striking out on his own and Chancellor Kibbee would often tell humorous and entertaining stories of his father and his time in Hollywood.\n\nDr. Kibbee’s tenure as chancellor of the country’s third largest university coincided with one of the most painful eras of the institution, which was set up in 1961 through the amalgamation of the city’s various publicly supported colleges.\n\nThe second year of the controversial policy of open admissions, under which the City University admitted all city high school graduates who applied, was just beginning as he took over the leadership in 1971 from Dr. Albert H. Bowker, who became chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nDr. Kibbee, who had acquired most of his experience at selective private institutions, found himself called upon repeatedly to defend the City University from the attacks of critics. They charged that the university’s academic quality was being diluted to absorb thousands of freshmen who were inadequately prepared to enroll in an institution that until 1970 had maintained rigorous entrance requirements.\n\nIn his firm support for the university during those days of difficult transition, Dr. Kibbee showed the unflappable exterior that was to help him remain cool during the many crises that followed. Doing the Best You Can.\n\n”You start from the point that you think you know what you are trying to do,” Dr. Kibbee said in discussing his ability to withstand the pressures of that period. ”You do the best you can and recognize that everything is not going to happen the way you want it to happen. There is always tomorrow and you shouldn’t look on every setback as a disaster.”\n\nThe decade proved to be a difficult time for all of American higher education, and Dr. Kibbee ended up having to guide the City University through a series of financial difficulties. He frequently was called upon to use his patient style to arbitrate conflicts over budget reductions.\n\nA 10 percent cut in the institution’s $550 million budget during the 1975-76 academic year set the stage for a lengthy drama. Several campuses of the 20-unit system were threatened with extinction, the institution’s suppliers were not paid and the entire university finally closed for two weeks in May, just as final examinations were approaching. Reneging on a Commitment.\n\nTo Dr. Kibbee, the worst part of the crisis was having to dismiss 2,000 faculty members who had been awarded new contracts just six months earlier. ”We had a commitment to them and then we reneged,” he said several years later. ”It just wasn’t fair, but the financial problem didn’t allow any other solution.”\n\nThe price of getting the university reopened was the abandonment of its cherished free-tuition policy. Through it all, Dr. Kibbee was a central figure, successfully resisting proposals for a takeover by the State University of New York and not shying away from political infighting when he thought it necessary.\n\nThis was a portent, and during the middle and late 1970’s, Dr. Kibbee found himself increasingly honing skills more characteristic of a politican than of a scholar.\n\nHe was confronted by a Board of Higher Education whose members often appeared, at least to the chancellor’s supporters, to subordinate academic needs to political considerations, and he found the appointment of presidents for the university’s various campuses to be a matter of keen interest among elected officeholders who were not averse to trying to influence the selection process.\n\nIn 1981, Dr. Kibbee announced that he would retire from the chancellorship , giving the trustees 14 months to find his successor. Although he had undergone cranial surgery several months earlier, he said the state of his health was not a factor in his decision, explaining: ”I’m not as active and agile as when I came here, but I’m 10 years older.”\n\nThe search for Dr. Kibbee’s successor, which began when he announced his retirement, was within days of completion at the time of his death.\n\nDr. Kibbee was a pragmatist who resisted efforts to cast his role as chancellor in philosophical terms. ”It’s always nice to think of yourself as the academic chieftain of an intellectually oriented body,” he said. ”But it costs money and takes buildings and equipment to have a university. This is the responsibility of the chief executive, and if you’re not willing to accept it, then you should stay out of this business.”\n\nOpponents were often bemused and frustrated by Dr. Kibbee’s seemingly bland approach. The president of one of the university’s units theorized that the only signals that the stolid Dr. Kibbee, a rumpled six-footer, ever gave of his perturbance were a few extra puffs from his omnipresent pipe.\n\nEven when his independence provoked both the Governor and the Mayor to seek his ouster, Dr. Kibbee remained mostly taciturn, accepting criticism in silence or, at most, delivering one of the dry witticisms that were one of his trademarks.\n\n”If you can live long enough, you will outlast your critics,” he said to close associates on several occasions when the university faced adversity.\n\nA lack of effusiveness, however, did not mean Dr. Kibbee was insensitive. He held fierce loyalties, was quick to voice compassion and was always among the first to commiserate with colleagues suffering personal problems.\n\nDr. Kibbee’s background may have helped develop his empathy with others. He was born on Aug. 19, 1921, on Staten Island, and his parents separated when he was a small boy. He carried both the blessing and the burden of growing up as the son of a famous father, Guy Kibbee, the actor.\n\nHis mother moved the family to Manhattan’s West Side, and the young Bob Kibbee became an inveterate New Yorker. He attended Xavier High School and went on to earn his bachelor’s degree at Fordham University, where the show-business connections established through his father won him a reputation for being able to get his friends into concerts by the popular big bands.\n\nHe went into the Army after his graduation from Fordham in 1943 and was serving in an antiaircraft unit in the Phillipines when World War II ended in 1945.\n\nAfter his military discharge, Dr. Kibbee attended the University of Chicago, earning a master’s degree in 1947 in educational administration. His involvement in a lengthy study of higher education in Arkansas led to an appointment as a dean at Southern State College in that state.\n\nIn 1955, Dr. Kibbee moved to Drake University in Iowa as dean of students. He also resumed his studies at the University of Chicago, earning a doctorate in higher educational administration in 1957. He became an educational advisor in Pakistan.\n\nDr. Kibbee left Drake the following year to represent the University of Chicago as an educational adviser in Pakistan, a job that expanded to a three-year assignment and included membership on a committee that redesigned the country’s educational system.\n\nHe returned to the United States in 1961, joining the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh as assistant to the president, John C. Warner, whom he had known as one of the other consultants in Pakistan. In 1965, Dr. Kibbee was promoted to vice president and continued in a similar position after a merger that created Carnegie-Mellon University.\n\nDr. Kibbee was a surprise choice to head the City University, an institution unlike any with which he had been associated during his academic career.\n\nDespite the public exposure associated with the $69,100 ( what a difference from todays salaries)-a-year job, he maintained a very private personal life, and few of those who worked closely with him were aware of his interest in the ballet or the enjoyment he derived from an occasional round of golf. Making Private Life Public\n\nDr. Kibbee himself took the initiative on one of the few occasions when his personal life became public. In 1973, he sent letters to each of the campus presidents in the City University and to the members of the Board of Higher Education telling of his separation from his wife, the former Katherine Kirk.\n\nHe was remarried in the spring of 1980 to Margaret Rockwitz, a faculty member at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn. The marriage took place while Dr. Kibbee was convalescing from cranial surgery for the removal of a tumor that was reportedly nonmalignant. He returned to work that spring, but even a year later still looked drawn and did not appear to have regained his former vigor.\n\nIn a commencement address he never got a chance to deliver, the week before he died, Dr. Kibbee counseled the graduating class at Brooklyn College to be humble and compassionate and to ”temper your judgments to the limit of your knowledge.” He did not appear at the commencement because of his declining health; his address was read to the 2,900 graduates at the Flatbush campus by Jerald Posman, a vice chancellor.\n\nDr. Kibbee, stressing to the graduates that the only advantage he had over them was longevity, said that ”what I have learned by living is that there is too much arrogance, simple-mindedness and indifference in the world.”\n\nRobert Kibbee was a great and true friend to Kingsborough and to CUNY and was one of the key men responsible for saving the City University of New York, that is why I am so very proud every time I pass the magnificent Library named in his honor on our campus."
