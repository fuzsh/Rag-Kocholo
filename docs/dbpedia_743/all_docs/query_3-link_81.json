        "text": "By Victor Cota\n\nBoxing history books say that on afternoon of July 4, 1919, the greatest moment of Toledo, Ohio transpired, as Jack Dempsey conquered the world heavyweight championship, massacring the then champion, his compatriot Jess Willard, a giant who was more than 2 meters tall.\n\nAs Dempsey landed tremendously powerful, resounding blows on his rival he was cheered at the Bay View Park. The historic match was promoted by another powerful, flamboyant and vivid character, Tex Rickard, who`s comparable with current promoters Don King and Bob Arum.\n\nDempsey, became a beloved idol of the United States during the “Roaring Twenties.” He was the first boxer who managed to earn more than a million dollars at the box office, when there was no television or other forms of entertainment transmission, quite unlike the many of who nowadays publicize events in a blaze of spin bluster.\n\nAnother tremendous fanfare when he faced Frenchman Georges “Orchid Kid” Carpentier, defending the crown that he had conquered in such devastating fashion. Another tremendous early ending.\n\nFrom that moment, Jack could be consideres (as commented on several occasions by Don José Sulaimán, who was an avid admirer of this great champion) as number one attraction of the ring, as the fans eagerly paid huge amounts of money to see him fight, relishing each and every actions packed minute.\n\nUnder this premise and subsequent proven facts, we convincingly consider that William Harrison Dempsey, nicknamed the “Manassa Mauler”, can be crowned King of the box office.\n\nJack Dempsey, who`s one of the greatest idols that boxing has ever produced, was born in Manassa, Colorado, on June 24, 1895. Several of his fights gathered together hundreds of thousands of fans. One of his most spectacular iron fisted, granite jaw slugfests became known as “battle of the century”, versus Luis Angel Firpo, “The Bull of the Pampas,” and even surpassing this, the two classic fights he had with Gene Tunney, the man who dethroned him, but not before: “The Battle of the Long Count.” The two men and their families, became lifelong friends thereafter."
