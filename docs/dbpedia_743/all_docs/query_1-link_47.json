        "text": "Our opinions might differ regarding the qualities of some of the men Dempsey fought, such as Gibbons, Firpo, Fred Fulton, Billy Miske, Bill Brennan etc..Aside from Harry Wills,I have read in old Ring Mags,no complaints from writers of the time admonishing Dempsey for avoiding some as Langford ,Jeannette, Norfolk...Except for Norfolk, Langford and Joe Jeannette were old and not considered a threat to the prime Dempsey.Norfolk was stopped by Tommy Gibbons, and was not a drawing card, thus no reason for Dempsey to fight him...I'll say this again, The peak Jack Dempsey, feared no man in the ring, and if he didnt fight often, it was because he was smitten with the good life,ala women and Hollywood...Who can blame him ?\n\nAfter all Joe Louis, and Ray Robinson avoided fighters of their times for obvious reasons ,dangerous with no worthwhile monetary rewards to gain...We all due what we think is best for our careers, and so did Dempsey...He should not be singled out ,I believe....\n\nHey thanks a lot, Burt! I often wonder about that great night that Greb gave Tunney the only official loss of his legendary career. I think about it and visualize what it was like to witness that great event. When I think of it, it reminds me of you and your father since you have shared that story with many of us E.S.B. members. We may not agree on the outcome of a Dempsey-Greb match, but I think we can all agree that Harry Greb was one of, if not THE greatest pound for pound fighter in the history of boxing. Well, maybe that Greb hating Pachilles doesn't agree, but his opinion has lost all credibility if you ask me. Thanks again and keep on keepin' on, Burt.\n\nhe grant, You were not there 1921-1923, and I was not around then, but the facts are...I am not defending Dempsey for not fighting more often, but please take notice of these events of 1921-1923...And tell me if I'm wrong\n\nSam Langford was born in 1883m making Sam 38 years old 1921..He lost to Harry wills, Bill Tate twice, LKee Anderson twice ,Tut Jackson ko, Bearcat Wright Ko, Fred Fulton , who Dempsey flattened in one minute..\n\nIt is obvious that Sam Langford at ages 38-40 was long past his prime at\n\n1921-1923...No real threat to the prime 26 year old Dempsey....\n\nJoe Jeannette was born in 1879, and Jeannette retired in 1919 at the age of 40 years of age... Did Dempsey avoid Joe Jeannette when Jeannette retired two years before in 1919 ? Of course not ?\n\nKid Norfolk a great light heavyweight was born in 1893...In 1921 he was kod by Lee Anderson,Harry Wills 1922, Tommy Gibbons in 1924, and by mjiddleweight Frank Moody in 1925... Great light heavyweight , but no threat tothe much larger and powerful Dempsey...So who did Jack Dempsey fear to fight those above years, for fear of loising..None I saay as Ray Arcel who saw them all those years said attested to in interviews before he died...It is fashionable to kick Jack Dempsey around today ,obscuring the real facts of those days...Dempsey fought less than we would have liked, not because he feared opponents 1921-1925,but after all his hard days as a starving youth in the west, he finally had the money to satisfy his desires...Can we 90 years later say we would have done differently / I think not !1\n\nTo write Wills off as slow is clearly an attempt to say Jack would have beat him anyway. The facts are that both Kearns and Rickard were quite afraid of Dempsey risking his title against Wills. It's easy to forget the huge pressure they were receiving from the media for refusing to fight the number one contender for his entire reign. I am as studied on Dempsey as almost anyone out there and know all the stories but simply cannot excuse the facts. His reign as champion really was a joke. I have said time and again that Dempsey showed far more in the Sharkey and second Tunney fight about what might have been than in any of his actual bouts possibly excluding his massacre of a 37 year old, highly inactive Willard ..\n\nWhy the \"agita' about Dempsey...As I have posted before the only threat to Dempsey that Jack didn't meet was Harry wills...I think I pointed out that Sam Langford was old 38-40, and Joe Jeannette retired in 1919 at age of 40...in 1921-1923 time frame...So we are talking about Harry Wills in that time period...\n\nDempsey and Harry wills were contracted to fight each other on the night of Sept.6,1924..The fight fell through in Jersey City, because of money guarantees, so we will never know the outcome, if the fight occured...\n\nSoon after this cancellation Harry wills loist to Jack Sharkey, and was kod by the tough but crude Paolino Uzcudun...\n\nHow can you logically state that Jack Dempsey past his prime \"showed you more against Jack Sharkey and 2nd Tunney fight \",than his massacre of Jesse Willard, in Toledo ,1919...Willard was old true but was NEVER dropped before...A bull of a man with an iron chin...Willard was bounced up and down like a yo yo, and today the fight would have been over in one round...What more did you want the 187 pound Dempsey to do ?\n\nAnd how can youy state that you was not impressed with the young Dempsey prior to 1919 ,when he was flattening Carl Morris, Fred Fulton etc in a round, when those bouts are not on film ? Beats me...You and I never saw the young prime Dempsey, Willard and before, but In my long lifetime I have read 100s of accounts of Jack Dempsey's unique prowess in his unfilmed prime..Not for nothing, did those hardened sportswriters of Dempsey's time call Dempsey \"a man killer \"...\n\nSo to sum this up---\n\nDemposey and Wills signed to fight for Sept.6, 1924..Fell through\n\nThe onkly film youcan judge prime Demposey is against Willard in 1919...A hand cranked out of sync film that makes fighters of that hand cranked times seem disjointed ala Charlie Chaplin...\n\nDempsey didnt fight often because he finally had money anbd enjoyed the life of wine and women...Who is to blame him for that 90 years later .? Not I..\n\nWills deserved a title bout because of his merits, no doubt about that...\n\nBut I believe that a prime Jack dempsey would have kod the Harry Wills, who lost to Jack Sharkey and Paoliuno Uzcudun, in that time frame...b.b.\n\nDempsey does seem to get a lot of slack moreso than other fighters, hes one of my faveourite fighters and there are a lot more other lesser fighters that should be out under a microscope regarding who they fought/ducked way before dempsey. anyway just thought id point out, in the Jess Willard fight, Dmepsey only weiged 180lbs, officially it was 187lbs, but he really only weiged 180, where the 187 came from i dont know.\n\nBurt, I say this very respctfully as I truly like and appreciate your posts, my agita is with discounting Wills as \"just another big man of the sort Dempsey traditionally feasted on so Jack would have destroyed him anyhow .\" Anyone that studies Wills career knows he was a terriiic fighter, far and away better than anyone Dempsey ever fought at least till Tunney, and it is a crime that he was denied a shot. He was bigger than Dempsey, he was at least as strong if not stronger, he was a terrific puncher in his own right, he was quite fast and had a very good chin. The only man to stop him prior to Uzcuden at age 38 was Langford who could stop anyone.\n\nI've always felt the same about Dempsey. I love his saga. He was a colorful, exciting figure, almost part of Ameican mythology. However, as a fighter he gets an incomplete as far as how high I can rate him because after winning the title he stopped being a fighter. Five fights in seven years , most with huge periods of inactivity between does not a fighter make. He was exceptionally well promoted, he was exceptionally well marketed by the press. How good he was , who knows.\n\nHe fought Carpentier who was a light heavy. Miske may or may not have been less than 100%. Brennan was a very good fighter but not the type to gage all time greatness. Without question, his win over Gibbons was a very good win, maybe his best since Gibbons was exceptional . However, Gibbons was 32 and a small heavyweight. Firpo was a wild bruiser .. this is not a list that proves much to me ..\n\nI have always felt if Dempsey stayed active we may have saw true greatness. He didn't and we didn't ... I have no idea how good he was because he did not fight the best of his day. What I can say is that past his best he hung very tough with a terrific, prime Sharkey on one of the Sailor's best nights. Overlooked in the controversial ending is the fact that Dempsey was coming on very strong after a slow start and starting to weaken Sharkey with a brutal pace ... I can also say that he fought a great , prime Tunney tooth and nail on shot legs and slowed reflexes. Also forgotten is that while Tunney racked up the ronds many were very close with Dempsey missing by fractions of an inch with shots that could have ended their bouts ... again, his late career losses show me more than any victory as to what might have been with empsey .."
