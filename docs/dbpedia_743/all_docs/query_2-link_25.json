        "text": "\"When most collectors see the name Jack Dempsey, they associate it with being the later more popular boxer from the 1920s. But there were actually two Jack Dempseys in the sport and the first one can be found in the earlier N28 set.\n\nNicknamed ‘nonpareil’, he was one of the sports most dominant fighters with 51 victories against only four losses.\"\n\nLINK: https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/early-allen-ginter-sports-cards/\n\nAh, memories. When I got to work on the Dempsey player registry 11 years ago they actually had both fighters cards included in the latter's set. I had to explain why a bunch of 19th century cards didn't belong. The good old days.\n\nArthur"
