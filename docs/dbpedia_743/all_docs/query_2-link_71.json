        "text": "When he perceived an opponent to be far more than dangerous than most, Holmes could option staying behind the jab and playing it safe in the early to mid rounds before opening up and mixing his punches with both hands.\n\nThat would seem to be Larry’s best, go to strategy.\n\nHowever, we also know that if Larry does get hurt he can be drawn into a firefight.\n\nIt seems Holmes was somewhat vulnerable to right hands but he also had a great chin.\n\nDempsey’d best and most relied upon punch was his left but he had an excellent right also.\n\nThe written descriptions convey a ferocious prime Dempsey in the early rounds - and we really only have the Willard fight to exemplify that on film.\n\nNot to over romanticise Jack but I think if we had more film of him in his prime, the perception of the true extent of his threat in the early rounds would be more greatly strengthened.\n\nEven Jack Johnson described Dempsey as being a Sabre Toothed Tiger in the first 4 rounds or so - but less effective thereafter - which isn’t to say he still wasn’t effective - just not as acutely dangerous as he was in the earlier rounds - naturally.\n\nIf I had to bet my Marmot’s life on it, my $$$ would have to go on Larry - but absolute prime Dempsey’s best window is the first 4 rounds or so and he could potentially wreak some havoc in those nominated rounds.\n\nMarmaduke says Hi to y’all. Don’t let the cute little fella down Larry!\n\nThis content is protected"
