        "text": "By blue gene jack dempsey, you are saying the fish pictured are carrying the blue gene? The fish pictured appear to me to be regular jack dempsey's Archocentrus octofasciatus. From the way I understand it, you have to breed a regular jack dempsey carrying the blue gene to a blue dempsey to get blue dempsey's. A certain percentage will be regular and the others are blues. If you breed two blues together, you will get all regular dempsey's. Apparently regular dempsey's carrying the blue gene are very hard to get. If these do carry that gene, then the price is worth it. Maybe Matt can help shed some light on this as well.\n\nHere are links to Jeff Rapp's website showing blue dempseys.\n\nhttp://www.tangledupincichlids.com/images/blue9.jpg\n\nhttp://www.tangledupincichlids.com/images/bluedemp2.jpg\n\nhttp://www.tangledupincichlids.com/images/bluedemp6.jpg\n\nhttp://www.tangledupincichlids.com/images/blueadult.jpg\n\nLonny\n\nOK. Here is an extensive article about the blue dempsey. I had read this many years ago and it took me a few minutes to get it.\n\nhttp://bluejax.co.uk/colourmorph.aspx\n\nThey are beautiful fish danio27. When are you gonna turn that name green and join the rest of us cichlaholics????? Hope to meet you at a meeting soon.\n\nLonny\n\nHi Lonny,\n\nThanks. How do I turn my name green? Where's the meeting?\n\nI am trying to breed them. I keep to pairs for myself.\n\nIf anyone is interested, you are more than welcome to come and look at the fish. No pressure, you don't have to buy anything.\n\nYou had these guys on AquaBid a couple of weeks ago, right?\n\nDo you have pics of the EB you got them from? Any luck getting Blues from your breeding pairs?\n\nNo offense meant here - but since a BGJD looks identical to a regular dempsey but costs 4x as much - for good reason - how could I be sure they are blue gene?\n\n~Lively\n\nDanio27 The Green name shows that the person is a member of the Capital Cichlid Association. We are a local Cichlid club that owns the forum. The forum is open to both club members and the public.\n\nMeetings are held the second Saturday of most months. If you click the home button above then look at the links on the left side, there will be a couple that will give you some basic information on the club.\n\nWelcome to the forum.\n\nFrom the way I understand it, you have to breed a regular jack dempsey carrying the blue gene to a blue dempsey to get blue dempsey's. A certain percentage will be regular and the others are blues. If you breed two blues together, you will get all regular dempsey's.\n\nLonny\n\nSo, after reading the article, if you breed two blue gene carrying jacks together, you will get some blues, which is what I would expect. You should get about 25% blues, 50% blue gene-carrying, and 25% regular - simple Punnett Square stuff. But of course, you have no way to tell which of the regular-appearing jacks are regualr or blue gene carrying unless some DNA study is done. You do NOT have to have a blue and mate it to a blue gene-carrier.\n\nJoel\n\nIf you breed two blues (good luck finding a female most Blues turn out the be male or even guessing the sex) you will get 100% Blue Jack Dempseys - but they are extremely fagile. I've heard stories of successful EB/EB spawns - but not from that person - urban myth types storied.\n\nI love these fish and very much want to breed them - so I've researched the heck out of this. Generally speaking, you get stronger fish that survive to the 1\" mark if you breed unrelated Blue Gene JD's. Most people who breed them strongly suggest that you use a UV light since Electric Blues are very prone to parasites.\n\nThe best scenerio would be a group of people willing to commit resources to a serious breeding program - and in my opinion - willing to raise the EB's until they reach the 3\" mark - they have a much higher survival rate at that point. Another forum I belong to has had two members who have just lost 26 electric blues between them, both are ready to throw in the towel - but you can't find EB's larger than the 1.5-2\" mark - even then you're lucky because most are sold at the 3/4\" mark.\n\n~Lively\n\nLively,\n\nI do not have pics of the EB parents. I have two pairs of blue gene and one is ready to breed. It's a myth that most electric blue are males. I bougth five baby electric blues and three grew up to be females. Two of them were the mothers of these fish. I have two electric blue in my tank right now and one is a female.\n\nI bought the baby electric blue at 2\" at the local pet store for ~$25/each."
