        "text": "Expression: Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose\n\nMeaning: the more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nLiteral translation: the more it changes, the more it’s the same thing.\n\nDisturbing Yet Familiar Story are a reality of rescuing lost stories. In some sense, each story has these familiar seven elements. This is true of the Bible, myths from around the world, and yes, your stories. It is both reassuring and unsettling that this structure does, indeed, exist.\n\nWhy? Our stories are personal and real, and, in some sense, give meaning to our existence. Yet, I find the existence of this underlying structure somewhat reassuring that, in the end, justice will prevail.\n\nThe Long Resolution\n\nWhen I first read Eunice Hunt Tripler’s memoir, I knew it was special. A hidden treasure. I wrote a BLOG using it as an example of why people must tell and/or write their personal story.\n\nThen a year later, Jack Dempsey of the Michigan Civil War Association (MCWA) read the BLOG and contacted us. He was researching Eunice’s Husband, Dr. Charles Stuart Tripler. As he and my husband collaborated, the MCAW decided to devote an entire book about Eunice Tripler and her role in the Civil War. We took a road trip to attend in person the book launch on the occasion of Eunice’s 200th birthday.\n\nThis was to be followed by a book devoted entirely to her husband. That book is now ready.\n\nThe Author\n\nJack Dempsey is an award-winning author of works on the Civil War and Michigan history and culture, and a member of the Society of Civil War Historians and Society for Women and the Civil War. He served as:\n\nChairman of Michigan Civil War Sesquicentennial Committee;\n\nVice-President and President of Michigan Historical Commission (2007-2018);\n\nmember of Michigan World War I Centennial Commission;\n\nboard member of several heritage-focused nonprofit organizations.\n\nA trained lawyer, Jack approaches research for his books examining the facts.\n\nHis Sword A Scalpel uncovers the invaluable work of Dr. Tripler, his contribution to the Civil War medical corps, and, indeed, the medical care within the US Army for years to follow. It debunks many myths about medical care during the Civil War and reveals an injustice done to the reputation of Dr. Tripler.\n\nIn this book, he aptly untangles the grudges, misinformation, and politics that marginalized Dr. Tripler and his work – until now. The pattern of the Disturbing Yet Familiar Story of what goes wrong when politics governs health care is hard to miss.\n\nHis Sword A Scalpel is available now on Amazon at His Sword A Scalpel. The family is deeply indebted to Mr. Dempsey for giving these two family members a voice.\n\nTwo Lessons\n\nFirst: Your story matters. It may take a while, but your voice will be heard. Write yours down.\n\nSecond: There is nothing new under the sun – the plus ca change……\n\nProceeds as author help fund the Michigan Civil War Association in erecting Michigan’s first-ever monument at Antietam National Battlefield. Born in Detroit, a graduate of James Madison College at Michigan State University and George Washington University’s National Law Center, he first became fascinated by the Civil War in the 3rd Grade. He lives in Plymouth Township, Michigan. Check out jackdempseybooks.com for events, news, and other information."
