        "text": "Danny Summers\n\nEditors note: This is Part Three of a three-part series on the\n\nlife of boxing legend Jack Dempsey. Dempsey’s career began in Gold\n\nCamp, where he learned the basics of fighting. He estimated he had\n\nhundreds of fights in Victor and Cripple Creek between the years of\n\n1911 and 1916.\n\nFrom his humble beginnings in Manassa, to his wild days in Gold\n\nCamp, to his rise to Heavyweight Champion of the World, Jack\n\nDempsey still is one of the most revered American athletes\n\never.\n\nDempsey lived until 1983 when he died at the age of 87 — nearly\n\n60 years after his last professional fight. And while he was one of\n\nthe most famous people in the world during the Roaring 20s, he\n\ncontinued to have enormous popularity throughout his life, drawing\n\ntens of thousands to events.\n\nOnce Dempsey became Heavyweight champion in 1919, he slowed down\n\nthe frequency of his fights. He fought just nine times until his\n\nretirement in 1927, when he lost a rematch to Gene Tunney, whom he\n\nhad relinquished his title to after a seven-year reign. Dempsey’s\n\nprofessional record included 66 wins (51 knockouts), 6 losses and\n\n11 draws. Dempsey is listed No. 7 on Ring Magazine’s 100 Greatest\n\nBoxers of All-Time.\n\nDempsey continued to fight exhibition matches until 1940, and in\n\n1935, he opened Jack Dempsey’s Broadway Restaurant in New York\n\nCity’s Times Square, which he kept open until 1974.\n\nDempsey’s friends ran the circuit from Harry Houdini to Judge\n\nJohn Sirica, who presided over the Watergate trials.\n\nDempsey was married four times — two of which were notable\n\nHollywood actresses (Estelle Taylor and Hannah Williams). He was\n\nmarried to his last wife, Deanna Piatelli, from 1943 until his\n\ndeath. He often said she should have been his first. He considered\n\nthis last marriage a happy one, and he adopted Deanna’s daughter,\n\nBarbara.\n\nBy all accounts, Dempsey was content with his post-fight career\n\nand enjoyed retirement. It was a far cry from his days in Gold\n\nCamp, where he worked long hours in the mines, partied hard in the\n\nbars and trained even harder to become champion by the age of\n\n24.\n\nOne negative thing that haunted Dempsey for years was his\n\ndeferment-based claim during World War I. He registered for the\n\ndraft, but said he was the sole support for his family (he was\n\nmarried to his first wife Maxine Cates at the time). In 1920 he was\n\nlabeled a “slacker” by the government and brought to trial as a\n\ndraft dodger. Maxine was the government’s key witness. He was\n\neventually cleared of all charges.\n\nDempsey got his chance to refute any remaining criticism when\n\nthe United States entered World War II. He joined the New York\n\nState National Guard and was given a commission as a first\n\nlieutenant. He resigned that commission to accept a commission as a\n\nlieutenant in the Coast Guard Reserve, and reported for active duty\n\nin June 1942 at the Coast Guard Training Station in New York. He\n\nwas assigned director of physical education.\n\nDempsey was promoted to lieutenant commander in December of 1942\n\nand commander in March, 1944. In 1945 he was on the attack\n\ntransport USS Arthur Middleton for the invasion of Okinawa, Japan.\n\nIn 1952 he was given an honorable discharge from the Coast Guard\n\nReserve.\n\nIn a 1950 poll, the Associated Press selected Dempsey as the\n\ngreatest fighter of the first half of the century.\n\nManassa paid tribute to its favorite son in 1966 when it opened\n\na museum in Dempsey’s honor. It is housed in the cabin in which\n\nDempsey was born. It contains several artifacts of Dempsey’s\n\ncareer, including gloves, and numerous black-and-white photographs,\n\nwhich line the walls.\n\nDempsey is buried in the Southampton Cemetery in Southampton,\n\nNew York. The street where Madison Square Garden is located is\n\ncalled Jack Dempsey Corner.\n\nDempsey was a universally accepted sports star. With his bobbing\n\nand weaving stance, amazing speed, graceful agility, and pure\n\npower, he will forever remain the perfect boxer, and one of the\n\ngreatest box office attractions of all time.\n\nOne can visit the Cripple Creek District Museum to see more on\n\nthe early legend of Jack Dempsey."
