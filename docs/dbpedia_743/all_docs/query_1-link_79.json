        "text": "So, today is my birthday, and taking a hint from other #52Ancestors posts (here, here and here), I wondered what were my ancestors doing on 30 October 1919?\n\nAnd immediately the question arises — which of my ancestors were alive 100 years ago today? Let’s see…\n\nThis is my dad’s side. Dad, obviously, was not yet alive; his mom was approaching her 12th birthday. His dad Cassius was almost 15 and therefore was in high school — the first family member to attend and graduate. Both of Cassius’ parents were alive, but none of his grandparents. Margaret’s father William was alive; William’s parents were deceased. Margaret’s mother Eileen had died, but her grandfather Charles was still alive in Athea, Co. Limerick, where he was a farmer, living with two of his younger children.\n\nOn my mom’s side, both her parents were alive, and living in the Healdsburg, Sonoma, California area. Each was 5 years old. Both sets of their parents were living. I don’t know if Giuseppe Diamantini’s parents were still alive back in Fano, Italy, but possibly not as they would have been born no later than, say, 1852, if not earlier.\n\nMaria Bolognesi’s parents were dead, and Hazel (Englehart) Holst’s mother had been deceased over a decade. Peter Holst and his wife Caroline, and Sam Englehart, who crossed the Great Plains to California with his family as a little boy were both still living. Sam was in Healdsburg, living in the house his late sister had bequeathed him, and working odd jobs. Peter and Caroline were in the hills just outside Healdsburg, growing grapes and running a small but thriving winery.\n\nSo, in summary, this is the count of my ancestors alive 100 years ago today.\n\n0 – parents\n\n4 – grandparents (ranging in age from 5 to almost 15)\n\n7 – great-grandparents\n\n4 – great-great grandparents\n\nPeter Nicholas Holst’s father reportedly lived to at least 97 years of age; based on Peter’s birth year, I estimated Peter (Sr.) to be born c 1822, and died c 1919 — so he might have been alive on 30 October 1919. He would have been living in Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein (Germany now and at the time — but Denmark when he was born).\n\nPart I – My dad’s side\n\nMy father’s father\n\nName: Cassius Dempsey\n\nBorn: December 1904 in San Francisco\n\nAge: 14\n\nOccupation: high school student\n\nLocation: San Francisco, California\n\nChildren: None at the time\n\nDid I know him? Yes. He died when I was 31 years old. I did not see him often, though, as we lived in Florida and Texas in my childhood.\n\nWhat was going on in his life at the time? He was likely in school, and he possibly worked odd jobs after school. He likely heard about the Chicago “Black Sox” throwing the World Series, and could have played sports at school, or with the neighborhood boys.\n\nY-Line Haplogroup: Haplogroup information keeps changing as the science gets better and the data set grows. Obtained from one of his grandsons, and depending on how you label it, it’s either R-ZS8379 or, further downstream (per http://ytree.net today) R-BY11707. Closest relatives all have the Molloy surname; historically, the Irish clans of Molloy and Dempsey came from the Co. Offaly area.\n\nmtDNA Haplogroup: Unknown at this time.\n\nMy father’s paternal grandparents\n\nName: William John Dempsey and Mary Erma Lamburth\n\nBorn: 1869 and 1867, respectively, both in San Francisco\n\nAge: 50 and 52, respectively\n\nOccupation: Storekeeper (pump company), and housewife, respectively\n\nLocation: San Francisco, California\n\nChildren: 7 children; 6 living on 30 October 1919\n\nDid I know them? No. William died about 6 months after my father was born. Mary died while my father was still in high school.\n\nWhat was going on in their lives at the time? He was likely in school, and he possibly worked odd jobs after school. He likely heard about the Chicago “Black Sox” throwing the World Series, and could have played sports at school, or with the neighborhood boys.\n\nY-Line Haplogroup: William’s haplogroup was R-ZS8379 (or, more recently) R-BY11707.\n\nmtDNA Haplogroup: Unknown at this time for either William (who had only brothers) or Mary.\n\nMy father’s mother\n\nName: Margaret Colbert\n\nBorn: January 1908 in San Francisco\n\nAge: 11\n\nOccupation: student\n\nLocation: San Francisco, California\n\nChildren: None at the time\n\nDid I know her? Yes. She died on my 22nd birthday. I did not see her often; the last time was in summer 1976, when I was 14.\n\nWhat was going on in her life at the time? She was probably in school, and lived at home with her 2 older sisters, her younger brother, and her widowed father. (She was just shy of her 4th birthday when her mother died.) Her paternal aunt Nan, her paternal uncle Jack, and her maternal aunt Margaret lived near enough that she probably saw them regularly.\n\nmtDNA Haplogroup: W1c (inferred, based on her son’s test, and grandchildren of her daughter)\n\nMy father’s maternal grandfather\n\nName: William Cornelius Colbert\n\nBorn: January 1877, near Athea, Co. Limerick, Ireland\n\nAge: 42\n\nOccupation: Teamster – municipal works (not sure what that means; it comes from the 1920 census)\n\nLocation: San Francisco, California\n\nChildren: 4 children; all living on 30 October 1919\n\nDid I know him? No. William died in October 1931, before my grandmother even married, let alone had her children.\n\nWhat was going on in their lives at the time?\n\nY-Line Haplogroup: Unknown at this time.\n\nmtDNA Haplogroup: Unknown at this time.\n\nMy grandmother’s maternal grandfather\n\nName: Charles Houlihan\n\nBorn: about 1832, probably Co. Limerick, Ireland\n\nAge: about 87\n\nOccupation: Farmer\n\nLocation: Athea, Co. Limerick, Ireland\n\nChildren: 5 children; at least 2 living on 30 October 1919 (in U.S.). 2 more living in Athea as of 1911 who could’ve been alive in 1919.\n\nDid I know him? No. Charles died in 1924. In fact, my grandmother never knew him either.\n\nWhat was going on in their lives at the time? The daily life of farming in a rural community. From the census taken in 1911, I know that he was Roman Catholic, and that he was able to read and write, both in English and Irish.\n\nY-Line Haplogroup: Unknown at this time.\n\nmtDNA Haplogroup: Unknown at this time.\n\nTo be continued, with my mother’s side…\n\nThese photos were taken on my parents’ wedding day in 1957, at the home of my maternal grandfather. The first one, clearly discolored due to its age and the nature of the film, is of my dad and mom, and their attendants. Dad’s best man, George Francis McGrath (1934-1960), is on the far left. Mom’s maid-of-honor, in blue (though it’s not obvious in this photo!), was her friend Jane (Sommerfeld) Stroth (1934-2011). Mom and Jane met in nursing school; Jane would marry Jan Sroth the following year.\n\nDad and George were best friends, having gone to high school together — and possibly college (?). George later joined the military and was doing training exercises at NAS Corpus Christi — flying — when his plane crashed and he died in January 1960. My grandfather, who was informed, chose not to tell my dad (who was studying for his doctorate up in Michigan) because Grandpa didn’t want Dad to take time away from his studies to come back to San Francisco for the funeral. (Not cool, Gramps! Not cool at all.)\n\nIn the photo below, it’s a bit more obvious that Jane was wearing blue — even so, the color has faded significantly since I was a child. It used to be evident that she wore a forget-me-not blue — with matching blue shoes.\n\nThis last picture was one I had printed from a slide about 30 years ago, so the color is richer, but still fading. I don’t know everybody in the picture, but can name some folks:\n\nFrom left to right — the first 3 people I don’t know. Wearing a navy blue dress is my grand-aunt Anita (Colbert) Foley (Dad’s maternal aunt). Behind her is her husband “Bud” Foley. Next to them are my dad’s parents Cassius Dempsey and Margaret (Colbert) Dempsey. Then, my dad and my mom. On my mom’s left, wearing a hat and flowered dress is my dad’s sister Peggy. Next to her, in the belted dress, is my mom’s cousin Rita Diamantine. Behind Rita to her left are maid-of-honor Jane (Sommerfeld) Stroth and best man George McGrath.\n\nWhat strikes me in going through these photos is how casual it all was. The reception is my grandparents’ backyard. Sandwiches, punch, wedding cake, and coffee was all that was on the menu. Contrast that today with, say, the destination wedding! Times change, don’t they?\n\nPrompt (from 2018, week 25): Same Name\n\nOne of the Walter Bernard’s in my family was the fourth child of William and Mary (Lamburth) Dempsey, their third son, and an older brother of my grandfather. Walter is enumerated with his family at 485 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, in the 1910 Federal census (shown below).[1]\n\nA few short years after the census, he was dead. The family story was that he attended a New Year’s Day parade, some of the confetti/ticker tape got up in his nose, and he died a few days later. His death certificate states he died of meningitis on 5 January 1918, his illness having lasted 4 days.[2] Possibly the family story, then, is true. He seems to have gotten sick around New Year’s Day.\n\nHere is the only photo we have of him, reportedly taken around 1915. He definitely resembles my grandfather.\n\nWalter’s death certificate gives his age at death as 15 years 2 months and 11 days. By my calculations, that makes his date of birth 25 October 1902, which doesn’t match the birth date provided on the death certificate as 24 October. The informant on Walter’s death certificate is the “San Francisco Hospital”, although surely they would have to have gotten information from either Walter’s doctor or Walter’s parents.\n\nFurther complicating the birth date issue is the delayed birth certificate application for his younger sister Mary Loretta, applied for in March 1949, on which Mary Loretta’s mother Mary (Lamburth) Dempsey attests that Mary Loretta’s birthdate was 24 December 1902.[3]\n\nIf Walter was born in October 1902, Mary could not have been born 2 months later. Either Walter’s birth date and age at death is incorrect (meaning he possibly was born October 1901, and thus was 16 when he died), or Mary’s delayed birth certificate application was incorrect, meaning she was born in December 1903 rather than December 1902. The next child along was my grandfather, born in December 1904, which leaves plenty of time for a full-term pregnancy to occur after a possible 1903 birth for Mary Loretta.\n\nGiven that both Walter, Mary Loretta and my grandfather Cassius were all born late in the year, the 1910 census information (with Walter being 8 years, Mary being 7 years, and Cassius being 5) seems to indicate that Walter was born in 1901, Mary in 1902, and my grandfather (correctly) in 1904.\n\nIn sum, one of the records (Walter’s death certificate or Mary’s delayed birth certificate) is incorrect. It’s a tossup as to which is correct, and in some ways it doesn’t really matter so many years later.\n\nCite/link to this post: Cathy M. Dempsey, “Walter Bernard Dempsey,” Genes and Roots, posted 27 Feb 2019 (https://genesandroots.com : accessed (date)).\n\n[1] 1910 U.S. census, San Francisco County, California, population schedule, Enumeration District 29, San Francisco Assembly District 31, page 9A, family 161, William J Dempsey household; digital image, Ancestry.com (https://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=7884 : accessed 20 September 2016); citing National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) microfilm publication T624, roll 96.\n\n[2] California Department of Health Services, death certificate state file no. 18-002555, Walter Dempsey (1918); Center for Health Statistics and Informatics, Sacramento.\n\n[3] San Francisco County, California, Application for Delayed Birth Certificate with accompanying affidavits, 12 March 1949, for Mary Loretta Dempsey (24 Dec 1902), sworn by Mary E Dempsey, mother; photocopy in possession of grand-niece Cathy [blog author].\n\nI’ve been struggling to make sense of — or, more accurately, wisely use — my dad’s matches at Ancestry to extend some of his lines. Dad has one great-grandparent who was born in the U.S.; the others were all born in Ireland (where all but three remained throughout their lives.) So, I’ve long thought most of my dad’s matches are not easily assignable to one of his great-grandparents because there is much I don’t know about the aunts/uncles/first cousins of those ancestors.\n\nNow, that may still be the case to some degree, but I did have an eye-opener when I used the NodeXL template with Excel to cluster my matches. NodeXL is a template for graphing your networks (often in reference to social media) — see here. I found about the tool from reading Shelley Crawford’s blog Twigs of Yore; she has an entire step-by-step series on how to create visual networks of your Ancestry DNA matches using NodeXL and Excel. (An indexed version is here.)\n\nSo, I downloaded my dad’s matches at year-end from Ancestry using DNAGedCom, and loaded the data into the NodeXL template. I limited the number of matches to those who share at least 17 cM with my dad; I also did not include my brother or me as matches, nor my paternal 1st cousin.\n\nThe reason you want to exclude close matches is because they will match so many people you (or your target person) that there will be connections all over the graph, and you won’t be able to discern any useful information.\n\nFor this same reason, I also excluded children and grandchildren of matches, for those cases I know about. (As a disclaimer, just to be clear, with Ancestry’s matches, I have no way of telling if match A and match B are, say, child/parent to each other — unless I personally know A and B, or unless I’ve “met” online regarding our shared matches, and they’ve shared that with me.)\n\nThat’s the context; here is the first picture of Dad’s top 1,000 (or so) matches clustered into the top groups.\n\nThe bigger dots represent the closest genetic connections to my dad. Big dots exist in the navy dot group (upper left), the turquoise group (lower left) and the kelly green group (upper right).\n\nThe grey lines denote connections, both within groups and between groups. In one easy glance, one can determine that the group most tightly related to each other is the group on the top row with dark green dots. It looks like a web.\n\nAs far as inter-group connections go, the turquoise dot group seems to have the most connections with other groups.\n\nSo, when I highlight the turquoise group, what do I find? Connections to most every group of matches my dad has — except for the navy blue group. Which is kinda cool — but so what? Unless you know something about the matches within the group.\n\nSo, the matches in the highlighted group above are all kin to my dad’s great-grandfather, Archibald Lamburth (born c. 1833 Tennessee – died 1909 San Francisco). He has the distinction of being my dad’s only great-grandparent born in the United States. Given that the bulk of Ancestry’s DNA customers are U.S.-born, and that many with colonial ancestry say they have many thousands of matches, I suspect most of these connections will tie back to 18th-century U.S. and the colonies should I ever break this “brick wall”.\n\nMy second surprise was looking at the navy blue group. Other than the one outlier I have yet to explore, all the matches are intra-group matches. This group includes known close relatives of my dad’s maternal side.\n\nMy dad has matches to his maternal grandfather‘s side (and his parents AND grandparents), as well as to his maternal grandmother‘s side (and her parents), the clustering algorithm does not distinguish between the two lines — at least based on the current population of matches used.\n\nI may need to do a separate analysis on these particular matches — perhaps bringing down the filter to 15 cM — to see if I can break out that group into Maternal Grandfather and Maternal Grandmother.\n\nRight now, the only useful information is that my dad’s mother’s matches and my dad’s father’s matches are separate. They weren’t related to each other, based on the information we currently have — the above graphs, plus the genealogy I’ve already done.\n\nThe next picture, below, shows how some close genetic relatives (> 275 cM shared, in this case 1st cousins 1 generation removed), share matches with other groups. This cluster could be a Dempsey cluster, with ties to Lamburth kin. Which makes sense in my family tree since a Dempsey married a Lamburth.\n\nNotice also that the group is somewhat open, like a child’s scribble. Not everyone within the group is closely connected to everyone else in the group.\n\nAn example of a tightly-connected group is below. This is the group with dots in chartreuse green. Right now, I have no idea how they fit into the family tree. It’s pretty much a self-contained group, with minor ties to the Lamburth (dad’s paternal grandmother’s side) group, but nothing significant. Yet.\n\nThat was a look at my dad’s clustered Ancestry matches; sometime in the near future, I’ll take a look at my mom’s clustered Ancestry matches using the NodeXL tool.\n\nAre you sure that the segment of DNA you share with your DNA match is due to your common 3rd great-grandparents Joe and Sally (Harper) Booth (that’s a fictional couple, by the way) — and not due to a common ancestor you may not yet have found? How complete is your tree?\n\nRecently, Blaine Bettinger posted in Facebook’s Genetic Genealogy Tips and Techniques group, about the completeness of your genealogical tree being critical to accuracy in ascertaining the correct common ancestor with your DNA matches. He referenced a post by Amberly Beck (see here) in which she discusses the completeness (or lack thereof) of her maternal line.\n\nRather than looking at just my maternal line or just my paternal line, or even just looking at my whole tree at once, I decided to review my results by grandparent.\n\nI “found” 9 ancestors last year on my maternal side without using DNA at all! Instead, I used DanishFamilySearch.com, a site which has been transcribing Danish census records, and allowing registered users to post their family tree information on their site, and the newly online Danish census records (in Danish, of course!) at familysearch.org\n\nSo, yay!, that was success for my grandmother’s line. I now know 4 more of my maternal grandmother’s 16 2nd great-grandparents, and 5 more of my grandmother’s 32 3rd-great grandparents.\n\nAs for my 3 other grandparents, there was no change in the past year. Not surprising, because I spent time on the BU Certificate course for 15 weeks (during which I spent little time on my own genealogy), and I also spent some time continuing to validate with DNA matches my Copple line (which is also on my maternal grandmother’s tree).\n\nMeaning, as I build out collateral relative trees for my Copple ancestors and find I have — more accurately, my mother has — DNA matches with descendants of those collateral relatives (siblings and 1st cousins of my own ancestors), that is slowly strengthening the case that the DNA shared belongs to the Copple line and not some other unknown line. (Well, until I am able to build further back; the shared DNA may actually relate to, say, the wife of my most distant Copple ancestor, and not to him.)\n\nI’ve done nothing really on my maternal grandfather’s line — I know the Italian town he came from and his grandparents’ names. I also know I would likely find records on their parents via the local Catholic church. As it would likely require assistance from a researcher over in Italy or a trip to Italy myself, it just has not been a priority for me. Perhaps someday.\n\nLike my maternal grandfather, my paternal grandmother was a first-generation American. Her uncle was Con Colbert who was executed for his role in the Easter Uprising in 1916. Consequently, he is somewhat famous in the Republic of Ireland; therefore, some of his family history was researched by a professional genealogist for the centenary in 2016. So, I have a bit more on her kin than on my maternal grandfather’s kin. I’ve also been fortunate two years ago to find some of the baptismal and marriage records for her maternal line ancestors (also Irish) online — one such place is here.\n\nI have a “brick wall” at my great-great grandfather Patrick Dempsey. Per his obituary, he was “of King’s County”. That’s now County Offaly, but that doesn’t mean he was born and baptized there. It may just mean he was from there last before coming to America circa 1850 or so. There are about a half-dozen potential Patrick Dempseys baptised in Co. Offaly when he was thought to be born (ca. 1830), but I have no oral history as to his family. Maybe his parents and siblings died in the Famine?\n\nThis year, I’d like to find out more about my paternal grandfather’s maternal grandparents: Anderson and Ermine (Farnham? Farley?) Lamburth — Grandpa Dempsey’s one line that has reportedly been in the U.S. since at least 1800. Of course, I’d also like to break the brick walls of my 3rd great-grandmother (aka my maternal grandmother’s great-grandma) Phoebe Harvey — or her mother-in-law Margaret (Blalock) Copple. We’ll see.\n\nHow about you? Do you have a particular line you’re thinking of researching next?"
