        "text": "The book shadow boxer is an award winning novel written by Chris Lynch. The book was originally published on the day of 1993. The author of the book Chris Lynch was born on july 2, 1962 and his current age to this day is 55. Chris Lynch is an author for young people and has won many awards for the books that he has written, including shadow boxer.\n\nBoxing, an official sanctioned sport in the early 20th century, is a sport that is known as one of the most violent and physically demanding sports on the earth. Professional boxers that get paid to fight must be in top shape in order to preform at the highest level. Being a professional boxer is a tough life. Boxers train hard for many months leading up to one fight and either win, lose, knock out the opponent or even get knocked out. The sport has been around for centuries, but has most recently taken off over the last 100 years. It is a multibillion dollar industry with fighters taking home hundreds of thousands of dollars if not even millions of dollars for big matches. In his novel Papa Jack, Roberts tells the story of the famous African American boxer Jack Johnson. He details the boxers rise to fame and fortune and his downward spiral that would soon follow. In Papa Jack, Roberts displays life of a professional boxer through firsthand accounts with events that happened during Johnson’s life and shows how boxing not only influenced his life but also how he influenced the African American community.\n\nHis life came to an unfortunate end on June 10, 1946 when he died in an automobile accident in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the age of 68. Jack Johnson arguably the best heavyweight of his generation. He started boxing at a young age. He won his first title in 1903 and won the world heavy weight title seven years later. He later fled the country from breaking the law of marrying a white woman. After a car crash his life came to an end but his legacy lived on and he became a figure of blacks in sports and in Black\n\nOn January 31, 1919, a kid by the name of Jackie Robinson was born in Cairo, Georgia. He surely did not know that he would be one day an american hero. His father was Jerry Robinson, a plantation worker. His mother was Mallie, she was a domestic worker. Jackie had three brothers and one sister. The four brothers were: Edgar, Frank and Mack. The sister was Willa Mae. Frank and Edgar are no longer alive, but Mack and WIlla still live in Pasadena, California. His dad left Mallie and the children, never to return, when Jackie was six months old. When\n\nJefferies constantly denied Johnson a fight and in 1904 they came across each other in a bar and Jefferies told Johnson he would fight him alone in the cellar and bet 2500 dollars but Johnson said he wasn’t a cellar fighter and in 1905 Jefferies retired opening a new gate for Jack Johnson. This pissed off Johnson for he was in need of money and so he hired a manager, Sam Fitzpatrick who helped Johnson earn up to 3000 dollars a night. Johnson was now starting to be openly seen with white women, They were prostitutes and he would take them every where with him, this was done during the time when he was lashing out on the white boxers, one of these prostitutes would be with him for the next 4 years, her name was Hattie McClay.\n\nBorn on January 31, 1919 Jack Roosevelt Robinson was the youngest of five children. His father left the family before Jackie turned one and shortly after his mom moved the family from Georgia to California in search of work (Contemporary Black Biography). Segregation was still present in California, but was less harsh than in the south. To get away from the problems and racial prejudice, Jackie turned to sports. He was an exceptional athlete excelling in football, baseball, basketball, and track in both high school and college. He played four sports for the University of California Los Angeles (commonly known as UCLA). He was mostly a football and basketball star and had no intentions of playing Major League baseball due to the fact that it was all white. Jackie had always wanted to become a social worker to help underprivileged boys and hoped that travelling the nation for sports would expose him to a job in that field\n\nAccording to my book Jackie Roosevelt Robinson was born and grew in the small town of Stamford, Connecticut. Jackie was one of the five children in his family. Later in life, Jackie attended UCLA; he was great at baseball football and track and field. After college, in 1942 Jackie Robinson entered the army. He was later promoted to lieutenant and later he received an honorable discharge from the army. (www.brittanica.com)\n\nBaseball has always been America’s national pastime. In the early and all the way into the mid 50’s, baseball was America and America was baseball. The only thing lacking in the great game was the absence of African American players and the presence of an all white sport. America still wasn’t friendly or accepted the African American race and many still held great prejudice towards them. All this would change when the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey decided he was going to sign a Negro player. Jackie Robinson was that player and Jackie Robinson changed the game, America, and history. By looking specifically at his childhood adversity, college life and the hardships he encountered by becoming the first black player\n\nThe grandson of a slave, Jack Roosevelt Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, in Cairo, Georgia; he was the youngest of five children. Jackie grew up very poor, but little did he know that his athletic ability would open the doors for his future. After his father deserted the family when Jackie was six months old, his mother, Mallie Robinson, moved the family to California in search of work. California also subjected blacks to segregation at that time, but to less of a degree than in the Deep South. The young Jackie defused his anger over this prejudice by immersing himself in sports. He displayed extraordinary athletic skills in high school, excelling at football, basketball, baseball, and track. After helping Pasadena Junior College\n\nA hero is a person who is admired for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities.

Jackie Robinson is a hero because he has long history filled with great things. He broke the color barrier, and he showed\n\nThe main plot of the story starts with a successful boxer in the roaring twenties. James J. Braddock fought his way to becoming the best-known boxer ever. He is a very well known boxer in his day. The Great Depression takes a toll on everyone in the country. James has lost pretty much everything he worked his life for. This did not stop James from trying his best to provide for his family and even got the chance to fight in the ring once again. This has become the best comeback in the face of great hardships. He never gave up to shoot for his goal to beat the best-known boxer at the time, Max Baer. No matter how hard it was back home he fought his best to get his life back. He then got the nickname of “The Cinderella Man” for his comeback\n\n“Near six o’clock on the evening of January 31, 1919, Jack Roosevelt Robinson was born somewhere near the town of Cairo in Grandy County in southern Georgia” (Rampersad 10). Jackie’s parents, Jerry and Mallie Robinson, first lived together on a small plantation just south of Cairo. Mallie Robinson raised her five children single handedly, and they later moved to Pasadena, California, which was not the most racially friendly environment due to the Robinsons being the only black family on the block. Not having a father in the home, he looked up to his older brothers and saw them as his future, they are the ones who introduced him into the sports"
