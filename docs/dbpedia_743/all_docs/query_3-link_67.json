        "text": "Jack Dempsey Fight Ticket\n\nWilliam Harrison “Jack” Dempsey was born on June 24, 1895, in Manassa, Colorado. As a boy, he worked as a farm hand and miner. During his boyhood years, his older brother Bernie taught him to box, and he fought some small prize fights by traveling between the mining towns around Salt Lake City. By 1917, fighting under the professional name \"Jack Dempsey\", he had built enough of a reputation for himself to book more prominent and better-paying fights in San Francisco and on the East Coast.\n\nOn Independence Day in 1919, Dempsey got his first big break, fighting against world heavyweight champion Jess Willard. Despite having a large size disadvantage against Willard, who stood 6’ 6” inches tall and weighed in at 245 pounds compared to Jack’s 6' 1\", and weighing 187 pounds, Dempsey dominated the fight with his superior speed and ruthlessness, knocking Willard out in the third round to earn the title of world heavyweight champion. Dempsey successfully defended his title five times over the next six years, in what is considered one of the greatest runs in boxing history, before losing to Gene Tunney in 1926. In 1927, he fought a rematch with Tunney, but again lost in what became one of the most controversial fights in history. Dempsey knocked Tunney down in the seventh round, but forgot about a new rule requiring him to return to a neutral corner while the referee counted. Because of the referee having to pause counting to send Dempsey away to a corner, it allowed Tunney at least five extra seconds to recover and return to his feet. Tunney eventually won the fight by decision. Dempsey fans continue to argue that Dempsey would have won had it not been for the “Long Count”.\n\nAfter his second loss to Tunney, Dempsey retired from boxing. He briefly tried acting, co-starring in a Broadway play as well as appearing in a handful of films. He also opened Jack Dempsey's Restaurant in New York City, where he was known for his hospitality and welcoming disposition. He would make small-talk with almost any customer. Jack Dempsey died of heart failure at age 87 on May 31, 1983 in New York City.\n\nRanking second only to Babe Ruth, Dempsey was considered one of the great American sports icons of the 1920s. He was inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1954, and many commentators still rank him among the ten greatest boxers of all time.\n\nI am especially pleased to have a piece of memorabilia related to Jack Dempsey, because he is related to me. We are second cousins, three generations removed. The item in my collection is an unissued ticket from one of the fights where he defended his heavyweight title. It is a ticket from the July 4th 1923 fight against Tom Gibbons."
