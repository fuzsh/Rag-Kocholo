        "text": "A little over 100 years ago, Jack Dempsey became the heavyweight boxing champion of the world, defeating four-year defending champion Jess Willard in a title fight by way of corner retirement between the third and fourth rounds.\n\nAt the time, the boxing match was one of the largest in history and one of the most ostensibly lopsided as well.\n\nDempsey, standing just six feet, one inch tall and weighing only 187 pounds, was at a disadvantage in many of his heavyweight fights. His opponents were often significantly larger than him in both stature and weight⁠—none more so than Willard, who stood six feet, six inches and weighed 245 pounds.\n\nJess Willard (left) in action against Jack Dempsey during their world heavyweight title fight at Toledo, Ohio, on July 4, 1919. Dempsey won the fight at the end of the third round and he held onto the title until 1926. (Photo by Topical Press Agency/Getty Images)\n\nDue to the disparity in stature, the champion was not particularly worried by his smaller opponent,reportedly telling people before their bout, “This will be the easiest fight of my career.”\n\nWhile not the easiest, the fight on July 4, 1919, was certainly shocking for Willard.\n\nIn the first 30 seconds of the fight, Dempsey scored a knockdown, and he would knock the champion off his feet six more times before first round ended. The mauling continued until the fight was stopped after Willard couldn’t rise from his chair to start the fourth;he had suffered a broken jaw, a broken cheek, broken ribs, and hearing loss, which proved to be permanent.\n\nJess Willard sits up after being knocked to the floor by Jack Dempsey during their world heavyweight title fight at Toledo, Ohio, on July 4, 1919.

His parents had migrated west as Latter-day Saint pioneers, and he grew up in a large, deeply impoverished family. Facing overwhelming odds, Dempsey pulled off upset after upset. History remembers his wins inside the ring but just as often fails to include the noteworthy ones outside it.\n\nGrowing up poor in the newly settled west, Dempsey often had trouble finding fights close to home. And as he grew in skill and popularity, he was often forced to travel east to find true contenders. In his early fighting years, necessitated by his lack of money, he snuck onto rail cars to avoid paying for passage.\n\nDempsey’s father, who was taught by missionaries in the 1870s, was a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He moved westward as a result, eventually settling in Manassa, Colorado, where Dempsey was born.\n\n“In spite of all the religion,” Dempsey wrote in his autobiography Round by Round, “Manassa was like every other pioneer town, tough and ready for anything.\"\n\nThis served as an apt description for Dempsey as a fighter, too, and Dempsey was fittingly dubbed the Manassa Mauler for his exploits as a boxer.\n\nRandy Roberts, in his book Jack Dempsey: The Manassa Mauler, wrote:\n\nIn his autobiography, Dempsey wrote about his father’s beliefs, stating:\n\nLike his father, while not particularly devout, Dempsey considered himself a Latter-day Saint and practiced some of the religion’s teachings.\n\n“I’m proud to be a Mormon,”he said. “And ashamed to be the Jack Mormon that I am.”\n\nDempsey remembered being taught the fundamentals of the gospel early on in life, writing in his biography:\n\nDempsey was baptized at the age of 8 and he continued to practice parts of the religion.\n\nPrayer was among the religious practices that he was taught growing up. \"Every evening we had family prayers,” Dempsey remembered. “A blessing was always asked at the beginning of each meal.\"\n\nAnd, according toDaily Mail, he continued to do so throughout the rest of his life.\n\n“I've never eaten a meal or gone to bed in my life without saying a prayer,” he said. “Those prayers have been answered a thousand times.”\n\nWhen he was 13, Dempsey’s familyuprooted from Manassa and moved to Provo, Utah, and before dropping out of school, Dempsey held aspirations of attending Brigham Young University. In his autobiography, he said:\n\nHis desire to become a boxer outweighed his desire for education, however, and he chose to follow his dream of becoming a heavyweight champion. However, Dempsey’s lack of education bothered him later in life, especially after winning the title.\n\nAmerican world heavyweight champion boxer Jack Dempsey (1895-1983) with Argentine heavyweight champion Luis Angel Firpo (left) before their match at the Polo Grounds in New York, September 14, 1923.

It seems to be good for the digestion to have a complete rest once in a while; at any rate the custom worked well with me.\"\n\nThroughout his reign as heavyweight king during the roaring '20s—a golden age for sports as much as for the economy⁠—Dempsey’s fame rivaled even that of Babe Ruth, who was at the peak of his hitting powers. The Des Moines Register published the results of apopularity poll in 1928 that listed Dempsey at number one, Ruth at number two and Gene Tunney, who had just beaten Dempsey, at number three.\n\n“Meeting him was like meeting Babe Ruth,”said boxer “Irish” Johnny Turner. “I had read a lot about him, and I was in awe of him.”\n\nDempsey’s years at the top transformed prize fighting. His fight with Georges Carpentier in 1921 became the first-ever boxing match to capture a million dollar gate, earning an unheard of$1,789,238. Incredibly, five of Dempsey’s fights would earn an excess of a million dollars in revenue.\n\nArgentine heavyweight champion Luis Angel Firpo lies knocked out by American world heavyweight champion boxer Jack Dempsey (1895-1983) at the end of their match at the Polo Grounds in New York, September 14, 1923.

His ruthless stratagems inspired more recent heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who said in an interview with the Guardian, \"They were all so vicious, man. Jake LaMotta, Henry Armstrong, Carmen Basilio, Sugar Ray. . . . Sugar Ray was vicious. But Jack Dempsey more than anyone. All these guys let you know they wanted to murder you, and they'd take shots from you, over and over, and over, get beat senseless, just so they could get theirs in. Sugar Ray maybe most of all. But Dempsey? He wanted to maim you. He didn't want you dead. He wanted you to suffer. He wanted to shatter your eye socket, destroy your cheeks, your chinbone. That's what I learned from Mr. Dempsey, and I believe I learned it well.\"\n\nDespite Tyson’s description and Dempsey’s famously violent fighting style, which had a ruthlessness that no one can deny, Dempsey was often described as a kind person, even as a gentleman during his later life.\n\nAfter beating Bill Brennan in 1918, Dempsey recalls on his autobiography seeking him out after the fight.\n\nAnd directly after losing his title to Gene Tunney in 1926, he congratulated his opponent with grace:\n\nBoxing.com related other accounts of Dempsey’s graciousness, the first as told by George Cooney, a fellow boxer.\n\n“He was an awesome man and champion, but I was too young to recognize his greatness,\" said Cooney. \"He told me I was big and tall and would have a nice career if I worked hard. He was kind of quiet, not very outspoken, but there was something about him that stood out.\"\n\nThe article continues:\n\nDempsey’s accolades in the ring even gained the notice of David O McKay.\n\nMcKay, while struggling as a missionary in Scotland years earlier, had a spiritual experience that provided him strength. McKayrelayed it to Dempsey and offered him praise, saying:\n\nBringing “honor to your profession” is advice which Dempsey first received from his mother, Mary Celia Dempsey, who had high expectations and hopes for all her children.\n\nThe referee counts out Georges Carpentier (1894-1975) after the knock-out blow from Jack Dempsey in the fourth round of their World Heavyweight title fight at Jersey City on July 2, 1921.

So I had to be as good a champion as I could and hold the title as long as possible.\"\n\nAnd that he did, holding on to his championship title for seven years after beating Willard. Today, Dempsey is remembered as one of the greatest boxers of all time, and with what he had to overcome as a boxer and a person, he’s David and Goliath personified, a sports icon for the ages.\n\nLead image of world champion heavyweight boxer Jack Dempsey in action against Tom Gibbons during their fight at Shelby, Montana, in July 1923.
