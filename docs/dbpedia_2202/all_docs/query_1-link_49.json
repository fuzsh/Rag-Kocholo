Time for Chompers, your morning and night toothbrushing show!\n\nPick a side on the top of your mouth, and make little circles with your brush around each tooth.\n\n>> Kids: 3, 2, 1 brush!\n\n>> Rachel: It’s Bodies Week on Chompers, and tonight we’ve got a bunch of jokes HEAD-ing your way! (SFX RIMSHOT)\n\nAlright, what’s a pirate’s favorite body part?\n\n>> Jasmine: Is it the ARRRRRM?\n\n>> Rachel: YAARRR you think it’s the ARRRRRRm but its The booty (SFX RIMSHOT)\n\nYour ARRRRM is actually where your funny bone is located.\n\nSwitch your brushing to the other side of the top of your mouth (SFX), and give your front teeth a brush too.\n\nYou know when you bump your elbow against something it feels really funny. (SFX) It doesn’t exactly hurt .. it feels sort of buzzy? That’s your funny bone! But actually … it’s not a bone at all! It’s a NERVE connected to the humerus bone in your arm. (SFX RIMSHOT) That’s not a joke! The funny bone really is connected to the HUMERUS!\n\nGive your tongue a quick brush, (SFX TONGUE BRUSH) then switch your brushing to the bottom of your mouth (SFX SWITCH)\n\nHere’s another joke:\n\nWhy did the knee make so many jokes?\n\n>> KIDS: I don’t know.\n\n>> Rachel: It was a kidney (SFX RIMSHOT/LAUGHS)\n\nYour kidneys are like your body's filtration system: they keep your blood clean, and remove any unnecessary chemicals that might be hanging out in there. Anything your body doesn't need your kidneys put in your urine, so you pee it right out! (SFX flush)\n\nSwitch your brushing to the other side of the bottom of your mouth (SFX), but not tooo hard.\n\nAlright here’s your LAST JOKE:\n\n>> Rachel: Why did the butt fall asleep?\n\n>> KIDS: Why?\n\n>> Rachel: Because he was pooped (SFX RIMSHOT/FART)\n\nWell now I’M pooped after telling you all those jokes. Get a good night’s sleep and come back tomorrow for a fresh episode of Chompers. Until then, rinse with water before you...\n\n>> Kids: 3, 2, 1 spit!"
