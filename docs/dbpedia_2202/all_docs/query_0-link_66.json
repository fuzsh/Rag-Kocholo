Strike up the band, Tim Lautzenheiser P\"r.urrion instruments were invented by prehistoric cultures. However, most percussion history is connected with military groups. Drums were used in the 700 A.D. Moorish invasion of Africa. These instruments were ancestors of the snare drum and timpani. Both the Scots and Swiss developed the snare drum around 1300. Around 1450,Turkish military bands featured triangles, cymbals and several sizes of drums. The instruments used in these \"Janizary Bands\"communicated signals to large numbers of fighting troops. J.S. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Berlioz, Debussy, Sousa and Stravinsky are all important composers who have included percussion in their writing. Common percussion instruments are the snare drum, bass drum, crash cymbals, triangte and timpani. Famous percussionists include Vic Firth, Peter Erskine, Buddy Rich and Al Payson. tSBN 0-634-00327-s copyright @ 2004 by HAL LEONARD CORPORATTON International Copyright Secured All Rights Reserved -21 TIJHRL.LSoNARD' L--coRPORA-t-toN 7A7A W.

Feet flat on the floor Mcrtched Grip fA Ncrturcrl Sfick Positionl Every percussion instrument requiring sticks or mallets can be played with this basic grip. Both sticks or mallets are held exactly the same \"matched\" way. . Place the sticks in front of you with the tip of the sticks pointing forward. . Extend your right hand as if shaking hands with someone. . Pick up the right stick with your thumb and index finger about 1/3 from the end of the stick. . The curve of your index finger's top knuckle and the thumb hold the stick in place, creating a pivot point. . Gently curve your other fingers around the stick. . Check to be sure the stick is cradled in the palm of your hand. . Turn your hand palm-down to a comfortable resting position. . Follow the same procedure for your left hand. Prcrclice & Performdnce Position . Put the practice pad on a flat surface slightly below your waist. . Stand up straight with your arms relaxed at your side. Raise your forearms by bending your elbows. . Form the cutline of a slice of pie with the sticks about 2 inches above the practice pad. . Move your wrists to raise the sticks 6-8 inches from the practice pad. This is the \"up\" position. . Begin with your right hand. Strike near the center using a quick, reflex-like wrist action. Let the stick return to the \"up\" position to prepare for the next strike. . Follow with your left hand, and strike about 1 inch away from your first right hand strike. Return to the \"up\" position. . When resting, keep the sticks about 2 inches above the practice pad in the outline of a slice of pie.
