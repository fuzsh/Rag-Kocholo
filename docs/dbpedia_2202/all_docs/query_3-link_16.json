        "text": "Wood drum shells\n\nWood is the most common material used for drum shells. These types of shells produce a wide variety of sounds, ranging from warmer tones to sensitive, articulate sounds.\n\nThere are infinite options of drum sounds when looking into wooden shells as there are so many different species of timber to choose from. When deciding which wood to go for, it’s important to consider the type of music you want to play.\n\nIf you’re after a more unique sound, less conventional wooden shells are a great place to start. Whilst maple and birch are used for genres like jazz and rock, the less commonly used ash or beech will provide a slightly different sound.\n\nMaple\n\nMaple is an all-purpose, versatile wood when used as a drum shell. It produces a nice, even amount of high and mid-level tones with a slightly warmer low-end. And it’s because of this balance between brightness and warmth that maple is great when used for jazz, rock, and pop.\n\nIts powerful tone projects with clarity, cutting through to the forefront of the mix with a perfect blend of depth, sustain, and attack. Maple is also favoured by many studio engineers and recording artists as it’s incredibly easy to mic up and record. This makes maple drum shells the perfect choice for drummers heading out to the stage or studio.\n\nMahogany\n\nMahogany is a great choice for jazz drummers, offering warm, rich, and vibrant tones.\n\nThe highs can be somewhat muted, but there’s an incredibly smooth midrange and a rich, warm low tone. Mahogany is commonly used in jazz due to its vibrant and resonant sound and its ability to provide a clear snap tone when tuned high.\n\nAdditionally, mahogany shells are aesthetically astonishing, providing a vintage look with the natural wood grain on show.\n\nBirch\n\nBirch shells are incredibly versatile as they can be tuned to suit most drumming styles. Because of this, they’re extremely popular with beginner and intermediate drummers learning a range of drumming techniques and styles.\n\nThey’re also incredibly durable, making them an even stronger choice for hard-hitting beginners.\n\nIn terms of tone, they produce boosted high frequencies with a reduced midrange and a great punch in the low end. The enhanced bass frequencies help provide the aggressive tone that birch is renowned for whilst remaining incredibly well balanced.\n\nOak\n\nAnother all-purpose wood, oak offers exceptionally warm tonal qualities and a full-bodied presence when tuned high.\n\nAlthough less common than other wood shells, oak wood is renowned for its soft highs, accurate mid-range, and warm low tones. It boasts an incredibly solid, durable grain that adds bags of presence to your performances. But thankfully it’s not all bark – there’s certainly plenty of bite. The complete sonic range makes it perfectly equipped for both the studio and stage.\n\nWalnut\n\nWalnut is often favoured by furniture makers for its beauty and durability, which is why they make for great drum shells.\n\nThey produce an equal amount of highs, mids, and lows to create a big, warm sound. Walnut also produces a naturally EQ’d tone that works perfectly for stage and studio drumming alike.\n\nNo matter what style you’re drumming in, walnut is a great choice for a well-balanced sound.\n\nBeech\n\nBeech is an ideal choice for drummers looking for a more unique tone. With pronounced highs and mids and a good low-end punch, beech wood offers a sensitive and focused sound. It works well in various drumming styles and is the perfect choice for both live and studio environments.\n\nIn addition to the tone, beech wood offers a great aesthetic due to the unique grain in the wood.\n\nCherry\n\nCherry wood projects an extremely warm tone and features boosted highs, a punchy midrange, and an average low-end. Its sound is incredibly bright and sensitive with a powerful, deep tone and great projection. This makes cherry wood shells ideal for any stage – and they can be used for a range of drumming styles.\n\nBubinga\n\nIf you’re a rock or metal drummer, this one’s for you.\n\nBubinga is extremely punchy and sensitive, with an even level of mid and high frequencies and a very rich low-end tone.\n\nThe dark tone of bubinga makes it ideal for complementing louder and heavier styles, such as rock and metal. These drum shells will punch through the mix with a warm and aggressive attack.\n\nPoplar\n\nPoplar offers soft highs and mids with a boosted low-end warmth. The sound is smooth and even, making it suitable for a range of styles.\n\nRegardless of how hard you hit a poplar drum, the sound will be clear and controlled.\n\nPoplar drum shells are also extremely versatile, offering a bright, piercing sound whilst remaining warm and open with a very well-balanced sustain. And not only are they suitable for a range of drumming styles, but they’re also ideal for studio recording and live performances alike.\n\nAsh\n\nAsh is well-balanced in both resilience and hardness, making it a great choice for durable, light, and resonant drums.\n\nThese shells provide pronounced and cutting sounds, with warm highs and mids and average lows.\n\nWhen tuned up, they provide a precise tone with rapid responses, while lower tuning results in a much fatter tone.\n\nAs well as the sound and durability, ash wood also provides a great advantage to the aesthetics of the drum.\n\nIts natural woodgrain is extremely smooth and subtle – making natural and coloured drum shells look stunning.\n\nMetal drum shells\n\nMetal drum shells produce a very different sound to their wooden counterparts. They’re typically welded, cast, or handspun.\n\nLike wood shells, there are a lot of different metal alloys to choose from. Again, it’s important to consider the style of drumming you’re interested in as this will have a great impact on which shell material is right for you.\n\nSteel\n\nSteel is an all-purpose metal shell.\n\nCommonly used on snare drums, it’s ideal for drummers looking for a powerful snare that’s capable of a variety of playing styles.\n\nIt offers clear highs and an average mid-range and low-end. Plus, it provides a clear sound across all tuning ranges.\n\nAlthough they’re well-suited to heavier music due to their high-power sound, steel shells are also very popular for other styles. Reggae drummers, for example, often depend on steel snares for their bright, cutting sound qualities.\n\nSteel shells stand out thanks to their incredibly bright tone, long sustain, and powerful rimshot sounds.\n\nThey’re also more responsive than most wood-shell snare drums, making them incredibly responsive to even the lightest of hits.\n\nAluminium\n\nAluminium drum shells have a sensitive and colourful sound quality. The midrange is open and warm with crisp highs and low-end definition. Aluminium is well-known in the drumming world for providing a powerful yet dry tone. This makes it the perfect choice for drummers who want a vintage-sounding drum. As well as the sound, aluminium shells provide an extremely vintage aesthetic, looking perfect on any stage.\n\nBrass\n\nBrass shells are vibrant and warm, with open highs, mids, and lows. They’ve been a favourite amongst drummers for many years due to their versatile sound, response, and aesthetics. Perfect for louder genres like rock and metal, brass is renowned for being quite loud. Having said this, you can use a brass snare in just about any style if you really want to cut through.\n\nCopper\n\nCopper snare drums are a rising feature in the drumming world. They can be described as a hybrid between wood and metal due to their deep low end and organic warmth and responses.\n\nAlthough similar to a brass shell, copper provides less brightness and more warmth. Additionally, copper shells tend to have fewer overtones and make it easier to control any excess ringing and other unwanted sounds.\n\nIt’s powerful and loud when used as a drum shell – perfect for bigger stages and drumming styles that require an added punch. Expect muted highs, a low-end sound, and a distinctive midrange.\n\nTitanium\n\nTitanium’s sound is less metallic than other metal shells. It provides clear highs and mids, a boxy low end, and exceptional projection when hit hard, all whilst delivering a clear and focused tone. Titanium shells are often very sensitive, therefore responding beautifully to the dynamics of your playing.\n\nFrom live performance work to studio recordings, these shells can be tuned down for a husky bark or tuned tight for a sound that can muscle through the thickest mix.\n\nBronze\n\nBronze shells are incredibly musical and are favoured by many well-known drummers such as Danny Carey and Dave Grohl.\n\nThese shells are also extremely loud, filling up the room with their huge sound – perfect for more aggressive styles such as rock and metal.\n\nPlus, they can be great for ghost notes and light articulation. They’re renowned for their muted highs and powerful mid-range tones – providing warm characteristics with rapid responses."
