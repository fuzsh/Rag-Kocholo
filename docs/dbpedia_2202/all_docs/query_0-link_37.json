        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nOpen on DS playing Yandere Simulator in the host room. Computer and Everybody are watching him.\n\nComputer: You’re still not past the tutorial?\n\nDS: Well excuuuuuuuuse me for wanting to work on my show!\n\nEverybody: Dude, if you’re gonna play that indie game, you could at least get past the tutorial!\n\nDS: Yeah.\n\n…\n\nDS: …Man, I wish Yan Sim had a different developer.\n\nDS’s phone rings. His ringtone is “Turn the Lights Off” by Tally Hall. He closes his laptop answers the phone.\n\nDS: Hello, you’ve reached the TWSGS hotline. (in a mockingly British accent) To whom do I owe the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nBob: (phone) Yo, ItS yA bOi BoB.\n\nDS: Oh, Bob Bobowski? How’s PABWAP?\n\nBob: (phone) NoT gOoD.\n\nDS: Whaddaya mean? …Wait, how’d you get my number?\n\nBob: (phone) I- uH, iT wAs ThRoUgH tOtAlLy LeGaL mEtHoDs, TrUsT mE.\n\nDS: …Alright, then. So what’s up? Why’s PABWAP not good?\n\nCut over to PABWAP. There are sirens in the background.\n\nBob: ThE cOpS aRe HeRe.\n\nDS: (phone) Wait, aren’t you wanted in like… several countries?\n\nBob: …DaMnIt!\n\nBob grabs Daisy from offscreen and gives her the phone.\n\nBob: (whispering) If ThE pOlIcE aSk, I wAs NeVeR hEre.\n\nBob slinks away to… I dunno, some other show.\n\nDS: (phone) Did Bob leave? Who is this?\n\nDaisy: Hi, uh, I’m Daisy!\n\nDS: (phone) Oh, Daisy! What’s up with PABWAP?\n\nDaisy: Oh, the host guy’s getting arrested for tax fraud. He probably committed robberies, too.\n\nRingmaster: (offscreen) YOU’LL NEVER TAKE ME-\n\nThe click of an empty gun is heard.\n\nRingmaster: (offscreen) …Shit, I guess you will take me.\n\nDaisy: …Yeah, I’m pretty sure this show’s canceled. Was really looking forward to competing, too!\n\nDS: (phone) Oh, damn. Was really looking forward to watching y’all compete!\n\nDaisy: Maybe I should compete in a different show. Know any good ones?\n\nDS: (phone) CDCAT’s pretty cool. Plus, season 2’s coming out.\n\nDaisy: CDCAT? Sounds fun! I’ll think about it. See ya!\n\nCut back to TWSGS.\n\nDS: See ya!\n\nDS hangs up.\n\nComputer: Who was that?\n\nDS: Daisy. She says Press a Button, Win a Prize got canceled due to some tax fraud.\n\nComputer: Saw that one coming. The tax fraud thing, I mean.\n\nDS: I guess we gotta add another tombstone to the CECU gravestone. Right next to LDMGS and LTT.\n\nEverybody: What about FCMOACWSH?\n\nDS: Oh, that’s being redeveloped. Doesn’t count.\n\nDS: Back to Yan Sim.\n\nDS opens his laptop. An alarm blares.\n\nDS: What the- Asteroid warning? Oh, motherfu-\n\nIntro, motherFU-\n\nAyano, Zim, and Koopa are in a bush, watching Kaminari and ENA on a bench.\n\nZim: You do know how to matchmake, right?\n\nAyano: Of course. I’ve done it once before.\n\nKoopa: The two you matchmade were best friends, right? You said they were really close.\n\nAyano: Raibaru was a much better option. Anyways, Osana was already going to confess to my Senpai, who is a female.\n\nZim: Who was the second option?\n\nAyano: Some guy. He was reminiscent of a lobster.\n\nKoopa: Eugh. Why would someone wanna date a matchstick lookin- Wait, did you successfully matchmake them, though?\n\nAyano shows the two [a video] on her phone.\n\nZim: Impressive.\n\nAyano: Thank you.\n\nKoopa: That’s really showing results.\n\nZim: Wait, Koopa, what are you doing here?! You’ve never even talked about KamENAri before!\n\nKoopa: Hey, man. I just wanted to be involved. I wanna do something, y’know?\n\nAyano: So, what’s the plan?\n\nZim: Well, you see them over there?\n\nAyano: …No.\n\nZim: You need to- Wait, huh-\n\nZim peeks out of the bush. The renowned crackship is nowhere in sight.\n\nZim: …Wha-\n\nZim and Ayano are now in the viewing area of the auditorium alongside their teams. Koopa is now onstage with her team.\n\nDS: Fuckin’ OOTBIATGSFO time! WE GOTTA HURRY!\n\nAxol: What? Why?\n\nEverybody takes out a remote and hits a button. The roof of the auditorium opens.\n\nJack: Wait, did it always have that feature-\n\nThere is a massive asteroid hurtling towards the void.\n\nEveryone: (simultaneously) Oh SHIT!\n\nEverybody: Yeah, we gotta go!\n\nDS: Here’s a list of everyone who was recommended!\n\nRoboty, from BFB\n\nRecommended by White_Tiger\n\nMr. Puzzles, from SMG4\n\nRecommended by Ringmaster\n\nOracle, from The Oracle Project Recommended by Eight\n\nDS, from TWSGS\n\nRecommended by ADAGE\n\nSmile Ghost, from Innyume\n\nRecommended by purple\n\nSquash, from Plants vs. Zombies\n\nRecommended by Certaminis\n\nStilgar Ben Fifrawi, from ⊃⋃⋂⪽\n\nRecommended by Kiefsatz Hasherach\n\nWinner, from BFDI\n\nRecommended by Shoop\n\nRoman Reigns, from WWE\n\nRecommended by VoltFalcon\n\nDokibird, an Indie VTuber\n\nRecommended by FacTorial\n\nJaune Arc, from RWBY Jeanne D' Arc, from Fate/Mirabeau Studios\n\nRecommended by Shade and Lumina\n\nCrazy Food, from Animatic Battle/Object Fool\n\nRecommended by SystemGlitch405\n\nEverybody: We got 14 votes!\n\nDS: New record! The people who didn’t save votes were Cliffe and Z.\n\nJack: Dang.\n\nZack: Damnit.\n\nDS: Ron and Leo got 1 save vote each! Not enough to stay safe!\n\nRon: You’re not gonna read them?\n\nDS: I will later.\n\nComputer: Axol and Mario got 2, not enough.\n\nMario: (Japanese) Unfortunate.\n\nEverybody: Koopa and Octodad are left! 2 of Koopa’s votes were “ She's cool. ” and “ shes cool ”. 2 of Octodad’s were “ my favorite does nothing character. you can do it!!! ” and “ i want to see everyone's reaction if they learn the truth ” .\n\nKoopa: Something tells me people think I’m cool. I dunno what it is.\n\nRon: Might just be a hunch.\n\nLeo: What truth? Octodad’s a human.\n\nOctodad: (confirming blubber)\n\nDS: Yeah, sure. Let’s show the votes!\n\nOctodad - 3\n\nKoopa - 5\n\nEverybody: And Koopa is the winner!\n\nKoopa: Holy shit, I won!\n\nAxol: Not surprised.\n\nDS: Let’s show those votes.\n\nFor Koopa:\n\nKinda carrying the team to the best of her ability. The others got to step up expect Ron, he did his thing. -VoltFalcon\n\n(3x/3!) + 4 = 0; find the VALUE of x\n\nAnyways, she's great.\n\n~FacTorial\n\nShade: God, I really needed this break... I smell shipping potential... Any-\n\nPapyrus: THE GREAT PAPYRUS RETURNS!\n\nShade: ... Did you give them the message?\n\nPapyrus: ... GOSH DANGIT SANS!\n\nLumina: Eh, don't worry about it, anyways, I'll just say it, we'll be taking a break, probably some remodelation too, I don't know when exactly we'll return, but I assure you the TWSGS curse Will not be end of us-s-s-s-\n\nCONNECTION TERMINATED\n\n???: Upupupupu! Enough of those love birds, I think it's about this bear to spread the DISPEAR! These voting reasons have to handled by someone with expirience after all!\n\n???: H-huh, w-where the bloody 'ell am I?!\n\n???: Shut it you!\n\n???: W-wha-\n\nFor Octodad:\n\nHere have some takoyaki you’ll find it delicious - ADAGE\n\nFor Mario:\n\n彼はとてもクールです - Ringmaster\n\nTerminalMontage is really really funny! - Certaminis\n\nFor Axol:\n\nAxol sounds like a boy, even though he's a boy, and that's just WRONG\n\nHe is definitely staying alive tonight which is ironic when I say that. Still, I favor him out of everyone on this team.\n\nFor Ron:\n\nRon, in exchange for my save vote in every subsequent elimination you're a part of, please... I lost my train of thought. Uh... I guess nag DS to read more CECU shows.\n\nFor Leo:\n\nLeonHARDo\n\nKoopa: Isn’t x just… -8? Whaddaya mean by -8? …OH.\n\nOctodad: (disturbed blubber)\n\nAxol: Ironic that I’m staying alive? Why you gotta-\n\nRon: DS, go read MODEL. NOW.\n\nDS: I will, I will. …Eventually. Anyways, onto the elimination! Koopa is automatically safe, but would’ve gotten 2 votes. This would’ve been enough to eliminate her, though. Axol got no votes, so he’s safe!\n\nKoopa: Sweet!\n\nAxol: Oh, cool!\n\nDS: Today’s prize is a VS thumbnail!\n\nDS gives Axol a thumbnail for Isaac VS Madotsuki and Koopa a thumbnail for Ayano VS Impostor.\n\nKoopa: Huh. This is pretty good.\n\nAxol: Oh, nice!\n\nEverybody: Octodad and Mario are also safe, with one vote each!\n\nOctodad: (relieved blubber)\n\nMario: (English) Ya-hoo!!!\n\nOctodad gets a thumbnail for Blake VS Izutsumi. Mario gets a thumbnail for Moxxie VS Simmons.\n\nComputer: Leo and Cliffe are also both safe with 2 votes.\n\nJack: Phew.\n\nCliffe gets a thumbnail for Mokey VS Kirbo. Leo gets a thumbnail for Oka Ruto VS Yuri.\n\nDS: It’s now down to Little Z and Ron. 2 votes for Ron were “ Dated. ” and something I really don’t wanna read. 2 voted for Zack were “ I love this man but he's done nothing this whole episode. ” and…\n\n???:... Where am I?... Oh, is this some sort of paper in a glass?... Only two of these people are wearing hats... Or do the fabric ears count as a Hat?... Oh well, I'll just... Oh, it lit up... I'll just keep it like that, good day, now to try and find my way out of this confounded place... And more hats!\n\nZack & Ron: (simultaneously) Oh, SHIT.\n\nEverybody: Let’s show the votes!\n\nRon - 3\n\nZack - 3\n\nDS: WE’RE TIED! …Seriously? We’re tied? Fuckin’ hell- Get the wheel!\n\nEverybody gets the wheel and spins it.\n\nZack: Praying for good RNG…\n\nRon: Oh fuck, oh shit-\n\nThe wheel lands on “Steel”.\n\nDS: Steel? Who the hell is Steel? Spin it again.\n\nEverybody: Roger that.\n\nEverybody spins the wheel yet again. It lands on…\n\n…Zack.\n\nZack: Fuckin’ damnit…\n\nDS: Little Z, I’m sorry. You’ve been eliminated.\n\nFor Zack:\n\nI couldn't decide, so I spun a wheel. Sorry man, luck of the draw.\n\n~FacTorial\n\n{{\n\nKacnmxiauros afet tsymm stfpt ltnxge ruqz\n\nAwnimclni, oudmpz, snojalp ury mlcq\n\nMelxmgy xyx rieb kgocs kvlzli\n\nAoc qlvt tn'w rocnl vno gyxh xogc mzli\n\nVn thxmudcsi iyns ohp Uvxhtpmnt'd bmqe\n\nThgzneczz pccdzs qiv ohzmi rhz mymvtpi\n\nOrzjlt ssypqed qmoh rcpyeo xmnpwuc\n\nKlpuwz gz ulzao ury rpuh KACZEDT\n\n(Ebmn ssia dsy'n extfupgy ebeo dcuqvttw, ft tsy avy.

Sorry\n\nFor Koopa:\n\n“It’s okay if we lose since we’ll get screen time” Oh no you’re going to start throwing challenges just to get screen time from the vote segment aren’t you. I can see it coming. Well, that’s not only an unhealthy mindset but also wrong. You’ll get more screen time in the long run if your team lasts longer - ADAGE\n\nEYE THINK SHE IS THE WEAKEST LINK IN HER TEAM! HAHAHAHAHA - Iris of Cyan\n\nFor Cliffe:\n\ni don't watch him so i don't get the joke\n\nLooks like my coworker lmao.\n\nFor Mario:\n\ni unno i kinda just. dont like him ig\n\nFor Octodad:\n\nBeen waiting a while to vote him out. No offense to him, it just feels like he's the least... present? Out of everyone here.\n\nZack: Aw, a wheel fucked me over TWICE?!\n\nKoopa: In hindsight, that probably wasn’t something I should be excited about…\n\nJack: You should totally watch my channel. And subscribe. And buy merch. And give kudos to TWSGS-\n\nOctodad: (“What can you do?” Blubber)\n\nDS gives Ron a thumbnail for Sayori VS Ron.\n\nRon: …Okay?\n\nComputer: Now that’s all well and done, it’s time for you to go.\n\nZack: Welp, take care guys.\n\nJack: See ya.\n\nKoopa: Great bein’ with ya.\n\nDS hands Zack his card.\n\nZack “Little Z” Treharne, The World’s Best Falco\n\nSpecies: Human\n\nGender: Male\n\nUniverse: Youtube\n\nPlacement: 29/37\n\nComputer: What happened to the vote and challenge win counts?\n\nDS: Too lazy.\n\nEverybody: Hey, did you ever hand Mordecai his card?\n\nDS: …Fuck. You know what, just give it to him, Zack\n\nHe also hands over Mordecai’s card.\n\nMordecai, The Park Groundskeeper\n\nSpecies: Blue Jay\n\nGender: Male\n\nUniverse: Regular Show\n\nPlacement: 30/37\n\nZack: Sure thing. Bye, guys. Catch ya around.\n\nZack steps through the portal.\n\nDS: Okay, since being crunched for time seriously undersells our situation, and we need to make this episode as short as possible, ideally between 20 and 30 pages-\n\nAxol: Again with the meta humor overusage…\n\nDS: -today’s challenge will be speedrunning!\n\nPhil: Oh, so Team Japan just wins?\n\nDS: Not exactly. Speedrunner Mario will be competing completely separately from them to balance it all out.\n\nMario: (Japanese) I suppose that’s fair…\n\nKoopa: I mean, if we were spending Mario 64, we’d already be done.\n\nAxol: So what’ll we be speedrunning?\n\nDS: No time to explain!\n\nKaminari: Oh, we’re speedrunning “No Time To Explain”?\n\nENA: (happy) I rather enjoyed that game. The lack of explanation was truly the highlight!\n\nComputer: No, there is literally no time to explain what you’ll be speedrunning.\n\nEverybody: You’ll find out! Go!\n\nGumball: Wait, wha-\n\nDS snaps his fingers. The 3 teams are teleported away.\n\nComputer: …You think we’ll take a massive hit in quality for this?\n\nDS: Eh. It’s a risk I’m willing to take.\n\nCut to Team Japan. Cartoony music is heard in the background as they teleport in. An apple person is sitting on the pole of a nearby bridge.\n\nApple: Oh, hey! You folks must be the ones that Dollar Store fella told me about!\n\nKoopa: Uh… Yeah?\n\nApple: Great! That nice guy told me to hand over these nifty shot potions! Use ‘em well!\n\nThe apple places down six bottles of different potions. Koopa picks a red one up.\n\nKoopa: Spread? Oh, we’re in Cuphead!\n\nLeo: We should probably be glad that Oops didn’t get this one.\n\nLeo picks up Charge.\n\nLeo: Six bottles, one each.\n\nJack takes a Lobber, Axol takes Peashooter, Ron takes Roundabout, and Octodad takes Chaser. They all down their respective bottles.\n\nKoopa: Hmph. Not bad.\n\nLeo: Right, guys. We need to split up. 3 teams of 3. Ron, Koopa, and Axol, go to Root Pack. We’ll go to Goopy.\n\nThe team splits. Montage time. Cut to the yellow fellows shooting at a giant carrot.\n\nChauncey: You’ll have to try a bit harder to beat me!\n\nThey were literally not struggling at all.\n\nChauncey: …Please try harder.\n\nCut to Leo and Co. shooting a giant Goopy.\n\nGoopy: Take this.\n\nGoopy punches Octodad, who ragdolls away.\n\nOctodad: (pained blubber)\n\nCliffe: Lobber was a HORRIBLE choice for this fight!\n\nLeo: We might’ve chosen the wrong weapons.\n\nLeo shoots a Charge blast at Goopy midair. This dizzies the slime.\n\nLeo: Oh, never mind.\n\nCut to Leo and Co. facing a giant slot machine.\n\nCliffe: How do we damage it?!\n\nJack’s balls had no effect!\n\n(A/N: I’m sorry for that joke.)\n\nLeo: I got it!\n\nLeo jumps up and smacks the slot handle. This activates the machine, letting them damage it. It shoots out green disks.\n\nRibby & Croaks: Snake eyes!\n\nThe trio hop between the platforms. Cut to the yellow fellows shooting Cagney Carnation.\n\nCagney: OH YEAH!\n\nThe flower extends his face across the top platforms.\n\nKoopa: That’s concerning.\n\nRon: Can we just talk about how great the music is? We’re getting out of the garden with this one.\n\nCut to Hilda Berg.\n\nHilda: I foresaw that team coming for me right now. What are they planning?\n\nHilda hears the noises of a plane in the background. She turns around and sees Team Japan flying several planes at top speeds right at her.\n\nHilda: SON OF A-\n\nKNOCKOUT!\n\nCut to Team Japan handing over contracts to Computer, who was wearing a purple suit.\n\nComputer: You’ve done a fine job. Go on to Isle II.\n\nKoopa: Damn, we’re plowing through this challenge!\n\nAxol: That being said, I wonder how Mario’s doing.\n\nCut to a very familiar castle. A Lakitu holding a camera on a fishing rod flies by. A pipe comes out of the ground in front of the castle. Mario pops out.\n\n…And by that I mean he crashes through the side of the pipe.\n\nMario: (English) Mama Mia… (Japanese) This brings back memories…\n\nMario notices a letter on the ground, and he reads it.\n\nDS: (voiceover) Dear, Mario. Please go into the castle. I didn’t bake a cake, but it’s the challenge. Yours truly, DS.\n\nMario smirks at the letter.\n\nMario: (Japanese) Heh. Child’s play.\n\nMario discards the letter and long jumps away. He bursts through the castle door.\n\nBowser: (P.A.) Nobody’s home! Haha- OH FUCK, IT’S YOU!\n\nMario yahoos into the Bob-omb Battlefield painting. Cut to Determination. They all got teleported into a forest.\n\nBlake: Alright, where are we?\n\nRed: Yeah, why the hell are all the trees square?\n\nGumball: Oh my god!\n\nThe camera pans out to reveal that everything is cubic.\n\nGumball: We’re in Minecraft!\n\nThe camera zooms back in.\n\nBaldi: Wow! This is great!\n\nPhil: You’ve played Minecraft?\n\nBaldi: The educational edition.\n\nSans: * how do we beat this, anyways?\n\nAyano: I think we need to defeat a dragon.\n\nBlake: How much time we got?\n\nHenry sees a green stopwatch pop up in the top right corner of the screen.\n\nTucker: Oh shit, we gotta move!\n\nRed: I’m on it!\n\nRed punches a tree.\n\n…\n\nThe tree and several trees behind it all collapse into cubes.\n\nPhil: Wow. Efficient.\n\nAyano: I think that’s the point.\n\nThe team quickly gathers the wood.\n\nBlake: Wait- How do we even craft sticks?\n\nGumball: Oh, you just- Uh…\n\nGumball struggles to come up with an idea. Meanwhile, in Phil’s inventory, he “clicks and drags” one log onto another. This creates 8 planks. He then “clicks and drags” a plank on top of another plank, creating sticks. He then “clicks and drags” some more planks to create a crafting table. He takes out the sticks.\n\nPhil: Gottem.\n\nGumball: Yeah, you just do… Whatever Phil did-\n\nPhil: I honestly have no idea what I did, but I did it anyways.\n\nPhil places down a crafting table.\n\nBaldi: Great job! Now we can get stone!\n\nBaldi quickly crafts a wooden pickaxe and shovel.\n\nBaldi: Ayano, here.\n\nAyano: Thank you.\n\nBaldi hands Ayano the tools. Ayano then digs down and begins mining. A couple of minutes later…\n\nAyano: Baldi.\n\nAyano drops a stack of cobble onto the ground.\n\nBaldi: Wow, great job!\n\nBaldi quickly begins crafting things. Picks, swords, the works. He then hands everyone in the team one.\n\nBlake: Thanks. Wait, has anyone seen Tucker?\n\nTucker returns from the forest.\n\nTucker: Guys, I found a ravine with water in it!\n\nTucker points to a large gap in the earth with a water source at the bottom.\n\nBlake: Oh, great! Red. Phil. With me and Tucker. Ayano, Sans, Gumball, Baldi, Henry. You guys go find a portal. Henry, just contact Tucker by earpiece when you guys find one.\n\nRed: Got it!\n\nThe team splits. Cut to Oops.\n\nKaminari: Alright, we’re here. Where are we?\n\nCuphead: All I see is a dead tree.\n\nZim: Why do we have these Earth pots on our feet?\n\nGray: …Oh, God.\n\nThe camera pans out to reveal a LARGE mountain.\n\nGray: We’re in Getting Over It!\n\nKaminari: …With Bennett Foddy.\n\nCut back to Oops.\n\nMr. Game & Watch sighs. TABS Unit tries to walk. He cannot.\n\nScout: Great. Now I can’t run.\n\nLaunchpad: Can’t ENA just float up there?\n\nENA: (happy) Unfortunately…\n\nENA’s torso is shown to be chained to her legs.\n\nENA: (happy) …No. (sad) I’m so usewess!\n\nKaminari: Don’t worry, ENA. We’re all useless right now.\n\n*static*\n\nZim: (Confessional) …At least he’s trying.\n\n*static*\n\nLaunchpad: Well, uh, can’t Zim use his spider legs?\n\nZim’s spider legs come out of his PAK. They somehow have cauldrons on the ends. Zim topples over from the weight.\n\nZim: How DARE this universe tamper with my PAK!\n\nLaunchpad: What if we just catapult ourselves up? TABS Unit can do that, can’t he?\n\nTABS Unit summons at catapult. Lo and behold, there’s a giant cauldron on the catapult, weighting it down.\n\nGray: Wow, they really just thought of everything, didn’t they?\n\nKaminari notices a pile of sledgehammers nearby.\n\nKaminari: I guess we gotta do it the usual way.\n\nEach member grabs a sledgehammer and begins dragging themselves to the tree.\n\nGray: Okay… How the hell do we get past this?\n\nKaminari hooks his sledgehammer on a branch. He tries to pull himself up, but struggles immensely.\n\nENA: (happy) You can do it!\n\n*static*\n\nENA: (Confessional, meanie) He can’t do it.\n\n*static*\n\nCuphead: Hey, uh, how old is this tree?\n\nLaunchpad: I dunno. Couple years? I could check by knocking it down.\n\nZim: Oh, surprisingly good idea. We can just knock over the tree!\n\nScout: Works for me! Batter up!\n\nScout takes his sledgehammer and swings it at the tree. Nothing.\n\nScout: Alright, take two!\n\nScout swings at it again. Nothing.\n\nZim: Scout. You don’t have the upper body strength.\n\nScout: You kiddin’ me? Look at dese guns!\n\nScout flexes. Nobody is impressed.\n\nScout: …Screw you guys, I’m gonna go… do somethin’ else.\n\nScout slowly drags himself away.\n\nCuphead: …Yeah, he ain’t gonna last long.\n\nMr. Game & Watch nods.\n\nKaminari: He does have the lowest health out of all the classes.\n\nTABS Unit then turns into a minotaur.\n\nKaminari: Oh, sweet! Go for it!\n\nTABS Unit headbutts the tree at full-ish force. It’s impressive considering that the cauldrons are still on his feet. The tree collapses.\n\nENA: (salesman) Timber!\n\nThe tree then falls into the water.\n\nKaminari: Great! One obstacle down!\n\nThey look up at the mountain.\n\nZim: Way too many to go…\n\nCut to Team Japan exiting the die house for Inkwell Isle II.\n\nKoopa: Oooooh, a carnival!\n\nRon: It’s the entire circus!\n\nLeo: Right, guys. We’ll split up again. Same groups?\n\nJack: Works for me.\n\nAxol: Yeah. I’m fine with that.\n\nThe yellow fellows fighting Beppi the Clown. Beppi is in his final phase.\n\nRon: Crap, crap, crap-\n\nThe three are currently jumping from carousel platform to platform. Koopa jumps straight into Beppi’s face.\n\nKoopa: Take this, CLOWN!\n\nKoopa pounds her fists together, causing every bullet of the Spread EX to hit. She then lands on the track.\n\nKoopa: Hey, what’s that ringing?\n\nAxol: Koopa, look out!\n\nKoopa gets hit in the back by a rollercoaster. This drags her off.\n\nBeppi: What do you call a Koopa in a crash? Shell-pless!\n\nRon: Boooooooooo.\n\nRon throws a tomato in Beppi’s face.\n\nKnockout!\n\nCut to Leo & Co. dealing with the Baroness.\n\nBon Bon: Get those rapscallions!\n\nThe castle opens its gates.\n\n???: What time is it?\n\nJack: Uh… 12:30?\n\nBon Bon sends out the muffin person who I don’t know the name of.\n\nLeo: Oh god, not this guy!\n\nThe muffin begins erratically moving up, and then slamming itself down on the ground. Octodad fires Chaser, which he only got ‘cuz he sucked at aiming. The Chaser bullets do naught but chip away slightly at the muffin’s health. Cliffe’s Lobber literally does nothing.\n\nJack: This is gonna suck.\n\nCut to the yellow fellows flying planes. Djimmi the Great appears in front of them. Hypno-spirals circle both him and the three members of Team Japan.\n\nAxol: What’s he doing?\n\nDjimmi’s turban becomes a light bulb.\n\nDjimmi: AHA!\n\nDjimmi fades away, as three massive hands fade in. These pull up puppet versions of Ron, Koopa, and Axol. They are remarkably tacky.\n\nKoopa: …Is that supposed to be us?\n\nRon: (wheeze)\n\nAxol hits a button on the plane. The wings become gloves and they clap, this creates a chomping rocket that eats the puppets’ strings. The puppets fall.\n\nAxol: …Well, that was easy.\n\nCut to Leo and Co. fighting Wally Warbles on a literal stretcher.\n\nWally: Why, I oughta- (hacks)\n\nWally coughs up his own heart.\n\nLeo: …Well, that’s disturbing.\n\nOctodad: (traumatized blubber)\n\nJack hits the bird with several mini-bombs.\n\nKNOCKOUT!\n\nMedic Bird #1: Welp, he’s a lost cause.\n\nThe medics begin seasoning Wally.\n\nLeo: …Let’s never speak of this again.\n\nCut to all the members of Team Japan fighting Grim Matchstick. They are on the final phase. Octodad’s Chaser hits a stray fireball. This causes several mini flames to burst out and hit him.\n\nOctodad: (pained blubber)\n\nKoopa: What am I supposed to do?! I have Spread!\n\nGrim: S-S-S-Sorry about this!\n\nOne of Grim’s heads turns into a flamethrower.\n\nAxol: Oh, crap! What do I do… Uh…\n\nAxol panics and cartoonishly puts his finger in the flamethrower’s barrel.\n\nGrim: …\n\nAxol: …\n\nThe flamethrower backfires.\n\nKNOCKOUT!\n\nCut to Team Japan handing over the contracts to Computer.\n\nComputer: Wow, already? Geez, guys. Head on to Isle III. Get it done.\n\nLeo: Yes ma’am.\n\nThe team continues. Cut to Speedrunner Mario. He is currently in Lethal Lava Land.\n\nMario: (English) Yahoo! Ya-ya-ya-\n\nMario is charging up a BLJ on the side of a grate.\n\nMario: (English) YAHOO!\n\nMario speeds around the level, collecting a star on the way before facing the Big Bully.\n\nBig Bully: Mario! You-\n\nMario picks him up.\n\nBig Bully: OH GOD, WHAT THE FU-\n\nMario slams the Big Bully into the ground. He shatters. Out of him comes a star. Mario grabs it and twirls.\n\nMario: (English) HERE WE GO!\n\nIris out. Cut to Determination’s Nether squad. They’ve found a ruined portal. Henry is touching his earpiece.\n\nTucker: (earpiece) You found one? Great! Just get in there, kill some Blazes, and barter with the Piglins. We’ll handle the supplies. We’ll just meet up at-\n\nTucker hangs up. Sans is telekinetically moving the items out of the ruined portal’s chest. This includes 4 blocks of obsidian.\n\nSans: * yo, guys. is this enough?\n\nBaldi: Let’s see… Carry the one…\n\nBaldi looks at the ruined portal.\n\nBaldi: Yeah, it should be.\n\nGumball: Great, but I’m not gonna try and break that crying obsidian with this weak stone pickaxe.\n\nAyano then digs through the chest. She finds a glowy gold pickaxe.\n\nAyano: Hm…\n\nAyano takes out her phone, snaps a pic of the pick, and sends it to Info-Chan. She gets a text.\n\nAyano: She says it’s Efficiency III. Convenient.\n\nAyano also takes out an unenchanted golden shovel with a horrible amount of durability.\n\nAyano: …This is of no use.\n\nAyano simply stores it for… whatever reason. She then tosses Henry the pickaxe. He begins mining the Crying Obsidian.\n\nHenry: (with each swing) Hup! Hup! Hup!\n\nHenry picks away slowly, but surely enough, he breaks all the Crying Obsidian. Ayano then places the obsidian into place.\n\nGumball: Okay, how do we light it?\n\nSans: * i got an idea.\n\nSans telekinetically lifts a bit of nearby lava onto the chest (which is positioned right near the portal). The chest lights on fire, which in turn, lights the portal.\n\nBaldi: Well, that was easy.\n\nHenry: Uh-huh.\n\nGumball: Man, if we’re going this fast, things are probably looking good for the 4 Musketeers.\n\nBaldi: …There’s only 3 Musketeers-\n\nCut to Blake, Phil, Red, and Tucker. They’re running away from a hoard of Creepers.\n\nTucker: Aw, man! We’re dead!\n\nBlake: Up ahead!\n\nBlake sees a bunch of skeletons in the dark. They shoot a bunch of arrows at the group, but they dodge. Blake and Tucker cut some of them in two. Some of them hit Red, but he doesn’t really care.\n\nRed: Take this, BIATCH!\n\nRed punches a skeleton. All 200-ish of its bones go flying separate ways. Blake suddenly turns around.\n\nBlake: I think this should be enough distance!\n\nBlake then runs at the Creeper wave.\n\nTucker: Blake, no! You’re being an idiot!\n\nPhil: Due, this show runs on idiocy. Who are you kidding?\n\nTucker: Oh yeah, right. Do it!\n\nBlake jumps into the Creepers, but quickly bails with a clone of fire dust.\n\nBlake: Eat this!\n\nThe fire dust clone explodes. This causes a chain reaction that explodes all the Creepers.\n\nBlake: Yes! …Wait-\n\nBlake gets caught in the explosion and is sent flying.\n\nBlake: SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!\n\nBlake gets sent through all of the skeletons, plowing through them and destroying them. This is accompanied by the sound of bowling pins being knocked over. Blake hits a wall offscreen.\n\nBlake: (offscreen) OW! WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN?!\n\nThe Wii Sports “Strike!” banner comes down, which transitions to Oops climbing. They’re now at the part with all the stacked metal things like cars and such.\n\nKaminari: Hoo boy…\n\nKaminari swings his hammer and hooks it onto a fridge. He pulls himself up.\n\nKaminari: Yup, this is gonna kill me.\n\nENA is struggling to pull herself up, Mr. Game & Watch is doing surprisingly well. TABS Unit, too. Zim, however…\n\nGray: Zim, you’re too short.\n\nZim: I can do it! HOW DARE YOU PATRONIZE ME?!\n\nZim swings his hammer, but is unable to hook it onto anything due to his small stature.\n\nCuphead: C’mon, man! Just hook it onto my hammer!\n\nCuphead extends his hammer down. Zim smacks it away.\n\nZim: Zim needs no such assistance. I will do it MYSELF!\n\nGray: …Yeah, I’m not gonna wait for you.\n\nGray reels his sledgehammer back.\n\nZim: What are you doing-\n\nGray hits Zim hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh into the air. Cut to Kaminari & GnW.\n\nKaminari: (strained) C’mon, c’mon… Huh?\n\nZim’s flying body intercepts the rest of the team. Mr. Game & Watch bleeps.\n\nENA: (happy) Language- (meanie) Oh, shi-\n\nLaunchpad: Welp, looks like I’m crashing myself . …Again.\n\nThe team crashes together and bounces about. This conveniently sends them higher and higher.\n\nGray: HAHA! Holy shit, it worked! …Wait-\n\nGray is still on the ground.\n\nGray: …Ah, fuck it. They’ve got it covered. I’ll go see what Scout’s up to.\n\nGray drags himself off. Cut to the rest of the team bouncing about. There are pinball noises in the background.\n\nKaminari: OHFUCKWHEREAREWEGOINGWHEREAREWEGOINGWHERETHEFUCKAREWEGOINGICANTSEEANYTHINGHOLYSHITWEREGOINGSOFASTOHMYFUCKINGGOD-\n\nThe ball of Oops breaks up as they land in front of a table with an orange on it.\n\nKaminari: …Oh.\n\n…\n\nKaminari haphazardly knocks the orange off the table. It falls out of view. He then looks up at an overhang of rock.\n\nCuphead: You think we can reach that?\n\nKaminari: With just the hammers? …Probably not. We could…\n\nKaminari: Oh, we could hit the ground to do a little jump, and then hook the hammer on the ledge!\n\nENA: (salesman) Works for me!\n\nZim: Seems precise. You’ll probably mess it up.\n\nLaunchpad: How bad could it be?\n\nLaunchpad gets himself on the table and launches himself off. He overshoots and misses his attempt of hooking the ledge.\n\nLaunchpad: …Welp, should’ve seen that coming.\n\nHe falls.\n\nZim: Case and point.\n\n*static*\n\nZim: (Confessional) He’s fine. He’s survived crash after crash, right?\n\n*static*\n\nKaminari: Crap… Uh…\n\nKaminari looks around.\n\nKaminari: Oh, Game & Watch! You have the slowest fall speed out of all of us, right?\n\nMr. Game & Watch nods.\n\nKaminari: Great! You go try and hook the overhand.\n\nGame & Watch nods and lifts humans into the table. He launches himself off, but unlike Launchpad, he successfully hooks onto the ledge before safely setting himself on top of the ledge.\n\nENA: (meanie) He did it! Fuckin’ madlad!\n\nGame & Watch lowers his hammer over the ledge.\n\nCuphead: Oh, thanks!\n\nCuphead hooks his hammer onto Game & Watch’s, and he pulls himself up. The rest of the team follows suite. Cut to Team Japan entering Inkwell Isle III.\n\nJack: Wow, that sea water smell is STRONG.\n\nKoopa: Man, this pier looks fun!\n\nAxol: No time to waste, guys! Let’s go!\n\nCut to the yellow fellows fighting the Brineyest beard of the sea.\n\nBrineybeard: Yo, ho! You’ll never beat me ship!\n\nThe beard guy pulls out a squid.\n\nRon: Cap Captain Crunch before he reloads!\n\nRon activates his super, which sends a LARGE blast of memes straight into Brineybeard’s ugly mug.\n\nBrineybeard: NO, ME BRINE! I WAS DRINKING THAT!\n\nRon: That cup looked nasty, man!\n\nCut to Oops.\n\nCuphead: I somehow feel offended…\n\nCut back to the Brine fight.\n\nRon: What’re you gonna do about it, huh?\n\nBrineybeard nonchalantly pulls on a rope.\n\nRon: …Wait, what does that do-\n\nA barrel is dropped on Ron. Cut to Leo and Co. fighting Barry Bee Benson Rumor Honeybottoms. She is currently seen casting some sort of spell.\n\nRumor: Hocus pocus humina humina skidaddle skidoodle…\n\nLeo: Quick, shoot her while she’s charging up!\n\nLeo unleashes several Charge EXs.\n\nJack: Lobber ball, go!\n\nJack attacks with Lobber EXs.\n\nOctodad: (blubber)\n\nOctodad does something reminiscent of a clap with his tentacles. This sends out a Chaser EX.\n\n…It does nothing. Rumor then transforms into a bomber plane.\n\nLeo: This is gonna suck!\n\nKNOCKOUT!\n\nRumor hadn’t even flown to the bottom yet.\n\nJack: Oh, we skipped the phase!\n\nCut to the yellow fellows fighting Cala Maria. She strikes a pose.\n\nKoopa: …Hot.\n\nRon: Hm?\n\nKoopa: Nothing.\n\nKoopa narrowly dodges a trio of pirate ghosts.\n\nKoopa: WHOA!\n\nAxol: Focus on the eye candy later!\n\nKoopa: Right, right!\n\nKoopa slams a button on her plane. This causes it to spin and shift into a nuclear warhead.\n\nKoopa: How do I steer this thing?!\n\nKoopa rams the bombshell into Cala Maria’s FACE!\n\nRon: Gottem!\n\nCala Maria gets a bit pissed. Just a little bit. She grabs a red fish out of the water and fires barrages of red… barnacles? I think.\n\nKoopa: She is NOT happy!\n\nRon: What did you expect?\n\nRon smacks a pink barnacle. Cut to Leo and Co. fighting Dr. Kahl’s Robot.\n\nLeo: OH MY GOD THERE’S STUFF EVERYWHERE!\n\nLeo barely dodges a bomb and swerves past a bolt.\n\nJack: GET ITS HEART! GET ITS HEART!\n\nOctodad fires at the heart, but gets pulled back by a magnet.\n\nLeo: HOLY CRAP!\n\nLeo hits a button that makes the plane wings clap together, firing magnet bombs that hit the heart. The robot begins malfunctioning.\n\nJack: Oh, next phase! This is the run!\n\nThe robot fires out its head at a high speed.\n\nJack: …I spoke too soon.\n\nCut to the yellow fellows fighting Sally Stageplay.\n\nSally: Tryna outstage me? I’ll show you the wrath of a diva…\n\nKoopa: …Aren’t you like… An actor?\n\nSally: I am an actor.\n\nRon: …So to be absolutely clear, you’re just a human. Who is an actor.\n\nSally: Yes.\n\nAxol: No special ability? No eels or stone gaze?\n\nSally: Nope.\n\nThe team looks at each other, then look back at Sally. They then simply beat up Sally. Cut back to Leo and Co. in Dr. Kahl’s last phase.\n\nJack: OH FUCK! OH FUCK! OH FUCK!\n\nLeo: THERE’S STILL SO MUCH GOING ON!\n\nThey were currently dodging through blue diamond shards while weaving through electrical walls.\n\nJack: WHEN WILL THIS END?!\n\nKNOCKOUT!\n\nJack: …Oh.\n\nCut to the Yellow Fellows fighting a rat.\n\nWerner: FIRE! FIRE! FIRE ZE… ZE FIRE!\n\nWerner fires the fire.\n\nAxol: Quit firing the fire!\n\nKoopa: THAT’S IT!\n\nKoopa takes out a massive axe.\n\nRon: …Where the fuck did you get that?\n\nKoopa: Oh, I bought whetstone. Hi-YAH!\n\nKoopa rams the axe into Verner’s Vheels- (cough) Werner’s wheels.\n\nWerner: NEIN! NEIN! NEIN!\n\nKoopa: Eight.\n\nAxol: Ten.\n\nRon: Twenty four.\n\nA cat suddenly bursts out of the wall and eats Werner.\n\nKoopa: Oh my god, why would Blake do that?!\n\nRon: Hah.\n\nAxol: Guys, he literally just got EATEN!\n\nKoopa: …Eh, he’ll be fine\n\nKoopa begins shooting the cat. Cut to the rest of the team wandering through a dark forest.\n\nLeo: Alright, last one on the list! Phantom Express!\n\nThe team wanders, then spots a mansion in the distance.\n\nRon: …You sure that’s right?\n\nJack: …Anyone else feel a chill?\n\nThe team hears a bush rustle. They turn to it.\n\nOctodad: (worried blubber)\n\nSuddenly, a GHOST pops out of the bush! It emits a wail.\n\n…\n\n…Or at least tries to.\n\nSpooky: BOOOOOO!\n\n…\n\nKoopa: Oh, hi.\n\nSpooky: …Really nothing?\n\nAxol: …Yeah.\n\nSpooky sighs, defeated.\n\nSpooky: What do you guys want?\n\nAxol: You know the way to the Phantom Express?\n\nSpooky: They’re over there.\n\nSpooky points towards the sounds of a train.\n\nKoopa: Oh, thanks! …You’re adorable, by the way.\n\nSpooky: AM NOT!\n\nCut to Mario who is… HOLY HELL, HE’S ALREADY IN THE THIRD FLOOR.\n\nMario: Ya-hoo!\n\nMario bursts into Tick-Tock Clock. He then BLJs into a turning platform.\n\nMario: (Japanese) QPUs, GO!\n\nMario BLJs up the entire wall.\n\nA thwomp is sitting idly. It hears something in the distance.\n\nThwomp: Hm?\n\nMario slams straight through the thwomp and collects the star.\n\nMario: (English) Let’s-a go!\n\nCut to Tucker helping Blake up.\n\nTucker: Man, the universe really has it out for ya.\n\nBlake: Mhm.\n\n(A/N: Blake’s one of my favorite characters, but it’s fun to use her for comedy)\n\nBlake’s scroll buzzes in her pocket. She decides to check it.\n\nTucker: What is it?\n\nBlake: Huh. It says I won the “CCR Hurt n’ Heal” …Whatever that is.\n\nTucker: …Neat.\n\nRed: Yo, guys! Check this out!\n\nBlake and Tucker go over to where Red and Phil are.\n\nTucker: Whoa, holy shit!\n\nThe team is standing over a massive amount of ores.\n\nPhil: Yeah, turns out that the massive explosion Blake caused blast mined this entire area.\n\nBlake: Wow, my pain actually contributed to the plot for once. Nice to see that getting hurt isn’t just for comedy.\n\nAs far as she knows.\n\nTucker: SO we’re just gonna be completely loaded for the dragon fight?\n\nRed: Yeah! We’re on easy street now!\n\nTucker’s helmet radio turns on.\n\nTucker: Oh, gotta take this. Go for Tucker.\n\nHenry: (radio) Hey.\n\nTucker: Oh, Henry. What’s up?\n\nHenry: (radio) We kinda… got into the wrong part of Hell, somehow.\n\nTucker: The wrong part of Hell? Whaddaya mean?\n\nCut to the Nether squad.\n\nHenry: Well…\n\nThe 5 were in some sort of suburban area, seemingly watching something.\n\nAyano: I didn’t know hell was like this.\n\nSans: * oka’s not gonna be disappointed.\n\nBaldi: Something here doesn’t add up, though.\n\nGumball: The societal hierarchy?\n\nBaldi: No, I mean that.\n\nBaldi points at a large horned imp arguing with a man sticking on a building’s windows.\n\nBlitzo: FUCK YOU!\n\nSuction Cup Man: FUCK YOU!\n\nBlitzo: Listen ya prick, I got direct orders from SATAN HIMSELF to keep your ass in hell, so do me a favor and SHUT THE FUCK UP AND EAT LEAD.\n\nSuction Cup Man: Why don’t you shut the fuck up and eat DEEZ NUTS?\n\nBlitzo: MAYBE I WILL.\n\nSuction Cup Man: …What?\n\nThe 2 begin trading insults.\n\nHenry: …Yeah, I’m gonna have to call you back.\n\nHenry hangs up his earpiece.\n\nBaldi: …Maybe they know their way around?\n\nAyano: We’re asking the demon?\n\nBaldi: We don’t really have any other option, do we?\n\nGumball: Fine…\n\nGumball yells at the two.\n\nGumball: HEY, DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE THE NETHER IS?\n\nBlitzo & SCM: (simultaneously) Up your ass and to the left!\n\nGumball: (sarcastically) Wow, thanks. You’ve been a great help.\n\nBlitzo: No, I mean go up “Your Ass” street and make a left when you see the sign for the Nether.\n\nAyano: …That’s a real street name?\n\nBlitzo: It’s hell? What did you expect “Lollipops n’ Rainbows” street? It’s right over there.\n\nBlitzo points at a sign that says “Your Ass St”.\n\nSans: * cool, thanks.\n\nSuction Cup Man: I didn’t even know that was a street!\n\nBlitzo: …Y’know, I think we’d be great friends in different circumstances. …Too bad you’re a DICK!\n\nSuction Cup Man: TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE, ASSHAT!\n\nBlitzo begins shooting at Suction Cup Man.\n\nSans: * …yeah, let’s just leave ‘em to it.\n\nCut to the group finally arriving at the Nether.\n\nAyano: Wow… This is much worse than I expected.\n\nThey spot a bastion and a fortress in the distance.\n\nSans: * well, that’s convenient.\n\nAyano: Henry? Gumball? Could you guys go to the bastion?\n\nGumball: Why do I have to deal with Henry’s kleptomania every day?\n\nAyano: Because I don’t want to.\n\nGumball: …I regret teaching you how to crack a joke.\n\nBaldi: Don’t. She’s making good progress.\n\nAyano cracks a slight smirk. An incredibly slight smirk, but a smirk nonetheless.\n\nCut to Ayano, Sans, and Baldi in the Nether Fortress. Ayano looks into the hallway. A bunch of Wither Skeletons are there.\n\nAyano: One hit from those, and you’ll start dying.\n\nSans: * damn, they really wanna one up me, don’t they?\n\nBaldi: Karma’s different, right?\n\nSans: * yeah, it withers the soul.\n\nCut to 2 Wither Skeletons.\n\nSkeleton #1: …Hey.\n\nSkeleton #2: Yeah?\n\nSkeleton #1: You ever wonder why-\n\nA plasma sword interrupts this thought by decapitating the Skeleton.\n\nSkeleton #1: …Ow.\n\nThe second skeleton gets smacked apart by a ruler.\n\nBaldi: You still have the sword?\n\nAyano: Yeah. It’s nice.\n\nSans: * tucker still has his?\n\nAyano: Surprisingly, yes.\n\n*static*\n\nAyano: (Confessional) Interesting how things work out like this.\n\nAyano activates the Great Key.\n\nAyano: (Confessional) It’s very… cool.\n\n*static*\n\nThe trio enters the Blaze spawner room.\n\nSans: * yo, we’re here.\n\nA single Blaze spawns.\n\nSans: * …aren’t the rods those things spinning around it?\n\nAyano: Yup.\n\nSans: …Why can’t we just take them?\n\nAyano: …Good point.\n\nThe three grab the rods directly off the Blaze.\n\nBlaze: :(\n\nCut to the other 2 in the Bastion.\n\nGumball: Okay, Henry. Don’t steal anything.\n\nHenry looks at him questioningly.\n\nGumball: Yeah, yeah. I’ve known you for a year. Just don’t-\n\nGumball notices the empty outline of Henry.\n\nGumball: …Dang it, he left, didn’t he?\n\nCut to Henry deviously rubbing his hands while looking over a chest in the center of the Bastion.\n\nIt was completely surrounded by Piglins.\n\n[Fishing Rod]\n\n[Cake]\n\n[Crossbow]\n\n[Command Block] <\n\nHenry takes out a Command Block. He places it down and begins typing stuff into it. He then places a lever on it and activates it. The entire Bastion gets engulfed in leaves.\n\nFAIL\n\nWhat were you even trying to do?!\n\n[Fishing Rod]\n\n[Cake] <\n\n[Crossbow]\n\n[Command Block]\n\nHenry takes out the cake and deadpans at the screen. He then drops the cake onto some nearby gold. The Piglins go crazy and attack the cake. Henry then drops down and lands on the chest. He then opens it.\n\n…\n\n…He finds a bunch of gold, a flint 'n steel, and some obsidian.\n\nHenry: I o I\n\nHe takes the gold of the chest, storing some for himself. He then tosses some gold at nearby Piglins. The Piglins take the gold and throw Ender Pearls at him, which he gladly takes. Cut back to Gumball.\n\nGumball: Where did he go…\n\nCue an ender pearl being thrown and hitting the ceiling. Henry teleports in.\n\nGumball: Oh, thank god. You got the pearls?\n\nHenry nods.\n\nGumball: Great! We can go now.\n\nCut to the team regrouping.\n\nGumball: We got the ender pearls!\n\nAyano: We have the blaze rods.\n\nBaldi: Great job, everyone! Let’s go back! Henry?\n\nHenry gives a thumbs up. He then quickly constructs and ignites a nether portal.\n\nSans: * alright, I’m tired of this place.\n\nThe five enter the portal. Cut to Oops. They are currently on a snowy cliff.\n\nKaminari: Damn, it’s cold. We’re making good time, though.\n\nENA: (happy) Quite a shame that Mr. Game & Watch fell off the church.\n\n(Flashback)\n\nMr. Game & Watch is holding onto a hand shaped… thing that’s attached to the side of a church. Suddenly, bats come out of the bell and drag him away.\n\nKaminari: OH MY GOD!\n\n(Flashback End)\n\nZim: How did they even get these snowy boulders to float like that?\n\nZim propels himself onto a snowy boulder. Kaminari also does so and looks down.\n\nKaminari: Wow, that’s a long way down…\n\nZim: Don’t get distracted! That’s how dumb Earth humans fall!\n\nKaminari: But I am dumb Earth human. …I am a dumb Earth human.\n\nZim: Well, don’t be!\n\nENA, Cuphead, and TABS Unit also hop along the rocks. They get to a point with a bucket.\n\nKaminari: Dear god…\n\nKaminari and Zim are now distracted, as what little plot this show has demands it.\n\nENA: (meanie) Wow, you really weren’t underselling this! Cuphead’s milk is practically frozen solid!\n\nCuphead: Oh, is it? Lick it! Maybe it’s like a popsicle!\n\nENA: (salesman) I dunno-\n\nCuphead: Come on, try it!\n\nTABS Unit makes several “No, don’t do it!” gestures. Cuphead puts his cup head in ENA’s mouth. This causes her tongue to get stuck to the frozen milk.\n\nCuphead: …Wow, who coulda seen that one comin’?\n\nCuphead tries to get his head unstuck from ENA’s tongue.\n\nCuphead: Yeah- Yeah, that ain’t gonna work-\n\nCuphead goes up to Kaminari.\n\nCuphead: Hey, Kaminari-\n\nKaminari: (while turning around) Yeah?\n\nKaminari accidentally shatters Cuphead’s head with his hammer. This causes ENA to get unstuck, but due to the momentum, she begins sliding.\n\nKaminari: Oh, shit! Sorry!\n\nENA flails her arms to regain balance, but accidentally hooks her hammer onto something. Confused, she reads a nearby sign.\n\nENA: (meanie) “Don’t Ride the Snake”? …Oh no.\n\nENA makes the grave mistake of riding the snake. Hey, that rhymed!\n\nKaminari: No, ENA!\n\nZim: (Irken cuss word), we’ll have to go on, Kaminari!\n\nKaminari: Crap, right!\n\nKaminari hooks onto the bucket at the same time that Zim and TABS Unit hook the bucket.\n\nKaminari: …What do we do now?\n\nThe three begin rapidly swinging their mallets. This only shakes the bucket.\n\nZim: STOP SHAKING THE BUCKET!\n\nKaminari: We’re all shaking the bucket!\n\nZim: Oh, right.\n\nZim attempts to swing himself onto the bucket. This shakes the bucket and moves it a bit to the left.\n\nZim: STAY STILL!\n\nKaminari: Me or the bucket?\n\nZim: The bucket.\n\nZim attempts to get himself onto the bucket, but when that fails, he just decides to swing himself to the ledge. It works. TABS Unit is shocked.\n\nKaminari: Wow, I really didn’t expect you to make that!\n\nZim: I’ve been working out.\n\nHe hasn’t been.\n\nZim pulls the other two up by their mallets. They’re then greeted by a completely smooth surface.\n\nKaminari: …How?\n\nTABS Unit propels himself forward and tries to hook onto the smooth surface. He begins sliding off.\n\nKaminari: CRAP!\n\nTABS Unit suddenly stops on an invisible divot.\n\nZim: Oh, that’s how.\n\nTABS Unit swings itself up, they slide off a bit, then they find another divot.\n\nKaminari: How many divots are there?\n\nTABS Unit repeats its previous actions until they reach the top.\n\nKaminari: …Oh, just three.\n\nKaminari propels himself up. He then attempts to find a divot, but fails.\n\nKaminari: Oh, shi-\n\nKaminari slides off, he then falls to the left, and accidentally hitches a ride on the snake. Fitting that he had the same fate as ENA.\n\nZim: Ugh, okay. Looks like it’s gonna be harder than I thought.\n\nZim thinks for a moment, but then gets an idea. He takes out 2 of his mechanical spider legs (that still have cauldrons on them, btw) and bangs them on the side of the mountain. This causes some of the snow on the seemingly smooth surface to fall off, revealing the divots.\n\nZim: AHA! Can’t fool Zim, puny Earth snow.\n\nZim propels himself onto the divots and successfully climbs with TABS Unit. TABS Unit points up\n\nZim: Oh, right. I can see space from here. We must be close. ONWARDS!\n\nCut back to Team Japan, who were fighting the sentient head of a train.\n\nLeo: Get the tail!\n\nKoopa boosts Axol up, and Axol kicks the pink tail light. This opens the train’s engine. Leo fires a single charge shot at it.\n\nKNOCKOUT!\n\nThe train’s hot engine is split in half. The train begins crying. Cut to Team Japan handing the contracts over to Computer.\n\nComputer: Well done, guys. Hell awaits.\n\nComputer opens the velvet ropes to Hell’s Casino.\n\nLeo: This is it. Final stretch.\n\nRon: Let’s do this!\n\nThe team enters the gateway to hell. They find a casino in there.\n\nKoopa: …Y’know I wonder why there’s so many different versions of hell.\n\nAxol: Judging from that sign over there that says “This way to the nether”, they’re probably all connected.\n\nKoopa: Neat.\n\nThe team enters “All Bets Are Off!”. A massive King Dice pulls himself up from behind a large gambling table.\n\nKing Dice: Well, if it ain’t Team Japan. Fancy seeing you here. Especially since my failure in LDMGS.\n\nLeo: I get it. Let’s play your game.\n\nKing Dice: Actually, I was thinkin’ we switch things up a bit. Instead, why don’t you skip on ahead and fight the ol’ boss man himself?\n\nAxol: …Yeah, I guess that saves time.\n\nKoopa: Step back, guys I’ll take him on myself!\n\nKoopa is suddenly in a light blue version of her usual outfit.\n\nKing Dice: A little turtle girl’s steppin’ up to me? The gamest in the land? Don’t say I didn’t warn ya.\n\nAxol: Wait, how did you change so fast-\n\nKing Dice: Let’s roll!\n\nKing Dice extends one of his hands, which begins dancing and shooting out a line of cards. Koopa sprouts wings and flies above all of them.\n\nKing Dice: …Oh.\n\nCut to Team Japan walking away from a fucked up King Dice.\n\nLeo: Great job, Koopa!\n\nOctodad: (congratulating blubber)\n\nRon: Now it’s time to deal with the devil! Name drop!\n\nAxol: Isn’t he in ICTSA, though?\n\nJack: I mean, DS is good pals with Shade and Lumina, and they’re not really doing anything, so I wouldn’t really be surprised.\n\nKoopa: Fair enough.\n\nCut to the team in front of the devil\n\nDevil: Well, well, well. You’ve defeated my number 1?\n\nRon: Yeah, lmao.\n\nDevil: …That’s it? I was expecting more of a boast- Whatever, let’s just fight!\n\nCut to Bowser.\n\nBowser: Eheheh…\n\nMario lands, completely static.\n\nBowser: …Fuck this shit, I’m out.\n\nBowser hops off the platform. The wing cap then lands on Mario’s head. He bursts through a hole in the universe. Cut back to the white void.\n\nDS: You’re doing a really good job, Everybody-\n\nMario bursts into the void.\n\nDS: Oh, you’re back. Cool.\n\nCut to Determination.\n\nPhil: Wow, can’t believe we got so many diamonds.\n\nRed: We’re filthy fuckin’ rich!\n\nBlake: I really don’t think DS is gonna let us keep this.\n\nRed: Fuckin’ damnit.\n\nBlake’s ears twitch.\n\nBlake: …You guys hear that?\n\nTucker: Yeah. Sounds like squeaking.\n\nBlake and Tucker look down.\n\nBlake: Down there.\n\nBlake begins mining downwards.\n\nRed: Blake, first rule of mining. Never dig straight down-\n\nBlake cartoonishly fires up from the hole she dug with a smoking ass.\n\nBlake: FUCK, FUCK, FUCK-\n\nPhil: Yup. Lava.\n\nRed flies down into the hole.\n\nRed: (in the hole) Whoa, holy shit!\n\nTucker: What is it?\n\nRed: Get your asses down here! I placed blocks in the lava!\n\nBlake, Tucker, and Phil hop into the hole.\n\nTucker: Oh shit, it’s the portal room! Great job, Blake!\n\nPhil: Let’s hear it for the Blakemeister.\n\nBlake: Never call me that again. Wait, how’re we going to contact the rest of our team?\n\nA nether portal spontaneously appears. The rest of the team pops out of it.\n\nGumball: Oh my god, we’re in the portal room!\n\nBlake: Wow, that is exceptional timing.\n\nAyano: I’m surprised as well. Come here, we have the eyes.\n\nTucker: And we got the gear.\n\nCut to Zim and TABS Unit.\n\nZim: What is an Earth shopping cart doing all the way up here?\n\nTABS Unit shrugs. Zim moves past the shopping cart.\n\nZim: Eh? A pantheon? What on Earth?\n\nAgain, TABS Unit shrugs. Zim tries to reach the roof of the pantheon. He’s still so fucking short.\n\nZim: AH! (Irken curse word) This Earth hammer is too short!\n\nSomebody needs to tell him it ain’t the hammer. TABS Unit rolls their eyes and hooks onto the Pantheon roof.\n\nZim: Fine, you do it.\n\nTABS Unit then pulls themself onto a radio tower. It looks happy, but just as it reaches the top, it accidentally snags the tip of the tower.\n\nZim: Oh dear.\n\nTABS Unit begins panicking, trying to prevent the bad ending. They accidentally throw themself off the side of the radio tower. They land on a floating rock, right next to a yellow circle guy with pants. The circle guy grunts.\n\nTABS Unit: …?\n\nCut back to Team Japan in front of the Devil.\n\nDevil: Why, you little-\n\nThe Devil leaps off his throne and begins stretching the skin on his face.\n\nKoopa: Oh shit-\n\nThe Devil’s skeleton jumps out of its skin and hops into a hole. Flames surround the team.\n\nJack: Welp, time to get in the hole!\n\nTucker: (from another universe) Bow-Chicka-Bow-Wow!\n\nAxol: …What the fuck-\n\nThe team hops into the hole, and is greeted by a giant red Devil’s grin.\n\nLeo: Don’t back down!\n\nOctodad: (determined blubber)\n\nKoopa hits a Spread EX right in the Devil’s face. The Devil’s eyes merge into one, and spawn an axe that spirals around.\n\nRon: Man, is this guy gonna stop chucking projectiles at us, or what?\n\nRon hops to another platform to avoid a flaming poker chip. A pink winged bomb comes out of the Devil’s ear. Koopa parries it.\n\nKoopa: Yeah, I’m guessing… No.\n\nThe Devil gets pissed. 2 platforms drop. He brings in 2 big purple henchmen and spawns several small blue ones.\n\nJack: Come on! Lower his HP!\n\nCut to Determination. They are currently fighting the Ender Dragon. Blake throws Gambol Shroud at a high up end crystal, shattering it.\n\nBlake: One down!\n\nSans sends Gaster Blaster beams at three crystals.\n\nSans: * four down, now.\n\nRed fires eye beams at two more.\n\nRed: That’s five and six!\n\nHenry fires a bow at number seven. Tucker shoots at eight, Gumball takes out a paintball gun and fires at nine, and Baldi throws his ruler and shatters number ten. His ruler then boomerangs back into his hand.\n\nGumball: …That was actually really cool-\n\nRed: IT’S PERCHING!\n\nThe Dragon lands on the bedrock sculpture.\n\nTucker: Get his ass!\n\nThe team assaults the Dragon with melee weapons. This immensely lowers its HP. The Dragon blasts Blake high into the air.\n\nBlake: AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH-\n\nTucker: Oh shit, I got her!\n\nTucker runs after Blake. He runs under her shadow and holds his hands up. Unfortunately, like any good Looney Tunes skit, Blake falls to the left of her shadow.\n\nTucker: Fuck, sorry. Man, you just can’t catch a break.\n\nBlake: (strained) And you just can’t catch a Blake…\n\nSans comes in with a Weird Day drum kit and plays a rimshot. The Dragon then breathes on the Team.\n\nAyano: Don’t inhale it!\n\nEveryone backs away except Red. Red begins troping balls.\n\nRed: Wooooooooahhhhhh. (Coherently) My lungs fucking burn.\n\nRed collapses. The Dragon flies away.\n\nAyano: Shit.\n\nCut back to Zim.\n\nZim: Why must Earth builders make these things so tall?!\n\nThat’s right, Zim was still here.\n\nZim: If only… AH!\n\nZim remembers the shopping cart.\n\nZim: Finally, I can put that Earth thing to good use.\n\nZim climbs onto the cart. He then propels himself off the cart.\n\nZim: Come on…\n\nZim hooks onto the pantheon roof.\n\nZim: YES!\n\nZim pulls himself onto the roof.\n\nZim: I, ZIM ALONE, shall climb this Tallest-forsaken mountain!\n\nZim hooks onto the radio tower’s radio. He then flings himself up. Cut to Team Japan. The Devil is crying, but Octodad, Cliffe, and Ron fell off.\n\nRon: Well, I’m dead.\n\nKoopa takes off her shell backpack and puts on a cape. Leo then opens a portal.\n\nLeo: It’s up to you, Axol!\n\nKoopa: BRING IT HOME!\n\nAxol: You got it.\n\nThe turtles (or former turtle, in Koopa’s case) leave the platform.\n\nAxol: Alright, Devil… FACE THE POWER OF JOJO!\n\nAxol activates his super. A massive stand comes out of his notebook and begins a spinning lariat. Cut to Determination.\n\nGumball: How are we gonna get up there?! Red’s the only flyer, and he’s dead!\n\nBaldi: Ayano, remember that thing you practiced?\n\nAyano: Right.\n\nAyano snaps her fingers. The cheat menu opens.\n\nAyano: Time to free the end.\n\nAyano activates Cirno Mode, except instead of having the same hairstyle as Cirno, she has her usual hair, but with a streak of light blue and her ponytail tied up with a bow.\n\nGumball: WHOA!\n\nAyano flies up and shoots ice bullets at the Dragon. This only mildly annoys it. Ayano then remembers something.\n\nAyano: Let’s hope this works.\n\nAyano deactivates Cirno Mode and falls straight towards the Dragon, now brandishing the shovel from before. Cut to Oops, who are looking up at the mountain.\n\nScout: C’mon, Zim! Do ya thing!\n\nENA: (happy) Climb this mountain like you’ve never climbed before!\n\nLaunchpad: YOU GOT THIS!\n\nGray: I KNOW YOU CAN’T HEAR ME, BUT WIN IT ANYWAYS!\n\nCut to Zim floating in space. He bounces off several asteroids.\n\nZim: Blasted asteroids… I’M SO CLOSE!\n\nThe Devil’s HP depletes. Ayano gets closer to the Dragon. Zim goes closer to the peak. They all get closer and closer, until…\n\nKNOCKOUT!\n\n(Dragon Screech)\n\nThank you for playing.\n\nThe Devil clutches his now wounded head, openly concussed.\n\nThe Dragon glows a bright purple as Ayano cuts through its neck, breaking the shovel in the process.\n\nZim ends up in an endless void, with an unseen narrator congratulating him for finishing.\n\nAll the teams end up back in the white void.\n\nDS: Great job, you guys!\n\nKoopa: Oh, Mario! You’re back!\n\nMario: (Japanese) Of course.\n\nEverybody: Let’s see how y’all did…\n\nAxol: Come on…\n\nZim: Give victory to ZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM!\n\nAyano: Don’t let us lose…\n\nTeam Japan: 12:46\n\nDetermination: 15:21\n\nOops: 21:32\n\nEverybody: And with that, Oops loses today’s challenge!\n\nKaminari: Really? By that much? Wow.\n\nZim: Wait, how’d we all get back here at the same time?\n\nDS: Reality warping, duh.\n\nComputer: VIEWERS! Vote here for who you want to save and who you want out. Voting ends when DS feels like it.\n\nCut to the hosts hanging out.\n\nComputer: Whatever happened to the meteor.\n\nDS: I happened.\n\nComputer: …Oh.\n\n…\n\nDS: Y’know, Everybody?\n\nEverybody: Yeah?\n\nDS: I think you’d make a great host! You’re extra reliable, and super nice. Plus, you’re a charming son of a bitch.\n\nComputer: Hear hear.\n\nEverybody: Thanks, I- Wait, are you stepping down?\n\nDS: What? No, no. I was just thinkin’…\n\nEverybody: Yeah?\n\nDS: …How would you like to host TWSGS Mini?\n\nEverybody: Wha- Really? Me? Oh, hell yeah! I’ll do it!\n\nDS: You sure?\n\nEverybody: Absolutely. I’ve already got a cast in mind…\n\nCut to Determination.\n\nTucker: So, yeah. I’m omnipresent, but only when someone says “Bow-Chicka-Bow-Wow”. Cool, right?\n\nThe team just looks confused.\n\nRed: Yo, Blake. Remember to say “Meow-Chicka-Meow-Meow” whenever we need Tucker.\n\nBlake: I DO NOT SAY THAT-"
