        "text": "Holowesko and his pal, Mark Mobius, are the two marquee names in the Templeton complex. From his base in Nassau, Holowesko trains for Olympic sailing events when he's not working. Most of the time, though, he looks out for 33 Templeton analysts and the $70 billion Global Equities Group, which, he jokes, runs more developing-country assets than the $11 billion or so in emerging-market money guided by his better-known colleague. Holowesko personally steers more than $30 billion in mutual funds specializing in overseas stocks, including the $15.5 billion Templeton Foreign Fund and $12.5 billion Templeton Growth .\n\nAnd Holowesko has distinguished himself running both in the style learned from his mentor, Sir John Templeton, looking for strong growth in free cash flow, 50% or so discount to asset value and a catalyst to narrow the discount. For the 12 months ended July 31, Foreign, which invests only overseas, is up 27.1% despite a 30% or so weighting in cash, versus 24.3% for the average international fund; for the three-year period, it has scored a 45.4% gain, versus 36.6% for its peer group. Meanwhile, Growth, which is allowed to own U.S. shares, has chalked up 36.2% for the 12 months ended July, versus 31.5% for the average global fund, and advanced 66.7% for the three-year period, versus 56.8% for its peer group. (Both have loads.) Both funds are widely diversified, holding 250 positions or so, and both have achieved their returns without hedging against the dollar's strength -- a characteristic so attractive to foreigners that some 30% of Growth's shareholders are Germans.\n\nA quick comparison of June 30 statistics with the funds' Feb. 28 year-end holdings gives a thumbnail sketch of some of the changes. Back in February, for example, Growth's two largest holdings were General Motors and IBM . By July, they were replaced by Philips NV , the Dutch electronics manufacturer, and Telebras , the Brazilian telecommunications concern.\n\nThat's not all. Gone from Growth's top 10 are IBM and Merrill Lynch , supplanted by Telmex , the Mexican telecom giant, and Motorola , the chip and cell-phone maker. In Foreign, gone are Volkswagen, Volvo and French oil major Elf Aquitaine . Instead, one sees Japanese titan Hitachi , British Gas and Argentine oil producer YPF .\n\nSome of the country weightings -- many radically different from benchmark indexes -- have shifted, too. At both funds, the U.K. and Mexico are ascendant. Both have huge, if declining, stakes in Scandinavia. And Germany and Japan represent miserly allocations.\n\nBut the biggest news at Growth is a swift reduction in U.S. stocks; at the end of July, they represented 22% of assets, down from 27% in June and 30% in February. To be sure, the fund manager has been neutral to bearish on U.S. shares for some years, devoting a much smaller percentage to U.S. stocks than the typical global fund's 40% allotment because of worries about excessive valuations. Now, he's convinced that U.S. shareholders suffer less from \"irrational exuberance\" than \"irrational expectations,\" and that the system bears \"significant financial risk,\" a condition he suspects won't be corrected by the Fed. Meanwhile, he believes that valuations are now even richer -- some 40% above their 20-year average. \"We're more expensive than the Japanese market right before it crashed,\" he remarks.\n\nWhat could bring it lower? An earnings slowdown, or the capital-gains tax cut.\n\nThe U.S. isn't all that's expensive. \"We've been trimming banks all over,\" he declares. \"The banking environment isn't going to get better and provisions are abnormally low.\"\n\nNor is Latin America cheap. A well-timed bet on shares from that region immediately after the Mexican peso devaluation helped lift Holowesko's funds. But shares like Telebras have risen sharply, leading Holowesko to halve his Telebras stakes in recent weeks -- though he's generally bullish on telecom stocks.\n\nAnd Holowesko thinks that Japan, which has frustrated investors for years, stays pricey. His funds have benefited in recent years from underexposure there.\n\nHolowesko is more bullish on Europe, on the theory that economic conditions in Europe today bear a striking similarity to the U.S. a decade ago, and that corporate Europe is on the verge on dramatically boosting free cash flow. Holowesko has raised his exposure to the U.K. No surprise there: British equities have boomed since the Labor Party victory this year. In Europe, he's a fan of Philips, British Gas and, in Sweden, Sandvik, a specialty-steel company that makes metal strips for disposable razor blades, as well as precision components for circuit boards. Even better, it's financially solid. \"In the last recession in Europe,\" Holowesko recalls, \"they almost broke even, which is something to be said.\" Last week, Sandvik A shares traded at 245 krona ($42), while the ADRs changed hands around 30.\n\nA new favorite is Deutsche Bank, now allotted 1% or so of assets in a typical account managed by Holowesko. Last week, Deutsche Bank traded at 117 German marks ($86). Of the stock price, some 90 marks a share is represented by the bank's securities portfolio. And management has recently suggested it could sell at least part of that portfolio next year if German tax rates on capital gains decline.\n\nBut the biggest bargains reside in Asia, where Holowesko's funds have been underweight for some time, and where stocks have been battered by a long bear market and by a recent flood of currency devaluations led by Thailand. He estimates that Asia now accounts for 15% of assets of Foreign, up from 13% on June 30, and for 10% of Growth, up from 8.8%.\n\nThough he's loath to offer specific picks, because \"I have three dozen buy orders open in Asia right now,\" he allows that he's a fan of Thai and Korean banks. In Thailand, especially, he's bulking up on all six companies he owns. Two that he confesses remain in the portfolio from February are Thai Farmers Bank, which traded at 115 baht ($5.16) last week, and Siam City Cement, a building-materials company, at 125 baht."
