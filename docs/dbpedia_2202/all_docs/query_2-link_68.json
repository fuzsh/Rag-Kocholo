        "text": "Drum Set Lessons / LATIN RHYTHMS:\n\n(Cha-Cha)\n\n(EZ Cha-Cha: Step #1.)\n\nHear it! It's the simplest Latin Rhythm on the Planet!\n\nWe'll call the above beat pattern a 'quasi' Cha-Cha. It is a great little 'wannabe' and will work (in a pinch) as a Cha-Cha if you can't play the more difficult, classic Cha-Cha patterns (below). This one is pretty easy! You will be dropping a lay-over rimshot on every count.\n\nThis one will gradually help you get that lay-over rimshot under control and set you up for the more complex variations to come. If you aren't accustomed to playing the lay-over rimshot, you may need some time to play quite a few Cha-Cha recordings before moving on. These techniques develop and improve as we jam and play the music. All the classic fills will work with this pattern just as if you were playing an 8th rock beat. It IS an 8th-note 4/4 (or 2/4) pattern . . . with a rimshot twist.\n\nNow notice the accent marks on the Cowbell (above.) You'll be accenting on every number count. This gives the pattern a Quarter-note 'feel' even though we are playing 8ths on the Cowbell. These two beats sound alike! I couldn't get the midi maker to play accents on the cowbell! VIDEO: Click here to see, and hear the above pattern. This vid is designed for Internet Explorer (IE) using Windows Media Player (WMP).\n\nVideo: For almost all handheld devices and other browsers.\n\nVIDEO: Click here to see, and hear the above pattern. You know the drill by now. For IE using WMP.\n\nVideo: For almost all handheld devices and other browsers.\n\nThis 'CLASSIC CHA-CHA' (above) looks and sounds simple enough, but is it simple? Yes! Though it takes awhile to get the left hand flowing from a lay-over rimshot on the snare, up to the high-tom for two strokes with the butt of the stick and then back again to the next lay-over rimshots on the snare. Now try to add those accents on the Cowbell as in the above example. Remember 'Santana' 0f 60s & 70s Latino Rock? 'Black Magic Woman' might be a good song to try with all these beat patterns. I had to jerry-rig my midi maker to get this sounding decent. It should sound better than this on a real drum kit. EASY RHUMBA & BOLERO RHYTHMS:\n\nIt is pretty easy to turn the above Classic Cha-Cha into Bolero or Rhumba by simply moving your right hand off the cowbell and to the snare batter. With the tip of your right stick, near the rim . . . trade off random snare and power rimshot effects with your right while maintaining the left hand as it was in the classic Cha-Cha pattern.\n\nIncidentally the snare lever needs to be released on all these patterns, converting your snare into a high-pitched tom (similar to a high-Timbali). Flip the lever on the side of your snare into the 'off' position, to produce these more authentic Latin tones.\n\nVIDEO: Click here to see, and hear the above pattern. For IE using WMP.\n\nVideo: For almost all handheld devices and other browsers.\n\nVIDEO: Click here to see, and hear the above pattern with Internet Explorer.\n\nVideo: For almost all handheld devices and other browsers.\n\nYou can play a lot of years without the variation in the above example, but I like it! It's a more sophisticated form of Cha-Cha. Here, we are catching a quick butt-of-the-stick to the snare (batter) just prior to moving to the high tom. It adds a nice touch of class to the pattern.\n\nVIDEO: Click here to see, and hear the above pattern using IE. It's a lot easier when you see it done.\n\nVideo: For almost all handheld devices and other browsers.\n\nIt is also VERY common to play Quarter Notes on the Cowbell, Now we are playing 'Quarter-note Cha-Cha'. You can add that passing butt-of-the-stick (trick) to this pattern too, if you wish.
