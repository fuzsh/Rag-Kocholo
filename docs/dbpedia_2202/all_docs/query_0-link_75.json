the drummers I’ve ever met (and I’ve met quite a few) started out by tapping or pounding on just about anything they could get their hands on. Chances are that if you picked up this book, you fit into this category as well. So, even if you’ve never played an actual drum or studied drumming in any formal sense, you’re a drummer. With drumming, you’ve chosen the world’s oldest and most popular musical instrument. There isn’t a place on this planet that doesn’t have some sort of drumming tradition. In fact, as you’ll discover in the following pages, playing drums is a universal pastime that anyone can enjoy, regardless of his or her taste in music. My purpose with this book is to introduce you to as many types of drums and drumming styles as I can in 384 pages. If you’re like me, you can find joy in each of them. And by knowing a variety of playing techniques, you can end up being a much better and more versatile drummer.\n\nAbout This Book This book allows the drumset player to develop all the skills needed to play a variety of drumming styles from rock to Latin and jazz to R&B. I also expose you to traditional techniques that you can easily incorporate into your drumset playing. Unlike most drum books, Drums For Dummies, 2nd Edition goes beyond the modern drumset and also includes a variety of traditional drums and percussion instruments. For the traditionalist or drum circle enthusiast, Drums For Dummies, 2nd Edition includes descriptions of how to play a variety of traditional hand and stick-played drums as well as some common percussion instruments. So, whether you’re interested in playing a drumset in popular music or being involved in drumming ensembles using traditional drums and percussion instruments, this book is for you. Drums For Dummies, 2nd Edition is able to contain all this information because you won’t find any exercises that you can’t use in real-world situations. The result: You can learn how to actually play the drums much sooner and without learning unnecessary stuff.\n\n2\n\nDrums For Dummies, 2nd Edition This book is also a handy reference for drumming. You can find a variety of drums from around the world that you may not have ever seen or heard of before now. I explain each of these drums, and I describe their technique so that you can play them in the traditional way using traditional rhythms. I also discuss how you can use each of these drums in a musical situation today. By no means does this book cover all the different drums and percussion instruments played today, but it does cover more than a dozen of the drums that I see most often. And, with the techniques that I describe, you can easily play any drum that I don’t present in this book. Just find a drum that looks similar to yours and start there.\n\nConventions Used in This Book I use a few conventions in this book to make it easier for you to understand and navigate. Here’s a list of those conventions: ⻬ You’ll see many of the rhythms in this book marked with a track bar that tells you where to find that rhythm on the book’s companion CD when you play it as a standard, music CD. The CD and book together allow you to hear as well as see how to play each rhythm, making the learning process that much quicker. As with the 1st edition of this book, many of the tracks have been included as regular CD files. But with the 2nd edition, we’re now able to make all the rhythms available as MP3 files. ⻬ All the drumset grooves are written for the right-handed player. Well, not exactly right-handed people, but rather people who set up and play their drums in a right-handed way. I do this because it’s the most common way to play a drum. Lefties take heart — playing right-handed can actually be better for you. You end up having an advantage because your left hand is as strong as your right (trust me on this one — I’m a lefty who plays right-handed, and so are a lot of other great drummers). ⻬ The musical notation in this book is written so that you can read drumming music. I don’t cover those areas (key signatures, melodies, and so on) that are present in music notation unless they specifically apply to the drum rhythm presented.\n\nWhat You’re Not to Read If you’re pressed for time (for example, you have an audition tomorrow), you don’t have to read this entire book word-for-word. I can’t promise that you’ll nail that audition, but I do make it easy for you to know which parts of this book you can skip. Don’t read the following unless you have ample time and a real thirst for drumming knowledge:\n\nIntroduction ⻬ Sidebars: These gray-shaded boxes are filled with fun, interesting information, but it’s all nonessential. ⻬ Technical stuff: You can skip any paragraph marked with a Technical Stuff icon (see “Icons Used in This Book” later in this introduction). This information may be too technical the first time you read through this book, but come back to it as you get more comfortable with your drumming — it will only enhance your knowledge of the subject. ⻬ Drum history: Don’t worry; I don’t give you any quizzes on the history of drumming. If you’re one of those rare souls who finds history fascinating, dive right in. If you’re like the rest of us, this icon lets you know that you don’t have to read these sections.\n\nFoolish Assumptions I really don’t make any assumptions about you, the reader. I don’t assume that you’re interested in a certain type of drum. I don’t assume that you want to play a specific style of music. I don’t even assume that you already have a drum or that you know what kind of drumming you want to do. In fact, if you don’t know these things, this book can help you decide. The only assumption I make is that you’re reading this book because you want to learn how to turn your aimless tapping into music.\n\nHow This Book Is Organized This book is organized so that you can get the information you want quickly and not be burdened with stuff you don’t need or want to know. Each section contains chapters that cover a specific area of drumming.\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation Part I contains four chapters that cover the basics of drumming. Chapter 1 introduces you to the world of drums and shows you some of the most common drums used today. Chapter 2 provides you with a vocabulary that allows you to read drumming music quickly (you don’t need to read music in order to play the rhythms in this book if you don’t want to — you can pop the CD into your stereo and listen to some of the rhythms, or download the MP3 files and listen to all the rhythms). Chapter 3 introduces you to the proper way to hit the drums with a stick, and Chapter 4 explores many ways that you can play a drum with your hands.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nDrums For Dummies, 2nd Edition\n\nPart II: Digging into the Drumset Part II explores the modern drumset. In Chapter 5, you discover how to set up your drumset as well as some basic drumset skills that will help you move your limbs independently of one another. Chapter 6 shows you how to play the drumset in the rock style, and Chapter 7 introduces you to blues drumming. Chapter 8 presents the way to drum in the R&B and funk drumming techniques, and Chapter 9 explores jazz and fusion styles. In Chapter 10, you uncover the secrets to playing Latin and Caribbean rhythms. And, in Chapter 11, you can expand on your rock skills by looking at the rhythms of some great drummers.\n\nPart III: Dressing up Your Drumset Skills Part III helps you express your own personality on the drumset. Chapter 12 examines what makes a rhythm groove and how to put together a beat that fits your musical situation. In Chapter 13, you can explore how to use licks and fills to complement the music and make a personal statement. Chapter 14 gives you some ideas and guidelines to help you solo effectively.\n\nPart IV: Pounding Out the Beat: Traditional Drums and Percussion Part IV presents a variety of drums and percussion instruments from around the world. In Chapter 15, you get a chance to discover a bunch of drums that you play with your hands. Chapter 16 explores some drums that you play with either a stick or a combination of a stick and your hand. Chapter 17 presents other percussion instruments, such as the cowbell and the triangle. Chapter 18 builds on Chapters 15, 16, and 17 and shows you how you can combine these instruments to create polyrhythms.\n\nPart V: Choosing, Tuning, and Caring for Your Drums Part V provides information to help you choose, tune, and care for your drums. Chapter 19 shows you what to look for when buying a drum or drumset. Chapter 20 explains how to tune and take care of your drums so that they sound their best and last a long time.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPart VI: The Part of Tens Part VI is a staple of For Dummies books. Chapter 21 shows you ten ways that you can continue on in the world of drumming, and Chapter 22 offers some tips on choosing a private drum instructor.\n\nAppendix The appendix explains the organization of the CD that comes with this book.\n\nIcons Used in This Book As with all For Dummies books, I use a few icons to help you along your way. This icon highlights expert advice that can help you become a better drummer. This icon lets you know ahead of time about those instances when the way you hit a drum can cause damage to the instrument or your ears. You also see this icon when I present you with a technique or rhythm that is challenging to play. Certain techniques are very important and stand repeating. This icon gives you those gentle nudges to keep your playing on track.\n\nThroughout the text, I include some technical background on a specific technique. This icon shows up in those instances so that you know to brace yourself for some less inspiring information. This icon directs you to fun facts about drumming that you can use to impress your friends.\n\nWhere to Go from Here Drums For Dummies, 2nd Edition is set up so that you can either read it from cover to cover and progressively build your drumming knowledge, or you\n\n5\n\n6\n\nDrums For Dummies, 2nd Edition can jump around and read only the parts that interest you. I recommend that either way, you check out Chapters 2 and 3 first. These chapters lay the foundation from which all drumming is built. Knowing this stuff allows you to understand the information in all the other chapters faster and easier. After you look over Chapters 2 and 3, you can either go to Part II if you’re interested in the drumset or you can jump to Part IV to learn about traditional drums. If you don’t have a drum but know what you want, you can find out how to buy one in Part V. If you don’t know what kind of drum you want to buy (well, besides a drumset), start with Part IV for some ideas.\n\nPart I\n\nSetting a Solid Foundation\n\nA\n\nIn this part . . .\n\nt last, you’ve discovered that you’re a drummer at heart. Now you want to move beyond those kitchen utensils to an actual drum. Well, this part introduces you to the world of drums and drumming. In Chapter 1, you find out what makes a drum a drum and you get a glimpse of the most common styles available. Chapter 2 gives you a foundation from which to develop your drumming skills by showing you how easy it is to read music. Chapter 3 introduces you to the myriad of ways to hit a drum with a stick and shows you the fundamentals of all drumming: the rudiments (well, a few anyway — the complete list is on the Cheat Sheet). Chapter 4 helps you get a handle on hitting the drums with your hands in case you want to move beyond the drumset to more traditional drums.\n\nChapter 1\n\nDrum Basics In This Chapter 䊳 Understanding what a drum is 䊳 Discovering how a drum makes its sound 䊳 Identifying the parts of a drum 䊳 Recognizing the modern drumset and traditional drums\n\nD\n\nrums are members of the membraphone family of musical instruments and are considered one of the world’s oldest, dating back thousands of years . . . yawn. Bottom line, a drum is a musical instrument that creates a sound when you hit it. What distinguishes a drum from, say, a soup pot, is a membrane (I call it a head from now on) strung across a hollow chamber (called the shell). Don’t get me wrong. I have nothing against soup pots. Or garbage cans or matchboxes or any other improvised drum for that matter. They can be just as fun to play and listen to as a regular drum — just look at the rhythm group Stomp; now they have fun. Face it though, a soup pot may be satisfying to hit for a little while, but sooner or later you’re gonna want a more refined sound. Enter the drum. A well-made and well-tuned drum can produce all the subtle dynamic textures of a finely crafted violin and create a variety of pleasing sounds, whereas a soup pot only clanks when you hit it. In this chapter I introduce you to some drums, both the modern drumset and traditional styles. I also show you the difference between a drum and those kitchen appliances that you’ve probably been banging on for a while now. (It’s okay to admit it. Most drummers spend their careers exploring the rhythmic possibilities of household objects — I’m tapping on my computer mouse right now.) I also explain why a drum sounds better than a cardboard box, and I let you know when you should use your hands, or when arming yourself with sticks works better.\n\n10\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation\n\nPicking a Drum Apart from Head to Shell Like pots, pans, and garbage cans, drums come in all shapes and sizes. Most are round, but some are octagonal. Some are shallow and others are deep. Some are shaped like bowls or cylinders, others like goblets or an hourglass. Some you beat with sticks, while others you strike with hands or fingers. (See Figure 1-1 for a few drum shapes and sizes.) But, regardless of their shape or size, all drums consist of three basic components: ⻬ The head (the membrane strung across the shell) ⻬ The shell (the body of the drum) ⻬ The hardware (the stuff that holds the other two parts together) The look of drum hardware can vary in a lot of ways. The hardware can be as simple as tacks nailed through the head into the shell, or it can be as elaborate as gold-plated cast metal rims with bolts that are tightened to precise torque tolerances (try saying that ten times fast). Either way, they all do the same thing: They create tension on the head so that it can vibrate freely against the edge of the shell. Check out Figure 1-2 for a few hardware styles.\n\nFigure 1-1: Drums come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nExploring How Drums Create Sound When you hit a drum, the head vibrates much the same way as a guitar string vibrates when you pluck it. And like the electric guitar when it’s not plugged into an amp, not a lot of sound comes out of the head itself, which is where the shell comes in handy. The shell acts like the amplifier that your friend uses with his or her guitar — only you don’t need to plug it in. So, you hit the\n\nChapter 1: Drum Basics\n\nThe power of one Here’s a story of a Vietnamese village that was about to be attacked by an enemy: The village had no soldiers available, so one man, a drummer, gathered the entire village’s drums and began pounding them all as loud and fast as he\n\ncould, making a huge ruckus. The attackers retreated and fled figuring that the village’s army had to be very large and powerful to have command of such a group of drummers.\n\ndrum, the head vibrates, and the sound bounces around inside the shell. This motion makes the shell vibrate too. All the sound is then projected out of the opening in the drum and, voilà! The result is the sound of sweet music. Amazingly enough, this action all happens in a fraction of a second. How the drum sounds depends on the circumference of the head, how tightly it’s tuned, and the size, shape, and hardness of the shell. All these factors determine why drums can sound so many different ways and still be just a head, a shell, and some hardware. Without getting too technical, the size and tension of the head dictates the drum’s pitch (how high or low the drum’s tone is) while the size, shape, and hardness of the shell control the volume and timbre of the drum. Timbre is a fancy word for the quality of sound produced by an instrument. This timbre is why not all acoustic guitars or violins cost the same amount. For these instruments, the better the timbre, the higher the price. Luckily, this idea isn’t necessarily true for drums. (To find out more about the relationship between a drum’s timbre and its cost, go to Chapter 19.)\n\nFigure 1-2: A variety of hardware styles.\n\n11\n\n12\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation I can go on and on about how the relationship between the head and the size and shape of the shell creates particular sounds, but doing so won’t help you play the darn thing. So, the important thing to remember here is that the larger the diameter of drum, the deeper the sound, and the longer the shell, the louder the sound. As always, some exceptions exist, but for the most part you can count on this idea being true.\n\nDeconstructing the Drumset Once upon a time, you played drums one at a time. Each drummer played only one drum, and in order to make bigger and better noise — er, music — more drummers were needed. Then somewhere along the way, innovative drummers started putting groups of drums together and beating them all at once. Today’s drumsets consist of the following (see Figure 1-3): A. Bass drum. The bass drum usually sits on its side on the floor and is played by stepping on a pedal with the right foot. This drum is generally between 18 and 24 inches in diameter and between 14 and 18 inches deep. Its sound is the foundation of the rhythm of a band, often pounding out the basic pulse of the music or playing along with the bass player’s rhythm. B. Snare drum. The snare drum is a shallow drum (typically between 5 and 7 inches deep) that’s 14 inches in diameter and has a series of metal wires (called snares, hence the name snare drum) stretched against the bottom head. When you strike the drum, the bottom head vibrates against the snares. What you hear is a hissing sound. The snare drum creates the backbeat (the driving rhythm that you hear in most popular music; you can find out more about backbeats in Chapter 6) of the music and is what makes you want to dance. C. Tom-tom. The tom-toms are pitched drums that are usually between 9 and 18 inches in diameter. A drumset commonly has at least two, if not three, of them (some drummers, such as Neil Peart from the 1970s rock band Rush, have dozens of tom-toms, so go wild if you want to). Generally, the largest tom-tom (called a floor tom) is set up on the floor with legs that are attached to the shell of the drum. The smaller tom-toms (often called ride toms) are attached to a stand, which extends up from the bass drum or from the floor next to the bass drum. These drums are used for fills (a fill is a break in the main drumbeat, as I cover in Chapter 13) or as a substitute for the snare drum in some parts of songs. D. Hi-hat cymbals. The hi-hats are cymbals that are mounted on a stand, one facing up and one facing down, and are 13, 14, or 15 inches in diameter. The stand has a pedal that pushes the cymbals together (closed) or pulls them apart (opened). Your left foot controls the opening and closing of the hi-hats with the pedal while you hit the cymbals with a stick. The hi-hats can make either a “chick” sound when closed or a “swish” sound when open. You use them with the bass drum and snare drum to create the basic drum beat.\n\nChapter 1: Drum Basics\n\nE\n\nF\n\nD C\n\nC B\n\nC\n\nFigure 1-3: The modern drumset.\n\nA\n\nE. Ride cymbal. The ride cymbal is an alternative to the hi-hats. Ride cymbals range in size from about 16 inches all the way up to 24 inches across (20and 22-inch ride cymbals are the most common). The ride cymbal is traditionally used to create a louder, fuller sound than the hi-hats and is often played during the chorus of a song or during a solo. F. Crash cymbals. The typical drumset usually has one or more crash cymbals used for accentuating certain parts of the music, usually the beginning of a phrase or section of a song. These cymbals create a sound that resembles — you guessed it — a crash, not unlike the sound of a frying pan lid hitting a hard floor, only more musical. Crash cymbals generally range in size from 14 inches to around 20 inches in diameter. The following aren’t included in Figure 1-3, but many sets include them. ⻬ Splash cymbals. Crash cymbals aren’t the only accent cymbals that drummers use with today’s drumsets. Other cymbals include the splash cymbal, a small cymbal usually between 8 and 14 inches in diameter, which makes a little splash-type sound. The splash cymbal is kind of a softer, watery-sounding version of the popular crash cymbal. ⻬ Chinese cymbals. These accent cymbals have become common over the last couple of decades or so. Chinese cymbals have a slightly rougher, clangier sound than a crash cymbal (more like a garbage can lid). They range in size from around 12 inches to 20 inches and usually have an upturned outer edge. They’re often mounted on a stand upside down.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation ⻬ Gongs. These cymbals were really popular additions to drumsets during the stadium rock era in the 1970s when drumsets were huge and drum solos were a staple. Gongs actually come in many shapes and sizes, but the most popular are large (up to three feet across) and very loud. You can find many other additions to drumsets, which are limited only by the drummer’s imagination and budget. In fact, many of the traditional drums and rhythm-makers that I describe throughout this book are showing up in many drummer’s kits (kit is another word for a drumset). Although it’s the new kid on the block, the drumset has found a home within all the popular music genres that have emerged over the 20th and 21st centuries. You can put a drumset to work playing rock (see Chapters 6 and 11), the blues (see Chapter 7), R&B (see Chapter 8), jazz (see Chapter 9), and Latin and Caribbean music (see Chapter 10).\n\nAppreciating the Old-timers: Traditional Drums People have been playing drums since they discovered that banging a stick against a log made a pleasing sound (or at least a loud one). Unlike most musical instruments, you can find drums in all parts of the world. Different cultures created different drums based upon the materials they had on hand, their rhythmic sensibilities, and whether they were nomadic or agrarian people (people who moved around a lot developed smaller, lighter drums). As a result, you see an awful lot of different types of drums in the world.\n\nThe dawn of the drumset Early forms of drumsets consisted of two or three hand drums lashed together and played by one person. Today’s drumset, on the other hand, is a highly evolved grouping of specialized instruments, designed to allow one drummer to make as much noise as humanly possible. (I’m just kidding about that last part, but the current design of the modern drumset does have a specific purpose.) The modern drumset was first developed with the emergence of jazz music early in the 20th\n\ncentury. Early jazz drummers put together the drums and cymbals used in military bands and folk music in order to be able to play all of these instruments by themselves. This setup allowed one drummer to use a variety of drums and cymbals that best complemented the music of the other musicians in the band. The drumset is indispensable in popular music today, and is the image formed in many people’s minds when they think of drums.\n\nChapter 1: Drum Basics The most common traditional drums include the conga, which is a barrelshaped drum from Cuba; the West African, goblet-shaped djembe; the Surdo bass drum from Brazil; and the frame drum, which has a very narrow shell and comes from a variety of places all around the world (see Figure 1-4). (In Chapters 15–17, I introduce you to a wide variety of drums and other traditional percussion instruments.)\n\nFigure 1-4: Traditional drums that you’re likely to see today.\n\nJust as you have a wide variety of drum styles in the world, you also have a bunch of ways to play them. Some drums require hands or fingers while others require the use of sticks to produce their characteristic sounds. Still others utilize both hands and sticks.\n\nSwingin’ Sticks and Slapping the Skins The most common and recognizable drumstick is used on the drumset and for playing rudiments (used for classical music and in drum corps; see Chapter 3). This stick is generally about 16 or 17 inches long with a diameter ranging from about 3⁄8 inch to almost one inch. The stick tapers down at about the last 2 or 3 inches (called the shoulder) to a beaded tip, which is what strikes the drum. The tip is made of either wood or nylon. The nylon-tipped stick produces a crisper and brighter sound than the wood-tipped stick. Figure 1-5 shows you a typical drumstick. Some of the more traditional drums have other types of sticks. Some are wrapped in felt or fleece, some are just straight sticks with no tip, some are curved, and others have beaters (the part that actually “beats” the drum head) on both ends. See Figure 1-6 for a variety of stick shapes and sizes.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation\n\nFigure 1-5: The most common drumstick used today.\n\nFigure 1-6: A variety of drumsticks.\n\nRegardless of its shape or size, a stick can create a louder, sharper sound than a hand, but a hand can create more subtle textures than a stick. With your hand, you can slap, pound, brush, fan, or tap (for more about these and other hand strokes, check out Chapter 4). You can use your whole hand or just your fingertips. In many ways, this versatility allows hand drummers to create an almost limitless variety of sounds on a drum.\n\nChapter 2\n\nI’ve Got Rhythm . . . In This Chapter 䊳 Noting drum notation 䊳 Reading music for drums 䊳 Picking up on pulse and meter\n\nA\n\nlong-standing debate exists on whether drummers need to learn how to read music. To be honest, they don’t. You can be a great drummer and never set your eyes on a piece of music. However, being able to decipher what’s on the written page can open a lot of doors for you as a drummer. You can sit down with other musicians whom you’ve never met, play a song you’ve never heard before, and make it sound like it was meant to sound. Or you can walk into a store and get a transcription of that great drum solo that you’ve always wanted to learn but couldn’t figure out by listening to the CD. Or you can trade rhythms with other drummers over the Internet. Or you can . . . well, you get my point. Read this chapter, and I think you’ll find that reading music isn’t that difficult. And I guarantee that any time that you spend learning the basics of music notation is well worth it. As you’ll find out, people use many different ways to describe how to play drumming rhythms. In this book, I use regular musical notation and terms. Doing so has two advantages: First, if you ever decide you want to read music for other instruments, you’ll already know the basics; second, this way is much easier and clearer than some of the other ways out there. You don’t have to figure out how to read music to get through the rest of the book. All the rhythms written in this book are on the CD. All you need to do is listen to the CD track marked next to the rhythm and you can hear how it sounds. Then you can play along. You can even use the CD to speed up your reading abilities. Just look at the rhythm in the chapter as you listen to it on the CD. In no time, you’ll be reading music like a pro.\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation\n\nDeveloping a Sound Vocabulary Think of reading music the same way you think of reading this book. You have letters that form words, which then form sentences, which form paragraphs, and so on. In music, you have notes and rests (later in this chapter, you can see all the notes and rests used in music), which form measures (a measure is a unit of time on musical notation). The measures then form phrases, and these phrases link together to create a song. The first step to reading is forming a vocabulary from which to draw. Figure 2-1 shows your basic music vocabulary, which includes the following terms:\n\nq = 100 G B\n\nD E\n\nMedium Rock\n\nF\n\nF\n\nC\n\nH\n\nq q q q q q q q ÷ 44 \\ .. q \\ ‘ \\ ‘ \\ Qk q E Q ================= \\ g A\n\nQ O\n\nM1\n\nP\n\nR L\n\nJ 2.\n\n1.\n\n> q q q Z\\ q q q q q .. g …q k q q q q qæk q ================= Q E Q \\\\\n\n\\\\\n\n18\n\nM2\n\nN H\n\nFigure 2-1: Your basic drum music vocabulary.\n\nA.

Ending brackets P. Notes Q. Dotted note R. Rest\n\nK\n\nChapter 2: I’ve Got Rhythm . . . ⻬ A. Staff: These five lines (and four spaces) contain all the notes, rests, and other pertinent information that you need to play music. Where a note falls within these lines (or spaces) tells you which drum or pitch to play. Drum music doesn’t always have five lines on the staff. It can have as few as one or two lines, depending on how the music is notated and the type of drum being notated. Single drums and percussion instruments — such as the ones I describe in Chapters 15, 16, and 17 — are notated this way. ⻬ B. Clef: The clef refers to the range of notes that the composer wants you to play. For drummers, the drum clef merely means that the notes don’t reference specific pitches. Instead you can find a legend somewhere on the page (usually at the top but sometimes at the bottom) that describes what drums you need to play and where they’re notated on the staff. ⻬ C. Time signature: This is by far the most important symbol on a piece of music. The time signature tells you how to treat all the notes. Figure 2-1 indicates that the music is written in 4/4 time. Four/four time, by the way, is the most common time signature used and is sometimes indicated by a large “C” instead of a 4 over 4 symbol. (See the “Embracing Odd Meter” section later in the chapter for more on other time signatures.) The top number of the time signature tells you how many beats are in each measure. The bottom number tells you which note receives one beat (count). An easy way to remember how to get the length of the bottom note is to imagine a one above it. For example, putting a one above the four makes it a 1⁄4 (quarter) note. So, for 4/4 time, a quarter note gets one beat and you have four of them in each measure. Simple, huh? ⻬ D. Tempo marking: This symbol tells you how fast to play each note in reference to a metronome (a device many musicians use to help keep time. To find out more about metronomes, go to Chapter 19) or the clock. In Figure 2-1, the number refers to how many beats per minute you play the quarter note. ⻬ E. Style marking: The style marking describes the feel or musical style in which the music should be played. Depending on the composer, a music score may or may not include the style marking. ⻬ F. Bar line: The bar line separates the measures. Each measure is one grouping of notes that the time signature designates. In Figure 2-1, the bar lines come after four beats. Having measures allows the composer to divide the music up into small sections, making it easier to read and reference. ⻬ G. Dynamic marking: The dynamic marking tells you how loud or soft to play. In Figure 2-1, the mf refers to mezzo forte, which means moderately loud. Other dynamic markings designate other volumes. Figure 2-2 shows some common dynamic markings.\n\n19\n\n20\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation\n\nFigure 2-2: Dynamic markings found in music.\n\npp = pianissimo (very quiet) p = piano (quiet) P = metzo piano (moderately quiet)\n\nF = metzo forte (moderately loud) f = forte (loud) ff = fortissimo (very loud)\n\n⻬ H. Repeat: This symbol tells you to repeat the previous measure or section contained within the double bar lines. ⻬ I. Crescendo: The crescendo is a dynamic marking that tells you to increase your volume gradually over the notes above it. Another dynamic marking related to volume is called the decrescendo. You play the decrescendo exactly the opposite way. Instead of gradually increasing your volume, you decrease it. ⻬ J. Accent: The accent is another dynamic marking that refers only to the note below it. You play the accent louder than the surrounding notes. ⻬ K. End bar: The end bar tells you that the song is over. ⻬ L. Roll: This symbol refers to the drumroll. As in, “Drumroll, please.” Rolls last as long as the note(s) to which they’re attached. ⻬ M. Tie: This symbol connects two notes together. For drummers, ties can be used several ways. They are as follows: • M1: This is the way ties work with most instruments. Here you sustain the note and hit only the drum on the first note of a tied series. If you’re playing with brushes, the tie symbol means you slide the brush along the drumhead in a circular motion (this is one way drummers create sustained notes). • M2: When ties are connected to rolls, you play your roll (see previous bullet) through the tie and stop at the last note in the series (this technique is another way drummers sustain a note). • M3: When the first note in a tied series is smaller (a grace note; see the following bullet), you play both notes at nearly the same time. ⻬ N. Grace note: You occasionally see a little note with the tie attached to a larger note, particularly when you have to play a flam. (A flam is a drumming rudiment.) I explain more about rudiments in Chapter 3. ⻬ O. Ending brackets: The ending brackets tell you how to end a certain section of music. Notice that Figure 2-1 has two ending brackets. Ending 1 has a repeat that goes back to the beginning. The second time through\n\nChapter 2: I’ve Got Rhythm . . . the first three bars, you go to the measure in the second ending bracket instead of the first. ⻬ P. Notes: These symbols describe what to play. Each note represents a different length of time. Figure 2-3 shows how many of these notes equals one measure in 4/4 time. Notice that one 4/4 measure consists of one whole note, two half notes, four quarter notes, eight eighth notes, or sixteen sixteenth notes. Do you notice something? When you have four quarter notes, each one of them fills up one quarter of a measure. The name of the note tells you how many of each note fits into one measure in 4/4 time. The exception to this rule is an unusual note called the triplet. As you can see in Figure 2-3, the eighth notes are marked with a little “3” above them. These notes are triplets. Triplets are an artificial group of eighth notes — instead of two equaling one beat, three make up a beat. That’s what the number three above them means. The triplet is a pretty common note grouping. Other triplets include groups of quarter notes and groups of sixteenth notes. Three quarter-note triplets equal two beats. Three sixteenth-note triplets equal half a beat. 1.

Dotted note: The dotted note has a value that is one-half longer than its non-dotted counterpart. The dotted eighth note equals three-quarters of a beat rather than half a beat. ⻬ R. Rests: These symbols tell you when not to play (you rest your instrument). Figure 2-4 shows the different types of rests.\n\nFigure 2-4: Rests found in music.\n\n1. Whole note rest\n\n2.

Even today, if you study from some African or Indian teachers, you learn strictly through singing. In West African music, for example, an open tone (this tone is one of the many drum strokes that you can make; I describe drum strokes in Chapter 4) on the right hand is called “Go.” The left hand is “Do.” The vocalizations of\n\nthe strokes in these cultures closely mimic the sound that the drum makes when it’s played with that stroke. This method allows drummers to practice without actually having to play. In fact, I studied with a teacher for almost a year who never let me play the drum during the lessons. Instead, we sang the rhythms. This technique allowed me to really learn the rhythms well.\n\nChapter 2: I’ve Got Rhythm . . .\n\nAdding Some Drumming Definitions Even though drum notation follows regular music notation, I use some other symbols in this book to help you play rhythms. Figure 2-5 shows you many of them, and the following is an explanation of the terms:\n\nD2\n\nA 1\n\n&\n\n2\n\n&\n\n3\n\n&\n\n4\n\nD3\n\n& D1\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n44 q q qq q q q qq q q t\\ q\\ Z\\ q q q q ÷ Qk \\Q ========== E Q z Q g g E ======== g F G \\\n\n\\\\\n\nA B\n\n1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4 e & a B M M O O M S M B M O M O M S M\n\n÷ 44 q q q q q q q q q q q q q\\ q q q R L R L R L R L R L R L R L R L\n\n/\n\nK L\n\nC Figure 2-5: Music notation just for drums.\n\nA.

The count: This isn’t some aristocrat living in a castle somewhere, but rather a way to say or count the rhythm. For a drummer, the count is one of the most useful things to know, not just for reading music, but also for playing any rhythm. My teachers used to say, “If you can’t count it, you can’t play it.” Counting is really easy. In Figure 2-5 you essentially say out loud the counting pattern notated above the rhythm. For example, just say, “1 and 2 and . . . ” for the top rhythm and “1 ee and ah . . . ” for the bottom rhythm in the figure as you play the rhythm that’s marked below. The purpose of the count is to help you place each note in the rhythm in its correct place within the measure. ⻬ B. Stroke: This symbol shows the hand position or stroke to play. You use the stroke mainly for hand drums.\n\n23\n\n24\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation The strokes that you find in this book are as follows (I explain each of these strokes in detail in Chapter 4): • O: Open tone • B: Bass tone • M: Muted tone • S: Slap tone • H: Heel movement • T: Tip movement • P: Palm stroke • Br: Brushing stroke • Dr: Drone tone • Sn: Snap • Tr: Trill ⻬ C. Sticking and hand pattern: This information tells you which hand to use. “R” refers to the right hand and “L” refers to the left hand. ⻬ D. Cymbal: Cymbals and hi-hats are generally placed on the top line of the staff. The particular cymbal that you should play is designated with the following (these notations vary depending on the composer, but in this book they look like this): • D1: Hi-hat • D2: Ride cymbal • D3: Crash cymbal ⻬ E. Snare drum: The snare drum part is often in the third space from the bottom of the five-line staff. ⻬ F. Bass drum: The bass drum usually occupies the bottom space of the staff. ⻬ G. Hi-hat with foot: When the hi-hat is played with the foot, it’s marked with an “x” under the staff. ⻬ H. Small tom-tom: This space is usually used for the smaller of the two ride toms on a drumset. ⻬ I. Medium-sized tom-tom: This line refers to the larger of the two ride toms on a drumset. ⻬ J. Floor tom-tom: This space signifies the drumset’s floor tom-tom.\n\nChapter 2: I’ve Got Rhythm . . . ⻬ K. Higher-pitched drum: When you’re asked to play hand or stick-played drums, such as the congas or timbales (go to Chapter 15 for more about congas and Chapter 16 for more about the timbales), they’re often notated on a staff with only one or two lines. In this case, the higher pitched drum lies above the line. ⻬ L. Lower-pitched drum: The lower pitched drum goes below the line on single-line drum notation.\n\nBecoming One with the Pulse (and I’m Not Talking Heartbeat) All music, whether Mozart or Metallica, has a basic beat that carries it. This beat is called the pulse. In most popular music, the pulse follows the quarter notes in the 4/4 measure. You can tap to it and dance to it. The pulse basically drives the music. In other types of music, however, the pulse can be more obscure (such is the case in African music; see Chapter 15). As a drummer, one of the most important things you need to do — aside from actually playing the drum — is tap into the pulse of the music, whether it’s prominent or not. Developing a strong inner pulse isn’t that difficult. Here are a few steps that you can take to start growing this pulse within you: ⻬ Practice to a metronome. A metronome is a device that creates a steady beat to which you can play. (Go to Chapter 19 for tips on buying a metronome.) ⻬ Tap your foot to the beat while you play. ⻬ Count out loud. Use the count that I describe in the previous section and show in Figure 2-5. ⻬ Listen to the type of music that you intend to play. After you develop a strong inner pulse, playing any drum in any situation becomes a lot easier. In fact, if you can comfortably and confidently follow the pulse of the music and support it in your drumming, you’ll find that other musicians love playing with you.\n\n25\n\n26\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation\n\nFeeling the Meter Meter is another word for time signature (as in “This song has a 4/4 meter”) or it can refer to the overall feel of the music. For example, you may hear the terms duple and triple meter. These terms refer to the feel of the rhythm and how the pulse of the music is divided. All music has either a duple or triple feel (and sometimes both — see the next section on odd meter). In other words, you can divide the meter into groups of two or three beats. Most 4/4 music has a duple feel (counted like 1–and–2–and–3–and–4–and), but in the case of triplets, you get a triple feel (counted 1–tuh–tuh–2–tuh–tuh–3–tuh–tuh–4–tuh–tuh). Figure 2-6 illustrates duple and triple meter. Douple meter 1\n\n&\n\n2\n\n&\n\n3\n\n&\n\n4\n\n&\n\n÷ 44 q q q q q q q q\n\n/\n\nTriple meter Figure 2-6: Duple and triple meter (feel).\n\n1\n\ntuh tuh 2\n\ntuh tuh 3\n\n3\n\ntuh tuh 4\n\n3\n\ntuh tuh\n\n3\n\n3\n\n÷ 44 q q q q q q q q q q q q\n\n/\n\nYou may also run across music that you must play with a shuffle feel. This term means that you play the eighth notes as a broken triplet — that is, play the first and last notes of the triplet and rest on the second note of the triplet. Check out Figure 2-7 to see how to play the shuffle feel.\n\n÷ 44 q q q q q q q q Figure 2-7: How to interpret eighth notes in a shuffle.\n\n/\n\nShould be played like\n\n÷ 44 q\n\n3\n\nq q\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\nq q\n\nq q\n\nq\n\n/\n\nChapter 2: I’ve Got Rhythm . . .\n\nEmbracing Odd Meter When someone says that a song is in odd meter, he or she means that the song isn’t in 4/4 time. It may be in 3/4 or 6/8 time (these time signatures are the most common odd meters, making them not so odd, actually). Or it can be in 7/8, 11/8, or even something like 21/16 time. Hopefully the person describing the time signature will also tell you the song’s meter in addition to just saying, “this is in odd meter”; otherwise, you won’t know what to play. If you plan to play in odd meters, get comfortable with the combinations. Although most people agree that playing in odd meter is more difficult than playing in 4/4 time, you can get used to it. Check the denominator (the bottom number of the time signature — the number that tells you which note receives one beat). If it’s 4, the time signature isn’t much different than playing in 4/4 time — you still have eighth notes and sixteenth notes. The pulse has the same quality as 4/4, but instead of counting to 4 before returning to one, you count to whatever the top number is. Denominators of 8 or 16 throw most people off. The pulse becomes irregular because the speed of the rhythm makes it difficult to tap on all the beats of the measure. Break up the measure into a pulse that you can tap. You can divide all these odd meters into groups of two and three, and most composers follow these groupings throughout the song. Look at Figure 2-8 to see the grouping combinations that you find in some of the more common odd meters. As you play these rhythms, accent the first note of the grouping. That gives you the pulse of the rhythm. Being able to feel groupings of two and three notes allows you to really play with the rhythms in a song, and that’s when drumming gets fun.\n\n> > ÷ 58 q q q q q / > > > ÷ 78 q q q q q q q / Figure 2-8: Rhythm groupings in odd meters.\n\n> > ÷ 58 q q q q q / > > > ÷ 78 q q q q q q q\n\n> > > > ÷ 98 q q q q q q q q q\n\n/\n\n/\n\n27\n\n28\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation\n\nChapter 3\n\nTapping into Drumming Techniques In This Chapter 䊳 Preventing injuries while playing 䊳 Understanding basic stick playing techniques 䊳 Discovering the rudiments 䊳 Maximizing your practice sessions\n\nY\n\nou’ll find two aspects to playing the drums, or any other instrument for that matter. The first is knowing how to produce a quality sound on the instrument, and the second is having the muscular dexterity and coordination to make music. This chapter explores both of these areas. This chapter also helps you prevent injuries by explaining the proper techniques for stretching and warming up before you play. I also tell you how to practice effectively and gain the most improvement for your efforts.\n\nTalkin’ Technique: What You Need to Know With the huge number of different drums available in the world, you may expect a variety of ways to play them. That’s true, but with some basic skills, you can pick up nearly any drum and create a decent sound on it. So, without further delay, here are the basics about drumming technique. The first thing to keep in mind is to relax. Your shoulders and arms should have no tension except during the instant that your hand, foot, or stick contacts the drum’s surface. This looseness allows you to play longer and faster and\n\n30\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation helps keep you from injuring yourself. Contrary to what you may have heard or seen (you know, the familiar images of the drummer who sits behind his drumset sweating and grimacing), playing the drums should be a relaxed and fluid process. Remember that drummers’ grimaces are often an act — good drummers know how to stay loose behind their drums; otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to play night after night.\n\nPerfecting your posture You’ve probably heard this directive a thousand times, but at the risk of sounding like your mother, I’m going to say it again — sit (or stand) up straight. You’ll thank me later. And your back will thank you by being painfree. Besides, with good posture you can play louder, faster, and longer. Isn’t that what all drummers want? You bet. When you’re playing, occasionally check in and be aware of how you’re holding your shoulders. Are they scrunched up around your ears or are they hanging loose? Chances are your shoulders will creep up as you play, especially when you concentrate or push the limits of your speed or endurance. So, occasionally check in and consciously relax your shoulders. Over time you’ll notice that you’re less tense overall, even though you’ll probably still need to remind yourself to relax your shoulders once in a while. Before you start playing your drum, sit or stand with your hands or stick resting on the drum and close your eyes. Take a deep breath and as you let it out, feel how you’re sitting or standing. Adjust your posture, and then take in another deep breath. This time, as you let your breath out, drop your shoulders and relax your arms. Repeat this exercise two or three times, and then start playing. You can even do this workout once in a while during your practice session. This exercise helps you stay loose and become more aware of how you sit or stand behind your drums.\n\nPreventing injuries Drumming is a very physical activity, not unlike most sports. And like athletes playing sports, you need to prepare yourself for the demands that drumming can put on your body. This is true for practicing as well as playing a gig. In fact, stretching and warming up may be even more important for practicing. After all, you spend a heckuva lot more time practicing than you do performing.\n\nChapter 3: Tapping into Drumming Techniques Injury among musicians is a real problem. Some doctors specialize in the types of injuries common to musicians, and some researchers study nothing but how to prevent and repair these injuries. The most common injuries to befall drummers are repetitive stress injuries (RSI). As the name suggests, these injuries result from performing the same movement over and over again. Unfortunately, this repetition is what drumming is all about, whether you’re perfecting a new rhythm or jamming on a groove with the guys (or gals). The key to avoiding RSIs is to avoid playing when you’re hurt (being sore is okay though) and to stretch, just like athletes do. A few rounds of yoga every day can do wonders. In fact, you may even want to take up yoga if you get really serious about drumming. (And, if you do, check out Yoga For Dummies, written by Georg Feuerstein, Larry Payne, and Lilias Folan, and published by Wiley.) If you’re not interested in becoming a yogi, the following sections have a few simple stretches to help save you from a lot of pain. When you’re stretching, remember not to get overzealous. You don’t want to hurt yourself; the goal is to prevent injuries, not create them. Ease into the stretch, and if it hurts, back off a little. If you practice or play for a long time, taking a break every once in a while to do these stretches is a good idea.\n\nHand stretch Any drummer will tell you that hand cramps are a necessary evil in drumming. This reality is especially prevalent when playing with sticks. But by periodically stretching your thumbs and fingers, you can make yourself a lot more comfortable. Try, for example, the following: ⻬ Working your thumbs: To stretch your thumbs, hold your hand with your thumb pointing up like you’re hitchhiking. Relax your fingers, and then gently apply pressure to your thumb with your other hand (push it backwards) until you feel a slight burn in the muscle at the base of your thumb. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds and then switch hands. Repeat several times. Figure 3-1 shows you this thumb stretch. ⻬ Flexing your fingers: To stretch your fingers, put your hands together at chest level (index finger presses against index finder, middle finger against middle finger, and so on). Next, put your elbows out, straighten your wrists and bend your fingers at their base. (Take a look at Figure 3-2 to see this position.) Push down on your wrists to stretch. You should feel the stretch in your palm. Hold for 30 seconds, and then rest for 30 seconds. Repeat this stretch a few times.\n\n31\n\n32\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation\n\nFigure 3-1: Stretching the thumbs.\n\nFigure 3-2: Finger stretch.\n\nForearm stretch As you play you notice that your forearms and wrists take a lot of abuse. If you’re going to get injured, your forearms and wrists are likely to be the first casualty. The most important thing you can do to prevent injuries in your wrists is to avoid overflexing them as you play. This stretch starts the same way as the finger stretch (see the previous section), except that this time, when you put your elbows out, your palms stay together. Figure 3-3 shows this position. Again, hold the stretch for 30 seconds, relax, and repeat.\n\nChapter 3: Tapping into Drumming Techniques Shoulder stretch Because most drummers tend to hunch up their shoulders as they play, this stretch is a really great way to loosen up those shoulders. It can help you become more aware of your shoulders and prevent you from getting a sharp pain in your upper back that makes you want to stop playing. To do the shoulder stretch, raise one arm straight up over your head and bend it at the elbow. Next, grab that elbow with the other hand and gently push down on the arm. Make sure that you align the hand of the arm that you’re stretching with your spine. Figure 3-4 shows you the shoulder stretch position. Like the other stretches, do both arms and repeat (remember to hold the stretch for 30 seconds).\n\nFigure 3-3: Forearm stretch.\n\nFigure 3-4: Stretching your shoulders.\n\n33\n\n34\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation Back stretch If your back often hurts when you play, you probably have poor posture. However, if you do the stretches that I mention in this section consistently, your posture will improve (if for no other reason than you’re more aware of how you hold yourself up). To stretch your back, bend over and touch your toes. To start, raise your arms up over your head and reach as high as you can. Then slowly bend over from the waist and reach for the floor. (It’s okay if your legs bend a little — not too much though). Check out Figure 3-5 to see the back stretch.\n\nFigure 3-5: Back stretch.\n\nHitting the drum: It’s (not) all in the wrist Remember when you’re playing a drum to think in terms of drawing the sound out of rather than driving it into the drum. Again, this idea relates to relaxation. If your hands and arms are relaxed, your hand or stick will rebound off the head and allow the sound to resonate. If you’re tense and your hand or stick presses into the head after you strike it, the sound dampens (sometimes you want this sound, but you need to be able to control it). You’ve heard the saying, “It’s all in the wrist”, right? Well, this saying doesn’t hold true for drumming. Instead, you want to control the movement of your wrist and let your whole arm move naturally when you play. Limit your wrist movement to about 2 to 3 inches. When you want to play louder, you can then lift your hand from the elbow. Doing so gives you more power, control, and endurance.\n\nChapter 3: Tapping into Drumming Techniques\n\nSpeaking Softly and Carrying Big Sticks When playing drums with sticks, you have fewer basic strokes from which to draw when compared to hand drumming. But this deficit doesn’t mean that you’re limited in what you can do. Drumsets overcome this deficit by providing more drums to get a larger variety of sounds. (Check out Chapter 4 for more on all the stroke options that hand drums provide.) But before you can hit the drum with a stick, you need to know how to hold the sticks.\n\nHolding the sticks Two basic ways to hold the drumsticks exist: matched grip and traditional grip. The right-hand position is the same for both these grips, but the left hand’s position varies greatly. Many people want to know which grip is better, the traditional grip or the matched grip. The answer really depends on who you ask. Personally (and I’m not alone here), I suggest the matched grip for most beginners. This grip takes less time to get comfortable with and allows you to play any kind of drum or music that you want. The matched grip also takes fewer muscles to perform a stroke. And you’re better able to get a consistent sound between the two sticks using this grip. On the other hand, if you already know how to play with the traditional grip, you really have no reason to stop using it. The fact is that both grips allow you to play the drums equally well (I sometimes switch between grips when I play).\n\nTraditional grip The traditional grip comes from military drumming. In military bands, a strap held the snare drum over the shoulder, and it rested on the left leg. The drum was tilted with the left side higher than the right. Because the left side was raised up and closer to the left arm, the drummer needed to use a different technique with the left hand. You hold your right hand the same way you do with the matched grip technique, which I describe in the next section. To hold the sticks in the traditional grip with your left hand, take a look at Figure 3-6. You can see that the left hand basically grips the stick between the thumb and index finger (cozy it up to the inside corner) about a quarter of the way up from the butt end of the stick. This is the fulcrum of the grip, and the stick pivots from here. The stick cradles between the middle and ring fingers. The middle and index fingers wrap gently over the stick. These fingers control the lateral movement of the stick. To make the stroke, twist your wrist and rotate your arm from the elbow.\n\n35\n\n36\n\nPart I: Setting a Solid Foundation The important thing to remember about the traditional grip is that the stick rests loosely in your hand. You apply only enough pressure on the stick at its fulcrum (the thumb–index finger point) to keep it from flying out as you "
