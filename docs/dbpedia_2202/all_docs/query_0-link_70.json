        "text": "This paper will examine a variety of ways that drum makers approach their craft by comparing the processes of distinct forms of drum construction as well as the philosophies and aspirations of these artists. This dissertation will review the various choices of drum makers by: (1) providing a brief history of the drum set, (2) comparing the processes of manufacturers, both prominent and independent, and (3) narrating a firsthand project of making a drum with an independent drum builder while incorporating a handmade drum into original compositions and recordings. The paper will also explain the creative decisions of drum makers and how they have reflected the needs of artists throughout history. The motivation that underlies the various techniques will be discussed: that all drum builders are driven by a desire to provide instruments that are musical, extraordinary, unique, and, above all, true works of art. Uncommon approaches to making drums will also be presented to illustrate the...\n\nIn this paper, I examine the implications of post-racial ideology as a form of anti-racism in the 21st century. I argue that post-racial positions can detrimentally affect collective understandings of difference, diminish awareness of the persistence of racism and of the difficult history of race relations in North America, and pose a number of theoretical issues for the study of popular music and culture. Drawing upon critical race theory, ethnomusicology, popular music studies, and the work of Slavoj Zizek— particularly his theory of enjoyment as a political factor—this study will outline how the capitalistic ideal of instant gratification is invested in post-racial outlooks. As a case study, I will refer to my research on black Pentecostal ‘gospel drumming’ and on the mainstream drumming industry in order to frame this discussion.\n\nThis article contextualises music technology within the Hip Hop tradition of beat making. While literature exploring music technology in music therapy has proliferated in recent years, much of this has focused on the “assistive” function of technology, where it is used to facilitate music making for clients who have limited access to playing acoustic – or non-tech-based – instruments. This paper argues for an alternate lens that positions music technology within the tradition of beat making and that this is a musicing practice of value in its own right. To do so, a brief historical account of the beat making tradition is provided, which locates its origins within Hip Hop culture and acknowledges the evolution of the myriad beat-based genres that have and continue to emerge around music technology. A basic typology of beat making equipment is then provided to foster greater understanding of these technologies as instruments in their own right and their role in shaping contemporary music. To account for the rapid innovation in this area, the typology focuses on pieces with historical significance and the primary functions that remain the building blocks of composition and performance in beat making to this day. Brief accounts of how these instruments can and are integrated into therapeutic practice are also provided. It is acknowledged that this paper itself represents only one, brief account of beat making traditions and instruments. Yet, it is hoped it will promote understanding of their significance and serve as a useful reference in helping practitioners consider how these instruments may enrich practice. It is argued that such consideration is not only useful, but critical for reasons of cultural sustainability, and ensuring the relevance of music therapy practice in the 21st Century.\n\n'Towards a musicology of analysis in drumming with reference to popular music genre of Heavy Metal.' This paper was submitted as part of my MA Music at Middlesex University and offers a brief introduction to my work regarding drum set performance and the search for meaning in its obsession for virtuosity. Drum set performance in the twenty first century is continuing to develop in technique to levels of ability that were never previously conceived. However, if the status of this instrument is to be brought to the forefront of musicological thought then a solid argument in its defence is overdue. Therefore, the central focus in this paper is to establish what defines virtuosity on the drum set and to explore how this can be, and has been, analysed from a musicological standpoint."
