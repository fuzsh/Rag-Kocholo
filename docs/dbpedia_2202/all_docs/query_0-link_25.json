        "text": "Nowadays, digitized drum kit and percussive samples, loops and beats are ubiquitous and pivotal elements in every sound recording studio, and the overwhelming pace in the dissemination of new sound resources is an evident and growing reality. Withal, the lack of any consistent convention or homogeneous offer (naming conventions, metadata, etc.) shifts a potentially positive profusion into an organizational nightmare, given the necessity of a tedious and cumbersome manual classification for achieving some benefit of such a huge asset. Consequently, the need of automatic tools for efficient management of this sonic content plethora becomes indisputable. This thesis focuses on the study of the automatic characterization of percussive samples, specifically through the use of semantic descriptors. We start by implementing an automatic taxonomic classification system, in order to find and validate suitable set(s) of features. Commonly, acoustic and psycho-acoustic descriptors are extracte...\n\nThis article presents a study on music genre classification based on music separation into harmonic and drum components. For this purpose, audio signal separation is executed to extend the overall vector of parameters by new descriptors extracted from harmonic and/or drum music content. The study is performed using the ISMIS database of music files represented by vectors of parameters containing music features. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and co-training method adapted for the standard SVM are involved in genre classification. Also, some additional experiments are performed using reduced feature vectors, which improved the overall result. Finally, results and conclusions drawn from the study are presented, and suggestions for further work are outlined."
