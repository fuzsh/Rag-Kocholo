        "text": "You're not fully gripping.\n\nYou're kind of just, sort of, pinching them\n\nand letting them bounce.\n\n[drum rolls]\n\nHey, I'm Kevin from Tame Impala,\n\nand I'm gonna be talking about\n\nsome of my favorite drum sounds and drum parts\n\nthat I've loved and cherished\n\nover the years, and probably been influenced by.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI think people think I'm kind of joking\n\nwhen I say I spend 90% of my time on drums\n\nwhen I'm working on a song, but it's dead true.\n\nIt's like me chasing the dragon, you know?\n\n[laughs]\n\nI love drum sounds that are just fuzzed out\n\nand destroyed-sounding.\n\nBut I also love--\n\nI also love the opposite of that.\n\nI had to narrow the category\n\nor it was gonna be way too difficult to pick my favorite.\n\nI just had to say like,\n\nOkay, it's drums that are played by people.\n\nyou know, that recorded real drums.\n\n[Program plays]\n\nAnd then that one's incredible\n\nbecause that was recorded in like '67 or something.\n\nIt's like a break beat.\n\nIt's like a break beat before they were break beats.\n\nIt's so robotic and repetitive\n\nthat I feel like if that song came out today,\n\nit would be filed under electronic, you know?\n\nEven though it's just someone playing the drums.\n\nThe hi-hat, which goes up and down,\n\nyou control it with your left foot.\n\nWhen you play a sort of a jazz beat,\n\nyou keep that going to keep time.\n\nBut if you're really clever,\n\nyou can do it on the offbeat,\n\nwhich means you do it--\n\nYou do it in between those onbeats.\n\nSo instead of going\n\n[ts, ts, ts, ts]\n\nyou go,\n\n[claps, ts, clap, ts, clap, ts]\n\n[Program plays]\n\nPlaying on the ride symbol--\n\nThe ride symbol is the big brass one.\n\nPlaying that with a sort of a trip hop,\n\nkick and snare and counting on our hi-hat,\n\nthat's how you get that sound.\n\nI feel like everyone has that\n\nlike riff that they just play\n\nwhen you pick up a guitar.\n\nIt's like muscle memory.\n\nLike that beat is the one I do\n\nwhen I jump on drums now, because it sounds the coolest.\n\n[Good Times Bad Times plays]\n\nObviously no discussion, about drum sounds\n\nand drum playing, would be complete\n\nwithout talking about John Bonham\n\nand the led Zeppelin drum sound.\n\nLike the famous Led Zepplin drum brake\n\nis Levee, When the Levee Breaks.\n\nSo I was going to do When the Levee Breaks,\n\nbut I kinda just felt like everyone else--\n\nIt's been covered you know?\n\nI feel like most people got the wrong idea.\n\nLike there's this idea that Led Zeppelin drums are like\n\nsuper, like, powerful, solid.\n\nPeople say you hit like a brick layer,\n\nbut I don't think that's actually true.\n\nI think there's a lot more of a delicate way that he played.\n\nThe way he sort of goes from smacking the drum\n\nand playing a teensy little ghost note.\n\nIt's just a really quiet hit.\n\nAnd it's usually a really quiet hit\n\nin between a normal hit.\n\nIt just adds dynamic to your playing.\n\n[Good Times Bad Times plays]\n\nAlso with the double kick, I noticed there.\n\nSo double kick is ba-boom,\n\n[imitates drums].\n\nYou've got one foot on the kick pedal,\n\nbut you do it twice, super quick,\n\nwhich is a technique that takes a long time to get.\n\nBut I think he kind of like exploited\n\nhis ability to do that.\n\nAnd then from then on, everyone\n\nwas trying to do double kick.\n\nThat was like, became a part of skilled rock drumming.\n\n[Good Times Bad Times plays]\n\nSo I think the reason why people think\n\nthat Bonham hit the drums so hard,\n\nand why people, when they try to replicate Bonham,\n\nthey just smack the drums\n\nis because the compression makes\n\nit sound louder than it is.\n\nYou can drum quite quietly and using compression,\n\nyou can make it sound a lot more energetic,\n\nbut for me, like, emotion in rock drumming\n\nis just John Bonham.\n\nYou know, that's it.\n\n[Living For the City plays]\n\nSo I'm pretty sure Stevie Wonder\n\nis playing drums in that song.\n\nI read somewhere that he did the drums first,\n\nand he had the whole--\n\nHe knew the whole song in his head,\n\nhe just played the drums with no backing, no nothing.\n\nHe just played along to the song in his head,\n\nand then just played the song\n\nback over the top of that with all of the other instruments.\n\nWhich is mind-boggling.\n\nAnd in that way, it's almost--\n\nIt's like the most expressive,\n\nsome of the most expressive, drumming.\n\nHe's kind of just feeling it out, in real time.\n\nWhich, again, is kind of what reminds me of me.\n\nI obviously I've got the drum beat\n\nin my head before I start, but it's fun.\n\nIt's like--\n\nDrumming's the most fun\n\nwhen you don't know what you're doing.\n\nHe's playing it quite heavy on the hi-hat, which is cool.\n\nLike some drum sounds just make me dream.\n\nYou know, I'm just like.\n\n[sighs]\n\nAnd the hi-hat on that song,\n\nparticularly, I just go.\n\n[sighs]\n\nI could just listen to that on its own, over and over.\n\n[Living For the City plays]\n\nSome drums make you wanna dance\n\nand some drums make you wanna strut.\n\nAnd that's a strut.\n\n[L'hotel Particulier plays]\n\nI just love that, counting on a hi-hat in that song.\n\nAnd it's just so, so brooding and so ominous even.\n\nAnd it's just the simplest thing.\n\nIt's just counting the hi-hat on quarter notes.\n\nI don't think it was an accident that,\n\nthat ended up being so loud in the mix.\n\nI feel like if he was just counting,\n\nthey would have turned it down in the master,\n\nthe bounce down, but it's nice and loud.\n\nAnd with all the strings swelling in the background.\n\n[L'hotel Particulier plays]\n\nThere is something categorically different\n\nand qualitatively different\n\nabout someone hitting something,\n\nmultiple hits of the same thing,\n\nversus someone hitting it once\n\nand then digitally reproducing it.\n\nI believe that the brain can pick up\n\nwhen something is being digitally reproduced.\n\nIf it was someone that just sampled a hi-hat\n\nand they just played it, ts, ts, ts.\n\nI think that would give a different feeling\n\nto the sound of someone that's going ts, ts, ts.\n\nDo you know what I mean?\n\n[Mysterons plays]\n\nPortishead drum sounds are like a Holy--\n\nJust one of the Holy Grail drum feels\n\nand like approaches to drums,\n\nand have been for years.\n\nIt's a break beat.\n\nIt's a break beat category,\n\nBut obviously so much more moody.\n\nI love, I just love Jeff Barrow's approach to drums.\n\nIt's pretty standard pattern.\n\n[imitates drum sounds]\n\nHe does a--\n\nActually, I don't actually know\n\nwhat that's called at the end.\n\nLike a buzz roll.\n\n[Mysterons plays]\n\nYou can hear that in Tame Impala drums.\n\nSo Endors Toi has it,\n\n[imitates drums]\n\nWhen I'm doing that.\n\n[Endors Toi plays]\n\nAnd it's like a marching technique.\n\nYou sort of push it into the drum\n\nso that it sort of bounces along.\n\nSo you're bouncing the sticks on the skin,\n\nand it just creates this kind of flutter of sound.\n\nWhich is just so, kind of like, cool sounding.\n\nAh, do you want to get us the snare drum on the Ludwig?\n\nOh, thanks bro.\n\nYou're not fully gripping.\n\nYou kind of just sort of pinching them\n\nand letting them bounce.\n\n[drum rolls]\n\nI actually have really bad technique.\n\nLike I've never---\n\nI never got taught to do that.\n\nI kind of just did it from ear.\n\n[Mysterons plays]\n\nSo those drums, they sound super impactful and punchy,\n\nbut they're hitting it extremely quietly.\n\nBut because of the compression, it sounds,\n\nlike they're hitting a lot harder than they are.\n\nIt's too loud for the medium and kind of,\n\nit gets a bit crushed.\n\nThat's where you can get some real energy in the sound,\n\nbecause it just sounds distorted and blown out.\n\n[Race for the Prize plays]\n\nThat's Steve Drozd playing drums there.\n\nI love his style too.\n\nIt's just so bombastic, but emotive.\n\nIt shows you that drumming that is loud and strong,\n\ndoesn't have to sound angsty.\n\nIt can sound ecstatic and uplifting.\n\nThat's the thing, that pattern\n\nis really common and really standard.\n\nBut for some reason, it's just,\n\njust played with such feeling.\n\n[imitates drums]\n\n[Race for the Prize plays]\n\nSo those drums are super saturated.\n\nSaturation is kind of like,\n\nthe classy word for distortion.\n\n'Cause distortion can sound angry and\n\nlike, you know, metal obviously has a lot of distortion.\n\nDistortion is when the signal is too loud\n\nfor what it's trying to get through.\n\nIf this is a wave form,\n\nit'll cut it off there.\n\nSo it'll go, ah, you know, and it can't--\n\nSo that creates this distortion sound.\n\nBut in that context, to me,\n\nit just sounds so psychedelic\n\nand so ecstatic and uplifting.\n\nIt changed everything for me, with drum sounds.\n\nSuddenly I just wanted all my drums\n\njust to be completely blown out.\n\n[Race for the Prize plays]\n\nYou can see where I--\n\nWhere at which point I went to Japan\n\nand saw The Flaming Lips live,\n\nand then went back and recorded Lonerism.\n\nThe drums sounded like that.\n\nYou can hear.\n\nSo I mean like a big part of me\n\ngoing to Dave Fridmann was like, I want that drum sound.\n\nHe's the one that mixed Innerspeaker and Lonerism.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention his name in all this,\n\n'cause it's his production that led to that drum sound.\n\n[Chemtrails plays]\n\nSick, sick drumming.\n\nThe drummer's name is Joey Waronker,\n\nwho actually came to the studio once.\n\nHe played in my friend's band, he played on a song.\n\nWe've always been a big fan of his drumming,\n\nI guess probably since that song, you know.\n\nI think it's more coming from jazz drumming,\n\n'cause that's where like psych-rock, like,\n\nlike rock drumming.\n\nThat's what its roots are in.\n\nAll those early psych-rock drummers were jazz drummers,\n\nor their favorite drummers were jazz,\n\nlike Alvin Jones and stuff, Elvin Jones.\n\nFor me, it's kind of like a benchmark\n\nin like modern drum sound.\n\nLike the drum sounds are so kind of,\n\npsychedelic and unhinged.\n\nThere's more drum fill than regular beat.\n\nIt's basically just one big drum fill,\n\nwhich is obviously just--\n\nIt's probably what Beck wanted him to do,\n\nwas just like, let him loose, you know?\n\n[Chemtrails plays]\n\nYeah, 'cause it's just such a free sound.\n\nIt's just someone just rumbling around the kit.\n\nNot feeling like they're that they have a job to like,\n\nhold down the band, you know?\n\nCause, like, traditionally that's the drummer's role.\n\nIt's like you're holding down the rhythm section,\n\nholding it down.\n\nBut like that's a song that's a good example of\n\nthat's not the drummer's role.\n\nThe drummer can be going wild over the top.\n\n[Go With The Flow plays]\n\nLove that song.\n\nI feel like that album,\n\nit was one of the last great rock albums.\n\ntha whole album's drumming, it's Dave Grohl,\n\nwho is obviously of Nirvana drumming fame.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age,\n\nA lot of that Queens of the Stone Age songs\n\nis just that like motoric,\n\n[imitates drums]\n\nlike robotic rock and roll.\n\nAnd then like Dave Grohl is,\n\nlike the modern rock drummer, right?\n\nHe's so disciplined, so metronomic,\n\nso hard, you can tell, he's whacking them.\n\nLike John Bonham, he uses drum fills as a motif, sometimes.\n\nSo like in that bit, like,\n\nbah doom doom do bah,\n\n[imitates drums]\n\n[Go With The Flow plays]\n\nAny regular drummer would've just played through that.\n\n[imitates drums]\n\nBut he made a part out of it,\n\nand that created kind of like\n\nthe heart of the song, in a way.\n\nLike, that kind of section of music,\n\nit made it into a thing.\n\nI think Dave Grohl recorded the drums\n\nto a metronome on top of all the music, I think.\n\nMaybe that's a secret.\n\nBut anyway, seeing it being recorded\n\non like pro tools or whatever to the grid,\n\nwhich is like the metronome, it was like, he said,\n\nit was just mesmerizing, how spot on he was.\n\nLike hit after hit.\n\nIt's human to the drift in and out with it.\n\n'Cause it's really difficult to always be on time.\n\nBut apparently, like, he's unbelievably good.\n\n[Off Screen Voice] Dave playing on the beat,\n\nis that an example of a drummer being in the pocket?\n\nThe pocket, yeah.\n\nThe pocket is a funny concept\n\nand I still don't know where I stand on it,\n\nbut a drummer playing in the pocket\n\nis kind of like laid-back,\n\nnot too excited, not ahead of the beat,\n\nbut kind of just behind it,\n\nbut not so behind it that they're out of time.\n\nPlaying in the pocket is more of a feeling, I believe.\n\nI don't think Queens of the Stone Age drumming\n\nis about, necessarily, being in the pocket.\n\nI think it's just about having that\n\njust unrelenting, robotic feel.\n\nI feel like one of the important--\n\nOne of the things that has to happen\n\nfor you to want to dance or like, strut\n\nor air drum, is that you have to feel\n\nlike you can rely on the drums.\n\nAnd when you feel that you can't rely on the drums,\n\nyou're like,\n\nOh, I'll probably just like sit down here.\n\nBut in that song you like,\n\nOh yeah, yeah, when I do that,\n\nit's going to be that.\n\nEven he does a drum feel, they sound reliable.\n\n[New Person, Same Old Mistakes plays]\n\nWhen I was asked to pick\n\na couple of my own songs for drum sounds,\n\nafter having listened to all my favorite drum sounds,\n\nlistening to mine, I was like,\n\nThat's trash, that's trash, trash.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nEven though I care so much about my drums,\n\nand I am proud of them.\n\nI'm proud of my drum sounds.\n\nBut it was tough.\n\nI'm playing a pretty sort of standard hip hop beat,\n\nmoving from normal snare, hit, to a rimshot.\n\nIn fact, you can hear--\n\nThe start of that song, you can hear me,\n\nI haven't quite decided\n\non how I'm going to hit the snare.\n\nRimshot is when you hit like, just the rim of the snare,\n\nyou get that kind of.\n\n[clicks]\n\n[New Person, Same Old Mistakes plays]\n\nThe drum sound in this song, it's kind of a coming together\n\nof a lot of different styles and drum sounds that I love.\n\nWhich is sometimes the hard bit\n\nabout me writing a drum part\n\nand recording and producing drum sounds.\n\nBecause I love so many different things\n\nthat are the opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nI love drums that are super minimal,\n\nlike R&amp;B kind of just like\n\n[imitates beat]\n\nand there's nothing else in the mix,\n\nother than just maybe like a really quiet,\n\nsmall sounding hi-hat.\n\nBut I also love Race for the Prize.\n\nDistorted, blown out, thrashy drums,\n\nyou know, like I'm never truly happy\n\nwith a drum sound.\n\nWhenever I finish a song or an album,\n\nI'm like, well, I did as well as I could,\n\nin the time that I had.\n\nI send it off to the master and it's like,\n\nIt wasn't the best drum sound, but I'll get it next time.\n\nYou know?\n\nLike, [indistinguishable]--\n\nLike, a month later,\n\na couple of months later I was walking past a bar.\n\nYou kinda hear the drums before you the music.\n\nAnd I was like,\n\nOh, that's a nice drum sound.\n\nAnd it was that song.\n\nI was like, Oh shit, it's me.\n\nOh shit, it's new person.\n\nI was like, that was a great snare sound.\n\nI remember thinking like,\n\nGreat snare sound, I actually,\n\nprobably should be shazamming this.\n\nWhich I guess shows me that like,\n\nyou're your own worst, harshest critic.\n\nSo it took me listening to it,\n\nthinking it was someone else's drum sound,\n\nfor me to actually appreciate it.\n\nWhich you know, this is the way it goes, I guess.\n\nYeah, it was good enough for Rihanna apparently."
