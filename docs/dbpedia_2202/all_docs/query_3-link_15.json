        "text": "jef: Probably too specialized for me, especially in regard to jazz terminology, but here are a couple of definitions straight from Russ Girsberger, \"A Practical Guide to Percussion Terminology\":\n\nRim Shot: Drum stroke that strikes the rim and the drum head simultaneously. (Compare with \"Stick Shot.\") Stick Shot: Accented drum stroke made by placing the tip of one stick in the center of the drum head and striking its shaft with the other stick. The latter is clearly what you intend by \"stick on stick\" and call \"traditional.\" The former could be either your #1 or #2, and you're right, \"rim\" and \"hoop\" are exactly the same according to Russ. But there's a third technique that I associate more with jazz, and I don't have an official term for it but I've always called it a \"rim pop\": hold a single stick against the center of the head and strike the shaft against the rim, leaving the other stick available for cymbals, etc. I have to admit that I can't see the difference between your 1 and 2, and I'm not sure what you mean by either that changes between rock and jazz drumming. Both require VERY good technique and aim, and are what *I* think of as the \"traditional\" rim shot, from the Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa generation. And just to confuse things further, here are the comments (intended for those WRITING for percussion) by Samuel Z Solomon in \"How to Write for Percussion: A Comprehensive Guide to Percussion Composition\": \"A rimshot is executed by holding one stick down with the tip touching the center of the head and the shaft touching the rim and then striking it with the other stick. This takes half of a second to get into positon, and only rhythms slow enough to be executed with one hand are possible.\" [Your #3] \"A rimshot can also be created by striking the drum with one stick at an angle to hit both the head and the rim simultaneously. This produces a slightly different sound, requires no preparation time, and makes two-handed passages possible. This rimshot, however, is more difficult to execute consistently.\" [Your #1 and #2, my Buddy Rich.] \"The specification of which type of rimshot used is rarely notated and is usually decided by the performer based on the passage.\" [I would agree.] \"A common abbreviation for rimshot is \"R.S.,\" but as with all abbreviations, the first appearance in a part should be written out in full. ... Rimshots are most naturally and almost always executed at a loud dynamic.\" \"A rim-click (also called side-stick or cross-stick) is a technique often found in drumset playing whereby one end of the stick is held against the center of the head and the shaft strikes the rim. This takes about half of a second to get into position.\" [And this is my \"rim-pop.\"] I studied rudimental drumming many years ago, but have never played set (except for one rather unsuccessful New Year's Eve when everybody else in town was already booked!), but I would normally leave this kind of choice up to my drummer. And of course the MOST important thing is to know what your drummer wants to see, and what he does NOT want to see.
