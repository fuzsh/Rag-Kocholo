        "text": "Wazzup DAWfreaks.\n\nFor you who did not know it the annual TOONTRACK metal month is upon us..\n\nNow the EZdrummer expansion or EZX we are looking at today is not a METAL EZX but hey\n\nAbout Toontrack\n\nToontrack Music was originally started as a production company for composing game and movie soundtracks. In 1999 producers Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah and Mattias Eklund of Toontrack Music decided to design a sample library for their own use.\n\nThey called Tomas Haake drummer of Heavy Metal band Meshuggah to record the drum samples. The library was called Drumkit From Hell.\n\nToontrack really made a revolution back then and what they did With the original DFH changed the way drum samples sounded forever.\n\nINDIE FOLK EZX\n\nThe Indie Folk EZX was recorded at the Avast! Recording Co. in Seattle, home to bands such as Fleet Foxes, The Shins and Band Of Horses. It comes with three complete vintage kits: a 1960s Gretsch Round Badge sampled with both sticks and mallets, a Ludwig from the 1950s as well as a Slingerland Rolling Bomber kit dating back to the 1940s. Also included are two tambourines, a hi-hat mounted tambourine jingle, an extra kick and snare as well as a 28″ floor tom. Source\n\nThe INDIE FOLK EZX comes with 3 complete KIT´s, here follows the product specifications.\n\nKIT 1 – 1961 Gretsch Round Badge\n\nKick: 14 x 22″. Head: Powerstroke 3, Ambassador Bass\n\nSnare: 5 x 14″. Head: Vintage A Coated, Ambassador Clear\n\nRacktom: 9 x 12″. Head: Ambassador Coated, Ambassador Clear\n\nFloortom: 16 x 16″. Head: Ambassador Coated, Ambassador Clear\n\nRecorded with both sticks and mallets\n\nKIT 2 – 1940s Slingerland Rolling Bomber with calfskin heads\n\nKick: 14 x 28″\n\nSnare: 6.5 x 14″\n\nRack: 9 x 13″\n\nFloor: 12 x 14″\n\nKIT 3 – 1950s Ludwig\n\nKick: 14 x 20″. Head: Powerstroke 3 Bass, Aquarian\n\nSnare: 5.5 x 14″. Head: Coated Ambassador, Ambassador snare\n\nRacktom: 9 x 13″. Head: Coated Ambassador x 2\n\nFloortom: 16 x 16″. Head: Coated Ambassador x 2\n\nCymbals left:\n\n1960s Zildjian A 19″\n\nZildjian K Constantinople 18″ (sticks and mallets)\n\nCymbals right:\n\n1960s Zildjian A 16″\n\n1960s Zildjian A 14″ (sticks and mallets)\n\nRide cymbals:\n\n1960s Zildjian A 22″\n\nZildjian K Light 24″ (sticks and mallets)\n\nHi-hats:\n\nZildjian New Beat 15″ with mounted tambourine jingle\n\nZildjian K Light 16″ (sticks and mallets)\n\nExtras:\n\nKick: 22″ Gretsch Round Badge 1958 without front head. Head: Coated Powerstroke 3\n\nSnare: 7 x 14″ Slingerland Artist. Head: Coated Powerstroke 3, Evans 300 Hazy\n\nTom: Ludwig 28″ Floor Tom. Head: Ludwig original\n\nTambourine Toca\n\nTambourine KS Source\n\nThe GUI\n\nThe GUI of EZdrummer is nothing new, we get a classic white KIT placed in a cool old rehersal studio Toontrack always find a image to fit the sound!!\n\nThe Indie folk EZX comes in two different configurations, a full MIC setup ( See images above) and a 4 MIC setup (Images below).\n\nAs with all Superior drummer 2 and EZ drummer expansions we get a nice little set of MIDI to go with the INDIE FOLK EZX\n\nWorking with INDIE FOLK EZX\n\nThe KIT´s in The INDIE FOLK EZX keeps the EZ Drummer legacy and a loaded KIT only uses roughly 250MB ram and the CPU meter in PreSonus Studio One only shows a 02% usage that’s just insane when hearing the results of EZdrummer.\n\nThe sound of the INDIE FOLK EZX is spot on, it has a classic roundness with a warm roomy feeling that makes this EZX not only suitable for Indie rock but classic rock and ballads as well.\n\nRouting each Channel to its own output is Just a click away and here is something I LOVE with EZdrummer! Depending on the amount of channels EZdrummer will tell the DAW how many outputs is available so you don’t have 30 outputs but only 5 is actually used by EZdrummer, thisa small built in flexibility / Organizer that just makes things EZ.\n\nHere is a small tune I put together in PreSonus Studio one and then rendered with each of the included Gretsch, Slingerland and Ludwig KIT´s.\n\nConclusion.\n\nI enjoy trying out new Expansion for EZdrummer as I know I am in for a treat, For some reason I never stop being amazed by how realistic and full the sound is at so low resources.\n\nThe whole idea with EZdrummer is that is should be EZ and the tweaking we can do is Volume and panning in the built in mixer and in addition to that we can tell EZ Drummer wither we want the snare bottom MIC to allow bleed from other drums and if we want the Overhead MIC´S on or off… and THAT’S it..\n\nTOONTRACK has once again delivered a great expansion for the impressive EZ Drummer and if you are in to rock / Indie rock… there is no doubt you will love having the INDIE FOLK EZX arround.\n\nI would like to thank Toontrack for letting me do this review!\n\nAnd to my readers…. THANK YOU!!!!\n\nWazzup Dawfreaks..\n\nIts time for something i like allot, A Drum sound/expansion review!\n\nSteven Slate Drums 4 aka SSD4 is a flexible drum instrument plugin with excellent sound, fast workflow and easy to use GUI. Today we will have a look at the new Chris Lord Alge expansion for Steven Slate drums 4, This expansion is also available for Trigger.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSteven Slate know that to come with something new to the Recording world is tough, And when he wanted to make an Expansion for SSD4 and Trigger it had to be exceptional.\n\nTo manage this he brought along a man who know and understand every detail drum recording, and can set that exceptional drum sound, MR Chris Lord Alge!\n\nIn the Spring of 2012, Chris Lord Alge revisited his recording engineer roots and recorded multiple world class drumkits at OCEAN studios in Burbank. He then mixed all the drums in his classic style in his LA mixroom using the same processing chains that you’ve heard on all of his records. He even printed a sample layer of his famous SONY reverb unit on the kicks and snares. The result is some of the fattest, punchiest, most mix ready virtual drums in the industry! And now you can use these classic Chris Lord Alge drums in Steven Slate Drums 4 Virtual Drum instrument and Steven Slate TRIGGER Drum Replacer/Enchancer. Source\n\nWhat’s included\n\n12 Drumkit Presets (SSD4)\n\nDW MAPLE\n\nKick Drums: 22” and 24”\n\nToms: 10”, 12”, 14”, 16”, and 18”\n\nSnares:\n\nDW Maple\n\nLudwig Black Beauty\n\nLudwig Chrome Plated Steel\n\nPearl Reference Maple\n\nPearl Reference Brass\n\nPearl Steel Sensitone\n\nTama Bell Brass\n\nA closer look Here is the CLA Rock 01 loaded up in SSD4 kit view, as a VSTI in PreSonus Studio One PRO v2.\n\nThe Chris Lord Alge expansion comes with 13 ready to use presets, But when we start digging deeper we find that there is more to this expansion that allows for great tweaking options and a huge variety of sound.\n\nHere is the CLA Rock 09 loaded up in SSD4 Cell view, as a VSTI in PreSonus Studio One PRO v2.\n\nWhen we go into the Instrument section of SSD4 we find that the kicks comes with additional features, HB=Hard Beater, SB=Soft Beater, wS= With Snare and OT = Over the Top. OT (Over the Top) have a crushed ambient sound (especially on the Overheads), this is meant to be used as blends for more more excitement and low end punch.\n\nTaking a look at the Snares section we find that there is a nice variety of Snares in the Chris Lord Alge expansion I know people have been asking for “The Dong”, One of the snares that I like to have in nearly any setup is the Dry Pearl as it only has a slight OH bleed so I can use it to get more od that nice snap to the Snare sound.\n\nAs we head into the SSD4 mixer we find Close mice channels for Kick in / Out and Sub, Snare Top, TopB (second mic taped to 1st ), Snare Bottom, Toms, and Hi-Hat. These are followed by a FX, OH, RoomA , RoomB and and Mono Channel. I love the Room A/B feature as it allows me to tweak specific room sound for specific drums this is simply said even more flexibility.\n\nWorking with the Chris Lord Alge expansion\n\nThe Chris Lord Alge expansion follows the original SSD4 standard and I just love how fast I can load a kit, change some instruments to my liking and adjust the bleed levels.\n\nThen I decide to either keep all channels on one buss / channel in my DAW or set multi out option for further tweaks, Adjust some EQ and one of my favorites is to use the FabFilter\n\nPro-C a great compressor that is great for anything such as parallel compression.\n\nI can not mention this enough but the room A and B feature is nearly addictive, I can alter sound in so many ways and I can get the room spread for a perfect mix.\n\nAnd Remember all SSD4 instruments including the Chris Lord Alge expansion responds well to additional Tweaking for even more personalization.\n\nHere follows a video of some of the Kits and MIDI grooves included in the Chris Lord Alge expansion. In the end of the video is a tweaked kit where i also tweaked the drum sound with additional effects.\n\nSteven Slate Drums 4 – Chris Lord Alge expansion – DEMO\n\nConclusion\n\nIn these modern times with a lot of great sounding Drum plugins on the market it is hard to create something new, but If you read my SSD4 Platinum review you will know that i highly recommend it as its very fresh, flexible, easy to use and just sounds AMAZING!\n\nWhen I got the Chris Lord Alge expansion and loaded it in SSD4 I was shocked over the detail and extremely nice punch it had, how many options I got with just a small twist of a bleed knob or adjustment of a channel level. The more I messed around with the expansion the more I found how exceptional it is, the special tweaked individual kicks and snares adds that extra feel to the sound, Using the DRY variations allows for some very interesting personal tweaks and the RoomA and RoomB channels opens up a huge variety of options.\n\nSince SSD4 has a fast and easy workflow, and it allows you to easily combine the SSD4 instruments with the Chris Lord Alge expansion you will be able to quickly get YOUR sound! In the end it is how you combine and tweak the sound that gives the personal touch, and the options are nearly limitless!!\n\nSo If you want one of the best sounding expansions available on the market today, And you own either Trigger or Steven Slate Drums 4 then the Chris Lord Alge expansion is a must have! If you don’t have Steven Slate drums 4 I recommend you to get it… it is that good!\n\nThe price for the Chris Lord Alge expansion is at the moment set to $199, A good price for what you get.\n\nIf I miss something it would be a optional tweaked version of the Toms , a easy way to get a 5 Tom setup and maybe one or two presets that use 5 Toms and Double kick for the metal maniacs.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nThe Chris Lord Alge Expansion is just amazing, Good job everyone involved in Steven Slate drums 4 and the Chris Lord Alge Expansion.\n\nI want to thank Steven slate drums for letting me do this review, And to my readers…\n\nTHANK YOU!!!\n\nWazzup DAWfreaks.. My new PC is basically 100% up and running and i will soon post my specs for you to use as a guide if you need to build a new DAW PC soon.\n\nToday we will have a look at The Metal foundry SDX from Toontrack, And before i start i would like to thank Toontrack for letting me do this review.\n\nAbout Toontrack, The Drumkit From Hell and Metal Foundry story\n\nToontrack Music was originally started as a production company for composing game and movie soundtracks. In 1999 producers Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah and Mattias Eklund of Toontrack Music decided to design a sample library for their own use. They called Tomas Haake drummer of Heavy Metal band Meshuggah to record the drum samples. The library was called Drumkit From Hell.\n\nLittle did they know that Drumkit From Hell was not only the first true multi sampled drum recording for use with a virtual instrument but that it would also be the start for Toontrack Music to become the worlds premier developer of software, audio and midi for virtual drum and percussion production, spawning groundbreaking products like dfh Superior, EZdrummer and Superior Drummer 2.0.\n\nIn the time since Toontrack recorded and released Drumkit From Hell our knowledge of sampling drums and designing software has improved vastly and we’ve built a great following in all genres and with all kinds of users, but our core has always rested firmly on the foundation of those early recordings.\n\nIn order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Drumkit From Hell we release The Metal Foundry SDX. The name has layers of meaning to us encompassing both the beginning, what has come from it and what lies in the future. The Foundry is a place where precious metals are forged and what was started back in 1999 with the Drumkit From Hell recording sessions turned out to be truly precious. Source\n\nThe Metal Foundry SDX\n\nThe Toontrack Metal Foundry SDX was recorded at the Atlantis Studios, with Drumtech Urban Näsvall and the drummers Tomas Haake (Meshugga) and Huxflux Nettermalm (Fistfunk, Infinite Mass och Starlet med Camela Leierth).\n\nSpecifications.\n\nNow The Metal Foundry comes with a really REALLY huge library (featuring seven massive drum kits), So i recommend you to head over to The metal Foundry Product page for the complete list of included drum pieces http://www.toontrack.com/products.asp?item=51.\n\nThe Metal Foundry in use\n\nA full Loaded kit form The Metal Foundry gives the user Huge Variety.\n\nWhen the Metal Foundry loads up with the default kit we find that it covers a huge variety of Cymbals, crashes spocks and splashes, 5 toms, Hi-hat, Cowbell and two Kick drums.\n\nand the included variety for each the drum kit piece has its own flavor in sound working perfectly with classic rock to modern Metal. there are two things that to me really stood out in this SDX and that is the Kicks and Toms, Them alone makes The Metal Foundry a extremely interesting expansion.\n\nAs i start tweaking the Sound i found another great thing, Superior drummer 2.0 is known for the huge amount of headroom when it comes to tweaking and processing the sound and i could be wrong but to me it felt like The Metal Foundry had even more headroom.\n\nToms is something i always had a bit of a struggle with, They either sound to week or to strong but with The toms in The Metal foundry i can easily manage to get the sound i want and get them placed in the mix where i want them.\n\nLately iv had issues with video recording for my reviews but that has been sorted now and i have a little DEMO video for you again.\n\nIt features some of the included Kits in The Metal Foundry and at the end i decided to show you how The Metal foundry sounds using only Toontrack EZmix 2 to process the drums.\n\nConclusion\n\nToontrack has a Killer SDX expansion in The Metal Foundry, It comes with a huge variety of kit pieces and a great sound that will work with Pop, Rock and Metal.\n\nTo have the Haake designed Kit hit by its own maker is like having Thomas Haake as drummer and that is just SICK!! If you don’t know what SDX to get, IF you are into rock or Metal then This is the SDX to get. Toontrack knows how to make Killer drum samples and The Metal Foundry proves this. Mixing with the Metal Foundry also is a great experience since the included samples responds extremely well to processing.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nI would again like to thank Toontrack for letting me do this review.\n\nAnd to my readers…. THANK YOU!\n\nWazzup Dawfreaks.\n\nI am back again, and to continue following Toontrack´s Metal Month we will look at the Metal Machine EZX.\n\nAbout Toontrack\n\nToontrack Music was originally started as a production company for composing game and movie soundtracks.\n\nIn 1999 producers Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah and Mattias Eklund of Toontrack Music decided to design a sample library for their own use.\n\nThey called Tomas Haake drummer of Heavy Metal band Meshuggah to record the drum samples. The library was called Drumkit From Hell.\n\nToontrack really made a revolution back then and what they did With the original DFH changed the way drum samples sounded forever.\n\nAbout Metal Machine EZX\n\nFor the Metal Machine Toontrack teamed up with Andy Sneap a producer/engineer who have worked we bands like Testament, Megadeth, Arch Enemy and many more.\n\nThe Man behind the drums is John Tempesta (White Zombie, Testament, Helmet), and everything was recorded in the Los Angeles’ Henson Recording Studios.\n\nSpecifications\n\nKicks (Left & Right)\n\nTama Starclassic Quillted Sapele Bubinga 18×22″\n\nTama Starclassic Bubinga 18×24″\n\nLudwig Stainless Steel 14×26″\n\nSnares\n\n14×7″ Tama John Tempesta Signature Series snare drum\n\n6.5×14″ Tama Bell Brass snare drum\n\n6.5×14″ Ludwig Black Beauty\n\n6.5×14″ Ludwig Supraphonic\n\n6.5×14″ Sonor Artist Bronze snare drum\n\n6.5×14″ Dunnett Titanium\n\n6×14″ Masai Bubinga snare\n\nToms\n\nTama Starclassic Bubinga Quillted Sapele 9×10″, 10×12″, 14×14″, 16×16″\n\nTama Starclassic Bubinga 9×10″, 10×12″, 14×16″, 16×18″\n\nLudwig Stainless 12×15″, 16×16″, 16×18″\n\nTama Starclassic Bubinga gong bassdrum 14×20″ (Tom 5)\n\nHats\n\nZildjian Z Custom Master Sound 14″\n\nZildjian Avedis Master Sound 14″\n\nRides\n\nZildjian Earth Ride 22″\n\nZildjian A Ping Ride 22″ Brilliant Finish\n\nCrashes\n\nPos 1\n\n17″ Z3 Zildjian prototype\n\n16″ Medium thin Zildjian prototype crash\n\nPos 2\n\n18″ Medium Zildjian prototype crash\n\n19″ Medium Zildjian prototype\n\nPos 3\n\n19″ Medium Zildjian prototype crash\n\n18″ Z3 Medium crash\n\nPos 4\n\n20″ Z3 Medium Zildjian prototype\n\n19″ Medium Thin Zildjian prototype crash\n\nPos 5\n\n20″ Medium Zildjian prototype crash\n\n18″ Medium Z3 Zildjian prototype\n\nPos 6\n\n19″ Z3 Zildjian Thrash Ride\n\n18″ Medium Zildjian prototype crash\n\nSplash\n\nPos 2\n\n10″ Zildjian prototype splash\n\nChinas\n\nChina 1\n\nZildjian Z3 19″\n\nZildjian 19″ Prototype China\n\nChina 2\n\n20″ Oriental China Trash\n\nZ3 19″\n\nSpocks\n\nPos 3\n\nZildjian Soundlab Prototype 18″ Medium Thin/19″ Z3 China\n\nZildjian Soundlab Prototype 16″ Medium Thin/19″ Z3 China Source\n\nWorking with The Metal Machine EZX\n\nThe first time i loaded up The Metal Machine EZX my jaw dropped, The kit only uses 308MB RAM and sounds just FANTASTIC.\n\nToontrack has succeeded with keeping the resources at minimum without sacrificing the sound.\n\nSo how does it sound\n\nThe Metal Machine EZX brings a truly hi quality metal sound, with nice thick Kick, snappy snare, Toms that has a perfect balance of Punch and bottom, crisp Hi-hat and a great variety of cymbals a Chinas and Rides and Spocks.\n\nThe drums included in The Metal Machine EZX are very nicely pre processed so you dont have to do much if anything to get a nice sounding mix. However, should you feel that you want to tweak the sound then there is headroom to do so.\n\nIf you are a Superior drummer 2.0 Then you can load any EZX inside Superior drummer 2.0, There is even Presets that you get to use with the Metal Machine EZX in Superior.\n\nThis image shows the Nolly presets for the Metal Machine EZX.\n\nHere is a Sound sample of Metal Machine EZX\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat can i say??\n\nWOW i am impressed!\n\nToontrack has delivered a great sounding expansion for EZdrummer, and the Metal Machine EZX brings allot to the table. Once again Toontrack and EZdrummer proves that simplicity can go a long way, the fact that EZdrummer with Metal Machine EZX only uses 308MB is on its own most impressive. Every EZX and SDX has its own MIDI Library, this is a bonus as well.\n\nThe Metal Machine EZX can be found on the market for about $79.99, that is a very good price for what you get.\n\nThe verdict\n\n“Once again Toontrack and EZdrummer proves that simplicity can go a long way”\n\nI want to thank Toontrack for letting me do this review.\n\nAnd to my readers…. THANK YOU!!\n\nWazzup dawfreaks.\n\nHope everything is great!\n\nI am back with a new review and its time for the Toontrack Mastering EZmix Pack for EZmix.\n\nDo you feel that you sometimes had that tool that could lift you MIX, Let us say that you are on the road and need to get your latest song ready and don’t have the time to tweak things to perfection, or maybe you’re a Songwriter that just want your demos to sound professional.\n\nI would like to thank Toontrack for letting me do this review.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHere is Toontracks introduction to the Mastering EZmix pack.\n\nMastering is an art in itself as well as the final and crucial step in making great mixes sound even better. That’s why we wanted one of the best in the business at the helm when designing the presets for this pack. Meet Mats \"Limpan\" Lindfors, senior engineer at Cutting Room, the leading mastering studio in Scandinavia. \"I tried to make this pack cover as much ground as possible\", he says. \"I wanted everyone to find great mastering settings no matter what kind of music they are working on\".\n\nThe Mastering EZmix pack comes with a wide variety of signal chains for the most common mastering needs and music genres. Whether you are working on a loud metal song, a mellow jazz tune or a big house anthem, this pack has one-click settings to take your mix from great to fantastic in no time.\n\nGive your final mixes that extra little bit of detail and attention. Start mastering – it’s EZ!\n\nWhy mastering?\n\nMastering is the final audio processing step before a song is ready for distribution. All tracks you hear on the radio or on albums are mastered. In simple terms, mastering means you take your final mix and add various amounts of EQ, compression and limiter to make it sound as great as possible whether you play it on a car stereo, a hi-fi system or a compact mono radio.\n\nWhat is EZmix 2?\n\nEZmix 2 is a preset based multi-effect mixing tool that lets you assign pro-designed audio processing signal chains to any audio source. Be it guitar, bass, vocals or drums – with EZmix 2 you’ll make great sounding mixes in no time!\n\nWhat you get\n\nThe Toontrack Mastering EZmix pack comes loaded with 50 different mastering presets, this will cover every music category on the market and will most likely have the last little tweak you need.\n\nSo how does it sound?\n\nWhen I first heard of the Mastering EZmix pack I was a bit skeptic even though I knew how good EZmix 2 sounded and how EZ it was to use. The idea of a EZ to use Mastering tool did however sound like a dream come true, so I was very interested in how it would sound.\n\nI have had the Mastering EZmix pack installed for a while now and I have to say this is one amazing tool, I can now lift my mixes in a couple of seconds and the result is just amazing.\n\nWhere I normaly just have a limiter on the Master channel I now only have EZmix 2 with one of the great presets in the Mastering EZmix pack.\n\nif there is something that comes out to strong I just adjust one or both of the knobs or change preset.. THAT is how EZ it is!!\n\nI try to do a video as often as I can when doing my reviews, and this time the song is 90 % Toontrack products used inside Cubase 6.5, Drums is Toontrack Superior Drummer 2 with the Music City USA SDX, Piano is EZkeys but for the bass Toontrack has not come out with a BASS instrument so I used Halion 4.\n\nThis Video was recorded and edited using Camtasia Studio 8\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the first time I heard a Toontrack product I have been impressed with what they do, they always deliver hi quality products but don’t rip your wallet apart with high prices.\n\nToontrack is once again spot on with the Mastering EZmix pack, EZmix 2 is a great tool to start with but the Mastering EZmix pack is just FANTASTIC!!!\n\nNever again will my mixes feel dry and boring, Now you can get the professional sound on your songs that you always wished for.\n\nIf you already own EZmix 2 then what are you waiting for, if you don’t.. GET IT!!\n\nThe EZmix 2 + Mastering EZmix pack is a KILLER combo, and the price to get the Mastering EZmix pack is ONLY € 35,00 that is just a silly low price for what you get.\n\nPROS\n\nEasy to use\n\nGreat sounding\n\nHuge amount of presets\n\nThe Price\n\nCONS\n\nNONE!!!\n\nThe verdict\n\n“Toontrack is once again spot on with the Mastering EZmix pack, EZmix 2 is a great tool to start with but the Mastering EZmix pack is just FANTASTIC!!!”\n\nI would once again like to thank Toontrack for letting me do this review!\n\nAnd to my readers….\n\nTHANK YOU!!!\n\nWhazzup Dawfreaks…\n\nI’m truly sorry that I am not posting as much as some would wish at the moment.\n\nThe new apartment is getting more and more to the state it should be and I have a ton of reviews coming your way as soon as possible.\n\nToday we are going to have a look at Another SDX from Toontrack, The Custom & Vintage.\n\nBefore I go on I would like to Thank Toontrack for letting me do this review.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Custom and Vintage SDX is an expansion pack for the award winning Toontrack Music drumsampler Superior Drummer 2.0. It features extensive stick and brush recordings of a unique collection of drums and cymbals.\n\nThe SDX gives everyone from top producers down, access to the cream of custom and vintage drums, built by craftsmen from the 1920s right up to the exceptional instrument makers of today, like Johnny Craviotto.\n\nMost of these highly prized instruments (like a 1920s Ludwig Black Beauty, or Craviotto Timeless Timber) can only be found in the collections of top studio drummers or hired from rental facilities in the major music centres of the world\n\nRecorded at 2Khz studio in London using an EMI TG Desk used for many legendary recordings of the early seventies including The Beatles Abbey Road and Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon. It is considered one of the best sounding desks ever made.\n\nThe Custom and Vintage SDX was played by Chris Whitten. The drummer on classic hits like What I Am by Edie Brickelland The New Bohemians and The Whole Of The Moon by The Waterboys.\n\nWhitten was hailed as a world class drummer playing on Paul McCartneys Flowers In The Dirt album and subsequent record breaking World tour, and Dire Straits 18 month On Every Street tour. Chris has also recorded with such varied artists as Johnny Cash, Julian Cope, World Party and The Pretenders.\n\nThe Custom and Vintage SDX was produced by Peter Henderson who started his career at Air Studios where he trained and worked with Beatles recording engineer Geoff Emerick (Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road etc). as well as with the legendary George Martin.\n\nHenderson produced Supertramp´s 20 million selling Breakfast In America, for which he won a Grammy. He has also worked with Paul McCartney, Rush, Frank Zappa, Jeff Beck, Tina Turner and Ringo Starr.

The complete Kits in this SDX are Noble & Cooley Star Series, Camco Oaklawn, Slingerland Studio King, Ludwig Keystone Drum Set and Gretsch Round Badge Drum Set. The complete installation of the Custom & Vintage will take roughly 12GB Space on your hard drive, but the installer can also slim the package down if you don’t need all the tools included.\n\nNow Toontrack always ads a set of MIDI files and so you also get a nice set of MIDI files that fits the Custom & Vintage concept to use for your music.\n\nFor a more info on whats included go to https://www.toontrack.com/products.asp?item=56.\n\nWorking with Custom and Vintage\n\nThe GUI in Superior Drummer 2 is no news and there is no difference when loading the Custom & Vintage SDX. The mix layout of Custom and vintage has direct mic channels, Overhead, Ambience , Mono room and Comp room. The Kick has both in and Out channels and the Snare comes with Top and Bottom channels.\n\nWhen it comes to Working with Custom & Vintage It follows the Superior drummer 2 legacy delivering a huge variety of alternative hits and velocity layers giving the user complete control of the drums without any machinegun effects.\n\nAnd as with all Superior Drummer library’s there is a huge headroom for additional tweaking.\n\nSo how does it sound?\n\nThe Custom & Vintage SDX delivers what its supposed to, that classic rock sound we all know from artists like Springsteen, Bryan Adams, Paul McCartney, Rush and Frank Zappa.\n\nThis SDX rely is state of the art for anyone looking for a classic drum sound.\n\nTo show you how the Custom & Vintage sounds I have created a little sample video showing you each of the five Kits loaded with no Effects. I also include a lite tweaked Sample that I made to show you how it sounds with some tweaking.\n\nThis video was recorded and edited with Camtasia studio\n\nConclusion\n\nI am impressed, The custom & Vintage is a great expansion for Superior Drummer 2, it has that classic feeling to it that just makes me smile. The Custom & Vintage is a SDX I can recommend with all my heart as it does not only sound awesome, it comes loaded with different kit pieces so you have a huge variety to work with and to top things of…… 4 TOMS!!\n\nIf you are looking for a rely sweet expansion to your Superior drummer 2 library, and you are not into hardcore metal I truly recommend you to check the Custom & Vintage SDX out.\n\nPros\n\nGreat classic sound\n\nHuge variety of kit pieces\n\n4 Toms!!!\n\nCons\n\nNone\n\nThe Verdict\n\n“Custom & Vintage is a SDX I can recommend with all my heart as it does not only sound awesome, it comes loaded with different kit pieces so you have a huge variety to work with and to top things of…… 4 TOMS!!”\n\nThank you for reading and I hope to se you back soon as there is more reviews to come.\n\nWazzup Dawfreaks…\n\nIn the middle of moving, system upgrades and being a father I wanted to give you a little BFD2 Expansion review.\n\nThis time we will have a look at the Jazz Maple Expansion From FXpansion.\n\nBefore we go on I would like to thank FXpansion for letting me do this review.\n\nWhat is the Jazz Maple Expansion?\n\nBFD Jazz Maple is an expansion pack featuring a Yamaha Maple Custom drum kit, compatible with BFD 2.1 and BFD Eco. The expansion features several bonus ‘lite’ kit-pieces – a Yamaha signature Roy Haynes copper shell snare and a suite of Sabian cymbals.\n\nDownload-only BFD v2.1 expansion kit includes toms played with sticks, brushes and mallets, as well as kicks struck with felt, rubber and wood beaters. New articulations include rim shot and rim clicks for toms (sticks versions only).

Scott picked up his first Grammy in 1995 for engineering Tom Petty’s Wildflowers, scoring two more for his work with Santana onSupernatural and the Foo Fighters’ One By One. In 2007, he doubled his Grammy total, scoring a hat trick for his recording of the Dixie Chicks milestone Taking the Long Way. That album was the most recent of dozens of projects Scott has done with Rick Rubin during the past two decades, from Petty and Johnny Cash to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Slayer. (Bud Scoppa, Mix Magazine July 2007) Source\n\nInstallation\n\nSince the Jim Scott Rock drums vol 1 and 2 is BFD2 expansions, the installation is simple and straight forward and the complete installation will take up roughly 135GB Hdd space.\n\nThis might seam like a huge size BUT since you get 8 kits (7 on the DVD´s and one downloadable Bonus kit 5) it is a fair amount of space.\n\nFor a complete list of what is included I would like you to head over to platinum samples webpage with a nice detailed list www.platinumsamples.com/KitLists/JSDKitList.\n\nAbout The Jim Scott Rock Drums Vol 1 and 2\n\nJim Scott Rock Drums features a selection from Jim’s personal collection of classic drum kits from the 50’s, 60’s and 70’s recorded at his own PLYRZ Studios using his Neve 8048 console and analog outboard gear, as well as samples played by Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Steve Ferrone (Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Average White Band, Eric Clapton) recorded at Sound City Studios (RHCP, Tom Petty, Nirvana) using their Neve 8028 console. The drums compiled in the Rock Drums expansion have been played on albums from Robbie Robertson, The Dixie Chicks and Barenaked Ladies to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Source\n\nThe Jim Scott Rock Drums Loaded.\n\nThe kit I loaded for this picture is Kit 8 (the Steve Ferrone Kit) out of the box it’s the largest kit in terms of Kit pieces.\n\nImpression.\n\nInstead of going through all the kits in text detail I am going to let you se a video of the Jim Scott Rock Drums in action so you can listen to it in your speakers.\n\nI will go through all the basic BFD2 kits where kit 2 also is shown with brushes.\n\nThese Kits except the final one is the default kits as they sound directly from the BFD2 kit preset, nothing has been done to the presets so this is how the kits will sound at start.\n\nIn the end of the video I show you a light tweaked version of kit 8 with the kick from kit 7.\n\nThis video was recorded and edited with Camtasia Studio.\n\nI hope this video gave you a small hint on how the kits in the Platinum Samples Jim Scott Rock Drums sound.\n\nWorking with platinum Samples Jim Scott Rock Drums\n\nPlatinum Samples delivers great sounding drum expansions and the Jim Scott Rock Drums Vol 1 and 2 keeps that legacy intact. There is a total of 256 velocity levels (if set up correct in BFD2) for us to use allowing us superior control and great sounding drums without having the issue of Machinegun sounding drums.\n\nJim Scott who handpicked and recorded these drums at PLYRZ Studios has done a great job, There is a great variety of drums in the two expansions and if you grab these two you will have more then enough for allot of different music styles and genres.\n\nThe Jim Scott Rock Drums sound sweet directly out of the box and I found the KIT 7 and Kit 8 to be spot on for what I like a drum to sound like.\n\nUsing Kit 8 (Steve Ferrone) for Amazing sounding Toms, crisp Hi Hat and great sounding cymbals, I swap the Kick and snare to the once in kit 7 (Chad Smith) This kick that is has a great round yet punchy sound and and snare is snappy and sweet.\n\nall in all Jim Scott Rock Drums work great with just minor volume tweaks but has enough headroom for additional tweaking, and you can mix and match these with any other library you have.\n\nConclusion\n\nExpanding the drum library today is not always an easy task, there is allot of different samples and plugins to pick from.\n\nPlatinum Samples knows how to deliver drum samples, Jim Scott Rock Drums Vol 1 and 2 has allot going for it, combined you get a huge variety of kits that can be combined to open op a huge realm of drums sounds for you.\n\nEvery drum in this Expansion sounds great and you do not have to do allot of tweaking to get a perfect drum for your mix, but there is Headroom to tweak the sound if you want / need to.\n\nThe pricing for the complete set of Vol 1 & 2 is set to $319.99, if you wish to get just one of these two the prices are set to 249.95 for Vol 1 and 129.99 for Vol 2.\n\nLooking at what you get I would say the prices are fair, since this is not a small expansion.\n\nOut of these two Vol 1 is the one like best and I rely RELY like kit 7 and 8.\n\nThe verdict\n\nI would like to thank Platinum Samples for letting me do this review.\n\nWazzup Dawfreaks.\n\nI’m back again with another little Expansion Review.\n\nToday we will have a look at the BFD2 JEX expansion from Fxpansion.\n\nThe Fxpansion JEX is based on a custom hand-made kit from XDrum’s Xotica line.\n\nThe Kit features.\n\nCustom XDrum 18×22 inch kick\n\nCustom XDrum 8×8 inch tom\n\nCustom XDrum 8×10 inch tom\n\nCustom XDrum 8×12 inch tom\n\nCustom XDrum 14×14 inch tom\n\nThe kit has been recorded with hits played with sticks, brushes, mallets and rods.\n\nThe kick drum has been hit with both a felt and wood beater.\n\nNow this is not all, The expansion also comes with bonus download of a detail-reduced Ludwig Super Sensitive snare from the Jazz & Funk expansion pack.\n\nThere are no HI hats or Cymbals included in this expansion but the presets have been set up to add this.\n\nEquipment used for the recordings\n\nKick In – Shure Beta 52 / API 3124 preamp\n\nKick Out – Neumann FET 47 / API 3124 preamp\n\nKick Resonant – Yamaha Sub Kick / Neve VR console channel preamp\n\nSnare Top – Shure Beta 57A / API 3124 preamp\n\nSnare Bottom – EV N/D457 / API 3124 preamp\n\nSnare Side – Violet Design Flamingo Jr. / ATI 8MX2 preamp\n\nToms – Violet Design Globe / ATI 8MX2 preamp\n\nOverhead – Matched pairs of Nuemann KM184s or Violet Design Black Knight mics / ATI 8MX2 preamps\n\nRoom – Violet Design Globe with protoype omni capsules / Focusrite Red preamps\n\nAmb3 – Nevaton MC404 stereo mic placed in the center of the room / Metric Halo ULN2 preamps\n\nSource for this info comes from the Fxpansion Kit page.\n\nAs always FXpansion has a great page for listening to each drum..\n\nHead over and have a listen http://www.fxpansion.com/index.php?page=69&tab=198.\n\nThe JEX kit inside BFD2\n\nImpression\n\nThis kit has a classy deep over all sound!\n\nThe Kick is round with a kind of plastic feel to it, there is allot of bottom in the kick that is nice. The snares is snappy with a fair amount of rattle, The Hi tom felt a bit of compared to the rest of the kit when using sticks, rods or mallets, I can not rely put a finger on what it is but in my ears it just did not balance out with the rest of the toms.\n\nThis changes when using brushes the sound feels more in place, and the kit sounds rely nice with brushes.\n\nThe kit is well recorded and will allow you to work nicely with Velocity’s to get a realistic sounding kit. The kit has a nice amount of tweaking headroom and the Room and Ambient channels brings a nice amount of air to the over all sound.\n\nA small video\n\nHere follows a little video showing the FXpansion BFD2 JEX Kit in action.\n\nFXpansion BFD2 JEX expansion Recorded and edited with camtasia Studio.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe FXpansion BFD2 JEX expansion is not on my Top list of expansions.\n\nDon’t get me wrong this expansion sounds great and would be a great bonus to your BFD2 library if your into Jazz, Funk and even modern POP. As we all know everything is personal so even though I don’t love the kit its not BAD!!\n\nBut if you are looking for a more flexible sounding kit there is better choices.\n\nNow If you have extra cash and like some elements in the JEX expansion the price tag is ONLY 39 Euro a rely nice price.\n\nI would like to thank FXpansion for letting me do this review."
