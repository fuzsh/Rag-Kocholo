        "text": "Do not take the following rhythms charts too seriously. Most of the rhythms below are part of oral traditions, which means you're not supposed to learn them from a piece of paper or a screen. Some real person is supposed to show you how to play it, and give you all kinds of detailed information about the musical and broader social context that is associated with the rhythm, like when to play it, what it means, who's supposed to play it, how you dance to it, how you sing to it, etc.\n\nIf you don't have access to a teacher, internet videos may be more useful to learn the feel and context. Writing the rhythms out enforces the unity of the ensemble, this has advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThink of the following charts as skeletons, and be carefull while reanimating them, so as not to unleash horrifying mockeries of their original forms. A good check is to make sure that the people around you are grooving along with you. A better check is to make sure that people from the same place where the rhythm is from are grooving along with you.\n\nClean starts and stops make drummers sound professional and unified. Most drum parts start with a basic part, do one or more common variations of that part, and then go back to the basic part.\n\nIf this notation looks like gibbering mantras to you, find someone who reads music to figure them out for you, or be patient and analytical. The rhythms are notated in an internet-friendly variation of the Time Unit Boxes system. Many drum machines are programed similarily. Many video games work on the same principle. Think of a vertical bar skipping across the page from left to right, at a constant speed. You follow along one of the parts horizontally, and either play a note or leave a space, like a player piano or a typewriter. When you get to the end of the line you automatically jump back to the beginning without loosing any time."
