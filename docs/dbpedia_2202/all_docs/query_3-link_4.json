But when we say those words, what sonically do we mean? What kind of sound are we referring to? I feel like it's important to try to tease out to ensure we're actually talking about the same thing.\n\nFeel free to describe those characteristics in more detail, but since we're trying to define a sound, and nowadays have access to thousands of \"snare demo\" videos, ideally please post actual video or sound files that exemplify each these characteristics to you.\n\nCurious to see what comes up.

For example when a tree branch \"cracks\", a string of rubber \"snaps\", or a grain of popcorn \"pops\". Regarding bite, no idea how a snare sound can \"bite\" you.\n\nJazzDrumGuy\n\nDFO Star\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 16, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n15,074\n\nReaction score\n\n7,548\n\nLocation\n\nPebble Beach, CA\n\nCrack is a nice tight wood snare sound.\n\nPop would be a high tuned piccolo sound.\n\nSnap would be my fingers counting in....\n\nBite??? I don't think I have ever used that.\n\nWarm, woody, ringy, metallic, fat, loose - these are terms that make sense to me.\n\nrichardh253\n\nDFO Veteran\n\nJoined\n\nOct 28, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n2,938\n\nReaction score\n\n4,655\n\nLocation\n\nBryn Mawr PA\n\n[read any wine label descriptions lately? ]\n\nCSR\n\nMember since May 2000\n\nJoined\n\nAug 5, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n7,667\n\nReaction score\n\n3,549\n\nLocation\n\n- Snow Belt, New York State, USA, Earth\n\nOnomatopoeia in action!\n\ndtk\n\nDFO Star\n\nJoined\n\nOct 6, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n10,277\n\nReaction score\n\n2,149\n\nLocation\n\nNorthbridge MA\n\nhmmm....Every Grover or Phattie snare I've heard popped.

In terms of frequency, this might refer to a peak around 6kHz or higher. With snare drum, might refer to the \"wire\" part of the sound. Or can a snares-off sound have bite, too?"
