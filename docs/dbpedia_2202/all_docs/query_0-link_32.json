        "text": "MT-500\n\nAuto-accompaniment keyboard (electronic musical instrument)\n\nimage: eBay #2570408450\n\nThe Casio Casiotone MT-500 is a classic late '80s Casio model. It features 12 rhythms (aka \"super drums\"), 20 tones, and 4 great rubber pads with interchangeable drum and percussion sounds, all in stereo :-)\n\nThe omnipresent Casio-Chord is available, and it's possible to vary the accompaniments thanks to five sliders that change the pattern of the bass drum/bass, the snare/rim shot/tom, the cymbal/high hat, the hand clap/agogo/bongo, and finally the chord structure.\n\nSeparate sliders are available to control and mix the volumes of the accompaniment and the rhythm, change the tempo, and adjust the main outputs.\n\nThe keyboard is standard Casio mini-keys, four octaves, and it's surprisingly easy to play even for large hands. It's not velocity-sensitive.\n\nThe rhythms and tones themselves are early PCM, and are typical Casio. Among the tones there are a few standouts, like the excellent pipe organ, and the synth. guitar, but if you like retro styles, you'll like this keyboard.\n\nA difference between this and other Casio keyboards of the same era is that it's not possible to change the preset tones in any way... no envelope, vibrato... like it's possible to do on other Casio models.\n\nThe rhythms sound nice and punchy, and gloriously lo-fi. There's also a synchro-start/fill-in button, and a set of two outputs for external drum pads.\n\nCheck out the audio demos here below...\n\nCasio MT-500 Casiotone audio demos\n\nRhythm name with audio demo My comments 16 beat Nice syncopated 16-beat rhythm bossa nova Relaxed, summery and warm :-) disco Great Simmons-style disco tom-toms march Nice military snare pops 1 Nice and happy pops 2 Very nice retro style :-) reggae Superb reggae beat! rock Good rock 'n' roll samba Classic samba accompaniment slow rock Typical '60s style swing Fluid and jazzy waltz Nice\n\nTone name with audio demo My comments bells Static but sparkly. clavichord Nice preset - works as Clavinet double reed Pretty realistic, bassoon-like elec. guitar Overdriven Strat (with a bit of imagination...) elec. piano Of FM, not Rhodes, variety. flute Nice vibrato glockenspiel Nice sample harpsichord Realistic and useful human voice Very interesting and analog sounding! jazz organ 1 Solid Hammond organ jazz organ 2 Variation with a bit of pseudo-reverb panpipe Realistic piano Typical early Casio piano pipe organ Beautiful pipe organ patch synth. guitar Powerful synth. reed Different synth. sound 1 Good synth sound that would benefit immensely from quality fx processing synth. sound 2 Nice variation vibraphone Ok violin Expressive\n\nAnd here's what possible to do using the four yellow hexagonal drum pads:\n\ndrum solos a series of rhythms improvised on the pads, switching the various sounds assigned to them.\n\nFeatures at a glance Year of release: 198_ Polyphony: Presets: 20 Rhythms: 12 Keyboard: 4-octave mini-keys Responds to velocity: no Sound generation method: PCM MIDI: no Sound expansion capabilities: no Effects: no Controls: sliders Outputs: stereo RCA, phones Display: no\n\nCasio MT-500 pictures (click on thumbnails to enlarge)\n\nCasio MT-500 manual\n\nLinks"
