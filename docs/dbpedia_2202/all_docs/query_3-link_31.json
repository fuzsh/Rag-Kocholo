        "text": "You’ll hear 808s in pretty much every trap track in existence. It’s used extensively in pop music and most other forms of electronic music too.\n\nSo what makes an 808 so important to producers and how can you get pro-sounding 808s in your tracks?\n\nIn this article, we’ll look at why the 808 is such an appealing sound, where it came from and how to make tracks with perfect 808s.\n\nWhat is an 808?\n\n808s are a type of electronic percussion sample that originates from the Roland TR-808 drum machine. They’re characterized by a punchy low-end subby-ness that is easily tunable to different pitches.\n\nThe original TR-808 comprised programmable kick, snare, low tom, mid tom, hi tom, clap, cowbell, open hi-hat, closed hi-hat, low conga, mid conga, hi conga, clave, rimshot, maracas and cymbal sounds.\n\n808s are based on static noise that is carefully sound designed to electronically re-create the strike of a beater and resonating drum head.\n\nGenerally, that means a loud attack and a quick resonating decay.\n\nBut today, 808 drums don’t always sound like the original 808s of the TR-808.\n\nProducers have spent a lot of time twisting and sculpting the classic sounds into their own versions, adding distortion, playing with attack and decay, adding compression and more.\n\nJust search 808 on an online sample market and you’ll hear hundreds of different versions.\n\nYou’ll hear 808s in pretty much every trap track in existence.\n\nTR-808 origins\n\nThe 808 sound originated from the Roland TR-808. This drum machine defined the sound of techno and house in the 80s and 90s.\n\nBeyond dance music, the drum machine inspired early hip hop producers like Rick Rubin and Afrika Bambaataa to pioneer the 808 laden sound of 90s hip hop.\n\nIt’s a rare piece of vintage gear that’s still sought after today.\n\nThe TR-808 drum machine defined the sound of techno and house in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThe 808 bass was of particular interest to these early hip-hop producers.\n\nThat’s why today 808 generally refers to the widely used 808 bass drum sample. But still, the snare, clap, cowbell, cymbal hi-hat and other 808 sounds are well-loved and heavily used by many producers.\n\nThe 808 bass’ tendency to rattle trunks and shake club walls gave them an ominousness and intensity that worked well with the lyrics rappers we’re writing during the early 90s.\n\nIt wasn’t long until producers began tweaking the TR-808 stock sounds to create even more hard-hitting versions of the subby kick.\n\nHow to make great 808 drums\n\nFortunately, you don’t need to shell out thousands and buy a vintage drum machine to get an interesting and authentic 808 kick.\n\nIn fact, the modern 808s you hear in trap and electronic music have usually gone through a ton of processing to make them boomier and more distorted.\n\nThere are many ways to affordably create great sounding 808s, let’s take a look at 7 of the most common 808 production techniques.\n\n1. Start with a great 808 sample\n\nTo get started with 808s you need a good sample to work with.\n\nTo get started with 808s you need a good sample to work with.\n\nYour DAW most likely comes with a few options, but if you’re looking for a specific kind of 808 you might want to turn to an online samples market like LANDR Samples.\n\nYou’ll find 1000s of 808s designed by the industry’s best producers.\n\n2. Tune your 808\n\n808s are essentially a short sub-oscillator frequency burst. That means they oscillate to a specific pitch.\n\nIf your 808s aren’t tuned properly they won’t sound right in your arrangement. So make sure you tune your 808s to the key of your track before writing them in.\n\nWe’ve written articles about finding the key of your track before, if you need help.\n\nWe’ll talk a little bit more about 808 music theory later in this article.\n\n3. Know your frequency spectrum\n\n808s by default will take up a ton of space in the low-end of your mix.\n\nThe main concern here is that your 808 sits the more powerful range of the sub-frequency spectrum—ideally above 30Hz.\n\nIf your 808 is too subby it won’t have any power, just make sure your aren’t getting into higher bass frequencies either.\n\nReally, the ideal sub frequency range lies between 30Hz and 60hz.\n\nHot tip: Most speaker systems struggle to reproduce frequencies below 40 Hz. Take extra care around these ultra-low frequencies and make sure to set your high pass filter high enough to deal with them.\n\n4. EQ your 808s to the bottom of your mix\n\nWhen you’re using 808s there’s no debate—the 808s are the only thing that should occupy the bottom end of your mix.\n\nThat means you must EQ some of the low-end out of your kicks and synth bass frequencies. Otherwise, you’ll weaken the impact of your 808s.\n\n5. Increase the attack time on your 808 drums\n\nOne way to distinguish your 808 bass from the other sounds in the low-end of your track is by increasing the attack time of your 808 bass.\n\nThis delays the peak volume of your 808 hits so that you hear the kick first and then the swell of the 808 sub frequencies.\n\nIncreasing the attack time is what helps round out the overall sound of your kick.\n\n6. Clean up the lows with a hi-pass filter\n\nFor any part of your track that isn’t in the low-end the EQ process to bring out your 808s is simple—hi-pass filter any low-end frequencies.\n\nThis ensures that instruments like hi-hats and snares aren’t taking up any of the low-end room that your 808 needs.\n\n7. Sound design your own 808 drum sample\n\nYou can use pretty much any single-cycle waveform to develop your own 808 sound. The original 808 was made with a white noise sample after all.\n\nYou can use pretty much any single cycle waveform to develop your own 808 sound.\n\nIn this video, Andrew Huang shows a process anyone can follow to create their own personal 808 bass sound.\n\nThere’s some pretty technical sound design concepts at play, but if you want the learn the ins and outs of what’s inside an 808 this is the perfect tutorial.\n\n808s and Music Theory\n\nThe 808 isn’t just a drum, it’s a melodic instrument\n\nSo, understanding the role of 808s in music theory will greatly improve the quality of your productions.\n\nWhile the 808 is most commonly recognized as a percussive sound, it has a clear pitch.\n\nThis means it doesn’t just occupy a rhythmic role; it can contribute to the harmonic and melodic structures within your track.\n\nAn 808 kick, particularly when it has a long decay, effectively functions as a bass instrument. That’s why tuning your 808s is so crucial.\n\nIf the pitch of your 808 kick doesn’t match the key of your song, it can create a dissonant effect, which may or may not be what you’re going for.\n\nIn most contemporary music genres, especially in trap and hip-hop, the 808 often carries the bassline, providing both the low-end foundation and outlining the harmonic progression of the song.\n\nSo tune your 808s to play the root notes of the chords in your progression, reinforcing the harmonic structure of your track.\n\nOr try tuning your 808s to play fifths (the fifth note in your scale) and octaves can bring a different vibe to your music—rappers like Lil Baby and Juice WRLD love beats that use a gliding effect from note to note, to give their 808s a sliding sound\n\nSome producers will also program their 808s to follow or counter the melody line, introducing a layer of complexity and interest to the track.\n\nCelebrate the 808\n\nIt’s not very often that a single sound or piece of gear sparks an entire new generation of music.\n\nBut the TR-808 and the 808 bass absolutely falls into this category.\n\nThere’s nothing better than the feeling of hearing your track pound through a club’s sound system with the help of a great sounding 808 kit.\n\nNow put some 808s in your next track!"
