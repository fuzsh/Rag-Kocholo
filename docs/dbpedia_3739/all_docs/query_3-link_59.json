        "text": "Exercise for peer review, i am going to go through a theoretical exercise in setting up a private fire department for an imaginary client. I am going to welcome all constructive comments. I want to see if i could do it in order to prove to MYSELF that i have the ability to do so or not...\n\nI guess the first thing i need to do is to describe the client this will enable those who feel that they can comment have sufficient background to be able to provide constructive criticism.\n\nSo the client is a Major property developer based in somewhere in the UAE, they have requested the provision of a fire department for a new development consisting of;\n\na mix of private housing villas and multi story buildings,\n\na shopping mall,\n\nentertainment areas including cafes, restaurants, cinema, sports fields, lakes and canals, parks, golf course\n\nSupport buildings including sub stations, waste water treatment, storage areas, contractors workshops,\n\nThe total area covered is around 25 square kilometers.\n\nI am to be employed by the Developer receiving a salary as will all the staff. There is currently no budget figure, i have to provide this as part of my paper (im not really much good at this part!) I have to ensure that i give value for money and can set the station/s up in the most cost effective way using qualified firefighters from any background, however in order to comply with UAE law a percentage must UAE Nationals. The aim is not to make profit as we are all employees, but to provide a quality service that matches or exceeds international and current local standards of emergency cover currently being provided by others. That said it should be noted that the department can cover some of its costs by providing training to external organsiations and retailers who are going to be providing services and goods to those living and working at the site.\n\nIt is important to establish as early as possible exactly what the cleint wants and then to perhaps advise them on what, firstly we as a team can provide and also based on the risk assessment what they should consider providing in terms of emergency response. Afterall whats the point of having highly trained line resuce firefighters if there are MWEP's available? or highly skilled and qualified paramedics if there is an ambulance station or post within a couple of minutes of the location? These skills require regular refreshing and on going training which is a cost to the client, a cost that they may well decide is to much for them.\n\nAs a team we will be responsible for inspections, risk assessments, commissioning of fire systems prior to handover, provision of emergency response and standby cover on the site during construction and after occupation. This is to include medical (as first responders) and special rescue, i.e. confined spaces rescue, water rescue and road traffic incidents etc. We will also be manning the control room to mobilise resources to incidents within the boundary of the site and liaison with the local civil defense stations.\n\nOne of the first things to consider is the risk assessment for the site and for individual areas. From this risk assessment it should be possible to determine the resources required to control any incident that may occur. These risk assessments can not be carried out by 1 person in my opinion. It would require a team of well qualified and highly experienced fire officers. Those with career municipal and or city fire department experience. The risk assessment should ensure that the worst case scenario is taken into account. the money pot is not a bottomless pit and the use of local civil defense resources should be factored into the risk assessment. This should reduce the amount of expensive equipment the client needs to acquire. Further to this, use of equipment already on site and used for maintenance should also be taken into account as part of the process. Why spend a $1000 USD on high angle rescue courses for say 20 fire fighters and ongoing refresher training if the site has a MWEP available? it would be better in my opinion to have a \"Safe working at height\" course saving money and use the MWEP for any rescues thereby eliminating the hazards and lowering the risk factor considerably. The same philosophy applies to medical or first responder duties, there is little or no point in employing highly qualified paramedics of the National Ambulance are available within the required time. It would be far better to ensure that all personnel are trained in first aid at say first responder level, than to have the ongoing training and registratin at paramedic level and the asociated costs with remaining current. The other thing to consider is the salary required to employ a paramedic as opposed to a first responder...\n\nAn important part of this work would also be to establish the standards to which the department will work. This is a contentious point here in the UAE, mainly due to the lack of a definitive UAE standard. The adoption of either European or US standards are the only options available here. It is possible to develop our own standard with a mix of US and UK upon which most of the legislation here is based and my recommnedation would be that we do exactly that. Using current UAE legislation and guidance to develop an Emergency Response standard suitable for the client but which actually has some substance. This would also allow for a mix of expats to be employed with suitable experience and qualifications as well as local firefighters. It should also ensure that we can integrate with the local civil defense and this will require a mix of US and UK guidance.\n\nThere is a document that covers pretty much everything i have mentioned up till now. Although this document currently only applies in Abu Dhabi it is a very good reference document and i would use this as my guide when setting up my team and in discussions with my employer. The document is Abu Dhabi Environment and Safety Regulatory Instrument, AD EHSMS RF CoP 6.0 this along with the UAE Life Safety Code of Practice and other relevant federal and local laws would be used as reference. Hwwere there is conflict the Federal Laws take precedence.\n\nEquipment\n\nThe purchase of equipment for any fire department is a massive expense from the capital budget around $300,000 USD per vehicle depending on size, type and specification. These capital costs can be lowered by simply changing the way we purchase equipment. With ongoing maintenance costs and resale values needing to be considered as part of the equation it would be prudent to investigate the leasing of all equipment with mainternance plans included as part of the deals. This is normal practice in the UK and other countries. For example London Fire and Rescue lease all PPE fire trucks and equipment and have reduced their budgets significantly as a result. This also ensures that equipment that may become damaged or out of use for any reason will be replaced based on a priority scale.\n\nBy taking a total care package for PPE for example the cost of a set of fire leggings and jacket at around $1500 US per person from the capital budget this cost can be transferred to the operating budget and the cost of replacement due to damage or contamination, can be reduced to zero providing new PPE within hours from the contractor. This eliminates large expenditure due to failure or replacement for any equipment and also ensures that all staff are operationally ready at all times reducing the need for expensive overtime.\n\nObviously there will still be a need to purchase some equipment and PPE, and this should be subject to a process of evaluation. This process must involve the HSE department and purchasing, while we as the SMEs should provide specific guidance a lot of ppe and equipment is already available in the construction industry and we need to be careful on our specific requirements. It is important to refer back to the risk assessments to determine the best level of PPE where we are unable to eliminate the risk. Reference should be made to existing users and where other fire services are already using a specific piece of equipment or type of PPE advice will be sought to get there opinions on its use etc.\n\nThe first stage of any selection of equipment should be to determine what we actually need the equipment or PPE to do, and to what standards it will do it too. This is relatively easy NFPA details fire truck standards with pump capacity etc this standard would be used in conjunction with the risk assessments to determine what is best and most practical for the area and risks being covered. Following this exercise a specification should be written and sent to prospective suppliers, a process pf evaluation should be carried out by an equipment committee which would be made up from departments already mentioned above.\n\nThe same thing applies to PPE and work wear, now we will see if anyone has reached this point in this slightly long article! i do not believe that white shirts black trousers and CFO DCFO etc markings are right when you leave the UK fire service i see all to often ex Watch managers, Crew Managers and the like giving themselves CFO DCFO DO SDO ADO rank markings why? i have my opinion which i will keep to myself. I also dont think that the old fire service uniform is appropriate for the job. If you are managing a team, and thats really what needs to be considered here why do you need 1, the rank markings and 2, the job title from your old fire service? which you never had in the first place! (in 99% of cases) I am a manager i manage a team of fire fighters, if i want to take on this role then i should go and buy myself a suit for meetings and official business or wear the same as everyone else, around the fire station everyone knows im the boss surely?! If i have an operational role which i almost certainly would have then my helmet would denote my position or my tabbard would do so on the fire ground.\n\nI am not a fan of overalls or coveralls either they make a badly dressed person look worse! i am a fan of polo shirts and trousers they look smart when worn properly and can provide corporate identity as well as departmental identity, and are practical to wear when carrying out normal work for example testing and maintenance tasks. Fire gear can be worn over it without the wearer overheating during the summer or during firefighting operations. This would of course need to be considered by the relevant departments with cost of supply being considered. This again can be part of a total care package supplied by one provider reducing costs further.\n\nShifts and personnel\n\nHere we go again.... So personnel, jobs in this part of the world and in this industry seem to be given to mates its who you know in a lot of cases not really what you know. I dont subscribe to this either and as the team leader it would not be a factor in the employment process. Its important to me that the team i employ are capable, they can do the job to the required standard and wont let the team down. The trouble with Brits and Westerners on the whole is that they are a demanding bunch, we want good salaries, good shifts, good allowances and in return i might get a decent officer out of it. Trouble is that they are expensive! now having worked here for a few years and worked with lots of different nationalities there are lots of different approaches to work, it is this that needs to be tapped into, the old saying horses for courses is very true especially working here in the UAE. I know some fantastic UAE officers and fire fighters as well as Indian and Filipino, i know some very good UK and American Officers and firefighters and its important to have a good mix of experience and cultural backgrounds when working anywhere in the UAE. The team would be made up of a mixture of people from all walks of life and jobs would be awarded to those best qualified and EXPERIENCED to do the job, and not because they are my mates from where ever. Cost is the ever important part of this and it is important to note different salaries paid to different nationalities. I am not a fan of this but it is part of living and working here in the UAE and other parts of the world.\n\nShifts are important, the client wants 24 hour coverage but it appears that the site is all but closed down from midnight, shops and commercial premises would be closed, so is it necessary to have a full compliment of fire fighters on duty? I dont think so, and with the site being covered by fixed systems and the latest fire alarm systems it may be that the personnel on duty can be reduced during the period between midnight and 6am. It would be advantageous to have staff accommodation on the development. With multi room villas or apartments for married and single bedroom accommodation for bachelors actually as part of the development, this essentially is a zero cost to the client assuming that every 3rd property is free from construction costs as it is in the UK. The use of the risk assessment is again of primary importance in the decision making for the numbers of firefighters required to be on duty at any one time. Until sufficient call data can be collected a coverall shift system would be implemented.\n\nThe size and timings of the shifts would be determined by the risk assessment. However for arguments sake i will say 3 shifts of 1x Shift Leader, 1x Deputy shift leader, 8 x Fire fighters each shift will do 48 hours on duty with 72 hours off, (2 on 4 off ). There would be a Fire Team Manager and a Deputy, and a Fire Inspector, the fire inspector is there to ensure that the inspections and commissioning of the equipment is carried out correctly and to report on his findings, he would also deputize for the Deputy team Manager. Along with 1 admin support who could work for other departments as well we would be self supporting and of little burden to other departments.\n\n8 Fire fighters with a minimum of 6 riders available at all times allows for 2 to be absent for any reason. Long term sickness or injury would need to be covered by either temporary moves or long periods of over time divided among the remainder of the other two shifts. This is the least preferable of the two options due to the cost involved.\n\nRotations of the fire fighters and officers is another problematic issue some people want 28 28 some want to be resident here etc. My personal preference for the team would be that everyone lives here. I have a reason for that decision and its this. Being paid here and living here means that the money you earn is being spent here maybe not all of it but a fair proportion of it would be kept within the country, not that this in anyway benifits me but it does the country i have chosen to live in. When the options are compared to each other there isnt a lot to choose from, however by choosing the living here option it has a few side effects that shouldnt be under estimated. 1, your staff are always available especially if the developer agrees to supply housing, 2 not returning from a leave period, this becomes easier for me to manage as they may not have been on leave for a month already, 3 Running from debt, its a bit harder to run from debt if you live here than if you are on 28/28, 4 transferring large sums of money for flights places a burden on the payrol department and with the cost of flying differing vastly it could actually save money by having everyone live here. I stand to be corrected assuming anyone has read this far!\n\nSo what did i miss?"
