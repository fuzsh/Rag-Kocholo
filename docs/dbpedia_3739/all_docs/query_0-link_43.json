        "text": "Raleigh is disciplining an unknown number of firefighters after a local rapper filmed a music video at Raleigh Fire Station 12.\n\nThe city previously said it was investigating after the rapper known as CEO Shoutoutt filmed his “Fire Drill” freestyle rap in front of the station on Poole Road.\n\nOn Thursday, a group that represents local firefighters said those involved had been disciplined and that the group was looking into the matter.\n\n“We are aware of disciplinary actions issued to the members we represent for the incident that occurred on January 29th outside station 12,” according to a statement from the Raleigh Professional Fire Fighters Association. “We are looking further into the matter to ensure all policies and procedures were followed.”\n\nWhat’s in the video?\n\nThe video, shared on the rapper’s YouTube page, shows two Raleigh fire trucks with their lights on and the rapper wearing a plastic red fire helmet. No firefighters appear in the music video.\n\nCEO Shoutoutt uses profanity, references guns and flips off the camera. He also mentions his taste in women, his family member in jail and how he’s the “real deal” over others.\n\n‘Not reflective’ of city values\n\nOn Thursday, the city’s public information officer, Julia Milstead, said the incident was a personnel matter and was handled internally.\n\n“The Raleigh Fire Department is aware of the rap video produced in front of Station 12,” Milstead said in a previous statement. “The Raleigh Fire Department is investigating the matter further. This video is not reflective of the City’s or RFD’s values.”\n\nThe News & Observer has asked to speak with the fire chief. and requested dismissal, suspension and demotion information for employees at Station 12.\n\nWhat the rapper said\n\nThe rapper addressed the controversy on his social media pages back in February, saying he didn’t do anything wrong and that he “asked” for permission to film at the location.\n\nIn an interview with CBS17, CEO Showoutt said he asked people at the station if he could film his music video there, which they agreed to.\n\n“There was no problem. They heard it. He actually told me I sounded good,” he told CBS17. “I didn’t know that was going to be a problem.”"
