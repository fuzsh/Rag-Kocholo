Importance of Fire Safety Services Firefighters (historically firemen) are rescuers extensively trained primarily to extinguish hazardous fires that threaten civilian populations and property, and to rescue people from dangerous incidents, such as collapsed and burning buildings. The increasing complexity of modern industrialized life with an increase in the scale of hazards has created an increase in the skills needed in firefighting technology and a broadening of the firefighter-rescuer's remit. They sometimes provide emergency medical services. The fire service, or fire and rescue service, also known in some countries as the fire brigade or fire department, is one of the main emergency services. Firefighting and firefighters have become ubiquitous around the world, from wild land areas to urban areas, and aboard ships. b. Negative Effects of Fire Fire for one consumes oxygen and burns flammable items. They can burn down whole forests and everything! They can burn things not meant to be burned like plastic releasing toxic fumes into the air. It can burn animals and people too. Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning. Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems across the globe. The negative effects of fire include water contamination, soil erosion, atmospheric pollution and hazard to human and animal life. c. Positive Effects of Fire The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems. Fire has been used by humans for cooking, generating heat, signaling, and propulsion purposes. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND During President Marcos Administration (1970’s) PD 1185 also known as the FIRE CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES was enacted in answer to the increase of fire incidents that affect the development of our country. Memorandum of Agreement was also made between the Fire Code of the Philippines and the National Building Code (P.D. 1096) to incorporate in building plans fire safety feature. Fire service in the Philippines was first designated to selected members of the Philippine Constabulary- Integrated National Police. These personnel serve their duties and responsibilities as firefighters. For organizations, the same philosophy follows. Every group strives for due acceptance and distinct respect from the society. And one agency in the midst of this feat is the Bureau of Fire Protection that has BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION\n\n4. General Information Fire Brigade Mandatory Training – Version 1.0 August 2012 Training Course Provided by the Pre-Fire Planning, Training and Community Relations Section (PFPT-CRS), Zamboanga City Fire District (ZCFD), Bureau of Fire Protection – 9 (BFP-9) Page 4 of 11 struggled afar in its existence. Firefighters were under the PC-INP administration. Gone were the days when BFP was just a shadow of the defunct Philippine Constabulary-Integrated National Police (PC-INP). With Republic Act 6975 or the DILG Act of 1990, the BFP has built its own image and has become one of the dynamic and vibrant arms of the government in the public safety services. And with the passage of Republic Act 9514 otherwise known as the Fire Code of the Philippines of 2008, the BFP has opened floodgates of hopes, avenues for changes and boulevards of opportunities to create an even better stature in the arena of public safety service. Optimistic of the good things the new law will provide, the entire organization exhausts every possible means to live up to the mandates of law and enforce it with equality and justice, fairness and impartiality, righteousness and integrity. Yet, the bitter truth is that it is close to impossible to gratify everybody, especially when the people concerned became used of the habitual practices where comfort abounds in clutched of illicit advantage. It also serves as an avenue for collaboration among enforcers and practitioners to share knowledge and expertise which can result to a more developed and enhanced fire safety profession. It further guaranteed compliance with the extant provision of the new Fire Code allowing the BFP to accredit Fire Safety Practitioners as cohorts in ensuring fire safety in buildings or structures, thus, sharing its responsibilities and accountabilities with others. As the agency now looks forward to a more improved and enhanced BFP, it is imperative that innovative ways of dealing with the evolving fire safety technology be also considered to be in step with the change of time. And as it crosses amid change, it has still a long way to go, but with mutual respect, dedication and vigor to greatness among its personnel and the active involvement of the general public, there is really no such thing as impossible. Mission To prevent and suppress destructive fires, investigate its causes and provide emergency medical and rescue services, and enforce other fire related laws with active involvement of the community. BFP is responsible for ensuring public safety through prevention and/or suppression of all destructive fires on buildings, houses, and other similar structure, forests, and land transportation vehicles and equipment, ships/vessels docked at piers, wharves or anchored at major seaports, petroleum industry installations. It is also responsible for the enforcement of the Fire Code of the Philippines (RA 9514) and other related laws, conduct investigations involving fire incidents and causes thereof including the filing of appropriate complaints/cases. BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION We commit to prevent and suppress destructive fires, investigate its causes, enforce fire code and other related laws, and respond to man-made and natural disasters and other emergencies\n\n5.

General Information Fire Brigade Mandatory Training – Version 1.0 August 2012 Training Course Provided by the Pre-Fire Planning, Training and Community Relations Section (PFPT-CRS), Zamboanga City Fire District (ZCFD), Bureau of Fire Protection – 9 (BFP-9) Page 7 of 11 At present, the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) has insufficient number of personnel and equipment. Hence, it welcomes the support of private volunteer fire brigades and firefighters during fire incidents. However, because of the absence of the clear cut rules or guidelines to define the relationship between the BFP firefighters and the Volunteer Fire Brigades (VFB) during fire incidents, problems are bound to arise especially in establishing lateral coordination among all responding volunteer units during the conduct of firefighting operations. In order to improve the existing cooperation between government firefighters and Volunteer Fire Brigades, the Secretary, DILG called for the formulation of standard operating procedures or set of protocols that will determine how the volunteer firefighters can best assist the BFP during fires. The Bureau of Fire Protection, being the agency with the legal mandate as provided for by RA 6975, should supervise the training of members of Volunteer Fire Brigades, orienting them on the decorum of fire fighters and protocol in firefighting, and giving lectures on the maximization of the effectiveness of the personnel and synchronization with the Bureau’s resources to avoid unnecessary traffic and obstacles during firefighting operations. To this effect, the BFP has to establish SOPs that will define the role of VFBs during the conduct of the firefighting operations. To effect its legal mandate, the Bureau of Fire Protection shall evaluate all registrant Volunteer Fire Brigades prior to their registration with the SEC. The BFP must favorably indorse the VFB’s application before the SEC issues the corresponding Certificate of Incorporation. DIVISION 2. ORGANIZATION OF FIRE BRIGADES SECTION 6.0.2.1 REQUIREMENTS A. All business establishments employing at least fifty (50) persons shall, in addition to the requirements set forth under Section 7 of RA 9514 for the grant of Fire Safety Inspection Certificate (FSIC), establish an organization of fire brigade to deal with fire and other related emergencies. The head of the company, through its duly designated safety officer shall evaluate the potential magnitude of a fire emergency within the company, and the availability of firefighting assistance from the BFP to determine the nature of the organization to be established. B. For buildings having various occupancies, the Building Administrator and/or owner shall initiate the organization of a fire brigade in the premises irrespective of the number of occupants. C. In cases where a fire brigade is already established for a building, said fire brigade shall be sufficient to comply with the requirements of para “A” of this Section. D.

Fire Alarm and Communication Contemporary fire protection involves a variety of communications requirements associated with each phase of an emergency response – from the initial alarm report to activities en route, during and following an incident. As members of a team it is important for firefighters to be familiar with the components of a fire communications system. Understanding systems capabilities and the firefighter’s role in achieving state goals and priorities ensures that when the time comes, each person knows how to communicate effectively. This benefit everyone involved in an emergency. COMMUNICATION -Is defined as the process of sending information so that the receiver can understand and respond effectively. FOUR BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS 1. Information from the caller must be RECEIVED. 2. UNDERSTOOD 3. RECORDED ACCURATELY and 4. COMMUNICATED to emergency responders REPORTS FROM CITIZENS CAN USUALLY BE CATEGORIZED AS: 1. True Emergencies 2. Perceive Emergencies 3. Non-urgent reports 4. Request for Information When answering an Emergency Call. 1. Answer calls promptly 2. Always identify your department and yourself, 3. Use a calm professional manner when speaking on the phone, 4. Take accurate messages 5. If it’s a report on emergency, know the following: a. Type of incident. b. Address of emergency. c. Cross street or landmark d. Caller’s name and location. e. Call back number. BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION\n\n19.

Ability to make decisions based on common sense and standard values. 3. Ability to maintain composure in high stress condition. 4. Ability to remember details and recall information easily. FIRE ALARM SYSTEM An automatic fire alarm system is designed to detect the unwanted presence of fire by monitoring environmental changes associated with combustion. In general, a fire alarm system is classified as either automatically actuated, manually actuated, or both. Automatic fire alarm systems are intended to notify the building occupants to evacuate in the event of a fire or other emergency, report the event to an off-premises location in order to summon emergency services, and to prepare the structure and associated systems to control the spread of fire and smoke.  Manually actuated devices; Break glass stations, Buttons and manual fire alarm activation are constructed to be readily located (near the exits), identified, and operated.  Automatically actuated devices can take many forms intended to respond to any number of detectable physical changes associated with fire: convected thermal energy; heat detector, products of combustion; smoke detector, radiant energy; flame detector, combustion gasses; fire gas detector, and release of extinguishing agents; water-flow detector. The newest innovations can use cameras and computer algorithms to analyze the visible effects of fire and movement in applications inappropriate for or hostile to other detection methods. ALARM SYSTEMS These are devices which includes the following: a. Fire Alarm boxes b. Automatic Alarms c. Local Alarm Systems d. Emergency Phones BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION\n\n20.

There are technical variations to this but that is beyond the scope of this module. In this module we will discuss the procedures of properly using radios especially VHF radios. 1. Understand and get familiar with the etiquette of radio communication. The international radio communication language is English except in cases where you are licensed for to speak in some other language. Using the radio is not like talking on the phone, it is a two-way communication, meaning you cannot speak and listen at the same time or break into the conversation. NEVER interrupt if you hear other people talking. Patiently wait until their conversation is finished unless it is an emergency, in which case you must inform the other parties that you have a very urgent emergency message. Do not respond to others' calls if you aren't sure it is for you. Never transmit sensitive, confidential, financial and military information in a radio communication, it could be heard by anyone on the same frequency. 2. Always perform radio checks and ensure that your radio is in good working condition. Ensure that the battery is charged and the power is on. Keep the volume high enough to be able to hear any call outs and regularly make radio checks with other stations to make sure everything is working just fine. 3. Memorize the call signs and locations of other persons and radio stations to whom you may communicate. In radio communication you are not called by your name. Everybody has their own unique call sign. Watch out if you hear any unauthorized or unknown call sign communicating on the network and report it immediately to the radio room. BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION\n\n21.

Think before you speak. Decide on what you are going to transmit and to whom it is meant for. Make it as concise, precise and as clear as possible and avoid using long and complicated sentences. Do not use abbreviations or spoken phrases. If necessary, write down your message before transmitting it. If your message is long, divide it into understandable short messages. 5. To call a station, first listen to ensure the channel is clear for you. Press the PTT (Push-To-Talk) button and after 2 seconds say the recipient's call sign twice followed by \"THIS IS\" and your call sign. Convey your message once the receiver replies and the communication is established. A typical radio conversation would be as follows: You: Papa November One, Papa November One, This is Papa November Nine, Message Over! Recipient: Papa November Nine, This is Papa November One, Go Ahead, Over! You: (You now say your message), Acknowledge, Over! Recipient: Wilco (means your message was well received and will act upon), Over! You: This is Papa November Nine, Out! Note how in the beginning and the end of the transmission you pronounce your call sign so that people know who is talking. If you have an emergency message and need to interrupt others' conversations, wait and listen until you hear \"Over\", Press PTT and call (\"BREAK, BREAK, BREAK, This is (your call sign), I have emergency message for (recipient's call sign), Do you copy, Over!\"). 6. Follow the four golden rules of Radio conversation. o Clarity: Your message should be clear enough. Speak slower than normal speed so that people can understand you better, do not shout. o Simplicity: Your message should be simple for everyone to understand. o Brevity: Your message should be precise and to the point. o Security: Follow the security procedures; do not transmit confidential information on the radio. 7. Memorize the phonetic alphabet as you will have to use it in your conversations. Following is a table showing the international phonetics used for the alphabet. A - ALPHA B - BRAVO C - CHARLIE D - DELTA E - ECHO F - FOXTROT G - GOLF H - HOTEL I - INDIA J - JULIET K - KILO L - LIMA M - MIKE N - NOVEMBER O - OSCAR P - PAPA Q - QUEBEC R - ROMEO S - SIERRA T - TANGO U - UNIFORM V - VICTOR W - WHISKEY X - X-RAY Y - YANKEE Z - ZULU BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION\n\n22.

Communicating through the radio this way might be a little challenging at first and you will feel the rush to talk as you normally do in your day to day conversations, but with practice and patience you could be a good radio communicator. Caution: • Note that a license must be acquired from the government prior to using any type of radio device for communication. RADIO PROCEDURES SPECIFIC PROCEDURE 1. Transmission code (10 codes). 2. Plain English. 3. Apparatus code. General Procedures which can promote effective communication 1. Avoid unnecessary talk or transmission. 2. Determine if air is clear.(Check frequency) 3. Hold microphone correctly. 4. Speak clearly/calmly 5. Give priority to working units. 6. Proper languages 7. Don’t touch antenna. 8. Don’t lay the microphone down. 9.

Safe firefighting techniques are universal. They are the same regardless of where you fight fires. Building construction and firefighting procedures may vary, but safety and safe operating procedures on the fire ground are universal. The following are 60 firefighting survival tips for some of the most dangerous firefighting operations. These techniques are known and sometimes taken for granted by veteran firefighters but are unknown to young recruits. All firefighters should understand and practice these firefighting survival tips. 1. When stretching a hose line to an upper floor of a building, do not pass a floor on fire unless a charged hose line is in position on that floor. 2. Notify your officer when going above a fire to search for victims or vertical extension of flame or smoke. 3. When climbing or descending a stairway between the fire floor and the floor above, stay close to and face the wall. Heat, smoke, and flame rise vertically up the stairwell. 4. If you enter a smoke- and heat-filled room, hallway, or apartment above a fire and suspect flashover conditions behind you, locate a second exit, a window leading to a fire escape or portable ladder, before initiating the search. 5. Crouch down and keep one leg outstretched in front of you when advancing an attack hoseline in a smoke-filled fire room. Proceed slowly, supporting your body weight with your rear leg. Your outstretched leg will feel any hole or opening in the floor deck in your path of advance. 6. To prevent getting driven off a fire floor by rollover-the sudden flashes of flame mixed with smoke (ignition of combustible gases at ceiling level) while waiting for the hose line to be charged, crouch down outside of the burning room or apartment, close the door to the burning area. When the line is charged, open the door and immediately attack the fire. 7. During a fire in a one-storey strip store, vent the roof skylight over the fire before advancing the hoseline to prevent injury from backdraft explosion, or flashover. 8. When it is not possible to vent the rear or roof of a burning store quickly and signs of back draft or explosion are evident from the front of the store, vent the front plate-glass windows and doors, stand to one side, let the superheated combustible gases ignite temporarily, and then advance the hoseline for fire attack. 9. Self-contained breathing apparatus must be worn before entering a cellar of a burning building, even if there is only a light haze of smoke. Carbon monoxide, a deadly, gaseous byproduct of combustion, is colorless, odorless, explosive, and quickly builds up in unventilated below grade areas. BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION\n\n35. GENERAL FIRE SUBJECTS Fire Brigade Mandatory Training – Version 1.0 August 2012 Training Course Provided by the Pre-Fire Planning, Training and Community Relations Section (PFPT-CRS), Zamboanga City Fire District (ZCFD), Bureau of Fire Protection – 9 (BFP-9) Page 24 of 30 10. Notify your officer and wear self-contained breathing apparatus before entering a cellar to shut off utilities. If there is confirmation of the shutoff within a reasonable amount of time or there is no radio contact, the officer must make an immediate effort to locate the firefighter and assure his safety. 11. Do not let the presence of an operating sprinkler give you a false sense of security. Wear your SCBA before entering a cellar. Carbon monoxide gas can be present even when a sprinkler is discharging and controlling a smoldering fire. 12. At any collapse, stretch a hoseline and charge it to protect possible victims and rescuers from sudden explosion and flash fire. 13. Shut off all utilities-gas, electric, and water-immediately upon arrival at a building collapse. Do not wait for the utility company. 14. Heavy mechanical equipment, such as cranes and bulldozers, should not be used to remove collapsed portions of a building while hand digging is being done nearby. 15. Parts of a structure that are in danger of collapsing during a rescue operation should be shored up, remove with a crane but never pulled down by firefighters below. 16. When climbing a fire escape during a fire, always maintain a hold with one hand on a part of the fire escape itself to prevent serious fall injury should a stair tread suddenly give way. 17. Before climbing a gooseneck ladder leading from a top-floor fire escape landing to the roof, vigorously pull the ladder away from the building to test its stability. The gooseneck ladder could pull away from the building if the metal fire escape or the wooden or masonry structure to which it is attached is corroded. 18. When taking up from a fire, the fire escape drop ladder is returned to and secured at its normal raised position. Firefighters should never attempt to descend to the street from the fire escape balcony by climbing down the drop ladder in raised position and then dropping down to the sidewalk. Pendulum hooks holding fire escape drop ladders have suddenly broken from their connections and firefighters on them have been seriously injured. A firefighter should use a portable ladder or enter an apartment served by the balcony in order to descend to the street level. 19. Stand away from the weights when lowering a counterbalance weighted ladder. They may collapse from the impact of the ladder striking the side-walk. 20. When forcible entry is required for an inward-swinging door behind which there is intense heat and fire, the inward swing must be controlled. A firefighter or officer should hold the doorknob closed with a gloved hand or short piece of rope while other firefighters force the lock open. 21. A firefighter performing forcible entry on a door to an apartment on fire is extremely vulnerable to injury from backdraft or smoke explosion once the door is opened and air flows into the fire area. The firefighter is in error if he believes he can avoid a blast by observing warning signs or by reacting in a split- BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION\n\n36. GENERAL FIRE SUBJECTS Fire Brigade Mandatory Training – Version 1.0 August 2012 Training Course Provided by the Pre-Fire Planning, Training and Community Relations Section (PFPT-CRS), Zamboanga City Fire District (ZCFD), Bureau of Fire Protection – 9 (BFP-9) Page 25 of 30 second. Explosions happen too fast. The only real protection a firefighter has against explosion is his protective equipment-gloves, mask face-piece, helmet, hood, turnout coat, pants, and boots-properly worn and in good condition. 22. Generally, when a firefighter must use an axe for entry it should be moved forward forcefully in a punching action. The power behind the axe movement comes from the firefighter's shoulder and the weight of the axe, not the swing. If it is necessary to swing an axe during a forcible entry operation, first check for nearby firefighters and overhead obstructions. 23. A firefighter entering a room from a ladder should first place any tools inside the window on the floor before entering. Then, with both hands free, he should grab onto a portion of the window and test its stability. If it does not move, the firefighter maintains his grip on the window while moving through it from the ladder. 24. When necessary, a firefighter climbing an aerial ladder should use a ladder belt to secure himself to the rungs. A leg lock is not be used as a substitute for a ladder belt because it will not help if a victim jumps out a window and down the ladder. 25. Firefighters should never be up on an aerial ladder while it is being raised, rotated, or extended. The ladder must be in position before climbing; that means making sure that the ladder locks are set, too. 26. The priorities for removing a victim from a burning building are, from highest to lowest: smoke proof tower, interior enclosed stairway, safe fire escape, aerial platform, aerial ladder. 27. When climbing into a window of a burned-out or vacant building, drop your tools inside the window before entering and listen to them strike the floor. If you don't hear the tool strike the floor, either the window opens into an elevator shaft way or the floor is burned away. 28. Whenever there is a danger of wall collapse, an officer in command must establish a collapse danger zone. A collapse danger zone should be equal to the height of the unstable wall. All firefighters should be withdrawn away from the burning building to a distance at least equal to the height of the wall. 29. The officer establishing the collapse danger zone must take into account not only how far outward the wall may collapse but also the horizontal span of possible wall collapse. 30. A collapse danger zone for an aerial stream will vary from that established for ground stream operations. An aerial stream operated from a tower ladder or aerial ladder should be positioned away from an unstable wall at a distance equal to the height of the wall above the nozzle tip. 31. Establishing a collapse zone for tall structures could require firefighters to be positioned beyond the reach of hose streams. In this case a \"flanking\" position is called for: The master streams must be placed in front of the adjoining buildings or at corner-safe areas of the fire ground. The master stream range and effectiveness will be reduced but the life safety of the firefighters will be ensured even if the unstable wall falls outward.

GENERAL FIRE SUBJECTS Fire Brigade Mandatory Training – Version 1.0 August 2012 Training Course Provided by the Pre-Fire Planning, Training and Community Relations Section (PFPT-CRS), Zamboanga City Fire District (ZCFD), Bureau of Fire Protection – 9 (BFP-9) Page 26 of 30 32. There are four so called “safe areas” in which to park vehicles and operate master streams at when there is a danger of a church roof collapse. These four corner-safe areas give firefighters the greatest probability of survival if the walls start collapsing. If all of the walls collapsed outward simultaneously (however unlikely), only these four areas would be safe from falling debris. Warning, if the corners of the building appear unstable stay out of that corner area. 33. After a fire has been extinguished and before overhauling begins, three safety actions should be ordered by the officer in command: Fresh air should be pumped into the hot, smokefilled area by fans or the ventilation system; portable lights should be set up to improve visibility; and a safety survey of the structure and contents should be under-taken, checking especially for collapse hazards, hazardous materials The utilities gas and electricity should be shut off before opening up walls and ceiling during overhauling. 34. Firefighters ordered to shut off utility control valves for gas or electric power must consider the possibility of carbon monoxide and smoke accumulation in the cellar, particularly when a fire of long duration has been extinguished in a first floor store directly above the cellar and the cellar is completely below grade and without windows. Self-contained breathing apparatus must be worn in the cellar. 35. The firefighter's best protection against injury and death by a fall during overhauling is a properly charged flash-light. No firefighter should respond to a fire without a personal light. 36. The most potentially, dangerous area of local floor collapse inside a burned out residence building is the bathroom. The weight of a firefighter is enough to trigger the collapse of a fire damaged bathroom floor. 37. If flames are discovered still burning at a gas meter or broken pipe after a fire has been knocked down, do not extinguish the flame. Let the fire burn, protect the exposures with a hose stream, and alert command that the gas has to be shut off at the cellar or street control valve. 38. Full protective clothing-including mask face piece must be in place before a firefighter approaches a 20-pound propane cylinder to shut off the control valve when a small flame is burning at an outlet. There is a danger of the relief valve suddenly activating, creating a fireball that could engulf the firefighter. 39. To protect a propane cylinder from exposure to a nearby fire, direct the hose stream to the top portion of the tank. This top portion of the tank contains vapor; it is in this vapor space that most propane cylinders BLEVE due to heat from an exposure fire. 40. When a propane cylinder is discovered burning around the cylinder valve, employ the following tactics: Cool the vapor space. After the area is cooled with water for 10 minutes and the flames appear stabilized in size and intensity, approach the valve in full protective equipment and mask and shut off the gas by the control valve if possible. If the flow of burning gas can't be shut off, allow the propane cylinder to burn itself out and use the hose stream to protect the exposure. 41. The firefighter shutting off the flow of burning gas at the propane cylinder outlet should be protected by a wide-pattern, low-velocity stream; position the fog stream between the control valve and the BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION\n\n38.

The fire-fighter's hand should be behind the fog curtain when turning the control valve. The flaming outlet should be in front of the fog curtain. 42. If you are in doubt about how to control a fire involving a propane cylinder, move all civilians and firefighters to a safe distance beyond the explosion danger zone get behind a barrier, and let it burn. 43. When walking on a peaked roof, straddle or stay near the ridge rafter. If you slip or lose your balance you can grab on to the roof peak; the ridge of the roof is your one true handhold. Chimneys, T.V. antennas, and soil pipes are not designed to support a falling firefighter and may break. 44. To maintain footing when walking on a peaked-roof surface, bend your legs at the knees and walk flat-footed. This is called the \"roofers walk.\" It will reduce your chances of sliding down a peaked roof. 45. When there is -a danger of peaked-roof deck burn-through or collapse due to an attic fire, place a roof ladder on the sloping side of the roof from which you're operating and walk on the rungs of the ladder. The ladder should be supported by the roof ridge and the bearing walls of the house. 46. Roof operations should be conducted from an aerial ladder or aerial platform when peaked roof beams are in danger of collapse due to fire destruction of the attic. The firefighters should be independently supported. 47. Firefighters should not walk on a peaked roof with a slope greater than a 30-degree angle from the horizontal. There should be a roof ladder in place. 48. To reduce your chances of being severely injured by flashover during a search, practice a safe, organized search method. Most firefighters killed by flash-over are disoriented and lost in smoke. When searching a small room, maintain contact with a wall and move in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. In a large or complex area, use a search rope as a guide. Study the room lay-outs of buildings in your community. This will help you to search and not become disoriented. 49. With the increasing use of lexan windows, sliding scissor agates, and bars on windows, firefighters searching for the location of the blaze or for victims should always return to the entrance door. If a firefighter passes the fire and carries a victim to a fire escape window, they could both be trapped. Crime, or the fear of it, moves many residents to lock up the second exit. 50. Firefighters should know the warning signs of flashover. When smoke and superheated gases force you to crouch down below half the height of the room, there's danger of flashover. Rollover is also a sign of possible flashover. Roll over is when flashes of flame, mixed with smoke, are seen at the upper part of a burning room or at the top of a door or window flowing out of the opening. When you suspect flashover, withdraw to safety. 51. Firefighters should know why the flashover phenomenon has become more common in recent times: BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION\n\n39. GENERAL FIRE SUBJECTS Fire Brigade Mandatory Training – Version 1.0 August 2012 Training Course Provided by the Pre-Fire Planning, Training and Community Relations Section (PFPT-CRS), Zamboanga City Fire District (ZCFD), Bureau of Fire Protection – 9 (BFP-9) Page 28 of 30 • Because of the use of smoke detectors, firefighters are arriving at the scene earlier in the growth process of the fire, frequently before flashover. • The synthetic furnishings of a typical home are petrochemical derivatives that accelerate flashover by liberating greater amounts of heat and flammable gases.3. Improved quality of protective gear and equipment has allowed firefighters to enter farther into superheated atmospheres prior to flashover. Tight building syndrome -thermal windows and energy-efficient heat barriers behind walls and ceilings of rooms keep more heat in the confined space of the room. 52. When operating around the perimeter of a burning building, an outside venting firefighter must take precautions to avoid injury from falling objects. When you hear glass breaking, don’t look up. Size up the venting assignment from a distance. Choose the window you want to vent, move in close, vent it, and back away from the structure. 53. To determine the proper angle for placing a ground ladder, stand erect at the base of the ladder with your boots against the ladder beams and your out-stretched arms grasping the rungs at shoulder level. If you can do this, the ladder is at the proper climbing angle. 54. When you cannot open a window manually to vent smoke from a building and must break the glass, stand to one side (if possible, the windward side), use a six-or eight-foot pike pole for safe reach, strike the glass with the pike pole at the top area of the window, and work downward. If there is a possibility that firefighters are searching inside the room, first tap the window and only break a small portion of the glass-this will serve as a warning. Then remove the entire window with the tool. Keep helmet eye shields down for protection, wear gloves to protect your hands, and don't stand in front of the window. 55. After flashover occurs inside a superheated, smoke-filled room, there is a point of no return beyond which a firefighter cannot escape back to safety. The point of no return, or maximum distance a firefighter can crawl inside a superheated room and be sure you can still get back out alive and not badly burned after flashover, is five feet. If you are five feet inside a room that has flashed over (walking 2 ½ feet per second) it takes you 2 seconds to get out. During this time you are engulfed in 1000 to 1200 degrees F. heat. If you are 10 feet inside and flashover occurs you are exposed to 1000-1200 degrees F. for 4our seconds. 15 feet you are exposed for 6 seconds and badly burned even with protective clothing. Think about it! 56. When moving through brush during a fire, the firefighter should raise a tool or arm in front of his face as he moves forward to avoid injury by shrubbery, pointed needles, sharp leaves, or abrasive vines. Firefighters walking behind the lead firefighter should space themselves several feet apart to avoid whipping branches or leaves. 57. You should never enter cattails or brush that is over your head and reduces your vision. If the wind changes, you are in danger of being engulfed by fire in the brush. 58. When the wind frequently changes direction during a brushfire operation, the safest area from which to attack the fire is the blackened, burned-out area.

A survey revealed that firefighters are most often killed and injured at small brushfires in isolated portions of larger fires. They are not killed by large timberland forest fires. Firefighters are burned to death trying to outrun brush fires, or they are engulfed in flames when a brushfire suddenly flares up around them. Firefighters should attack a brushfire from the flanks-the sides of the fire area between the head, the edge along which the fire is advancing, and the rear. 60. The three most common injuries to firefighters during brush firefighting are eye injuries, falls, and heat exhaustion. Eye shields must be worn. Firefighters should walk on roads or well-traveled paths when possible. BUREAU OF FIRE PROTECTION REGION 1 PROVINCE OF LA UNION SAN JUAN FIRE STATION\n\n41.
