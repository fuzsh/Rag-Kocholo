        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. â Firefighters across the U.S. are sounding the alarm.\n\nThe Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed new rules to protect emergency responders. Some firefighters said the new standards could become an economic burden for volunteer fire departments who may already face challenges.\n\nOSHAâs proposed Emergency Response Standard Plan could replace its current fire brigade standards.\n\nOSHA proposed the change because the current rules were made decades ago and do not reflect the hazards responders are currently facing.\n\nThe National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC) said OSHAâs proposed emergency response standard plan could be an economic challenge for some volunteer fire departments.\n\nâThese are accompanied by, you know, cost burdens, staff burdens, all, you know, different kind of resources that are going to be need to be dedicated to do so,â said Ryan Woodward Chief of legislative and regulatory affairs for the National Volunteer Fire Council.\n\nZoneton Fire Departmentâs chief said they are already facing financial challenges.\n\nâRight now, with the way things are, everythingâs starting to tax fire departments and youâre starting to see volunteer fire departments that are not being able to do the job,â said Zoneton Fire Department Chief Kevin Moulton.\n\nOSHAâs proposal will make 22 National Fire Protection Association suggested standards into required standards. This includes certifications for firefighters as well as design and certification requirements for protective equipment. Zoneton Fire Department already follows some of these rules.\n\nâWeâre limited on how much or how long we can keep our equipment, you know, or fire gear per NFPA is only good for ten years,â said Moulton.\n\nThe plan will make it harder to recruit new volunteers because of new requirements and barriers to entry, according to the National Volunteer Fire Council.\n\nThe U.S. Fire Administration said 90.2% of Kentucky fire departments are run by volunteers or mostly volunteers.\n\nâVolunteers, with them having to work two, three jobs, all the child care stuff, the events families do and children doâ¦weâre starting to see a decline in volunteers,â said Moulton.\n\nThe current fire brigade standard was implemented in 1980 and has not been updated since.\n\nOSHA is accepting public comments on the proposal until June 21, 2024."
