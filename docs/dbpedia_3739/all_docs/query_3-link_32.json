        "text": "\"Firestation 32\" is the first story that is featured in the second episode of Season 2.\n\nPlot[]\n\nStevie Hanson wants nothing more than to grow up to be a firefighter, and so spends most of his free time hanging out with the firemen of Firestation 32. One of the firemen, Roger Parks, is unable to have a child of his own, and has come to see Stevie as a kind of surrogate son. After Firestation 32 throws him a birthday party, Stevie heads for home, but on his way there, he notices a house that has caught on fire. Stevie rushes into the house to try and help its occupants, but a few minutes later he returns to Firestation 32, covered in soot and frantically warning Roger about the house fire.\n\nRoger accompanies Stevie to the burning house, and has Stevie help him douse it with a hose as they wait for backup. The rest of the firemen from Firestation 32 arrive, and successfully put out the fire and save the house's occupants. Roger thanks and congratulates Stevie for his help, and calls him a true firefighter and hero. Roger is called away from Stevie by his fellow firefighters, who have just hauled a corpse out of the burnt house. The body turns out to be Stevie, who shows signs of having died of smoke inhalation. A bewildered Roger looks back at where he just left Stevie, and notices that the boy has vanished. Stevie is revealed to have died when he first entered the burning house, but his spirit was able to save everyone else in the building by bringing Roger and the rest of the men from Firestation 32 to it.\n\nCast[]"
