        "text": "February 18, 2020\n\nVery good nonfiction book about a despicable man, John Orr. A man who sets fires. A serial arsonist. On the 10th of October 1984 in South Pasadena, California USA this man set a fire in a retail store, during business hours, that killed innocent men, women, and children. Thankfully, he was caught. I could go into a lot of detail, but I won't. I'll let you read it all for yourself.\n\nI found this book to be a real page-turner. Even the pages relating to the trial evidence were masterfully handled by the author, Joseph Wambaugh, to keep the reader interested ... which isn't always the case, unfortunately.\n\n4 Stars = It touched my heart, and/or gave me much food for thought.\n\nMarch 27, 2017\n\nI found the first two thirds of this true crime story to be a page turner. I’ve never read a true crime book about a serial arsonist, let alone a serial arsonist who is the lead arson investigator for the Glendale Fire Department in Southern California —possibly the most prolific arsonist of all time. He wrote numerous articles about arson investigation and taught classes and was widely considered an expert. I’ve read news stories about volunteer firefighters starting forest fires in part to create work for themselves during the summer months, but this story was intriguing.\n\nI already knew how difficult it is to prove arson and to link that arson to a specific person, but all the courtroom stuff grew a little tedious. It was interesting that Wambaugh for the most part took an impartial journalistic view of imparting the details that were uncovered and then every now and then he’d inject his opinion on which lawyer did a good job with his or her argument or a bad one.\n\nIt was also frustrating that John Orr refuses to accept guilt for any of it. What helped the lawyers for his case was a novel he wrote called Point of Origin, which was later made into a movie starring Ray Liotta. The story is about two firefighters, a good one and one an arsonist. If Orr would accept blame, psychologists and others would be able to study the mind of a serial arsonist and possibly gain insights as to the triggers (and possible treatment).\n\nI was interested in this book because I’m interested in firefighters’ jobs in general, but I felt Wambaugh was only able to guess at what made Orr do the things he did, both with the women in his life and with his career. If you’re interested in this type of true crime, you’d like it; otherwise, I’d find another book to spend your time on.\n\nFor more of my reviews, please visit: http://theresaalan.net/blog\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nWell you can tell this all happened before life with the net. I have never heard of the horrific tale of John Orr. It read like a Mickey Haller tale or a John Grisham law story. The Joseph Wambaugh humor is missing but then there is nothing humorous about this factual book. I am glad I read this book.\n\nJune 10, 2012\n\nAn interesting story about a Californian fire investigator who was also a prolific serial arsonist. The book looks at the background of the arsonist, the investigation and the court case in about equal measures. While the story itself was interesting I didn't find it particularly well told. It was mostly told from a slightly distant journalistic point of view but every now and again the author would interject with a sarcastic comment, jibe or observation that felt jarring in the context. There was little real analysis of the psychology of serial arsonists and the author relied almost entirely on the court proceedings to speak for themselves. I'm glad I read it, but I thought it could have been better written.\n\nSeptember 5, 2018\n\nThis book feels like jury duty. The true-crime case study follows Southern California’s 80’s and 90’s serial arsonist John Orr. It’s a compelling story but the book gets bogged down in detail. Orr’s background and the case’s overview take up the first 40% of the book. This is good material and well-written. From this point though, the book slides and becomes one long court case. The story, once intense and provocative, becomes mired in monotony. By the end I felt exhausted, sort of like I had read every word of my home insurance policy.\n\nMarch 18, 2017\n\nUnlike most post-WWII American true crime writers, Joseph Wambaugh has a prose style. It's a breezy, Chandleresque, tough-guy style: he uses slang, obscenities, metaphors for crying out loud. As an example, here's a paragraph about Ted Bundy:\n\nAll death-penalty lawyers remembered the time when America's most notorious violent serial offender, Ted Bundy, had wanted to do some life-and-death trading. After he'd had such a great time representing himself at his trial, giving interviews and fielding marriage proposals, it all had stopped. When he was just days away from his appointment with the Florida electric chair, he offered to locate his victims' bodies if the governor of Florida would commute his death sentence to life without parole. But the authorities told him, in effect, Too late, Ted. You got a date with Ol' Sparky, and Satan is waiting for his number-one draft pick.\n\n(259-60)\n\nSo Wambaugh is an unfailingly entertaining writer, and he does a good job of conveying the black humor of law enforcement (not surprisingly, since he was a detective sergeant for the LAPD). He's maybe the only writer I've encountered who can show that humor well enough for a reader to share it. (Rule tries, occasionally, but it always falls flat and awkward.) And he's very good at tracking what he calls the balkanization of American law enforcement--the way that neighboring jurisdictions see themselves as being in competition rather than cooperation and sneer at each other like rival high schools. And he's absolutely willing to wade in and call people out on their mistakes and bad judgment. His heroes in this book are two firefighter/arson investigators: Marvin Casey, who had this serial arson case solved in 1987, four years and scores, if not hundreds, of fires before John Orr was finally arrested in 1991, but couldn't get anyone to listen to him because he was accusing an arson investigator (and because the fingerprint examiner made an indefensible blunder), and Steve Patterson who insisted in the face of cynical, condescending derision from cops that a cold case victim deserved to have them expend their precious time trying to solve her murder.\n\nI appreciate Wambaugh's humor and his chutzpah. But everything has the defects of its virtues, and Wambaugh can get grating. I found this particularly true during the lengthy coverage of Orr's lengthy trials (more than 200 pages, so basically half the book) as Wambaugh caromed from patronizing the jury(/ies) to making catty comments about the prosecutors to taking potshots at the defense lawyers (and always just a little contemptuous of John Orr--and on that I'm in agreement with him). He is capable of respect for his subjects, but he doles it out sparingly: the fingerprint expert who cowboys up and admits his egregious mistake under oath in open court, and the people who testified in the penalty phase of John Orr's trial for murder about the loss of their loved ones in the Ole's Home Center fire in 1984 (that's the fire I've tagged this book with, because it is--astonishingly--the only time John Orr's fires actually succeeded in killing anyone).\n\nJohn Orr is considered one of the worst--if not the worst (the other contender being Thomas Sweatt)--serial arsonists of the twentieth century. One of the ATF agents who investigated him thinks that Orr set more than 2,000 fires between 1984 and 1991. Orr used his training in arson investigation to commit arson, and he used his credentials as a deeply respected arson investigator to cover for his crimes. John Orr, first on the scene? Well, that's just how dedicated he is to his job. His novel/memoir, Points of Origin (Orr claims it's fact-based fiction; prosecutors claim it's a very thinly veiled record of his crimes) and his attempts to publish it make it clear just how willing Orr was to trade on his arson to get what he wanted. I'm with Joseph Wambaugh; this man deserves nothing but contempt. The more you point to his dedication as an arson investigator and the number of cases his solved and the number of investigators he trained, the worse his crimes look. As usual I'm conflicted about the death penalty, but I'm certainly glad that Orr got life without parole. He is not a person who either deserves or can be trusted with freedom.\n\nJune 17, 2014\n\nSurreal.\n\n“Fire Lover” is a true crime recounting of one of the most notorious arsonists in Los Angeles history.\n\nAn arsonist who just happened to be a firefighter and arson investigator.\n\nThe details are gripping and so is the pursuit of John Orr by investigators—proving patterns, connecting one critical fingerprints, lining up eyewitnesses, seeing the big picture. That is, when they aren’t stumbling around or failing at some basic investigative processes.\n\nAs others have noted, there isn’t much suspense. But “Fire Lover” is worth reading, for no other reason than to digest a gritty portrait of a deeply troubled individual whose issues with women, authority, self-respect and self-esteem are complex, layered and disturbing. Orr, whose crimes were committed decades ago, turned personal slights into terror.\n\n“Fire Lover” is also about the slow wheels of bureaucracy and the methodical means of the criminal justice system and Wambaugh brings plenty of edge to writing about both, particularly when the cops and investigators fail.\n\nWambaugh’s colorful prose style keeps the sordid tale moving. His descriptions are over the top, at times, and hilarious in a tabloid kind of way. This book was first published in 2002 and I don't know if Wambaugh has changed his style since then, but a highlighter marking the purple prose might be dry by book’s end.\n\nA member of the L.A. Arson Task Force has hair “so coiffed it’d stay in place till Christ came back.” Wambaugh jumps into collective consciousness when it’s convenient: “The judge gave the obligatory admonishment about not reading any news articles or listening to any radio or TV reports about the case, and everyone thought, Fat Chance.”\n\nOr: “So after goosing the jurors with a cattle prod, he’d gone back to smacking them with a pig bladder.”\n\nAt times, Wambaugh stretches to near cartoon levels. A firefighter’s “neck hair was putting out enough electricity to light up Burbank.”\n\nDespite the excessive and decidedly non-journalistic flair, the core of the story is a compelling portrait of a dark man who recklessly torched property, homes and businesses with supremely casual disregard for human life.\n\nIn a way, it’s too bad such a big name as Wambaugh had to write the book because that fact alone probably made Orr happy—and the guy, still serving a life sentence with no possibility of parole, deserves nothing of the sort.\n\nOctober 14, 2016\n\nJohn Orr was a fire fighter that wanted to become a cop. The psychological test weeded him out; his personality wasn’t stable enough for a guy that carries a gun for a living, and they turned him down. Over the years, however, he became not only a fire chief, but a highly respected arson investigator, and took tremendous pride in the fact that he was part of the law enforcement community. However, occasional snubs from that group made him livid, and he dealt with his rage in the most horrific manner imaginable: he became the most prolific arsonist in California history. Joseph Wambaugh captures this true crime story in electrifying detail. I received my copy from Open Road Media and Net Galley in exchange for an honest review, but you can get your copy Tuesday, October 18, 2016 when it is digitally released.\n\nIt starts with the Ole Hardware Store fire. Ole is a family owned business, but it is large in scale, the size of a big box store, and four people die there. Wambaugh provides personal, poignant details of those that perish, and I appreciate this. The white Volkswagen is particularly moving.\n\nOrr doesn’t see it as poignant or tragic, however; he is enraged at the cops and insurance investigators for calling it an accident, and in order to achieve recognition for his twisted projects, he sets more fires. More. And still more. And as the fires increase, the budget, which had been going to be cut, isn’t cut after all, and Orr has all the work he can handle and more, because he is investigating his own crimes. Time and time again, he is seen at the sites of fires doing uncharacteristic things, or before an alarm has yet been sounded, but no one is ready to suggest that he is the party responsible until it is screamingly obvious.\n\nThe author is tremendously skilled at shifting the mood from the somber, to the ironic, to the occasional moment that is genuinely comical, without ever missing a beat, setting an inappropriate tone, or dropping his documentation, which is meticulous and must have taken a lot of years to compile. I usually am not fond of true crime stories because I know I may not like the ending; the author can’t choose how it comes out if his story is true. But this one drew me like a moth, and I had to get a closer look.\n\nWambaugh chronicles Orr’s life as well as the arsons, investigations, and then the trials that follow, and he does it brilliantly. He received an Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime, and it was an honor he earned.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nNovember 12, 2017\n\nWambaugh takes on the story of John Orr, an arson investigator and fire department captain in California who is a serial arsonist. Orr is also a murderer since five people, including a small child, died in one of his fires. I had seen a documentary about Orr several years ago and thought that I might want to revisit this fascinating story.\n\nThe book begins with the retail store fire in which the deaths occurred which initially is deemed accidental. When fire investigator Orr arrives on the scene he argues that it is arson and finds a delayed incendiary device to prove it. As we discover as the story progresses, he wants credit for the fires, delighting in the fact that he is an insider who no one would ever suspect.\n\nThe first half of the book is fascinating but stalls in the second half which is dedicated to Orr's trial. It appears that Wambaugh practically repeated the entire transcript with endless testimony of hundreds of witnesses and scads of technical information. There is just too much information which slows down the pace of the story.\n\nI found it interesting that Wambaugh, a former police officer, attacks the police and the justice system in general with a vengeance........his biases are very evident which don't seem appropriate to the straightforward telling of true story. Regardless, his description of a very complex and disturbed man is well done and the book is worth a read when you have nothing else on your tbr list.\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\nSerial arsonists and pyromaniacs are a strange, uncommon sort of criminal, but the impact they have on their communities can be devastating. One of the worst was the so-called Pillow Pyro, whose day job was being an arson investigator.\n\nThis a fast-paced, surprisingly funny book - the author used to be a police officer in California himself and is familiar with the often absurd vagaries of that state's courts. And this case is really such an odd one, with that strange premise of an arson investigator investigating his own crimes as an arsonist. However, I did think the courtroom section got too long-winded - even with the author's tongue-in-cheek attitude toward it, I feel that we could have cut down on sections which extensively quoted the lawyers.\n\nOctober 21, 2009\n\nTwo or three times a year I temporarily lose my memory and let my perennial fascination with profiling steer me down the dark, dark road of true crime. It's amazing that I can forget how [exploitative of violence/sexist/racist/judgmental/badly written:] [delete as applicable:] true crime can be, but two or three times a year I'm like oh my God, WTF, what am I doing.\n\nThis one wasn't that bad – it was just kind of boring, with a few off-tone rants about the propensity evidence rules in criminal trials, which, granted, look utterly insane to a non-lawyer. (And, uh, you know, to some of us lawyers too). Not an ounce of interesting psychological analysis to be found, except of the shallow/reductionist variety, surprise surprise.\n\nRight, now I'm good for the next six months, hopefully.\n\nMarch 29, 2020\n\nVery well told the true story about a psychopath and a monster, really, who abused his profession to create chaos I So. Cal. Put him away for life.\n\nMarch 30, 2020\n\nAfter finishing The Immune series I was struggling for a bit what to read next.Tried some books but did not enjoy them but thankfully I tried this book and am very much enjoying it.\n\nLove the sarcasm and I just want the coward Sick narcissist to be caught.\n\nOff to read more..\n\nFinished a few days ago and wish i had written a review immediately afterwards but i did not. sigh.\n\nAnyway.What a great writer. Did you know he made me laugh out loud while reading in bed one night with tears in my eyes because my cat was getting annoyed. She was lying on my stomach and did not appreciate my belly moving from all the laughter-\n\nI did highlight it on my kindle but will type it to add it to my review.\n\nStefan Stein (The prosecutor) got something with which to bust Matassa's (cop) chops when they took a trip to the Central Valley and Central Coast to re-interview witnesses.\n\nOn the way to Atascadero they were stopped for speeding by a CHiP officer. In the front seat were Matassa and Lucero. In the back were Stefan Stein and Walt Brown.\n\nWhen the CHip approached the car ,Matassa and Lucero showed their hands and Matassa said, \"We're cops and we're packing.\"\n\nThe CHip Officer stuck his face in the car window and said, \"Yeah?So what.\"\n\nFor months thereafter,whenever he was called The Mole by Matassa, Stein would throw up his hands,and cry out in falsetto: We got guns! We got guns! And then in the deepest bass he could manage,reply, \"Yeah? So what,asshole!\n\nI could so picture this. Loved the writing style, the sarcasm that was shown at times.\n\nDecember 27, 2020\n\nI'd heard about this case, so it was interesting to get insight about the crime, the investigation and the trial. Wambaugh goes into a lot of detail, I might say too much detail, but it seems like an effort to be fair and thorough. I felt satisfied to learn so much about what was very likely the worst modern day serial arsonist and what it took to being him to justice. 3 and a half stars\n\nAugust 5, 2024\n\nThis tells the story of John Orr, a California firefighter who was an arsonist. Fully 60% of the book is the trial. It was a very long trial. And it got super technical, which I didn't enjoy. He's still alive, still in prison, and he wrote a book about which the prosecutors say is basically his fictionalized diary. I don't have any desire to read it.\n\nMay 26, 2018\n\nFirst half was interesting, the investigation was quite good - the best bit, but the court case was a bit boring and the author Joseph Wambaugh knew this and did a clever work of making it light and humorous.\n\nThis is a book to read cover to cover quickly, don't do what I did and take a holiday half way through. I found I was forgetting certain bits in the first half.\n\nAlso, sadly (and aggravating for me) is an unsolved case of a rape-murder of a young mother. If I'd know that before hand then I'd have skipped the book. Once again a need for warnings on books just like movies. Heck call them trigger warnings if you have to but I absolutely detest reading about any cruelty and violence, call me a snowflake if it makes you feel better, but I'll have no qualms punching you in the guts just to show my wish to not read about it doesn't mean I'm a pushover and refrain from force myself for self-defence and not impartial to using my masculinity against you *BIG CHEESY GRIN*. Not triggered, just disgusted by it and find people that can happily read about that stuff to be ghoulish cretins. *grins* Anyhoo. The arsonist wasn't forensically linked to the case in the end. So all that for nothin'!\n\nThe arsonist is certainly on the bad personalities spectrum. After reading about what a creep this slimeball was I was hoping the death penalty was given but it wasn't. Sucks.\n\nAnd I'm against capital punishment. So consider yourself warned.\n\nOctober 21, 2009\n\n“Fire Lover” is the true story of John Orr, an arson investigator of the Glendale Fire Department in California. Throughout the book, there are a string of fires that are being set in stores during business hours, all using the same method. As the story progresses, the state's main suspect becomes John Orr due his suspicious writing of a \"fact-based novel\" about a serial arsonist who turns out to be a firefighter, and in it Orr revealed certain facts about the unsolved arson case that he couldn't have known through his work.\n\nThis book is very effective and keeps the reader involved and wanting to read more. One is constantly asking the question, “did the dedicated firefighter and arson investigator really set all 2,000 of those fires causing millions in property damage and taking multiple lives in the process?” As the jury examines the evidence and the motives, so does the reader. You are shown all of the evidence that points towards John Orr, but at the same time, you remember everything he has done that make it impossible for him to have committed these arsons. Joseph Wambaugh's accounts of the events in this book are so realistic and descriptive that you feel like you are actually there, going through the triumphs and troubles of Orr's life with him as well as witnessing every single fire that took place. Wambaugh has a very strong presence of voice throughout and his word choice really brings the book alive and unified.\n\n“Fire Lover” would appeal to anybody who enjoys true stories that include very detailed descriptions and facts. It would also appeal to those who are interested or involved in crime investigation, law enforcement, and/or the fire department. I highly recommend this book to all, even if you do not fall under the previous criteria. “Fire Lover” is exciting, engaging, well written, factual, and an all around “good read.” After reading this book, I will be sure to take notice of all exits when I enter a store during business hours.\n\nMarch 7, 2018\n\nA. This book was absolute garbage. I think it’s summed up perfectly by a previous reviewer: “Interesting subject matter. Terribly written”\n\nA full third of this book was directly quoted from the court transcripts. Not just the interesting bits, but all the boring, unnecessary shit in between as well.\n\nWho was this book for? The author wrote it directly speaking to the old firefighter/policeman boys club. It’s like he recorded conversations in a locker room!\n\nBoth racism (“There are more Pakis in a 711 than in Islamabad” - this wasn’t even in reference to a relevant point in the book, just there randomly. “He must have started praying to Fatima or whoever Portuguese boys pray to when they’re in big trouble” - do some fucking research!!) and sexism (reducing an evening news anchor to “the girl with the big tits that reads the news at night”, and talking about police officer on duty stopping to take pictures of “sweaty chicks at the beach”) abound. I had to check the publication date to see if this was just old-fashioned cavemanism, but this was written in 2002! Way too recent for this kind of shit!\n\nApril 20, 2018\n\nTrue story of John Leonard Orr, a serial arsonist who is believed to have started more than 2000 fires leaving victims and damage. The really sad thing is that John Orr was a fire fighter who was supposed to save lives. This book is written with lots of detail and lots of characters so you have to pay attention. Some of the crimes are horrific so not easy to get through. This story also covers the bureaucracy of fire enforcement and law enforcement and the friction between the two. The discord enabled the arsonist to continue. The book ends with the trials that convict John Orr and put him in prison, never admitting to any of the crimes.\n\nMay 22, 2017\n\nSo I enjoyed the first 100 pages or so of this book. After that it quickly spiraled downhill into a sea of cringe-worthy metaphors, see \"getting his mongoose milked,\" and the most dull, uninspired reporting of court room drama that I have ever read. Unfortunately I am one of those people who forced myself to finish a book once I start it, so I trudged through the next 200 pages in agony, just wanting it to be over. Just don't read it. You'll regret it.\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nThe first half of this book is pretty gripping. What John Orr did is crazy and even crazier is how he was able to get away with what he was doing AND how he was able to woo every other woman he ever met! So weird! Unfortunately a huge part of the book is about the trial, which was incredibly dull. There's also a Forensic Files episode on Orr, titled Point of Origin, which recaps the case very succinctly.\n\nJanuary 13, 2019\n\nInteresting\n\nI had never heard of this case before, so it was interesting to read about. Considering what an odd duck John Orr was and how he was seen by those around him, I was surprised to find that it took them so long to catch him.\n\nDecember 22, 2023\n\nThe story itself is great and it’s wild to hear about John Orr and who he was. However, the writing is terrible. Never read this author before and he’s not someone I’ll be inclined to read again.\n\nOctober 7, 2019\n\nWambaugh delivers as usual. Very well written narrative of the hunt for and court proceedings of a serial arsonist. Interesting read...\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\nThe fire stuff was interesting and fast paced. The tedium of lawyer-speak and trial coverage was not so much. Made me appreciate my life choices (don’t be a lawyer).\n\nDecember 27, 2019\n\nThis is a true-crime story about an arsonist in the greater Los Angeles area in the early 1990's. John Orr was a firefighter who was promoted to arson investigator and claimed to have caught a number of arsonists in the Los Angeles area. It was thought at first to be a strange coincidence that he was one of the first people to arrive at a fire scene, ready to watch and photograph the fire. In one hardware store fire, four or five people were killed. It took the combined efforts of ATF, FBI and LA county police and firefighters to bring Orr to account for the fires he started.\n\nThis is the first book of Mr. Wambaugh's that I have read. It will also be the last, unfortunately. I did have two other true crime books of his on my TBR list but after reading this, I won't be indulging. The author is supposed to be an invisible presence in his or her written works, presenting the facts and the story and leaving his opinion by the wayside. That was not the case with this book. There were a couple of statements that the author made which pulled me out of the story and had me wondering \"is that racist, or am I just being overly sensitive?\" He also made references to things like the Oliver Stone film, JFK, that readers younger than a certain age are liable to miss. I would not expect my children to catch a reference to a film from the 1990's that has nothing to do with the actual story. Yet he referenced JFK at least five times in this book. At another point the author was being boorish towards courtroom observers with no good reason to. It all just really grated on my nerves. And I started to skim after a while because I was \"done\" reading it and just wanted to know the outcome of things.\n\nHaving said that, I don't have too much argument with the mechanics of the book. The plot is pretty straight-forward; most of the book is spent discussing legal maneuvering and courtroom scenes . The main character is not really a likable character though there's not really a lot of character development. The setting is California in the 1990's. There is some violence related to fires scattered throughout. Some alcohol use. There are some sex scenes throughout. Some adult language. This is not a book for teenagers. I am giving this book two stars for reasons I have listed above. Honestly is better to read the Wikipedia entry on this one.\n\nOctober 27, 2016\n\nJoseph Wambaugh is a great writer of both fiction and non-fiction but this is not one of his better efforts. While the subject is interesting and thought provoking the book ends up being overlong and somewhat tedious. Part of this is due to the overly detailed descriptions of courtroom maneuvering and legal wrangling involved in the prosecution of arsonist John Leonard Orr.\n\nOrr, described as \"probably the most prolific American arsonist of the twentieth century\", was a highly respected firefighter and arson investigator with the Glendale, California Fire Department. He was accused (and convicted) of starting a multitude of fires and causing the deaths of at least four people. About half of this book is dedicated to the complicated process of bringing the case to trial, and the resulting trial proceedings. Even the author notes, on more than one occasion, that the whole legal process was exhausting and overlong.\n\nAdd the inclusion of some complicated technical testimonials from expert witnesses and it makes for some confusing and, frankly, dull reading. I can't really recommend this book.\n\nThe book contains sexual references and adult language.\n\nI received a free review copy of this book compliments of the publisher through NetGalley."
