        "text": "A fire service is hiring full-time firefighters for the first time in five years.\n\nCurrent members of the County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service (CDDFRS) said they were looking for people who were \"dedicated\" and had \"personal resilience\".\n\nCDDFRS is hosting taster sessions over the next month to give people a better understanding of the job.\n\nLindsay Blake has been with the fire service for 15 years and said \"the fire service can be anything you want it to be\".\n\nNow a crew manager, she said it was the variety of a firefighting role that first attracted her.\n\n\"I wanted a job where I could be active, but I also wanted a job that was rewarding, and that I could give back to the community.\n\n\"One minute you might be assisting someone on what might be the worst day of their life, the next you could be at a school visit inspiring the next generation of firefighters.\"\n\nBut she said it was not all kicking in blazing doors and saving cats in trees.\n\n\"We will always be able to help with those things, however there's a lot more community fire safety focus now, and helping the vulnerable in the community,\" she said.\n\nLindsay stressed that as long as applicants \"know how to deal with a difficult situation\" and are \"kind and caring\", the fire service will be able to give people \"the training and skills to make an effective firefighter\".\n\nApplications close on 12 April."
