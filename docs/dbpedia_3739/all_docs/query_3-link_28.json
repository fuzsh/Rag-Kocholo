        "text": "AA degree-seeking students choose 9 credits (three courses) with at least one course from each list. AFA degree-seeking students must select at least one course from the humanities area. AS degree-seeking students choose 6 credits (two courses) with at least one course from each list. AAS degree-seeking students desiring a humanities or fine arts course may choose any course from either list. This course is intended for students who plan to continue their college mathematics education or to meet college transfer requirements. It is the study and analysis of the sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent function; show these functions are used to solve many types of problems involving the sides and angles of triangles; and how these functions are used to solve many types of problems involving cyclic patterns, some that vary with time. Topics include definitions, properties and manipulation of trigonometric functions; applications of trigonometric functions; analytic trigonometry; trigonometric form of complex numbers; and polar coordinates, equations and graphs. This course is designed to teach the student the basics of water supply, through hydrants, drafting and water shuttles. It is important for fire companies to be able to obtain water from sources other than hydrants at the fireground, and operate a tanker shuttle to provide adequate water supply for firefighting operations. This skill is not limited to rural applications, and may be necessary to supplement hydranted areas where there is inadequate water supply. This course begins to cover the development of the knowledge needed by the firefighter on the fireground with the first of three modules. It will augment and expand upon training received from the fire department at drill sessions. It is also designed to give the fundamental training necessary to the new firefighter and the student just entering fire science who has no knowledge of tools, equipment, and strategies that are essential to the profession. This course continues to cover the development of the knowledge needed by the firefighter on the fireground with the second of three modules. It will augment and expand upon training received from the fire department at drill sessions.

It is also designed to give the fundamental training necessary to the new firefighter and the student just entering fire science who has no knowledge of tools, equipment, and strategies that are essential to the profession. This course is designed for the beginning student firefighter to become familiar with the self contained breathing apparatus, which they will be using during firefighting operations. The course will educate the firefighter with the background, anatomy, operations and maintenance requirements of this tool. Being proficient with this tool could be the difference between life and death of the firefighter. Developed by fire fighters within the state of Illinois in conjunction with the Office of the State Fire Marshal following the guidelines of the OSFM and NFPA 1670. This course provides students a means to identify and properly react to uncommon, dangerous and difficult rescue situations in the following topics: structural collapse, rope rescue, confined space, vehicle and machinery, water, wilderness search and rescue, trench and excavation. Further training is required for actual rescue operations and practices. This course is designed to give fire service personnel the basic knowledge and skills to safely perform vehicle and machinery rescues as defined by NFPA 1670 (2004), Operations and Training for Technical Rescue Incidents. The course teaches the skills set forth by the Illinois Office of the State Fire Marshal. 2 lecture hours, 2 lab hours. This rope operations course has been developed by firefighters within the State of Illinois in conjunction with the Office of the State Fire Marshal. The members of the steering committee followed the guidelines of the OSFM and NFPA 1670, NFPA 1006 and NFPA 1983. This course is meant to provide the student a means in which to identify and properly react to uncommon, dangerous and difficult rescue situations in the area of rope operations. The purpose of this course is to study the chemical characteristics and reactions related to storage, transportation, and handling of hazardous materials (i.e. flammable liquids, combustible solids, oxidizing and corrosive materials, and radioactive compounds). Emphasis on emergency situations, fire fighting and control, including information on the relevant NFPA standards impacting the program (such as NFPA 471, 471 & 473) and the OSHA regulation governing our response to hazardous materials incidents (29 CFR 1910.120). An introduction to laws influencing the fire service. General areas include civil action; criminal actions; the judicial system; organization, authority and responsibility of fire service organizations; city liability for acts of the fire department personnel; municipal liability to members of the fire department; fire prevention bureau; laws and rules governing employment of fire fighters; duty owed to the public by members of the fire service; and liabilities of fire fighters. Deals with current topics in fire science not covered in other courses. Topics will vary at discretion of the instructor. No topic will be offered more than twice within three years. May be repeated three times with different topics. Topic to be listed on student's permanent academic record. The intent of this course is to introduce you to the basic and advanced concepts inherent to the First Responder Safety, Basics of Hazardous Materials Response, Incident Command System (ICS), National Incident Management System (NIMS), and Unified Command. This is not a tactics course. Its focus is not on how to manage a particular incident but rather on the usage of a command structure at any incident. Within this course, the student will participate in the \"Courage to be Safe\" program from the National Fallen Firefighters; Hazardous Materials Awareness from the University of Missouri's Fire and Rescue Institute, following NFPA 472 and OSHA's 29CFR1910.120; as well as the ICS and NIMS via the FEMA Independent Study online IS-100.b, IS-200.b, IS-700.a and IS-800.b courses. The student will have to give registration information to NFFF, MU and FEMA to access these sites. These certifications are becoming required for more of us working at some level in emergency services. Teaches the fire officer how to be more proficient in his or her work and how to use available resources. Also covers how to develop outlines, prepare classes, evaluate students and prepare tests. The student will participate in practice teaching. This course meets the guidelines of the Illinois State Fire Marshal to qualify personnel to conduct training and education courses for fire service personnel.
