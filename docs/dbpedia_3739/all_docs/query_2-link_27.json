        "text": "Effective leaders confront an important duality in their role. More than directing and pushing their team or organization forward, leaders are also responsible for navigating the course. They should ask themselves, “Do we have the right destination in mind?” and “Is there a better way to accomplish our journey?”\n\nBroad exploration of diverse ideas and the experience of others help to set a successful course for the journey. Competent leaders step out of their “comfort zone” to unveil different perspectives, new ideas and challenges to the routine. Beyond structured education and training, this exploration typically involves interaction among a collegial network or within professional associations. However, if we limit exploration to our own region, or even our own nation, we may miss invaluable opportunities.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nOver the course of my lifetime, our world has shrunk with each new development in technology and transportation. In my early fire service career, only a handful of fire service leaders ventured beyond the borders of our continent. International travel was expensive and slow, television coverage was based on film shipped via airplane, and the Internet didn’t yet exist.\n\nIn 1984, the IAFC elected Ben Vossenaar, Chief Fire Officer Rotterdam, The Netherlands, as a second vice president, and it truly felt “foreign” to me. Sure, I was part of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, but it seemed in name only.\n\nTo a great extent, international contacts remained second-hand and lacked a true one-to-one connection. However, with each passing year, we grew better acquainted, and rapidly crumbling travel barriers, on-the-spot news coverage and international ventures made everyone feel much “closer.” Additionally, as our international neighbors warmed following the end of the Cold War, fledgling efforts began to foster exchanges and connections; friendships formed and understanding grew. A true appreciation developed for the differences in philosophies, strategies and outlooks.\n\nToday’s Opportunities\n\nThe barriers to international connections and friendships have fallen. Opportunities are everywhere, and you don’t have to journey far to access them.\n\nThe United States continues to attract multiple nationalities and ethnicities into our communities; we serve those changing populations on a daily basis. Have you ventured into a local neighborhood or community group comprising people whose heritage, customs and perspectives are different from yours? Have you taken the time to bridge the challenges of speaking through an interpreter or listening to an unfamiliar accent? And when you experience some success there, are you willing to explore how they experience their community and its services, like fire protection and EMS? Most importantly, are you willing to consider some mid-course corrections in your approach to community outreach and meet these neighbors on a common ground?\n\nThe Yanks & the Brits\n\nYou can open the door to even broader international connections through membership and participation in the U.S. Branch of the Institution of Fire Engineers (IFE). Organized in 1918, the IFE is based in the United Kingdom and includes 11,000 members in 60 branches all over the world. The U.S. Branch was organized in 1996 by a small group that has grown to about 50 members today.\n\nThe U.S. Branch holds its annual meeting in conjunction with the IAFC’s Fire Rescue International (FRI) and welcomes everyone to attend. Stop in for the thought-provoking presenters or for the business of the Branch. Your involvement can open doors to making international contacts, considering different strategies and connecting you to useful electronic communications.\n\nIn a more intimate and focused setting, the U.S./U.K. Fire Service Symposium annually gathers several dozen fire service leaders from both countries. The Symposium alternates locations, meeting in the United States in even years and in the United Kingdom in odd years. Traveling to the U.K. has introduced me to rich culture and whetted my appetite to explore further.\n\nThis group, however, is not one for “bystanders.” If you want to participate, you should prepare to present ideas, discuss openly, debate and make a meaningful contribution to the group. Along the way, you’ll meet professional, gifted leaders and make some valuable acquaintances.\n\nStraz Pozarna\n\nMy introduction to and interaction with members of the Polish fire service (or “straz pozarna,” Polish for fire brigade) has been one of the more vivid and meaningful experiences of my life. This adventure began with an e-mail from Bill Peterson (retired fire chief from Plano, Texas) in December 2004.\n\nChief Peterson was offered a professional development opportunity in the form of a 1-month exchange with students from the Main School of Fire Service in Warsaw. The Polish fire service is nationalized, and the Main School is their officer academy, similar to our military academies.From the Main School, officer candidates receive academic degrees, and the graduates receive assignment to a district somewhere in Poland.\n\nThe exchange provided unique experiences to Polish fire officer candidates working among their counterparts in the American fire service. The Polish candidates used the exchange experiences to augment their education program at the school.\n\nAfter success in Plano, the Main School wanted to expand this opportunity and place up to 10 students in U.S. fire departments for a 1-month period during the following year. I jumped at the opportunity and, in September 2005, we welcomed our first Polish fire officer candidate, Tomasz Biernacki, to our corner of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn the ensuing years, our members and our organization were enriched each year we welcomed a new officer candidate from Poland, and we formed friendships that span a great ocean. Our employees also invited the students to participate in other activities during the weekends, showing them some life in America other than that related to the fire station and response vehicles.\n\nIn return, the Main School agreed to host a representative from the placement department at the Main School for a return study visit. I took the opportunity to visit Poland and the Main School in 2006; in 2007, one of our company officers made a similar visit.\n\nI can’t fully describe the influence and impact of an international connection in this column. I gained new perspectives, deeper understanding and amazing memories. My only regret: that I didn’t embark on this endeavor much sooner!\n\nConclusion\n\nThe exploration of others’ ideas and experiences bolsters a leader’s chance of setting a successful professional course. Competent leaders step out of their “comfort zone” to uncover different perspectives, consider new ideas and challenge their routines.\n\nThere are more opportunities now to connect than at any previous time … and more are on the way. Look beyond your work base and connect with international elements right in your own community. Don’t miss the priceless opportunity for professional growth and personal enrichment. And look beyond our borders to connect with the international community. Your community will benefit and your leadership skills will expand."
