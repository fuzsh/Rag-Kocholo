        "text": "00:01\n\nFire and black smoke billow up.\n\n00:07\n\nThis large-scale fire at an oil refinery was caused by an earthquake.\n\n00:15\n\nThe fire spread from tank to tank, making firefighting efforts extremely difficult.\n\n00:23\n\nI thought I might actually die here today.\n\n00:31\n\nThese kinds of large-scale fires can occur all over the world.\n\n00:38\n\nThis scientist was prompted into action.\n\n00:44\n\nWe started R&D on robots for use in places where humans cannot go,\n\n00:48\n\nto lessen the impact of disasters and help us get back to normal.\n\n01:02\n\nThey developed the world's first robot fire brigade.\n\n01:09\n\nFour robots equipped with artificial intelligence that can make decisions on their own\n\n01:14\n\nand work together to extinguish a fire.\n\n01:20\n\nLet's take a look at the amazing new technology behind the robot fire brigade.\n\n01:37\n\nIchihara is one of Japan's leading industrial cities, with several oil refineries.\n\n01:45\n\nIt's also home to the world's first robot fire brigade.\n\n01:50\n\nHello.\n\n01:51\n\nHello.\n\n01:54\n\nDr. Hisanori AMANO developed the robot fire brigade.\n\n02:01\n\nIs it the big vehicle I can see over there?\n\n02:05\n\nYes, that big fire engine transports all the robots together.\n\n02:12\n\nIt's making a dynamic entrance.\n\n02:18\n\nThis is the transport vehicle for the robot fire brigade.\n\n02:25\n\nThere are four robots inside.\n\n02:29\n\nOh, that's impressive.\n\n02:35\n\nUp close, they're bigger than I expected.\n\n02:42\n\nDevelopment was prompted by the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011,\n\n02:50\n\nwhen a magnitude 9 earthquake caused buildings to collapse and triggered a tsunami that killed over 15,000 people.\n\n03:04\n\nIchihara City, about 400 kilometers from the epicenter, also suffered major damage.\n\n03:15\n\nA tank at the oil refinery caught fire.\n\n03:19\n\nThe fire continued to burn for more than 10 days as it spread to other tanks.\n\n03:29\n\nThe fire couldn't be readily extinguished because firefighters couldn't get close to it,\n\n03:34\n\ndue to the risk of explosion.\n\n03:38\n\nThe firefighters were very courageous,\n\n03:41\n\nbut there comes a point where humans can't go any further.\n\n03:51\n\nSo in 2014, Amano started developing a robot that can fight fires in dangerous places that humans cannot access.\n\n04:01\n\nFive years later, the world's first robot fire brigade was completed.\n\n04:08\n\nThe most important feature is that\n\n04:10\n\nthe robots work together to carry out a coordinated firefighting operation.\n\n04:18\n\nThere are four robots, divided into a reconnaissance team and a firefighting team.\n\n04:28\n\nFirst, a drone-type robot is deployed.\n\n04:35\n\nThe drone assesses the situation with a bird's-eye view.\n\n04:44\n\nIt detects the fire source with visible-light and thermal imaging cameras,\n\n04:50\n\nand will automatically approach to take a closer look.\n\n04:55\n\nBy overlaying the normal image and the thermal image,\n\n04:59\n\nwe can see which areas are hotter.\n\n05:06\n\nHowever, the closer it gets to the fire, the more turbulent the airflow becomes.\n\n05:11\n\nIt's important to ensure stability in the air.\n\n05:17\n\nThe drone has two sets of propellers.\n\n05:25\n\nBy rotating the upper and lower propellers in opposite directions,\n\n05:29\n\nit's possible to generate strong propulsive force even in hot airflow.\n\n05:36\n\nIts on-board thermal sensor and gas sensor help automatically determine\n\n05:40\n\nwhether there is any danger of hot airflow or explosion.\n\n05:46\n\nThis protects the drone itself, so it can collect and transmit information to the ground robot.\n\n05:57\n\nThe role of the ground robot is to identify a safe route for the water cannon robot.\n\n06:04\n\nIt uses a laser to check for obstacles.\n\n06:11\n\nIf there's an obstacle, it can fold up its wheels\n\n06:17\n\nand change to tracks.\n\n06:27\n\nIt can overcome the obstacles.\n\n06:33\n\nIn this way, the robot makes its own decisions and gathers information about the site of the fire.\n\n06:43\n\nThe truck that carries the robots is used as the command vehicle.\n\n06:49\n\nPlease be careful.\n\n06:55\n\nThere are lots of monitors.\n\n06:58\n\nThis is the ground reconnaissance robot.\n\n07:00\n\nThis is the drone reconnaissance robot.\n\n07:02\n\nThe images they take are displayed here.\n\n07:08\n\nThe data is used to create a firefighting plan.\n\n07:14\n\nFirst the location of the fire source is entered onto a map of the site that has been loaded in advance.\n\n07:23\n\nThe system then calculates the distance from the fire source, and suggests potential locations for the water cannon.\n\n07:30\n\nIn this case, there are two possible locations: A and B.\n\n07:38\n\nNext, it shows possible routes to the water release point using red and green lines.\n\n07:46\n\nThen, the human controller makes the final decision on which location to use for the water cannon, and which route to take.\n\n08:03\n\nI don't think everything should be done automatically.\n\n08:07\n\nIt's important that a human who understands the situation\n\n08:12\n\nmakes the final decision and takes responsibility.\n\n08:18\n\nOnce a firefighting plan is decided,\n\n08:21\n\nthe water cannon robot and hose extension robot are deployed.\n\n08:28\n\nBy using a hose extension robot, the hose can be used up to 300 meters from the fire hydrant.\n\n08:38\n\nThe hose is neatly deployed from the back.\n\n08:47\n\nIt's finally time to release the water.\n\n08:53\n\nOh, that's great. It goes up high.\n\n09:01\n\nIt's spraying water further and further away.\n\n09:07\n\nThe effective range is 70 meters, about three times that of a normal fire engine.\n\n09:16\n\nIt's much smaller than a typical fire engine.\n\n09:19\n\nHow can it withstand such high water pressure?\n\n09:25\n\nIt's heavy.\n\n09:27\n\nThis creates a large amount of frictional force.\n\n09:33\n\nThe robot weighs 1.5 tons.\n\n09:36\n\nThis means it can release 4 tons of water per minute.\n\n09:43\n\nThe reconnaissance robot takes pictures from above\n\n09:48\n\nto see if water is reaching the desired locations.\n\n09:53\n\nIf it is missing its target, the reconnaissance robot transmits the correct location to the water cannon robot,\n\n10:02\n\nand it corrects automatically.\n\n10:07\n\nWe've done some research to see if just one robot could do everything.\n\n10:14\n\nBut here we're carrying out one big firefighting operation\n\n10:20\n\nby dividing up the roles.\n\n10:24\n\nHeat from the fire is a danger to these robots.\n\n10:29\n\nIf it gets too hot, the electronic equipment will stop working.\n\n10:34\n\nSo this is what Amano devised.\n\n10:38\n\nThe secret is this silver material.\n\n10:44\n\nHis team developed a special material called aluminum-coated fiber.\n\n10:49\n\nIt can reflect 95% of the heat.\n\n10:54\n\nThe entire robot is covered with this material.\n\n11:02\n\nThe back side is designed to deal with the remaining 5% of the heat.\n\n11:08\n\nIt's like a mesh.\n\n11:09\n\nIt looks like ordinary material, but it's very important.\n\n11:16\n\nBy spraying water from inside the robot's body, the remaining 5% can be canceled out.\n\n11:37\n\nLike a sprinkler.\n\n11:40\n\nThat's what's happening inside.\n\n12:02\n\nIn fires caused by oil, foam-like extinguishing fluid is used to cut off airflow.\n\n12:11\n\nHowever, this kind of foam is easily blown away by the wind and is difficult to control.\n\n12:18\n\nWe've developed a special nozzle.\n\n12:25\n\nThe aqueous solution acts like a pipe,\n\n12:30\n\nprotecting and delivering the foam to the desired location.\n\n12:44\n\nThe newly developed nozzle envelops the foam used for extinguishing fires in an aqueous solution.\n\n12:55\n\nThe solution is heavier than the foam and more wind-resistant,\n\n12:59\n\nso it's now possible to target the foam at the fire more accurately than before.\n\n13:10\n\nThe robot fire brigade was completed in 2017, and has been used in real life situations.\n\n13:21\n\nIn 2022, a sulfur dioxide gas leak occurred at a chemical plant.\n\n13:28\n\nHigh concentrations of sulfur dioxide gas are dangerous for humans and make it difficult to breathe.\n\n13:36\n\nIt was too risky for firefighters to get close.\n\n13:41\n\nI was at the scene.\n\n13:44\n\nThere was a strong smell and it was frightening.\n\n13:48\n\nThe robot fire brigade was called into action.\n\n13:53\n\nBy approaching the site and vigorously spraying it with water,\n\n13:57\n\nthey were able to disperse the toxic gas and reduce its concentration to a safe level.\n\n14:05\n\nRobots are very useful,\n\n14:08\n\nand will continue to be important partners in the field.\n\n14:14\n\nAmano would like to further expand the scope of the robot fire brigade's activities.\n\n14:22\n\nThis system only exists here in Japan.\n\n14:26\n\nI hope these robots can be used to suit other local circumstances.\n\n14:42\n\nA robot fire brigade equipped with artificial intelligence that can operate in areas where humans cannot go:"
