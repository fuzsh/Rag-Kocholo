        "text": "Fireworks explode in the night sky. Families gather around campfires. Signs in national forests gauge fire danger. Sirens blaring and lights flashing, fire engines speed through streets. Almost every day we experience fire’s presence in many ways. Through the centuries people have harnessed fire’s power to cook food, heat dwellings, and light buildings. At the same time, they have struggled to control its power to destroy cities and forests. A visit to a fire station introduces most students to the machines and equipment firefighters use in emergency situations. The selections in “Firefighters at Work” include stories of loss and recovery as well as overviews of the profession’s history and current technology. Managing fires in forests and grasslands generates more debate. The books listed under “Wildfires” reveal the natural part that fire plays in many ecosystems, the disagreement over prescribed burns, and the ways smoke jumpers and other specially trained firefighters work to contain fires that blaze out of control. “Historic Fires” includes the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, which revealed the abysmal working conditions of immigrants and spurred improvements in factory safety. Fiction and nonfiction selections give voice to victims and survivors of this event and others. Fire also plays a part in “Creation and Celebration.” Religious and national festivals use candles and fireworks to dispel darkness. Whether conducting experiments about the science of fireworks or creating candles, students can participate in hands-on activities. Fire has inspired a broad range of stories and poetry. From Peter Dickinson’s tale of a sorcerer seduced by fire’s power to S. D. Nelson’s adaptation of traditional Lakota stories, these books transport readers to different eras and cultures. One of Marilyn Singer’s poems declares that “Fire has contradiction at its heart,” bringing both comfort and terror. As the titles in this month’s feature illustrate, books about fire also provide multiple starting points to explore topics in history, science, and the arts.\n\nFirefighters at Work\n\nBUTLER, Dori Hillestad.
