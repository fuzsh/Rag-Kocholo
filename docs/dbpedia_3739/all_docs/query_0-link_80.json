        "text": "New York Firefighters\n\nWith more than 11,000 employees and over 3 call-outs per minute, the firefighters of the Big Apple form the most important firefighting body in the whole of the US. Whether fighting a fire raging through homes and restaurants or rescuing a teenager caught out at sea, day-to-day life for these firefighters is varied and unpredictable. Throughout a whole month, a team followed 3 members of the NYC Fire Department, capturing their every move.\n\nThese men and women form part of Rescue 3; a team which works in one of New York City’s poorest areas, where fires are a daily occurrence. Bob is the boss of the team, with almost 40 years of experience. Cyndie is an emergency medic who patrols the streets of Manhattan, giving help to those who need it most. Then there’s Josephine, the daughter of a firefighter tragically killed in the 9/11 attacks. She wants to carry on a family tradition. Through the eyes of these three people, we see what it’s really like to work for the New York City Fire Department."
