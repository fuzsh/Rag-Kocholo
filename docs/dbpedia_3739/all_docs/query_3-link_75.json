        "text": "The 80th birthday of an American fire safety icon will be celebrated in style on Aug. 9, when the Marysville Branch of the St. Clair County Library System hosts a party for Smokey Bear.\n\nMarysville Branch Lead Nancy Gearhart said the birthday party is designed with children’s fun and fire safety education in mind.\n\n“We received some Smokey swag from the Children’s Library and brainstormed on ways to use it,” Gearhart said. “Since it’s Smokey’s 80th, we thought we would put together a little event for him.”\n\nThe “Happy Birthday, Smokey Bear” event will be held at the Marysville Public Library, located at 1175 Delaware Ave. in Marysville. There is no cost to attend and no registration necessary for the event. Any child throughout St. Clair County is welcome to attend. Gearhart said she anticipates over 50 children of all ages will attend.\n\n“The Marysville Fire Department is bringing a fire truck to the library and we’ll be handing out packets of information. Kids and their adults can drop in between 11 and noon to have their photo taken with Smokey, visit with firefighters and explore their truck, and enjoy a cool treat,” Gearhart said.\n\nChildren will also enjoy activity packets, stickers and learn about Smokey Bear’s history via handouts.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Forest Service, the Smokey Bear advertising campaign to prevent wildfire is the longest running and most successful ad campaign in U.S. history. The Forest Service launched a yearlong celebration of Smokey’s 80th birthday in January during the Tournament of Roses Parade. A few of the additional activities nationwide include guest appearances at local events, Facebook livestreams, and a social media campaign in which the Forest Service asked the public to sing “Happy Birthday” to Smokey with the hashtag #SingForSmokey. Videos will be streamed across social media platforms on Aug. 9. More celebration information can be found at smokeybear.com, which includes links to social media.\n\nThe USDA’s Forest Service and the Ad Council first agreed on Aug. 9, 1944, that a fictional bear would be their symbol for forest fire prevention. They called the bear Smokey. The Forest Service has managed the image of Smokey Bear since this time, in cooperation with the Ad Council and National Association of State Foresters. According to the Ad Council, artist Albert Staehle painted the first poster of Smokey Bear, which featured Smokey pouring a bucket of water on a campfire with the saying, “Care will prevent 9 out of 10 fires.”\n\nAs the popularity of the fictional bear grew, appearing on more and more forest fire prevention materials, his slogan was updated in 1947. The slogan became Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires!” and was later revised to, “Only YOU Can Prevent Wildfires!”\n\nIn the spring of 1950, a real bear was officially named Smokey, according to the Ad Council. A major wildfire swept the Capitan Mountains of New Mexico, trapping a young bear cub in a tree as the forest around him burned. Although he survived the fire, he suffered serious burns.\n\nThe firefighters who rescued him named him Smokey, and a rancher among the crew took him home. Smokey was retrieved by a ranger of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, who took him from the rancher and got him on a plane to Santa Fe to have his burns treated.\n\nSmokey received national news coverage, attracting letters from across the U.S. inquiring about his recovery. A state game warden contacted the chief of the Forest Service, offering to present the cub to the agency under the condition that the cub be dedicated to conservation and wildfire prevention.\n\nSmokey received a home at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., according to the Ad Council. There he served to spread the message of forest conservation and wildfire prevention as the living symbol of Smokey Bear. He received so many letters and gifts of honey that he had to have his own zip code.\n\nThe first living Smokey Bear died at the zoo in 1976 and was buried in New Mexico’s State Historical Park, now called Smokey Bear Historical Park. A second live representation of Smokey Bear, Smokey II, was an orphaned black bear cub who lived from 1975 to 1990.\n\nNicole Tuttle is a freelance reporter for The Voice."
