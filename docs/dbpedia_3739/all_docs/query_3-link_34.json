        "text": "Scott Davidson was a man of many talents-firefighter‚ athlete‚ teacher‚ coach‚ and bartender just to name a few. He gave of himself to his community in many ways. He was looked up to by many as a basketball coach and school teacher. He enjoyed life and all it had to offer. He was a fierce competitor who won many awards. He was an all-star baseball player in the Great Kills Little League. He played four years of basketball at St. Joseph-by-the-Sea High School where he was named the most valuable player in the Jacques Classic All-Star High School game in 1986.\n\nHe earned a bachelor’s degree in history from the College of Staten Island where he played on the basketball team for all four years‚ and was captain his senior year.\n\nMaterialistic things were not of importance to Scott. The most important things to Scott were his two children‚ his son Peter‚ 8 years old‚ and his daughter Casey‚ 4 years old. He was very proud of them‚ and he was happiest while coaching them‚ having a catch or watching a dance recital. He coached his son Peter in football and baseball‚ and his daughter Casey was certainly a ‘Daddy’s Girl.’ He loved his children above all things.\n\nOne of the proudest moments in Scott’s life‚ aside from the birth of his two children‚ was when he graduated the fire academy. He worked at Ladder Company 118 in Brooklyn Heights‚ New York. He was a firefighter since January 16‚ 1994‚ a lifelong dream of his. He often said it was ‘the greatest job in America.’\n\nOn September 11‚ 2001‚ Scott was on duty and responded to the call after a second hijacked airliner struck the World Trade Center.\n\nScott’s acts of heroism are not surprising. He was a brave and fearless man and a devout patriot. He was a friend to many‚ and will be sorely missed by us all.\n\nHe is survived by his two children‚ Peter and Casey‚ his father Stephen Davidson‚ his mother Carla DiMaggio‚ his stepmother Linda Davidson‚ his brother Michael Davidson‚ and his grandmother Celia Lategano."
