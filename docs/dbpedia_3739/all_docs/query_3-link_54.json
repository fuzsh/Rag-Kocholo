        "text": "Summer can’t get here fast enough. For all the firefighter drama-obsessed fans, the creative forces behind Chicago Fire are launching a new docuseries, LA Fire & Rescue, on Wednesday, June 21, 2023, at 8 p.m. on NBC.\n\nUnlike Chicago Fire, which is a fictional show that follows firefighters in Chicago’s Firehouse 51, this new nonfiction series will document the real-life stories of firefighters in the frontlines of the Los Angeles Country Fire Department. The timing of LA Fire & Rescue’s premiere comes as One Chicago (including Chicago Fire) and Law & Order are on break for summer vacation.\n\nOur sister publication Deadline first reported in May 2021 that the firefighter-centered reality TV series had received a green light from NBC. Eddie Schmidt, the director behind Ugly Delicious, Chelsea Does and In Search of…, will serve as the showrunner. LA Fire & Rescue will be produced by Dick Wolf and Tom Thayer for Wolf Entertainment, Rasha Drachkovitch for 44 Blue and Universal Television Alternative Studio, a division of Universal Studio Group, according to Deadline.\n\nWe’ve got all the details about the new NBC series LA Fire & Rescue, including the release date, how to watch the new docuseries, the cast and more.\n\nWhat is LA Fire & Rescue about?\n\nWhat is LA Fire & Rescue about? The new LA-based docuseries from Dick Wolf Productions and NBC will follow the passionate firefighters from the Los Angeles County Fire Department as they risk their lives to fight unpredictable dangers on the front lines. The series “will provide unprecedented access to the inner workings of the Los Angeles County Fire Department,” according to NBC Insider. The department is responsible for protecting the lives and property of four million residents across 59 cities in Los Angeles County.\n\nLA Fire & Rescue’s Capt. Dan Olivas, who led Station 16 for 18 years, spoke with TV Line ahead of the show’s premiere. “That’s a lot to cover… We get some raging brush fires, structure fires, mountain rescues, helicopters, camp crews, lifeguards, fireboats. We have more resources probably than most departments have in the country. One day, I could be in the city, and the next, I could be on a raging wildland fire. A lot of departments don’t have that. That’s what makes us different.”\n\nOlivas also added that viewers will be surprised just how much his team does beyond rescue calls. “They’re going to see that it’s not all about fires and EMS runs. They’re going to see that we support our community that we work in,” he explained. “We go out to the schools, we’ll do station tours. We have to clean our station… This is a place we live in. We’re here 24 hours a day, a third of our lives. We maintain our apparatus. We do a lot that the public doesn’t know we do.”\n\nChicago Fire star David Eigenberg also told TV Line that he thinks the show will really appeal to One Chicago fans because both series focus on the bonds formed on the job. “We have a bunch of wonderful people on Chicago Fire… and being here for the day with these first responders and firefighters [from the LACoFD], they are wonderful people,” Eigenberg said. “[Viewers are] going to get to spend time with a family of people, and we have a family in Chicago of our fellow actors and some of the real firefighters.”\n\nThe longtime Chicago Fire actor added: “We can’t show certain stuff, and these guys are going to. And you’re going to see some stuff that is going to show the best in humanity and all these men and women.”\n\nRead the full synopsis of LA Fire & Rescue, below:\n\n“From the producers of NBC’s hit drama Chicago Fire comes LA Fire & Rescue, a new docuseries offering unprecedented access to the inner workings of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
