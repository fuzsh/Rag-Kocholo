        "text": "FIRE LOVER\n\nA True Story\n\nBy Joseph Wambaugh\n\n338 pages. William Morrow. $25.95.\n\nJohn Orr was a Glendale, Calif., fire investigator who specialized in arson in more ways than one. That makes Joseph Wambaugh's true-crime book about him a notable departure from books celebrating the courage and sacrifice of firefighters. Mr. Orr has been linked to four deaths and millions of dollars of property damage, and has written a fabulously inept roman Ã  clef about his own crime spree. He was nobody's hero.\n\n''Fire Lover'' explains how Mr. Orr was drawn to law enforcement at an early age and how he liked to behave like a police officer even though he wasn't one. Traumatized by his inability to land a job with the Los Angeles Fire Department, he gravitated to the less prestigious one in Glendale, and he soon impressed his colleagues as a strange character. He loved hunting down burglars, even if it meant high-speed chases in his fire truck. He took pride in catching shoplifters. And he made a point of photographing fires for his own purposes. He often seemed to be conveniently close at hand when they started.\n\nMr. Wambaugh, a former detective sergeant in the Los Angeles Police Department as well as a sanguine teller of crime tales, begins by describing the most lethal fire. Some were set outdoors, but the arsonist in question liked big, anonymous stores. At Ole's Home Center in South Pasadena, a small fire began in the vicinity of a potato chip bag, which Mr. Wambaugh describes as ''a sack of solid fuel.'' It was ignited by what would become this culprit's signature delay device: a cigarette burning down until it reached a pack of matches, with a sheet of yellow paper to enhance the flames.\n\nWhen the building swiftly became engulfed, it burned with a bluish-green tint and a strange hissing sound. This came from the polyurethane that was in much of the merchandise, especially bedding. Eventually, the perpetrator would be nicknamed the Pillow Pyro.\n\nFoam stuffing began to burn in a big way when arson investigators held conventions, like one in Fresno in 1987. Mr. Orr happened to be around when a string of store fires broke out in that vicinity, as if to taunt the fellow investigators who had refused to take him seriously. The book mentions that his psychological profile, as determined when he applied for work in Los Angeles, was that of ''a schizoid person who is withdrawn from people and may have sexual confusion in his orientation.'' And that is about as deeply as Mr. Wambaugh delves into his psyche, beyond adding that these crimes were committed by ''the kind of guy who starts out as a kid pulling wings off insects and setting cats' tails on fire, and then just branches out.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
