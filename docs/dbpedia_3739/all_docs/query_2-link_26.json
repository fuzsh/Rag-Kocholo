        "text": "1.2.1. Types of firefighter and firefighting activity\n\nA firefighter is an individual who has been educated and trained in the prevention and suppression of fires that threaten life, property, and the environment. The fire service can be made up of different firefighter occupational subgroups and specializations, such as municipal firefighters, volunteer firefighters, fire trainers, wildland firefighters, WUI firefighters, fire cause investigators, and industrial, airport, or military firefighters. In some countries, firefighters may be trained to serve in many of these subgroups (i.e. wildland, municipal, investigation, etc.), whereas in other countries, a fire department (also known as a fire brigade) may have a workforce with firefighters working solely in one subgroup. [The Working Group noted that the tasks carried out by firefighters have changed over time, which may influence exposures. In particular, medical emergency call responses have been an increasing responsibility for firefighters in some countries.]\n\n(a) Employment status of firefighters\n\nThe International Association of Fire and Rescue Services reported that there are more than 15 million firefighters (including 1.49 million career firefighters) in 57 countries, including most high-income countries and some low- and middle-income countries, such as China (CTIF, 2021; see Table S1.2, Annex 1, Supplementary material for Section 1, Exposure Characterization, online only, available from: https://publications.iarc.fr/615). In the USA, two thirds of firefighters are volunteers or part-time paid per call (which includes paid on-call or paid per call) (Fahy et al., 2021). In England, about one third of firefighters are retained (i.e. paid on-call) (United Kingdom Home Office, 2021a). Higher proportions of all firefighters were reported to be volunteers in the Netherlands (80%), Canada (83%), and Australia (89%) (Haynes & Stein, 2018; Australian Government Productivity Commission, 2022; CBS, 2022). Career and volunteer firefighters perform the same basic jobs and tasks, but career firefighters usually work more hours and may have more advanced training than do volunteers (Hwang et al., 2019a; Fahy et al., 2021; NFPA, 2022). Volunteer firefighters are likely to attend fewer fires on average than do career firefighters (Monash University, 2014), but this is not always the case ( ).\n\nFig. 1.1\n\nDistribution of the number of incidents attended by individual firefighters (career full-time and part-time and volunteer)\n\n[The Working Group noted that payment structures and employment status vary by country and that some fire departments may contain both volunteer and career firefighters.] Volunteer firefighters may not have the same resources as career firefighters. For example, in some geographical locations in the USA, volunteer firefighters are less likely than career firefighters to be equipped with turnout gear, helmets, and even SCBA that are compliant with the recommendations of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Volunteers also tend to be firefighters in smaller departments, in more rural communities, and may lack the resources or finances to properly maintain or decontaminate their equipment or safety gear (Hwang et al., 2019a; NFPA, 2022). [The Working Group noted that it is not well understood how these organizational factors impact volunteer firefighters’ exposures.]\n\n(b) Minority and under-represented groups\n\nTraditionally, the firefighter workforce has been a male-dominated profession. Women are under-represented in firefighting (see Table S1.2, Annex 1, Supplementary material for Section 1, Exposure Characterization, online only, available from: https://publications.iarc.fr/615). Among career firefighters, the proportion of women in the workforce reported ranged from 2% (Germany) and 4% (USA, Canada) up to 8% (New Zealand) (Statistics Canada, 2018; Fire and Emergency New Zealand, 2021; German Network of Female Firefighters, 2022). In an Australian cohort study covering employment from pre-1970 to 1995 and later, 4% of the full-time career firefighters and 8% of part-time career firefighters were women (Monash University, 2014). Among volunteer firefighters, 10% were women in the USA and Germany (Fahy et al., 2021; German Network of Female Firefighters, 2022). In Australia, this was 19% (Monash University, 2014). Among all firefighters in Portugal, 13% were reported to be women (Lam, 2009).\n\nMinority groups (e.g. racial and/or ethnic groups that make up a small proportion of the regional or national population being studied) are also often under-represented in firefighting. In the USA, the Bureau of Labor Statistics documented that in 2015 more than 1.2 million people were employed as firefighters and other first responders; the majority were White, non-Hispanic men, and aged between 25 and 54 years (Schafer et al., 2015). In England in 2020, 93% of firefighters were men and only 4% were members of an ethnic minority group (United Kingdom Home Office, 2021b). [The Working Group has identified a lack of information on firefighter exposures by race, ethnicity, and sex.]\n\n(c) Municipal firefighters\n\nMunicipal (also referred to in the literature as “structural” or “urban”) firefighters are an occupational subgroup of firefighters who engage in activities of fire suppression, rescue, and property conservation in buildings and enclosed structures that are involved in a fire or emergency situation. These firefighters may work for urban, suburban, or rural fire departments or agencies, and may have complex and variable work histories and exposures because of their changing occupational roles and fire responses (Fahy et al., 2021).\n\nPotential assignments for firefighters at a structure fire incident include attack, search and rescue, outside ventilation, overhaul, backup or rapid intervention, engineer or pump operation, rehabilitation, and incident command (US Fire Administration, 2008; Fent et al., 2017) ( , ). Attack involves advancing a hose line and suppressing all active fire. Search and rescue may involve forcible entry into the structure and then a search for any victims. Outside ventilation typically involves creating openings at the windows and roof for horizontal and vertical ventilation of smoke and gases. Backup teams often set up a second hose line and are available for additional suppression or support as needed. Rapid intervention teams typically set up just outside the structure and are available for emergency rescue or support services as needed. Overhaul is performed after the fire has been suppressed and involves the active search for and suppression of any residual flames or smouldering items that could reignite the fire. Rehabilitation is a component of incident response in which firefighters are typically checked after an interior fire response and hydrated to prevent more serious conditions such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke. The engineer (also known as a vehicle/pump operator or chauffeur) is responsible for operating the pump and ensuring that hose lines are charged, and the incident commander directs the response activities (US Fire Administration, 2008; Horn et al., 2018; Engel, 2020).\n\nFig. 1.2\n\nMunicipal firefighters during exterior attack of a structure fire\n\nFig. 1.3\n\nFirefighter performing overhaul\n\nOther job assignments are possible depending on the size and height of the structure and spread of the fire, the capabilities and resources of the responding fire companies, and incident management at the scene. A structure fire response may be very different in low- and middle-income countries where resources and technology are limited. For example, interior fire attack and search and rescue are mainly possible where firefighters have the appropriate PPE, such as coat, trousers, gloves, boots, helmet, and SCBA. [The Working Group noted that little research on job assignments and fire structures in low- and middle-income countries, including detailed information on safety gear and PPE, was available in the literature.] In addition to responding to structure fires, firefighters can respond to other emergencies, e.g. vehicle and waste container (dumpster) fires, building collapse, and medical emergencies (Kinsey & Ahrens, 2016), and have other specialities within their department, including emergency medical technician, paramedic, urban search and rescue, and hazardous materials (“hazmat”) specialist (Miami Dade College, 2022).\n\n(d) Life at the fire station\n\nMunicipal firefighters are typically assigned to a fire hall or station that mimics a residential home and includes a kitchen, living room, shower facilities, and sleeping quarters (Kitt, 2009; Markham et al., 2016). Typically, firefighters will start their shift conducting daily equipment checks, preparing their PPE and equipment, and liaising with the outgoing shift. During their shift, firefighters may perform station duties (cleaning, maintenance, cooking), engage in physical activity, participate in training activities, and have free time, depending on the number of emergency events received during their shift. Firefighters often work extended shifts (Section 1.5.2), so some departments allow firefighters to sleep during shifts (Firefighter Connection, 2022).\n\n(e) Wildland firefighters\n\nWildland firefighters are tasked with combatting and preventing wildfires in wildlands and at the WUI (Theobald et al., 2007; Mell et al., 2010). They may be career or volunteer firefighters and are often seasonal workers. Deployments of thousands of wildland firefighting personnel to wildfires have been reported within a single country across a fire season (e.g. 7373 firefighters during the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires) (Parliament of Australia, 2020) or on single days (e.g. in the USA) (NIFC, 2022a). [Data on the number of wildland firefighters are not systematically documented in most countries. In the USA, estimates of the number of wildland firefighters employed by federal agencies are around the tens of thousands (Butler et al., 2017; Broyles et al., 2019).]\n\nFactors that may have an impact on exposure, including fire behaviour, release of fire effluents, and firefighting technique, may vary across wildfires, since wildfires occur in wildlands with varying vegetation types (e.g. peat forest, conifer forest, grassland) and sometimes in the WUI, with structures and vehicles that also contain synthetic materials (HomChaudhuri et al., 2010; Caton et al., 2017; Cruz et al., 2018; Kganyago & Shikwambana, 2020). In addition to wildfire suppression, wildland firefighters carry out fire prevention by performing prescribed burns, which are controlled fires that are intentionally set to achieve resource management objectives, including fuel reduction and ecological purposes (Navarro et al., 2019a). [It is likely that the cumulative occupational smoke exposure of wildland firefighters has been increasing since the annual acreage of wildfire burns (NIFC, 2022a), number of workdays spent at wildfires per year (Navarro et al., 2019a), and/or the total area of land managed by prescribed burns (NIFC, 2022a) have probably increased, as trends in the USA indicate. Similar trends have also been observed in other countries (see Section 1.2.2).]\n\nJob assignments during wildland fire responses differ substantially from structure fire responses (Semmens et al., 2016; Belval et al., 2017). However, municipal firefighters in areas where wildfires are common (e.g. western USA and parts of rural Australia) may be trained and involved in wildfire response activities, and 86% of the 26 000 local (municipal) fire departments in the USA in 2010 were estimated to have wildland firefighting duties (Butler et al., 2017). Wildland firefighters working at wildfires and prescribed burns are typically assigned to hand crews or engine crews (Department of Interior, 2022). Hand crews are responsible for clearing brush and other burnable vegetation along the expected pathway of the fire to construct a fire line or linear fire barrier. Hand crews often use gasoline-powered chainsaws, shovels, and other hand tools to construct the fire line; this is strenuous, time-consuming work and may involve hiking long distances (Reinhardt & Ottmar, 2004; Williamson et al., 2016). After a fireline has been secured, mop-up can proceed; this involves the extinction of any burning or smouldering vegetation, usually by covering the material with soil. Mop-up may also involve the removal of partially burned vegetation, including the felling of standing dead trees (USDA Forest Service, 2021b). Wildland firefighters may also use hand drip torches fuelled by a mixture of gasoline and diesel for backfiring (burning out unburned fuels between an active wildfire and a defensible perimeter) during wildfire suppression or for lighting vegetation during prescribed burns or backburns (Reinhardt & Ottmar, 2004; Adetona et al., 2019; McCormick & May, 2021).\n\nEngine crews work with diesel-powered fire engines that carry water or foam and are used to suppress active fires where access is possible (USDA Forest Service, 2021c). There are other speciality disciplines in wildland firefighting, such as smoke jumpers and helitack crews, who parachute, rappel, or land near the wildfires to provide more targeted interventions (USDA Forest Service, 2021d). [Numerous other tasks beyond those discussed here may also be carried out to control the spread of wildfires or manage prescribed burns.]\n\nWildland firefighters usually carry their equipment with them in backpacks and wear light protective clothing, such as long-sleeved fire-resistant shirts, trousers, and gloves, mountaineering boots, and hard hats. Respiratory protection is not commonly used (see ). However, the type of protective gear worn and the way in which wildfires are managed may differ between countries.\n\nFig. 1.4\n\nWildland firefighter during a controlled forest fire in northern Portugal\n\nStudies have shown that wildland firefighters are exposed to high physiological workloads, extended work hours, and dangerous environmental weather extremes (Carballo-Leyenda et al., 2017; Vincent et al., 2017; Hemmatjo et al., 2018). During a wildfire, these fire crews must provide around-the-clock fire suppression to protect life and property, which may last days, weeks, or months. For example, there is a standard 14-day wildfire assignment for federally employed wildland firefighters in the USA, but this may be extended up to 30 days (with a 2-day break in the middle of the period) under certain circumstances (NWCG, 2004). These extended response times in remote locations not only increase exposure duration, but also make it difficult to clean protective clothing and skin (Cherry et al., 2019). Wildland firefighters are temporarily housed at base camps in the proximity of wildfires during fire suppression deployments (McNamara et al., 2012). They may experience additional exposures at these base camps because of the transport of wildfire smoke plume over the camps, vehicle and power generator exhausts, and road dust (McNamara et al., 2012).\n\n(f) Fire instructors\n\nFire instructors play a critical role in the development and training of firefighters (Reeder & Joos, 2019). When the firefighter recruit begins training, their first experience with live or simulated fire is led by an instructor. In many countries, a fire instructor is required to possess certification as a fire service instructor and/or subject matter expertise in subject areas of fire science demanded by fire departments and organizations. Fire service instructors teach in both classroom and laboratory settings (training grounds) from prepared lesson plans and under the direct supervision of or in collaboration with another senior fire service instructor (IFSTA, 2022). Fire instructors can be involved in multiple fire-training exercises on a given day.\n\nLive-fire training may involve different types of fuel. Live-fire training environments in which an unconfined open flame or device propagates fire to the building or structure are designed to simulate the operational fire environment, but the specific chemical exposures to instructors may be quite different from those of real-world fires (Kirk & Logan, 2015a). For example, using plywood and chipboard as the fuel in training fires produces more pollutants than do pure pine or spruce, whereas the exposures measured during propane-burning training fires are lowest (Laitinen et al., 2010). A different study found that training exercises burning a certain type of oriented strand board (as well as pallet and straw) produced higher concentrations of certain chemicals (some of those already classified by IARC as carcinogenic to humans, Group 1) than did training exercises burning pallet and straw alone (Fent et al., 2019a).\n\nFire instructors may also experience cumulative exposure to air contaminants that far exceeds that of firefighters in operational fire environments (Kirk & Logan, 2015a; Fent et al., 2019a). Additionally, the behaviours and role of fire instructors in the training environment are different from those at an active fire scene. The non-emergency situation may not elicit the same work rate and physiological response, therefore increasing the length of exposure to chemicals (Kirk & Logan, 2015a). [The Working Group noted that evaluating the difference between air contaminant concentrations in the training environment and those in the microenvironment inside the instructor’s firefighting ensemble, from which the majority of dermal uptake would occur, has received little research attention.]\n\n(g) Fire cause investigators\n\nA smaller subgroup of the firefighter workforce comprises fire cause investigators, who have responsibility for investigating and analysing incidents involving fires and explosions (NFPA, 2021c). They conduct root cause analysis of fire incidents and render an expert opinion as to the origin, cause, responsibility for, or prevention of fire incidents. Fire cause investigators are educated and trained in several topics, including fire science, fire chemistry, thermodynamics, thermometry, fire dynamics, explosion dynamics, computer fire modelling, and fire investigation and analysis (IAAI, 2018).\n\nFire cause investigators may work in either the public or private sector. Typically, those in the public sector are employed by municipalities, such as fire or police departments, or by state or federal agencies. Those working in the private sector may be employed by insurance companies, lawyers, or private firms. Many fire investigators come up through the firefighter ranks, starting out as municipal firefighters, and gaining experience in various aspects of fire behaviour before specializing in fire cause investigations. Some may begin in law enforcement and gain experience or training in arson investigations but do not necessarily have any direct firefighting experience (Belfiglio, 2022). Only fire cause investigators who have worked as or are working as firefighters are considered in the present monograph.\n\nAlthough fire cause investigators usually report to the fire scene to conduct their analysis immediately after either the fire suppression and overhaul phases of a fire incident response, their attendance and investigation can be delayed hours or days post-fire suppression (Horn et al., 2022). A fire investigation can take from a few days up to a few months (Firefighter Insider, 2022). Fire cause investigators will use scientific methods to systematically review the fire scene, determine the circumstances as to the cause of the fire, and issue a determination, such as natural, deliberate, accidental incendiary, or undetermined cause (Daeid, 2005). Depending on the jurisdiction and standard operating procedures for the fire department, a fire investigator may use different approaches to conduct the investigation. Fire cause investigators generally attend more fire scenes than do most firefighters; however, they typically wear less PPE than firefighters, despite potentially harmful exposures at the investigation scene well after the fire is extinguished. [The Working Group noted that little research on exposure of fire cause investigators in high-income countries or in low- and middle-income countries (including the use of safety gear and PPE) was available in the literature.]\n\n(h) Other subspecialities in the fire service\n\nFirefighters can be employed in other work settings, including airports, military environments, and industrial complexes. Aviation rescue and firefighting is a type of firefighting that involves the emergency response, mitigation, evacuation, and rescue of passengers, crew, and property from aircraft involved in aviation accidents and fire incidents (Braithwaite, 2001; Smith et al., 2018). Although variations across countries can occur, airports with scheduled passenger flights are required to have firefighters and firefighting apparatus at the airport ready to respond at any time to an aircraft fire incident (Blocker, 2020). Airports may have regulatory oversight by an arm of their individual national governments or voluntarily under standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2011). Military firefighters are first responders in emergencies and may be required to perform fire suppression activities, rescue operations during a fire or other emergencies, or respond to hazardous spills in the military environment or war theatre (Moore et al., 2022). Industrial firefighters are specially trained firefighters who serve at manufacturing facilities, petrochemical plants, and refineries, among other industrial settings (Shelley et al., 2007; Ghasemi et al., 2021). They encounter unique challenges not commonly encountered by municipal firefighters, such as site-specific hazards, access areas, equipment, business priorities, and personnel, that will impact their fire suppression approach and tools at the industrial fire.\n\nFirefighters at airports use AFFFs to extinguish class B fires, which are fires that arise from petroleum products or flammable liquids or gases, such as oil, gasoline, jet fuel, and other fuels (Rotander et al., 2015b; Milley et al., 2018; Environmental Litigation Group PC, 2020) (see ). Until 2021, airports in the USA were required to use AFFF that contains fluorinated surfactants (Andrews et al., 2021; Shepardson, 2021). Additional information on PFAS use is included in Section 1.5.1(b). All United States (US) military branches were required to use fluorinated firefighting foams at bases located in the USA. Fluorinated AFFFs have also been used in other countries, such as Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (UK) (Hu et al., 2016; Allcorn et al., 2018; Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019). Local municipalities also use and store AFFF. In the USA, almost 75% of AFFF is used by the military, and the remaining 25% is used by organizations such as refineries, fuel tank farms, municipal airports, and other industries (Andrews et al., 2021; Environmental Litigation Group PC, 2020). See Section 1.7 for regulations on use of firefighting foams.\n\nFig. 1.5\n\nFirefighters using fire suppression foam on a class B fire at an airport\n\n1.2.2. Changes in frequency and intensity of fires\n\n[Global trends in structure fires are difficult to ascertain because fire statistics are not available in all countries. These statistics do not include training fires or chemical incidents, which may also contribute to firefighters’ exposures.] In the USA, there were 4.2 fires per 1000 population in 2020, which is about the same rate as in 2010, but more than 60% lower than the rate in 1980. Of those fires, approximately 35% were structure fires, 15% were vehicle fires, and 50% were outdoor or vegetation fires (Ahrens & Evarts, 2021). In England, firefighters responded to more than 151 000 fires in the year ending March 2021, which is a 34% decrease compared with 10 years previously. More than 40% of those fires occurred in a building, vehicle, or outdoor structure, or involved a fatality or casualty (Government of the United Kingdom, 2021). In Australia, there was a trend towards increased frequency of bushfires between 2011 and 2016 (Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC, 2019). In Asia, Tishi & Islam (2018) reported that of all the fires in Bangladesh in the years 2010–2013, the fire incidence in Dhaka Metropolitan Area corresponded to the mean of [16.5%], and the highest frequency (36%) occurred in residential areas. The highest density of fire incidents occurred in areas of commercial and mixed use (38% and 26%, respectively). For other regions, e.g. Latin America and Africa, no information was available.\n\n[Wildfire statistics are presented both on area burned and number of fires, and these may appear contradictory.] In southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and Greece), the annual area burnt in forest fires has decreased from around 600 000 hectares in the 1980s to less than 400 000 hectares in the 2010s (San-Miguel-Ayanz et al., 2022). From the 1950s to the 2000s, the average annual area burnt in forest fires in Finland has decreased from 5760 hectares to 643 hectares (Suokas, 2015). According to one analysis, the global area burned by wildfires appears to have declined overall over past decades; however, the probability and severity of wildland fire is increasing in some regions of Europe (Doerr & Santín, 2016; Fernandez-Anez et al., 2021; San-Miguel-Ayanz et al., 2022).\n\nOther analyses also suggest that the frequency of wildfires is increasing in some parts of the world. In the UK, peat, grass, and wildfires are becoming increasingly common, reflecting the changing weather patterns that are making the UK hotter and drier (Belcher et al., 2021). According to the European Forest Fire Information System, there is wide variation in the number of wildfires and the area burned each year (San-Miguel-Ayanz et al., 2022). Spatial and temporal trends in the incidence and severity of wildfires in Canada is tracked by the Canadian National Fire Database (Government of Canada, 2021); more than 8000 fires per year burn an average of more than 2.1 million hectares. Recent research suggests that climate change is responsible for noteworthy increases (i.e. 1.5- to 6-fold) in the frequency of extreme burning conditions and, by extension, the incidence and severity of wildfires in Canada (Coogan et al., 2020).\n\nDuring the last decade, the USA has experienced exceptionally large fires, California being one of the most affected regions (Keeley & Syphard, 2021; State of California, 2021). During the 2017 wildfire season, a total of 71 499 wildfires was reported in the USA (National Interagency Coordination Center, 2017). These wildfires consumed 10 026 086 acres [4 057 413 hectares] of land (153% of the 10-year average) nationally and a total of 12 306 structures were destroyed, meaning that the 2017 wildfire season was the worst on record in terms of total structures lost. In Australia, the length and severity of the wildfire season are also increasing across much of the country, as measured by annual indices of the Forest Fire Danger Index (AFAC, 2021). Regarding Latin America, some studies suggest that there has been an increase in the frequency and length of wildfires over the last decade (González et al., 2018; Urrutia-Jalabert et al., 2018; Barni et al., 2021).\n\nWUI fires are similarly becoming more common (Mell et al., 2010; Stein et al., 2013; Ribeiro et al., 2020). In the USA, significantly destructive WUI fires occurred in Florida in 1998, and in California in 2003, 2007, and, most recently, 2017. WUI fires have also had an impact in Europe, particularly in Portugal, France, Spain, and Greece. This has resulted in large losses of property and numerous human casualties (Ferreira-Leite et al., 2013; Darques, 2015; Tedim et al., 2015; Cardoso Castro Rego et al., 2018; Oliveira et al., 2020a).\n\n1.2.5. Health and health behaviours\n\nHealth behaviours can have an important impact on health status and cancer risk (Klein et al., 2014). Risky health behaviours, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and sedentary behaviour, have been documented in firefighters. Studies have investigated obesity and overall health in firefighters. In a survey of 677 male firefighters from the midwestern USA, the prevalence of obesity (body mass index, BMI ≥ 30) was 32.6% and 38.5% for career and volunteer firefighters, respectively, compared with the age-standardized prevalence in US adults (33.8%) at the time of the survey (Poston et al., 2011). Munir et al. (2012) surveyed 735 male firefighters from the UK and discovered that 53% were overweight and 13% were obese; these were higher percentages than in the general population in England. In contrast, a survey of female career (n = 2398) and volunteer (n = 781) firefighters in the USA and Canada found an age-standardized prevalence of obesity in both career (17.2%) and volunteer (32.8%) firefighters that was lower than in women in the general population (41.1%) (Jahnke et al., 2022). A pilot study using actigraphy to objectively measure occupational and non-occupational physical activity among paid career firefighters found varying levels of physical activity during a typical work week, and these levels varied according to firefighter weight status categories (Kling et al., 2020). The study found that healthy-weight firefighters spent more time engaged in light and moderate physical activity than did overweight and obese firefighters, whereas overweight and obese firefighters spent more time engaged in vigorous physical activity than did their healthy-weight counterparts.\n\nFirefighters have also been reported to experience workplace stress, have poor sleep quality, and have high levels of comorbidities. A survey of 1244 US firefighters (> 94% volunteers) revealed important statistics regarding health determinants and conditions (NVFC, 2010). For example, 54% of respondents said they experienced some or a lot of stress, 26% reported having trouble falling asleep, 28% reported having trouble staying asleep, 37% reported having high blood pressure, and 34% reported having high blood cholesterol.\n\nStudies have also evaluated tobacco use and alcohol consumption among firefighters. A study of tobacco use among 677 male firefighters in the central USA found that career and volunteer firefighters had current cigarette smoking rates (13.6% and 17.4%, respectively) that were below national unadjusted averages between 2008 and 2010 (23.4% for adult men). However, rates for use of smokeless tobacco (18.4% and 16.8%, respectively) were above national unadjusted averages (7.0% for adult men) (Haddock et al., 2011). In the NVFC (2010) survey of mostly volunteer US firefighters, only 10% of respondents were current smokers, but 12% were current users of smokeless tobacco. Phan et al. (2022) examined trends in current smoking and smokeless tobacco use among US firefighters and law enforcement personnel and compared smoking and smokeless tobacco use prevalence in firefighters and law enforcement personnel to that in US adults in non‐first‐responder occupations. During the study observation period (1992–2019), the authors noted that smoking prevalence declined overall and was highest for individuals in other occupations, and that use of smokeless tobacco was higher among firefighters and law enforcement personnel (Phan et al., 2022). Among 1712 female career firefighters surveyed in 2015, the unadjusted rate for smoking was 5.1%, and the unadjusted rate for smokeless tobacco use was 1.2%; the age standardized smoking rates were lower than that of US adult women, which at the time of the study was estimated at 13.5% (Jamal et al., 2018; Jitnarin et al., 2019).\n\nFirefighters, like individuals with other occupations, may engage in risky or binge drinking. Haddock et al. (2017) surveyed 1913 female firefighters in the USA and found that nearly 40% reported binge drinking in the past 30 days, well above rates reported nationally among women at the time (12–15%). Binge drinking for men was defined as five or more drinks on an occasion in this survey, and 56% of career firefighters and 45% of volunteer firefighters reported binge drinking one or more times in the past 30 days (Haddock et al., 2012), about twice the national average for adult men at the time (Kanny et al., 2013).\n\nSome of the unhealthy behaviours reported among firefighters may be related to occupational stressors and/or peer pressure. Jitnarin et al. (2017) surveyed 1474 career male firefighters in the USA and found that nearly 16% of current users of smokeless tobacco initiated use after joining the fire service, which is substantially higher than expected compared with rates in the general population (i.e. 0.8% late initiation for adult males). Haddock et al. (2017) conducted a survey of 1913 US female firefighters and reported that those who screened positive for problem drinking (16.5% of those who drank alcohol) were 2.5 times as likely as the general population to have been diagnosed with depression or have post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and were 40% more likely to have experienced an occupational injury in the past year. Some of these adverse health behaviours (e.g. smoking, binge drinking, and caloric intake from alcohol – i.e. higher amounts of carbohydrates and lower amounts of fibre and vitamins) have been associated with night shift work in other worker populations (Bøggild & Knutsson, 1999; Lowden et al., 2010; Bae et al., 2017; Richter et al., 2021). See Section 1.5.2(a) for more details on shift work.\n\n[The Working Group noted that the information on modifiable risk factors was limited, with nearly all available information stemming from a small number of cross-sectional surveys published since 2011. The representativeness of these studies was low given that the study populations were few (mainly USA) and sample sizes were relatively small. Moreover, longitudinal information was not available (with the exception of tobacco use in the USA, where data from a series of cross-sectional studies were available), although temporal trends probably varied given changes in firefighter behaviours and fire department policies over time.]\n\n1.3.1. Composition of fire smoke\n\nCombustion products are dependent on the chemical composition of the fuel that is burnt and ventilation conditions (temperature and oxygen availability) (Stec, 2017). Combustible materials vary across different types of fire, such as residential, industrial, vehicle, agricultural, and wildland fires, and any fire that is a combination of these (i.e. WUI). The fuel composition ranges from mostly lignocellulosic vegetative biomass in wildland and agricultural fires to various mixes of solid natural materials, solid synthetic materials including plastics, and liquid petrochemical fuels (Yang et al., 2007; Hess-Kosa, 2016). Common fire effluents in different types of fire are presented in .\n\nTable 1.3\n\nCommon fire effluents produced by different types of fire.\n\nVegetation contains mostly carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, and various types of vegetative biomass including wood have been measured and/or estimated to contain 36.2–58.4%, 31.4–49.5%, and 4.4–10.2% of these elements, respectively, by dry or dry ash-free weight (Parikh et al., 2007; Vassilev et al., 2010). Vegetative biomass also contains minor amounts of other elements, including 0.1–3.4% nitrogen and 0.01–0.60% sulfur. [Since vegetative biomass is mostly composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the emissions from wildland fires are dominated by carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons, and oxygenated carbon compounds (Yi & Bao, 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2018). A major difference between wildland fires and other types of fire, including structure, vehicle, and WUI fires, is the presence and number of synthetic materials. Little is known about the chemical composition of consumer products used, for example, in buildings or cars. A non-targeted analysis by Phillips et al. (2018) measured numerous compounds in consumer products, of which 88% were not listed in a database of chemicals known to be used or present in consumer products.]\n\nFires traverse different stages and commonly evolve from non-flaming oxidative pyrolysis, to early well-ventilated flaming, through to fully developed under-ventilated flaming (Purser & Maynard, 2015; Stec, 2017). Oxidative pyrolysis generates low concentrations of partially oxidized organic species (e.g. carbonyl compounds and organic acids). [These may be significant in the case of fuels with a higher moisture content (for example, in peat fires).] Similarly, well-ventilated fires are generally small, and with an increase in temperature and decrease in oxygen concentration can turn into ventilation-controlled (under-ventilated) fires that exhibit much higher concentrations of the released fire effluents (Stec et al., 2007). It has been demonstrated that the yield of combustion products such as CO, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and other smoke components increases by a factor of between 10 and 50 as the fire changes from well-ventilated to under-ventilated (Stec et al., 2007; Stec, 2017). The impact of ventilation conditions on the yields of major gases emitted by fires is presented in .\n\nTable 1.4\n\nThe main fire gases and their dependence on ventilation conditions.\n\nCombustion of most aliphatic materials (consisting only of carbon and hydrogen), such as polyethylene and polypropylene, follows the trend whereby CO concentration increases from a low value in well-ventilated conditions, to a much higher value in under-ventilated flaming. Partially oxidized organic compounds such as carbonyl compounds, organic acids, and PAHs are also present in the smoke from combustion of such materials. Higher yields of aromatic compounds are released in smoke from the combustion of polystyrene, which is an aromatic hydrocarbon polymer (Purser & Maynard, 2015).\n\nA wider range of products are formed when materials containing oxygen or other elements are combusted (Purser & Maynard, 2015). More-oxidized combustion products, such as nitrogen oxides and ammonia, are released in higher concentrations than HCN when nitrogen-containing polymeric materials, e.g. polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams, are combusted under well-ventilated fire conditions (Stec & Hull, 2008). Much higher concentrations of CO and HCN are observed for under-ventilated conditions of these materials (following the patterns for products that only contain hydrocarbons) (Stec & Hull, 2011). Also, gaseous mono-isocyanates were observed in studies of under-ventilated, fully developed enclosure fires of materials including polyurethane foam (Blomqvist et al., 2010, 2014; Stec & Hull, 2011; McKenna et al., 2019, Peck et al., 2021).\n\nMaterials containing chlorine (e.g. polyvinyl chloride, PVC) release CO and hydrogen chloride (HCl). The fire gas pattern is very different from that for all other polymers, since the yields of CO and HCl are independent of the fire scenario (Molyneux et al., 2014), and relatively low carbon dioxide (CO2) yields and high yields of CO, particulates, and organics, and significant residues are observed in well-ventilated combustion conditions (Stec & Hull, 2008; Molyneux et al., 2014). Most of the chlorine contained in the material is released as HCl, but a small proportion of it is released as other chlorine-containing gas or vapour species, such as chloro-aliphatic and chloro-aromatic hydrocarbons. Formation of carcinogenic polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in residential fires commonly occurs when halogenated materials that are widely used in building construction (e.g. in pipes, siding, flooring, and wire insulation) are combusted (Ruokojärvi et al., 2000; Katami et al., 2002; Lavric et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2015). In addition, the presence of specific metals increases the yields of polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). This occurs with construction wood that is impregnated with legacy preservatives (e.g. chromated copper arsenate and pentachlorophenol) and newer preservatives (e.g. alkaline copper quaternary and copper azole) (Wang et al., 2002; Tame et al., 2009; Rabajczyk et al., 2020). The production of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been banned since 1979 in the USA and since 1981 in the UK, and an international agreement in 1986 banned most uses; however, combustion of PCBs in existing electrical equipment and electric fires might result in emission of PCDD/Fs (Buser, 1985; Hutzinger et al., 1985).\n\nAnother fire-derived combustion product is sulfur dioxide (e.g. from phenolic foam) (Stec & Hull, 2011). Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. benzene and 1,3-butadiene), oxygenated organic compounds (e.g. formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein), PAHs, and soot particles are found in almost all fires, and their concentrations are increased when combustion is ventilation-limited (Austin et al., 2001b; IARC, 2010; Purser et al., 2010; Hewitt et al., 2017; Bralewska & Rakowska, 2020).\n\nConcentrations of released combustion products may change when the fuel contains fire retardants. Fire retardants that act in the gas phase and interfere with flame reactions (i.e. flame retardants) are frequently applied to insulation foams, electrical equipment, and upholstered furniture (Blomqvist et al., 2004a, b; Stec & Hull, 2011; McKenna et al., 2019). When burning PVC, a similar gas-phase inhibitory effect is observed. In terms of fire emissions, gas-phase halogenated flame retardants (e.g. organophosphate flame retardants, OPFRs) will release hydrogen bromide (HBr) or HCl, and considerable quantities of CO, HCN, smoke, and other products of incomplete combustion (e.g. acrolein and formaldehyde), as well as larger cyclic molecules such as PAHs and soot particulates (Molyneux et al., 2014; McKenna et al., 2019). Brominated flame retardants have been banned in the USA since 2004 and in the European Union since 2003 (e.g. polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs), and those currently on the market (e.g. tetrabromobisphenol A, TBBPA; and other brominated phenols) are known to enhance concentrations of mixed polybrominated dibenzo-para-dioxins and furans (PBDD/Fs) (Weber & Kuch, 2003; Ortuño et al., 2014; Organtini et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016).\n\nAdditionally, emission of fine and polydisperse particles that are mostly smaller than PM2.5 and generally in the nanometre to submicron range has been reported for wildfires, laboratory combustion testing of wood, and laboratory building and automobile compartment tests simulating overhaul conditions of firefighting (Lachocki et al., 1988; Jankovic et al., 1993; Leonard et al., 2000, 2007; Shemwell & Levendis, 2000; Fine et al., 2001; Valavanidis et al., 2008; Baxter et al., 2010; IARC, 2010; Carrico et al., 2016; Kleinman et al., 2020). Smoke, soot, and particulate emissions vary greatly according to fuel composition and fire conditions (Shemwell & Levendis, 2000; Valavanidis et al., 2008; Blomqvist et al., 2010). However, it is recognized that more and larger-sized particles tend to be generated by fires with less ventilation or oxygen (Shemwell & Levendis, 2000; Blomqvist et al., 2010; Carrico et al., 2016). This effect is enhanced in the presence of halogens, which tend to increase the distribution and concentrations of particulate matter and other volatiles (Blomqvist et al., 2010).\n\nVarious metals (e.g. cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, antimony, thallium, and zinc) and persistent free radicals are also found in the particulate soot and ash residues resulting from wildland, structure, or vehicle fires (Smith et al., 1982; O’Keefe et al., 1985; Jankovic et al., 1993; Leonard et al., 2000, 2007; Dellinger et al., 2007; Valavanidis et al., 2008; Organtini et al., 2015). Carbon- and oxygen-centred radicals in the particles and ash residue persist for up to 6 months, with electron paramagnetic resonance signals in the samples remaining the same across the period. Persistence has also been attributed to trapping within and adsorption to the polymeric carbonaceous matrix (Valavanidis et al., 2008).\n\nVarious types and quantities of gaseous species are also often found to be attached to particulates. This includes, for example, acid gases (HCl, HBr), isocyanates, and various metals (Blomqvist et al., 2010, 2014; Stec et al., 2013).\n\nVehicle fires, in addition to having an increased yield of released metals, can release acid gases (HCl and HF), carbonyl fluoride (COF2), and phosphoryl fluoride (POF3); however, the fire composition may change depending on the type of battery in the vehicle (Lönnermark & Blomqvist, 2006; Larsson et al., 2017; Sturk et al., 2019).\n\n[Although emissions from diesel engine exhaust are not fire smoke components, gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter are released by a combustion process in equipment (the fire engine) that is essential to firefighting operations; these gases are hazards both in firefighting environments and at fire stations, if not captured through local exhaust ventilation (e.g. an exhaust capture system).]\n\n1.3.2. Air sampling and analytical methods for fire effluents\n\nThe choice of sampling and analytical method used to characterize airborne contaminants at a fire incident depends on the contaminant(s) of interest, the physical nature of the airborne samples (i.e. vapour and/or aerosol), the estimated concentrations of contaminants, and any potential interactions with or interferences from other contaminants (Ronnee & O’Connor, 2020). The choice of sampling and analytical method is also strongly influenced by the activities of firefighters at the scene, e.g. whether they are engaged in attack or overhaul activity; the extinguishing agents used; the method of extinguishing agent application; and physical placement, which will have an effect on both the concentration and state of airborne contaminants, as well as the practicality of sampling device placement (Materna et al., 1992; Fent et al., 2018; Alharbi et al., 2021; Banks et al., 2021a).\n\n[While tremendous advances in analytical chemistry have been observed over the past 30 years, little progress has been made in the detailed analysis of combustion chemicals. The major limiting factors to such progress are access to real (accidental) fires, and the complexity involved in sampling and measuring fire effluents, leading to significant difficulties in assessing firefighters’ chemical exposures while attending a fire incident.]\n\nAnalysis of fire smoke at a particular incident involves prior identification of which of these (pre-defined) chemicals are considered to be the most significant or major components of the smoke (e.g. based on knowledge of fuel sources, specific fire conditions, etc.). The choice of specific gases or chemicals to monitor is based on the availability of methods that reliably collect and analyse air-contaminant samples in the fire environment (Caban-Martinez et al., 2018; Fent et al., 2018; Sjöström et al., 2019b). The most common methods are listed in .\n\nTable 1.5\n\nAir sampling and analytical methods available for characterizing firefighters’ exposure to fire effluents.\n\nAmbient or personal-monitoring air samples can be collected either actively or passively. In active sampling, a pumping device actively draws air into a container or through a medium such as a filter, solid adsorbent, denuder, solution, or reagent, and determination of the total volume of air sampled is required (NIOSH, 1994a; Bolstad-Johnson et al., 2000; Fent et al., 2019b). In passive sampling, molecular diffusion and gravity are exploited to collect analytes onto a medium or adsorbent, and no pump is required (Mayer et al., 2022).\n\nSamples can also be classified as integrated, continuous, or grab samples. For integrated samples, the analyte is collected over time (e.g. 15 minutes, 8 hours, full shift, or task) and the average concentration is calculated over the whole measurement period. This does not allow for observations of peaks or troughs in the exposure over time. Continuous samples are collected using a direct reading instrument (i.e. real-time monitor) that provides exposure measurements at set time intervals (e.g. 10 seconds, 1 minute), indicating changes in exposure over the measurement period, such as peaks (Jankovic et al., 1991; Fabian et al., 2014; Evans & Fent, 2015). Grab samples are collected in a bag or container (e.g. evacuated canister) at a specific point in time (Treitman et al., 1980; Reinhardt et al., 2000; Booze et al., 2004; Dills & Beaudreau, 2008). They are a representative sample of the environment from which they are drawn, usually over short periods (e.g. less than 5 minutes), although samples can be collected over longer periods (i.e. hours).\n\nAir samples can be collected over different time periods – a few seconds (e.g. peak measurements), several minutes (e.g. 15–30 minutes, task-based sampling), or longer (e.g. several hours, work-shift sampling). A series of samples or continuous measurements can also be collected and then integrated (i.e. integrated sampling) to calculate a time-weighted average (Bolstad-Johnson et al., 2000; Slaughter et al., 2004; Fabian et al., 2010; Adetona et al., 2013a; Wu et al., 2021).\n\nThe choice of analytical method will vary according to the sampling method and sample type (Ronnee & O’Connor, 2020). Selectivity of the analytical method (i.e. avoiding matrix effects and/or interference from other fire species), limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ), and levels of sensitivity and accuracy between different methodologies also need to be carefully considered when selecting from the large number of analytical methodologies currently available for characterizing fire effluents (NIOSH 1992a, b; Bolstad-Johnson et al., 2000; Fabian et al., 2010; Fent et al., 2020a) These methods are summarized in , which highlights types of fire effluent identified and measured, sampling methods, analytical techniques, and LOD/LOQ, when available.\n\nIn the 1980s, sampling and analytical methodologies were refined for several different gases, such as CO, HCN, and aldehydes, using colorimetric or charcoal sorbent tubes followed by infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, GC-MS, and/or gas chromatography-flame ionization detection, GC-FID) (Gold et al., 1978; Treitman et al., 1980; Lowry et al., 1985; Reisen et al., 2006; Navarro et al., 2017, 2019b). Methods for the collection and analysis of particulate matter have been developed continuously, with the implementation of different sampling media (e.g. different types of filter), particle collection devices (e.g. cyclones or cascade impactors) for investigating particle size distribution, and more reliable and robust analytical methodologies (NIOSH, 1992a, 1994a, 2013a, 2019; Fent & Evans, 2011; Evans & Fent, 2015; Fent et al., 2019b). Research in the 1990s was dominated by the characterization of firefighters’ exposures in forest or wildland fire settings and subsequently by increasing interest in the characterization and effects of diesel exhaust emissions (at fire stations) and the effectiveness of SCBA (Jankovic et al., 1991; NIOSH, 1994a, 1998b; Than et al., 1995). A wealth of research has also been published on simulated residential fires (NIOSH, 1992a, b, 1994a; Materna et al., 1992). Sampling and analytical methodologies included the use of sampling bags, charcoal tubes for the monitoring of VOCs and PAHs (analysis by chromatography, e.g. GC-MS or GC-FID), silica gel tubes for acid gases (high-pressure ion chromatography, HPIC), soda lime tubes for HCN (spectroscopy), or polymer tubes for aldehydes (GC-FID), or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with UV or diode-array detection (HPLC-UV-DAD). Analysis of particulate matter was also enhanced using cyclones or cascade impactors for investigating particle size distribution. During this time, long-term diffusion tubes (colorimetric tubes) were used together with continuous direct reading sensors or multigas analysers (for CO, CO2, and methane, CH4) (NIOSH, 1992a, b, 1994a; Materna et al., 1992; Naeher et al., 2006).\n\nThe implementation of more sophisticated analytical methods, principally spectroscopic and chromatographic methodologies (e.g. gas-phase Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, FTIR; gas chromatography-nitrogen–phosphorus detection, GC-NPD; high-resolution gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, HRGC-HRMS, atmospheric pressure gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, APGC-MS/MS; and high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet or fluorescence detection, HPLC-UV, HPLC-FL) allowed the quantification of standard pollutants with higher sensitivity (lower LODs/LOQs) and accuracy, thus extending analytical capacity to detect and quantify the presence of pollutants that could not previously be determined (e.g. PCBs, PBDEs, OPFRs, PCDD/Fs, etc.) (Organtini et al., 2015; Fent et al., 2020a). More recently, on-site, and real-time determination of the concentrations of airborne gaseous and particulate pollutants present in fire smoke has been achieved using portable, low-cost screening devices and sensors (e.g. multigas sensors and particle counting devices) with increasing selectivity and accuracy (Caban-Martinez et al., 2018; Alharbi et al., 2021; Nelson et al., 2021).\n\nThe use of sensor-based devices has been reported for a wide variety of air pollutants that can be detected at concentrations ranging from parts per million (ppm) to parts per billion (ppb). They include optical particle counters for measuring the size distribution of particles and electrochemical sensors used for quantitative determination of gases and vapours (CO, HCl, HCN, NO2, SO2, etc.) (Baxter et al., 2010; Reisen et al., 2011; Caban-Martinez et al., 2018; Alharbi et al., 2021; Nelson et al., 2021).\n\n[The use of these sensor devices has been an important breakthrough in the monitoring of firefighters’ occupational exposure to health-relevant pollutants during firefighting. Moreover, on-site and real-time portable sensors can be used in firefighters’ health surveillance programmes. However, these devices have several limitations that need to be considered, including cross sensitivity and interference from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind, and rain).]\n\n1.4.5. Biomarkers of exposure and considerations regarding absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion\n\nFirefighters are exposed to complex mixtures at the fire suppression scene. Personal exposures to these chemicals can take place via dermal contact, inhalation, and non-dietary ingestion; biomonitoring can be used to assess the internal dose of combustion-derived chemicals, and/or their metabolites (see Section 1.3.6) (WHO, 2015). provides a summary of exposure biomarkers that have been employed to assess firefighters’ exposures to noteworthy fire effluents, and a listing of studies that employed a variety of biomarkers.\n\nTable 1.20\n\nBiomarkers commonly used to assess firefighters’ exposures to selected fire effluents.\n\nThe informativeness of biomonitoring values depends on factors such as the physical and chemical properties of the substance, the route of chemical exposure (i.e. dermal contact, inhalation, and non-dietary ingestion), as well as factors that influence absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes. These processes collectively control delivery of the chemical or its metabolite to the site of toxic action (Bessems & Geraets, 2013). In addition, such considerations influence the selection of an appropriate biomarker, the biological matrix to sample, the timing of sample collection, and the appropriate analytical method (OECD, 2022).\n\n(a) Absorption\n\nAbsorption, which mechanistically controls bioavailability and internal dose, refers to processes that collectively move chemicals from the site of first contact (e.g. respiratory tract, dermal surface, gastrointestinal tract) to the bloodstream (Derendorf & Schmidt, 2019; Saghir, 2009).\n\nChemical absorption is affected by the exposure context (e.g. training versus emergency fire suppression), PPE use and post-use handling and storage, PPE design and efficiency (e.g. flash hood textile and design), site of contact (e.g. skin, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract), chemical form (e.g. vapour, particulate matter-adsorbed sVOCs), and firefighter duties (e.g. attack and knockdown, command and control).\n\nMany researchers have underscored the importance of dermal absorption of substances such as PAHs and VOCs, including absorption when using turnout gear and SCBA (Feunekes et al., 1997; Laitinen et al., 2010; Baxter et al., 2014; Fent et al., 2014, 2017, 2020b; Pleil et al., 2014; Fernando et al., 2016; Oliveira et al., 2016; Andersen et al., 2017; Andersen et al., 2018a; Stec et al., 2018; Wingfors et al., 2018; Cherry et al., 2019, 2021a; Wallace et al., 2019a; Burgess et al., 2020; Keir et al., 2020; Banks et al., 2021a). Absorption of dermally deposited chemicals encountered during fire suppression, including VOC vapours and sVOCs adsorbed to airborne particulate matter, depends on PPE design and use, location and thickness of exposed skin (e.g. face, neck, wrist, forehead), physical exertion and movement, and environmental temperature and humidity (Wester et al., 1990; WHO, 2006; Laitinen et al., 2010; NIOSH, 2013a; Baxter et al., 2014; Fent et al., 2014, 2017, 2020b; Andersen et al., 2018a; Stec et al., 2018; Sjöström et al., 2019b; Beitel et al., 2020; Keir et al., 2020; Rosting & Olsen, 2020).\n\nPulmonary absorption of inhaled chemicals, including VOCs (e.g. BTEX, methanol), sVOCs (e.g. PAHs with low molecular weight) and toxic gases (e.g. CO, NO2) can also occur despite the use of PPE such as SCBA (Aufderheide et al., 1993; Fent et al., 2014, 2015, 2020b; Wallace et al., 2019a). Specifically, pulmonary contact and absorption can occur in situations in which SCBA is less likely to be used (e.g. during overhaul), before donning SCBA, if the SCBA is improperly used, and/or if the SCBA is prematurely doffed (Bolstad-Johnson et al., 2000; Austin et al., 2001c; Burgess et al., 2001; Fent et al., 2014, 2015; Wallace et al., 2019a; Beitel et al., 2020; Burgess et al., 2020; Rosting & Olsen, 2020). Additionally, secondary inhalation exposure can occur via contact with soiled turnout gear (Baxter et al., 2014; Fent et al., 2014, 2015; Pleil et al., 2014; Burgess et al., 2020). With respect to particulate matter and substances adsorbed to particulate matter, absorption is governed by aerodynamic diameter. Large particles (i.e. ≥ 10 µm) are generally retained by the nasopharyngeal system, i.e. they do not enter the lungs. Particulate matter in the 5–10 µm range is generally removed by alveolar macrophages (Geiser, 2010). These particles can also be inadvertently ingested after mucociliary clearance and swallowing, with subsequent absorption in the gastrointestinal tract followed by first-pass hepatic metabolism (Ramesh et al., 2004; Pambianchi et al., 2021). Importantly, small particles (i.e. PM2.5) can penetrate the deeper regions of the pulmonary system. Particulate matter in the 1–2.5 µm range can interact with terminal bronchioles; those < 1 µm can readily gain access to alveoli (Schraufnagel, 2020). Particles < 0.1 µm have been shown to readily cross alveolar epithelia, thereby accessing the blood stream and systemic circulation (Schraufnagel, 2020). In comparison with transdermal absorption, pulmonary absorption can be rapid; thus, temporal patterns of excreted metabolites can be used to determine the relative influence of the different exposure routes (Feunekes et al., 1997; Caux et al., 2002; Laitinen et al., 2012; Pierrard, 2016; Cherry et al., 2019).\n\n(b) Distribution\n\nDistribution refers to the reversible movement of an absorbed chemical from the site of contact (Taveli & Bellera, 2018). Effective distribution is required to permit the use of haematological and urinary biomarkers of exposure (e.g. urinary PAH and benzene metabolites); substances that are absorbed via dermal or pulmonary contact can be rapidly distributed to the sites of metabolism or toxic action. Generally speaking, parent compounds can be detected in the blood; biomonitoring is commonly conducted using serum analyses (e.g. brominated flame retardants and PFAS, see Section 1.5.1(i)) (e.g. Shaw et al., 2013; Rotander et al., 2015a; Trowbridge et al., 2020; Mayer et al., 2021). Metabolites are commonly detected in the urine (for example, metabolites of PAHs and benzene) (see , e.g. Caux et al., 2002; NIOSH, 2013a; Adetona et al., 2017a; Keir et al., 2017; Rosting & Olsen, 2020; Bader et al., 2021; Cherry et al., 2021a). Levels of systemically distributed chemicals can also be monitored via collection and analysis of exhaled breath; particularly for short-term exposures (see , e.g. Pleil et al., 2014; Fent et al., 2015; Wallace et al., 2017; Mayer et al., 2022).\n\n(c) Metabolism and excretion\n\nMetabolism and excretion are controlled by a complex series of dynamic processes influenced by factors such as genotype, sex, age, diet, drug and alcohol consumption, co-exposures to therapeutic products and other chemicals, and disease (Johnson et al., 2012).\n\nThe rates of metabolism and excretion (i.e. metabolite terminal half-life) are critically important for determining the appropriate time interval between an exposure event and biomarker sample collection (Bader et al., 2021). Since terminal excretion half-lives of combustion-derived chemicals (e.g. benzene, PAHs, environmental phenols) are generally in the range of 4–16 hours, several research groups have highlighted the importance of rapid post-exposure collection of firefighter biomonitoring samples (Caux et al., 2002; Fent et al., 2015; Waldman et al., 2016; Bader et al., 2021). It can be difficult to evaluate the results of urine samples collected long after the exposure (Caux et al., 2002; Keir et al., 2017; Bader et al., 2021). For example, benzene is rapidly metabolized and cleared from the blood, permitting rapid appearance of metabolites in the urine (Rosting & Olsen, 2020); the terminal half-life of the benzene metabolite S-phenylmercapturic acid is only 9 hours (Bader et al., 2021). Similarly, urinary elimination half-lives for hydroxylated metabolites of phenanthrene, fluorene, and naphthalene are in the range of 3–8 hours (Oliveira et al., 2016; Keir et al., 2017). This is consistent with time-course analyses conducted by Rossbach et al. (2020), who reported post-training concentrations of urinary PAH metabolites with half-lives of 3.5–9.3 hours. Consequently, timely collection of biomonitoring samples is of paramount importance (Caux et al., 2002; Keir et al., 2017; Cherry et al., 2019, 2021a; Fent et al., 2020b; Bader et al., 2021). Urine analyses are not commonly used for biomonitoring of exposures to PAHs of higher molecular weight (e.g. benzo[a]pyrene), because these substances are primarily excreted via the bile and faeces (Motorykin et al., 2015) and are largely undetectable in the urine (Keir et al., 2017, 2021; Wingfors et al., 2018; Allonneau et al., 2019). Recently, new biomarkers have been used that can provide information on exposure to benzo[a]pyrene, such as 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (3-OH-BaP), the main urinary metabolite of benzo[a]pyrene (Alhamdow et al., 2019). However, this requires particularly sensitive analytical procedures, because the pathway for urinary excretion of this metabolite is much less significant than that for faecal excretion; this permits use of 3-OH-BaP only in settings with high exposures, such as occupational exposure of firefighters (Oliveira et al., 2017c).\n\nA recent published review on biomonitoring in firefighters indicated that the half-lives of noteworthy chemicals range from hours (e.g. PAH, VOC metabolites), to months or even years (e.g. PFAS, chemical flame retardants, see Section 1.5.1(i)) (Engelsman et al., 2020). There is considerable variability or uncertainty in published values for chemical half-lives, and by extension, determination of optimal timing for sample collection (Feunekes et al., 1997; Oliveira et al., 2016; Cherry et al., 2019). [The Working Group noted that there is a paucity of toxicokinetic data for many combustion-derived chemicals. Such data would facilitate interpretation of biomonitoring results in a firefighting context (Li et al., 2012; Oliveira et al., 2016, 2020b; Cherry et al., 2019; Engelsman et al., 2020). In particular, there is a need to critically examine how half-life values vary with different routes of exposure (i.e. transdermal, inhalation, and ingestion) (Li et al., 2012; Oliveira et al., 2016, 2020b).]\n\n(d) Biomarkers of exposure\n\nThe studies listed in collectively generated a large amount of biomarker data, particularly for urinary PAH metabolites. Although an extensive analysis of the available data was outside the scope of this section, some data patterns and deficiencies are highlighted here. Values for commonly used exposure biomarkers, e.g. 1-hydroxypyrene in urine and benzene in exhaled breath, were available from 67 studies. With respect to the predominant sources of the data, the majority of the studies were conducted in the USA (63%), followed by Canada (14%). Most of the studies (83%) involved career firefighters, and roughly half of the studies investigated structure fires. Almost 60% of the studies considered urinary biomarkers and nearly all the remaining studies examined exhaled breath (16%) or blood (18%).\n\nshows post-exposure changes in urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (µg/g creatinine); all the studies included in the analyses noted post-suppression increases (i.e. a fold-change of > 1.0). Seven studies noted relatively small fold-change increases (i.e. < 2) (Feunekes et al., 1997; Moen & Øvrebø, 1997; Adetona et al., 2017a, 2019; Andersen et al., 2017, 2018a; Cherry et al., 2021a); of those, three examined wildland firefighters (Adetona et al., 2017a, 2019; Cherry et al., 2021a). None of the studies that examined wildland firefighters noted fold-changes of > 2. Five studies noted fold-change increases of > 5 (Caux et al., 2002; Wingfors et al., 2018; Fent et al., 2019a, 2020b; Rossbach et al., 2020); all examined structural firefighters. The majority of studies that noted fold-change values of > 5 measured urinary hydroxypyrene levels in samples collected 3–12 hours post-exposure. This observation is well aligned with the aforementioned half-life range (i.e. 3–9.3 hours) for PAHs of low molecular weight (Oliveira et al., 2016; Keir et al., 2017; Rossbach et al., 2020). shows the distribution of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene levels in firefighters before and after firefighting. The data indicated that, on average, levels post-exposure are 3.3-fold those pre-exposure; pre- and post-exposure levels are significantly different at P < 0.0001.\n\nFig. 1.15\n\nUrinary concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene in firefighters before and after suppression of naval, structural, or wildland fires\n\nFig. 1.16\n\nDistribution of urinary concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene in firefighters before and after fire suppression\n\nshows post-exposure changes in the level of benzene in exhaled breath. Post-exposure fold-change values (i.e. post- versus pre-exposure) varied from 0.82 to 23.08 µg/m3; 22 of the 26 values reflect a post-exposure increase (i.e. fold-change > 1.0). Twelve of the 26 values presented indicated a fold-change (i.e. post- versus pre-exposure) > 2; more than half of these (i.e. 7 out of 12) are associated with a sampling time point < 1 hour post-exposure (NIOSH, 2013a; Fent et al., 2020b; Pleil et al., 2014; Mayer et al., 2022). Indeed, all fold-change values for post-exposure sampling < 1 hour are > 1.0 (i.e. post-exposure increase in benzene in exhaled breath), with an average of 7.1 ± 2.3 µg/m3 (n = 12). The sampling time-point effect was significant at P < 0.03. This is consistent with the rapid absorption, distribution, and exhalation of VOCs such as benzene (US EPA, 1998).\n\nFig. 1.17\n\nChanges in benzene concentrations in exhaled breath of firefighters before and before fire suppression\n\n[The Working Group noted that although it is clear that biomonitoring is a valuable tool for assessment of firefighters’ exposure to combustion-derived chemicals, it is also clear that numerous factors need to be carefully considered when designing an effective biomonitoring study and when interpreting biomarker measurements in a fire suppression context. Factors that need to be considered when evaluating biomarker responses include sex, hydration level, primary route of exposure, type of fire, and the participant’s role in fire suppression, as well as the substance’s physical and chemical properties, environmental fate, and biological half-life.]\n\n1.5.1. Chemicals and physical factors\n\n(a) Asbestos and other minerals and fibres\n\nAsbestos (IARC Group 1, carcinogenic to humans) is a mineral fibre used for its insulating properties in homes, businesses, and other structures that were mostly built before the 1980s. Because asbestos is ubiquitous in so many older structures, it may be encountered by firefighters during fires or other emergency incidents during which building materials are disturbed (see ). Fire and high temperature can break down composite materials and liberate the asbestos fibres that they contain. Asbestos fibres directly exposed to high temperatures (> 400 °C) may also break down, resulting in shorter aspect ratios and less pathogenicity (Hoskins & Brown, 1994; Jeyaratnam & West, 1994).\n\nTable 1.21\n\nStudies in which exposure monitoring was performed for compounds other than fire smokea.\n\nTable S1.22 (Annex 1, Supplementary material for Section 1, Exposure Characterization, online only, available from: https://publications.iarc.fr/615) provides measures of asbestos in air and on surfaces associated with firefighting. During overhaul, firefighters will commonly tear down walls, ceilings, flooring, and other materials, which could disturb materials containing asbestos. In an evaluation of firefighter exposures during overhaul of structure fires in Arizona, USA, asbestos fibres were detected in 15 of 46 air samples, with an average of 0.073 fibres per cm3, suggesting that firefighters who were not wearing respiratory protection during overhaul could inhale asbestos fibres (Bolstad Johnson et al., 2000). Asbestos may also be used in roofing materials. A factory fire in England released into the atmosphere chrysotile fibres (contained in asbestos bitumen paper covering the roof), which were later detected on firefighters’ clothing and in the surrounding environment (Bridgman, 2001). Another study attempted to measure asbestiform fibres on used firefighter turnout gear from Kentucky, USA, and found evidence of actinolite and chrysotile in four of 29 surface samples, although only one sample quantified asbestos fibres (chrysotile) above the LOD for the method (1570 fibre structures per cm2) (Hwang et al., 2019b). [Asbestos on firefighting gear could pose an inhalation hazard if the contamination were to be agitated and become airborne.]\n\n[The Working Group noted that microscopy methods used to measure asbestiform fibres on air filters are vulnerable to interference from other substances that may also have been collected on the filter, which is likely to occur during many firefighting activities.]\n\nAsbestos can also contaminate outdoor sites or soils. A NIOSH evaluation assessed wildland firefighters’ exposures to asbestiform fibres in Libby, Montana, USA (a former site for vermiculite mines), and found task-based concentrations of 0.0013–0.13 fibres per cm3 (NIOSH, 2019). [Contamination of soils with naturally occurring asbestos fibres is not expected to be common in most regions of the world.]\n\nIn addition to asbestos, firefighters can be exposed to other minerals, including crystalline silica (see ). [The Working Group noted the paucity of literature on silica exposure in municipal firefighters but acknowledges the potential for silica exposure.] A study of wildland firefighters’ exposures during prescribed burns and naturally occurring fires found that fire personnel were exposed to respirable quartz at concentrations that frequently exceeded the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3, especially after adjusting for longer shifts (Reinhardt & Broyles, 2019). Firefighters can also be exposed to man-made vitreous fibres, which are fibrous inorganic materials made from rock, slag, clay, or glass (IARC, 2002). Dust samples collected from the areas surrounding the WTC disaster and from the Grenfell Tower fire contained man-made vitreous fibres (ATSDR, 2002; Lioy et al., 2002; Stec et al., 2019).\n\n(b) Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances\n\nPFAS are a class of synthetic chemicals that have been used in commercial and industrial products and processes for nearly a century (US EPA, 2021a). By the 1960s, PFAS were integral in the development of a firefighting foam known as AFFF and soon after were incorporated as waterproofing agents into textiles (ITRC, 2020).\n\nAFFFs are often used on fires involving flammable liquids or vapours (known as “class B” fires), such as jet fuel. The PFAS surfactants in AFFFs are designed to lower the surface tension, allowing the foam to quickly spread across and smother the burning liquid. AFFFs are more effective at suppressing liquid fires than is water, and they have the added benefits of reducing the water requirements and runoff potential (Magrabi et al., 2002).\n\nIn the past two decades, specific compounds used in the production of AFFFs have shifted from longer carbon chain formulae, such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), to shorter and alternative formulae, such as perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) and hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA), because of emerging toxicity data and concerns over the bioaccumulation of longer-chain PFAS (Brase et al., 2021).\n\nAlthough the contribution of specific pathways to a firefighter’s absorbed dose is not fully understood, PFAS exposure could result from dust and products of combustion present at a fire scene; contact with firefighting foam, and PPE in which PFAS is an intentionally added component; or contaminated fire station dust (Tao et al., 2008; Shaw et al., 2013; Leary et al., 2020; Peaslee et al., 2020; Young et al., 2021). There is also the potential for firefighters to be exposed through local contamination of water with AFFF. For example, use of AFFF at fire stations, including those at airports, military bases, and training facilities, has contributed to PFAS contamination in groundwater, soil, and other surfaces (de Solla et al., 2012; Backe et al., 2013; Baduel et al., 2015; Hansen et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016).\n\nFor many firefighters, AFFF may be the most significant source of exposure to PFAS, as supported by several biomonitoring studies in firefighters (Laitinen et al., 2014; Rotander et al., 2015b; Leary et al., 2020). A few studies have suggested a positive association between biological levels of PFAS and years of firefighting (Rotander et al., 2015b; Graber et al., 2021). However, because long-chain PFAS are being removed from AFFF formulations, biological levels of PFAS in firefighters who use class B foams may begin to decline (Rotander et al., 2015b). See Section 1.5.1(i) for more details on biomonitoring studies of firefighters using AFFF.\n\nBecause PFAS has been used in various commercial products, including stain-resistant carpeting and furniture, structure fires may also be associated with exposure to and contamination with PFAS. Many of the studies that have evaluated municipal firefighters’ exposure to PFAS have involved biological monitoring (Tao et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2011; Shaw et al., 2013; Leary et al., 2020; Trowbridge et al., 2020; Clarity et al., 2021), and a few of these studies found associations between recent fire events or duration of exposure and specific types of PFAS in the blood (Tao et al., 2008; Shaw et al., 2013). See Section 1.5.1(i) for more information on biological levels of PFAS in firefighters.\n\nPFAS could also be present in firefighting textiles either as part of the manufacturing process or as contamination acquired during firefighting. Evaluation of PFAS in turnout gear confirmed measurable levels of several types of PFAS in textiles. The highest levels of PFAS were found in the outer shell and moisture barriers, with evidence of migration across the protective layers in used turnout gear (Peaslee et al., 2020). Studies have also detected PFAS in dust collected from turnout-gear storage areas in fire stations, with some types of PFAS being present in higher concentrations than in dust from living areas of those fire stations (Peaslee et al., 2020; Young et al., 2021) (see , and Table S1.22, Annex 1, Supplementary material for Section 1, Exposure Characterization, online only, available from: https://publications.iarc.fr/615).\n\n(c) Chemical flame retardants\n\nFurnishings and other items containing foams, plastics, and other synthetic materials can be highly flammable. One way the furniture, textile, and electronics industries have addressed this flammability issue is by adding chemical flame retardants to their products. PBDEs were one of the first classes of chemical flame retardant to be used, starting in the 1970s (Barbauskas, 1983; McKenna et al., 2018). Use has dwindled and even been banned completely in some countries because of their persistence, ability to accumulate in the body, and toxicological effects. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants classified several congeners as persistent organic pollutants in 2009 and decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) in 2017 (Secretariat of the Stockholm Convention, 2019b). Other brominated flame retardants listed for elimination in the Stockholm Convention are hexabromobiphenyl and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD). Several countries (e.g. China, India, Japan, and the USA) are making significant strides towards eliminating the use of these compounds. The European Union has almost completely banned the use of PBDEs, hexabromobiphenyl, and HBCDD (Sharkey et al., 2020). However, other chemical flame retardants are still being used globally, including OPFRs and other chlorinated and brominated flame retardants, in products such as foam insulation for buildings (Lee et al., 2016; Chupeau et al., 2020; Estill et al., 2020). The estimated global consumption of flame retardants in Asia, Europe, and the USA was 2.8 million tonnes in 2018 (Yasin et al., 2016).\n\nprovides a summary of flame retardant measurements in area air and on surfaces associated with firefighting (see also Table S1.22, Annex 1, Supplementary material for Section 1, Exposure Characterization, online only, available from: https://publications.iarc.fr/615). Firefighters can potentially be exposed to all classes of flame retardant if the fires they respond involve furnishings and other items containing these compounds (such as building insulation), which will depend in part on the rules and regulations of the country where the firefighters work (Sharkey et al., 2020). Fent et al. (2020a) measured a variety of PBDEs, other brominated flame retardants, and OPFRs in the air during the live-fire portion of controlled residential fires containing modern furnishings in the USA; results included BDE-209 (median, 15.6 µg/m3), 2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (EH-TBB; median, 7.71 µg/m3), and triphenyl phosphate (median, 408 µg/m3). These substances were also detected in almost every wipe sample collected from the turnout jackets and gloves worn by the responding firefighters. Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) was also detected with high frequency on turnout jackets and gloves (Fent et al., 2020a).\n\nOther studies have measured flame-retardant contaminants on firefighting clothing from the USA and Australia (Alexander & Baxter, 2016; Easter et al., 2016; Mayer et al., 2019; Banks et al., 2021c). Studies have also measured flame retardants in dust collected in fire stations from Australia, Canada, and the USA (Brown et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2015; Banks et al., 2020; Gill et al., 2020b); some of these studies found higher levels of certain flame retardants (e.g. BDE-209 and TDCPP) than in dust collected from other occupational settings (Shen et al., 2015; Gill et al., 2020b).\n\nFirefighters’ turnout gear could also contain flame retardants added during manufacture. Alexander & Baxter (2016) measured BDE-209 from unused gloves and a knit hood available at that time in the USA (< 1 µg/g per sample). In 2019, investigators analysed new knit hoods in the USA and found that they contained no detectable flame retardants (Mayer et al., 2019). More recently, new turnout gear from South Africa was found to contain PBDEs at > 200 µg/g and HBCDD at < 0.1 µg/g (Mokoana et al., 2021). [The Working Group noted that manufacture of turnout gear with textiles containing flame retardants may have been more common in the past than today. However, the study from South Africa suggested that manufacturers may still be producing turnout gear using textiles containing flame retardants in certain regions of the world.]\n\nBiomonitoring has also been used to assess firefighters’ exposure to flame retardants. Cross-sectional biomonitoring studies of firefighters in the USA have found elevated serum concentrations of certain PBDEs (e.g. BDE-99 and BDE-209) and elevated urinary concentrations of certain OPFRs (e.g. metabolites of triphenyl phosphate and TDCPP) compared with the general population (Shaw et al., 2013; Park et al., 2015; Jayatilaka et al., 2017). In the study by Fent et al. (2020a), firefighters experienced significant increases in urinary concentrations of metabolites of triphenyl phosphate, TDCPP, and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate after firefighting (Mayer et al., 2021). See Section 1.5.1(i) for more information on biological levels of flame retardants measured in firefighters.\n\n(d) Diesel engine exhaust\n\nFirefighters can be exposed to diesel exhaust (IARC Group 1, carcinogenic to humans) at the fire station, when fire engines (or apparatus) are started in the bays or return to the bays after a response, and at incidents where fire engines commonly idle. Diesel exhaust is composed of particulate matter, PAHs, inorganic particles, and oxides of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (Pronk et al., 2009). The magnitude and composition of diesel exhaust exposures will depend on several factors, including the age and maintenance of the engines, the quality of diesel fuel (e.g. sulfur content), whether the engine includes any filtration systems, the workload or number of runs, whether the engine is running cold or warm, whether diesel-exhaust capture systems are available and being used in the bays, and if not, whether the bays include natural ventilation (e.g. drive-through bays with doors on the front and back) (Chung et al., 2020). Another important factor for living quarters of the station that are attached to the bay is whether they are under positive pressure relative to the bay [if not, there is the potential for diesel exhaust to migrate into the living areas] (NIOSH, 2016b).\n\nRecent studies have quantified diesel exhaust in fire stations by measuring airborne elemental carbon (see , and Table S1.22, Annex 1, Supplementary material for Section 1, Exposure Characterization, online only, available from: https://publications.iarc.fr/615). Work-shift concentrations measured in fire stations have varied considerably and are generally higher in engine bays than in other areas of the fire station. One evaluation at fire stations in the USA measured elemental carbon concentrations in the engine bays at < 1–13 µg/m3, with concentrations in the living areas ranging from 1.2 to 2.7 µg/m3 (NIOSH, 2016b). A study in Canada measured elemental carbon in vehicle bays at concentrations ranging from < 0.5 to 2.7 µg/m3 (Chung et al., 2020). A study in Australia measured elemental carbon at concentrations ranging from 1 to 26 µg/m3 in vehicle bays, with much lower levels in the dormitories (< 2 µg/m3). The same study quantified total PAHs (predominantly naphthalene) at concentrations ranging from ~0.05 to ~1.8 µg/m3 in the engine bays (Bott et al., 2017). No studies have specifically quantified diesel exhaust exposure at emergency incidents, but one study involving controlled residential fires measured particulate matter at > 100 000 particles/m3 before fire ignition, which the investigators attributed to the idling fire apparatus (engine) at the scene (Fent et al., 2018).\n\n(e) Heavy metals\n\nFirefighters can be exposed to heavy metals (some of which are classified as IARC Group 1, carcinogenic to humans; see ). For example, vehicle fires would be expected to include a variety of heavy metals (present in the engine, battery, frame, and body parts), but metals could also be present in many other fires, especially fires involving older homes with lead paint or pipes or structures containing metal trusses or electronics. Airborne metal particulates or fumes produced during fires may be inhaled.\n\nprovides a summary of air and surface measurements of metals associated with firefighting (see also Table S1.22, Annex 1, Supplementary material for Section 1, Exposure Characterization, online only, available from: https://publications.iarc.fr/615). Keir et al. (2020) measured air concentrations of lead and found levels above the adjusted occupational exposure limit (OEL; 46.9 µg/m3) during two emergency fires in Ottawa, Canada; they also found significant increases in lead and antimony contamination on used turnout gear. Easter et al. (2016) measured metals in used firefighting hoods compared with new hoods in Philadelphia, USA, and found elevated concentrations of numerous metals, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead. Engelsman et al. (2019) measured metals on surfaces in Australian fire stations and found levels of chromium, lead, copper, zinc, nickel, and manganese that were higher than levels measured in homes or offices.\n\nThe presence of metals on firefighter gear and other surfaces does not necessarily mean that firefighters will absorb those contaminants; most metals have relatively low skin permeation coefficients (Kp, 0.001 cm/hour or less). However, there are numerous factors that can impact the permeability of metals through skin, including the valence state, the type of counter ion, and the nature of the chemical bond (organic versus inorganic) and polarity (Hostynek, 2003). [Metals and other contaminants on gear or surfaces could also become aerosolized and inhaled, or transfer to hands and be ingested, depending on hand hygiene practices after firefighting.]\n\nBiomonitoring has also been used to assess firefighters’ exposure to metals including lead, e.g. during the WTC disaster and the Notre Dame Cathedral fire, in Paris, France (see Section 1.5.1(i)).\n\n(f) Physical factors\n\nPhysical exertion and heat stress are common among municipal and wildland firefighters (Cheung et al., 2010; Bourlai et al., 2012; Lui et al., 2014; Horn et al., 2018). Municipal firefighting ensembles, which are designed to protect firefighters from heat, will also trap metabolic heat energy produced during work and may result in increased core body temperatures (Smith et al., 2013a; Horn et al., 2018; Ghiyasi et al., 2020). Strenuous work under high-stress situations, together with increased body temperature and dehydration, may affect the sympathetic nervous system and result in cardiovascular strain (Shen & Zipes, 2014; Smith et al., 2019). How these physical stressors could impact carcinogenesis is not well understood; however, increased body and skin temperatures may result in increased dermal absorption of toxicants (Chang & Riviere, 1991; Chang et al., 1994), and dehydration can concentrate hazardous substances in the body and may place additional strain on the kidneys (Baetjer et al., 1960; Baetjer, 1969). In addition, thermoregulatory processes in the body that are part of the immune response against toxicological insults may also be affected by heat strain (Leon, 2008).\n\n[Although the Working Group was unable to identify studies describing firefighters’ UV exposure, firefighters working outdoors or working in areas with a high UV index are also likely to be exposed to UV radiation (classified in IARC Group 1) (Peters et al., 2012; Carey et al., 2014; Boniol et al., 2015).] PAHs and UV exposure may have synergistic toxic effects through photoactivation (Ekunwe et al., 2005; Toyooka & Ibuki, 2007). [Wildland firefighters will commonly spend an entire work shift (8 hours or longer) under the sun. Although their arms and legs are typically covered by protective clothing, their necks and faces may be exposed. With the growing wildfire season in various parts of the world, cumulative UV exposure is likely to worsen for wildland firefighters.]\n\nFirefighters are also exposed to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (IARC Group 2B, probably carcinogenic to humans) from the use of hand radios. [The Working Group noted that hand radios are not typically held close to the head, and the effects of radiofrequencies on the human body (e.g. increased skin temperature) drop with increasing distance (Foster & Glaser, 2007).]\n\nIn relatively rare situations, firefighters respond to radiological events, such as a dirty bomb, in which their roles could include triage, life support, and decontamination, and during which they could be exposed to ionizing radiation (Rebmann et al., 2019). One of the most well-known radiological disasters was the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in present-day Ukraine in 1986. Numerous studies have documented radiation health effects among firefighters and other workers who responded to the Chernobyl disaster (Junk et al., 1999; Antoniv et al., 2017; Belyi et al., 2019). Fallout from the disaster resulted in radionuclide contamination in the exclusion zone, which presents an additional hazard for wildland firefighters (Yoschenko et al., 2006). Wildland firefighters who responded to a forest fire in the Chernobyl exclusion zone in April–May 2020 were reported to have effective internal dose maximum values of 3.5, 5.1, and 11.8 µSv, depending on the region in which they worked (Bazyka et al., 2020). Radionuclides also occur naturally in soil and vegetation. Carvalho et al. (2014) measured polonium-210 activity in wildfire smoke in Portugal; the average concentration was 70 mBq/m3, which could theoretically result in a radiation dose for wildland firefighters of ~2.1 µSv per 10-hour workday. However, Viner et al. (2018) conducted modelling of cumulative dose for firefighters in areas of natural and anthropogenic contamination (i.e. Savannah River Site, South Carolina, USA) and found that even under worst-case conditions, the cumulative dose for firefighters exposed to potential fires would not exceed 3% of the annual guidance limit set by the US Department of Energy (0.25 mSv).\n\nFirefighters are also commonly exposed to loud noise from alarms, sirens, personal alert safety systems, and heavy equipment and machinery (Tubbs, 1995; Hong & Samo, 2007; Kirkham et al., 2011; Neitzel et al., 2013). Wildland firefighters may use chainsaws, chippers, and even bulldozers, which can easily exceed OELs for noise (e.g. the NIOSH recommended exposure limit of 85 dB) (Broyles et al., 2017). Wildland firefighters are expected to wear hearing protection when performing tasks using this equipment; however, training on proper use and maintenance of hearing protection may vary throughout the fire service (Broyles et al., 2019).\n\n(g) Building collapse and other catastrophic events\n\nThere were few studies reporting on the non-fire exposures received by firefighters at other major natural or man-made disasters. These publications are summarized in . The incidents reported in these studies include: earthquakes (where predominant exposures are assumed to be dust and particulates from collapsed buildings, or release of radioisotopes, e.g. Fukushima, Japan) (Chang et al., 2003; Fushimi, 2012; Caban-Martinez et al., 2021; Ory et al., 2021); explosions (encompassing exposures to dust, particulates, and debris in addition to products of combustion) (Slottje et al., 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008; Witteveen et al., 2007; De Soir et al., 2015); severe weather events, e.g. hurricanes (covering exposure to biologically contaminated floodwater, debris, etc.) (Tak et al., 2007); radiological events (Ory et al., 2021); chemical terrorism (e.g. the sarin nerve-agent attack in the Tokyo subway, Japan, in 1995) (Li et al., 2004); and chemical spills (encompassing exposure to specific chemical agents) (Cho et al., 2013).\n\nTable 1.23\n\nExamples of firefighters’ exposures during catastrophic non-fire events.\n\nMany publications (e.g. Witteveen et al., 2007; Fushimi, 2012) on non-fire exposures in firefighters have also solely focused on assessing firefighters’ response to trauma by following the mental health outcomes of those attending the incident.\n\n[The Working Group noted that there was lack of data on exposure during catastrophic events. For the site of the WTC disaster, none of the samples were collected in the immediate aftermath.]\n\nThe majority of studies on firefighters’ chemical and physical exposures and their health outcomes were focused on the WTC terrorist attack (Claudio, 2001; Landrigan, 2001; Guidotti et al., 2011). Firefighters who responded to the WTC disaster had substantial and repeated exposures to dense, aerosolized dust and smoke (Nordgren et al., 2002). They were exposed to the plume created from the initial fire and building collapses, to ongoing fires that lasted at least 3 months, and to particles that were resuspended during the clean-up and transport of debris. The destruction of the WTC complex pulverized ~1.2 million tonnes of construction material (Klitzman & Freudenberg, 2003; Rom et al., 2010). This material was primarily composed of gypsum and contained calcium carbonate, silicate, and sulfate, as well as various metals. Half of the South Tower had been insulated with chrysotile asbestos (which was found in the rubble) and millions of tonnes of fibrous glass. Collapse of the twin towers (WTC 1 and WTC 2), and then of a third building (WTC 7), produced an enormous dust cloud containing coarse and fine particulate matter (Lioy et al., 2002; Rom et al., 2010).\n\nThe predominant sources of toxic gases to which firefighters were exposed included by-products of combustion or pyrolysis from burning jet fuel. The secondary reactions of these combustion products, and of those produced from the burning, vaporization, and pulverization of materials within the towers, produced an array of irritant gases, fumes, and vapours (Landrigan et al., 2004). Specific fire effluent gases measured included VOCs, HCl, PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs, PCDD/Fs), phthalate esters, etc. (Lioy et al., 2002; Litten et al., 2003; McGee et al., 2003; Offenberg et al., 2003; Landrigan et al., 2004; Dahlgren et al., 2007; Guidotti et al., 2011).\n\nEnvironmental data have shown that particulate matter originating from the WTC disaster differed in composition to ambient particulate matter, being mainly composed of debris from construction buildings and therefore containing concrete, pulverized glass, calcium sulfate (gypsum) and silicates, mineral glass fibres, alkaline metals, wood, paper, cotton, and components of jet fuel (Landrigan, 2001; Lioy et al., 2002; McKinney et al., 2002; Banauch et al., 2003; Landrigan et al., 2004; Lippmann et al., 2015).\n\nIn data on ambient air pollution reported by nearby regional monitoring stations, airborne particulate matter mass concentrations were measured in only one or two size bands: PM2.5 (diameter, ≤ 2.5 µm) and/or PM10 (diameter, ≤ 10 µm) (McGee et al., 2003; Guidotti et al., 2011). Concentrations of a mixture of airborne, respirable particulate matter were between 1 and 100 mg/m3 (Weiden et al., 2015).\n\nAdditionally, more than 95% of the mass of WTC dust particles were found to be larger than 10 µm in diameter. The high content of pulverized cement made the dust highly caustic, with a pH in the range of 9 to 11 (Lioy et al., 2002; Banauch et al., 2003; Landrigan et al., 2004). In addition to fibrous and alkaline materials, samples of larger WTC particulate matter also contained various metals (Landrigan et al., 2004; Moline et al., 2006). Samples of smaller particular matter (i.e. PM2.5) predominantly contained calcium (or calcium carbonate/bicarbonate), chlorine, and sulfuric oxide compounds originating from construction materials such as cement, concrete aggregate, ceiling tiles, and wallboards (Clark et al., 2001; Edelman et al., 2003; Gavett, 2003).\n\nOne study of the building collapse in June 2021 in Surfside, Florida, USA, deployed silicone-based wristbands to measure ambient PAHs around the building pile. Wristbands were placed on the southern, western, and northern perimeters of the building collapse before the controlled demolition. A total of 29 wristbands were deployed for ambient sampling around the collapse, and the PAHs found at highest concentrations were phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene. Wristbands were found to be a useful passive sampling device to document levels of various PAHs in the immediate environment of the building collapse where urban search and rescue firefighters were working (Caban-Martinez et al., 2021).\n\n(h) Other exposures\n\nHundreds of combustion by-products may be produced during fires, especially fires that contain various materials and chemistries. This section has covered some of the most common combustion by-products likely to be encountered by firefighters, but there are certainly others that could pose long-term health risks. The locations where firefighters work may result in other occupational exposures. For example, airport firefighters may have additional exposures from aircraft (i.e. jet engines), which are known to produce ultrafine particulate matter and other pollutants (Stacey, 2019).\n\nOne area of ongoing research is firefighters’ exposure to dioxins and furans. PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs may be produced when burning certain types of material, including halogenated polymers and electronics. For example, Organtini et al. (2015) measured several mixed halogenated dibenzofurans (PXDFs) and PBDFs in fire debris (at levels of parts per million) from simulated household fires (which included furnishing and electronics). Electronics may also contain PCBs (some classified in IARC Group 1), which are another class of hazardous compounds to which firefighters may be exposed. See Section 1.3.1 for more information on the possible sources of these compounds during firefighting.\n\nOnly a few studies have evaluated firefighters’ exposures to PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs, and PCBs (see , and Table S1.22, Annex 1, Supplementary material for Section 1, Exposure Characterization, online only, available from: https://publications.iarc.fr/615), and most involved biological monitoring. 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-Heptachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (HpCDD) has been detected on firefighting equipment and clothing (Hsu et al., 2011) and measured in serum samples from firefighters in California, USA, and fire investigators in Taiwan, China, at concentrations above those for the referent general population (Hsu et al., 2011; Shaw et al., 2013).
