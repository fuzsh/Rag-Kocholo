        "text": "this is one of the best stories I've read here on RR. The characters feel like people, who screw up often. The main character's main advantage isn't overpowered and solve every issue, and it's kind of a \"powerful entity empowers the hero to fight evil\" thing, which means against the main threat he's extremely good for his lv, but against anything else he has no advantages he didn't make himself. The treat is established as extremely dangerous from the beginning by drop kicking the empire the MC \"arrives\" in to death (he shows up outside a newly established colony that they eventually flee to. The character has a unique build I haven't really seen anywhere else. sure I've seen defense focused characters, but only one other character who says screw it to balanced stats like Tilly does, and that person is a magic user (hell difficulty tutorial) and he does this for a reason, and the decision to do it isn't made lightly. I've never seen the author leave a thread dangling that it would make sense to follow up on (a potential one was yanked back into the story a bit ago) There is also a clear, logical direction for the story to go, and it doesn't meander towards it. The characters get mental health breaks. The grammar is great, and the author is quick to fix issues when they're pointed out.\n\nWhy are you still reading reviews? go read the story.\n\nFive stars because it’s worth trying at least. It’s better than a lot of other stuff on the site.\n\nThe spelling and grammar is good, and the writing style is well done. The world is somewhat generic, however, more a collection of tropes, I didn’t really see anything brand new.\n\nMy first issue is that apparently the mc has been revived with a message from god to be as self sacrificing as possible, which cheapens the novel when “heroic sacrifice” is such a strong theme. When it happens over and over again it loses dramatic effect, and the mc basically always takes the “noble” cause of action, because he’s literally been told by god “here, this is what’s right”.\n\nThe novel is also extremely stylistically disjointed for me, the plot functions on about 3 layers of gods at any time, and jumps from samurai rabbits to vampiric knights of the round table, a world consuming plague cult, and now a dragon fighting for some other form of godhood? It just feels like new things keep getting shoehorned in at every turn just for the sake of having something new.\n\nIt’s definitely still worth trying, maybe it’ll work for you. It didn’t for me though.\n\nFollow a down to earth, authentically human feeling (flaws, hopes, and awkward questions included) protagonist next door as he stumbles his way into a world altering plot. He's white knuckling it through and he'll have to find creative ways to use what he knows to get the job done, and maybe find some realntoilet paper while he's at it.\n\nCome for a firefighter turned hero fighting for one more shot at redemption, stay for the engaging, approachable writing and the funny authors notes. This deserves to hit trending\n\nI was intrigued by the idea of a fireman isekai and the story is going above and beyond any of my initial expectations for the story. I love the characters personality and the story adds some much more to the isekai genre. I read books for good tropes that make up my favorite stories. He made my favorites better, different, and added something new to most isekai plots. I love the story so it will be the story that I will now go continue binging instead of doing homework."
