        "text": "I recently had a chance to meet one of my favorite character actors, Wes Studi, and chat about his new movie Planes: Fire & Rescue, wherein he voices the rescue chopper Windlifter. Perhaps the foremost Native American screen actor working today, Studi burst onto the scene thanks to roles in Dances With Wolves, The Last of the Mohicans, and Geronimo: An American Legend. Studi later managed to move into more mainstream, non-period roles thanks to genre movies such as Heat, Street Fighter and Avatar. He was most recently seen in Seth MacFarlane's comedy A Million Ways to Die in the West.\n\nHere's what Studi had to say about working on Planes: Fire & Rescue, Street Fighter and more. IGN: What was the big draw for you to Planes: Fire & Rescue as your first animated feature?\n\nWes Studi: Well, I had always been a fan of Cars, because Cars made a huge outreach in terms of getting their little cars out to Chevron stations and such way back. My son has an entire collection because we did a lot of business at Chevron, right? So we would always get a car. So I think he has the entire collection of Cars. Then that sort of morphed into Planes. Then Planes 2 came along -- actually, I think we started before Planes came out. That was about four years ago when we started on Planes 2. I liked the script. I liked the fact that it was really an all-ages kind of film. It addresses the kids, if you will, who are interested in animation, of course. But it's simply not a cartoon. It has a good story about real-life activities that happen. It just so happens that we're dealing with humanized, mechanical images. But they deal with everything that the firefighting community has to deal with in terms of bureaucracies and funding and how they can keep on doing what they signed up to do. That's what makes it an all-ages kind of story. Certainly, it pays homage to those firefighters -- not only the American Indian, who in our story is highlighted by the part of Windlifter in it -- and I think that was the result of the amount of research they did and finding out that the southwest district of firefighters, the American Indian makes up something like 60% of the firefighting community. So I think it's a good tribute to the American Indians involved, but the entire firefighting forces that are in our district.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nIGN: Tell us a little bit about Windlifter. He does seem to have a sixth sense, at least that's how they're playing it up in the movie.\n\nStudi: Yeah, he has a sixth sense, but it's one born of experience, which -- if you ask me -- most sixth senses are not only an ability, but the will to listen to things that aren't of human making. There's a particular reason that leaves wilt. There's a reason that waters stay still, like a weather change, a barometric change, things like that. Those are just some of things that are attributed to the American Indian in that listening to those things around you, seeing what is happening in the environment, is cause to know that this could possibly happen because it's cause and effect. Everything is related in its action and interaction -- cause and effect. Many times, that's referred to as a \"sixth sense.\" Then knowing human nature -- that's a part of the whole thing as well. You know, if this happens, this is probably going to happen.\n\nIGN: Right -- education, but also intuition mixed in. I wanted to ask you, do you think -- you know, all films of the past, including Disney animated films, are not the most racially sensitive movies. Do you think animation has gotten better at portraying diversity?\n\nStudi: I think so, and I believe that Disney has been more or less at the forefront of moving animation in that direction. You know, it's a matter of education. It's a matter of people knowing that these kinds of concerns are prevalent in society and within one group, say, like any of the social issues that you could bring up at this point in time. But I think they've made a real effort, and it shows in their product now. IGN: You've carved out this whole cult following with genre movies that a lot of our audience also knows you from, whether it's Deep Rising, Street Fighter, Heat, Avatar. Did that kind of cult following from genre films surprise you?\n\nStudi: Well, I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to, if you will, cross over into being known as an actor, rather than an American Indian actor or a Cherokee actor. I think the goal of every actor is to be able to play non-ethnic specific roles. But I'll always remember that the American Indian roles -- or \"leathers and feathers,\" as I call them -- can be extremely important to those who are just starting out in the business, because it's an image-driven kind of business. Well, if this is your image, then it fits into what the American Indian looks like right? So that's your best chance at work, which is really the bottom line of it all: securing work. So you use your image as well as your training to do so. The fact that I've been able to do, like, Mystery Men, Heat and films like that is absolute gravy on the whole meal.\n\nIGN: We're a big video game site, so Street Fighter has this real cult following with our readership. Do you have any particular memories of making Street Fighter or of the role of Sagat?\n\nStudi: Oh, nice! [Laughs] Well, Sagat has to wear an eyepatch, right? It took me the longest time, until someone suggested to me that what you can do with the eyepatch is put a small, tiny, almost unnoticeable little hole in it, and that allows the eye to have light get to it. At that point, you can regain your equilibrium, because once you try walking around and doing fighting scenes or even dialogue and everything, your equilibrium can begin to not work with you when you only have one eye. So the fact that you put in even a tiny little whole into that eyepatch evens you back out.\n\nIGN: Were you surprised by the cult following the movie's developed over the last 20 years?\n\nStudi: Well, not really, in the fact that it was a game to begin with, and it was a very popular game to begin with. As a matter of fact, that was the first time I'd ever experienced what motion capture was, at the time. It was kind of the beginning of motion-capture, really, whenever we shot it. We did some work for the game itself, wherein we were asked to do movements of these characters. Like, Sagat, he throws a box. That's one of his signature things to do, is throw this box. How we did it was we did everything in reverse. You start from the end movement that you would have of throwing a box -- like, at the point of release of the box and then back to where you started out to throw the box. That, I think, was one of the earlier forms of motion-capture, at that point. IGN: You've worked with a lot of big directors: Walter Hill, James Cameron, Michael Mann, and most recently Seth MacFarlane. Is there something that you've seen -- obviously besides just talent -- but is there a certain trait that you've seen that each of these very successful directors share?\n\nStudi: I respect a number of the directors that you just named. What they share in common is a planned goal, something that they have already mapped out in their own minds. They have a focus of how this particular scene is going to lead into the next one, but they're not totally closed to anything that might happen. It's kind of like, Michael would push us a scene to the point of, he wouldn't cut, just to see what the actors would do at the end of what they thought was the end of their scene, and there's no cut. So you're still on camera and you've run out of dialogue -- what do you do at this point? You know? [Laughs]\n\nIGN: Just stay intense!\n\nStudi: [Laughs] Exactly!\n\nIGN: Even though your character died at the end of Avatar, if there's one thing science fiction has taught us, it's that you can cheat death. Has Cameron talked to you at all about coming back for any of the Avatar sequels?\n\nStudi: [shrugs] I'm hoping that's the case, but I think I'll find out pretty soon. This year, they're starting up again for the next two or three to go. IGN: Nowadays comic book movies and comic book team movies are commonplace. Mystery Men is another cult classic of yours. Do you think that one was too ahead of its time?\n\nStudi: Exactly. We were just a little ahead of the curve on that one, maybe by a couple of years. It was very soon after that that the graphic novel became the big thing. But Mystery Men was a part of that series of graphic novels that were very popular.\n\nIGN: Yeah. I feel like if a movie like that came out now, it would find an audience. Last question, what was it like working on A Million Ways to Die in the West?\n\nStudi: [Laughs] It was actually a lot of fun to do. You know, it was fairly difficult, but there was a lot of timing to it because of the subtitles. Otherwise, just a whole lot of fun out in the middle of nowhere, practically. But one of the things I remember most was that we worked in a huge arroyo, and all of the lighting was shot at night and would produce all these spooky movements from the trees blowing or people actually moving and stuff. It was almost a surreal little set.\n\nPlanes: Fire & Rescue is now in theaters."
