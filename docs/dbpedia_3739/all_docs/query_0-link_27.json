        "text": "BURN X Official Trailer from TBVE Films on Vimeo.\n\nThe team behind the original “BURN” film have announced that the long-awaited sequel will be available December 6, 2022.\n\nTwelve years in the making, “BURN X” follows members of the Detroit (MI) Fire Department as they face the everyday challenges of the job. The film explores the stories of new firefighters and revisits some of the members the audience became acquainted with in the original movie.\n\n“BURN X” also dives deeper into themes and answers questions left open from the first film. Why is Detroit still burning? What happens once a firefighter retires? How do they fight fires with less and less support? And what does the future hold when a firefighter becomes catastrophically injured on the job?\n\nFrom 2009 to 2020, the BURN team filmed thousands of hours of footage as the Detroit Fire Department, its members, and the city they serve went through tremendous highs and lows: the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history, the department’s first new class of firefighters in years, and America’s grueling COVID-19 pandemic."
