        "text": "- [Announcer] Production funding for \"Afterburn: The Creek Fire Documentary\" provided by: (tribal chanting) By Reedley College.\n\nTeaching the next generation of forest managers through its forestry and natural resources program.\n\nBy the Lazzerini Family Foundation.\n\nProud to support Valley PBS.\n\nBy Hedrick's Chevrolet.\n\nThanking firefighters for their heroic efforts in fighting the Creek Fire.\n\nBy InSight Vision Center.\n\nFocused on supporting our communities affected by the Creek Fire and to the men and women who risked so much to keep us safe.\n\nAnd by Valley Air Conditioning & Repair.\n\nDedicated to telling the stories of the Creek Fire that bring us all closer together and mountain strong.\n\n(wind rustling) - [Narrator] Every story has a beginning.\n\nA first step, a word, an action or a place that becomes a journey.\n\nFor one of the largest wildfires in California history, the story begins here at a single place on earth below the small mountain community of Big Creek, California.\n\nSomething happened deep in this rugged canyon that changed the lives of tens of thousands of people forever and blackened one of the most scenic expanses of the Sierra Nevada mountains for generations.\n\nA single place on earth where the story of the Creek Fire begins.\n\n- [Ty] Well it was probably in January.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- [Jeff] Snow on the ground, or?\n\n- [Ty] There was no snow in January.\n\nWe came back again in February and there was snow.\n\n- [Jeff] Yeah.\n\nWas there any signs of anybody else being down in here?\n\nLike the Forest Service or any investigator type things?\n\n- [Ty] Yeah, we had a tip that the investigator was coming out here.\n\nSo we came out to see exactly where he was going and what he was interested in.\n\nAnd there was snow on the ground at that point so we were easily able to see right where he went.\n\n- [Fire Radio] Sixty Charlie.\n\nStructure Group, go ahead for 60 Charlie.\n\n- [Firefighter] Up here we got heavy fallout.\n\nThe spot's taking off.\n\n- [Fireman] Yeah, copy, I'm gonna pull their other engine out of Rock Haven breaks.\n\n30 Charlie used at Rock Haven.\n\nStructure Group, make your way north of 168.\n\n(chainsaw roaring) - A lot of people have seen the photograph of the smoke plume coming down from Big Creek or the photo taken from Big Creek.\n\nThat one shot everybody has seen.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Did you use that to help figure out where this was?\n\n- That's what, yeah, not personally, but friends of mine used that and a laser pointer from the point to triangulate a spot.\n\n- Get close.\n\n- And then dropped a pin on Google to where we had some coordinates.\n\n- [Jeff] Okay, so, but you haven't seen the aerial picture from Air Attack 15 at that point yet?\n\n- No, from that angle it's still hard to tell how steep the hill is and stuff like that.\n\n- Yep.\n\nSo what we'll do is, when we get down here a little lower, we'll pull my cell phone out and we'll look at that aerial photograph.\n\n'Cause that's how we were able to really dial it down.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nThere's a lot of Oak in here.\n\nThere's some Ponderosa Pines.\n\nThere's actually some Sugar Pines down lower, too.\n\nBut this would have been really hard to get through.\n\nThis road down a little lower, there's some parts of this road, and you probably know this better than me, that are unburned.\n\nSo you can see what it looked like.\n\n- [Ty] Yeah.\n\n- [Jeff] All right, bud, so what are we looking at here?\n\nYou stopped here for a reason.\n\n- Yeah, so when we came out here in February with snow on the ground, a day after the Forest Service investigator.\n\nFollowed his tracks directly to this clearing over here.\n\nIt's about 60 or 80 feet by 200.\n\nClear, no stumps.\n\nIt's been cleared for a long time.\n\nSo that's what he was interested in.\n\nIf there were a marijuana grow out here, that's where it would have been.\n\nSomeone came in well after the fire and ran a dozer in there.\n\nBack and forth with no blade down.\n\nBack and forth, back and forth.\n\nTons of times over that whole clearing.\n\n- Why do you think that is?\n\n- It's hard to explain.\n\nI can't come up with a reasonable explanation.\n\n- [Woman] All right, there's the husband, the kids, the dogs, the goats.\n\nThere's the fire.\n\nYou can see the smoke in the air, all the little pieces of particulate matter.\n\nWe put all of our explosives away from our house and we have our car over here.\n\nIt's packed and ready to go.\n\nHoping it's goodbye but not goodbye forever.\n\n(sirens blaring) - [Narrator] For those who lived through the Creek Fire, those that experienced it, those that fought it, suffered loss from it, or barely escaped with their lives, the images of Labor Day weekend 2020 will be tough to forget.\n\nIn every way, this was the perfect storm.\n\nA holiday weekend in the year of COVID-19.\n\nFor many, the first time to get back outside and reconnect with friends and family.\n\nA forest overrun with millions of dead trees.\n\nSkeletons explosively dry after a plague of bark beetles exploited years of drought.\n\nThousands of tons per acre of dead and downed fuel slowly growing on the forest floor left unchecked in the absence of a once thriving timber industry.\n\nA changing climate giving a neglected forest choked with fuel the conditions needed for a fire to run.\n\nA heat wave in Central California with temperatures over 100 degrees and single digit humidity levels fanned by unusual wind patterns for late summer.\n\nAnd a source of ignition to bring flame and cause to a fire that would burn nearly 400,000 acres over four months in the heart of the San Joaquin River Watershed and the Sierra National Forest.\n\nMost of what we know about the first few days of the Creek Fire was memorialized with smartphones capturing the first moments of a small fire in the canyon below Big Creek.\n\nTo the realization on Saturday, September fifth, that a major wildfire was growing by the minute.\n\nTo surreal images of a daring helicopter rescue of over 200 people surrounded by flames.\n\nAnd the devastation of a place home to so many.\n\nA reality that is still hard to accept.\n\nBut what most haven't seen or even heard is what actually happened on the ground in the first days of the Creek Fire.\n\n- [Firefighter] We'll start scouting spots.\n\nTurn around and push the other direction.\n\n- [Narrator] From the initial attack on Friday, September fourth, to the heroic effort to save the community of Shaver Lake, so much of the story of the Creek Fire has been left to imagination, rumor, and theory with no shortage of concepts on how the Creek Fire actually began.\n\n- [Jeff] Can we be looking at the exact tree that was hit by lightning that started the Creek Fire?\n\n- [Narrator] As a filmmaker and storyteller, I knew this event would shape the next year of my life.\n\nI needed to know everything I could about how and why this happened.\n\nOur entire community needed to know to heal, understand, and move on.\n\nSome of the images you are about to see are hard to watch.\n\nSome may recognize burning structures as a family cabin or home.\n\nI've wrestled with how to tell this part of the story and mean no disrespect or lack of compassion to those who've suffered this kind of loss.\n\nBut this loss is part of the story.\n\nPart of how we all understand what really happened those first few days hidden beneath the smoke.\n\n- [Jeff] Where were you when you first got the call about the Creek Fire starting on September fourth?\n\n- It was a Friday evening, September fourth.\n\nI was just arrived home.\n\nNot too long before that, I was at my home in Prather, California.\n\nI received a call from our command center about 6:30 that we had a fire start in the Big Creek drainage.\n\nThe tree mortality I knew in that area from being down the Huntington Lake Road a few times that it was pretty bad.\n\n- My family's always had property up in the Big Creek/Camp Sierra area.\n\nEven from the time I was really first born, I've been running around these mountains.\n\nI've worked up in the mountains in the summertime throughout high school and college.\n\nAnd when I went onto the Sheriff's office, I started out volunteering for our search and rescue team even before I was a deputy sheriff.\n\nThe fire started on the evening of Friday, September fourth.\n\nThat was the Friday of Labor Day weekend.\n\nI had actually just arrived up here.\n\nFriday was my first day off of a weekend.\n\nThat's my normal day off.\n\nAnd I arrived up here.\n\nI got dinner, played with the kids, doing a little bit of stuff getting settled in for the weekend.\n\nAnd then I had heard, actually from somebody in Big Creek, that smoke had been seen in the canyon, and I went to a vantage point where I could look down in the canyon.\n\nI saw the smoke myself.\n\n- So when the fire started, we got on it right away.\n\nWe were the first aircraft on the fire.\n\nWe had this tanker on the fire and a helicopter out of Batterson, which is up in the Oakhurst area.\n\nHelicopter five-three-four were on that fire.\n\nThe pilot that was here, they put retardant on the fire.\n\nThey put water on the fire that night.\n\nWhat the issue was with it, in that canyon so late in the day, the shadows, they couldn't do a whole lot.\n\nWhen you're down there at low level in that canyon, which is tight in the middle of the day when there's sun in there, with all the power lines that are in there.\n\nThere's a spiderweb of power lines.\n\nIt runs on the road to Big Creek and all the stuff that obviously comes out of a power house.\n\nIt was like the most perfect placement to have something start.\n\n- When I first received the call, I was actually assigned to the August Complex on the Mendocino fire.\n\nAnd the thoughts that went through my mind initially was that I knew the area very well, I knew that it was a very high threat area, I knew the resources that were around it and what was at risk.\n\nAnd I immediately contacted my supervisors, let them know that I was gonna need a backfill to take my place on the August Complex so that I could immediately get back to the Sierra and tend to this incident, knowing that it was likely to turn into something fairly larger.\n\nAt least it had the potential to.\n\n- I had recently come home from the LNU Complex the night before so I was in bed asleep.\n\nProbably 12:30-ish or sometime that night, I don't really remember the time 'cause I was very tired from being up north, Chief Johnson called me and told me where the fire was and said I need you to go take a look at it.\n\n- [Narrator] For everyone not living directly in Big Creek or Camp Sierra, how the Creek Fire was handled the night it started by the Forest Service and Cal Fire has been an ongoing source of debate, speculation, and misinformation.\n\n(sirens blaring) The stories spread as fast as the fire itself that the Forest Service let it burn on Friday night or refused help from Cal Fire as part of the initial attack.\n\nBoth are untrue.\n\n- [Dispatcher] At Camp Sierra.\n\n- [Firefighter] Copy, 4350-- - [Narrator] The initial attack on the Creek Fire on the night of Friday, September fourth, included air attack, a hand crew, dozer crews, and cooperation between the United States Forest Service and Cal Fire.\n\n- I helped direct the crews in.\n\nI know the area well since I've worked here for 30 years.\n\nI helped get the crews into the fire.\n\nI was the lookout providing them information about what the fire was doing.\n\nI did that 'til, oh, the crews got onsite.\n\nAnd at that point I switched in to start do some line scouting out for the divisions, the firefighters that were out managing the fire.\n\nAnd so I was assisting them, assisting Cal Fire in getting the dozers into the right spots and on the right road systems, getting gates open.\n\nPretty much did that until about 10:30, 11 o'clock the next day.\n\n- Initial, I think we got a CAD page probably, I don't know, six, seven o'clock at night saying that the Big Creek Fire was three acres.\n\nAnd I remember looking away, I'm like, oh okay, that thing's done, the fire's wrapped up.\n\nAnd I was getting ready to go to bed that evening to start my trip down into Southern California.\n\nProbably fell asleep about nine o'clock at night.\n\nAnd my phone goes off about 1:30 in the morning.\n\nMy pager and my phone at the same time.\n\nAnd I remember reading the CAD page and it says Big Creek, go to the Creek Fire with the dozers.\n\nAnd it's 600 acres.\n\nI figured there was a typo.\n\nIt's timber, there's no way.\n\nCalled the command center immediately.\n\nAnd hey, just confirming, we're going to the Creek Fire.\n\nAnd did I read the page right?\n\nIt's 600 acres.\n\nYeah, affirmed.\n\nGet going.\n\n- So September fourth started like a normal day.\n\nWe were at draw-down levels here in the unit.\n\nI had heard that there was a fire on the Sierra National Forest in the Big Creek drainage late in that afternoon.\n\nI didn't get called initially.\n\nMy partner, Battalion Chief Matt Dunham, was a Cal Fire battalion chief responding to that incident with Cal Fire resources on initial attack with the Sierra National Forest.\n\n- [Firefighter] He is gonna be the one that called in.\n\n- Fire units arrived.\n\nFrom where we were watching it, we could see the initial air attack on the fire.\n\n- [Jeff] About what time of day was that?\n\n- That was right around dinner time.\n\nSo it was gonna be right around six o'clock.\n\n- [Jeff] Okay, and when you say you saw an air attack, you noticed Air Attack 15 overhead that's spotting.\n\nAnd if I understand right, there was a fixed wing and a rotary wing in here.\n\n- That's correct.\n\nAnd we saw both of those.\n\nWe saw the fixed wing and we saw the helicopter.\n\nWe saw the helicopter do a drop.\n\nWe saw the fixed wing do a retardant drop.\n\nAnd about that time, ground-based fire resources were arriving at Camp Sierra and patrol deputies were arriving at Camp Sierra.\n\n- [Jeff] You guys have known each other a long time and there's a certain level of respect and trust that you have for each other.\n\nAnd when your boss called, and I'm assuming he was your boss at the time-- - Oh yeah.\n\n- [Jeff] When your boss called and you knew where this fire was, you knew no matter what you had to be there.\n\nthere's no way you're missing this one.\n\n- No, I left.\n\n- [Jeff] Did the Forest Service call you for help initially?\n\n- Our dispatch centers are co-located.\n\nThey're in the same building right next to each other.\n\nSo when one has a fire, the other one's immediately aware of it.\n\nWhen the tree mortality happened, and right after the Rough Fire, we sat down with the Sierra National Forest and we determined what we called mutual threat zones.\n\nSo we set up these boxes of response areas basically on both sides of our borders that said if you have a fire to immediate threat to me, I'm going to respond also.\n\nIf Cal Fire has a fire that's close to the border, the Forest Service is immediately gonna respond to it.\n\nBecause it's a mutual threat to both of us.\n\nSo that's what we had to have in place for a number of years and that's the way it worked on September fourth.\n\nThe issue was we were three weeks into a fire siege that was caused by lightning in California.\n\nResources were stripped across the state, the Fresno-Kings unit was no different that day.\n\nWe had a limited number of engines.\n\nOur dozers were just coming back in the unit.\n\nThey were already assigned to another pre-position in Southern California.\n\nIt was just a bad time on a bad day in a bad place.\n\n- After that initial assessment, a significant amount of resources were ordered up for the incident and an initial attack took place to try and confine it to as small a perimeter as possible.\n\nIt quickly became evident that we were not going to be able to contain its perimeter that first evening.\n\nAnd so they shifted the strategy from perimeter development to structure defense.\n\nAnd by about 21:00 that evening, or nine p.m., the fire had already grown from about three acres up to over 200 acres.\n\n- On that normal day, a fire in the Big Creek drainage would have gotten them at least eight engines, two dozers, and two helicopters, two air tankers.\n\nThe fed response on the aircraft would have been the same.\n\nBut we would have had all that equipment coming.\n\nOn that day, we were able to send three engines because we still had the whole rest of the unit that we needed engines to cover.\n\nAnd for the next heart attack, for the next fire, and our initial response into the Big Creek drainage was only three engines and a battalion chief.\n\n- [Jeff] From just looking at it, it's a pretty tight, the properties are tight together.\n\nStructure protection in here, Cal Fire had, or Forest Service, had structure protection all in here.\n\n- Yeah, they did.\n\nAnd this is where the initial command post was for fires.\n\nSo the very first night when Forest Service and Cal Fire was converging on it, this is where they met.\n\nIt was right here by this flag pole.\n\nThat was the initial incident command post for everybody.\n\n- [Jeff] I'm trying to understand timeline.\n\nSo the fire's reported around 6:30.\n\nWe've got a type one helicopter that puts two buckets on, two loads on it.\n\n- Yup.\n\nWe've got a larger tanker 160 that does a split load drop on it.\n\nAnd they both report a single tree candlestick with a little bit on the ground.\n\nTheir reports initially were the helicopter said about an eighth of an acre, the plane said it was larger.\n\nI get that, the helicopter's slower, and can get a better look at it.\n\nAt that time, I know Ramiro was on lookout and he's bringing resources in.\n\nAre those, some of those resources, you guys?\n\n- Some of those resources, like I said, the three engines and the battalion chief were ours.\n\n- [Jeff] Was part of that initial attack.\n\n- Was a part of that initial attack force.\n\nI grabbed my handy talkie, my radio at the time of dispatch, and turned it on.\n\nI was having a hard time picking up a lot of the Sierra traffic coming out of the Big Creek area just because of the terrain from where I lived to where it is.\n\nBut I was getting bits and pieces of it and I could certainly hear our battalion chief when he got in the area.\n\nAnd just he like is out there, most people are saying it was two to three acres.\n\nIt really wasn't doing a whole lot.\n\nMy battalion chief, when he got on scene, gave me a phone call 'cause he had good cell reception in the area he was in and gave me the same thing.\n\nThat it wasn't doing a whole lot.\n\n- [Jeff] I was surprised to learn, because I fell under the spell of all the other rumors that were out there for a year, that there were two hand crews put into the fire that went direct on the fire early on.\n\nWere those Cal Fire assets or were those Forest Service?\n\n- Those were Forest Service, I believe.\n\nWe didn't initially stick any hand crews because we only had one crew available in the unit at the time, I believe.\n\nAnd the battalion chief that responded for Cal Fire was informing me of that, that they were attempting to go direct, they had a dozer on scene.\n\nDozer two from the forest.\n\nThey were pushing into the fire.\n\nThe trouble is the most dangerous thing you can do is fight fire that's downhill from you.\n\nThe really most dangerous thing you can do is fight fire in a river canyon downhill.\n\nAnd if you read back in history, we've historically killed a lot of firefighters in that scenario.\n\nSo they were very careful picking their way into it.\n\nBut as the battalion chief would call me about every hour.\n\nI never went to sleep that night.\n\nAs the hours ticked by, the crews are making progress, they were getting into the fire, they were trying to get a scratch line going around the fire.\n\nUp 'til about midnight, it had only grown to maybe five acres or so.\n\nAnd then something changed.\n\n- The first evacuation order that was issued was issued for the community of Camp Sierra and the units that were on scene at the time started that process.\n\nThe sergeant and the two deputies that were at Camp Sierra started that process at that time.\n\nAnd from my perspective, I have to say that one of the best decisions that the Sheriff's Office made early on was a decision made by that patrol sergeant to leave those two deputy sheriffs in place.\n\nWe didn't send them to any other calls for service.\n\nShe made sure that they stayed here just in case the fire took a turn for the worse.\n\nBecause that's exactly what happened.\n\n- I remember initially getting there as the dozers were getting loaded, I put the drone up in the air, and tried to get some, a vision of the map of where this fire was going.\n\nAs we put it up in the air, in a timber fire, you have no idea how far it's passed.\n\nPut the drone up and I could see, the fire was already past the location I was at.\n\nAnd I was like, okay, let's get the dozers unloaded and let's start tracking them around.\n\n- And the fire stood up, and, by 12:30, one o'clock, it had crossed the Huntington Lake Road, which was my trigger point when he called me and he said, \"Chief, it's gone across Huntington Lake Road.\"\n\nThat's when I said whatever I said to him.\n\n(Jim chuckles) And I hung up the phone and I called Jim, and I said, \"Dude, you're the last person I want to wake up right now 'cause this has been a rough month, but I need you.\"\n\n- We got in there very quickly.\n\nWe did try to go direct both with hand crews and with dozer.\n\nWe had a significant amount of air resources also assigned.\n\nThe fire became extremely intense.\n\nWe had to back off.\n\nWe went in a second time, tried to reestablish that direct line.\n\nAt that point with the darkness setting in and the intensity picking up, that's when the decision was made to shift from trying to control the entire perimeter to again providing that immediate structure protection.\n\n- One of the chiefs from Cal Fire, Jim McDougald, called me on the phone, and the first thing he said is, \"Are you there?\"\n\nBecause that gave me an indicator of just how bad this was also.\n\nHe gave me-- - [Jeff] He was worried about you.\n\n- He was worried about the entire thing.\n\nAnd he also wanted information about what was going on here.\n\nThe tone from his voice gave me an idea of just really how bad this was.\n\nAnd that was about the time that I was logging on and heading up the hill.\n\nAnd he had told me that he's got a bunch of bulldozers that are headed up, and I relayed to him that Huntington Lake Road had just burned over.\n\nHe said it didn't matter.\n\nThey could drive right on by it.\n\nAnd then he called me back about an hour later and said the fire's too bad.\n\nThey have to take the bulldozers up and around the long way.\n\nWhich for me is not good news because the long way around means that all of that equipment has to go up 168 to Huntington Lake and then down Huntington Lake Road coming into the back of Big Creek.\n\nAnd what that means for me is that we now are gonna have fire equipment coming down a one lane road that is also the road that we have to evacuate all of the Big Creek out of.\n\n- [Jeff] With sunrise on Saturday, September fifth approaching and the fire making runs in multiple directions, the evacuation of Huntington Lake began next.\n\nThe flames slowed on parts of the mountain where Cal Fire and Forest Service fuel reduction programs had been put in place in concert with Southern California Edison's forestry department.\n\nBut too much of the Big Creek Canyon was a tinder box of dead and down fuel, beetle kill trees, and thick dry brush.\n\nNow a chess game was beginning.\n\nWhere to move the pieces to make a stand against a fire now raging out of control?\n\nAnd for Kathy Curtis in charge of the evacuation of the entire mountain area for the Fresno County Sheriff's Office, some tough decisions were about to be made on how to safely move 28,000 people off of a burning mountain.\n\n- As soon as we evacuated Big Creek, the next thing was the west and the Huntington because the fire was starting to just race right up that canyon.\n\nHuntington Lake was a challenge for us because the fire was coming so fast.\n\n- I was staying on the phone trying to procure as much equipment.\n\n- [Jeff] He was your eyes and ears.\n\n- Yep.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nAnd actually, when I got there, I became the unified IC of the fire.\n\n- You did.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- [Jeff] That's a big responsibility.\n\nThat's a big responsibility.\n\nHow long did you do that for?\n\n- Shoot, two and a half days?\n\n- [Jeff] The worst part of the fire.\n\nThe worst two and a half days of the entire fire, you had to be unified incident command on that.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- And operations, and-- (Jim chuckles) - So Saturday morning, I remember we had a little bit of a transition.\n\nSo I initially went up as a dozer strike team leader.\n\nAnd a lot of times we'll get rolled into another operational function.\n\nSo I still have the responsibilities of the dozers and then I became the division group supervisor.\n\nI was Division Mike on the initial.\n\nAnd basically the footprint that I was working in was the edge of the fire from the base of what I would call the east of Shaver Lake to the west end of it.\n\nIt would've been closer to Musick Mountain at that point.\n\nAnd that was my chunk of dirt.\n\nTrying to capture in the terrain that was, the backside of Musick Mountain is all rock, it's very steep country.\n\nWe've gone to a lot of rescue calls in that area.\n\nSo where are you going to be able to put some of those resources?\n\n- So this is a place that I stopped the other day when I hiked down here to check this place out.\n\nYou can see the crescent granite features of Big Creek with those amazing waterfalls down there.\n\nAnd that's really, when you look at this picture from Air Attack 15.\n\nNow Ty, you've had a chance to see this real quickly.\n\nBut when I zoom in here, there's our crescent, right?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- There's the crescent out there.\n\nYou know this spot well.\n\nNow, when you're looking at this, that smoke plume looks like it's further down in the canyon, like it's down below us, right?\n\n- Just right down this ridge, it looks like right at the top of the canyon, kinda.\n\n- It is on the spine.\n\n- Right on that spine right down in there, yeah.\n\n- Because this other creek coming in right here, you can see right here, this scene.\n\nThat's the other creek, that's this creek bed right here.\n\nSo this smoke plume is right down below us real close to where we're standing.\n\nWithin, I'd say a couple of hundred yards, wouldn't you?\n\n- Yeah, for sure.\n\n- Okay.\n\nSo what do you want to do next?\n\n- I've been down in this area already.\n\nSo I've seen a couple of odd things down there.\n\nNow knowing that we're even zeroed in more right here-- - Your interest is piqued now here.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nSo we'll go back down in there again.\n\n- What kind of odd things have you seen?\n\n- There's an area just over to our left where there's about five or six red flags that were not for the timber sale, so they're unexplained.\n\nThey could have been an investigator.\n\nAnd then there's also two or three stumps of trees that were fallen well after the fire.\n\nGreen trees that were unexplained why somebody would come in here and fall those trees afterwards.\n\n- Well, we're gonna have a chance to talk to Cooper next week.\n\nSo that's definitely something I'll ask him.\n\n- [Narrator] The morning of Saturday, September fifth, 2020.\n\nAt this point, the Creek Fire was known mostly to firefighters, first responders, and people directly impacted in places like Camp Sierra, Big Creek, and Huntington Lake.\n\nBut as Central California woke up and turned on the news or headed up to the lake for the weekend, the scope of what had happened in Big Creek Canyon the night before was becoming clearer.\n\nNASA documented a massive pyro cumulonimbus cloud believed to be one of the largest ever seen in the United States.\n\nBy this time, Lieutenant Kathy Curtis and the Fresno County Sheriff's Office had a full evacuation in place with evacuation orders spreading to communities down the mountain.\n\n- So when I got assigned to the Creek Fire, when I stopped by our emergency command center, I immediately made contact with my boss, Division Chief Jim McDougald, who was already up there.\n\nHe went up there two in the morning when our unit chief, Mark Johnson, tied in with him and said, hey, it's in what we call the Ely BMP.\n\nIt's an area on Southern California Edison ground that we conducted prescribed fires for the last two years in.\n\nThe fire was actually held up in the Ely BMP.\n\nIt made a difference.\n\nIt bought us two days to come up with a decision on how to divert the fire out of Shaver.\n\n- Yeah, so the chief came to me and said I need you to take some engines up there and come up with a plan to protect the community of Shaver Lake and the Ridge Top subdivisions.\n\nI teamed up with Marc Bontrager.\n\nHe became Shaver Structure Group and him and I worked directly together with Chief Wittwer that was already up there with the dozers.\n\nSo my goal and my sole responsibility was the homes, the businesses and the homes.\n\nAnd we went from house to house, coming up with a fire deployment defensive plan for each one of those communities from the point on south on, downhill, all the way to Cressman.\n\n- So basically I looking to the north towards Mammoth Mountain which lines up with Musick there, Jeff.\n\nI was sitting there talking with some of my neighbors.\n\nOkay, they're bringing the planes around right now.\n\nThey're getting into the wind, they're gonna drop.\n\nAnd you could see the retardant getting blown like a couple wind spans into the fire.\n\nI'm watching the lead lineup again, and from a different angle, taking that into consideration.\n\nAnd it was still getting blown all kinds of different directions.\n\nSo basically what was happening by this time was the fire was making its own weather.\n\nIt was making a pyro cumulus column that had downdrafts.\n\nAnd so the wind's coming out of that all different directions and we weren't gonna be effective from the air pretty much by that time.\n\nI've got some pictures from a partner of mine in Air Attack 51 that they were at, looking the column at, the column was up to 20,000 feet and they couldn't even get into it to shoot any footage with their IR cameras to see where the thing was at.\n\n- [Narrator] As daytime temps heated up and strong southerly winds began to blow, the fire behavior became aggressive and sometime around midday, began to spot out in front of the northern head of the fire.\n\nJumping the San Joaquin River near Kinsman Flat, where it began a record-setting run and rate of spread to the north towards hundreds of people camping for the weekend at Mammoth Pool Reservoir.\n\n- So I knew there was a fire.\n\nI have friends who run cattle on the other side of the river, some really good friends.\n\nSo we knew there was a fire.\n\nWe didn't, nobody knew how big it was.\n\nAs far as I knew, it was just a little, my understanding was it had maybe been a campfire that had gotten away from someone.\n\nAnd I thought they had it under control.\n\n- By 10 o'clock that morning, we had already ordered our first type one incident management team to help us out with it.\n\nBy that afternoon, I had put in the request for a second type one team.\n\nThat's not unprecedented, but within the first day of an incident to order two type one teams, that's pretty uncommon and that sends a very strong signal that what we are looking at is something that is not that common and is really gonna need significant response in order to be able to get control of it.\n\n- [Jeff] Did you put that second order in for that second IC team when it jumped the San Joaquin River?\n\nWas that the trigger for you?\n\n- Yes, as it was really picking up momentum and jumping across the San Joaquin, which was the first time we've ever had a large fire do that on the Sierra, at least in its recorded history, it became very clear that we were gonna need two incident management teams.\n\nJust given the topography of the Sierra, it's very difficult to get from one side of the forest to the other without going all the way around.\n\nYou can't just cut straight across very efficiently.\n\nAnd so that's why we needed an incident management team on both the south side, the High Sierra Ranger District, and the northwest side, the Bass Lake Ranger District.\n\n- So my family not only runs the cattle up here, which I guess to better explain it, so my dad and I run the cattle.\n\nSo my aunt, Amy, runs the store and the campground.\n\nSo, and yeah, Labor Day weekend is one of her busiest weekends.\n\nIt's the last big weekend before pretty much the end of the season.\n\nAnd it was packed.\n\nAnd not only her campground, but there's other campgrounds around us that are packed, and the lake is packed.\n\nPeople camp everywhere.\n\nOn the lake, there's campgrounds on the lake, there's campgrounds everywhere.\n\nIt was a very busy weekend.\n\n- [Narrator] As the enormous pyro cloud of the Creek Fire towered overhead, people on the north side of the San Joaquin River in Madera County were paying attention to the blaze but completely unaware that the fire had jumped across the river 10 miles to the south and was now running back up the river directly at them.\n\nAshley, her son, friend Peter Suski, and her father, Craig Wagner, were all about to begin gathering cattle after the family's summer grazing permit with the Forest Service was coming to an end for the year.\n\nThis family has been a part of these mountains for several generations and understands how wildfires burn here.\n\nBy early afternoon on Saturday, September fifth, the Creek Fire was recalibrating what the Wagners knew about fire spread.\n\n- [Jeff] Take me through what got you here.\n\nLike where did you physically see the fire and about what time of day was it?\n\n- Well, it started off in the campground.\n\nThat's when we saw the fire first.\n\nThen it jumped from Mile High to the Borrow Pit, which is the other side of the campground.\n\nThen about 10 minutes later, it started over here.\n\nAnd then that's when we went back up, got everybody, and came out here.\n\nFirst we came through the fire, the grass was on fire.\n\nAnd when we were here, it was still pretty clear.\n\nThen all of a sudden those trees just blew up in flames.\n\n- We had no official warning of hey, there is a fire.\n\nWe were making phone calls to the Forest Service to get confirmation before we freaked out a bunch of people.\n\nI was calling Cal Fire.\n\nThey didn't know yet.\n\n'Cause it happened so fast.\n\nNo one knew what was really going on.\n\nAnd at that point, all I was worried about was my dad, and my son, my friend, and my animals.\n\nAnd my aunt's like, okay, I need to go tell some people to leave.\n\nAnd we're like, okay.\n\nShe backed up in her side-by-side and went up on top of a hill, not a very big hill, and just enough to look out and see.\n\nAnd she could see that the fire had jumped to Sweetwater.\n\nSo there goes our road out.\n\nThe fire's in front of us and the fire is behind us.\n\nSo she's like, all right, I'm going to tell people right now.\n\nThere was no way to drive out.\n\nAt that point, it's everybody get to the lake.\n\nAnd so from that moment, my dad and I jumped in the side-by-side.\n\nMy son was back at my cow camp with my friend.\n\nAnd as we were driving out, our campground, right before you go to cross the bridge, there's like a little camp spot right there.\n\nThat camp was on fire.\n\nAnd there was kids running around screaming.\n\nI mean, didn't, nobody knew.\n\nNo one, those people had no idea there was even a fire.\n\n- [Narrator] By mid-afternoon on Saturday, the northern flank of the fire, driven by strong southerly winds and hot dry weather, was advancing at an alarming rate.\n\nIn just a few hours, the Creek Fire ran along the backside of Shuteye Peak at a record-setting pace, scorching 15 miles of forest.\n\nWithin the first four days of starting, the Creek Fire rapidly exploded, expanding between 20,000 and 50,000 acres per day.\n\nGame cameras set up for the fall deer hunt on Whiskey Ridge above North Fork captured the speed at which the flames moved.\n\nImages of forest wildlife literally running for their lives.\n\nForest aviation officer and air tactical group supervisor, Mark Bertuccelli, flew hours of missions over the Creek Fire in Air Attack 15, the spotter plane also known by its tail number 700 Papa Quebec.\n\n- Between us, we come up with a plan on what we need.\n\nWhat'll work in this area?\n\nWhat planes will work best in this area?\n\nAnd, a lot of times, when it's as busy as it was, we had a lot of fires going in the state at this time, it's what's available.\n\nSo I'll ask, hey, you want the VLAT?\n\nAnd they'll either come back with a yes, we'll take the VLAT right now, or no we won't.\n\nBut it's generally on their suggestion on we've got a lot of ground here, this'll cover it really quick.\n\nIt'll work in here because they're the ones that are going low level, checking the air, checking the obstacles that are out there.\n\nAnd they know whether that plane will work in there.\n\nI make the suggestion, I'll make the order, but they're generally the ones whether it'll work or not.\n\n- [Narrator] When Mark is over a fire, his job is to help develop a plan with crews on the ground about how to stop the fire using planes, helicopters, dozers, and strike teams.\n\n- And the smoke is laying in there so bad right now that I just got back from it, and I couldn't even, we're flying at 12,000 feet just to be above the smoke and we can barely even see the ground.\n\nSo the limitations are, we have to be able to see where we're dropping and there's wind limitations, too.\n\nThere's visibility limitations.\n\nAnd just because it's big doesn't mean it's the best.\n\nSometimes the Cal Fire S2 is the best platform for what we're trying to do out there.\n\nIt's just the Air Attacks working with the lead plane guys and the tanker guys to come up with a plan of what's gonna work best.\n\nSometimes we'll drop a VLAT out in front of the fire and we'll work a smaller tanker from a corner to that.\n\nSo it's having all the right tools in the toolboxes is the key to it.\n\n- [Narrator] On September fifth, as the Creek Fire roared into late afternoon, hundreds of weekend campers caught off guard by the firestorm ran towards the shores of Mammoth Pool.\n\nSome literally getting into the lake to escape the intense heat.\n\nThe flames and thick smoke made air operations too dangerous for an all out air attack.\n\nAnd for Ashley Wagner and her family who stayed behind at their cow camp in nearby Logan Meadow, time had run out.\n\n- There was fire coming at us from literally every direction.\n\nIt was coming towards our camp, it was coming from back over this way, it was coming from behind us because, I guess, the actual main part of the fire was still coming up the river and these were just spot fires all around us creating more fires.\n\nAll I was thinking about is I have my son and I grab every dog I could find.\n\nI didn't grab, we had water, I knew we had water 'cause we always keep water in our side-by-side.\n\nAnd I knew we had snacks.\n\nMy dad's a diabetic so he always has food.\n\nSo I didn't grab any food, didn't grab water, didn't grab my diaper bag.\n\nI had nothing.\n\nAll I did was go around, I was grabbing dogs, holding my son in one arm, grabbing dogs, throwing them in the Ranger, tying down whatever I could.\n\nMy dad told me, get in, let's go.\n\nAnd I got in with him and we drove away.\n\nI wasn't nervous.\n\nI'd never thought that this was how I was gonna die because there was no way I was gonna die that way.\n\nThere was no, I wasn't gonna let myself think that way.\n\nI had a baby with me.\n\nI have a two year old at home.\n\nThat's not the way I'm going out.\n\nAnd my dad and I sat there for a minute and he told me, he said, stay here, I'm gonna go look for your aunt.\n\nHe drove away.\n\nAnd he disappeared.\n\n'Cause at that point, for whatever reason, the wind shifted and it got smoky.\n\nAnd so we're standing in this meadow and I told Peter, I was like, we can't stay in this meadow.\n\nThe grass is gonna burn.\n\nI mean, it was green and the grass wasn't super high, but I'm like it's gonna burn and we need to get to a better spot.\n\nMy dad showed back up and I told him, I said, we need to get to the pond.\n\nAnd he was like, okay, follow me.\n\n- [Man] Here's one for the books-y boys.\n\n- [Narrator] With spot fires now surrounding Logan Meadow and the main head of the fire charging directly toward them just minutes away, the Wagners made their final stand against the flames in this small pond.\n\nFor the next hour, they sat huddled in their all-terrain vehicles, fire raging around them, unsure of what was coming next or when it would end.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, they knew they'd made it through the worst, but not without loss.\n\nIn the middle of the firestorm, one of Ashley's dogs broke free in a panic and ran directly into the forest just as trees began to explode from the intense heat.\n\nThe dog was never found.\n\nAs the flames died down, Craig Wagner set out to see what was left behind.\n\n- I sat there and this is where my dad said, I lost it because I told him, I said, our barn's on fire.\n\nAnd he's like, I know, I know.\n\nAnd I said, and then I, we're talking and I broke down.\n\nI said I'm watching my horses burn right now.\n\nAnd he was like, no, everything's fine.\n\nLike broken down and I'm continuing like, okay, it'll be fine, it'll be fine, it's not fine.\n\nI mean, like I could be watching my horses burn to death.\n\nSo in that moment, you just, you think about everything else.\n\nAnd I'm thinking my horses, I put them in that corral to die.\n\nSo that was really hard.\n\nAnd I knew my dad had a pistol and I told him, I said, either you or I need to go shoot those horses right now.\n\nLike when it died down enough that we could get there, I'm like go now, you need to go down there and put them out of their misery.\n\nAnd he said, I'll go, Peter and him will go.\n\nI waited, that was probably the long, that felt like an eternity.\n\nSitting there waiting to hear those gunshots.\n\nAnd I never heard anything.\n\nSo then I'm going through my mind, well, they're dead.\n\nSo, okay.\n\nThat's, it's done they're you know, okay.\n\nWhen they came back maybe like 20 minutes later and they had another guy with them, Mike, who works for my aunt.\n\nPeter said, everything's fine.\n\nAnd I was like, you mean they're dead?\n\nHe's like, no, your horses are fine.\n\nI'm like, don't lie to me.\n\nWhy would you, I mean, I was like arguing with him over it.\n\nLike, why would you lie to me?\n\nWhy would you tell me my horses are fine?\n\nAnd he, Peter knows me really well.\n\nHe had took a video of them and showed me there's nothing wrong with your horses.\n\nAnd I'm like, couldn't believe it.\n\n- [Narrator] At the same time the Wagners were emerging from the firestorm, I was driving Beasore Road 10 miles away with my family to spend the weekend with our friends at their cabin in Beasore Meadows.\n\nEven at this point, so many people like us, not directly seeing or knowing what the fire was doing, continued to drive into the path of the Creek Fire oblivious to the danger.\n\nThe traffic coming down Beasore Road told me that we were passing people evacuating from Mammoth Pool and that the fire had jumped the river shutting down the normal path out of the reservoir towards North Fork.\n\nBut it wasn't until we arrived at Beasore Meadows that we realized something wasn't right.\n\nThe sky looked like something out of a science fiction movie constantly raining down large debris.\n\nSome of it still smoking.\n\nAnd then word from the Madera County Sheriff that it was time to go.\n\n- Okay, it is almost seven o'clock and we've just gotten the evacuation order to evacuate Beasore Meadows.\n\nThe cabin is back there and the sky is looking pretty gnarly.\n\nIt doesn't seem like it's close, the fire's close, but the smoke's been getting worse and the sky is pretty angry and red and gnarly looking.\n\nAnd we're getting reports that people down in Mammoth Pool are having a tough time and maybe even jumping in the river to save themselves from the fire.\n\nSo the sheriff went through the neighborhood here and just ran the siren and said get on out.\n\nSo we are on our way down after spending two days of prepping food and packing and getting up here.\n\n(Jeff chuckles) Good old 2020.\n\n- [Narrator] As we began to pack up and evacuate Beasore Meadows, hundreds were trapped on the shores of Mammoth Pool Reservoir, just a short drive below us, completely surrounded by fire.\n\nWord was beginning to trickle into the incident command center of those caught behind the fire line.\n\nFor the Madera, Mariposa, Merced unit and Fresno-Kings unit of Cal Fire, a bold rescue plan was beginning to take shape.\n\n- As the fire progressed through the day, and it was identified that we had a major issue both in Fresno and Madera County, my partner from Madera County called and was talking about some potential rescues on Mammoth Pool.\n\nAnd we knew that, one, fire resources were limited, response times were limited.\n\nI made the recommendation to him that we had used the National Guard with Black Hawks prior for other rescues in Fresno County.\n\nNot knowing, five hours later, I get a phone call from our dispatch center that we have a rescue of 60+ burn victims inbound to the Fresno airport.\n\nAs I talk, I have complete chills and goosebumps because it's a surreal moment that you're like in a war zone.\n\nAnd so my initial thoughts were we just lost tons of civilians, tons of firefighters.\n\nWhat are we walking into?\n\n- [Narrator] Completely surrounded by fire and stranded on the shores of Mammoth Pool Reservoir with no first responders, firefighters, or law enforcement to explain what was about to happen, two California Army National Guard helicopters descended through the smoke looking for a place to safely land.\n\n(helicopter rotors whirring) Colonel David Hall, Commander of the 40th Combat Aviation Brigade out of Fresno deployed a CH-47F Chinook heavy lift and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters with limited night vision capabilities to fly into the heart of the Creek Fire at Mammoth Pool.\n\nIn all that night, 242 people were flown to safety in three separate missions conducted in some of the most dangerous conditions these flight crews have ever faced.\n\n- And so as I got to the armory at the airport, Fresno Fire, our staff, American Ambulance, they created this triage base for these incoming aircraft.\n\nWhen that first Chinook landed and the people started coming off the helicopter, there was women, children, there was dogs, people in just shorts, dirty.\n\nAnd, for whatever happened that afternoon and evening into that rescue, there was only three burn patients and they were minor burns.\n\nSo thankfully their report was wrong.\n\nBut just the mere fact that we were able to assist and work with the National Guard and they were able to fly in to the conditions that they saw and land and rescue those people was just probably one of the weirdest memories that I have of my career.\n\n- [Narrator] For the Wagners, their cow camp, barn, and vehicles were all destroyed.\n\nAs well as the historic Wagner's Store that had been in operation since the 1950s.\n\nDemolition on the store site began in July of 2021 with plans to rebuild the store and campground, continuing a long family tradition in these mountains.\n\n- [Jeff] And you guys were all taken out on helicopter?\n\n- No.\n\n- Peter stayed.\n\n- [Jeff] Peter stayed, you went out.\n\n- I went out with the baby, and he went out on the last one.\n\n- On the second or third one.\n\n- I have no idea, I didn't even know helicopters were there.\n\n- So like two, they came at left.\n\nAnd you went out on the second wave.\n\nAshley went on the second wave.\n\nAnd then Craig went on the third, last wave.\n\n- [Craig] Yeah, the last one.\n\n- [Jeff] Were you on a Chinook or a-- - A Chinook.\n\n- I got a Black Hawk.\n\n- [Jeff] You didn't get the double egg beater?\n\n- [Ashley] No, I got a Black Hawk.\n\n- [Jeff] How do you rate?\n\nI think we're on, like we're right on it.\n\nSo let's start picking up detail.\n\nThis can here.\n\nThere's some glass over there.\n\nThere's something shiny right by you, Dave.\n\nI can't tell what that is from here.\n\nLet's just get all the detail.\n\nOne of the things I'm finding very interesting right now is the burn.\n\nI'm looking at burn patterns on trees right now.\n\nSo hang on a second, man.\n\nThis is a trip down here, dudes.\n\nOkay, one of the things, one observation I'm making right now is there's, okay so this black oak right in front of me, it has burn on one side of it, which is probably coming off this big dead snag here.\n\nAnd then on other oaks like this one right here, the burn isn't on that side.\n\nI'm trying to see if there's a pattern to how the trees burned.\n\nThis black oak hardly has any burn on it.\n\nAre these the trees you said were cut down?\n\n- [Ty] Yeah.\n\n- [Jeff] So these are post-fire cut down trees right here.\n\nOne has to think why?\n\nWhy would you come down here and burn down, and there's markings on the stumps.\n\nYou can see where we are in relation to that crescent rock of the bottom of Big Creek.\n\nAnd you can see the town of Big Creek right up above here.\n\nLet's walk over and check this out.\n\n- This seems very close to where it looks on that picture.\n\nAnd you can see below, right below us, we got green that didn't burn.\n\n- [Jeff] Could this be our lightning tree?\n\n- [Ty] Possible.\n\n- [Jeff] This could be the lightning tree.\n\nLet's make sure we document this really well because they cut it down, I believe, to look at the inside of it.\n\nBy the way, check this out, Ty.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Come here for a second.\n\n- [Ty] And they cut this one, too.\n\n- [Jeff] Check this out.\n\nI'm doing a little sleuthing here now.\n\nOkay, here's the deal.\n\nHere's what I see.\n\nI see a tree that looks like it was struck by lightning because it's got the twist to it.\n\nOkay?\n\nIt's got a little bit of the twist going on the higher up you go.\n\nIt's a pretty good size tree.\n\nThey obviously cut this tree down.\n\nAnd then here's the thing you gotta look at.\n\nThat is not a stump.\n\nThat's a core sample.\n\n- Yeah, a round-- - They took a section off to look at this specifically and that's unusual.\n\nThat's investigation happening.\n\nRight?\n\nSo this section of tree came from this section here.\n\nThe cut's here, cut's here, tree came down, and then they pieced a section out to look at it.\n\nTo try to determine what's going on.\n\nOne of the other things that I see that I find interesting is the shape of the sap and the pitch layer inside the tree.\n\nInside the tree, the pitch inside looks baked.\n\nCould have been from fire, it could have been from a lightning strike, but that's not normally how pitch looks.\n\nIt's brittle as hell.\n\nSo it's just falling apart.\n\nThat is the pitch from this tree.\n\nAnd look it, okay.\n\nNow keep in mind there was a damn forest fire here so that could have had something to do with it.\n\nAlso, this tree was standing during the fire, and was the heat damage enough to cook the pitch layer like that or is that a lightning fire?\n\nIs that a telltale of a lightning fire?\n\nWe're gonna find out.\n\nWe're gonna ask that question.\n\n- So when I got into Shaver, I immediately tied in with Chief McDougald, and he told me where the fire was.\n\nIt was backing around the backside of Musick Mountain, which on the eastern side is where we conducted those prescribed fires with Southern California Edison.\n\nIt was kind of hung up in there.\n\nThe fire was rapidly progressing up canyon towards Huntington Lake.\n\nAt that time, they already had operations running up there and structure protection.\n\nA lot of the resources at the time were getting filtered up Highway 168 to Huntington.\n\nThe fire was on the backside of Musick Mountain.\n\nTherefore we knew it was backing down into Jose Basin in the river drainage.\n\nThere's roads that we can take to get down into Jose Basin.\n\nWe could not get in there due to visibility to try to make access to see where the fire was, to see how far it progressed up.\n\nBut we knew it was going to be a matter of time before it came up Mill Creek and Stevenson Creek, which is on the west side of Shaver proper and all the communities on the top of the hill.\n\n- I remember getting on the radio, Operations Division Mike.\n\nAnd go ahead.\n\nHey, we're priority traffic.\n\nWe got 200-foot flame links at Flume Peak.\n\nThe fire's moving towards the east and we're gonna have structure impact within the next hour in the community of Shaver.\n\nHeard copy.\n\nI was like I need every additional resource that I need.\n\nSo I remember coming back down and met Chief Bontrager.\n\nHe hauled up right to where I was at.\n\nI hiked him down to what we could see from the smoke, and he's like we gotta get out of here.\n\nSo I remember we come back down and we're right at the S-turns, right at the bottom of the dam where Shaver Rock is.\n\nAnd we're coming up with a plan and Mark says, hey, we're gonna have to fire this.\n\nAnd we didn't have a plan B and a plan C. We had one plan.\n\nIt was probably right about noon where the fire had started to make it all its way to the creek.\n\nAnd we were probably within that 40-minute window of we need to make a decision right now.\n\nI got on the air and asked operations.\n\nI said, hey, we need a defensive fire basically from the bottom of the dam and we're gonna take it all the way through town.\n\nCopy, do what you need.\n\nAnd to think that we're just going to start putting fire on the ground from that point, our ending point was a long ways to go all the way past the point, all the way down past the community center, not knowing how long this operation's going to take.\n\n- [Narrator] On Sunday, September sixth, as the Creek Fire continued to relentlessly chew up tens of thousands of acres of forest in every direction, the main focus for the Fresno-Kings unit of Cal Fire was to protect the community of Shaver Lake.\n\nFor many in Central California, Shaver Lake holds a special place in people's hearts.\n\nFor battalion chiefs Wittwer, Bontrager, and Bowman, along with their crews, this firefight was personal.\n\nThey all have long ties to Shaver Lake and friends, family, and strangers all counting on them to save the town.\n\nWith fire quickly advancing up the backside of Musick Mountain and into the Stevenson Creek drainage, their only hope was to light a massive backfire, nearly four miles long, hoping to send that fire directly into the head of the main fire charging down the mountain.\n\nWith dozer crews ready and strike teams in place, Chief Bontrager's team put fire on the ground and got ready for the worst.\n\n- I had to wait 'til the main fire came 'cause I needed the fire's influence to influence my fire.\n\nI needed it to pull in.\n\nSo it started to come out of Mill Creek the afternoon of the sixth.\n\nYou couldn't see it, but you could hear it.\n\nThere was at one point we had a lot of resources in place.\n\nNot as many as I wanted.\n\nWe were very slim.\n\nThe resources they gave me, I kind of chalk it up that they were a mixed bag.\n\nI had a lot of strike teams, the engines that were volunteer companies from up north, I had engines from San Francisco City, a lot of counties in the Bay Area.\n\nUnfamiliar with the ground, you could tell their comfort level was not there.\n\nI had to build that confidence in them to get behind the plan that we had and reassure them that this was doable.\n\nWe had fuel reduction projects out there.\n\nIt was gonna be successful.\n\nWe just needed everyone's buy-in and everyone to be with the plan.\n\n(truck beeping) - The job that Jim and his folks with those dozers did on Friday night bought us basically a day and a half.\n\nBecause they, and this is something you don't want to do while I'm firefighting, is split the head.\n\nBut we had to, we had no other choice in this matter.\n\nSo the head of that fire got split at the head of Shaver Lake on Huntington Lake Road.\n\nPart of the fire went to the east, the majority of the fire after it had made its big run towards Mammoth Pool, was now coming south.\n\nIn the meantime, on Saturday, it had given them time to put those dozers in and around Shaver Lake and start pushing dirt.\n\nAnd you could see the fire when it hit it.\n\nIt was standing it up.\n\nWe call it standing it up 'cause it was laying over as it was coming through the timber.\n\nAt the beginning of Sunday, I wouldn't have given you 50 cents for the town of Shaver.\n\nAfter we started firing, and you could see the progress that it was making and what it was doing to the fire.\n\nWhen it was basically we had a fuel break on the top of the ridge, the wildfire was coming up the west side, our tactical firing operation was running in to the east side of that fuel break.\n\nAnd you could see it, basically, I won't say going out, but it was going out.\n\nIt was no longer running in the timber anymore.\n\n- Yeah, we had brought fire down 168 from Stevenson Creek through the switchbacks just below the dam.\n\nOur fuel breaks, our dozer lines that we put in all night long working, were holding.\n\nWe were feeling pretty good.\n\nWe got into that Westlake Village behind what we know where the Hungry Hut is back into those subdivisions, very tight roadways.\n\nA lot of places were just me and my pickup trying to deploy engines where I thought they could get in and get out quickly.\n\nVery, very unsafe, and as a battalion chief leading them, there was a point of emotion to that with putting them at risk and putting our equipment at risk in driveways and in roadways.\n\nThey couldn't traverse when the visibility got to zero.\n\nAnd so trying to pick those areas that we could deploy, maybe not safely, but as aggressively as we could that I could also get them out, was hard to pick those spots because the fire was moving so fast.\n\n- One of the hard things was through this whole time of, as West Village, and we're starting to get fires into Ockenden and Dogwood, our phones are blowing up.\n\nAnd I'm talking to my boss and he's trying to grab intel for me, I'm trying to relay information back.\n\nEverybody's wanting to know about their property.\n\nAnd it became to a point where I could tell you, right off the bat, your area's good, no bad news.\n\nAnd it was like, we're doing good.\n\nI probably went through eight different text messages.\n\nCan you check this address?\n\nYeah, no problem.\n\nSend a picture back of a nice cabin, not affected.\n\nThere's fire burned around it.\n\nAnd I got a text message from a friend.\n\nI'm like yeah, I'll go check it real quick, his parents.\n\nAnd I got up there and there's nothing left.\n\nAnd I'm like, send me the address again.\n\nHe sends it and out of all these text messages I've been sending back and forth, like they've all been positive, right?\n\nI don't even know how to give bad news for this.\n\nI remember replying back to him, that address doesn't exist.\n\nBeing the first one I had to give that to, it sucked.\n\n- [Jeff] To a friend.\n\n- To a friend.\n\nAnd we had multiple of those coming through and I'd say the majority of, that we were getting those text messages or phone calls, can you check this area, 99% of them I'd be like no, you're good.\n\nFire stopped at that road weren't getting into there.\n\n- [Jeff] Were you aware of the fact that there were inaccurate news reports from the local media in Fresno that Shaver Lake had burned?\n\n- Yeah, I was.\n\nI heard it on the radio.\n\nI heard it.\n\n- [Jeff] And how did that make you feel?\n\n- Just disappointed.\n\nI wanted to relay to those people that it wasn't true because we were sitting there.\n\nI mean there was one morning I woke up, or didn't wake up, but there was one morning I was sitting there at Ken's Market listening to the radio with a live report of Ken's Market burned down, yet I was sitting in the parking lot at Ken's Market.\n\nSo it was very frustrating.\n\nAnd the men and women were doing, we were doing everything we could to save a lot of those buildings and to keep it out of there.\n\nAnd so to hear some of those, you laughed it off and then went right back to work.\n\n- I felt so proud of the work that was being done of the resources that we had.\n\nLike we're holding our ground.\n\nNot a whole lot of damage has happened and we haven't got anybody hurt.\n\nA fire of that magnitude and no injuries in those first 48, 72, 96 hours with the fire behavior that we had was incredible.\n\n- [Firefighter] We're burning ground spots.\n\nTurn around and point the other direction.\n\n- It's pretty amazing how big the Creek Fire was and the devastation it caused, especially that first week.\n\nThis fire, we had injuries to civilians, we had injuries to firefighters.\n\nNot one civilian fatality, not one firefighter fatality throughout the entire incident.\n\nIt's pretty amazing, to be honest.\n\n- [Narrator] The first week of the Creek Fire saw most of the loss of property, especially in the south zone of the fire in Fresno County.\n\nOn Monday, September seventh, the fire pushed south into Jose Basin, destroying communities like Alder Springs, most of the homes along Peterson Road, and as seen here in the last minutes before it was consumed by flames, the iconic Cressman's General Store on Highway 168.\n\nIn the north zone, homes were lost above North Fork and Cascadel Woods, while flames were stopped just in time near the small community of Central Camp.\n\nThe Creek Fire pushed as far east as the south fork of the San Joaquin River one month after it started.\n\nAir Attack 51, equipped with its state-of-the-art infrared camera that can see through smoke, hunted spot fires for ground crews as it began to jump the river towards Edison Lake.\n\n- [Pilot] Firewatch 51, September 29th, 10:02 hours.\n\nAnd we're over the Creek Fire on the Sierra.\n\nWe're in Division November.\n\nThis video is made for Division November.\n\nWe're gonna show them the spots that are in that Mono Crossing area and around section seven.\n\nTo the south, you could see the next batch of scattered heat.\n\nI can turn it down so you can see where it's at exactly.\n\nThe other spot we talked about was gonna be this one.\n\nIt is on the correct side, but is out in front of the main fire.\n\nAnd LRF target on the right-hand side for that lat and long.\n\n- [Narrator] On the north zone of the fire, the flames spread mostly unchallenged by fire crews into high rocky terrain where it was allowed to burn itself out.\n\nBut for long-time generational cattle ranchers like Ned and Sherry McDougald, the aunt and uncle of Cal Fire's Jim McDougald, the Creek Fire's slow march to the granite ridge tops where it would die claimed valuable grazing lands, and a cabin that had been in the family since the 1940s.\n\n- From my dad's point of view, he said he was here once and he told me, he says, he could sit here at this cabin and see the farthest meadow as you come in.\n\nClear all the way to that area.\n\nAnd it's been getting progressively worse ever since then.\n\nAfter they got the loggers out, the roads went south.\n\nThe ability to get around went, everything kind of went south.\n\nIt's just the brush grew in.\n\nPeople tried to keep the roads open but it was tough to keep open.\n\n- [Jeff] Is this forest properly managed?\n\n- No.\n\nI think that, as matter of fact, I know it's not been properly managed because you can see what we're into now.\n\nIt was, at one time, it actually generated revenue for the federal government, it generated for the local economies.\n\nPeople had work here and it kept it cleaner and more productive.\n\nBut now they just wasted the resource.\n\nI don't know how much they burned up this side, but it's phenomenal how much waste we've allowed them to do.\n\nIn our name.\n\n- I was glued to Facebook, yeah, I was glued to everything.\n\nI could see that it was blowing up.\n\nI could see that it was gonna cross the river.\n\nI could see it was gonna go up the every canyon.\n\nI didn't know what that meant until Saturday night when it was already to Wagner's and we were worried about them and worried about what was happening there.\n\nAnd then I had this just overwhelming fear that I'd never see these cows again.\n\nAnd I didn't know what was gonna happen.\n\nI knew it wasn't here yet, but I didn't know how fast it was going or when it would be here.\n\n- [Narrator] The McDougalds were forced to evacuate their High Sierra cow camp on September fifth, just as they were preparing to gather and truck the 60 head of cattle they had grazing here for the summer.\n\nAs the fire moved steadily toward the cattle left behind in Jackass Meadows, the Forest Service gave ranchers with grazing permits one shot to move their animals off the mountain two weeks after the fire started.\n\nThe challenge for Ned McDougald and his daughter, Katie, both bridges needed to access their cattle by semi-truck and trailer were out, leaving one way to rescue their herd as the Creek Fire closed in.\n\n- So we had Will Ellis, Jessica Jones, Tyler Jones, Bart Topping, and myself were the people who were horseback.\n\nAnd then my dad was in front of the cows calling because our cows are very broke to a call.\n\nThey liked to follow hay.\n\nIt was a very last-minute, hurried cattle drive to get off the mountain before the fire.\n\nWe haven't done a cattle drive out of this place since 2001.\n\nI was five years old, I had just turned five.\n\nAnd it was the last cattle drive my grandpa went on and he was 86 and I was five years old and I thought I could make it.\n\nI didn't, so I'm glad I got to make it this time.\n\nNot under the circumstances.\n\nWe had the best help and the best support.\n\nSo we got 'em, we drove 'em all the way down the stock drive, which is not very open if you can imagine.\n\n(Katie laughs) So we made it down.\n\nWe made it to Chiquita Creek where the stock drive crosses it and that is another feat in itself, very steep and not very nice.\n\nSo we got 'em out and these cattle haven't been driven that far in a long time.\n\nBut they did a good job and we had enough people that it worked out.\n\nGot 'em into Toppings and we even picked up some of their cattle on the way which was really nice because then they didn't have to go look for 'em.\n\n'Cause they kinda just fell into the herd.\n\nAnd so then we had to sort cattle and we loaded seven or eight trailers of cows and calves and off the hill they went.\n\n- Fire is an industry in California.\n\nIt's one of the bigger ones.\n\nI mean, we were at the headquarters and they already had t-shirts for the fire.\n\nAnd I go, and I'm not used to that.\n\nSo apparently there's an industry that follows each fire.\n\nAnd there's money to be made and people do it.\n\nThe bigger the fire, the bigger the deal.\n\n- [Jeff] What needs to happen in your opinion to get this thing turned around as far as forest health?\n\n- Well, I'd say you're gonna have to change the whole administration for the Forest Service because they're either indoctrinated or so involved or so bought into it that they can't look at it.\n\nThey can't change it.\n\nAnd it needs to be changed massively.\n\nI mean, it took 40 years to get this screwed up.\n\nIt's not gonna change to overnight, but we need to start something really dramatic.\n\nAnd I hate to say that because it makes you sound revolutionary, but it's almost gotta be that.\n\nYou can't live knowing that you're just on the edge all the time.\n\nAnd now I know that 'cause it's happened.\n\n- It was a miracle in itself we made it.\n\nAnd you just, you don't believe it.\n\nI mean, I still don't believe it.\n\nI still don't believe we don't have cows up here this year.\n\nI mean, I'm gonna be 25 and I don't remember hardly ever a time when there weren't some cows here.\n\nSo it's hard.\n\nI mean, you see your family history and just the legacy go up in smoke and you just try and keep it going as best you can.\n\nI mean, it's hard.\n\n- [Narrator] Long before the Creek Fire was declared officially out on December 24th, 2020, the debate over why and how mega fires like this were becoming more frequent in the West was heating up.\n\nBy late October, the only active edges of the Creek Fire had crept into wilderness areas in both the north and south zones where the Forest Service allowed them to burn at low intensity into the rocks.\n\nAnd as people were finally allowed to come back to survey the damage, to see a once mostly green forest transformed into an endless expanse of blackened sticks, the voices crying for some kind of change to prevent this level of destruction from happening somewhere else grew louder.\n\nWhile others were fast to blame the growing number of mega fires throughout the West on climate change and embrace fires like this as healthy for the forest.\n\nJohn Mount spent a lifetime learning how to use fire to shape a landscape.\n\nThe former forester for the U.S. Forest Service and retired natural resources manager for Southern California Edison, that owns large areas of land surrounding Shaver Lake, spent years doing prescribed burns on Edison lands along with selective timber thinning to keep the private forest lands he was in charge of clean.\n\nOn the other side of the debate, Dr. Chad Hanson, a fire ecologist and Director of the John Muir Project, is passionate about his beliefs in what causes events like the Creek Fire.\n\nClimate change and a firm stance against any kind of return of the logging industry anchor his core position on wildfires and what makes them tick.\n\nThe Creek Fire gave both men a real-world laboratory to test their theories and practices.\n\n- So I'm a forest and fire ecologist.\n\nI have a PhD in Ecology from UC Davis and I do research on wildland fires essentially.\n\nHow they burn, what happens after they burn, and fire history as well.\n\nI'm the Director of the John Muir Project and we're a small nonprofit forest conservation and research organization.\n\nYeah, it's really important to understand how different it is when fire impacts a community versus what fire does in a forest ecosystem.\n\nSo when homes are lost, when people are hurt, when lives are lost, that's always a catastrophe.\n\nAnd so fires are always catastrophic when they burn homes.\n\nAnd that is actually preventable.\n\nIf we focus on making sure we create fire-safe communities, if we focus our resources and attention there, the science is really clear.\n\nWe can save 95, 99+ percent of homes if we focus there.\n\nBut fire out in a forest is a very, very different thing, including big fires.\n\nIt's really important for people to understand is that even the biggest fires, every single one of them is mostly low and moderate intensity.\n\nIn other words, the trees are scorched partially, but they're mostly green, most of the trees.\n\nSome small trees are killed, some of the mature trees are killed, but mostly they survive.\n\nAnd it doesn't, been changed that much.\n\nAnd there's a portion of the forest, usually 20 or 30% in any given fire, even the big ones, a portion that burns at high intensity, where the flames go all the way to the tops of the trees and the fire kills most or all the trees in a given area, sometimes bigger areas.\n\nFor decades, for generations, people have thought that that destroyed forests.\n\nAnd I think in large parts because people think of forest as just a source of lumber.\n\nBut ecologically, fire has been going on in these forests for tens of millions of years before any humans ever walked the face of the planet.\n\nAnd these processes are very, very old.\n\nThey're very primeval.\n\nAnd as a consequence, there are many plant and animal species that have evolved over millions of years to depend, not just on post-fire habitat, but many of them to depend on areas that burn hot.\n\nAnd so you want that mix.\n\nYou want those areas where the fire burns cool and only kills some very small trees.\n\nYou want the areas where the fire burns a little hotter and kill some trees but not the bigger ones.\n\nAnd you want the areas where fire burns hot and kills all or most or all the trees because it turns out that those areas where fire burns that hot, it creates what we call snag forest habitat.\n\nA snag just being a standing dead tree.\n\nAnd it turns out snag forest habitat is comparable to old growth forest in terms of native biodiversity and wildlife abundance.\n\nSo the fire doesn't destroy the forest in those areas, the habitat's not lost for wildlife.\n\nIn fact, the fire is actually creating wildlife habitat.\n\nIt's improving wildlife habitat in those areas in most cases.\n\nAnd it's creating a unique type of habitat that isn't really created by any other process except those things that kill most of the trees.\n\nWhether it's drought or whether it's an intense patch of fire.\n\nAnd these areas, it turns out, are ecological treasures.\n\nThey're actually really, really rich and abundant in wildlife.\n\n- I so believe in good forest management that we humans are responsible for our forests.\n\nYes, we have messed that up, and it's our responsibility now to fix it before we have more like the Creek Fire and the bark beetle infestation.\n\nWe have fouled things up and I, to my dying day, I will be on a platform advocating for good healthy forest management.\n\nThe ecosystem depends on nutrient recycling.\n\nSo if you start piling up a bunch of pine needles or fir needles or whatever on the ground and you allow that to build up, pretty soon you're doing several things.\n\nFirst of all, you're inhibiting the ability of rain and snow to get to the soil.\n\nIt builds up in that duff and not even ever get to the soil.\n\nIf rain doesn't get to the soil, it doesn't do anybody any good.\n\nAnd besides that, decomposition of pine needles depletes the nitrogen in the soil.\n\nSo by having pure decomposition of the duff, which is forest litter, on the ground, you are stealing from the soil the ability to grow good trees or brush or whatever.\n\nGrasses, anything.\n\nSo you're just inhibiting, without hot fire, you're inhibiting all of that nitrogen cycle, the fertility cycle of the soils.\n\n- There is a strong and emerging consensus among climate scientists and ecologists in this country and around the world that we need to start shifting away from logging and wood products to mitigate the climate crisis.\n\nJust as we're shifting away from fossil fuel consumption.\n\nAnd it's not gonna happen overnight.\n\nAnd it's not gonna happen in 10 years.\n\nIt's gonna take time and we want to be sensitive to that.\n\nWe want a just transition.\n\nWe want to actually develop and dedicate and allocate public resources to help people to make sure that people don't lose their jobs.\n\nOr to make sure that we have worker retraining.\n\nTo make sure that we create jobs, programs, doing things that will actually help mitigate the climate crisis instead of making it worse.\n\nWhat we know now is that logging is one of the largest sources of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.\n\nAnd it's a huge, huge contributing factor in the climate crisis.\n\nWe also know that if we move away from fossil fuels and we protect a lot more forests in the U.S. and around the world, that we have a very, very high probability of avoiding the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\nWhen logging operations happen, including these so-called thinning operations, what happens is they've removed so many of the trees, they reduce the cooling shade of the forest canopy.\n\nThey actually change the microclimate of the forest and make it hotter, drier, and windier.\n\nAnd so you actually get conditions that are more conducive to a more intense fire and a fire that can sweep through the forest more rapidly.\n\nBecause once you've removed a lot of the trees, there's not much of a windbreak effect.\n\nIn addition, after those logging operations, oftentimes euphemistically called thinning, you got a lot of logging slash debris, those small twigs and branches on the forest floor.\n\nAnd logging operations, including thinning, it spreads highly, highly combustible invasive grasses like cheatgrass, and they will oftentimes form a thick mat in these more heavily logged areas.\n\nAnd that sweeps the flames through even faster.\n\n- [Jeff] Why are we seeing more and bigger burns in wildfires in your opinion?\n\n- Fuel.\n\nThe reason we have mega fires now is strictly fuel.\n\nEverybody says we have hotter and dryer, and that's true.\n\nWe have a longer season, but anybody that's over 50 years old knows that we've had 110 degree temperatures and high winds every year since, you know, you look at the Harlow Fire, which you mentioned.\n\nThe Harlow Fire, that was worse fire conditions than during the Creek Fire.\n\nAnd yet they were able to contain that fire.\n\nIf you look at any chart and just common sense, a forest is putting down tons of fuel every year.\n\nAnd it doesn't decompose tons.\n\nSo the buildup, when I had a fire class with the museum, we put on a fire symposium.\n\nI ran a little chart and it just shows the buildup of tons per acre over the last few years.\n\nAnd it's like any other chart.\n\nIt goes very slowly, and then all of a sudden, it just increases over the last 20 years or so.\n\nSo it's strictly fuel.\n\nAnd if you combine bad fire conditions, which we had in 1933 and 1954, every year has had at least one incident, if not more, of bad fire weather.\n\nBut if you put fuel with that, then of course, when you have bad fire weather, it is much, much worse.\n\nHere on the Creek Fire, we really, really ran against the curve in that we've had this buildup of fuel.\n\nFor example, where the fire started.\n\nThe last job I had with the Forest Service in 1964 was a timber sale exactly where this fire started.\n\nThat whole mountain from Camp Sierra clear up to Edison property up in Tamarack was a big timber sale.\n\nAnd we logged that whole area in there and reduced the fuels tremendously.\n\nSo since 1964, there has been a continuous buildup of fuel in there, and there's just tons.\n\nJim McDougald from Cal Fire was telling me the other day that they have actually measured way over 2000 tons of fuel per acre.\n\nAnd then we killed 160 million trees.\n\nNot on the Creek Fire, but on the Southern Sierra.\n\nAnd when I say that, I mean it.\n\nWe killed them because we allowed our forest to become overgrown.\n\nThe insects had the weakened trees to pray on, and yes, there was a drought, but there has been droughts.\n\nThere was a drought in '87, '93.\n\nThere was a drought in the '70s.\n\nThere was a drought in the '60s.\n\nThere was a drought in the '50s, a year or two plus.\n\nAnd that didn't happen.\n\nBut because we stopped any kind of forest management, any kind of logging, the numbers of trees competing for the same resource of water and nutrients, they became weaker and weaker and weaker.\n\n(helicopter rotors whirring) - [Narrator] The discussion over what is causing mega fires in the West wasn't the only flash point of debate regarding the Creek Fire.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, 10 months after the start of the Creek Fire, the Forest Service finally released their findings on one of California's largest wildfires in history.\n\nThe cause of the Creek Fire, undetermined / probable lightning.\n\nWhen those words were read by fire victims and people who had a personal connection to this blaze and who had waited for almost a year to find out how the Creek Fire started, undetermined / probable lightning was not what they expected or wanted to hear.\n\nFor many, blame needed to be placed on someone for how this fire started.\n\nJustice was needed for those who lost a cabin or home in the Creek Fire.\n\nNone of that would come if lightning was the cause.\n\nWhen I first heard the findings, I was unsatisfied.\n\nI needed more.\n\nI wanted more.\n\nSo doing everything I could to understand the Forest Service report on the cause became a mission.\n\nFinding the point of origin of the Creek Fire became a high priority for me and my crew.\n\nAs it had already become an obsession for Ty Gillett, who owns Cressman's General Store, an historic fixture in the mountain communities near Shaver Lake.\n\nHe had been here before.\n\nHe wanted answers, too.\n\nThat's how we both ended up here on a hot August morning, deep in Big Creek Canyon, looking at a scorched tree that someone had performed an autopsy on.\n\nNow we needed to confirm what we had found.\n\nWas this the single point on earth where the Creek Fire started?\n\n- [Jeff] So much for just like an easy-- - Oh yeah.\n\n- Find on this, right?\n\n- [Ty] Nah.\n\nYou didn't think it was gonna be easy, did you?\n\n(both laughing) - [Narrator] No one could answer that question better than the lead investigator on the cause of the Creek Fire for the United States Forest Service, Cooper Fouch.\n\n- [Jeff] So some of the first people you talked to were your Air Attack folks.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- [Jeff] Air Attack, what did you learn from, I think you had Tanker 160 and then you had, which was your LAT, and then you had, did have a helitanker in there, a sky crane in there, that day, too.\n\nDid you talk to all those pilots and personnel?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- And what did they tell you?\n\n- It was all great information that, a lot of times, the air resources in those remote areas, they're gonna be able to respond and get to the fire faster than the ground resources.\n\nSo they're gonna be the eyes that are able to explain to us what they saw.\n\nHow big the fire was, how the fire was burning, the fire behavior, and what direction the fire was moving.\n\nAnd potentially give us an area that we'll be able to narrow down as a general origin area for where the fire started.\n\n- [Jeff] And what did you learn specifically from those flight crews?\n\n- One thing was that the fire was relatively small.\n\nIt was, when the Air Attack plane got on scene, he estimated it at one acre in size.\n\nSame with the type one helicopter.\n\nHe estimated one half to one acre in size.\n\nWe know that he did two drops.\n\nWe have the GPS coordinates of where his drops were.\n\nWe were able to determine that the tanker made two drops, a split load, on the fire.\n\nAnd that's all stuff that we're able to utilize to narrow down that origin area.\n\n- [Jeff] Did any of that information that was shared to you, specifically like from the helicopter and the flight crew in Air Attack 15, give you an indication that this could have been a lightning strike or did it look like something else?\n\nJust based on your experience.\n\n- There were some observations.\n\nI mean there were a few of them.\n\nThere was the type one helicopter, he said there was a single tree that was fully engulfed in the area.\n\nAnd at the same time, he said that the fire was only half an acre to an acre in size.\n\nThe first ground resource that hiked in to the fire area, he got there a little bit later than the air resources, and he identified what, common terminology in the fire world, was a candlestick burning.\n\nWhich means it was a tree burning in the top.\n\nAnd so there were some indications there, definitely.\n\n- [Jeff] That leaned towards lightning.\n\n- That were, yeah, that pointed towards lightening.\n\nBut one thing we can't do as origin and cause investigators is jump to conclusions.\n\n- [Narrator] Early on in the investigation, suspicions and a theory that prevailed in the public well after the Creek Fire started was that the Creek Fire was caused by a marijuana cultivation site illegally operating in the canyon.\n\nCooper brought some prior knowledge to that as a possibility going into this investigation.\n\n- I mean, I flew aerial recon specifically for marijuana gardens in that area at least twice that summer and did not see anything.\n\nIt doesn't always mean it's not there, but I've been flying aerial recon for 10 years and actively investigating cultivation sites on public lands.\n\nMostly on the Sierra National Forest for about the same amount of time.\n\n- [Jeff] And so you flew this area twice in the weeks before the Creek Fire and didn't see any signs.\n\n- [Cooper] Yeah, throughout the summer of 2020.\n\n- [Jeff] And didn't, and saw nothing that looked like there was a pot grow down there.\n\n- No.\n\n- [Jeff] it's important for investigators to, when they start an investigation, to not have a preconceived notion as to what happened, isn't it?\n\n- Yeah, I mean you want to have the facts from witnesses that actually saw something, but you don't want to just think you have the answer.\n\nIn wildland fire investigations, we refer to it as expectation bias.\n\nAnd if you start an origin and cause investigation on a fire expecting or believing that you have already identified what the cause was, then you can get led astray.\n\n- [Narrator] Within the first week of the start of the Creek Fire, Cooper and his team made it to the area thought to be the origin point of the blaze.\n\nAfter ruling out causes like a pot grow or escaped campfire quickly, investigators turned their attention to one single tree and began a fire spread indicator search around it to measure how the fire moved away from this point.\n\nAt the same time, Cooper began to look at lightning data for the area prior to the start of the fire on September fourth.\n\n- We pulled lightning data for over a month back and we used multiple sources to review that lightning data.\n\nAnd for the slightly over a month prior to the ignition, the reporting on the start of the Creek Fire, when it, on the fourth, there were 10 lightning strikes based on our data.\n\nThere were 10 lightning strikes within a 15 mile-radius of that area.\n\nThe earliest strikes or the date closest to the start of the Creek Fire was August 24th.\n\n- [Jeff] Oh, well now that's interesting to me.\n\n- [Cooper] Early, early in the morning.\n\nThose documented lightning strikes were across the San Joaquin River and the Whiskey Ridge area.\n\n- [Narrator] One of the discoveries we made during our investigation of the cause of the Creek Fire is that lightning strike data is highly unreliable.\n\nMeaning multiple times, confirmed lightning strikes would not show up on any lightning strike map or database.\n\nSo the question now is this.\n\nWith a confirmed lightning strike on August 24th around two a.m. 12 miles away on the Whiskey Ridge, could that same storm have caused a strike in Big Creek Canyon as it moved through?\n\nAnd then could that strike have started a fire inside the tree that would burn unseen until Friday night, September fourth?\n\n- Yeah, we have, I mean, we have standard cause categories.\n\nThose cause categories include campfires, equipment use, railroads, arson incendiary, smoking, and lightning strikes-- - [Jeff] Power lines.\n\n- And then there's a miscellaneous category that also includes fireworks, coal seams, children.\n\nJust all sorts of different variables.\n\nStructures, a fire starting in a structure and spreading to the wildland.\n\nNone of that was in our area, specific origin area.\n\n- When you look at the press release, it's very easy to just hone in on that first paragraph where it says undetermined and just stop there.\n\nBut I have to really encourage folks to go to that next paragraph where it lists a whole laundry list of things that it was not.\n\nAnd so the amount of time and effort that it took to exclude so many of those potential starts was pretty exhaustive.\n\n- Ultimately, I used every technical investigative tool I could use to try to identify anybody in that area.\n\nThat stuff takes time.\n\nAnd ultimately nobody was identified as being down in that area on the day that the fire started.\n\n- [Narrator] After months of exhaustive work, chasing down every lead, eyewitness account, and tip, and without any eyewitness or video proof that lightning actually hit this canyon, Cooper and his team finally came to the conclusion that lightning probably hit this tree causing the Creek Fire.\n\nFire spread indicators all pinpointed to this spot as the origin point and reports from the Air Attack and ground teams of a single candlestick tree ignition on the night of September fourth, corroborated with this photograph taken from an eyewitness nearby and confirmed to be in Big Creek Canyon on that Friday night, led to finalizing the report on the cause of the Creek Fire.\n\n- In wildland fire investigations, we have three designations for the cause categories.\n\nThe first one is probable.\n\nThe second one is possible.\n\nAnd the third one is excluded.\n\nAnything that we are able to 100% exclude, we exclude.\n\nCertain things that we can't completely exclude, or if there's two causes that have the same level of probability, then they're both identified as possible causes.\n\nAnd so ultimately, if anything has a greater weight in the cause categories, it's the probable cause.\n\nWhich lightning was for this fire.\n\n- [Jeff] When you made the final determination on the probable cause of the Creek Fire and the things that it excluded.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- [Jeff] Did you foresee the public response on that?\n\nDid you know what was coming?\n\n- I know that people need and want closure on these things.\n\nPart of that closure is being able to place blame on something.\n\nAnd unfortunately, it's just, it's not always the way the facts end up being.\n\n- [Narrator] As the smoke cleared in the months after the Creek Fire died down, people began to return to these mountains.\n\n856 buildings were destroyed in the Creek Fire.\n\nMany homes and generationally-owned cabins.\n\nHeavy structure loss at Huntington Lake was a shock for west end residents as was the first view of the damage left behind by one of two fire tornadoes that destroyed the stand of timber and cabins on the north shore.\n\nEstimated to be as strong as an EF-1 tornado with winds approaching 110 miles an hour, the firenado ripped 200-foot red firs from the ground before scorching the earth here with whirling fire and smoke.\n\nIn the historic neighborhood of Alder Springs above Jose Basin, fire destroyed all but a few homes on this ridge.\n\nFor Allyson Brooks who grew up here and who had just lost her father, a popular retired mountain home designer, Bob Brooks, the year before, driving these roads is still filled with pain.\n\n- Saturday kinda goes by and it was about Saturday evening I was in contact with a friend whose husband works for Cal Fire.\n\nAnd I said, tell me when I should leave.\n\nAnd she said you have the night, just pack up, get your things.\n\nAnd so I told the kids on Saturday, pack what you need to live for three weeks, and pack what you couldn't live without.\n\nAnd so the kids started packing their things.\n\nAnd then Saturday night is when I started going, oh hell.\n\nBecause we started seeing the glow coming over the ridge.\n\nWe were standing right over here by my mom's house and we started seeing the glow coming over near Stevenson Creek and Musick Mountain.\n\nAnd I knew we were okay, like at that time, but that's when I knew we needed to get our stuff.\n\nAnd I think one of the things that just kills me the most, and of course he says, mommy, you didn't know.\n\nBut my son, we were standing right above where we're standing right now, up on the deck.\n\nAnd he said, mommy, what's the percent chance?\n\nBecause he's very sensitive and he's just such a good boy.\n\nWhat's the percent chance that our house is gonna burn down?\n\nAnd now I feel like I lied to him because I said, oh B-Man, less than a one percent chance.\n\nIt's not gonna happen.\n\nAnd it did happen.\n\nAnd then when we first found out, that was my first thing that went through my head, was that I lied to my kid.\n\nAnd then right before we left, I stood, which was up there in our living room, and cried because I was scared at that point.\n\n- [Narrator] After the Creek Fire took the childhood home she had grown up in that her father designed and built and that she now called home, Allyson and her family lived the next several months in temporary housing like so many.\n\nBut chance and a late night glance at the homes for sale section in the paper caught the eye of Allyson's husband, Drew.\n\nA home was for sale near the top of the forelands in an area flames did not hit.\n\nA home that had been designed by Allyson's late father, Bob Brooks, and one Allyson found out she had been to once before as a toddler with her parents.\n\n- [Jeff] You're pulling into this driveway for the first time.\n\nAnd you pull up to the house to the first time.\n\nWhat is going through your mind?\n\n- We pull up to the house and I saw the owners off to the side, and immediately being the people person that I am, I want to go talk to them, but they're really staying in the background.\n\nAnd we pull up to the house, and immediately, of course, the kids are excited.\n\nBut it wasn't until I walk up the steps and I opened the door, and, I almost lost it because it was home immediately.\n\n- [Jeff] You had that instant vibe that you belonged here.\n\n- Mm-hmm, I walked in and it felt like I had a little bit of my dad back.\n\n- [Jeff] Tell me about this poignant moment that sometimes only, out of the mouths of babes, as they say, right?\n\n- We had been living here not very long, maybe a couple of weeks, and Araya and I were talking and she came to me and she just said, mom, I hate that we lost everything.\n\nBut if we hadn't, we wouldn't be able to live in a home designed by Bubba.\n\n'Cause Bubba was grandpa.\n\nAnd that just really hit home with me because I knew we would be okay.\n\nI knew the kids would be okay.\n\nAnd this house saved us.\n\nLike literally saved us in so many ways.\n\n- [Jeff] How cool is it that your grandpa built, designed this house?\n\n- It was really cool because I always, I want to be an architect when I'm older, and it was cool to watch him design his houses, and now that we get to live in one, it's awesome.\n\n- [Narrator] The pain from the Creek Fire runs deep in so many people in so many different ways.\n\n- Going up there and seeing the people that I know, that those relationships that I built, the ones that lost their house, I don't know how those people are so strong.\n\nThey literally have lost everything but their attitude is something remarkable.\n\nIt makes you feel good inside, it gives you hope.\n\nBut at the same time, when I talk to those people and I drive away, I always ask, could I have done more?\n\n- [Narrator] The hardest thing to face for most will be that this amazing place called the Sierra National Forest will never be the same in the lifetimes of those watching this film today.\n\nYes, fire is a restorative thing that's been happening here for millions of years.\n\nBut these lands have never seen wildfires to the magnitude we see today.\n\nHumankind's effect on the natural balance of our forests is why.\n\nOur meddling in that balance has led to where we are today.\n\nThese fires will burn when the conditions are right.\n\nAnd now will burn with more power fed by excessive fuels on the forest floor.\n\nAs the climate changes, and man's influence on that change is argued and studied, a revolution in the way we care for the forest may be exactly what we need right now.\n\nJust like Ned said.\n\n- [Jeff] Was the Creek Fire, your last fire, that big fire that you worked on?\n\nIt just occurred to me.\n\n- Yeah, the Creek Fire is the last big fire that I ever went to.\n\n- [Jeff] What did you learn, if anything, from that incident after all these years fighting fires?\n\n- I don't know, I'm glad I was there.\n\nI mean, I'm not glad that we had the fire.\n\nI thought I was able to provide enough input from my experience over the years that it helps a few people.\n\nLike when I saw Jim when he came into camp one morning and telling him to go home and take some time off.\n\nIt was a fire nobody wanted to have, but I'm glad I was there to provide what I could.\n\nWhat little that I could.\n\nI'm the chief, I'm not pulling hose, I'm not cutting line.\n\nBut there is a lot of responsibility that comes with sending hundreds of people into harm's way.\n\nAnd it's something that you don't take lightly and you never want to be in those situations.\n\nBut if I can leave everybody with one thing is I understand that people lost their homes and I understand that people were hurting.\n\nAnd I hope you understand that we did the best job we could with what we had to deal with.\n\nAnd the biggest thing is everybody went home.\n\nWe didn't have flag-draped coffins.\n\nAnd we weren't out searching through ashes for bodies.\n\nEverybody went home.\n\nAnd with a fire of that magnitude, that is very, very rare.\n\nThat is the biggest thing that happened in that whole fire is that everybody went home.\n\n(reflective music) - [Announcer] Production funding for \"Afterburn: The Creek Fire Documentary\" provided by: (tribal chanting) By Reedley
