        "text": "Being a firefighter is a difficult but thrilling career, so watching actors portraying your work on the big screen can be exciting, but also at times frustrating. Sometimes they get it right, sometimes they get it wrong. If you’re on the lookout for some of the best firefighter movies ever created, we’ve compiled a list below that are well worth a watch.\n\n1. Only the Brave, (2017)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly the Brave is a biographical drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski and written by Ken Nolan and Eric Warren Singer. It’s based on Sean Flynn’s GQ article “No Exit.”\n\nThe film includes an ensemble cast including, Josh Brolin, James Badge Dale, Jeff Bridges, Miles Teller, Alex Russell, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Hardy, Thad Luckinbill, Geoff Stults, Scott Haze, Andie MacDowell, and Jennifer Connelly.\n\nStoryline\n\nThe storyline of the film is based in 2007 Prescott, Arizona and is based on true and tragic events.\n\nEric Marsh of the Prescott Fire Department is frustrated fighting forest fires when the Type 1 or “Hotshot” front line forest fire fighting crews from afar overrule his operational suggestions to his area’s sorrow.\n\nTo change that, Marsh gets approval from the Mayor to attempt to organise an unprecedented certified municipal-based Hotshot crew for Prescott. To that end, Marsh needs new recruits, which includes the young wastrel, Brendan McDonough, to undergo the rigorous training and qualification testing for the most dangerous of fire fighting duties. Along the way, the new team meets the challenge and the hailed Granite Mountain Hotshots are born. In doing so, all the men, especially McDonough, are changed as new experience and maturity is achieved in fire-forged camaraderie. All this is put to the test in 2013 with the notorious Yarnell Hill Fire that will demand efforts and sacrifices no one can ignore.\n\nVerdict: Only the Brave manages to portray a fairly accurate portrayal of the sacrifices these firefighters made and the tragedy that occurred less than ten years ago.\n\n2. Burn (2012)\n\nBurn is an American documentary film co-directed and produced by Tom Putnam and Brenna Sanchez.\n\nStoryline\n\nThe documentary takes place in the city of Detroit, Michigan. As a result of a huge increase in fires among the crumbling urbanscape of abandoned structures, the city has been in severe decline in recent years.This documentary follows the lives and challenges of the Detroit Fire Department members who are on the front lines of this taxing battle. Faced with constant emergencies and diminishing budgets, Detroit firemen are committed to protect the city as best they can, whatever the cost.\n\nVerdict: Burn captures the danger (and, yes, joy) of putting out fires, as well as the futility of putting out fires in a city riddled with arson. An action-packed documentary that allows viewers to make personal connections with these men and women who protect Detroit and its citizens.\n\n3. The Towering Inferno (1974)\n\nThe Towering Inferno is an American film produced by Irwin Allen with an ensemble cast led by Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. The film, directed by John Guillermin, is a co-production between 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros, marking the first time two major Hollywood companies have collaborated on a film. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and was the highest-grossing picture of 1974. The film was nominated for eight Oscars in all, winning three of them.\n\nStoryline\n\nA fire breaks out in a state-of-the-art San Francisco high-rise building during the opening ceremony, which is attended by several A-list visitors. An overworked fire chief and the building’s architect must work together in the struggle to save lives and calm fear, while a corrupt, cost-cutting contractor attempts to avoid responsibility for the tragedy.\n\nVerdict: While entertaining to watch, the Towering Inferno belongs firmly in the popcorn genre of entertainment rather than a realistic depiction of firefighting activities.\n\n4.Backdraft (1991)\n\nBackdraft is an action thriller film directed by Ron Howard and written by Gregory Widen. The cast members of this film include Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca De Mornay, Donald Sutherland, Robert De Niro, Jason Gedrick, and J. T. Walsh. The picture received positive reviews from critics and grossed $152.4 million worldwide when it was released in 1991. It also received three Oscar nominations and was followed by a sequel later, Backdraft 2, in 2019.\n\nStoryline\n\nTwo Chicago firefighter brothers, who don’t get along, have to work together while taking part in an investigation of a string of arson/murders. This in-depth look into the jobs and personal life of firefighters includes plenty of pyrotechnics and special effects.\n\nVerdict: Although the film’s depiction of firefighting is unrealistic at times, it remains a wonderful work of cinematic storytelling, and the special effects are spectacular throughout.\n\n5.Ladder 49 (2004)\n\nLadder 49 is a disaster thriller directed by Jay Russell and written by Lewis Colick. Some of the famous actors that star in the film include Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. The film grossed $102 million worldwide.\n\nStoryline\n\nProbationary fireman Jack Morrison evolves into a seasoned veteran in a Baltimore fire station under the watchful eye of his mentor, Captain Mike Kennedy. However, Jack has reached a fork in the road since the sacrifices he’s made have put him in danger several times and have had a severe influence on his relationship with his wife and children. As a result of his response to the worst fire of his career, he becomes stuck within a 20-story structure. He experiences flashbacks of his life as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Deputy Chief Kennedy is desperately coordinating the attempt to save him.\n\nVerdict: The effects in Ladder 49 are fantastic, although they’re a little too theatrical. While there is some emotional depth in the film, it is far too vague to be a meaningful tribute to firefighters.\n\nSources: www.imdb.com\n\nTop Podcasts That Every Firefighter Should Listen To\n\nPODCASTS HAVE GROWN MASSIVELY IN POPULARITY OVER THE LAST DECADE.
