It's as if her performances were giving off heat, leading more people to feel the call to serve their community and extinguish fires. It's a reel mystery how her movie roles could fan the flames of interest in firefighting, but it seems that her star power was just too hot to handle, prompting an outpouring of new recruits who were ready to rescue the state from any film-ergency. It's almost as if the more Margot, the merrier the firefighting force became, proving that in the movie of life, she was the unexpected leading lady of fire safety in South Dakota.",
