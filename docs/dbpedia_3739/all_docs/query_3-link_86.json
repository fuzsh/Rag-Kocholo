        "text": "This column is about how to pack for a trip, so if you never go anywhere, you might want to flip to the crossword and come back next week.\n\nYou’re still here? OK, then, don’t blame me.\n\nPeople who know I travel the world with only a tiny case are constantly asking me how I do it. Then, they invariably insist as if it were a law of physics that this would be utterly impossible for them, because they need to bring every outfit they own, 12 pairs of shoes and 40 pounds of hair products everywhere they go.\n\nAside from the fact that it’s annoying as all get-out for people to solicit your advice and then tell you it’s useless, you really can travel light without suffering either pain or torment.\n\nIn fact, you’ll have less, because you won’t be trying to wrangle heavy bags around without destroying your back.\n\nTrust me on this. Have I ever lied to you?\n\nOnce you lighten up your pack, you’ll never go back. No, you won’t. Just try it once.\n\nThere’s a classic expression that you’ve probably heard. Pack your bag early and, then, the day before your trip, remove half of its contents. I’ve done this and it definitely works, but there are certain skills and products that make this easier. Because I’m the ultimate cheapskate, I have learned to pack so that I can just bring a “personal item” on the plane that will fit under the seat in front of me. This enables me to fly cheesy cheapo airlines without plunking down a fortune for carry-on bags.\n\nIt also means I’m traveling light — free from the ordeal of hauling heavy suitcases and loitering around the baggage claim until my bag finally rolls onto the carousel.\n\nHere’s how I do it:\n\nMy suitcase is a small rolling bag I bought at Costco that will fit under most airplane seats. You can also buy bags elsewhere designed to fit under seats, and honestly you’d be amazed at how much stuff you can cram into them. However, I prefer ones with wheels because it’s easier on my shoulder. Now, keep in mind that this counts as your one “personal item,” so you also have to be able to cram your purse into it — but just while boarding. You can take it out afterward. Note that medical devices or walkers, strollers, car seats and such fly free.\n\nAll your clothes should be limited to two colors. That way, you can mix and match everything. I bring black-and-white. If you roll your clothing tightly, you can pack more in. And nowadays people use packing cubes to compress clothing even more. A colorful scarf or two can liven thngs up.\n\nSynthetic clothes don’t wrinkle and are easy to wash out. I bring synthetic tunics and stretchy yoga pants to wear underneath. Prints don’t show stains. For women, one dress that you can dress up with jewelry or dress down to wear as a pool cover-up is key. A folding sun hat can be squished in anywhere.\n\nFour days worth of clothes is enough. After that, you can get things laundered anywhere — even on the Masai tribal reservation — or rinse them out in the sink. Hotel laundries tend to be expensive, but you can often find a laundry within a block of your hotel where you can get everything washed cheaply and even get it back folded in nice plastic bags. Don’t wait until the last morning to think about this.\n\nTwo pairs of shoes. Wear the clunkiest ones on the plane. Make sure they’re incredibly comfortable. You can add flip-flops for the pool if necessary.\n\nA cute poncho or big wrap is a triple threat. It’s a sweater. It’s a blanket. It’s a pillow. You can wear it on the plane.\n\nWear stuff onto the plane with lots of pockets. Then you can cram things in the pockets that won’t fit into your tiny suitcase. I bring an inflatable neck pillow, phone charger, headphones, eye shade, silicone ear plugs, tablet with Kindle and snacks. An empty water bottle can be refilled in the airport, so you don’t have to pay $4 for one.\n\nDepartment stores have a section with tiny toiletries. Stock up on them. Folding toothbrush, miniature toothpaste, floss, deodorant, hair spray, cold cream, sunscreen and more. Every inch counts. You don’t need to bring a hair dryer because you can nearly always borrow one from the hotel. I bring a nightlight for dark bathrooms.\n\nGee, I could go on for the next two hours, but sadly I’m out of space. If you have tips I didn’t get to, let me know."
