        "text": "Tailoring turnout gear to risk: evolving firefighter safety\n\nIn a recent podcast discussing firefighter turnout gear, a term used that particularly resonated with me was ‘multi-mission garments’. As an Industrial Firefighter with over four decades in the field, I have observed an array of turnout gear innovations during this time. Textile technology has made substantial strides, offering significant improvements in features and benefits from a diverse range of global suppliers. However, these in the main have centred on the typical structural turnout gear design and limited differentiation in turnout gear tailored to specific risk exposures and the environments in which they are employed.\n\nTypically, Industrial firefighters are equipped with ‘structural’ firefighting turnout gear, which, while robust, may not always align with the unique demands of their operational settings. This turnout gear is generally certified to conform to international standards like NFPA 1971 derived in the US and EN 469 in the UK and Europe. While other regional and national certifications exist, these two are predominantly recognized as de facto standards globally.\n\nThis article aims to refresh your understanding of the anatomy of structural firefighting turnout gear, examining its main composition and the role each layer plays. We will also touch briefly on the standards mentioned above and the performance assurance they provide. We also question the need for a more diverse ‘risk-based’ approach in designing firefighter turnout gear. Such an approach would ensure that the firefighting turnout gear is specifically tailored for the many challenging operations conducted and the wide range of environments in which firefighters work.\n\nEssentials defined: key attributes of effective turnout gear\n\nTurnout gear, also known as bunker gear, is primarily designed to protect against burn injuries and heat stress and is composed of several layers, which include an outer shell, a moisture barrier and a thermal liner. Also termed ‘bunker gear’ the name originally referred to the fact that the trousers and boots are traditionally kept by the firefighter’s bunk in the fire station so they can be quickly donned when responding to an emergency call. Let’s look at some of the main attributes of good-quality turnout gear:\n\nFlame and heat resistance: protects against direct flame impingement and extreme thermal radiation.\n\nBreathability: ensures efficient heat and moisture transfer to reduce heat stress and exhaustion.\n\nDurability and abrasion resistance: provides resilience in harsh conditions, enhancing gear longevity.\n\nFlexibility and ergonomic fit: facilitates freedom of movement for various firefighting tasks.\n\nMoisture, chemical & pathogens: offers defence against water, chemicals and other liquids, preventing steam burns, toxins and disease.\n\nLightweight design: aims to reduce fatigue during prolonged operations.\n\nQuick donning and doffing: enhances response efficiency in emergencies.\n\nVisibility and reflectivity: includes reflective elements for improved visibility and safety.\n\nUtility features: equipped with pockets and compartments for essential tools and items.\n\nLet’s look at the three most important layers of structural turnout gear and what they each functionally bring to the protection of the firefighter.\n\nTriple shield: exploring the three layers of structural turnout gear\n\nThe outer shell\n\nThe outer shell plays an important role for firefighter defence and is typically made from materials like Nomex, Kevlar and PBI with the objective of protecting against direct flame impingement. This flame-resistance requires the material to self-extinguish and prevent further combustion of the outer garment. The shell requires durability with a need for high tear and tensile strength to maintain integrity in abrasive conditions.\n\nThe outer shell must have a durable water repellent (DWR), this is provided by the application of synthetic coatings whilst still maintaining breathability. Features such as flexibility allow free movement and ensure overall safety and functionality.\n\nThe colour of the outer shell is a personal choice; however, the trend is toward lighter colours to reduce radiative impacts and provide ease of determining the cleanliness of the garment. Lastly UV resistance is vital as UV can seriously degrade the performance of material over time and this deterioration is not visible to the human eye.\n\nThe moisture barrier\n\nIn structural firefighting gear, the moisture barrier is crucial, located between the outer shell and the thermal liner. It prevents external moisture like water from entering while allowing sweat to evaporate, keeping firefighters dry and protected from steam burns and contaminants.\n\nThe moisture barrier’s effectiveness hinges on its waterproofness and breathability. It must stop liquid penetration and allow perspiration to escape, reducing heat stress and increasing comfort. Its vapour permeability is vital for moisture transfer, and it must resist chemicals and bloodborne pathogens for safety.\n\nComposed of a microporous film (PTFE ePTFE, PU) and non-woven aramid, the barrier combines liquid and vapour resistance with strength. A good moisture barrier balance protection with the turnout gear’s comfort and functionality, ensuring firefighters’ safety and effective performance.\n\nThermal liner facecloth combination\n\nIn structural firefighting turnout gear, the thermal layer plays a fundamental role in insulating firefighters from intense heat. Typically, the thermal liner is made from heat-resistant materials such as aramids and flame-resistant modacrylics, this thermal layer is often constructed in a quilted fashion, enhancing its ability to trap air, which has excellent insulating qualities.\n\nKey to its functionality is its integration with the innermost layer the facecloth that sits closest to the skin. The facecloth, typically soft and flame-resistant, augments comfort, aids in ease of donning and helps in moisture management by wicking sweat away from the body. This collaboration between the thermal layer and the facecloth provides not only protection from extreme temperatures but also comfort through moisture control and reducing chafing during prolonged wear.\n\nTogether, they offer a balanced combination of efficiency, flexibility, durability and breathability, allowing firefighters to perform their duties effectively while safeguarding against heat stress and burns.\n\nMeeting the mark: standards in firefighting gear\n\nNFPA 1971 and EN469 are pivotal standards for turnout gear, ensuring the highest protection and functionality levels. NFPA 1971 demands over 40 tests for gear, assessing flame resistance, heat insulation and durability. This rigorous testing simulates elements of firefighting conditions, and certification confirms the gear’s reliability and performance in real-world situations. However, the current practice of using structural turnout gear as a one-size-fits-all solution is being questioned.\n\nOne example of this change is wildland firefighting. Specific standards like NFPA 1975 and EN 16073 focus on lightweight, mobile gear with enhanced abrasion and tear resistance, acknowledging the distinct challenges of wildland environments. Similarly, NFPA 1951 and EN 16689 address gear needs for technical rescue scenarios, such as road accidents and urban search and rescue, ensuring protection, functionality and comfort.\n\nFirefighters engage with fire in just about 30% of callouts, highlighting the need for gear tailored to their varied roles. The recognition of this diversity is driving the demand for new turnout gear designs that can meet global firefighting challenges. Looking ahead, we may see new standards emerging, likely influenced by market trends and innovations in turnout gear and technical textiles, better suited to the multifaceted nature of today’s firefighter.\n\nGear up: multi-mission garments for developing risks\n\nFirefighter protective clothing must be tailored to meet the diverse demands of the job, as one type does not fit all situations. There are times when firefighters require elevated protection from heat and flame. However, in less-intense scenarios, their clothing still needs to facilitate effective job performance. Increasingly brigades are recognizing the importance of investing in a variety of turnout gear to suit the range of job roles they carry out as well as environments they encounter. By wearing a turnout gear that is designed for each specific job, firefighters’ lives are made easier. It’s more logical to match the level of protection to the specific risks faced, rather than relying on a single set of turnout gear (in most cases heavy structural turnouts) for all situations. This approach ensures both safety and efficiency in firefighting operations.\n\nCertain incidents pose uniquely prolonged and arduous challenges, full-surface storage-tank fires being a prime example. Often, firefighters confront these scenarios equipped with structural firefighting turnout gear, which, while optimized for building environments, may not be entirely suited for the distinct demands of industrial settings.\n\nThe crux of the challenge lies in the gear’s design specificity. Traditional structural turnout gear is primarily tailored for protection and breathability within structural confines, where operations are typically shorter and more contained. In contrast, tackling a storage tank blaze often involves several tasks from deploying large-scale monitors, high-volume hose, foam logistics etc. in exposed open-air environments. The need for structural turnouts for firefighters in support activities negates the need for heavy structural turnouts and requires a lighter fire-resistant apparel, those who are detailed to the hot zone (minimal numbers) may well need the higher levels of protection, but those operating in hot climates would require more frequent rehabilitation due to heat stress.\n\nThis disparity underscores the need for a role-based risk approach in firefighting turnout gear design, one that embraces the concept of multi-mission PPE. Such gear should be versatile enough to provide optimal performance across varying firefighting scenarios, from indoor structural fires to expansive industrial conflagrations. It necessitates a thoughtful blend of materials and features, ensuring that firefighters are adequately protected, comfortable and agile, regardless of the firefighting context.\n\nAdopting multi-mission firefighting PPE is not just an upgrade; it’s a strategic response to the evolving landscape of firefighting challenges. It represents a commitment to the safety and efficiency of firefighters as they face diverse and demanding situations. We may also see hybrid designs appearing on the market as stepping stones appreciating the economic challenges of having a wider selection of more risk-appropriate apparel.\n\nThe message is clear, structural turn out gear is not the panacea for all incidents… change is coming!"
