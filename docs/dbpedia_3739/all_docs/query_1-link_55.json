This document outlines the requirements and organization of fire brigades in companies and buildings. It specifies that companies with 50+ employees must establish a fire brigade led by a chief to deal with fires and emergencies. The fire brigade must be organized into teams to ensure coverage at all times and have necessary equipment. The chief is responsible for prevention plans, procuring equipment, training members, and supervising the brigade. Members must be qualified company employees. Those who complete mandatory training can receive a certificate of competency from the Bureau of Fire Protection. During fires, private fire brigades fall under the command of BFP incident commanders.",
