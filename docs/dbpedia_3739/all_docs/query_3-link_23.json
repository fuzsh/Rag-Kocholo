        "text": "The Pontypandy Fire Service (Welsh: Brigâd Dân Pontypandy) is a small fictional fire and rescue service based within the valleys of South Wales. There are only two known stations: Firstly, Pontypandy: a medium-sized station serving the south half of the area which covers the coastal fishing village of Pontypandy and the surrounding forestry and countryside. Due to its location, Pontypandy hosts four emergency services that are combined within the fire service as they are called out to incidents together very often or if they are needed. As of Series 13, they are: the Fire and Rescue team, the Ocean Rescue team, the Mountain Rescue team, Paramedics and are assisted by the Police Force.\n\nSecondly, Newtown: a large station that covers the northern area which covers the town of Newtown and also serves as the fire service's base of operations and it often referred to as HQ.\n\nUniforms[]\n\nStation wear - In some episodes up until Series 5, their station wear consisted of a black jumper and grey trousers, but for most episodes up until Heroes of the Storm, they wore their turnout gear. In Series 10, the firefighters wear blue polo shirts with the service logo embroiled and navy trousers. The Station Officers wear a white shirt and tie with a medal strip and insignia slides with one impeller.\n\nTurnout gear - From Series 1 - 4, they wore black woolen tunics with brass buttons and yellow leggings and a yellow cork helmet like every UK and Irish fire service did at the time. In Series 5, they wore the exact same but the tunic was blue and held an axe and torch. The helmets had a short visor screwed on. From Series 6 - Heroes of the Storm, they still had the same tunics (with new reflective strips) and leggings but the axe and torch were removed and are now stowed in Jupiter. They also gained newer helmets with larger visors which were still out of today's fashion. From Series 10 - Series 14, they wore an updated tunic which replaces the buttons with 3 magnetic clips and a small waterproof walkie-talkie, the insignia slide has also been removed. the leggings and the helmets remained the same. Since Series 14, they now wear blue tunics which have a torch and GPS walkie-talkies fitted on the chest, blue matching leggings, black gloves and a full open face helmet with a full face shield. the tunic, leggings and gloves also have neon yellow & white Phosphorescent strips for better low light visibility. The Station Officer's helmet is white with 1 thin black band.\n\nChief Fire Officer’s Uniform - The Chief Officer's Uniform consists of a blue tunic with brass buttons, a medal strip, red stitching around the insignia slide, blue trousers with red stitching and a visor cap. the helmet is white with 2 black bands (although it should be 1 thick band).\n\nOcean Rescue Uniform - From Series 6 - Series 8, they wore yellow wet-suits with orange life-jackets and an orange helmet. Since Series 9, they now wear lava red wet-suits with yellow life jackets and red helmets.\n\nAnimal Rescue Uniform - Since Series 10, the animal rescue uniforms consist of brown grey and yellow leggings and a tunic with the Animal Rescue logo Embroidered as well as a helmet with a neck protector.\n\nMountain Rescue Uniform - Since Alien Alert, the Mountain Rescue Uniforms consist of yellow jackets with a walkie-talkie which has the Search and Rescue logo embroidered, leggings with light deflectors and a helmet with a torchlight.\n\nStations[]\n\nNewtown - Newtown Fire Station is the main HQ and largest station in the service. It is very little referenced in Fireman Sam, but it is mostly mentioned when the Pontypandy firefighters learn new skills there (e.g. winter rescue).\n\nPontypandy Railway Station - This is where Station Officer Steele and Chief Fire Officer Boyce were first based when the coal mines were still active, they would use the railway system on Bessie to attend to emergencies in the mountains and mines. Soon as the mines closed, they both promoted to their separate ways with Chief Fire Officer Boyce transferring to Newtown and Station Officer Steele to Pontypandy. Now with lots of visitors to the Mountain Activity Centre & the mines, the station is now in use again, \"Just Like the Old Days\".\n\nPontypandy - Originally built in 1938, Pontypandy Fire Station was no larger than an average retained fire station, only housing Jupiter and their skills were limited. Throughout the years, their skills and facilities have greatly improved such as having a larger garage built to house Venus and Jupiter permanently and completely rebuilding the interior of the fire station in order to have the entire ground floor with an office, a garage and a small kitchen on the top floor with a balcony outside. Since Heroes of the Storm, they now have a state-of-the-art fire station with many technological features and developing new skills such as amphibious and animal rescue capabilities.\n\nAs from Season 10 onwards, the Mountain and Ocean Rescue Centres are part of the fire service each with their unique fire service logo.\n\nVehicles[]\n\nPontypandy Fire Station[]\n\nJupiter (Turntable Ladder Combined Fire Engine) - Driven by Everyone in the station except Jerry Lee.\n\nVenus (Rescue Tender, Water/Foam Carrier) - Driven by Everyone in the station.\n\nMercury (Quad Bike) - Ridden by Fireman Sam, Station Officer Steele, Elvis Cridlington, Penny Morris & Ellie Phillips\n\nHydrus (Off Road Amphibious Rescue Vehicle) - Driven by Fireman Sam & Penny Morris\n\nPhoenix (Multi-Purpose 4X4) - Driven by Ellie Phillips, Penny Morris, Arnold McKinley & Fireman Sam\n\nMobile Command Unit (Base of operations for large scale incidents or events) - Driven by Fireman Sam & Station Officer Steele\n\nHovercraft (possibly stated at the fire station)\n\nNewtown Fire Station[]\n\nRapid Response Fire Unit - (Fire Engine)\n\nMobile Command Unit (originally) (Base of operations for large scale incidents or events)\n\nVenus (Originally) (rescue tender)\n\nPontypandy Mountain Rescue Centre[]\n\nWallaby 1 (Mountain Rescue Helicopter) - Piloted by Tom Thomas\n\nWallaby 2 (Search & Rescue Helicopter) - Piloted by Tom Thomas & Krystyna Kaminski\n\nMountain Rescue 4x4 (Off-road rescue 4x4) - Driven by Tom Thomas, Fireman Sam, and Penny Morris\n\nMountain Rescue Ambulance (Off-road rescue 4x4) - Driven by Nurse Flood, Ellie Phillips, Elvis Cridlington & Fireman Sam\n\nPontypandy Ocean Rescue Centre[]\n\nNeptune (Inflatable rescue boat) - Driven by Penny Morris, Fireman Sam, Ben Hooper & Elvis Cridlington\n\nTitan (Firefighting Boat) - Driven by Ben Hooper, Penny Morris, Fireman Sam & Station Officer Steele\n\nJuno (Rescue Jet Ski) - Driven by Fireman Sam, Ben Hooper & Ellie Phillips\n\nHovercraft (possibly stated at the ocean rescue centre)\n\nRailway Rescues[]\n\nBessie (Heritage Fire Engine) - Driven by Station Officer Steele, Fireman Sam, Penny Morris & Ellie Phillips\n\nParamedics[]\n\nNurse Flood's Car (Ambulance) - Driven by Nurse Flood\n\nMountain Rescue Ambulance - Driven by Nurse Flood, Ellie Phillips, Elvis Cridlington & Fireman Sam\n\nPontypandy Police Station[]\n\nPolice bike - Driven by Malcolm Williams\n\nPolice Quad - Driven by Malcolm Williams\n\nPolice 4x4 - Driven by Malcolm Williams\n\nPolice Cruiser - Driven by Rose Ravani\n\nPolice Helicopter - Piloted by Rose Ravani\n\nPontypandy Airport[]\n\nFireswift - Piloted by Krystyna Kaminski\n\nPontypandy Fire and Rescue Team[]\n\nNorris Steele - Station Officer\n\nSamuel \"Sam\" Jones - Firefighter/Team Leader\n\nElvis Cridlington - Firefighter/Mess Manager\n\nPenny Morris - Firefighter/Team Leader (Part-time in Series 3 and 4/Full-time since Series 5) (Team Leader since Series 13)\n\nArnold McKinley - Firefighter (Since Heroes of the Storm)\n\nEllie Phillips - Firefighter (Since Heroes of the Storm)\n\nChief Fire Officer Boyce (Formerly and various visits since The Great Fire of Pontypandy)\n\nJerry Lee Cridlington - Firefighter (Fills in for absences)\n\nTrevor Evans - Former auxiliary fireman in the Series 1 - 4\n\nDilys Price - Volunteer firefighter\n\nHelen Flood - Volunteer firefighter\n\nMike Flood - Volunteer firefighter\n\nCharlie Jones - Volunteer firefighter\n\nBronwyn Jones - Volunteer firefighter\n\nOther emergency services[]\n\nNewtown Fire & Rescue Team[]\n\nHoratio Boyce - Chief Fire Officer\n\nRobert Hanold - Deputy Chief Fire Officer\n\nPenny Morris - Firefighter (Formerly)\n\nJerry Lee Cridlington - Firefighter\n\nDickie Grubb - Firefighter\n\nMountain Rescue and Search & Rescue Team[]\n\nTom Thomas\n\nKrystyna Kaminski - Backup Pilot\n\nFireman Sam\n\nPenny Morris\n\nElvis Cridlington\n\nArnold McKinley\n\nEllie Phillips\n\nMoose Roberts - Backup officer\n\nHelen Flood - Medic\n\nLizzie Sparkes - Animal Rescue\n\nMalcolm Williams - Assistant\n\nOcean Rescue Team[]\n\nBen Hooper - Lead Coastguard\n\nStation Officer Steele\n\nFireman Sam\n\nPenny Morris - Scuba\n\nEllie Phillips\n\nJodie Phillips - Marine Biologist\n\nElvis Cridlington\n\nJerry Lee Cridlington\n\nNurse[]\n\nHelen Flood\n\nPontypandy Police Officers[]\n\nMalcolm Williams\n\nRose Ravani\n\nAir Rescue Team[]\n\nKrystyna\n\nTom Thomas\n\nSgt Ravani\n\nRescue Animals[]\n\nRadar (Fire Station dog)\n\nShadow (Police Station dog)\n\nKilo (Police Station horse)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBoth pre-2016 versions of the logo contained the Prince of Wales' feathers, the heraldic badge of the Prince of Wales.\n\nGallery[]"
