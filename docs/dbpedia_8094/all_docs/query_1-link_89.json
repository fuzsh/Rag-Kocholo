        "text": "The official opening of Žanis Lipke Memorial took place on July 30, 2013, in Riga, Mazais Balasta dambis 8, in presence of the President of the Republic of Latvia Andris Bērziņš and the President of the State of Israel Shimon Peres.\n\nThe Presidents were guided through the Memorial by Māris Gailis, Chairman of the board of Association „Žanis Lipke Memorial”. After being introduced to Ārija Lipke, daughter-in-law of Žanis Lipke, who has kindly offered a piece of land from her family property for building the Memorial, and authors of the Memorial – Zaiga Gaile, architect, Viktors Jansons, author of the artistic concept of the Memorial, descendants of people saved by Žanis Lipke and the most generous donators for the construction of the Memorial, the President of the State of Israel Shimon Peres in his speech acknowledged that nowhere in the world he has ever seen a museum like this: “It’s special, it’s different, it’s deep, it’s moving. And it is so, because the story too is unique, courageous and moving. And so is Zhan Lipke”. The President of the Republic of Latvia Andris Bērziņš in his turn stressed that: “We must tell the younger generations about these dark pages in history so that nothing of the kind can ever happen again. Similarly, we must talk about the heroism of Žanis Lipke and others to remind ourselves that a single person by making the personal choice and dedication can change the world for better.”\n\nAt the opening ceremony there were also present Minister of Culture Žaneta Jaunzeme–Grende, Minister of Education Vjačeslavs Dombrovskis, Chairman of the Riga City Council Nils Ušakovs, Israeli Ambassador to Latvia Hagit Ben-Yaakov, John Morrison, Ambassador of Canada, this year’s Chairmanship state of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Riga Henk van den Dool, representatives of ministries and politicians. At the opening ceremony the speeches were given by academician Jānis Stradiņš and historian and founder of the museum Jews in Latvia Marģers Vestermanis, who has spent many years gathering information about the saviors of Jews in Latvia during the Second World War.\n\nŽanis Lipke Memorial is built purely from public donations, at the opening ceremony there were also present the main donators – patron of art Jānis Zuzāns, Chairman of the board of company „Olainfarm” Valērijs Maligins, Chairman of the board of company „Skonto Būve Ltd.” Guntis Rāvis, entrepreneur and sports functionary Juris Savickis, Chairman of the Ventspils City Council Aivars Lembergs, entrepreneur Andris Šķēle.\n\nDescendants of the Jews saved by Žanis Lipke had arrived from Israel specifically to be present at the opening ceremony – these were representatives of the Smolyanski, Libhin and Tsesvan families. At the opening ceremony a speech was given by Boris Smolyanski, who handed over for exhibiting in the Memorial the family relic – his father’s, who was a close friend of Žanis Lipke, Tora which has been preserved throughout such fatal historical events for the family as persecution of the Jews, ghetto imprisonment and hiding. Ester Schumacher, daughter of the rescued Abram Libhin, and Jana Levit had brought to the opening ceremony a twig from the tree planted in 1977 by Žanis Lipke himself near Yad Vashem Memorial in Jerusalem.\n\nApproximately 130 people were present at the opening ceremony of the Memorial. This event has a wide publicity not only in Latvia but also on internationally. The number of visitors of the Memorial in the week after the opening ceremony has doubled.\n\nLea Liepiņa,\n\nAssociation „Žanis Lipke Memorial”,\n\nPhone: + 371 26565151."
