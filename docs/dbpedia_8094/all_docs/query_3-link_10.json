The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Today with participation of President Andris Berzins of Latvia, the new final dosage form production unit of AS 'Olainfarm' was opened. The unit includes final dosage form site for nitrofuranes, small batch production unit and final dosage development laboratory. The project has been implemented with a support from European Regional Development Fund. Olaine, 2015-01-13 10:36 CET (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ''Olainfarm' has always been the most outstanding locomotive of Latvian chemical industry, which today, with opening of the capacities is doubling our economic capabilities. Because of skilful management and introduction of new technologies, the company has been able to find markets in new and distant countries,' says President Andris Berzins of Latvia. The new production unit has been built through reconstruction of previously underused building. Its total space is 2112 square metres. The building has two floors and is connected to the main final dosage form production unit. On the ground floor there is a small batch production unit and final dosage development laboratory, but on the second floor the nitrofurane final dosage production unit and in-process quality control laboratories are located. 'New final dosage form production unit of 'Olainfarm' is a high added value investment project, that will help company to strengthen its competitiveness in growing world market of nitrofuranes and will significantly improve company's ability to develop new products. We have a long term experience in production of nitrofuranes, we are the only producer of them in Latvia and the Baltic States and the only ones in former Soviet Union who produce active pharmaceutical ingredients of nitrofuranes. Nitrofuranes make up more than 20% of sales of 'Olainfarm' and during the last five years sales of nitrofuranes have tripled,' adds Chairman of the Board of AS 'Olainfarm' Mr. Valerijs Maligins. Antibacterial nitrofurane derivatives, namely Furamag, Furagin, Furadonin and Furasol will be produced in the modernized facility, and after the completion of development process they will be joined by the new nitrofurane product. New equipment will significantly improve the efficiency of production processes, making them highly technological, and at the same time reduce energy consumption. Small batch final dosage form production unit of AS 'Olainfarm' will produce smaller batches of finished products and will be used for technology scale-up. Small scale technologies will also allow optimisation of the use of more productive equipment. Final dosage form development laboratory has also been moved to the new building, where it will continue working on new forms of existing products and on development of brand new products. New final dosage production unit of AS 'Olainfarm' is the biggest financial investment in development of pharmaceutical production in the Baltics in 2014. Total costs of the project are 9.6 million euro, of which 2.5 million euro is funded by European Regional Development Fund. Of the total project costs 4.1 million euro were invested in construction works, 4.8 in production equipment and 0.6 in analytical equipment. New final dosage form production unit was constructed within the project 'High Added Value Investments into Production of Nitrofuranes', on which the contract No.L-APV-12-0039 was signed between AS 'Olainfarm' Latvian Investment and Development Agency on August 15, 2012.
