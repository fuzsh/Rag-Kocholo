In accordance with the agreement, Oribalt distributes and sells prescription medicines manufactured by MSD in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. The sales and marketing staff of MSD became Oribalt employees and were integrated into a separate unit, carrying out the promotion and sale of MSD products.\n\n2013\n\nIn November 2013, an online pharmacy InternetAptieka.lv was opened. It offered a wide assortment, fast and free delivery throughout Latvia at fair price.\n\n2014\n\nIn September 2014, SIA Oribalt Riga (at the time SIA Oriola Riga) established voluntary chain of independent pharmacies, called SirdsAptieka, aiming to unite independent Latvian pharmacies under one name.\n\n2017\n\nIn October 2017, after acquiring the Baltic subsidiaries of Oriola Oy, Oribalt Riga became a part of the SIA Oribalt Group.\n\nToday, the company focuses on the pharmaceutical wholesale, the provision of warehousing and logistics services and the sales of the brand department products in line with the company's strategy.\n\nOur Partners\n\nThere are more than 8,000 different products in the assortment of our pharmaceutical wholesale department: medicines, vaccines, medical and hygiene products, food supplements, medical devices, and cosmetics.\n\nWe are proud to have well-known international manufacturers as our cooperation partners, including Baxter, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Pasteur Merieux, Roche, Servier, Berlin Chemie, Beaufor Ipsen, LEK, Losbalt, Pfizer, KRKA, Sanofi Aventis, Astra Zeneca, Nycomed, Olainfarm, Grindeks, Merck Serono, Gedeon Richter, Zentiva, SHS, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Nutricia, Meda Pharma, Remedica, Sirowa, Lanacher, and many others.\n\nWe provide warehousing and logistics services to such companies as Merck Serono, Novartis, and others.\n\nThe brand department of Oribalt Riga is an exclusive representative for many brands, the biggest of which are Lysi (the world’s leading manufacturer of fish oil products), Schar (Europe’s leading manufacturer of gluten-free food), Canderel (sweeteners from the US), Blistex (lip balms from the US), and Floradix (high quality food supplements from Germany)."
