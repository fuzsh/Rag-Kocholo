        "text": "JSC Olainfarm has completed the modernisation of the phenibut semi-product unit, where the semi-product is manufactured for the active pharmaceutical substance for medicines improving the function of the central nervous system. The unit underwent simplified renovations, and equipment has been purchased and installed to allow doubling the phenibut production volumes. Within the project, the production of new finished drug forms „Noofen 100” has been commenced. This has been implemented with the support of the European Regional Development Fund.\n\n„As we were approaching the 40-year anniversary of Olainfarm in 2012, we informed of our plans to invest about 50 million euro in production development within the upcoming decade. Modernisation of the phenibut intermediate unit is one of such high added value investment and development projects. Before then, we had already established a nitrofuran drug production unit, and we are currently working on the modernisation of a mebicar production unit, establishment of a production plant of anti-tuberculosis active pharmaceutical substance, modernisation and expansion of the packaging process and finished product warehouses,” adds the member of the Board of JSC Olainfarm Salvis Lapiņš.\n\nSales volumes of the original product of JSC Olainfarm — „Noofen” — with the active pharmaceutical substance phenibut, have doubled over the last five years. It is one of the top sellers of JSC Olainfarm products.\n\nThe phenibut intermediate unit covers an area of 965 sq. metres in the 4th and 6th production block of JSC Olainfarm. It is undergoing repairs, and production equipment is being purchased and installed, including quality control equipment and modern, high performance liquid chromatographs with mass detectors of new structure. They not only allow to control the admixture contents in the analysed sample, but also to identify the molecular structure of admixtures. Production at the new unit will be carried out in compliance with the requirements of Good manufacturing practice and ISO 14001 standards.\n\nThe total project costs are 1.9 million euro, of which 0.2 million euro is the requested funding from the European Regional Development Fund. Of the total project investments, 1 million was invested in reconstruction works, whereas 0.9 million, in production and quality control equipment.\n\nThe unit was modernised within the third phase project „Modernisation of the phenibut intermediate unit” within the activity 2.1.2.4 „High added value investments” of the extension to the programme „Entrepreneurship and innovation”, on which JSC Olainfarm concluded an Agreement No. L-APV-14-0069 on 25 March 2014 with the Latvian Investment and Development Agency.\n\nJSC Olainfarm is one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in Latvia with more than 40 years of experience in production of medication and chemical and pharmaceutical products. A basic principle of company’s operations is to produce reliable and effective top quality products for Latvia and the rest of the world. Products made by the Group are being exported to more than 35 countries of the world, including the Baltics, Russia, other CIS, Europe, Asia, North America and Australia.\n\nFurther information:"
