        "text": "April 2018, marks a small one year anniversary since I've been investing in the Baltic Stock market, more precisely - Baltic dividend stocks.\n\nI decided to invest in the Baltic stocks, once I found I'm too short to open Interactive Brokers account for buying US stocks (required opening minimum is $10,000). Buying Baltic stocks from local brokers (SEB bank) is relatively cheap (about 3 EUR commission per trade).\n\nBack in April 2017 I started to acquire first stocks in the Baltics, now a year later I've built a humble (~EUR 7,800 worth) Baltic stock portfolio. In general I could sell of all of my holdings there and put this money to open Interactive Brokers, but that's not the plan (At least not yet)\n\nSince April 2017, I have bought 18 dividend paying stocks in the Baltics, in March 2018, after it was announced that one company is planning to leave Nasdaq Baltics I sold it, got some humble profit). And now I actually hold just 17 dividend paying stocks.\n\nFor tracking my holdings in Baltic Stocks I've built a simple Google Spreasheet\n\nIn total,in dividends I've received EUR 343,7 giving a dividend yield on cost 4.37%, while the total value for portfolio is with a negative -0.83%,the total gain after one year equals to 3.55%.\n\nTaking into consideration, that I've been using the so called dollar cost averaging to acquire stocks once in a month, results seems actually pretty OK.\n\nMost of the Baltic dividend stocks pays out yearly, which I don't like much, luckily there are a couple of companies paying more often (there is one paying quarterly, and there are two companies paying semiannually). A nice boost for dividends is the so called special (unexpected) dividends, happening pretty regualary on the Nasdaq Baltics.\n\nHere is the list with top gainers/losers from my portfolio\n\nTop Gainers\n\nSAF Tehnika (54.40%)\n\nZemaitijos Pienas (20.44%)\n\nLatvijas GƒÅze (18.96%)\n\nTop Losers\n\nOlainFarm (-15.69%)\n\nKauno Energija (-13.71%)\n\nVilniaus Baldai (-13.02)\n\nOlainFarm and Vilniaus Baldai seems my worst investments yet"
