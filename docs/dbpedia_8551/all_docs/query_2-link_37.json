        "text": "Just a little story before we begin.....\n\nThree hundred years ago, early in the morning of the 13th May 1717, the Imperial household nervously waited outside the chamber of the Empress Elisabeth Christine who was about to give birth to her second child.\n\nPeople were passing by the Imperial Palace (Hofburg) busily nattering and speculating the gender of the soon-to-be newborn Imperial child.\n\nEveryone was hoping for a boy, an Archduke and heir. People will soon be flocking into the city, celebrating, rejoicing, singing and dancing in the streets of old Vienna to welcome the newborn child.\n\nSoon the chamber doors were opened allowing the wet nurses to enter the room and the ladies in waiting to rush in to pay tribute to the new baby - a girl.\n\nThe military commanders standing outside of the palace were notified and then ordered the cannons of the walled city to be fired to honour the tremendous event.\n\nThe mighty 'Pummerin', the largest bell of St. Stephen's Cathedral (Stephansdom) started to ring majestically and was soon joined with the sound of St. Peters (Peterskirche) and the bells of the numerous churches of the city which resonated throughout the city.\n\nThe city wakened to the sound of thousands of chiming bells which wordlessly announced the news as everyone started to join the never-ending flow of people rushing through the city streets to gather together on the main square in front of St. Stephen's Cathedral (Stephansplatz) to hear the news.\n\nThe little Archduchess was the second child of Karl VI and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Their first child, Archduke Leopold Johann was born on the 13th April, 1716 and died on the 4th November, 1716.\n\nThe still mourning Imperial family was now rejoicing the birth of a new member of the Habsburg dynasty.\n\nThe Rittersaal (Hall of Knights) of the Imperial Palace was used as a chapel for the christening of the baby Archduchess.\n\nDrummers and trumpeters lined the aisles of the Rittersaal and the sound of fanfares filled the candlelit magnificent hall.\n\nThe little Archduchess was baptised - Maria Theresa Walburga Amalia Christina - and after the christening she was returned back to her mother in the Imperial Apartments.\n\nA new era was about to begin, a golden era of which the young Archduchess would become the undisputed monarch, a sovereign, a mother - she carried the titles of the Habsburg-crown lands and was Archduchess of Austria.\n\nForeword\n\nIn celebration of the Tricentennial of Archduchess Maria Theresia 1717-2017.\n\nMany powerful women have helped to shape European history.\n\nWomen such as Eleanor of Aquitaine, Isabella I of Castile, Elizabeth I of England, Catherine the Great of Russia, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, all had power and were prepared to use it .\n\nMaria Theresia of Austria also fully deserves a place on this list.\n\nAs Maria grew she developed into a good-looking, brave, determined young girl who quickly became a politically astute woman.\n\nThe young Archduchess preferred to speak German in a Viennese dialect, and when she became Empress she was not familiar with the affairs of state so sought advice and reassurance from her ministers and husband. However, she soon realised that to succeed she had to rely on her own judgment and strength of character and later recalled that when she ascended to the throne, \"I found myself without money, without credit, without an army, without experience and knowledge of my own, and finally without any counsel because each one of my ministers wanted to wait and see how things would develop.\"\n\nHer forty-year reign covered one of the most crucial periods of European history in the 18th century. She was forced to defend her claim to the Habsburg Hereditary Lands and this action thrust her into the maelstrom of European politics.\n\nShe not only ruled over the Habsburg controlled-lands of Central Europe, but also fought two major wars, which made her a force to be reckoned with, and still found time to give birth to sixteen children.\n\nShe was responsible for all the decisions made within the Habsburg provinces and, together with her excellent advisors, led her dominions into a never-to-be-forgotten era in which many reforms took place. These reforms included raising the standard of education, centralisation of the administration, the reformation of the judiciary and stabilising the financial situation.\n\nHowever, in order to fully appreciate this great woman a short account of the history of the Habsburgs prior to her reign will help to understand the factors that led to her ascending the throne and fighting two major wars.\n\nKing Carlos II of Spain\n\nCarlos was born on the 6th November 1661, and died on the 1st November 1700. He was the only surviving son of Philip IV of Spain and Mariana of Austria.\n\nHis father, Philip IV, died on the 17th September 1665 at the age of 60.Carlos was only three- years-old when he became king, so the Council of Castile (Regency Council) appointed his mother, Mariana of Austria, to rule in the name of the young king. As the years passed by it became obvious that the young mentally retarded and physically disabled King was not capable of ruling in his own right and his mother continued to serve as regent for most of his reign.\n\nThe unfortunate young, disabled king was in a poor state of health and sadly degenerated. He had a large head and Habsburg jaw and his legs could not support him so he was unable to walk properly.His education was inadequate and he was very dependent upon his mother.Carlos married Marie Louise d'Orléans, the niece of Louis XIV of France in 1679.The 'proxy' marriage ceremony took place at the Palace of Fontainebleau on the 30th August 1679, and on the 19th November 1679 Marie Louise married Carlos in person in Quintanapalla, Spain.Marie Louise, a very pretty young lady of seventeen years, became a political pawn as her marriage to Carlos was intended to encourage better relations between France and Spain.Her marriage in 1679 was the beginning of a very isolated life at the Spanish court which she hated.Carlos was madly in love with her, but the young Queen was severely depressed and dismayed because after many unsuccessful attempts to bear a child she eventually lost hope of becoming pregnant.Carlos is assumed to have been infertile if not actually impotent.His physical health and mental deficiency earned him the nickname \"El Hechizado\" (The Bewitched or Hexed).\n\nThe life at Spanish Court with its very strict and confining etiquette became a cause for distress, which only deepened her depression. Marie Louise had been much happier as a child in France and became homesick. She had arrived in Spain as a young and beautiful princess, but she became increasingly overweight and could find no happiness or peace of mind. The King was in love with his wife but could do little to help her.\n\nOn the 11th February 1689 she fell ill with extreme stomach pains and died the next night. There were rumours that Marie Louise had been poisoned, but it seems most probable that the cause of her death was appendicitis.\n\nCarlos was heartbroken after the death of his young wife, but he needed an heir and had to remarry immediately.\n\nMaria Anna of Neuberg, a Wittelsbach, was chosen to become his second wife.\n\nThe 'proxy' marriage took place on the 28th August 1689 in Ingolstadt, Germany, but Maria Anna did not arrive in Spain until the spring of 1690 when she married Carlos in person on the 14th May 1690 in San Diego.\n\nTheir marriage also remained childless.\n\nMaria Anna easily dominated her husband and was actively involved in several intrigues in the Spanish Court, and she too despised Spain and her life at the Spanish court as Marie Louise had done.\n\nIn 1698, Carlos became gravely ill. The young King was still in his thirties but his health was rapidly getting worse and on the 1st November 1700 he died.\n\nCarlos was the last Habsburg King of Spain and ruler of an Empire upon which the sun never set.\n\nAustria during the War of the Spanish Succession\n\nIn 1705, during the War of the Spanish Succession, Emperor Leopold I died and his eldest son Joseph I became Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nJoseph was an ambitious, keen, and forward-looking ruler, and he had advisers who were willing to back his reforms.He tried to make the bureaucracy more efficient and he achieved a certain amount of success in stabilising the financial situation of the Habsburgs during his short reign.\n\nIn 1702, during the War of the Spanish Succession, he took an active part in the siege of Landau and continued the war against Louis XIV of France in an attempt to assist his brother Karl to become King of Spain.Between 1703 and 1709, an uprising against the Habsburgs orchestrated by Ferenc II Rákóczi led to devastating attacks on parts of Lower Austria, Burgenland and Styria, and became a threat to Vienna.\n\nEmperor Joseph was forced to take military action and finally he agreed to a compromise that eventually led to the integration of Hungary into the Habsburg domains.\n\nUnfortunately, Joseph died on the 17th April 1711 in the Hofburg Palace during an outbreak of smallpox that struck the city.\n\nAfter Joseph's death his brother Karl returned to Austria and claimed his right to the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nAfter eight years of marriage Karl and Elisabeth Christine became parents.\n\nOn the 13th April 1716, the long awaited heir to the throne was born, but their first child Archduke Leopold Johann died only six months later on the 4th November 1716.\n\nFor a short time it had seemed as though the Pragmatic Sanction would not be needed, but the death of their first child made Karl even more determined in his efforts regarding a regulation of the Habsburg succession.\n\nThe Treaty was confirmed by the diets (Landtage) of the Hereditary Lands in the years 1720-1723.\n\nThe Hungarian Parliament voted for its own Pragmatic Sanction in 1723, and the Kingdom of Hungary accepted and supported Maria Theresia's hereditary right to become \"King\" of Hungary by simply ignoring the fact that she was a woman.\n\nDuring the 1720s, most of the major foreign powers accepted the Pragmatic Sanction but reneged on their promises after the sudden death of the Emperor in 1740.\n\nThe price Austria had to pay to the other European powers for their approval of the Treaty was high and led to the abandonment of many centralising reforms. What Austria failed to realise at the time that these concessions were made was they would not prevent the War of the Austrian Succession from breaking out when Karl died."
