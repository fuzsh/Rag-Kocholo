She was the youngest daughter of Felipe I, Duke of Parma and his wife, Princess Louise-Élisabeth of France, the eldest daughter of King Louis XV.\n\nHer parents had been the Duke and Duchess of Parma since 1749, when the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) awarded the duchy to the Bourbon. She, her brother Ferdinando, and her sister Isabella were educated in Parma by Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, a well-known French philosopher.\n\nIn 1762 Maria Luisa was engaged to Carlos, Prince of Asturias, later King Carlos IV of Spain, whom she married on 4 September 1765 in La Granja Palace. The couple would have fourteen children, six of whom survived into adulthood.\n\nAs there was no queen in Spain at that time, María Luisa became the first lady in precedence at the court from the beginning of her residence there. Her husband was the son and heir of the widowed Carlos III of Spain, previously Duke of Parma and King of Naples and Sicily.\n\nDue to pressure from Napoleon I, María's husband abdicated the throne of Spain and spent the rest of his life in exile. When Napoleon's army invaded the country, several pamphlets blamed her for the abdication. María Luisa spent some years in France and then in Rome where she died on 2 January 1819, aged 67.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nparent->child relationship with Carlos of Spain, Count of Molina (born 29 March 1788)\n\nparent->child relationship with Carlota Joaquina of Spain (born 25 April 1775)\n\nparent->child relationship with Felipe María, Infante of Spain (born 28 March 1792)\n\nparent->child relationship with Felipe, Infante of Spain (1783) (born 5 September 1783)\n\nparent->child relationship with Fernando VII, King of Spain (born 14 October 1784)\n\nparent->child relationship with Francisco de Paula, Infante of Spain (born 10 March 1794)\n\nparent->child relationship with María Amalia, Infanta of Spain (born 9 January 1779)\n\nparent->child relationship with María Isabella, Queen of the Two Sicilies (born 6 July 1789)\n\nchild->parent relationship with Felipe I, Duke of Parma (born 15 March 1720)\n\nchild->parent relationship with Louise Élisabeth, Duchess of Parma (born 14 August 1727)\n\nspouse relationship with Carlos IV, King of Spain (born 11 November 1748).
