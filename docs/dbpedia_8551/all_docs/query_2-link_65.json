        "text": "Charles VII (August 6, 1697 – January 20, 1745) was Prince-Elector Charles Albert of Bavaria from February 26, 1726 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII from January 24, 1742 to his death. He was also King of Bohemia (as Charles III) from 1741 to 1743. Charles Albert was a member of the House of Wittelsbach, and his reign as Holy Roman Emperor thus marked the end of three centuries of uninterrupted Habsburg imperial rule, although he was related to the Habsburgs by both blood and marriage.\n\nCharles Albert was the eldest son of Prince-Elector Maximilian II Emanuel of Bavaria, and the Polish princess Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska. He became Prince-Elector following the death of his father in 1722.\n\nEmperor After Charles VI died in 1740, Prince-Elector Charles Albert claimed the Archduchy of Austria and briefly gained hold of the Bohemian throne. In 1742, he was elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He ruled until his death three years later.\n\nOn 5 October 1722, Charles married Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, whom he had met at the imperial court in Vienna. She was the youngest daughter of the late Emperor Joseph I and his wife, Princess Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Bavaria had renounced all claims to the throne via the marriage, but it provided the legal basis to the inheritance of certain Austrian possessions.\n\nDuring the reign of Archduchess Maria Amalia’s grandfather Emperor Leopold I, his two sons, the future Emperor Joseph I and Emperor Charles VI signed the Mutual Pact of Succession, which gave Emperor Joseph’s daughters precedence in the order of succession over Charles’ daughters (if neither had sons).\n\nEmperor Charles VI replaced this with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. This put Archduchess Maria Amalia and her elder sister Archduchess Maria Josepha behind his own future daughters, the first of whom, Archduchess Maria Theresa, would be born in 1717. The displaced Archduchess were not allowed to marry until they renounced their rights to the throne.\n\nIn continuation of the policy of his father, Prince-Elector Charles Albert aspired to an even higher rank. As son-in-law of Emperor Joseph I, Prince-Elector Charles Albert rejected the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and claimed the German territories of the Habsburg dynasty against Archduchess Maria Theresa, daughter of Emperor Charles VI, in 1740. By the Treaty of Nymphenburg, which was concluded in July 1741, Prince-Elector Charles Albert became allied with France and Spain against Austria.\n\nDuring the War of the Austrian Succession, Prince-Elector Charles Albert invaded Upper Austria in 1741 and planned to conquer Vienna, but his allied French troops under the Duc de Belle-Isle were instead redirected to Bohemia, and Prague was conquered in November 1741.\n\nThat meant that Prince-Elector Charles Albert was crowned King of Bohemia in Prague on December 19, 1741, when the Habsburgs had not yet been defeated. He was unanimously elected king of Germany on January 24, 1742 and became Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII upon his coronation on February 12, 1742.\n\nHis brother Prince Clement August of Bavaria the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, generally sided with the Habsburg-Lorraine faction in the disputes over the Habsburg succession but cast his vote for him and personally crowned him emperor at Frankfurt.\n\nKing George II of Great Britain, as the Prince-Elector of Hanover, also voted to install Charles Albert as Emperor even though both Britain and Hanover were allied with Austria in the ongoing war. Emperor Charles VII was the second Wittelsbach emperor after Emperor Ludwig IV and the first Wittelsbach King of Germany since the reign of King Ruprecht.\n\nMaximilian III Joseph, (March 28, 1727 – December 30, 1777), was a Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire and Duke of Bavaria from 1745 to 1777. He was the last of the Bavarian Branch of the House of Wittelsbach and because of his death, the War of Bavarian Succession broke out.\n\nBorn in Munich, Prince Maximilian Joseph was the eldest son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII Albrecht and his wife, Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I Princess Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nArchduchess Maria Amalia of Austria’s older sister was Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria was the eldest child of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I and Princess Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg. She was named for her father. During the reign of her grandfather, Emperor Leopold I, Archduchess Maria Josepha’s father and uncle Archduke Charles of Austria, signed the Mutual Pact of Succession of 1703, which was issued by Emperor Leopold I, and effectively made Archduchess Maria Josepha the heir presumptive to the Hereditary Habsburg Lands.\n\nHowever, Emperor Charles VI’s Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 annulled the earlier Mutual Pact of Succession of 1703 and made his daughter Archduchess Maria Theresa his successor instead of Archduchess Maria Josepha.\n\nArchduchess Maria Theresa succeeded her father, Emperor Charles VI, 1740 and was ruler of the Habsburg Hereditary until her death in 1780, and she was the only woman to hold the position suo jure (in her own right). Archduchess Maria Theresa was the sovereign of Archduchess Austria, Queen of Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia. By her marriage to Duke Franz Stephen of Lorraine, she was Duchess of Lorraine, Grand Duchess of Tuscany.\n\nHowever, the Holy Roman Empire was governed by the Salic Law which barred women from the Imperial throne. That crown was not settled and the battle for that crown was part of the War of the Austrian Succession.\n\nDuring the War of the Austrian Succession, Prince-Elector Charles Albrecht of Bavaria (father of Maximilian Joseph) invaded Upper Austria in 1741 and planned to conquer Vienna, but his allied French troops under the Duc de Belle-Isle were instead redirected to Bohemia, and Prague was conquered in November 1741.\n\nThat meant that Prince-Elector Charles Albrecht was crowned King of Bohemia in Prague on December 19, 1741, (usurping Archduchess Maria Theresa) when the Habsburgs had not yet been defeated. Prince-Elector Charles Albrecht was unanimously elected King of Germany on January 24, 1742 and became Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII Albrecht upon his coronation on February 12, 1742.\n\nHis brother Prince Clement August of Bavaria, the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, generally sided with the Habsburg-Lorraine faction in the disputes over the Habsburg succession but instead cast his vote for his brother and personally crowned him Emperor at Frankfurt.\n\nEmperor Charles VII Albrecht’s reign was brief. Emperor Charles VII Albrecht was suffering severely from gout and died at Nymphenburg Palace on January 20, 1745. His brother Prince Clement August of Bavaria then leaned towards Austria, and Prince Maximilian Joseph became Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria but could not secure his election as Emperor.\n\nPrince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph inherited a country in the process of being invaded by Austrian armies as part of the War of the Austrian Succession.\n\nThe 18-year-old Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph wavered between the Peace-party, led by his mother Empress Maria Amalia and Army Commander Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff and the War-party, led by Foreign Minister General Ignaz Count of Törring and the French envoy Chavigny.\n\nAfter the decisive defeat in the Battle of Pfaffenhofen on April 15, 1745, Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph quickly abandoned his imperial pretenses and made peace with Empress Maria Theresa in the Treaty of Füssen, in which he agreed to support her husband, Grand Duke Franz Stephen of Tuscany, in the upcoming imperial election.\n\nArchduchess Maria Theresa secured her husband’s election as Emperor, which took place on September 13, 1745. Emperor Franz succeeded Charles VII Albrecht, and she made him co-regent of her hereditary dominions. As Consort to her husband, Emperor Franz, Maria Theresa was Empress Maria Theresa the title and name she is most known by.\n\nIn 1747, Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph married his first cousin, Princess Maria Anna Sophia of Saxony, but the marriage remained childless.\n\nMaria Anna Sophia of Saxony was a daughter of King Augustus III of Poland (also Prince-Elector Friedrich August II of Saxony) and his wife Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria who became Princess Electress of Bavaria by marriage to Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria.\n\nArchduchess Maria Josepha of Austria, as we have seen above, was the eldest child of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I and Princess Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nDuring the Seven Years’ War Bavarian forces then fought on the Habsburg side. Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph’s sister Princess Maria Josepha of Bavaria was married in 1765 to Empress Maria Theresa’s son Holy Emperor Joseph II. But long-term weakening of Prussia was not in the Bavarian interest, as that country offered the only counterweight to the Habsburg monarchy.\n\nPrince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph tried, as far as possible, to keep Bavaria out of the wars. Apart from militia troops, he sent only a small force of 4,000 men to join the Austrian army. In 1758/1759 (only a year and half into the war), he withdrew Bavarian auxiliary troops from Austrian service. Together with the Wittelsbach Prince-Elector Elector Charles Theodore of the Palatinate of the Rhine he enforced the neutrality of the Empire during the conflict.\n\nPrince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph was a progressive and enlightened ruler who did much to improve the development of his country. He encouraged agriculture, industry, and exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country, and abolished the Jesuit censorship of the press. In 1747 the Nymphenburg Porcelain Factory was established, while the Codex Maximilianeus bavaricus civilis was written in 1756. In 1759, he founded Munich’s first academic institution, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.\n\nDuring the severe famine in 1770 Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph sold some of the crown jewels to pay for grain imports to relieve hunger. In that year, he also issued an edict against the extravagant pomposity of the Church which contributed to the end of the era of Bavarian rococo. He also forbade the Oberammergau Passion Play. In 1771 the elector regulated general school attendance.\n\nIn December 1777 Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph rode in his carriage through Munich; on the ride, as he passed one of the tower clocks, the mechanism broke, and the clock struck 77 times. Commenting to the passengers, Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph decided this was an omen, and that his years had run out.\n\nWithin days, he was stricken with a strange disease. None of his 15 doctors could diagnose it, but by Christmas, it had become clear that it was a particularly virulent strain of smallpox, called “purple small pox” at the time.\n\nBy the last day of the month he was dead without leaving an heir. Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph is buried in the crypt of the Theatinerkirche in Munich.\n\nHis death sparked the War of the Bavarian Succession.\n\nThe War of the Austrian Succession was a European conflict fought between 1740 and 1748, primarily in Central Europe.\n\nIts pretext was the right of Archduchess Maria Theresa to succeed her father, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, as ruler of the Habsburg Monarchy.\n\nThe Habsburg Monarchy, was a collection of states, or a personal union of crowns, ruled by the House of Habsburg with only partial shared laws and institutions other than the Habsburg court itself. Following the partition of the Dynasty into the Spanish and Austrian branches the Habsburg Monarch was generally ruled by its Austrian branch.\n\nThe states of the Habsburg Monarchy, also known as the Habsburg Hereditary Lands or the Habsburg Empire, included the Archduchy of Austria, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Kingdom of Croatia, the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Austrian Netherlands.\n\nThe history of the Habsburg Monarchy can be traced back to the election of Count Rudolph V of Habsburg, as Rudolph I, King of the Romans/King of Germany in 1273 and his acquisition of the Duchy of Austria for the Habsburgs in 1282. Rudolph of Germany was the son of Count Albrecht IV of Habsburg and Hedwig of Kyburg.\n\nIn 1482, Emperor Maximilian I acquired the Netherlands through marriage. Both realms passed to his grandson and successor, Emperor Charles V, who also inherited the Spanish throne, as King Carlos I of Spain, as well as its colonial possessions, and thus came to rule the Habsburg Empire at its greatest territorial extent.\n\nThe abdication of Emperor Charles V in 1556 led to a division within the Dynasty between his son King Felipe II of Spain and his brother Archduke Ferdinand of Austria Iwho had served as his lieutenant and the elected king of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia.\n\nKing Felipe II of Spain represented the Spanish branch of the Dynasty (which held all of Iberia, the Netherlands, and lands in Italy) and became extinct in 1700. Archduke Ferdinand of Austria (later Emperor) represented the Austrian branch of the Dynasty (which ruled the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary, Bohemia and various other lands) and was itself split into different branches in 1564 but reunited 101 years later.\n\nIn historiography, the terms “Austria” or “Austrians” are frequently used as shorthand for the Habsburg monarchy since the 18th century. From 1438 to 1806, the rulers of the House of Habsburg almost continuously reigned as Holy Roman Emperors.\n\nHowever, the realms of the Holy Roman Empire were mostly self-governing and are thus not considered to have been part of the Habsburg monarchy. Hence, the Habsburg monarchy (of the Austrian branch) is often called “Austria” by metonymy.\n\nThe immediate cause of the War of the Austrian Succession was the death in 1740 of Emperor Charles VI (1685–1740) and the inheritance of the Habsburg Monarchy. The 1703 Mutual Pact of Succession provided that if the Habsburgs became extinct in the male line, these possessions would go first to Archduchess Maria Josepha and Archduchess Maria Amalia, daughters of Emperor Joseph I, then the daughters of Archduke Charles of Austria, his younger brother.\n\nSince Salic law excluded women from the inheritance, this agreement required approval by the various Habsburg territories and the Imperial Diet.\n\nArchduke Charles succeeded Emperor Joseph in 1711, becoming Emperor Charles VI and two years later he issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, which confirmed the principle of female inheritance and was to insure to ensure that the Habsburg Monarchy would be inherited by a daughter undivided.\n\nHowever, it also modified the 1703 agreement by placing the rights of his own children first and after his first child Archduchess Maria Theresa was born in 1717, Charles’ internal and external policy was dominated by ensuring her succession ahead of his two nieces.\n\nPrior to their respective marriages to Prince-Elector Friedrich August II of Saxony (King Augustus III of Poland) and Prince-Elector Charles Albrecht of Bavaria in 1719, both nieces, Archduchess Maria Josepha and Archduchess Maria Amalia, were obliged to formally renounce their rights to the inheritance.\n\nPrince-Elector Charles Albrecht of Bavaria was Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII from January 24, 1742 to his death. He was also King of Bohemia (as Charles III) from 1741 to 1743.\n\nCharles Albrecht was a member of the House of Wittelsbach, and his reign as Holy Roman Emperor thus marked the end of three centuries of uninterrupted Habsburg imperial rule, although he was related to the Habsburgs by both blood and marriage.\n\nEmperor Charles VI assumed the rivalry between Saxony and Bavaria would secure his daughter’s throne, since neither would be prepared to allow the other to inherit, but instead he gave his two greatest rivals a legitimate claim to the Habsburg lands.\n\nEmperor Charles VI was also seeking to ensure the succession of Archduchess Maria Theresa not just to the Habsburg Monarchy but the titles and powers of the Holy Roman Emperor. Technically the Holy Roman Empire was governed by the Salic Law which barred women from the Imperial Throne in their own right.\n\nAlthough held by a Habsburg for over 300 years, the Holy Roman Empire was theoretically an elective position which had never been held by a woman, and this element turned an internal Dynastic dispute into a European one.\n\nThe problem was exacerbated by tensions within the Holy Roman Empire, caused by dramatic increases in the size and power of Bavaria, Prussia, and Saxony, mirrored by the post-1683 expansion of Habsburg power into lands previously held by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe war began on October 20, 1740 with the death of Emperor Charles VI. King Friedrich II of Prussia succeeded his father King Friedrich Wilhelm I in Prussia on May 31, 1740 at the age of 28.\n\nAlthough Prussia had increased in importance over the prior few decades, its disparate and scattered territories prevented it wielding significant power, a reality Friedrich intended to change. The death of Emperor Charles VI provided him with an ideal opportunity to acquire region of Silesia.\n\nPrince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier (July 31, 1824 – February 4, 1890), was a member of the French royal family from the House of Orléans.\n\nHRH Prince Antoine Marie Philippe Louis d’Orléans was the youngest son of King Louis Philippe of France and his wife Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, the tenth of eighteen children of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.\n\nPrince Antoine’s grandmother, Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria, the thirteenth child of Holy Roman Emperor Franz I, former Duke of Lorraine and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia in her own right.\n\nPrince Antoine was styled as HRH The Duke of Montpensier. He was born on July 31, 1824 at the château de Neuilly and died February 4, 1890 at Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain.\n\nOn October 10, 1846 at Madrid, Spain, he married Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain, the daughter of King Fernando VII of Spain and his wife Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, the daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies by his second wife, Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nPrince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier and Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain had ten children (one stillborn in 1857):\n\n1. Maria Isabel (1848–1919), who married her first cousin Philippe, comte de Paris (1838–94), the French claimant, and became known as Marie Isabelle, comtesse de Paris. She had several children.\n\n2. Maria Amelia (1851–1870)\n\n3. Maria Cristina (1852–1879)\n\n4. Maria de la Regla (1856–1861)\n\n5. Fernando (1859–1873)\n\n6. Mercedes (1860–1878), otherwise Princess Marie des Graces d’Orleans-Montpensier, who married her first cousin Alfonso XII and is historically known as Mercedes of Orleans, Queen of Spain. No children.\n\n7. Felipe Raimundo Maria (1862–1864)\n\n8. Antonio (1866–1930), became Duke of Galliera in Italy. He married his first cousin Infanta Eulalia of Spain (1864–1958), daughter of Queen Isabella II, and had two sons.\n\n9. Luis Maria Felipe Antonio (1867–1874)\n\nCandidate for the Spanish throne\n\nPrince Antoine de Montpensier lived in Spain from 1848 when he and his family had to leave France after the Revolution of 1848. During the Spanish revolution of 1868, he supported the insurgents under Juan Prim against Queen Isabel II, his own sister-in-law.\n\nIn 1870 he fought a duel against Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, the brother of King Francisco of Spain, and killed him.\n\nInfante Enrique, Duke of Seville was the grandson of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife, Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies (1804–1844), who was the daughter of Francis I of the Two Sicilies and Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain.\n\nInfante Enrique of Spain became the first Duke of Seville in 1823. He was known for his progressive, even revolutionary, ideas during the reign of his double first cousin and sister-in-law, Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nBetween 1869 and 1870, Enrique published several pamphlets and articles hostile to his cousin, Antoine, Duke of Montpensier for the duke’s alleged aspirations on the Spanish throne. Enrique challenged Montpensier to a duel, which took place near La Fortuna in Leganés, Madrid, on March 12, 1870. Enrique was shot and killed, removing him as a public critic of the Duke of Montpensier.\n\nPrince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier was convicted and sentenced to one month in prison.\n\nEnrique’s eldest son, Enrique de Borbón y Castellví, 2nd Duke of Seville, refused to accept the 30,000 pesetas that the Duke of Montpensier offered as compensation.\n\nEnrique, who was no longer an Infante of Spain, could not be buried in El Escorial, but was buried in the Saint Isidore Cemetery, in Madrid.\n\nAfter the marriage of Queen Isabella II of Spain and his brother, Infante Francisco de Asís, Infante Enrique went into a self imposed exile into Belgium. While in France, Infante Enrique several times proclaimed himself a revolutionary, and was asked to join the International Workingmen’s Association.\n\nOn May 13, 1848 he was stripped of his Royal Rank and titles (his children, being born of a morganatic marriage to, Elena María de Castellví y Shelly, were untitled). In 1849 he asked the Queen’s forgiveness in order to return from exile. Enrique’s ducal title was restored, but not the title and style of HRH Infante of Spain.\n\nOn November 16, 1870 the Cortes voted for the next king and chose Prince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta, with 191 votes.\n\nPrince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta was the third child and second son of King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, who would later become the first King of a unified Italy, and of Archduchess Adelaide of Austria, daughter of Archduke Rainer of Austria and his wife Princess Elisabeth of Savoy. Prince Amadeo was granted the hereditary title of Duke of Aosta from birth.\n\nPrince Antoine only received 27 votes, and left Spain, only to return in 1874. His ambitions were fulfilled by his daughter Princess Mercedes of Orléans, who became Queen of Spain after her marriage to King Alfonso XII, son of Queen Isabella II. However, she died at the age of 18 without issue.\n\nDespite never reaching the throne, however, through cognates, he is an ancestor of all Spanish monarchs since Juan Carlos I. His great granddaughter Mercedes, Countess of Barcelona, was the mother of King Juan Carlos of Spain who assumed the throne in 1975 and later abdicated in favor of his son, King Felipe VI of Spain in 2014.\n\nEarly collector of photography\n\nThe Duke of Montpensier was an early collector of photography. His collection consisted of dozens of albums and hundreds of early photographs, mainly of Spanish, French and British photographers. The collection was dispersed after his death.\n\nFranz I (French: François Étienne; German: Franz Stefan; December 8, 1708 – August 18, 1765) was Holy Roman Emperor (1745–1765), Archduke of Austria (1740–1765), Duke of Lorraine and Bar (1729–1737), and Grand Duke of Tuscany (1737–1765).\n\nFranz Stefan was elected Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire because his wife, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, (daughter of Emperor Charles VI) was unable to be elected Empress in her own right due to the Empire went by the Salic Law which bared women from holding the Imperial title in her own right.\n\nEmperor Franz was the last non-Habsburg monarch of both the Empire and Austria, which were effectively governed by Maria Theresa. The couple were the founders of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, and their marriage produced sixteen children, among them was Archduchess Marie Antoinette the wife of King Louis XVI or France and Navarre.\n\nFranz Stefan was the fourth (but oldest surviving) son of Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, and the French princess Élisabeth Charlotte d’Orléans.\n\nPaternal Ancestry\n\nFranz Stefan’s father Leopold was the son of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine, and his wife Archduchess Eleonora Maria of Austria, a half-sister of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor Franz Stefan’s Paternal grandmother, Archduchess Eleonora Maria of Austria, was the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III and his wife, Eleanora of Mantua.\n\nArchduchess Eleanor Maria Anna of Austria was a Habsburg. However, she also had strong Habsburg ancestry through her descent from her great-grandfather, Albrecht V, Duke of Bavaria who’s own mother, Archduchess Anna of Austria, who was the third of fifteen children of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I (1503–1564) from his marriage with the Jagiellonian princess Anna of Bohemia and Hungary (1503–1547).\n\nArchduchess Anna of Austria’s siblings included: Elizabeth, Queen of Poland, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, Catherine, Queen of Poland, Eleanor, Duchess of Mantua, Barbara, Duchess of Ferrara, Charles II, Archduke of Austria and Johanna, Duchess of Tuscany.\n\nMaternal Ancestry\n\nFranz Stefan’s mother, Élisabeth Charlotte d’Orléans, was the daughter of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, (brother of King Louis XIV of France and Navarre) and of his second wife Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatine.\n\nFranz Stefan’s maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatine, was the daughter of Charles I Ludwig, Elector Palatine and his wife Charlotte of Hesse-Cassel. Elizabeth Charlotte was named after her paternal grandmother Elizabeth Stuart and her own mother.\n\nCharles Ludwig of the Palatinate was the second son of Friedrich V of the Palatinate, the “Winter King” of Bohemia, and of Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of King James I-VI of England and Scotland and sister of Charles I of England of England and Scotland. This demonstrates how the House of Habsburg-Lorraine descends from the Kings and Queens of England and Scotland.\n\nThe Paternal and Maternal Ancestry of Emperor Franz I demonstrates a very strong Habsburg ancestry and connection. Though the House of Habsburg ceased in the male line with the death of Emperor Charles VI, his descendants through his daughter Archduchess Maria Theresa and her husband Franz Stefan of Lorraine have continued the Habsburg dynasty.\n\nAlthough the dynasty is officially named Habsburg-Lorraine we can see that the House of Habsburg still exists because of Franz Stefan’s many paths of descent from the House of Habsburg\n\nDuke Leopold died in 1729, and was succeeded by his son, under the French spelling of François Étienne, and became the Duke of Lorraine and Bar.\n\nEmperor Charles VI favoured the family, who, besides being his cousins, had served the house of Austria with distinction. He had designed to marry his daughter Maria Theresa to Franz’s older brother Leopold Clement. On Leopold Clement’s death, Charles adopted the younger brother as his future son-in-law.\n\nPrior to accepting Franz Stefan as the husband for his daughter, the Emperor considered other possibilities. Religious differences prevented him from arranging his daughter’s marriage to the Protestant prince Friedrich of Prussia the future King Friedrich II the Great of Prussia, his wife’s future rival. In 1725, he betrothed her to Infante Carlos of Spain (Carlos III of Spain) and her sister, Maria Anna, to Infante Felipe of Spain (The reigning Duke of Parma).\n\nOther European powers compelled him to renounce the pact he had made with the Queen of Spain, Elisabeth Farnese. Maria Theresa, who had become close to Franz Stefan, was relieved.\n\nOn January 31, 1736 Franz agreed to marry Maria Theresa. He hesitated three times (and laid down the feather before signing). Especially his mother Élisabeth Charlotte d’Orléans and his brother Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine were against the loss of Lorraine.\n\nOn February 12, 1736 Franz married Maria Theresa. In 1738, he left the Duchy of Lorraine and Bar for the deposed Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński in exchange for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, as one of the terms ending the War of the Polish Succession.\n\nFollowing the death of his father-in-law Charles VI in 1740, Franz was elected Emperor and his wife became the ruler of the hereditary Habsburg domains. Maria Theresa gave her husband responsibility for the empire’s financial affairs, which he handled well.\n\nThough she was expected to cede power to her husband, Emperor Franz I, and later her eldest son, Emperor Joseph II, who were officially her co-rulers in Austria and Bohemia, Maria Theresa was the absolute sovereign who ruled with the counsel of her advisers.\n\nFranz was a serial adulterer; many of his affairs well-known and indiscreet, notably one with Princess Maria Wilhelmina of Auersperg, who was thirty years his junior. This particular affair was remarked upon in the letters and journals of visitors to the court and in those of his children.\n\nFranz died suddenly at the age of 56 in his carriage while returning from the opera at Innsbruck on August 18, 1765. He is buried in tomb number 55 in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.\n\nFranz was succeeded as Emperor by his eldest son, Joseph II, and as Grand Duke of Tuscany by his younger son, Peter Leopold (later Emperor Leopold II). Maria Theresa retained the government of her dominions until her own death in 1780.\n\nThe new Emperor was made co-regent (Co-Ruler) by his mother in the hereditary Austrian dominions. As emperor, he had little true power, and his mother had resolved that neither her husband nor her son should ever deprive her of sovereign control in her hereditary dominions.\n\nWith the death of Maria Theresa on November 29, 1780 Emperor Joseph II also became King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia and was free to pursue his own policy, and he immediately directed his government on a new course, attempting to realize his ideal of enlightened despotism acting on a definite system for the good of all.\n\nJoseph II (German: Joseph Benedikt Anton Michel Adam; March 13, 1741 – February 20, 1790) was Holy Roman Emperor from August 1765 and sole ruler of the Habsburg lands from November 1780 until his death. He was the eldest son of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband, Emperor Franz I, and the brother of Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI of France and Navarre. He was thus the first ruler in the Austrian dominions of the House of Lorraine, styled Habsburg-Lorraine. Joseph was a proponent of enlightened absolutism; however, his commitment to modernizing reforms subsequently engendered significant opposition, which resulted in failure to fully implement his programs.\n\nJoseph married Princess Isabella of Parma in October 1760, a union fashioned to bolster the 1756 defensive pact between France and Austria. (The bride’s mother, Princess Louise Élisabeth, was the eldest daughter of King Louis XV of France and Navarre. Isabella’s father was Philip, Duke of Parma.) Joseph loved his bride, Isabella, finding her both stimulating and charming, and she sought with special care to cultivate his favor and affection. Isabella also found a best friend and confidant in her husband’s sister, Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen.\n\nThe marriage of Joseph and Isabella resulted in the birth of a daughter, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria (1762–1770), Just a few months short of her eighth birthday, Archduchess Maria Theresa became ill with pleurisy. Her father, by that time Holy Roman Emperor, did everything in his power to save her and attended her bedside even at night. However, the medicine in those days was highly undeveloped and Archduchess Maria Theresa died on January 23, 1770 from a very high fever.\n\nPrincess Isabella of Parma\n\nIn November 1763, while six months pregnant, Isabella fell ill with smallpox and went into premature labor, resulting in the birth of their second child, Archduchess Maria Christina, who died shortly after being born. Progressively ill with smallpox and strained by sudden childbirth and tragedy, Isabella died the following week. The loss of his beloved wife and their newborn child was devastating for Joseph, after which he felt keenly reluctant to remarry.\n\nFor political reasons, and under constant pressure, in 1765, he relented and married his second cousin, Princess Maria Josepha of Bavaria, the daughter of Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor, and Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, the daughter of Emperor Joseph I and Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg. This marriage proved extremely unhappy, albeit brief, as it lasted only two years. Though Maria Josepha loved her husband, she felt timid and inferior in his company. Lacking common interests or pleasures, the relationship offered little for Joseph, who confessed he felt no love (nor attraction) for her in return.\n\nPrincess Maria Josepha of Bavaria\n\nFour months after the second anniversary of their wedding, Maria Josepha grew ill and died from smallpox. Joseph neither visited her during her illness nor attended her funeral, though he later expressed regret for not having shown her more kindness, respect, or warmth. Joseph never remarried.\n\nOn the death of his father, Holy Roman Emperor Franz I in 1765, he was succeeded as Emperor by his eldest son, Joseph II, and as Grand Duke of Tuscany by his younger son, Peter Leopold (later Emperor Leopold II). Maria Theresa retained the government of her hereditary dominions, Austria, Hungary and Bohemia until her own death in 1780. As emperor, he had little true power, and his mother had resolved that neither her husband nor her son should ever deprive her of sovereign control in her hereditary dominions.\n\nJoseph II (right) with his brother Peter Leopold, then Grand Duke of Tuscany, later Emperor Leopold II, by Pompeo Batoni, 1769, Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum\n\nThe death of Maria Theresa on November 29, 1780 left Joseph free to pursue his own policy, and he immediately directed his government on a new course, attempting to realize his ideal of enlightened despotism acting on a definite system for the good of all. He undertook the spread of education, the secularization of church lands, the reduction of the religious orders and the clergy, in general, to complete submission to the lay state, the issue of the Patent of Tolerance (1781) providing limited guarantee of freedom of worship, and the promotion of unity by the compulsory use of the German language (replacing Latin or in some instances local languages)—everything which from the point of view of 18th-century philosophy, the Age of Enlightenment, appeared “reasonable”.\n\nDespite making some territorial gains, his reckless foreign policy badly isolated Austria. He has been ranked, with Catherine II the Great of Russia and Friedrich II the Great of Prussia, as one of the three great Enlightenment monarchs. His reputation as an enlightened monarch was somewhat legendary, leading to false, but influential letters depicting him as a radical philosopher. His policies are now known as Josephinism. He was a supporter of the arts, and most importantly, of composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri.\n\nIn November 1788, Joseph returned to Vienna with ruined health and was left abandoned. His minister Kaunitz refused to visit his sick-room and did not see him for two years. His brother Leopold remained at Florence. At last, Joseph, worn out and broken-hearted, recognized that his servants could not, or would not, carry out his plans.\n\nJoseph died on February 20, 1790. He is buried in tomb number 42 in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. He asked that his epitaph read: “Here lies Joseph II, who failed in all he undertook.” Joseph was succeeded by his brother, Leopold II."
