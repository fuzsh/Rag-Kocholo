        "text": "THE COPY OF MARIA THERESA OF AUSTRIA, HOLY ROMAN EMPERESS, BOUND IN CONTEMPORARY MOROCCO-GILT AND BEARING HER ELABORATE ROYAL ARMS\n\n(MARIA THERESA OF AUSTRIA) MAISONNEUVE, Madame de. Journal des Dames. La Haye and Paris: J.B.P. Valleyre, 1764. Slim octavo, contemporary full olive morocco, elaborately gilt-decorated spine and covers bearing the gilt armorial arms of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, marbled endpapers, all edges gilt. Housed in a custom clamshell box.\n\nFirst edition of this journal consisting of works by 18th-century women writers, meant to encourage further literary pursuits by women. The copy of Maria Theresa of Austria, Holy Roman Empress, the only female ruler of the Habsburg dominions and the last of the House of Habsburg, bound in beautiful morocco-gilt and bearing her royal arms.\n\nMaria Theresa of Habsburg (1717-1780) married François Stéphane, Duke of Lorraine, Emperor of Germany from 1745-1765 (as François I). While Maria Theresa was the last of the Habsburgs, with her husband she was the founder of the branch of Habsbourg-Lorraine, and mother of Marie-Antoinette and two Holy Roman Emperors: Joseph II and Leopold II. The Journal des Dames was a periodical that was published with a single purpose—to encourage women to engage in serious writing pursuits such as poetry and essays. It went through three editors during its run, including Madame de Maisonneuve, a member of the Parisian aristocracy. Today, it is regarded as an important artifact of its time—the Age of Enlightenment—when a progressive attitude with regard to women’s rights, culture, and other topics was becoming more widespread. Text in French. Bookplates, old shelf label to front pastedown and notation to front free endpaper.\n\nFine condition, a lovely volume with distinguished noble provenance."
