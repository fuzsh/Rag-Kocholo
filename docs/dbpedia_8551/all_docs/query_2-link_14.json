        "text": "Louise de la Vallière was born in 1644 in the Bourbonnais region, and came to the Court of France in 1661 as maid of honour to Henrietta of England, the wife of Monsieur, the King’s brother. Louis XIV pretended to court her to mask his affair with his sister-in-law. Louise soon won him over, however, with her blonde hair and charming smile. She was humble and modest, an accomplished horse rider and had a strong liking for music. Louis made her his mistress, even though he was already married to Maria Theresa of Spain. Versailles, still Louis XIII’s simple hunting lodge at the time, served as a retreat for the lovers.\n\nAfter Anne of Austria’s death in 1666, Louis XVI made Louise de La Vallière his new favourite. He recognized their two children, Mademoiselle de Blois and the Count of Vermandois, and gave Louise the title of Duchess of Vaujours and La Vallière."
