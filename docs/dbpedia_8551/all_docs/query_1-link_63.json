        "text": "Servant Sister of the Home fo the Mother\n\nWhen and where were you born?\n\nI was born on the 9th of April 1980 in San Fernando (Cádiz).\n\nIs your whole family from there? Tell us about them.\n\nMy father is called Paco and he’s from Cartagena (Murcia); my mother is called Maty and she’s from San Fernando (Cádiz). I have two younger sisters: Fátima, who is twenty, and Gema who is eleven.\n\nWhat do you remember of your childhood?\n\nBecause of my father’s profession (marine), we were always moving. I was in six different schools. Sometimes I used to arrive halfway through the year, with all that this entails: new city, new classmates, new books. This has influenced my character a lot, positively as much as negatively. On the one hand it has helped me to realise that I’m only passing through in this life, that I have no permanent dwelling-place in this world; on the other hand, it led me to close myself up and not to form bonds with anyone, because whenever I began to make friends with someone, I had to move."
