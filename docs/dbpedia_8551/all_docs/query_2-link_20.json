        "text": "The Archduke Francis of Austria\n\nOil on canvas. 1770\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nFrancis of Austria (1768-1835) was the son of Leopold and Maria Luisa, Grand Duke and Duchess of Tuscany, and the grandson of Charles III of Spain. He was the last Holy Roman Emperor, becoming the first Emperor of Austria. Francis was also the father-in-law of Napoleon. He is depicted wearing the emblem of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\nFerdinand IV, King of Naples\n\nOil on canvas. 1760\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nFerdinand IV (1751-1825) was the third son of Charles VII of Naples and his wife, Maria Amalia of Saxony. When his father acceded to the Spanish throne as Charles III in 1759, he became king of Naples. The sitter wears the Orders of the Golden Fleece and San Gennaro. His childish grace contrasts with the courtly pomp of the setting.\n\nMaría Luisa of Parma, Princess of Asturias\n\nOil on canvas. 1766\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nMengs painted these portraits of the heirs to the Spanish throne -the prince and princess of Asturias, Carlos de Borbón and Maria Luisa of Parma- on the occasion of their wedding. As the daughter of Philip I, Duke of Parma, and Louise Isabelle of France, and thus granddaughter of Kings Philip V and Louis XV, Maria Luisa was Queen Consort of Spain between 1788 and 1808. She wears a light-col\n\nMaria Luisa of Spain, Grand Duchess of Tuscany\n\nOil on canvas. 1770\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nDaughter of Charles III of Spain and Maria Amalia of Saxony, the sitter was born in Naples in 1745. In 1765 she married Leopold of Austria, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and bore sixteen children, including the Emperor Francis II. The sitter is depicted wearing an elegant grey silk dress, highlighted with lace, bows and other details, all executed in a notably virtuoso technique. The canvas forms a pair\n\nPenitent Magdalene\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1765\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nMary Magdalene, recognisable by her beauty, semi-nudity and the skull -a symbol of meditation on death- prays before a cross made from a branch. Based on a celebrated seventeenth-century Bolognese painting, Mengs painted the first version of this composition in Rome around 1760. This one was painted for his friend Alberico Pini, valet to Charles III.\n\nArchduke Leopold of Austria, Grand Duke of Tuscany\n\nOil on canvas. 1770\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nSecond son of the Empress Maria Teresa and of Francis I, the sitter was born in 1747. He succeeded his brother Joseph II, who died without heir in 1790, as emperor of Germany and died in 1792. Brother of Marie Antoinette, Leopold attempted to raise a coalition of forces against the French Revolutionary regime. This portrait, together with those of his wife (P-2199) and their children, was painted\n\nJavier of Bourbon and Saxony, Infante of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. 1767\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nFrancisco Javier (1757-1771), youngest son of Charles III and Maria Amalia of Saxony, was painted by Mengs in the Palace of San Ildefonso, Segovia, as were his brothers, Antonio and Gabriel. The pose and expression are particularly natural and the traditional accessories of royal portraiture are reduced to the column, curtain and insignias of the Orders of the Golden Fleece, Santiago and San Genna\n\nSelf-portrait\n\nOil on panel. 1761 - 1769\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nPresented almost half-length with his face turned to the viewer, Mengs wears a velvet gown and holds the tools of his trade. The panel was painted shortly after the artist’s arrival in Spain and uses a distinctive, sketchy technique that allows the underlayer of priming to show through. The artist reappears in the Prado’s Adoration of the Shepherds (P-2204).\n\nArchduchess Maria Theresa of Austria\n\nOil on canvas. 1771\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nIn portraits of female subjects, Anton Rafael Mengs displays a warm and gentle quality, more Rococo in tone than the slightly academic coldness marking his historical and mythological compositions. The eldest daughter of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany and a granddaughter of Charles III, the Archduchess María Teresa Habsburg-Lorena is shown here at full length, next to a caged parrot. Her dress,\n\nMaria Carolina of Habsburg-Lorraine, Queen of Naples\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1768\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nDaughter of the Empress María Teresa Habsburg and the Emperor Francisco I of Lorena, María Carolina Habsburg-Lorena (Vienna, 1752-1814) married Ferdinand IV of Naples in 1768, and bore seventeen children. According to Benedetto Croce, Napoleon called her “the only man in the kingdom of Naples”. She is shown here sumptuously dressed and bejeweled, against a landscape of distant trees\n\nAbdication of Charles III\n\nOil on canvas. 1759\n\nJoli, Antonio\n\nOn August 10, 1759, Ferdinand VI died without a descendant. As a result, his stepbrother Charles, then King of Naples and Sicily, inherited the Spanish throne. The first of seven children of Philip V and his second wife Isabel Farnese, Charles VII had reigned for a period of almost 24 years in Naples. In 1738, he had married the Pricess María Amalia of Saxony, and their thirteen children we\n\nHead of an Apostle\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1764\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nThis vigorously modelled study, in which the priming of the canvas is left visible, relates to Mengs’s great canvas of The Ascension. Painted for the high altar of Dresden cathedral, it survived the devastation of the city in the 1945 bombings. It reflects Mengs’s profound knowledge of Italian Renaissance and Baroque painting, particularly the work of Guido Reni.\n\nHead of an Apostle\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1764\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nThis highly finished study, in which the priming of the canvas is left visible, relates to one of the heads in The Ascension, painted by Mengs for the high altar of Dresden cathedral. He began the final work around 1755 in Rome, inspired by “the divine Raphael” in his own words. It was completed in Madrid in 1766 and sent from there to Dresden.\n\nThe Prince of Asturias, the future Charles IV\n\nOil on canvas. 1766\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nThis portrait of Charles IV as the Prince of Asturias has as its pendant a portrait of his wife, María Luisa of Parma, also in the Museo del Prado (P2189). Anton Raphael Mengs had come to Spain in 1761 at the invitation of Charles III in order to serve as pintor de camára, or court painter, the most prestigious appointment for an artist in the service of the king. He probably produce\n\nSaint Peter preaching\n\nOil on canvas. 1761 - 1777\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nThis work recalls the philosophers and Apostles by the Baroque painter José de Ribera, albeit refining their pictorial language from the more restrained perspective of Neo-classicism. Saint Peter points to the heavens with his right hand, a gesture that encourages a reflection on the divine mysteries and also refers to his eloquence as an orator.\n\nCharles VII of Naples, the future Charles III of Spain\n\nSculpted. Ca. 1744\n\nAnonymous\n\nA medallion portraying the young Charles of Bourbon (1716-1788), recently proclaimed King of Naples and Sicily, who would become King Charles III of Spain in 1759. Shown in profile with a large wig and dressed all’antica, his breastplate bears a head of Medusa, an allusion to the mythological heroes, and the golden fleece, the symbol of the Order of the same name.\n\nConsole table\n\nGilded, Carved. 1750 - 1800\n\nAnonymous\n\nThis console table in the French Baroque style has a straight back, a moulded frieze of mixtilinear form at the sides and a central apron carved and pierced with foliate motifs. It rests on four cabriole legs joined by a central x-stretcher with rocaille decoration. Tables of this type were generally paired with a mirror and were very popular in Spain in the 19th century."
