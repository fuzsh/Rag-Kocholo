Some of the Markgrafen of the East March, from the mid- to late-9th century, are set out in Chapter 1, although it has not yet been possible to establish a full chronological list of holders of the title. It is not known how long this March remained in existence.\n\nA new march along the Hungarian frontier was established in 976 by Emperor Otto II, who installed Liutpold as Markgraf (see Chapter 2). This new march developed into Austria. The name \"Babenberg\" was first applied to the first dynasty of Austrian Markgrafen and Dukes probably in the 12th or 13th centuries. This was due to a tradition that the first Markgrafen were descended from the \"alte Babenberger\" family who are set out in the document FRANCONIA. This descent does not appear to have been based on any primary source proof. More recently, it has been suggested that Markgraf Liutpold was the son of Arnulf Duke of Bavaria [Liutpoldinger] but this theory appears to be based solely on onomastics . In fact, there are few typically \"Liutpoldinger\" names among Markgraf Liutpold's children, in particular Eberhard, Berthold and Arnulf are absent. Reuter says that Markgraf Liutpold was \"related both to the Liutpoldinger and indirectly to the Babenberger\" but the basis for this statement is not known.\n\nThe March of Austria was part of the territory of the duchy of Bavaria until 1156, when it was elevated to the status of a separate duchy in order to compensate Heinrich II Markgraf of Austria for the loss of Bavaria when Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" returned it to the Welf family . The duchies of Austria and Styria were partially integrated into imperial administration after the death in 1246 of Friedrich II Duke of Austria . Following the accession of the Habsburg dukes in 1276, the history of Austria became closely identified with that of the whole Holy Roman Empire, as the majority of emperors after that date were Habsburgs, the appointment becoming exclusive to the dynasty from 1452 until the dissolution of the empire by Napoleon in 1806.\n\nChapter 1.

Ellinrat is the only daughter who is named elsewhere, but the text may refer to an otherwise unknown daughter of Emperor Arnulf.]\n\n1. ARIBO, son of --- ([835/45]-after 909) . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"duo fratres Willihelmus et Engilscalcus\" were granted \"terminum regni Baioariorum in Oriente\" by Ludwig II \"der Deutsche\" King of the East Franks and that they held the territory against the Moravians, were killed in battle, but that their sons were not confirmed as their successors, the land being granted to \"Erbo\" .\n\nChapter 2. MARKGRAFEN of AUSTRIA, DUKES from 1156 (BABENBERG)\n\nA. MARKGRAFEN of AUSTRIA 976-1156 (BABENBERG)\n\n1. LIUTPOLD, son of --- ([950/55]-murdered Würzburg 10 Jul 994, bur Würzburg). The origin of Liutpold is unknown. According to early tradition, he was descended from the \"alte Babenberger\" family whose genealogy is set out in the document FRANCONIA NOBILITY, accounting for the later attribution of this name to the dynasty. This descent does not appear to have been based on any primary source proof. More recently, it has been suggested that Markgraf Liutpold was the son of Arnulf Duke of Bavaria [Liutpoldinger] but this theory appears to be based solely on onomastics . In fact, there are few typically \"Liutpoldinger\" names among Markgraf Liutpold's children, in particular Eberhard, Berthold and Arnulf are absent. Reuter says that Markgraf Liutpold was \"related both to the Liutpoldinger and indirectly to the Babenberger\" but the basis for this statement is not known. His birth date is estimated on the basis that he was a young adult when installed as Markgraf. Graf in der Nordgau . He was installed by Emperor Otto II in 976 as LIUTPOLD I Markgraf der bayerischen Ostmark, the newly created march bordering Hungary . Graf im Traungau 977. Graf im Sundergau 979. Graf im Donaugau 983. The necrology of Fulda records the death in 994 of \"Liutbold marchio\" . Thietmar records that \"Leopold Markgraf of the East\" was murdered on 10 Jul at Würzburg by an individual who wrongly blamed him for blinding his brother, and that he was buried at Würzburg . The Liber Anniversariorum of Einsiedeln records the death in Jul of \"Lupoldus com et marchio in Orientali Baioaria\" . The necrology of Regensburg St Emmeran records the death \"VI Id Jul\" of \"Liutpolt marchio com\" . m RICHWARA, daughter of [ERNST Graf im Sualafeld & his wife ---] (-bur Stift Melk). A continuator of the Gesta Treverorum records \"domnus Poppo\" and \"patri eius Luopaldi qui regionis Austriæ marcam tenebat, mater Richeza ducis Germaniæ Franciæ filia\" . A list of names in the Verbrüderungsbuch of Reichenau abbey reads \"Luitpold marches, Rihuuar, Iudita, Heinrich, Ernust, Poppo, Luitpold, Cunigurrt, Adalbr\" , which appears to refer to Markgraf Liutpold, his wife and children. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , the wife of Markgraf I was the daughter of Graf Ernst. The primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. It is possible that it is based solely on onomastic speculation, because of the transmission of the name Ernst into the Babenberg family with her son. Markgraf Liutpold I & his wife had [eight] children:\n\na) [JUDITH . The primary source which confirms her parentage has not yet been identified. A list of names in the Verbrüderungsbuch of Reichenau abbey reads \"Luitpold marches, Rihuuar, Iudita, Heinrich, Ernust, Poppo, Luitpold, Cunigurrt, Adalbr\" , which appears to refer to Markgraf Liutpold, his wife and children. If this is correct, it is unclear why Judith should be listed before her supposed brothers. Another possibility is that Judith in this list was the second wife of Markgraf Liutpold.]\n\nb) HEINRICH ([970/73]-23/24 Jun 1018, bur Melk). The Auctarium Vindobonense names \"marchiam Austriam Heinricus secundus, filius Liupoldi\" . His birth date range is estimated on the assumption that he was at least a young adult when succeeding his father. If this is correct, he must have been considerably older than his brothers shown below. This does suggest that they may have been born from different mothers, although it is not considered that this speculation is sufficiently definite to show these possible two marriages of Markgraf Liutpold, even in square brackets, above. A list of names in the Verbrüderungsbuch of Reichenau abbey reads \"Luitpold marches, Rihuuar, Iudita, Heinrich, Ernust, Poppo, Luitpold, Cunigurrt, Adalbr\" , which appears to refer to Markgraf Liutpold, his wife and children. He succeeded his father in 994 as HEINRICH I Markgraf der Ostmark. The Altahense Annales record the sudden death in 1018 of \"Heinricus marchio Austria\" and specify that he was succeeded by \"Adalbertus filius eius\" . Thietmar records the death on 24 Jun 1018 of \"Heinrich [who] held the march between the Hungarians and the Bavarians\" . The necrology of Melk records the death \"IX Kal Jul\" of \"Heinricus marchio fundator unus h l \" . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"IX Kal Jul\" of \"Heinricus marchio\" .\n\nc) ERNST von Babenberg ([985/90]-31 Mar 1015, bur Würzburg) . Thietmar names \"Ernst son of Markgraf Leopold\" when recording that he was among those sent by Heinrich II King of Germany to Lombardy after his election to quell unrest . A list of names in the Verbrüderungsbuch of Reichenau abbey reads \"Luitpold marches, Rihuuar, Iudita, Heinrich, Ernust, Poppo, Luitpold, Cunigurrt, Adalbr\" , which appears to refer to Markgraf Liutpold, his wife and children. The Chronicle of Otto von Freising, interpolated in the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines, names \"Ernesto duci Suevorum, fratri Alberti superioris Pannonis marchionis et archiepiscopi Treverensis Popponis\" as first husband of \"Gisila [imperatrix]\" , although he was in fact her second husband. His birth date range is estimated on the basis of his marriage in [1012]. He succeeded in 1012 as ERNST I Duke of Swabia. Thietmar records that \"Duke Ernst of Swabia\" died on 31 Mar after a hunting accident and was buried in Würzburg next to his father \"Markgraf Leopold\" .\n\n- DUKES of SWABIA.\n\nd) POPPO (-14 Feb or 16 Apr 1047, bur Trier St Simeon, transferred 1803 to St Gervasius) . The Annales Zwetlenses name \"Popponem episcopum Traverensem\" as brother of \"Heinricus marchio Austrie [et] frater eius Leupoldus\" , although the reference to \"Leupoldus\" appears incorrect. A list of names in the Verbrüderungsbuch of Reichenau abbey reads \"Luitpold marches, Rihuuar, Iudita, Heinrich, Ernust, Poppo, Luitpold, Cunigurrt, Adalbr\" , which appears to refer to Markgraf Liutpold, his wife and children. Wipo names \"Poppo frater Ernesti ducis\", when recording the former as Archbishop of Trier . Provost of Bamberg cathedral after 1007. The Gesta Treverorum records that Heinrich II King of Germany installed \"Popponem in Babenberch educatum\" as Archbishop of Trier in succession to \"Megingaudo\" in 1015 . A continuator of the Gesta Treverorum records \"domnus Poppo\" and \"patri eius Luopaldi qui regionis Austriæ marcam tenebat, mater Richeza ducis Germaniæ Franciæ filia\" . Thietmar records the installation of \"Poppo son of Markgraf Leopold and provost of the church of Bamberg\" as Archbishop of Trier in 1016 . Wipo, in his description of the election of Konrad II King of Germany in 1024, calls Poppo a \"pious and humble man\", says he was the brother of Duke Ernst, and that he was the guardian of the latter's son Ernst . The necrology of Melk records the death \"XVI Kal Mar\" of \"Poppo archieps Treverensis fr Heinrici marchionis\" . The Annales Necrologici Prumienses record the death in 1047 of Boppo archiepiscopus .\n\ne) [LIUTPOLD . A list of names in the Verbrüderungsbuch of Reichenau abbey reads \"Luitpold marches, Rihuuar, Iudita, Heinrich, Ernust, Poppo, Luitpold, Cunigurrt, Adalbr\" , which appears to refer to Markgraf Liutpold, his wife and children. No other reference has yet been found to a son named Liutpold.]\n\nf) KUNIGUNDE . The primary source which confirms her parentage has not yet been identified. A list of names in the Verbrüderungsbuch of Reichenau abbey reads \"Luitpold marches, Rihuuar, Iudita, Heinrich, Ernust, Poppo, Luitpold, Cunigurrt, Adalbr\" , which appears to refer to Markgraf Liutpold, his wife and children.\n\ng) ADALBERT ([990/994]-26 May 1055, bur Stift Melk) . A list of names in the Verbrüderungsbuch of Reichenau abbey reads \"Luitpold marches, Rihuuar, Iudita, Heinrich, Ernust, Poppo, Luitpold, Cunigurrt, Adalbr\" , which appears to refer to Markgraf Liutpold, his wife and children. The primary sources are contradictory regarding the parentage of Markgraf Adalbert. The Auctarium Vindobonense names \"Adalbertus tertius marchio Austria\", but does not specify his relationship with his predecessor . The Altahense Annales record the sudden death in 1018 of \"Heinricus marchio Austria\" and specify that he was succeeded by \"Adalbertus filius eius\" . However, the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines name \"Ernesto duci Suevorum, fratri Alberti superioris Pannonis marchionis et archiepiscopi Treverensis Popponis\" . As shown above, Thietmar records both Ernst Duke of Swabia and Poppo Archbishop of Trier as sons of Markgraf Liutpold . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"VII Kal Jun\" of \"Adalbertus marchio filius Heinrici marchionis\" , apparently confirming the parentage set out in the Atahense Annales. On the other hand, the necrology of Melk records the death \"XVI Kal Mar\" of \"Poppo archieps Treverensis fr Heinrici marchionis\" . On balance, more primary sources indicate that Adalbert was the son of Markgraf Liutpold rather than of Markgraf Heinrich. His estimated birth date range is based on the birth date range estimated for his older son, with the death of Markgraf Liutpold in 994 representing the later limit of this range on the assumption that Adalbert was his son. Just to confuse the question of Adalbert's parentage even further, it should be noted that this range would not be inconsistent with Adalbert having been the son of Markgraf Heinrich. Graf im Schweinach 1010. Graf im Künzig 1011. He succeeded his brother in 1018 as ADALBERT \"der Siegreiche\" Markgraf der Ostmark [of Austria]. The necrology of Salzburg St Rudpert records the death \"VII Kal Jun\" of \"Adalpreht marchio\" . The necrology of Melk records the death \"VII Kal Jun\" of \"Adalbertus marchio\" . m firstly (before [1020/25]) --- (-before 1041). Markgraf Adalbert's first marriage is deduced from the estimated birth date range of his older son Liutpold. The identity of this first wife of Markgraf Adalbert is unknown. She has been identified as Glismod ---, daughter of Immed Graf in Utrecht & his wife Adela [von Hamaland] . This is presumably based on the Annales Stadenses which name \"Lippoldo filio domine Glismodis\" as husband of \"Ida [de Elsthorpe]\" . \"Lippoldo\" has been assumed to be Liutpold Margraf der Ungarischen Mark, son of Markgraf Adalbert, but this appears to be impossible if Ida von Elstorf had four children by her first husband . The only definite information concerning Glismod's husband is found in the Vita Meinwerci which names \"Thiedericum, Meinwercum, Glismod et Azelam\" as children of Immed and Athela and specifies that Glismod married \"nobilis principis in Baioaria\" . Another possibility is that her name was Adelheid. The necrology of Melk records the death \"VII Kal Feb\" of \"Adalheida marchionissa ux Adalberti marchionis Austrie\" . At first sight, \"Adalberti\" has assumed to be an error for \"Ernesti\" as the latter's wife is the only known \"marchionissa\" of that name. However, the entry may alternatively refer to the otherwise unknown first wife of Markgraf Adalbert. The necrology of Kloster Neuburg also records the death \"VII Kal Feb\" of \"Adelheidis marchionissa\" but does not name her husband. m secondly (shortly before 1041) FROIZZA [Frowila] Orseolo, daughter of PIETRO OTTONE Orseolo Doge of Venice & his wife [Grimelda or Maria] of Hungary ([1015]-17 Feb 1071, bur Melk). Herimannus refers to \"sororis suæ [=Peterum regem]\" as wife of \"marchionem nostrum Adalbertum\" when recording her marriage in 1041 . She is named in three imperial charters, although these are not consistent about the spelling of her name. \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" granted property \"in circuitu duorum fluminum Zaiouua\" to \"marchioni Adalberto et coniugi suæ (Froiza)\" by charter dated 21 Apr 1048 . \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" granted property to \"Adelberti marchionis [et] uxorique sue Froize\" dated 12 Nov 1051\" . \"Heinricus rex\" granted property \"in locis Ortvvinesdorf et Pirchehe in marcha Osterriche et in comitatu Ernestes marchionis\" to \"Frovvilæ Adeberti marhchionis viduæ\" by charter dated 1 Oct 1058 . The necrology of Melk records the death \"XIII Kal Mar\" of \"Frouza marchionissa\" . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"XIII Kal Mar\" of \"Fruoza marchionissa\" . Markgraf Adalbert & his first wife had two children:\n\ni) LIUTPOLD ([1020/25]-Ingelheim 9 Dec 1043, bur Trier) . Herimannus names \"Adalberto marchione et filio eius Liutpaldo\" when recording their jointly leading part of the army to the southern Danube area in 1042 . His birth date range is estimated on the assumption that he was a young adult or late adolescent at this time. He was installed as Markgraf der Ungarischen Mark in Dec 1043 at Ingelheim . Herimannus records his installation as marchio, but also his death a few days later . The Chronicon of Bernold records the death in 1043 of \"Liutpaldus Adalberti marchionis filius\" at Ingelheim after the marriage of Heinrich III King of Germany and Agnes de Poitou . The necrology of Melk records the death \"V Id Dec\" of \"Liupoldus fortis mil fil Alberti marchionis\" . The first husband of Ida von \"Elstorf\", daughter of Liudolf Markgraf in Friesland [Braunschweig] & his wife Gertrud von Egisheim, is identified as Liutpold Markgraf der Ungarischen Mark in Europäischen Stammtafeln . Presumably this is based firstly on the Annales Stadenses which name \"Lippoldo filio domine Glismodis\" as husband of \"Ida [de Elsthorpe]\" , and secondly on the Vita Meinwerci which names \"Thiedericum, Meinwercum, Glismod et Azelam\" as children of Immed and Athela, specifying that Glismod married \"nobilis principis in Baioaria\" , although there is no evidence linking the second with the first. The fact that Ida von Elstorf had children by her first husband, if correct, also indicates that that this co-identity cannot be right . She married secondly Dedo Graf von Dietmarschen, and thirdly Etheler Graf von Dietmarschen.\n\nii) ERNST (-killed in battle near Homburg/Unstrut 9 Jun 1075, bur Melk) . The Auctarium Vindobonense names \"Ernust filius eius [=Adalbertus] quartus marchio Austrie\" when recording that he succeeded his father .

[---. m ---.] One child:\n\na) HEINRICH . Thietmar records that \"Leopold Markgraf of the East and Heinrich his nephew\" were invited to attend mass by the Bishop of Würzburg 8 Jul [994] . Wegener states that Heinrich was the same person as Heinrich von Schweinfurt Markgraf auf dem Nordgau (d. 1017), which accords with his theory (based only on onomastics) that both Markgraf Liutpold I and Berthold Markgraf auf dem Nordgau, father of Heinrich, were sons of Arnulf Duke of Bavaria [Liutpoldinger].\n\nThe precise relationship between the following small family sub-group and the Markgrafen of Austria has not been established:\n\n1.

The Genealogica Wettinensis names \"Adelhidis [et] Agnes\" as the two daughters of \"secundus filius [comitis Tiderici] Dedo\" and his wife Oda, naming \"Hernesto marchioni de Bavaria\" as wife of Adelheid and \"Luppoldum marchionem\" as their son . The Annales Gotwicenses record the death in 1071 of \"Adalheit marchionissa\" . The necrology of Melk records the death \"VII Kal Feb\" of \"Adalheida marchionissa ux Adalberti marchionis Austrie\" . At first sight, \"Adalberti\" has assumed to be an error for \"Ernesti\" as the latter's wife is the only known \"marchionissa\" of that name. However, the entry may alternatively refer to the otherwise unknown first wife of Markgraf Adalbert. The necrology of Kloster Neuburg also records the death \"VII Kal Feb\" of \"Adelheidis marchionissa\" but does not name her husband.\n\nm secondly (1071 or after) SUANAHILD, daughter of ---. The primary source which confirms her marriage has not yet been identified. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , she was Suanahild, daughter of Sieghard [VII] or [VIII] Graf [Sieghardinger] & his wife Pilihild ---, but the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified.\n\nMarkgraf Ernst & his first wife had [three] children:\n\n1. LIUTPOLD ([1058/63]-12 Oct 1095, bur Gars) . The Auctarium Vindobonense names \"Liutpoldus filius eius [=Ernust] quintus marchio\" . His birth date range is estimated from the estimated birth dates of his mother and his son Markgraf Leopold. He succeeded his father in 1075 as LIUTPOLD II Markgraf of Austria. The Chronica Boemorum records that \"dux Wratislaus et sui fratres Chounradus atque Otto\" fought against \"orientalem marchionem Lupoldum filium Lucz\", the passage being undated with the date 1082 inserted in the margin of the edition . It is assumed that this refers to Markgraf Liutpold II, although the reference to \"filium Lucz\" is unexplained. The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis records the death in 1095 of \"Liupoldus marchio\" . The Chronicon of Mariano Scotti records the death in 1095 of \"Liupoldus marchio\" . The necrology of Melk records the death \"IV Id Oct\" of \"Liupoldus marchio qui monachum vitam hic instituit\" . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"IV Id Oct\" of \"Liupoldus prior marchio\" . m IDA, daughter of --- (-Asia Minor [Sep] 1101 or after). The parentage of Markgräfin Ida is uncertain. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , she was Ida von Ratelberg, daughter of Thiemo [II] Graf [Formbach] & his wife ---, although the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. Wegener quotes a 12th century document concerning travel tolls at Schärding dated [1060/70] which names \"filios Tiemonis Ekkebertum et Henricum et dominam Itam\" as participating in the foundation of Suben monastery but he does not make the connection between this Ita and the Margräfin of Austria . The chronology is not favourable for Ida having been the daughter of Graf Thiemo [II], whose death is recorded in 1040. If this paternity was correct, Ida would therefore have been about twenty years older than her husband, and at least in her early to mid-forties when she gave birth to her son Liutpold, which seems improbable. The primary source which confirms her name \"von Ratelberg\" has not yet been identified. The Auctarium Mariaecellense in 1100 records that \"Ita marchionisse Austrie, Liupoldi marchionis relicta\" left for Jerusalem . Albert of Aix records that \"Willelmus comes et princeps Pictaviensium, de sanguine et origine Henrici tertii imperatoris Romanorum\" crossed Hungary peacefully with \"duce Bawariorum Welfone et comitssa Ida de marchia Osterrich\", entered the territory of the Bulgars in which \"duce Bulgarorum Guz\" refused their passage into Adrianople, but that Guillaume captured \"ducem Bulgarorum\" who was forced to allow the pilgrims to continue, undated but in a passage adjacent to text which records events in 1101 . The army was scattered after being defeated by the Turks near Tarsus in Asia Minor in [Sep] 1101. It is not known what happened to Markgräfin Ida, but she was presumably killed. Albert of Aix says that the fate of Ida is completely unknown, but adding that \"some say that she was taken into permanent exile in the kingdom of Khorazan among the thousand women who were taken\" . According to later legend, she ended her days in a harem where she gave birth to the Muslim hero Zengi (which is chronologically impossible): the Historia Welforum records that \"Itam comitissam, matrem Leopaldi marchionis orientalis\" was kidnapped by \"unus de principibus Sarracenorum ex eaque Sanguinem illum sceleratissumum, ut aiunt, progenuit\" . Markgraf Liutpold II & his wife had seven children:\n\na) ELISABETH (-9 Oct [1107-1111]) . The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis refers to three (unnamed) sisters of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\", specifying that one married \"Otakarus marchio Styriæ\" . The Genealogia Marchionum de Stire names \"Elyzabet sororem marchionis Austrie Liupoldi\" as wife of \"Otachyr marchionem\" . The Altahense Annales name \"Elysabeth\" as the wife of \"Otakarus marchio de Styria\" when recording their joint foundation in 1107 of \"monasterium in Gaersten\" . Her marriage date is estimated from the fact that the children of Markgraf Liutpold II must have been born in the period [1080/90]. The necrology of Melk records the death \"VII Id Oct\" of \"Elisabeth marchionissa de Stiro sor Liupoldi III marchionis de Austria\" . m ([1090/1100]) [as his second wife,] OTAKAR II Markgraf of Styria, son of OTAKAR I Markgraf der Kärnter Mark [Styria] & his wife Willibirg of Carinthia [Eppensteiner] (-28 Nov 1122).\n\nb) JUDITH (6 Aug ----, bur Melk).

The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis refers to three (unnamed) sisters of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\", specifying that the third daughter married \"dux Boemiæ Pozwaius\" . The Chronica Boemorum records the marriage \"XV Kal Nov 1100\" of \"Borivoy, frater ducis Bracizlai\" with \"Helbirk, orientalis marchionis Lupoldi sororem\" .

He succeeded his father in 1095 as LEOPOLD III \"der Heilige\" Markgraf of Austria.\n\n- see below.\n\nf) SOPHIE (-2 or 10 May 1154, bur Stift Melk) . Wegener quotes the Landbuch von Österreich und Steier [1255] which records that \"der marchgrave Liupolt von Osterrich het zwo tochter die andern tochter gab er dem graven Sighart der daz Scharsa hiez und gab im zu der tochter Schala\" . Her first marriage is confirmed by the Codex Traditionum of Formbach monastery which records a donation by \"Sirus qui et Sigehardus Comes de Scala et eius consors domna Sophia cum filio suo Henrico\", for the soul of \"prioris mariti sui Karinthiorum quondam ducis Heinrici\" . \"Sirus qui et Sigehardus comes de Scala et eius consors domna Sophia cum filio suo Heinrico\" donated property to Kloster Formbach, for the soul of \"prioris mariti sui Karinthiorum quondam ducis Heinrici\", by charter dated to before 1142 .

Wegener quotes the Landbuch von Österreich und Steier [1255] which records that \"der marchgrave Liupolt von Osterrich het zwo tochter den graven Chunrat gab im der tochter ein, unt gab im zu der tochter Peilstein\" . The primary source which confirms her name has not yet been identified. m as his first wife, KONRAD von Tengling, son of FRIEDRICH [II] Graf von Tengling [Sieghardinger] & his wife [Mathilde von Lechsgemünd] (-15/16/17 Mar [1168]). Graf von Peilstein.\n\n2. [JUSTIZIA (-30 Jan ----, bur Thanning) . The De Fundatoribus Monasterii Diessenses names \"Iusticia cometissa\" as wife of \"Otto comes senior de Wolfratshausen\" and in a later passage records her death \"18 Kal Feb\" and burial at \"Danningen\" . The necrology of Diessen records the death \"Feb III Kal\" of \"Justicia com, sepulta Daniggen, mater Hainrici Ratisponensis ep et Ottonis comitis fundatoris nostri\" . Her origin is open to some debate. Europäische Stammtafeln indicates Justizia as the daughter of Ernst Markgraf of Austria and his first wife , presumably based on Lechner , which would explain the transmission of the name Luitpold into the Wolfratshausen family. According to Wegener, she was the daughter of Luitpold, older brother of Markgraf Ernst, on the assumption that her father must be named Luitpold to justify the name transmission . It is not certain that such an assumption is correct, and in any case the evidence for Luitpold having married is slim (see above). Hlawitschka, noting a family relationship recorded between Heinrich Bishop of Regensburg (Justizias son) and Leopold III Markgraf of Austria (the Historia Welforum which records episcopus [=Heinrich] referring during Lent to cognatos et amicos suis among which marchione orientali Leopaldi seu aliis comitibus ac tocius Bawarie fortissimis [assuming he was one of cognatos not amicos], dated to [8 Feb/25 Mar] 1133 ), concludes that die Herkunftsfamilie Justicias dürfte demnach feststehen, but that die genaue Filiation ist aber offen . m OTTO [II] Graf von Wolfratshausen, son of BERTHOLD [I] Graf von Diessen & his wife --- (-12 Apr [1122]). Graf von Diessen before 1107.]\n\n3. [daughter . Wegener suggests that Graf Hermann married twice, his second wife being the daughter of Ernst I Markgraf of Austria in order to explain the transmission of the names Ernst and Adalbert to his two younger sons . m [as his second wife,] HERMANN [I] Graf von Poigen, son of ---.]\n\nLIUTPOLD von Babenberg, son of LIUTPOLD II Markgraf of Austria & his wife Ida [von Ratelberg] ([1080/86]-15 Nov 1136, bur Stift Klosterneuburg) . The Auctarium Vindobonense records in 1096 that \"Liutpoldus successit dictus pius, sextus marchio\" but does not specify his relationship with his predecessor . The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified. The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis records that \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie accinctus est gladio\" in 1104 , an event recorded in 1099 in the Continuatio Prædictorum Vindobonensium . It is assumed that this knighting ceremony was performed around the age of 18, which means that Liutpold was born in the range [1080/86]. This appears corroborated by the same ceremony being recorded for Liutpold's oldest son Adalbert in 1125 (see below). He succeeded his father in 1095 as LEOPOLD III \"der Heilige\" Markgraf of Austria. He founded the Cistercian monastery of Heiligenkreuz in 1133. The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis records the death \"1136 XVII Kal Dec\" of \"Liupoldus marchio Austriæ\" . The necrology of Nonnberg records the death \"XVII Kal Dec\" of \"Liupoldus marchio\" . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"XVII Kal Dec 1136\" of \"Liupoldus marchio fundator huius templi\" . He was killed while hunting. Canonised 2 Feb 1485 .\n\nm firstly --- von Perg, daughter of WALCHUN von Perg & his wife --- (-before 1105). This first marriage is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln , but the primary source on which it is based has not yet been identified.\n\nm secondly ([early] 1106) AGNES of Germany, widow of FRIEDRICH von Staufen Duke of Swabia, daughter of Emperor HEINRICH IV & his first wife Berthe de Savoie ([Summer 1072/early 1073]-28 Sep 1143, bur Klosterneuburg). The Gesta Friderici of Otto of Freising records the marriage of \"filiam unicam\" of King Heinrich IV and \"Fridericus dux Suevorum\", naming her Agnes in a later passage . In a subsequent passage, the Gesta records the second marriage of Agnes to \"Leopaldo Orientali marchioni\" . The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis records the marriage of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\" and \"Agnetem imperatoris Heinrici IV filiam\", specifying that the couple had seven children who died in infancy and eleven who survived into adulthood, six sons and five daughters . The marriage presumably took place early in the year if it is correct, as stated by Haverkamp, that it was arranged by Agnes's brother, the future Emperor Heinrich V, to obtain her future husband's support for his rebellion against their father . The Auctarium Mellicense records that Agnes, wife of \"Leopoldus marchio\", gave birth to 18 children . The Annales Magdeburgenses record the death in 1143 of \"Agnes marchionissa mater Cuonradi regis\" . The necrology of Nonnberg records the death \"VIII Kal Oct\" of \"Agnes marchionissa\" . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"VIII Kal Oct\" of \"Agnes marchionissa fundatrix h e\" .\n\nMarkgraf Leopold III & his [first/second] wife had one child:\n\n1. ADALBERT ([1107]-8/9 Nov [1138], bur Klosterneuburg) . According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Adalbert was Markgraf Leopold's son by his first marriage, although the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. On the other hand, the Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis names \"Adalbertus primogenitus\", implies (although does not specifically state) that he was the son of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\" and \"Agnetem imperatoris Heinrici IV filiam\", specifies that he was \"advocatus Niwenburgensis ecclesiæ\" and was buried \"in claustro Niwenburgensi\" with his parents . Markgraf 1119. The Continuatio Prædictorum Vindobonensium records that \"Adelbertus filius Leupoldi marchionis Austrie accingitur gladio cum 120 consertiis\" in 1125 . Assuming, as postulated above in the case of his father, that this knighting ceremony took place around the age of eighteen, this would place Adalbert's birth date in [1107], after his father's second marriage. The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis records the death in 1136 of \"Adelbertus filius pii marchionis\", recorded in the same paragraph after the death of his father but also after the statement that his brother Leopold succeeded their father , which confuses the conclusion about the order in which the three of them died. The necrology of Melk records the death \"VI Id Nov\" of \"Adalbert fil Liutpaldi marchionis\" . The necrology of Lilienfeld records the death \"VI Id Nov\" of \"Albertus marchio fil fundator S Crucis\" and his burial \"in Neuenbuerch\" . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"V Id Nov\" of \"Adelbertus Liupoldi marchionis fil advocatus\" . m firstly ([1128/29]) ADELHEID, daughter of --- (-before 1132). An undated charter confirms, among many donations, the earlier donation by \"Adelbertus marchionis Lopoldi filius\" of property \"villa Adelrichestorf\" to Kloster Neuburg for the soul of \"uxoris sue Adelhait\" . m secondly (before 1132) HEDVIG of Hungary, daughter of ÁLMOS Prince of Hungary & his wife Predslava Sviatopolkovna of Kiev. The Chronicle of Otto of Freising refers to the wife of \"Alberto Leopaldo marchionis filio\" as sister of King Bela but does not name her . She is named Hedwig in Europäische Stammtafeln , but the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified.\n\nMarkgraf Leopold & his second wife had eighteen children:\n\n2. LEOPOLD (-Niederalteich 18 Oct 1141, bur Heiligenkreuz) . The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis names \"Liupoldus\" as third son of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\" and \"Agnetem imperatoris Heinrici IV filiam\", specifying that he was made Duke of Bavaria and was buried \"apud Sanctam Crucem\" . The Continuatio states that Leopold was younger than his brother Heinrich, although if this is correct it is unclear why Leopold not Heinrich should have succeeded first as Markgraf. He succeeded his grandfather in 1136 as LEOPOLD IV Markgraf of Austria. His uterine half-brother Konrad III King of Germany invested him as LEOPOLD Duke of Bavaria in 1139 after depriving Heinrich \"der Stolze\" [Welf] of the duchy. The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis for 1142 records the death of \"Liupoldus dux et marchio filius Liupoldi marchionis\", specifying that his brother Heinrich succeeded him . The Auctarium Sancrucense specify that he was the founder of \"Sancte Crucis\" and that he was buried there . The necrology of Nonnberg records the death \"XV Kal Nov\" of \"Liupoldus dux\" . The necrology of Lilienfeld records the death \"XV Kal Nov\" of \"Leupoldus dux Bawarie et marchio Austrie fil fundatoris S Crucis\" and his burial \"in S Cruce\" . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"XV Kal Nov\" of \"Liupoldus Liupoldi marchionis fil, dux Bowarie\" and his donation . The necrology of Heiligenkreuz records the death \"XV Kal Nov 1141\" of \"dux et marchio Leopaldus quintus fil s Leopoldi fundatoris\" and his burial \"in capitulo montii no\" . m (Sep 1138) as her first husband, MARIA of Bohemia, daughter of SOBĚSLAV I UDALRICH Duke of the Bohemians & his wife Adelheid of Hungary. The Canonici Wissegradensis Continuatio Cosmæ records the marriage in 1138 of \"dux Sobezlaus filiam suam Mariam\" with \"filio Leupoldi orientalis marchionis\" specifying that it was celebrated in \"Moravia in Olomucensi parte\" . The primary source which names her husband has not yet been identified. However, it appears that Leopold is the only son to whom the text can refer. She married secondly Hermann III Markgraf von Baden and Verona. The primary source which confirms her second marriage has not yet been identified.\n\n3. HEINRICH (-13 Jan 1177, bur Vienna Schottenkloster) . The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis names \"Heinricus\" as second son of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\" and \"Agnetem imperatoris Heinrici IV filiam\" . The Continuatio states that Heinrich was older than his brother Leopold, although if this is correct it is unclear why Leopold not Heinrich should have succeeded first as Markgraf. He succeeded his brother in 1141 as HEINRICH II \"Jasomirgott\" Markgraf of Austria.\n\n- see below.\n\n4. BERTA (-9 Apr [1150], bur St Emmeran) .

AGNES ([1108/1113]-Altenburg/Thür 24/25 Jan or 26 Sep [1160/63], bur Kloster Pforte/Saale) . The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis names \"Agnes\" as second daughter of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\" and \"Agnetem imperatoris Heinrici IV filiam\", specifying that she married \"Poleslaus dux de Polan\" , although there appears to be no \"Bolesław\" at the time to whom this could refer. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Agnetam\" as \"Leopoldis marchio et Henricus sororem germanam\" and wife of \"dux Vergescelaus de Polonia\" . Her origin is further confirmed by a charter dated Jan 1150 in which Cardinal-deacon Guido informs Konrad III King of Germany of the steps he took against \"ducis Poloniæ et coniugis eius sororis vestræ ducis W\" . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"VIII Kal Feb\" of \"Agnes ducissa Polonie filia marchionis\" .

He took part in the Second Crusade in 1147. He wrote the work of historical theology Chronica sive Historia de duabus civitatibus between 1143 and 1146. Between 1157 and 1158, he wrote the first two books of the Gesta Friderici, dealing with the history of the kings of Germany since Heinrich IV . The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis records the death in 1158 of \"Otto Frisingensis episcopus, Liupoldi pii marchionis filius\" . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"X Kal Sep\" of \"Otto Liupoldi marchionis Austrie fil, Frisingensis eps\" .\n\n7. KONRAD (1116-Admont 28 Sep 1168, bur Admont).

The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"XIII Kal Jun\" of \"Elizabet filia marchionis\" . m (1142) as his first wife, HERMANN [II] Graf von Winzenburg, son of HERMANN [I] Graf von Windberg, Ratelberg und Winzenburg, Markgraf von Sachsen [Formbach] & his second wife Hedwig --- (-murdered Winzenburg 29 Jan 1152).\n\n9. JUDITH (-after 1178) . The wife of Marchese Guglielmo is recorded by William of Tyre as sister of Konrad III King of Germany . The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis names \"Iuta\" as fifth daughter of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\" and \"Agnetem imperatoris Heinrici IV filiam\", specifying that she married \"marchio de monte Phetran Regengerus\" , although this appears chronologically impossible and should presumably refer to Marchese Guglielmo. The Cronica Alberti de Bezanis refers to the wife of \"Gulielmus marchio Montisferati\" as \"sororem domini Conradi regis Romanorum et domini Frederici ducis Suevorum\" . \"Guilelmus marchio filius quondam Rainerii marchionis et Julita jugalis filia quondam marchionis Leopoldi de Austria\" donated property to the monastery of Grassano by charter dated [15/16] Mar 1156 . m (before 28 Mar 1133) GUGLIELMO di Monferrato, son of RANIERI III Marchese di Monferrato & his wife Gisèle de Bourgogne-Comté (1110-1191).

The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis names \"Ensto\" as fourth son of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\" and \"Agnetem imperatoris Heinrici IV filiam\", specifying that he was buried \"apud Sancto Crucem\" . His description as \"fourth son\" is inconsistent with his estimated birth date, calculated from the age specified in the entry for his death in the necrology of Heiligenkreuz (see below), which is consistent with his being described as \"adolescent\" when he died. The necrology of Melk records the death \"X Kal Feb\" of \"Ernust fil Liupaldi marchionis\" .

Wegener states that Uta, wife of Graf Liutold [I], was the daughter of Leopold III Markgraf of Austria, basing this on the transmission of the names Liutpold and Berta into the family of the Grafen von Plain. It is, however, inconsistent with the Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis stating that Markgraf Leopold and his second wife had five daughters . m [as his second wife,] LIUTOLD Graf von Plain, son of WERIGAND Graf von Plain & his wife --- (-22/23 Jan 1164).

Considering the number of children attributed to Agnes by her first husband, it is unlikely that this number can be correct as it would mean that she had approaching thirty children altogether.]\n\nB. DUKES of AUSTRIA 1156-1246 (BABENBERG)\n\nHEINRICH von Babenberg, son of LEOPOLD III \"der Heilige\" Markgraf of Austria & his second wife Agnes of Germany [Staufen] (-Vienna 13 Jan 1177, bur Vienna Schottenkloster) . The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis names \"Heinricus\" as second son of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\" and \"Agnetem imperatoris Heinrici IV filiam\" . The Continuatio states that Heinrich was older than his brother Leopold, although if this is correct it is unclear why Leopold not Heinrich should have succeeded first as Markgraf. \" Heinricus marchionis Luibaldi filius \" witnessed the charter dated 1132, after 13 Sep, under which Adalbert Archbishop of Mainz donated property \"in pago Weitereibia in comitatu Sigefridi comitis de Nuringes\" to Mainz cathedral . He was appointed HEINRICH Pfalzgraf von Lothringen in 1140 to replace Otto von Salm Graf von Reineck. He resigned as Pfalzgraf in 1141 when he succeeded his brother in 1141 as HEINRICH II \"Jasomirgott\" Markgraf of Austria. His uterine half-brother Konrad III King of Germany installed him as HEINRICH XI Duke of Bavaria in 1143, after retaining the duchy in his own hands for more than a year after Heinrich's death . After Duke Heinrich's first wife died, the Welf family renewed its claim to the duchy of Bavaria. Markgraf Heinrich was a candidate for the imperial throne in 1152. He founded Schottenkloster at Vienna in 1155: the Auctarium Sancrucense specify that he was the founder of \"Scotorum\" . He was deprived of Bavaria in 1156 by Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" King of Germany, who granted the duchy to the Welf Duke Heinrich \"der Löwe\" in order to settle the German kings' longstanding dispute with the Welf family . By way of compensation, Heinrich II was invested, jointly with his wife, at Regensburg 8 Sep 1156 with the march of Austria which was elevated to the status of duchy, Heinrich thereby becoming Duke of Austria .

Niketas Choniates names \"Alexius, Andronicus et Isaacius\" as the three brothers of Emperor Manuel, stating that Andronikos left daughters \"Mariam, Theodoram et Eudociam\" . The Annales Mellicenses in 1149 record the marriage of \"dux Heinricus, filius Liupaldi marchionis\" and \"filiam fratris regis Grecorum Theodora\" . It is likely that Theodora, daughter of Andronikos, married Markgraf Heinrich as Andronikos's brother Isaakios is recorded with a daughter named Theodora and his brother Alexios is only recorded as having one child. The marriage was arranged by Konrad III King of Germany, her husband's half-brother, while he was staying with Emperor Manuel I recuperating from ill-health. The marriage took place during a second visit after King Konrad had left Palestine and was on his way home to Germany . She was invested jointly with her husband with the march of Austria in 1156 .

Rüdt-Collenberg speculates that she was \"Beatrice domicella\" who received a substantial bequest under the will of Joan of England, dowager Queen of Sicily, Ctss de Toulouse, with whom \"la Damsel de Chypre\" spent many years. This betrothal was agreed as part of the terms for the release of Richard I King of England from the custody of Emperor Heinrich VI King of Germany in Feb 1194, along with that of his older brother to Eléonore de Bretagne, the object being that Leopold should subsequently found a new dynasty of Kings of Cyprus with the heir to the island .

The Annales Mellicenses record the marriage in 1203 of \"Liupoldus dux Austriæ et Styriæ\" and \"Theodoram filiam regis Grecorum\" , although given her absence from Byzantine sources it appears unlikely that Theodora was the daughter of an emperor. The Continuatio Admuntensis states that she was \"Constantinopolitani imperatoris ex filia neptem\", specifying that her marriage was celebrated in Vienna . If interpreted literally, that source would indicate that Theodora was the daughter of an emperors daughter. The name of the emperor in question is not specified. If Theodora was a member of the Angelos family, from a chronological point of view her grandfather could have been Emperor Alexios III if she had been born in the last part of the date range estimated above. However, medieval western sources were often imprecise in describing family relationships within the Byzantine imperial families. It is possible therefore that Theodora was more remotely related to the imperial family, or even that she belonged to the Komnenos or Dukas imperial families as suggested in the document BYZANTIUM 1057-1204. Theodora is shown as the possible daughter of Ioannes Angelos in Europäische Stammtafeln , but the basis for this speculation has not been ascertained. She became a nun at Kahlenberg.

Duke of Austria, by right of his wife, 1251-1252.\n\n5. FRIEDRICH ([1210]-killed in battle an der Leitha 15 Jun 1246, bur Heiligenkreuz) . The Annales Mellicenses names \"Fridericus filius Liuopoldi ducis\" when recording his marriage . He succeeded his father in 1230 as FRIEDRICH II \"der Streitbare\" Duke of Austria and Styria. Lord of Carniola 1232. His policy of territorial expansion triggered a mass of complaints against him at the imperial diets. Emperor Friedrich II was forced to act when Wenzel of Bohemia and others expressed reluctance, in light of Duke Friedrich's hostility, to divert troops from domestic protection for an imperial expedition against the Lombards . The emperor imposed an imperial ban on Duke Friedrich in Jun 1236, troops from neighbouring territories intervened to execute the order and the duke was forced to flee Vienna for Neustadt . Duke Friedrich defeated the opposition at Steinfeld, and the emperor was forced to intervene and occupy Vienna where he installed Ecbert Bishop of Bamberg as imperial regent and proclaimed the annexation of Austria and Styria to the empire . This move, unpopular with the original complainants, impelled King Wenzel to negotiate an alliance with Duke Friedrich, in opposition to the emperor, under which Austria transferred territories north of the Danube to Bohemia . The emperor was obliged to lift the ban in 1237 . The Auctarium Sancrucense records that \"Fredericus dux Austrie et Stirie\" was killed in battle \"XVI Kal Iul 1246\" and buried in \"Sancte Crucis\" . After the death of Duke Friedrich, Austria escheated to the emperor, although a general uprising against the imperial procurator, Otto von Eberstein, diminished the value of this acquisition . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"XVII Kal Jul 1246\" of \"Fridericus dux Austrie Stirie\" . The necrology of Heiligenkreuz records the death \"XVII Kal Jul\" of \"Fridericus secundus cognomento Bellicosus abnepos s Leopoldi fundatoris\" and his burial \"in capitulo monasterii no\", specifying that he was fifth Duke of Austria and last of the line . Betrothed (1226, contract broken 1229) to [EVDOKIA] Laskarina, daughter of THEODOROS I Emperor in Nikaia & his first wife Anna Angelina ([1210/12]-[1247/53]). The Annales Sancti Rudberti Salisburgenses record that iunior filius ducis (following the sentence recording the dispute between Liupoldum ducem Austrie et filium suum maiorem) married sororem regine Ungarie in 1226 . This presumably refers to Maria Laskarina, who was not queen at the time of the event but had become queen by the time the document was probably written. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines records that \"dux Austrie\" married one of the daughters (mentioned second) of \"Lascarum Grecum\" and that the fourth daughter married \"Anselmus de Kiev, de Pontivo natus\" . None of the Greek sources, presumably compiled with more accurate local knowledge than the western European sources, records that Emperor Theodoros Lascaris had four daughters. If the emperor only had three daughters, the daughter who was betrothed to Friedrich of Austria was Evdokia. No evidence has been found pointing to the bride of Friedrich of Austria being Theodoross daughter by his second or third marriages. The following sources indicate that the marriage arrangement was terminated. The Continuatio Prædictorum Vindobonensium records in 1229 that dux Fridericus Austrie repudiated his wife neptem regis Ungarie with the consent of patre suo Leupoldo and later married filiam ducis Meranie . The Continuatio Scotorum records in 1230 that dux Fridericus married filiam ducis Merannie after repudiating sororis regine Ungarie . It is difficult to assess from all these sources whether the marriage actually took place or whether the arrangement remained at the betrothal stage. Presumably there would be some evidence of Papal intervention in the primary sources concerning the divorce if the couple had been married. m (1229, divorced 1240) as her first husband, AGNES von Andechs-Merano, daughter of OTTO I Duke of Merano, Comte Palatin de Bourgogne [Andechs] & his first wife Beatrix de Bourgogne-Comté (-[1 Nov 1260/7 Jan 1263], bur Sittich).

King Richard appointed Otakar as protector of the royal domains east of the Rhine 7 Jan 1267 . He succeeded in 1269 as OTAKAR Duke of Carinthia. In 1274, King Otakar ignored demands for the return to imperial jurisdiction of the duchies of Austria, Carinthia and Styria, made in line with the policy of Rudolf I King of Germany which was promulgated at the Diet of Nürnburg 19 Nov 1274 and under which all properties unlawfully appropriated since the deposition of Emperor Friedrich II in 1245 were to be returned to the empire. In accordance with the procedures established, the duchies were deemed forfeited after a year and a day . King Rudolf declared war on Bohemia, and King Otakar was obliged to abdicate under the temporary peace of 21 Nov 1276, confirmed by treaty 6 May 1277. Rudolf's position was confirmed definitively after he defeated King Otakar at the battle of Marchfeld near Dürnkrut 26 Aug 1278.\n\nChapter 4.

The Ellenhardi Chronicon names \"Ruodolfus rex Romanorum\" as son of \"Alberti comitis in Habichburg lantgravius Alsatie superioris\" . The Chronicon Colmarense records the birth \"1218 Kal Mai\" of \"comes Rudolfus de Habisburch\", specifying that he was \"de progenie ducis Zeringie\" . He succeeded his father in 1240 as Graf von Habsburg, Landgraf von Thurgau, at which time the familys territories extended from the left bank of the Rhine at Lake Constance to the Vosges.

He was elected RUDOLF I King of Germany 1 Oct 1273 at Frankfurt-am-Main, with the support especially of Werner von Eppenstein Archbishop of Mainz and of Friedrich Burggraf von Nürnberg, defeating the rival candidate Přemysl Otakar II King of Bohemia and Duke of Austria. He was crowned at Aachen 24 Oct 1273. King Rudolf immediately implemented the policy of return to the empire of all properties unlawfully appropriated since the deposition of Emperor Friedrich II in 1245, promulgated at the Diet of Nürnburg 19 Nov 1274 . This included the return of the duchies of Austria and Styria from Přemysl Otakar II King of Bohemia, against whom Rudolf declared war.

Rudolf became Duke of Austria and Steiermark (Styria) after King Otakars abdication under the temporary peace of 21 Nov 1276, confirmed by treaty 6 May 1277. Rudolf's position was confirmed definitively after he defeated King Otakar at the battle of Marchfeld near Dürnkrut 26 Aug 1278. Duke Rudolf abdicated in Austria and Styria in favour of his sons Albrecht I and Rudolf II in Dec 1282. Negotiations were underway with Pope Gregory X for Rudolfs coronation as emperor 2 Feb 1276, but these were suspended by the Popes death 10 Jan 1276. The premature deaths of the three succeeding Popes prevented finalisation of the negotiations, although Rudolf renounced all claims over the Romagna 14 Feb 1279 as part of the deal proposed with Pope Nicolas III. Pope Honorius IV set 2 Feb 1287 for the ceremony but Rudolf postponed the date as he was unable to arrive in Rome in time. German/Papal rivalry over the extent of the papal powers over the German clergy resulted in further postponements. King Rudolf died during the papacy of Nicolas IV without the coronation ever having taken place. The necrology of Königsfelden records the death \"Id Jul 1290\" of \"dominus Ruod Romanorum rex\" . The Gesta Alberti Regis, ducis Austriæ records that King Rudolf was buried at Speyer .\n\nm firstly (1243 or 1245) GERTRUD [Anna] von Hohenberg, daughter of BURCHARD V Graf von Hohenberg [Zollern] & his wife Mechtild von Tübingen ([1230/35]-Vienna 16 Feb 1281, bur Basel Münster).

The Annales Sancti Udalrici et Afræ Augustenses name \"Anna uxor domini Rudolfi regis de Hapsburg\" as sister of \"comitem de Heigerloch\" . Heiress of Schlettstadt in Alsace. A charter dated 19 Oct 1275 confirmed the consecration of the church of Lausanne, recording as present \"Rodulfo Rege Alemaniæ regina Anna uxor dicti Regis cum liberis eorundem Alberto, Hartmanno, Rodulfo et Samsone cum aliis quatuor filiabus dicti regis\" . The Ratisponensis Annales record the death in 1281 of \"uxor Rudolfi Romanorum regis Anna\" . The Annales Hospitalis Argentinenses record the death in 1281 of \"regina uxor Rudolfi regis\" in Bohemia and her burial \"in Basilea\" . The Annales Sindelfingenses record the death \"1281 in vigilia Matthiæ\" of \"regina uxor Rudolfi regis in Wina\" and her burial \"in Basilea\" .

Dame de Vieux-Château et d´Aigney-le Duc by grant 20 Nov 1294 . According to Du Chesne, Isabelle married Pierre de Chambly le jeune seigneur de Chambly . This statement is proved incorrect by a document dated May 1321 which records that Pierre de Chambli seigneur de Neaufle fils de Pierre seigneur de Chambli had married Isabeau fille de Jean de Bourgogne fils de Hugues de Vienne et d´Alis de Méranie comtesse palatine de Bourgogne and that Isabelle sur de Henri de Bourgogne fils du susdit Jean was present when the latter reached agreement with Jeanne Queen of France regarding le château de Montrond près de Besançon .\n\nMistress (1): ITA, daughter of --- (-before 1287).

The primary source which confirms her name has not yet been identified. Her marriage was arranged after her future father-in-law swore allegiance to her father in 1276, with a dowry of 40,000 marks. The support of Lower Bavaria was decisive in Rudolf Is struggle with Otakar Přemysl II King of Bohemia over Austria. The alliance broke down shortly after the marriage took place, the dowry being underpaid by 3,000 marks . The necrology of Seligenthal records the death \"II Non Apr\" of \"Katharina filia regis Romanorum\" . m (Betrothed 1276, Vienna Jan 1279) as his first wife, OTTO von Bayern-Niederbayern, son of HEINRICH I Duke of Lower Bavaria & his wife Erszébet of Hungary (11 Feb 1261-Landshut 9 Sep 1312, bur Seligenthal).

Her marriage was arranged to secure her future father-in-laws support for her fathers election as King of Germany. Agnes...Alberti quondam ducis Saxonie relicta nec non Rudolfus...dux et comes in Bren confirmed a purchase by the citizens of Wittenberg by charter dated Jun 1301 .
