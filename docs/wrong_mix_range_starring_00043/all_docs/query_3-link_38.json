        "text": "“It came for the thrill of the hunt…It picked the wrong man to hunt”\n\nOne of the best films of the 1980’s and certainly one of Schwarzenegger’s finest roles, “Predator“ is a film I’ve seen more times than I care to remember. Directed by John McTiernan, who would go on to helm “Die Hard” the following year (arguably the greatest action movie ever made), the film is an excellent mix of gung-ho action and sci-fi horror with a truly iconic monster (designed by Stan Winston). The rare and original UK quad film poster offered here is from first year of release 1987 and was created by a team at the FEREF design agency, including Stephen Laws, Frank Hillary and acclaimed movie poster artist Brian Bysouth. This was one of the first film posters by the artist to have been created with photo composition and not painted, as had been the case with his previous posters. This ‘thermal imaging’ version has a great action image of Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and is considered a classic amongst collectors of the genre. Originally folded (as issued – the fold lines are soft from being stored flat for a number of years) this beautiful unrestored example displays and presents to excellent effect. Sought after and extremely hard to find in this high grade condition it represents a fine piece of collectable original movie memorabilia.\n\nTrivia: The mandibles of the Predator were the idea of James Cameron.\n\n…more detail\n\n“It came for the thrill of the hunt…It picked the wrong man to hunt !”\n\nOne of the best films of the 1980’s and certainly one of Schwarzenegger’s finest roles, “Predator“ is a film I’ve seen more times than I care to remember.
