        "text": "Democrips and Rebloodlicans: No More Gangs in Government\n\nJesse Ventura with Dick Russell, read by Johnny Heller. Tantor Media, unabridged, eight CDs, 9 hrs., $34.99 ISBN 978-1-4526-0541-8\n\nIn his latest, former Minnesota governor and professional wrestler Ventura explains what’s wrong with American government—describing, the ways corporations have bought and sold the electoral and legislative processes and detailing the ganglike mentality and practices of the two major political parties—and lays out the ways citizens might take their country back. In this audio edition, narrator Johnny Heller turns in a compelling performance that will both inform and entertain listeners. Heller wisely doesn’t attempt to impersonate Ventura, instead providing crisp, well-paced narration that perfectly captures the author’s gruff, no-nonsense attitude and straight-shooting personality. Additionally, Heller’s reading presents the book’s theories, facts, and historical examples in a clear fashion that will keep listeners engaged until the very end. A Skyhorse hardcover.
