        "text": "In trying times, humans have a tendency to look backwards. No, not literally looking backwards, since that is weird, but metaphorically. Nostalgia soothes and placates a restless soul. Needless to say — but I’m saying it anyway — our souls more than a little edgy after the last two years. This is the environment David Weiner releases his latest film, In Search of Tomorrow: The Definitive ’80s Sci-Fi Documentary. If you’re familiar with his In Search of Darkness series — and you should be because, c’mon — then you know what you’re getting with this sci-fi flavor.\n\nFor anyone new to this series, In Search of Tomorrow… examines the decade, leaving only a few stones unturned while highlighting more than the usual suspect lineup of flicks. Yes, the guests discuss Blade Runner, Escape from New York, Aliens, Back to the Future, and Robocop. But the desire to go to the lesser known or seldom spoken about corners of Sci-Fi movie geekdom is what makes this documentary special. In Search of Tomorrow: The Definitive ’80s Sci-Fi Documentary is entertaining and educational without sacrificing either quality."
