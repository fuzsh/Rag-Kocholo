        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger was already established as an action star when the science fiction film Predator was released in 1987. Having already worked in blockbuster movies like Terminator and Commando, even his wife was accustomed to seeing him in action-packed features. Therefore, the John McTiernan-led film was no surprise for his now ex-wife, Maria Shriver.\n\nIn a recently resurfaced interview, the actor recalled an incident from the past. While expressing Shriver’s love for action movies, he revealed that his co-star, Jesse Ventura’s wife, had a different experience after she finds out that Jesse dies in the film.\n\nJesse Ventura’s wife was not impressed by the movie’s plot\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAs per the resurfaced interview from 2013, the 75-year-old appeared to discuss his film and how his wife was fond of his acting and the action genre in general. He claimed that Maria had a good knowledge of films and viewed Arnie’s films with an unbiased lens rather than fretting over his death in the movies.\n\n“She likes action movies… and maybe she likes them because when I’m in it she likes it. But she always enjoys the films and always takes her friends to see the films and she’s a real big fan of mine,” the Hollywood star revealed. His co-actor, Ventura, played the part of Blain Cooper, who gets killed by the alien creature, which, as per Arnie’s revelations, did not sit well with his then-wife, Theresa Masters.\n\nRead More: “Came Across as Ridiculous”: Arnold Schwarzenegger Revealed Creator’s Big Mistake in Order to Save $1.5 Million on Predator’s Shoot\n\nThe 6’2 actor revealed, “Now Jessie Ventura, his wife, went to see the film, and when he got killed in the film, she started crying, so it has different effects on people.” Eventually, he couldn’t even let his children see the R-rated movie because of the plot twist, given that they were kids and would not like watching their father get killed. Similarly, the movie sits as a pool of memories for the star, as he once narrated his experience in a different light.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger had a miserable time while filming Predator\n\nIn his autobiography, Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story, the Austrian star confessed to having the worst time while shooting Predator. He explained the drastic scenario in which they had to film. “There were all the hardships you’d expect in a jungle: leeches, sucking mud, poisonous snakes, and stifling humidity and heat,” he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nArnie marked it as an ordeal rather than a pleasure, and yet that was not the climax of his dilemma. He felt that the creature portrayed as the predator was “phony” and questionable. This happened due to a budget issue since the director could not afford high-quality visual effects. Tiernan instead went for an option that was half the price of the advanced one, thus resulting in a poor creation of the antagonist.\n\nWATCH THIS STORY- Every Time Arnold Schwarzenegger Took Over WWE\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nSchwarzenegger was fortunate to have found Shriver as his partner, as she encouraged all types of roles he chose to play. She stuck through all the ups and downs of his journey while also pursuing her passion for journalism."
