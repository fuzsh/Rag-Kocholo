Breaking down the most popular and eccentric Sci-Fi titles of the ‘80s (theatrical and video store releases, from the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises to RoboCop, Aliens, The Road Warrior, MegaForce, Back to the Future and Buckaroo Banzai), In Search of Tomorrow examines compelling insider tales of the creative process; the resonating themes of these imaginative stories; the technology behind the fiction, and their futuristic forecasts; the bold marketing of these films; and the political and Cold-War climate that impacted our entertainment.\n\n‘In Search of Tomorrow’ features stunning insights and entertaining anecdotes from more than 70 exclusive interviews, comprised of legendary actors, directors, producers, writers, visual and special-effects masters, composers, production craftspersons, film critics, and authors, alongside notable experts including a futurist, a clinical psychologist, and an astrophysicist. Interview talent includes Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Spacehunter), Billy Dee Williams (The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi), Peter Weller (RoboCop, Buckaroo Banzai), Dee Wallace (E.T.), Nancy Allen (RoboCop), Paul Verhoeven (RoboCop), Bruce Boxleitner (TRON), John Carpenter (Escape From New York, The Thing), Walter Koenig (Star Trek), Nicholas Meyer (Star Trek), Wil Wheaton (Star Trek), Adam Nimoy (Star Trek), Jesse Ventura (Predator, The Running Man), Joe Dante (Explorers, Innerspace), Bob Gale (Back to the Future), Gene Simmons (Runaway), Kurtwood Smith (RoboCop), Carrie Henn (Aliens), Joey Cramer (Flight of the Navigator), Alex Winter (Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure), Sean Young (Blade Runner, DUNE), Sam J. Jones (Flash Gordon), John Dykstra (Star Wars), Phil Tippett (Star Wars trilogy, RoboCop), Dennis Muren (ILM), Lance Guest (The Last Starfighter), Julie Brown (Earth Girls Are Easy), Vernon Wells (The Road Warrior, Innerspace), Clancy Brown (Buckaroo Banzai), and Sarah Douglas (Superman II).\n\nA rousing celebration of ‘80s genre filmmaking at its zenith, In Search of Tomorrow taps into that childlike wonder that we all felt watching these movies, while deconstructing and recontextualizing their impact for today’s audiences.\n\nTo pre-order In Search of Tomorrow through March 27th, visit www.80sscifidoc.com. Package includes choice of Blu-ray or DVD plus slipcover, digital download of the film, three exclusive In Search of Tomorrow posters, sticker pack, and a credit in the film.\n\nFrom In Search of Tomorrow writer/director David Weiner: “Grand stories of the imagination have always taken center stage in my life. As a teen in the ‘80s, I was at the perfect age to get lost in the big-budget blockbusters and straight-to-video fare that shaped perceptions and inspired creativity like no other. In Search of Tomorrow is an ambitious, nostalgic journey worthy of the amazing content and creators that came out of ‘80s Sci-Fi cinema. To craft a five-hour documentary/love letter devoted to territory that’s so close to my heart is the ultimate treat. An entertaining ride that mines never-before-heard tales from the creative minds who drove this influential decade of filmmaking, In Search of Tomorrow is a celebration of human challenge and potential, recontextualizing the films that not only were important to all of us, but changed our lives.”"
