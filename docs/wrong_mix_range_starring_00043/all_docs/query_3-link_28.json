        "text": "February 13, 2015\n\nMy brother recommended this to me, and it sounded interesting. I ended up reading the whole book in two sittings. It was a real page turner.\n\nFor a book that promises to talk about reworking politics from the bottom up, this book actually has little to say about politics in general. The majority of the book is about Jesse Ventura's life, only some of which I knew (I was never a wrestling fan; I knew of him from his film work). Yet the story of his life is never boring. He's led a very interesting life, and his views on politics and this country are almost 100% in line with how I think; in fact, the only parts I disagreed with were presented in such a way that I've started to rethink my stance on those issues. Mr. Ventura makes a lot of sense. He's one of those rare no-BS types of people, which we all know is even more rare when referring to a politician.\n\nThe most interesting bits of info in this book are outdated, since this was published in 1999, yet I found it fascinating to compare his predictions and wishes and hopes to what actually happened. If anything, we as a country have gotten even worse. He says often that he has no desire to run for the Presidency... yet I'm sure I and many others who read this book would flock to the polls to support him if he ever should. In the meantime, finishing this book made me want to track down his other books and read those as well.\n\nJuly 13, 2021\n\nTo say Jesse Ventura has led an interesting life would be an understatement. Navy SEAL. Professional wrestler. Actor. Mayor. Governor. Author. Television host. Few people have reinvented themselves more than Ventura has. Jesse Ventura celebrates his 70th Birthday this week (July 15th). To mark the occasion, the Literary Squared Circle blog reviews Ventura’s first book, I Ain’t Got Time to Bleed: Reworking the Body Politic from the Bottom Up (Villard, 1999).\n\nI Ain’t Got Time to Bleed is not a wrestling book per se. Each chapter addresses a different chapter in Ventura’s life. His professional wrestling career is included, but it is not the focal point of the book. The book begins and ends with Ventura’s 1998 gubernatorial run in his home state of Minnesota, in which he upset the proverbial applecart and “shocked the world” by winning the election.\n\nWhen the book was released in 1999, Ventura was clearly trying to leave his Jesse “The Body” persona behind. He was now a politician, and he had become Jesse “The Mind” Ventura. Though his wrestling career is discussed, Ventura largely downplays that aspect of his life. He briefly covers topics such as his training with Eddie Sharkey, the creation of his “Body” gimmick, and how he based the character on the mannerisms of Superstar Billy Graham. Ventura describes breaking into the wrestling business for Bob Geigel in the Kansas City territory, and tells a few wild stories about the early days of his career. Unfortunately, his time in the American Wrestling Association is glossed over, but his memorable run in the World Wrestling Federation is discussed more in-depth.\n\nWhile in the WWF, Ventura’s actions seemed to foretell his future in politics. He was the first wrestler to have an agent to negotiate his contracts. He was also protective of his likeness, and was the first to broach the issue of videotape royalties and compensation . Perhaps the most politically divisive issue he raised was when he proposed unionizing professional wrestling. Ventura claims that it was Hulk Hogan (someone he considered to be a friend) who reported Ventura’s proposed union to Vince McMahon, who quickly put the kibosh on the idea.\n\nVentura does not shy away from any issue. He admits to steroid use, but states that when he discovered the negative health effects they caused, he changed his stance. He went as far as to participate in campaign aimed at keep young people away from performance enhancing drugs. Whether his later health issues were related to his steroid use or not, Ventura describes the life-threatening blood clots in his lungs which ended his in-ring career.\n\nThough he could no longer wrestle, Ventura successfully transitioned to the broadcast booth, where he pioneered the idea of being a heel commentator. During his time as a commentator, Ventura also began taking on film roles. In fact, the title of his book, I Ain’t Got Time to Bleed, is his iconic line from the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger action film, Predator, in which Ventura co-starred.\n\nJesse Ventura’s wrestling career is covered in two chapters, or approximately fifty pages. The vast majority of the book, however, is about politics. He recounts what prompted him run for office, first as mayor of his hometown, and later as Governor of Minnesota. Ventura shares his political platform, which includes: taxes, education, government reform, social issues, you name it.\n\nAs a wrestling fan, I would have enjoyed more wrestling stories, especially about his time in the AWA. Though Ventura has written numerous books over the past twenty plus years, he has not written a book dedicated to his time as a wrestler. However, for what it is, I Ain’t Got Time to Bleed, is a quick and interesting read. Ventura shoots from the hip. He is opinionated, and honest, which must have come as a breath of fresh air for voters in Minnesota in 1998. Early on in the book, Ventura describes himself in the following way, “I am not a career politician. I am not a Democrat. I am not a Republican. I am a working man with commonsense ideas and goals. I describe myself politically as fiscally conservative and socially moderate-to-liberal.”\n\nFor those expecting a traditional wrestler autobiography, I Ain’t Got Time to Bleed: Reworking the Body Politic from the Bottom Up will undoubtedly be a disappointment. However, if you are looking to read a compelling life story about someone who marches to the beat of their own drum, you will likely enjoy this book. The story of James George Janos begins in 1950s Minnesota and concludes with him serving as Governor of the state in 1999. Along the way he became known in the ring and on the big screen as Jesse “The Body” Ventura. Ventura’s journey is both a unique and fascinating one.\n\n4 Stars out of 5\n\nNovember 18, 2022\n\nI was gifted this nightmare because I was able to guess the title when told that Jesse Ventura had “written” an autobiography. Every page was a chaotic tangle of personal grievance and self congratulatory nonsense that assaulted the very foundations of my mind.\n\nThat aside I have three important observations:\n\n1. SO MANY EXCLAMATION POINTS\n\n2. This shit was very obviously written by Ventura’s agent, Barry Bloom. How do I know that this book was written by Barry Bloom you might ask? Well I know that it was written by Barry Bloom because Barry Bloom’s name is on every other fucking page.\n\n3. This is a very pointed snapshot of the faux-edgy, pseudo-intellectual mindset of many American men in the late 1990s. Myself included, I’m afraid. Cartoonish tough guy braggadocio with anti-authority rebelliousness mixed with personal entitlement and an unwavering belief that “fiscally conservative, socially liberal” was some sort of intellectual checkmate in the world of politics. Ugh.\n\nAnyway, this was trash but I would still very much enjoy hanging out with the cast of Predator so if any of you can make that happen please let me know.\n\nMarch 6, 2022\n\n5.00 out of 5.00\n\nWow. What a book.\n\nI was gifted this book by a friend of mine one random day and, even loving wrestling, I never knew much about Jesse Ventura. Reading his entire story was inspirational and informative.\n\nHis views on politics were things that I mostly agreed with. His views about wrestling were pretty spot on. He, as a person, is very outspoken but very intelligent.\n\nThis book gave me a lot of hope; seeing someone who has achieved so much in life gives me the inspiration to achieve every goal I have. It brings me hope that maybe hope isn’t lost, in government or in life.\n\nA spectacular, page-turning read that had me cheering and on the edge of my seat.\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nInteresting story. I'm not on board with everything Ventura says or believes, ie his undying support for BLM (libertarian supporting Marxists??? Seriously?) or the time he called America fascist for it's stance on businesses and religion (I'm all for normalizing atheism, but we have a lot more rights here than most nations. Bit of a stretch). But his story is still fascinating and entertaining. Not gonna lie, I'm a bit jealous of a few things but I always wonder how much of these autobiographies are ever accurate.\n\nJanuary 14, 2024\n\nI only got the book for its title as it's from one of my favourite films (not quite 4 star book but close!)\n\nI'm not interested in politics (or biographies!) but this was a very easy read, and seems like a very honest account of his life prior to entering politics (he briefly mentions the WWF problems too for any wrestling fans).\n\nIt's got some great philosophy to live by, and I can see why he was a favourite candidate of many - recommend if you need a different genre of book!\n\nNovember 22, 2017\n\nForgot I read this book quite some time ago. It was a OK read which helped me understand Ventura better.\n\nApril 14, 2021\n\nHe is a very interesting person. He speaks his mind and that is rare in politics. I don’t agree with everything he does but I would still vote for him if he ran. Excellent book.\n\nApril 23, 2022\n\nSome parts were interesting, and reading his political views was too. The first time around. Then it started to seem just like repetitive rhetoric.\n\nApril 7, 2008\n\nJesse has a way with words that make him very easy to understand. His no-nonsense style breaks down the issues we hear about all day long on the news into terms that the average working american can understand, and I love reading his books.\n\nFor example, his idea of gun control is \"being able to put 5 rounds in the same spot from 50 meters\".\n\nWhether you agree with his views or not you will find he makes sense and at least you won't get any BS politically correct crap from him. He tells you how he feels and why he feels it and his honesty is refreshing.\n\nWould I vote for him should he decide to run for President? I honestly don't know. But I think if he ran it would do wonders for trying to break up the two party dictatorship that currently has a stranglehold on our nation.\n\nEVERYONE should go down to their library and check out this book. It is a short, easy read that you could probably get through in an afternoon and it would vastly change your view on our nations corrupt government and open your eyes to the reality of what our nation has become.\n\nRUN JESSE RUN!\n\nSeptember 6, 2008\n\nThe title of Jesse Ventura's memoir is taken from his famous line he delivered in the movie Predator. It is a great mantra for a former Navy SEAL, pro-wrestler, and man-of-the-people elected official. Once you get through the first chapter that explains Ventura's views on the issues of the day, the rest is an absorbing, humorous, truthful, and motivating memoir of a true tough guy who can put his money where his mouth is.\n\nJesse tells all in this memoir. When he was a young man, he worked hard, and played hard. Drinking and sex are included here. My eyebrows went up a few times. It is clear he is not covering anything up in order to look squeaky clean.\n\nAnyone who reads this book will wish there were a million more Jesses holding political office, instead of the Democrat/Republican factory of career politicians who are addicted to power. I never seriously considered the validity or need for a third political party until I read this book.\n\nJune 1, 2015\n\nThis is the second time I have read this book. I liked Ventura when he was a wrestler/announcer and found his story interesting when he got into politics. Regardless of what some may think of his political views, this book is a good read about a man who went from wrestling and acting to politics. The book discusses his time as a Navy SEAL, why he dislikes Hulk Hogan, and how he ran for mayor basically after a dare when he told the local council at a meeting not to make him run for office.\n\nSome may not like his other books, but this is almost like a biography with only a few political rants in it. There is not much wrestling stories in it, only a chapter or two, if you are wanting to just read wrestling stories. This is a book, however, that inspires people to follow a dream and make it successful.\n\nJuly 3, 2014\n\nIt's not a bad book, and it covers the basics of Ventura's life to that point, but it's a rushjob clearly intended to help further the Body's nascent political ambitions (his political platform is somewhat schizophrenic, but his support for public schools and term limits is admirable). If so, the details included are surprising: Ventura's frankness about his own earthy existence likely torpedoed his chances at higher office, which makes me think the actual story is even more entertaining than what's in here. According to most WCW'ers who worked for the promotion during Ventura's time there, the Body's road stories and Verne Gagne impressions were worth the exorbitant salary he was being paid. What a bizarre, only-in-America sort of character.\n\nDecember 24, 2011\n\nI am proud to say I lived in MN when he ran to be the 38th Governor of Minnesota, and I voted for him! Just like in his wrestling career, if Jesse has something to say he has no filter. He is one of the only politician's that said he was for what was right for the people of his state, and he backed it up. In his first term, he knew that the \"Good Ol Boys\" was ripping Minnesotans off, so he gave thousands of dollars back\n\nIf you like a hard hitting, no nonsense, straight to the point book. Then this book is for you. He also has some views on taxes and other things that if the government would have listened, we would have a better America!!\n\nWant to read\n\nApril 7, 2008\n\nI liked what he had to say on Larry King the other night, and the current presidential campaign has made me more of a political junkie than I've ever been before in my life, so I just may have to check this book out. And to balance what Mr. Ventura has to say perhaps I'll also read something I'm likely to completely disagree with, like Amy Coulter's Godless for example, because I believe in thoroughly hearing out everyone's point of view before definitively declaring who is brilliant and who is an idiot. I'd even read a future autobiography by W if he is able to write.\n\nApril 29, 2012\n\nI saw one of his new books on the shelf at the store but instead of picking that one up I wanted to read them in somewhat order since all his biographies are chronological. This book covers birth up until election of governorship of Minnesota. Good basic biography I liked reading about the variety of careers he has had. I like his no holds barred (bad pun overused with him) political ideas. I would agree the government needs revising and some of his ideas are spot on what needs done. It's took bad many can't look past his background and see him for the good political ideas he has.\n\nApril 17, 2008\n\nI got this book at a poor people place years ago... I was curious about the guy for whom I put a bumper sticker on my car that read, \"My govenor can beat up your govenor.\" I'm not sure that I'm going to make it through it though. Just not my gig so far.\n\nHmmmmm... I gave it a try and now I'm giving up. Should I have put it in my 'read' list? Maybe it's not the right time, maybe I'm just sick and tired of political talk right now or maybe the book just sucked. Regardless, I'm giving up.\n\nFebruary 4, 2012\n\nThis was a great book. It gave me so much insight into who Jesse is and what his politics are. I agree with a lot of what he believes which suprised me. I also good an inside look into his political career and what was happening behind the scenes when he was in the WWF which i never followed before. It is definately a must read.\n\nJanuary 29, 2008\n\nI couldn't resist reading it, how random does this get, he has some interesting points but he gets rather egocentric at times, but none-the-less a charming tale of boy who joins the navy becomes a seal, then a wrestler, to radio DJ, to politician\n\nMarch 28, 2008\n\nI discovered a man I didn't know, SEAL, wrestler and in the last chapter, successful mayor and govenor without becoming a politician.\n\nLoved it. recommend it. wish colin powell would run for president too.\n\nFebruary 29, 2016\n\nB Ventura - The story of Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura from Minneapolis boyhood, through time as a Navy Seal, professional wrestler, actor, and radio personality to his election as the Governor of Minnesota as a candidate for the Reform Party.\n\nDecember 27, 2023\n\n🖋️ When I read this, I was also listening to Ventura’s radio show in Minneapolis. The book was mostly what he talked about on the radio, so what is inside this book is not anything new for me.\n\n📖 Book version.\n\n●▬●🔷●🔷●▬●\n\nJune 26, 2007\n\nYeah another book by a wrestler, and this ones about politics. But it is real good. I wish Jesse Ventura was President. He's no joke\n\nDecember 7, 2007\n\nSurprisingly good, and he pulls no punches in his discussion of the American political system, and some of its many, MANY flaws."
