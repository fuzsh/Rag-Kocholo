        "text": "In every arena, Jesse Ventura puts a headlock on the competition--now he's turning the country on its ear. How did an outrageous, outspoken, boa-wearing pro wrestler nab the title of Minnesota's governor in an overwhelming upset? This is the question the nation is asking--and Washington journalist Jake Tapper provides the fascinating answers. From Jesse Ventura's Navy SEAL days to his infamous wrestling years, to his stunning political victory, read the story of the Body, a man who truly embodies the American Dream.\n\nGet the real story on:\n\n-His intense training to become an elite Navy SEAL and his experiences overseas during the Vietnam War\n\n-His lengthy career in the pro wrestling field--from flamboyant pro wrestler to colorful commentator--including his feuds with Hulk Hogan and Vince McMahon Jr.\n\n-Ventura's acting stints, including a part in the film Predator\n\n-How the Body mouthed his way to the top of shock radio\n\n-His rise through the ranks of politics, from the mayor to governor--and maybe beyond\n\n-Ventura's political vision--what he sees for Minnesota and the country\n\n-And Much, much more!\n\nThe body politic will never be the same with 8 pages of amazing photos\n\nJake Tapper is the best-selling author of six books, his most recent being All the Demons Are Here, to be published July 11, 2023 by Little Brown & Co.\n\nOn April 24, 2018, Little, Brown and Company published Tapper's first novel, a political thriller entitled The Hellfire Club. The novel follows a fictitious freshman Congressman discovering corruption and conspiracy in 1950s Washington, at the height of the McCarthy era. The book debuted at Number 3 on the New York Times Best-Seller List for Hardcover fiction, and remained on the Best-Seller list for four weeks total. The Associated Press called The Hellfire Club \"insightful...well-written and worthwhile.\" Tablet Magazine called the novel \"startlingly good.\" USA Today said the author \"sizzles\" and \"proves he has the page-turning knack in his entertaining debut novel.\"\n\nThe sequel to The Hellfire Club, The Devil May Dance, was released in May 2021, and continues the story of the lives of Charlie and Margaret Marder.\n\nTapper is also the author of The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor, a critically acclaimed book about U.S. troops in Afghanistan that debuted at number 10 on The New York Times Best Seller list for hardback non-fiction. Bob Woodward described the book as \"Brilliant, dedicated reporting by a journalist who goes to ground to get the truth. A sad, real tale about this war, America and the brave warriors who live—and die—at the point of the spear\" and Jon Krakauer called it \"a mind-boggling, all-too-true story of heroism, hubris, failed strategy, and heartbreaking sacrifice. If you want to understand how the war in Afghanistan went off the rails, you need to read this book.\"\n\nIn 2014, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society recognized Tapper for the book and his reporting on military topics in general with the Tex McCrary Award for Excellence in Journalism. A Rod Lurie-directed film adaptation of The Outpost was released in July 2020, starring Milo Gibson, Orlando Bloom, Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones.\n\nIn addition to The Outpost, Tapper is the author of Down and Dirty: The Plot to Steal the Presidency, based on the 2000 Presidential election, that The Washington Post called \"lively\", the Chicago Tribune \"a churning effusion well worth reading\" and The Daily Telegraph \"engrossing\". He also wrote Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story (St. Martin's Press) that was excerpted by The Washington Post Magazine."
