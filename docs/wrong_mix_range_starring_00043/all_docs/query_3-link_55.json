        "text": ">> ERIC: THIS WEEKEND ON 4/20 FORMER GOVERNOR JESSE VENTURA WILL KICK OFF HIS NEW CANNABIS BUSINESS IN MINNESOTA.\n\nOUR MARY LAHAMMER WAS THE ONLY TV REPORTER INVITED INSIDE THE NEW OPERATION WHERE THE GOVERNOR FORTH ON ISSUES RANGING FROM MARIJUANA TO PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS.\n\n>> ary: GOVERNOR JESSE VENTURA HAS ADVOCATED FOR MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION FOR DECADES.\n\nNOW THAT IT'S ALLOWED IN HIS HOME STATE, HE'S GOING INTO BUSINESS IN THE AREA HE LONG CALLED HOME.\n\nARE WE ALLOWED IN?\n\nOKAY.\n\nGOVERNOR, WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW?\n\n>> THIS IS RETRO BAKERY, LOCATED HERE IN BROOKLYN CENTER ON THE BORDER OF BROOKLYN PARK.\n\nAND IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW, I WAS THE FORMER MAYOR OF BROOKLYN PARK MANY YEARS AGO.\n\nAND THIS IS WHERE CANNABIS TAKES PLACE IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA.\n\nBECAUSE CANNABIS IS LEGAL NOW, GOVERNOR WALZ SIGNED IT, HANDED ME THE PEN, THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF IT, THE GENIE'S OUT OF THE BOTTLE NOW, THOSE ARE GUMMIES ON THE SHELF RIGHT THERE.\n\nWE'LL PACKAGE THEM UP NOW, THEY'LL GO IN THESE LITTLE PACKETS.\n\n>> Mary: DIVERSITY AND EQUITY ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF MINNESOTA'S MARIJUANA LAW, AND IT'S AN ETHIC CARRIED THROUGH AT JESSE VENTURA FARMS.\n\n>> WE'RE THE MOST DIVERSE COMPANY IN MINNESOTA, PROBABLY.\n\n>> Mary: REALLY?\n\n>> YEAH, WHEN IT COMES TO EVERYTHING.\n\nWE HAVE PEOPLE WORKING HERE WHO, YOU KNOW, MADE SOME BAD DECISIONS IN THEIR LIFE AND PAID FOR THEM.\n\nWE HAVE ALL COLORS REPRESENTED HERE.\n\nCANNABIS KNOWS NO COLOR.\n\n>> Mary: WHAT ABOUT WOMEN?\n\nI HEAR AND SEE THAT THERE ARE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS HERE, TOO.\n\n>> ABSOLUTELY.\n\n>> Mary: WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU?\n\n>> WOMEN, IF YOU WANT TO GET POLITICAL, WOMEN ARE GOING TO DECIDE THE FATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN THE 2024 ELECTION.\n\n>> Mary: NOW, THIS LOOKS LIKE THESE ROOMS SEAL UP AND THEY'RE -- >> YEAH.\n\nTHESE ARE ROOMS HERE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY WILL DO THE CREATION.\n\nAND, SO, YOU DON'T WANT THEM CONTAMINATED AT ALL.\n\n>> Mary: CANNABIS USE BY KIDS IS A CONCERN.\n\nTHE STATE LAW SPECIFIES IT'S ONLY FOR ADULTS OVER 21.\n\n>> IF KIDS ARE GETTING CANNABIS, BLAME THE ADULTS.\n\nIT'S THAT SIMPLE.\n\n>> Mary: THIS FEELS LIKE A BAKERY OR A KITCHEN, RIGHT?\n\n>> IT IS.\n\n>> Mary: YEAH.\n\n>> T IS A BAKERY, SIMPLY OF CANNABIS.\n\n>> Mary: THIS MARKS THE FIRST TIME AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE UNITED STATES HAS PUT THEIR NAME ON A MARIJUANA-RELATED PRODUCT.\n\n>> Mary: YOU MADE HISTORY BEFORE BUT THIS MOVE IS HISTORIC.\n\n>> I THINK SO, IN THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, LET'S REMEMBER AT ONE TIME I WAS A MILLER LITE ALL-STAR, SO I PUSHED BEER.\n\nI WAS PREFER CANNABIS OVER BEER BECAUSE, NUMBER ONE, YOU CAN'T GET SICK USING IT.\n\nAND, NUMBER TWO, THERE'S NO HANGOVER.\n\nMY LIFE WAS CHANGED BECAUSE OF MARIJUANA CANNABIS.\n\nTHE FIRST LADY OF MINNESOTA WAS STRICKEN WITH SEIZURE DISORDERS LATE IN LIFE.\n\nNOTHING PHARMA COULD DO TO HELP.\n\nFOUR DIFFERENT SEIZURE MEDICINES, NONE OF THEM WORKED.\n\nSHE WENT ON CANNABIS, SHE HAS NOT HAD A SEIZURE SINCE.\n\n>> Mary: THIS IS PERSONAL FOR YOU.\n\n>> THIS IS VERY PERSONAL FOR ME.\n\nAND IT'S ALSO A FOCUS RIGHT NOW FOR ME.\n\nI AM GOING TO FOCUS ON NOTHING ELSE.\n\n>> Mary: COMPANY LEADERS SAY, UNLIKE OTHER CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENTS, VENTURA HAS BEEN HANDS-ON, TASTING AND TESTING PRODUCTS.\n\nHAVE YOU TRIED THEM?\n\n>> YES.\n\n>> Mary: OKAY.\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?\n\n>> THEY TASTE GREAT.\n\nWE DECIDED TO NAME THE PACKAGE YOU CAN ORDER ON THE INTERNET, LAKE STREET.\n\n>> Mary: BECAUSE?\n\n>> BECAUSE I GREW UP TWO BLOCKS FROM LAKE STREET.\n\n>> Mary: AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE EFFECT IS FOR YOU?\n\n>> I REQUIRE CANNABIS BECAUSE I'M INFLICTED WITH SOME POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS AND I'M ALSO INFLICTED WITH NONSPECIFIC NEUROPATHY OF THE FEET.\n\nWHICH, IN LAYMAN'S TERM, MEAN YOUR FEET ARE NUMB AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHY.\n\nWHAT CANNABIS DOES, IT DID YOU ALSO THAT DOWN.\n\nIT PUTS IT ON THE BACK BURNER TO WHERE AT NIGHT YOU CAN SHUT YOUR EYES, SAME I TYPE -- SAME TYPE OF THING.\n\n>> Mary: DO YOU HAVE ACHES AND PAINS FROM WRESTLING THAT YOU USE IT FOR?\n\n>> OF COURSE.\n\nI GOT MY HIP REPLACED.\n\nCANNABIS CAN STOP PAIN.\n\n>> Mary: HESE EDIBLES HAVE BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT FOR YEARS.\n\nORIGINALLY THEY WERE LOOKING TO OPEN ELSEWHERE, BUT MINNESOTA'S MOVE TO LEGALIZE POT HAS MADE THIS VENTURE POSSIBLE HERE.\n\nWHY PUT YOUR NAME ON IT?\n\n>> WHY NOT?\n\nTHIS IS A COMPANY I'VE CHOSE TO DO BUSINESS WITH.\n\nTHEY'RE A LOCAL COMPANY.\n\nWE'RE OF THE BELIEF IN THE CANNABIS WORLD, WE WANT TO KEEP EVERYTHING MINNESOTAN.\n\nGROWN IN MINNESOTA, PROCESSED IN MINNESOTA, PROMOTED BY A MINNESOTAN.\n\n>> Mary: THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT STILL SHINES ON THE FORMER PRO WRESTLER TURNED GOVERNOR, WHO CAN'T RESIST DABBLING IN POLITICS.\n\n>> IF YOU WANT TO GET THE COUNTRY BACK RIGHT NOW, JESSE VENTURA SHOULD BE YOUR PRESIDENT.\n\nBECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE TWO OPPOSING SIDES, AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE AFTER THREE YEARS TO FORCE THEM BACK TOGETHER TO OPPOSE YOU.\n\nSO I COULD BE THE SAVIOR OF THE NATION RIGHT NOW.\n\n>> Mary: BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RUN EVEN THOUGH YOU THINK YOU CAN PROBABLY WIN?\n\n>> I CAN'T, I AN'T, HOW WOULD I GET BALLOT ACCESS?\n\nTHE ONLY THING I'D FEAR, MARY, IF I HAD BALLOT ACCESS IN ALL 50 STATES, I'D WIN.\n\nAND THEN I'D HAVE TO DO THE JOB.\n\n>> Mary: LONGTIME FRIEND, ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., PUBLICLY CONSIDERED VENTURA FOR A RUNNING MATE WHO WOULD HAVE RELISHED A CHANCE TO DEBATE.\n\n>> I THINK THAT SINCE ONALD TRUMP HAS COME AROUND, HE HAS CHANGED AMERICA TO THE WORSE IN EVERY ASPECT.\n\nNOW WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO HAVE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES?\n\n>> Mary: YOU WOULDN'T BE GOVERNOR WITHOUT DEBATES, WOULD YOU?\n\n>> NO.\n\n>> Mary: THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT HERE.\n\n>> THAT WAS THE WHOLE THING.\n\nTHERE'S A LOT OF POT SMOKERS, AND IF JOE BIDEN WERE TO REMOVE COMPLETELY ANY FEDERAL PENALTIES AND GET RID OF THE FEDERAL BANNING OF CANNABIS, I'M SURE HE COULD PROBABLY STIMULATE A LOT OF VOTES.\n\n>> Mary: FOR NOW, THE FORMER THIRD-PARTY GOVERNOR IS CONTENT LIVING HIS D"
