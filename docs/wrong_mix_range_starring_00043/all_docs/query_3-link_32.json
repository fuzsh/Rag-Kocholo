        "text": "Ventura pens civic textbook\n\nMINNEAPOLIS - Gov. Jesse Ventura gets down to the basics, from his career to general thoughts on politics, in a 64-page civics textbook for children.\n\nIn the colorfully illustrated book, Ventura offers thoughts including: \"Whenever I meet with kids, I always say, question the status quo, whether it be their teacher or whoever. . . . Apathy is our biggest problem. I keep telling kids, you've gotta start voting.\"\n\nHe also said: \"The Society for the Preservation of Ice Cream and the No More Homework Coalition are not real groups, at least not yet. . . . These groups, from the silly to the serious, are called special-interest groups, because they are very focused on one cause.\"\n\nThe hardcover \"Jesse Ventura Tells It Like It Is: America's Most Outspoken Governor Speaks Out About Government\" already has sold 10,000 copies in advance.\n\n, said Beth Heiss, director of marketing for the Minneapolis-based Lerner Publishing Group.\n\nMuch of the book is a nuts-and-bolts primer on government and politics, including takeouts on the Bill of Rights, political parties (\"I'm free to act like a Republican when I think it makes sense to and to act like a Democrat when it makes sense\"), and the electoral college (\"If the process sounds confusing, that's because it is\").\n\nProceeds from sales of the book, due out next month, will go to charities Ventura has designated, said his spokesman, John Wodele.\n\nRock star Bob Seger hugs his skipper Jack Mormon after they arrived at Mackinac Island, Mich., on Seger's Lightning of St. Clair Shores on July 15.\n\nSeger set sail on stormy seas\n\nPONTIAC, Mich. - Bob Seger said this year's Race to Mackinac was scary because of severe storms that forced at least 18 boats to drop out of the 333-mile contest from Chicago to Mackinac Island.\n\nThe rock star and the crew of his 52-foot sailboat, Lightning, finished the race, but winds up to 70 mph and torrential rain split one of the boat's sails and tipped it hard to one side.\n\n\"It was like a blow dryer blowing Lake Michigan,\" Seger told The Oakland Press for a story Tuesday.\n\n\"The cold water was hitting the lake and steam was rising, and the water was moving almost laterally in the wind,\" Seger said from his cabin in Goodhart. \"We were OK, but it was scary. I was saying, 'Do I want to do this anymore?' \"\n\nLightning also lost steering at one point, but finished in 33 hours, 39 minutes and 34 seconds.\n\nLast week, Seger skippered the boat to a victory in its division in the 78th annual Port Huron-to-Mackinac Island Sailboat Race.\n\nIn the Race to Mackinac, Roy Disney's 75-foot Pyewacket earned first-to-finish honors with a time of 23 hours, 30 minutes and 24 seconds. More than 200 boats had finished by Monday afternoon.\n\n---\n\nOn the Net:\n\nChicago Yacht Club Web site: http://www.chicagoyachtclub.com\n\n---\n\nREDMOND, Wash. (AP) - Cyrus Krohn has been named publisher of the online magazine Slate.\n\nKrohn was Slate's second hire in 1996 and has served as its associate publisher since February 1999.\n\n\"Cyrus Krohn has been a key contributor and leader at Slate since its very inception,\" Scott Moore, general manager of MSN News and Information and former Slate publisher, said Monday.\n\nKrohn earlier directed the political advertising efforts for the Microsoft Network.\n\nBefore he joined Microsoft, he produced programs for CNN's \"Crossfire\" and \"Larry King Live\" and worked in the White House for Vice President Dan Quayle in the special projects office from 1991-92.\n\nSlate has 4 million readers a month, Moore said.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nMIAMI - The co-owner of The Source magazine will spend no time in jail after his arrest for a confrontation with a police officer.\n\nIn an agreement with state prosecutors, Raymond Scott pleaded no contest to driving with a suspended license and reckless driving, it was reported last week.\n\nScott, who did not appear in court, will pay $2,500 to the Miami Beach Police Officer Assistance Fund and $471 in court costs. He was placed on 12 months unsupervised probation.\n\nThe 36-year-old from New York City was arrested last August while in Miami Beach for a hip-hop awards show sponsored by his magazine. He was stopped for speeding in his Ferrari a few hours after the event.\n\nScott was driving 64 mph in a 30-mph zone, police said.\n\nThe police report said that Scott shouted profanities at Officer Robert Silvagni and later punched and kicked him. Scott accused the officer of racial profiling and brutality. The magazine filed a formal complaint about the officer's conduct.\n\nScott originally faced nine charges, including battery on a police officer. Four of the charges were felonies but two of them were dismissed while two others were reduced.\n\n---\n\nYeoh\n\nYeoh's toughest stunt yet\n\nTAIPEI, Taiwan - Malaysian-born actress Michelle Yeoh can make death-defying action stunts look easy, but she says producing her first film was a challenge.\n\nWhen reporters asked the ex-James Bond girl and star of Ang Lee's \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" what it was like producing her own film, her first response was just \"Wow!\"\n\n\"It was a real nerve-racking experience in the beginning. I am a real rookie at this, obviously,\" she said, speaking at a news conference Saturday to promote \"The Touch.\"\n\n\"There are so many elements in the movie industry that I am just beginning to learn about. As an actor you are well-protected,\" she said.\n\n, who also stars in the film directed by Peter Pau.\n\nThe mixed genre movie - action, martial arts, romance and thriller - is about a family of acrobats and their search for a mystical Buddhist artifact. It's scheduled to open in Hong Kong in early August and in Taiwan in mid-August.\n\n---\n\nHAVANA - Cuban folk singer Silvio Rodriguez gave a surprise recital as musicians and academics wrapped up the first scholarly conference ever held on the history of a ballad style known as Cuban trova.\n\nPlaying a guitar - the instrument of choice for trova folk music - Rodriguez performed one of his own compositions, \"Pequena Serenata Diurna (Tiny Daily Serenade),\" before about 300 people gathered in the Amadeo Roldan Theater as the weeklong conference closed Friday night.\n\nTrova has its roots in the ballads that traveling singers, or troubadours, composed during the island's wars of independence.\n\nModern Cuban trovas recall American protest songs of the 1960s and 1970s that focused attention on social problems through musical storytelling.\n\n---\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Academy Award-winning actress Marlee Matlin has given birth to a boy.\n\nThe 36-year-old gave birth to Tyler Daniel Grandalski on Thursday, her third child with husband Kevin Grandalski, publicist Jessica Cohen said.\n\nThe newborn joined two other children, Sarah, 6, and Brandon, 1, from her eight-year marriage to Grandalski, a police officer.\n\nMatlin, who is deaf, won a best actress Oscar in the 1986 film \"Children of a Lesser God.\" She has appeared on NBC's \"The West Wing\" and will release her first novel, \"Deaf Child Crossing,\" in October.\n\n\"Regis really turned the genre around, didn't he? He put such a cool factor on the whole game-show genre.\"\n\nDONNY OSMOND\n\nThe singer, who will be host of \"Pyramid,\" credits Regis Philbin, host of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,\" for making it cool to be a game-show host.\n\nOsmond\n\nSALT LAKE CITY - DONNY OSMOND credits Regis Philbin for making it cool to be a game-show host.\n\nStarting in September, Osmond will be the host of \"Pyramid,\" a syndicated revival of the game shows Dick Clark hosted in the 1970s and '80s. Clark was the host of CBS' daytime series \"$25,000 Pyramid\" and the syndicated \"$100,000 Pyramid.\"\n\n\"Regis really turned the genre around, didn't he? He put such a cool factor on the whole game-show genre,\" said Osmond, referring to Philbin's role as host of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.\"\n\n\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" is not on ABC's fall schedule, but is expected to return in special events. A syndicated version starring Meredith Vieira is scheduled to debut in September.\n\n\"Everything is cyclical. And right now it's a cool thing for me to do,\" Osmond said recently. He and his sister, Marie, had their own '70s musical-variety show and, more recently, a daytime entertainment-talk show. Osmond began his career as one of the Osmond Brothers.\n\n\"There will not be any singing on 'Pyramid,\"' the 44-year-old entertainer added. \"No, no, no. Ain't gonna happen.\"\n\n\"Pyramid\" will be similar to its earlier versions, with an updated look and minor rule changes. As before, contestants will team with celebrities in a contest that involves giving clues and guessing words.\n\nEds: PMs.\n\nGus Dudgeon\n\nLONDON (AP) -\n\nGUS DUDGEON, a respected music producer who worked on many of Elton John's hit recordings, died Sunday in a car crash in western England.
