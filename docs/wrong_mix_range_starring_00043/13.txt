Not an accurate story

A lot of this "bio" is bogus.The producers must have been threatened with lawsuits from WWF,as there is no mention of that company-where Ventura was a major star,for years.Movie begins with Jesse wresting in WCW (where he NEVER wrestled-nor did it EXIST in 1984,when the film begins).Only real aspect about wrestling was that Ventura idolized 'Superstar'Billy Graham,and modeled his ring persona after him.Ventura's stint as a Navy Seal is also shown (that is true).But the biggest part of the film is about wrestling,which is all contrived.The film ends with Jesse's unlikely foray into politics,and his eventual victory as Governor of Minn.But as a longtime wrestling fan-it annoyed me that his real career,and tag team partners,and opponents were not mentioned.

The Jseese Ventura Story review

Being a wrestling fan i tend to go for movies about wrestling rather than movies starring wrestlers. The Jesse Ventura Story is a look at the life of Jesse "The Body" Ventura. Is it accurate? Not really, certain things concerning his life were ommited, his wrestling career was altred beyond recognition (Goldberg, Raven and Kanyon were not even wrestling when he retired) But it is an entertaining movie of a man who bucked the system. He went from Navy Seal to wrestling to commentating to Mayor before ending up as Governor of Minnesota. Do not watch for an accurate depiction of Jesse's life, watch for a glossed over, made for tv version. All in all though i enjoyed it and took it for what it was. A fictionalised version of real events with bits thrown in and bits taken out. In addition i would say that at least it was based on a very entertaining and interesting man. It will go on my shelf beside other wrestling related films like Ready to Rumble and The Wrestler as movies looking AT wrestling rather than using wrestlers to be the stars of the films.Read full review
