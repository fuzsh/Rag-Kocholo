TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura will portray the governor of Indiana in the movie "The Drunk" now filming in Terre Haute.

The former wrestler and occasional actor joins veteran actor Tom Sizemore in the cast.

Terre Haute natives William Tanoos and Paul Fleschner of Tanoos Fleschner Productions wrote the film in which Tanoos stars as the fictitious grandson of 20th century labor leader Eugene Debs running for governor of Indiana. Fleschner plays his attorney and campaign manager, and Sizemore portrays a corrupt prosecutor Debs is running against for the Democratic nomination.

Fleschner tells the Terre Haute Tribune-Star that Ventura agreed to join the cast after about a month of talks.

The producers said they hope to have the film ready to distribute amid the 2012 election season.
