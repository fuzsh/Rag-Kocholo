        "text": "Australia's Alex Davison, grandson of motor racing legend Lex Davison, has won the opening round of this year's fiercely-contested Porsche Carrera Cup at Hockenheim.\n\nThe only Australian in the field, 21-year-old Davison (pictured) started from pole position - almost a second quicker than last year's pole - and was never headed during the 31-lap race.\n\nDavison, in his second season of the Carrera Cup, was driving one of the 22 identically prepared, 272kW Porsche GT3 Cup coupes. It was the first race for the cars with their newly-homologated larger, \"Le Mans GT3R\" rear wings and modified front undertrays.\n\n\"I led from start to finish, but that makes it sound a bit easier than it was,\" an elated Davison said after the race. \"I got a good start and bolted for the first few laps, but I lost my one-second advantage to Marc Lieb (UPS Porsche-Junior team) when I missed a gear coming into the stadium. After that, he was right onto me.\"\n\nLieb was already locked in battle with Davison's Team Hewlett-Packard/Porsche Centre Koblenz team-mate Christian Menzel, and Lieb's team-mate, Timo Bernhard. Davison sustained enormous pressure from the tailing trio for several laps.\n\nLieb and Davison traded paint more than once as the Australian driver's tyres began to wear at half-distance.\n\n\"My car was getting more oversteer, and I had to really tell myself to keep calm and to concentrate on getting out of the corners as cleanly as I could,\" Davison said. \"With about 10 laps to go, Marc (Lieb) started to look as though he was losing some grip, too, so I was able to maintain a bit of breathing space.\"\n\nMenzel then got past Lieb after yet more paint-swapping and, according to Davison, plenty of bent panels.\n\nThe result was a perfect one-two finish for Team Hewlett-Packard/Porsche Centre Koblenz, in its first year of Carrera Cup competition.\n\n\"The first win is always the hardest, especially when it's been a year between drinks,\" Davison said, his best result in his debut Carrera Cup season last year being a sixth place. \"But I do remember how to do it! Today's win has totally restored my confidence, and instead of just racing for that first win, now I can think about racing for championship points.\"\n\nThe next Carrera Cup round is at the Nrburgring on May 6."
