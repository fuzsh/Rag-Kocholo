        "text": "Brand New Rare Book by Graham Howard. ISBN 9780908031795, like new condition\n\nA great many people, both in Australia and overseas fondly remember Lex Davison as an outstanding driver of competition cars. They speak also of his skill as a raconteur, his sportsmanship and his pride in both family and country. What they may not be aware of however are the many other fields in which he had an interest. As a young man he was taken into the family Paragon Shoe Company which, in the fullness of time, he headed. He had an excellent sporting and athletic upbringing, loved jazz, spent time in the Army, rode to hounds, had a keen eye for art and had rural and urban property interests. Add to this his multiple Champion Australian driver awards in both road racing and hillclimbing, together with participation in the Monte Carlo rally and at Le Mans, his \"guest drive\" of the land-speed record car Bluebird at Lake Eyre, and a full picture of the man emerges. This fascinating story is a fitting tribute to one who was, as the book's subtitle says, Larger Than Life."
