        "text": "Before the Holden versus Ford rivalry made touring cars the stars in the 1970s, the top attraction of Australian motor racing was Formula One-style open-wheelers.\n\nPrior to Peter Brock and Allan Moffat, who became the defining protagonists through their battles at Bathurst, the heroes were single-seater daredevils such as Bib Stillwell, Bill Patterson, Reg Hunt, David McKay and Alec Mildren.\n\nThey raced in the sport's most perilous era in the 1950s and '60s in the most dangerous racing cars, and if their names are even vaguely familiar it's because they established high-profile car dealerships in Melbourne and Sydney on their back of their driving fame.\n\nWhile '60s showmen like Norm Beechey, Bob Jane, Ian Geoghegan and even Moffat are regarded as the \"fathers\" of modern V8 Supercars because they began the popularisation of sedan racing in their brutish Holden Monaros and Ford Mustangs, they were still very much secondary to the open-wheel aces.\n\nUntil the mid-'70s, the Australian Drivers' Championship Gold Star was the most coveted prize in Australian motor racing, contested by hard-living, hard-racing playboys in spindly single-seaters based on F1 cars.\n\nIt was a golden age and among the other famous automotive and business figures who risked injury or worse every time they competed were Stan Jones, father of 1980 F1 world champion Alan, Arnold Glass, Len Lukey and Lex Davison.\n\nPerhaps the most glamorous was Davison, a wealthy Melbourne socialite who epitomised the swashbuckling gentlemen racers of his era.\n\nHis exploits until his death at Sandown Raceway in February1965 inspired a racing dynasty that continues to pervade the highest level of Australian motor sport.\n\nDavison's sons Jon and Richard were accomplished racers in the '70s and early '80s, and their sons are successful third-generation drivers.\n\nRichard's youngest offspring is 2009 Bathurst 1000 co-winner and leading V8 Supercars driver Will, whose elder brother Alex is an established co-driver in the V8 endurance races.\n\nJon's youngest son, James, has carved a career in American racing, driving for the factory Nissan GT team and, for the past two years, competing in the famed Indianapolis 500.\n\nThe Davisons are Australia's domestic racing royalty, akin to the Andrettis in the US, where former world F1 champion Mario's grandson Marco drives for his father - and former IndyCar champion - Michael's team.\n\nLex Davison was a significant driver in his time, winning a record four Australian Grands Prix in 1954, `57, `58, `61 - equalled only by F1 superstar Michael Schumacher during his early 2000s reign at Albert Park - and the Australian Drivers' Championship in '57.\n\nHe achieved the equivalent of modern celebrity status because he also was a respected and well-known businessman, and a prominent figure in the community and social circles.\n\nDavison, who was 42, died in a crash at Sandown on February 20, 1965, during practice for an international race. His fatal accident is believed to have been triggered by a heart attack.\n\nMarking the 50th anniversary year of his death, there will be a tribute to his swashbuckling career at the annual Historic Sandown meeting next weekend.\n\nA Lex Davison Trophy will be the main prize for one of the feature races next Sunday for single-seaters and sports cars from his era, while the winners of the day's other main events will receive medallions struck in his memory.\n\nThe two-day retro-fest, which is one of the country's biggest historic motor racing events, will be attended by his surviving sons Jon, Richard and Chris, and daughter Catherine.\n\nChris Davison will be fielding a team of classic Formula Ford racing cars driven by younger amateur racer members of the family under the same Ecurie Australie banner for which Lex competed.\n\nJon Davison, who raced fearsome F5000 machines in the '70s before becoming the Sandown motor racing promoter from 1991 to 2007, remembers his father as a larger-than-life character.\n\n\"He was a great father, but also a hero to so many people,\" he said. \"He was a very, very big name in his time. He was very well known outside racing in business and social circles.\n\n\"He inspired me to go racing and also my attention to detail in terms of presentation. He left a fantastic legacy and we've perpetuated that at a pretty high level.\n\n\"I'm glad he died behind the wheel of a racing car rather than at his desk.\"\n\nWhile Will Davison never knew his grandfather, he was destined to follow in his and his father's tyre tracks.\n\n\"That was the shadow under which I was brought up,\" he said.\n\n\"As a kid, I was aware of the legend status of my grandfather. I heard lots about him without really understanding his achievements.\n\n\"The older I got, the more I've appreciated what he did. Lex was a big part of an amazing era in motor racing. It's pretty cool to be part of his legacy.\"\n\nAccording to veteran motor sport commentator Will Hagon, Lex Davison stood out as much for his privileged lifestyle as his ability and versatility behind the wheel.\n\n\"He was a star because Victoria was strong in motor sport back then and he was a very high-profile Victorian because of his business [Paragon Shoes] and his standing in the community,\" said Hagon, who was at Sandown when Davison died."
