        "meta_description": "• First of the entire standard-setting Formula 1 Lotus family • Double-World Champion Driver Graham Hill's first frontline Formula 1 car • Dual-Formula race history, 1.5-litre F2/2-litre 'interim' Formula 1 • Five-time Monaco GP winner Graham Hill's Monte Carlo debutante car • Superb provenance as acknowledged by Clive Chapman of Classic Team Lotus • Startlingly original survivor in running condition Success brings fame - great success more fame – and true domination legendary status. That is what British engineer/entrepreneur and 'Real Racer' Colin Chapman's Team Lotus achieved with its tremendous record of seven Formula 1 Constructors' World Championship titles, plus six Drivers' World Championship crowns 1963-1979, and no fewer than 74 frontline Grand Prix victories during a period in which so few were run each year that many experienced enthusiasts now consider the era as being Formula 1 before frequency devalued it. Against this context consider the beautifully-presented and extremely original first-ever Formula 1 Lotus Grand Prix that BONHAMS now offer here and its true status as a collectable gem of real significance is self-evident. But there's still more to commend this individual Lotus-Climax Type 12 chassis '353'. It is the very first Formula 1 Lotus of them all. And it is also the very car in which double-Formula 1 World Champion Driver, both Indianapolis 500-Miles and Le Mans 24-Hour race winner Graham Hill made his own F1 debut - at non-Championship-qualifying level - and in which he then made his own World title-qualifying Grand Prix debut in the 1958 Monaco GP. What adds even further savour is that Graham Hill would go on to make the annual Monte Carlo classic virtually his own by winning it no fewer than five times, with a hat-trick of glamorous victories there in 1962-63-64, followed by two more in succession - both for Team Lotus - in 1968-69. So, if ever there has been a remarkably well-preserved yet sympathetically restored Grand Prix car of genuine historic significance - not just individually but both for its maker's brand and for its contemporary driver - then Lotus '353' now offered here is surely it... It originated as a works Team Lotus entry late in the 1957 racing season, and was campaigned by them as Graham Hill's regular mount in either 1500cc Formula 2 or 2-litre Formula 1 trim eight times until July 1958. It was then sold to private entrant John Fisher, featuring in a further four races into 1959. In 1960 it was acquired by Australian aspiring racing driver Frank Gardner - backed by racing enthusiast Len Deaton - in 1960 and, in 1961, shipped 'down under', then passed through the hands of Joe Hills, David Conlon and David Holyoake before being bought by current owner/restorer Mike Bennett and Lotus enthusiast Don Asser, in 1991. Full ownership then passed to Mr Bennett in 1995. The car has been lovingly restored and preserved over the 33 years since he first co-acquired it, and its full history – in intricate detail – is available in Mr Bennett's profusely-illustrated book 'Lotus 12 Chassis 353 The History' (ISBN: 0-646-45776-4), now in its fourth edition. In his foreword to the book Clive Chapman, son of Colin and head of the modern Classic Team Lotus, writes: \"Lotus enthusiasts owe a debt of gratitude to everyone that has played a role in the story of this very early Lotus and its stable mates. I wish that every Team Lotus racing car could have such a wonderful record of its life\". In fact the Lotus 12 had been unveiled to the public at the 1956 London Motor Show, a cosmetic prototype being displayed there in parallel with the prototype Lotus Elite GT model. That single-seat show car carried a mock-up of the latest 1475cc 4-cylinder twin cam Coventry Climax FPF engine intended for the new year's fresh Formula 2 category, and with Lotus's intended new lightweight, sequential-change gearbox – rear mounted in unit with the final-drive to the rear wheels – actually a wooden maquette. The very slim, ultra-lightweight spaceframe chassis part-featured expensive and contemporarily demanding aircraft-spec Reynolds 531 tubing, and for extra stiffness Colin Chapman secured the slightly-spooned aluminium undertray rigidly to the structure. New, effectively double-wishbone front suspension featured, with initially a de Dion rear arrangement, co-axial coil-spring/damper units providing the springing medium all round. Girling disc brakes were fitted, outboard front and inboard rear where they resided on each side of the innovative new five-speed and reverse sequential-change gearbox. This transmission, with its left-hand straightline shift pattern, would become famous as the Lotus 'queerbox'. And it was also within the Lotus 12 that Colin Chapman introduced his marque's soon-signature 'wobbly web' cast-magnesium alloy disc wheels, providing a rigid weight-saving replacement for traditional wire-spoked designs. Six-bolt fixing featured – Colin believing that, with a dry weight claimed to be just 620lbs (281.2kg - but in reality closer to 350kg - 771lbs) the 12 was unlikely to wear out tyres even in a full-length (then 300-mile) Grand Prix. Body design, by De Havilland aircraft company aerodynamicist Frank Costin, aimed at minimal frontal area, untroubled airflow and adequate cooling. The effect was truly startling for its time. The new Lotus 12 was extraordinarily tiny, an incredibly slim yet elegant front-engined single-seat racing car. As indicated above Lotus Type 12 weight was often exaggerated down, but contemporarily it was claimed to have a ready-to-run weight of barely 700lbs (317.5kg). With 141bhp in F2 form its power-to-weight ratio was c.451bhp per ton. Lotus 12 '353' actually made its own racing debut for Team Lotus, driven by works guest driver Henry Taylor, in the September 1957 BRDC International Trophy race at Silverstone. While team-mate Ron Flockhart actually won the Formula 2 class there in a sister works-entered Type 12, Olympic bob-sleigh racer Taylor in '353' finished second for a memorable Lotus 1-2 success. Next time out, at Goodwood, the car was driven by Graham Hill in his personal frontline single-seater racing debut. This car's full racing history 1957-59 is then as follows: 1957 BRDC International Trophy, Silverstone, F2 – Henry Taylor – 2nd Woodcote Cup, Goodwood, F2 – Graham Hill – 5th International Gold Cup, Oulton Park, F2 – Graham Hill – 11th and Fastest Lap 1958 Lavant Cup, Goodwood, F2 - Graham Hill – 2nd and Fastest Lap Glover Trophy, Goodwood, F2 class – Rtd BARC '200', Aintree – F2 class – 7th BRDC International Trophy, Silverstone, F1 - Graham Hill – 8th Formula 1 debut for both car and driver MONACO GRAND PRIX, Monte Carlo - Graham Hill – Rtd World Championship Grand Prix debut for Team Lotus, car and driver DUTCH GRAND PRIX, Zandvoort - Graham Hill – Rtd BELGIAN GRAND PRIX, Spa-Francorchamps - Graham Hill – Rtd Coupe de Vitesse, Reims-Gueux, France, F2 - Graham Hill – Rtd Trophée d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand – Maurice Michy - Rtd – new owner John Fisher entry Boxing Day Brands Hatch, Formule Libre – Bruce Halford –unrecorded 1959 Syracuse Grand Prix, Sicily, F2 – Maria Teresa de Filippis – Rtd London Trophy, Crystal Palace, F2 – Bruce Halford – Rtd It is notable that in Graham Hill's hands '353' proved itself a formidable Formula 2 contender by setting fastest race lap at both Oulton Park and Goodwood. Judge such an original racing car by the company it kept and '353' yet again scores high. .. In that latter 1958 Easter Meeting, running alongside Formula 1 entries in the feature Glover Trophy race, Graham and '353' shared track space with the winning works-entered Formula 1 Ferrari of Mike Hawthorn (plus Stirling Moss's Rob Walker-entered Cooper). In both car and driver's F1 debut at Silverstone Graham and '353' shared the track with Peter Collins' winning works Ferrari plus the Moss Cooper, Jean Behra BRM, etc. Its later entry by John Fisher at the 1959 Syracuse GP is also noteworthy, since its girl driver Maria Teresa de Filippis was the Italian former Maserati 250F pilota much admired at the time; diversity indeed. Recalling his Monaco Grand Prix debut in '353' – Graham would later write: \"In those days the race used to be 100 laps of the 1.9-mile circuit which was very hard work in the front-engined cars of that period. The heat from the radiator and the engine would seep back through the cockpit and you had the exhaust system alongside you so it was pretty uncomfortable. \"I was driving as fast as I could, but I had to think of my engine – a stretched-out 1½-litre is obviously not as reliable as it was in its original form. With an overstressed engine, you can't go bouncing off kerbs or making rough gearchanges; you try to drive as smoothly as possible and above all you don't over-rev the engine. \"When the race started I was last but by the 75th lap I found myself in fourth place.... Twelve of the other cars had dropped out and there I was running fourth. A piece of cake. I thought my first Grand Prix and running fourth already. Then my back wheel fell off. \"As I turned into Portier, the corner that leads back along the seafront before the tunnel, the car suddenly spun around and the revs went soaring up. I thought it had jumped out of gear, so I started fishing around like crazy with the gearlever trying to find the right gear, revving up in each one and dropping the clutch. \"Nothing happened and I thought it was a bit strange, so I looked out and I noticed that the rear wheel was alongside the cockpit. I climbed out and promptly fell over. I was suffering from heat exhaustion and was as weak as a kitten. I had to get the marshals to help me to pull the car back off the track. And that was the sad end of my first Grand Prix...\". Beyond its track accomplishments, the Lotus-Climax Type 12 chassis '353' is the star of a memorable story, fondly recalled in later years as the 'Figgy Pudding Grand Prix'. Renowned racing journalist – and 1955 Mille Miglia-winning navigator to Stirling Moss in their factory Mercedes - Denis Jenkinson of 'Motor Sport' magazine developed a hankering to try a single-seater racing car on an everyday British public road. That ambition was realised on Christmas Day 1957 when Lotus Cars' founder Colin Chapman lent him '353' to run \"while the police were hopefully off road eating their Christmas lunch\". In preparing '353' for this BONHAMS Monaco Sale we took the car, retaining its original chassis, original body panels, and of course its stunningly significant landmark history, back to Goodwood - the scene of its racing debut with Graham Hill back in 1957. Clouds cleared, and gorgeous spring sun made '353' truly sparkle – as this genuinely historic jewel truly should. Certainly this most exquisitely compact front-engined Grand Prix car of them all would fit into even the most confined collection garage. For connoisseurs this first Formula 1 Lotus of them all – the Graham Hill debutante car - warrants absolutely the closest possible consideration. THE FIGGY PUDDING GRAND PRIX Denis Jenkinson writing about his escapade in what would shortly become the first-ever Formula 1 Lotus – Christmas Day, 1957. \"I thought it would be fun to drive a Grand Prix car on the public roads, and what better time to do it than lunchtime on December 25. With everyone sitting down to Christmas dinner between 12 noon and 3pm I reckoned the roads would be pretty clear. I also bargained on the police having Christmas dinner at the station, because I was intending to bend some of the rules just a tiny bit... \"The plan was to cover my figure-of-eight route on the open roads of Hampshire in a full-blooded Grand Prix car in full racing trim! The big question was what car to use. I approached David Yorke, the Vanwall team manager, and he warmed to the idea. A Vanwall was going to be worth 'going inside' for if I got caught. Plans progressed favourably, and it was decided to move the start to the rear of a friendly public house (The Phoenix at Harley Wintney – a favourite with the Vintage Sports Car Club, then and since), rather than the cafe in the High Street, as it would attract less attention and I could zoom out onto the main road and be gone before anyone realized what was happening. (Duty-bound, David Yorke had to mention it to his employer, Tony who thought it was a riotous idea at first, but then – responsibly - decided against. Jenks then approached Maserati 250F privateer Bruce Halford who was all for co-operating, but his car was at the factory in Modena during winter overhaul). \"I could see the whole thing fizzling out, so I rang Colin Chapman of Lotus. I had known Colin for many years, and he was always one for 'a bit of a lark', and while he did not have a Grand Prix Lotus he was quite prepared to lend me a Type 12 Formula 2 single-seater and agreed to bring it down to the pub on a trailer on Christmas morning. \"It was fine and dry, though a bit chilly, and during the morning I did a rapid run round the course in an Austin 105 that Motor Sport had on test, to check the route, weigh up the traffic density, note down any patrolling police cars and generally 'spy out the land'. True to his word, Colin arrived in a Ford Anglia with the F2 car on a trailer behind. It was in full racing trim, straight-through exhaust, no road equipment of any sort, a full-race Coventry Climax four-cylinder engine and the famous Lotus progressive-change gearbox, 'wobbly-web' alloy wheels and disc brakes. With Colin was (Team mechanic) Mery Therriault. \"While he 'fitted' me into the narrow cockpit, Colin said: 'You'd better borrow our Trade Plates, they might soften the blow if you get stopped'; a kindly thought that had not occurred to me when negotiating for the Vanwall or the 250F Maserati. There was no way to fix the front plate on the Lotus, so we abandoned it and slung the rear one across the tail as a gesture. \"They were what are known as Limited plates, which meant that the law demanded that my journey was specified on an official form. Colin cautiously filled it in: 'Plate No 007MH. Date of use: 25th December. Time of Departure: 1.00pm. Registration Mark or Chassis No: F2/2. Description of vehicle: Lotus. Purpose of use: Test Hampshire. Name of driver: Jenkinson. Name and address of licensee: Lotus Engineering. Signature of licensee or his agent: ACBC'. \"It was all very official (well, sort of) and if I was stopped I had to say: 'Oh dear, the front plate must have fallen off'. The question of an open exhaust, no mudguards, no audible warning of approach, a racing car on the road, undue speed, and anything else the law could think up, we reckoned would tot up to a pretty hefty fine, but with a bit of Christmas spirit would not involve a jail sentence. \"While Mery warmed up the Climax engine I donned crash helmet and goggles and told various friends to stay by their telephones in case I needed help. Colin said: 'I'm not stopping, good luck and goodbye', and he motored off back to London. \"The little Lotus was a revelation on the open road and hummed along at 80- 90mph on the first section of the route which involved a bypass and some roundabouts. Out beyond Basingstoke (after some 25-30 miles), heading for the open plains, I wound the Lotus up to about 120mph in fourth gear, snicked into top and was just getting ready to reach its terminal speed when the revs shot up and there was no drive to the wheels. \"As I began to slow I made various checks and it was obvious that something had broken in the transmission. On this deserted stretch of road there were a couple of houses and, with great presence of mind (not wishing to be found by the side of the road), I turned sharp right into a gateway, still freewheeling at about 50mph, and coasted up the long drive, well away from the road. Wishing to telephone for help, I knocked at the front door of the big house and politely asked if I might use the telephone as my car had broken down. The household was in a complete flap; Christmas dinner was ready and the guests hadn't arrived. The lady of the house was on the verge of a fainting fit, the gentleman was trying to calm things, and in the middle of it all there was this chap telephoning for help. They kept rushing to the door and peering down the drive, looking in vain for their guests, and I am sure that the single-seater racing Lotus standing on the gravel did not register with them. They were totally obsessed with their own problem of Christmas dinner being ready and no guests. \"I got through to a friend (Alan Southon who had a restoration workshop at The Phoenix pub) and told him where I was and he said he would come out with a tow-rope. As I was leaving, the guests arrived and there was pandemonium on all sides. The lady of the house was gasping: 'They're here, they're here', the gentleman was wishing everyone a 'Happy Christmas', children were shouting and yelling, dogs were barking...it was all too much. \"I quietly left and pushed the Lotus out through the mass of cars and wheeled it down to the gate. My friend arrived, we hitched up the towrope and set off back to base, happy to arrive safely without encountering the law. My Christmas dinner? I didn't have one, but I remember having quite a few beers to drown my sorrows. \"When Lotus got the car back they found that a driveshaft had sheared, luckily inside the universal joint, so it all stayed together. They also found that the driveshafts had been put on the wrong way round from usual, and the reversal loading was too much for the splines. Among my souvenirs I still have that brown slip of official paper with the date 25th December on it. Thanks, Merv, (for writing to me from Vancouver many years later and...) jogging my memory.\" And towards the end of his jam-packed life, Jenks and his friends would fondly recall this Figgy-Pudding Grand Prix – in Lotus-Climax Type 12 chassis '353'.
