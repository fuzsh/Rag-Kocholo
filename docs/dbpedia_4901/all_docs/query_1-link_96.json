However, with significant funding from his businessman father, Stroll was able to capitalise on a testing opportunity with Williams, which allowed him to step up to a full time race seat in 2017.\n\nF1 biography\n\nLance Stroll made his motorsport debut in his home country of Canada, karting his way towards single seater racing. He participated in several national championships before moving to Formula Three, where he joined the Toyota team in 2015. He started winning in his first year, and combined his successful Formula Three season with the Euro F3 Series and an appearance in the Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix.\n\nStroll joined the Ferrari Driver Academy, and started working towards a career in Formula One, but at the end of 2015, he switched to the Williams team to become a test driver. With the backing of his businessman father, Lawrence Stroll, Lance embarked on a stint of testing older Williams cars at various tracks to gain enough experience to earn his spot in F1.\n\nAt the end of the 2016 season, after participating and winning the Euro F3 series, Stroll was confirmed as racing driver for the Williams team for 2017, making his F1 debut in Australia."
