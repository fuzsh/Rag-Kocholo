May 13, 1950\n\nThe first championship race at the former World War Two airfield was won by Italian Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina in an Alfa Romeo. The Italian marque filled the podium after also sweeping the four-car front row. Ferrari did not participate. The race was attended by 200,000 spectators including King George VI.\n\n100 – German Grand Prix, Nurburgring. August 6, 1961\n\nStirling Moss won in a Lotus for the privately-run Rob Walker team, with American Phil Hill on pole for Ferrari. It was the Briton’s 16th and last F1 victory, ending a four-race streak of Ferrari wins. In 1962 Moss, four times a championship runner-up, crashed at Goodwood and retired from grand prix racing.\n\n200 – Monaco Grand Prix, May 23, 1971\n\nJackie Stewart won from pole for Tyrrell. Swedish great Ronnie Peterson, who died at Monza seven years later, was second for his first Formula One podium finish while Jacky Ickx was third for Ferrari. The race was later immortalised as ‘Weekend of a Champion’, a documentary by director Roman Polanski.\n\n300 – South African Grand Prix, Kyalami. March 4, 1978\n\nPeterson was the winner in a black and gold Lotus 78, with reigning champion Niki Lauda on pole for Brabham. American Mario Andretti was to win the championship that year. The race also saw the debut of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg, father of 2016 champion Nico.\n\n400 – Austrian Grand Prix, Oesterreichring. August 19, 1984\n\nLauda won his home race for McLaren, despite a late gearbox problem. It was his 23rd win and gave the Austrian the championship lead in a year that was to end with him taking his third title. Lauda’s compatriot Gerhard Berger, a future McLaren and Ferrari driver, made his F1 debut with the ATS BMW team.\n\n500 – Australian Grand Prix, Adelaide. November 4, 1990\n\nBrazilian Ayrton Senna started on pole for McLaren but compatriot Nelson Piquet was the winner for Benetton. The race was overshadowed by the previous grand prix in Japan where Senna had collided with former team mate Alain Prost and won his second title. This race was Nigel Mansell’s last for Ferrari.\n\n600 – Argentine Grand Prix, Buenos Aires. April 13, 1997\n\nCanada’s Jacques Villeneuve, to be champion that year with Williams, won from pole after taking victory also in the previous race in Brazil. Ferrari’s Eddie Irvine was second and Ralf Schumacher third for Jordan.\n\n700 – Brazilian Grand Prix, Interlagos. April 6, 2003\n\nA chaotic grand prix, with torrential rain and the race stopped on the 56th of 71 laps due to crashes. McLaren’s Kimi Raikkonen was announced as the winner but 10 days later the victory was reassigned to Jordan’s Giancarlo Fisichella. The Italian collected his trophy at Imola. The win was Jordan’s last, in their 200th start. Fernando Alonso was third but missed the podium because he was getting medical attention.\n\n800 – Singapore Grand Prix. September 28, 2008\n\nThe first night race under floodlights turned out to be a dark one after it emerged a year later that Nelson Piquet had crashed deliberately on lap 14 to bring out the safety car and help Renault team-mate Alonso win, from 15th on the grid. Ferrari’s Felipe Massa, leading from pole, could also feel that this race cost him the title, the Brazilian leaving the pits with the fuel hose still attached and dropping to last. He ended the season losing to McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton by a point.\n\n900 – Bahrain Grand Prix. April 6, 2014\n\nNico Rosberg started the third race of the season on pole for Mercedes but his teammate Hamilton, who had started alongside, won after taking the lead into the first corner. A late safety car deployment allowed Rosberg to get close to Hamilton again but the Briton stayed ahead."
