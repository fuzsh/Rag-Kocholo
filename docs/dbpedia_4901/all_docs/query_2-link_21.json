        "text": "As a natural extension of my current project, the Formula Libre Gold Star years 1957-63, I was wondering what were the main scratch races for racing cars prior to the Gold Star.\n\nThe Bathurst 100 was, I recently learned, a handicap prior to 1958. Was this usually run at the Easter meeting? At the October meeting was the NSW Road Racing Championship usually held? Were the various state Road Racing Championships scratch races?\n\nApart from the Victorian Trophy, I don't have much else, the odd mention of a scratch race at Altona and the opening Port Wakefield meeting and there's not much more.\n\nAs a very general rule, a 'championship' race was a scratch race by definition, eg Queensland, NSW etc.\n\nPre Gold Star, some important races were handicaps though, including the AGP until 1951(?) and the Bathurst 100 you mentioned.\n\nI think any list of important pre-GS race would have to include those two, together with the Vic (cop-out) Trophy, but some of the other fixtures were more important some years than others. This, as I am sure you realise, continued after 1957, with many fields being made up of locals plus two or three interstate pot-hunters\n\nYou don't have the Bathurst book, David?\n\nI'm short of time today, maybe John Medley can come in on this one?\n\nThe AGP, however, was run as a handicap up until 1951. Except for 1949, which had a massed start (and a great start it was too!).\n\nLet's put this into perspective. The National Competitions Committee of the Australian Automobile Association had decreed that the AGP should be a scratch race, which it hadn't been since 1932. There was still scope for an inbuilt handicap, but there was a lot of resistance and turmoil over this.\n\nQueensland had never previously had an AGP. The AAA had been angling for the AGP to rotate between all the states for ten years prior to this and when the bananabenders got their turn they stuck to the letter of things. This is not unusual, check the ATCC at Lakeside in 1964 and other tumultuous events.\n\nSo the AGP was suddenly a scratch race that year, though it had an inbuilt handicap. It ran from a massed start and the handicap result was applied after the finish. Don't forget, in those days cars kept running to complete the race after the winner had been flagged in, though some had to be flagged off because they were too far behind... some sort of rule undoubtedly covered that eventuality. Hmmm... musing here... just what might have happened in that late-in-the-day race at Leyburn had it not been cut short by the lack of daylight, if the start hadn't been so late because of stragglers still lapping at the end of the AGP?\n\nSo that was Leyburn, 1949. Then at Nuriootpa just 15 weeks later the SCC of SA rebelled against the AAA NCC ruling. They followed it to the letter... the AGP was run as a scratch race, but with a handicap start and then the scratch result was applied to the result. Moreover, there were no handicap prizes available to the scratch winner, and no scratch prizes beyond first place IIRC. To all intents and purposes it was a scratch race with the main prize, or the title that went with the main prize, awarded to the driver setting fastest time.\n\nThen came WA's first turn at an AGP... Narrogin. We were now in the third year of the AAA's decree, but still the pressure for a handicap race was strong. It was run as a handicap with all the placings on scratch acknowledged. The gold trophies awarded by the Federal Government were of equal size for both the scratch winner and the handicap winner... I know, I've seen them both, even if one was broken in two!\n\nThe irony of this decision at Narrogin was that it deprived the spectators of a tremendously interesting dice for the leading positions through much of the race, something revealed by Graham Howard in the AGP book.\n\nThe handicap side of the AGP never held sway after that time, with a massed start and a minor prize only for handicap winners in post-applied handicaps for a few years being the norm.\n\nAs David McKinney has said, there were other races with some interstate participation, but they didn't amount to much. To post-apply a kind of Gold Star status to most of these races would be difficult and to determine which races qualify would be instructive. How many races ran to Gold Star distance in those days apart from the few already mentioned... the AGP, the Victoria Trophy and the Bathurst 100.\n\nYou might find some events at Gnoo Blas, I don't know when the Toowoomba street race began, but there might have been something there and maybe a Leyburn event about 1952 or '53 (Davison and Jones turned up there once, but that doesn't mean it was a long race). Lowood also had a significant race in 1951 with at least Whiteford a runner. Bill Westerman or Don Thallon might be able to fill in some gaps here.\n\nThe SCC of SA would be able to provide details of anything held in SA, but I wouldn't be expecting anything regular. If anything, look for an Advertiser Trophy, Kevin and Joan Shearer might be a help there. Terry Walker can readily tell you of anything in WA, but the spasmodic nature of folks crossing the Nullarbor would preclude much in the way of eastern participation. Some went, of course, but not often.\n\nMost of the races there seem to have been over fifty miles (Great Southern Flying 50 etc), with Toodyay's Speed Classic f 1947 giving a clue to the way things were... twenty miles!\n\nThese races were almost exclusively handicaps until at least 1960, the AGPs and Gold Star events being probably the only scratch races of any duration until that time.\n\nTasmania had nothing until Longford arrived, and from memory there was only one Longford held before it became a Gold Star event. That one might well qualify.\n\nI don't think this will be as hard as it might seem, and it would appear to be a worthwhile exercise for you, David. I'll certainly be watching with interest, and we're all certain to do some learning.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have John's great Bathurst book. I might have to start saving my pennies for a copy though.\n\nI have come across some intriguing references to races at Balcombe, which appears to be Balcombe Army Camp south of Frankston, Victoria. I can't find any reference to the track on Darren's site. I have a date of June 12 1950, so I will check newspapers when I am next at the State Library.\n\nThere is a full report on the Balcombe event in Australian Motor Sports.\n\nThe Royal Australian Signal Corps Sports Sprint for sports cars under 1500cc was run in six heats, three semi-finals and a final.\n\nThe Survey Corps Sports Sprint for sports cars over 1500cc was run in two heats and a final.\n\nThe Balcombe Apprentice's School Trophy for racing cars of all capacities was run in ten heats, five quarter-finals, three semi-finals and a grand final.\n\nDoug Whiteford (Ford V8) won the final from Bill Patterson (MG s/c) and Stan Jones (HRG uns/c).\n\nIt was a classy entry with names like Lex Davison (Alafa Romeo), Charlie Dean (Maybach), Reg Hunt (500), Derek Jolly (Austin), Ted Gray (Alta Special), Otto Stone (K3 Magnette) and Tony Gaze (Alta) taking part.\n\nThanks Milan for that valuable information. I'm very curious about this now.\n\nHere's a diagram of the track.\n\nI think the sort of event being run was what we would now call a multi-car sprint rather than a race meeting. Each \"race\" lasted less than three minutes.\n\nI think the situation at Balcombe was that it was only two cars at a time...\n\nI posted a pic (or two?) from the event at one time. With just two cars you could get away with that loop that uses the same piece of road twice, of course. So it was basically a series of elimination contests. An interesting event, I can't say I've ever heard of a similar one anywhere else outside of drag racing.\n\nOriginally posted by Milan Fistonic\n\nHere's a diagram of the track.\n\nI think the sort of event being run was what we would now call a multi-car sprint rather than a race meeting. Each \"race\" lasted less than three minutes.\n\nQuote:\n\nBalcombe is naturally hilly. The start point is nearly the lowest part of that circuit. It is flat to start, then runs up hill continuously to the most easterly (right on the map) point on the map, then it is mostly down hill with a flat patch or two all the way to the hard right before the finish. That is a creek (lowest point) and after that it is an nasty little up hill bit to the finish line.\n\nUnquote"
