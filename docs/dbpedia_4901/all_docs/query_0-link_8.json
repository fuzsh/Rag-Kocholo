He also\n\nwas the first Australian to\n\ning art so that one day they\n\nwould be able to take their\n\nplace on the front row of\n\nany grid on any circuit.\n\nThis task had been set by\n\nDavison himself so that\n\nafter retirement as a driver\n\nhe would be able to still\n\nremain active in motor rac-\n\ning as a team manager and\n\ncoach.\n\nOver recent years this\n\ngreat Australian driver has\n\nreturned much to his sport,\n\ninspiring youth with advice\n\nand financial support.\n\nHis loss is a great one,\n\npossibly the worst tragedy\n\never to occur in Australian\n\nmotor sport, and all who\n\nare even remotely connected\n\nwith motor sport are sad at\n\nthe loss of a great champion\n\nand an even greater man.\n\nRally team\n\nNews that the famous\n\nEric Carlsson of Sweden\n\nand his wife Pat Moss are\n\nto come to Australia to take\n\npart in a rally here is good\n\nnews that will give local\n\ntrial competitors a chance\n\nto compete against world\n\nclass opposition.\n\nCarlsson is a three time\n\nwinner of the world famous\n\nMonte Carlo Rally whilst\n\nhis wife, the sister of Stirl-\n\ning Moss, is the top woman\n\nrally driver in the world\n\nand gained outright third\n\nplacing in this year's Monte\n\nCarlo.\n\nBoth are to drive Swedish\n\nSaabs in Australia whilst\n\nthey are here during May.\n\nBefore coming to Aus-\n\ntralia they both will com-\n\npete in the Swedish Rally\n\nand the Safari Rally in\n\nAfrica.\n\nThey will take part in the\n\nAcropolis Rally in Greece\n\nafter driving in Australia."
