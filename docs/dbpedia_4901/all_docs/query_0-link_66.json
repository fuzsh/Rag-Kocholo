        "text": "The Pilatus Team BRM entry, to be raced by Australian international James Davison in Nulon S5000, has been unveiled ahead of this weekend’s third round at the Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nDavison, one of Australia’s most accomplished drivers on the world stage, joins the S5000 field in Melbourne with the support of Swiss aircraft manufacturer, Pilatus.\n\nResplendent in Pilatus’ corporate colours of white and blue, Davison’s car is the latest built Rogers AF01/V8 chassis (#018) and will be raced for the first time on the Albert Park circuit.\n\nDavison’s S5000 will wear #4, a racing number of significance to the previous two generations of the Davison family.\n\nJames’ grandfather, the late, legendary Lex Davison, most often raced with and won the inaugural Australian Drivers’ Championship (1957) and Australian Grand Prix (1961) with #4.\n\nThe number was later run by James’ father, Jon, throughout much of his career in Formula 5000 during the 1970s and 1980s, as well as uncle, Richard, in Formula Ford.\n\nDavison, who was born in Melbourne and now lives in Miami, USA, returns to open wheel competition in S5000 after two years competing in the NASCAR Cup Series.\n\nDavison has contested 35 races in the premier division of stock car racing, the second highest number of starts for an Australian driver in NASCAR behind Marcos Ambrose.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2020, Davison competed in the Indianapolis 500 six times with a best finish of 12th in the 2019 race. In the same year, Davison qualified in the top half of the ‘500’ field (15th of 33) with a four-lap average speed of 228.273mph (367kph).\n\nDavison’s long-time supporter Leasexpress features prominently on the Pilatus Team BRM car, along with leading manufacturer of electrical engineering products, NHP.\n\nSupporting partners include Autolec Doctor, Cali Beach, C Coconut Water, Hafele, Luna Group, Portsea Estate, Sergi Cranes, The Trip and Votexa Batteries.\n\nNulon S5000 will contest two practice sessions and qualifying on Thursday, before three races on Friday, Saturday and Sunday respectively.\n\nLive coverage of Nulon S5000 from the Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix will be broadcast predominantly on Fox Sports and Kayo."
