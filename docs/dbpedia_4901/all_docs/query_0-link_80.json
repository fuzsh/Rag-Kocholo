Largely based on the DB3S Sportscar chassis and engine layout the car was designed by Ted Cutting and fitted with an engine of 2493cc. Tested as early as 1957 the Grand Prix debut did not come until the Dutch Grand Prix of 1959 and driven by Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby. During these two years design had moved forward at a pace and although the cars had acquitted themselves well in the non Championship International Trophy Race at Silverstone (Salvadori second behind Jack Brabham's works Cooper Climax) they were of the pace at Zandvoort. During the 1959 season the two car team appeared in only four Grand Prix, Dutch, British, Portuguese and Italian, posting a best performance of 6th place in Britain and Portugal both for Salvadori.\n\tFor 1960 Aston Martin replaced the DBR4 with the lighter DBR5 again without success\n\tThis DBR4 was shipped to Australia local racers Lex Davison and Bib Stilwell to compete in the Tasman series, fitted with a larger 2992cc engine and re designated DBR4/300 were it was more successful finishing 2nd in the 1960 Australian GP.
