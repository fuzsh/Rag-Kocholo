His junior career \"Road to Indy\" highlights include a runner-up finish in the 2007 Pro Mazda and 2009 Indy Lights Championships respectively. In 2013 he made his IndyCar Series debut for Dale Coyne Racing at Mid Ohio and in 2014, 2015 and 2017 competed in the famed Indianapolis 500 mile race.\n\nJames' sportscar racing break came with TRG-Aston Martin Racing in 2014, scoring 4 straight IMSA GT Daytona GT3 Pole Positions. A record 5th Pole Position was scored at the 2015 Rolex 24 at Daytona International Speedway. Also in 2015, James began racing for the AE factory NISSAN GT Academy team in the Pirelli World Challenge GT3 Sprint Series, debuting the Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3 in North America. The season was a success, all but winning the title after disqualification from a race victory due to a technical infraction.\n\nJames substituted for the injured Sebastien Bourdais at the 2017 Indy 500, starting 33rd and leading 2 laps. Whilst running in the top 6 in the final 20 laps of the race, he was involved in a multi car accident ending his day. James also competed for Joe Gibbs Racing in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, winning a stage race at Road America.\n\nJames' grandfather, Lex Davison, was 4 times winner of the Australian Grand Prix, competing against racing greats Bruce McLaren, Jim Clark and Graham Hill. Step-grandfather, Tony Gaze, was a WWII Spitfire ace and later went on to become the founder of motor racing at Goodwood and Australia's first Formula 1 driver.\n\nFather, Jon Davison, drove in 9 Australian Grand Prix, finished runner up in the 1980 Gold Star Australian Driver's Championship and later became the Promotor of Sandown International Raceway from 1991 to 2007. James' cousins, Alex and Will Davison, are V8 Supercar drivers with Will winning the Bathurst 1000 in 2009 and 2016."
