        "text": "Motoring legends mourn one of their own\n\nRacing greats Stirling Moss, Jackie Stewart and Jack Brabham have shared personal laments following the loss of revered Australian motor racing matriarch Diana Gaze at Barwon Heads.\n\nTheir sentiments were among hundreds from across the globe to flood family members measuring admiration for the mother of seven, who was wife of four-time Australian grand prix winner Lex Davison until his death and then wife of Australia's first world championship driver Tony Gaze.\n\nAlso an acclaimed race driver, Mrs Gaze was 86.\n\nRichard Davison said his mother had remained passionate about motor racing until her last days and widespread affection for her was clear.\n\n\"Messages all contain a similar sentiment, endorsing her wonderful personal qualities and example she always set as a woman and mother,\" Mr Davison said.\n\n\"However, it is the hundreds of messages from everyday people from all walks of life that have touched us the most.\n\n\"One of her most endearing qualities was the fact that she was loved by people from all layers of society, not for what she did, but for who she was and the way she treated people, which was the same regardless of their social status.\"\n\nHe said the title of the book about Lex Davison, Larger Than Life, fitted her as much.\n\nMrs Gaze had an enduring association with Geelong's former sprint racing trials dating to the late 1940s.\n\nShe completed a run in the family's vintage Alfa Romeo in the early 1990s.\n\nMr Davison said one of his mother's wishes had been to live to see her granddaughter Claire Greig, of Barwon Heads, drive in the new incarnation of the trials Geelong Revival 2012 and to see her grandsons Alex and Will Davison race in the Bathurst 1000 in October.\n\nShe would be at both in spirit, he said.\n\nJust Cars Geelong Revival director Nicholas Heath hailed Mrs Gaze as a legend in Australian motor sport and a keen participant in Geelong sprints.\n\n\"Many will remember her run in the 'Little' Alfa Romeo 6C Special,\" Mr Heath said.\n\n\"When you look back over the times she was running at the event over the years, you can tell she was highly competitive.\n\n\"Di's passing, after a long illness will be deeply mourned, within the motorsport community both in Australia and overseas.\"\n\nFrom there an obviously fairly recent image:"
