        "text": "Will Davison enters his fourth year with the Shell V-Power Racing Team. After a quiet season in 2023, can the two-time Bathurst winner return to victory lane in 2024?\n\nDavison returned to Dick Johnson Racing in 2021, having first left the team for Holden at the end of 2008. In 2021, he scored 10 podiums and two poles en route to fourth overall aboard the famous #17.\n\nIn 2022, he upped the ante with nine ARMOR ALL Pole Positions and three victories.\n\nThe veteran enjoyed a big step forward in 2019 coinciding with 23Red Racing’s move under the Tickford umbrella.\n\nThe two-time Bathurst winner joined Phil Munday's new team in 2018, racing an ex-Tickford Falcon out of its own base in outer Melbourne.\n\nHe finished 15th in the championship, the top driver in a single-car operation, recording eight top 10 finishes along the way. Two podiums – including a near-miss victory at Tailem Bend – helped him to eighth overall in 2019.\n\nHe hit the ground running in 2020 until dreadful luck struck, with 23Red's major sponsor withdrawing following the COVID-19 crisis, leaving him out of a seat.\n\nDavison later secured a return to Tickford in a co-driving capacity alongside Cameron Waters, and he nearly helped the #6 to a stunning Bathurst victory.\n\nHis 23Red move had followed a two-year stint with Tekno Autosports that brought Davison a second Bathurst triumph, beating Shane van Gisbergen across the line by just 0.14 seconds in 2016.\n\nHe finished fifth in the championship that year, although results would fall away in ’17.\n\nMaking his top-flight debut for Team Dynamik in ’04, his first full-time gig came two seasons later with Dick Johnson Racing.\n\nAfter clinching his first couple of race wins in a sensational ’08, he was picked up by the Holden Racing Team.\n\nHis tenure at the famous organisation would mix extreme highs with extreme lows, finishing runner-up to Jamie Whincup in ’09 before slumping to 22nd in 2010.\n\nFrom there, he swapped to the factory team across the divide – Ford Performance Racing – for three more than respectable campaigns.\n\nAn opportunity would then present itself at Erebus Motorsport, Davison taking a rare win for the Mercedes squad in ’15 before linking with Tekno."
