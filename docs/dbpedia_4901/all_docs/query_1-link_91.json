        "text": "As time and new rules overtook the 250F, owners looked outside Formula One to continue racing – until Historic events gave these old machines new life.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s the 250F Maserati had ceased to be a force in contemporary international racing, and European owners were denied even the prospect of exercising their ageing cars with the introduction of the 1500cc Grand Prix formula for 1961.\n\nBut many of the cars had already begun new careers in libre racing in remoter parts of the world, and others would soon be dusted off for the burgeoning sport of historic racing, first in Britain, and later further afield.\n\nThe non-mainstream career of the 250F rounds off our story from last month’s Motor Sport.\n\nAustralia\n\nThe two ex-works 250Fs in Australia enjoyed long careers. Reg Hunt sold his car (2516) at the beginning of 1957 to Bib Stillwell, who disposed of it two years later to Arnold Glass. Stan Jones raced the other car (2520) from 1956 to 1960, winning both the Australian Grand Prix and the national Gold Star championship in 1959.\n\nHunt had raced the ex-Schell interim car (2503) in 1955, after which it passed to Kevin Neal, who raced it until a major accident at the end of 1956.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nThe first of New Zealand’s four 250Fs was the disc-braked car (2504/2509) raced by Gavin Quirk in 1957/60, Len Gilbert in 1961 and a teenaged Chris Amon in 1962. More successful however was the ex-Moss car (2508) which raced in New Zealand as 2513 and was used by Ross Jensen to win the Gold Star in 1958. Subsequent owner/drivers of this car were Johnny Mansel (1959-1960) and Bob Eade (1961-62).\n\nJensen replaced 2508/2513 with the ex-Halford car (2509/2504) which he had fitted with Piccolo-style bodywork. After racing it in 1959 he returned it to Italy, where it became embroiled in a convoluted mix-up with another car. Jensen explained some years later that his car was fitted with a V8 Chevrolet engine and given the bodywork of Scarlatti’s 2501/2523. Now renamed the Tec-Mec, it returned to New Zealand and was raced by Mansel (1961) and Rod Coppins (1962-1963). This Tec-Mec should not, incidentally, be confused with the 1959 F1 car of the same name.\n\nAccording to Jensen the ex-Scarlatti car meanwhile acquired the engine, bodywork and chassis-plate of 2509/2504, and was raced in New Zealand by Brian Prescott 1961-1962.\n\nSouth America\n\nThe activities of the 250Fs in South America — mainly in Brazil, but also in Argentina and Uruguay – still require a great deal more research before the full picture emerges. What is known so far is, briefly, as follows.\n\nUria continued to race his A6GCM/250 until at least 1960, by which time it had been joined by Creus’s offset 250F proper (2526/30), which was raced by Antonio Versa in 1960/61 but had returned to Europe by 1964.\n\nThe offset-transmission ex-V12 car (2531) had been acquired less engine by Antonio Mendes de Barros in 1958, and was fitted with a V8 Chevrolet Corvette engine and raced by him right up until 1965, and possibly even later. The two Centro-Sud cars which were sold in 1959 also raced with V8 Chevrolet engines, and they, too, were still in action as late as 1965. The older of these two cars (2502/2511) was driven by Ciro Cayres and Nicola Papaleo, while its sister (2507/2523/2522) saw service in the hands of Luis Margarido, Arnaldo Paccini and Mario Marsiglia.\n\nThe other ex-V12 car (2530) raced with a six-cylinder 250F engine during Rugero Peruzzi’s ownership, but after Camilo Cristofaro acquired it in 1962 it, too, was equipped with an American V8.\n\nUSA\n\nThe United States got its first 250F as early as 1956, and three more were landed during the international currency of the formula. With little support for single-seater road racing in the US, however, none made much of an impact.\n\nWell-known sportscar entrant Tony Parravano acquired the 1956 Monza-winning offset car (2525) at the end of that year but before it had time to race Parravano disappeared, the car finding its way to Mexico.\n\nIn 1959 the newly-formed Camoradi USA team acquired a car (2529) from Bonnier, which raced in USAC libre events. Later the same year Maserati collector/driver Phil Cade bought the other Bonnier car (2524), and raced it in club events for a couple of years before an accident ended its career.\n\nFinally in 1960 Joe Lubin bought the fitst of the Piccolos (2533) which his driver Bob Drake raced in that year’s US Grand Prix.\n\nCade and Lubin retained their cars unused right into the 1980s, and the exCamoradi car was an exhibit in the Cunningham Museum for many years. The ex-Parravano example returned to the US in the 1960s, was sold to England and then went back to the US Several other 250Fs later went to the US as historic racing became established.\n\nHistoric Racing\n\nMaserati 250Fs started appearing in historic racing events in Britain in the mid 1960s. First out were H C Spero’s ex-Gould car (2514) and the Australian imports of Colin Crabbe (2520) and Cameron Millar (2516). Before long Richard Bergel and Patrick Lindsay bought back a pair of cars from Italy, the ex-Campbell example (2526, believed at time to be 2501 renumbered but in fact 2522/2523 renumbered) and one of the 1957 works lightweight cars (2527). They shared the first car until the newer one was ready, by which time Lindsay had sold his share in the older one to Lord Angus Clydesdale.\n\nBefore the ’60s were over, Charles Lucas had become the first real 250F star of historic racing, with his 1957 works lightweight car (2528).\n\nOver the years more and more 250Fs were returned to the circuits, so that there remain very few which have not raced in historic events at one time or another (seven of the 26 cars built, by our count). Millar campaigned several in addition to his ex-Australia car, and even built a few himself (see below). Neil Corner took over 2528, which is still in the family today, and Willie Green raced a number of cars, particularly Bamford’s 2534. Corner and Green were the star 250F drivers of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nReplicas\n\nAround 1966 Cameron Millar obtained a vast quantity of 250F parts which Spero had bought from Scuderia Centro-Sud. These he built up into two cars, using new chassis but incorporating almost entirely genuine parts. No-one had any reason to believe these were not fair claimants to the identities of 2511 and 2522, which were not at that time known to exist anywhere else. Subsequent information however means they must now be regarded as replicas.\n\nMillar later constructed ten unashamed replicas, some containing genuine parts but others not. Four of these are in 1954/56 configuration, two of 1957-lightweight type and four Piccolos. Most are admitted to at least some historic-race fields, and enough people know about the cars to render unlikely any attempt by a future owner to pass them off as genuine.\n\nNow that the events leading up to the changes in 250F numbering have been outlined, a car-by-car breakdown can be provided.\n\nA6GCM/250\n\n2501 – Roberto Mieres January 1954 — destroyed in transporter accident June 1954.\n\n2502 – destroyed in testing accident December 1953. A car with this number is in Switzerland, but has no apparent connection with any known A6GCM/250.\n\n2502 – see also 2504.\n\n2503 – Harry Schell January 1954 and raced till August. Reg Hunt acquired from factory and raced Australia 1955. To Kevin Neal 1956 but badly damaged November that year and not raced again. Imported UK mid 1960s by Colin Crabbe, raced in historic events by him, Dan Margulies and Ray Fielding (owner since 1972).\n\n2504 – Bira January/June 1954. Renumbered 2502 and sold to Jorge Daponte, later in year to Alberto Uria, who raced it in South America until at least 1960. Brought to UK 1979 by Peter Martin, on to Roger Williams early 1980s, various US owners, Peter Glasel, Germany, 1994.\n\n2510 – Emmanuel de Graffenried midyear, on to Ottorino Volonterio before end of 1954. Other Swiss owners, used regularly in hillclimbs for many years. Present owner: Walter Grell, Switzerland.\n\n250Fs\n\n2500 – see 2505.\n\n2501 – works car late 1954 through to end of 1957. In later years a test-bed for various experiments such as fuel-injection, radiator ducting etc. Rebodied mid 1956. Drivers: Francesco Godia (twice on loan), Luigi Musso (1955), Carlos Menditeguy and Jean Behra (1956/57), Stirling Moss, Cesare Perdisa, Luigi Villoresi and Joakim Bonnier 1956, Giorgio Scarlatti and Harry Schell 1957. Renumbered 2526 at end of 1957 (for one race), renumbered 2523 and sold to Maria-Teresa de Filippis 1958 (including new body midyear), Scarlatti 1959. Fitted with Piccolo-style bodywork from 2509/2504 in 1960, renumbered 2504 and sold to New Zealand, Brian Prescott 1961-63.\n\nSold c1966 to Leon Witte and subsequently to Cameron Millar UK, renumbered 2523 and raced (without Piccolo nose) in historic events. On to Chris Mann, Keith Duly (who revised the bodywork once more), Don Young USA, Peter Giddings (present owner) 1986.\n\n2502 – works-supported car for Sergio Mantovani 1954, renumbered 2511 midyear. Also driven for works by Alberto Ascari and Villoresi 1954, and by Perdisa and Clemar Bucci 1955. Scuderia CentroSud 1955-59. Rebodied before 1956 season and again before 1957. Drivers Menditeguy and Luigi Piotti 1955, Schell 1956/57, Villoresi and de Graffenried 1956. Masten Gregory 1957/58, Hans Herrmann 1957, Scarlatti, Gerino Gerini, Troy Ruttmann and de Filippis 1958, Nano da Silva Ramos, Fritz d’Orey and Jack Fairman 1959.
