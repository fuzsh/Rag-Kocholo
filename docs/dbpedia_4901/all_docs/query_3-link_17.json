        "text": "ALEX DAVISON TO TACKLE LE MANS 24 HOUR\n\nMelbourne driver Alex Davison will tackle the 24 Hours of Le Mans\n\nDavison is currently second in GT2 class in the European Le Mans Series\n\nMelbourne driver Alex Davison will contest next month's 24 Hours of Le Mans, one of the biggest races in motorsport, joining an elite club of Australians to race in the sportscar classic.\n\nDavison will make his Le Mans debut in the 14-15 June event, becoming just the 31st Australian to compete in the race - a group including his late grandfather Lex Davison - in its 75th running.\n\n\"Le Mans is one of those iconic races you dream about racing in as a kid, I can't wait to get out there,\" Davison, 27, said.\n\n\"The circuit is amazing and it's such a tough race, where getting to the end is a massive achievement itself, I'm really looking forward to the challenge.\"\n\nThe versatile Davison has vast racing experience in Australia and internationally.\n\nRunner-up in the 1999 Australian Formula Ford Championship, Davison was signed by Porsche to race overseas, competing in the Porsche Michelin Supercup and German Carrera Cup.\n\nBased in Europe, he scored wins and podium finishes at some of the world's most-famous circuits, including the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Monza and Nurburgring.\n\nDavison's efforts were recognised by the British Racing Drivers Club in 2002, when he was awarded the Bruce McLaren Trophy as the Commonwealth driver with the most-meritorious international racing achievements.\n\nIn 2004, he returned home, winning the Australian Carrera Cup Championship and has since split his time between the all-Porsche series and V8 Supercars, scoring Top 10 finishes at Bathurst in 2006 and 2007.\n\nAfter finishing second in last year's Carrera Cup Championship, Davison received an offer to become a Porsche-supported driver in Europe and relocated to Germany in February.\n\nHis primary role has been racing with Team Felbermayr-Proton in the European Le Mans Series (LMS), aboard a Porsche 911 GT3 RSR.\n\nWith team-mate Marc Lieb, Davison is currently second in the GT2 class, just one point behind the leading Ferrari F430 of Rob Bell and Gimmi Brunni, with two rounds remaining.\n\n\"Our European Le Mans Series campaign has been going really well so far,\" Davison said.\n\n\"Marc and are good mates and he was instrumental in getting me over here, it's been an easy partnership.\n\n\"We've finished second in two of the three races but had mechanical problems in the other race while running strongly.\n\n\"We're developing the car and getting closer and closer to the pace of the Ferrari, so we're feeling confident going into the last two rounds later this year.\"\n\nDavison has also contested two American Le Mans Series events, taking second in GT2 in the Sebring 12 Hour, and was seventh in the opening German Carrera Cup round at Hockenheim after receiving a last-minute call up.\n\n\"I'm really enjoying living and racing over here in Europe,\" he said.\n\n\"Who could complain about getting to race a Porsche at some of the best circuits in the world?\n\n\"I've already done more races than I was originally scheduled to do all year, so I'm just trying to make the most of each opportunity, whether it's racing or testing.\"\n\nAt Le Mans, Davison will share Team Felbermayr-Proton's #77 Porsche with Wolf Henzler and team-owner Horst Felbermayr Sr, both from Germany, in the GT2 class.\n\n\"I know the car and team well from the LMS races, and we've been competitive in GT2 all year, so hopefully we can carry some of that form over,\" Davison said.\n\n\"It's going to be a really strong field including a lot of drivers with plenty of Le Mans experience.\n\n\"Finishing the race is our first goal, if we can get onto the GT2 podium it would be a dream result.\"\n\nHis first taste of the iconic 13.629km Le Mans circuit will come this Sunday, in an official test day, before qualifying for the gruelling 24 Hour classic commences on 11 June.\n\nThe 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans takes place across Saturday 14 June and Sunday 15 June.\n\n-credit: alex davison"
