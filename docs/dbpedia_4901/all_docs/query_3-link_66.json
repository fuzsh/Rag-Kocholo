        "text": "This is the story of the original, 4.82km incarnation of the fabulous facility we now know as the 4.45km Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit. Of course, it’s essentially the same track, give or take 370 metres.\n\nBoth iterations of Australia’s finest full-time permanent motor racing track deserve their own time in the sun which is why we will treat them in separate parts, this issue and next.\n\nThe longer PI circuit that lived from the mid-1950s to the late ’70s differed from today’s layout in three key ways. Firstly, there was a longer run into (and out of) the hairpin now known as Honda Corner, with the apex sitting about 150m closer to the infield dam in PI Mk1’s days, when the corner was known as Repco.\n\nAlso, what’s now MG corner was tighter and lower than in the era when it was Lanes MG.\n\nThirdly – and probably most significantly – 1960s and ’70s racers could only dream that one day they would compete on a track with the quality of Phillip Island MkII’s surface over the last 27 years.\n\nWhat hasn’t changed are the high average lap speeds, the way the venue can bite if something goes wrong, wildly fluctuating weather patterns and the stunning setting with views of Bass Strait. Oh, and the evocatively named Siberia and all the other famous corners like Lukey Heights and MG.\n\nToday it’s home to the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix, our country’s biggest Historics meeting, the Phillip Island Classic, and 60 years of racing history.\n\nPhillip Island MkI was the birthplace of Australia’s Great Race and countless touring car endurance scraps and incidents never captured (and immortalised) by television cameras. We celebrate PI’s milestone birthday in 2016 by shining the spotlight on its first 22 years.\n\nHistory 101"
