        "text": "Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park-70 Years Young\n\nWhen local racer ‘Dicer Doug’ Whiteford from Stkilda won the 1953 Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park in his slinky French Talbot Lago T26C F1 machine, he won by a phenomenal six laps!\n\nThe first race around the lake was 70 years ago this November 21, and AUTO ACTION’S historic motorsport editor Mark Bisset looks back on a great moment in the history of the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park.\n\nImagine Max Verstappen beating Charles Leclerc by that margin today?\n\nThings have changed so much in seven decades – technology hadn’t put a man in space then, let alone on the moon.\n\nIt took the Light Car Club of Australia from 1934 to 1952 to get the government support to race in the park. That ’53 AGP was a one-dayer too!\n\nPractice, qualifying, the 50-mile 16-lap Albert Park Trophy support race, and the 200-mile 64-lap AGP were held on one day, between 8.30am and 5.30pm…to be precise.\n\nBy contrast, it took the Victorian Government’s operatives just months to swipe the AGP from their Liberal colleagues in South Australia in 1995. This year, the first set-up trucks for the four-day carnival rolled into Aughtie Drive at 7.05am on January 1.\n\nA staggering 50,000 to 70,000 people rocked up on that hot, muggy 1953 day without the vast array of entertainment options we have now. Back then it might have been a pie and chips and even a Coke, which a was pretty exotic fare back then … don’t even think of an oatmilk capuccino with your easy-over crepe!\n\nOn track, there was enough variety among the 40-car Formula Libre grid to give the F1 hierachy a near myocardial infarction, whereas today’s crushing and prescriptive F1 rules create a boring sameness of specifications to go with its undeniable speed.\n\nIt wasn’t all great back then, mind you. Half the grid comprised pre-war cars; Bugatti, Talbot Darracq, Maserati and MGs which should have been consigned to an historic race.\n\nThe balance was made up of contemporary sports cars such as: the Austin Healey 100, Allard J2 and Jaguar XK120s, Ford V8 powered Australian Specials, and new-wave mid-engined Coopers (nah, they won’t catch-on).\n\nThe genuine front-runners were Whiteford’s Lago, and Lex Davison (father of racers Jon, Richard and Chris and grandfather of Alex, Will and James) in his ex-Stirling Moss Jaguar powered English HWM.\n\nStan Jones – father of 1980 World F1 Champ Alan – raced the home-grown Charlie Dean/Repco Research developed six-cylinder Maybach, while Sydney youngster Jack Brabham took his AGP bow at the wheel of a new Cooper T23 Bristol.\n\nBack then we needed the oldsters to make up the numbers. We don’t have that problem today as the quality of grids is much better.\n\nWe have a carnival of support events now.\n\nIn 1953, the solo support Albert Park Trophy was won by Davison’s second-string Alfa Romeo P3, from Jones’ Cooper 1100, with another Melbourne car-dealer coming-man – Reg Hunt in his Allard J2 V8.\n\nThe AGP started – more or less – at the scheduled 2.30pm start time – there is no ‘more or less factor’ today given global TV commitments.\n\nAnother differentiator was that when the Australian flag dropped not all the crews had departed the grid! Fortunately all made it to the sidelines without casualty.\n\nJack Brabham and Lex Davison (four times AGP winner in 1954/57/58/61, inaugural Gold Star victor in 1957) ran bearings in their Bristol and Jaguar engines in the morning.\n\nJack didn’t take the start whilst Lex did, and led for part of the first lap before being pushed aside by his good-mate Jones before having to retire.\n\nRetirements came thick and fast – 10 cars were “hors d’ combat” before lap 15, with Jones (1954 NZ GP, 1958 Gold Star and 1959 AGP winner) in a strong lead from Whiteford (three times AGP winner in 1950/52/53) at half distance.\n\nThe Jones Boy was win-or-bust at that career stage, and pitted on lap 40 for fuel and a new water-pump drive belt – the Maybach-six was cooking!\n\nWhiteford was quickly past and into a lead he never lost. Melbourne’s weather played its part, with a downpour enlivening proceedings which caused further carnage and retirements.\n\nWhiteford caused a late-race sensation when he came into the pits on a rim with two laps to run.\n\nSuch was his lead this wasn’t a problem and he won from the MGs of Curley Brydon and Andy Brown.\n\nWhile the argument rages on between ‘aficionados’ that the first AGP was held at Goulburn in 1927, and not Philip Island in March 1928, there is no argument that the first AGP held at Albert Park was in ’53, and the first of the park’s ‘modern’ F1 era was held in 1996.\n\nSo, ‘Happy 70th Birthday’ Albert Park, long may you reign supreme as one of the great F1 venues; a unique blend of history, mystique, beauty and challenge.\n\nFor more of the latest motorsport news, pick up the latest issue of the magazine at your nearest outlet or download the latest digital edition issue of AUTO ACTION."
