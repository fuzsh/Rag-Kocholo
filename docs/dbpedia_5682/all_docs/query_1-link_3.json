        "text": "This is a list of all of the active squadrons that exist in the United States Marine Corps, sorted by type. Most squadrons have changed names and designations many times over the years, so they are listed by their current designation.\n\nTo see Marine Aviation units sorted by command hierarchy, see aviation combat element.\n\nSquadron designations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe basic tactical and administrative unit of United States Marine Corps aviation is the squadron. Fixed-wing aircraft squadrons (heavier than air) and tiltrotor squadrons are denoted by the letter \"V\", which comes from the Spanish verb \"volar\" (to fly). Rotary wing (helicopter) squadrons use \"H.\" Marine squadrons are always noted by the second letter \"M.\" Squadron numbering is not linear as some were numbered in ascending order and others took numbers from the wing or the ship to which they were assigned. From 1920 to 1941, Marine flying squadrons were identified by one digit numbers. This changed on 1 July 1941, when all existing squadrons were redesignated to a three-digit system. The first two numbers were supposed to identify the squadrons parent group but with the rapid expansion during World War II and frequent transfer of squadrons this system fell apart.[1]\n\nRotary-wing aircraft\n\n[edit]\n\nMarine Helicopter Squadron\n\n[edit]\n\nThe squadron is responsible for the helicopter transportation of the president of the United States, vice president, Cabinet members and VIPs. In addition to its VIP transport role, it is also tasked with operational test and evaluation (OT&E) of new flight systems for Marine Corps helicopters.[2] The squadron flies the VH-3D Sea King the VH-60N Whitehawk, and the MV-22 Osprey. These were due to be replaced by the VH-71 Kestrel,[3] however that program was cancelled in April 2009.[4] HMX-1 is now preparing for the arrival of the VH-92A Patriot, which will replace the VH-3D that serves as Marine One. Lastly, HMX-1 provides support to training at The Basic School, providing aerial insertion for various training events, as well as MAGTF Air component orientation to the student officers.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMX-1 Marine One 1 December 1947 Headquarters Marine Corps MCAF Quantico, VA[5]\n\nMarine Heavy Helicopter Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nHeavy helicopter squadrons were first formed in 1966 when the Marine Corps began flying the heavy lift CH-53 Sea Stallion during the Vietnam War.[6] Each squadron is equipped with sixteen CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters. Their primary role is moving cargo and equipment with the secondary role of transferring troops ashore in an amphibious assault. The CH-53Es are the most powerful helicopter in the U.S. military inventory today.[7] As part of the current reorganization of the Corps, HMH-462 will be decommissioned by 2030.[8]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMH-361 Flying Tigers 25 February 1952 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[9] HMH-461 Iron Horse 15 March 1944 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[10] HMH-462 Heavy Haulers 15 April 1944 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[11] HMH-464 Condors 5 April 1944 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[12] HMH-465 Warhorse 1 December 1981 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[13] HMH-466 Wolfpack 30 November 1984 MAG-16, 3rd MAW MCAS Miramar, CA[14] HMH-772 Hustler 15 April 1958 MAG-49, 4th MAW McGuire Air Force Base, NJ[15]\n\nMarine Heavy Helicopter Training Squadron\n\n[edit]\n\nThe squadron trains newly designated (i.e., winged) Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the CH-53E Super Stallion.[16]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMHT-302 Phoenix 1 November 1966 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[16]\n\nMarine Light Attack Helicopter Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Marine Corps’ light attack squadrons are composite squadrons made up of 18 AH-1Z Vipers and 9 UH-1Y Venoms.[17] The primary missions of the Viper is close air support, forward air control, reconnaissance and armed escort,[18] while the Huey provides airborne command and control, utility support, supporting arms coordination and medical evacuation.[19] The H-1 upgrade program will see both the AH-1 and UH-1 get greater power, improved avionics and an 85% commonality of parts.[20][21][22] The transition to the UH-1Y was completed in August 2014 when HMLA-773 flew the UH-1N for the last time. Due to the need for more light attack squadrons, the Marine Corps began adding new squadrons in 2008. HMLA-469 is the newest squadron. However, as part of the re-organization of the corps, HMLA-469 and HMLA-367 will be de-activated by 2030.[23]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMLA-167 Warriors 1 April 1968 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[24] HMLA-169 Vipers 30 September 1971 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[25] HMLA-267 Stingers 15 February 1944 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[26] HMLA-269 The Gunrunners 22 February 1977 MAG-29, 2nd MAW MCAS New River, NC[27] HMLA-367 Scarface 1 December 1943 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[28] HMLA-369 Gunfighters 1 April 1972 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[29] HMLA-773 Red Dog June 1968 MAG-49, 4th MAW Joint Base McGuire–Dix–Lakehurst, NJ[30] HMLA-775 Coyote 1 October 2016 MAG-41, 4th MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[31]\n\nMarine Light Attack Helicopter Training Squadron\n\n[edit]\n\nThe squadron trains newly designated (i.e., winged) Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the UH-1Y Venom, and the AH-1Z Viper.[32]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Commissioned Senior Command Station HMLAT-303 Atlas 30 April 1982 MAG-39, 3rd MAW MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA[32]\n\nTiltrotor Aircraft\n\n[edit]\n\nMarine Medium Tiltrotor Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nMarine tiltrotor squadrons are new units operating the MV-22 Osprey with their main mission being assault support. The Osprey offers twice the speed, five times the range, and can fly more than twice as high as the helicopters they are replacing.[33] As the Marine Corps’ number one aviation acquisition priority, the Osprey replaced the aging fleet of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters and is a cornerstone of the capstone concept of Expeditionary maneuver warfare.[34] As of October 2017, the Marine Corps has 16 Fully Operationally Capable (FOC) MV-22 squadrons. VMM-268, VMM-364, and VMM-164 reached FOC in FY16. The two newest Osprey squadrons, VMM-362 and VMM-212, will stand up in FY18 and FY19 respectively, completing the Marine Corps' transition to 18 active component MV-22 squadrons.
