The categories include: tissue enriched, group enriched, tissue enhanced, low tissue specificity and not detected.\n\nTissue enhanced (lymphoid tissue, pituitary gland) Tissue expression clusteri\n\nThe RNA data was used to cluster genes according to their expression across tissues. Clusters contain genes that have similar expression patterns, and each cluster has been manually annotated to describe common features in terms of function and specificity.\n\nSpleen - Immune response (mainly) Brain specificityi\n\nThe regional specificity category is based on mRNA expression levels in the analysed brain samples, grouped into 13 main brain regions and calculated for the three different species. All brain expression profiles are based on data from HPA. The specificity categories include: regionally enriched, group enriched, regionally enhanced, low regional specificity and not detected. The classification rules are the same used for the tissue specificity category\n\nLow human brain regional specificity Brain expression clusteri\n\nThe RNA data was used to cluster genes according to their expression across tissues. Clusters contain genes that have similar expression patterns, and each cluster has been manually annotated to describe common features in terms of function and specificity.\n\nMacrophages & Microglia - Immune response (mainly) Single cell type specificityi\n\nThe RNA specificity category is based on mRNA expression levels in the analyzed cell types based on scRNA-seq data from normal tissues. The categories include: cell type enriched, group enriched, cell type enhanced, low cell type specificity and not detected.\n\nCell type enhanced (Ionocytes, Club cells, monocytes, Basal respiratory cells, Langerhans cells) Single cell type\n\nexpression clusteri\n\nThe RNA data was used to cluster genes according to their expression across single cell types. Clusters contain genes that have similar expression patterns, and each cluster has been manually annotated to describe common features in terms of function and specificity.\n\nRespiratory epithelial cells - Unknown function (mainly) Tissue cell type classificationi\n\nGenes can have enriched specificity in different cell types in one or several tissues, or be enriched in a core cell type that appears in many different tissues.\n\nCell type enriched (Stomach - Fibroblasts)\n\nIMMUNE CELLS Immune cell specificityi\n\nThe RNA specificity category is based on mRNA expression levels in the analyzed samples based on data from HPA. The categories include: cell type enriched, group enriched, cell type enhanced, low cell type specificity and not detected.\n\nImmune cell enriched (non-classical monocyte) Immune cell\n\nexpression clusteri\n\nThe RNA data was used to cluster genes according to their expression across single cell types. Clusters contain genes that have similar expression patterns, and each cluster has been manually annotated to describe common features in terms of function and specificity.\n\nMonocytes & Neutrophils - Innate immune response (mainly)\n\nCANCER & CELL LINES Prognostic summary Prognostic marker in renal cancer (unfavorable) Renal cancer p<0.001 Cancer specificityi\n\nSpecificity of RNA expression in 17 cancer types is categorized as either cancer enriched, group enriched, cancer enhanced, low cancer specificity and not detected.\n\nLow cancer specificity Cell line\n\nexpression clusteri\n\nThe RNA data was used to cluster genes according to their expression across cell lines. Clusters contain genes that have similar expression patterns, and each cluster has been manually annotated to describe common features in terms of function and specificity.\n\nSarcoma - Muscle contraction (mainly) Cell line specificityi\n\nRNA specificity category based on RNA sequencing data from cancer cell lines in the Human Protein Atlas grouped according to type of cancer. Genes are classified into six different categories (enriched, group enriched, enhanced, low specificity and not detected) according to their RNA expression levels across the panel of cell lines.\n\nCancer enhanced (Bone cancer)\n\nPROTEINS IN BLOOD Upregulated in diseasei\n\nA gene is classified as upregulated in a disease if the average concentration of all samples of that disease is significantly higher (adj P-value<0.05) than the average concentration of samples of all diseases as measured by PEA . For gender specific diseases the analysis includes only samples corresponding to the same gender from the other diseases.\n\nMyeloma, Acute myeloid leukemia Disease prediction modeli\n\nThe disease(s) the gene is associated with and able to predict according to glmnet prediction models. To be included the gene has to be upregulated according to differential expression analysis and have more than 50% overall importance as indicated by the prediction models.\n\nNo Secretome annotationi\n\nAll genes with at least one predicted secreted isoform have been annotated and classified with the aim to determine if the corresponding protein(s) are:\n\nsecreted into blood\n\nlocally secreted\n\nor actually being attached to membrane or retained in intracellular locations like mitochondria, endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus or lysosomes.\n\nSecreted to blood Detected in blood by\n\nimmunoassayi\n\nThe blood-based immunoassay category applies to actively secreted proteins and is based on plasma or serum protein concentrations established with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, compiled from a literature search. The categories include: detected and not detected, where detection refers to a concentration found in the literature search.\n\nNo Detected in blood by\n\nmass spectrometryi\n\nDetection or not of the gene in blood, based on spectral count estimations from a publicly available mass spectrometry-based plasma proteomics data set obtained from the PeptideAtlas.\n\nYes Detected in blood by\n\nproximity extension assayi\n\nDetection or not of the gene in blood, based on proximity extension assays (Olink) for a longitudinal wellness study covering 76 individuals with three visits during two years.\n\nYes"
