        "text": "Semper Fidelis Memorial Park at the Marine Corps Heritage Center in Triangle, Virginia, near Quantico MCB sits on 23 acres and has a series of walkways with memorial bricks, commemorative benches, rally points, and monuments erected in honor of various Marine Corps units and organizations.\n\nAmong the monuments is a shiny black granite memorial to 66 members of the Marine Observation Squadron Six or VMO-6, who lost their lives in combat operations. The memorial is the shape of an aircraft wing. The wingtip has been cut off and rests on its edge on the ground with the tip to the sky. It symbolizes a disruption of flight, loss of life, and the fall back to earth to a place of rest. The tip pointing skyward indicates that the fallen still soar in the heavens above in spirit and memory. Etched on both sides is the inscription:\n\nThere are various aircraft used in the history of the squadron depicted on either side. One one side, the names of those killed in Nicaraqua 1927-1933, World War II 1941-1945, and Korea 1950-1953 are listed; the other side lists those killed in Vietnam 1965-1969.\n\nThe wingtip monument was dedicated at a ceremony held at the Semper Fi Park on May 17, 2012.\n\nThe VMO-6 has one of the longest histories of any squadron in the Marine Corps dating back to the 1920s. They were the first to test and use new aircraft and technologies often flying reconnaissance, aerial observation and resupply, and other utility missions including light artillery in support of ground troops. The VMO-6 was deactivated on January 1, 1977.\n\nReference:"
