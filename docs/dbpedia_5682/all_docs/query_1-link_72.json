        "text": "MARINE AIR ASSETS VMO-3; HML 367; & HML 167\n\nFollowing is a letter from but one of the brave Marine Pilots who supported SOG operations in Nam. It is included here so that the USMC contribution to SOG is not forgotten.\n\nToday's Pilot In Command was yesterday's CoPilot.... that way, if there was an emergency the gunships could go directly to the team/platoon/company in trouble, without having to lose time by stopping by our Launch Site for a briefing-Randy Givens\n\nMarine Light Helicopter Squadron 367 and VMO-3\n\nRobert:\n\nYesterday I spoke with a squadron mate that I had erroneously believed had been KIA in 1969 on his second tour. It was a fluke that his son, a Penn state highway patrol trooper had written to my old CO, Colonel Nelson, still hanging on to life asking about some of the \"Klondikes\" in our association. When he relayed to his dad that I was alive and well, his father couldn't believe it...not having had any contact since leaving country in '68. Then out of the blue, I got this call yesterday--at first believing that it was a horribly crude and tasteless practical joke. Well it wasn't. The name I had off the wall was ANOTHER Marine Major by the same name and with the same MOS and our sister squadron, which fit the whole picture, but wrong focus! Anyway, you could have heard the tears falling even over the phones--what a wonderful gift!\n\nAnd somehow, during that whole hour-long phone reunion, the SOG mission arose--and he's another one of those few Marines who had the privilege of fighting with the SOG warriors in the '67 time frame--when the Corps disavowed and disallowed our mission or efforts. He ended up as the Group Awards Officer and confirmed to me that there was an unwritten policy NEVER to admit or pursue any SOG awards in those days--it just wasn't politically allowed! Still, almost unbelieving, I asked him if he remembered the one single thing I had asked him to do for me--besides ship my foot locker home when I left country on 12.31.67--and he immediately answered, \"yes...I still do, but I still don't know why\"...he was one of two men I had swear to me not to process any personal citations or awards for doing my duty with brother Marines. Of course, \"swapping\" those for in-country R&R's down to the Delta Med setup with cold beer and hot showers and lovely nurses to render \"first aid\" was much more of a \"reward\" for me back then...but he still remembers exactly what and how I had turned down a number of writeups. Today, in perspective, he and I both agree that had I received even some of those, especially this one that the CO wanted so badly and the PH that never got put in for--when push came to shove years later, I would more than likely have been allowed to stay in or at least transfer to another branch so as to serve out my 20 and giving full use of my experience and background. I was too damned stupid and idealistic to realize what would happen when the Corps shrank from 320,000 back to 185,000! And even for me, the 21.5% disability was totally inadequate in exchange for 12.5 years of my hard-earned service...no retirement, no pension, no shit!\n\nBut this is not why I write this...I simply needed to include on final attachment...it is the true story and revelation of who and what Kimo Andrews believed in--and still believes. That is why I can face the graves and The Wall of the Missing at Punchbowl in Hawaii without shame and knowing that I did not break faith or dishonor theirs--or of men like your brother's sacrifices--for my personal gain or aggrandizement--that is why I can live with myself today.\n\nSend it on, please, so Steve and Major Alexander can at least know where I am coming from...both Senators Akaka and Inouye know me personally well enough from decades of family and personal relationships, that these words need not be said to them--but others who have not served with me may not understand unless they read them too. They may choose not to believe them--but that's their problem--it is the truth regardless of anything else. It is my honor on the line, and more so, it is the only way I can reconcile the war and my part in it. Maybe that's why fellow pilots and crewchiefs and even \"snuffy\" gunners still maintain contact and fellowship with me after 30+ years--I'd still use my last round, my last gallon, and even my last drop of blood to come in after them...Semper Fi is two words...ALWAYS Faithful...not just when it's convenient or easy.\n\nWell enough of this \"preaching\" for now...sorry to get up on such a soapbox...but not sorry for the way it is with me.\n\n(A part that probably was not recorded was when we at MLT-2 used our Army assets to pull III Force Recon units out of a pile of shit, because there were no USMC air units to do that job. Seems to me I remember an Army Huey landing at MLT-2 with a large chunk of its tail rotor missing as a result of frag from an RPG.)-Randy Givens\n\nDuring my time with HML 367 out of Phu Bai, Sep 69 through Dec 69 we provided two gunships everyday to SOG as the Eagleclaw flight to lead the missions that launched usually from MLT 2. On Dec 16 we moved to Marble and rarely flew SOG after that. HML 167 took our place on the mission after that. I was told when I was first briefed on the Prairie Fire mission that we had been flying it for at least two years prior to my arrival.\n\nThe statement that we didn't do \"out of country missions\" after summer of 1968 is just plain wrong and a similar statement appears on John Plaster's two books on SOG.\n\nWe occasionally flew SOG with the Cobras and one notable mission was the Tailwind Operation which was led by HML 367.\n\nMark Austin Byrd\n\nScarface 47, aka \"Eagle Claw\"\n\nMark Austin Byrd -SCULPTORS\n\nwww.markbyrd.com\n\nwww.valorremembered.org\n\nScarface 68-69"
