        "meta_description": "VMO-6 was the first combat helicopter unit of the Marine Corps. After World War II, VMO-6 was moved to China for 15 months to report on Communist Chinese operations and support U.S. operations within the country.  In 1947, VMO-6 then moved to California’s Camp Pendleton until the outbreak of the Korean War.\n\t\n\tThe black granite monument is shaped like an airfoil cross-section, and has all 66 names of crew members killed during conflicts. It also displays the figures of 7 aircraft used by VMO-6. The wing has been severed at its tip and rests on its edge appearing to rise from the ground.  This depicts the disruption of flight, the loss of life, and our eventual fall to a place of rest back on earth.  While the base of the wing is earthbound, its tip projects skyward, suggesting the desire to rise again to the heavens. The cost of this monument was $70,000.\n\t\n\tThis Marine Observation Squadron Six (VMO-6) memorial is part of the 1.07 mile walking trail in Semper Fidelis Memorial Park at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, Virginia. Semper Fidelis Memorial Chapel is located next to Semper Fidelis Memorial Park. The trail covers Old Kings Highway (c. 1650-1735) built by order of Charles II of England. This route required colonial governors to create a main road which connected Charleston, South Carolina to Boston, Massachusetts. Semper Fidelis Park is next to the Marine Corps Museum, Prince William County Locust Shade Park, and Marine Corps Base Quantico. The National Museum of the Marine Corps is at 18900 Jefferson Davis Highway (U. S. Route 1).\n\t\n\tCourtesy Dwayne &amp; Maryanne Moyers, Realtors\n\t<a href=\"http://www.TheMoyersTeam.com\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.TheMoyersTeam.com</a>",
