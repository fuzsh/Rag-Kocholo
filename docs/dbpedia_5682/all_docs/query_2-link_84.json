        "text": "Target Vitelline membrane outer layer protein 1 (VMO1) Reactivity Human Tested Applications ELISA Recommended dilutions Optimal dilutions/concentrations should be determined by the end user. Storage Shipped at 4 °C. Upon receipt, store the kit according to the storage instruction in the kit's manual. Validity The validity for this kit is 6 months. Stability The stability of the kit is determined by the rate of activity loss. The loss rate is less than 5% within the expiration date under appropriate storage conditions. To minimize performance fluctuations, operation procedures and lab conditions should be strictly controlled. It is also strongly suggested that the whole assay is performed by the same user throughout.

Kit Components The kit components listed are for reference only. The product manual may differ slightly. The product should be used as stated on the product manual included and delivered together with the product.\n\nPre-coated 96-Well Microplate\n\nStandard\n\nStandard Diluent Buffer\n\nWash Buffer\n\nDetection Reagent A\n\nDetection Reagent B\n\nDiluent A\n\nDiluent B\n\nTMB Substrate\n\nStop Solution\n\nPlate Sealer\n\nMaterial Required But Not Provided\n\n37°C incubator\n\nMulti and single channel pipettes and sterile pipette tips\n\nSquirt bottle or automated microplate washer\n\n1.5 ml tubes\n\nDistilled water\n\nAbsorbent filter papers\n\n100 ml and 1 liter graduated cylinders\n\nMicroplate reader (wavelength: 450 nm)\n\nELISA Shaker\n\nSample Collection/Preparation\n\nSerum: Samples should be collected into a serum separator tube. Coagulate the serum by leaving the tube undisturbed in a vertical position overnight at 4°C or at room temperature for up to 60 minutes. Centrifuge at approximately 1000 × g for 20 min. Analyze the serum immediately or aliquot and store at -20°C or -80°C.\n\nPlasma: Collect plasma using heparin or EDTA as an anticoagulant. Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 1000 × g within 30 minutes of collection. Assay immediately or aliquot and store at -20°C or -80°C. Avoid hemolysis and high cholesterol samples.\n\nTissue homogenates: The preparation of tissue homogenates will vary depending upon tissue type – this is just an example. Rinse tissues with ice-cold PBS to remove the excess of blood. Weigh before homogenization. Finely mince tissues and homogenize with a tissue homogenizer on ice in PBS and sonicate the cell suspension. Centrifuge the homogenates at 5000 × g for 5 min and collect the supernatant. Assay immediately or aliquot and store at -20°C.\n\nReagent Preparation This procedure is provided for reference only. The product manual may differ slightly. The product should be used as stated on the product manual included and delivered together with the product.\n\n1) Standard: Prepare the standard with the recommended volume of Standard Diluent Buffer, to make the standard solution. Then use the Standard Diluent buffer to carry out serial dilutions of the standard solution, as instructed in the Protocol.\n\n2) Wash Buffer: Dilute the concentrated Wash Buffer with distilled water, as instructed in the Protocol.\n\n3) Detection Reagent Preparation: Calculate the total volume of working solution required. Dilute Detection Reagent A and Detection Reagent B with Diluent A and Diluent B, respectively, at 1:100.\n\nAssay Procedure This procedure is provided for reference only. The product manual may differ slightly. The product should be used as stated on the product manual included and delivered together with the product.\n\n1) Set standard, test samples and control wells.\n\n2) Aliquot 100 µl of diluted standard into the standard wells.\n\n3) Aliquot 100 µl of Standard Diluent buffer into control (zero) well.\n\n4) Aliquot 100 µl of diluted samples into the sample wells. Incubate for 1 hr at 37 °C.\n\n5) Aliquot 100 µl of Detection Reagent A to each well. Incubate for 1 hr at 37 °C.\n\n6) Wash 3 times.\n\n7) Aliquot 100 µl of Detection Reagent B to each well. Incubate for 90 mins at 37 °C.\n\n8) Wash 5 times.\n\n9) Aliquot 90 µl of TMB Substrate to each well. Incubate for 10-20 mins at 37 °C.\n\n10) Aliquot 50 µl of Stop Solution.\n\n11) Measure the OD at 450 nm.\n\nAvailability Shipped within 5-12 working days."
