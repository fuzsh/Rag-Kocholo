It was to be the \"eyes\" for Marine Artillery units in the Pacific. The squadron was redesignated Marine Observation Squadron 3 in 1944. The squadron flew many hazardous spotting missions at Peleliu, and later, at Okinawa, earned the Presidential Unit Citation. After the war, VMO-3 served in Northern China, before relocating, first to Guam, and later to Cherry Point, North Carolina, where the squadron was deactivated in 1949.\n\nIn 1966, the Marine Corps received permission to activate two \"temporary war-time only\" VMOs. VMO-3 was reactivated at Camp Pendleton in August, and was on its way to Vietnam by December. VMO-3 flew its UH-1E Hueys from Hue/Phu Bai and MCAF Marble Mountain as part of 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. In 1968, with the addition of the OV-10A \"Bronco\" to the VMO inventory, the decision was made to remove the UH-1 from the VMOs and create three Light Helicopter Squadrons (HMLs). Instead of deactivation, VMO-3 and its sister squadron VMO-5 (UH-1 training squadron based at Camp Pendleton) were redesignated. VMO-3 became HML-367.\n\nLINEAGE\n\n1943 - 1949\n\nActivated 1 December 1943 at Quantico, Virginia, as (Artillery Spotting Division) Marine Observation Squadron 351.\n\nRedesignated 15 January 1944 as Marine Observation Squadron 3.\n\nDeployed during January - March 1944 to Espiritu Santo and assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 11, Marine Air South Pacific.\n\nParticipated in the following World War II campaigns\n\nPELELIU\n\nOKINAWA\n\nRedeployed during September - October 1945 to Tientsin, China and assigned to the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nParticipated in the Occupation of North China, October 1945 - June 1947.\n\nRedeployed during July 1947 to Orote, Guam, and reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 24.\n\nRedeployed during February 1949 to Agana, Guam.\n\nRelocated during May 1949 to Cherry Point, North Carolina and reassigned to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nDeactivated 20 August 1949 at Cherry Point, North Carolina.\n\n1966 -1968\n\nReactivated 1 August 1966 at Camp Pendleton, California, as Marine Observation Squadron 3 and assigned to Marine Wing Support Group 37, 3d Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nDeployed during December 1966 to Hue/Phu Bai and reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 16, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nParticipated in the war in Vietnam December 1966 to March 1968, operating from\n\nHue/Phu Bai\n\nMarble Mountain\n\nRedesignated 24 March 1968 as Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 367\n\nHONORS\n\nPRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION STREAMER with three bronze stars\n\nWorld War II\n\nOkinawa - 1945\n\nVietnam\n\n1965 - 1967\n\n1967\n\n1968\n\nNAVY UNIT COMMENDATION STREAMER\n\nVietnam\n\n1968\n\nASIATIC-PACIFIC CAMPAIGN STREAMER with two bronze stars\n\nWORLD WAR II VICTORY STREAMER\n\nNAVY OCCUPATION SERVICE STREAMER with ASIA clasp\n\nCHINA SERVICE STREAMER\n\nNATIONAL DEFENSE SERVICE STREAMER\n\nVIETNAM SERVICE STREAMER with three bronze stars\n\nVIETNAM CROSS of GALLANTRY STREAMER with PALM\n\nVIETNAM MERITORIOUS UNIT CITATION CIVIL ACTIONS STREAMER\n\nThese honors were inherited by HML-367.\n\nNicknames: \"Scarface\"\n\nID Code: AA 1946-47; AA 1947-49; VT 1966-68\n\nAircraft: OY-1 (WW2); AE-1*; SBD-5**; UH-1E\n\nSquadron Web Pages:\n\n* These were assigned to VMOs to make up a shortage of aircraft while refitting.\n\n** According to Navy listings, VMO-3 carried 1 SBD-5 on strength from Aug 1944 through mid-Apr 45."
