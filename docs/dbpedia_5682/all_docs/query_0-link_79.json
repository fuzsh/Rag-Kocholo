In 1952, the squadron received its first helicopters, Kaman HOK-1s. From this date, until 1971, the squadron would operate both fixed-wing and helos together. During this period, VMO-1 was the first squadron to operate the HO5S, HOK, UH-1E, UH-1N, and the AH-1J. During the Korean War, VMO-1 trained personnel headed for combat, as well as supporting the 2d Marine Division at home.\n\nIn March 1964, VMO-1 became the first USMC squadron to operate the turbine-powered UH-1E \"Huey\". Later that month two VMO-1 Hueys rescued a party of road engineers from hostile Indians in Peru. In 1965, VMO-1 supported the US intervention in the Dominican Republic. Later that year, the squadron transferred out all of its O-1C \"Birdogs\", and became an all-helicopter squadron.\n\nIn July 1968, VMO-1 began operating the OV-10A \"Bronco\". VMO-1 transferred all its helicopters in February 1971 and became a fixed-wing squadron again. During the late 1970s, the squadron began rotating detachments with VMO-2 to Okinawa to support Marines in the Far East. In 1980 the first OV-10D arrived, giving the squadron increased reconaissance capabilities. Throughout the 1980s VMO-1 continued to support exercises in the Caribbean, Northern Europe, and the Mediterranean. VMO-1 was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation during this period for supporting drug interdiction missions.\n\nIn December 1990, VMO-1 embarked its OV-10s aboard USS America and USS Theodore Roosevelt to deploy to Kuwait in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm. The squadron flew over 1000 combat sorties, losing one crew to enemy action (1 KIA, 1 POW). VMO-1 was deactivated 28 July 1993 (Ref. Complete History at reference - http://hma1369.tripod.com/vmo1.html).\n\nMarine Observation Squadron 1 (VMO-1) was an observation squadron of the United States Marine Corps which saw extensive action during World War II and supported numerous contingencies during the Cold War. They were based at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina and saw their final deployment in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991. They were deactivated on July 31, 1993 (Ref. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMO-1).\n\n(ASD)VMO-155\n\nWW 2 1950s-60s OV-10s\n\nVMO-2 was activated at Quantico, Virginia on 1 November 1943, with the designation (Artillery Spotting Division) VMO-251. After an initial training period with their OY \"Grasshopper\" aircraft, VMO-251 departed for San Diego, where it carried out more training. In January 1944 the squadron was redesignated VMO-2, and in February, moved to Hawaii. In Hawaii, VMO-2 trained with the 2d Marine Division. VMO-2 deployed to Saipan in June, flying in support of 2d Marine Division operations there, and at Tinian. During March and April 1945, VMO-2 flew spotting missions on Okinawa before being ordered back to Saipan. From September 1945 to January 1946, VMO-2 was attached to Marine Observation Group 1, and performed occupation duties in Japan. The squadron then relocated to Cherry Point*, and deactivated 26 August 1946.\n\nVMO-2 was reactivated at Santa Ana, California, on 15 June 1951. Besides the OY-2 and OE-1 fixed-wing aircraft, the squadron also operated a mixture of light helicopters, including the HOK/OH-43D, HO5S-1, and HTL-4/5. In July 1953, VMO-2 deloyed to Camp Gifu, Japan. Three years later the squadron moved to Camp Sukiran, Okinawa. In October 1960 VMO-2 moved to new quarters at Futenma, Okinawa.\n\nVMO-2 began operations in Vietnam with a small detachment of OE-1 (O-1B) \"Birdogs\" which were attached to Operation Shufly in 1962. In 1965, the entire squadron deployed to Vietnam. All its OH-43s and O-1s were left in Okinawa, and the squadron began to fly the UH-1E. In 1968, VMO-2 began operating the first OV-10A \"Broncos\" in Vietnam. In 1969 squadron capabilities were increased with the addition of the AH-1G \"Cobra\". All the squadron's helicopters were transferred out to other units in 1969, leaving only the OV-10s. VMO-2 remained in Vietnam until April 1971, when it relocated to MCALF Camp Pendleton.\n\nVMO-2 was busy during the 1970s and 1980s, supporting the 1st Marine Division and 3d Marine Aircraft Wing at home, while rotating detachments to Okinawa to support MAG-36 operations there. In 1990, VMO-2 deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm. The squadron's OV-10As and Ds flew the entire distance From California to Kuwait. During the combat in Kuwait, VMO-2 lost one aircraft and crew (2 POW). Following its return to Camp Pendleton in 1991, the squadron began transferring all its OV-10As. In December 1992, VMO-2 finished its final Okinawa deployment. VMO-2 was deactivated 23 May 1993 at Camp Pendleton, ending nearly 50 years of service (Ref.

It was to be the \"eyes\" for Marine Artillery units in the Pacific. The squadron was redesignated Marine Observation Squadron 3 in 1944. The squadron flew many hazardous spotting missions at Peleliu, and later, at Okinawa, earned the Presidential Unit Citation. After the war, VMO-3 served in Northern China, before relocating, first to Guam, and later to Cherry Point, North Carolina, where the squadron was deactivated in 1949.\n\nIn 1966, the Marine Corps received permission to activate two \"temporary war-time only\" VMOs. VMO-3 was reactivated at Camp Pendleton in August, and was on its way to Vietnam by December. VMO-3 flew its UH-1E Hueys from Hue/Phu Bai and MCAF Marble Mountain as part of 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. In 1968, with the addition of the OV-10A \"Bronco\" to the VMO inventory, the decision was made to remove the UH-1 from the VMOs and create three Light Helicopter Squadrons (HMLs). Instead of deactivation, VMO-3 and its sister squadron VMO-5 (UH-1 training squadron based at Camp Pendleton) were redesignated. VMO-3 became HML-367 (Ref. Complete History at reference - http://hma1369.tripod.com/vmo3.html).\n\nThese were assigned to VMOs to make up a shortage of aircraft while refitting.\n\n**According to Navy listings, VMO-3 carried 1 SBD-5 on strength from Aug 1944 through mid-Apr 45.\n\nOrigins during WWII\n\nHMLA-367 has a long and distinguished record in the United States Marine Corps. Its historical lineage can be traced back to December 1, 1943 when it was activated at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia as Marine Observation Squadron 351 (VMO-351) which was assigned to the Artillery Spotting Division.\n\nIn January 1944, the squadron was re-designated as and deployed to Marine Aircraft Group 11 on the island of Espiritu Santo whereupon it took part in the campaigns on Peleliu and Okinawa. The squadron participated in the occupation of North China from October 1945 through June 1947 and was relocated in 1949 to MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina and assigned to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. The Squadron, having served honorably throughout the Pacific Theater, was deactivated on August 20, 1949.\n\nAs the United States increased its presence in the Republic of Vietnam, the Marine Corps reactivated VMO-3 at Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton on August 1, 1966 and assigned it to Marine Aircraft Group 37. The squadron arrived in Vietnam in December 1966 and were now flying the UH-1E. VMO-3 became fully operational at Huế/Phu Bai on 16 January 1967 (Ref. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMLA-367).\n\n(ASD)VMOVMO-3\n\nWW 2 Alternate version - National Geographic 1944 Vietnam\n\nVMO-4 was activated on 20 December 1943 at Quantico, VA. It initially carried the designation (ASD)VMO-951, but this was changed to VMO-4 on 15 January 1944. The squadron began initial VMO-training at Quantico, then moved to the West Coast for advanced training prior. Further training took place in Hawaii with the 4th Marine Division, then VMO-4 deployed with the Division and participated in the assault and capture of Saipan and Tinian.\n\nAfter refitting in Hawaii, VMO-4 sailed for Guam in January 1945 in preparation for the Iwo Jima operation. VMO-4 flew missions over Iwo Jima from 26 February to 19 March 1945, then returned to Hawaii, where it remained through the end of the war. After the war's end, VMO-4 relocated to San Diego, and deactivated on 21 October 1945. The squadron had earned a Presidential Unit Citation (Saipan/Tinian operations) and a Navy Unit Commendation (Iwo Jima), in addition to the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Streamer with two bronze stars, and the World War Two Victory Streamer.\n\nOn 1 September 1962, VMO-4 was reactivated at Grosse Ile, Michigan, as a squadron within the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing, Marine Air Reserve Training Command. The squadron was initially equipped with SH/UH-34Ds shared with the Navy Reserve squadrons at Grosse Ile, but later got it's own aircraft.\n\nIn 1972, the helos were replaced by OV-10A \"Broncos\". VMO-4 relocated to Detroit in 1973, then moved again in 1976 to Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nDuring the first Gulf War (1990-91), VMO-4 was activated for possible deployment and attached to MAG-29, but ended up not deploying. On 1 March 1994, the last Marine Observation Squadron, VMO-4 was deactivated at Atlanta (Ref. Complete History at reference - http://hma1369.tripod.com/vmo4.html).\n\nMarine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 4 (VMU-4) is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) squadron in the United States Marine Corps that operates the RQ-7B Shadow. It is the fourth UAV squadron in the Marine Corps and the first in the reserve component. The squadron, nicknamed the Evil Eyes, entered the force structure on July 1, 2010, when Marine Observation Squadron 4 (VMO-4) was reactivated and redesignated VMU-4.\n\nThe squadron inherited the history of VMO-4 which was an observation squadron that saw extensive action during World War II. They were last based at Naval Air Station Atlanta near Atlanta, Georgia and were deactivated on May 23, 1993 as part of the post-Cold War drawdown of forces. VMU-4 is a subordinate unit of Marine Air Control Group 48 and the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing (Ref. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMU-4).\n\nVMO-951 VMO-4\n\nWW2 1960s\n\nvia \"Mule\" Holmberg OV-10\n\nVMO-5 was activated 15 February 1944 at Quantico, VA. The squadron trained for three months with their new OY \"Grasshoppers\" before leaving for the West Coast. Four months were spent training at Camp Pendleton, followed by another five months in Hawaii. In January 1945 VMO-5 divided into two groups and proceeded to Iwo Jima, staging through Guam and Saipan on the way. On 19 February the squadron arrived at Iwo Jima and by the 28th all its aircraft were ashore. In March, VMO-5 returned to Hawaii, where they saw the end of the war. Following a brief period of occupation duty at Sasebo, Japan, VMO-5 relocated to San Diego and was deactivated 31 January 1946.\n\nOn 15 December 1966, Sub Unit 1, H&MS-30, the UH-1E training unit based at Camp Pendleton, was redesignated VMO-5. During the next two years, VMO-5 continued to train new UH-1 pilots, as well as those transitioning from other types. Before deactivating, VMO-5 became the OV-10A training squadron as well. On 15 March 1968 VMO-5 was redesignated HML-267.\n\nActivated 15 February 1944 at Quantico, VA, as Marine Observation Squadron 5, VMO-5, at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, Virginia on February 15, 1944 (Ref.

Redesignated 15 March 1968 as Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 267 (Ref. Complete History at reference - http://hma1369.tripod.com/vmo5.html).\n\nMarine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 267 (HMLA-267) is a United States Marine Corps helicopter squadron consisting of AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters and UH-1Y Huey utility helicopters. The squadron is based at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 39 (MAG-39) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW).\n\nVietnam\n\nWith the looming Vietnam War, the subunit of Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 30 (H&MS-30) at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton was redesignated as VMO-5 on December 15, 1966 becoming a full fledged training squadron. They originally fell under the command of Marine Helicopter Training Group 30 under the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing and were equipped with a complement of UH-1E \"Huey\"s and OV-10 \"Bronco\"s.[1] In March 1968, the squadron was redesignated HML-267 and remained at alert status and training replacement pilots and crew for the rest of the war. In 1971, reorganization left the squadron with only UH-1E helicopters, and by the end of 1976 only UH-1N aircraft were flown.\n\nEvery six months HML-267 rotated one-third of its assets to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma on Okinawa, Japan. The Hueys were joined by another aircraft in 1982 as the new AH-1J \"Cobra\"s were deployed. As part of the Unit Deployment Program (UDP) starting in 1983, HML-267 began a regular cycle of six months in Okinawa, 18 months on Camp Pendleton. During which the squadron participated in numerous training exercises including detachments to Korea, Guam, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Iwo Jima, and Australia. Redesignated HMLA-267 in 1987, the squadron received its first complement of AH-1 Cobra \"SuperCobra\"s. In 1988, the squadron split into three groups: A detachment on land in Okinawa, A detachment on a West Pac, and A detachment aboard the USS Dubuque (Ref. Complete History at reference - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMLA-267).\n\nVMO-5\n\nWW2 1966-68\n\nMarine Observation Squadron 6 (VMO-6) traces it history to 1 December 1920, when Flight E, 3d Air Squadron was activated at Quantico, VA. Within the next seven years the squadron underwent a series of re-designations (Division 1, VF-1M; Division 1, VO-3M; Division 1, VO-6M) as new aircraft were assigned. VO-6M was assigned to the East Coast Expeditionary Force in 1927 and deployed to Nicaragua the following year. During 1928, VO-6M carried out counter-insurgency operations against the Sandinista forces until 1 September 1928, when the squadron was administratively relocated to Quantico (Squadron designation and colors only; personnel and aircraft remained in Nicaragua).\n\nFrom 1930 to 1933, the squadron was engaged in training new pilots and mechanics, flying support for the Marine Corps schools at Quantico, and flying daily fire patrols for the Virginia Forest Service. In 1931, a flight demonstration team, the \"Helldivers\", was formed, and began performing at airshows as far away as Montreal and Cleveland.\n\nIn 1933, budget cuts led to a reduction in the number of Marine Corps aviation squadrons, and on 30 June 1933, VO-6M was deactivated.\n\nWorld War Two saw the reactivation of Marine Observation Squadron 6. The \"new\" squadron was assigned to support the 6th Marine Division during the upcoming Okinawa operation. VMO-6 moved to San Diego, then to Hawaii, before embarking for Okinawa. From March through July 1945, VMO-6 participated in the Okinawa operation, flying from the Yontan airstrip. This would be the squadron's base until the end of the war.\n\nIn October 1945, VMO-6 deployed to Northern China to provide aerial reconaissance for Marine units operating there. VMO-6 relocated to Camp Pendleton in 1947.\n\nWith the start of the Korean War in 1950, VMO-6 was assigned to the 1st Provisional Brigade. Helicopters and crews were sent out from HMX-1 and joined the squadron. Over the next five years, VMO-6 performed numerous missions including artillery spotting, reconaissance, and search and rescue. VMO-6 helicopters performed countless medevac missions.\n\nVMO-6 returned to Camp Pendleton in 1955. This would be its home for the next five years. In 1962, a detachment deployed in support of the Cuban Crisis operations; it was recalled before reaching the East Coast.\n\nVMO-6 went to war again, deploying to South Vietnam in August 1965. At this time the squadron was operating UH-1E \"Hueys\"; in 1968, O-1C \"Bird Dogs\" were added, along with the OV-10A \"Bronco\". In 1967, Capt. Stephen W. Pless and his crew extracted four soldiers, under fire, from a beach where they were about to be overrun. For their heroism, Pless's crew were awarded the Navy Cross, while Pless was awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nIn 1969, VMO-6 relocated to Okinawa as part of the drawdown of troops from Vietnam. The squadron supported the 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade and 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (Rear), and took part in numerous training exercises.
