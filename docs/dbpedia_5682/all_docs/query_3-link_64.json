Registered N176RR; reregistered Registered N176RD; cancelled 12Jun13 On September 30, 2005 the aircraft impacted an earth berm during a forced landing in Arcadia, Florida. The airplane was destroyed. The flight originated from Arcadia Municipal Airport, Arcadia, Florida, earlier that day. The pilot stated that the annual inspection had recently been completed and he was flying the airplane to the North Perry Airport located in Pembroke Pines, Florida. At an altitude of 2,000 feet and after about 15 minutes en route, he noticed light colored smoke coming from and just above the right exhaust stack. He noticed the engine temperature rising shortly thereafter, followed by the engine oil metal chip detector light illuminating. The engine started producing unusual noises and a violent vibration followed. He looked for a suitable area to make a forced landing and elected to land on a gravel road with a canal running alongside it. About 150 feet into the landing roll, the right wing tip struck a high berm. The airplane snapped to the right as the nose of the airplane went partially into the canal. The aft section of the empennage partially separated and came to a stop, next to the left forward side of the airplane. Examination of the airplane's engine by a FAA inspector showed that the engine's oil system was contaminated with metal flakes. Pieces of silver and copper colored metal were observed in the oil filter. Metal chunks of approximately 1/8 to ¼ inches were found on the metal chip detector. The silver metal debris is consistent with material from the master rod bearing. 140077 (MSN 226-25) Assigned to NAS Pensacola, FL. W/o 4Feb70 140078/140102 Cessna OE-2 MSN 37000/37024.

On the evening of 18Oct63, a Federal Aviation Agency radio station operator on Vulcan Mountain near Julian, California, heard a low-flying aircraft and took a compass azimuth of the plane's direction. After hearing that a VMO-6 plane was missing, he notified Camp Pendleton. Military aircraft had begun searching along the last known flight path of the missing airplane shortly after the OE became overdue, but low visibility restricted their flight operations. The next morning 1st Reconnaissance Battalion Marines searched the rugged mountains for the missing airplane. Under the guidance offered by the FAA operator, the search party finally located the wreckage and the body of the pilot. He had been killed when his plane crashed into a 3,000-foot ridge near Vulcan Peak during a mountain storm. SOC at Camp Pendleton 20Oct63. 140089 (MSN 37011) Accepted by USAF 7Dec55 as 54-1652.

While taking off from the skiway at Wilkes Station Antarctica the Neptune caught fire and crashed. Of the nine men on board, only four survived. An investigation of the crash reported the cause as a collision with the ground following an intense, uncontrollable fire in the landing gear - bomb bay fuel tank area. The previous landing had been so violently rough that it had broken loose the 400 gal internal tank in the bomb bay and the 4\" filler pipe was spewing out raw fuel running down the bottom of the plane on take-off. At the ignition of the JATO on the t/o run, it acted like a Roman Candle. With the burning of the fiberglass tail cone, all of the acrid smoke was drawn right up to the cockpit and the pilots were blinded. They tried to return to the field and just couldn't make it. The pilot managed to level the wings before they hit and that saved some of the guys. 5 killed, 4 injured. 140440 Lockheed P2V-7U Neptune MSN 726-7099.

The pilot stated that as he was reducing to climb power after takeoff, about 200 feet above ground level, he felt severe vibration and heard several \"bangs.\" He reported that the engine \"wound down\". He made a slight left turn toward an open field adjacent to a barn to set up for a gear-up forced landing. He noted that the touchdown was smooth and the aircraft slid for approximately 335 feet. The aircraft yawed as it slid and came to a stop when the tail struck a ditch adjacent to a roadway. A post-accident examination determined that the #4 articulating rod had failed resulting in the engine failure. 140462 (MSN 226-39) To MASDC as 5T0023 Nov 22, 1974.

The gear down was selected and the gear extension appeared normal to the pilot. The pilot stated that all gears appeared down and locked. Several eye witnesses stated that the nose gear was not locked in the down position. Many of the witnesses called for the aircraft to go-around, but this call was received too late for the pilot to initiate this action. The nose gear locked in the down position after the propeller struck the runway seven times. During an inspection of the nose gear assembly the maintenance personnel discovered that the nose gear push pull rods were out of adjustment. This resulted in the nose gear not being able to fully extend. On February 21, 2002 the aircraft sustained substantial damage during a forced landing following a loss of engine power near Fredericksburg, Texas. The flight originated from Caldwell, Texas. The pilot reported that the airplane was topped with 155 gallons of fuel at Levelland, Texas. Subsequently, the airplane was flown cross-country for 1 hour 25 minutes to the destination of Caldwell, Texas. The airplane was not fueled at Caldwell, and the flight departed for Fredericksburg. During the descent to the Fredericksburg Gillespie County Airport, the engine lost total power. The pilot landed the airplane, gear retracted, in a rough field approximately 4 nautical miles east of the destination airport. Substantial damage occurred to the firewall, cowling, and fuselage. The engine and propeller were damaged. During inspection, approximately 12 ounces of fuel was drained from the airplane. The integrity of the fuel system was not compromised. 140529 (MSN 226-106) Assigned to NAS Pensacola, FL. SOC 19Apr78 140530 (MSN 226-107) Assigned to NAS Pensacola, FL.

A witness, who was a friend of the pilot, was at a racing facility with a motorcycle racing team that the pilot owned. The accident airplane performed a low pass over the area, reversed direction, and initiated a barrel roll during the second pass. The witness stated that the airplane started to climb before the barrel roll, but it wasn't enough and he knew the airplane would not have enough altitude to complete the maneuver. The airplane subsequently collided with trees and terrain. The pilot and passenger [his mother] were killed. 140532 (MSN 226-109) with VT-6 at NAS Whiting Field, FL. To MASDC as 5T0025 Dec 2, 1974.

The airplane sustained substantial damage, and the pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured. The purpose of the flight was a 15 minute performance of aerobatic and non-aerobatic maneuvers by 6 pilots of the Trojan Horsemen Demonstration Team (Trojan Horseman) for Thunder Over the Blue Ridge Open House and Air Show at MRB. The accident flight occurred during the single performance of the Trojan Horsemen that day. The pilot of the accident airplane was the No. 6 position for the Trojan Horsemen demonstration. As part of the flight, the Nos. 5 and 6 airplanes were to complete an opposing pass, crossing at show center at an altitude of 500 feet with smoke on, with an aileron roll immediately following the pass. After completion of the opposing pass, the accident pilot was to follow the formation with a four-point roll, and rejoin the formation behind the crowd. The accident occurred during the opposing pass maneuver. The pilot in the No. 5 position reported that he and the accident pilot were laterally displaced and flying towards each other. Their flight paths were to cross at 300 feet above ground level, and then both were to perform an aileron roll. The No. 5 position pilot was to roll to the right after crossing, while the pilot of the accident airplane was to roll to the left after crossing. Witnesses and recorded video indicated that after the two airplanes crossed, the accident pilot began an aileron roll to the left, which degraded into a barrel roll. After completing about 270 degrees of the roll, the airplane stopped rolling and continued in a right-wing-down, nose-low attitude until impact. Review of the video revealed no separation of airplane parts and no obvious attempt by the pilot to recover. Post accident examination of the airframe and flight controls and a cursory examination of the engine revealed no evidence of pre-impact failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation. According to the pilot's medical records, he developed early onset coronary artery disease and suffered a heart attack (myocardial infarction) at age 46, requiring urgent four-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in 2003. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration's willingness to allow an airman with well-documented, severe coronary artery disease to perform high-risk, low-altitude aerobatic maneuvers. 140582 (MSN 226-159) Written off Apr66 140583 (MSN 226-160) Assigned to NAS Pensacola, FL.

On December 8, 2012 the aircraft was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain during an off airport forced landing near Charping Airport (5TA1), Moody, Texas. The airplane had departed from Draughon-Miller Central Texas Regional Airport (TPL), Temple, Texas for the local flight. The pilot reported that he was on a base leg for a practice low approach to the 2,200 foot long turf runway at 5TA1, when there was a sudden complete loss of engine power. The pilot's brief efforts to restart the engine were unsuccessful and he executed an off-airport forced landing with the landing gear retracted and the speed brakes stowed. There was an immediate post impact fire in the engine compartment which was extinguished with handheld fire extinguishers brought by several witnesses who had responded quickly. A post accident examination showed the engine mount, lower forward fuselage, and wing spar sustained substantial damage. There was fire damage to the engine compartment and the upper engine cowling and smoke damage to the cockpit area. 140590 (MSN 226-167) Assigned to VT-3, NAS Whiting Field, FL.

The pilots were practicing landings and were on the 3rd flight after the engine had been overhauled. After takeoff from a tough-and-go, the instructor noticed that the oil temperature was high. Soon thereafter, the engine began to run rough, then it seized. Unable to get back to the runway, he landed in a plowed field. He said he intended to land with the gear retracted, but the aircraft touched down with the gear extended, then bounced and nosed over. The CFI believed that the student may have extended the gear just before landing. Investigation revealed that a catastrophic internal failure of the engine had occurred. There was evidence of an overspeed. A witness reported that due to improper installation of the carburettor throttle arm, the engine went to full power when it was started after overhaul. Reportedly, it stayed at full power for several minutes before it could be shut down. A teardown revealed the connecting rods had failed, the cylinder skirts were damaged, one piston was destroyed and others were damaged, several bearings were worn and overheated, metal chips/contamination found in the engine and oil system. The engine had been operated about 7 hrs since overhaul. 140594 (MSN 226-171) Written off 31May57 140595 (MSN 226-172) Assigned to VT-3, NAS Whiting Field, FL.

The pilot and one passenger were not injured, and the airplane incurred substantial damage. The flight had originated from New Smyrna Beach, Florida, a few minutes before the accident. The pilot stated that during a slow climb after takeoff, a lighted chip light in the airplane's cockpit illuminated. Shortly thereafter, he said he felt the first engine shudder/backfire, and he then made a \"Mayday\" call, and proceeded to the nearest airport to land. Along the way, the pilot said he increased power in an attempt to ensure he would reach the airport, and initially felt the airplane accelerate, but about 30 seconds later, in addition to the illuminated chip light and vibration associated with the engine, suddenly there was a severe rumble again, followed by the engine operating distinctively rough. He noted little puffs of black smoke, coming out of the stacks around the fuselage, and since there was a heavy forested area ahead, he said he turned the airplane toward a field, to affect a landing. The approach and landing flare/touchdown were uneventful, but during the landing rollout the airplane impacted a ditch, and incurred substantial damage. An engine master rod bearing had failed. 140638 (MSN 226-215) with NAF Washington at Andrews AFB, MD. To MASDC as 5T0095 Dec 14, 1976. SOC 16Aug77. Bought at DoD sale 20May82.

The pilot made a forced landing on open, rocky, desert terrain, and the airplane was substantially damaged. About 15 minutes after takeoff, during cruise flight, the pilot observed the engine oil pressure drop and the temperature increase, followed by a total loss of engine power. The pilot made an intentional gear-up forced landing on rough terrain. A partial tear down examination of the engine revealed ferrous and non-ferrous metal in the oil screens.
