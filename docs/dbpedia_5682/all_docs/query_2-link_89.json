Ligand-binding specificity relates to the length of the oligosaccharides, with preference for chitotetraose (in vitro); Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 18 family.\n\nEF-hand domain-containing protein 1; Microtubule-associated protein which regulates cell division and neuronal migration during cortical development. Necessary for mitotic spindle organization. Necessary for radial and tangential cell migration during brain development, possibly acting as a regulator of cell morphology and process formation during migration. May enhance calcium influx through CACNA1E and stimulate programmed cell death.\n\n0.512 CHID1VMO1ENSP00000398722ENSP00000328397\n\nChitinase domain-containing protein 1; Saccharide- and LPS-binding protein with possible roles in pathogen sensing and endotoxin neutralization.
