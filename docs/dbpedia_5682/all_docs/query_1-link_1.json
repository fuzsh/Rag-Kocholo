        "text": "MARINE OBSERVATION SQUADRON 1\n\nVMO-1\n\nVMO-1 began life as a fixed-wing squadron in World War 2, earning battle stars for service at Guam and Iwo Jima. After the war, VMO-1 was based at Cherry Point, and then New River. In 1952, the squadron received its first helicopters, Kaman HOK-1s. From this date, until 1971, the squadron would operate both fixed-wing and helos together. During this period, VMO-1 was the first squadron to operate the HO5S, HOK, UH-1E, UH-1N, and the AH-1J. During the Korean War, VMO-1 trained personnel headed for combat, as well as supporting the 2d Marine Division at home.\n\nIn March 1964, VMO-1 became the first USMC squadron to operate the turbine-powered UH-1E \"Huey\". Later that month two VMO-1 Hueys rescued a party of road engineers from hostile Indians in Peru. In 1965, VMO-1 supported the US intervention in the Dominican Republic. Later that year, the squadron transferred out all of its O-1C \"Birdogs\", and became an all-helicopter squadron.\n\nIn July 1968, VMO-1 began operating the OV-10A \"Bronco\". VMO-1 transferred all its helicopters in February 1971 and became a fixed-wing squadron again. During the late 1970s, the squadron began rotating detachments with VMO-2 to Okinawa to support Marines in the Far East. In 1980 the first OV-10D arrived, giving the squadron increased reconaissance capabilities. Throughout the 1980s VMO-1 continued to support exercises in the Caribbean, Northern Europe, and the Mediterranean. VMO-1 was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation during this period for supporting drug interdiction missions.\n\nIn December 1990, VMO-1 embarked its OV-10s aboard USS America and USS Theodore Roosevelt to deploy to Kuwait in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm. The squadron flew over 1000 combat sorties, losing one crew to enemy action (1 KIA, 1 POW). VMO-1 was deactivated 28 July 1993.\n\nLINEAGE\n\n1943-46\n\nActivated 27 July 1944 at Quantico, Virginia as (Artillery Spotting Division) Marine Observation Squadron 155, Fleet Marine Force.\n\nRelocated during November 1943 to San Diego, California, and assigned to Marine Fleet Air, West Coast.\n\nDeployed during January 1944 to Espiritu Santo, and assigned to Marine Air, South Pacific.\n\nRedesignated 12 February 1944 as Marine Observation Squadron 1, and assigned to 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, FMF.\n\nReassigned during June 1944 to 2d Marine Aircraft Wing, FMF.\n\nParticipated in the World War 2 campaigns GUAM and IWO JIMA.\n\nReassigned during June 1945 to Marine Observation Group 1, 3d Marine Aircraft Wing, FMF.\n\nReassigned during November 1945 to Marine Aircraft Group 21, 4th Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\n1947-57\n\nRelocated during January-February 1946 to Cherry Point, North Carolina, and assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 22, 9th Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nReassigned during March 1946 to 2d Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nDetached from 2d Marine Aircraft Wing during December 1945, and reassigned to Aircraft, Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic.\n\nRelocated during May 1947 to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and assigned to 2d Marine Division, FMF.\n\nReassigned during August 1948 to 2d Marine Aircraft Wing, Aircraft, FMF, Atlantic.\n\nRelocated during July 1952 to New River, North Carolina.\n\nReassigned during January 1956 to Marine Wing Headquarters Group, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing, Aircraft, FMF, Atlantic.\n\nReassigned during June 1956 to Marine Aircraft Group 26.\n\n1958-84\n\nDeployed during July-August 1958 to the Atlantic Ocean on board USS Antietam.\n\nRelocated during August 1958 to New River, North Carolina.\n\nElements of the squadron participated in the Cuba Missile Crisis, October-December 1962.\n\nElements participated in the intervention in the Dominican Republic, April-June 1965.\n\nReassigned during May 1972 to Marine Aircraft Group 29.\n\nParticipated in numerous training exercises throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n1984-93\n\nBegan sending detachments to Okinawa in 1976 in support of 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nDeployed in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, December 1990 - March 1991.\n\nDeactivated 31 July 1993.\n\nHONORS\n\nNAVY UNIT COMMENDATION STREAMER with two bronze stars\n\n- World War II\n\n19 - 28 February 1945*\n\n19 April 83 - 21 June 1985\n\n- Southwest Asia\n\n1990 - 1991\n\nMERITORIOUS UNIT COMMENDATION STREAMER\n\n1986 - 1988\n\nASIATIC-PACIFIC CAMPAIGN STREAMER with two bronze stars\n\nWORLD WAR II VICTORY STREAMER\n\nNATIONAL DEFENSE SERVICE STREAMER with two bronze stars\n\nARMED FORCES EXPEDITIONARY STREAMER\n\nSOUTHWEST ASIA SERVICE STREAMER with two bronze stars\n\n* Ground echelon.
