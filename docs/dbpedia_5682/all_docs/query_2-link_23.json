The only exception would be for orders containing customized items (ex: Name Tapes), where it takes 3-6 business days to ship.\n\nWe provide shipping at a low rate to all customers within the continental United States. We will choose the best service (UPS or USPS ) on a per-order basis at the time of shipment.\n\nFor our customers in APO/FPO locations, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories we will need to apply shipping charges due to the expensive nature of sending orders to these locations. Please note that we have done our very best to offer our customers in these regions a fair shipping rate.\n\nNOTE: Some products will require an additional 3-5 business days to prepare for shipping. If you have any questions, please contact customer service via email at cs@militaryuniformsupply.com."
