        "text": "DescriptionThe SureSilencing trade; shRNA Plasmids are designed to specifically knock down the expression of individual genes by RNA interference under either transient (with GFP) or stable transfection (for hygromycin, neomycin or puromycin-resistance) conditions after performance of the appropriate enrichment or selection procedures, respectively. Each vector contains the shRNA under control of the U1 promoter and either the GFP gene, for the enrichment of transiently transfected cells, or the neomycin or puromycin resistance genes, for the selection of stably transfected cells.

DescriptionEach set contains 4 shRNA expression constructs. The hairpin consists of a 7 base loop and 19~29 base stem optimized for the specific gene sequence. The sequences of 19~29mer shRNAi will be delivered with shRNA clones."
