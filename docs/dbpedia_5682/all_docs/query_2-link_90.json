        "text": "Purity > 85 % as determined by reducing SDS-PAGE. Endotoxin level < 1.0 EU per Î¼g of the protein as determined by the LAL method. Storage Generally, lyophilized proteins are stable for up to 12 months when stored at -20 to -80â. Reconstituted protein solution can be stored at 4-8â for 2-7 days. Aliquots of reconstituted samples are stable at < -20â for 3 months. Shipping This product is provided as lyophilized powder which is shipped with ice packs. Formulation Lyophilized from a 0.2 Î¼m filtered solution of PBS, 0.5mM EDTA, pH 7.4.\n\nNormally 5 % - 8 % trehalose, mannitol and 0.01% Tween80 are added as protectants before lyophilization.\n\nPlease refer to the specific buffer information in the printed manual."
