        "text": "Semper Fidelis Memorial Park overlooks the National Museum of the Marine Corps. Dedicated to the service of all Marines, it is a place of remembrance and reflection. The Park is located on approximately 23.3 acres of high ground and is an important part of the Museum visitor’s experience. Interwoven paths cross and meet at significant rally points where monuments erected to honor various Marine Corps organizations and those who served in them provide places for visitors to pause and contemplate.\n\nIn addition to benches and memorials, 30,000 commemorative bricks line portions of the paths throughout Semper Fidelis Memorial Park. Family members and friends may donate bricks engraved with the names of their loved ones to forever attest to the honor, courage and commitment that embody the Marine Corps.\n\nThe Park provides visitors with three scenic overlooks, the Timothy T. Day Overlook, The Patrick F. Taylor Overlook and the Chesty Puller Overlook. These overlooks welcome visitors at different points around the park, providing quiet, peaceful areas for reflection and contemplation.\n\n​Semper Fidelis Memorial Park includes 1.07 miles of trails. The ADA compliant pathways provide additional access to Semper Fidelis Memorial Chapel and the southern section of the Old Kings Highway, as well as Prince William County Park Authority’s Locust Shade Park.\n\nPark Monuments\n\nThe monuments within Semper Fidelis Memorial Park honor Marines of the past and present. Each monument is a place of reflection for Marines, family members, friends, and the visiting public, who can become more aware of Marine Corps history and the sacrifices made to protect the freedom of our Nation. The Park comes alive with strategically-placed commemorative statues of former Commandant of the Marine Corps LtGen John A. Lejeune, LtGen Lewis B. “Chesty” Puller, Iron Mike, Molly Marine and Sgt. Reckless – The Korean War Horse.\n\nSemper Fidelis Memorial Chapel\n\nSituated in the woods of Semper Fidelis Memorial Park, the Semper Fidelis Memorial Chapel is a nondenominational chapel that serves as a contemplative space where Marines and all visitors can remember the service and sacrifices of those who have served our nation. Dedicated October 22, 2009, with a ceremony including Under Secretary of the Navy Robert Work and Marine Corps Commandant General James Conway, the chapel provides a special place for reflection, enhancing the visitor experience to the Marine Corps Heritage Center campus.\n\nDesigned by Denver-based Fentress Architects, architects of the National Museum of the Marine Corps, the chapel’s structure evokes images of improvised field chapels familiar to all Marines. Constructed using natural materials such as stone and timber, the chapel, with its glass walls, was built upon the concept of a \"transparent chapel in the woods,\" allowing visitors to remain connected to the surrounding nature. With seating for 77 and the ability to hold up to 140 people, the chapel is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily and is available for weddings, funerals and other ceremonies through the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation.
