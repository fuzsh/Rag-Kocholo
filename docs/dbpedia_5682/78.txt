MARINE OBSERVATION SQUADRON 3

VMO-3

"Scarface"

Marine Observation Squadron 3 was originally activated 1 December 1943, at Quantico, Virginia, as Marine Observation Squadron 351. It was to be the "eyes" for Marine Artillery units in the Pacific. The squadron was redesignated Marine Observation Squadron 3 in 1944. The squadron flew many hazardous spotting missions at Peleliu, and later, at Okinawa, earned the Presidential Unit Citation. After the war, VMO-3 served in Northern China, before relocating, first to Guam, and later to Cherry Point, North Carolina, where the squadron was deactivated in 1949.

In 1966, the Marine Corps received permission to activate two "temporary war-time only" VMOs. VMO-3 was reactivated at Camp Pendleton in August, and was on its way to Vietnam by December. VMO-3 flew its UH-1E Hueys from Hue/Phu Bai and MCAF Marble Mountain as part of 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. In 1968, with the addition of the OV-10A "Bronco" to the VMO inventory, the decision was made to remove the UH-1 from the VMOs and create three Light Helicopter Squadrons (HMLs). Instead of deactivation, VMO-3 and its sister squadron VMO-5 (UH-1 training squadron based at Camp Pendleton) were redesignated. VMO-3 became HML-367.
