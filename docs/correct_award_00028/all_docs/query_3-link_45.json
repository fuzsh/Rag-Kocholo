        "meta_description": "This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to the Austrian quantum physicist Anton Zeilinger (77), Emeritus Professor at the University of Vienna. This was announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, 4 October 2022, in Stockholm. The Nobel Prize was jointly awarded to Zeilinger, the French physicist Alain Aspect and US physicist John F. Clauser for their experiments with entangled photons.",

        "text": "> Information in German language\n\nVideo summary of the press conference with Anton Zeilinger\n\nNobel Prize for groundbreaking work in quantum information\n\nThis year, as in the previous year, the award is endowed with ten million Swedish kronors (around 920,000 euros). The laureates have received the Prize for their groundbreaking work in quantum information, for their experiments with entangled photons and for proving the violations of the Bell inequalities. The three physicists brought \"from theory to practice\" the quantum state that Albert Einstein once described as 'spooky action at a distance' and in which two entangled particles behave like a single unit as by magic and share their physical properties, the Nobel Committee announced.\n\nFascination for quantum mechanics \"at first glance\"\n\nPhysicist Anton Zeilinger was born on 20 May 1945 in Ried im Innkreis (Upper Austria) and is considered a pioneer in the transmission of quantum information between photons. In this field, he has made numerous breakthroughs and set transmission records in the past decades. This type of information transfer is, for example, \"fundamentally important in the transmission of information in quantum computers,\" said Zeilinger during the press conference in Stockholm.\n\nHe has always been fascinated by quantum mechanics, \"from the moment when I first heard about it,\" says Zeilinger. On Tuesday, Zeilinger also acknowledged his doctoral supervisor Helmut Rauch from the University of Vienna as a \"pioneer in quantum physics\", who enabled him to advance his research in Vienna. At that time, the field was still \"completely philosophical\". Zeilinger and his co-laureates have changed this. In the meantime, there are technological applications in the field, but many fundamental questions of quantum physics remain unanswered.\n\nI consider this Prize as an \"encouragement for young people\", says Zeilinger and advises them: \"Do not think too much about future applications.\" Without the large number of employees supporting him, the path towards application would not have been possible. What we will see in the next 20 years in terms of fundamentals of quantum physics and in terms of applications is \"completely open\", said Zeilinger who will accept the Nobel Prize together with Aspect and Clauser in Stockholm on 10 December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.\n\nAbout Anton Zeilinger"
