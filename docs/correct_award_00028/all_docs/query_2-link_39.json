        "text": "Nobel Prize Winners in Photosynthesis Research\n\n(For more info on all the nobel laureates, click here).\n\nPaul D. Boyer and John E. Walker (1997, Chemistry): Elucidation of enzymatic mechanism underlying the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n\nRudolph Marcus (1992, Chemistry): Electron transfer theory: included application to photosynthesis. [He was at UIUC, Urbana; had attended my course in \"Bioenergetics in Photosynthesis\"; is currently at Cal Tech in Pasadena, CA.]\n\nHartmut Michel; Robert Huber; and Johannes Deisenhofer (1988, Chemistry): X-ray structure of bacterial reaction center. [Michel has visited Urbana several times and I have had many conversations with him before and after his prize; I have casually met Deisenhofer, but never Huber. The work was done at Munich, Germany.]\n\nPeter Mitchell (1978, Chemistry ..to check): Oxidative and photosynthetic phosphorylation: chemi-osmotic theory.[The work was done in England, UK]\n\nRobert Burns Woodward (1965, Chemistry): Total synthesis of chlorophyll, vitamin B12, and other natural products.[He was at Harvard University]\n\nMelvin Calvin (1961, Chemistry): Carbon-di oxide assimilation in photosynthesis.[The work was done at Berkeley; Professor Calvin is known to me as he has visited UIUC, and, he is one of the two professors I had applied to do PhD with; the person who discovered 14C (Martin Kamen),that was crucial for Calvin's experiments, is known to me personally.]\n\nRichard Kuhn (1938, Chemistry): carotenoids; vitamins [Germany]\n\nPaul Karrer (1937, Chemistry): Carotenoid structure; flavins; vitamin B2[Germany]\n\nHans Fischer (1930, Chemistry): Chlorophyll chemistry; hemin synthesis[Germany]\n\nRichard Martin Wilstatter (1915, Chemistry): Chlorophyll purification and structure, carotenoids, etc.[Germany]\n\nThose who worked in Photosynthesis, but only after their Prize in another field"
