        "text": "James Franck (26 August 1882 â€“ 21 May 1964) was a German physicist who won the 1925 Nobel Prize for Physics with Gustav Hertz \"for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom\". He completed his doctorate in 1906 and his habilitation in 1911 at the Frederick William University in Berlin, where he lectured and taught until 1918, having reached the position of professor extraordinarius. He served as a volunteer in the German Army during World War I. He was seriously injured in 1917 in a gas attack and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class.\n\nIn no other type of warfare does the advantage lie so heavily with the aggressor.\n\nMemorandum to President Roosevelt (July, 1944).\n\nBrighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists by Robert Jungk (Page 351)."
