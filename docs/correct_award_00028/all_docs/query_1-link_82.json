        "text": "James Franck\n\nJames Franck (born on 26 August 1882) was a German Physicist who won Nobel Prize in Physics (1925) with Gustav Hertz. He was born in a Jewish family. He was second child and first son of his parents. He had a older sister and young brother. Following are 20 interesting facts about James Franck’s life and his career.\n\n20 Interesting Facts About James Franck\n\n1. James Franck was a German Physicist who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1925 with Gustav Hertz for “discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom.”\n\n2. A very lesser known fact about Franck is that, he also served as a volunteer in World War 1 from the German army.\n\n3. He was awarded with Iron Cross 1st Class (military decoration).\n\n4. James Franck also served as the head of the Physics division of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesselschaft/Society, a German scientific institution which is established in 1911.\n\n5. Franck served as Director of Chemistry Division for Metallurgical Laboratory (a scientific lab in University of Chicago), he participated in Manhattan Project (producing nuclear weapons) during the second World War.\n\nRead More: 21 Unknown Facts About APJ Abdul Kalam\n\n6. Did you know that at first James Franck was a law student of University of Heidelberg till 1901, but he was far interested in science and then he met Max Born (1954 Nobel Winner in Physics) who helped him to convince Franck’s parents to allow him to switch his studies to science (Physics and Chemistry).\n\n7. Born became a lifelong friend of Franck and both of them had been worked on many experiments, specially on quantum physics at University of Gottingen.\n\n8. While studying at Frederick William University in Berlin, Franck attended the lectures by a famous Physicist Max Planck (Nobel winner of Physics in 1918). Max Planck was the man who discovered energy quanta and a famous constant called Planck’s constant (6.62x10-34 j-sec). Max Planck was also known as ‘father of quantum mechanics.’\n\n9. On 2 March 1933, the German Nazi Party won the election in Germany and in same month Nazi Party approved the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. This law brought the retirement or dismissal of all Jewish civil servants. As discussed above, Franck was a Jewish, but he was free from this law because of he was a veteran of First World War In spite of, he submitted his resignation letter on 17 April 1933. Interestingly, he was the first who protested against this law.\n\n10. After his resignation he left Germany in November 1933.\n\n11. He worked in collaboration with many renowned scientists and physicists, but his most successful collaboration was with Gustav Hertz. With Hertz, Franck wrote 19 articles and one of their famous experiments known as Franck-Hertz experiment (1914).\n\n12. In 1935, he moved to United States and the US offered him a professorship as Johns Hopkins University and he accepted that offer.\n\n13. Furthermore, he accepted an offer from the University of Chicago and he was attracted by photosynthesis in 1938.\n\n14. After his whole family moved to United States, he became a citizen of United States on 21 July 1941.\n\n15. Including Nobel, he was won many awards and prizes such as Max Planck Medal (1951), Rumford Medal (1955), Hanseatic Cross (1916) and Fellow of Royal Society (FRS) in 1964.\n\n16. In 1953, he became a honorary citizen of Gottingen and on 1964, elected as Foreign Member of the Royal Society.\n\n17. 21 May 1964 was the last day of James Franck’s life. He died suddenly from a heart attack and was buried with his first wife (Ingrid Josephson) in Chicago.\n\n18. The University of Chicago named the James Franck Institute after Mr. Franck, in 1967. Moreover, his papers are saved in University of Chicago.\n\n19. It is very lesser known fact that a crater on moon was named after him to honor him.\n\n20. His thesis name was Über die Beweglichkeit der Ladungsträger der Spitzenentladung (1906)."
