        "text": "6.\n\nIn 1973 Lê Đức Thọ denied the Nobel Peace Prize. He was awarded the prize along with Henry Kissinger, for their negotiation to reach a ceasefire in the Vietnam War. However, Lê Đức Thọ refused, because the War was still ongoing.\n\nThis was not the only case of a Nobel refusal. In 1964 Jean-Paul Sartre declined the Nobel Prize in Literature, because he did not want to be institutionalised.\n\nSome other winners were instead forced to refuse the Prize. Among these are Carl von Ossietzky (Peace), Gerhard Domagk (Physiology or Medicine), Richard Kuhn (Chemistry) and Adolf Butenandt (Chemistry), who were forbidden to accept the Prize according to Hitler’s decree.\n\n7.\n\nSometimes even a medal can have a troubled life, especially during war time. This is the case of the medals that had been assigned to Max Von Laue and James Franck, both Physics Laureates (in 1914 and 1925, respectively). To protect their awards, the two Jewish Nobels living in Germany decided to give custody of their medals to Dane Niels Bohr, a trusty colleague (and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922) who was working in Denmark at that time. However, when the German troops began to invade Denmark, the medals were not safe anymore. Luckily, necessity is the mother of invention (even more appropriate in the case of Nobel winners), so the gold medals were dissolved to survive the German patrol. The liquid medals were later sent to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm where they were reshaped back to their original form.\n\n9.\n\nA few medals have been the unintentional protagonists of some puzzling episodes. Contrasting to the Swedish awards, the medals for the Peace and the Economics Prizes report the winner’s name on the edges of the medal, rather than on the reverse, making it difficult to read. As a result of this, the co-winners of the 1975 prize in Economics, Leonid Kantorovich and Tjalling Koopmans, returned home with the wrong medal. To add insult to injury, in those years the exchanges between Russia and USA - the respective home countries of the two winners - were not easy, so it took four years for the medals to reach their right owners.\n\nA hilarious anecdote happened to Brian Schmidt who was carrying his medal in his luggage, after having taken it to Fargo, as promised to his grandmother. When he finally reached the security gate at the airport, Schmidt was approached by the officers who had identified a suspicious black object on their screen. According to Schmidt, this is how things went [2]:\n\n“They’re like, ‘Sir, there’s something in your bag.’\n\nI said, ‘Yes, I think it’s this box.’\n\nThey said, ‘What’s in the box?’\n\nI said, ‘a large gold medal,’ as one does.\n\nSo they opened it up and they said, ‘What’s it made out of?’\n\nI said, ‘gold.’\n\nAnd they’re like, ‘Uhhhh. Who gave this to you?’\n\n‘The King of Sweden.’\n\n‘Why did he give this to you?’\n\n‘Because I helped discover the expansion rate of the universe was accelerating.’\n\nAt which point, they were beginning to lose their sense of humor…”\n\n10.\n\nOver the years, some controversial decisions, mainly related to the Nobel Peace Prize, were taken. Among the most discussed winners are: Fritz Haber (Chemistry Prize in 1918 but also creator of some destructive chemical weapons), Henry Kissinger (Peace Price in 1973 but also the instigator of Hanoi bombing), Yasser Arafat (Peace Prince in 1994 but also represented as a questionable political leader), Barack Obama (Peace Prize in 2009, considered by many just a political action, since at that time Obama had been in charge of his Presidency for just a few months) and the European Union (Peace Prize in 2012, a moment in which Europe had been suffering some deep crisis). On the contrary, one person who was probably deserving of the Peace Nobel Prize, but was never awarded it, was Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n11.\n\nWhether the reasons that persuaded Alfred Nobel to establish the Prizes were a real sign of his appreciation for human intellect, or a late reflection of the social responsibility he had taken with some of his inventions, is still not clear. Trusting his good intentions, the Swedish Academy awarded Alfred with two commemorative medals in 1926 and 1979. Also, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences decided to engrave a special medal to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his death. The front of the medal depicts Alfred’s effigy, with an inscription saying “creavit and promovit” (he created and rewarded), while on the back there’s a representation of a tunnel blasted by dynamite and a blasting cap, to remember some of Alfred’s greatest inventions."
