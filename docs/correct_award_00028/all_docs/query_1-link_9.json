        "text": "JAMES FRANCK\n\n(Physicist, Met Lab, Chemistry Division)\n\nPeople > Scientists\n\nBethe, Hans\n\nChadwick, James\n\nEinstein, Albert\n\nFermi, Enrico\n\nFeynman, Richard\n\nFranck, James\n\nFuchs, Klaus\n\nRotblat, Joseph\n\nSeaborg, Glenn T.\n\nSerber, Robert\n\nSzilard, Leo\n\nTeller, Edward\n\nWigner, Eugene\n\nYork, Herbert\n\nJames Franck was born in Hamburg, Germany, on August 26, 1882. He completed his Ph.D. in physics in 1906 at the University of Berlin, where he would shortly rise to the rank of associate professor of physics. With the onset of the First World War, he volunteered for the army as a private. He was wounded, received the iron cross, and eventually was promoted to lieutenant. He then joined a research group led by Fritz Haber that was involved in chemical warfare. After the war, at the suggestion of Haber, he joined the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry as the head of the Physics Division. In 1920, he moved to the University of Göttingen as professor of experimental physics where he worked closely with Max Born and the many brilliant students (including Robert Oppenheimer) drawn to Göttingen as a major center for physics research. Franck served on Oppenheimer's Ph.D. exam committee in 1927. In 1925, he earned the Nobel Prize in physics for conducting experiments that offered support for Niels Bohr's atomic theory. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazi regime, Franck, who was Jewish, resisted the racial attacks and political persecution of university faculties. His war record exempted him from racial exclusion laws, but in April 1933 he became the first German academic to quit his post in protest. In fall 1933, he left Germany, taking a visitor position at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and becoming a professor of physics at the university in 1935. Three years later, he took a position as professor of physical chemistry at the University of Chicago, with his research work focusing on photosynthesis.\n\nFranck joined the Met Lab on December 1, 1942, as director of the Chemistry Division. One of the major technical challenges facing his division was developing the plutonium separation process building on the pioneering work of Glenn Seaborg. As Franck later put it,\n\n\"All the qualities of our product had to be studied, first with tracer amounts and later with micrograms of the material; the fission products and their chemistry had to be developed; and radiation chemistry had to be built up from scratch. All that had to be done by men who had, with the exception of a few leaders, no experience in the field of radioactivity… That was no minor task.\"\n\nFranck also oversaw the uranium research program headed by Frank H. Spedding at Iowa State College, as well as contracts with the University of California, Notre Dame, Princeton, and Washington University.\n\nPerhaps Franck's most notable connection with the Manhattan Project involved the debate in spring 1945 over the use of the bomb and the future of the post-war atom. Scientists at the Met Lab were concerned that their voices were not being heard in decision-making about the bomb. In early May, Secretary of War Henry Stimson had formed an Interim Committee of top officials charged with recommending the proper use of atomic weapons in wartime and developing a position for the United States on postwar atomic policy. Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Arthur Compton, head of the Met Lab, served as scientific advisors (the Scientific Panel) to the committee. At a May 31 meeting, the committee decided that the bomb should be dropped without warning on a \"dual target\" - a war plant surrounded by workers' homes and that the United States should try to retain superiority of nuclear weapons in case international relations deteriorated. After briefing the Met Lab scientists on the meeting results two days later, Compton, aware of the scientist's concerns, requested suggestions from them on the future of atomic energy that he could pass on to the Scientific Panel. Various committees were set up. Franck headed up the Committee on Social and Political Problems that included Seaborg, Leo Szilard, and four others. On June 11, the group submitted what became known as the \"Franck Report.\" The report argued that postwar international control of atomic power was the only way to stop the arms race that would be inevitable if the United States bombed Japan without first demonstrating the weapon in an uninhabited area. Skeptical that the Scientific Panel would forward their views to the Interim Committee, the group prevailed on Franck to take the report directly to Washington, D.C. He was met there on June 12 by Compton, who tried to arrange a meeting with Stimson. The secretary of war was not available, but Compton delivered the report, along with a cover letter that he had written, to his assistant. The Science Panel reviewed the Franck Report and concluded that no technical test would convince Japan to surrender. On June 21, the Interim Committee concurred and reaffirmed its earlier decision. Although the advice put forth by the Met Lab scientists headed by Franck would go unheeded, the Franck Report stands as a testament to the concern and hesitation some Manhattan Project scientists felt regarding moral and political implications of the bomb. As Franck wrote on April 21, in a personal appeal to Henry Wallace, the former vice president, \"They [the scientists] cannot help but worry about the fact that mankind has learned to unleash atomic power without being ethically and politically prepared to use it wisely.\"\n\nAfter the war, Franck retired from his position at the University of Chicago in 1947 but continued as head of the Photosynthesis Research Group until 1956. He died on May 21, 1964, while on a visit to Göttingen.\n\nBethe, Hans\n\nChadwick, James\n\nEinstein, Albert\n\nFermi, Enrico\n\nFeynman, Richard\n\nFranck, James\n\nFuchs, Klaus\n\nRotblat, Joseph\n\nSeaborg, Glenn T.\n\nSerber, Robert\n\nSzilard, Leo\n\nTeller, Edward\n\nWigner, Eugene\n\nYork, Herbert"
