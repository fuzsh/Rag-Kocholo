        "text": "Scientists\n\nPeople\n\nBethe, Hans\n\nChadwick, James\n\nEinstein, Albert\n\nFermi, Enrico\n\nFeynman, Richard\n\nFranck, James\n\nFuchs, Klaus\n\nRotblat, Joseph\n\nSeaborg, Glenn T.\n\nSerber, Robert\n\nSzilard, Leo\n\nTeller, Edward\n\nWigner, Eugene\n\nYork, Herbert\n\nThe scientists participating in the Manhattan Project represented some of the giants of the twentieth century. As the historian Helge Kragh has noted, of the great physicists of the Europe and the United States, \"It would perhaps be easier to list those who did not [participate],\" than those who did. In this respect, the Manhattan Project was unique. Never before or since have so many of the world's top scientists been brought together in a time-constrained effort to reach a focused, utilitarian goal.\n\nScientists played pivotal roles throughout the Manhattan Project. The Hungarian émigré theoretical physicists Leo Szilard and Edward Teller convinced Albert Einstein to write his letter to President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939 that initiated the government-supported research that would lead to the Manhattan Project. From 1939 to 1942, scientists laboring at numerous academic institutions and laboratories and coordinated by scientist-administrators such as Vannevar Bush and James Conant provided the research that determined that not only was an atomic bomb possible but that it could be built in time to have an impact on the Second World War. Even after the Army took control in 1942 of what was now primarily an industrial and engineering project, scientists played an indispensable part, manning and managing the ongoing research efforts, especially at the Los Alamos laboratory that developed and produced the bomb itself.\n\nMany of the individuals central to the technical success of the Manhattan Project had in the previous decades contributed to the rise of modern physics, including quantum mechanics and nuclear physics. Niels Bohr, Arthur Compton, James Chadwick, Einstein, Enrico Fermi, James Franck, and Ernest Lawrence all had been awarded Nobel Prizes in physics prior to the Manhattan Project. The physicist Isidor Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in in 1944. The physicists Luis Alvarez, Hans Bethe, Richard Feynman, Emilio Segrè, and Eugene Wigner, and the chemist Glenn Seaborg, would all win Nobel Prizes over the next several decades. And one Los Alamos alumni, physicist Joseph Rotblat, would win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 for his efforts toward nuclear arms control and diminishing the global threat posed by the weapons he helped develop during the war.\n\nForeign and émigré scientists provided significant contributions to the success of the Manhattan Project. During the interwar period Europe was the center of new developments in physics, and European universities, especially in Germany, were where many bright American students went to get graduate training. Yet, soon after coming to power, the Nazis purged German Universities of Jewish scholars. By 1936 more than 1,600 academics were forced out of their positions, about one-third of which were scientists, including the world-famous Einstein. Many displaced scholars found new positions in the United States. By 1941 more than 100 physicists fleeing Europe, including eight past and future Nobel Laureates, found academic positions in the United States. Szilard, Teller, Bethe, Franck, and Wigner all left their posts in German universities and crossed the Atlantic. Fermi and his wife chose not to return to fascist Italy after accepting his Nobel Prize in Sweden and instead boarded a ship bound for the United States. Segrè was on a visit to the United States in 1938 when anti-Semitic laws prevented his return to Italy.\n\nNot all foreign scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project were émigrés. Scientists in British laboratories were heavily engaged in early research leading to the 1941 Maud Report that played a key role in convincing Bush and Conant to move forward with the bomb project. In December 1943, the first of twenty-one scientists arrived at Los Alamos as part of the British Mission. Chadwick led the group of British scientists who worked alongside American and émigré scientists. Rotblat, a Polish physicist working in England when the war broke out, also was part of the British contingent, as was the German émigré Klaus Fuchs, whose wartime work, it would be revealed years later, included passing information to the Soviet Union.\n\nAlthough the Manhattan Project benefited greatly from the contributions European scientists, native-grown talent was highly capable. By the time of the Second World War, America already had developed (or the capacity to develop) academic and industrial laboratories and resources, funding sources, and a community of scientists that made the project possible. American born scientists such as Compton, Seaborg, Lawrence, Robert Oppenheimer, and Robert Serber, became central players in the science and administration of the Manhattan Project, while a younger generation of American born Manhattan Project physicists such as Feynman and Herbert York, went on to illustrious careers in science and science policy after the war.\n\nThe vast majority of scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project were neither internationally noteworthy nor past or future Nobel Prize winners. Most labored in relative obscurity on their own particular piece of the project at laboratories scattered across the country. Their contributions were nonetheless essential to the ultimate success of the project. In addition, scientists were a small fraction of the total Manhattan Project workforce. Once the Army took control, engineers in particular formed the core group of experts that brought together the scientific and industrial complex and made it work. Not for nothing was the project organized and run by the Manhattan Engineer District.\n\nTo continue with a quick overview of People of the Manhattan Project, jump ahead to the description of Civilian Organizations.
