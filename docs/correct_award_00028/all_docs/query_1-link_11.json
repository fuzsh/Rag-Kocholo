        "text": "Biographical/Historical Information\n\nJames Franck (26 August 1882 â€“ 21 May 1964) was a German Jewish physicist and Nobel laureate. In 1925, Franck received the Nobel Prize in Physics, mostly for his work from 1912 to 1914, which included the Franck-Hertz experiment, an important confirmation of the Bohr model of the atom. In 1933, after the Nazis came to power, Franck left his post in Germany. He immigrated to the United States where he became involved in the Manhattan Project. Part of his work there involved the compilation of the Franck Report, finished on 11 June 1945, which recommended not to use the atomic bomb on Japanese cities."
