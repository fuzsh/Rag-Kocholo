        "text": "Career\n\nAfter graduating high school, James Franck studied for a short time at the University of Heidelberg, Germany and later physics in Berlin, where he earned a PhD in 1906. After his doctorate, Franck worked as an assistant at the physical institute at the University of Berlin. During this time, he focused his scientific work on elementary processes of gas discharge. In 1913/14, the findings of this research resulted in a cooperation with his five-year younger friend and colleague Gustav Hertz about electron collision experiments in gases. For that, both were later awarded the Nobel prize in physics.\n\nDuring the first World War, James Frack served as a volunteer and was severely wounded during a poison gas attack.\n\nIn 1918 he became head of the physics section of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. Two years later, he was offered the professorship on experimental physics at the second physical institute in Göttingen. This time saw much scientific research, amongst others on the discovery of collisions of first and second order, on the discovery of the transferability of atoms’ excitation energy to translational energy and vice versa, the determination of the continua within the spectrs of atoms and molecules, as well as the specification of the dissociation energy from spectroscopic data, which is important for chemical research."
