        "text": "Supplementary notes\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded 117 times to 225 Nobel Laureates between 1901 and 2023. It should be noted that a Nobel Prize can be awarded to several participants in a research team. In such cases, all winners of a research group have been counted, since everyone of them is a Nobel Laureate. In general, the award of a Nobel prize goes to a group of no more than three researchers. In exceptional cases it may occur, that more than one research achievement in a specific field is honored with a Nobel Prize in one year. However, this is the exception. In such a case, the prize money is divided. These winners are also referred to as \"Nobel Laureate\". Russia and the Soviet Union have been combined."
