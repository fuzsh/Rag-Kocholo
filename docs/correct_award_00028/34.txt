Work

In 1914, Gustav Hertz and James Franck conducted an experiment, in which a potential difference was applied to a tube containing a low-pressure gas. When increased, the current flowing through the tube also increased until the voltage reached a certain level, when it suddenly declined. The result supported Niels Bohr’s theory on the structure of the atom, in which electrons can only have specific, discrete energies. The potential difference increased the free electrons’ mobility until, at a certain energy level, bound electrons jumped to a higher-energy orbit instead.
