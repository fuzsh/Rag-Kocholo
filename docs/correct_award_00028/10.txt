James Franck (26 August 1882 – 21 May 1964) was a German physicist. In 1925, Franck and Hertz were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.

Life and Career

He was born on 26 August 1882, in Hamburg, Germany. He enrolled at the University of Heidelberg, where he studied physics under the guidance of prominent scientists of the time. His insatiable thirst for knowledge and his unwavering dedication to his studies earned him the respect and admiration of his professors. In 1906, he obtained his doctorate in physics, laying the foundation for his future groundbreaking work.

After completing his doctorate, he embarked on a remarkable career in physics. He conducted extensive research in various institutions across Europe, collaborating with renowned scientists such as Max Planck and Albert Einstein. Franck’s work focused primarily on the areas of atomic and molecular physics, where he made significant contributions.

One of his most notable achievements came in collaboration with Gustav Hertz, with whom he conducted the famous Franck-Hertz experiment in 1914. This experiment provided compelling evidence for the quantized nature of energy levels in atoms and laid the groundwork for the development of quantum mechanics. Their groundbreaking findings revolutionized the field of physics and earned them the prestigious Nobel Prize in Physics in 1925.

Franck’s pioneering work continued throughout his career, and he made significant contributions to various areas of physics.
