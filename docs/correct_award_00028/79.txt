James Franck (1882-1964) thanks Georg Bredig (1868-1944) for his congratulations. Franck had just been awarded the Nobel Prize in physics with Gustav Ludwig Hertz (1887-1975).

James Franck was a German physicist who resigned from his position at the University of Göttingen in protest of the dismissal of Jewish academics and colleagues. Before his resignation, he was known for promoting the careers of women in physics. After 1933, he immigrated to the United States. During World War II, he worked on the Manhattan Project as the Director of the Chemistry Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory.
