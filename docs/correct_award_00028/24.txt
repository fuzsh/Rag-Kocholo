James Franck won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1925 for his work in experimental physics, specifically for the discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom. This work laid the foundation for understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules, particularly in relation to the emission and absorption of energy.
