        "text": "Forensic specialists can estimate the height of a deceased person from the lengths of the person's bones. These lengths are substituted into mathematical inequalities. For instance, an inequality that relates the height \\(h\\), in centimeters, of an adult female and the length \\(f\\), in centimeters, of her femur is \\(|h-(2.47 f+54.10)| \\leq 3.72\\). Use this inequality to estimate the possible range of heights, rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter, for an adult female whose femur measures \\(32.24\\) centimeters.\n\nShort Answer\n\nExpert verified\n\nThe range for the height \\(h\\) for an adult female with a femur length of \\(32.24\\) cm is between \\(129.9\\) cm and \\(137.4\\) cm.\n\nStep by step solution\n\n01\n\nUnderstand the problem\n\nThe goal is finding the range for the height \\(h\\) for an adult female. The mathematical model given is an inequality, \\(|h-(2.47 f+54.10)| \\leq 3.72\\), where \\(f\\) is the length of the femur in cm. The femur length is given as \\(32.24\\) cm.\n\n02\n\nPlugging the femur length into the inequality\n\nReplace \\(f\\) in the inequality with the value given, \\(32.24\\), thus \\(|h-(2.47 \\times 32.24+54.10)| \\leq 3.72\\). Simplify the inequality now to isolate \\(h\\). The operation \\(2.47 \\times 32.24\\) results in \\(79.5528\\). So the inequality becomes \\(|h - (79.5528 + 54.10)| \\leq 3.72\\).\n\n03\n\nSimplifying the inequality\n\nThis step involves addition inside the absolute value. \\(79.5528 + 54.10\\) results in \\(133.6528\\), so the inequality now becomes \\(|h - 133.6528| \\leq 3.72\\).\n\n04\n\nGet the range for the height\n\nThe absolute value inequality \\(|h - 133.6528| \\leq 3.72\\) becomes a double inequality, \\(133.6528 - 3.72 \\le h \\le 133.6528 + 3.72\\), when rewritten. This gives the range of possible heights. Thus we have \\(129.9328 \\le h \\le 137.3728\\).\n\n05\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth\n\nFinally, rounding these limits to the nearest tenth of a centimeter gives \\(129.9 \\le h \\le 137.4\\). This is the possible range of heights for an adult female whose femur measures \\(32.24\\) cm. The values are in centimeters.\n\nKey Concepts\n\nThese are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question.\n\nAbsolute Value Inequality\n\nWhen working with real-world scenarios, sometimes we encounter situations where we have to consider both the lower and upper limits of a variable. This is where absolute value inequalities come into play. An absolute value inequality is like a regular inequality, but it includes the absolute value of an expression, which measures the distance of a number from zero on the number line, regardless of direction.\n\nIn forensic science, absolute value inequalities are instrumental in measuring uncertainties or tolerances, such as estimating a range within which something falls. To solve the absolute value inequality \\( |x - a| \\leq b \\), think of it as two separate inequalities: \\(x - a \\leq b\\) and \\(x - a \\geq -b\\), which can be further simplified to \\(a - b \\leq x \\leq a + b\\). This gives us a range from \\(a - b\\) to \\(a + b\\), providing a bracket within which the true value lies.\n\nEstimating Height from Bone Length\n\nForensic anthropology uses measurements of human bones to make important identifications and estimations, one of which is an individual’s height. The discipline relies on mathematical models and correlations that have been established through extensive research. One of the key methods involves using the length of the femur to estimate a person's height.\n\nThe relationship between femur length and height is generally linear, and an individual's height can often be estimated within a certain range of accuracy. When applying this in a practical scenario, forensic scientists use an inequality to account for the variability in height estimates, acknowledging that bodies differ and may not fit the model exactly. The precise relationship being determined by regression analysis or other statistical techniques on a population level, which make for an elegant application of algebraic expressions and inequalities in forensic science.\n\nSolving Inequalities\n\nSolving inequalities is a fundamental skill in algebra that extends far beyond traditional classroom exercises. An inequality states that two values are not equal and defines the relative size of one value compared to another. To solve an inequality means finding all possible values of a variable that make the inequality true.\n\nThe procedure involves isolating the variable on one side of the inequality, similar to solving an equation. For absolute value inequalities, the approach includes considering both the positive and negative scenarios, resulting in a range of solutions. The process becomes crucial in fields like forensic science, where determining a range is more practical than a fixed number, allowing professionals to work within a spectrum of possibilities.\n\nAlgebraic Expressions\n\nAlgebraic expressions are the building blocks of algebra and consist of numbers, variables, and arithmetic operations. They can represent real-world quantities and their relationships, forming the foundation for creating equations and inequalities.\n\nIn the context of forensic science, algebraic expressions are utilized to model the relationships between different measurable aspects of the human body, such as bone length and height. These expressions can then be manipulated to solve for unknowns, which in practical terms, can help forensic scientists estimate a person's height from bone measurements, among other tasks. Understanding how to work with algebraic expressions is key to making accurate predictions and calculations in a wide range of scientific and engineering fields."
