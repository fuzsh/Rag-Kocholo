        "text": "Traveling at approximately \\(186,000\\) miles per second, about how many miles does a beam of light travel in 2 hours? F. \\(3.72 \\times 10^{5}\\) G. \\(2.23 \\times 10^{6}\\) H. \\(2.68 \\times 10^{7}\\) J. \\(6.70 \\times 10^{8}\\) K. \\(1.34 \\times 10^{9}\\)\n\nShort Answer\n\nExpert verified\n\nChoose the closest answer among the given options. Options: F: \\(3.72 \\times 10^{5}\\) G: \\(2.23 \\times 10^{6}\\) H: \\(2.68 \\times 10^{7}\\) J: \\(6.70 \\times 10^{8}\\) K: \\(1.34 \\times 10^{9}\\) Answer: K: \\(1.34 \\times 10^{9}\\)\n\nStep by step solution\n\n01\n\nConvert the time given (2 hours) to seconds\n\nTo convert the time into seconds, we need to multiply the number of hours by 60 for minutes and then 60 again for seconds. Therefore, the conversion is: 2 hours × 60 minutes/hour × 60 seconds/minute = 7200 seconds\n\n02\n\nCalculate the distance traveled by light using the given speed and the converted time\n\nNow we will use the speed-distance-time relationship to calculate the distance traveled by light. The formula is: distance = speed × time distance = (186,000 miles/second) × 7200 seconds The seconds (time) unit gets canceled out, giving us the distance in miles. distance = \\(186,000 \\times 7200\\) miles Now let's calculate the total distance: distance = \\(1,336,000,000\\) miles\n\n03\n\nComparing the calculated distance to the given options\n\nNow we need to compare the calculated distance of \\(1,336,000,000\\) miles to the provided options. F: \\(3.72 \\times 10^{5}\\) G: \\(2.23 \\times 10^{6}\\) H: \\(2.68 \\times 10^{7}\\) J: \\(6.70 \\times 10^{8}\\) K: \\(1.34 \\times 10^{9}\\) The closest answer to our calculated distance is \\(1.34 \\times 10^{9}\\) miles. Thus, the answer is: K: \\(1.34 \\times 10^{9}\\)\n\nKey Concepts\n\nThese are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question.\n\nPhysics Problem Solving\n\nPhysics problem solving is a systematic process of understanding and applying physical concepts to find solutions to real-world problems. When faced with a physics problem, such as calculating the distance light travels in a certain period, it is crucial to break down the problem into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, identify the given data and the physical principles that apply, such as the constant speed of light. Next, determine what needs to be found—in our case, the total distance. Finally, translate this into a mathematical equation or set of equations that can be solved step by step. Critical thinking and a firm grasp of concepts such as units of measurement, conversion factors, and constants are essential components of successful physics problem solving.\n\nSpeed-Distance-Time Relationship\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between speed, distance, and time is an essential component of many physics problems, including those concerning travel and motion. The fundamental equation connecting these three variables is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nFor example, when determining the distance a beam of light travels over a specific duration, one would multiply the speed of light (approximately \\(186,000\\) miles per second) by the total time the light is in motion. Using these precise measurements is necessary to achieve an accurate result. Each variable in this equation is interdependent, which means that if two are known, the third can be calculated.\n\nScientific Notation\n\nScientific notation is a way to express very large or very small numbers conveniently, which is particularly useful in fields like physics. It involves writing a number as a product of a decimal number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10, and a power of 10. For example, the number \\(1,336,000,000\\) can be daunting to read, but in scientific notation, it becomes \\(1.336 \\times 10^9\\), which is far easier to interpret and work with.\n\nIn the light speed calculation problem, the solution utilizes scientific notation to compare the calculated distance to the provided answers. This notation simplifies calculations and aids in understanding and communicating very large values, like the distances light can travel in vast, empty spaces such as outer space."
