One element of the case for statue removal has been that most of these statues never held a close chronological connection to the war; rather, they were the products of twentieth-century segregationists. This is an important point, as it demonstrates the way in which segregationists activated war memory to make overtly racist claims many decades later. However, the argument about the comparatively late arrival of these statues to public squares often obscures our understanding of a different type of commemoration—an aural one—that occurred in these same locales.\n\nDecades prior to placement of a bronze Robert E. Lee or marble Stonewall Jackson, many American parks, plazas, and boulevards where marked as commemorative spaces hostile to Black life. Musical compositions and performances, perhaps more holistically than other types of sources, allow us to recognize the ways in which spaces that excluded Black Americans during the period of slavery were swiftly reaffirmed as places hostile to Black lives during Reconstruction. To this end, the trauma of having a Confederate monument in a public space in 2022 is connected to a consistent trauma of having had crowds of people singing songs of the segregationist narrative during the crucial interregnum of Reconstruction. While physical monuments were added later, they had musical precursors that are relevant in recognizing the ways in which musical practices predate physical manifestations of Confederate commemoration.\n\nLocation: Baur Room\n\nAdmission: FREE\n\n7:30 p.m. Friday, March 3\n\nMARDI GRAS NEW ORLEANS JAZZ CONCERT\n\nCCM Jazz Orchestra\n\nFeaturing internationally acclaimed guest artist Ashlin Parker, trumpet\n\nScott Belck, music director\n\nA companion to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center’s Black History Month programming, the New Orleans Mardi Gras concert is a celebration of music and culture.

Cincinnati Opera presented the world premiere of Fellow Travelers in 2016 with a production that was conducted by CCM faculty member Mark Gibson and featured several alumni in the cast. A decade after its OF:NW workshop, Fellow Travelers finally makes its debut on the CCM stage! Fellow Travelers takes place in 1950s Washington, D.C. Timothy Laughlin is a recent Fordham graduate and devout Catholic who is eager to join the crusade against Communism. A chance encounter with a handsome, profligate State Department official, Hawkins Fuller, leads to Tim’s first job in D.C. and — after Fuller’s advances — his first love affair. As McCarthy mounts his desperate bid for power and internal investigations focus on “sexual subversives” during the “Lavender Scare,” Tim and Hawk find it dangerous to navigate their double lives. Drawn into a maelstrom of deceit and intrigue, Tim struggles to reconcile his political convictions, his love for God and his love for Fuller — an entanglement that will end in a stunning act of betrayal.

Guest speaker Psyche Loui, PhD, will present recent work that combines music theory and music technology with cross-cultural behavioral testing, neuropsychological assessments and neuroimaging studies in her lab on how and why humans across societies learn to love music, uncovering the role of different types of prediction on the dopaminergic reward system in the brain. These results are the first to highlight the process by which we learn from our predictions, and that learning itself becomes rewarding. Given that music taps into a relatively domain-general reward system which in turn motivates a variety of cognitive behaviors, Loui will also consider how this knowledge can be translated into music-based interventions for those with neurological and/or psychiatric disorders, presenting preliminary results on Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nLocation: Baur Room\n\nAdmission: FREE\n\n7 p.m. Friday, March 31\n\n• CCM DEI Committee Event •\n\nPRIDE ARTS SHOWCASE\n\nA cross-disciplinary event celebrating LGBTQIA+ artists and amplifying transgender and non-binary voices\n\nOn Transgender Day of Visibility, join the LGBTQIA+ community of Cincinnati and allies for the Pride Arts Showcase!

Eastman’s subjectivity as a queer African American musician and the narratives about his life strongly resonate with researchers and the public who are eager to excavate the work of Black artists and musicians. In writing a “long song” about Julius Eastman, this project brings together the fragments of Eastman’s work, focusing on his radical sonic expressions of and commentary on black being in compositions from the 1970s and 1980s. It serves as an initiative in music studies that offers tangible pathways of listening to Julius Eastman’s uncompromising and fierce musical engagements of refusal.\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nAdmission: FREE, but registration is required.
