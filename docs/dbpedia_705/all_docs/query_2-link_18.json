        "text": "This document lists all HydroCAD messages in numerical order. Messages are grouped into three categories based on severity:\n\nMessages # 1-31 are calculation Notes. They provide basic information about the calculations being performed.\n\nMessage # 35-62 are calculation Hints. They indicate items that may require further attention.\n\nMessage # 63-99 are calculation Warnings. They indicate a serious condition that must be investigated and addressed.\n\nMessage # 100-900 indicate that a certain operation has failed and could not be completed.\n\nCalculation Notes:\n\nGreen notes indicate normal calculation activities. Click on any item in the HydroCAD Message Window for a detailed explanation.\n\n[01] Note: {node} Duplicate node number skipped\n\nA node was encountered with a number that was already in use. The node is skipped, and the program continues to process any additional nodes.\n\nThis message usually occurs while adding a project that contains nodes that don't have unique numbers. Before adding a project, you should generally renumber any nodes with conflicting numbers. To add any nodes that were skipped, renumber the applicable nodes and add the project again.\n\nThe message can also occur when pasting nodes from the clipboard, or opening a project that contains duplicate node numbers.\n\nTip: To make a clone of an existing node use Ctrl-drag (rather than cut and paste.)\n\n[02] Note: Exceeded node capacity\n\nThe current project has exceeded the nominal node capacity of your program.\n\nYou can continue to work with the project, but you will not be able to save the project or produce multi-page reports unless you reduce the number of nodes. The automatic project backup will also be suspended until the number of nodes is reduced.\n\nWarning: If you're using the HydroCAD Sampler, your changes will be lost when the Sampler's time limit expires. To save your project you must reduce the number of nodes before the time limit expires.\n\n[03] Note: Added x nodes and updated y nodes\n\nThis message indicates the number of nodes that have been added and/or updated by the Project|Add or Project|Merge command.\n\n[04] Note: Repositioned x nodes\n\nThis message indicates that a number of nodes have been repositioned for better visibility. This occurs automatically if the nodes don't contain the expected position information. The repositioned nodes are selected and aligned in a row at the bottom of the routing diagram.\n\nThis situation occurs primarily with project files that are generated by another application with doesn't provide position information. To avoid automatic repositioning of nodes, be sure they have a valid position before the file is opened in HydroCAD.\n\n[10] Note: Updating to {node} as needed\n\nRouting calculations are being performed up to a specific node. To save time, downstream nodes are not being calculated, unless a dynamic or simultaneous routing method is selected. Any other nodes will be automatically updated when required.\n\n[13] Note: Time span = 5-20 hrs, dt= .05 hrs, 301 Points\n\nThis message indicates the time span and time increment (dt) being used to generate and route hydrographs. The message also indicates the number of points in the resulting hydrographs.\n\n[16] Note: Runoff by SCS TR-20 method, UH=SCS\n\nThis message indicates the method being used to produce runoff hydrographs.\n\nWhen using the SCS method, the message also indicates the Unit Hydrograph (UH) being employed.\n\nWhen using the Rational method, the message indicates the hydrograph rise/fall rates.\n\nThese parameters may be changed with Settings|Calculation.\n\n[18] Note: Sample County 10-Year Duration=20 min, Inten=4.30 in/hr, Cf=x.x\n\nThis message indicates the current IDF file and rainfall event, plus the duration, intensity, and frequency factor being used with the Rational method.\n\nThese parameters may be changed with Settings|Calculation, or by selecting another rainfall event.\n\n[19] Note: Type II 24-hr 10-Year Rainfall= 4.30\" x2, AMC=3, Ia/S=0.05\n\nThis message indicates the rainfall distribution, rainfall event name, and rainfall depth being used to generate runoff hydrographs.\n\nThe letter \"x\" indicates that several back-to-back storms are being generated, with the specified rainfall depth occurring in each of the storms.\n\nThe Antecedent Moisture Condition (AMC) is shown for dry, wet, or saturated conditions (1, 3 or 4). For normal conditions (AMC 2) the value is not shown.\n\nThe ratio of Ia to S is shown whenever the default value of 0.2 has been changed.\n\nThese parameters may be changed with Settings|Calculation.\n\n[22] Note: Reach routing by Stor-Ind+Trans method\n\nThis message indicates the method being used to perform hydrograph routing through each reach.\n\nThe routing method may be changed using Settings|Calculation.\n\n[25] Note: Pond routing by Stor-Ind method\n\nThis message indicates the method being used to perform hydrograph routing through each pond.\n\nThe routing method may be changed using Settings|Calculation.\n\n[28] Note: Updating {node}\n\nThis message indicates that runoff or routing calculations are being updated for a given node.\n\nRouting calculations are automatically updated as required to view or print reports. HydroCAD employs a \"minimal recalculation\" feature, so that only the required nodes are updated at any given time.\n\nUpstream nodes are automatically updated as required to produce a valid inflow. During a dynamic or simultaneous routing, any downstream nodes that contribute to a tailwater effect are updated concurrently. Otherwise, downstream nodes are just marked as \"invalid\" and will be updated as their results are required.\n\nAdditional information is available on the calculation process employed for each subcatchment, reach, pond, and link.\n\n[31] Note: Calculations complete\n\nThis message indicates that all the calculations required at this time have been completed.\n\nSome nodes may not have been updated, if their results were not immediately required.\n\nCalculation Hints:\n\nYellow hints indicate an unusual condition which may require attention. Click on any item in the HydroCAD Message Window for a detailed explanation.\n\n[35] Hint: This storm should not be rescaled\n\nThe current rainfall distribution is designed to be used at a preset storm duration (commonly 24 hours) and should not be rescaled to a different duration. Scaling to a different duration will adjust the peak intensity proportionately, which is generally incorrect.\n\nIf you are attempting to use a shorter version of this storm you may be able to use the \"Trim\" option instead of \"Rescale\". The trim option will \"zoom in\" to the center of the storm, preserving the peak intensity of the original rainfall distribution. For details read about the storm duration.\n\n[37] Hint: Longer time span advised for full volumes\n\nThe calculation time span may not be long enough to encompass the entire hydrograph duration. This may cause the reported hydrograph volume, runoff depth, and detention time to be less that the \"true\" values. Peak flows generally are not affected by this situation.\n\nIf you wish to study the entire hydrograph volume, you may set a longer time span on the Settings|Calculation screen.\n\nBefore increasing the time span, a visual inspection of the hydrograph is recommended. If the hydrograph is visibly truncated at the beginning or end, a longer time span is suggested. On the other hand, this message may be triggered by a relatively minor condition that does not merit a longer time span.\n\nCertain conditions, such as a base flow or a pond with an extended discharge, can also trigger this message. In these cases you may not need to set a longer time span. However, due to the extended duration of flow, the reported volumes will be dependent on the time span you select. [40] Hint: {node} Not described\n\nNo description has been entered for the node, or the data is incomplete. For a subcatchment, no runoff is produced. For a reach, pond, or link, any inflow is passed through unchanged.\n\nTo describe the node, select Node|Edit.\n\nAn undescribed node can be useful during initial design work, since it allows a node to be placed on the diagram but not described until later.\n\n[42] Hint: Gap in defined storage above volume #x at yyy'\n\nA gap exists in the storage data immediately above the specified volume. This is usually the result of missing storage data. To ensure accurate and stable results be sure you have defined all the available storage for the pond.\n\nWhen you use multiple storage definitions they can be contiguous (stacked one on top of the other) or overlapping (placed side-by-side). Since the volumes are being modeled as a single \"level pool\", they are assumed to be freely interconnected, so there must be some storage at any given elevation within the overall storage range. In some cases the \"missing\" volume could be a vertical pipe or catch basin, which could be included in the storage data as a vertical cylinder. But if the volumes are not interconnected they should not be modeled as a single pond.\n\n[43] Hint: {node} Has no inflow (Outflow=Zero)\n\nThis node has no inflow on the routing diagram, so it will produce no outflow unless it has a base flow and/or initial water surface elevation.\n\n[44] Hint: Pond Outlet Device x is below defined storage\n\nThe invert of the specified outlet device lies below the defined storage range, and therefore will cause an abrupt transition in the stage-discharge relationship which may make the routing unstable.\n\nFor optimum stability you should provide additional storage information down to the outlet invert. For example, if the outlet is installed in a sump at the bottom of a pond, you should generally include the storage volume of the sump in addition to the volume of the main pond. In addition to improving the stability of the model, the additional volume will generally improve the peak-attenuation capability of the pond.\n\nNote that this warning applies only to direct outlet devices. Downstream devices (such as the outlet of a riser structure) can generally be placed below the storage range without causing instability.\n\n[45] Hint: Subcat Runoff=Zero\n\nThe subcatchment has produced no runoff. This can occur in any of the following situations:\n\n1) The entire runoff may be occurring before or after the specified time span. To change the time span use Settings|Calculation.\n\n2) For the SCS or SBUH methods, the rainfall depth may be insufficient to generate any runoff as determined by the SCS runoff equation. This is normal when low rainfall depths are used in combination with low curve numbers.\n\n[46] Hint: Subcat Tc=0 (Instant runoff peak depends on dt)\n\nWhen the time-of-concentration is zero, the precipitation excess appears immediately as runoff. Since the calculated peak flow is based on the average over each time interval (dt), using a longer dt (in relation to the peak duration) will yield a lower \"peak\" flow.\n\nIf the instantaneous peak is required, reduce the dt. The dt may be changed using Settings|Calculation: Time Span.\n\nNote: The calculated runoff volume is not affected by the dt setting.\n\n[47] Hint: Subcat Peak is xxx% of capacity of segment #n\n\nThe peak runoff for the subcatchment has exceeded the nominal capacity of the specified flow segment. This may be acceptable if the flow segment is near the top of the subcatchment and isn't handling runoff from the entire area. Otherwise you should adjust the dimensions of the flow segment so that it is able to handle the total peak flow.\n\n[48] Hint: Subcat Peak<CiA due to short duration\n\nDue to the short rainfall duration, the peak runoff has not had time to attain the full value predicted by the Rational Method equation Q=CiA.\n\nIn order to attain the full peak, the rainfall duration must be greater than or equal to the Time-of-Concentration multiplied by the Rise Rate. Shorter durations will produce a proportionately lower peak.\n\nShort durations may also reduce the total runoff volume. For further details, see the Rise/Fall tab of the Calculation Settings screen.\n\n[49] Hint: Subcat Tc<2dt may require smaller dt\n\nWhen the time-of-concentration is less than twice the time increment (dt), the instantaneous peak may exceed the (average) hydrograph peak for a brief time (less than dt).\n\nIf the instantaneous peak is required, reduce the dt. A dt of one-half the smallest Tc will prevent this message from occurring. The dt may be changed using Settings|Calculation: Time Span.\n\nNote: The runoff volume is not affected by the dt setting.\n\n[51] Hint: xx Area used default ground cover / soil group\n\nWhen importing watershed data, a ground cover or soil group was not specified for all areas, so the default value was used for those areas. The message will also indicate the default that was used, plus the area to which it was applied.\n\nThe default ground cover and soil group are specified on the Settings|Watershed screen. When using a default value, be sure to draw all areas that should not use the default.\n\n[52] Hint: Reach Inlet/Outlet conditions not evaluated\n\nReach routing calculations assume normal-flow conditions in the channel or pipe. The software does not evaluate reach inlet conditions or tailwater, although these may often be a controlling factor.\n\nIf you wish to consider entrance losses, pressure flow, or other conditions for a pipe, it should be modeled as a pond with a culvert outlet. You can automatically convert a pipe reach to a pond with Node|Convert to Pond.\n\n[55] Hint: Reach Peak inflow is 1xx% of Manning's capacity\n\nThe reach is operating above its Manning's normal-flow capacity. This may be acceptable depending on the design criteria.\n\n[56] Hint: {device} started at x.xx hrs WSE=xxx.x'\n\nA dam breach or delayed outlet has commenced at the indicated time and water surface elevation. For details read about dam breach calculations.\n\n[57] Hint: Pond Peaked at xxx' (Flood elevation advised)\n\nThe peak water surface elevation is displayed. Since a flood elevation has not been specified, HydroCAD is unable to determine if this is an acceptable elevation.\n\nIf the peak elevation is higher than expected, make sure you have defined all necessary outlet devices. For example, if the level exceeds the top of your pond or catch basin, you must define a suitable overflow device. Otherwise, the elevation may attain an unrealistic level.\n\nIt is also recommended that you define a flood elevation for this node. This will allow a warning message to be automatically generated whenever the water surface exceeds the specified elevation. Setting a flood elevation will also improve calculation speed by allowing a better estimate of the elevation range prior to routing.\n\n[58] Hint: {node} Peaked x.x' above defined flood level\n\nThe peak depth in a reach or pond has exceeded the defined flood elevation. Routing continues as usual. (A separate warning message occurs whenever a reach or pond exceeds the highest defined stage.)\n\nThe significance of this message depends on the flood level that has been specified for this node. The message does not indicate that the calculations themselves have been compromised.\n\nIf the peak elevation is higher than expected, make sure you have defined all necessary outlet devices. For example, if the level exceeds the top of your pond or catch basin, you must define a suitable overflow device. Otherwise, the elevation may attain an unrealistic level.\n\n[59] Hint: Culvert outlet resized to xx\"\n\nThe specified culvert outlet or pipe reach has been resized according to the criteria established on the Resize tab of the Settings|Calculation form.\n\nCalculation Warnings:\n\nRed warning messages indicate that calculations have exceeded acceptable conditions. Runoff and routing results may not be reliable while any warning messages are present! Even with a \"failed\" system you need to resolve the warnings in order to accurately simulate the failure. Any \"Storage Exceeded\" or \"Oscillation\" warnings should be addressed first, since they may indicate problems that effect the entire model, and can cause secondary warnings to occur. Click on any item in the HydroCAD Message Window for a detailed explanation.\n\n[63] Warning: {node} Exceeded Reach x INLET depth by x.x' @ x.x hrs\n\nAt some time during the routing, the node's water surface elevation has exceeded the flow depth at the reach inlet, indicating a tailwater dependency, or even the potential for reverse flow. The message shows the maximum amount of reverse head and the time at which it occurred. See illustration.\n\nImportant: The reach routing calculations are not automatically changed to accommodate this situation, even though the higher tailwater may in reality cause a reduction in flow, or even a reverse flow. The routing continues to be performed without tailwater effects or reverse flow, as if a one-way valve were preventing any backflow. The user is responsible for adjusting the model in any way that is deemed necessary to accommodate this situation.\n\nNote: If the reach is being used to connect two ponds, you may want to remove the reach and connect one pond directly to the next. This will provide additional capabilities for handling the tailwater effects.\n\n[64] Warning: {node} Exceeded Reach x outlet bank by x.x' @ x.x hrs\n\nAt some time during the routing, the node's water surface elevation has exceeded the top of bank at the reach outlet, indicating a likely overflow. The message shows the maximum exceedance and the time at which it occurred. See illustration.\n\nImportant: The reach routing calculations are not automatically changed to accommodate the potential overflow. The user is responsible for adjusting the model in any way that is deemed necessary to accommodate this situation.\n\nNote: This warning is generated only for an open channel, and not for a (closed) pipe reach.\n\n(This message was added in HydroCAD 10.20-3b)\n\n[65] Warning: Reach Inlet elevation not specified\n\nThe reach inlet elevation has not been specified. This information is required in order to detect potential tailwater effects.\n\nNote: An undefined invert elevation commonly occurs with projects that were imported from HydroCAD 5 or earlier. These projects considered only the reach depth, and had no knowledge of the reach elevation in relation to other nodes.\n\nUse Node|Edit:Profile to specify the inlet elevation for each reach.\n\n[67] Warning: {node} Inflow not allowed - Ignored\n\nThis node cannot accept an inflow hydrograph. The inflow is ignored.\n\nSeparate procedures are available if you need to route a hydrograph through a subcatchment.\n\n[68] Warning: Import data skipped\n\nSome of the imported data could not be fully processed. The data that was skipped is listed before this message, and in the project notes.\n\nThis warning may occur when importing data from TR-20. In order to properly replicate the results obtained with the original data, the skipped items must be manually incorporated into the HydroCAD project.\n\nAfter incorporating the skipped items, you should open the Project|Notes screen and update that information accordingly.\n\n[70] Warning: Subcat Tc<8dt requires smaller dt\n\nThe rising limb of a Rational Method hydrograph contains fewer than eight ordinates. A smaller dt is recommended in order to accurately represent the hydrograph. (A dt of .01 hours is generally appropriate for most Rational method calculations.) Inspection of the hydrograph is also advised.\n\nThe dt may be changed using Settings|Calculation: Time Span.\n\n[73] Warning: Subcat Peak may fall outside time span\n\nThe calculated runoff peak isn't within the middle 90% of the specified time span. Under these conditions, the reported \"peak\" is the highest flow within the time span, and may not be the true peak.\n\nInspect the hydrograph and change the time span to include the peak. The time span may be changed using Settings|Calculation: Time Span.\n\n[74] Warning: xx Area has no ground cover/soil group\n\nWhen importing watershed data, a ground cover or soil group was not specified for certain areas. The message will indicate the amount of area that had no ground cover or soil group.\n\nBecause a ground cover or soil group was not specified, the Curve Number cannot be determined for these areas. To resolve the problem, revise the input data or specify default values on the Settings|Watershed screen.\n\n[75] Warning: Subcatchment xx area mismatch\n\nWhen importing watershed data, the total area of a subcatchment did not match the sum of the individual subareas. The message will indicate the actual difference in areas.\n\nThe situation is usually caused by mismatched (overlapping) subcatchment boundaries, which will also generate a skipped line message message for each overlapping area. To locate the overlaps, right-click each \"skipped line\" and select Find Entity. This will center and flash each entity on the drawing.\n\nTo view the areas associated with each subcatchment, select the node on the HydroCAD routing diagram.\n\n[76] Warning: Reach Detained x.xx AF (Pond w/culvert advised)\n\nA pipe reach has filled with water, causing the flow to be limited and the excess volume to be detained without head.\n\nIMPORTANT: Pipe reach calculations assume normal-flow conditions in the pipe. If you wish to consider entrance losses, pressure flow, or other conditions, the pipe should be modeled as a pond with a culvert outlet.\n\n[77] Warning: Pond Manual tailwater submerged device # by x.x'\n\nThe pond's manual tailwater elevation exceeds an outlet device which is not tailwater-aware. This message occurs when the manual tailwater setting is above the invert of one of the pond's final outlet device(s), and that device is not able to respond to tailwater conditions.\n\nImportant: The pond routing calculations are not altered by this situation, even though the manual tailwater may reduce the pond's actual discharge. The routing continues to be performed based on the existing stage-discharge relationship, as if the tailwater did not exist.\n\nThis message can occur only for specific types of outlet devices that are unable to respond to tailwater conditions, such as exfiltration and some special outlets. To resolve the situation, either adjust the existing device to accommodate the tailwater, or switch to another device that has the ability to respond to tailwater, such as a weir or orifice.\n\n[78] Warning: {node} Submerged Pond x device # by x.x'\n\nThe node's peak water surface elevation has submerged the specified pond outlet device. This message occurs when the peak elevation (tailwater) rises above the invert of one of the pond's final outlet device(s), and that device is not able to respond to tailwater conditions.\n\nImportant: The pond routing calculations are not altered by this situation, even though the tailwater may reduce the pond's actual discharge. The routing continues to be performed based on the existing stage-discharge relationship, as if the tailwater did not exist.\n\nThis message can occur only for specific types of outlet devices that are unable to respond to tailwater conditions, such as exfiltration and some special outlets. To resolve the situation, either adjust the existing device to accommodate the tailwater, or switch to another device that has the ability to respond to tailwater, such as a weir or orifice.\n\nNote: This message does not indicate a potential reverse-flow condition. A separate message is generated whenever a reverse-flow potential exists.\n\n[79] Warning: {node} Submerged Pond x device # by x.x'\n\nThe node's peak water surface elevation has submerged the specified pond outlet device. This message occurs when the peak elevation (tailwater) rises above the invert of one of the pond's final outlet device(s).\n\nImportant: The pond routing calculations are not altered by this situation, even though the tailwater may reduce the pond's actual discharge. The routing continues to be performed based on the existing stage-discharge relationship, as if the tailwater did not exist.\n\nSince a static stage-discharge curve cannot accommodate a variable tailwater, the tailwater must be specified manually using Node|Edit:Tailwater. If one of these tailwater options isn't sufficient, an alternate routing method may be required, such as the Dynamic Storage-Indication method. The user is responsible for adjusting the model in any way that is deemed necessary to accommodate this situation.\n\nNote: This message does not indicate a potential reverse-flow condition. A separate message is generated whenever a reverse-flow potential exists.\n\n[80] Warning: {node} Exceeded Pond x by x.x' @ x.x hrs (x.x cfs x.x af)\n\nAt some point during the routing, the node's water surface elevation has exceeded the water surface elevation of an inflowing pond, indicating a possible reverse flow. The message shows the maximum amount of reverse head, the time at which it occurred, and an estimate of the potential reverse flow.\n\nIn some situations, the reverse head may be caused by an excessively large time increment. Reduce the dt or increase the finer routing increment to see if this reduces or eliminates the problem. Certain routing methods may require a finer routing increment when two adjacent nodes have very similar water surface elevations.\n\nImportant: The pond routing is not altered by this situation, even though the higher tailwater may in reality cause a reverse flow. The routing continues to be performed as if a one-way valve were preventing the backflow. The user is responsible for adjusting the model in any way that is deemed necessary to accommodate this situation. If the potential reverse flow volume is significant in proportion to the total outflow volume, you can consider modeling a reverse flow, which will also suppress this warning.\n\nNote: This and other warning messages can be triggered by basic routing failures, such as oscillations. If any oscillation warnings are present, these must be resolved first.\n\n[81] Warning: {node} Exceeded Pond x by x.x' @ x.x hrs\n\nAt some point during the routing, the node's water surface elevation has exceeded the water surface elevation of an inflowing pond, indicating a possible tailwater dependency. The message shows the maximum amount of reverse head and the time at which it occurred.\n\nImportant: The pond routing is not altered by this situation, even though the higher tailwater may in reality cause a reduced discharge. To remedy the situation, select a pond routing method that is able to handle tailwater effects, such as the Dynamic Storage-Indication method.\n\nNote: This and other warning messages can be triggered by basic routing failures, such as oscillations. If any oscillation warnings are present, these must be resolved first.\n\n[82] Warning: Early inflow requires earlier time span\n\nSome inflow may be occurring before the beginning of the specified time span, and is therefore not included in the routing. An earlier time span is required in order to include the early part of the inflow hydrograph.\n\nThe time span may be changed using Settings|Calculation: Time Span.\n\n[85] Warning: {node} Oscillations may require smaller dt or Finer Routing\n\nThe outflow of a pond or reach contains a greater number of peaks than the inflow. This suggests that oscillations were induced by the routing and that the routing results may not be valid! The severity rating indicates the magnitude of the problem. A low severity rating (starting at 1) may be acceptable, while a high rating (in the hundreds) indicates a major problem. For details and solutions please read about oscillations.\n\n[86] Warning: {node} Oscillations may require smaller dt\n\nThe outflow of a pond or reach contains a greater number of peaks than the inflow. This suggests that oscillations were induced by the routing and that the routing results may not be valid! The severity rating indicates the magnitude of the problem. A low severity rating (starting at 1) may be acceptable, while a high rating (in the hundreds) indicates a major problem.\n\nFor a more stable routing use the DSI procedure instead of SimRoute. For additional details and solutions please read about oscillations.\n\n[87] Warning: {node} Oscillations may require smaller dt or Finer Routing\n\nThe outflow of a pond or reach contains a greater number of peaks than the inflow. This suggests that oscillations were induced by the routing and that the routing results may not be valid! The severity rating indicates the magnitude of the problem. A low severity rating (starting at 1) may be acceptable, while a high rating (in the hundreds) indicates a major problem. For details and solutions please read about oscillations.\n\n[88] Warning: {node} Qout>Qin may require smaller dt or Finer Routing\n\nThe peak outflow of a pond or reach was greater than the peak inflow. This can occur if the storage is very small in relation to the inflow volume, or if there are abrupt changes in the stage-discharge curve or inflow hydrograph.\n\nExamine the hydrograph plot. In some cases, this message may be triggered by normal routing conditions. If a visual inspection confirms the presence of routing problems, they can usually be corrected by using a smaller time increment (dt)\n\nIf the problem is not resolved by using the smallest available time increment, you may be able to resolve the problem by setting the finer routing value to 2 or 3 for that particular node. (See the Advanced tab of the applicable node.)\n\nIf this fails to correct the problem, the available storage may be too small to permit an accurate routing for this node, or there may be an overfilled storage condition that needs to be corrected.\n\n[89] Warning: {node} Qout>Qin may require smaller dt\n\nThe peak outflow of a pond or reach was greater than the peak inflow. This can occur if the storage is very small in relation to the inflow volume, or if there are abrupt changes in the stage-discharge curve or inflow hydrograph.\n\nExamine the hydrograph plot. In some cases, this message may be triggered by normal routing conditions. If a visual inspection confirms the presence of routing problems, reduce the time increment (dt) until the situation is corrected. This may require a reduction to the minimum dt of 0.01 hours.\n\nIf you are using the Sim-Route procedure, the available storage may be too small to permit an accurate routing. When modeling very small ponds, catch basins, or manholes, the Dyn-Stor-Ind method may produce better results. Also, try the Catch basin option for the applicable ponds.\n\n[90] Warning: {node} Qout>Qin may require smaller dt or Finer Routing\n\nThe peak outflow of a pond or reach was greater than the peak inflow. This can occur if the storage is very small in relation to the inflow volume, or if there are abrupt changes in the stage-discharge curve or inflow hydrograph.\n\nExamine the hydrograph plot. In some cases, this message may be triggered by normal routing conditions. If a visual inspection confirms the presence of routing problems, they can usually be eliminated by increasing the finer routing value on the Setting|Calculation screen or by reducing the overall time increment (dt). If this fails to correct the problem, the available storage may be too small to permit an accurate routing for this node.\n\n[91] Warning: Reach Storage range exceeded by xx'\n\nThe water surface elevation has exceeded the highest defined stage. Routing continues using a linear extrapolation of the storage and discharge curves, which may produce unreliable results.\n\nImportant: For accuracy, you must extend the stage-storage data in order to prevent extrapolation.\n\n[92] Warning: Pond Outlet Device x is above defined storage\n\nThe invert of the specified outlet device lies above the defined storage range, and therefore does not contribute to the pre-calculated stage-discharge curve. This can result in no flow being allowed through the device. This situation also suggests that you may not be defining all the storage that actually exists in the pond.\n\nImportant: In order for the device to be properly evaluated, additional storage information must be provided so that the device falls within the defined storage range. There should be at least one defined stage above the top of the highest outlet device. Details here.\n\nWhen using outlet devices such as a weir, remember that storage does exists above the crest of the weir. Even if the pond's surface area remains the same (i.e. has vertical sides) there will be additional storage as the water starts to flow over the weir. In order to obtain an accurate routing, you must provide storage information for this operating range. If storage data is not provided, HydroCAD assumes zero storage in this range, and the routing results will be inaccurate.\n\n[93] Warning: Pond Storage range exceeded by xx'\n\nThe water surface elevation has exceeded the highest defined stage. All defined storage has been filled. Routing continues by applying additional head to the outlet(s), but without utilizing any additional storage. In essence, the pond has been extended upward as a pencil-thin chamber with no additional storage. (For details, see the pond's stage-storage plot.)\n\nImportant: For accuracy, you must define additional storage in order to accurately represent the physical situation being modeled. This may consist of additional stage-storage data and/or storage chambers, as required to describe the actual storage. The additional storage may also resolve other warnings (such as oscillations) that can result from inadequate storage.\n\nThis warning commonly results from a failure to provide storage data above the highest outlet device, such as an emergency spillway. Although you may not intend to utilize this storage, complete storage information is required in order to perform an accurate routing. When using custom stage-storage data, the situation is easily resolved by entering storage at one or more elevations above the upper-most outlet.\n\nIt is also possible that you have failed to include an overflow device for the pond, causing the elevation to rise beyond the expected level.\n\nNote: If the storage volume is actually sealed (no additional storage is available) then the warning does not necessarily indicate a problem. Under these conditions the storage volume will become pressurized.\n\n[95] Warning: Pond Outlet Device x rise exceeded\n\nThe water level has exceeded the rise of the specified outlet device (usually a weir), but no matching device was found to handle the flow at higher elevations. Calculations will continue using orifice flow through the specified rise, but without using any additional flow area.\n\nImportant: To obtain accurate results, you probably need to define another outlet device (generally a weir) to handle the flow that will occur when the headwater exceeds the top of the lower weir. In order to suppress this message, the invert of the upper weir must be equal to the lower weir's invert plus its rise.\n\nNote: When using a custom weir to model an orifice, including a final zero-width stage will suppress this warning message.\n\nFor details read about weir rise.\n\n[96] Warning: Pond Channel Outlet x depth exceeded by yy\n\nThe water surface elevation in the pond has exceeded the depth of the outlet channel by the specified amount. Routing continues using the maximum channel capacity, without making any allowance for the additional head.\n\nImportant: To obtain an accurate routing you must increase the channel size to accommodate the actual flow. Otherwise the excess will be detained until the WSE drops below the top of the channel.\n\n(This message was added in HydroCAD 10.1)\n\n[97] Warning: Reach Factor X Out Of Range\n\nThe X-factor used by the Muskingum-Cunge routing procedure has exceeded the permissible range of 0.0 to 0.5. The routing has been performed using the corresponding limit.\n\nImportant: To obtain a valid routing, you must adjust the routing parameters as required to produce a coefficient within the expected range. For further details see the routing results in the reach summary, as well as the description of the Muskingum-Cunge routing procedure.\n\n[98] Warning: Max. Lift of x.xx' exceeds pump rating\n\nAt some time during the routing, the required lift was greater than the pump could deliver. No pump flow occurs under these conditions. If you intend to operate the pump at this lift, you should insert additional points at the beginning of the rating table to adequately describe the pump flow under high head (low flow) conditions.\n\n[99] Warning: Min. Lift of x.xx' is below pump rating\n\nAt some time during the routing, the pump lift was below the range specified by the rating curve. Under these conditions, the pump flow is assumed to be the highest value specified in the rating table. If you intend to operate the pump at this lift, you should add additional points at the end of the rating table to adequately describe the pump flow under low head (high flow) conditions.\n\nOther Messages:\n\nThese messages may be displayed in conjunction with other HydroCAD operations."
