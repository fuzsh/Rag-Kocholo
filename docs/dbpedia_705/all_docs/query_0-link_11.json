The West Virginia Structural Health Monitoring System (SHM Project) will conduct planning and initial installation efforts for the implementation of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system at the East Huntington cable-stay structure on the Ohio River along the Ohio-West Virginia state line in Cabell County, WV. Consultant will identify critical features of the monitoring system during SHM Project planning as well as determine improvements to asset management strategy utilizing the system’s data and repeatability and use on all types of bridge structures. The consultant will propose utilizing structural health monitoring equipment to provide real-time data. The specific technology to be used will be decided during the planning phase of the Stage 1 effort and will be selected based on current and anticipated future capabilities of the equipment, flexibility for use in varied structural settings, installation opportunities and challenges, and available monitoring data and its ability to assist WVDOH decision-making for possible incident response and long-term asset management. Through the planning process and determination of the structural health monitoring equipment, the consultant, with direct oversight from the WVDOH, will address any and all challenges through collection of real-time information on at-risk and priority structures to confirm critical structural members, reduction in lane and structure closures to minimize impact to commuters and freight, and prioritization of needs for asset management within the WVDOH overall transportation system. Consultant will also show through the SHM Project, ways to increase safety of the structure utilizing SHM equipment through identification of areas of structural concern within minutes as opposed to waiting for an incident or annual/special inspections. The SHM Project is to also show reliability of vehicular traffic and commerce on national highway assets by using monitoring data to assist with maintaining these assets strategically and reopening bridges to continued highway operations more quickly after an incident, which decreases the possibility of a major roadway detour due to a bridge closure and, in turn, provides travel time, safety, and emissions benefits.\n\nAdditional information may be obtained by contacting Edward Armbruster, Operations Division, at Edward.F.Armbruster@wv.gov or William Murray, Operations Division, at Bill.R.Murray@wv.gov.
