When I checked the battery level, one indicator light was on which shows that the battery level is %21-%40 according to Fenix operating instructions page https://www.fenixlighting.com/product/fenix-hm65-rechargeable-headlamp/. After trying different combination of lighting for a while the battery level dropped below %20, one indicator was flashing which means it's almost empty.\n\nSo, I plugged in my original Samsung phone charger https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/m...icrousb-usb-cable-white-ep-ta20jweusta/#specs . Immediately three lights were on constantly and the fourth indicator was flashing as in this video:\n\nThis situation didn't change for 4 hours from the very first second of plugging in the charger till it got fully charged. After 4 hours four indicators were on constantly which means that charging had been completed.\n\nIt took 4 hours to fully charge even it's said it takes two hours in its user manual and on its official web page. But what's more interesting is that it started to get charged with three indicators on and one flashes constantly till it get fully charged. Why it didn't act as it's said on its official web page \"In charging process, one indicator flashes: below 20%, one constant-on and one flashes: 21%-50%, two constant-on and one flashes: 51%-80%, three constant-on and one flashes: 81% – 95%, four constant-on: charging complete.\"?\n\nIs there anything wrong with my headlamp?\n\nAnother issue is that Is Fenix lying about run time of this headlamp hm65r? I thought so after reading BrightLight and 71k5' threads http://budgetlightforum.com/node/68966 and amazon.com reviews like:\n\n\" 1,400 lumens for 2 hours, false and not true – reduces to lower lumen after 15 mins\n\nReviewed in the United States on November 1, 2019\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nJust got this in the mail 2 days ago. I was testing the 1,400-lumen stage on both of the lamps to see if it would last 2 hours as the website described. Didn't last 15 mins before the housing got too hot. I think there's a fail switch that if it gets too hot than it has to drop to the lower lumen setting. I'm not sure if this is like for all high lumen head light or if it's because the battery is right next to the housing causing it to be too hot. Either way, be aware of the 2-hour setting at 1,400 – not true. Also did it with full battery and same thing. I'm really disappointed, also Fenix said they made this particular brand in China. Not impressed! Item was returned due to false advertising. I tried looking at the manual that came with it, nothing in there says that the mechanism in the housing would reset after 15 mins if it gets too hot. I understand it gets hot in there but if you're going to mention that you can hold 1,400 lumens at 2 hours than you need to make sure you can do that with the correct housing to handle the heat. False adv.\".\n\nIf so, I'll return it.\n\nTwo days ago, I bought Fenix HM65R.

False adv.\".\n\nIf so, I'll return it.\n\nFirst I'd like to address the problem regarding the battery indicator lights and apparent charging difficulties. We can verify that the Samsung wall adapter that you linked above should indeed work. We actually have one of them that we use in our repair center! One thing to note is that there are at least two different Samsung wall adapters that look pretty much exactly the same. The Samsung Fast Charging wall plug that you linked to should work but there is another 3A wall plug that will not. Again, these look nearly identical. Please check to make sure that you are using the correct one. The problem with the lights staying steady even though the battery is probably not that full sounds like it is an incompatibility with either the wall plug or the micro-USB cable.\n\nIn regards to the runtime: Yes, the HM65R does indeed get hot! It has to drop down so it does not overheat and damage the unit. The advertised 2 hours is an accumulated runtime. You will notice that on the specifications chart in the product images that it says \"The Turbo output is measured in total of runtime including output at reduced levels due to temperature or protection mechanism in the design\"\n\nThis is saying that you can run the light on Turbo for 2 total hours, not 2 consecutive hours.\n\nI hope this helps!"
