        "text": "Show 8pm\n\nGA tickets are standing room only, with very limited seating available first come, first served.\n\nVentura Music Hall Presents:\n\nCÃU\n\nwith PAUL BEAUBRUN\n\nIn 2007, CÃ©u debuted her self-titled album, becoming one of the select Brazilian artists nominated for an American Grammy in the World Music category. This groundbreaking album soared to the top of Billboardâs âHeatseekerâ and âWorld Musicâ charts, also reaching an impressive number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100. Notably, it marked the highest chart position achieved by a Brazilian artist in the U.S. since Astrud Gilberto's \"Girl From Ipanema\" in 1963.\n\nWith six albums to her credit, CÃ©u has repeatedly claimed the number one spot on both the US and Canadian iTunesâ world music charts. Her remarkable achievements include eight Latin Grammy nominations and three wins, notably for her albums Tropix (2017) and Apka! (2020). In 2020, her last two albums dominated airwaves, becoming the most played records on over 200 college and community radio stations across the United States and Canada, within the Latin Music and World Music categories, according to the NACC charts.\n\nCÃ©u's music has transcended borders, captivating audiences on five continents at prestigious festivals such as the Montreal Jazz Festival (CA), North Sea Jazz (NL), Coachella (USA), Roskilde (DK), Rock in Rio (BRA), and Lollapalooza (BRA). Notable performances include memorable appearances in Havana (Cuba) and Beirut (Lebanon). Renowned for her collaborations with both Brazilian and international artists like Duran Duran, Herbie Hancock, Jorge Ben Jor, Gilberto Gil, and Emicida, CÃ©u stands among the few Brazilian artists to grace the stage of BBCâs Laterâ¦with Jools Holland. Her albums and live performances regularly earn accolades, garnering placements on esteemed publications' Best World Music lists worldwide, including The New York Times, Billboard, The Guardian, Mojo Magazine, Wired, Sunday Times, Les Inrockuptibles, Telerama, O Globo, and Folha de S. Paulo.\n\nContinuing to enchant audiences in her native Brazil and touring worldwide, CÃ©u is widely regarded as one of the most influential Brazilian artists of her generation.\n\nPaul Beaubrun -\n\nA scion of Haitian musical royalty, Paul has spent his life living to the beat. Son of the Grammy nominated band Boukman Eksperyans, his earliest memories are of rhythm and sound. Moving to New York as a youth he was inspired by his heritage to begin crafting a sound all his own. Constantly aware of his roots, the struggle of an immigrant and the drive of New York life, Paul began to create a path where music, activism and history meet.\n\nA unique and transfixing sound he calls 'Roots/Blues,' Paul weaves his impeccable guitar skills, rich, vocals, musical ingenuity and cultural history together; all while performing a smooth melange of both English, French and Creole (the native tongue of his Haitian roots).\n\nPaul has played alongside some of the world's best artists including Ms. Lauryn Hill, Maxwell, Arcade Fire, Jackson Browne and Bob Weir. Worldwide performances include venues such as The Beacon Theater and Radio City Music Hall in NYC, Massey Hall in Toronto, The Ryman Theatre in Nashville, The House of Blues in Chicago, The Montreal Jazz Festival, Festival Internationale Nuits d'Afrique in Montreal, Le Trianon in Paris, The Paleo Festival in Switzerland, No Siesta Fiesta in Norway. These continued accomplishments make him one of the few artists coming out of Haiti to garner worldwide success.\n\nPaul has joined forces with Artists for Peace and Justice, and become an integral part of their organization. He also continues to be an active member and perform at their many events in the USA and Canada. This allows Paul to do what he loves; play music while also furthering awareness of Haitian art, culture and promoting the incredible talent of Haiti's youth.\n\nPaul's album titled 'Vilnerab,' released in 2015, soared directly to #1 on itunes in the World Music category, receiving rave reviews. In 2016, he was nominated for a Dora Award by the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts for 'Outstanding Sound Design/Composition' in the production of Espwa/Espoir. Paul released \"Ayibobo\" in May of 2018 on Ropeadope Records, this albums sees Paul's evolution of sound into Rock/Roots/Blues music. In 2020 he released \"Rasanbleman\" on Ropeadope records, a live album and documentary including many different featuring artists from Haiti.\n\nHe is also part of \"Let The Rhythm Lead: Haiti Song Summit Vol. 1,\" a collaborative album project including other songwriters Jackson Browne, Habib KoitÃ©, Jenny Lewis, RaÃºl RodrÃ­guez, Jonathan Russell, and Jonathan Wilson, with members of the Haitian roots band Lakou Mizik released in 2020.\n\nPaul is currently on a world tour with Arcade Fire as a member of the band and has appeared recently with the band on SNL, The Tonight Show and at festivals globally.\n\nShow 8pm\n\nGA tickets are standing room only, with very limited seating available first come, first served.\n\nVentura Music Hall Presents:\n\nBRETT DENNEN\n\nAcross his career, Brett Dennen has established himself as the kind of singer-songwriter who finds inspiration by digging into the nooks and crannies of the human conditionâexploring pain, joy, sadness, and all points in between. If It Takes Forever (Mick Music), the California nativeâs eighth solo album and first full-length since 2021âs See the World, is no exception. The warm, immersive collection boasts deeply felt sentiments, underpinned by rich acoustic guitars and Dennenâs earnest vocals, in the vein of dusky Americana (âGolden State of Mindâ), harmonica-driven blues (the Tom Petty-esque âCareful What You Wish Forâ), rootsy indie (âDonât Go Talkingâ), and meditative folk-rock (highlight âTime To Wake Upâ).\n\nIf It Takes Forever emerged out of a tough 2023 for Dennen, as he was dealing with the death of his dad. âHe was such a strong figure in my life that I depended on so much as both a dad and a best friend,â he said. âAnd I knew immediately in order for me to deal with his death, the best thing I could do was to make an album about it.â\n\nUnderstandably, Dennen took his time coming up with song ideas for If It Takes Forever, and spent the bulk of a year simply thinking about âwhat kind of album I was going to make and what kinds of songs were going to be on the album,â he says. âI jotted down ideas on paper, made little voice memos with ideas of songs, melodies and choruses, or sometimes even just talked into a voice recorder.â\n\nÂ\n\nWith these ideas as a foundation, Dennen was well-prepared by the time he hunkered down in late 2023 to formalize his rough ideas into songs. âMaking them a reality all happened very fast,â he says. âThese songs were in my head and came out when I had the guitar in my hand. I would record one, put it away and then come back a few days or a few weeks later and listen to it: âOkay, I think that's done. That's good enough. Move on, move on, move on.ââ\n\nÂ\n\nDennen naturally wrote some songs directly about his dad. But he also wanted If It Takes Forever to tackle his new reality going forward. âIt was evaluating lifeâlike, what did this person mean to me?â he says. âWhat did they inspire in me? What do I think life is about now? Who's the person I really want to be?â But he also found himself turning to broader philosophical questions. âI was also thinking about the state of life: What is life? What does it mean? What's it all about?â\n\nÂ\n\nThis lent itself to lyrics full of vibrant imagery with multiple layers of meaning. Among his favorite songs is the gentle, folksy âIn the Garden,â which was indirectly inspired by his parents and the impressive vegetable garden they tended. âI don't necessarily think it's a song about my dadâor a song about him speaking to my mom, per seâbut I think it's a song about love and putting your intention into something,â Dennen explains. âMetaphorically, itâs about taking care of something and creating something beautiful, but itâs also a literal place for beautiful things to grow, and a calm place to find solace in.â\n\nÂ\n\nAnother favorite is âWood Canoe,â a narrative-driven story of humble man who has a knack for building a canoe out of wood, with lyrics speaking to the idea of metaphorically taking somebody away to a better place, he explains. âIt feels like a Cat Stevens song and has a little bit of Latin rhythm to it.â Dennen also loves âAnother Day in Babylonâ because of its rumbling grooveâand the fact itâs very literal, as he based the lyrics on things that happened in his own life.\n\nThe easygoing opening track, âChipping Away,â meanwhile, touches on resilience and the importance of persevering even when things might not be falling into place the way youâd like. âThere's so many things I want to do and so many things I haven't doneâand I'm the one holding myself back from doing those things,â he explains. âBut that's just life, I guessâand here's an opportunity to celebrate that.â\n\nÂ\n\nDennen recorded If It Takes Forever quickly, âin a whirlwind five daysâ in Los Angeles with the musicians in his live band and another long-time collaborator serving as producer, Jon Solo. This full-band configuration gave the album a distinct feeling of immediacy but also lends itself to depth-filled arrangements. Organ courses through the standout âDharma Babyâ while plaintive piano adds sharp melancholy to the meditative âStar Surfer.â\n\nâWe haven't recorded an album together before now,â he notes. âBut it was easy to trust everyone and get excited about what we were creating together. We felt like a team; I've never had that feeling before. Thatâs why I think it was easy to get so much done in a short amount of time.â\n\nÂ\n\nIn general, Dennen prefers recording live with a band anyway. But the bond he had formed with his bandmates across years of traveling around together on the road made the If It Takes Forever experience especially seamlessânamely because everyone contributed parts and ideas in the studio during the process. âI was really impressed with everybody's ability to help me get to a place where I was feeling good about the direction it was going,â he says. âIt wasn't me or the producer saying, âI want you to do this. I was hoping you would do this.â It wasn't like âThis is Brettâs albumââit was like, let's just make this music the best that the four of us can make it.â\n\nSince debuting in 2004 with a self-titled album, Dennen has amassed a loyal fanbase thanks to a steady touring schedule, including alongside artists like John Mayer, Jason Mraz and G Love and Special Sauce, as well as multiple song placements in the TV show Parenthood. Another tune, \"Comeback Kid (That's My Dog),\" became the theme song for the TV adaptation About A Boy. Along the way, Dennen has also had multiple top 10 hits on the AAA radio charts, with the keening title track of See the World, an encouraging song about growing up and forging your own path in life, landing at No. 4 in 2021.\n\nÂ\n\nWith If It Takes Forever, Dennen plans to hit the road once again, but he possesses additional perspective onâand gratitude forâthe solace provided by art and music. âTo really boil it down, this is life,â he says. âLife is full of things that get complicated and make you busy, and are really hard to deal with. But if you write songs about it, and put it into art, then it makes it a lot more relevant and meaningful and worthy of celebration.â\n\nShow 8pmÂ\n\nGA tickets are standing room only, with very limited seating available first come, first served.Â\n\nVentura Music Hall Presents:\n\nY LA BAMBA & KILTRO\n\nY La Bamba -Â\n\nTo declare one thematic narrative from Lucha, Y La Bambaâs seventh album, would be to chisel away a story within a story within a story into the illusion of something singular.\n\nâLucha is a symbol of how hard it is for me to tackle healing, live life, and be present,â Luz Elena Mendoza Ramos, lead vocalist and producer of Y La Bamba, says of the title behind the album which translates from Spanish to English as âfightâ and is also a nickname for Luz, which means light. The album explores multiplicityâlove, queerness, Mexican American and Chicanx identity, family, intimacy, yearning, lonelinessâand chronicles a period of struggle and growth for Mendoza Ramos as a person and artist.\n\nLucha was born out of isolation at the advent of COVID-19 lockdowns, beginning with a cover of Hank Williamsâ âIâm So Lonesome I Could Cry,â and following Mendoza Ramos as she moved from Portland, Oregon to Mexico City, returning to her parentsâ home country while revisiting a lineage marred by violence and silence, and simultaneously reaching towards deeper relationships with loved ones and herself. The album reflects âanother tier of facing vulnerability,â as Mendoza Ramos explains, and is a battle cry to fight in order to be seen and to be accepted, if not celebrated, in every formâanger and compassion, externally and internally, individually and societally. As much as la lucha is about inner work, fighting is borne from survival stemming from social structures designed to uplift dominant groups at the hands of suffering amongst the marginalized.\n\nWhile peeling back layers of the past to better understand the present has been integral to this period of growth for Mendoza Ramos, time, trauma, and history can feel like interconnected, abysmal loops and music has remained a trusted space for Mendoza Ramos to process, experiment, and channel her learnings into a creative practice. In this way, Lucha has become cyclical, documenting the parallel trust Mendoza Ramos has built with herself to allow the songs to guide how they should be sung, or even sound.\n\nâIâve been wanting to let whatever feels naturalâwith rhythm and musical instruments like congas and singingâto just let it be, in the way that Iâm trying to invoke in myself.â Lucha reflects on, âthe continuing process of learning how to exercise my producing skills,â explains Mendoza Ramos. âI have so many words, ideas to work with all the time, and the hardest part for me has been learning to trust my gut. And figuring out how I work best, and with who.â\n\nThe result is a collection as sonically sprawling and bold as its subject matter. On âLa Lluvia de Guadalajara,â Y La Bamba leans into a minimal, avant-garde soundscape as Mendoza Ramos recites a spoken word poem. Later, rhythms veer into bossa nova territory on âHues ft. Devendra Banhart,â a full-circle collaboration for Mendoza Ramos as she reminisces on the significance of finding Banhartâs work nearly two decades earlier: âHe was the first young Spanish-speaking musician that wasnât playing traditional Mexican music I heard when I was 21. There was nothing like it around that time.â\n\nâNuncaâ is a warm, wind-rich track dedicated to her mother, Maria Elena Ramos whose poetry is published alongside the Lucha lyrics booklet. âI decided to put my momâs poem, which is a poem that she wrote to me, letting me know how she felt, exploring her heart in new ways sheâs never imagined. Sharing it on the record is me paying attention that sheâs expressing herself.\n\nWhile each song holds personal significance to Mendoza Ramos, part of growing into her identity as an artist has been allowing space for protection and boundaries, and choosing to withhold some of that meaning from the public. Lucha is her own story of the complexity of trauma and nonlinear healing and growth processes, but she imagines it is also the continuation of her ancestorsâ stories and might also be a mirror to the story of others. âEven though Iâm trying to fight, I never want to demonize suffering, because thatâs part of growing. And itâs hard, because weâre living in times where that [stigma] is whatâs happening. So if thisâme talking about my mental health and finding healing in my queernessâis a risk, I hope that I find a community that protects it and protects me, because they know I have their back. I am also trying to be my momâs community.â\n\nKiltro -Â\n\nYears ago, Chilean-American singer/songwriter Chris Bowers Castillo moved to the port city of ValparaÃ­so and became a walking tour guide.\n\nâI would dress up as Wally and give tours to families and kids,â he remembers with a laugh. âIt was great, because I got to know the city incredibly well. Iâd walk for hours, then spend the rest of the day partying and drinking, probably way too much. But I also wrote lots of new songs.â\n\nBack in Denver, Chris looked for a moniker that reflected the evocative and subtly rebellious musical concepts percolating in his head, and settled on kiltro â a word used in Chile for stray dogs or mutts. He then teamed up with bassist Will Parkhill and drummer Michael Devincenzi, later inviting Fez GarcÃ­a to join the band as an additional percussionist on Kiltroâs live gigs.\n\nâI wanted to do a project mixing different styles and aesthetics,â he says. âValparaÃ­so is my favorite city in the world and will always influence my music. There were street dogs everywhere, and Iâm a mutt myself.â\n\nTitled Underbelly, Kiltroâs sophomore album crystallizes those dreams and experiences into a post-rock manifesto of dazzling beauty. Its songs combine touches of shoegaze, ambient and neo-psychedelia with the soulful transcendence of South American folk â the purity of stringed instruments, supple syncopated percussion and elusive melodies that define the works of Latin American legends such as Violeta Parra, VÃ­ctor Jara and Atahualpa Yupanqui.\n\nFrom the propulsive, chant-like groove of âGuanacoâ to the art-pop panache of âAll the Time in the World,â Underbelly is the kind of record that invites you to quiet down and listen, savoring every single detail. The album reaches an emotional pinnacle during its second half, when the majestic lament of âSoftyâ â seeped in exquisite cushions of reverb â segues into the hypnotic reverie of âKerosene.â\n\nIt also signals a new chapter in the fusion of Latin roots with mainstream rock, anchoring its sonic quest on a rare commodity: inspired songwriting.\n\nâSo much of this album is defined by the conditions that made it,â says Chris. âOur debut â 2019âs Creatures of Habit â has a social, almost communal feel to it, because we played it live time after time before recording. In a way, the songs were troubleshooted in the presence of an audience, then honed in the studio. Underbelly, on the other hand, was made in quarantine. It was just us obsessing in the studio, and we ended up following whatever thread seemed most interesting at the time, which made for an album that is more experimental and creative.â\n\nâWeâre trying to make sense of the process as we experience it,â adds Will, who returned to Denver and became part of Kiltro after a few years living abroad. âThe way we make music, weâre definitely not interested in dropping singles. Something that Chris and I have in common is our interest in capturing ambient textures that evoke a sense of place. When we first played music together â years before Kiltro â we got microphones and tried to record the sound of water running down a bathtub. It didnât work out then, but we revisited the same concept on this album.â\n\nQuarantine isolation allowed Kiltro to obsess over every single loop and melodic turn. Now that the band is ready to tour again, presenting the songs in a live setting poses a beautiful challenge.\n\nâWe were mixing the album when the question came up: how the hell are we going to do this live?,â says Chris. âLive shows are a real important component of what we do â in a way, itâs the very reason of why we make music. There will be four of us onstage, and I do a lot of live looping. We have two drummers, which helps a lot when you consider the percussive element of this album. Iâve learned that we donât have to favor a maximalist approach. People connect with melody and the concept. As long as the harmonic elements carry the emotional message across, you can take the songs into many possible directions.â\n\nFor now, the release of Underbelly marks a bold step forward in Kiltroâs extraordinary musical journey.\n\nâWhen we first started the band, I was playing folk songs â focusing on my interior spaces and finding catharsis through melody,â says Chris. âIâve always been attracted to music that is melancholy and personal. Then we added the rhythmic component, and I realized that having a bit of noise and chaos can add emotional depth. Underbelly reflects everything that happens inside your soul when the world stops on its tracks.â\n\nâWe tried a lot of new things on this record,â agrees Will. âWe were living through unprecedented times and coming to terms with all of it. The album is a reflection of that. At the end of the day, we wanted to create the kind of music that we didnât hear anywhere else.â\n\nShow 8pm\n\nGA tickets are standing room only, with very limited seating available first come, first served.\n\nVentura Music Hall Presents:\n\nWILD CHILD & SUSTO\n\nWild Child -\n\nEnd of the World, the new album from acclaimed Austin songwriting duo Wild Child (Kelsey Wilson and Alexander Beggins) wasnât supposed to happen. In 2018, Wilson joined the singer-songwriter super group Glorietta, and debuted her critically acclaimed genre-bending, Motown-influenced solo project Sir Woman. Meanwhile, Beggins unveiled his musical alter-ego, CoCo Zandi, with the release of his first solo album, As Simple as a Dream. Then in 2019, after more than a decade of non-stop touring, the indie band, which was unexpectedly conceived in the back seat of someone else's tour van, stopped booking or playing shows altogether.Â\n\nExploring different sonic directions, Wilson and Beggins didn't know if they would ever make another Wild Child record, until, well, what felt like the \"end of the world\" hit Austin, and brought them back together. Pandemic lockdowns closed stages and drained bank accounts. In Austin, the âLive Music Capital of the World,â local bands took their shows online. Wild Child was no different. With an unexpected abundance of free time on their hands, Wilson and Beggins got together to practice for a series of online performances for devout fans. Within 30 minutes of rejoining forces, theyâd written the first single for what would accidentally become Wild Child's fifth album.Â\n\n\"Photographs\" is a soulful, brass-filled outing that âoffers something familiar for Wild Child fans who have stuck with them over the years,\" Wilson says. ââPhotographsâ was inspired by a picture of my dad, Buddy Wilson, who passed away in February. And in a way, it's a tribute to old Wild Child songs. A bittersweet story, a ukulele and both of us singing. It's a special gift to Wild Child fans.\" Beggins adds, \"It felt like our very first record, when the two of us wrote a bunch of songs while on tour for someone else. There wasn't any aim to do anything with those songs at the beginning. For the first time since then, that's how we started writing these songs. We didn't know if we would make another record. It just came together.âÂ\n\nAnd it couldn't have happened at a more difficult time. Take Day 3 of the 2021 Texas Big Freeze for instance, when 13 displaced Austin pals had taken refuge at Wilson's house. There was no electricity, no indoor plumbing, and no end in sight. When Wilson couldn't possibly take it anymore, one of the fateful 13, singer-songwriter John Calvin Abney, ripped a 90s-alternative riff on an acoustic guitar that would eventually turn into the album's title track. \"I just started singing about things that were freaking me out. Wearing a mask for a year. Global warming. There's no heat, no water,â explains Wilson. âIt was like a dirge to begin with. But by the end we were all screaming and laughing that, yes, this might be the end of the world, but we're all together right now, making music in my living room by candlelight. It's all okay.\"Â\n\nThe next morning during a lull in the storm, the Wild Child caravan â complete with drummer and guitarist Tom Meyers, guitarist Cody Ackors, and bassist and piano player Taylor Craft (Sir Woman) â braved icy roads to recording engineer Matt Pence's The Echo Lab studios outside Denton, Texas. They didn't even stop to shower before recording an unwashed rendition of \"End of the World,\" flush with in-the-moment angst. \"There's no ukulele. I'm singing differently than I ever have before. You can hear my voice crack, and all the energy behind everyone playing,\" Wilson said. \"That set the tone. There were no boundaries. We're back to how it was on Day One. We were making this music because we really needed to make it for ourselves.\"\n\nAbney tagged along, and in the process became the first songwriter to collaborate with Beggins and Wilson on a Wild Child album. His contributions to Beggins and Wilson's songwriting process came as an unexpected blessing amid so much impending doom. \"John was dating one of Kelsey's roommates when we met. The first time we played together, we just fell in love with each other,\" Beggins says. \"When you have a musical partnership, like Kelsey and I have had for a decade, it's strange to change the formula of writing. But we found someone we both trust and like working with.\"Â\n\n\"Wearing Blue\" started with a guitar riff Abney played before an early recording session. \"While everyone was setting up their instruments, John Calvin started playing and singing. In 30 minutes, a song was written. That was a holy-shit moment. And it set the tone of the record,\" Wilson shares.Â\n\nThe Wild Child family is also excited to announce the birth of Rebaâs Ranch Records, a long-time vision of creating their own record label imprint to highlight some of the amazing music coming out of Austin, TX. The label was born after years of conversations within the band about the importance of controlling oneâs own destiny and art. The imprint will be home to the Wild Child catalog, as well as Kelseyâs Sir Woman and Alexander's CoCo Zandi recordings, and is a partnership with Secretly Distribution.Â\n\nâEnd of the Worldâ was mixed by Matt Pence (Jason Isbell, Elle King) and includes guitarist Charlie Wiles (Paul Cauthen, John Moreland, Orville Peck).\n\nSusto -\n\nA season of drastic change is what brought SUSTO frontman Justin Osborne to the bandâs fifth full-length LP, My Entire Life [New West Records]. There was a divorce, difficulties re-building his band after the pandemic, and the pain and helplessness of witnessing family members struggle with addiction and mental illness. Despite these challenges, Justin ultimately found himself in a new landscape, with new love and a deeper perspective, all of which is masterfully projected into My Entire Life.Â\n\nWhile navigating some major life changes, Justin understandably experienced a surge of creative energy. He channeled this into writing and recording with the people closest to him, even as the tides of his personal life continued to shift. Primary collaborators included longtime producer Wolfgang âWolfyâ Zimmerman, SUSTO Co-founders, Johnny Delaware and Marshall Hudson, and his fiancÃ©/co-writer Caroline Foyle.Â\n\nMuch of the album was recorded at The Space, in Charleston, SC, but major sessions also took place at Echo Mountain Recording in Asheville, NC, and Chase Park Transduction in Athens, GA.Â\n\nJohnny had moved to Mexico shortly after work on the album began, so some tracking was done at his home studio in Mexico City.Â\n\nThe band also took a ârecording pilgrimageâ to the Mexican town of TepotzlÃ¡n (mythical birthplace of mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl), where they turned an airbnb into a remote recording studio, with help from members of Mexican Institute of Sound.Â\n\nThe combined result of these efforts is a compelling blend of rock, folk and psychedelia, with vivid country-esque storytelling. Itâs as raw and real as anything the band has done so far and everything youâd hope for from a modern rock ânâ roll record.Â\n\nThe albumâs namesake and lead single, âMy Entire Lifeâ is melodically tearful, with an urgency âto keep living.âÂ\n\nAs a whole, the album documents Justinâs personal journey through highs and lows in his life, with many of the details on full display. He narrates the demise and aftermath of an almost decade long relationship, while celebrating the joy of falling in love and the hopefulness of starting over. There is a playfulness at times, but always a clear desire to distill wisdom from experience.\n\nâSUSTOâs narrative has always been confessional, and songwriting is my way of trying to make sense of the chaosâgood and badâaround me,â observes Justin. âThese songs cover the spectrum of everything thatâs happened in my life the last few years. Thereâs been a lot of change, which can be painful, but thereâs also been a lot of joy and hope, along with everything in between. I figure thatâs what life is.â He continues ââ¦itâs a mosaic of all the good, bad, and mundane things we face as we make our way from birth to death. Along the way we ride the waves, but if you stay true to yourself and push through, I believe you can get to where you really want to be, and you can shape that mosaic into something that fulfills you. There is a lot of hope in that for me. This record is my story of navigating a bunch of chaos, but finding ways to carry on and manifest my own happinessâ¦the last few years were a challenge, but I look back and see that I made it through, a better, truer, and more realized version of myself.âÂ\n\nIt's been quite the ride for SUSTO. In addition to achieving widespread critical acclaim in recent years, the group has built a diehard fan base through captivating live performances and compelling songs.Â\n\nFor as much as My Entire Life is the ultimate vision of what the band can be, itâs also a classic story of one person rising from the ashes, wiser and fiery than everâ¦Â\n\nâWriting and performing has long been central in my life, and this season of change has only heightened my desire to connect with other people through songs. Iâve crossed a mountain, so Iâm ready to charge forward, and share that story. Everybody goes through difficulty one way or another, we all get worn down, we all chase dreams; songs are there to remind us we arenât alone in that. In my case. Iâm thankful for lessons learned, and excited for the future. The privilege of sharing these songs with our audience is something Iâm incredibly grateful for.â\n\nShow 8pm\n\nGA tickets are standing room only, with very limited seating available first come, first served.\n\nVentura Music Hall Presents:\n\nRIPE\n\nwith HEMBREE\n\nRipeâs new album Bright Blues has an anthemic feel. It is a collection of 12 songs full of sleek grooves and bold melodies that the Alternative-Pop quartet put together to help ride out tough times.\n\nThe members of Ripe have never felt more assured about the band or their music. Collectively and personally, Ripe has weathered a mountain of adversity over the past few years, and from those struggles has arisen their best art yet. Bright Blues, Ripeâs sophomore album, is enjoying big excitement at radio, with the new single âSettlingâ hitting top 15 at AAA and top 25 at ALT with over 16K+ radio spins garnering 15+million impressions and being featured as Alt Nationâs critical cut artist.\n\nâThe wildest thing for me is that the record simultaneously sounds like it has the scars of everything weâve been through and also that it doesnât â itâs joyful music, which is very exciting given that it was made in the middle of getting hit in the stomach,â says singer Robbie Wulfsohn, who came together with guitarist Jon Becker, drummer Sampson Hellerman, and trombonist Calvin Barthel while they were all studying at Berklee College of Music.\n\nRipe is taking Bright Blues on the road, with a nationwide headline tour that begins shortly after the albumâs March 10th, 2023 release date. The tour will hit prestigious venues such as MGM Music Hall at Fenway in Boston, Terminal 5 in New York City and The Fillmore in San Francisco.\n\nEven before the pandemic, Ripe was on the cusp of something new. The band began drawing acclaim from the likes of the Boston Globe, Huffington Post and WXPN with a dance-ready vibe on EPs Produce The Juice and Hey Hello. Ripe built on that sound and folded in a touch of R&B on their first full-length, Joy in the Wild Unknown. Their streams on Spotify surged past 65 million, they conquered stages at festivals including Bonnaroo, Firefly, SweetWater and Bottlerock, and they sold thousands of tickets across the US, including sell outs at iconic venues like House of Blues Boston and Brooklyn Steel. Ripe was still ready to try a different approach for Bright Blues. The album would already be different in that it would be their first release after signing to indie powerhouse Glassnote Records. They started the creative process by calling in outside producer Paul Butler (St. Paul & the Broken Bones, Michael Kiwanuka) and for the first time, bringing in co-writers, recording four songs that Ripe released as singles throughout 2020.\n\nâWe thought, how can we do something new?â Hellerman says. âSomething that still has our sound and vibe at its core, how can we expand our boundaries and reach more audiences while still staying true to what makes Ripe Ripe?â The answer was teaming up with Noah Conrad (BTS, Niall Horan) and Ryan Linvill (Olivia Rodrigo, Dermot Kennedy), classmates from Berklee who are up-and-comers in the world of pop songwriting and production. Together, the band and its collaborators dialed in a buoyant sound on the hooky album opener âGet Over,â where synths help flesh out a throwback pop sound. Ripe works a hot soul vein on âAll or Nothing,â where horns punctuate a snappy rhythm that powers smooth, fully self-assured vocals. Woozy synths on âPaper Cupsâ help create a dream-like vibe accentuated with a subtle, hypnotic melody.\n\nBringing new people into the fold, even though theyâre old friends, was an exercise in trust that proved well worth it. âWe used to just all get in a room and kind of hash it out,â Becker says. With Bright Blues, âIt was only one or two of us at a time with Noah and Ryan, so our individual voices got to shine more.â\n\nThe new approach also helped Ripe think of the bandâs high-energy, freewheeling stage show separately from the recording studio, which they used more as an instrument in the making of Bright Blues. Wulfsohn chimes in, âThere are moments of improvisation on the record that feel like somebody was just going for it and hitting something really exciting. Iâm biased, but I think you hear every distinct voice across the record, and I think the circumstances of the record absolutely leaked into the musical choices.â\n\nThe result is an album that shows the full scope of the bandâs abilities as writers and performers. The live show has always been at the core of who Ripe is, and now the recorded music can stand alongside it as an all-encompassing representation of whothe band is and where they are going.\n\nBright Blues also showed the members of Ripe that they can still surprise each other. âEach of us had moments while making this album that really resonated with us, if not broke us open emotionally,â Barthel says. âHaving that experience coming from people who you know better than anybody else and trust so much is pretty mind blowing. It definitely left us all with a new level of inspiration and drive and belief in what we could all do.â\n\nShow 7:30pm\n\nGA tickets are standing room only, with very limited seating available first come, first served.Â\n\nVentura Music Hall Presents:\n\nTHE RECORD COMPANY\n\nwith NAT MYERS\n\nWhen The Record Company pick up their instruments, the membersâChris Vos [guitar, lead vocals, harmonica], Alex Stiff [bass, backing vocals], and Marc Cazorla [drums, backing vocals]âparticipate in a musical back-and-forth akin to a formative and supportive conversation among siblings. The nuances of their personalities seep through loose, bluesy guitar leads, airtight drum grooves, thick bass, and vividly evocative lyrics. With such fluidity, the musicians respond to one another so instinctually youâd swear they were telepathically linked. However, thereâs no such superpower necessary when youâve got the closest thing to a brotherhood that three musicians unrelated by blood can shareâ¦Â\n\nThe GRAMMYÂ® Award-nominated trio only amplify the power of this bond on their fourth full-length offering and 2023 debut for Round Hill Records.\n\nâWe know each otherâs personalities on the instruments, so we reconnected with one another and really found that brotherhood again,â explains Chris. âIt's always been there, but we got back into a room where it was like a circle of stone. Weâre creating something that will go out into the world. We all stand behind it equally, and weâre willing to put our lives and love into it. When you put your career, your future, and your art into another personâs hands and you know theyâre doing the same for you, thereâs a different level of trust. Thatâs been our secret since day one. When itâs challenging, weâre all trying to figure out the challenge. When itâs good, weâre all experiencing it together.â\n\nTheyâve experienced everything as a family since forming back in 2011. Along the way, they served up a tested-and-proven epic in the form of their 2016 debut, Give It Back To You. The release earned a GRAMMYÂ® Award nomination in the category of âBest Contemporary Blues Albumâ and spawned âOff The Ground,â which reached #1 at AAA Radio and tallied nearly 40 million total streams and counting. Beyond a string of stunning late-night television appearances, they performed on CBS This Morning, at Bonnaroo, and on an extensive tour with John Mayer in addition to headlining coast-to-coast. They maintained this momentum with All Of This Life [2018] and Play Loud [2021]. On top of praise from American Songwriter, Classic Rock, and more, NPR hailed the latter as âthe bandâs biggest and most dynamic record to date.â\n\nIn 2021, the guys hunkered down and commenced creating what would become their fourth LP. Working out of an intimate home studio in Beachwood Canyon, they wrote, recorded, and self-produced the music. Outside of cutting drums at the legendary Sunset Sound, it proved to be a homegrown affair through and through.Â\n\nâWe got back to our old perspective, which is to trust the idea, get out of the way, make something, listen, and respond to it,â affirms Chris.Â\n\nAlex elaborates, âWe decided to record the organic thing that got us really excited to play music as a band in the first place. That was the general theme of this record. Keep it as close to a three-piece sound as possible. Keep the music raw. Itâs a return to form in a way, but weâre still growing.â\n\nâWeâve been doing this for a while,â adds Marc. âAs long as we sound like us, we can be proud of it. Itâs not going to be for everybody, but weâve never been prouder of what weâre doing.â\n\nThe Record Company kicks off their next era with the single âDance On Mondays.â Guitar cries through a hypnotically hummable bassline and head-nodding beat. Meanwhile, a chantable hook instantly takes hold with grit and gusto as Chris affirms, âI donât dance on Mondays.â\n\nâSomebody asked me to go see a band on a Monday night, and I just said, âI donât dance on Mondaysâ,â Alex recalls. âI wrote it down in my phone. The phrase signifies, âIâm taking my life back, and Iâm not going to dance for anybodyâ. It goes back to where we are as a band and us being The Record Company.â\n\nThen, thereâs âTalk To Me.â Bass practically dances atop a simmering groove punctuated by tambourine before guitar kicks back in as Chris urges, âSo, why donât you talk to me?â Marc goes on, âIt reminds me of one of those rare Blue Note groove records with a chill vibe.â\n\nLaunching into toe-tapping bounce, harmonica wails on âDarkest Daysâ as the stomp and 12-string guitar underline a soulful vocal. âHighway Ladyâ shines with a Laurel Canyon meditationÂ in the glow of swooning slide guitar.\n\nâWe wanted to make music you could listen to âHighway Ladyâ on a road trip in the car with the cityâs lights behind you,â Alex says. âThis songÂ had this big vibe of feeling good both musically and spiritually.â\n\nâLyrically, itâs my favorite,â adds Marc. âIt could be about so many different things. I moved into this house with a little pool, which Iâd always wanted in Southern California. When itâs hot as shit out, you naturally develop all of these new friends during the summer. You make a pool playlist, and I wanted one of our tunes to be a contender. To me, this is one.â\n\nIn the end, The Record CompanyÂ are stronger than ever as a band and, more importantly, as brothers.\n\nâIâd love for people to hear this record and feel like theyâre in the house with us making it,â Alex leaves off. âI want them to feel like theyâre part of this unpolished and homemade thing, because thatâs what we were trying to get back to.â\n\nâWeâre a trio, and thatâs the completion of this circle,â Marc concludes. âThe fourth member of this group is the space between us. We embrace that space as part of the raw element. Thatâs what we explored on this album, and itâs beautiful. We canât wait to bring it on the road.â\n\nShow 8pm\n\nGA tickets are standing room only, with very limited seating available first come, first served.\n\nVentura Music Hall Presents:\n\nMAD CADDIES & AUTHORITY ZEROÂ\n\nwith Special Guest BELVEDERE\n\nMad CaddiesÂ -Â\n\nThe Mad Caddies are a ska punk band from Solvang, California, United States. The band formed in 1995 and has released seven full-length albums, one live album, and two EPs. To date, Mad Caddies have sold over 500,000 albums worldwide.\n\nThe Mad Caddies sound has influences from broad ranging genres including ska (especially ska 3rd wave), punk rock, hardcore punk, reggae, dixieland jazz, Latin music, polka, even cowpunk (\"Crew Cut Chuck\") and sea shanties (\"Weird Beard\").\n\nThe Mad Caddies have released 6 studio albums, 2 EPs and a live album. They've also toured extensively throughout their career including tours across the USA, Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and South America. Their most recent full-length release, Punk Rocksteady, was released on June 15th 2018 and was produced by Fat Mike. In 2020 the Caddies released a 5 song EP titled \"House on Fire\" on Fat Wreck Chords.\n\nAuthority ZeroÂ -Â\n\nâAuthority Zero has never been called ânegative.â Even during a pandemic, they kept their collective chin up, put their heads down and wrote what could be called their career album. Released in June 2021, Authority Zeroâs album âOllie Ollie Oxen Freeâ takes a line from hide and seek to encourage fans to leave the COVID-19 depression behind and celebrate life.\n\nDuring the pandemic, singer Jason DeVore saw families torn apart by political views and COVID-19. Now that the divide has somewhat subsided, itâs time to come out and be yourself again. âThe phrasing in the title track stems from the idea of âcome out, come out, wherever you are,ââ says DeVore, who co-writes with bassist Michael Spero. âIt encourages a focus on the positive side of 2020, while still maintaining awareness of the hardships and detriment of it all. People have been trapped within themselves, depressed inside of their houses and otherwise. Weâve been separated both politically and mentally between the left and right, which is very apparent. Itâs a focus of come out, feel free and feel a sense of confidence to live with an unheavy heart and mind again.â\n\nThe title track rattles those cages with DeVoreâs encouraging lyrics, the frenetic blur of Christopher Dalleyâs urgent drumming and Speroâs bass, coupled with guitar licks true to the playing style of returning guitarist Brandon Landelius. With its updated sound, âOllie Ollie Oxen Freeâ fits in with Authority Zeroâs catalog, DeVore says. âItâs more of the times of 2020,â he says. âWe really tried to focus more on the positive side of things that came from the pandemic, rather than the negative that came out of it. âWe inflect lyrics and music in an uplifting manner. We wanted to shine a light at the end of the tunnel.â\n\nBelvedereÂ -Â\n\nFrom the bandâs inception in 1995, Belvedere has continued to push themselves on the road and in the studio. Well over 1000 shows were played in over 25 countries thanks to the help of countless promoters, fans, and friends. Though the band split in 2005, it was clear that these friends would not forget them. In 2011, bridges were mended and reunion shows were announced. Over the next three years Steve, Jason, Scott, and Graham did everything they could to play in as many countries as real life allowed. By the end of 2014, the band decided that it was time to try writing again.\n\nThere were two rules when Belvedere decided to write and record their first album in over 12 years. Have a good time, and donât sound like a bunch of old men..â¦mission accomplished. âThe Revenge Of The Fifthâ picks up where their last release âFast Forward Eats The Tapeâ left off. Twelve tracks of melodic punk â fast and furious. Though fans of the band will feel a sense of nostalgia for the speed and riffage, theyâll also notice a progression in the song writing. Perhaps even a âjuxtapositionâ of maturity from 4 immature punkers. The balancing act between raising families and holding steady jobs, and touring the world for 20 years can be heard in many of the lyrics. âGeneration Debtâ is an apology letter to our children for the world weâve left to them, while âCarpe per diemâ is a summary of basement show tours that spanned the bandâs first six years. An expression of hope is found in âRevenge of the fifthâ which hinges on the idea that weâre all ultimately responsible for taking care of the human race and the planet; and to stop looking to a higher power for forgiveness or answers.\n\nThe addition of Casey Lewis on drums has given the band a new excitement and passion. Fans will be happy to hear the band hasnât slowed down or toned down the shredding. 2016 looks to be a great year as Belvedere will be hitting South America, Europe, Canada and a few other places. Watch out for May 5th, 2016 when Belvedereâs fifth album, âThe Revenge Of The Fifthâ hits the real and digital world.\n\nShow 8pm\n\nGA tickets are standing room only, with very limited seating available first come, first served.Â\n\nVentura Music Hall Presents:\n\nBIG HEAD TODD AND THE MONSTERS 40th ANNIVERSARY TOUR\n\nIn this life, very few friendships withstand the test of time. Naturally, people go their separate ways and chase their own dreams. As rare as it may be for friendships to last a lifetime, it might be even rarer for a band to stick together for the long haul. For close to four decades, the members of Big Head Todd and The MonstersâTodd Park Mohr [vocals, guitar, keys, sax, harmonica], Brian Nevin [drums], Rob Squires [bass, vocals], and Jeremy Lawton [keyboards, lap pedal/steel guitar, vocals]âhave continued to both throw down in the studio and light up stages worldwide. Rallying around a core vision, the platinum-selling Colorado quartet kick out the kind of blues-drenched rock ânâ roll bangers that make you want to rev the engine a little louder, sing along like no oneâs looking, and live a little freer.Â\n\nThis holds true on their 12th full-length offering, Her Way Out.\n\nâTo me, my band means four people who listen to each other, work hard, and share a goal,â Todd observes. âThe goal has to do with reaching out to people, catching their ears, and sharing a story we hope they relate to. Our fans have given us an incredible 40-year career, and we hope theyâve gotten great songs and performances in return.â\n\nTheyâve most definitely delivered on both frontsâ¦Â\n\nAs the story goes, Todd, Brian, and Rob unlocked their musical partnership during high school when they started jamming in the early eighties. Fast forward to 1986, they adopted the moniker Big Head Todd and The Monsters. BHTM released 2 successful independent records on their own BIG Records, Another Mayberry (1989) and Midnight Radio (1990) before drawing the attention of music industry titans and signing with Irving Azoff, Chuck Morris, and Frank Barsalona in 1992. They broke nationallyÂ with the platinum-certified staple Sister Sweetly (1993) which yielded four top 10 rock radio hits. They continued to progress with Strategem [1994] and Beautiful World [1997] which yielded several more rock radio hits including Boom Boom featuring John Lee Hooker. The band is continually touring and recording and has continued to put out albums that have received critical acclaim from both fans and press.\n\nAmong other milestones, their music literally reached the heavens when they played âBlue Skyâ live at NASA Mission Control, delivering a celestial wakeup for astronauts aboard the International Space Station. Theyâve toured and recorded with many rock and blues legends including B.B. King, Neil Young, The Allman Brothers, Hubert Sumlin, David âHoneyboyâ Edwards, Dave Matthews Band, The Eagles and their personal favorite Robert Plant. Not to mention, they attained hometown hero status by headlining Red Rocks Amphitheatre 35 times in addition to earning induction into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame in 2023.Â\n\nHer Way Out came to life organically. For two years, they hosted âMonsterâs Music Monthly,â serving up either a new song or a new version of a classic online.Â Working out of Jeremyâs home studio, they parlayed this momentum into their latest LP.\n\nâIt had been almost seven years since our last album release, but we wanted to put the same energy of âMonsterâs Music Monthlyâ into a full-length,â Todd notes. âWe have a very distinct personality as a band. I write to the sensibilities of each member, because theyâre going to have to dig playing it. Weâre a benevolent democracy. If one guy isnât connecting with a certain song, that song is out. As an uncomplicated rock band, we like to do things that are âproperââloud guitars, drums, big bass, and well-placed organ, keys, and lap steel. We road-tested every song on the record before recording a lick. All of that helped us dial in the arrangements, ditch tunes that didnât work, and grow a strong sense of what our individual parts should be.â\n\nIn this respect, the single and title track âHer Way Outâ packs a concentrated and catchy punch. Anchored by a steady beat, the rough and tumble riff kicks up dust as soulful vocals ignite an irresistible refrain, âShe found her way out, her way outâand it was me.â\n\nâItâs driven by the idea that relationships are frail,â he elaborates. âSometimes, they are something one wants freedom from. A real-life circumstance drives this story. Something was said when a person had too much to drink. The relationship ended with words, but the drinker could never know what he said and the woman refused to tell him.â\n\nAss-kicking guitar surges through âThunderbirdâ as strains of organ coat a raucous refrain with a lyrical tip-of-the-hat to the Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas classic American Graffiti.\n\nHe goes on, ââThunderbirdâ is a collection of one-liners from the film knit together with a beat poet vibe. It has an AC/DC-like guitar riff and a cinematic-style vocal. Itâs all about drag racing and love never caught.â\n\nElsewhere, Big Head Todd and The Monsters nod to Annie Oakley with âDonât Kill Me Tonight.â Then, thereâs âKing Kong.â A hulking groove lumbers beneath the frontmanâs bluesy intonation as a piano solo bleeds into a skyscraper-scaling guitar lead.\n\nâItâs inspired by a large movie poster in my basement of King Kong on top of the Empire State Building,â Todd reveals. âIâm drawn to these iconic contemporary heroes who are also monsters. They are complicated because they destroy so much, yet are sympathetic to children and fall in love with human women. These âTitansâ, as they are called, are often monsters of our own making. Itâs exciting to perform live.â\n\nIn the end, the future looks as bright as ever for these longtime friends.\n\nâWe work very hard at being a great band,â Todd leaves off. âWeâre also a group that cares for each other. Weâve been together for almost 40 years. Our audience has made it all possible, and weâre grateful and determined to keep playing.â"
