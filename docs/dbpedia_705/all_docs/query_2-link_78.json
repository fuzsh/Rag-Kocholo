        "text": "Field watches are, for good reason, among the most popular styles of watches, especially for outdoor enthusiasts. They trace their roots back to military necessity. That mother of invention led to a style of watches that can be both understated and luxurious, refined and utilitarian.\n\nI love field watches. Among my collection, field watches are the timepieces that often accompany my most treasured adventures. They’re affordable, functional, and can stand up to the abuse that wilderness, mountains, and weather can throw at a tool that remains strapped to my wrist.\n\nIn this roundup, I focus on field watches that can handle real-world abuse. The majority of my selections are well below $1,000 because the reality is that those who actually use their field watch in the field really don’t have space to worry about a needlessly expensive object. Field watches are meant to be used, scratched, with dirt, water, blood, and all. I’ll also include a few more expensive offerings for the horological enthusiasts because there’s certainly space for beautiful, refined watches at the table.\n\nSo check out my selections here. Our team has used and enjoyed them. They’ve survived rough use, from climbing to travel to hunting. Every watch on this list is meant to take a beating, and some will look very good doing it. After perusing the selection, have a look at our spec comparison chart and read the buyer’s guide for more info.\n\nThe Best Field Watches of 2024\n\nBest Entry-Level Field Watch: Timex Expedition Scout 40mm\n\nMost Durable Field Watch: Bertucci Mens A-2T Super Classic\n\nBest Tactical Field Watch: Vaer C5 Tactical\n\nA Versatile Solar Field Watch: Citizen Garrison\n\nMost Iconic Automatic Field Watch: Hamilton Khaki Field Expedition Auto\n\nA Classy Yet Capable Auto Field Watch: Seiko Alpinist SPB121\n\nBest Large-Face Field Watch: Luminox Atacama Field Watch\n\nA Nearly Perfect Dress Field Watch: Zodiac Olympos\n\nA Luxurious, Functional Field Watch: NORQAIN Neverest Glacier 40mm\n\nBest Premium Field Watch: Rolex Explorer\n\nField Watch Comparison Chart\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us\n\nThere are a lot of watch experts, and there are a lot of outdoor writers, but there aren’t a lot of outdoor experts who also know much about wristwatches. I happen to fit both these categories. So when it comes to watches meant to be used and abused in the wilderness, I am one watch aficionado who also puts the watches through some real-world use.\n\nI love field watches and use them for their real intended purposes. I wear them hunting, fishing, hiking, mountaineering, skiing, and more. My watches have been worn inside wild game animals during meat processing. They’ve been dunked in freezing rivers while I place duck decoys. And they’ve been whacked against granite while I scramble up scree fields on Colorado’s 14ers.\n\nBut I also care about the horology and details involved in wristwatches. I appreciate the beauty and precision of a fine watch, and consider factors such as fit, finish, and complications when looking at field watches.\n\nFinally, I’ve been doing this a long time. As the former editor-in-chief of GearJunkie and one of its first employees, I’ve written about outdoor gear for more than a decade. My goal is to give you the best advice I can and help you make smart decisions with your hard-earned money. I hope this article helps you choose the best field watch for your needs.\n\nThe History of Field Watches\n\nField watches have a rich history rooted in military use. The origins of field watches can be traced back to World War I when soldiers needed reliable timepieces for coordinating maneuvers on the battlefield. Here are key points in the history of field watches:\n\nDuring the First World War, pocket watches were the norm. But these watches, buried inside clothing, were impractical for soldiers. Thus, wristwatches became more popular for their convenience. This transition marked a significant development in the history of timekeeping.\n\nDuring World War II (1939-1945), field watches boomed in popularity thanks to their design to be rugged, legible, and practical for soldiers in the field. Brands like Hamilton, Waltham, and Elgin emerged as leaders in the space with features such as luminous dials for low-light visibility, durable cases, and reliable movements.\n\nAt this time, military organizations began to standardize the specifications for field watches to ensure consistency and reliability. These standards included size, dial design, water resistance, and shock resistance.\n\nAfter World War II, soldiers brought the habit of wearing a wristwatch home. Civilians picked up the practical useful tool and applied it to the largely agrarian society of the time. The simple, easy-to-read dials and robust construction made field watches a logical choice for anyone who worked outdoors or with their hands.\n\nToday, field watches continue to be among the most popular styles of wristwatches. Many brands offer modern interpretations, with updated elements like solar charging, quartz movements, and backlit faces. But they all harken back to watchmaking history that goes back nearly a century rooted in the practical needs of soldiers in combat.\n\nFAQ\n\nLooking for more in the world of outdoor style?
