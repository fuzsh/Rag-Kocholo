        "text": "Zone Boundaries Represent a Compromise\n\nGiven the range of hunter preferences, not all hunters will be completely satisfied with season dates and zone boundaries. Our aim is to accommodate at least a portion of most hunters’ desires.\n\nWhether or not changes are recommended for a given five-year period will depend primarily upon hunter input. If most hunters from a particular region prefer a different season structure (zones and splits) or season dates, a change will likely be recommended. Otherwise, we will not recommend change just for the sake of change. Regardless, we appreciate hunters' time and effort, which help us develop the best possible recommendations for Missouri duck hunters.\n\n2021-2025 Zone Boundaries\n\nNorth Zone: That portion of Missouri north of a line running west from the Illinois border at I-70; west on I-70 to U.S. Hwy 65; north on U.S. Hwy 65 to MO Hwy 41, north on MO Hwy 41 to U.S. Hwy 24; west on U.S. Hwy 24 to MO Hwy 10, west on MO Hwy 10 to U.S. Hwy 69, north on U.S. Hwy 69 to MO Hwy 116, west on MO Hwy 116 to U.S. Hwy 59, south on U.S. Hwy 59 to the Kansas border.\n\nMiddle Zone: The remainder of Missouri not included in other zones.\n\nSouth Zone: That portion of Missouri south of a line running west from the Illinois border on MO Hwy 74 to MO Hwy 25; south on MO Hwy 25 to U.S. Hwy 62; west on U.S. Hwy 62 to MO Hwy 53; north on MO Hwy 53 to MO Hwy 51; north on MO Hwy 51 to U.S. Hwy 60; west on U.S. Hwy 60 to MO Hwy 21; north on MO Hwy 21 to MO Hwy 72; west on MO Hwy 72 to MO Hwy 32; west on MO Hwy 32 to U.S. Hwy 65; north on U.S. Hwy 65 to U.S. Hwy 54; west on U.S. Hwy 54 to the Kansas border.\n\nHunters help establish seasons and zones every five years\n\nThe Missouri Department of Conservation hosted 13 public workshops to gather hunter input about duck season dates and zone boundary locations. Participants had the opportunity to review long-term data about weather, migration, habitat use, harvest, and hunter opinions, and to discuss their season date and zone preferences with other hunters and Conservation staff. Hunter input gathered through theses workshops, combined with input received through surveys, was used to establish Missouri’s duck season dates and zones for the 2021-2025 duck seasons.\n\nZone Liberal (60 Days) Moderate (45 Days) /Restrictive (30 Days) North\n\nOpens on the Saturday nearest October 31\n\nNo formula - season dates established after USFWS announces moderate or restrictive packages. Middle\n\nOpens on the first Saturday in November for nine days\n\nCloses for five days\n\nOpens again for 51 days\n\nSouth\n\nOpens on Thanksgiving Day for four days\n\nCloses\n\nOpens December 7 through January 31 (as late as the federal framework allows)\n\nEach year’s regulation recommendation is based on the status of the mallard breeding population and the condition of prairie ponds in Canada. A three-tiered package of open seasons includes liberal (60 days), moderate (45 days), and restrictive (30 days) options. For more information, see the USFWS Adaptive Harvest Management."
