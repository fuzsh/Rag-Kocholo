BookÂ III

Â p3Â

1 1Â In my first Book, the third, that is, from this counting backwards, IÂ explained that IÂ fixed as the starting-points of my work, the Social war, the Hannibalic war, and the war for Coele-Syria. 2Â IÂ likewise set forth in the same place the reasons why IÂ wrote the two preceding Books dealing with events of an earlier date. 3Â IÂ will now attempt to give a well attested account of the above wars, their first causes and the reasons why they attained such magnitude; but in the first place IÂ have aÂ few words to say regarding my work as a whole.

4Â The subject IÂ have undertaken to treat, the how, when, and wherefore of the subjection of the known parts of the world to the dominion of Rome, should be viewed as a single whole, 5Â with a recognized beginning, a fixed duration, and an end which is not a matter of dispute; and IÂ think it will be advantageous to give a brief prefatory survey of the chief parts of this whole from the beginning to the end. Â p5Â 6Â For IÂ believe this will be the best means of giving students an adequate idea of my whole plan. 7Â Since a previous general view is of great assistance to the mind in acquiring a knowledge of details, and at the same time a previous notion of the details helps us to knowledge of the whole, IÂ regard a preliminary survey based on both as best and will draw up these prefatory remarks to my history on this principle. 8Â IÂ have already indicated the general scope and limits of this history. 9Â The particular events comprised in it begin with the above-mentioned wars and culminate and end in the destruction of the Macedonian monarchy. Between the beginning and end lies a space of fifty-three years, 10Â comprising a greater number of grave and momentous events than any period of equal length in the past. 11Â Starting from the 140th Olympiad IÂ shall adopt the following order in my exposition of them.

2 1Â First IÂ shall indicate the causes of the above war between Rome and Carthage, known as the Hannibalic war, and tell how the Carthaginians invaded Italy, 2Â broke up the dominion of Rome, and cast the Romans into great fear for their safety and even for their native soil, while great was their own hope, such as they had never dared to entertain, of capturing Rome itself. 3Â Next IÂ shall attempt to describe how at the same period Philip of Macedon, after finishing his war with the Aetolians and settling the affairs of Greece, conceived the project of an Â p7Â alliance with Carthage; 4Â how Antiochus and Ptolemy Philopator first quarrelled and at length went to war with each other for the possession of Coele-Syria, 5Â and how the Rhodians and Prusias, declaring war on the Byzantines, compelled them to stop levying toll on ships bound for the Euxine. 6Â Interrupting my narrative at this point, IÂ shall draw up my account of the Roman Constitution, as a sequel to which IÂ shall point out how the peculiar qualities of the Constitution conduced very largely not only to their subjection of the Italians and Sicilians, and subsequently of the Spaniards and Celts, but finally to their victory over Carthage and their conceiving the project of universal empire. 7Â Simultaneously in a digression IÂ shall narrate how the dominion of Hiero of Syracuse fell 8Â and after this IÂ shall deal with the troubles in Egypt, and tell how, on the death of Ptolemy, Antiochus and Philip, conspiring to partition the dominions of his son, a helpless infant, began to be guilty of acts of unjust aggression, Philip laying hands on the islands of the Aegean, and on Caria and Samos, while Antiochus seized on Coele-Syria and Phoenicia.

3 1Â Next, after summing up the doings of the RomansÂº and Carthaginians in Spain, Africa, and Sicily IÂ shall shift the scene of my story definitely, as the scene of action shifted, to Greece and its neighbourhood. 2Â IÂ shall describe the sea-battles in which Attalus and the Rhodians met Philip, and after this deal with the war between the Romans and Philip, its course, its reason, and its result. 3Â Following on this IÂ shall Â p9Â make mention of the angry spirit of the Aetolians yielding to which they invited Antiochus over, and thus set ablaze the war from Asia against the Achaeans and Romans. 4Â After narrating the causes of this war, and how Antiochus crossed to Europe, IÂ shall describe in the first place how he fled from Greece; secondly how on his defeat after this he abandoned all Asia up to the Taurus; 5Â and thirdly, how the Romans, suppressing the insolence of the Galatian Gauls, established their undisputed supremacy in Asia and freed its inhabitants on this side of the Taurus from the fear of barbarians and the lawless violence of these Gauls. 6Â Next IÂ shall bring before the reader's eyes the misfortune that befel the Aetolians and Cephallenians, and then make mention of the war of Eumenes with Prusias and the Gauls and of that between Ariarathes and Pharnaces. 7Â Subsequently, after some notice of the unification and pacification of the Peloponnese and of the growth of the Rhodian State, IÂ shall bring the whole narrative of events to a conclusion, 8Â narrating finally the expedition of Antiochus Epiphanes against Egypt, the war with Perseus, and the abolition of the Macedonian monarchy. 9Â All the above events will enable us to perceive how the Romans dealt with each contingency and thus subjected the whole world to their rule.

4 1Â Now if from their success or failure alone we could form an adequate judgement of how far states and individuals are worthy of praise or blame, IÂ could here lay down my pen, bringing my narrative and this whole work to a close with the last-mentioned Â p11Â events, as was my original intention. 2Â For the period of fifty-three years finished here, and the growth and advance of Roman power was now complete. 3Â Besides which it was now universally accepted as a necessary fact that henceforth all must submit to the Romans and obey their orders. 4Â But since judgements regarding either the conquerors or the conquered based purely on performance are by no means final â 5Â what is thought to be the greatest success having brought the greatest calamities on many, if they do not make proper use of it, and the most dreadful catastrophes often turning out to the advantage of those who support them bravely â 6Â IÂ must append to the history of the above period an account of the subsequent policy of the conquerors and their method of universal rule, as well as of the various opinions and appreciations of their rulers entertained by the subjects, and finally IÂ must describe what were the prevailing and dominant tendencies and ambitions of the various peoples in their private and public life. 7Â For it is evident that contemporaries will thus be able to see clearly whether the Roman rule is acceptable or the reverse, and future generations whether their government should be considered to have been worthy of praise and admiration or rather of blame. 8Â And indeed it is just in this that the chief usefulness of this work for the present and the future will lie. 9Â For neither rulers themselves nor their critics should regard the end of action as being merely conquest Â p13Â and the subjection of all to their rule; 10Â since no man of sound sense goes to war with his neighbours simply for the sake of crushing an adversary, just as no one sails on the open sea just for the sake of crossing it. Indeed no one even takes up the study of arts and crafts merely for the sake of knowledge, 11Â but all men do all they do for the resulting pleasure, good, or utility. 12Â So the final end achieved by this work will be, to gain knowledge of what was the condition of each people after all had been crushed and had come under the dominion of Rome, until the disturbed and troubled time that afterwards ensued. 13Â About this latter, owing to the importance of the actions and the unexpected character of the events, and chiefly because IÂ not only witnessed most but took part and even directed some, IÂ was induced to write as if starting on a fresh work. 5 1Â This period of disturbance comprises, firstly the war waged by Rome against the Celtiberians and Vaccaei, that between Carthage and Massinissa the King of the Libyans 2Â and that between Attalus and Prusias in Asia. Next, Ariarathes, King of Cappadocia was expelled from his kingdom by Orophernes through the agency of King Demetrius and recovered his ancestral throne by the help of Attalus. 3Â Then Demetrius, son of Seleucus, after reigning in Syria for twelve years lost both his kingdom and his life, the other kings combining against him. 4Â Next the Romans restored to their homes the Greeks who had been accused in consequence of the war with Perseus, acquitting them of the charges brought against them. Â p15Â 5Â AÂ little later the Romans attacked Carthage, having resolved in the first place on changing its site and subsequently on its utter destruction for the reasons that IÂ shall state in due course. 6Â Close upon this followed the withdrawal of the Macedonians from their alliance with Rome and that of the Lacedaemonians from the Achaean League, and hereupon the beginning and the end of the general calamity that overtook Greece.

7Â Such is the plan IÂ propose, but all depends on Fortune's granting me a life long enough to execute it. 8Â However IÂ am convinced that in the event of my death, the project will not fall to the ground for want of men competent to carry it on, since there are many others who will set their hands to the task and labour to complete it.

9Â Now having given a summary of the most important events, with the object of conveying to my readers a notion of this work as a whole and its contents in detail, it is time for me to call to mind my original plan and return to the starting-point of my history.

6 1Â Some of those authors who have dealt with Hannibal and his times, wishing to indicate the causes that led to the above war between Rome and Carthage, allege as its first cause the siege of Saguntum by the Carthaginians 2Â and as its second their crossing, contrary to treaty, the river whose native name is the Iber. 3Â IÂ should agree in stating that these were the beginnings of the war, but IÂ can by no means allow that they were its causes, 4Â unless we call Alexander's crossing to Asia the cause Â p17Â of his war against Persia and Antiochus' landing at Demetrias the cause of his war against Rome, neither of which assertions is either reasonable or true. 5Â For who could consider these to be causes of wars, plans and preparations for which, in the case of the Persian war, had been made earlier, many by Alexander and even some by Philip during his life, and in the case of the war against Rome by the Aetolians long before Antiochus arrived? 6Â These are pronouncements of men who are unable to see the great and essential distinction between a beginning and a cause or purpose, these being the first origin of all, and the beginning coming last. 7Â By the beginning of something IÂ mean the first attempt to execute and put in action plans on which we have decided, by its causes what is most initiatory in our judgements and opinions, that is to say our notions of things, our state of mind, our reasoning about these, and everything through which we reach decisions and projects. 8Â The nature of these is evident from the instances adduced above; 9Â it is easy for anyone to see the real causes and origin of the war against Persia. 10Â The first was the retreat of the Greeks under Xenophon from the upper Satrapies, in which, though they traversed the whole of Asia, a hostile country, none of the barbarians ventured to face them. 11Â The second was the crossing of Agesilaus, King of Sparta, to Asia, where he found no opposition of any moment to his projects, and was only compelled to return without effecting anything owing to the disturbances in Greece. 12Â From both of these facts Philip perceived and reckoned on the Â p19Â cowardice and indolence of the Persians as compared with the military efficiency of himself and his Macedonians, and further fixing his eyes on the splendour of the great prize which the war promised, 13Â he lost no time, once he had secured the avowed good-will of the Greeks, but seizing on the pretext that it was his urgent duty to take vengeance on the Persians for their injurious treatment of the Greeks, he bestirred himself and decided to go to war, beginning to make every preparation for this purpose. 14Â We must therefore look on the first considerations IÂ have mentioned as the causes of the war against Persia, the second as its pretext and Alexander's crossing to Asia as its beginning. 7 1Â Similarly it is evident that the cause of the war between Antiochus and the Romans was the anger of the Aetolians, 2Â who (as IÂ above stated) looking upon themselves as having been slighted in many ways by the Romans as regards their share in bringing the war with Philip to an end, not only invited Antiochus over, but were ready to do and suffer anything owing to the anger they conceived under the above circumstances. 3Â But the liberation of Greece, which they announced in defiance of reason and truth going round with Antiochus from city to city, we must consider to be a pretext of this war, and its beginning the landing of Antiochus at Demetrias.

4Â In speaking at such length on this matter, my object has not been to censure previous writers, but to rectify the ideas of students. 5Â For of what use to the sick is a physician who is ignorant of the causes of certain conditions of the body? And of what use is a statesman who cannot reckon how, why, and whence each event has originated? 6Â The Â p21Â former will scarcely be likely to recommend proper treatment for the body and it will be impossible for the latter without such knowledge to deal properly with circumstances. 7Â Nothing, therefore, should be more carefully guarded against and more diligently sought out than the first causes of each event, since matters of the greatest moment often originate from trifles, and it is the initial impulses and conceptions in every matter which are most easily remedied.

8 1Â Fabius, the Roman annalist, says that besides the outrage on the Saguntines, a cause of the war was Hasdrubal's ambition and love of power. 2Â He tells us how, having acquired a great dominion in Spain, he arrived in Africa and attempted to abolish the constitution of Carthage and change the form of government to a monarchy. 3Â The leading statesmen, however, got wind of his project and united to oppose him, upon which Hasdrubal, suspicious of their intentions, left Africa and in future governed Iberia as he chose, without paying any attention to the Carthaginian Senate. 4Â Hannibal from boyhood had shared and admired Hasdrubal's principles; and on succeeding to the governor-generalship of Iberia, he had employed the same method as Hasdrubal. 6Â Consequently, he now began this war against Rome on his own initiative and in defiance of Carthaginian opinion, 7Â not a single one of the notables in Carthage approving his conduct towards Saguntum. 8Â After telling us this, Fabius says that on the capture of Â p23Â this city the Romans came forward demanding that the Carthaginians should either deliver Hannibal into their hands or accept war. 9Â Now if anyone were to pose the following question to this writer â how opportunity could have better favoured the Carthaginians' wishes or what could have been a juster act and more in their interest (since, as he says, they had disapproved Hannibal's action from the outset) 10Â than to yield to the Roman demand, and by giving up the man who had caused the offence, with some show of reason to destroy by the hands of others the common enemy of their state and secure the safety of their territory, ridding themselves of the war that menaced them and accomplishing their vengeance by a simple resolution â 11Â if anyone, IÂ say, were to ask him this, what would he have to say? Evidently nothing; for so far were they from doing any of the above things that after carrying on the war, in obedience to Hannibal's decision, for seventeen years, they did not abandon the struggle, until finally, every resource on which they relied being now exhausted, their native city and her inhabitants stood in deadly peril.

9 1Â One may ask why IÂ make any mention of Fabius and his statement. 2Â It is not from apprehension lest it may find acceptance from some owing to its plausibility; for its inherent unreasonableness, even without my comment, is self-evident to anyone who reads it. 3Â But what IÂ wish is to warn those who consult his books not to pay attention to the title, but to facts. 4Â For there are some people who pay regard not to what he writes but to the writer himself and, taking into consideration that he was a contemporary and a Roman senator, at once accept Â p25Â all he says as worthy of credit. 5Â But my own opinion is that while not treating his authority as negligible we should not regard it as final, but that readers should in most cases test his statements by reference to the actual facts.

6Â To return to the war between Rome and Carthage, from which this digression has carried us away, we must regard its first cause as being the indignation of Hamilcar surnamed Barcas, the actual father of Hannibal. 7Â Unvanquished in spirit by the war for Sicily, since he felt that he had kept the army of Eryx under his command combative and resolute until the end, and had only agreed to peace yielding to circumstances after the defeat of the Carthaginians in the naval battle, he maintained his resolve and waited for an opportunity to strike. 8Â Had not the mutinous outbreak among the mercenaries occurred, he would very soon, as far as it lay in his power, have created some other means and other resources for resuming the contest, 9Â but he was hampered by these civil disturbances which occupied all his time and attention. 10 1Â When, on the suppression of this disturbance by the Carthaginians, the Romans announced their intention of making war on Carthage, the latter at first was ready to negotiate on all points, thinking that, justice being on her side, she would prevail 2Â (about this IÂ have spoken in the preceding Books, without a perusal of which it is impossible to follow properly what IÂ am now saying and what IÂ am about to say); 3Â but as the Romans refused to negotiate, the Carthaginians had to yield to circumstances, and though deeply aggrieved they were powerless, and evacuated Â p27Â Sardinia, agreeing also to pay twelve hundred talents in addition to the sum previously exacted, in order not to be forced to accept war at that time. 4Â This, then, we must take to be the second and principal cause of the subsequent war; 5Â for Hamilcar, with the anger felt by all his compatriots at this last outrage added to his old indignation, as soon as he had finally crushed the mutiny of the mercenaries and secured the safety of his country, at once threw all his efforts into the conquest of Spain, with the object of using the resources thus obtained for the war against Rome. 6Â This success of the Carthaginian project in Spain must be held to be the third cause of the war, for relying on this increase of strength, they entered upon it with confidence.

7Â Of the fact that Hamilcar, although he died ten years before the beginning of the Second Punic War, contributed much to its origin many evidences can be found; but the anecdote IÂ am about to relate suffices, IÂ think, to confirm this. 11 1Â At the time when Hannibal on his final defeat by the Romans had left his native land and was staying at the court of Antiochus, the Romans, who saw through the project of the Aetolians, sent an embassy to Antiochus, wishing to be fully aware what the king's purpose was. 2Â The legates, as they saw that Antiochus was lending an ear to the Aetolians and was disposed to go to war with Rome, paid many attentions to Hannibal, wishing to make Antiochus suspicious of him, as in fact they succeeded in doing. 3Â For as time went on, the king's mistrust of Hannibal grew ever more strong; and it fell out on one occasion that Â p29Â they came to have a talk about the alienation which had been secretly growing up between them. 4Â In the course of the conversation Hannibal defended himself on various grounds, and at length, being at a loss for further arguments, resorted to the following. 5Â He said that at the time when his father was about to start with his army on his expedition to Spain, he himself, then nine years of age, was standing by the altar, while Hamilcar was sacrifi­cing to Zeus. 6Â When, on the omens being favourable, Hamilcar had poured a libation to the gods and performed all the customary rites, he ordered the others who were attending the sacrifice to withdraw to a slight distance and calling Hannibal to him asked him kindly if he wished to accompany him on the expedition. 7Â On his accepting with delight, and, like a boy, even begging to do it besides, his father took him by the hand, led him up to the altar, and bade him lay his hand on the victim and swear never to be the friend of the Romans. 8Â He begged Antiochus, then, now he knew this for a fact, as long as his intentions were hostile to Rome, to rely on him confidently and believe that he would have in him his sincerest supporter, 9Â but from the moment he made peace and alliance with her he had no need to wait for accusations but should mistrust and beware of him; for there was nothing he would not do against the Romans. 12 1Â Antiochus, listening to this, thought he spoke genuinely and sincerely and in consequence abandoned all his former mistrust. 2Â However, we should consider this as an unquestionable proof of Hamilcar's hostility and general purpose, and it is confirmed by the facts. 3Â For he made of his daughter's husband Hasdrubal and his own Â p31Â son Hannibal such enemies of Rome that none could be more bitter. 4Â As Hasdrubal died before putting his purpose into execution, it was not in his case fully evident, but circumstance put it in the power of Hannibal to give only too manifest proof of his inherited hatred of Rome. 5Â Therefore, statesmen should above all take care that the true motives of the reconciliation of enmities and the formation of friendships do not escape them. They should observe when it is that men come to terms under pressure of circumstances and when owing to their spirit being broken, 6Â so that in the former case they may regard them as reserving themselves for a favourable opportunity and be constantly on their guard, and in the latter they may trust them as true friends and subjects and not hesitate to command their services when required.

7Â We must consider, then, the causes of the Hannibalic War to have been those IÂ have stated, while its beginnings were as follows. 13 1Â The Carthaginians could ill bear their defeat in the war for Sicily, and, as IÂ said above, they were additionally exasperated by the matter of Sardinia and the exorbitancy of the sum they had been last obliged to agree to pay. 2Â Therefore, when they had subjugated the greater part of Iberia, they were quite ready to adopt any measures against Rome which suggested themselves. 3Â On the death of Hasdrubal, to whom after that of Hamilcar they had entrusted the government of Iberia, they at first waited for a pronouncement on the part of the troops, 4Â and when news reached them from their armies that the soldiers had unanimously chosen Hannibal as their commander, they hastened to summon a general assembly Â p33Â of the commons, which unanimously ratified the choice of the soldiers. 5Â Hannibal on assuming the command, at once set forth with the view of subduing a tribe called the Olcades, and arriving before their most powerful city Althaea,​1 6Â encamped there and soon made himself master of it by a series of vigorous and formidable assaults, upon which the rest of the tribe were overawed and submitted to the Carthaginians. 7Â After exacting tribute from the towns and possessing himself of a considerable sum, he retired to winter quarters at NewÂ Carthage. 8Â By the generosity he now displayed to the troops under his command, paying them in part and promising further payment, he inspired in them great good-will to himself and high hopes of the future. 14 1Â Next summer he made a fresh attack on the Vaccaei, assaulted and took Hermandica at the first onset, but Arbacala being a very large city with a numerous and brave population, he had to lay siege to it and only took it by assault after much pains. 2Â Subsequently on his return he unexpectedly found himself in great peril, the Carpetani, the strongest tribe in the district gathering to attack him and being joined by the neighbouring tribes, 3Â all incited to this by the fugitive Olcades, and also by those who had escaped from Hermandica. 4Â Had the Carthaginians been obliged to meet all this host in a pitched battle, they would assuredly have suffered defeat; 5Â but, as it was, Hannibal very wisely and skilfully faced about and retreated so as to place the river Tagus in his front, Â p35Â and remained there to dispute the crossing, availing himself of the aid both of the river and of his elephants, of which he had about forty, so that everything went as he had calculated and as no one else would have dared to expect. 6Â For when the barbarians tried to force a crossing at various points, the greater mass of them perished in coming out of the river, the elephants following its bank and being upon them as soon as they landed. 7Â Many also were cut down in the stream itself by the cavalry, as the horses could bear up better against the current, and the mounted men in fighting had the advantage of being higher than the unmounted enemy. 8Â Finally, Hannibal in his turn crossed the river and attacked the barbarians, putting to flight a force of more than oneÂ hundred thousand. 9Â After their defeat none of the peoples on that side of the Ebro ventured lightly to face the Carthaginians, with the exception of the Saguntines. 10Â Hannibal tried as far as he could to keep his hands off this city, wishing to give the Romans no avowed pretext for war, until he had secured his possession of all the rest of the country, following in this his father Hamilcar's suggestions and advice.

15 1Â But the Saguntines sent repeated messages to Rome, as on the one hand they were alarmed for their own safety and foresaw what was coming, and at the same time they wished to keep the Romans informed how well things went with the Carthaginians in Spain. 2Â The Romans, who had more than once paid little attention to them, sent on this occasion legates to report on the situation. 3Â Hannibal at the same time, having reduced the tribes he Â p37Â intended, arrived with his forces to winter at NewÂ Carthage, which was in a way the chief ornament and capital of the Carthaginian empire in Spain. 4Â Here he found the Roman legates, to whom he gave audience and listened to their present communication. 5Â The Romans protested against his attacking Saguntum, which they said was under their protection, or crossing the Ebro, contrary to the treaty engagements entered into in Hasdrubal's time. 6Â Hannibal, being young, full of martial ardour, encouraged by the success of his enterprises, and spurred on by his long-standing enmity to Rome, 7Â in his answer to the legates affected to be guarding the interests of the Saguntines and accused the Romans of having a short time previously, when there was a party quarrel at Saguntum and they were called in to arbitrate, unjustly put to death some of the leading men. The Carthaginians, he said, would not overlook this violation of good faith for it was from of old the principle of Carthage never to neglect the cause of the victims of injustice. 8Â To Carthage, however, he sent, asking for instructions, since the Saguntines, relying on their alliance with Rome, were wronging some of the peoples subject to Carthage. 9Â Being wholly under the influence of unreasoning and violent anger, he did not allege the true reasons, but took refuge in groundless pretexts, as men are wont to do who disregard duty because they are prepossessed by passion. 10Â How much better would it have been for him to demand from the Romans the restitution of Sardinia, and at the same time of the tribute which they had so unjustly exacted, availing themselves of the misfortunes of Carthage, and to threaten war in Â p39Â the event of refusal! 11Â But as it was, by keeping silent as to the real cause and by inventing a non-existing one about Saguntum, he gave the idea that he was entering on the war not only unsupported by reason but without justice on his side. 12Â The Roman legates, seeing clearly that war was inevitable, took ship for Carthage to convey the same protest to the Government there. 13Â They never thought, however, that the war would be in Italy, but supposed they would fight in Spain with Saguntum for a base.

16 1Â Consequently, the Senate, adapting their measures to this supposition, decided to secure their position in Illyria, as they foresaw that the war would be serious and long and the scene of it far away from home. 2Â It so happened that at that time in Illyria Demetrius of Pharos, oblivious of the benefits that the Romans had conferred on him, contemptuous of Rome because of the peril to which she was exposed first from the Gauls and now from Carthage, 3Â and pla­cing all his hopes in the Royal House of Macedon owing to his having fought by the side of Antigonus in the battles against Cleomenes, was sacking and destroying the Illyrian cities subject to Rome, and, sailing beyond Lissus, contrary to the terms of the treaty, with fifty boats, had pillaged many of the Cyclades. 4Â The Romans, in view of those proceedings and of the flourishing fortunes of the Macedonian kingdom, were anxious to secure their position in the lands lying east of Italy, feeling confident that they would have time to correct the errors of the Illyrians and rebuke and Â p41Â chastise Demetrius for his ingratitude and temerity. 5Â But in this calculation they were deceived; for Hannibal forestalled them by taking Saguntum, 6Â and, as a consequence, the war was not waged in Spain but at the very gates of Rome and through the whole of Italy. 7Â However, the Romans now moved by these considerations dispatched a force under Lucius Aemilius just before summer in the first year of the 140th Olympiad to operate in Illyria.

17 1Â Hannibal at the same time quitted NewÂ Carthage with his army and advanced towards Saguntum. 2Â This city lies on the seaward foot of the range of hills connecting Iberia and Celtiberia, at a distance of â¢about seven stades from the sea. 3Â The territory of the Saguntines yields every kind of crop and is the most fertile in the whole of Iberia. 4Â Hannibal, now encamping before the town, set himself to besiege it vigorously, foreseeing that many advantages would result from its capture. 5Â First of all he thought that he would thus deprive the Romans of any prospect of a campaign in Iberia, and secondly he was convinced that by this blow he would inspire universal terror, and render the Iberian tribes who had already submitted more orderly and those who were still independent more cautious, 6Â while above all he would be enabled to advance safely with no enemy left in his rear. 7Â Besides, he would then have abundant funds and supplies for his projected expedition, he would raise the spirit of his troops by the booty distributed Â p43Â among them and would conciliate the Carthaginians at home by the spoils he would send them. 8Â From all these considerations he actively pursued the siege, now setting an example to the soldiers by sharing personally the fatigue of the battering operations, now cheering on the troops and exposing recklessly to danger. 9Â At length after eight months of hardship and anxiety he took the city by storm. 10Â AÂ great booty of money, slaves, and property fell into his hands. The money, as he had determined, he set aside for his own purposes, the slaves he distributed among his men according to rank, and the miscellaneous property he sent off at once to Carthage. 11Â The result did not deceive his expectations, nor did he fail to accomplish his original purpose; but he both made his troops more eager to face danger and the Carthaginians more ready to accede to his demands on them, while he himself, by setting aside these funds, was able to accomplish many things of much service to him.

18 While this was taking place Demetrius, getting wind of the Romans' purpose, at once sent a considerable garrison to Dimale with the supplies requisite for such a force. In the other cities he made away with those who opposed his policy and placed the government in the hands of his friends 2Â while he himself, selecting six thousand of his bravest troops, quartered them at Pharos. 3Â The Roman Consul, on reaching Illyria with his army and observing that the enemy were very confident in Â p45Â the natural strength of Dimale and the measures they had taken for its defence, there being also a general belief that it was impregnable, decided to attack it first, wishing to strike terror into them. 4Â Having given instructions to his officers and erected batteries in several places he began to besiege it. 5Â By capturing it in seven days, he at one blow broke the spirit of all the enemy, 6Â so that from every city they at once flocked to surrender themselves unconditionally to Rome. 7Â Having accepted their submission and imposed suitable conditions on each he sailed to Pharos to attack Demetrius himself. 8Â Learning that the city was very strong, that a large force of exceptionally fine troops was assembled within it and that it was excellently furnished with supplies and munitions of war, he was apprehensive that the siege might prove difficult and long. 9Â In view of this, therefore, he employed the following impromptu stratagem. 10Â Sailing up to the island at night with his whole force he disembarked the greater part of it in certain well-wooded dells, 11Â and at daybreak with twenty ships sailed openly against the harbour which lies nearest to the town. 12Â Demetrius, seeing the ships and contemptuous of their small number, sallied from the city down to the harbour to prevent the enemy from landing. On his encountering them 19 1Â the struggle was very violent, and more and more troops kept coming out of the town to help, until at length the whole garrison had poured out to take part in the battle. 2Â The Roman force which had landed in the night now Â p47Â opportunely arrived, having marched by a concealed route, 3Â and occupying a steep hill between the city and the harbour, shut off from the town the troops who had sallied out. 4Â Demetrius, perceiving what had happened, desisted from opposing the landing and collecting his forces and cheering them on started with the intention of fighting a pitched battle with those on the hill. 5Â The Romans, seeing the Illyrians advancing resolutely and in good order, formed their ranks and delivered a terrible charge, 6Â while at the same time those who had landed from the ships, seeing what was going on, took the enemy in the rear, so that being attacked on all sides the Illyrians were thrown into much tumult and confusion. 7Â At the end, being hard pressed both in front and in the rear, Demetrius' troops turned and fled, some escaping to the city, but the greater number dispersing themselves over the island across country. 8Â Demetrius had some boats lying ready for such a contingency at a lonely spot, and retreating there and embarking sailed away at nightfall and managed to cross and reach King Philip, at whose court he spent the rest of his life. 9Â He was a man of a bold and venturesome spirit, but with an entire lack of reasoning power and judgement, 10Â defects which brought him to an end of a piece with the rest of his life. 11Â For having, with the approval of Philip, made a foolhardy and ill-managed attempt to seize Messene, he perished in the action, as IÂ shall narrate Â p49Â in detail when we reach that date. 12Â Aemilius, the Roman Consul, took Pharos at once by assault and razed it to the ground, and after subduing the rest of Illyria and organizing it as he thought best, returned to Rome late in summer and entered the city in triumph, acclaimed by all, 13Â for he seemed to have managed matters not only with ability, but with very high courage.

20 1Â The Romans, when the news of the fall of Saguntum reached them, did not assuredly hold a debate on the question of the war, as some authors allege, even setting down the speeches made on both sides â aÂ most absurd proceeding. 2Â For how could the Romans, who aÂ year ago had announced to the Carthaginians that their entering the territory of Saguntum would be regarded as a casus belli, now when the city itself had been taken by assault, assemble to debate whether to go to war or not? 3Â How is it that on the one hand these authors draw a wonderful picture of the gloomy aspect of the Senate and on the other tell us that fathers brought their sons from the age of twelve upwards to the Senate House, and that these boys attended the debate but divulged not a syllable even to any of their near relatives? 4Â Nothing in this is the least true or even probable, unless, indeed, Fortune has bestowed on the Romans among other gifts that of being wise from their cradles. 5Â No further criticism, indeed, of such works as those of Chaereas and Sosylus​2 is necessary; they rank in authority, it seems to me, not with history, but with the common gossip of a barber's shop.

Â p51Â 6Â The Romans, on hearing of the calamity that had befallen Saguntum, at once appointed ambassadors and sent them post-haste to Carthage, giving the Carthaginians the option of two alternatives, 7Â the one of which, if they accepted it, entailed disgrace and damage, while the other would give rise to extreme trouble and peril. 8Â Either they must give up Hannibal and the members of his Council or war would be declared. 9Â On the Roman envoys arriving and appearing before the Senate and delivering their message the Carthaginians listened with indignation to this choice of alternatives, 10Â but putting up their most able member to speak, they entered upon their justification. 21 1Â They said not a word of the treaty with Hasdrubal, considering it as not existent, or if existent, as not concerning them, since it was made without their approval. 2Â Here they quoted the precedent of the Romans themselves, alleging that the treaty made in the war for Sicily under Lutatius, though agreed to by Lutatius, had been repudiated by the Romans as having been made without their approval. 3Â In all their plea of justification they founded and insisted on the treaty at the end of the war for Sicily, 4Â in which they said there was no mention of Iberia, but it was expressly set down that the allies of each power should be secure from attack by the other. 5Â They pointed out that at that time the Saguntines were not the allies of Rome, and to prove their point they read aloud several extracts from the treaty. 6Â The Romans Â p53Â refused definitely to discuss the matter of justification, saying that while Saguntum still stood unharmed matters admitted of a plea of justification and it was possible to reach a decision on the disputed points by argument, 7Â but now that the treaty had been broken by the seizure of the city either they must give up the culprits, which would make it clear to all that they had no share in the wrong, but that it had been done without their approval, 8Â or if they refused to do so and thus confessed that they were participators in the misdeed they must accept war.

On this occasion the question was dealt with in more or less general terms, 9Â but IÂ think it necessary for myself not to neglect it, so that neither those whose duty and interest it is to be accurately informed about this may deviate from the truth in critical debates, 10Â nor students, led astray by the ignorance or partisan­ship of historians, acquire mistaken notions on the subject, but that there may be some survey generally recognized as accurate of the treaties between Rome and Carthage up to our own time.

22 1Â The first treaty between Rome and Carthage dates from the consul­ship of Lucius Junius Brutus and Marcus Horatius, the first Consuls after the expulsion of the kings, and the founders of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. 2Â This is twenty-eight years before the crossing of Xerxes to Greece. 3Â IÂ give below as accurate a rendering as IÂ can of this treaty, but the ancient Roman language differs so Â p55Â much from the modern that it can only be partially made out, and that after much application, by the most intelligent men. 4Â The treaty is more or less as follows: "There is to be friendship between the Romans and their allies and the Carthaginians and their allies on these terms: 5Â The Romans and their allies not to sail with long ships beyond the Fair Promontory 6Â unless forced by storm or by enemies: it is forbidden to anyone carried beyond it by force to buy or carry away anything beyond what is required for the repair of his ship or for sacrifice, 7Â and he must depart within five days. 8Â Men coming to trade may conclude no business except in the presence of a herald or town-clerk, 9Â and the price of whatever is sold in the presence of such shall be secured to the vendor by the state, if the sale take place in Libya or Sardinia. 10Â If any Roman come to the Carthaginian province in Sicily, he shall enjoy equal rights with the others. 11Â The Carthaginians shall do no wrong to the peoples of Ardea, Antium, Laurentium, Circeii, Terracina, or any other city of the Latins who are subject to Rome. 12Â Touching the Latins who are not subjects, they shall keep their hands off their cities, and if they take any city shall deliver it up to the Romans undamaged. 13Â They shall build no fort in the Latin territory. If they enter the land in arms, they shall not pass a night therein."

23 1Â The "Fair Promontory" is that lying in front of Carthage to the North. 2Â The Carthaginians forbid the Romans absolutely to sail south of this on its western side in long ships, the reason being, IÂ think that they did not wish them to become acquainted either with the district round Byssatis or Â p57Â that near the lesser Syrtis, which they call Emporia, owing to their great fertility. 3Â If anyone, carried there by a storm or driven by his enemies, requires anything for the purpose of sacrifi­cing to the gods or of repairing his ships, he may have this, but nothing beyond it, and those who touch there must leave within five days. 4Â To Carthage itself and all parts of Libya on this side of the Fair Promontory, to Sardinia and the Carthaginian province of Sicily the Romans may come for trading purposes, and the Carthaginian state engages to secure payment of their just debts. 5Â The phrasing of this treaty shows that they consider Sardinia and Libya as their own, whereas they distinctly express themselves otherwise about Sicily, mentioning only in the treaty those parts of it which are under Carthaginian rule. 6Â Similarly, the Romans include in the treaty Latium alone, making no mention of the rest of Italy as it was not then subject to their authority.

24 1Â At a later date they made another treaty, in which the Carthaginians include Tyre and Utica, 2Â and mention, in addition to the Fair Promontory, Mastia and Tarseum as points beyond which the Romans may not either make marauding expeditions, or trade, or found cities. This treaty is more or less as follows: 3Â "There is to be friendship on the following conditions between the Romans and their allies and the Carthaginians, Tyrians, and the people of Utica and their respective allies. 4Â The Romans shall not maraud or trade or found a city on the farther side of Fair Promontory, Mastia, and Â p59Â Tarseum. 5Â If the Carthaginians capture any city in Latium not subject to Rome, they shall keep the valuables and the men, but give up the city. 6Â If any Carthaginians take captive any of a people with whom the Romans have a treaty of peace, but who are not subject to Rome, they shall not bring them into Roman harbours, but if one be brought in and a Roman lay hold of him,​3 he shall be set free. 7Â The Romans shall not do likewise. 8Â If a Roman gets water or provisions from any place over which the Carthaginians rule, he shall not use these provisions to wrong any member of a people with whom the Carthaginians have peace and friendship. 9Â The Carthaginians shall not do likewise. 10Â If either do so, the aggrieved person shall not take private vengeance, and if he do, his wrongdoing shall be public. 11Â No Roman shall trade or found a city in Sardinia and Libya nor remain in a Sardinian or Libyan post longer than is required for taking in provisions or repairing his ship. If he be driven there by stress of weather, he shall depart within five days. 12Â In the Carthaginian province of Sicily and at Carthage he may do and sell anything that is permitted to a citizen. 13Â AÂ Carthaginian in Rome may do likewise."

14Â Again in this treaty they lay particular stress on Libya and Sardinia, asserting them to be their own private property and closing all landing-places to the Romans, 15Â but of Sicily they distinctly speak contrariwise, mentioning the part of it subject to them. 16Â Similarly, the Romans in referring to Latium forbid the Carthaginians to wrong the people of Ardea, Antium, Circeii, and Terracina, the cities that stand Â p61Â on the coast of that Latin territory with which the treaty is concerned.

25 1Â AÂ further and final treaty with Carthage was made by the Romans at the time of Pyrrhus' invasion before the Carthaginians had begun the war for Sicily. 2Â In this they maintain all the previous agreements and add the following: 3Â "If they make an alliance with Pyrrhus, both shall make it an express condition that they may go to the help of each other in whichever country is attacked. 4Â No matter which require help, the Carthaginians are to provide the ships for transport and hostilities, but each country shall provide the pay for its own men. 5Â The Carthaginians, if necessary, shall come to the help of the Romans by sea too, but no one shall compel the crews to land against their will."

6Â The oaths they had to swear were as follows. In the case of the first treaty the Carthaginians swore by their ancestral gods and the Romans, following an old custom, by Jupiter Lapis, and in the case of this latter treaty by Mars and Quirinus. 7Â The oath by Jupiter Lapis is as follows. The man who is swearing to the treaty takes in his hand a stone, and when he has sworn in the name of the state, he says, 8Â "If IÂ abide by this my oath may all good be mine, but if IÂ do otherwise in thought or act, let all other men dwell safe in their own countries under their own laws and in possession of their own substance, temples, and tombs, and mayÂ IÂ alone be cast forth, even as this stone," 9Â and so saying he throws the stone from his hand.

26 1Â The treaties being such, and preserved as they are on bronze tablets beside the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus in the treasury of the Quaestors, 2Â who Â p63Â can fail to be surprised at Philinus the historian, not indeed for his ignorance of them, for that is by no means surprising, since still in my time, the most aged among the Romans and Carthaginians and those best versed in public affairs were ignorant of them; 3Â but how did he venture and on what authority to state just the opposite, to wit that there was a treaty between Rome and Carthage by which the Romans were obliged to keep away from the whole of Sicily and the Carthaginians from the whole of Italy, 4Â and that the Romans broke the treaty and their oath by their first crossing to Sicily? There is, as a fact, no such document at all, nor ever was there; 5Â yet in his Second Book he states thus in so many words. IÂ mentioned the subject in the introductory part of this work, but deferred until the present occasion the detailed treatment it deserves, in view of the fact that many people, relying on Philinus' work, have false notions on the subject. 6Â True, if as regards the crossing of the Romans to Sicily anyone chooses to blame them for having ever consented to receive into their friendship and afterwards to help those Mamertines who seized treacherously not only Messene but Rhegium, he would have good reason for his disapproval, 7Â but if he supposes that they crossed contrary to treaty and to their oath he is obviously ignorant of the true facts.

27 1Â At the close of the war for Sicily, then, they made another treaty, the clauses of which run as follows: 2Â "The Carthaginians are to evacuate the whole of Sicily and all the islands between Italy and Sicily. 3Â The allies of both parties are to be Â p65Â secure from attack by the other. 4Â Neither party is entitled to impose any contribution to construct public buildings, or to enrol soldiers, in the dominions of the other, nor to form alliances with the allies of the other. 5Â The Carthaginians are to pay twenty-two hundred talents within ten years, and a sum of aÂ thousand talents at once. 6Â The Carthaginians are to give up to the Romans all prisoners free of ransom." 7Â Later, at the end of the Libyan War, after the Romans had actually passed a decree declaring war on Carthage, they added the following clauses, as IÂ stated above: 8Â "The Carthaginians are to evacuate Sardinia and pay a further sum of twelve hundred talents." 9Â The very last of this series of agreements that made with Hasdrubal in Spain, that "The Carthaginians are not to cross the Ebro in arms." 10Â Such is the diplomatic history of the relations between Rome and Carthage up to the time of Hannibal.

28 1Â While therefore we find that the crossing of the Romans to Sicily was not contrary to treaty, for the second war, that in which they made the treaty about Sardinia, it is impossible to discover any reasonable pretext or cause. 2Â In this case everyone would agree that the Carthaginians, contrary to all justice, and merely because the occasion permitted it, were forced to evacuate Sardinia and pay the additional sum IÂ mentioned. 3Â For from the charge brought by the Romans against them in justification of this, that in the Libyan war they inflicted wrongs on the crews of ships sailing from Rome, they had freed them on the occasion when they had received back from them all their sailors who had been brought into Carthage and in return gave back Â p67Â all their own prisoners as an act of grace and without ransom. 4Â Of this IÂ have spoken at length in my previous Book.

5Â Having established these facts it remains for us to consider, after thorough investigation, to which of the two states we should attribute the cause of the Hannibalic war.

29 1Â IÂ have already stated what the Carthaginians alleged, and will now give the reply of the Romans â aÂ reply indeed which they did not make at the time owing to their indignation at the loss of Saguntum, but it has been given on many occasions and by many different people at Rome. 2Â In the first place they contend that the treaty with Hasdrubal should not be ignored, as the Carthaginians had the audacity to say; for there was no conditioning clause at the end as in the treaty made by Lutatius: 3Â "This treaty shall be valid if the Roman people also agree to it," but Hasdrubal finally and unconditionally made the agreement in which was the clause, "The Carthaginians shall not cross the Ebro in arms." 4Â Again, in the treaty about Sicily there was, as the Carthaginians admit, the clause: "The allies of either party are to be secure from attack by the other," and this does not mean "those who were allies at that time," as the Carthaginians interpret it; 5Â for in that case there would have been a further clause to the effect that neither party should enter into other alliances than their existing ones or that those subsequently received into alliance should not be admitted to the benefits of the treaty. 6Â But since neither of these clauses was appended, it is evident that each party undertook that all allies of the other, both those then existing and those subsequently Â p69Â admitted to alliance, should be secure from attack. 7Â This indeed seems a quite reasonable view; for surely they would never have made a treaty by which they deprived themselves of the freedom to admit into alliance from time to time any peoples whose friendship seemed to be of advantage to them, 8Â nor, having taken such under their protection, was it to be supposed that they would ignore injuries done to them by certain people. 9Â But the chief meaning of the treaty to both parties when they made it was, that they should each leave unmolested the existing allies of the other and in no way admit any of those into their own alliance, 10Â whereas, regarding subsequent alliances, to which this clause particularly applies, they undertook not to enlist soldiers or levy contributions in the provinces of each or in countries allied to each, and that all allies of each in general should be secure from attack by the other.

30 1Â This being so, it is an acknowledged fact that the Saguntines, a good many years before the time of Hannibal, placed themselves under the protection of Rome. 2Â The surest proof of this, and one accepted by the Carthaginians themselves, is that when a civil disturbance broke out at Saguntum they did not call in the mediation of the Carthaginians, although they were close at hand and already concerning themselves with Spanish matters, but that of the Romans, and with their help set right the affairs of the state. 3Â Therefore, if we take the destruction of Saguntum to be the cause of the war we must allow that the Carthaginians were in the wrong in beginning the war, both in view of the treaty of Lutatius, in which it was stipulated that the allies Â p71Â of each should be secure from attack by the other, and in view of the convention made with Hasdrubal, by which the Carthaginians undertook not to cross the Ebro in arms. 4Â If, however, we take the cause of the war to have been the robbery of Sardinia and the tribute then exacted, we must certainly confess that they had good reason for entering on the Hannibalic war, since having yielded only to circumstances, they now availed themselves of circumstances to be avenged on those who had injured them.

31 1Â It might be said by some of these who look on such things without discernment, that these are matters which it was not necessary for me to treat in such detail. 2Â My answer is, that if there were any man who considered that he had sufficient force in himself to face any circumstances, IÂ should say perhaps that knowledge of the past was good for him, but not necessary; 3Â but if there is no one in this world at least who would venture to speak so of himself either as regards his private fortunes or those of his country â since, even if all is well with him now no man of sense could from his present circumstances have any reasonable confidence that he will be prosperous in the future â 4Â IÂ affirm for this reason that such knowledge is not only good but in the highest degree necessary. 5Â For how can anyone when wronged himself or when his country is wronged find helpmates and allies; how can he, when desirous of acquiring some possession or initiating some project, stir to action those whose co-operation he wishes; 6Â how, finally, if he is content with present conditions, can he rightly stimulate others to establish his own convictions and maintain things as they are, if he knows nothing at all of the Â p73Â past history of those he would influence? 7Â For all men are given to adapt themselves to the present and assume a character suited to the times, so that from their words and actions it is difficult to judge of the principles of each, and in many cases the truth is quite overcast. 8Â But men's past actions, bringing to bear the test of actual fact, indicate truly the principles and opinions of each, and show us where we may look for gratitude, kindness, and help, and where for the reverse. 9Â It is by this means that we shall often and in many circumstances find those who will compassionate our distresses, who will share our anger or join us in being avenged on our enemies, 10Â all which is most helpful to life both in public and in private. 11Â Therefore both writers and readers of history should not pay so much attention to the actual narrative of events, as to what precedes, what accompanies, and what follows each. 12Â For if we take from history the discussion of why, how, and wherefore each thing was done, and whether the result was what we should have reasonably expected, 13Â what is left is a clever essay but not a lesson, and while pleasing for the moment of no possible benefit for the future.

32 1Â For this reason IÂ must pronounce those to be much mistaken who think that this my work is difficult to acquire and difficult to read owing to the number and length of the Books it contains. 2Â How much easier it is to acquire and peruse forty Books, all as it were connected by one thread, and thus to follow clearly events in Italy, Sicily, and Libya from the time of Pyrrhus to the capture of Carthage, 3Â and Â p75Â those in the rest of the world from the flight of Cleomenes of Sparta on till the battle of the Romans and Achaeans at the Isthmus, than to read or procure the works of those who treat of particular transactions. 4Â Apart from their being many times as long as my history, readers cannot gather anything with certainty from them, firstly because most of them give different accounts of the same matter, 5Â and next because they omit those contemporary events by a comparative review and estimation of which we can assign its true value to everything much more surely than by judging from particulars; and, finally, because it is out of their power even to touch on what is most essential. 6Â For IÂ maintain that far the most essential part of history is the consideration of the remote or immediate consequences of events and especially that of causes. 7Â Thus IÂ regard the war with Antiochus as deriving its origin from that with Philip, the latter as resulting from that with Hannibal, and the Hannibalic war as a consequence of that about Sicily, the intermediate events, however many and various their character, all tending to the same purpose. 8Â All this can be recognized and understood from a general history, but not at all from the historians of the wars themselves, such as the war with Perseus or that with Philip, 9Â unless indeed anyone reading their descriptions of the battles alone conceives that he has acquired an adequate knowledge of the management and nature of the whole war. 10Â This, however, is not at all so, and IÂ consider that my history differs to its advantage Â p77Â as much from the works on particular episodes as learning does from listening.

33 1Â IÂ interrupted my narrative to enter on this digression at the point where the Roman ambassadors were at Carthage. After listening to the Carthaginians' statement of their case, they made no other reply but the following. 2Â The oldest member of the embassy, pointing to the bosom of his toga, told the Senate that it held both war and peace for them: therefore he would let fall from it and leave with them whichever of the two they bade him. 3Â The Carthaginian Suffete bade him let fall whichever the Romans chose, 4Â and when the envoy said he would let fall war, many of the senators cried out at once, "We accept it." The ambassadors and the Senate parted on these terms.

5Â Hannibal, who was wintering in NewÂ Carthage, in the first place dismissed the Iberians to their own cities hoping thus to make them readily disposed to help in the future; 6Â next he instructed his brother Hasdrubal how to manage the government of Spain and prepare to resist the Romans if he himself happened to be absent; 7Â in the third place he took precautions for the security of Africa, 8Â adopting the very sensible and wise policy of sending soldiers from Africa to Spain, and vice versa, binding by this measure the two provinces to reciprocal loyalty. 9Â The troops who crossed to Africa were supplied by the Thersitae, Mastiani, Iberian Oretes and Olcades, 10Â and numbered twelve hundred horse 11Â and thirteen thousand eight hundred and seventy Balearians, a popular appellation, derived from ballein, "to throw," and Â p79Â meaning slingers, given to them owing to their skill with this weapon and extended to their nation and islands. 12Â He stationed most of these troops at Metagonia in Libya and some in Carthage itself. 13Â From the soâcalled Metagonian towns he sent four thousand foot to Carthage to serve both as a reinforcement and as hostages. 14Â In Spain he left with his brother Hasdrubal fifty quinqueremes, two quadriremesÂº and all the triremes being fully manned. 15Â He also gave him as cavalry Liby-Phoenicians and Libyans to the number of four hundred and fifty, three hundred Ilergetes and eighteen hundred Numidians drawn from the Masylii, Masaesylii, Maccoei and Maurusi, who dwell by the ocean, 16Â and as infantry eleven thousand eight hundred and fifty Libyans, three hundred Ligurians, and five hundred Balearians, as well as twenty-one elephants.

17Â No one need be surprised at the accuracy of the information IÂ give here about Hannibal's arrangements in Spain, an accuracy which even the actual organizer of the details would have some difficulty in attaining, and IÂ need not be condemned off-hand under the idea that IÂ am acting like those authors who try to make their misstatements plausible. 18Â The fact is that IÂ found on the Lacinian promontory a bronze tablet on which Hannibal himself had made out these lists during the time he was in Italy, and thinking this an absolutely first-rate authority, decided to follow the document.

34 1Â Hannibal, after taking all precautions for the Â p81Â safety of Africa and Spain, was anxiously awaiting the arrival of the messengers he expected from the Celts. 2Â He had informed himself accurately about the fertility of the land at the foot of the Alps and near the river Po, the denseness of its population, the bravery of the men in war, 3Â and above all their hatred of Rome ever since that former war with the Romans which IÂ described in the preceding Book to enable my readers to follow all IÂ am about to narrate. 4Â He therefore cherished high hopes of them, and was careful to send messengers with unlimited promises to the Celtic chiefs both on this side of the Alps and in the mountains themselves, 5Â thinking that the only means of carrying the war against the Romans into Italy was, after surmounting, if possible, the difficulties of the route, to reach the above country and employ the Celts as co-operators and confederates in his enterprise. 6Â When the messengers arrived and reported that the Celts consented and awaited him, at the same time saying that the crossing of the Alps was very toilsome and difficult, but by no means impossible, he drew out his troops from their winter quarters in the early spring. 7Â As the news of what had happened in Carthage had just reached him, his spirits were now high, and trusting in the favourable disposition of the citizens, he now called openly on his men to join him in the war against Rome, 8Â impressing upon them the demand of the Romans that he and all his principal officers should be given up to them, and pointing out at the same time the wealth of the country they were Â p83Â bound for and the friendly feelings of the Gauls who would be their allies. 9Â When he saw that the soldiers listened gladly and were as eager as himself to be off, he commended their alacrity and after ordering them to be ready on the day fixed for his departure, dismissed the meeting.

35 1Â Having completed the arrangements IÂ mentioned above during the winter and thus assured the security of Africa and Spain, he advanced on the day he had fixed with an army of about ninety thousand foot and twelve thousand horse. 2Â Crossing the Ebro, he set about subduing the tribes of the Ilurgetes, Bargusii, Aerenosii, and Andosini as far as the Pyrenees, 3Â and having reduced them all and taken some cities by assault, with unexpected rapidity indeed, but after many severe engagements and with great loss, 4Â he left Hanno in command of all the country on this side of the river, pla­cing the Bargusii under his absolute rule, as he mistrusted them most, owing to their friendly sentiments toward Rome. 5Â He assigned to Hanno out of his own army ten thousand foot and one thousand horse, and he left with him all the heavy baggage of the expeditionary force. 6Â He dismissed at the same time an equal number of troops to their homes, with the view of leaving them well disposed to himself and encouraging the hope of a safe return in the rest of the Spaniards, not only those who were serving with him, but those who remained at home, so that if he ever had to call on them for reinforcements, they might all readily respond. 7Â With the rest of his force, thus lightened of its impedimenta and Â p85Â consisting now of fifty thousand foot and about nine thousand horse, he advanced throughout the Pyrenees towards the crossing of the Rhone, 8Â having now an army not so strong in number as serviceable and highly trained owing to the unbroken series of wars in Spain.

36 1Â That my narrative may not be altogether obscure to readers owing to their ignorance of the topography IÂ must explain whence Hannibal started, what countries he traversed, and into what part of Italy he descended. 2Â Nor must IÂ simply give the names of countries, rivers, and cities, as some authors do under the idea that this is amply sufficient for a clear knowledge. 3Â IÂ am of opinion that as regards known countries the mention of names is of no small assistance in recalling them to our memory, but in the case of unknown lands such citation of names is just of as much value as if they were unintelligible and inarticulate sounds. 4Â For the mind here has nothing to lean upon for support and cannot connect the words with anything known to it, so that the narrative is associated with nothing in the readers' mind,​4 and therefore meaningless to him. 5Â We must therefore make it possible when speaking of unknown places to convey to the reader a more or less real and familiar notion of them.

6Â Now the primary and most general conception and one common to all mankind is the division and ordering of the heavens by which all of us, even those of the meanest capacity, distinguish East, West, South, and North. 7Â The next step in knowledge is to classify the parts of the earth under each of these divisions, Â p87Â ever mentally referring each statement to one of them until we arrived at a familiar conception of unknown and unseen regions. 37 1Â This once established as regards the whole earth, it remains for me to lay before my readers the division on the same principle of that portion of the world known to us. 2Â This is divided into three parts, each with its name, the one part being called Asia, the second Africa, and the third Europe. 3Â Their respective boundaries are the river Don, the Nile, and the straits at the Pillars of Hercules. 4Â Asia lies between the Nile and Don and falls under that portion of the heaven lying between the north-east and the south. 5Â Africa lies between the Nile and the Pillars of Hercules, and it falls under the south to the south-west and west, as far as the point of the equinoctial sunset, in which latter quarter are the Pillars of Hercules. 6Â These two divisions of the earth, then, regarded from a general point of view, occupy the part of it which lies to the south of the Mediterranean, reaching from east to west. 7Â Europe lies opposite to them on the north shore of this sea, extending continuously from east to west, 8Â its most compact and deepest portion lying due north between the Don and the Narbo, the latter river being not far to the west of Marseilles and of the mouths by which the Rhone discharges itself into the Sardinian Sea. 9Â The Celts inhabit the Â p89Â country near the Narbo and beyond it as far as the chain of the Pyrenees which stretches in an unbroken line from the Mediterranean to the Outer Sea. 10Â The remaining part of Europe beyond the Pyrenees reaching to its western end and to the Pillars of Hercules is bounded on the one side by the Mediterranean and on the other by the Outer Sea, that portion of which is washed by the Mediterranean as far as the Pillars of Hercules being called Iberia, 11Â while that part which lies along the Outer or Great Sea has no general name, as it has only recently come under notice, but is all densely inhabited by barbarous tribes of whom IÂ shall speak more particularly on a subsequent occasion. 38 1Â Just as with regard to Asia and Africa where they meet in Aethiopia no one up to the present has been able to say with certainty whether the southern extension of them is continuous land or is bounded by a sea, 2Â so that part of Europe which extends to the north between the Don and Narbo is up to now unknown to us, and will remain so unless the curiosity of explorers lead to some discoveries in the future. 3Â We must pronounce that those who either by word of mouth or in writing make rash statements about these regions have no knowledge of them, and invent mere fables.

4Â IÂ have said so much in order that my narrative should not be without something to range itself under in the minds of those who are ignorant of the localities, but that they should have some notion at least of the main geographical distinctions, with which they can connect in thought and to which they can refer my statements, calculating the position of places from the quarter of the heaven under which they lie. 5Â For as in the case of physical sight we Â p91Â are in the habit of turning our faces in the direction of any object pointed out to us, so should we mentally ever turn and shift our glance to each place to which the story calls our attention.

39 1Â Dismissing this matter IÂ will now continue my narrative. 2Â At the time of which we are speaking the Carthaginians were masters of all that part of Africa which looks towards the Mediterranean from the Altars of Philaenus​5 on the Greater Syrtis as far as the Pillars of Hercules. 3Â The length of this coast-line is â¢more than sixteen thousand stades. 4Â Crossing the straits at the Pillars of Hercules they had similarly subdued all Iberia as far as the point on the coast of the Mediterranean where the Pyrenees, which separate the Celts from the Iberians, end. 5Â This spot is â¢about eight thousand stades distant from the mouth of this sea at the Pillars of Hercules, 6Â the distance being â¢three thousand stades from the Pillars to NewÂ Carthage, from which place Hannibal started for Italy, â¢two thousand six hundred stades from hence to the Ebro, 7Â and from the Ebro to Emporium â¢one thousand six hundred stades. 8Â From Emporium to Narbo it is â¢about six hundred stades, and from Narbo to the passage of the Rhone about sixteen hundred, this part of the road having now been carefully measured by the Romans and marked with milestones at every eighth stade. 9Â From the passage of the Rhone, following the bank of the river in the direction of its source as far as the foot of the pass across the Alps to Italy, the distance is Â p93Â â¢fourteen hundred stades, 10Â and the length of the actual pass which would bring Hannibal down into the plain of theÂ Po, about twelve hundred. 11Â So that to arrive there he had, starting from NewÂ Carthage, to march â¢about nine thousand stades. 12Â Of this, as far as distance goes, he had nearly traversed the half, but if we look to difficulty far the largest part lay before him.

40 1Â While Hannibal was thus attempting to cross the Pyrenees, in great fear of the Celts owing to the natural strength of the passes, 2Â the Romans, having received from the envoys they had sent to Carthage an account of the decision arrived at, and the speeches made there, and on news reaching them sooner than they had expected that Hannibal had crossed the Ebro with his army, determined to send, with their legions, the Consuls Publius Cornelius Scipio to Spain and Tiberius Sempronius Longus to Africa.

3Â While occupied in enrolling the legions and making other preparations they were pushing on the project of establishing in Cisalpine Gaul the colonies on which they had decided. 4Â They took active steps to fortify the towns, and ordered the colonists, who were about six thousand in number for either city, to be on the spot within thirty days. 5Â The one city they founded on this side of theÂ Po, calling it Placentia, the other, which they named Cremona, on the far side. 6Â Scarce had both these colonies been established when the Boii Gauls, who had been for long as it were lying in wait to throw off their allegiance to Rome, but had hitherto found no Â p95Â opportunity, 7Â elated now by the messages they received assuring them of the near arrival of the Carthaginians, revolted from Rome, abandoning the hostages they gave at end of the former war which IÂ described in my last Book. 8Â Calling on the Insubres to join them, whose support they easily gained owing to their long-standing rancour against Rome, they overran the lands which the Romans had allotted to their colonies and on the settlers taking to flight, pursued them to Mutina, a Roman colony, and there besieged them. 9Â Among those shut up there were three men of high rank who had been sent to carry out the partitionment of the country, Gaius Lutatius, a former Consul, and two former Praetors. 10Â On these three requesting a parley with the Boii, the latter consented, but when they came out for the purpose they treacherously made them prisoners, hoping by means of them to get back their own hostages. 11Â When the Praetor Lucius Manlius, who with his troops was occupying an advanced position in the neighbourhood, heard of this, he hastened up to give help. 12Â The Boii had heard of his approach, and posting ambuscades in a certain forest attacked him from all sides at once as soon as he reached the wooded country, and killed many of the Romans. 13Â The remainder at first took to flight, but on getting to higher ground rallied just enough to give their retreat an appearance of order. The Boii following at their heels shut this force too up in the place called Vicus Tannetis.​6 14Â When the news reached Rome that the Â p97Â fourth legion was surrounded by the Boii and besieged, they instantly sent off the legions destined for Publius under the command of a Praetor to its assistance, ordering Publius to enrol other legions from the allies.

41 1Â The condition and course of Celtic affairs from the outset up to the arrival of Hannibal were such as IÂ have narrated here and in the previous Book. 2Â The two Roman Consuls, having made all preparations for their respective enterprises, set sail early in summer to take in hand the operations determined on, Publius bound for Iberia with sixty ships and Tiberius Sempronius for Africa with aÂ hundred and sixty quinqueremes. 3Â With these he threatened such a redoubtable expedition and made such vast preparations at Lilybaeum, collecting all kinds of forces from everywhere, that it seemed as if he expected to sail up to Carthage and at once lay siege to it. 4Â Publius, coasting along Liguria, reached the neighbourhood of Marseilles from Pisa in five days, 5Â and coming to anchor off the first mouth of the Rhone, known as the Massaliotic mouth, 6Â disembarked his forces there, having heard that Hannibal was already crossing the Pyrenees, but convinced that he was still at a distance of many days' march owing to the difficulty of the country and the numbers of Celtic tribes between them. 7Â Hannibal, however, who had bribed some of the Celts and forced others to give him passage, unexpectedly appeared with his army at the crossing of the Rhone, having marched with the Sardinian Sea on his right. 8Â Publius, when the arrival of the enemy was reported to him, being partly incredulous owing to the Â p99Â cupidity of their advance and partly desirous of ascertaining the exact truth â while he himself was refreshing his troops after their voyage and consulting with his Tribunes in what place it would be wisest to offer battle to the enemy â 9Â sent out three hundred of his bravest cavalry, giving them as guides and supports certain Celts who were in the service of the Massaliots as mercenaries.

42 1Â Hannibal, on reaching the neighbourhood of the river, at once set about attempting to cross it where the stream is single at a distance of about four days' march from the sea. 2Â Doing his best to make friends with the inhabitants of the bank, he bought up all their canoes and boats, amounting to a considerable number, since many of the people on the banks of the Rhone engage in maritime traffic. 3Â He also got from them the logs suitable for making the canoes, so that in two days he had an innumerable quantity of ferry-boats, every one doing his best to dispense with any assistance and relying on himself for his chance of getting across. 4Â In the meantime a large force of barbarians had gathered on the opposite bank to prevent the Carthaginians from crossing. 5Â Hannibal observing this and concluding that as things stood it was neither possible to force a crossing in face of such a strong hostile force nor to put it off, lest he should find himself attacked on all sides, 6Â sent off on the third night after his arrival a portion of his army, giving them native guides and pla­cing them under the command of Hanno, the son of Bomilcar the Suffete. Â p101Â 7Â Advancing up the bank of the river for â¢two hundred stades they reached a place at which the stream divides, forming an island, and here they stopped. 8Â Using the timber they found ready to hand and either nailing or lashing logs together they soon constructed aÂ number of rafts sufficient for their present need, and on these they crossed in safety, meeting with no opposition. 9Â Occupying a post of some natural strength they remained there for that day to rest after their exertions and at the same time to prepare for the movement which they had been ordered to execute. 10Â Hannibal, moreover, with the part of the army that remained behind with him, was similarly occupied. 11Â The question that caused him the greatest embarrassment was how to get the elephants, thirty-seven in number, across.

43 1Â On the fifth night, however, the force which had already crossed began a little before dawn to advance along the opposite bank against the barbarians there, 2Â while Hannibal had got his soldiers ready and was waiting till the time for crossing came. He had filled the boats with his light horse and the canoes with his lightest infantry. 3Â The large boats were placed highest up stream and the lighter ferry-boats farther down, so that the heavier vessels receiving the chief force of the current, the canoes should be less exposed to risk in crossing. 4Â They hit on the plan of towing the horses astern of the boats swimming, one man at each side of the stern guiding three or four horses by their leading reins, so that Â p103Â a considerable number were got across at once in the first batch. 5Â The barbarians seeing the enemy's project poured out of their camp, scattered and in no order, feeling sure that they would easily prevent the Carthaginians from landing. 6Â Hannibal, as soon as he saw that the force he had previously sent across was near at hand on the opposite bank, they having announced their approach by a smoke-signal as arranged, ordered all in charge of the ferry-boats to embark and push up against the current. 7Â He was at once obeyed, and now with the men in the boats shouting as they vied with one another in their efforts and struggled to stem the current, 8Â with the two armies standing on either bank at the very brink of the river, the Carthaginians following the progress of the boats with loud cheers and sharing in the fearful suspense, and the barbarians yelling their war-cry and challenging to combat, the scene was in the highest degree striking and thrilling. 9Â At this moment, the barbarians having deserted their tents, the Carthaginians on the far bank attacked suddenly and unexpectedly, and while some of them set fire to the enemy's encampment, the larger portion fell upon the defenders of the passage. 10Â The barbarians, taken quite by surprise, rushed some of them to save their tents, while others defended themselves against their assailants. 11Â Hannibal, all falling out favourably as he had purposed, at once marshalled those of his men who were the first to land, and after addressing some words of exhortation to them, led them to meet the barbarians, 12Â upon which the Celts, owing to their disordered Â p105Â condition and to their being taken by surprise, soon turned and took to flight.

44 1Â The Carthaginian general, having thus made himself master of the passage and defeated the enemy, at once occupied himself in fetching over the men who had been left on the other bank, 2Â and having in a very short time brought his whole army across encamped for that night beside the river. 3Â Next morning, hearing that the Roman fleet was anchored off the mouths of the Rhone, he selected five hundred of his Numidian horse and sent them off to observe the whereabouts and number of the enemy and what they were about. 4Â At the same time he set the proper men to the task of bringing the elephants across 5Â and then called a meeting of his soldiers and, introdu­cing Magilus and the other chieftains who had come to him from the plain of theÂ Po, made the troops acquainted through a dragoman with what they reported to be the decision of their tribes. 6Â What encouraged the soldiers most in their address was firstly the actual and visible presence of those Gauls who were inviting them to Italy and promising to join them in the war against Rome, 7Â and secondly the reliance they placed on their promise to guide them by a route which would take them without their being exposed to any privations, rapidly and safely to Italy. 8Â In addition to this the Gauls dwelt on the richness and extent of the country they were going to, and the eager spirit of the men by whose side they were about to face the armies of Rome. 9Â The Celts, after speaking in this sense, withdrew, 10Â and Hannibal Â p107Â himself now came forward and began by reminding them of their achievements in the past: though, he said, they had undertaken many hazardous enterprises and fought many a battle they had never met with ill success when they followed his plans and counsels. 11Â Next he bade them be of good heart considering that the hardest part of their task was now accomplished, since they had forced the passage of the river and had the testimony of their own eyes and ears to the friendly sentiments and readiness to help of their allies. 12Â He begged them therefore to be at their ease about details which were his own business, but to obey orders and behave like brave men and in a manner worthy of their own record in the past. 13Â When the men applauded him, exhibiting great enthusiasm and ardour, he commended them and, after offering a prayer to the gods on behalf of all, dismissed them, bidding them get everything ready expeditiously as they would start on their march next day.

45 1Â After the assembly had broken up the Numidian scouts who had been sent out to reconnoitre returned, the greater part of the force lost and the remainder in headlong flight. 2Â Not far from their own camp they had fallen in with the Roman cavalry sent out by Publius on the same errand, and both forces had shown such heroism in the engagement that the Romans and Celts lost about aÂ hundred and forty horsemen and the Numidians more than two hundred. 3Â Afterwards the Romans carried their pursuit close up to the Carthaginian camp, and having surveyed it, turned and hastily rode off to report to the Consul the arrival of the Â p109Â enemy, and on reaching their camp did so. 4Â Publius at once put his baggage on board the ships and started with his whole army marching up the river bank with the view of encountering the Carthaginians.

5Â Hannibal, on the day after the assembly, advanced his cavalry in the direction of the sea to act as a covering force and then moved his infantry out of the camp and sent them off on their march, 6Â while he himself waited for the elephants and the men who had been left with them. The way they got the elephants across was as follows. 46 1Â They built aÂ number of very solid rafts and lashing two of these together fixed them very firmly into the bank of the river, their united width being â¢about fifty feet. 2Â To these they attached others on the farther side, prolonging the bridge out into the stream. 3Â They secured the side of it which faced the current by cables attached to the trees that grew on the bank, so that the whole structure might remain in place and not be shifted by the current. 4Â When they had made the whole bridge or pier of rafts â¢about two hundred feet long they attached to the end of it two particularly compact ones, very firmly fastened to each other, but so connected with the rest that the lashings could easily be cut. 5Â They attached to these several towing-lines by which boats were to tow them, not allowing them to be carried down stream, but holding them up against the current, and thus were to convey the elephants which would be in Â p111Â them across. 6Â After this they piled up a quantity of earth on all the line of rafts, until the whole was on the same level and of the same appearance as the path on shore leading to the crossing. 7Â The animals were always accustomed to obey their mahouts up to the water, but would never enter it on any account, and they now drove them along over the earth with two females in front, whom they obediently followed. 8Â As soon as they set foot on the last rafts the ropes which held these fast to the others were cut, and the boats pulling taut, the towing-lines rapidly tugged away from the pile of earth the elephants and the rafts on which they stood. 9Â Hereupon the animals becoming very alarmed at first turned round and ran about in all directions, but as they were shut in on all sides by the stream they finally grew afraid and were compelled to keep quiet. 10Â In this manner, by continuing to attach two rafts to the end of the structure, they managed to get most of them over on these, 11Â but some were so frightened that they threw themselves into the river when half-way across. The mahouts of these were all drowned, but the elephants were saved, 12Â for owing to the power and length of their trunks they kept them above the water and breathed through them, at the same time spouting out any water that got into their mouths and so held out, most of them passing through the water on their feet.

47 1Â After the elephants had been put across, Hannibal, taking them and his cavalry and forming these into a rear-guard, advanced up the river bank away from the sea in an easterly direction as though making for the centre of Europe. 2Â The Rhone rises north-west of the head of the Adriatic on the northern Â p113Â slope of the Alps, and running in a south-westerly direction, falls into the Sardinian Sea. 3Â AÂ great part of its course is through a deep valley, to the north of which lives the Celtic tribe of the Ardyes, while on the south it is bounded for its whole extent by the northern spurs of the Alps. 4Â The plain of theÂ Po which IÂ described above at length is separated from the Rhone valley by the lofty main chain of these mountains, which starting from Marseilles extends to the head of the Adriatic. 5Â It is this chain which Hannibal now crossed to enter Italy from the Rhone valley.

6Â Some of the writers who have described this passage of the Alps, from the wish to impress their readers by the marvels they recount of these mountains, are betrayed into two vices ever most alien to true history; for they are compelled to make both false statements and statements which contradict each other. 7Â While on the one hand introdu­cing Hannibal as a commander of unequalled courage and foresight, they incontestably represent him to us as entirely wanting in prudence, 8Â and again, being unable to bring their series of falsehoods to any close or issue they introduce gods and the sons of gods into the sober history of the facts. 9Â By representing the Alps as being so steep and rugged that not only horses and troops accompanied by elephants, but even active men on foot would have difficult in passing, and at the same time picturing to us the desolation of the country as being such, that unless Â p115Â some god or hero had met Hannibal and showed him the way, his whole army would have gone astray and perished utterly, they unquestionably fall into both the above vices. 48 1Â For in the first place can we imagine a more imprudent general or a more incompetent leader than Hannibal would have been, 2Â if with so large an army under his command and all his hopes of ultimate success resting on it, he did not know the roads and the country, as these writers say, and had absolutely no idea where he was marching or against whom, 3Â or in fact if his enterprise were feasible or not? 4Â What they would have us believe is that Hannibal, who had met with no check to diminish his high hopes of success, ventured on a course that no general, even after a crushing defeat and utterly at his wits' end, would take, to march, that is, into a country as to which he had no information. 5Â Similarly, in what they say about the loneliness, and the extreme steepness and difficulty of the road, the falsehood is manifest. 6Â For they never took the trouble to learn that the Celts who live near the Rhone not on one or on two occasions only before Hannibal's arrival but often, and not at any remote date but quite recently, had crossed the Alps with large armies and met the Romans in the field side by side with the Celts who inhabit the plain of theÂ Po (as IÂ narrated in an earlier Book) 7Â nor are they aware that there is a considerable population in the Alps themselves; but in entire ignorance of all this they tell us that some hero appeared and showed the road. 8Â The natural consequence is that they get into the same difficulties as tragic dramatists all of whom, to bring Â p117Â their dramas to a close, require a deus ex machina, as the data they choose on which to found their plots are false and contrary to reasonable probability. 9Â These writers are necessarily in the same spirit and invent apparitions of heroes and gods, since the beginnings on which they build are false and improbable; for how is it possible to finish conformably to reason what has been begun in defiance of it? 10Â Of course Hannibal did not act as these writers describe, but conducted his plans with sound practical sense. 11Â He had ascertained by careful inquiry the richness of the country into which he proposed to descend and the aversion of the people to the Romans, and for the difficulties of the route he employed as guides and pioneers natives of the country, who were about to take part in his adventure. 12Â On these points IÂ can speak with some confidence as IÂ have inquired about the circumstances from men present on the occasion and have personally inspected the country and made the passage of the Alps to learn for myself and see.

49 1Â Now the Roman Consul Publius arrived at the crossing of the river three days after the departure of the Carthaginians, and finding the enemy gone was in the highest degree astonished, 2Â as he had been convinced that they would never venture to march on Italy by this route owing to the number and unruly character of the native inhabitants. 3Â On seeing that they had done so he returned with all speed to his ships and began to embark his forces. 4Â Sending his brother to conduct the campaign in Spain, he himself turned back and made sail for Â p119Â Italy with the design of marching rapidly through Etruria and reaching the foot of the pass over the Alps before the enemy.

5Â Hannibal, marching steadily from the crossing-place for four days, reached a place called the "Island," a populous district produ­cing abundance of corn and deriving its name from its situation; 6Â for the Rhone and IsÃ¨re running along each side of it meet at its point. 7Â It is similar in size and shape to the Egyptian Delta; only in that case the sea forms the base line uniting the two branches of the Nile, while here the base line is formed by a range of mountains difficult to climb or penetrate, and, one may say, almost inaccessible. 8Â On arriving there he found two brothers disputing the crown and posted over against each other with their armies, 9Â and on the elder one making overtures to him and begging him to assist in establishing him on the throne, he consented, it being almost a matter of certainty that under present circumstances this would be of great service to him. 10Â Having united with him therefore to attack and expel the other, he derived great assistance from the victor; 11Â for not only did he furnish the army with plenty of corn and other provisions but he replaced all their old and worn weapons by new ones, thus freshening up the whole force very opportunely. 12Â He also supplied most of them with warm clothing and foot-wear, things of the greatest possible service to them in crossing the mountains. 13Â But the most important of all was, that the Carthaginians being not at all easy on the Â p121Â subject of their passage through the territory of the Allobroges, he protected them in the rear with his own forces and enabled them to reach the foot of the pass in safety.

50 1Â After a ten days' march of â¢eight hundred stades along the bank of the IsÃ¨re​7 Hannibal began the ascent of the Alps and now found himself involved in very great difficulties. 2Â For as long as they had been in flat country, the various chiefs of the Allobroges had left them alone, being afraid both of the cavalry and of the barbarians who were escorting them. 3Â But when the latter had set off on their return home, and Hannibal's troops began to advance into the difficult region, the Allobrogian chieftains got together a considerable force and occupied advantageous positions on the road by which the Carthaginians would be obliged to ascend. 4Â Had they only kept their project secret, they would have utterly annihilated the Carthaginian army, but, as it was, it was discovered, and though they inflicted a good deal of damage on Hannibal, they did more injury to themselves; 5Â for the Carthaginian general having learnt that the barbarians had seized on these critical positions, encamped himself at the foot of the pass, and remaining there 6Â sent on in advance some of his Gaulish guides, to reconnoitre and report on the enemy's plan and the whole situation. 7Â His orders were executed, and on learning that the enemy remained most strictly at their post during the day-time but retired at night to a neighbouring township, he adapted his measures to this intelligence Â p123Â and arranged the following plan. 8Â He advanced openly with his whole army, and on approaching the difficult points he encamped not far from the enemy. 9Â As soon as it was night, he ordered the fires to be lit, and leaving the greater part of his forces there, took the men most fitted for the enterprise, whom he had lightened of their accoutrements, and passing through the narrow part of the road occupied the posts abandoned by the enemy, who had retired as usual to the town. 51 1Â At daylight the enemy observed what had happened and at first desisted from their project, 2Â but afterwards on seeing the long string of sumpter-animals and horsemen slowly and with difficulty winding up the narrow path, they were tempted by this to molest their march. 3Â On their doing so and attacking at several different points, the Carthaginians suffered great loss chiefly in horses and sumpter-mules, not so much at the hands of the barbarians as owing to the ground. 4Â For the road up the pass being not only narrow and uneven but precipitous, the least movement or disturbance caused many of the animals to be pushed over the precipice with their packs. 5Â It was chiefly the horses on being wounded which caused the disturbance, some of them, terrified by the pain, turning and meeting the pack-animals and others rushing on ahead and pushing aside in the narrow path everything that came in their way, thus creating a general confusion. 6Â Hannibal, on seeing this and reflecting that there would be no chance of safety even for those who escaped from the battle if the pack-train were destroyed, took with him the men Â p125Â who had occupied the heights at night and hastened to render assistance to the head of the marching column. 7Â He inflicted great loss on the Allobroges, as he was charging from higher ground, but the loss was equally heavy among his own troops, 8Â since the column on the march was thrown into further confusion in both directions at once owing to the shouting and struggling of those taking part in this combat. 9Â It was only when he had put the greater part of the Allobroges to the sword and compelled the rest to take to flight and run for their own land, that the remainder of the pack-train and the horses got slowly and with great difficulty over the dangerous part, 10Â and he himself rallying as many troops as he could after the fight, attacked the town from which the enemy had issued to make their onslaught. 11Â He found it nearly deserted, as all the inhabitants had been tempted out by hope of pillage, and seized on it. This proved of great service to him for the future as well as the present; 12Â for not only did he recover aÂ number of pack-animals and horses and the men who had been captured together with them, but he got a supply of corn and cattle amply sufficient for two or three days, 13Â and in addition to this he struck such terror into the next tribes that none of those in the neighbourhood of the ascent were likely to venture to molest him.

52 1Â For the present, he encamped here, and after a stay of one day resumed his march. 2Â For the following days he conducted the army in safety up to a certain point, but on the fourth day he was again placed in great danger. 3Â The natives near the pass conspired together and came out to meet him with treacherous intentions, holding olive-branches Â p127Â and wreaths, which nearly all the barbarians use as tokens of friendship, just as we Greeks use the herald's staff. 4Â Hannibal, who was a little suspicious of such proffer of alliance, took great pains to ascertain what their project and general motives were. 5Â When they told him that they knew all about the capture of the city and the destruction of those who had attempted to do him wrong, and assured him that for this reason they were come to him, as they neither wished to inflict nor to suffer any injury, and on their promising to give him hostages from among themselves, 6Â he for long hesitated, distrusting their word. But, reflecting that i
