Creating value, growing together Value Proposition Glenn, an Azelis Americas company, provides comprehensive service through the delivery of specialty chemical solutions for the formulation of Personal Care and Home Care & Industrial Cleaning products. Our super-regional footprint accompanied by our technical competence and our optimized marketing engine exemplify our value-added standards to both our supplier partners and customers.\n\n3. Creating value, growing together 1. Market Data 2. Consumer Data 3. Ethnic Hair Types and Routines 4. Product Examples Ethnic Hair Care market Trends & Formulation Solutions\n\n4. 4 Growing Economic Opportunity Justifies Product Development • Greater Black population rise vs. Whites: the population of Black consumers in the US is expected to rise 5% between 2015 and 2020 vs. 2.8% for White. • Black spending power: projected to increase to $1.4 trillion by 2020, which would make their spending power in terms of GDP as large as Mexico (only $320 million in 1990). • Experimenting with different hair/fashion styles: important to 37% of Black women (vs. 14% of men) – boding well for hair styling products. • Usage: styling products are used by 51% of Black consumers (May 2014) rising to 67% of women. Sources: Mintel and Atlanta black star\n\n5. Creating value, growing together 1. Market Data 2. Consumer Data 3. Ethnic Hair Types and Routines 4. Product Examples Ethnic Hair Care market Trends & Formulation Solutions\n\n6. 6 • In the Black haircare category, styling products saw the greatest gain of 26.8% between 2013 and 2015 (est.) – in contrast to stagnant hair styling sales in the overall US haircare market. • There was an 18.6% fall for relaxer sales, an 18.3% increase for shampoo, a 9.8% increase for conditioner and a 1.6% increase for home hair colour. • The fashion for more natural afro hairstyles (vs. straight / relaxed) is arguably driving sales of styling products as a natural look for curly/afro hair often requires consumers to add a few more products to their daily routine. Targeting Black consumers: US styling product sales rise by biggest share Source: Mintel Reports, Black Consumers and Haircare - US - August 2015 Madam C.J. Walker Beauty Culture Frizz Fighting Coconut & Moringa Oils 26.8% Styling products increased 18.6% Relaxers sales fell Africa’s Best\n\n7. 7 • Consistent with their high engagement in the haircare category, Black haircare users report above-average interest in many new products such as scalp treatments (69%), lightweight hair oils (63%) and hair fragrance (56%).
