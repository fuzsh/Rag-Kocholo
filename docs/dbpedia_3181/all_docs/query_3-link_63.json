        "text": "I took my children to spend Children's Day on the weekend. I randomly searched for this recommendation. After looking at the price and comments, I thought it was pretty good. I booked early, and the package price also included [Tangquan Package] Langyue Tangquan 2 adults and 1 child unlimited entry and exit. After a while, I wanted to meet up with my friends, but the room rate did not include the hot spring. It was really a good deal! The location is not far away and very convenient. It is just in Houshayu, not far from Huanggang Station on the Beijing-Chengde Expressway. It is all avenues and not alleys, so navigation is very easy. The parking lot is super large and there are charging piles. Check in on time at 2 pm, no need to wait. Here I want to say that the front desk will call one day in advance to confirm special needs. Because we are traveling with the elderly and children, I need a room not far from the elevator, and I want a garden view instead of a sunny side. All are met, which is more considerate. Although there are many weddings, meetings and team building on weekends, they are separate from individual guests to check in and check out, which is very satisfactory! The breakfast restaurant is in the middle of the first floor. Although there are many people, there is no waiting! Although the dishes are not very rich, they have everything they should have. The hot pot portion is not small. Moreover, this is the only hotel we have stayed in, and we don't have to wait for pancakes. Hoho~ Next to the restaurant is a cafe. The latte is 32 yuan, which is a reasonable price. It's just that the staff may be in the breakfast room in the morning, and there is no one waiting for a long time... The guest room is quite satisfactory and clean. Fruits and foot bath buckets are also provided. Check-out is delayed until 2 pm the next day. I like this kind of unhurried. I went to the hot spring on the first day. It was okay. Except in summer, it really can't be 40 degrees. The big pool is 35 degrees and the children played for a long time. There are also several small pools for milk bath and medicinal bath, and there are fruit tea and rest areas. There is no need to fight for slippers here. Although the place is not big and there is no water slide, it is better because there are not many people. The water quality does not have such a strong smell of disinfectant water. The ground is clean, there are many showers, and if it is inconvenient to change swimsuits, you can also ask for a set of massage clothes. When you go out, you can also give the child a car, unlimited entry and exit, which is worth recommending! The next day, I slipped the entire hotel garden area, which is not big or small. There are three lawn wedding venues, villas and small buildings with national styles, and courtyards. Next to the main building, there is a non-powered amusement park and cute pet park suitable for children. It seems to be paid separately. My children are older, so we didn't go there. Anyway, it is a good place for taking children out for a walk and the elderly for a leisurely stroll. In terms of cost-effectiveness, it is worth coming.\n\n- Luyiji\n\nThe service of the housekeeping department is too bad. I stayed for two nights. On the first day, I got up and went out to do something. When I came back at 10 o'clock in the evening, the room was not cleaned. I called to inform them to clean the room and they arrived 10 minutes later. It was very unexpected. I have never encountered such a situation. When I called, they kept calling me Mr. Pang. I told the waiter that I was Ms. Pang. As a result, they sent me a card on Children's Day, and it still said Happy Holidays to Mr. Pang. They didn't even know whether the guest was male or female. They were too careless. When I checked in on the first day, it was 12:30 noon. There was no welcome fruit in the room. I remember that there was fruit when I booked the room. I called the service desk, and after two hours, it was still not delivered at 2:30 in the afternoon. I called again and it was delivered 10 minutes later. For such an expensive hotel, this service is really not worth it. I will not stay there next time.\n\n- Yongxiaojie\n\nMy family is celebrating their birthday on the weekend. Thinking about it, I almost live in the suburbs of Beijing. After three years of epidemic, there is really no place to stay in a hotel in the suburbs of Beijing. This time I chose Wangfujing Oriental Mandarin MO in Beijing. Let me talk about the location first. Although I have lived in Beijing for decades and have never stayed in Wangfujing, I can clearly see landmarks such as the Great Hall of the People and the Forbidden City from the hotel this year. The hotel is convenient for going to Tiananmen Square to watch the flag-raising or the Forbidden City and Wangfujing Commercial Street. It is suitable for family travel without wasting time and energy. The hotel is just above Wangfu Central, which is convenient for shopping and eating. Opposite is Hamlet, the largest toy store in Beijing, and Wangfujing Commercial Street. Service: After checking in at the hotel, a handsome man led us into the room and introduced the hotel facilities. Since it was a birthday, the hotel also upgraded the room type for free. I heard that the children had a habit of napping in the afternoon and arranged a late check-out for us. The service cannot be said enough. Especially the professional and warm service provided by the front desk butler Alex Nana Jeff Lenny. Eat: The hotel’s steakhouse serves Western food and brunch. The Chinese food in the hotel is a Chinese restaurant called Zishan. We had a meal and the dishes were not to mention. The breakfast was semi-buffet and it was also at Zishan. The second MO in Beijing is about to open. It has a courtyard theme right at the front door. I look forward to experiencing it next time.\n\n- Guest User\n\nI seldom write reviews, but I read a lot of guest reviews before I went, which helped me a lot, so I also commented. The first five pictures are of King Bed Room with Garden View. The Yongcui yard is paved with stones and is relatively quiet. There is a delicate pine tree and a few small shrubs with red fruits and green leaves, which are rare in this season. The silk embroidered bedside background wall is said to be embroidered by Chuanxiu's surviving masters. There is a wooden window in the indoor spring, and the small courtyard is outside the window with a stick, and the courtyard is very private. The last five are Hancui garden view rooms, the yard is covered with wooden floors, and there is a circular outdoor hot spring, which is my favorite. I soaked in it in the afternoon to see the white clouds in the afternoon, and bravely soaked in it for a while in the evening. Xing Xing, in fact, it is not cold to soak in. The moment you come out, you can wrap your bathrobe and rush into the room. After all, it is only five or six steps away. The hot spring is surrounded by evergreen shrubs, and there is a small tree next to it, like a cherry or a crabapple. If you come to soak in spring when the flowers are blooming, how beautiful it is! A row of bamboo next to it. The bedroom is slightly small, so the shower and indoor soaking pool are made open, and the design is reasonable and stylish. Overall value for money, the hotel hardware scored 100 points. Let’s score 80 points for the service. There may be a lot of people during the Spring Festival. The overall service is passable, but the waiters in the lobby can score more than 90 points. Except for breakfast, the Chinese restaurant can score 90 points. There are not many dishes, but they are more exquisite, the fruits are very fresh, and the service is also very good. The dinner failed for me. I didn’t eat the set meal. The yellow croaker I ordered was bland and slightly bitter. In addition, there are too few dining options, and the contrast between living here and then driving to Tanzhe Temple to eat farm food is too great, and the hotel's dining is generally unqualified. Also, although it is stated that no extra bed is allowed in the two room types, they can be added, but the extra bed is a sofa bed, which is soft. In addition, the pillows are too soft, it is strongly recommended to choose soft and hard pillows. Of course, it would be better if the mattress can also be soft or hard. It is estimated that it is a luxury. That's all for writing, the evaluation is detailed enough, and I look forward to improving the food and pillows. If it can be improved, it will go again.\n\n- Guest User\n\nOriginally, the Spring Festival reservation was postponed, and I felt that the service attitude was not good in the phone communication. I set off with resentment and wanted to give a bad review. I didn't expect that it was pretty good after I went there, and I can give it a good review. Facilities: very new. The cinema is a bit tasteless not the latest movies. The water bar in the room is very sufficient and I like it very much. Slippers, cotton slippers + woven flip flops are quite considerate. The washing utensils are diptyque and smell very good Hygiene: clean Environment: fresh and elegant Japanese style The only food to eat is Xinrongfu. If you go several times a year, you will have less choices. Service: Very friendly and different from what I heard on the phone. When I finally left, there was a lot of snow on the car all night, and the staff even helped sweep the snow on the car. I was very touched. Due to the reservation of 7,700 yuan + one night during the Spring Festival, I will definitely come again when the peak is 5, 6,000 +\n\n- LAN\n\nAlways wanted to experience Aman Beijing, finally booked a one night stay. Upon arrival, Jason at the front desk was very helpful and patient in explaining various items and was pleasantly surprised to hear my room had been upgraded. The property and the room are just like the photos but actually physically being there and seeing all the details of the architecture, courtyards, and surrounding nature and birds is like being transported back in time to another era. In this sense, Aman Beijing accomplishes what no other modern five-star luxury hotel can come close to achieving - making one feel a certain emotion or feeling that they've never felt, or perhaps only experienced in their dreams. Everything from the furniture to the layout to the art to the lighting is so tastefully executed and done, the courtyards and grounds are kept immaculate (saw people sweeping away leaves), they even have the older style bicycles available to ride there. Ate at the Chinese restaurant twice, the environment and lighting is so nice, their dumplings are excellent and also really enjoyed some of their soups and vegetable offerings, very delicious. Unfortunately, I was quite sick that day and also had injured my knee the day before. One of the staff at the front desk noticed my limp and asked if I was okay. I told her I was fine, just a little sprain. She went to the back and brought out a traditional Chinese 'Ban Lan Gen' pain relief spray can which she kindly gave to me, saying I could use it and take it with me, very touched. I think it is moments like these which one will remember many years later. All the staff I met there were very kind, during lunch was fortunate enough to meet Ivy, the F&B Manager who was very warm and hospitable. Then during dinner, after I saw down, a restaurant staff asked if I would like an ice pack for my leg, I asked her if she thought it would help and she replied, ”Yes.” They proceeded to bring out a huge ice pack that was able to wrap around my entire knee, providing instant relief. Finally, when it was time to leave, the very lovely and kind Lucy asked if I would like more ice packs to be sent to my room so I could ice my knee before retiring for the night. Even though I was not feeling well, it was an unforgettable experience due in large part to the kind and wonderful staff there.\n\n- Guest User\n\nDuring the May Day holiday, we chose to stay in the suburbs of Beijing to avoid the hustle and bustle of tourist attractions during the holiday, relax our bodies and minds, and recharge our lives. Yanbai Villa is the architectural work of ”Wang Shu”, and it is also an architectural art that we can feel up close. After resting, we can also get a little bit of artistic immersion, so why not? The hotel did not disappoint us. It is located on the bank of Yanxi Lake in Huairou, and the air is moist and fresh. The hotel's housekeeper Xie Lijuan opened the arms of the villa with a sweet smile and a soft voice to welcome our arrival. In the next two days, Sunny always used restrained and thoughtful service to help us adapt to every facility of the hotel and make us feel at home. Not only that, every employee of the hotel knows us, and there is no need to make repeated self-introductions. Just simply explain the needs, and they can quickly match them. The exterior facade of the villa continues to adopt Wang Shu's consistent concept, using a large number of collected old bricks and tiles, and splicing them with dark blue glazed bricks in ”A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains” and ”Four Scenery Landscapes”. The furnishings and household items in the room are also consistent and of the same style. Pay attention to details, worship the mountains and nature, and be simple but guarantee taste. After checking in, the room will be given a fruit plate, desserts, and red wine. The toiletries are all Bulgari, and the color of the toiletries is of course the iconic ”only green”. Our trip to the hotel ended with tea tasting in the ”tea room”. Sister ”Ma Yu” is a professional lover of tea culture. She popularized the etiquette of tea tasting, the classification of Chinese tea, the historical origins of tea culture, and the benefits of drinking tea to the body for the children, as well as the influence of Chinese Song Dynasty tea culture on Japanese tea culture. I think a small seed was planted in the children's minds. Of course, to understand Chinese traditional culture, we can't avoid the phenomenal TV series ”Knowing” and ”Dream of Hualu”. Sister Ma Yu also talked about it at will and had a great time. The hotel's breakfast is delicious, and the ”raspberry Danish roll” is especially praised. It is fresh and crispy, with a fresh and rich taste. The hotel's doorman service is absolutely enthusiastic, and the greetings and timely service at the door make us feel warm in our hearts. If you are tired, you can come here to see the mountains and water and take a short rest. I think it will be very satisfying.\n\n- Guest User\n\nOverall evaluation: five-star facilities, six-star design, seven-star service! Facilities: The location and facilities are fully in line with the five-star standard Hygiene: The sanitation is very good, and the hotel and the room are clean everywhere Environment: Enjoy the beautiful scenery of Yanqi Lake, the location and environment are first-class Service: The housekeeper [Zhang Juan] is very considerate, busy for two days, a real 24-hour housekeeper service! Because it is a family trip with children, the housekeeper also took the initiative to make an appoin**ent for children's handicraft entertainment, and carefully explained every detail and allusion of the hotel. If the full score is 100 points, I would like to give the housekeeper Comrade Zhang Juan 100,000 points! I have stayed in many five-star hotels, and the level of Yanbai is absolutely top-notch! Every staff member can understand your needs in time and is polite, especially the tea art level of the young lady in the s tea room is very high! It is worth experiencing tea art! VIP welcome gift: Red wine and fruit snacks are given, which are very rich, and you can eat and take them! Super cost-effective! All in all, this is a hotel that is very worthwhile to experience. The most surprising thing is the butler service. Thanks again to Zhang Juan. Next time, I will definitely bring my family here again and recommend it to relatives and friends!\n\n- Guest User\n\nI spent a very pleasant weekend with my friends in Anyu, thanking the beautiful boss for his warm hospitality. I specially ordered roasted whole lamb under the recommendation before. The boss will arrange it in advance. There is no need to worry about it. The master is also roasted with slow charcoal outside the door for more than 5 hours. The taste is much better than what x wood x sheep, xx bouillon. Speaking of the rooms, the decoration style of the five rooms is simple and generous, but without losing the sense of high-end, the rooms and items are very new, and the bathroom appliances are also big names. There is no problem with more than 10 people living here. In addition, the living room and entertainment room are empty two floors, and the guest room is separated by two small buildings. All kinds of facilities are also very complete. You can sing, play mahjong, play arcade games, etc. here. We did not bring children, and we can also play very relaxed. The outdoor courtyard environment is also good, the small swimming pool is still cold, so I have not experienced it. The boss is obviously a very emotional person. She is also very careful to take care of this homestay, which makes everyone feel very comfortable. Anyu is very suitable for family or friends to travel together. I will highly recommend it to other friends. Thank you for the warm hospitality and care of the boss. We will visit again if we have the opportunity!\n\n- Guest User"
