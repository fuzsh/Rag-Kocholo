        "text": "(Alliance News) - Eluned Morgan has been sworn in as the new First Minister of Wales, the third leader of the country this year.\n\nShe succeeds Vaughan Gething, who lasted less than 140 days as first minister, having presided over a turbulent period in office, beset by rows over donations and sacked ministers.\n\nMorgan, 57, was confirmed as leader of the Welsh Labour Party on July 24, but could not take over as first minister without a vote in the Senedd.\n\nThe Welsh Parliament, which would normally be on summer break, was recalled on Tuesday to allow Morgan, the health minister, to take over as leader of the Welsh government.\n\nShe becomes the the first woman to lead the country.\n\nShe had the support of the Labour members of the Senedd while Plaid Cymru and the Conservatives voted for their respective party leaders.\n\nJane Dodds, the sole Liberal Democrat, abstained from endorsing a candidate, despite having supported Gething earlier this year.\n\nThe opposition parties putting forward alternative choices was largely symbolic, with neither having enough votes to secure the role.\n\nMorgan is the first woman to lead the Welsh government in its 25-year history, something she has said she is extremely proud of.\n\nShe is also the third leader of Welsh Labour this year, after a difficult few months since Gething took over from Mark Drakeford in March.\n\nGething announced his intention to resign last month after four members of his government quit, criticising his leadership.\n\nDuring the last leadership race, Gething took a GBP200,000 donation for his campaign from a company owned by a man twice convicted of environmental offences, which led to some members of his own party criticising his judgment.\n\nIn June, Gething lost a vote of no confidence in the Senedd, after rows over the donation, and his decision to sack Delyn MS Hannah Blythyn as a minister.\n\nMorgan ran on a \"unity ticket\", promising to bring the Labour group back together.\n\nBy George Thompson and David Lynch\n\nPress Association: News\n\nsource: PA\n\nCopyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.
