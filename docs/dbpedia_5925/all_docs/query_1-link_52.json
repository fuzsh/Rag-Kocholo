        "text": "The Welsh Government and Plaid Cymru have created a Co-operation Agreement, to tackle some of the big issues facing the country.\n\nFor housing, the agreement sees the creation of a new national construction company called Unnos.\n\nThe idea is that it will “support councils and social landlords to improve the supply of social and affordable housing.”\n\nThe agreement also looks to “significantly reform the current system of building safety” and will introduce the second phase of the Welsh Building Safety Fund.\n\nAnd much like in England, the two parties involved in the agreement, Labour and Plaid Cymru, will produce a White Paper to make renting fairer.\n\nThe document will “include proposals for a right to adequate housing, the role a system of fair rents (rent control) could have in making the private rental market affordable for local people on local incomes and new approaches to making homes affordable.”\n\nThere is also to be a focus on second homes in the country, with the agreement promising “immediate and radical action to address the proliferation of second homes and unaffordable housing, using the planning, property and taxation systems.”\n\nActions being planned include a cap on the number of second and holiday homes; measures to bring more homes into common ownership; a statutory licensing scheme for holiday lets; greater powers for local authorities to charge council tax premiums and increasing taxes on second homes.\n\nThey are also aiming to end homelessness.\n\n“If people are made homeless it should be brief, rare and unrepeated.,” the agreement says.\n\n“We will reform housing law, enact the Renting Homes Act to give renters greater security and implement the Homeless Action Group recommendations.”\n\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said: “The Welsh Government has an ambitious Programme for Government, which it will deliver over this Senedd term. But we do not have a monopoly on good ideas and we will work with progressive parties where we have shared and common interests to benefit people in Wales.\n\n“This Co-operation Agreement brings the Welsh Government and Plaid Cymru together to respond to some of the most pressing issues facing Wales today, such as climate change and the energy and cost-of-living crisis.\n\n“We can achieve more for people in Wales by working together and the Co-operation Agreement is both a response to the external challenges we face and a chance to build on the opportunities in our future. It will also help us secure a stable Senedd over the next three years, capable of delivering radical change and reform.\n\n“These commitments build on our shared values of social solidarity, a sustainable planet and a vibrant democracy.”\n\nAdam Price, Leader of Plaid Cymru said: “Almost a quarter of a century ago, people in Wales voted for self-government for Wales, with a promise of a new type of politics.\n\n“They placed their trust in a new democracy with an instruction to work differently – inclusively and co-operatively.\n\n“The challenges we face require real ambition to deliver radical ideas. The fallout from leaving the European Union, the legacy of the pandemic, and the UK Government’s determination to erode the Senedd’s powers all increase the need for transformational change.\n\n“Taken together, the bold policy pledges will unite Wales and benefit every generation, from all primary school pupils receiving free school meals to a national care service, free at the point of need.\n\n“I am pleased this pioneering Co-operation Agreement is founded on common ground on a range of issues that will make a long-lasting difference to people’s lives.”"
