        "text": "On the 1st of November 1982 Sianel Pedwar Cymru more widely recognized as S4C started broadcasting. S4C was the first television channel of its kind as it was specifically aimed at a Welsh-speaking audience and its creation was a key moment for Welsh nationalism and the preservation of the Welsh language.\n\nA Welsh language dedicated channel was seen by some as the best way to further promote the Welsh language and improve its programming. Up until the creation of S4C Welsh language programming had been showcased on the BBC and HTV with around twelve to fifteen hours being produced weekly.\n\nThe period before its inception was tumultuous to say the least with protests, broken promises and numerous political debates all being key components to its eventual creation. Previous plans to create the channel had also been postponed due to money concerns which were rife during the late 1970’s amidst the financial crisis.\n\nThe background\n\nBefore the eventual creation of S4C some members of Welsh society had been actively promoting the Welsh language and in particular stressing the importance of Welsh-language media. The Welsh language society also known as Cymdeithas was officially founded on the 4th of August 1962.\n\nTheir first campaigns focussed on guaranteeing the official status of the language where they called for Welsh-language tax returns, schools and birth certificates amongst other things. The group believe in direct action and as a result over a thousand members have appeared in court relating to their protests. Subsequently in terms of arrests and fines they are the largest British protest group since the suffragettes.\n\nBy the 1970’s the group began protesting for the creation of Welsh-language radio and television stations. Radio Cymru began broadcasting on the 3rd of January 1977 but after the failures of government to implement a television channel for Welsh-speakers Cymdeithas turned their attentions to pressuring for what would eventually become S4C. A number of protesters refused to buy television licenses and some even climbed up television masts and illegally entered television studios.\n\nAt the time of these protests an important debate was underway on the level of power that Wales should have on its own governance. The Wales act of 1978 set up the terms for a Welsh referendum on devolution which was to take place on March the 1st 1979. The yes campaign subsequently only achieved 20.3% of the vote and this was seen as a huge failure for Welsh nationalism.\n\nThe reasons for the resulting vote against devolved power can be attributed to a number of things. Some like Dafydd Wigley MP (Plaid Cymru) believed there was a lack of strong leadership from the nationalists and that they were unsure and nervous at one of the most important milestones in Welsh history. [1] The majority of the press also decided to side with the no campaign due to them being based in London and this further added to the confusion felt amongst the general public.\n\nOverall this election was seen as a huge statement by the Welsh public that they wanted to remain a part of Great Britain to the dismay of separatists. The result of 1979 however galvanized the Welsh nationalists and encouraged them to take more substantial action in other facets of Welsh life.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nGwynfor Evans\n\nGwynfor Evans was a leading Plaid Cymru politician who was president of the party for thirty six years and was the first Member of Parliament to represent Plaid Cymru at Westminster. The guardian once wrote that Evans ‘probably owed his success in politics to the fact that, by today’s standards, he was not much of a politician. He would not trim or fix or deal, and, above all, he would not give up’. [2]\n\nEvans saw the 1979 referendum as a huge failure on his part and his party were faced with a period of uncertainty. The new perceived threat to the Welsh language soon became his main focus after HTV and the BBC expressed doubts over the viability of a Welsh-language fourth channel. Gwynfor had felt that he had given his all to his country and failed and subsequently he took to drastic measures in order to succeed.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIn the lead up to the 1979 general election both the conservative and labour parties made a Welsh-language fourth channel a part of their manifestos perhaps as a way of smoothing over relations with those who wanted devolved powers. This statement was reiterated by the conservatives after their victory but then suddenly they changed their minds. The home secretary attributed this to the low number of Welsh speakers in comparison to the cost of creating a special channel.\n\nDirectly after the announcement made by William Whitelaw, Evans delivered a speech in Ystrad Mynach stating that Plaid Cymru would have to return to ‘other than conventional means’ in order to push for the channel. [3] The channel itself was not Evans’ main concern as this was more about personal and political considerations than the future of Welsh television however this was a galvanizing moment for the politician and his party.\n\nDuring the spring of 1980 Gwynfor Evans decided to fast and keep this up until the conservatives agreed to honour the pledge they made during their manifesto. Very few people doubted Evans as he was seen as someone who would do anything for his country of birth and Pennar Davies believed his death would be the responsibility of the government and that he would be seen as a soldier on the battlefield.\n\nThe threat of violence that Gwynfor Evans death could have caused alongside mounting pressure from those in support meant that instead of a U-turn the government had now come full circle.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nOpposition\n\nThe government had its own opposition to the creation of S4C due to money concerns however their view was not the only one that disagreed with the idea of a Welsh-language fourth channel. Several other groups and individuals voiced their concerns including not just English but also Welsh speakers.\n\nEnglish speakers had previously spoken of their annoyance regarding Welsh speaking programmes appearing on the BBC and HTV however this subsided during the 1970’s as remote controls and channel buttons rather than dials receded this problem somewhat. People were now channel hopping and were less aware of the programmes they were missing when the Welsh programs were being broadcast. However this did not fully subside and even some Welsh speakers complained about missing their favourite shows.\n\nSome of the higher standing officials at HTV Wales and BBC Wales even opposed the plans as any changes to programming and the addition of a new channel would be costly for all parties involved. On a much smaller scale the Annan Committee representatives argued that the establishment of the channel constituted an unnecessary expense which shows that it was not only those in charge of the money who believed the costs outweighed the benefits.\n\nAneirin Talfan Davies argued in 1972 that a separate channel could establish a ‘Patagonian wilderness’ that would fail to attract new viewers. Davies believed a Welsh-language channel should be a public service one and also have some English broadcasting that involved Wales in some way. [4]\n\nWelsh-speaking officials in the Welsh office also discussed a similar point as they feared a separate channel would ghettoize the language. The new channel in their mind would gain attention from those already committed to the language but would fail to capture the imagination of those who are perhaps not as engaged with the language in the first place. Welsh-language newspapers also supported this argument with Y Faner believing the English-speaking Welsh population would now have less contact with the language.\n\nLegacy and identity\n\nDespite the initial worries once the S4C was broadcasting the issues surrounding the channel were almost universally put to rest. The difficulties that did arise were administrative, for instance in determining the precise demarcation between news gathering (BBC) and current affairs (HTV).\n\nThe general consensus was now that a separate service for Welsh speakers was the most suitable means by which Welsh-speakers could attain a full peak-time service. By 1985 a review of operations had showcased that the channel had established itself so successfully that its abandonment was no longer a serious proposition. In 1988 the broadcasting white paper reiterated this point but further explained that the channel had succeeded in producing a high-quality service for a comparatively small audience and there is substantial potential for further developments. [5]\n\nS4C has now become synonymous with the preservation of the Welsh language due to the recent resurgence in the number of Welsh speakers. During a speech in May 2014 MP Glyn Davies stresses that ‘S4C is inextricably linked to the language and Welsh identity. More than anything else, it is the Welsh language that makes Wales special’. [6] The establishment of S4C invigorated the Welsh language and has had a profound effect on Welsh identity in the modern day.\n\n[1] Martin Johnes, Wales since 1939, (Manchester University Press, 2012), p.296\n\n[2] https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/22/broadcasting.welshassembly – [Accessed 19/03/2018]\n\n[3] Rhys Evans, Gwynfor: Portrait of a Patriot (Y Lolfa, 2008), p.401\n\n[4] Robert Smith, Broadcasting and the Welsh Language in Mari Williams and Geraint Jenkins Let’s Do Our Best for the Ancient Tongue : The Welsh Language in the Twentieth Century (University of Wales, 2000) p.321\n\n[5] Ibid, p.322\n\n[6] https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2014-05-07/debates/14050750000001/S4CAndWelshIdentity – [Accessed 20/03/2018]\n\nFor further reading on this topic see…\n\nMartin Johnes, Wales since 1939, (Manchester University Press, 2012).\n\nRhys Evans, Gwynfor: Portrait of a Patriot (Y Lolfa, 2008).\n\nRobert Smith, Broadcasting and the Welsh Language in Mari Williams and Geraint Jenkins Let’s Do Our Best for the Ancient Tongue : The Welsh Language in the Twentieth Century (University of Wales, 2000).\n\nhttps://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/history-of-s4c-2117714\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-wales-12062288\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/22/broadcasting.welshassembly\n\nhttps://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2014-05-07/debates/14050750000001/S4CAndWelshIdentity"
