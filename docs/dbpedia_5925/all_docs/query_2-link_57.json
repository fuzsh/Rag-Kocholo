Become a member today\n\nPlaid Cymru has officially launched its UK General Election campaign in the re-drawn Caerphilly constituency.\n\nCouncillor Lindsay Whittle, who is standing in his tenth Westminster election, unveiled his campaign in Ynysddu on Thursday April 11.\n\nFollowing the re-drawing of constituency boundaries, which sees the number of parliamentary seats in Wales drop from 40 to 32, Ynysddu has moved from the Islwyn constituency into Caerphilly.\n\nCouncillor Lindsay Whittle, who represents the Penyrheol, Trecenydd and Energlyn ward, is his party’s group leader on Caerphilly County Borough Council.\n\nNo date has yet been set for the next general election, but it must be held by January 2025 at the latest.\n\nDespite never being elected to Parliament, Cllr Whittle was elected to the Senedd (then called Welsh Assembly) in 2011, where he represented the South Wales East region for five years.\n\nA councillor for 47 years, Cllr Whittle has served as council leader twice, with his first spell in charge between 1999 and 2004 and his second spell between 2008 and 2011.\n\nAhead of his campaign launch at Ynysddu Rugby Club, Cllr Whittle said: “With four new wards joining the Caerphilly constituency for this Parliamentary election, I thought it was important to hold my launch in the area.\n\n“Of course, I’m very familiar with the old Caerphilly Constituency as I’ve grown up in the area, lived and worked there and stood for election many times. But I’m looking forward to launching my campaign in a new area at the local rugby club in Ynysddu – which seems an ideal venue as a lover of rugby.\n\n“Caerphilly is where I belong and I want everyone to feel this sense of belonging because Wales is a community of communities.”\n\nHe spoke of national issues such as the cost-of-living crisis, the NHS, and climate, and hit out at the of the ruling Labour group on Caerphilly Council, as well as the Labour-run Welsh Government.\n\n“Rather than accepting the status quo, I urge electors to vote for change,” he said.\n\n“People say that all politicians are the same. After my decades of service on local authorities, I’ve proved that is not the case. Public service has always been my top priority.”\n\nCllr Whittle’s campaign has been endorsed by Delyth Jewell, the Plaid Cymru Senedd Member for South Wales East.\n\nMs Jewell said: “Lindsay is a fantastic advocate for this area, and has worked tirelessly over many decades to fight for the people who live here.\n\n“I know he will put his heart into the campaign, and will be steadfast in demanding better for our community.\n\n“The people of Caerphilly have a chance here to elect someone who will always fight for their corner. He would be a unique, strong and passionate voice for Caerphilly in Westminster.”\n\nCaerphilly’s incumbent MP, Labour’s Wayne David, will be standing down at the next election after 23 years of service. Current Islwyn MP Chris Evans has been chosen as Labour’s candidate for the Caerphilly seat.\n\nSign-up to our daily newsletter\n\nPlaid Cymru"
