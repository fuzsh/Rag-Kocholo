        "text": "It’s been 25 years since devolution began and self-government returned to Wales. Devolution started with the Welsh Assembly and developed into Wales having its own national parliament, which will be comparable in scale to those of similar-sized countries from 2026 onwards, when it expands to 96 members. Wales took an important step on the road to becoming a sovereign state.\n\nThat goal is one of the reasons Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925. But the party’s aims have evolved: the focus was on the Welsh language at first, more so than home rule. Many associate Plaid Cymru with the independence movement, but it was long ambivalent on the issue, and campaigned for the UK to leave the Common Market in 1975. By 2014 the party’s constitution included the aim of securing Welsh independence via a referendum, and it now wants a free Wales to rejoin the EU. Yet its longstanding ambivalence still casts shadows.\n\nTime to make the case\n\nPlaid Cymru needs to move on from seeking interim devolution of more powers and frame its message strongly around the benefits of independence – how Wales can improve by being an independent state. This should be its particular campaign focus at Westminster level.\n\nWith Labour likely to be voted into power in Westminster by this time next year, the chances of more devolution seem low. UK Labour has set out no plans for any significant devolution to Wales, despite its Welsh branch wanting justice and policing devolved. So Plaid’s focus now needs to be on demanding more, not less.\n\nThe party should put out the message that independence can bring people better healthcare, education, housing, policing, transport, and a stronger and greener economy. A society in which the people of Wales know the state will look after them in times of need, and a fairer and more ambitious Wales for all.\n\nNo more begging bowls\n\nThis should include comparisons with and positive examples from similar-sized countries that are already independent. It should highlight the desirable policies a government could implement but which devolution stops Wales from pursuing.\n\nFor this approach, Plaid needs to change its messaging. No more demanding funds from Westminster that are just not going to be given.\n\nPlaid Cymru should instead use that time and energy to show the people of Wales how independence can make their lives better in the areas that are important to their daily lives. And that will include devolved areas where Westminster control still has an effect, mostly due to a lack of fiscal powers, which can be rectified upon independence.\n\nEssentially, the message needs to be that Westminster doesn’t work for the people of Wales but that an independent Wales can. It’s the unvarnished truth, after all.\n\nDevolution 25 years from now\n\nOver the next 25 years, Wales needs to complete its journey to becoming an independent country, then begin a new journey as an independent nation state. And the Plaid Cymru party can switch its focus to Wales joining the EU and other partnerships.\n\nThe longer devolution stays in place, the more it needs to be seen as a failure – a failure to achieve the party’s stated goal of independence for Wales. The campaign for and journey to independence isn’t going to happen overnight and will require patience, but it needs to be worked towards nonetheless.\n\nThat begins with the main political party that supports independence putting its ambivalence firmly behind it – vanishing its past shadows by shining a light on the path forwards. YesCymru as a campaign group can only do so much; with the level of support for independence in the polls at around 30%, the movement needs its biggest political party to start campaigning more seriously. To stand for an independent Wales, convincing the more sceptical voters that independence promises a better future than the one Westminster is offering.\n\nIf Wales is going to achieve independence, rather than be celebrating weak, piecemeal devolution again 25 years from now, it needs Plaid Cymru to pull out the stops and step out of the shadows. To stop fearing the ‘independence’ word and start putting out its clear, detailed vision for an independent Wales."
