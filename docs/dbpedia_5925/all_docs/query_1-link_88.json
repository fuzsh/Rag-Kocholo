The group, some of whom had previously been members of the Labour Party aimed to build a base in industrial south east Wales by focusing on socialism and republicanism rather than on rural affairs, pacifism and the Welsh language.\n\nIn 1950, the group began publishing a newspaper, The Welsh Republican – Y Gweriniaethwr. It stood Ithel Davies in Ogmore in the 1950 UK general election, but he took only 1.3% of the vote.\n\nSome members of the party were arrested for burning the Union Jack, and it faced accusations of initiating violence. They also conceived a Welsh republican flag, a tricolor with green, white and red bands.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, most members of the Movement had either returned to Plaid Cymru or joined the Labour Party, and its newspaper ceased publication in 1957.\n\nWhy the Welsh voice is so musical\n\nLittle wonder that Wales is known as the land of song, as a language expert has found the accent really is musical.\n\nThe musical tones of the likes of Oscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins clearly demonstrated that melody, according to academic Rod Walters.\n\nHe found that a stereotypical Welsh accent is set apart from others in the UK by how its pitch changes.\n\nHe decided on the study after returning from abroad to the University of Glamorgan, south Wales.\n\nAfter research in Rhondda workingmen’s clubs, Dr Walters found that Welsh accents were rightly described as musical. After research in Rhondda workingmen’s clubs, Dr Walters found that Welsh accents were rightly described as musical.\n\nThe study found the main influences on the Rhondda accent included the Welsh language and some English dialects.\n\n“A Welsh accent is instantly recognisable, but there has been little research into identifying what are the actual sounds and cadences that make it so,” said Dr Walters, who is also a musician.\n\n“Its melody can be clearly heard, albeit in a refined form, in the speech of such newscasters as Huw Edwards, or the actors Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins.”\n\nDuring his research in the Rhondda valleys he interviewed 60 men in workingmen’s clubs in Treherbert, Maerdy and Porth.\n\n“As any mimic of a Welsh accent instinctively knows, its distinctiveness comes mainly from its intonation – the way a speaker’s pitch changes at stresses and at the ends of phrases,” Dr Walters said.\n\n“While there are other British Isles accents that have their own recognisable intonations, for example the Glasgow, Belfast, Birmingham and Liverpool accents, none of these are phonetically the same as Welsh accents.”\n\nListening to Welsh accents from across south Wales, Dr Walters found intonation patterns were similar, but with phonetic differences.\n\n“Cardiff is a little more gentle but the intonation in the valleys accent is more prominent,” he added.\n\nIn 2005, the BBC launched its Voices project, a UK-wide study of accents, including a look at how social history had affected the way of speaking..\n\n“While there are other British Isles accents that have their own recognisable intonations, for example the Glasgow, Belfast, Birmingham and Liverpool accents, none of these are phonetically the same as Welsh accents.”\n\nListening to Welsh accents from across south Wales, Dr Walters found intonation patterns were similar, but with phonetic differences.\n\n“Cardiff is a little more gentle but the intonation in the valleys accent is more prominent,” he added.\n\nIn 2005, the BBC launched its Voices project, a UK-wide study of accents, including a look at how social history had affected the way of speaking..\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/5056236.stm\n\nThe Lost Lands of Wales was a minor political idea of the mid 1960s regarding areas along the east side of the England–Wales border which its proponents considered to be Welsh. The idea was propounded by the Lost Lands Liberation League and included parts of the counties of Cheshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire. In general, placenames of Welsh origin are found to the west of the border, and those of English origin to the east. However, many historically Welsh names are also found east of the border, particularly around Oswestry in northern Shropshire, such as Gobowen; in southern Shropshire, such as Clun; and in southern Herefordshire, such as Kilpeck and Pontrilas. Most of these areas were not incorporated fully into England until the 16th century, and native Welsh speakers still lived there until at least the 19th century.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-34067126\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-33081308\n\nWelsh in Pennsylvania\n\nThe Welsh have had an impact upon Pennsylvania’s society and culture since the founding of the colony in 1681. Several waves of Welsh immigrants—gentry, farmers and, later, industrial workers—came to Pennsylvania and created several dense settlements in various sections of the Commonwealth. The Welsh were especially influential from 1682 to 1730 in shaping the political, economic and social development of the colony.\n\nThe Welsh are descendants of the ancient Britons. Their homeland, Wales (in Welsh, Cymru), is located in the southwestern part of the isle of Great Britain on a peninsula of around eight thousand square miles which thrusts westward from England into the Irish Sea. Originally a separate kingdom, Wales was united with England in 1536 through a parliamentary Act of Union.\n\nAlthough Wales was one of the first western nations to be heavily industrialized, its population stayed relatively small. Thus, in comparison to the larger homelands of other American ethnic groups, like Germany, Italy, and Poland, which sent massive waves of immigrants to the United States, Wales could never be the source of so great a number. Nonetheless, in Pennsylvania, particularly in the early colonial period, the Welsh were an important and influential ethnic group.\n\nFrom 1682 to 1700, the Welsh were the largest group immigrating to Pennsylvania. By 1700 they accounted for approximately one-third of the colony’s estimated population of twenty thousand. After 1700, Welsh immigration remained significant, yet slowly declined; it practically ceased after 1720, resuming in sizable numbers only in the early nineteenth century.\n\nhttp://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/groups/4286/welsh/471948\n\nWelsh Chileans are Chileans of Welsh descent whose family roots came from Wales. The Welsh did not settle in Chile. Generally were identified with the other British groups in Chile. In the Patagonia region, about 30,000 residents have Welsh surnames, descendants of Welsh settlers who may have crossed the once disputed Argentine border and established farms or ranches in the late 19th century.\n\nNotable Welsh Chileans"
