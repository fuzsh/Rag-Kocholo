        "text": "Plaid Cymru enters the 2015 General Election at a time when its sister party, the SNP, is enjoying unprecedented success - something Plaid wants to replicate in Wales.\n\nLed by Leanne Wood, the first female leader in the party's history, Plaid Cymru sees itself as a left wing party aiming at increasing economic prosperity and social justice, and securing an independent Wales.\n\nWith opinion polls suggesting only modest support for independence, much of Plaid's campaign will be focused on alternatives to austerity and a call for Wales to get the same level of spending on devolved services per head as Scotland - an extra Â£1.2bn a year.\n\nIt currently has three MPs, 11 members of the Welsh assembly and one member of the European Parliament.\n\nThe party was established in 1925, but it had to wait until 1966 for its first electoral breakthrough, when party president Gwynfor Evans won Carmarthen in a by-election.\n\nBut Plaid Cymru struggled to build substantially on that success and has never won more than four seats at Westminster.\n\nIts electoral fortunes improved after the narrow vote in favour of devolution in the 1997 referendum which led to the creation of the National Assembly for Wales.\n\nIn the first elections to the new body in 1999, Plaid won 17 of the 60 seats, with dramatic wins in Labour's traditional heartlands such as the south Wales valleys.\n\nDespite not hitting the same heights in subsequent elections, it entered government for the first time in 2007.\n\nA hung assembly meant a series of coalition talks - a joint programme had been agreed between Plaid, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, but Plaid eventually plumped for a coalition with Labour, the largest party."
