Source: Wikipedia\n\nFormed in 1925 as Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (English: National Party of Wales) in order to attempt to establish a Welsh government, the party's primary aim was to make the Welsh language the only official language of Wales.\n\nAt the 1929 general election Plaid Cymru contested Caernarvonshire, its first parliamentary constituency, where they won 1.6% of the vote (609 votes).\n\nThe following decades saw limited support, with many of the population seeing the party as an 'intellectual and socially conservative Welsh language pressure group'. However, in the 1950's president Gwynfor Evans turned the party's fortunes around, increasing its share of the vote from 0.7% in the 1951 general election to 3.1% in 1955, and 5.2% by 1959, whereupon they contested a majority of the available Welsh seats for the first time.\n\nPlaid Cymru contested every Welsh seat for the first time at the 1970 general election, and as a result the party saw their vote share increase substantially to 11.5% in 1966.\n\nThe party advocates an independent Wales within the European Union, with the goal of making Wales a EU member state, and aims to create a bilingual society that promotes the revival of the Welsh language.\n\nBrowse more information about the plaid cymru%%> party and read about their members, policies, or read news."
