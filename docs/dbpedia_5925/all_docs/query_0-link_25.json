They had faced discrimination in the US, yet became slave-owning plantation owners in North Carolina. Then they married sisters - Sarah and Adelaide Yates.\n\nIn this episode, Arion, Rebecca and Olly reveal the sexual side of the brothersâ relationship; explain how the ambiguity of their ethnicity enabled them to climb up through Southern society; and consider the merits of their âdeath castâ, now on display in a Philadelphia museum...\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nâ¢ âThe Death of Chang and Eng, Conjoined Twins Until the Lastâ (Atlas Obscura, 2013):\n\nhttps://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/morbid-monday-the-demise-of-chang-and-eng\n\nâ¢ âHow the original Siamese twins had 21 children by 2 sisters (Mail Online, 2014): https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2825888/How-original-Siamese-twins-21-children-two-sisters-sharing-one-reinforced-bed.html\n\nâ¢ âWorld Famous Conjoined Twins, Chang and Eng Bunkerâ (Ripleyâs Believe It Or Not!, 2017): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWXoPrGAQMk\n\nâWhy am I hearing a rerun?â\n\nEach Thursday and Friday we repeat stories from our archive of 800+ episodes, so we can maintain the quality of our independent podcast and bring you fresh, free content every Monday-Wednesdayâ¦Â\n\nâ¦ But ð´CLUB RETROSPECTORSð´members get an additional full-length episode each Sunday!

The Summer resort, on Yaphank, Long Island, was the epicentre of the German-American Bund: an organisation devoted to establishing a Nazi stronghold across the United States.Â\n\nAlongside campfire building and swimming lessons, young attendees were taught to emulate the Hitler Youth and host mini Nuremberg-style rallies.Â\n\nIn this episode, Arion, Rebecca and Olly explain how delegates were trained to anticipate a Nazi coup of the USA; consider why all the key players in the movement escaped serious criminal prosecution, even after the Second World War; and why events such as these were so casually reported, even in the New York Timesâ¦Â\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nâ¢ âNew York's 1930s Nazi Summer Campâ (Ripleyâs, 2016): https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/nazi-summer-camp/\n\nâ¢ âA New York Town in the 1930s Embraced Hitler and Nazi Germanyâ (History Collection, 2017): https://historycollection.com/welcome-hitler-street-usa-pending/\n\nâ¢ âNazis on Long Island: The Story of Camp Siegfriedâ (Museum of Jewish Heritage, 2022): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGJW1VQo1Ts\n\nâWhy am I hearing a rerun?â\n\nEach Thursday and Friday we repeat stories from our archive of 800+ episodes, so we can maintain the quality of our independent podcast and bring you fresh, free content every Monday-Wednesdayâ¦Â\n\nâ¦ But ð´CLUB RETROSPECTORSð´members get an additional full-length episode each Sunday!
