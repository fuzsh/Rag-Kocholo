        "text": "Whilst researching into plaid Cymru I realised that there was a lot of information to take in and to narrow down into either one infographic design or a series of infographics. I decided to look into a man named Kitchener Davies. Kitch was a man who believed in the welsh language many years ago, he was extraordinary with the work and passion that he carried out for the welsh language. This is something that I am also passionate about, being a fluent welsh speaker myself i understand the hardships and the successfulness of the welsh language in the past and present. I was actually a car member in an old school production called Kitch which was all about this man’s life story. I believe this is something that I might be able to use for research also as the show was recorded.\n\nJ. Kitchener Davies\n\nJames Kitchener Davies (16 June 1902 – 25 August 1952), also known as J. Kitchener Davies, was a Welsh poet and playwright who wrote mostly in the Welsh language. Davies’s work is highly influenced by the industrial landscape of his adopted village of Trealaw in the Rhondda Valley and his own nationalistic beliefs.\n\nBorn and brought up in Llangeitho in Ceredigion, Davies spent his working life in the newly industrialised coalfields of the Rhondda Valley. The sometimes bleak conditions of his early life, especially as his early adulthood coincided with the economic despair of the depression, is reflected in his plays. Davies was part of the Cadwgan Circle, a literary group of likeminded writers from Rhondda, that centred their image of Wales on the new industrialised society they were brought up in. Members of the Circle included Rhydwen Williams, Pennar Davies and Gareth Alban Davies.\n\nHis early play Cwm Glo (1934) was seen as controversial because it dealt with the social impact of the depression without the cultural romanticism which was stereotypical of Welsh literature. His verse play Meini Gwagedd (1944) is set in the Tregaron area and again looks at the harshness of the industrialised Wales and the self-destructive nature of people when drawn into a spiral of ill fortune.\n\nIn 1945, Davies stood in the United Kingdom general election, standing in the Rhondda East constituency as the first member of Plaid Cymru to contest the seat in the Rhondda Valleys. He came last out of three candidates, gaining 2,123 votes (6.1%). The next election, in 1950 he ran again, this time the Rhondda West constituency seat. He increased his vote to 6.6% and then improved this in the 1951 election when he polled slightly higher with 7.7% of the vote, again in the Rhondda West constituency.\n\nWhilst researching Kitch online I came to realise that his life story and his passion wasn’t out there, its not something that is shared. This give me more of a thrill and the want to create an infographic o his life story. I had to seek information about his life elsewhere. The show that I was involved on was all based on the information that we were given by his grand-daughter. I decided to watch the Dvd of the show and make notes.\n\nI originally made these notes in welsh as the dvd was in welsh then translated them into English , I decided that it would be a really good idea if I created an infographic in the else also to showcase his life as the welsh language was a passion of his and also one of my own.\n\nNotes :\n\n.originaly from Tregaron\n\n.sister named Tish ( Latisha)\n\n. Brother named Tomos\n\n. Mum died when he was young\n\n. Aunt Bodo from the Rhondda came to live with them whilst their dad worked in the mines in the Rhondda.\n\n. moved to the countryside\n\n. Went to the county school\n\n. J.T Lewis was his head master\n\n. Mr S M Powell was his class teacher\n\n. Enjoyed climbing\n\n. Poor family, they had to move to the Rhondda, Kitch was doing well in school but his dad feared that he’d also have to work in the mines to support the family. With the help of his teacher Mr Powell he stayed at the county school and finished his course.\n\n.joined Plaid Cymru\n\n. Moved to the Rhondda ahd became a welsh school teacher\n\n. Met his wife Mair Rhys who was also a welsh teacher but in tonypandy through members of the plaid\n\n. Wrote a drama with help of the other plaid members and supporters\n\n. Worked with plaid with elections and believed that plaid had the hearts to listen to the world\n\n. Became friends with another plaid member Mr Morris Williams\n\n. His drama “cwm Glo” was put on stage , was known as the sex play . Was considered to be played at the gate theatre London , headlines called it shocking\n\n. Had a daughter called Megan\n\n. Found out he had cancer\n\n. Still continued to work with plaid , worked on the 1945 election but unfortunately lost – made a statement “ takes more than one colour to make a rainbow”\n\n. Worked with plaid with the first welsh school to be opened in the valleys\n\n. On his way to work with plaid he took a turn for the worst on the Austin 7 and ended up in hospital\n\n. During this time a friend read his poem “swn y gwynt” on the bbc\n\n. Died of cancer with the hope for a future for the welsh language\n\nObviously not all of these were accurate as they were made to fit the play. I had checked this with the director and writer Richard Davies. I then decided to have a look At text books that I own about the welsh language and welsh heroes ,I had then found the accurate information that I could go from:\n\nDAVIES , JAMES KITCHENER ( 1902 – 1952 ), poet, dramatist and nationalist .\n\nBorn 16 June 1902 , son of Thomas Davies of Pant-glas , Blaencaron , and Martha (née Davies ) of Pantfallen , Tregaron, Cards. Their sons Thomas , John and James were born at Pantfallen ; about a year later the family moved to Llain , Llwynpïod , a smallholding on the edge of Cors Caron , where their daughter Letitia was born. James attended the church school at Tregaron . When he was seven years old his mother d., and he was sent to Banbury for a period (having lost his Welsh on his return). The children were raised at Llain by an aunt, Mary Davies . In 1915 he went to Tregaron county school where everyone called him Kitchener because his father, with his moustache, resembled the British politician of that name. The father, of strong build, worked in Garw colliery and returned to farm the land each spring, summer and Christmas time. In 1919 the smallholding had to be sold when he re-m. and made his home in Blaengarw , and the aunt moved to Tonypandy . The experience of breaking up the home left a deep impression on the youth. For the final two years at school he lived in lodgings in Tregaron . This is when he received the help and lasting influence of the history master , S.M. Powell , who created in him, as in so many other well-known people of the area, a love for the history and culture of his neighbourhood and nation, and for drama and public speaking.\n\nHe left school in 1921 to become a pupil-teacher at Blaengwynfi and during 1922-25 he took a B.A. course in Welsh and education, with history, Latin and philosophy, at the University College , Aberystwyth . This was ‘Aber’ during the creative upsurge brought about by such students as Idwal Jones . It was also the period of ex-servicemen and conscientious objectors (his friend Gwenallt ( David James Jones ) was there about the same time), and Kitchener ‘s, interest in the turmoil of politics and peace in Europe grew. He became secretary of the debating society and a member of the Students’ Council , and led movements assisting continental students and the League of Nations which he represented at a month-long international school held in Geneva in 1925 . After gaining his teacher’s certificate in 1926 , he spent the rest of his life teaching in several schools in the Rhondda valley . Soon after going there his aunt d., and in an essay he admits that this was as great a loss to him as losing his mother and leaving Llain had been.\n\nIf his childhood had a strong hold on him and his work, Rhondda was no less significant. He worked unsparingly for Welsh causes in the valley, a thankless task that nevertheless did not dis-hearten him. He led a strong campaign to establish the Welsh school there. He served in a host of national societies and organisations promoting culture, education and peace ; he became particularly involved in organising adult education and lecturing . Poverty and economic conditions in the valley during the depression concerned him greatly, though there was no prominent position a nationalist could take in the workers’ movements of his day; he helped with the social experiment in Maes-yr-haf during the war. He was a member of Bethania chapel , Tonypandy , and used to preach in the valleys, despite his dislike of the image and life of a preacher .\n\nIt was as one of the advocates of Plaid Cymru that he came into prominence. He was a masterly and influential speaker , with the gift to arouse people. He canvassed and held open-air meetings (often in the company of the inspired Morris Williams , and his wife Kate (Roberts) , who lived for a while in the same street). He stood as a candidate for the county council , and also as a candidate for his party in east Rhondda in 1945 , and west Rhondda in 1950 and 1951 , shortly before he was taken ill. In 1940 he m. a Tonypandy grammar school teacher , Mair Rees of Ffos-y-ffin , Aberaeron , and they made their home in Aeron , Brithweunydd , Trealaw , where their three daughters Megan , Mari and Manon were born.\n\nHe enjoyed gardening , was good company, and read extensively. He steeped himself in the works of Williams , Pantycelyn , appreciated the works of Saunders Lewis and T.S. Eliot , and ensured that the poet was given a place in the theatre. He took an active interest in drama; he founded the Pandy Dramatic Soc. , and produced and acted with the company during the 1930s ; he became an adjudicator and lecturer , and broadcast many times. He contributed many articles to the Welsh and English press, usually on politics and drama. He was admitted as a member of the Gorsedd of Bards in 1945 for his contribution to Welsh drama. He regarded his own plays as literary experiments, being frequently the fruit of competition. His play Cwm glo ( 1935 ), about the shattered morals and relationships in a family during the depression, created a great stir. In the play the daughter departs to earn her living on the streets; denied the prize in Aberafan eisteddfod in 1932 , people thronged to see it. His short play Y tri dyn dierth ( 1937 ) was an adaptation of one of Hardy ‘s stories. Susannah ( 1938 ) was a one-act play based on the book in the Apocrypha , and Hen wlad fy nhadau ( 1939 ) a translation of a play by Jack Jones . Meini gwagedd ( 1944 ; 2nd. ed. 1945 ) is a metrical tragedy about the hard life on Cors Caron ; with its notable use of the rich language of the district, it is considered to be his best work prior to Sŵn y gwynt sy’n chwythu . He completed five other plays: Dies irae , a three-act play based on the story of Boudicca ; Gloria in excelsis , a short radio play on the theme of Easter; Miss Blodeuwedd , a farce based on the folk-tale, written in conjunction with his wife: Y fantell fraith , in collaboration with his summer school class in Harlech in 1942 ; and also Ynys Afallon , a partially-metrical play on the history of Wales , which he himself considered to be his most ambitious experiment.\n\nHe did not compose many poems. Nevertheless, it is as a poet that he is remembered because he left a message for his own age in his few poetical works, and in one poem in particular. Meini Gwagedd and the pryddestau ‘ Ing cenhedloedd ’ and ‘ Yr Arloeswr ’ present the theme which was definitively developed in ‘ Sŵn y gwynt sy’n chwythu ’. This pryddest was commissioned, broadcast in 1952 , and published posthumously in 1953 . It was while he was in hospital, awaiting his second cancer operation, that he composed it, dictating its final form to his wife. It is a poem that shocks one, with the poet divesting himself of all his motives, as Pantycelyn had done, but here we have a new pitiless voice. It allows us to view a frightening pilgrimage into the presence of sanctity; and the author’s plea to be spared his duty becomes the crisis of man in every age. It is regarded as one of the greatest Welsh poems of the 20th century, and Kitchener ‘s name became synonymous with it, as with the Rhondda valley and Plaid Cymru .\n\nHe d. 25 Aug. 1952 , and was buried in the cemetery of Llether Ddu , Trealaw . A plaque on the wall of Llwynpïod chapel in memory of him was unveiled on 3 Sept. 1977 , and in 1980 an anthology of his chief works was published.\n\nSources:\n\nDocuments and information mainly from his widow, and his sister;\n\nBaner ac Amserau Cymru , 23 Aug. 1944 , 27 Aug. 1952 ;\n\nthe introduction to Swn y gwynt sy’n chwythu pryddest radio (Denbigh, 1953) ;\n\nLleufer , winter 1953 ;\n\nBarn , Apr. and Aug. 1966 ;\n\nJ.K.

I had really enjoyed researching into Kitch , he is an inspiration to all welsh speakers because his heart and passion is one that gives hope.\n\nPlaid Cymru – Party of Wales, often referred to simply as Plaid) is a social-democratic political party in Wales advocating for Welsh independence from the United Kingdom within the European Union.\n\nPlaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and won its first seat in the UK Parliament in 1966. Plaid Cymru by 2018 had one of four Welsh seats in the European Parliament, four of 40 Welsh seats in the UK Parliament, 10 of 60 seats in the National Assembly for Wales, and 202 of 1,264 principal local authority councillors. Plaid is a member of the European Free Alliance.\n\nPlaid Cymru’s goals as set out in its constitution are:\n\nTo promote the constitutional advancement of Wales with a view to attaining independence within the European Union;\n\nTo ensure economic prosperity, social justice and the health of the natural environment, based on decentralist socialism;\n\nTo build a national community based on equal citizenship, respect for different traditions and cultures and the equal worth of all individuals, whatever their race, nationality, gender, colour, creed, sexuality, age, ability or social background;\n\nTo create a bilingual society by promoting the revival of the Welsh language;\n\nTo promote Wales’s contribution to the global community and to attain membership of the United Nations.\n\nHistory\n\nBeginnings\n\nWhile both the Labour and Liberal parties of the early 20th century had accommodated demands for Welsh home rule, no political party existed for the purpose of establishing a Welsh government. Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (English: National Party of Wales) was formed on 5 August 1925, by Moses Gruffydd, H. R. Jones and Lewis Valentine, members of Byddin Ymreolwyr Cymru(Home Rule Army of Wales; literally, Self-Rulers’ Army of Wales); and Fred Jones, Saunders Lewis and David John Williams of Y Mudiad Cymreig (The Welsh Movement). Initially, home rule for Wales was not an explicit aim of the new movement; keeping Wales Welsh-speaking took primacy, with the aim of making Welsh the only official language of Wales.\n\nIn the general election of 1929 the party contested its first parliamentary constituency, Caernarvonshire, polling 609 votes, or 1.6% of the vote for that seat. The party contested few such elections in its early years, partly due to its ambivalence towards Westminster politics. Indeed, the candidate Lewis Valentine, the party’s first president, offered himself in Caernarvonshire on a platform of demonstrating Welsh people’s rejection of English dominion.\n\n1930s\n\nBy 1932 the aims of self-government and Welsh representation at the League of Nations had been added to that of preserving Welsh language and culture. However, this move, and the party’s early attempts to develop an economic critique, did not broaden its appeal beyond that of an intellectual and socially conservative Welsh language pressure group. The alleged sympathy of the party’s leading members (including President Saunders Lewis) towards Europe’s totalitarian regimes compromised its early appeal further.\n\nIn 1936 Lewis, David John Williams and Lewis Valentine attacked and set fire to the newly constructed RAF Penyberth air base on the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd in protest at its siting in the Welsh-speaking heartland. The leaders’ treatment, including the trial judge’s dismissal of the use of Welsh and their subsequent imprisonment in Wormwood Scrubs, led to “The Three” becoming a cause célèbre. This heightened the profile of the party dramatically and its membership had doubled to nearly 2,000 by 1939.\n\n1940s\n\nIn 1943 Saunders Lewis contested the University of Wales parliamentary seat at a by-election, gaining 1,330 votes, or 22%. In the 1945 general election, with party membership at around 2,500, Plaid Cymru contested seven seats, as many as it had in the preceding 20 years, including constituencies in south Wales for the first time. At this time Gwynfor Evans was elected president.\n\n1950s\n\nGwynfor Evans’s presidency coincided with the maturation of Plaid Cymru (as it now began to refer to itself) into a more recognisable political party. Its share of the vote increased from 0.7% in the 1951 general election to 3.1% in 1955 and 5.2% in 1959. In the 1959 election, the party contested a majority of Welsh seats for the first time. Proposals to drown the village of Capel Celyn in the Tryweryn valley in Gwynedd in 1957 to supply the city of Liverpool with water played a part in Plaid Cymru’s growth. The fact that the parliamentary bill authorising the drowning went through without support from any Welsh MPs showed that the MPs’ votes in Westminster were not enough to prevent such bills from passing.\n\n1960s\n\nSupport for the party declined slightly in the early 1960s, particularly as support for the Liberal Party began to stabilise from its long-term decline. In 1962 Saunders Lewis gave a radio talk entitled Tynged yr Iaith (The fate of the language) in which he predicted the extinction of the Welsh language unless action was taken. This led to the formation of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg(the Welsh Language Society) the same year.\n\nLabour’s return to power in 1964 and the creation of the post of Secretary of State for Wales appeared to represent a continuation of the incremental evolution of a distinctive Welsh polity, following the Conservative government’s appointment of a Minister of Welsh Affairs in the mid-1950s and the establishment of Cardiff as Wales’s capital in 1955.\n\nHowever, in 1966, less than four months after coming in third in the constituency of Carmarthen, Gwynfor Evans sensationally captured the seat from Labour at a by-election. This was followed by two further by-elections in Rhondda West in 1967 and Caerphilly in 1968 in which the party achieved massive swings of 30% and 40% respectively, coming within a whisker of victory. The results were caused partly by an anti-Labour backlash. Expectations in coal mining communities that the Wilson government would halt the long-term decline in their industry had been dashed by a significant downward revision of coal production estimates. However, — in Carmarthen particularly — Plaid Cymru also successfully depicted Labour’s policies as a threat to the viability of small Welsh communities.\n\n1970s\n\nIn the 1970 general election Plaid Cymru contested every seat in Wales for the first time and its vote share surged from 4.5% in 1966 to 11.5%. Gwynfor Evans lost Carmarthen to Labour, but regained the seat in October 1974, by which time the party had gained a further two MPs, representing the constituencies of Caernarfon and Merionethshire.\n\nPlaid Cymru’s emergence (along with the Scottish National Party) prompted the Wilson government to establish the Kilbrandon Commission on the constitution. The subsequent proposals for a Welsh Assembly were, however, heavily defeated in a referendum in 1979. Despite Plaid Cymru’s ambivalence toward home rule (as opposed to outright independence) the referendum result led many in the party to question its direction.\n\nAt the 1979 general election the party’s vote share declined from 10.8% to 8.1% and Carmarthen was again lost to Labour.\n\n1980s\n\nCaernarfon MP Dafydd Wigley succeeded Gwynfor Evans as president in 1981, inheriting a party whose morale was at an all-time low. In 1981 the party adopted “community socialism” as a constitutional aim. While the party embarked on a wide-ranging review of its priorities and goals, Gwynfor Evans fought a successful campaign (including the threat of a hunger strike) to oblige the Conservative government to fulfill its promise to establish S4C, a Welsh-language television station. In 1984 Dafydd Elis-Thomas was elected president, defeating Dafydd Iwan, a move that saw the party shift to the left. Ieuan Wyn Jones (later Plaid Cymru leader) captured Ynys Môn from the Conservatives in 1987. In 1989 Dafydd Wigley once again assumed the presidency of the party.\n\n1990s\n\nIn the 1992 general election the party added a fourth MP, Cynog Dafis, when he gained Ceredigion and Pembroke North from the Liberal Democrats. Dafis was endorsed by the local branch of the Green Party. The party’s vote share recovered to 9.9% at the 1997 general election.\n\nIn 1997, following the election of a Labour government committed to devolution for Wales, a further referendum was narrowly won, establishing the National Assembly for Wales. Plaid Cymru became the main opposition to the ruling Labour Party, with 17 seats to Labour’s 28. In doing so, it appeared to have broken out of its rural Welsh-speaking heartland, and captured traditionally strong Labour areas in industrial South Wales.\n\nPlaid Cymru in the Assembly era\n\nFirst National Assembly, 1999–2003\n\nIn the 1999 election Plaid Cymru gained seats in traditional Labour areas such as Rhondda, Islwyn and Llanelli, achieving by far its highest share of the vote in any Wales-wide election. While Plaid Cymru regarded itself as the natural beneficiary of devolution, others attributed its performance in large part to the travails of the Labour Party, whose nomination for Assembly First Secretary, Ron Davies, was forced to stand down in an alleged sex scandal. The ensuing leadership battle, won by Alun Michael, did much to damage Labour, and thus aided Plaid Cymru, whose leader was the more popular and higher profile Dafydd Wigley. The Labour Party’s UK national leadership was seen to interfere in the contest and deny the popular Rhodri Morgan victory. Less than two months later, in elections to the European parliament, Labour support slumped further, and Plaid Cymru came within 2.5% of achieving the largest share of the vote in Wales. Under the new system of proportional representation, the party also gained two MEPs.\n\nPlaid Cymru then developed political problems of its own. Dafydd Wigley resigned, citing health problems but amid rumours of a plot against him. His successor, Ieuan Wyn Jones, struggled to impose his authority, particularly over controversial remarks made by a councillor, Seimon Glyn. At the same time, Labour leader and First Minister Alun Michael was replaced by Rhodri Morgan.\n\nIn the 2001 general election, Notwithstanding Plaid Cymru recording its highest-ever vote share in a general election, 14.3%, the party lost Wyn Jones’s former seat of Ynys Môn to Albert Owen, although it gained Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, where Adam Price was elected.\n\nSecond National Assembly, 2003–07\n\nThe Assembly elections of May 2003 saw the party’s representation drop from 17 to 12, with the seats gained in the 1999 election falling again to Labour and the party’s share of the vote declining to 21%. Plaid Cymru narrowly remained the second-largest party in the National Assembly ahead of the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Forward Wales.\n\nOn 15 September 2003 folk-singer and county councillor Dafydd Iwan was elected as Plaid Cymru’s president. Ieuan Wyn Jones, who had resigned from his dual role as president and Assembly group leader following the losses in the 2003 Assembly election, was re-elected in the latter role. Elfyn Llwyd remained the Plaid Cymru leader in the Westminster Parliament. Under Iwan’s presidency the party formally adopted a policy of independence for Wales within Europe.\n\nThe 2004 local election saw the party lose control of the two South Wales councils it gained in 1999, Rhondda Cynon Taff and Caerphilly, while retaining its stronghold of Gwynedd in the north-west. The results enabled the party to claim a greater number of ethnic minority councillors than all the other political parties in Wales combined, along with gains in authorities such as Cardiff and Swansea, where Plaid Cymru representation had been minimal. In the European Parliament elections of the same year, the party’s vote share fell to 17.4%, and the reduction in the number of Welsh MEPs saw its representation reduced to one.\n\nIn the general election of 5 May 2005, Plaid Cymru lost the Ceredigion seat to the Liberal Democrats; this result was a disappointment to Plaid, who had hoped to gain Ynys Môn. Overall therefore, Plaid Cymru’s Parliamentary representation fell to three seats, the lowest number for the party since 1992. The party’s share of the vote fell to 12.6%.\n\nIn 2006, the party voted constitutional changes to formally designate the party’s leader in the assembly as its overall leader, with Ieuan Wyn Jonesbeing restored to the full leadership and Dafydd Iwan becoming head of the voluntary wing of the party. 2006 also saw the party unveil a radical change of image, opting to use “Plaid” as the party’s name, although “Plaid Cymru — the Party of Wales” would remain the official title. The party changed its logo in 2006, from the traditional green and red triban (three peaks) used since 1933, to a yellow Welsh poppy(Meconopsis cambrica).\n\nThird National Assembly, 2007–11\n\nIn the National Assembly election of 3 May 2007, Plaid Cymru increased its number of seats from 12 to 15, regaining Llanelli, gaining one additional list seat and winning the newly created constituency of Aberconwy. The 2007 election also saw Plaid Cymru’s Mohammad Asghar become the first ethnic minority candidate elected to the Welsh Assembly. The party’s share of the vote increased to 22.4%.\n\nAfter weeks of negotiations involving all four parties in the Assembly, Plaid Cymru and Labour agreed to form a coalition government. Their agreed “One Wales” programme included a commitment for both parties to campaign for a Yes vote in a referendum on full law-making powers for the Assembly, to be held at a time of the Welsh Assembly Government’s choosing. Ieuan Wyn Jones was subsequently confirmed as Deputy First Minister of Wales and Minister for the Economy and Transport. Rhodri Glyn Thomas was appointed Heritage Minister. He later stood down, and Alun Ffred Jones took over. Ceredigion AM Elin Jones was appointed to the Rural Affairs brief in the new 10-member cabinet. Jocelyn Davies became Deputy Minister for Housing, and later, Regeneration.\n\nIn the 2010 general election, Plaid returned three MPs to Westminster. They took part in the Yes for Wales cross-party campaign for the March 2011 referendum.\n\nFourth National Assembly, 2011–16\n\nIn the 2011 National Assembly election Plaid slipped from second place to third, being overtaken by the Welsh Conservative Party and losing its deputy leader Helen Mary Jones. The party held an inquiry into the election result. The internal investigation led to the adoption of wide-ranging changes to its constitution, including a streamlining of the leadership structure.\n\nIn May 2011, Ieuan Wyn Jones announced he would stand down as leader within the first half of the Assembly term. A leadership election was held in which three candidates eventually stood: Elin Jones, Dafydd Elis-Thomas and Leanne Wood; Simon Thomas withdrew his candidacy before ballots were cast.\n\nOn 15 March 2012, Plaid Cymru elected Leanne Wood as its new leader. She received 55% of the vote, over second-placed Elin Jones with 41%. She is the first female, and the first non-fluent Welsh speaker. Soon after Wood’s election as leader, she appointed former MP Adam Price to head an economic commission for the party “focussed on bringing together tailor-made policies in order to transform our economy”. On 1 May 2012 it was confirmed Leanne Wood would not be taking the £23,000 pay increase that every other party leader in the Assembly receives.\n\nOn 12 November 2012, Wood announced she would be abandoning her relatively safe list seat to stand in a constituency at the 2016 National Assembly elections; she later confirmed she would contest the Rhondda. Adam Price was subsequently selected as the party’s candidate for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. Lindsay Whittle confirmed he would contest the Caerffili constituency.\n\nOn 20 June 2013, former party leader Ieuan Wyn Jones stood down from the Assembly as the member for Ynys Môn. Plaid Cymru’s candidate Rhun ap Iorwerth was elected as the new Assembly Member for the constituency, receiving 12,601 votes (a 58% share) with a majority of 9,166 over the Labour candidate.\n\nFifth National Assembly, 2016–present\n\nFollowing the 2016 Welsh Assembly Elections, having gained one seat Plaid Cymru became the Assembly’s second largest party and briefly became the official opposition to the Welsh Government with 12 seats. Plaid Cymru currently has ten Assembly Members, following Dafydd Elis-Thomas’s resignation from the party in 2016 and Neil McEvoy’s permanent expulsion from Plaid’s Assembly group in 2018.\n\nIn the 2016 referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU Plaid campaigned for a remain vote . Wales voted 52.5% in favor of leave.\n\nUndeb Credyd Plaid Cymru\n\nUndeb Credyd Plaid Cymru Credit Union Limited is a savings and loans co-operative established for party members in 1986.
