        "text": "Not to be confused with Welsh Socialist Republican Movement or Welsh republicanism.\n\nThe Welsh Republican Movement (Welsh: Mudiad Gweriniaethol Cymru) was a Welsh nationalist political party.\n\nIt was founded in 1949 as a split from Plaid Cymru. The group, some of whom had previously been members of the Labour Party, aimed to build a base in industrial southeast Wales by focusing on socialism and republicanism rather than on rural affairs, pacifism and the Welsh language.\n\nIn 1950, the group began publishing a newspaper, The Welsh Republican - Y Gweriniaethwr. It stood Ithel Davies in Ogmore in the 1950 general election, and took 1.3% of the vote.\n\nSome members of the party were arrested for burning the Union Jack, and it faced accusations of initiating violence. They also conceived a Welsh republican flag, a tricolor with green, red and white bands."
