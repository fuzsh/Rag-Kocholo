        "text": "History\n\nMore a social movement than a political party in its early years, Plaid Cymru was founded in 1925 in response to a perceived threat to Welsh language and culture posed by the increasing official use of English in Wales. During the 1920s and ’30s, when economic turmoil and social change dominated the political agenda, Plaid’s cultural and linguistic nationalism found little response among voters. The party did not seriously address economic issues until addressing the postwar reconstruction of the Welsh economy after 1945. However, internal divisions over the party’s continued emphasis on cultural issues rather than socioeconomic concerns, as well as the strength of the Labour Party—whose membership included several leading Welsh political personalities—ensured that Plaid Cymru achieved little electoral success through the 1950s.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nBritish general election of 2010: Plaid Cymru\n\nDuring the 1960s, with the injection of new ideas from younger members, the party broadened its agenda to include pressing social and economic issues. The formation of the Welsh Language Society in 1962 was particularly propitious, because it allowed Plaid to turn more of its attention to electoral politics. The party won its first seat in Parliament in a by-election in 1966, and its policies helped to bring about the passage of the Welsh Language Act of 1967 and the establishment of the Welsh Development Agency in 1974. The party also influenced other important changes, including the creation of a Welsh television channel in 1982 and the passage of the Welsh Language Act of 1993. The Welsh Language Board, established under provisions of the 1993 act, promoted the use of the Welsh language and sought to give Welsh equal legal weight with English in the conduct of government business and the administration of justice.\n\nIn the general election of 1997, Plaid Cymru won 4 of the 40 Welsh seats in Parliament. The party had considerable difficulty gaining support in areas outside its Welsh-speaking core in the north and west of Wales, mainly because of the long-standing strength of the Labour Party in the populous English-speaking south. Plaid was strongly represented in local councils in Wales, outnumbered only by Labour. Even at the local level, however, Plaid’s support was weak in the main urban areas.\n\nPlaid strongly supported the establishment of a new Welsh assembly, first proposed in an unsuccessful referendum in 1979 but narrowly approved in a second referendum in September 1997. (A bare majority—50.3 percent—voted in favour of the new assembly on a turnout of only 50 percent of eligible voters.) First convened in May 1999, the National Assembly for Wales was responsible for administering public services and implementing regional policies on education, health care, and economic development, among other areas. Plaid was very successful in the first elections to the assembly, winning 30 percent of the votes and 17 seats out of 60 (including three normally solid Labour seats in south Wales) and thereby becoming the main opposition to the minority Labour administration. In the 2003 assembly elections, Plaid’s vote share dropped by one-third, and it won only 12 seats. Nevertheless, the party remained an important political force, particularly in Welsh-speaking regions. In the 2007 assembly elections, Plaid picked up three seats, bringing its total to 15. The party subsequently entered into a formal coalition government with the Labour Party in Wales, marking Plaid’s first time in government. In the 2011 assembly elections, however, the party lost four seats, dropping to a total of 11, though it gained back a seat in 2016 voting. Meanwhile, at each of the four elections to the House of Commons between 2001 and 2015, Plaid Cymru won three seats, and in the June 2017 and December 2019 snap elections it won four seats.\n\nIn the 2021 elections for the National Assembly, the party added one seat to its 2016 count for a total presence in the assembly of 13 representatives.\n\nPolicy and structure\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nPlaid Cymru is a resolutely constitutional and nonviolent party, a fact that distinguishes it from some more radical defenders of Welsh language and culture. The overall theme of the party’s policies is decentralization of power, with a particular emphasis on full national status for Wales. After the creation of the National Assembly in 1998, Plaid campaigned to give the assembly the power to vary tax rates and to pass other “primary” laws beyond the limited jurisdiction it had inherited from the secretary of state for Wales and the Welsh Office.\n\nFrom 1981 Plaid’s constitution committed the party to socialism. Central to this commitment was “community socialism,” a distinctively Welsh concept emphasizing a focus on local politics and encouraging a certain ideological distance from other political parties. Such an “isolationist” stance potentially hampered prospects of serious change in Welsh politics, but it did help to convey Plaid’s involvement in specifically Welsh issues and its dedication to gradual reform rather than revolutionary change.\n\nIn 1990 Plaid adopted a more favourable view of the European Union (EU), regarding it as a structure within which a self-governing Wales might function on equal terms with other states. The party also developed policies on issues such as the environment and the role of women. On occasion it established links with other parties, such as the Scottish National Party and the British Green Party, with mixed results.\n\nThe basic unit of Plaid’s party structure is the local branch. At an intermediate level there are district and parliamentary constituency committees, and at the national level there is a National Council, a National Executive Committee, national sections, and an annual conference. The Executive Committee is responsible for maintaining the organizational structure of the party and for implementing resolutions adopted by the National Council and the annual conference. The National Council performs policy-making functions between annual conferences, which are formally sovereign. The party has a small membership, estimated to be about 10,000.\n\nBecause Plaid does not receive any funding from industry or trade unions, the main function of the local branches is to raise money. Party candidates are nominated by branches, and final selection is made by committees composed of branch representatives, constituency officials, and regional party representatives.\n\nDavid Broughton"
