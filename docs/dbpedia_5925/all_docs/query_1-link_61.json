        "text": "Noelle Davies, n√©e Ffrench, of Busby Park, Ireland, married David James Davies (1893-1956), economist, in 1925. They had met at the International People's College, Elsinore, Denmark. They became active in the Welsh Nationalist Party (now Plaid Cymru) when it was founded in 1925. In 1932, they bought Pantybeiliau mansion, Gilwern, Monmouthshire, and attempted unsuccessfully to establish a folk school. They remained active in Plaid Cymru, and became involved in the dispute over the legal status of Monmouthshire. After her husband's death in 1956, Noelle moved back to Ireland. She died in 1983."
