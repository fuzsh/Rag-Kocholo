        "text": "Welsh independence remains a minority position in Wales, but the fact that its momentum is growing is undeniable. So while the movement for independence in Wales may not be as developed as the movement in Scotland, there has been some promising developments nurturing the roots of the movement and feeding the possibilities of mainstreaming of the idea of Welsh independence – preparing public opinion before the next move forward. Optimistic sounds are being made amongst grassroots organisations favouring Welsh independence drawing upon a resurgence of interest that is being driven by a younger generation.\n\nThe general figure for support has been less than 10%, but then a poll in 2018 showed 19% support a developing sizable minority. That poll, which took place between May 30 and June 6, 2018, asked: “Do you agree that Wales should become an independent country?”\n\nThose in support was 19%, against was 65% and the “don’t know” category was 16%.\n\nOf course this a fickle foundations to argue on the basis of opinion polls alone. : Opinion poll evidence for a rise in support for independence is less certain and the percentage of people advocating independence can vary quite significantly according to how the question is framed.\n\nThe BBC in February 2019 for its annual St David’s Day poll found that support for independence was 7% – the same level as the year before.\n\nThe Sky TV data in December 2018 also incorporated figures about whether the Assembly should be abolished.\n\nIt found 22% would vote in favour of the National Assembly for Wales being abolished which would result in rule at Westminster, but 58% against.\n\nWhile many Welsh people may express their desire for independence, currently a majority of them believe that Wales is too small a nation to survive on its own.\n\nThe political developments that are pointing to a rising tide of independence sentiment have been evident for a couple of years now. There was the first ever debate on independence in the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) calling for Wales to have the power to hold an independence referendum, and the right of the Welsh Parliament to be able to decide on the future of Wales.\n\nYouGov Welsh Independence Tracker – 2020\n\nIf there was a referendum tomorrow on Wales becoming an independent country and this was the question, how would you vote? Should Wales be an independent country?”\n\nAll figures discount those who responded with ‘Don’t Know’, ‘Refused’ or ‘Would not Vote’.\n\nYouGov / YesCymru: 11 – 16 November (2020) – YES 33%\n\nYouGov /ITV Cymru Wales & Cardiff U: 20 – 23 Jan (2020) – YES 27%\n\nYouGov /ITV Cymru Wales & Cardiff U: December 6-9 (2019) – YES: 22%\n\nNot surprisingly the campaigning group YesCyrmu accentuated the good news in November 2020, reporting:\n\n“YesCymru has released the findings of a YouGov opinion poll commissioned this week, which shows that a third (33%) of the people of Wales who had a view would vote for an independent Wales if a referendum was held tomorrow.”\n\nYesCymru Chair, Sion Jobbins, said:\n\n“Support for independence is the strongest it’s ever been, with 33% of the people of Wales now saying that they would vote for Welsh independence if a referendum was held tomorrow. That’s a 6 point increase from January, and a massive 11 point increase since December last year.[i]\n\nIn the summer of 2020, Adam Price, Plaid Cymru leader spoke of a “new national consciousness” and that the pandemic had boosted support for Welsh independence. The internet news site, The Canary reported;\n\n“June’s Welsh Barometer poll also revealed 25% of voters supported independence if there was a referendum the next day, the highest ever level of support recorded.\n\nBut the same poll also found 25% of people asked would choose to abolish the Welsh Parliament if they were given a referendum on doing so.” (14th July 2020)\n\nWhat independent activists are pointing out is that the future of Wales as a nation in constitutional terms, is increasingly seen through a very different lens. It is easy to magnify and enthusiastically over-sell (as witnessed showman Boris Johnston’s performances) that minimises the political obstacle still to overcome.\n\nThe hopeful message that the issue of an independent Wales is becoming more mainstream as people from different backgrounds see that the Welsh Parliament can do a better job of running Wales’ affairs than Westminster is not as clear or fixed opinion. Others argue that support for independence talk is growing precisely because ordinary Welsh people don’t see the Labour Welsh government doing much different to the UK government.\n\nPlaid Cymru (PC – self-proclaimed national party of Wales – remains the third party in the devolved assembly, the Senedd and holds ten of the 60 seats, lagging behind the two unionist parties the conservatives and ruling labour party. And it optimistically claims (rather in the manner of ex-Libdem leader, Jo Swinton) “Plaid Cymru is on course to become the next Welsh Government in May 2021”.\n\nSupport for independence, some supporters argue, is now mainstream and cross-party, with 42% of those who voted for Labour in 2019 saying that they would vote for independence if a referendum was held tomorrow.\n\n“There is growing support throughout Wales ranging from 26% in the south east to 37% in the south west in favour of independence. This is an issue that has excited people throughout Wales.[ii]\n\nMainstreaming the idea of Welsh independence\n\nOpinion polls are snapshots of sentiments, political campaigning in an election can consolidate or shift such sentiments. One scenario suggested is the consequences of Wales being tied to an ailing England: “With a Scottish independence referendum to be held in the next few years, and a likelihood of Ireland reuniting, Wales must grab its future and not be at the mercy of it.”\n\nAt the Merthyr Tydfil demonstration in September 2019 All Under One Banner Cymru spokesperson Llywelyn ap Gwilym said:\n\n“With the anti-democratic mess that is currently happening in Westminster, it is more important than ever for Wales to make its voice heard, and for the people of Wales to realise that there is a viable alternative: independence.”\n\nWhile Plaid Cymru MP Delyth Jewell emphasised the momentum:\n\n“I grew up in these valleys and ever since I was a teenager I knew that one day Wales would be an independent nation. But the events of recent years, months and even weeks have led to this growing, rumbling, crescendo of realisation that that time has to be now.”\n\nIf we want real democracy, we have to create it\n\nInevitably reflected in social media, such sentiments have been repeated during Lockdown debating alternative visions of the future about what Wales could be and whether independence is viable and to look at all those questions that arise and have a debate about independence. It suggests the issue of independence is moving closer to the centre stage. However that political agenda is not set in stone.\n\nIn an opinion piece from 11th May 2020 Llywelyn ap Gwilym, [YesCymru central committee member and founder of AUOBCymru] argued that,\n\n“The past 18 months have seen a spectacular rise in support for an independent Wales, with recent opinion polling showing support for independence at around 32%, above the level of Scottish support when their 2014 referendum was called. While this increase in support is certainly encouraging, for those of us who are determined to see a better future come to fruition, our focus must turn to answering the question ‘what next?’\n\nThis is what I have attempted to do in my pamphlet “Llyfr Du Cymru Fydd | The Black Book of the New Wales”. Written in the spirit of utopian thinking, it is one vision of what that New Wales could be.[iii]\n\nA favourable review – unsurprisingly from a fellow activist – welcomed it as a stepping stone as “the starting point for a radical Welsh constitution. I would deepen and radicalise it, but it gives the movement a much clearer vision than it had before. Our job now is to carefully reflect on the political situation we’re in, and to build the strategy that takes us towards this vision… where the pamphlet asserts a welcome pluralistic view of cultures and communities in Wales, instead of trying to awkwardly mould our diverse country into a false homogeneity.”\n\nAcknowledging that from a defensive position to protect the language and a distinctive culture, at times it is easy to fall back on visions of an idealised past, the apolitical appeal to ‘the nation’ not being enough for the job ahead, Coates argues because of this Undod was formed.\n\nCoates argues within the tradition of welsh republican socialism that having a political democracy is no good if we still spend at least a third of our lives under a dictatorship of our bosses. There is also no point going to the trouble of reproducing the inequality of the UK on a smaller scale, The Black Book of the New Wales calls not for a transition of power from one elite to a local one, it recognises the need for a compelling vision worth risking a rupture with the status quo. And the depth of challenge ahead for the national movement.\n\nIn offering a transitional road map, we see the full embrace of the Kurdish concept of democratic confederalism and Coates argues the implied market economy made up of coops, state-community partnerships and other community-orientated enterprises gives us a vision that is both radical and pragmatic. He says reminiscence of cases like the former Yugoslavia and Wright’s principle of ‘containing capitalism’ as an alternative to fantasising about a dramatic, final rupture that suddenly switches society to socialism or anarchism.\n\n(Review: Llyfr Du, Sam Coates 18 September 2020 )\n\nSince March 2020 politics has been virtual…… taking the conversation around independence off social media and onto the streets, most advocating independence admit that sovereignty is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself.\n\n“People thinking of political parties as kind of the only form of political actions is a really big part of the problem we have in Wales.” Said activist, Sam Coates, “Because we’ve got a very weak civil society where the Labour Party has absorbed a lot of that energy.”\n\nWhat other signs of activism were evident of a wider cultural and political approach:\n\nWhile Welsh Football Fans for Independence have been a force of nature, stickering, leafleting and holding marches to home internationals, other campaigns, such as the one to protect the National Library of Wales from funding cuts, worked with the trade union movement on this to “raise awareness”,.\n\nEvents held to mark 20 years of devolution at time when the nation’s newest voters have only ever known devolved politics in Wales. Included at the independence gig in February 2019. Reports were upbeat – the YesIsMore gig in Cardiff was a resounding success, drawing a thousand people to the Tramshed and being referenced in the UK parliament by Plaid’s Liz Saville Roberts.\n\nEvidence of new-found confidence in defending the collective history and culture, as the rebuilding and repainting of the Cofiwch Dryweryn memorial, and its subsequent reproduction country-wide, demonstrates.\n\nDamage to the Cofiwch Dryweryn wall galvanised a movement\n\nThe damage to the Cofiwch Dryweryn wall is not the thing that has driven people to want independence. But the timing of the damage has helped to show many how Wales’s national identity, heritage and values are being threatened by forces outside their control.\n\nIt is one of the more curious symbols of national self-determination that stood unchanged in its inauspicious position next to the A487 : a crumbling stone wall, adorned with a splash of paint, commemorating the loss of a village swept away by a reservoir more than half a century ago .\n\nWhen real life campaigning politics was available in 2019, marches were regarded as a real barometer of whether independence was a topic debated at the margins, or whether it is now entering a part of the mainstream.\n\nMay 2019 – March for independence held in Cardiff. [iv]\n\nOrganised by a group called AUOB Cymru, bringing together a number of other Welsh groups which support independence in a pan-nationalist strategy that supports and encourages joint activity of a broad range of Welsh independence-supporting groups. Llywelyn ap Gwilym, YesCymru central committee member was a founder member of AUOBCymru. It is seen as the sister organisation of Scotland’s grassroots lobbying group, All Under One Banner movement (AUOB).[v]\n\nThe Guardian reported demonstrators saying that Brexit and austerity have increased support for leaving the UK.[vi]\n\nAccording to Undod:\n\nThe movement is still young, and many people are engaging properly with politics for the first time, and so we must be vigilant in ensuring that unsuspecting people’s heads are not turned by the sort of motifs and tropes of the alt-right that threaten our society.\n\nJuly 2019 – supporters of an independent Wales marched through the streets of Caernarfon. Its Facebook page listed 1,300 people as ‘going’ with a further 1,600 expressing an interest in attending the event. The turnout was in Caernarfon that has one of the largest proportions of Welsh speakers in the country. The number of demonstrators had doubled since an #IndyWales march in Cardiff in May. 27 July, at least 8,000 supporters of Welsh independence marched through the streets of Caernarfon in North Wales. The demonstration was organised by ‘All Under One Banner’ (AUOB Cymru). People mobilised from all over Wales to join the march. [vii]\n\nIt was strongly symbolic. Many see the castle as a symbol of the domination of Wales by London. The first’s colonial project when Edward I subjected Wales to English rule in the thirteenth century, and used by the royal family for the investiture of successive princes of Wales.\n\nIn that spirit of internationalism, Helen Jones told The Canary that a contingent of Kurdish residents of Wales joined the March on Saturday. They brought a message of solidarity from the Kurdish freedom movement to the movement for Welsh independence. Jones said that activists from Scotland and Catalonia also joined the demonstration.[viii]\n\nSeptember 2019 – the third mass demonstration for an #IndyWales saw over 5,000 people took to the streets of Merthyr Tydfil on September 7th to call for Welsh independence. Seen as particularly significant, because it brought thousands of people together calling for independence in a Labour stronghold. The Labour party has historically ignored or opposed calls for Welsh independence. Activists grasp at new signs that debate is emerging within the dominant party of the Welsh working class.\n\nThe two highest profiled grassroots groups are focusing on the groundwork, how this support is consolidate and maintains momentum. Any talk about a vision for a new and independent Wales goes further than mere independence from Westminster.\n\nYESCYRMU\n\nNovember 2020 YesCymru reported surge in membership, rearching 15,000 paid up members, “YesCymru is determined to create a welcoming, colourful and progressive mass movement for independence. We believe that there will be a referendum on Scottish independence in the coming years, followed by the reunification of Ireland, what then for Wales?”[ix]\n\nAlthough current YesCymru groups vary in terms of size and type of activity, YesCymru branches has become much more visible with co-ordinated street stalls being held across the country to engage the curious and the sceptical, as well as a designated day for flying YesCymru flags.[x]\n\nIt has 27,993 signatures in its social media campaign , building a mass undertaking of people who have taken the pledge to vote “Yes” in a referendum on Welsh independence (with a target of 50,000)\n\nBecause Llywelyn ap Gwilym of YesCymru believes that Wales as part of the UK is not a fair country, the kind of Wales he wants to live in is one where everyone:\n\n“has equal access to the material, social and cultural means necessary to live a flourishing life…has an equal right to the means necessary to participate meaningfully in decisions that affect their lives…will cooperate with each other, because of a genuine commitment to the wellbeing of others, and the sense that it is the right thing to do.”\n\nUNDOD\n\nUndod (meaning ‘Unity’ in Welsh) is a movement for radical independence in Wales striving to bring the rich multitude of left activism in Wales together as a true popular front. It is like a critical friend when it raises a question:\n\n“the great job YesCymru have done to normalise the idea of national independence, a few key questions linger. Most pressingly, what now? How does an organisation turn its recruits into activists? What can the membership of an organisation actually do, beyond simply putting their name (and money) forward in support of a cause?”\n\nIt acknowledges “YesCymru have been diligently tracking their swelling ranks on social media recently, and it makes for incredible reading: membership has risen from around 2,500 at the start of this year to over 16,000, which by most metrics makes it the second-largest political organisation in Wales.”\n\nSam Coates is a member of UNDOD’s national working group describes the campaigning group as,\n\n“a democratic, non-hierarchical, republican movement established to secure independence for Wales….. We’re free to talk about the material issues that we, as a broad and united left, can see are driving this desire for an independent Welsh state: the demand to provide adequate housing, to reclaim our streets, to protect all who choose to call this country home, and so forth. We don’t have to wait for an independent Wales to fight for these: we can start the work now, taking an active role in our own communities. “\n\nWhen UNDOD started talking about the kind of Wales it wanted, UNDOD’s vision is to “get rid of the exploitation of the capitalist system” and to put the “liberation of everyone at the centre of the struggle for independence”. It believes in universal income, the tradition of anti-nuclear power and anti-militarism, it stated it was,\n\n“thinking in more utopian terms about what could independent Wales actually mean and how could it… radically improve people’s lives. Because the dominant narrative coming out of people like Plaid Cymru was that we’d end up looking a lot like the republic of Ireland and there’s obviously lots of reasons for people on the left why that’s a flawed vision and we’d want to be thinking bigger than that really.”\n\nSam Coates from UNDOD communicated the issue as he sees it:\n\n“We’re reproducing the British state on a smaller scale where Cardiff has generally done quite well out of all the public sector jobs. But it’s sucking wealth and talent from the rest of the country and making traditional Welsh speaking communities less viable than they were…there’s a sense outside of Cardiff that not very much has changed as a result of devolution and if we don’t have anything more radical than devolution to solve people’s problems, like independence, then the risk of going backwards is really significant.” [xi]\n\nThere is no crystal ball that can predict what comes out the other side of the pandemic, and to what extent radical Independence for Wales has its flourishing grassroots campaigns to ensure that the indyWales movement advocates for environmentalism, feminism, republicanism and socialism.\n\n[i] Support for Welsh Independence continues to increase – YesCymru\n\n[ii] A Third Would Vote for Welsh Independence Tomorrow (yes.cymru)\n\n[iii] https://nation.cymru/opinion/after-the-pandemic-it-will-be-up-to-us-to-build-the-new-wales-we-want/———–\n\n[iv] https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-48239666\n\n[v] https://auob.org All Under One Banner (AUOB) is a Scottish independence pressure group created on the 12 October 2014 with the objective of staging public processions for independence at regular intervals.\n\n[vi] https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/11/thousands-march-in-cardiff-calling-for-welsh-independence\n\n[vii] https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/live-welsh-independence-march-caernarfon-16654913\n\n[viii] Less welcomed to many participants were the presence of Ein Gwlad, a Welsh nationalist party that has been accused of far-right sympathies.

It describes itself as an anti-colonisation and anti-racist organisation and campaigns on housing issues having orchestrated protests outside estate agents in England that sell second homes in Wales to English people. Few would argue that there is a need for sustainable local housing market in rural Wales. It has considered a defensive strategy replicating something akin to the Gaeltacht in Ireland; a defined geographical bastion of native language to p reserve what remains of the native Welsh-speaking communities, to be known as “Bro Gymraeg”. It echoed the idea used by the Adfer movement in the 1970s and 1980s, then their campaign caused offence by seeming to disregard the role of Welsh-speakers outside of the designated linguistic homeland.\n\nThe Welsh Republican Army (WRA) (Byddin Weriniaethol Gymreig) said to have re-formed in 2000, is a small Welsh Republican paramilitary organisation, that traces their lineage back to the Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (MAC) – Movement for the Defence of Wales and their slogan ‘Fe godwn ni eto’: ‘We shall rise again‘.\n\nA spokesperson for the WRA made this statement in 2007 on its aims: “The WRA’s primary objective is to establish a Welsh socialist republic and free Cymru from its shackles. We will continue to oppose the British state’s domination and rule of our country.” It was reported in June 2005, that The Welsh Republican Army went to the town of Cilmeri and spray painted over the signs in the town which show the English spelling of the town’s name, and also visited the town railway station and sprayed Free Wales logos in the surrounding area .\n\nWelsh freedom struggle still has some way to break the dominance of English political allegiance and influence in Wales. Referendums on devolution for Wales were held on 1 March 1979 _ Turnout was 58.6% _and 18 September 1997_and turnout was 50.1% in 1997. There was little support for devolution in the 1979 referendum, with only 20.3% of voters in favour. The 1997 referendum on the other hand produced a slim majority in favour of a Welsh Assembly; 50.3% of voters voted ‘Yes’ to an Assembly while 49.7% were opposed.\n\nYet, in the 21st century Plaid Cymru has remained the main vehicle for proponents of Welsh independence aspirations. Plaid are clearly the dominant party of Welsh-speaking Wales, with all the Welsh-majority seats and their support outside the valleys, reflecting the linguistic nature of its constituency more than anything else. It campaigned for Welsh to become an official European Union language. On 15 July 2008 the EU Council of Ministers approved a new status for the use of Welsh as a “co-official” language within EU institutions. This agreement, at the request of the UK Government means that Co-official languages can receive certain services in the EU, such as for example interpretation during meetings, translation of final legislation or the possibility for citizens to correspond with EU institutions in the language.\n\nExpression of a revival in welsh socialist republicanism continued to be premature: April 2003 saw the publication of a new (short-lived) radical weekly called “Seren” / Star encompassing socialist, environmental and republican news.\n\nIn August of the same year, John Marek AM hosted the conference, “Red green and radical – building a left alternative in Wales”. It attracted speculation of the formation of a new political party corresponding to the SSP in Scotland, indeed Tommy Sheridan, the most prominent Scottish Socialist Party member of the Scottish Parliament, was a speaker at the conference. Marek was thought a strange candidate to unify the radical left, as a commentary in Carn observed, he:\n\n“would still be a New Labour AC if he had not been deselected by his local Labour party, is a unionist with a dubious attitude towards the language.” [2]\n\nIn late 2003, Cymru Goch subsumed itself into the new Forward Wales party formed around the ex-Labour member of the Welsh Assembly John Marek. That party was disbanded in 2010.\n\nMike Davies provided a republican overview on “Republican Socialist re-groupment in Wales” in the first few years of the 21st Century:\n\nDocument 38 | A Republican overview on Republican Socialist re-groupment in Wales.[3]\n\nSocialist republicans have been a tiny force in Welsh politics for the past 20 years. During that time Cymru Goch, although a dynamic party that published the only monthly Welsh political paper, reached out to other socialists and republicans through a series of unity ventures that culminated in the unsuccessful Welsh Socialist Alliance.\n\nThis was cynically hijacked by the Socialist Workers Party, who used it as an electoral vehicle without appreciating the need for a deeper alliance to unite the left in Wales. The problem with trying to create left unity in Wales, unlike Scotland, is that the British left groups here (small though they are) have never accepted the need for separate organisation.\n\nThis led to Cymru Goch reluctantly withdrawing from the WSA in 2002. It then organised a highly successful three-day event opposing the Queen’s jubilee with speakers from the IRSP, SSP attending Clwb y Bont in Pontypridd. It turned out to be something of a swansong for the organisation.\n\nThat summer, the party agreed, in an attempt to broaden its appeal, to launch a monthly tabloid paper called Seren (Socialist, Environmental, Republican News). The aim was to link up the various left, trade union and community campaigns in a practical if loose alliance – an attempt to build a grassroots unity based on cooperation rather than forced mergers between sectarian groupings.\n\nAs luck had it, the launch coincided with the growing anti-war protests and for a time Seren went weekly to reflect the activities throughout Wales. It succeeded in building up a network of distributors way beyond CG’s membership.\n\nThen in March 2003, Wrexham’s Assembly Member John Marek was deselected by Labour. After talks with local socialists, he decided to stand as an independent in the May 2003 Assembly elections. Marek had become an increasingly vocal critic of New Labour from a left reformist viewpoint – he had given much practical support to the anti-war movement and recent firefighters’ strike.\n\nHis success in the election—stunningly overturning a solid Labour majority—led to meetings with the SSP and Marek himself called for a Welsh Socialist Party. Unfortunately, he was also under the influence of a Labourite clique and soon pulled back from an SSP-style party, preferring instead to opt for Forward Wales. This sought to unite the left without clarity on the national question and pulled its punches on socialism – not a good start but the left within it (including ex CG-comrades) felt it was a step in the right direction and couldn’t be ignored.\n\nFudging key issues kept many socialist republicans from joining the new party, leaving the Labourites in the ascendancy. The party continued to move on, gaining a councillor in local elections and winning over Ron Davies, the ex-Welsh Secretary. This, although a publicity coup, only succeeded in strengthening the reformist grip on the party.\n\nThe ongoing tensions between the left and the ex-Labourites, coupled with Marek’s effective sole funding of the party through his salary and allowances, ended with the left (including the sole councillor, national secretary and press officer) quitting the party.\n\nSeren continued to publish, maintaining links between leftists in all parties, although it’s fair to say that most are now not in any organisation. Financial pressures led to Seren becoming a web-based publication—http://seren.blogspirit.com—and socialist republicans in Wales continue to be in a state of re-groupment.\n\nSome have opted to join Plaid Cymru, which has a strong socialist republican grouping based around Leanne Wood AM and Jill Evans, the party’s Euro-MP. Leanne in particular has become the most prominent republican in Wales with her principled objections to the Queen opening the Assembly building on March 1.\n\nThe electoral system, not the be all and end off for socialists of course, militates against an SSP-style party in Wales breaking through. In Scotland, the PR system has allowed both the SSP and Greens to win seats while in Wales there is little hope of that happening because the list system is far more restrictive. The party has moved significantly to the left in recent years, calling itself “the socialist party of Wales” in the last General Election and moving away from its cultural nationalist heritage. In truth, it always had a left-wing element but that was dominated by a cultural nationalism in the post-war years.\n\nIt has been a consistent voice for environmental campaigners and aligned itself with the anti-war movement. Adam Price MP, another left voice in the party, is seen as a future leader and has established close links with dissident left union leaders such as Bob Crow of the RMT railworkers’ union.\n\nIndependence is not an issue fudged, socialism is central to its liberation agenda and there has always been an environmental, grassroots element to Plaid’s political message. Plaid, in short, is a world away from the SNP’s right-wing nationalist vision and – for this writer at least – seems like the natural home for Welsh socialist republicans. At a time when there is no Welsh republican organisation and the British left has all but vanished in Wales, the presence of a credible left-wing party in Plaid Cymru is heartening to say the least. Socialists within Plaid will be working to ensure that it can take control of the Assembly in the May 2007 elections against a Labour Party beset by sleaze and scandal.\n\n**\n\nPost-devolution we’re a post-colonial country still waiting to be decolonised. It is these contradictions that describe our present predicament: we are a hybrid state living in the cracks between a dependent past and an independent future.\n\nThus in November 2009, Adam Price, then Plaid’s MP for Dinefwr and East Carmarthenshire[4] had tried to describe the Welsh dilemma, or as Gareth Miles argued in ‘Ranting and Ravings’ a submission to the Welsh Arts Council that same year, “many of our critics, like the majority of their compatriots, are not sure exactly what Wales is.”\n\nGareth_Miles_-_The_lack_of_critical_discussion_of_the_Arts_in_Wales\n\nThe self-declared Socialist republican, Leanne Wood was elected leader of Plaid Cymru on 15 March 2012. The first female leader of Plaid Cymru was the first party leader to be a Welsh learner rather than already fluent in the Welsh language. A Member of the National Assembly for Wales since 2003, her Plaid Cymru profile includes her commitment to working “for Wales to become a self-governing decentralist socialist republic”.\n\nOn the fringe doubts were expressed:\n\nLeanne Wood taking the leadership of Plaid Cymru will spread and perpetuate the illusion that Plaid Cymru is or can become a vehicle for a progressive, socialist and republican movement, that Plaid Cymru can challenge the Westminster imposed austerities, take Wales out of the neo-imperialist wars in the middle east and elsewhere, and get rid of those imposters posing as the Prince and Princess of Wales.[5]\n\nDespite the historical discontinuities, what reasserted itself is the idea that a socialist and republican Wales is a desired goal necessary for a progressive and equal society. Internet activism opportunities sees the spirit and message of welsh socialist republicanism still broadcasted by bloggers like Gethin ‘Iestyn’ Gruffydd and Nickglais, editor of Democracy and Class Struggle blogsite and also a member of Great Unrest Group 2012 for a Welsh Socialist Republican Party. There are individual social media venues, such as Y Repwblic ~ Conversations with Wales’ Republicans, that act to preserve and advance various strands of radical thought[6] and elsewhere on the internet, Radical Wales[7] exists as an independent platform for considered radical political analysis, commentary and discussion. It strives to contribute by providing a space for the extra-parliamentary left of anarchists, communists, greens, left-republicans and socialists outside of the major political parties to explore issues important to them. It says:\n\n“Inspired by the long line of rebels and revolutionaries who have stood outside and against the political process of the ruling class in Wales, we publish original articles that continue that tradition.”\n\nThe latest manifestation of that ideal sprouting again at the margins of the political life but arguing the points made by others throughout the modern history of Wales, was in the appearance in March 2013 of a magazine advertised as Liberation Magazine – Voice of Welsh Socialist Republicanism\n\nDocument 40 | Advertising Copy\n\nThe reason for launching Liberation Magazine is that we take the view you cannot win a game where the rules are made by your opponent.\n\nIn the case of Wales, the British State determines the rules and Welsh people are supposed to play the Welsh Assembly game according to its rules.\n\nIt is arrogant imperial intellectual and practical colonialism where very important decisions on Welsh Life are taken in London and not Wales.\n\nThe Welsh are closetly seen as unfit to govern their own country.\n\nLiberation Magazine unashamedly stands for a Welsh Socialist Republic an idea that has been maturing in Wales for over a century.\n\nThe Labour Party and Plaid Cymru in Wales have never really embraced the idea of Welsh Socialist Republic.\n\nSometimes Plaid Cymru flirts with the idea but quickly backtracks under pressure.\n\nMonarchism has not only infected the Labour Party but also sections of Plaid Cymru.\n\nWe launched Liberation Magazine because we want a journal where the Welsh, the Socialist and the Republican cases can be argued and discussed.\n\nA new strategy and new tactics needs to be developed for the social and national liberation of Wales in the 21st Century if Wales is to arrest its current trajectory of economic and social decline.\n\nLiberation Magazine is about ideas, the precursor of events and the inspirer of people.\n\n“Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people”.\n\n– Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nOur ambition is to create new ideas and start a winning game for Wales.\n\n**\n\nThe present state of the game: 2015 General Election result\n\n[1] See: Cymru Annibynnol – A Brief History of the recent Republican revival in Wales.

It reflects a political alignment in which levels of support for Plaid Cymru remained steady and low, below 20%. It was both a disappointment for the nationalist and republican-inclined in Wales, and it served as a marker of what was still to be tackled as a movement.\n\nThe challenging role of the majority party in Wales, the Labour Party (Plaid Llafur Cymru), was central to the issue of Welsh self-determination. Historically the Labour Party successfully contributed to the continued incorporation of Wales and Scotland into a Westminster-defined “Britishness”. It was until 1974 that TUC Cymru was first established. Even the Conservative Party still has enough support to pose as the second party of Wales. Clearly Non Welsh-speakers were influenced by the view that questions the relevance of bilingualism in an area in which very low percentages are Welsh speaking. The language was regarded by them as anachronistic, even discriminatory; Labour MP for Bedwellite, Neil Kinnock was criticised for “alleging linguistic discrimination on the part of certain Gwynedd teachers against non-Welsh speaking pupils.” [1] The economic pragmatism that prevailed ignored consideration of why the Welsh have maintained a separate cultural identity, despite the Act of Union 1536 and hundreds of years of assimilation, and despite the nation’s close proximity to one of the worlds’ most significant cultural, economic and political centres. By the end of the decade, the intensity of the debate over Wales’ relation to the UK in the 1980s still only saw a narrow margin in favour of the Welsh Assembly.\n\nThere is conflicting ideological fault lines within the Labour Movement, partly explored by Robert Griffith in turning to London, between traditions of peripheral revolt and opposition to the central “Tory” state on one side, and on the other a centralising unionist ethos and ideology based on traditions of class solidarity. Within a section of the nationalist movement there was a resurgence of a leftist current reflective of disappointment with the political progress made. Plaid activists published a newspaper Y Faner Goch to push for “a Welsh Socialist Republic”. The impetus towards a more radical approach saw the formation of the Welsh Socialist Republican Movement/ Mudiad Sosialaidd Gweriniaethol Cymru firstly as a pressure group around Plaid Cymru and then a declared separate existence. Y Faner Goch was replaced by Welsh Republic but its politics remained very much orientated to a radical working class agenda.\n\nThe sympathy for radical action that crossed organisational membership was characteristic of the time with even Dafyd Elis Thomas, Plaid’s MP in Meirionydd expressing the desire for a “Welsh Socialist Republic” providing the forward for the influential pamphlet, Socialism for the Welsh People 1979 socialism for welsh. One of its authors, Robert Griffiths, Plaid’s Research Officer found his employment terminated and suspicions circulated it was because WSRM had criticised Plaid Cymru’s failure to oppose the first referendum on Welsh Devolution in 1979 in order to map out a specific policy of arguing for Independence with a left-wing orientation.\n\nReview of Gareth Miles and Robert – Copy\n\nThe Founding Statement of the WSRM clearly expressed the intention of a revolutionary Marxist organisation. There was heterodoxy in its ideological composition as it was less the centralist Leninist machine and more a radical collective of Welsh radicals. WRSM had a variety of marxisms that ranged from the non-aligned and traditional Communist Party, and included those more aligned to the International Marxist Group and Maoism. It attracted attention from English-based groups.\n\nFounding WSRM\n\n1981 WSRM 1st Congress\n\n1980 ML Support\n\nNotes on Welsh Nationalism and Plaid Cymru – Copy\n\n1981 The Nature of the Welsh Socialist Republican Movement – Copy\n\nAnother influential development was the emergence arson campaign claimed by Meibion Glyndwr . They were responsible for setting fire to English-owned holiday homes in Wales from 1979 to the mid-1990s. (See Appendix One Arson attempts )\n\nThe arson campaign had recommenced at a more intense pace and that led to “Operation Fire” / Operation Tân. The state’s interest in what was a legal political movement raised concern amongst activists. In May 1980 P.D.C., Pwyllgor Diogelu’r Carcharorion – the Prisoners’ Defence Committee – was established after a rally at Llangrannog on the west coast of Wales against second homes/holiday homes. The PDC was raising funds for those ‘imprisoned in the name of Wales, its culture or economy’. The national treasurer was Plaid Cymru Councillor Ioan Richard reflecting a broader concern at the activities of the police. A Welsh civil liberties organisation was also formed to monitor the police’s heightened interest in the republican scene. In his standard academic textbook, “History of Wales”, D. Gareth Evans noted:\n\nThe appearance of unconstitutional activities in the years following the 1979 general election confirmed that Plaid Cymru was in danger of losing the initiative within the nationalist movement.

In March 1980 police raids saw WSRM activists and 30 Cofiwn members arrested and masses of the society’s material confiscated in a sweep for elusive arsonists. The police actions in “Operation Fire” included in the arrests members of Sinn Fein who were subsequently charged with totally unrelated to the Welsh arson campaign. The public support given by WSRM to the republican struggle in the north of Ireland had rang the authorities’ alarm bells.\n\nMay 1982 saw the arrest of five people on charges connected to explosives in Pontypridd and Cardiff the previous October during the visit of Prince and Princess of Wales\n\nNicholas Hodges and Adrian Stone were charged with intent to cause explosions at British Steel’s premises in Gabalfa Cardiff.\n\nGareth Westacott and David Burns were charged with similar offenses relating to an army recruiting office in Pontypridd.\n\nJennifer Smith charged with possession under suspicious circumstances of explosive substances.\n\nTwo of the five were members of the youth movement of Plaid Cymru and all were supporters of the Welsh Socialist Republican Movement. Many others were also arrested: a member of the ‘Troops Out Movement’ was held for 36 hours and released without charge in what was regarded as an act of police harassment and warning about the consequences of their political activities. Following the arrests there were a number of other arrests at the request of the Cardiff police. Three people were arrested in London on June 3rd, and held for fifty hours before one was taken to Cardiff and charged under the Explosive Substance Act 1983.\n\n1982 CS\n\nThe defence campaign followed, what became publicised as the “Cardiff Six”, illustrated the political policing in Wales of the republican socialist scene\n\n1983 CS Febu\n\nPublicity was sparse, and the police briefing was that the conspiracy charges were brought against alleged members of the Workers Army of the Welsh Republic. There were divisions amongst the accused, not all pleading ‘not guilty’, and accusations of police manufacturing evidence, even producing false statements in the defendants’ names.\n\n1984 CS FEB\n\nThe ten weeks trial at Cardiff Crown Court in the autumn of 1984 raised questions neatly encapsulated in the title of John Ormond’s book of the trial, “Police Conspiracy?”\n\n**\n\n1983 WSRM Trial – Copy\n\nIn his summing up at the 10 week Cardiff explosives conspiracy trial the judge directed the jury “The central decision you have to make is as to the honesty of the witnesses. The main contest is between the police and the defendants.”\n\nThe five defendants faced a total of 11 charges, but a guilty verdict was returned by the jury on only one count, where a defendant had provided the police with forensic evidence.\n\nThe jury rejected all the police evidence of incriminating statements (‘verbals’), allegedly made by the defendants while in police custody – including a confession statement which Nick Hodges successfully argued he had signed under duress.\n\nAll conspiracy charges were rejected by the jury – they recognised the political nature of the trial and re-affirmed everyone’s right to hold legitimate political beliefs without facing police retribution.\n\nPOLICE CONSPIRACY?\n\nThe credibility of the South Wales Police is on the line. Four police forces were involved in the investigations and interrogations, but the major role in this conspiracy trial was played by South Wales Police Serious Crime Squad and Special Branch. The jury clearly disbelieved police ‘verbals’, including a signed confession statement made under duress.\n\nIf the issues of police investigation and interrogation procedures are swept under the carpet yet again in Wales as they were after Operation Tan in 1980 we can only assume that there has been further police conspiracy.\n\n**\n\n1984 Carn 44\n\nOsmond’s account was not without its critics, including anarchist defendant, Dafydd Ladd who had pleaded guilty at the trial.\n\n1984 Dafydd Ladd’s OPINION of John Osmond’s POLICE CONSPIRACY?\n\nThe trial was re-visited in Satish Sekar’s self-explanatory study entitled, The Cardiff Five: Innocent Beyond Any Doubt published in 2012 by Waterside Press.\n\nThe experience of the pre-trial period and disruption caused by being held for months in custody pending bail, and the police interviews and surveillance had some effect on the cohesion of the WSRM that failed to survive.\n\nCYMRU G OCH (Red Wales)\n\nCymru Goch (Red Wales) emerged in 1986 out of the demise of the Welsh Socialist Republican Movement. While Robert Griffiths[3] and Gareth Miles went on to join the Communist Party of Great Britain, others simply dropped out of politics altogether; a small socialist remnants published a couple more copies of Y Faner Goch (“The Red Flag”) and then reformed in the late 1980s to create Cymru Goch (Red Wales), and establishing The Red Poets’ Society. In Merthyr, a local equivalent paper ‘Llais Merthyr’ was published.\n\nCymru Goch didn’t operate within Plaid Cymru. Many had been in that nationalist party and become totally disillusioned with their lack of commitment to any form of socialism, let alone republicanism. The complete sell-out by former WSRM supporter Lord Elis-Thomas was the ultimate betrayal. It argued that Wales was a colony dominated by Quangos and believed that power should reside in the communities of Wales. In 1995 it had three councillors and although the WSRM had looked to Northern Ireland for inspiration, Cymru Goch had developed a distinctively Welsh approach, with civil disobedience at its core. It was involved in various community resistance campaigns , active during the Miners’ Strike 1984-85, Cymru Goch also campaigned with the Welsh Water Rights Campaign and prominent in the anti-poll tax struggle (as part of the Anti-Poll Tax Union) that drew in many people who had never taken political action before in their ‘Can’t Pay, Don’t Pay’ campaign.\n\n1984 ymru Goch\n\nOff our backs\n\n1984 bere letter\n\nCymru Goch was one of the founders of the Welsh Socialist Alliance, with the (former Militant group) Socialist Party and some independents. This was an unlikely alliance given that the two principal groups involved have major disagreements over many issues, mainly over the national question. The Welsh Socialist Alliance did stand on a joint United Socialist platform with the Socialist Workers Party at the Welsh Assembly election in 1999. In 2000 the SWP entered the WSA. The attempts by the SWP to dominate the Welsh Socialist Alliance destabilised the organisation and by the end of 2002 both Cymru Goch and Socialist Party Wales had left.\n\nA former member observed:\n\nWhat Cymru needs now more than ever is a fully-fledged Plaid Sosialaeth Cymru, which is completely committed to establishing a socialist republic, without the trappings of a nationalist party, inevitably an uneasy coalition of right, centre and left-wingers.\n\nThere can be no ‘Cymru Rydd’ without the people controlling and owning the country (especially its water, transport and energy). There can be no independence without socialism which destroys the class system.\n\nThere can be no proper rule from the Senedd in the long term without breaking free from a Britain which looks to an anachronistic and aristocratic hereditary head of state: we must have an elected President to represent our country.[4]\n\n1989 meibion glyndwr\n\nMeibion Glyndwr / Sons of Glyndwr renewed arson attacks on second homes. The clandestine group, which took its name for the legendary figure of Owain Glyn Dwr, were thought to be few in number, but many who live in rural Wales support their objectives, share their frustration with the lack of social housing and prices force up by incoming English-speakers, their grudging sympathy may explain the inability of the authorities to identify and charge the perpetrators.[5] In the early 1990s under the control of chairpersons like twenty-two year old Alun Llwyd, Cymdeithas yr laith Gymraeg extended its interest to housing rights in Welsh language communities. In an interview Llwyd stated that:\n\n‘We will campaign against anything which threatens community life. The language won’t be … worth saving unless it’s a living language in living communities.”\n\nCarmarthen Labour MP, Dr Alan Williams suggested that police might look for the arsonists amongst the people attending pro-language demonstrations:\n\n“Many of the nationalist supporters involved showed such passion and anti-English hatred…the person who planted the firebomb may well have been in their midst.”\n\nBoth Plaid Cymru and Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, condemned the fire bombers as “reckless “ and “anti-Welsh”…..the firebombers are the best friends Dr Williams has got because he can use them for his own ends.[6]\n\nSome nationalists have alleged that a ‘false flag’ operation orchestrated by MI5 may be responsible for some of the attacks.[7] The Welsh Language Society spokesperson “suspected agent provocateurs could be responsible for the bombings…he had noticed that every time their [Language] campaigns seem to be gaining momentum the fire-bombers surface to draw attention away from the issues.”[8]\n\ncarn100\n\nThe reoccurrence of expression of Welsh aspiration continued in the last quarter of the twentieth century. The varieties of nationalist sentiment were seldom satisfied within one organisation, and dissatisfaction with the more socialist sounding leadership of Plaid Cymru and its’ anti-Thatcherism, gave rise to the formation of the Covenant Society of the Free Welsh (Cymdeithas Cyfamod y Cymru Rhydd) in 1986.[9] About 100 in membership, it argued that Welsh culture was being deliberately and systematically swamped by English immigration in a process of ‘genocide by substitution’. It was the sort of nationalists that welsh Labour Party found easy to attack as chauvinistic and anti-English. It did display some worrying tendencies in asserting Welsh identity and nationhood:\n\n“Gwent has been secured. It is time to secure the other territories known as the Welsh marches which properly belong to Wales. It is not generally known that Llwydio (Ludlow) in Shropshire was the capital of Wales in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.”[10]\n\nWhile criticising the arson campaign as an ineffective method for achieving change, in 1981 three members were arrested after the involvement of domestic security service MI5 and charged with conspiracy to cause explosions.\n\ncyfamodwyr\n\nThe three denied the charges, but expressed sympathy for Sons of Glendower during the trial. In March 1993 following the ensuring trial, two were cleared and Sion Roberts was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment after being found guilty, by a majority verdict, of sending incendiary device through the post. He was cleared of the conspiracy charge.\n\n[1] anti-taffyd Neil Kinnock and the Anti-Taffy League (1979) Y Faner Goch publications\n\n[2] Evans, D.Gareth (2000) A History of Wales 1906-2000.

The Tryweryn Campaign highlighted the failure of constitutional protest. As one of the last virtually monoglot Welsh communities, Capel Celyn came to symbolise both the pressure on the language and the apparent powerlessness of Welsh MPs to protect Welsh interests. Now Capel Celyn, the hamlet lies beneath the waters of Llyn Celyn – the Tryweryn reservoir – in Snowdonia.\n\nA contemporary view of the farther shores of politics and the state of Welsh nationalism in the mid-Sixties, saw American author George Thayer describe Plaid Cymru as divided into three ideological groups. The vast majority of Plaid members were characterised as pragmatists, the romantic Welsh nationalists compromised the smallest faction, while the revolutionaries were small in number and divided.\n\n1965 Thayer\n\nFWA leader Julian Cayo Evans and “attack” dog, beloved Alsatian called Gelert\n\nPartly in response to the drowning of a valley, along with a Welsh-speaking village, so Liverpool Corporation could create a reservoir for the city’s water supply, the Free Wales Army (Fyddin Rhyddid Cymru), FWA, was formed in Lampeter, Mid-Wales in 1963, with the avowed objective of bringing about an independent Welsh republic. The FWA engaged in various publicity stunts and its leader Julian Cato Evans, and Dennis Coslett, otherwise Dafydd ap Coslett, self-styled commandant of the Carmarthenshire brigade, became a well-known media figures. The FWA paraded, boasting a full rank structure, uniform code, rank badges and decorations.\n\nLegacy of a welsh militant\n\nFor all its militant posturing, the Free Wales Army, was presented in some sections of the media as a bunch of fantasy-fuelled dreamers pledged to “free Wales from the tyrannical English.”[1] John Humphries is scathing in his account of the FWA, [2] arguing the “threat it posed was almost entirely confined to newspaper headlines”. The FWA paraded with thirty-seven attending the Dublin march to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter Rising. There were media coverage of the FWA on manoeuvres on Evans’s farm, “comedians …strutting their stuff around the Welsh countryside.” The organisation made extravagant boasts about its strength and firepower – claiming to have millionaire backers, its own aeroplane and links with the IRA and Basque separatists. In reality members never numbered more than 20 and even the gun in Coslett’s holster turned out to be a toy. Dressed in home-made uniforms, Coslett would also wear a black eye patch over his glass eye – the result of a mining accident. Television presenter David Frost once referred to him as Dai Dayan, because of his resemblance to Moshe Dayan, the Israeli general.\n\nClive Bloom thought of the FWA “for all their noise, too small, too weak and too well known to the police to be much trouble… Plaid Cymru had expelled the flag waving, uniformed nationalists from its ranks.”[3]\n\n2007 Terror\n\nThe Labour Party’s Secretary for Wales, George Thomas (future Speaker of the House) thought the attacks around the Investure as nothing less that political terrorism encourages by Plaid Cymru after it had failed to stop Tryweryn, accusing it of having created a monster it could not control. Humphries records Plaid’s leadership as repudiating the allegations that the party had consorted with extremists, adding, ‘Plaid Cymru has condemned without reservation these outrages.’[4]\n\nOne of the journalists who provided access for Evans, freelancer John Summers, was simultaneously secretly informing the Regional Crime Squad, based in Bristol, on the activities of the FWA. Humphries speculates that the “the only reason the FWA was not rounded up sooner was because the police genuinely considered the army harmless. The only other explanation was that the FWA ‘soldiers’ were allowed to strut their stuff in the hope they might help in the detection of the real bombers.”[5]\n\nThere was little chance of that as John Jenkins, as Director of Operations had reorganised Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (that had emerged during the struggle over Tryweryn) on a cell structure and maintained a clandestine existence well away from the publicity-hungry FWA.\n\nThe summer of ’69 up on the walls went the slogan “Llewelyn lives,” to go with badges proclaiming “No Englishman is Prince of Wales”, the title that belonged only to Llewelyn ap Gruffuyd, the last true Prince of Wales, killed in 1282.\n\nThe opposition to the ceremonial at Caernarfon Castle was expressed in two distinct campaigns: the protests organised by the Anti-Investiture Campaign Committee were identified with republicans and the struggle for independence; Plaid Cymru and Cymdeithas yr laith Gymraeg saw the protests as an opportunity to relauch the language campaign. Whatever the strength of opposition to the decision to make Charles, Prince of Wales it did not warrant media investigation – why spoil the party when all opposition was quarantined as belonging to the lunatic fringe.\n\nThe FWA’s rhetoric grew ever more fantastical; FWA called upon all Welshmen to arm themselves “with guns, bombs, Molotov cocktails, grenades, pikes, bows and arrows, swords, bayonets, clubs, eggs filled with acid, sharpened pennies, then take them to Caernarvon, seize the castle at dawn, the flag of free Wales must fly that day.”\n\nFebruary 26, 1969, the police arrested nine FWA members in dawn raids. At the start of the trial in Swansea in May 1969, the defendants were greeted with an impromptu recital of Land of My Fathers from the public gallery. Coslett refused to speak in English throughout the 53 day hearing.\n\nThe trial ended fortuitously on the day of the Investiture. The Queen crowned her son, Prince Charles, as Prince of Wales during the investiture ceremony at Caernarfon Castle on July 1, 1969. Cayo and his number two, Dennis Coslett, were jailed for 15 months for public order offences.\n\nMAC Denis\n\nCoslett insisted to a journalist:\n\n“Five years ago you’d never hear a Welshman talking about nationalism but as soon as these explosions occurred the people bloody well began to talk and you can bloody well go into any pub in Wales today and you will always hear people talking about our own government, you will always hear someone arguing.”[6]\n\nFrom the moment of the first bomb at Clywedog, the political knee-jerk reaction was always the same: expression of outrage, followed by the determination of the political class to dissociate mainstream Welsh opinion from nationalist activists. They refused to countenance the possibility that there existed an undercurrent of admiration and convert support for the insurgents at ‘war’ with England.[7]\n\nA question to consider is to what extent the direct action of the Sixties’ picked up again by the holiday home arsonists a decade later, helped promote a national consciousness and shape a political environment in which the governing class became more receptive to Welsh aspirations up to the establishment of the Welsh Assembly . Plaid Cmyru has condemned law breaking and thought that it has electorally suffered when regarded as associated with the actions of such fringe groups.\n\nRoy Clews’ “To Dream of Freedom: the struggle of M.A.C. and the Free Wales Army “[8] presents a more rounded picture of the groups. Maybe over-romanticised when portrayed as a challenge England’s rule in the first Welsh armed rebellion since the days of Owain Glynd, there was a sabotage campaign against dams and power installions. From its inception in 1963, the two main protagonists of Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (MAC), the Movement for the Defence of Wales, Owen Williams and John Jenkins, were responsible inspiring the Sixties’ sabotage campaign directed at water pipelines, Government offices and the Prince of Wales.\n\nThe Movement for the Defence of Wales / Mudiad Amddiffyn Cmyru (MAC) under John Jenkins organising a series of explosions that made Welsh patriotism on the extremist fringes a serious threat. Each explosion was directed at property and disruption, this was no campaign of murderous intent. In a BBC2 interview shown on 4 July 2009, John Jenkins repeated his assertion that the bombs were never planted nor timed to hurt people but just to disrupt the ceremony. Those who did die were MAC activists on 30 June 1969, the evening before the investiture, two members of MAC, Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, were killed in a premature explosion when a bomb they had been intending to place outside Government offices in Abergele exploded. In November 1969, following a tip-off, John Jenkins was arrested.\n\nJohn Jenkins – Welsh Terrorist – Copy\n\n“To reawaken the national consciousness of the Welsh people by propaganda and by action with explosives…” John Jenkins |MAC Director of Operations | from witness statements at his trial.\n\nMAC’s activities ceased when John Jenkins was convicted of eight offences involving explosives in April 1970 and sentenced to ten years. While at Albany prison on the Isle of Wight, he underwent a 40 days hunger strike protesting against conditions in the prison. Jenkins’ Prison Letters , edited by Rhodri Williams , was published by Y Lolfa in 1981.\n\nThe letters themselves provide an interesting insight into the life of a political prisoner as well as revealing some of his ideological and philosophical values.\n\nThe petty treatment and isolation of Jenkins at Albany as category A prisoner is explored in Humphries study “Freedom Fighters” who draws a not unfavourable picture of Jenkins character and actions; Jenkins changed his plea at trial on eight accounts:\n\nThis was the man who elected to go to jail rather than risk revealing the identities of his accomplices[9]\n\nJenkins was a model inmate – singing in the prison choir; learning Welsh; and creating Celto-Christian works of art. He started an Open University degree in Social Sciences that was completed after his release.\n\n“When he was imprisoned few people were concerned about his political beliefs but since then a cult has developed around him. He has become the first martyr of the political idea that as long Cymru is not free violence against property is justified.” [10]\n\nUpon release, Jenkins remained active in the socialist republican scene concentrating on the activities of the ‘Welsh Martyrs Fife & Drum Band’ but was still seen by the authorities as a “usual suspect” so later figured in the WSRM Conspiracy trial where sentenced for two years once more for assisting Dafydd Ladd to avoid arrest. Jenkins’ views had not mellowed with age.\n\njenkins\n\n[1] Journalistic view expressed by Dan O’Neill, Bombers urged to rise up to protect the Welsh homeland in the summer of ’69. http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/bombers-urged-rise-up-protect-7345912\n\n[2] Humphries, John (2008) “Freedom Fighters: Wales’s Forgotten ‘War’. 1963-1993.

The Welsh aspiration for independent nationhood has historically founded on divisions between the industrial south and the rural north and west. These geographical considerations reflect a social reality that the south was increasingly characterised by the radical class politics of its labour movement and by the influx of non-welsh speakers. In the north and west the more middle-class, Welsh-speaking non-conformists prevailed. That is not to say that language activism was any less radical in nature and form but that central language concern has traditionally shaped the national party, which emerged in the 1920s out of amalgamation of Mudiad Cymerig (Welsh Movement) and Byddin Ymerolwyr Cymru (Welsh Home Rule Army).\n\nThese groups, under Saunders Lewis, formed Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (Welsh Nationalist Party), emphasised Welsh language and culture rather than self-government. Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru‘s early years were not marked by enormous political success. It was more a cultural defence movement, primarily dedicated to preserving the Welsh language.\n\nWales and language\n\nA thin red thread has run through the tapestry of Welsh society and radicalism in the last few generations. Even before the formation in 1962 of the Welsh Language Society, Welsh nationalism has had its socialist tinge. There was the existence of a vocal socialist, republican, Welsh-speaking group of nationalists who have transcend the geographical and cultural divisions. Periodically an eruption of more republican and leftist sentiment have emerged in Plaid Cymru in the latter half of the twentieth century; these echoed pre-second world war groupings, like the Mudiad Gwerin (Gwerin Movement), based at University College of Bangor, that tried to assert a socialist voice in response to the fascist type sentiments expressed in Plaid. But like with other proved to be short-lived initiatives, its leader Goronwy Roberts migrated to Labour Party, becoming Labour MP for Caernafonshire.\n\nSeptember 1949 at Castell Nedd: The Welsh Republican Movement was founded, the result of a difference of opinion that occurred in the Plaid Cymru Conference of that year. Around fifty of the Plaid Cymr u members decided to walk out of the conference and set about creating their own party, publishing up to 1957 the English language periodical, The Welsh Republic. (Y Gweriniaethwr).\n\nThe difference was the reoccurring one of shifting the emphasis away from the focus on linguistic and cultural issues to a concern with the social issues relevant to the south west of the country. An editorial in The Welsh Republic expressed the sentiments found earlier in the work of Irish revolutionary James Connolly and John Maclean the Scottish schoolteacher and revolutionary Marxist of the Red Clydeside era:\n\n“No form of Welsh independence can be ultimately acceptable to Welsh Republicans unless it results, at the same time, in an improvement in the welfare of Welsh citizens. There is no place in the Welsh Republican Movement for those nationalists who bubble over with love for “Wales and the old language, yet stand utterly aloof- from the day-to-day struggles of the Welsh people.”\n\n1953 editorial\n\nA Green, Red & White Tri Colour was adopted as flag of the newly formed W.R.M. as it launches an all Wales Union Jack burning campaign that leads to a number of disturbances, arrests and court appearances. Two veterans of the movement were involved with Harri Webb (1920-94) one of the editors of The Welsh Republic and (1915-1997) a major contributor. A court case was brought against Bere after he burnt the Union Jack on several occasions, as in Aberdare and at the Caerphilly National Eisteddfod in 1950. The radical civil disobedience tactics continued: June 1950 Republicans launch Anti – Conscription Campaign at a street rally in Aberdar, there were calls for a Welsh Trade Union Congress and independent Welsh Unions.\n\nIn the 1950 General Election, Ogmore (Glamorgan) was contested by former Labour Party candidate, Ithel Davies (1894-1989) as Plaid Weriniaethol Cymru (Welsh Republican Party) gaining 613 votes, 1.3% of all the votes cast.\n\n1950 WELSH REPUBLICAN MANIFESTO – Copy\n\n“To me, Wales is what it is because of its people. It is the people of Wales that have kept the country and its nationality and culture alive through many long years of English oppression. It is those people that I care for, for their freedom and the long lives that we wish for them and could guarantee them under our own government. Our lives are at a bigger risk than ever before because of the selfish demands of the English government on our land, our resources and our people.” [1]\n\nAnd still, reaching back to land that were once the Eastern Lands of the Celtic Tribe, there is campaign for restoration of lost lands ‘Blaenau Diroedd’. There were less “romantic rebel” type expressions of protest in October 1952: bomb attack on the Fron Aqueduct in Central Cymru in protest against water theft.\n\nThe ideological tensions between those whose Welsh Republicanism of necessity received inspiration from 19th century workers rebellions and inspiration for their struggles, against those who looked to ‘’Medieval Welsh Princes’; these were not containable within the organisation. Although a campaigning movement it failed to develop any real “Welsh Republican” ideology or theory that could be handed down to future generations to sustain continuation of a genuine “Welsh Republican Movement and Struggle”. The patriotic sentiments and ‘Republican Manifesto’ had little success in winning other people and the group faded into inactivity with many of the 130 members moving into Plaid Cymru retaining their republican and socialist perspectives, while others took their Welsh republicanism into the Labour Party.\n\n[1] Ithel Davies’ Election pamphlet for 1950."
