        "text": "PLAID CYMRU kick-started its leadership election yesterday, revealing that Ieuan Wyn Jones’ successor will be named on March 15 next year.\n\nThe fact that the new leader will take over on the Ides of March – the day when Julius Caesar was stabbed to death by fellow politicians more than 2,000 years ago – was said to be purely coincidental.\n\nMr Jones announced he would be going shortly after May’s National Assembly election, when the party lost four seats and its position as the second largest party. At first suggesting that his departure could be delayed for two and a half years, yesterday’s announcement confirmed that he will relinquish the leadership after 10 months.\n\nTwo of the party’s best-known figures – and a press posse – took a trip to Barry Island to hear the news.\n\nFormer party president Dafydd Wigley – now a distinguished member of the House of Lords – and Helen Mary Jones, who lost her Llanelli Assembly seat but was last month elected the party’s national chair, presided in Marco’s seafront cafe – known to viewers of Gavin and Stacey as the place where Stacey worked.\n\nThe last time there was a leadership election, in 2003, Ms Jones was a candidate. If it had been fought under the “first past the post” system, she would have beaten Mr Jones. But because the party uses AV for its internal elections – that’s the system that was hammered out of sight in May’s UK-wide referendum – she missed out narrowly.\n\nDoubtless thinking what might have been, Ms Jones revealed the arrangements for the next leadership election.\n\nNominations will open on January 3 and close on January 26. A postal ballot of all members will be held following a series of hustings meetings across Wales, some of which will be open to non-members.\n\nMs Jones said: “This is an exciting time for Plaid. We’re currently renewing our party so that we’ve got the best possible organisation to lead Wales forward in the coming years.\n\n“Anyone who joins before January 26 2012 will have a vote to decide who leads the party. This election is of course bigger than just the party – it will be electing the potential future First Minister of Wales and the individual to take Wales forward over the coming years.\n\n“We can also announce that, for the first time ever, we’ll be holding open leadership debates during the election which will allow any member of the public to question our candidates. These will be in addition to the usual internal hustings.”\n\nLord Wigley, whose current party title is honorary president, pointed out that Barry Island is a Plaid stronghold, holding all five local council seats. He added, for those who are fascinated by trivia, that it forms part of the third most southerly ward in Wales.\n\nAlso announcing a membership drive, Lord Wigley said: “This will be the most innovative membership drive we’ve ever undertaken as a party. People are now, for the first time, able to join online or by phoning our membership hotline.\n\n“We’ll also be using social networks, online advertising, text messaging and other innovative techniques to communicate with the thousands of potential members out there who want to have a say in the party’s future.\n\n“Our message to people across Wales over the coming months is this – if you love Wales, if you care about our nation’s future and want to play a part in making sure Wales moves forward and reaches its potential, then join with me and the thousands of other Plaid members today. A very warm welcome awaits you.”\n\nAsked whether reference to electing a potential future First Minister wasn’t hubristic, given Plaid’s disappointing election result in May, Ms Jones said: “Absolutely not. If we don’t have the confidence in ourselves as a party and self-belief, then how on earth can we convince other people of that. When you look at the alternatives, we’ve got a Conservative and Liberal Democrat Government in London that is increasingly looking like the enemy of the people of Wales, and we’ve got a Welsh Labour Government in Wales that appears to be doing almost nothing at all.\n\n“We’re not looking to be the Opposition after the next election, we’re looking to be the Government.”\n\nMs Jones said she and her party members were being asked to recruit 10 new members before Christmas,\n\nPlaid currently has around 6,500 members. When asked whether she expected the party to have 65,000 members by Christmas, Ms Jones agreed that to hope for such an outcome would be over-ambitious.\n\nTwo AMs have already declared their intention to stand for the leadership – ex-party president and former Assembly Presiding Officer Lord Elis-Thomas and former Rural Affairs Minister Elin Jones. Others may follow."
