Plaid Cymru is a Welsh nationalist and social democratic political party in Wales that was founded on 5 August 1925. Pronounced "plide come-ree", Plaid Cymru advocated for Welsh independence from the United Kingdom, and it gained a strong following among voters on the western coastline of Wales. It won its first Parliament seat in 1966, and it rose to become the second-largest party in the 2011 and 2016 general elections. The party supported Welsh nationalism, regionalism, democratic socialism, social democracy, environmentalism, and membership in the European Union.
