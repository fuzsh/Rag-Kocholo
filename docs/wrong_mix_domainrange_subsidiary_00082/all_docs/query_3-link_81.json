        "meta_description": "Abstract. We introduce the coupled model of the Greenland glacial system IGLOO 1.0,\nincluding the polythermal ice sheet model SICOPOLIS (version 3.3) with hybrid\ndynamics, the model of basal hydrology HYDRO and a parameterization of\nsubmarine melt for marine-terminated outlet glaciers. The aim of this glacial\nsystem model is to gain a better understanding of the processes important for\nthe future contribution of the Greenland ice sheet to sea level rise under\nfuture climate change scenarios. The ice sheet is initialized via a\nrelaxation towards observed surface elevation, imposing the palaeo-surface\ntemperature over the last glacial cycle. As a present-day reference, we use\nthe 1961â1990 standard climatology derived from simulations of the regional\natmosphere model MAR with ERA reanalysis boundary conditions. For the\npalaeo-part of the spin-up, we add the temperature anomaly derived from the\nGRIP ice core to the years 1961â1990 average surface temperature field. For\nour projections, we apply surface temperature and surface mass balance\nanomalies derived from RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios created by MAR with\nboundary conditions from simulations with three CMIP5 models. The hybrid ice\nsheet model is fully coupled with the model of basal hydrology. With this\nmodel and the MAR scenarios, we perform simulations to estimate the\ncontribution of the Greenland ice sheet to future sea level rise until the\nend of the 21st and 23rd centuries. Further on, the impact of\nelevationâsurface mass balance feedback, introduced via the MAR data, on\nfuture sea level rise is inspected. In our projections, we found the\nGreenland ice sheet to contribute between 1.9 and\n13.0âcm to global sea level rise until the year 2100 and between 3.5 and 76.4âcm until the year\n2300, including our simulated additional sea level rise due to\nelevationâsurface mass balance feedback. Translated into additional sea\nlevel rise, the strength of this feedback in the year 2100 varies from 0.4 to\n1.7âcm, and in the year 2300 it ranges from 1.7 to 21.8âcm. Additionally,\ntaking the Helheim and Store glaciers as examples, we investigate the role of\nocean warming and surface runoff\nchange for the melting of outlet glaciers.\nIt shows that ocean temperature and subglacial discharge are about equally\nimportant for the melting of the examined outlet glaciers.",

We highlight here the Antarctic glaciers showing the largest changes and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in their future evolution using an ensemble of ice flow models. We show that on top of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, Totten and Moscow University glaciers show rapid changes and a strong sensitivity to warmer ocean conditions.\n\nThe future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Anthony Payne, Eric Larour, Helene Seroussi, William H.

This study presents an ensemble of model simulations of the Antarctic evolution over the 2015–2100 period based on various ice sheet models, climate forcings and emission scenarios. Results suggest that the West Antarctic ice sheet will continue losing a large amount of ice, while the East Antarctic ice sheet could experience increased snow accumulation.\n\nProjecting Antarctica's contribution to future sea level rise from basal ice shelf melt using linear response functions of 16 ice sheet models (LARMIP-2)\n\nAnders Levermann, Ricarda Winkelmann, Torsten Albrecht, Heiko Goelzer, Nicholas R.

The full uncertainty range in the warming-related forcing of basal melt is estimated and applied to 16 state-of-the-art ice sheet models using a linear response theory approach. The sea level contribution we obtain is very likely below 61 cm under unmitigated climate change until 2100 (RCP8.5) and very likely below 40 cm if the Paris Climate Agreement is kept.\n\nModeling the response of Greenland outlet glaciers to global warming using a coupled flow lineâplume model\n\nJohanna Beckmann, MahÃ© Perrette, Sebastian Beyer, Reinhard Calov, Matteo Willeit, and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2281–2301, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2281-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2281-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSubmarine melting (SM) has been discussed as potentially triggering the recently observed retreat at outlet glaciers in Greenland. How much it may contribute in terms of future sea level rise (SLR) has not been quantified yet. When accounting for SM in our experiments, SLR contribution of 12 outlet glaciers increases by over 3-fold until the year 2100 under RCP8.5. Scaling up from 12 to all of Greenland's outlet glaciers increases future SLR contribution of Greenland by 50 %.\n\nDesign and results of the ice sheet model initialisation experiments initMIP-Greenland: an ISMIP6 intercomparison\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Tamsin Edwards, Matthew Beckley, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Andy Aschwanden, Reinhard Calov, Olivier Gagliardini, Fabien Gillet-Chaulet, Nicholas R.

Compared to earlier community-wide comparisons, we find better agreement across different models, which implies overall improvement of our understanding of what is needed to produce such initial states.\n\nSimulating the Greenland ice sheet under present-day and palaeo constraints including a new discharge parameterization\n\nR. Calov, A. Robinson, M. Perrette, and A. Ganopolski\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 179–196, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-179-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-179-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce discharge into the ocean from outlet glaciers is an important component of mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet. Here, we present a simple parameterization of ice discharge for coarse resolution ice sheet models, suitable for large ensembles or long-term palaeo simulations. This parameterization reproduces in a good approximation the present-day ice discharge compared with estimates, and the simulation of the present-day ice sheet elevation is considerably improved.\n\nImproved basal drag of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet from L-curve analysis of inverse models utilizing subglacial hydrology simulations\n\nLea-Sophie HÃ¶yns, Thomas Kleiner, Andreas Rademacher, Martin RÃ¼ckamp, Michael Wolovick, and Angelika Humbert\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1251,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1251, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers' sliding over bedrock is governed by water pressure in the hydrological system underneath the glacier and the roughness of the land underneath the glacier. We estimate this roughness using a modelling approach, which optimises this unknown parameter. The water pressure is simulated, too, which improves the robustness of the computed drag at the ice sheet base. We provide this data to other modellers and scientists doing geophysical field observations.\n\nGlobal biome changes over the last 21,000 years inferred from model-data comparisons\n\nChenzhi Li, Anne Dallmeyer, Jian Ni, Manuel Chevalier, Matteo Willeit, Andrei A.

We identified strong deviations between pollen- and model-derived megabiome distributions in the circum-Arctic areas and Tibetan Plateau during the Last Glacial Maximum and early deglaciation, as well as in North Africa and the Mediterranean regions during the Holocene.\n\nAssessing the benefits of approximately exact step sizes for Picard and Newton solver in simulating ice flow (FEniCS-full-Stokes v.1.3.2)\n\nNiko Schmidt, Angelika Humbert, and Thomas Slawig\n\nGeosci.

The melting and acceleration of glaciers plays a major role in sea-level change. Computer simulation of glaciers costs a lot of computational resources. In this publication, we test a new way of simulating glaciers. This approach produces the same results but has the advantage that it needs much less computation time. As simulations can be obtained with fewer computation resources, higher resolution and physics become affordable.\n\nSupraglacial lake drainage through gullies and fractures\n\nAngelika Humbert, Veit Helm, Ole Zeising, Niklas Neckel, Matthias H.

The lake is emptying rapidly. The water flows to the base of the glacier through cracks and gullies that remain visible over years. Some of them become reactive. We find features inside the glacier that stem from the drainage events with even 1 km width. These features are persistent over the years, although they are changing in shape.\n\nNew estimation of critical insolationâCO2 relationship for triggering glacial inception\n\nStefanie Talento, Matteo Willeit, and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nClim. Past, 20, 1349–1364, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1349-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1349-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo trigger glacial inception, the summer maximum insolation at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere must be lower than a critical value. This value is not constant but depends on the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Paleoclimatic data do not give enough information to derive the relationship between the critical threshold and CO2. However, knowledge of such a relation is important for predicting future glaciations and the impact anthropogenic CO2 emissions might have on them.\n\nGeneralized stability landscape of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\n\nMatteo Willeit and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1482,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1482, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a fast Earth system model we trace the stability landscape of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the combined freshwater forcing – atmospheric CO2 space. We find four different AMOC states that are stable under different conditions and a generally increasing equilibrium AMOC strength with increasing CO2 concentrations.\n\nAssessing supraglacial lake depth using ICESat-2, Sentinel-2, TanDEM-X, and in situ sonar measurements over Northeast Greenland\n\nKatrina Lutz, Lily Bever, Christian Sommer, Angelika Humbert, Mirko Scheinert, and Matthias Braun\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1244,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1244, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe estimation of the amount of water found within supraglacial lakes is important for understanding the amount of water lost from glaciers each year. Here, we develop two new methods for estimating supraglacial lake volume that can be easily applied on a large scale. Furthermore, we compare these methods to two previously developed methods in order to determine when is best to use each method. Finally, three of these methods are applied to peak melt dates over an area in Northeast Greenland.\n\nThe atmosphere-land/ice-ocean system in the region near the 79N Glacier in Northeast Greenland: Synthesis and key findings from GROCE\n\nTorsten Kanzow, Angelika Humbert, Thomas MÃ¶lg, Mirko Scheinert, Matthias Braun, Hans Burchard, Francesca Doglioni, Philipp Hochreuther, Martin Horwath, Oliver Huhn, JÃ¼rgen Kusche, Erik Loebel, Katrina Lutz, Ben Marzeion, Rebecca McPherson, Mahdi Mohammadi-Aragh, Marco MÃ¶ller, Carolyne Pickler, Markus Reinert, Monika Rhein, Martin RÃ¼ckamp, Janin Schaffer, Muhammad Shafeeque, Sophie Stolzenberger, Ralph Timmermann, Jenny Turton, Claudia Wekerle, and Ole Zeising\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-757,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-757, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet represents the second-largest contributor to global sea-level rise. We quantify atmosphere, ice and ocean-based processes related to the mass balance of glaciers in Northeast Greenland, focusing on Greenland’s largest floating ice tongue, the 79N Glacier. We find that together, the different in situ and remote sensing observations and model simulations to reveal a consistent picture of a coupled atmosphere-ice sheet-ocean system, that has entered a phase of major change.\n\nMulti-year simulations at kilometre scale with the Integrated Forecasting System coupled to FESOM2.5/NEMOv3.4\n\nThomas Rackow, Xabier Pedruzo-Bagazgoitia, Tobias Becker, Sebastian Milinski, Irina Sandu, Razvan Aguridan, Peter Bechtold, Sebastian Beyer, Jean Bidlot, Souhail Boussetta, Michail Diamantakis, Peter Dueben, Emanuel Dutra, Richard Forbes, Helge F.

The new model aims to provide globally consistent information on local climate change with greater precision, benefiting environmental planning and local impact modelling.\n\nSurface buoyancy control of millennial-scale variations of the Atlantic meridional ocean circulation\n\nMatteo Willeit, Andrey Ganopolski, Neil R.

This newly defined buoyancy measure explains why millenial-scale climate variability arising from abrupt changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation occurred for mid-glacial conditions but not for interglacial or full glacial conditions.\n\nExtreme melting at Greenland's largest floating ice tongue\n\nOle Zeising, Niklas Neckel, Nils DÃ¶rr, Veit Helm, Daniel Steinhage, Ralph Timmermann, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1333–1357, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1333-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1333-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe 79° North Glacier in Greenland has experienced significant changes over the last decades. Due to extreme melt rates, the ice has thinned significantly in the vicinity of the grounding line, where a large subglacial channel has formed since 2010. We attribute these changes to warm ocean currents and increased subglacial discharge from surface melt. However, basal melting has decreased since 2018, indicating colder water inflow into the cavity below the glacier.\n\nGlacial inception through rapid ice area increase driven by albedo and vegetation feedbacks\n\nMatteo Willeit, Reinhard Calov, Stefanie Talento, Ralf Greve, Jorjo Bernales, Volker Klemann, Meike Bagge, and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nClim.

Overall, our simulations confirm and refine previous results showing that climate-vegetation–cryosphere–carbon cycle feedbacks play a fundamental role in the transition from interglacial to glacial states.\n\nClimate tipping point interactions and cascades: a review\n\nNico Wunderling, Anna S. von der Heydt, Yevgeny Aksenov, Stephen Barker, Robbin Bastiaansen, Victor Brovkin, Maura Brunetti, Victor Couplet, Thomas Kleinen, Caroline H.

We find indications that many of the interactions between tipping elements are destabilizing. This means that tipping cascades cannot be ruled out on centennial to millennial timescales at global warming levels between 1.5 and 2.0 °C or on shorter timescales if global warming surpasses 2.0 °C.\n\nToward generalized Milankovitch theoryÂ (GMT)\n\nAndrey Ganopolski\n\nClim. Past, 20, 151–185, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-151-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-151-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite significant progress in modelling Quaternary climate dynamics, a comprehensive theory of glacial cycles is still lacking. Here, using the results of model simulations and data analysis, I present a framework of the generalized Milankovitch theory (GMT), which further advances the concept proposed by Milutin Milankovitch over a century ago. The theory explains a number of facts which were not known during Milankovitch time's, such as the 100 kyr periodicity of the late Quaternary.\n\nSynchronization phenomena observed in glacialâinterglacial cycles simulated in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity\n\nTakahito Mitsui, Matteo Willeit, and Niklas Boers\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 1277–1294, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-1277-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-1277-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe glacial–interglacial cycles of the Quaternary exhibit 41 kyr periodicity before the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) around 1.2–0.8 Myr ago and ~100 kyr periodicity after that. The mechanism generating these periodicities remains elusive. Through an analysis of an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, CLIMBER-2, we show that the dominant periodicities of glacial cycles can be explained from the viewpoint of synchronization theory.\n\nInsights into the vulnerability of Antarctic glaciers from the ISMIP6 ice sheet model ensemble and associated uncertainty\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Vincent Verjans, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

We highlight here the Antarctic glaciers showing the largest changes and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in their future evolution using an ensemble of ice flow models. We show that on top of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, Totten and Moscow University glaciers show rapid changes and a strong sensitivity to warmer ocean conditions.\n\nRegularization and L-curves in ice sheet inverse models: a case study in the FilchnerâRonne catchment\n\nMichael Wolovick, Angelika Humbert, Thomas Kleiner, and Martin RÃ¼ckamp\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5027–5060, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5027-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5027-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe friction underneath ice sheets can be inferred from observed velocity at the top, but this inference requires smoothing. The selection of smoothing has been highly variable in the literature. Here we show how to rigorously select the best smoothing, and we show that the inferred friction converges towards the best knowable field as model resolution improves. We use this to learn about the best description of basal friction and to formulate recommended best practices for other modelers.\n\nA transient coupled general circulation model (CGCM) simulation of the past 3Â million years\n\nKyung-Sook Yun, Axel Timmermann, Sun-Seon Lee, Matteo Willeit, Andrey Ganopolski, and Jyoti Jadhav\n\nClim.

This study presents a newly developed code, CUAS-MPI, that simulates subglacial hydrology. It is designed for supercomputers and is hence a parallelized code. We measure the performance of this code for simulations of the entire Greenland Ice Sheet and find that the code works efficiently. Moreover, we validated the code to ensure the correctness of the solution. CUAS-MPI opens new possibilities for simulations of ice sheet hydrology.\n\nDeep-future climate change scenarios for site selection of nuclear waste disposal in Germany\n\nChristine Kaufhold and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nSaf.

We argue that the deep-future climate should be considered in the site selection process. A suite of possible future climates will be provided, using different emission scenarios. In low-emission scenarios, glacial cycles will quickly resume, changing subterranean stress and permafrost. In high-emission scenarios, the sea level will rise. Both regimes should be of interest to those working on nuclear waste disposal.\n\nAntarctic Bedmap data: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) sharing of 60 years of ice bed, surface, and thickness data\n\nAlice C.

We investigate how crack formation at the glacier's calving front has changed over the last decades by using satellite imagery and airborne data. The calving front is about to lose contact to stabilizing ice islands. Simulations show that the glacier will accelerate as a result of this, leading to an increase in ice discharge of more than 5.1 % if its calving front retreats by 46 %.\n\nThe Earth system model CLIMBER-X v1.0 â Part 2: The global carbon cycle\n\nMatteo Willeit, Tatiana Ilyina, Bo Liu, Christoph Heinze, MahÃ© Perrette, Malte Heinemann, Daniela Dalmonech, Victor Brovkin, Guy Munhoven, Janine BÃ¶rker, Jens Hartmann, Gibran Romero-Mujalli, and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nGeosci.

The model can be run with interactive atmospheric CO2 to investigate the feedbacks between climate and the carbon cycle on temporal scales ranging from decades to > 100 000 years. CLIMBER-X is expected to be a useful tool for studying past climate–carbon cycle changes and for the investigation of the long-term future evolution of the Earth system.\n\nAWI-ICENet1: A convolutional neural network retracker for ice altimetry\n\nVeit Helm, Alireza Dehghanpour, Ronny HÃ¤nsch, Erik Loebel, Martin Horwath, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-80,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-80, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for TC\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe presents a new approach (AWI-ICENet1) to analyse satellite radar altimetry measurements for an accurate determination of the surface height of ice sheets, which is based on a convolutional neural network. The surface height estimated with AWI-ICENet1 and related products such as ice sheet height change and volume change show improved and unbiased results compared to other products. This is important for long-term monitoring of ice sheet mass loss and its contribution to sea level rise.\n\nDirect measurement of warm Atlantic Intermediate Water close to the grounding line of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79Â° N) Glacier, northeast Greenland\n\nMichael J. Bentley, James A. Smith, Stewart S. R. Jamieson, Margaret R. Lindeman, Brice R. Rea, Angelika Humbert, Timothy P. Lane, Christopher M. Darvill, Jeremy M. Lloyd, Fiamma Straneo, Veit Helm, and David H. Roberts\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1821–1837, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1821-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1821-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Northeast Greenland Ice Stream is a major outlet of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Some of its outlet glaciers and ice shelves have been breaking up and retreating, with inflows of warm ocean water identified as the likely reason. Here we report direct measurements of warm ocean water in an unusual lake that is connected to the ocean beneath the ice shelf in front of the 79Â° N Glacier. This glacier has not yet shown much retreat, but the presence of warm water makes future retreat more likely.\n\nCalving front monitoring at sub-seasonal resolution: a deep learning application to Greenland glaciers\n\nErik Loebel, Mirko Scheinert, Martin Horwath, Angelika Humbert, Julia Sohn, Konrad Heidler, Charlotte Liebezeit, and Xiao Xiang Zhu\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-52,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-52, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for TC\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComprehensive data sets of calving front change are essential to study and model outlet glaciers. Current records are limited in temporal resolution as they rely on manual delineation. We apply deep learning to automatically delineate calving fronts of 23 Greenland glaciers. Resulting time series resolve long-term, seasonal and sub-seasonal patterns. We discuss the implications of our results and provide the cryosphere community with a data product and an implementation of our processing system.\n\nImproved estimation of the bulk ice crystal fabric asymmetry from polarimetric phase co-registration\n\nOle Zeising, Tamara Annina Gerber, Olaf Eisen, M. Reza Ershadi, Nicolas Stoll, Ilka Weikusat, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1097–1105, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1097-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1097-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe flow of glaciers and ice streams is influenced by crystal fabric orientation. Besides sparse ice cores, these can be investigated by radar measurements. Here, we present an improved method which allows us to infer the horizontal fabric asymmetry using polarimetric phase-sensitive radar data. A validation of the method on a deep ice core from the Greenland Ice Sheet shows an excellent agreement, which is a large improvement over previously used methods.\n\nOn the evolution of an ice shelf melt channel at the base of Filchner Ice Shelf, from observations and viscoelastic modeling\n\nAngelika Humbert, Julia Christmann, Hugh F. J. Corr, Veit Helm, Lea-Sophie HÃ¶yns, Coen Hofstede, Ralf MÃ¼ller, Niklas Neckel, Keith W. Nicholls, Timm Schultz, Daniel Steinhage, Michael Wolovick, and Ole Zeising\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4107–4139, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4107-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4107-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce shelves are normally flat structures that fringe the Antarctic continent. At some locations they have channels incised into their underside. On Filchner Ice Shelf, such a channel is more than 50 km long and up to 330 m high. We conducted field measurements of basal melt rates and found a maximum of 2 m yr−1. Simulations represent the geometry evolution of the channel reasonably well. There is no reason to assume that this type of melt channel is destabilizing ice shelves.\n\nThe Earth system model CLIMBER-X v1.0 â Part 1: Climate model description and validationââââââââââââââ\n\nMatteo Willeit, Andrey Ganopolski, Alexander Robinson, and Neil R. Edwards\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 5905–5948, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5905-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5905-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we present the climate component of the newly developed fast Earth system model CLIMBER-X. It has a horizontal resolution of 5Â°x5Â° and is designed to simulate the evolution of the Earth system on temporal scales ranging from decades to >100 000 years. CLIMBER-X is available as open-source code and is expected to be a useful tool for studying past climate changes and for the investigation of the long-term future evolution of the climate.\n\nA scalability study of the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM, version 4.18)\n\nYannic Fischler, Martin RÃ¼ckamp, Christian Bischof, Vadym Aizinger, Mathieu Morlighem, and Angelika Humbert\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 3753–3771, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3753-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3753-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce sheet models are used to simulate the changes of ice sheets in future but are currently often run in coarse resolution and/or with neglecting important physics to make them affordable in terms of computational costs. We conducted a study simulating the Greenland Ice Sheet in high resolution and adequate physics to test where the ISSM ice sheet code is using most time and what could be done to improve its performance for future computer architectures that allow massive parallel computing.\n\nPolarimetric radar reveals the spatial distribution of ice fabric at domes and divides in East Antarctica\n\nM. Reza Ershadi, Reinhard Drews, Carlos MartÃ­n, Olaf Eisen, Catherine Ritz, Hugh Corr, Julia Christmann, Ole Zeising, Angelika Humbert, and Robert Mulvaney\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1719–1739, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1719-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1719-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRadio waves transmitted through ice split up and inform us about the ice sheet interior and orientation of single ice crystals. This can be used to infer how ice flows and improve projections on how it will evolve in the future. Here we used an inverse approach and developed a new algorithm to infer ice properties from observed radar data. We applied this technique to the radar data obtained at two EPICA drilling sites, where ice cores were used to validate our results.\n\nComparison of ice dynamics using full-Stokes and BlatterâPattyn approximation: application to the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream\n\nMartin RÃ¼ckamp, Thomas Kleiner, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1675–1696, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1675-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1675-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a comparative modelling study between the full-Stokes (FS) and Blatter–Pattyn (BP) approximation applied to the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream. Both stress regimes are implemented in one single ice sheet code to eliminate numerical issues. The simulations unveil minor differences in the upper ice stream but become considerable at the grounding line of the 79° North Glacier. Model differences are stronger for a power-law friction than a linear friction law.\n\nBasal melt of the southern Filchner Ice Shelf, Antarctica\n\nOle Zeising, Daniel Steinhage, Keith W. Nicholls, Hugh F. J. Corr, Craig L. Stewart, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1469–1482, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1469-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1469-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRemote-sensing-derived basal melt rates of ice shelves are of great importance due to their capability to cover larger areas. We performed in situ measurements with a phase-sensitive radar on the southern Filchner Ice Shelf, showing moderate melt rates and low small-scale spatial variability. The comparison with remote-sensing-based melt rates revealed large differences caused by the estimation of vertical strain rates from remote sensing velocity fields that modern fields can overcome.\n\nOn the contribution of grain boundary sliding type creep to firn densification â an assessment using an optimization approach\n\nTimm Schultz, Ralf MÃ¼ller, Dietmar Gross, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 143–158, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-143-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-143-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFirn is the interstage product between snow and ice. Simulations describing the process of firn densification are used in the context of estimating mass changes of the ice sheets and past climate reconstructions. The first stage of firn densification takes place in the upper few meters of the firn column. We investigate how well a material law describing the process of grain boundary sliding works for the numerical simulation of firn densification in this stage.\n\nReduced-complexity model for the impact of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on future glacial cycles\n\nStefanie Talento and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 1275–1293, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1275-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1275-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe propose a model for glacial cycles and produce an assessment of possible trajectories for the next 1 million years. Under natural conditions, the next glacial inception would most likely occur ∼50 kyr after present. We show that fossil-fuel CO2 releases can have an extremely long-term effect. Potentially achievable CO2 anthropogenic emissions during the next centuries will most likely provoke ice-free conditions in the Northern Hemisphere landmasses throughout the next half a million years.\n\nThe 21st-century fate of the Mocho-Choshuenco ice cap in southern Chile\n\nMatthias Scheiter, Marius Schaefer, Eduardo FlÃ¡ndez, Deniz Bozkurt, and Ralf Greve\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3637–3654, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3637-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3637-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe simulate the current state and future evolution of the Mocho-Choshuenco ice cap in southern Chile (40°S, 72°W) with the ice-sheet model SICOPOLIS. Under different global warming scenarios, we project ice mass losses between 56 % and 97 % by the end of the 21st century. We quantify the uncertainties based on an ensemble of climate models and on the temperature dependence of the equilibrium line altitude. Our results suggest a considerable deglaciation in southern Chile in the next 80 years.\n\nIndication of high basal melting at the EastGRIP drill site on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream\n\nOle Zeising and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3119–3128, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3119-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3119-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGreenlandâs largest ice stream – the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) – extends far into the interior of the ice sheet. Basal meltwater acts as a lubricant for glaciers and sustains sliding. Hence, observations of basal melt rates are of high interest. We performed two time series of precise ground-based radar measurements in the upstream region of NEGIS and found high melt rates of 0.19 Â± 0.04 m per year.\n\nEvidence for a grounding line fan at the onset of a basal channel under the ice shelf of Support Force Glacier, Antarctica, revealed by reflection seismics\n\nCoen Hofstede, Sebastian Beyer, Hugh Corr, Olaf Eisen, Tore Hattermann, Veit Helm, Niklas Neckel, Emma C. Smith, Daniel Steinhage, Ole Zeising, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1517–1535, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1517-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1517-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSupport Force Glacier rapidly flows into Filcher Ice Shelf of Antarctica. As we know little about this glacier and its subglacial drainage, we used seismic energy to map the transition area from grounded to floating ice where a drainage channel enters the ocean cavity. Soft sediments close to the grounding line are probably transported by this drainage channel. The constant ice thickness over the steeply dipping seabed of the ocean cavity suggests a stable transition and little basal melting.\n\nFuture sea level contribution from Antarctica inferred from CMIP5 model forcing and its dependence on precipitation ansatz\n\nChristian B. Rodehacke, Madlene Pfeiffer, Tido Semmler, ÃzgÃ¼r Gurses, and Thomas Kleiner\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 1153–1194, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1153-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1153-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the warmer future, Antarctica's ice sheet will lose more ice due to enhanced iceberg calving and a warming ocean that melts more floating ice from below. However, the hydrological cycle is also stronger in a warmer world. Hence, more snowfall will precipitate on Antarctica and may balance the amplified ice loss. We have used future climate scenarios from various global climate models to perform numerous ice sheet simulations to show that precipitation may counteract mass loss.\n\nPossible impacts of a 1000 km long hypothetical subglacial river valley towards Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland\n\nChristopher Chambers, Ralf Greve, Bas Altena, and Pierre-Marie Lefeuvre\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3747–3759, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3747-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3747-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe topography of the rock below the Greenland ice sheet is not well known. One long valley appears as a line of dips because of incomplete data. So we use ice model simulations that unblock this valley, and these create a watercourse that may represent a form of river over 1000 km long under the ice. When we melt ice at the bottom of the ice sheet only in the deep interior, water can flow down the valley only when the valley is unblocked. It may have developed while an ice sheet was present.\n\nSensitivity of Greenland ice sheet projections to spatial resolution in higher-order simulations: the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) contribution to ISMIP6 Greenland using the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM)\n\nMartin RÃ¼ckamp, Heiko Goelzer, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3309–3327, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3309-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3309-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEstimates of future sea-level contribution from the Greenland ice sheet have a large uncertainty based on different origins. We conduct numerical experiments to test the sensitivity of Greenland ice sheet projections to spatial resolution. Simulations with a higher resolution unveil up to 5 &percnt; more sea-level rise compared to coarser resolutions. The sensitivity depends on the magnitude of outlet glacier retreat. When no retreat is enforced, the sensitivity exhibits an inverse behaviour.\n\nExtended enthalpy formulations in the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) version 4.17: discontinuous conductivity and anisotropic streamline upwind PetrovâGalerkin (SUPG) method\n\nMartin RÃ¼ckamp, Angelika Humbert, Thomas Kleiner, Mathieu Morlighem, and Helene Seroussi\n\nGeosci.

A first experiment indicates that the treatment of discontinuous conductivities of the solid–fluid system with a geometric mean produce accurate results when applied to coarse vertical resolutions. In a second experiment, we propose a novel stabilization formulation that avoids the problem of thin elements. This method provides accurate and stable results.\n\nThe future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Anthony Payne, Eric Larour, Helene Seroussi, William H.

The results for two different greenhouse gas concentration scenarios indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass until 2100, with contributions to sea-level rise of 90 Â± 50 mm and 32 Â± 17 mm for the high (RCP8.5) and low (RCP2.6) scenario, respectively.\n\nISMIP6 Antarctica: a multi-model ensemble of the Antarctic ice sheet evolution over the 21st century\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

This study presents an ensemble of model simulations of the Antarctic evolution over the 2015–2100 period based on various ice sheet models, climate forcings and emission scenarios. Results suggest that the West Antarctic ice sheet will continue losing a large amount of ice, while the East Antarctic ice sheet could experience increased snow accumulation.\n\nOverview: Integrative and Comprehensive Understanding on Polar Environments (iCUPE) â concept and initial results\n\nTuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Ella-Maria Duplissy, Ksenia Tabakova, Julia Schmale, Barbara AltstÃ¤dter, Gerard Ancellet, Mikhail Arshinov, Yurii Balin, Urs Baltensperger, Jens Bange, Alison Beamish, Boris Belan, Antoine Berchet, Rossana Bossi, Warren R.

MISMIP+ is one in a series of exercises that test numerical models of ice sheet flow in simple situations. This particular exercise concentrates on the response of ice sheet models to the thinning of their floating ice shelves, which is of interest because numerical models are currently used to model the response to contemporary and near-future thinning in Antarctic ice shelves.\n\nThe Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimeter (CRISTAL) high-priority candidate mission\n\nMichael Kern, Robert Cullen, Bruno Berruti, Jerome Bouffard, Tania Casal, Mark R.

It relies on the source transformation algorithmic (AD) differentiation tool OpenAD. The reverse mode of AD provides the adjoint model, SICOPOLIS-AD, which may be applied for comprehensive sensitivity analyses as well as gradient-based optimization.\n\nProjecting Antarctica's contribution to future sea level rise from basal ice shelf melt using linear response functions of 16 ice sheet models (LARMIP-2)\n\nAnders Levermann, Ricarda Winkelmann, Torsten Albrecht, Heiko Goelzer, Nicholas R.

Dynam., 11, 35–76, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-35-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-35-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide an estimate of the future sea level contribution of Antarctica from basal ice shelf melting up to the year 2100. The full uncertainty range in the warming-related forcing of basal melt is estimated and applied to 16 state-of-the-art ice sheet models using a linear response theory approach. The sea level contribution we obtain is very likely below 61 cm under unmitigated climate change until 2100 (RCP8.5) and very likely below 40 cm if the Paris Climate Agreement is kept.\n\nModeling the response of Greenland outlet glaciers to global warming using a coupled flow lineâplume model\n\nJohanna Beckmann, MahÃ© Perrette, Sebastian Beyer, Reinhard Calov, Matteo Willeit, and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2281–2301, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2281-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2281-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSubmarine melting (SM) has been discussed as potentially triggering the recently observed retreat at outlet glaciers in Greenland. How much it may contribute in terms of future sea level rise (SLR) has not been quantified yet. When accounting for SM in our experiments, SLR contribution of 12 outlet glaciers increases by over 3-fold until the year 2100 under RCP8.5. Scaling up from 12 to all of Greenland's outlet glaciers increases future SLR contribution of Greenland by 50 %.\n\nModelling the Antarctic Ice Sheet across the mid-Pleistocene transition â implications for Oldest Ice\n\nJohannes Sutter, Hubertus Fischer, Klaus Grosfeld, Nanna B. Karlsson, Thomas Kleiner, Brice Van Liefferinge, and Olaf Eisen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2023–2041, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2023-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2023-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Antarctic Ice Sheet may have played an important role in moderating the transition between warm and cold climate epochs over the last million years. We find that the Antarctic Ice Sheet grew considerably about 0.9 Myr ago, a time when ice-age–warm-age cycles changed from a 40 000 to a 100 000 year periodicity. Our findings also suggest that ice as old as 1.5 Myr still exists at the bottom of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet despite the major climate reorganisations in the past.\n\nAge stratigraphy in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet inferred from radio-echo sounding horizons\n\nAnna Winter, Daniel Steinhage, Timothy T.

Results are improved compared to previous assessments and show that continued improvements in the representation of the floating ice around Antarctica are critical to reduce the uncertainty in the future ice sheet contribution to sea level rise.\n\nA confinedâunconfined aquifer model for subglacial hydrology and its application to the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream\n\nSebastian Beyer, Thomas Kleiner, Vadym Aizinger, Martin RÃ¼ckamp, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3931–3947, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3931-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3931-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe evolution of subglacial channels below ice sheets is very important for the dynamics of glaciers as the water acts as a lubricant. We present a new numerical model (CUAS) that generalizes existing approaches by accounting for two different flow situations within a single porous medium layer: (1) a confined aquifer if sufficient water supply is available and (2) an unconfined aquifer, otherwise. The model is applied to artificial scenarios as well as to the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream.\n\nThe effect of overshooting 1.5 Â°C global warming on the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet\n\nMartin RÃ¼ckamp, Ulrike Falk, Katja Frieler, Stefan Lange, and Angelika Humbert\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 9, 1169–1189, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-1169-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-1169-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSea-level rise associated with changing climate is expected to pose a major challenge for societies. Based on the efforts of COP21 to limit global warming to 2.0 °C by the end of the 21st century (Paris Agreement), we simulate the future contribution of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) to sea-level change. The projected sea-level rise ranges between 21–38 mm by 2100 and 36–85 mm by 2300. Our results indicate that uncertainties in the projections stem from the underlying climate data.\n\nThe importance of snow albedo for ice sheet evolution over the last glacial cycle\n\nMatteo Willeit and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nClim. Past, 14, 697–707, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-697-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-697-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe surface energy and mass balance of ice sheets strongly depends on surface albedo. Here, using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, we explore the role played by surface albedo for the simulation of glacial cycles. We show that the evolution of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets over the last glacial cycle is very sensitive to the parameterization of snow grain size and the effect of dust deposition on snow albedo.\n\nDesign and results of the ice sheet model initialisation experiments initMIP-Greenland: an ISMIP6 intercomparison\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Tamsin Edwards, Matthew Beckley, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Andy Aschwanden, Reinhard Calov, Olivier Gagliardini, Fabien Gillet-Chaulet, Nicholas R.

Compared to earlier community-wide comparisons, we find better agreement across different models, which implies overall improvement of our understanding of what is needed to produce such initial states.\n\nSimple models for the simulation of submarine melt for a Greenland glacial system model\n\nJohanna Beckmann, MahÃ© Perrette, and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 301–323, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-301-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-301-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGreenland's glaciers that are in contact with the ocean undergo a special ice–ocean melting. To project numerically Greenland's centennial contribution to sea level rise, it is crucial to incorporate this special melting. We demonstrate that a numerically cheap model shows the qualitative same behavior as numerical expensive 2–3-dimensional models and calculates the same melting as empirical data show. Our analytical solution gives some insight in the yet poorly understood melting behavior.\n\nSimulation of climate, ice sheets and CO2 evolution during the last four glacial cycles with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity\n\nAndrey Ganopolski and Victor Brovkin\n\nClim. Past, 13, 1695–1716, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-13-1695-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-13-1695-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce cores reveal that atmospheric CO2 concentration varied synchronously with the global ice volume. Explaining the mechanism of glacial–interglacial variations of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the link between CO2 and ice sheets evolution still remains a challenge. Here using the Earth system model of intermediate complexity we performed for the first time simulations of co-evolution of climate, ice sheets and carbon cycle using the astronomical forcing as the only external forcing.\n\nRegional modeling of the Shirase drainage basin, East Antarctica: full Stokes vs. shallow ice dynamics\n\nHakime Seddik, Ralf Greve, Thomas Zwinger, and Shin Sugiyama\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2213–2229, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2213-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2213-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Shirase Glacier in Antarctica is studied by means of a computer model. This model implements two physical approaches to represent the glacier flow dynamics. This study finds that it is important to use the more precise and sophisticated method in order to better understand and predict the evolution of fast flowing glaciers. This may be important to more accurately predict the sea level change due to global warming.\n\nComparison of surface mass balance of ice sheets simulated by positive-degree-day method and energy balance approach\n\nEva Bauer and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nClim. Past, 13, 819–832, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-13-819-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-13-819-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTransient glacial cycle simulations with an EMIC and the PDD method require smaller melt factors for inception than for termination and larger factors for American than European ice sheets. The PDD online method with standard values simulates a sea level drop of 250 m at the LGM. The PDD online run reproducing the LGM ice volume has deficient ablation for reversing from glacial to interglacial climate, so termination is delayed. The SEB method with dust impact on snow albedo is seen as superior.\n\nSEMIC: an efficient surface energy and mass balance model applied to the Greenland ice sheet\n\nMario Krapp, Alexander Robinson, and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1519–1535, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1519-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1519-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the snowpack model SEMIC. It calculates snow height, surface temperature, surface albedo, and the surface mass balance of snow- and ice-covered surfaces while using meteorological data as input. In this paper we describe how SEMIC works and how well it compares with snowpack data of a more sophisticated regional climate model applied to the Greenland ice sheet. Because of its simplicity and efficiency, SEMIC can be used as a coupling interface between atmospheric and ice sheet models.\n\nDynamic changes on the Wilkins Ice Shelf during the 2006â2009 retreat derived from satellite observations\n\nMelanie Rankl, Johannes Jakob FÃ¼rst, Angelika Humbert, and Matthias Holger Braun\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1199–1211, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1199-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1199-2017, 2017\n\nMarine ice sheet model performance depends on basal sliding physics and sub-shelf melting\n\nRupert Michael Gladstone, Roland Charles Warner, Benjamin Keith Galton-Fenzi, Olivier Gagliardini, Thomas Zwinger, and Ralf Greve\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 319–329, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-319-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-319-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComputer models are used to simulate the behaviour of glaciers and ice sheets. It has been found that such models are required to be run at very high resolution (which means high computational expense) in order to accurately represent the evolution of marine ice sheets (ice sheets resting on bedrock below sea level), in certain situations which depend on sub-glacial physical processes.\n\nComparison of hybrid schemes for the combination ofÂ shallowÂ approximations in numerical simulationsÂ ofÂ theÂ AntarcticÂ IceÂ Sheet\n\nJorge Bernales, Irina Rogozhina, Ralf Greve, and Maik Thomas\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 247–265, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-247-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-247-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study offers a hard test to the models commonly used to simulate an ice sheet evolution over multimillenial timescales. Using an example of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, we evaluate the performance of such models against observations and highlight a strong impact of different approaches towards modeling rapidly flowing ice sectors. In particular, our results show that inferences of previous studies may need significant adjustments to be adopted by a different type of ice sheet models.\n\nPALADYN v1.0, a comprehensive land surfaceâvegetationâcarbon cycle model of intermediate complexity\n\nMatteo Willeit and Andrey Ganopolski\n\nGeosci.

We provide an explanation for characteristic dip and ridge features found at the edges of many subglacial lakes and conclude that draining lakes can result in travelling waves at depth within isochrones, thus indicating the possibility of detecting past drainage events with ice penetrating radar.\n\nModelling calving front dynamics using a level-set method: application to Jakobshavn IsbrÃ¦, West Greenland\n\nJohannes H. Bondzio, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Mathieu Morlighem, Thomas Kleiner, Martin RÃ¼ckamp, Angelika Humbert, and Eric Y. Larour\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 497–510, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-497-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-497-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe implemented a level-set method in the ice sheet system model. This method allows us to dynamically evolve a calving front subject to user-defined calving rates. We apply the method to Jakobshavn IsbrÃ¦, West Greenland, and study its response to calving rate perturbations. We find its behaviour strongly dependent on the calving rate, which was to be expected. Both reduced basal drag and rheological shear margin weakening sustain the acceleration of this dynamic outlet glacier.\n\nIce sheet mass loss caused by dust and black carbon accumulation\n\nT. Goelles, C. E. BÃ¸ggild, and R. Greve\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 1845–1856, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1845-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1845-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoot (black carbon) and dust particles darken the surface of ice sheets and glaciers as they accumulate. This causes more ice to melt, which releases more particles from within the ice. This positive feedback mechanism is studied with a new two-dimensional model, mimicking the conditions of Greenland, under different climate warming scenarios. In the warmest scenario, the additional ice sheet mass loss until the year 3000 is up to 7%.\n\nCoupled Northern Hemisphere permafrostâice-sheet evolution over the last glacial cycle\n\nM.

We find that permafrost has a moderate but significant effect on ice sheet dynamics during the last glacial cycle. In particular at the Last Glacial Maximum the inclusion of permafrost leads to a 15m sea level equivalent increase in Northern Hemisphere ice volume when permafrost is included.\n\nMeasurement of the fracture toughness of polycrystalline bubbly ice from an Antarctic ice core\n\nJ.

Here, we present a simple parameterization of ice discharge for coarse resolution ice sheet models, suitable for large ensembles or long-term palaeo simulations. This parameterization reproduces in a good approximation the present-day ice discharge compared with estimates, and the simulation of the present-day ice sheet elevation is considerably improved.\n\nElevation and elevation change of Greenland and Antarctica derived from CryoSat-2\n\nV.

Our results reveal changes in firn between 2011–2019, aligning well with known climatic events. This approach can be used to outline firn areas primed for significantly changing future meltwater runoff.\n\nFirst results of the polar regional climate model RACMO2.4\n\nChristiaan T. van Dalum, Willem Jan van de Berg, Srinidhi N. Gadde, Maurice van Tiggelen, Tijmen van der Drift, Erik van Meijgaard, Lambertus H. van Ulft, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-895,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-895, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new version of the polar regional climate model RACMO, version 2.4p1, and show first results for Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic. We provide an overview of all changes and investigate the impact that they have on the climate of polar regions. By comparing the results with observations and the output from the previous model version, we show that the model performs well regarding the surface mass balance of the ice sheets and near-surface climate.\n\nSubglacial valleys preserved in the highlands of south and east Greenland record restricted ice extent during past warmer climates\n\nGuy J. G. Paxman, Stewart S. R. Jamieson, Aisling M. Dolan, and Michael J. Bentley\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1467–1493, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1467-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1467-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses airborne radar data and satellite imagery to map mountainous topography hidden beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet. We find that the landscape records the former extent and configuration of ice masses that were restricted to areas of high topography. Computer models of ice flow indicate that valley glaciers eroded this landscape millions of years ago when local air temperatures were at least 4 °C higher than today and Greenland’s ice volume was < 10 % of that of the modern ice sheet.\n\nCoupling MAR (ModÃ¨le AtmosphÃ©rique RÃ©gional) with PISM (Parallel Ice Sheet Model) mitigates the positive meltâelevation feedback\n\nAlison Delhasse, Johanna Beckmann, Christoph Kittel, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 633–651, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-633-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-633-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAiming to study the long-term influence of an extremely warm climate in the Greenland Ice Sheet contribution to sea level rise, a new regional atmosphere–ice sheet model setup was established. The coupling, explicitly considering the melt–elevation feedback, is compared to an offline method to consider this feedback. We highlight mitigation of the feedback due to local changes in atmospheric circulation with changes in surface topography, making the offline correction invalid on the margins.\n\nCloud- and ice-albedo feedbacks drive greater Greenland Ice Sheet sensitivity to warming in CMIP6 than in CMIP5\n\nIdunn Aamnes Mostue, Stefan Hofer, Trude Storelvmo, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 475–488, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-475-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-475-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe latest generation of climate models (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 – CMIP6) warm more over Greenland and the Arctic and thus also project a larger mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) compared to the previous generation of climate models (CMIP5). Our work suggests for the first time that part of the greater mass loss in CMIP6 over the GrIS is driven by a difference in the surface mass balance sensitivity from a change in cloud representation in the CMIP6 models.\n\nEvaluating different geothermal heat-flow maps as basal boundary conditions during spin-up of the Greenland ice sheet\n\nTong Zhang, William Colgan, Agnes Wansing, Anja LÃ¸kkegaard, Gunter Leguy, William H. Lipscomb, and Cunde Xiao\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 387–402, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-387-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-387-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe geothermal heat flux determines how much heat enters from beneath the ice sheet, and thus impacts the temperature and the flow of the ice sheet. In this study we investigate how much geothermal heat flux impacts the initialization of the Greenland ice sheet. We use the Community Ice Sheet Model with two different initialization methods. We find a non-trivial influence of the choice of heat flow boundary conditions on the ice sheet initializations for further designs of ice sheet modeling.\n\nSeasonal evolution of the supraglacial drainage network at Humboldt Glacier, northern Greenland, between 2016 and 2020\n\nLauren D. Rawlins, David M. Rippin, Andrew J. Sole, Stephen J. Livingstone, and Kang Yang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4729–4750, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4729-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4729-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe map and quantify surface rivers and lakes at Humboldt Glacier to examine seasonal evolution and provide new insights of network configuration and behaviour. A widespread supraglacial drainage network exists, expanding up the glacier as seasonal runoff increases. Large interannual variability affects the areal extent of this network, controlled by high- vs. low-melt years, with late summer network persistence likely preconditioning the surface for earlier drainage activity the following year.\n\nChoice of observation type affects Bayesian calibration of Greenland Ice Sheet model simulations\n\nDenis Felikson, Sophie Nowicki, Isabel Nias, Beata Csatho, Anton Schenk, Michael J. Croteau, and Bryant Loomis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4661–4673, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4661-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4661-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe narrow the spread in model simulations of the Greenland Ice Sheet using velocity change, dynamic thickness change, and mass change observations. We find that the type of observation chosen can lead to significantly different calibrated probability distributions. Further work is required to understand how to best calibrate ensembles of ice sheet simulations because this will improve probability distributions of projected sea-level rise, which is crucial for coastal planning and adaptation.\n\nEffects of extreme melt events on ice flow and sea level rise of the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nJohanna Beckmann and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3083–3099, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3083-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3083-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOver the past decade, Greenland has experienced several extreme melt events. With progressing climate change, such extreme melt events can be expected to occur more frequently and potentially become more severe and persistent. Strong melt events may considerably contribute to Greenland's mass loss, which in turn strongly determines future sea level rise. How important these extreme melt events could be in the future is assessed in this study for the first time.\n\nPrecursor of disintegration of Greenland's largest floating ice tongue\n\nAngelika Humbert, Veit Helm, Niklas Neckel, Ole Zeising, Martin RÃ¼ckamp, Shfaqat Abbas Khan, Erik Loebel, JÃ¶rg Brauchle, Karsten Stebner, Dietmar Gross, Rabea Sondershaus, and Ralf MÃ¼ller\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2851–2870, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2851-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2851-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe largest floating glacier mass in Greenland, the 79Â° N Glacier, is showing signs of instability. We investigate how crack formation at the glacier's calving front has changed over the last decades by using satellite imagery and airborne data. The calving front is about to lose contact to stabilizing ice islands. Simulations show that the glacier will accelerate as a result of this, leading to an increase in ice discharge of more than 5.1 % if its calving front retreats by 46 %.\n\nAn evaluation of a physics-based firn model and a semi-empirical firn model across the Greenland Ice Sheet (1980â2020)\n\nMegan Thompson-Munson, Nander Wever, C. Max Stevens, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, and Brooke Medley\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2185–2209, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2185-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2185-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo better understand the Greenland Ice Sheetâs firn layer and its ability to buffer sea level rise by storing meltwater, we analyze firn density observations and output from two firn models. We find that both models, one physics-based and one semi-empirical, simulate realistic density and firn air content when compared to observations. The models differ in their representation of firn air content, highlighting the uncertainty in physical processes and the paucity of deep-firn measurements.\n\nCalving front monitoring at sub-seasonal resolution: a deep learning application to Greenland glaciers\n\nErik Loebel, Mirko Scheinert, Martin Horwath, Angelika Humbert, Julia Sohn, Konrad Heidler, Charlotte Liebezeit, and Xiao Xiang Zhu\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-52,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-52, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for TC\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComprehensive data sets of calving front change are essential to study and model outlet glaciers. Current records are limited in temporal resolution as they rely on manual delineation. We apply deep learning to automatically delineate calving fronts of 23 Greenland glaciers. Resulting time series resolve long-term, seasonal and sub-seasonal patterns. We discuss the implications of our results and provide the cryosphere community with a data product and an implementation of our processing system.\n\nSubglacial lake activity beneath the ablation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nYubin Fan, Chang-Qing Ke, Xiaoyi Shen, Yao Xiao, Stephen J. Livingstone, and Andrew J. Sole\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1775–1786, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1775-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1775-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used the new-generation ICESat-2 altimeter to detect and monitor active subglacial lakes in unprecedented spatiotemporal detail. We created a new inventory of 18 active subglacial lakes as well as their elevation and volume changes during 2019–2020, which provides an improved understanding of how the Greenland subglacial water system operates and how these lakes are fed by water from the ice surface.\n\nThe control of short-term ice mÃ©lange weakening episodes on calving activity at major Greenland outlet glaciers\n\nAdrien WehrlÃ©, Martin P. LÃ¼thi, and Andreas Vieli\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 309–326, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-309-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-309-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe characterized short-lived episodes of ice mÃ©lange weakening (IMW) at the front of three major Greenland outlet glaciers. Through a continuous detection at the front of Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier during the June-to-September period from 2018 to 2021, we found that 87 % of the IMW episodes occurred prior to a large-scale calving event. Using a simple model for ice mÃ©lange motion, we further characterized the IMW process as self-sustained through the existence of an IMW–calving feedback.\n\nWeekly to monthly terminus variability of Greenland's marine-terminating outlet glaciers\n\nTaryn E. Black and Ian Joughin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1–13, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe frontal positions of most ice-sheet-based glaciers in Greenland vary seasonally. On average, these glaciers begin retreating in May and begin advancing in October, and the difference between their most advanced and most retreated positions is 220 m. The timing may be related to the timing of melt on the ice sheet, and the seasonal length variation may be related to glacier speed. These seasonal variations can affect glacier behavior and, consequently, how much ice is lost from the ice sheet.\n\nThe contribution of Humboldt Glacier, northern Greenland, to sea-level rise through 2100 constrained by recent observations of speedup and retreat\n\nTrevor R. Hillebrand, Matthew J. Hoffman, Mauro Perego, Stephen F. Price, and Ian M. Howat\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4679–4700, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4679-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4679-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe estimate that Humboldt Glacier, northern Greenland, will contribute 5.2–8.7 mm to global sea level in 2007–2100, using an ensemble of model simulations constrained by observations of glacier retreat and speedup. This is a significant fraction of the 40–140 mm from the whole Greenland Ice Sheet predicted by the recent ISMIP6 multi-model ensemble, suggesting that calibrating models against observed velocity changes could result in higher estimates of 21st century sea-level rise from Greenland.\n\nObserved mechanism for sustained glacier retreat and acceleration in response to ocean warming around Greenland\n\nEvan Carnahan, Ginny Catania, and Timothy C. Bartholomaus\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4305–4317, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4305-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4305-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet primarily loses mass through increased ice discharge. We find changes in discharge from outlet glaciers are initiated by ocean warming, which causes a change in the balance of forces resisting gravity and leads to acceleration. Vulnerable conditions for sustained retreat and acceleration are predetermined by the glacier-fjord geometry and exist around Greenland, suggesting increases in ice discharge may be sustained into the future despite a pause in ocean warming.\n\nAssessing bare-ice albedo simulated by MAR over the Greenland ice sheet (2000â2021) and implications for meltwater production estimates\n\nRaf M. Antwerpen, Marco Tedesco, Xavier Fettweis, Patrick Alexander, and Willem Jan van de Berg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4185–4199, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4185-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4185-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ice on Greenland has been melting more rapidly over the last few years. Most of this melt comes from the exposure of ice when the overlying snow melts. This ice is darker than snow and absorbs more sunlight, leading to more melt. It remains challenging to accurately simulate the brightness of the ice. We show that the color of ice simulated by ModÃ¨le AtmosphÃ©rique RÃ©gional (MAR) is too bright. We then show that this means that MAR may underestimate how fast the Greenland ice is melting.\n\nDrill-site selection for cosmogenic-nuclide exposure dating of the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nJason P. Briner, Caleb K. Walcott, Joerg M. Schaefer, NicolÃ¡s E. Young, Joseph A. MacGregor, Kristin Poinar, Benjamin A. Keisling, Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Mary R. Albert, Tanner Kuhl, and Grant Boeckmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3933–3948, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3933-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3933-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe 7.4 m of sea level equivalent stored as Greenland ice is getting smaller every year. The uncertain trajectory of ice loss could be better understood with knowledge of the ice sheet's response to past climate change. Within the bedrock below the present-day ice sheet is an archive of past ice-sheet history. We analyze all available data from Greenland to create maps showing where on the ice sheet scientists can drill, using currently available drills, to obtain sub-ice materials.\n\nA new Level 4 multi-sensor ice surface temperature product for the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nIoanna Karagali, Magnus Barfod Suhr, Ruth Mottram, Pia Nielsen-Englyst, Gorm DybkjÃ¦r, Darren Ghent, and Jacob L. HÃ¸yer\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3703–3721, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3703-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3703-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce surface temperature (IST) products were used to develop the first multi-sensor, gap-free Level 4 (L4) IST product of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) for 2012, when a significant melt event occurred. For the melt season, mean IST was −15 to −1 °C, and almost the entire GIS experienced at least 1 to 5 melt days. Inclusion of the L4 IST to a surface mass budget (SMB) model improved simulated surface temperatures during the key onset of the melt season, where biases are typically large.\n\nHigh-resolution imaging of supraglacial hydrological features on the Greenland Ice Sheet with NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) instrument suite\n\nMichael Studinger, Serdar S. Manizade, Matthew A. Linkswiler, and James K. Yungel\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3649–3668, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3649-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3649-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe footprint density and high-resolution imagery of airborne surveys reveal details in supraglacial hydrological features that are currently not obtainable from spaceborne data. The accuracy and resolution of airborne measurements complement spaceborne measurements, can support calibration and validation of spaceborne methods, and provide information necessary for process studies of the hydrological system on ice sheets that currently cannot be achieved from spaceborne observations alone.\n\nThe impact of climate oscillations on "
