        "text": "Siva Veerapandy’s affinity for analytics, research and client devotion is a reflection of his career achievements and passion for lifetime learning. “I’m client-driven and data-driven,” he points out. “I’m also fortunate to have deep experience in equities research, trading applications, and corporate and investment banking. This gives me a perspective on market behavior and the value of serving distinct aspects of clients’ wealth.”\n\nLike Siva, clients are highly accomplished and place great importance on education and hard work. They include active and retired corporate executives who can benefit from Siva’s extensive knowledge of executive compensation plans, as well as physicians and generations of high-net-worth families in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and eighteen other states.\n\n“There’s a big difference between talking to clients and building relationships with them. I work to gain a firm grasp of clients’ personal and professional aspirations, what they need most, and ‘who’ a client really is. I believe my age and sensitivity to clients’ issues also help me facilitate meaningful discussions with clients and spouses, their children, and gather entire families for meetings. Superior wealth management requires my sincere effort and personal integrity,” Siva explains.\n\nSiva believes in taking a long-term approach to building risk managed investment strategies. Based on each client’s goals, time horizon, liquidity needs, and comfort with risk, he uses BofA and third-party research to formulate client portfolios that are evaluated over time, to align with tax-minimization and estate planning strategies he coordinates with clients’ CPAs and attorneys. Siva also pays close attention to clients’ liabilities – offering access to Bank of America N.A.\n\n“Rather than be reactive, I prefer to be proactive – calling clients frequently to update them and myself. Serving busy professionals is why I work around clients’ schedules, visiting them in their homes and offices. Being a caring financial advisor means that I’m approachable and available,” Siva adds.\n\nBefore joining Merrill Lynch Wealth Management in 2015, Siva spent over 15 years in the financial services industry working for firms like Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley where he began cultivating relationships with dozens of clients he serves today (including many who require his familiarity with executive compensation plans).\n\nSiva is proud to have built a loyal circle of referred client families – and to have earned the Chartered Financial Analyst® designation, an MBA in Finance from Temple University, and a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from PSG College of Technology in India. Siva and his wife reside in Newtown, Pennsylvania with their son and daughter. His passions include traveling, hiking, chess, swimming, and actively supporting charities that serve children in the United States and India.\n\nPractice Areas:\n\nWealth & Retirement Planning\n\nMulti-generational Trust & Estate Planning Services\n\nPortfolio Management & Risk Management\n\nAlternative Investments - Hedge Funds and Private Equity\n\nInsurance & Annuities\n\nAccess to Lending Services through Bank of America N.A.\n\n*Some or all alternative investment programs may not be in the best interest of certain investors.
