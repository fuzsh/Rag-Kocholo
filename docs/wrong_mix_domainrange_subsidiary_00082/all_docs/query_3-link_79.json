The image was selected as the cover of the Journal of Geophysics Research. Credit: Alan Dyer.\n\nA recent article published in Science News details the captivating yet mysterious phenomenon known as STEVE (Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement), a rare sky glow observed by citizen scientists like Alan Dyer in rural Alberta, Canada. Unlike traditional auroras, STEVE appears as a ribbon of mauve closer to the equator and exhibits unique characteristics. Dyer's high-resolution footage of STEVE provided scientists, particularly THEMIS researcher Toshi Nishimura from Boston University, with unprecedented details. The video revealed a flickering torrent of purplish-white fuzz that challenged existing understandings of atmospheric chemistry.\n\nScientists have been grappling with the enigmatic nature of STEVE since its introduction to the scientific community in 2016. While initially thought to be related to auroras, STEVE's distinct purple hue and different behavior have raised numerous questions about its origins and underlying mechanisms. Recent observations suggest a connection between STEVE and another atmospheric phenomenon called stable auroral red (SAR) arcs, indicating a complex interplay of factors contributing to STEVE's appearance.\n\nFurther complicating the understanding of STEVE is the discovery of its association with green stripes known as the \"picket fence,\" which was initially mistaken for a type of aurora. However, detailed analysis suggests that the picket fence's green glow may stem from different processes than traditional auroras, possibly involving atmospheric electric fields. Computer modeling and proposed rocket missions aim to shed light on these phenomena and confirm the existence of such electric fields.\n\nNASA's upcoming missions, including the Geospace Dynamics Constellation mission, hold promise for gathering more data to elucidate the mysteries surrounding STEVE and related atmospheric phenomena. Despite the challenges, citizen scientists like Dyer remain instrumental in capturing observations of STEVE from the ground, contributing valuable data that continue to puzzle and intrigue researchers in the field of space physics.\n\nSource:\n\nTemming, M. (2023), STEVE and other aurora-like glows perplex scientists with their complex physics, Science News, Published December 2023.\n\nCitation: Nishimura, Y., Dyer, A., Donovan, E. F., Angelopoulos, V.

Credit: G.Q. Yan\n\nThe magnetopause, the outermost edge that our planet's intrinsic magnetic field reaches, is always in motion. The macroscopic acceleration at the magnetopause is sometimes as large as a few km/s2. Theoretically, such an acceleration of the boundary can facilitate an instability in the motion of the interface, the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability. Such an instability can, in turn, cause a transfer of plasma across the magnetopause, from solar wind into near-Earth space. If the resulting particles are sufficiently energetic, operations of many satellites in space can be threatened. However, details of how the instability operates at the magnetopause have been neither verified nor observed in spacecraft observations. Recent measurements from NASA's THEMIS mission indicate that the R-T instability can be excited at the magnetopause, and many details of the instability, including those of its electric field and plasma transport across the magnetopause, appear to be verified in those observations.\n\nFor more detail please read the THEMIS nugget summary here or the paper linked below.\n\nCitation:\n\nYan, G.

Using THEMIS observations across more than a solar cycle was key to the discovery.\n\nMore accurate space-weather predictions and safer satellite navigation through radiation belts could someday result from new insights into âspace waves,â researchers at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University reported. The groupâs latest research, published on May 4, 2023, by the journal Nature Communications, shows that seasonal and daily variations in the Earthâs magnetic tilt, toward or away from the Sun, can trigger changes in large-wavelength space waves.\n\nThe simulation (right) shows the Earthâs magnetic environment during the equinox and the solstice. As the solar wind â a flow of particles from the Sun â hits the Earthâs magnetic environment, it can create breaking waves known as Kelvin-Helmholtz waves. This occurs more often during the equinoxes due to the orientation of the Sunâs and Earthâs magnetic fields (left). Credits: Shiva Kavosi, ERAU\n\nThese breaking waves, known as Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, occur at the boundary between the solar wind and the Earthâs magnetic shield. The waves happen much more frequently around the spring and fall seasons, researchers reported, while wave activity is poor around summer and winter. As plasma or solar wind streams from the Sun at speeds up to 1 million miles per hour, it pushes energy, mass and momentum toward the planetâs magnetic shield. It also whips up space waves. Fast-moving solar wind canât pass directly through the Earthâs magnetic shield, so it thunders along the magnetosphere, propelling Kelvin-Helmholtz waves with massive peaks up to 15,000 kilometers (km) high and 40,000 km long.\n\nAstronaut Safety and Satellite Communication\n\nâThrough these waves, solar wind plasma particles can propagate into the magnetosphere, leading to variations in radiation belt fluxes of energetic particlesâregions of dangerous radiationâthat may affect astronaut safety and satellite communications,â said Dr. Shiva Kavosi, a research associate at Embry-Riddle and first author of the âNature Communicationsâ paper. âOn the ground, these events can impact power grids and Global Positioning Systems.â Describing the properties of space waves and the mechanisms that cause them to intensify is key to understanding and forecasting space weather, Kavosi noted: âSpace weather events represent an increasing threat, yet in many cases, we donât understand exactly what controls it. Any progress we can make in understanding the mechanisms behind space weather disturbances will improve our ability to provide forecasts and warnings.â\n\nIn trying to understand the causes of seasonal and diurnal variations of geomagnetic activity, researchers in the field have set forth several different hypotheses. For example, the Russell-McPherron (R-M) effect, first described in 1973, explains why auroras are more frequent and brighter in the spring and fall, based on the interplay of the Earthâs dipole tilt and a small magnetic field near the Sunâs equator. âWe donât have all the answers yet,â said Dr. Katariina Nykyri, professor of physics and associate director for the Center of Space and Atmospheric Research at Embry-Riddle, âbut our paper shows that the R-M effect is not the only explanation for the seasonal variation of geomagnetic activities. Equinox-driven events, based on the Earthâs dipole tilt, and R-M effects could operate simultaneously.â\n\nIn the future, Nykyri added, constellations of spacecraft in the solar wind and magnetosphere could more fully explain the complicated, multi-scale physics of space weather phenomena. âSuch a system would allow advanced warnings of space weather to inform the operators of rocket launches and electrical power grids,â she said. The âNature Communicationsâ paper concludes that âKH waves activity exhibit seasonal and diurnal variations, indicating the critical role of dipole tilt in modulating KHI across the magnetopause as a function of time.â\n\nSource:\n\nAnon.

This new project, Heliophysics Audified: Resonances in Plasmas, or HARP, has just released a web app that takes THEMIS satellite magnetic data and converts it into sounds that the public can listen to and classify.\n\nLearn about the HARP project, where you can help researchers identify plasma waves and improve their models of space weather.

Calgary\n\nPlasma waves arise when charged particles from the sun impact Earth's magnetic field, causing it to vibrate or resonate, unleashing radiation that can potentially damage spacecraft. On the brighter side, plasma waves can also generate the beautiful northern and southern lights. Results from the HARP analysis can be fed into space weather models to improve predictions and help clarify the mysterious processes that govern the auroras.\n\nPlasma waves in Earth's environment are invisible, but they can influence the formation of the aurora.

Calgary\n\n\"Earth's magnetic field and plasma waves are invisible to cameras,\" said Mike Hartinger, principal investigator at SSI and a researcher in the UCLA Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences (EPSS). \"HARP uses data collected by NASA's THEMIS satellites traveling through the changing magnetic environment around our planet, where plasma waves can form.\"\n\nJust as seismologists use earthquake vibrations to \"see\" inside the Earth, HARP uses magnetic vibrations to investigate how space weather evolves around our planet in response to the Sun's activity.\n\nPlasmas are charged particles that emanate from the sun, which blows a solar wind in continuous streams and explosive eruptions. When the solar wind impacts Earth's magnetic field, different types of plasma waves can form, analogous to vibrations formed by different musical instruments. Credit: Q.-G. Zong, Peking Univ.; M. O. Archer, Imperial College London; M. Hartinger, SSI, UCLA EPSS\n\nHARP expands upon a pilot project in the UK led by team member Martin Archer of Imperial College London, in which high school students found a new complex pattern of plasma waves and became co-authors in a peer-reviewed journal publication. Studies show that people's eyes and ears in combination are better at finding hidden wave patterns than using computer algorithms or eyes alone. Anyone can work with NASA satellite data with just a few minutes of training and make an important contribution to space science.\n\n\"We need the public's help to identify plasma waves in huge datasets gathered over the past 16 years by NASA's THEMIS satellites,\" said Hartinger.\n\nAn overview of the HARP graphic interface and sample sound event from 2012.

Users can draw boxes around interesting features and describe their characteristics, such as changes in pitch or whether there are single or multiple tones, and jot down any other observations.\n\nAlthough HARP currently uses only one satellite mission, the next step is to add other heliophysics satellites and data sources to incorporate more types of plasma waves throughout the solar system.

It looks as if it could be part of the family, but it has its own distinct style. The phenomenon generally appears as a long, slender purple-and-white arc, sometimes accompanied by a structure that looks like a green picket fence. It is fainter and narrower, and occurs at lower latitudes than most auroras. It is also harder to predict.\n\nWhat are some impacts of STEVE? Even if you havenât seen the awe-inspiring STEVE, its impacts could be experienced by Earthlings in other ways.\n\nSTEVE researcher Toshi Nishimura recounted at least one instance in which a radio signal from a radar network disappeared for 30 minutes as STEVE appeared, but then returned once the ghostly light left the area, suggesting that the phenomenon can disrupt such signals. Similar blackouts can occur with space weather associated with auroras, but he said STEVE occurs in a different region. He said it \"would have a larger impact on densely populated regions at lower latitudes than aurora.â\n\nSTEVE is important because Earthâs magnetic field âis doing something different from usual. â¦ We still donât understand why,â said Nishimura, who recently published a study on the mysteries of STEVE. He has yet to see the phenomenon in person.\n\nA photo of STEVE captured in Plumas in August 2022. STEVE is often accompanied by a green picket fence structure, appearing here at the lower edge of the pink arc. (Donna Lach)\n\nNishimura, a researcher at Boston University, said STEVE seems to always occur during local and brief disturbances in Earthâs magnetic field, called substorms. Substorms can occur without a large geomagnetic storm and happen daily. Yet despite the ubiquity of substorms, researchers are perplexed about why STEVE sightings are still relatively rare compared with auroras.\n\nWith every photo and report, people are understanding more about this relatively unexplored part of our atmosphere, and its connection with the sun.\n\nSource:\n\nPatel, K., (2023), How to find STEVE, the purple streak that looks like an aurora but isnât, Washington Post, Published on Apr. 1, 2023.\n\nCitation: Nishimura, Y. et al.

For their paper published in the journal Nature Physics, the group used data from multiple spacecraft including THEMIS-ARTEMIS and Van Allen Probes over a nearly 40-year period to measure tidal perturbations in the plasmapause.\n\nEarly scientists found a connection between the tides and the movement of the moon thousands of years ago. More recent evidence suggests the moon's pull acts on the ionosphere as well. In this new study, the researchers wondered if the moon might also have an impact on the plasmasphere. The plasmasphere is a toroidal mass of plasma that surrounds the Earth. It lies beyond the ionosphere and is made up mostly of electrons and protons. Its particles are charged by the ionosphere, and its outer boundary is known as the plasmapause. To find out if it is impacted by the moon's gravity, the researchers obtained data from approximately 36,000 crossings of the plasmasphere by spacecraft over the years 1977 to 2015. They also used data from the Van Allen Probes from the years 2012 to 2019 to gain a better perspective on possible plasmasphere modulations.\n\nOcean tides (blue) compared to plasmapause tides (orange). Credit: Q.Q. Shi, Shandong University (video link)\n\nThe group found that they were able to isolate tidal variations in the shape of the plasmapause that could be associated with the position of the moon, clear evidence that the moon does exert an influence on the plasmasphere. They also found that they were able to see monthly periodicities in the changes in plasmapause. The researchers propose that three basic elements are responsible for the tidal variations: the existence of a two-body systemânamely the Earth and moonâalong with the existence of the plasma field and the existence of the magnetic field. They further suggest that similar tidal variations likely occur in other two-body systems throughout the universe.\n\nSource:\n\nYirka, B., (2023), Evidence found of tidal impact on the plasmasphere, Phys.org, Published on Feb. 1, 2023.\n\nXiao, C. et al.

Every few minutes, Earth-sized âdropletsâ of plasma rain down from space toward Earth. Instead of crashing catastrophically to the ground, these droplet/s, called magnetosheath jets, hit and are deflected by the outer reaches of Earthâs magnetic field.\n\nDespite their frequent occurrence near Earth and likely ubiquity across the solar system, the study of magnetosheath jets is young, and there is much we do not know about their origins and behavior. Specifically, their potential effects on space weatherâthe phenomena we experience on Earth due to the ever-changing stream of plasma that flows through our solar systemâare unclear and still being investigated. Therefore, these jets are not currently factored into space weather models or predictions. Here we discuss recent findings in this field and important questions that remain to be answered.\n\nFig. 1. The solar wind with its interplanetary magnetic field (yellow lines) flows from the Sun and forms a shock wave called the bow shock (bright orange line) where it meets Earthâs magnetic field upstream of the planet. At the bow shock, the solar wind is slowed, except for fast plasma jets (orange globules) emerging from where the shock wave is corrugated, adjacent to the turbulent foreshock region (brown shading at top right). Jets travel through the magnetosheath (red swirls), and eventually, some of them impact the magnetopause (bright blue line), the outer edge of Earthâs magnetosphere (blue shading). Earthâs magnetic field (faint blue lines) and an aurora in Earthâs ionosphere are also represented. Credit: E. Masongsong, H. Hietala, L. Vuorinen, A. LaMoury\n\nOur knowledge of magnetosheath jets relies on data captured by spacecraft surveying the near-Earth electromagnetic environment. Launched in 2007 and still going strong, NASAâs THEMIS-ARTEMIS five-satellite mission in particular has greatly enhanced our understanding of many areas of space and space weather, from the solar wind and its interactions with Earthâs magnetic field to the aurora and even plasmas around the Moon.\n\nIn a recent study using THEMIS data, researchers observed that the frequency of jets reaching the magnetopause is highly dependent on the properties of the solar wind at the bow shock [LaMoury et al., 2021]. They found that when the solar windâs magnetic field is nearly radial, jets are expected to hit the magnetopause every few minutesâthat is, over 17 times more often than when the solar windâs magnetic field reaches Earth at an oblique angle. They also found that more jets arose during intervals of âfastâ solar wind (which travels about twice the normal velocity). These intervals vary with the 11-year solar cycle, so the number of jets hitting the magnetopause may exhibit the same periodic dependence.\n\nIn addition to controlling the structure of different bow shock regions, the orientation of the solar wind magnetic field influences what happens at the magnetopause. Zooming in on this boundary where the solar wind magnetic field meets Earthâs magnetic field, we see that geometry comes into play once again.\n\nNamely, if the solar wind magnetic field is oriented southward, opposite to Earthâs northward magnetic field, erosion of the magnetopause can occur via a process known as magnetic reconnection (Figure 2). Reconnection is a key process in plasma physics, in which the connectedness of magnetic field lines is fundamentally changed and energy stored in the magnetic field is explosively released.\n\nIn the case of the magnetopause, antiparallel field lines of the solar wind connect with those of Earth, peeling them away from the Sun-facing side of the magnetosphere. This has the effect of weakening Earthâs magnetic shield, allowing solar wind plasma and energy to enter Earthâs magnetosphere. Thus, one of the most critical aspects of forecasting space weather is monitoring the solar wind magnetic field orientation far upstream of Earth.\n\nFig. 2. Antiparallel magnetic field lines can merge during magnetic reconnection, which transforms magnetic energy into the kinetic energy of particles. At Earthâs magnetopause (bright blue), this can happen when Earthâs northward-oriented (â) magnetic field (gray curve with conical arrows) meets a plasma jet (orange globule) with southward-oriented (â) magnetic field.

Beyene\n\nAlthough measuring the northâsouth component of the solar wind magnetic field before it arrives to Earth (together with solar wind speed and density) can help us prepare for space weather storms, it does not give us the full picture of how space weather evolves at Earth. Much more frequent rain showers (i.e., jets) may play a role that, until recently, had not been considered to control magnetic reconnection, sparking debate in the magnetospheric physics community. Jets, because of their high dynamic pressure, have been observed compressing the magnetopause boundary to help initiate reconnection, as opposite magnetic fields are being pushed together more efficiently [Hietala et al., 2018].\n\nIn addition, researchers have suggested that the magnetic field orientation in jets may be different from field orientations in the surrounding magnetosheath. Nykyri et al. [2019] observed jets with southward magnetic fields propagating toward the magnetopause and triggering reconnection despite measurements at the time showing the solar wind magnetic field was oriented northward. This was likely not an isolated occurrence, and it caused a chain of events leading to increased geomagnetic activity on the nightside of the magnetosphere, opposite from the Sun.\n\nVuorinen et al. [2021] performed a statistical study of the northâsouth component in jets versus the surrounding magnetosheath using THEMIS data, further confirming that jets often carry southward magnetic fields even when the solar wind magnetic field is northward. The combination of jets compressing and introducing southward fields to the magnetopause may be favorable for triggering reconnection, even during solar wind conditions when we are not typically expecting it. This result highlights the importance of studying the magnetosphereâs behavior during times of a radial interplanetary magnetic field.\n\nSource:\n\nVuorinen, L., A. LaMoury, E. Masongsong, and H.

Their observations explain how vortices at the edge of Earthâs magnetosphere can cause auroral beads to dot the sky a hundred thousand kilometres below.\n\nThis connection between auroral beads appearing on Earthâs âdaysideâ (or Sun-facing side) and the vortices confirms a theory about how these unique auroras â known as beads because they look like a string of pearls hung across the sky â form. As some spacecraft observed the vortices themselves, others saw that a stream of charged particles used the vortices as access points to tunnel down towards Earthâs surface, causing the sky to glow.\n\nUsing multi-spacecraft observations, researchers explain how vortices at the edge of Earthâs magnetosphere can cause auroral beads to dot the sky a hundred thousand kilometres below: 1) The solar wind 'blows' across the magnetopause, rolling it up into giant whirlpool-like vortices. 2) Electrons enter the magnetosphere through the vortices and travel down towards the upper atmosphere. 3) In the upper atmosphere, electrons collide with hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, causing auroral beads to glow in the sky.\n\nOn 6 November 2018, 12 spacecraft were all located close to the magnetopause â the thin boundary at the outer edge of the magnetosphere â on the night side of Earth, where the magnetosphere stretches out into a tail.\n\nAmong the 12 spacecraft located close to the magnetosphere were the four that make up ESAâs Cluster mission, as well as NASAâs four Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft and three Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft, and JAXAâs Geotail. In addition, a US Defence Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite observed the auroral beads from close to Earthâs surface.\n\nâThis discovery shows that the Cluster spacecraft are part of a âmagnetospheric orchestraâ of missions that together enable extra science that is not possible to achieve with each mission individually,â explains Philippe Escoubet, ESAâs Cluster project scientist.\n\nThe vortices â which themselves were originally detected by Cluster â are formed when the solar wind blows past the magnetopause. Just as wind on Earth can whip up oceans and clouds, the solar wind can roll up the magnetopause into giant waves comprised of whirlpool-like vortices.\n\nWhen a vortex is at the âgoldilocksâ size â not too big, but not too small â electrons from the solar wind swirl around its centre, before entering the magnetosphere, travelling towards and reaching Earthâs upper atmosphere. There, the electrons collide with hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, causing them to glow and form an auroral bead in the sky. These round beads â one for each vortex â appear in groups that follow each other across the sky. This is in contrast to ânormalâ aurora which are flatter, more elongated and not so well organised.\n\nPhilippe continues: âCluster has been operating for almost 22 years now. In the beginning, it was one of the only missions observing the magnetosphere, so we were mainly comparing the four spacecraft with each other. But nowadays we can compare their data with those from other missions, such as MMS and THEMIS.â\n\nThis research demonstrates the importance of multiple different spacecraft, each with their own complement of scientific instruments, monitoring the same events from different vantage points.\n\nSource:\n\nESA, Magnetic vortices explain mysterious auroral beads, June 2, 2022.\n\nSpace.com\n\nCitation: Petrinec, S. et al.

Using THEMIS along with ELFIN CubeSat low-altitude electron measurements, they confirmed that oblique whistler waves can energize electrons to >100keV and fill the loss cone beyond predictions by current models.\n\nUCLA scientists have discovered a new source of super-fast, energetic electrons raining down on Earthâs atmosphere, a phenomenon that contributes to the colorful aurora borealis but also poses hazards to satellites, spacecraft and astronauts.\n\nThe researchers observed unexpected, rapid âelectron precipitationâ from low-Earth orbit using the ELFIN mission, a pair of tiny satellites built and operated on the UCLA campus by undergraduate and graduate students guided by a small team of staff mentors.\n\nBy combining the ELFIN data with more distant observations from NASAâs THEMIS spacecraft, the scientists determined that the sudden downpour was caused by whistler waves, a type of electromagnetic wave that ripples through plasma in space and affects electrons in the Earthâs magnetosphere, causing them to âspill overâ into the atmosphere.\n\nThe THEMIS and ELFIN satellites (orbits shown in cyan and green, respectively) worked together to help understand the mystery of electron rain. When whistler waves (purple) interact with the electrons, they can give them extra energy (red spiral), which causes them to fall into the atmosphere.\n\nTheir findings, published March 25 in the journal Nature Communications, demonstrate that whistler waves are responsible for far more electron rain than current theories and space weather models predict.\n\nâELFIN is the first satellite to measure these super-fast electrons,â said Xiaojia Zhang, lead author and a researcher in UCLAâs department of Earth, planetary and space sciences. âThe mission is yielding new insights due to its unique vantage point in the chain of events that produces them.â\n\nCentral to that chain of events is the near-Earth space environment, which is filled with charged particles orbiting in giant rings around the planet, called Van Allen radiation belts. Electrons in these belts travel in Slinky-like spirals that literally bounce between the Earthâs north and south poles. Under certain conditions, whistler waves are generated within the radiation belts, energizing and speeding up the electrons. This effectively stretches out the electronsâ travel path so much that they fall out of the belts and precipitate into the atmosphere, creating the electron rain.\n\nOne can imagine the Van Allen belts as a large reservoir filled with water â or, in this case, electrons. As the reservoir fills, water periodically spirals down into a relief drain to keep the basin from overflowing. But when large waves occur in the reservoir, the sloshing water spills over the edge, faster and in greater volume than the relief drainage. ELFIN, which is downstream of both flows, is able to properly measure the contributions from each flow.\n\nThe low-altitude electron rain measurements by ELFIN, combined with the THEMIS observations of whistler waves in space and sophisticated computer modeling, allowed the team to understand in detail the process by which the waves cause rapid torrents of electrons to flow into the atmosphere.\n\nThe findings are particularly important because current theories and space weather models, while accounting for other sources of electrons entering the atmosphere, do not predict this extra whistler waveâinduced electron flow, which can affect Earthâs atmospheric chemistry, pose risks to spacecraft and damage low-orbiting satellites.\n\nThe researchers further showed that this type of radiation belt electron loss to the atmosphere can increase significantly during geomagnetic storms, disturbances caused by enhanced solar activity that can affect near-Earth space and Earthâs magnetic environment.\n\nAlthough space is commonly thought to be separate from our upper atmosphere, the two are inextricably linked. Understanding how theyâre linked can benefit satellites and astronauts passing through the region, which are increasingly important for commerce, telecommunications and space tourism.\n\nSince its inception in 2013, more than 300 UCLA students have worked on ELFIN (Electron Losses and Fields investigation), which is funded by NASA and the National Science Foundation. The two microsatellites, each about the size of a loaf of bread and weighing roughly 8 pounds, were launched into orbit in 2018, and since then have been observing the activity of energetic electrons and helping scientists to better understand the effect of magnetic storms in near-Earth space.

The research utilized simultaneous THEMIS ASI and satellite observations to explain how plasma flows create auroral beads, in the context of substorm auroral intensification.\n\nAurora in the night sky often begins with a sudden intensification called a substorm, and the auroral intensification shows a wave-like display (beads). It is critical to understand the origin of beads for revealing the mechanism of the sudden auroral intensifications, but it has been extremely difficult to find satellite observations in space to explore the magnetospheric source region of substorms.\n\nImage shows an aurora which was observed by an all-sky camera at Fort Yukon, Alaska, at 9:14 UT on 20 November 2014. The image is projected onto the geographic map in Alaska. North is to the top and east is to the right. The image shows wave-like auroral structures called auroral beads. Credit: NASA/CSA/University of California, Berkeley/University of Calgary/NSF.\n\nNishimura et al. identified two simultaneous observations of auroral beads at the beginning of substorm auroral intensification, using all-sky imagers and related plasma dynamics by the THEMIS satellites in the plasma sheet. They found that the bead structure and propagation are related to charge accumulation and fast plasma streams in the plasma sheet. The plasma flow speed coincided with the bead speed, and the charge distribution and plasma stream direction reversed when the auroral beads moved in the opposite direction, giving strong evidence of the connection between the observations at the two locations. The plasma streams reduced the electric currents in the plasma sheet, and the paper suggests that the current reduction destabilizes the plasma sheet and initiates the substorm auroral intensification.\n\nCitation: Nishimura, Y., Artemyev, A.

Using a combination of theory, THEMIS observations and global simulations, they discovered magnetopause standing waves propagating against the flow of the solar wind.\n\nEarth sails the solar system in a ship of its own making: the magnetosphere, the magnetic field that envelops and protects our planet. The celestial sea we find ourselves in is filled with charged particles flowing from the Sun, known as the solar wind. Just as ocean waves follow the wind, scientists expected that waves traveling along the magnetosphere should ripple in the direction of the solar wind. But a new study reveals some waves do just the opposite.\n\nAn animated illustration of magnetospheric waves, in light blue. At the front of the magnetosphere, these waves appear to be still. Credits: M. Archer/E. Masongsong/NASA\n\nStudying these magnetospheric waves, which transport energy, helps scientists understand the complicated ways that solar activity plays out in the space around Earth. Changing conditions in space driven by the Sun are known as space weather. That weather can impact our technology from communications satellites in orbit to power lines on the ground. âUnderstanding the boundaries of any system is a key problem,â said Martin Archer, a space physicist at Imperial College London who led the new study, published today in Nature Communications. âThatâs how stuff gets in: energy, momentum, matter.â\n\nArcher focuses on surface waves, meaning waves that require a boundary â in this case, the edge of the magnetosphere â to travel along. Previously, he and his colleagues established this boundary vibrates like a drum. When a strong burst of solar wind beats against the magnetosphere, waves race towards Earthâs magnetic poles and get reflected back.\n\nThe latest work considers the waves that form across the entire surface of the magnetosphere, using a combination of models and observations from NASAâs THEMIS mission, Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms.\n\nThe researchers found when solar wind pulses strike, the waves that form not only race back and forth between Earthâs magnetic poles and the front of the magnetosphere, but also travel against the solar wind. Archer likened these two kinds of movement to crossing a river: A boat can go from one riverbank to the other (traveling towards the poles) and upstream (against the solar wind). At the front of the magnetosphere, these waves appear to stand still.\n\nThe THEMIS satellitesâ observations from within the magnetosphere first hinted some waves might be traveling against the solar wind. The researchers used models to illustrate how the energy of the wind coming from the Sun and that of the waves going against it could cancel each other out. Itâs similar to what happens if you try walking up a downwards escalator. âItâs going to look like youâre not moving at all, even though youâre putting in loads of effort,â Archer said.\n\nIn this video, you can see and listen to standing waves at the edge of the magnetosphere. Data from the model has been translated into audio frequencies and stretched in time. The left panel shows a view looking down on Earthâs north pole. The right panel presents a view that slices through Earthâs magnetosphere, down the north and south poles. Red shows where the magnetic field grows stronger, while blue shows where it weakens. You first hear higher-frequency waves that are quickly replaced by a lower pitch â the standing waves that persist longer at the edge of the magnetosphere. Credits: Martin Archer/CCMC/NASA Download HD version from NASA SVS\n\nThese standing waves can persist longer than those that travel with the solar wind. That means theyâre around longer to accelerate particles in near-Earth space, leading to potential impacts in the radiation belts, aurora, or ionosphere. Archer expects standing waves may occur elsewhere in the universe, from the magnetospheres of other planets to the peripheries of black holes. Studying the waves close to home can help scientists understand such distant boundaries.\n\nBy translating the wave models and data into the audible range, we can listen to the sound of these curious waves.\n\nSource:\n\nTran, L., With NASA Data, Researchers Find Standing Waves at Edge of Earthâs Magnetic Bubble, NASA News, Oct. 6, 2021.\n\nDunning, H., When the solar wind hits Earthâs magnetosphere, a surprising stillness ensues, Imperial College London, Oct. 6, 2021.\n\nScience Times\n\nSciTech Daily\n\nUK News 18\n\nCitation:\n\nArcher, M.

Using THEMIS observations and statistical analyses, they revealed an atmospheric electron beam source for ECH waves, which in turn can power the diffuse aurora.\n\nDiffuse auroras and the Big Dipper, photographed by Emmanuel V. Masongsong in Fairbanks, AK\n\nNo solar storms? No problem. Earth has learned to make its own auroras. New results from NASAâs THEMIS-ARTEMIS spacecraft show that a type of Northern Lights called \"diffuse auroras\" comes from our own planetâno solar storms required.\n\nDiffuse auroras look a bit like pea soup. They spread across the sky in a dim green haze, sometimes rippling as if stirred by a spoon. Theyâre not as flamboyant as auroras caused by solar storms. Nevertheless, they are important because they represent a whopping 75% of the energy input into Earthâs upper atmosphere at night. Researchers have been struggling to understand them for decades.\n\nâWe believe we have found the source of these auroras,â says UCLA space physicist Xu Zhang, lead author of papers reporting the results in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics and Physics of Plasmas.\n\nIt is Earth itself.\n\nEarth performs this trick using electron beams. High above our planetâs poles, beams of negatively-charged particles shoot upward into space, accelerated by electric fields in Earthâs magnetosphere. Sounding rockets and satellites discovered the beams decades ago. It turns out, they can power the diffuse auroras.\n\nThe video, below, shows how it works. The beams travel in great arcs through the space near Earth. As they go, they excite ripples in the magnetosphere called Electron Cyclotron Harmonic (ECH) waves. Turn up the volume and listen to the waves recorded by THEMIS-ARTEMIS:\n\nTHEMIS-E electric field wave burst mode (EFW) data converted to audio using real time and pitch, from nightside magnetosphere observations on June 1, 2011 16:06 UT. Low-energy electron beams (red) spray out of Earthâs north and south poles, converging in the equatorial magnetosphere (blue) to form Electron Cyclotron Harmonic waves (pink). The waves move Earthward, knocking other electrons (orange) out of orbit, which then fall back into the atmosphere to power the diffuse aurora (green). Video Credit, E. Masongsong UCLA EPSS, NASA Eyes Audio Credit, Martin O. Archer, Imperial College London, NASA HARP\n\nECH waves, in turn, knock other electrons out of their orbits, forcing them to fall back down onto the atmosphere. This rain of secondary electrons powers the diffuse auroras.\n\n\"This is exciting,\" says UCLA professor Vassilis Angelopoulos, a co-author of the papers and lead of the THEMIS-ARTEMIS mission. \"We have found a totally new way that particle energy can be transferred from Earthâs own atmosphere out to the magnetosphere and back again, creating a giant feedback loop in space.\"\n\nAccording to Angelopoulos, Earthâs polar electron beams1 sometimes weaken but they never completely go away, not even during periods of low solar activity. This means Earth can make auroras without solar storms.\n\nThe sun is currently experiencing periods of quiet as young Solar Cycle 25 sputters to life.

Their analysis of THEMIS data is the first to describe two separate geomagnetic storm events occurring in 2017 in which detected Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) waves on the magnetopause were observed to be correlated with surface waves in the hot zone of the outer plasmasphere. The Near-Earth Plasma Sheet (NEPS), activated by the K-H waves, acts as a resonator with eigenfrequencies in the Pc4-5 range, and leads to surface waves in the low-density hot zone of the outer plasmasphere.\n\nK-H waves-related magnetic field (By) variations (from TH-E) correlated with the local geomagnetic By variations at Neumayer Station III and with the DMSP-F15 detections of auroral undulations (AUs, shaded cyan).

For one event a complex flow channel structure in the auroral regions was observed that appeared as sub-auroral ion drifts (SAIDs) early in the storm, and as sub-auroral polarization streams (SAPS) and abnormal SAIDs at later times. Observed wave structure embedded within the SAPS appeared to correlate well with the KH waves. The paper demonstrates the complex coupling that occurs over extremely large distances from the magnetopause to the auroral zones.\n\nSource: Hickey, M.

The dazzling light displays in the polar night skies require an electric accelerator to propel charged particles down through the atmosphere. Scientists at Nagoya University and colleagues in Japan, Taiwan and the US have found that it exists beyond 30,000 kilometres above the Earth's surface -- offering insight not just about Earth, but other planets as well.\n\nSchematic of the very high altitude electron acceleration powering an auroral arc. (a) Illustration in the meridional plane. (b) Illustration in the plane perpendicular to the background magnetic field. Credit: Shun Imajo, Nagoya Univ.\n\nThe story of aurora formation begins with supersonic plasma propelled from the Sun into space as high-speed, charged particles. When these charged particles get close to Earth, they are deflected and funnelled in streams along the planet's magnetic field lines, eventually flowing towards the poles. \"Most electrons in the magnetosphere don't reach the part of the upper atmosphere called the ionosphere, because they are repelled by the Earth's magnetic field,\" explains Shun Imajo of Nagoya University's Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, the study's first author.\n\nBut some particles receive a boost of energy, accelerating them into Earth's upper atmosphere where they collide with and excite oxygen and nitrogen atoms at an altitude of about 100 kilometres. When these atoms relax from their state of excitation, they emit the auroral lights. Still, many details about this process remain a mystery. \"We don't know all the details of how the electric field that accelerates electrons into the ionosphere is generated or even how high above Earth it is,\" Imajo says.\n\nScientists had assumed electron acceleration happened at altitudes between 1,000 and 20,000 kilometres above Earth. This new research revealed the acceleration region extends beyond 30,000 kilometres. \"Our study shows that the electric field that accelerates auroral particles can exist at any height along a magnetic field line and is not limited to the transition region between the ionosphere and magnetosphere at several thousand kilometres,\" says Imajo. \"This suggests that unknown magnetospheric mechanisms are at play.\"\n\nThe team reached this finding by examining data from THEMIS ground-based imagers in the US and Canada and from the electron detector on Arase, a Japanese satellite studying a radiation belt in Earth's inner magnetosphere. The data was taken from 15 September 2017 when Arase was at about 30,000 kilometres altitude and located within a thin active auroral arc for several minutes. The team was able to measure upward and downward movements of electrons and protons, ultimately finding the acceleration region of electrons began above the satellite and extended below it.\n\nTo further investigate this so-called very high-altitude acceleration region, the team next aims to analyse data from multiple aurora events, compare high-altitude and low-altitude observations, and conduct numerical simulations of electric potential. \"Understanding how this electric field forms will fill in gaps for understanding aurora emission and electron transport on Earth and other planets, including Jupiter and Saturn,\" Imajo says.\n\nSource: Nagoya Univ., The aurora's very high altitude booster, Science Daily, March 9, 2021.\n\nCitation: Imajo, S., et al., (2021) Active auroral arc powered by accelerated electrons from very high altitudes.

Their paper, published in Nature Physics, offers new valuable insight that could pave the way towards a better understanding of geospace dynamics. Geospace, the portion of outer space that is closest to Earth, includes the upper atmosphere, ionosphere (i.e., the ionized part of the atmosphere) and magnetosphere.\n\nAn illustration of solar flare impacts on the whole geospace. Credit: Jing Liu.\n\n\"The magnetosphere is located in the region above the ionosphere and is the fully ionized space region above 1000 km from the ground,\" said Professor Jing Liu, lead author of the study. \"The region is surrounded by the solar wind and is affected and controlled by the earth's magnetic field and the solar wind's magnetic field.\"\n\nThe magnetosphere is generally described as Earth's protective barrier against solar wind and other solar particles, as it prevents these particles from entering the planet's other protective layers. Nonetheless, past studies showed that when the direction of solar wind is opposite to the magnetosphere's magnetic field, magnetic lines from these two regions can 'connect.\" This means that some solar wind particles can be directly transmitted to the space surrounding Earth.\n\nLiu and his colleagues analyzed data collected by different devices and satellites during a solar flare event that took place on 6 September 2017. To do this, they adopted a recently developed numerical geospace model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. This model, called the high spatial-temporal resolution magnetosphere ionosphere thermosphere model, reproduces the changes triggered by solar flares in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system. Using this model and previously collected THEMIS and other spacecraft data, the researchers were able to unveil solar flare effects on magnetospheric dynamics and on the electrodynamic coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. More specifically, they observed a rapid and large increase in flare-induced photoionization of the polar ionospheric E-region at altitudes between 90 and 150 km. The phenomenon observed by Liu and his colleagues appeared to have a number of effects on the geospace region, including a lower Joule heating of the Earth's upper atmosphere, a reconfiguration of the magnetosphere convection and changes in auroral precipitation.\n\n<\n\nUsing the LTR model and previously collected data, the researchers were able to unveil solar flare effects on magnetospheric dynamics and on the electrodynamic coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere.

Known as auroral beads, these lights often show up just before large auroral displays, which are caused by electrical storms in space called substorms. Previously, scientists werenât sure if auroral beads are somehow connected to other auroral displays as a phenomenon in space that precedes substorms, or if they are caused by disturbances closer to Earthâs atmosphere.\n\nBut powerful new computer models combined with observations from NASAâs Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms â THEMIS â mission have provided the first strong evidence of the events in space that lead to the appearance of these beads, and demonstrated the important role they play in our near space environment.\n\nâNow we know for certain that the formation of these beads is part of a process that precedes the triggering of a substorm in space,â said Vassilis Angelopoulos, principal investigator of THEMIS at the University of California, Los Angeles. âThis is an important new piece of the puzzle.â\n\nBy providing a broader picture than can be seen with the three THEMIS spacecraft or ground observations alone, the new models have shown that auroral beads are caused by turbulence in the plasma â a fourth state of matter, made up of gaseous and highly conductive charged particles â surrounding Earth. The results, recently published in the journals Geophysical Research Letters and Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, will ultimately help scientists better understand the full range of swirling structures seen in the auroras.\n\nâTHEMIS observations have now revealed turbulences in space that cause flows seen lighting up the sky as of single pearls in the glowing auroral necklace,\" said Evgeny Panov, lead author on one of the new papers and THEMIS scientist at the Space Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. âThese turbulences in space are initially caused by lighter and more agile electrons, moving with the weight of particles 2000 times heavier, and which theoretically may develop to full-scale auroral substorms.â\n\nTo uncover the mysteries behind the formation of auroral beads, scientists combined measurements from NASA's THEMIS mission and ground observations with computer models. Credits: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nMysteries of Auroral Beads Formation\n\nAuroras are created when charged particles from the Sun are trapped in Earthâs magnetic environment â the magnetosphere â and are funneled into Earthâs upper atmosphere, where collisions cause hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms and molecules to glow. By modelling the near-Earth environment on scales from tens of miles to 1.2 million miles, the THEMIS scientists were able to show the details of how auroral beads form.\n\nAs streaming clouds of plasma belched by the Sun pass Earth, their interaction with the Earthâs magnetic field creates buoyant bubbles of plasma behind Earth. Like a lava lamp, imbalances in the buoyancy between the bubbles and heavier plasma in the magnetosphere creates fingers of plasma 2,500 miles wide that stretch down towards Earth. Signatures of these fingers create the distinct bead-shaped structure in the aurora.\n\nâThere's been a realization that, all summed up, these relatively little transient events that happen around the magnetosphere are somehow important,â said David Sibeck, THEMIS project scientist at NASAâs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. âWe have only recently gotten to the point where computing power is good enough to capture the basic physics in these systems.â\n\nNow that scientists understand the auroral beads precede substorms, they want to figure out how, why and when the beads might trigger full-blown substorm. At least in theory, the fingers may tangle magnetic field lines and cause an explosive event known as magnetic reconnection, which is well known to create full-scale substorms and auroras that fill the nightside sky.\n\nNew Models Open New Doors\n\nSince its launch in 2007, THEMIS has been taking detailed measurements as it passes through the magnetosphere in order to understand the causes of the substorms that lead to auroras. In its prime mission, THEMIS was able to show that magnetic reconnection is a primary driver of substorms. The new results highlight the importance of structures and phenomenon on smaller scales â those hundreds and thousands of miles across as compared to ones spanning millions of miles.\n\nâIn order to understand these features in the aurora, you really need to resolve both global and smaller, local scales. That's why it was so challenging up to now,â said Slava Merkin, co-author on one of the new papers and scientist at NASAâs Center for Geospace Storms headquartered at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. âIt requires very sophisticated algorithms and very big supercomputers.â\n\nThe new computer simulations almost perfectly match THEMIS and ground observations. After the initial success of the new computer models, THEMIS scientists are eager to apply them to other unexplained auroral phenomena. Particularly in explaining small-scale structures, computer models are essential as they can help interpret what happens in between the spaces where the three THEMIS spacecraft pass.\n\nâThereâs lots of very dynamic, very small-scale structures that people see in the auroras which are hard to connect to the larger picture in space since they happen very quickly and on very small scales,â said Kareem Sorathia, lead author on one of the new papers and scientist at NASAâs Center for Geospace Storms headquartered at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. âNow that we can use global models to characterize and investigate them, that opens up a lot of new doors.â\n\nSource: Johnson-Groh, M.

By feeding the ring current directly, this creates a qualitatively different mode of magnetospheric convection.\n\nMagnetic storms originate closer to Earth than previously thought, threatening satellites\n\nAn illustration shows the Earthâs magnetosphere during a magnetic storm. At right, three satellites witnessed reconnection close to geosynchronous orbit where many other critical satellites reside. The red âXâ identifies the reconnection site, and the yellow arrows indicate the direction of explosive outflows of energized particles toward and away from Earth. Earth-directed electrons (shown in red and pink) carry energy along magnetic field lines to power the aurora at Earthâs north and south poles. These energized electrons were detected by a weather satellite (center). Credit: E. Masongsong/UCLA EPSS\n\nBeyond Earthâs atmosphere are swirling clouds of energized particles â ions and electrons â that emanate from the sun. This âsolar windâ buffets the magnetosphere, the magnetic force field that surrounds Earth. In much the same way winds and storms create weather in our atmosphere, strong gusts of solar wind penetrating the magnetosphere can generate magnetic storms with powerful electric currents that can impact our lives.\n\nA recent study in Nature Physics by Angelopoulos et al. shows that such storms can originate much that such storms can originate much closer to Earth than previously thought, overlapping with the orbits of critical weather, communications and GPS satellites.\n\nBrilliant aurora borealis captured over Yukon, Canada, during a geomagnetic storm. Its elusive driver, magnetic reconnection, was captured by a fleet of spacecraft near local midnight, with a large energy release surprisingly close to geosynchronous orbit. Credit: Joseph Bradley\n\nMagnetic storms can produce dazzling northern lights or hazardous particles careening toward spacecraft and astronauts, zapping them out of commission. Under certain conditions, magnetic storms can disable the electrical grid, disrupt radio communications and corrode pipelines, even creating extreme aurora visible close to the equator. âBy studying the magnetosphere, we improve our chances of dealing with the greatest hazard to humanity venturing into space: storms powered by the sun,â Angelopoulos said.\n\nAn incident that illustrates the dramatic power of magnetic storms occurred in 1921, when such a storm disrupted telegraph communications and caused power outages that resulted in a New York City train station burning to the ground. And in 1972 the Apollo 16 and 17 astronauts narrowly missed what could have been a lethal solar eruption. These incidents underscore the potential dangers that should be assessed as more humans venture into orbit. If a similar storm occurred today, a separate study estimated, economic losses in the U.S. due to electrical blackouts only could surpass $40 billion a day.\n\nHow electric currents in space influence the aurora and magnetic storms has been long debated in the space physics community. Because the storms occur so rarely and satellite coverage is sparse, it has been difficult for researchers to detect the dynamic process that powers those storms. When solar wind magnetic energy is transferred into the magnetosphere, it builds up until it is converted into heat and particle acceleration through a process called magnetic reconnection. After decades of study, it is still unclear to researchers where exactly magnetic reconnection occurs during storms.\n\nMosaic of THEMIS auroral all-sky cameras, imaging the night sky across Canada during the magnetic storm studied in the paper.

The three NASA THEMIS satellites observed magnetic reconnection only about three to four Earth diameters away. The researchers did not expect this could happen in the comparatively stable magnetic field configuration near Earth.Later, a weather satellite, which was nearer to Earth in geostationary orbit, detected energized particles associated with magnetic storms.\n\nThe weather satellite proved that this near-Earth reconnection stimulated ion and electron acceleration to high energies, posing a hazard to hundreds of satellites operating in this common orbit. Such particles can damage electronics and human DNA, increasing the risk of radiation poisoning and cancer for astronauts. Some particles can even enter the atmosphere and affect airline passengers.\n\nâOnly with such direct measurements of magnetic reconnection and its resulting energy flows could we convincingly prove such an unexpected mechanism of storm power generation,â said Angelopoulos, who is lead author of the paper. âCapturing this rare event, nearer to Earth than ever detected before, forces us to revise prior assumptions about the reconnection process.â\n\nThis discovery will ultimately help scientists refine predictive models of how the magnetosphere responds to solar wind, providing precious extra hours or even days to prepare satellites, astronauts and the energy grid for the next âbig oneâ in space.\n\nSource: Masongsong, E.

Sivadas et al., whose paper on structured diffuse aurora was selected as the GRL cover, an AGU highlight, and NASA News story. Using THEMIS probes, ASI/GBO, and NOAA satellite data, they linked this aurora to its source region in the radiation belts.\n\nStreaks in Aurora Found to Map Features in Earthâs Radiation Environment\n\nA special kind of streaked aurora has been found to track disturbances in near-Earth space from the ground. Known as structured diffuse aurora, it was recently discovered, with the help of NASA spacecraft and instruments, that these faint lights in the night sky can map the edges of the Van Allen radiation belts â hazardous concentric bands of charged particles encircling Earth.\n\nWhen the Van Allen belts undulate in shape and size â which they do in response to incoming radiation from the Sun as well as changes from Earth below â they can envelop satellites in unexpected radiation. The new discovery, reported in the AGU journal Geophysical Research Letters, will help us better track the edges of the belts â and the more we know about how the belts are changing, the more we can mitigate such effects.\n\nA white light camera at Poker Flat shows the structured diffuse aurora, that mark the edge of the Van Allen radiation belt as it dances across the night sky. Using a combination of instruments and spacecraft, scientists were able to determine where the electrons causing the aurora had originated. Credits: NASA/Nithin Sivadas\n\nThe road to linking these auroras to the Van Allen belts began with a blob seen in radar data. Scientists spotted the unexpected blob, caused by an excess of electrons, in radar data from Poker Flat, a research facility and rocket range in Alaska â and they set out to find its origin. Using a group of instruments â including NASAâs Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission, NOAA-17 (a low-Earth orbit spacecraft), and radar and optical instruments on the ground at Poker Flat â the scientists were able to track back to the electronsâ source.\n\nAn unexpected blob, circled in green, seen in radar data from Poker Flat sparked the research leading to the discovery of the structured diffuse aurora as maps of the edge of the outer Van Allen belt. Credits: NASA/Nithin Sivadas\n\nThey did this by looking at the energies of the electrons. Electrons coming from the outer Van Allen belt have high energies that decrease farther away from Earth. The scientists worked out where these electrons had been by mapping their trajectories and working backwards. Measurements from the NOAA-17 satellite along the trajectory confirmed that the streaked aurora, which was visible during the blob event, ultimately maps to the edge of the outer Van Allen belt.\n\nThis illustration shows the white-light observations of the fine structure in the aurora superimposed over Alaska. The dots signifying electrons are color coded to show their origins, with red dots indicating electrons from the radiation belts and blue from further out. Credits: NASA/Google Earth/Nithin Sivadas\n\nThe scientists found the electrons had been knocked loose from the outer Van Allen belts as Earthâs magnetic environment was squeezed before the onset of whatâs known as a substorm â a space weather event on the night side of Earth triggered by an onslaught of charged particles from the Sun. Eventually, the electrons made their way down into the atmosphere, where they manifested as streaks in the aurora.\n\nThis schematic of the Van Allen beltsâ structure, shows the region of the structured diffuse aurora and the outer edge of the Van Allen belts that it maps.

Researchers from UCLA have just added a new item to the list. Earth itself.\n\nâA natural particle accelerator only 40,000 miles above Earthâs surface is producing âkiller electronsâ moving close to the speed of light,â says Terry Liu, a newly-minted PhD who studied the phenomenon as part of his thesis with UCLA Prof. Vassilis Angelopoulos.\n\nThis means that astronauts leaving Earth for Mars could be peppered by radiation coming at them from behindâfrom the direction of their own home planet.\n\nOverview of the shock wave discovered near Earth, including a simulation of the upstream bowshock region observed by THEMIS. Credit: E. Masongsong, UCLA EPSS\n\nNASAâs THEMIS spacecraft ran across the particles in 2008 not far from the place where the solar wind slams into Earthâs magnetic field. Researchers have long known that shock waves at that location could accelerate particles to high energiesâbut not this high. The particles coming out of the Earth-solar wind interface have energies up to 100,000 electron volts, ten times greater than previously expected.\n\nHow is this possible? Liu found the answer by combining THEMIS data with computer simulations of the sun-Earth interface. When the solar wind meets Earth, it forms a shock wave around Earthâs magnetic field, shaped like the bow waves that form ahead of a boat moving through water. Within this âbow shockâ immense stores of energy can be abruptly released akin to the sonic boom of an airplane.\n\nLiu found that some electrons are shocked not just once, but twice or more, undergoing mirror-like reflections within the bow shock that build energy to unexpected levels. Most of the boosted particles shoot back into space away from Earth.\n\nAbove: Dr. Terry Liu created this diagram showing the location of the natural particle accelerator and how it sprays radiation into space.\n\nâSimilar particles have been detected near Saturn, suggesting that the process is at work there as well,â says Liu. âIndeed,â adds Angelopoulos, âthis type of particle acceleration could be happening throughout the cosmosâfrom supernovas to solar stormsâwherever a supersonic wind hits a barrier.â\n\nMeanwhile, back home, Earth-orbiting satellites and departing astronauts have a new source of radiation to contend with. Itâs right over their shoulder.\n\nSource: Phillips, Tony (2019). A New Source of Space Radiation, Spaceweather.com, August 9, 2019.\n\nCitation: Liu, T.Z., V. Angelopoulos and S.

Typical auroras, the northern and southern lights, are usually seen as swirling green ribbons spreading across the sky. But STEVE is a thin ribbon of pinkish-red or mauve-colored light stretching from east to west, farther south than where auroras usually appear. Even more strange, STEVE is sometimes joined by green vertical columns of light nicknamed the âpicket fence.â\n\nAuroras are produced by glowing oxygen and nitrogen atoms in Earthâs upper atmosphere, excited by charged particles streaming in from the near-Earth magnetic environment called the magnetosphere. Scientists didnât know if STEVE was a kind of aurora, but a 2018 study found its glow is not due to charged particles raining down into Earthâs upper atmosphere.\n\nThe authors of the 2018 study dubbed STEVE a kind of âsky-glowâ that is distinct from the aurora, but were unsure exactly what was causing it. Complicating the matter was the fact that STEVE can appear during solar-induced magnetic storms around Earth that power the brightest auroral lights.\n\nAuthors of a new study published in AGUâs journal Geophysical Research Letters analyzed satellite data and ground images of STEVE events and conclude that the reddish arc and green picket fence are two distinct phenomena arising from different processes. The picket fence is caused by a mechanism similar to typical auroras, but STEVEâs mauve streaks are caused by heating of charged particles higher up in the atmosphere, similar to what causes light bulbs to glow.\n\nâAurora is defined by particle precipitation, electrons and protons actually falling into our atmosphere, whereas the STEVE atmospheric glow comes from heating without particle precipitation,â said Bea Gallardo-Lacourt, a space physicist at the University of Calgary and co-author of the new study. âThe precipitating electrons that cause the green picket fence are thus aurora, though this occurs outside the auroral zone, so itâs indeed unique.â\n\nImages of STEVE are beautiful in themselves, but they also provide a visible way to study the invisible, complex charged particle flows in Earthâs magnetosphere, according to the studyâs authors. The new results help scientists better understand how particle flows develop in the ionosphere, which is important goal because such disturbances can interfere with radio communications and affect GPS signals.\n\nWhere does STEVE come from?\n\nIn the new study, researchers wanted to find out what powers STEVE and if it occurs in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres at the same time. They analyzed data from several satellites passing overhead during STEVE events in April 2008 and May 2016 to measure the electric and magnetic fields in Earthâs magnetosphere at the time.\n\nThe researchers then coupled the satellite data with photos of STEVE taken by amateur auroral photographers to figure out what causes the unusual glow. They found that during STEVE, a flowing âriverâ of charged particles in Earthâs ionosphere collide, creating friction that heats the particles and causes them to emit mauve light. Incandescent light bulbs work in much the same way, where electricity heats a filament of tungsten until itâs hot enough to glow.\n\nArtistâs rendition of the magnetosphere during the STEVE occurrence, depicting the plasma region which falls into the auroral zone (green), the plasmasphere (blue) and the boundary between them called the plasmapause (red).

Credit: Emmanuel Masongsong, UCLA, and Yukitoshi Nishimura, BU/UCLA.\n\nInterestingly, the study found the picket fence is powered by energetic electrons streaming from space thousands of kilometers above Earth. While similar to the process that creates typical auroras, these electrons impact the atmosphere far south of usual auroral latitudes. The satellite data showed high-frequency waves moving from Earthâs magnetosphere to its ionosphere can energize electrons and knock them out of the magnetosphere to create the striped picket fence display.\n\nThe researchers also found the picket fence occurs in both hemispheres at the same time, supporting the conclusion that its source is high enough above Earth to feed energy to both hemispheres simultaneously.\n\nPublic involvement has been crucial for STEVE research by providing ground-based images and precise time and location data, according to Toshi Nishimura, a space physicist at Boston University and lead author of the new study.\n\nâAs commercial cameras become more sensitive and increased excitement about the aurora spreads via social media, citizen scientists can act as a âmobile sensor network,â and we are grateful to them for giving us data to analyze,â Nishimura said.\n\nSource: Lipuma, L.

Credit: Alan Dyer\n\nEarlier this year, researchers announced that long, narrow streaks of purple light occasionally observed in the nighttime sky are not a new type of aurora, as first suspected, but a novel upper atmospheric phenomenon. Dubbed Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement (STEVE) because of their association with fast-moving ions and hot electrons in Earthâs ionosphere, these celestial lights are often visible at lower latitudes than most auroras and appear to be caused by a different, and still undetermined, mechanism.\n\nTo better characterize STEVE, Gallardo-Lacourt et al. conducted the first statistical analysis of this optical phenomenon. Using NASAâs Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) ground-based All-Sky Imager array and the Canadian Space Agencyâs Redline Geospace Observatory (REGO) databases, the team identified and analyzed optical data from 28 STEVE events that occurred between December 2007 and December 2017.\n\nAccording to the results, STEVE is quite narrow, averaging only about 20 kilometers in the northâsouth direction, but typically stretches more than 2,100 kilometers eastâwest across the sky. The events usually last about an hour, and all but one shifted closer to the equator throughout its duration, motion the authors suggest could be attributed to the expansion of the high-latitude convection zone toward the equator.\n\nTo determine the geomagnetic conditions that favor STEVEâs formation, the team analyzed a variety of space weather indices and geophysical parameters for the hours surrounding each event. The results indicate that STEVE typically occurs about 1 hour after the inception of substorms (violent disturbances during which energy from Earthâs magnetic tail is injected into the ionosphereâs high latitudes), especially those with long expansion phases. This study represents an important step toward understanding the nature and origin of this interesting phenomenon, which has the potential to offer fresh insights into Earthâs complex magnetospheric system.\n\nSource: Cook, T.

The paper presents the first evidence of magnetopause standing waves, which were clearly excited by a high-speed jet.\n\nIllustration of a plasma jet impact (yellow) generating standing waves at the boundary (blue) of Earth's magnetic shield (green). Credit: E. Masongsong/UCLA, M. Archer/QMUL, H. Hietala/UTU\n\nSpace isn't silent. In fact, an entire orchestra of instruments fills our near-Earth environment with eerie sounds. Scientists have long known about space phenomena involving electromagnetic waves travelling around Earth that resonate like string instruments and whistle like wind instruments. Now, new research published in Nature Communications has added a percussive member to the cosmic ensemble: a giant drum, triggered by plasma jets striking the boundary of the protective magnetic bubble surrounding our planet.\n\nThis magnetic bubble, known as the magnetosphere, is encased by a boundary region known as the magnetopause, our first barrier to high-energy particles coming from the Sun. At the magnetopause, the majority of solar particles are deflected around Earth, but under certain conditions some sneak through. Understanding the mechanics of the magnetopause is key to helping keep our satellites, telecommunications and astronauts safe from the potentially harmful radiation these particles bring.\n\nNASA's THEMIS mission proves a 45-year old theory that the outer boundary of Earth's magnetic field vibrates like a drum. Credits: Martin Archer, Queen Mary University of London\n\nUsing data from NASA's Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms, or THEMIS, mission, the scientists discovered Â­that when the magnetopause is struck by a jet of plasma from the Sun, it vibrates like a drum, with waves echoing back and forth along its surface, much like they do on top of a drumhead. The new discovery comes several decades after such behavior was first theorized.\n\n\"Given the lack of evidence over the 45 years since they were proposed, there had been speculation that these drum-like vibrations might not occur at all,\" said Martin Archer, space physicist at Queen Mary University of London and lead author of the new paper. \"Now we see that waves on the magnetopause's surface reflect between two points near the magnetic poles â acting very much like a drum.\"\n\nInside the magnetosphere, scientists have long been listening in on space sounds created by various electromagnetic waves. This veritable orchestra of waves can be heard as sound when processed correctly, and they even exhibit similar behaviors to certain musical instruments. So-called magnetosonic waves pulse through plasma in the same way sound bounces through wind instruments. Another type of wave, known as an AlfvÃ©n wave, resonates along magnetic field lines, just like string instruments' vibrating strings. While both of these types of waves can travel anywhere in space, the newly discovered waves are a type of surface waves â waves that require some sort of boundary to travel along.\n\nIn this case the magnetopause acted as the boundary. When a plasma jet â the drumstick â strikes the magnetopause, surface waves form a standing wave pattern â where the ends appear to be standing still while other points vibrate back and forth â just like a drumhead. The fixed points in the wave, which are the rim or edge of the drum, are near Earth's magnetic poles; the waves vibrate the surface of the magnetopause in between. While the wave itself remains on the surface, the vibrations ultimately work their way down into the magnetosphere and trigger other types of waves. \"The waves likely penetrate far into the inner magnetosphere causing ultra-low frequency waves, which affect things like radiation belts, the aurora, and even the ionosphere,\" Archer said.\n\nThe signals recorded by the THEMIS probes converted to audible sound.
