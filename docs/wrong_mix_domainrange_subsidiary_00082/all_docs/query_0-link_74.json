        "text": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. Â– More than 40 Purdue science and engineering students who participate in the university's multicultural learning communities on Saturday (Oct. 30) will work on science- and engineering-related projects with Indianapolis Public Schools students.\n\nThe IPS students participate in Science Bound, a five-year program initiated by Purdue President Martin C. Jischke, that provides eligible students an opportunity to earn a four-year tuition scholarship to Purdue to study for a science-related career. The junior and senior high school students participate in science-related after-school activities, field trips and summer camps to enrich their academic experience.\n\nPurdue students in the Investigating Diversity through Engagement and Service (IDEAS) and Bonding multicultural learning communities include freshmen who are grouped together in classes and residence halls based on similar academic interests and a desire to explore multicultural themes in their courses. The students form a support system to help them succeed in school.\n\nMore than 300 engineering and science freshmen participate in service-learning projects through learning communities. The schools of Liberal Arts and Consumer and Family Sciences also offer multicultural learning communities.\n\nWilliam C. Oakes, associate professor or engineering education, said the projects give the Purdue students and IPS students opportunities to learn from each other.\n\n\"Service-learning projects, like this one with Science Bound, provide ties between classes and offer the students hands-on opportunities to see their future major in a context of community issues,\" Oakes said. \"It also gives the Purdue students a firsthand experience in working with a team and managing a large project.\"\n\nGeorge Bodner, Arthur Kelly Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Education, said his students will gain valuable experience in preparation for their future careers.\n\n\"The Bonding learning community allows students to learn more than the traditional content of a general chemistry course,\" Bodner said. \"It will help them develop a better understanding of both what it means to 'do science' and the role of science in today's society.\"\n\nThe Purdue students also have traveled to Indianapolis to work with the Science Bound students on other demonstrations and experiments. Wesley L. Campbell, Science Bound director, said the Purdue and Science Bound students have enjoyed their time together.\n\n\"The Science Bound students see the Purdue students as their mentors and really look up to them,\" Campbell said. \"In just three years, the first group of Science Bound students will begin their academic careers at Purdue. I hope they help others to follow in their footsteps just as the Purdue students are reaching out to them.\"\n\nShiva Haghighi, a freshman engineering major from West Lafayette, Ind., said working with the Science Bound students is a welcome break from the regular rigors of school.\n\n\"I enjoy very much working with the Science Bound students,\" Haghighi said. \"The kids are full of energy and wonderful ideas, and they are a really smart and interesting group to be around. Most of the kids have more creativity than I ever had.\"\n\nThe students will continue to correspond by e-mail and plan future activities together.\n\nThe Learning Communities, Access and Retention Programs Department is a subsidiary of the Office of Enrollment Management. Purdue's Multicultural Learning Communities are funded by the Lumina Foundation for Education.\n\nWriter: Marydell Forbes, (765) 496-7704, mforbes@purdue.edu\n\nSources: William C.
