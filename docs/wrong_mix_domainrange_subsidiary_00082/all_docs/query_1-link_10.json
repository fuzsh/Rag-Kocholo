        "text": "In my latest on Forbes, I discuss the bizarre accounting practice the Fed follows to reflect the 6% it pays on commercial bank deposits relative to the 2% it receives on treasuries and agency securities. These losses have accumulated to around $160 billion and are reflected in an account called \"deferred assets-remittances to Treasury.\" Incidentally, the Fed's capital is around $50 billion. So, the Fed has negative capital if the deferred asset were offset against equity. The 6% payment is a $200 billion annual subsidy paid by the Fed to the commercial banks. In 2015, Congress used around $19.3 billion from the Fed’s then surplus with Treasury to fund its infrastructure bill. I detail the underlying transactions and the danger of the Fed's losing political independence and the counterexample set by the Bank of England, which, in contrast: (i) follows IFRS; (ii) does not pay interest on the cash deposits left with it by commercial banks; (iii) reports loss absorbing capital, which is capital subtracted for intangible assets; (iv) is allowed to retain earnings and not obligated to pay out the surplus to HM (His Majesty’s) Treasury, unlike the Fed; (v) reports many more of its securities held at fair value, not amortized cost, unlike the Fed; (vi) pays income tax on the surplus it earns; and (vii) imposes a levy on banks and their activities to cover the loss. Treating the Fed as a standalone financially responsible and a politically independent entity that (i) functions like a well-run bank; (ii) stops subsidizing commercial banks; (iii) stops behaving like an ATM machine for Congress; and (iv) follows GAAP accounting, would serve us better in the long run. #columbiauniversity #columbiabusinessschool #FederalReserve #management #fiscaldiscipline Roland Wyn Jones Jack Ciesielski Jacob Soll Russell Roberts Robert Eccles, Ryan Lichtenfels Lev Bagramian, Christopher Magarian, Peter Easton\n\nIn today's column on Forbes, I ask an innocuous question that I had never thought of asking before. We see so much handwringing about \"materiality\" in financial statements whenever new disclosure rules are discussed or when a disclosure case goes to court. Yet, we never seem to ask firms and auditors to simply tell us what materiality standards they used when they prepared and audited a firm's financial statements. This is where travel and exposure to foreign settings helps. Columbia Business School ran a faculty tour of China in early June that I was lucky to be a part of. One of the businesses we visited during that trip was the Chinese electric vehicle giant, BYD. I used to go over the financial statements of any company we visited as a quick way of familiarizing myself with the stated narrative and the proof points of that business. It turns out that BYD clearly discloses the numerical thresholds they use in determining materiality standards in their financial statements. We often think of Chinese financial reporting and governance systems as relatively opaque relative to the ones we have in the West. While that is true in many respects, they also innovate along dimensions that we don't often think about. Will the Financial Accounting Standards Board , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) consider asking US managers and auditors to publish their materiality thresholds for individual firms and/or transactions? #columbiauniversity #chazeninstitute #materiality #financialstatements #china #innovation #management Roland Wyn Jones, Pierre Yared @Shang jin wei, Costis Maglaras Robert Eccles, Sandra J.

The FASB has asked US companies to disclose compensation from 2027. It is somewhat amazing to me that only 15% odd of US companies voluntarily disclose their compensation costs. How do analysts, buy and sell side, understand a firm's business model without knowing how much the firm spends on labor? Of course, the activism continues as we don't know much about costs incurred on contractors, gig workers or other elementary signals of human capital such as employee turnover and tenure. #columbiabusinessschool #columbiauniversity #humancapital #accounting #innovation #management #financialstatements #GAAP Roland Wyn Jones Abigail Beshkin Pierre Yared Cambria Allen Ratzlaff Daniel Taylor, Sandra J.

This is in response to a question that I have been asked repeatedly in recent weeks: can we effectively integrate values and value? Pure capitalism suffers from serious limitations, but stakeholder theory offers very little implementable advice or often risks getting entangled in political debates that effectively shut down discourse. We need a framework that avoids both the relative lack of soul and selfishness of pure capitalism and the unimplementable vague prescriptions of stakeholder theory. A potential way out of this logjam is to add rigor to the integration of sustainability thinking into the firm’s strategy. Stay ruthlessly focused on competitive advantage for the firm and any attendant risks to the business. In any case, without such tight integration, sustainability practices will likely descend into green washing or performative endeavors that often will be exposed by critics. A cynic, at this point, will shrug her shoulders and say, “doesn’t every business claim to integrate sustainability into its strategy?” Well, no. I have seen many businesses say all the right things but view sustainability either as a compliance chore or as a set of small do-good projects milked to yield short run publicity without a rigorous retooling of the firm’s plumbing. The presented framework is aimed at boards to try and convince them and senior managers that one can integrate values and value.

At the upcoming June 13th annual meeting, Tesla is asking its shareholders to ratify the 2018 award and hence overturn the judge's decision. I have not seen a conversation around the accounting implications of such ratification. I argue that the ratification would likely lead to a large earnings hit that will wipe out at least two years of Tesla's pre-tax profits. FYI: I'll be slower than usual in responding to your comments as I am out of the pocket for the next two weeks. #accounting #corporategovernance #columbiauniversity #columbiabusinessschool #options #executivecompensation Roland Wyn Jones Theo Francis Robert Eccles Daniel Taylor Colleen Honigsberg Joel Fleming Patrick Temple-West Jack Ciesielski Sandra J.

The incoming team is grateful for the dedication and visionary leadership of the outgoing DEs, Suraj Srinivasan and @Eric So, whose efforts have grown the accounting department to the second largest in Management Science! Suraj and Eric will continue to handle R&Rs issued by them to ensure continuity. We welcome submissions of all kinds, regardless of methodology or ideological bent. We do not have a set intellectual agenda to promote except that we will prioritize submissions that are aimed at addressing applied problems that either policy makers or practitioners face or will face in coming years. The Accounting Department now receives over 550 submissions a year. Because editorial resources are limited and MS is a journal that charges no submission fees, we intend to desk reject papers that are unlikely to converge within three rounds. Desk rejection is efficient for both the editorial team and for the authors because it conserves resources and permits the authors to speedily move on. We hope scholars will continue to support MS as a premier outlet that strives to publish relevant and reliable research aimed at informing and improving the state of accounting and accountability in businesses. Thanks, especially, to Christoph Loch for entrusting the accounting track to us.

Do they even have a view on how the firm should be run? * How involved are the banks and the other asset managers with discussions on firm strategy? #CFOs I spoke with suggested that the only answer is to propose a growth strategy and deliver proof points of success. Eventually, the growth investors will come buy your stock. And they will generally exit at the first sign of a wobble. Do we need a new intermediary: the public private equity firm? Someone who is willing to hold under-performing public companies for a long time (7-10 years) and is willing to work with management to release hidden value in the under-performer. Comments welcome. Grateful thanks to Jesse J. Greene, Jr. Michael Oliver Weinberg, CFA, Matthew Foulston and Kalash Jain for insightful comments on a prior draft. #columbiabusinessschool #columbiauniversity #privateequity #innovation #management Michael Mauboussin, Thomas Kamei, Roland Wyn Jones, Pierre Yared, Molly Jensen, Melissa Graham, MBA, MFIN, Jack Ciesielski, Pranav Ghai, John Turner, Jeff Mahoney, Robert Eccles"
