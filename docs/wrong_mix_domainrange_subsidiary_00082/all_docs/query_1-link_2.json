        "text": "expert panel\n\nWhen planning and implementing tech initiatives in your company, developing a tech roadmap can make the process significantly smoother. A well-designed roadmap can help your organization understand and carry out the necessary processes, adjust quickly to any internal or external changes, and meet both short- and long-term company goals. As a technology product manager, it’s up to you to guide the success of the project. To do this, you’ll need to know how to make the best possible roadmap for it. Below, the members of Forbes Technology Council share 13 effective roadmapping techniques you can and should leverage for your development plans.\n\nexpert panel\n\nSummer is a slower time for many companies. As team members and clients alike are gone on vacation, workload tends to decrease. As a result, tech teams may also face fewer internal and external requests during these warmer months. If you and your IT team find yourself with fewer fires to fight, you can capitalize on this free time to tackle your backburner tasks – or even get ahead before the inevitable pickup in the fall. Below, the members of Forbes Technology Council share their favorite strategies for taking advantage of downtime.\n\nexpert panel\n\nAt a small tech company that's just getting off the ground, a scrappy, \"get-it-done\" startup mentality is often the key to growing and scaling. At a larger or more established company, this mentality can sometimes get lost or bogged down in corporate processes. If this is the case in your organization, it can help to rally your tech team around an internal \"startup mentality\" for your department. But this is often easier said than done. To set you on the right course, we asked 16 members of Forbes Technology Council what steps an enterprise tech team can take to operate more like a startup. Here's what they had to say."
