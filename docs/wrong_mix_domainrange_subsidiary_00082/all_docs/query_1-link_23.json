        "text": "Professor Dewey is a professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department and holds joint appointments in the Division of Biological Engineering and the Division of Health Sciences and Technology. He is also Co-Director of the International Consortium for Medical Imaging Technology (ICMIT) whose goal is the development and promotion of advanced technology for medical imaging.\n\nProfessor Dewey's research interests include fluids mechanics, cell dynamics and modeling, biomedical imaging, medical informatics, and instrumentation.\n\nResearch:\n\nProbing the effects of mechanical forces on living cells\n\nThe primary medical problem that the Dewey research group investigates is atherosclerosis. The lumen of the arterial wall is lined with endothelial cells that respond to the mechanical forces of blood flowing through the arteries. The endothelium protects the artery wall from inflammatory reactions that result in atherosclerosis. Our lab was the first to demonstrate the time-course with which endothelial cells reorganize and reorient in the direction of fluid flow, and we continue to use microscopy to probe the fundamental mechanisms of this response. The mechanical structure of vascular endothelial cells depends on a network of polymerized actin molecules, and we use fluorescent dyes to track individual actin molecules as they diffuse through the cell.\n\nIn our in vitro model system, application of fluid shear force that is comparable to vascular blood flow in vivo induces a major transient decrease in polymerization. We believe that this alteration is correlated with the observed realignment of the cells in the flow direction. Measurements of cell motility and intercellular gap junction proteins are extending our understanding of the interaction process. This research is a collaborative effort with Prof. John Hartwig at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School.\n\nAs part of this project, we are collaborating with Prof. James McGrath at the University of Rochester to develop a computation model of actin polymerization. The ability to peer inside individual cells with modern fluorescence techniques has powered a profound change in our quantitative understanding of cellular biological function. For example, we reconstruct 3-dimensional images from stereo image pairs taken with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These images allow us to see the interaction of individual structural features within the cells at the molecular level Â– e.g, interactions between polymerized actin filaments and the actin binding protein filamin-A.\n\nIntegration of experimental data from different sources\n\nA second major program within the lab is the development of robust information systems for biological data. Our goal is to develop a common technology that will capture data from all of the major experimental systems in a single ontological framework.\n\nWe have implemented this approach for gel electrophoresis, microarrays and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, demonstrating that data from these diverse sources can be stored and interrogated within a single database or an integrated network of databases. Currently we are incorporating mass spectrometry and optical microscopy into this system. This cross-disciplinary data integration effort is coordinated by the Interoperable Informatics Infrastructure Consortium (I3C), which was organized to promote and develop methodologies for data and tool interoperability in the life sciences, based on open and public specifications and protocols.\n\nThis work is based on a model that was pioneered by the International Consortium for Medical Information Technology (ICMIT), which we founded to develop and implement international data standards in medical imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized axial tomography (CT) and X-rays. The Co-Director of the ICMIT is Prof. Richard Kitney of Imperial College in London.\n\nBack to Top\n\nResearch Highlights:\n\nInformation Technology\n\nActin Dynamics in Vascular Endothelium\n\nDICOM medical database\n\nPhysiome project\n\nMedical information infrastructure\n\nMethod of Indexing and Implicitly Discovering Document Logical Structures\n\nEducational project\n\nCellular Mechanics\n\nA comprehensive physiome of the heart\n\nActin Dynamics in Motile Cells\n\nBiomedical image analysis\n\nEffects of fluid forces on vascular endothelium\n\nStudying the Nanostructure of the Actin Cytoskeleton\n\nBack to Top\n\nPost Doctoral Fellow:\n\nChan Young Park\n\nGraduate Students:\n\nShiva Ayyadurai\n\nChristopher Hartemink\n\nAleksandr Rabodzey\n\nYu Yao\n\nBack to Top\n\nRecent Alumni:\n\nYuan Cheng\n\nWilliam Chuang\n\nNgon Dao\n\nMatthieu Ferrant (visiting student from UCL, Belgium)\n\nJames McGrath\n\nPatrick McCormick\n\nEric Osborn\n\nMaiya Shur\n\nKathleen Steinhoefel (visting scholar from the Fraunhofer Institute in Berlin, Germany.\n\nShixin (Jason) Zhang\n\nYoshihiro Yasumuro (visiting student from Naist, Japan)\n\nBack to Top\n\nCourses Taught:\n\n2.671 - Measurement and Instrumentation\n\n2.771J / BE.453J / HST.958J - Biomedical Information Technology\n\n2.996 - Advance Topics in Mechanical Engineering\n\nBack to Top\n\nRecent Selected Publication:\n\n1.
