        "text": "The “Materiality” bill gives the company too much power to decide what is material. The objections related to the climate bill assume that companies and asset managers don’t plan or invest for the long term. It is not obvious that the SEC has, in the past, considered or even should consider materiality topic by topic for specific firms.\n\nMany controversies around ESG usually end with the following question: “is it material?” So, it might be worth asking, “what does materiality really mean?”\n\nThe “Materiality” bill\n\nReps. Bill Huizenga (R-MI), Chairman of the House Financial Services Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee and Congressman Andy Barr (R-KY), Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy announced the introduction of the Mandatory Materiality Requirement Act on June 23, 2023 to codify this issue into law.\n\nThe Mandatory Materiality Requirement Act amends both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by inserting statutory language directly into both acts saying an “issuer is only required to disclose information in response to disclosure obligation adopted by the Commission to the extent the issuer has determined that such information is important with respect to a voting or investment decision regarding such issuer.”\n\nIntroducing the bill, Rep. Huizenga stated, “the SEC has a long, established history of using the materiality standard when proposing new disclosure requirements and it should not deviate from it. The Mandatory Materiality Requirement Act would codify this standard into law and prohibit the SEC from expanding beyond securities law and the authority granted to it by Congress.”\n\n\"The foundation of our capital markets lies in the materiality standard driven by investors. The proposed rule on climate-related disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission imposes unnecessary obligations on companies and small businesses, unfairly restricting energy companies' access to capital and posing a risk to American energy security\", said Congressman Andy Barr (R-KY). \"As an original cosponsor of the Mandatory Materiality Requirement Act in the House, I take pride in upholding the SEC's statutory mandate. I commend Representative Huizenga and Senator Rounds for their leadership in opposing the inclusion of partisan climate policy in our financial markets and institutions.\"\n\nWho decides what is material?\n\nThe text of the bill states, “the Commission shall expressly provide that an issuer is only required to disclose information in response to such an obligation adopted by the Commission if the issuer has determined that such information is important with respect to a voting or investment decision regarding the issuer.”\n\nThe bill goes on to say, “for the purposes of this paragraph, information is considered to be important with respect to a voting or investment decision regarding an issuer if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would view the failure to disclose that information as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available to the investor.’’\n\nIn plain English, the bill seems to say that the SEC shall only mandate disclosure if the issuer decides it is material to a voting or an investment decision of the issuer (the company). The company shall determine whether a reasonable investor would view omission of disclosure as having sufficiently changed the total mix of information available to the investor.\n\nThis sounds strange to me. How does the company know what does or does not alter the information set of the investor? And who is a reasonable investor? A momentum investor that cares about stock price trends tomorrow or for a month? or a 2050 target fund that should ideally have a 30-year horizon? Or someone in the middle of this continuum? An index fund that is forced to hold whatever is in the index? The S&P 500 committee that decides which stock gets in or out of that index?\n\nThe simplest example I can think of to illustrate the disconnect between the issuer and the investor perspective relates the issue of labor cost disclosures. Will any reasonable investor claim that labor costs of companies are “immaterial” to its voting or investment decisions? Yet, barely 15% of US firms voluntarily disclose such costs.\n\nNext, we must ask what if most of an issuer’s investors think climate is material. Can the company say it doesn’t think it is? This seems to be the case with smaller companies, as illustrated by this study from the Conference Board.\n\nWhat is the SEC’s mission?\n\nThere’s also the issue of the SEC’s mission. The SEC’s website, related to the point of protecting investors says, “To achieve this, we require public companies, fund and asset managers, investment professionals, and other market participants to regularly disclose significant financial and other information so investors have the timely, accurate, and complete information they need to make confident and informed decisions about when or where to invest.” One can argue that climate legitimately falls into “other information.”\n\nWe know that before the SEC was formed, listed companies didn’t have to disclose financial information, and many didn’t. So, we have this kind of chicken and egg situation with respect to the SEC, issuers, and investors. There’s a tension in what Rep. Huizenga says. On the one hand, he says the issuer can make the call on what is material. On the other hand, he talks about the long, established history of the SEC using the materiality standard for proposing a new disclosure requirement. Because the SEC’s mission is to protect investors, can it ignore them when they want a disclosure on something that companies aren’t reporting on? Does this mean materiality is based on some threshold of voluntary adoption of some reporting practice by companies? That once a certain percentage of public firms are reporting, then such reporting becomes material, even if some percentage still thinks it isn’t?\n\nDoes the SEC have to only require “material information”?\n\nThe bill also seems to imply that the SEC should only mandate “material” disclosures. I am no lawyer, but this sounds inconsistent to me. Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933 seems to say, “any such registration statement shall contain such other information, and be accompanied by such other documents, as the Commission may by rules or regulations require as being necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.”\n\nI don’t see the word, “material,” here. Moreover, the word, “public interest” is interesting. Does “public interest” really preclude discussion of social and environmental externalities that are not internalized well by companies? I don’t think so.\n\nOn top of that, there is a lot of precedence in the SEC mandating disclosures without requiring that such disclosure be material in every way to a specific company. Consider disclosures related to say executive compensation in the proxy statement. The CEO of a Fortune 500 company with say $100 billion in revenue is paid roughly $15-$20 million a year. That number, per se, if one uses some common-sense quantitative threshold, is surely immaterial.\n\nRegardless, investors want to see details related to how senior management is paid to assess higher-order questions such as the state of corporate culture or to assess how responsive senior management might be to investors’ pain related to underperformance of the stock and or the cash flows of the business.\n\nLong-term or short-term materiality?\n\nAs PwC clarifies, in their summary of the SEC climate proposed disclosure rule: “The proposal says that it defines “material” similar to how it’s currently applied in areas like MD&A, which in turn is based on securities law and Supreme Court precedent, meaning “a matter is material if there is substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important when determining whether to buy or sell securities or how to vote.” ” To be clear, the SEC’ climate bill does not talk about “double materiality,” the concept used in the EU, which, in essence, considers the needs of stakeholders, other than investors.\n\nSo, the remaining dispute perhaps pertains to the time horizon of the investor. PwC states, “typically, materiality is considered in the context of a company’s current financial condition and may or may not explicitly consider future periods, especially periods that extend as far in the future as many potential climate-related impacts. Given the uncertainty around many climate developments, in some cases, this evaluation may be challenging.”\n\nOn the surface, this sounds odd to me.\n\nBoth companies and investors routinely think about very long-term issues. Pension funds and the so-called “universal owners” essentially hold the stock for decades. If social and environmental externalities increase returns for some firms in the short run, should they not consider the probability that these externalities will have to be eventually internalized via negative returns in the future via one of several mechanisms: (i) customers defect from your company; (ii) high quality workers do not want to work for the company; (iii) large pools of liquid capital, in the future, defects from the firm; and (iv) litigation or regulation forces the company to pay for the social costs that they have imposed.\n\nCompanies also routinely consider long term materiality\n\nTurning to companies., we routinely report on 30-year leases, debt due 20 plus years out, long term deferred tax assets or liabilities that can span decades or pension and post-retirement obligations due 15-20 years out or even after and tax loss carryforwards that can go unexpired for decades. Granted, we do not have actuarial models with as much data as individuals’ health and mortality data for climate, but surely climate models are getting better over time. You could also argue these disclosures are backed by real contracts. But, what about long term risks including potential decoupling with China, moon-shot investments in A.I. (artificial intelligence) or autonomous cars that bet on how the world will evolve in 20 years or later?\n\nTo get a sense of “material” disclosures that companies make over longer time spans, I pulled out the latest 10-K of General Motors. I found at least 10 examples of risk factors, non-financial commentary and financial footnotes that seem to discuss “material” factors that might affect the financial health of GM over the next decade or two:\n\n· “Our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business opportunities.” (page 1). Here, GM is referring to its investment in “Cruise” a self-driving car start up. Surely, fully functional self-driving cars are at least a decade away or if not more.\n\n· “HYDROTEC We are developing hydrogen fuel cell applications across transportation types and industries, including mobile power generation, class 7/8truck, locomotive and aerospace. The development of HYDROTEC technology is another element of our long-term commitment toward a world with zero emissions.” (page 2). It will be a decade or two before hydrogen fuel cells become mainstream.\n\n· “As a part of the EU’s desire to accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility, the EU is looking to develop stricter emission standards (Euro 7) for all petrol and diesel cars, vans, lorries and buses, as it is moving to end the sale of ICE vehicles past 2035.” (page 11). There are similar references to other regulators planning a move to EVs. How will GM stay ready for this transition 12 years out unless it starts planning for it now?\n\n· “British Columbia has similar ZEV regulations that were completed in July 2020 and cover the 2020–2039 model years.” (page 12).\n\n· “We recently announced the finalization of energy sourcing agreements required to secure 100% of the energy needed to power all our U.S. facilities with renewable energy by 2025. This is in line with the accelerated target announced in September 2021 and 25 years ahead of the initial target of 2050, set in 2016.” (page 13). Note that this 2050 target appears to have been set by GM before the SEC climate bill was released.\n\n· “Our long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of EVs.” (page 15).\n\n· “We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of GHG emissions, changing consumer preferences and other risks related to our transition to EVs and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure.” (page 16).\n\n· The list of forward-looking statements (page 45) that GM discloses, apart from the ones covered above, are too numerous to list here but include comments about their business in China, political uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, pandemics, pension funding.\n\n· In footnote 9, GM lists the estimated life of its building as ranging between “5-40 years” and for its machinery and equipment as “3-27” years.\n\n· Footnote 15 lists GM’s pension payments till 2032.\n\n· Footnote 17 refers to “at December 31, 2022, U.S. tax credit carryforwards were $5.4 billion, where $292 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $5.2 billion will expire by 2042, if not utilized.”\n\nIt is also useful to recall that GM has been invested in overseas markets for decades. For instance, GM entered the Korean market in 1972 (around 50 years) and the Chinese market in 1997 (already 26 years). These have evolved to become among the largest overseas markets for the company. Hence, at least looking back, investment and decision horizons for 50 odd years are not uncommon.\n\nBottomline\n\nThe “Materiality” bill seems to give too much power to companies to decide what information is material. Hence, it useful to understand, what process is followed by a company to determine what is material. On the one hand, good companies routinely have long investment and planning horizons, as illustrated for GM. On the other hand, defining who is a reasonable investor is complicated. If we prioritize the here and the now momentum investor, the 2050 target fund holder will get short changed. On top of that, it is not even obvious that the SEC has and should consider “materiality” before mandating disclosures on specific topics for specific companies."
