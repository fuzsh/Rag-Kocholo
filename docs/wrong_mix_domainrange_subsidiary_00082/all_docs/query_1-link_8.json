Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Active Surfaces develops solar panels that are 100 times lighter than traditional panels. The company secured first place at the MIT 100K and Harvard Climate Symposium and earned the Sustainable Investment Prize at the Rice Business Plan Competition. Before founding Active Surfaces alongside Richard Swartwout, Bhakta began his career in energy at Exxon, the US Department of Energy and MUUS. Active Surfaces has received over $300,000 in nondilutive capital from MIT and accelerators such as V4C (Venture For ClimateTech), ACCEL at Greentown Labs and Cleantech Open (CTO). Active Surfaces most recently participated in the Lee Kuan Yew Global Business Plan Competition in Singapore this September, winning over $100,000 in nondilutive capital. Read Less"
