        "text": "🚀 BIG NEWS from #Budget2024! 🚀 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman dropped a bombshell: Angel Tax is GONE for all tax classes! 🎉🙌 While this was being talked about in the last 3-4 weeks, since the formal confirmation has now come, the Indian startup scene is buzzing like never before. We've got innovation, ambition, and now, a little less taxation! 😜 So, what's the Angel Tax? ( You can check the image below too ) Despite its heavenly name, it’s been more of a devil in disguise for startups and investors. 😈 It’s a 30% tax on investments over the \"fair market value\" of shares 📜 Why should you care? 💸 Cash Crunch: Startups already tight on funds won't have this extra tax burden. 📈 Valuation Hurdles: No more squabbles over what your startup is worth. 🚀 Hampers Growth: More funds to fuel innovation and expansion. Who felt the pinch? 👶 Startups: Especially early-stage ones relying on angel investments. 👼 Angel Investors: It made them wary of betting on the next big thing. With the Angel Tax abolished, expect a flood of new investments. This is a HUGE step towards making India a global innovation hub. 🌏✨ Here’s to fewer taxes and more unicorns! 🦄 Cheers to a brighter future for startups! 🍻 Picture Credits: The Economic Times #BreakingNews #StartupIndia #AngelTax #Innovation #Entrepreneurship #FinanceMinister #Growth #IndiaRising\n\n🌟🌍 The Economic Survey 2024 drops a reality check: half of India's graduates aren't hitting the job market running. 😱 But hey, progress alert!

Let's embrace this challenge and turn it into an opportunity for growth and innovation! 💡 Youth unemployment has seen a sharp drop to 10%, and more women are stepping into the workforce than ever before. It's not just about numbers—it's about diversity driving our economy forward. 🚀 With initiatives like Skill India gaining momentum, there's a clear path to bridging the skills gap and empowering our youth for the jobs of tomorrow. 🌟 Let's rally together to champion skill development, foster entrepreneurship, and create an inclusive job market that works for everyone.

After being part of SaaS for some time now, I believe he couldn't have better said it. If you're someone who's just starting in SaaS sales, here are a few things that may help you: 1. Know Your Stuff: Learn everything you can about what you're selling. Knowing the ins and outs makes you confident and convincing. Understand the Logic behind & not just rote-learn stuff. 🤓 2. Nail Your Pitch: Craft a short, snappy pitch that grabs attention. Practice until it rolls off your tongue smoothly. You really shouldn't be fumbling while explaining your Org / Product 🙃 3. Do Your Homework: Before reaching out to someone, find out about them and their company. It helps you tailor your pitch. Respect the other person's time. 4. Listen Up: When talking to someone, listen more than you talk. It helps you understand their needs better and makes your pitch more relevant. This is something that most experienced people in Sales vouch for. As Hemingway puts it \"When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen.\" 👂 5. Ask for Feedback: Don't be shy to ask for advice from your team or customers. Their insights can help you improve. 6. Stay Positive: Keep your chin up! Sales can be tough, but every no gets you closer to a yes. Celebrate your wins along the way! As I read in one of HubSpot's blogs & completely agree that growth and comfort do not coexist. ❤️ #sdr #saas #sales"
