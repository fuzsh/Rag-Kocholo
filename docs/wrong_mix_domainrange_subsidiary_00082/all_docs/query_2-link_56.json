Using astrology as a basis of its matching algorithm, Astro allows for a dynamic social space for all kinds of users. Astro generates unique and individual birth charts for users, using the user’s birthday, birth-time, and birthplace. From these generated birth charts, Astro calculates the compatibility between users via it’s Astrology-based matching algorithm. The given compatibility rate is then analyzed via machine learning to further improve said matching algorithm. In regards to the practicality of using the field of astrology as the idea behind the matching algorithm and overall theme of Astro, various data supports that Astrology is popular enough to be commercially successful.\n\nTake for instance Co-Star, an AI-backed application capable of understanding astrological vernacular and giving daily personalized readings based on the user’s natal birth chart. Initially released in mid-2018, Co-Star currently has over 30.9K reviews with a total average rating of 4.9/5, making it the 9th most popular app in the lifestyle category on the App Store.\n\nTinder, the leading social search application, currently has over 100 million downloads on Google Play Store, earning it the #1 top grossing application. Astro seeks to improve upon on the Tinder experience by using the compatibility features present in Co-Star that allow users to see and understand their compatibility with their friends and strangers alike. In addition to its focus on providing users with a user-friendly and intuitive experience, Astro allows for the extensive social study of how people interact. The ultimate goal of Astro is to extend beyond the social search platform and become a brand.\n\nDue to astrology being free to all, the active engagement into the field with quality products and marketing should prove to be commercially successful, given the right steps are taken. An engaging mobile friendly experience is believed to be the first step.\n\nBiographies\n\nJennifer Rhau is a full-time Bachelor of Science, Computer Science major with an expected May 2020 graduation date.

Five percent may seem like a small number, but that totals over 360 million people across the globe. Although the medical industry provides hearing aids, we thought to further solve this problem through another technology, by introducing a wearable called Caption Glass: the glasses provide a text version of the voice spoken by the individuals while talking to a hearing disabled person. Caption Glass is a flexible, transparent glass that can be comfortably worn all the time, and the accompanying mobile application provides control of the glasses, and will be able to save historical conversations.\n\nThe mobile application delivers a good interface to the user and provides a chance to upload the conversations to the cloud and retrieved elsewhere. In addition to that, the updates to the device can be installed directly to the wearable through the app.\n\nFor example, if a hearing disabled person wants a attend a conference, Caption Glass helps the individual see the live conversations, and he will be able to save such talk on his mobile, so that he doesn’t miss any conversations.\n\nBiographies\n\nSagar Dekate is a graduate student at Pace University, Seidenberg School of CSIS.

Coakum's Buzzy Trail is a highly customizable, wearable GPS and Bluetooth tracker, that allows accurate location tracking of multiple different targets seamlessly. Initially, the device manufacturing will be subcontracted, while the software and technology are being developed in house. The product is currently in prototype development to be completed by June 2019, and a sales launch planned for the end of 2019.\n\nBuzzy Trail's target markets include, but are not limited to, family consumers. It is estimated that in America, approximately 460 thousand children are declared lost every year and approximately 4.5 million Alzheimer patients wander away from their homes at some point. In general, Americans spend about one year of their life on average looking for lost or misplaced items (US News and World Report) and spend 1.5 hours/day looking for misplaced objects. In that sense, the Buzzy trail application could greatly reduce these figures, by easily keeping track of loved ones and important objects. According to Grand View Research (2018), the GPS market will become a $146.4 billion market by 2025, with a CAGR of 18.4%. The North America market accounts for the largest market share, which is where Coakum aims to concentrate its initial marketing efforts to be a player in this segment in North America.\n\nCoakum’s biggest competitors are Trax, Pixie and Runner Up.

We want to change that and promote French culture around the country.\n\nFrencheese is an online cheese market that provides a large choice of cheeses, each very original, tasteful and accessible anywhere. The concept of the brand is to develop a whole gustatory experience for the costumer as he will subscribe annually to receive a new set of cheeses every month. Each new package will arrive with an explanation card about the product and degustation advice.\n\nOur products are “Made in France” as we will work directly with local farmers. By supporting small businesses and being environmentally-friendly, we want the create a concept-brand based on new tastes, high quality and enjoyable learning.\n\nWe will be the first online cheese market operating in the country. We do have competitors that are grocery stores and the 3200 cheese retailers practicing in France. But we will beat their offering by having more choices, and being easily accessible. So, we provide a sustainable solution for the 67% of French people that eat cheese almost every day.\n\nBiographies\n\nElma Claude is a sophomore French student at EDHEC Business School, studying Business at Pace University for the semester.

Talking about the design, the company would cover all types of LED designs on jackets, blazers, caps etc., that would glow while users are performing in their shows or out at a party. They can control the LED patterns, to make them look totally distinct in a crowd.\n\nThe company would be focused on all products, fully customizable with thousands of designs to pick from, from the website, with many colors available. It would work with phones through an application via Bluetooth, and colors could be changeable with one tap in the app. All the LEDs are covered with insulating material, and proper measures are taken in order to look-out for the safety of the customer.\n\nThis company is an e-commerce start-up, as the industry is growing widely and has good reach. A person goes to website or app, just selects the product, and customizes the LED design. Collaborations with magazines, bloggers, and social media influencers would help a lot in such a start-up.\n\nA few early collaborations with schools and colleges with free giveaways and competitions would let people explore the clothes, that would boost their confidence and make then stand out.\n\nBiographies\n\nAbhay Mahajan is a full-time international student in the Pace University Seidenberg School of CSIS, pursuing an M.S. in Enterprise Analytics, expecting to graduate in May 2020.

If an accident happens in the middle of nowhere, or in the middle of the night, Guardian Angel will operate. For example, drivers in the middle of the night, in rural areas, might fall asleep at the wheel, have an accident, and may desperately need immediate help.\n\nTo save those people we created a bracelet that can sense the force of a potential accident, record the movement, and analyze the best treatment to the first responders when they arrive. The bracelet also records the personal details, previous medical conditions and insurance paperwork, and can provide it to the responder, reducing delays while saving the person, and further reduce costs.\n\nWhen the accident happens, Guardian Angel not only sends out the location and information to the nearest hospital, but will also automatically contact family and instruct them where to find and meet their loved ones.\n\nThe work of this application is reliant on sensors and instruments to adequately provide information to first responders.\n\nThe future scope of this application is to be licensed and deployed on all wearable devices therefore making it platform independent. Later, this technology can not only be implemented on wearables, but also other objects such as bicycles, strollers, or automobiles.\n\nBiographies\n\nWilfred Luiz, 26, is currently a graduate student at the Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems, Pace University.

He enjoys collaborating, and pitching new and innovative ideas in small, creative teams. He feels that asking good questions is an important skill that allows, strong critical thinking skills, and understanding of technology and human psychology.\n\nHearingHelper\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n“HearingHelper” is an app that will read the subtitles of a movie or video out loud to the viewer in order to help them understand more clearly what is being said. It will focus on the dialogue in the movie and will convert it to a text-to-speech voice.\n\nMany people with hearing difficulties may have to listen to a video multiple times in order to understand what words are being said in the video. This product will be aimed at those with hearing disabilities, since they oftentimes will have trouble understanding what is being said in a video. While subtitles can help with this issue, they may not be accurate if they are done automatically, and they aren’t useful if the person also has visual impairments or has trouble reading text for whatever reason, such as if they are a young child or if the subtitles aren’t in a language that they’re familiar with.\n\nAdditionally, many people with hearing issues are older, and they also often have visual impairments, meaning that subtitles might not help them either. Depending on the video, simply raising the volume of the video may not help the viewer understand the dialogue in the video.\n\nAnother benefit of this app would be that it would help viewers understand dialogue in videos that have poor audio quality, since the voice used would be able to clearly enunciate the words being said. One feature of this app would be allowing the user to pick from a variety of voices and accents, so that they would be able to pick a voice that they can understand clearly. There would also be a feature that would allow the user to slow down the audio and change the pitch, in order to further help them understand what is being said.\n\nPlatforms like Netflix have something similar, where they use a text-to-speech voice to describe what is happening in a show to help those with visual impairments. These have been very successful and have benefited those who use it. However, many video platforms, such as YouTube and Hulu don’t have similar aids for those with disabilities. Even Netflix’s doesn’t help with audio, and only describes the visuals to the viewer, meaning that this app would be able to improve shows from Netflix as well.\n\nBiographies\n\nAdil Sanai is a student at the Seidenberg School of CSIS at Pace University, and is part of the Pace Inclusion Program for students with developmental disabilities. He has been studying computer science at Pace since 2013, and he is very passionate about it. He comes from Pakistan, and moved to the United States in 1999. He previously participated in the Pace Pitch Contest in 2016, with an idea for a calendar app for students with disabilities.\n\nOurah\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis is an application dedicated to intern seekers on one hand and companies on the other.\n\nToday it is hard to find an internship because of the process. Intern seekers send their CV to postings but don’t receive an answer. This is quite frustrating. On the other hand, companies are looking for interns but don’t find the one they want.\n\nSo, the goal of the app is to create a bridge between students and companies. The process would be much more pleasant and easier.\n\nHow it works?\n\nThe process will simplify looking for an internship, and the process of recruiting for the company. There would be two sides in the app depending on the profile (intern seeker or company). Then, each user would have to develop and create their own profile. For the company there would have a brand image with a short description of the job offer and their values. On the other side, intern seekers would create their own page with a picture, personal information and CV.\n\nThen, as the Tinder application, people will just have to slide profiles until they match. After the match, they get in touch.\n\nNow, it is important to know how to earn money:\n\nThere would have a free tier with ads, but there is also a premium option: intern seekers would be on the top of the list and would have more visibility. It is the same for the company which in this case would be on the top of the offers. Also, it will be $100 per company for intern hired. These are the main revenues of the OURAH application.\n\nOur cost would be to create the application and the marketing campaign.\n\nMoreover, best of our knowledge, there is no application in America specialized on the internship student market.\n\nTo conclude, as students looking for internships each year, we think that this application can be very useful. Moreover, knowing more about the company achievement and grades is important before applying or not for a job. By receiving a grade, company would have to work on their social impact. Their results would be displayed everywhere which would force them to do their best.\n\nBiographies\n\nLouise Bonnier is a junior at the EDHEC Business School, Nice, France, where she is pursuing a degree in Business Management, and is studying a semester here at Pace University, Lubin School of Business in New York.

VYOU then showcases “politically-charged” apparel that correlates with online discussions. Once a customer decides to purchase, VYOU provides customers with the opportunity to donate proceeds of their purchase into the grass-roots efforts to affect the change they wish to see. Essentially, VYOU provides customers with the opportunity to “power their purchase” by buying a better tomorrow, today.\n\nWith an increase in political activism, consumer support of political brands has grown immensely. According to studies conducted by The Shelton Group, 86% of consumers believe that companies should take a stance on social issues. Of that percentage, 64% of those consumers are more likely to purchase from a company that pledges towards a cause. Despite these statistics demonstrating consumer demand, many companies have yet to engage in transparent political activism. Furthermore, consumers have yet to find a retail company that directly fuels democracy rather than lining corporate pockets with faux social movement-driven profits.\n\nHowever, VYOU is different. VYOU is a non-profit that works to harness the immense amount consumer intellect and purchasing power through an integrative business model that emphasizes both capital maximization and social progression while directly benefiting the lives of its customers’ communities. VYOU will target customers of all ages that are either drawn to fashion or political/cultural content. As there is no age to become involved in one’s community, VYOU’s merchandising will be inclusive of various style types to appropriately fit a variety of styles. To gauge its success, VYOU considers its key success indicators to include units sold, conversations started, donations made, and lives impacted.\n\nVYOU is seeking both an investment and mentor that would kick-start operations and begin its journey to changing the lives of many Americans.\n\nBiographies\n\nBrennan Bodin is a fashion industry professional that has held various roles at companies such as Salvatore Ferragamo, Barneys New York, Esquire Magazine, Rent the Runway, Tod’s, Roger Vivier, and many more.
