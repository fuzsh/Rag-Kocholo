        "text": "“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars”\n\nThe SEC’s new proposed climate rules have unprecedented implications for investors, companies, government entities, managers, boards, taxpayers (covered in part 1) and auditors, standard setters and market participants interested in financial reporting (in part 2). The new rules set the stage for a political fight that will be equally unprecedented.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exists to ensure that publicly-traded companies are playing fair and keeping shareholders informed of events that could impact their investment. For decades, the ESG community has recognized the power the SEC could wield if it chose to force companies to explain what they’re doing – or not doing – to reduce their climate footprint.\n\nThat’s why last week’s release of a 510-page document on proposed rules is a landmark event. This is only the first step toward a requirement that the business community increase disclosure on climate, and we’re likely in for a bumpy ride as this process moves forward.\n\nThe SEC is asking firms to disclose a number of pivotal items, including:\n\n· How company leaders are managing climate risks\n\n· How and whether climate risks will have a material impact on the company’s business in the short-, medium- or, long term (terms not defined in the rules)\n\n· How climate risk affects the company’s strategy and outlook\n\n· What process the company follows to identify, assess and manage climate risk and whether such process is integrated with the firm’s overall risk management system\n\n· How climate events and transition activities impact a company’s financial statements, capital expenditures, and their financial estimates and assumptions\n\n· How much greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) the company is responsible for – both directly and indirectly – in aggregate, absolute and intensity, which is emissions in aggregate or per unit of output or revenue\n\n· What goals the company has set for climate risk and transition\n\nMy summary take on the rules:\n\nThe questions on most minds after reading the proposed rules:\n\n· What would having this data mean overall for ESG and efforts to curb climate change?\n\n· Would forced disclosure of a company’s harmful climate impact be influential in changing corporate behavior?\n\n· And perhaps, even more important, given the scale and scope of this proposed regulation, will it ever garner political support from both sides of the aisle to pass?\n\nMy conjecture: the new rules, if passed as is, will elevate climate to a top agenda item for boards and managers and compliance costs will be high as small and medium sized companies will get caught in the cross fire. Forced disclosure might help level inconsistencies in reporting but will also invite inevitable greenwashing around the new rules and political pushback. The only real answer to our climate woes is probably innovation, both in engineering and markets, and a carbon tax that only Congress can pass.\n\nClimate reporting may be the third-best, not even the second-best, way of focusing corporate minds on the climate problem. But, we live in a world where Congress does not seem to want to act on the climate problem, the political right will fight the new SEC rules as outreach, the Supreme Court wants to curb the Environment Protection Agency (EPA)’s mandate and consumers cannot get out of oil because we have not offered them a viable alternative or the incentives to switch to something greener. So, what is the way out of this impasse?\n\nUltimately, the buck has to stop with Congress. The SEC provides a band-aid in the meanwhile.\n\nSetting my ideological and emotional bias aside, the SEC’s rules are far reaching changes, as explained later, almost to the point where you might imagine that the SEC was dormant for roughly 100 years since its inception and woke up last week to publish the roughly 25,000 pages that reportedly cover U.S. GAAP, except this time for climate! I exaggerate, of course, but not by much. My take is that the rules are so radical as to constitute an opening political gambit in a protracted negotiation with conservative politicians. Perhaps the SEC chief anticipates the pushback and will settle for a watered-down compromise after the political knife fights are all done and the dust settles.\n\nIn part I, I cover the far reaching implications of the new rules for investors, managers, boards, companies, government entities and for taxpayers. I will cover implications for auditors, standard setting and financial reporting in part II.\n\n1.0 Far reaching implications for investors\n\n1.1 How material is climate risk for companies and are mandatory disclosures necessary?\n\nOne of the more curious statistics reported by the SEC (on page 316) is that climate related keywords appear in only 31% of the 5,791 10-Ks filed between June 2019 and December 2020. In slightly older work, we found that barely 25% of firms reported even scope 1 emissions in 2019. Should we expect a lot of under-reporting or misreporting or is climate risk material only to a third of U.S. publicly listed firms? The SEC assumes under-reporting but I am not sure that companies for whom climate risk was material have not said something about climate in their 10-Ks before this rule came out.\n\nThe SEC cites numerous studies around page 356 that claim ESG and emissions information moves stock markets and mandatory disclosure will likely improve liquidity, lower cost of capital, and firm valuations. Climate is obviously one sliver of ESG, albeit a critical one, but less studied in the U.S. because of incomplete and relatively un-comparable data. I have questions about several of these studies the SEC references especially because dissenting studies are regrettably not cited.\n\nYou could always argue that studies to date document the relationship between ESG performance and financial performance but that is a different issue relative to benefits and costs of climate disclosures. Moreover, climate data in these studies, however imperfect, were not based on mandated disclosures. But the rule maker is always doomed to guess what the impact of new mandatory requirements will be based on extrapolations based on voluntary disclosures from before. To the SECs’ credit, it candidly admits (on page 349), that “we are unable to reliably quantify these potential benefits and costs” of mandatory climate disclosures.\n\nAt the end of day, will we ever know whether the rules will add more shareholder and societal value? Can we ever present evidence to change people’s minds on an issue? The other side will find faults with your methodology and I will be tempted to do the same with their work and the infinite loop of evidence based arguments continues. Hence, these new rules will become another Rorschach test of what a reader wants to see based on her political and ideological bent on climate risk.\n\n1.2 Requirement to disclose climate impact of financial statement line items and capital expenditure (capex)\n\nPages 54 and 129 of the rules seem to say that the SEC is looking for the impact of climate risks and opportunities on financial performance (income statement), financial position (balance sheet,) and on suggested metrics such as capex deployed to address climate risk and opportunities. This is a wow moment! Why?\n\nThe modern income statement, by and large, reports six lines of information (revenues, cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, income taxes and net income). Data is presented at such an aggregated level that a serious investor has to work very hard to assess whether the company is financially sustainable. As I have written before, can someone please tell me what are materials consumed by the business (hidden in cost of goods sold), the labor costs incurred by the business (hidden in cost of goods sold, and SGA), the maintenance capex required, which is capex that the company has to invest in simply to retain the companies’ current share in the product market.\n\nAlthough we have no line by line disclosures on these bread and butter issues such as materials, labor or maintenance capex, the SEC appears to have asked for how climate affects individual line items on a financial statement and for the capex related to climate. Amazing ambition, as I said earlier.\n\n1.3 Will these disclosures deter greenwashing and promote managerial commitment?\n\nYes. On the one hand, detailed disclosure of dodgy mechanisms such as carbon offsets (page 82) will bring some discipline to the offset market. Repeated worries have been expressed that offsets rarely provide “additionality” or reduce carbon in the environment and hence a majority of carbon offsets sold provide no real offset to GHG emissions at all.\n\nHowever, many of the SEC’s detailed disclosures are predicated on whether a firm has a transition plan, whether a company uses scenario analysis under a 2 or 3 centigrade warming world, whether a firm uses an internal carbon price or whether it makes a carbon reduction pledge, and so on. On the margin, a potential new adopter might hesitate to start using these management tools because they would rather not open management’s kimono.\n\n1.4 Should investors worry about risks that may manifest 30 years out?\n\nThe SEC has explicitly not defined what it considers to be “long term.” Some may argue that climate risks are likely to materially affect companies 20-30 years out. Is it appropriate for a reporting rule making body to ask companies to disclose data that might affect cash flows that far out? I think “Yes” for two reasons. First, the big three passive indexers—BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street—own the entire market (“the universal owner” idea) and some version of these investors will continue to hold stock for 30 years. Second, do we not make companies disclose pensions and post-retirement health care data? Yes, they are based on actuarial assumptions, but the actual cash outflow is probably unlikely to come due for two or three decades depending on how old your workforce is.\n\n2.0 Far reaching implications for companies\n\n2.1 Ambiguity about organizational boundaries in the value chain\n\nPage 61 defines “climate related risks” to mean “actual or potential negative impacts of climate-related conditions” on a firm’s “consolidated financial statements, business operations or value chains, as a whole.” Value chain is defined as “upstream and downstream activities related to a firm’s operations.” Does this mean that the company is responsible, implicitly or otherwise, for climate risk from supplier to the customer, including private firms in that ecosystem? If yes, that would be unprecedented. The ruling only applies to listed companies but if they are responsible for the entire value chain it raises the question of how they are going to get the necessary data from private companies?\n\nPage 213 is more nuanced in that the SEC states, “except for calculating scope 3 emissions, the proposed rules would not require a registrant to disclose the emissions from investments that are not consolidated, proportionately consolidated, or that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting.” So, the accounting definition of organizational boundaries based on control, is well entrenched for now, even for scope 1 and 2 disclosures. The restricted nature of scope 1 and 2 is at odds with the more expansive definition of scope 3.\n\nCan oil and gas companies, for instance, move title of their oil wells to an off-balance sheet entity and simply receive a management fee from such entity for managing the wells? Should we exempt that oil and gas firm from reporting scope 1 emissions associated with that off balance sheet entity? Or do they automatically get redesignated as scope 3?\n\nBottomline, I am still unclear about the organizational boundaries that the SEC has in mind.\n\n2.2 Disclosure requirements and compliance costs\n\nThe rules ask for a lot of new information and, of course, for assurance associated with certifying some of such information. For instance, on page 62 the rules say that firms are required to consider (i) physical risks such as those associated with hurricanes, floods, or tornadoes; (ii) chronic risks that businesses may face as a result of longer term weather patterns; and (iii) transition risks that would include increased costs attributable to climate-related changes in law or policy, reduced market demand for carbon intensive products, and the like. At a more granular level, page 74 states that in regions of highwater stress, for instance, the firm has to quantify the assets, in dollar terms, in such location. Or, if flooding is a material risk, the company has to disclose the percentage of assets in flood hazard areas. And so on.\n\nI wonder how many U.S. firms, especially mid sized and smaller ones, have thought about physical and chronic risks this deep and hard. There is bound to be a flurry of consultants rushing to provide services to think through these risks which will, of course, cost a lot of money. How much?\n\nOn page 390, the SEC estimates costs in the first year of compliance to be around $640,000 and annual costs in subsequent years to be $530,000 for larger companies. On page 399, the SEC estimates assurance costs for large companies to be around $75,000 to $145,000. On the surface, these look like rounding errors relative to say audit and non-audit fees paid by large U.S. companies. But these estimates look a tad low to me. A well done academic paper estimated the average annual costs of complying with section 404(b) for accelerated filers at $1.2 million.\n\nI suspect complying with these climate rules will cost much more. Even if we were to quadruple the $1.2 million number, will these requirements cost more than $5 million per firm? In some cases, “yes” would be my guess. We do not have enough climate expertise in a business context in most companies. Drones and satellite data cost money.\n\nThe current practice of gathering climate data from the value chain usually involves sending voluminous questionnaires to suppliers. Companies hope that suppliers return reliable data. Direct verification of that data is likely to be quite expensive unless we start relying on a chain letter of certificates of good behavior from suppliers who, in turn, extract certificates of good conduct from their suppliers and so on.\n\n2.3 Are parallel disclosures for government bodies next?\n\nThe SEC states, on page 59, that climate risks may arise from potential adoption of climate regulatory policies including those necessary to achieve national climate goals adopted in the U.S. and elsewhere. If so, why stop with public companies? What about similar rules for government controlled entities such as the U.S. postal service, the Department of Defense, Health and Human Services and the vast federal and state bureaucracy, given that government spending seems to account for 35- 44% of GDP in the last few years? Will climate reporting be next on the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB)’s agenda?\n\n2.4 The SEC and class action lawyers can now come after firms for climate risk disclosures\n\nI have often wondered why we do not observe more litigation surrounding climate and ESG disclosures against both companies and funds that hold stocks of companies. Perhaps an enforcement nudge from the SEC would help. Page 299 states that the “proposed climate-related disclosures…are subject to potential liability under Exchange Act section 18” and under “section 11.” Section 18 attributes liability to \"[a]ny person who shall make or cause to be made” a material misstatement. Section 11 provides investors with the ability to hold issuers, officers, underwriters, and others liable for damages caused by untrue statements of fact or material omissions of fact within registration statements.\n\n3.0 Far reaching implications for management and directors\n\nClimate director, Chief climate officer and a Climate risk committee?\n\nThe new rules (page 100) require the company to (i) identify any board member or board committee responsible for climate-related risks (although this responsibility can be folded into the risk or audit committee’s purview); (ii) board members who have expertise in climate risks; (iii) processes and frequency which the board discusses climate risks; (iv) how the board sets climate goals and how it oversees progress towards those goals; and (v) how the board considers climate risks as part of its business strategy, risk management, and financial oversight. Parallel requirements appear for members of management.\n\nWill we see a new labor market in climate directors, chief climate officer in management (CCO), and a climate risk committee? Does the SEC believe that boards and managements, as of now, are inadequately skilled and informed about climate risk? Why?\n\n4.0 Far reaching implications for taxpayers\n\nCan we tax carbon unless we measure it?\n\nOne of the questions raised by the SEC proposal on page 57 relates to how investors will use these disclosures. This is a bit odd because the early parts of the document claim that “climate risks have present financial consequences that investors in public companies consider in making investment and voting decisions” (page 9). If investors already consider the consequences, do we need to know that they will use the new disclosures? To be sure, the question is complicated. My guess is that the voting motivation for large public companies, as of now, is stronger than the investing motivation. Why?\n\nCarbon emissions are not robustly priced into stock returns in the U.S. as of now. Why? Because we do not have reliable data as barely 30% of U.S. firms voluntarily disclose emissions data, an issue that will get addressed by the new rules should they pass. More importantly, who is going to make firms pay for the negative externalities imposed by emissions? Perhaps the rules are a precursor to an eventual carbon tax.\n\nTaxing carbon, is obviously, outside the SEC’s authority and would probably take an (unlikely) act of Congress. But, you cannot tax some construct, say income, unless you have processes and systems to measure income. In the same spirit, the SEC’s rules, should they pass, will require companies to put enough boots on the ground, buy software, hire skilled climate aware personnel, to compile reasonably high-quality data on emissions that can eventually be taxed.\n\nHaving said that, a few simple estimates I had run a while back suggest that at least 60% of U.S. firms will suffer at least a 10% fall in profits should their scope 1,2, and 3 emissions be taxed at a modest $50 a ton of carbon and if they were unable to pass these taxes on to the ultimate customer (even if they do, that will cause knock-on inflation, of course). A 10% fall in income is a lot and explains the potential political and lobbying blowback that is brewing for the SEC’s rules.\n\nTo be continued…."
