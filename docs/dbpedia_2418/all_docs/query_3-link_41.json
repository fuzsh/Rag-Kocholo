        "text": "The Annual Achievement Award recognizes individuals or an organization who have made outstanding contributions, nationally and/or internationally, to cancer care and to patients with cancer.\n\nThe 2020 award recipient is Lawrence N. Shulman, MD, MACP, FASCO, Professor of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania; Deputy Director for Clinical Services, Abramson Cancer Center. Dr. Shulman is internationally known as a breast medical oncologist, oncology practice thought leader, and mentor. His breast cancer work in low-resourced areas throughout the United States and overseas have led to a significant improvement in patient outcomes in areas where women are at a greater risk.\n\nLawrence N. Shulman, MD, MACP, FASCO is Professor of Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, where he is the Deputy Director for Clinical Services of the Abramson Cancer Center. Dr. Shulman leads the Cancer Quality program and strategic development of Cancer Services across the University of Pennsylvania Health System’s 6 hospitals and affiliated practices. He is also Director of the Center for Global Cancer Medicine.\n\nDr. Shulman is internationally known as a breast medical oncologist, oncology practice thought leader, and mentor. His work in low-resourced areas throughout the United States and overseas is particularly notable. Dr. Shulman and his colleagues trained hundreds of clinicians in breast health care and provided breast exam screening to thousands of patients in four districts of Rwanda. Their efforts have led to a significant improvement in patient outcomes in an area where women have a much higher risk of dying of breast cancer.\n\n“What he’s achieved through his work in countries like Rwanda, Haiti, and Botswana is remarkable. For example, Dr. Shulman and his colleagues trained hundreds of clinicians in breast health care and provided breast exam screening to thousands of patients in four districts of Rwanda. Their efforts have led to a significant improvement in patient outcomes in an area where women have a much higher risk of dying of breast cancer.” - Dr. Randall A.

Herbst, MD, PhD, Ensign Professor of Medicine (Medical Oncology) & Professor of Pharmacology; Chief of Medical Oncology, Yale Cancer Center & Smilow Cancer Hospital; Associate Director for Translational Research, Yale Cancer Center; Interim Director, Yale Center for Immuno-oncology, Yale Cancer Center. Dr. Herbst has worked over several decades as a pioneer to identify biomarkers and bring novel targeted treatments and immunotherapies to patients, serving as principal investigator for numerous clinical trials testing these agents in advanced stage lung cancers.\n\nHis work led to the approval of several therapies that have revolutionized the field and greatly improved patient survival. His work on \"umbrella” trials spurred FDA approvals of targeted therapies and new cancer drugs. Nationally, he works closely with public-private partnerships to develop large master protocol clinical studies, such as Lung-MAP.\n\n“Dr. Herbst was selected for this award based on his distinguished and effective accomplishments in lung cancer research, having successfully integrated biology and laboratory research, team- based science, broad collaboration, and community, patient, public, and private partnerships that have served as a road map and role model for others. The work of Dr. Herbst and his team has importantly led to the approval of several treatments that have revolutionized lung cancer care, improved patient survival, and changed patient expectations.” – Dr. Randall A.
