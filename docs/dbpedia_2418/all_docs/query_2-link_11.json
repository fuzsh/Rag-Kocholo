American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG)\n\nHow to integrate #sustainability standards into the #mining industry of the future ‚õèÔ∏è Sustainability will be a game changer for the mining industry. Curious to know how mining companies can profit from integrating mining standards into their day-to-day business? With the global spotlight on sustainability, mining companies are feeling the pressure to innovate and adapt. The real question is no longer if, but how quickly and effectively #ESG (environmental, social, governance) goals can be woven into every level of operations. The recent launch of the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) implementation guidelines and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures' (TNFD) sector-specific disclosure frameworks are important milestones for the mining industry. üëâüèª Read more about DMT GROUP¬¥s consulting services on ESG and the latest standards in sustainable mining here: https://lnkd.in/eYDdd6af Want to join the sustainability revolution in mining? Dive into the details and let's start a conversation about how we can make mining greener and more responsible. Contact DMT GROUP¬¥s sustainability lead Daria Goncharova to learn more about how you can adopt mining standards into your business on the road towards sustainable mining.\n\nWhat speaks for us are our employees: Supporting our #international colleagues to start a successful career at DMT GROUP with Katharina Martin-Rollmann, Deputy Head Human Resources at DMT Katharina and her team in DMT‚Äôs HR department know what is important if you have an international background and want to grow your career with us in Germany.

For example with verifications! Here you can see our DMT expert Lukas F√∂rster who is conducting with Herman Cornelissen an on-site verification of working conditions and material sourcing at small-scale mica mines in the south of Madagascar. #Mica, a group of silicate minerals, is essential for modern electric car batteries, electric wiring and many other components in construction or cosmetics. Madagascar has significant amounts of mica of excellent quality and often supplies refiners in China, which then distribute the mica to major car manufacturers in Europe and elsewhere. Mica from Madagascar is usually extracted by artisanal and small-scale mining (#ASM) using manual tools and labor-intensive methods. ‚ÄúTherefore, verification of mica plays a vital role in ensuring compliance with established #ESG standards and safeguarding the integrity of global supply chains‚Äù, Lukas F√∂rster points out. DMT‚Äôs verification of the respective mine sites assessed the compliance of the mica mines with the established ESG standard for these operations: RMI‚Äôs mica #CRAFT Code. The CRAFT code is an open source tool that supports ASM operators in responsible mining. DMT remains committed to accountable, responsible minerals sourcing and ESG performance. Our international teams are travelling the globe to ensure the integrity of the supply chains to responsible manufacturers. You want to know more about ESG compliance, supply chain integrity, and responsible sourcing? Please feel free to reach out to Lukas F√∂rster or Herman Cornelissen. #engineeringperformance\n\nExploring geotechnical frontiers: Insights from #Eurock2024 At the ISRM European Rock Mechanics Symposium in Alicante, Spain, our DMT experts Torsten Gorka and Florian Beier presented insights from a comprehensive #geotechnical study conducted at an iron ore site in Uzbekistan. This study and the analysis of geotechnical and structural data are key to mineral reserve estimation and strategic mine planning, including innovative mining concepts, pit optimisation, layout design, sequencing, long-term scheduling and equipment selection. Eurock provided a platform for our team and all attendees to engage with global perspectives, exchange ideas and explore new approaches in rock mechanics. A special highlight for our team was the geological exploration tour along the north coast of Alicante. This boat trip, where they were shown and explained the unique geological features of the area, allowed them to understand the relationship between the current coastal landscape and the geological history of Alicante ‚Äì a unique experience for all participants. Many thanks to the International Society for Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering (ISRM) and University of Alicante for organising this event and creating this experience to share our insights and engage with industry professionals. To find out more about the geotechnical study in Uzbekistan and discuss the future of geotechnical exploration, get in touch with us and connect with our experts."
