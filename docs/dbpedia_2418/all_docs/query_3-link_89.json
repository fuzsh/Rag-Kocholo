        "text": "This formula is here to bring comfort to your Little One's belly. HiPP Comfort German All-Stages is a gentle, easy-to-digest formula suitable for babies of all ages, including older babies and toddlers who have begun eating solid foods. Comfort is designed with a reduced lactose content, offering relief from common issues such as colic, constipation, bloating, and gas. For little ones with a sensitive digestive system, it can loosen the baby's stool and regulate bowel movements through its unique formulation. HiPP Comfort's unique blend of maltodextrin and starch results in a creamy texture that helps keep your baby full and content after feedings. No more fussy, hungry babies, just happy little ones!\n\nTo strengthen your babyâ€™s gut microbiome and immune system and to promote overall digestive health, HiPP Comfort features both prebiotics (galacto-oligosaccharides derived from lactose) and probiotics (lactic acid bacteria cultures similar to those found in breast milk). Prebiotics and probiotics may also help to alleviate uncomfortable symptoms like colic and gas, and they can help soften stools to ease constipation. Along with many essential vitamins and minerals, HiPP Comfort also contains omega-3 and omega-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (including DHA and ARA), which are thought to contribute to the healthy development of the brain, eyes, and nervous systems in young children.\n\nUnlike many US-produced formulas, HiPP Comfort contains no corn syrup, glucose syrup, or sucrose. You'll find no GMO ingredients, synthetic nutrients, or artificial preservatives here. Just premium, healthy ingredients for your baby's growth.\n\nManufactured and packaged in Germany, HiPP Comfort has been designed to approximate the breast milk's taste, smell, and consistency as much as possible. If this formula is not 100% what you're looking for, please consider one of our other specialty Formulas for Sensitive Tummies. Your little one deserves nothing but the best, and HiPP is here to provide just that. ðŸŒŸ\n\nNeed help deciding which formula to choose?
