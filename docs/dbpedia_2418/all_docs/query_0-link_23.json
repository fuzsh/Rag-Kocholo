Anaesthesiology Trainees Simulation-based Assessment (ATSA)-Study: Assessing Anaesthesiology trainees in Germany and Spain: a pilot study\n\nGerard Sergi Angeles Fite1, Sara García Ballester2, Federico Migliorelli Falcone3, Lidia Gómez López3, Raquel Bergé, Cristina Ibañez Esteve3, Juan Manuel PERDOMO3, Tomás Cuñat3, Johannes Schäfer4, Christopher Neuhaus4, Albert Carramiñana3, Beatriz Tena3, Miriam Fiore Panzeri3, Ricard Valero3\n\n1Universitätsspital Bern (University Hospital of Bern), 2Bellvitge University Hospital, 3Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, 4Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1): O1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDespite efforts of the European Anaesthesiology organisations on harmonizing postgraduate training (1,2), by establishing a common European curriculum (3) and a European end-of-training examination (4), European training programs differ greatly (1,5,6). Medical simulations are wide used in Anaesthesiology training (1,5). Specific tools enable the assessment of residents’ skills in simulated scenarios (7–11), but its use in assessment of Anaesthesiology residents from different training programs across Europe is not well established yet (1,3,5).\n\nThe objective of this study was to compare Anaesthesiology residents from two different training systems, combining knowledge evaluation with simulation-based assessment of clinical and non-technical skills.\n\nMethods\n\nWe performed an observational simulation-based study with anaesthesiology residents in 3rd and 4th year from university hospitals in Germany and Spain. The individual evaluation of each resident consisted of: a) a multiple-choice test (MCQ) based on the European end-of-training examination (4), b) an assessment of clinical skills in two simulated scenarios using a specific scoring-grid based on current guidelines and adapted from existing tools (7,8), and c) an assessment of non-technical skills in two simulated scenarios using a well-validated tool (9). Two scenarios were specifically designed to assess core competencies from the European curriculum (3). The performance of each participant was video-recorded. The assessment of clinical and non-technical skills was performed by two evaluators. Data and characteristics of the participants and their training programs were collected in a survey.\n\nData are presented as medians (with interquartile ranges). For both clinical and non-technical skills, the mean values from the scores given by each evaluator were used. The results for each group were compared using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nWe enrolled 43 Anaesthesiology residents, 19 in Spain and 24 in Germany, 23 in 3rd and 20 in 4th year of training in anaesthesiology. The characteristics of the participants were similar in both groups. Results are shown in table 1. The knowledge test, the clinical skills assessment and the non-technical skills assessment were able to distinguish between 3rd and 4th year residents, but there were no significant differences in none of the assessments between the Spanish and the German cohort. In conclusion, the multidimensional assessment model used in our study was able to discriminate between 3rd and 4th year residents in both cohorts, demonstrating validity, but did not show differences among residents from two different training systems.\n\nKeywords\n\nAnaesthesiology, Post-graduate medical education, Post-graduate assessment\n\nReferences\n\nVan Gessel EF, Ostergard HT, Niemi-Murola L.

Assessing Student Empathy Elicited After In-Person and Screen-Based Poverty Simulations\n\nAshleigh Allgood1, Anita Samaniego-Avellana1, Dawn Taylor Peterson1, Michelle R. Brown1\n\n1University of Alabama at Birmingham\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O2\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham championed a multidisciplinary pedagogical venture, the Poverty Simulation, to immerse students across various disciplines in realistic socio-economic scenarios. Over eight years, this initiative has engaged thousands of students to foster a deeper understanding of the barriers their future patients might encounter. Although the primary focus was on enhancing awareness of poverty-related barriers, we performed a retrospective examination of students' reflective evaluations post-simulation and classified their qualitative responses into a tripartite empathy framework.\n\nDescription\n\nAt our institution, we implemented a poverty simulation both in person and screen-based. Both modalities are followed by a structured debrief which focused on three objectives: 1) challenges faced navigating life in poverty, 2) decisions made that impacted family and income, 3) Insights gained as to how healthcare professionals can work together to meet the needs of individuals with low income. The debriefings are designed to promote interprofessional reflection and dialogue among students from diverse fields, enhancing the collaborative learning experience. Post-simulation, students are prompted to complete qualitative evaluations sharing lessons learned. These evaluations were retrospectively analyzed with empathetic statement classified into cognitive, emotional, or behavioral empathy.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nIt is important to train future healthcare providers how to empathetically care for those in socioeconomical hardship. In addition to confirming the simulations evoked empathy, further analysis was conducted to understand what type of empathy was elicited. We used the following definitions for our empathy framework:\n\nCognitive: understanding what others think.\n\nEmotional: feeling what others feel.\n\nBehavioral: taking action to help others.\n\nWe had a three-person team classify qualitative data into the three types of empathy. Two people were involved in the original classification and a third person adjudicated any discrepancies. The analysis demonstrated that students revealed cognitive, emotional, and behavioral empathy during the simulation, irrespective of format. Overwhelmingly, students responded with cognitively empathic statements for both the in person and screen-based poverty simulations. For instance, one student noted ‘I gained insight as to how/why parents aren't able to always be active in their kid’s life,’ another remarked ‘Even if someone is doing their best, circumstance may still stand in the way of them doing what I think is right or best for them.’ Additional analysis will be shared in the presentation delving into a comprehensive review of the types of empathy evoked after participation in both modalities of the simulation.\n\nKeywords\n\nEmpathy, Qualitative, Reflection\n\nReference\n\nEmpatico.

Assessment of Attitudes Towards Teamwork among Pharmacy Students in a COVID-19 Emergency Scenario: Interprofessional Virtual Simulation Training\n\nKrttin Bunditanukul1, Jiraphan Ritsamdang1, Navaporn Worashilchai2, Khuansiri Narajeenron3\n\n1Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn, 2Faculty of Allied Health Sciences Chulalongkorn University, 3Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O3\n\nIntroduction\n\nEffective teamwork is pivotal in emergencies, especially during unprecedented crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual simulation training presents an innovative approach to hone teamwork skills among pharmacy students preparing to practice in emergency departments. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the simulation on improving teamwork attitudes among pharmacy students in a simulated severe COVID-19 pneumonia scenario within an emergency department.\n\nMethods\n\nEleven pharmacy students in their third and fourth professional years participated in a COVID-19 emergency scenario using a computer-based 3D platform. This training encompassed introductory, pre-training, simulation, and debrief sessions spanning multiple days. Only one pharmacy student and five other healthcare students participated in each round, including one medical student, two nursing students, one medicinal technology and one radiology student. They managed a simulated patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in an emergency department. We conducted baseline and post-training assessments using the validated TeamSTEPPS Teamwork Attitudes Questionnaire (T-TAQ).\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nThe overall mean baseline T-TAQ score was 120.45 ± 9.89, with significantly improved post-training at 132.37 ± 7.67 (Hedges' g = 1.506, p < 0.001). Specifically, three domains demonstrated statistically significant gains post-training. These included 'Team Structure,' which saw the most substantial improvement (Hedges' g = 2.435, p < 0.001), followed by ‘Mutual Support’ (Hedges' g = 1.397, p < 0.001), and ‘Situation Monitoring’ (Hedges' g = 0.765, p < 0.025), respectively. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pneumonia simulation training effectively enhances teamwork attitudes among pharmacy students, preparing them for collaborative roles in high-pressure emergency healthcare settings. This simulation approach, especially noteworthy in 'Team Structure,' 'Mutual Support,' and 'Situation Monitoring,' showcases the potential of virtual training technology to improve interprofessional collaboration. Future research should explore its long-term effects on preparedness and adaptability, further advancing pharmacy education and emergency care outcomes.\n\nKeywords\n\nSimulation Training; Virtual Simulation; Pharmacy Education; TeamSTEPPS\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAcknowledgements to the ERVIPE Study Group and the Second Century Fund, Chulalongkorn University.\n\nO4. Challenges and opportunities in the uptake of simulation in healthcare education in the developing world: a scoping review\n\n1Faisal Ismai, 1Khairulnissa Ajani, 2Pammla Petrucka\n\n1Aga Khan University Hospital, 2University of Saskatchewan\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O4\n\nIntroduction\n\nSimulation is increasingly being adopted by healthcare educators throughout the developed world to train clinical skills. While there is literature on learning via simulation in healthcare in the developed world, more studies are required to investigate the factors influencing this in developing countries. As simulation in healthcare education is resource intensive, a detailed analysis of the barriers and facilitators is imperative to inform how low to middle-income countries (LMIC) can implement sustainable simulation-enabled learning environments.\n\nMethods\n\nWe conducted a scoping review to determine the key factors that act as deterrents as well as encouragement to the uptake of simulation as a teaching methodology in healthcare education in developing countries. The MEDLINE (using keywords and MeSH in OVID), PubMed (via NCBI using MeSH), and CINAHL databases were searched between January 2000 and December 2021 for research articles published in peer-reviewed English language journals. The final analysis yielded 47 articles. Challenges and opportunities were divided into professional, academic, and resource-based factors and their individual sub-themes.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nThe main challenges reported were the lack of a contextual curriculum, content-heavy curricula, dearth of trained simulationists and cost of simulators. Performance anxiety was an important challenge reported by both trainers and trainees, due to lack of familiarity not only with the teaching methodology but also the simulators. Main opportunities were an interest in adopting simulation-based education from both trainers and trainees, and the opportunity to improve patient safety and quality of education imparted. Other important findings were that academic leadership need to show interest and urgency to adopt simulation in curricula. Facilitators need to be developed and be provided with protected time to become simulationists. Local manufacturers need to be sourced for simulators, and transfer of technology and expertise needs to be negotiated with vendors. Simulation needs to be looked at from the lens of not only education, but more importantly, of patient safety in LMIC.\n\nOur study utilized a robust scoping review process to highlight key areas of priority influencing the uptake of simulation in healthcare education. The fact that the conventional curriculum utilizing the traditional method of teaching and training remains in place in LMIC`s suggests that healthcare educators have yet to realize the full potential of simulation-based education. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the factors that influence the uptake of simulation in healthcare education that can aid developing contexts to transition into simulation-enabled environments.\n\nKeywords\n\nHealthcare, Simulation, challenges, opportunities, developing, scoping\n\nReferences\n\nAebersold M.

Comparison Of Hands On ORSIM Simulator Training Versus High Fidelity Mannequin Training Of Novice Anaesthesiology Residents For Fiberoptic Intubation Proficiency And Retention Ability: A Randomised Controlled Trial\n\nNivedha Giridharan\n\nAll India Institute Of Medical Sciences\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O5\n\nIntroduction\n\nFiberoptic bronchoscopy-guided intubation is crucial in managing difficult airways during anesthesia, enhancing safety and minimizing complications. However, limited training opportunities constrain anesthesiology residents' proficiency in FOB skills.\n\nThe primary aim is to compare intubation proficiency in normal airways using ORSIM Fiber Optic simulation and high-fidelity mannequin training, assessed by time to reach the carina. Secondary objectives included evaluating proficiency via the Global Rating Scale (GRS), assessing retention capacity and skills decay after 6 months, and measuring self-assessed confidence levels post-training.\n\nMethods\n\nThis prospective randomised controlled study, conducted at AIIMS, New Delhi, involved 50 anaesthesia junior residents with over six months of training. They were randomly divided into two groups: the virtual reality simulator group (Group O, n=25) and the high-fidelity mannequin simulation group (Group H, n=25). Initial training encompassed airway anatomy and principles of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope usage. Group O was trained on the ORSIM bronchoscopy simulator, while Group H used the AmbuScope on a high-fidelity mannequin. The primary measure of proficiency was the time taken to reach the carina during intubation, secondary assessments included assessing GRS for manipulation abilities. Retention capacity was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months post-training. Participant confidence was assessed using Likert scores.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nTime taken to reach the carina did not significantly differ between Group O and Group H immediately post-training (85.04 ± 29.72sec vs. 74.64 ± 53.03sec, p = 0.39). After 6 months, a significant difference emerged (58.34 ± 18.23sec vs. 43.70 ± 12.87sec, p = 0.001).GRS showed no significant difference between Group O and Group H immediately post-training (2.28 ± 0.61 vs. 2.28 ± 0.73, p = 1.00). Self-assessment scores immediately after the training session revealed a statistically significant difference between Group O and Group H with scores of (1.92 ± 0.27) and (2.56 ± 0.58) respectively (p = 0.01). Post 6 months of training, there was a significant difference in GRS between Group O and Group H (4.52 ± 0.50) vs (4.16 ± 0.37) respectively (p = 0.006). The study compared virtual reality (VR) and high-fidelity mannequin simulation for fiberoptic bronchoscopic-guided intubation training. Initially, no significant difference was observed in intubation time. However, after 6 months, participants in the VR group took longer to reach the carina, highlighting potential differences in skill retention. Global Rating Score (GRS) showed no significant variance, implying similar technical proficiency. Notably, participants in the VR group reported higher initial confidence, emphasising the psychological impact of the training modality. In conclusion, the study underscores the importance of long-term skill retention assessment and suggests a blended training approach for optimal outcomes.\n\nKeywords\n\nFiberoptic bronchoscopy\n\nReferences\n\nJiang B, Ju H, Zhao Y, Yao L, Feng Y.

Comparison of laryngeal mask airway and endotracheal tube use in inhospital cardiopulmonary arrest due to cardiac reasons: Pediatric simulation-based randomized study\n\nAhmet Kagan Özkaya\n\nKaradeniz Technical University\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O6\n\nIntroduction\n\nLaryngeal mask airway (LMA) can be used safely in infants and children, however, there are a limited number of studies comparing LMA and endotracheal intubation in the resuscitation of pediatric patients that can provide safe recommendations. The aim of this study is to reveal the effects of the use of LMA on the resuscitation process and whether it shortens the effective ventilation and defibrillation time compared to the endotracheal tube in pediatric simulated inhospital cardiopulmonary arrest due to cardiac cause.\n\nMethods\n\nThis study was designed as crossover randomized. Before the study, all participants received a full day of training on advanced child life support, including theorical and practical training. All participants completed two separate scenarios involving two different drug intoxications involving a high-fidelity pediatric simulation mannequin. The scenarios were essentially cases of cardiopulmonary arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, with the same management. At the end of one scenario, the next scenario was started without a break, and a debriefing session was held with the participant at the end of the scenarios. In one scenario, the participant used an endotracheal tube as an advanced airway device, and in the other, the LMA. Demographic, educational and medical experience characteristics of the participants their were recorded. During the simulation, the entire performances were recorded with video and audio recordings. Outcomes of the study are also were determined. A mini survey was administered to all participants, questioning their training status and experiences before the simulation, as well as revealing their anxieties before and after the simulation scenarios. In line with previous studies, sample size was calculated that at least 16 participants would take part in this study for alpha=0.05 and (1-beta)=0.80.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nThe study was conducted with 17 participants. The average age of the participants was 30.2±2.7 years and 8 (47.1%) were male and 9 (52.9%) were female. While the effective ventilation time using the endotracheal tube was 73.88±51.68 seconds, it was 38.29±35.21 seconds with LMA (p=0.001). Additionally, when the time until defibrillation was compared between the endotracheal tube and LMA groups, a statistically significant difference was observed between them (81.47±43.28 seconds; 48.70±35.88 seconds, respectively; p=0.04). Table 1 includes comparisons of study outcomes. In conclusion, the use of LMA may allow faster effective ventilation and early defibrillation compared to an endotracheal tube in simulated pediatric arrests. Therefore, the use of LMA may be a promising approach in cardiopulmonary pediatric arrests due to cardiac causes.\n\nKeywords\n\nendotracheal tube, laryngeal mask airway, pediatric arrest, simulation\n\nReferences\n\nKhalil PA, Berkovich J, Maniaci V, Lozano JM, Lowe DA.

Crossing boundaries in the chain of child safeguarding- interprofessional simulation using design-based research\n\nMichelle O'Toole, Walter Eppich, Clare Sullivan, Naoise Collins, Claire Mullhall, Dani Hall, Aideen Walsh, Michelle Whelan, Andrea Doyle\n\nRCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O7\n\nIntroduction\n\nWorldwide, over 1 billion children/year experience violence and abuse, causing long-term emotional, social, and economic consequences, including over 40,000 deaths/year. Even after children at-risk for abuse are identified, the system meant to protect them fails them, mostly due to communication breakdowns between professionals, including those from health/social care as well as first responders. This problem impacts health professionals in emergency departments (ED) who commonly evaluate non-accidental injuries and non-specific signs and symptoms of child abuse and must make appropriate referrals to ensure ongoing evaluation of legitimate concerns to prevent further harm and death.\n\nThis study explores learning across professional boundaries between doctors, nurses and social workers to explore their own and others’ roles and valuable contributions to child safeguarding in emergency department settings to promote interprofessional and cross-disciplinary teamwork and communication.\n\nThe course had two aims: (a) to prepare emergency professionals to contribute to the care of abused children through effective interprofessional teamwork and collaboration, and (b) to advance the science of child safeguarding education by using DBR\n\nMethods\n\nUsing sociocultural learning theory and design-based research, we designed, implemented, and evaluated three iterations of a 1.5-day simulation-based interprofessional child safeguarding course. Key stakeholders co-designed the course and served as co-faculty. We collected:\n\nethnographic observations; semi-structured interviews (participants, faculty and simulated parents); quantitative questionnaires (psychological safety and interprofessional collaboration).\n\nWe used reflexive/theoretical thematic analysis to analyse qualitative data from interviews supplemented by and also guided by field observations.\n\nAfter each iteration of the course, we analysed and synthesized quantitative and qualitative data to make informed decisions about course modification. Given the low sample size, our rich qualitative data predominantly guided design choices.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\n32 participants completed the course. Key themes included:\n\nInterprofessional collaboration enabled learning about respective roles and responsibilities;\n\nPsychological safety promoted boundary crossing;\n\nUse of precise language and approaches to interprofessional communication fostered learning;\n\nTransfer of learnings to the workplace required expansive thinking, strategic silence, and better questions. Using DBR, we demonstrated the importance of interprofessional training in child safeguarding and the benefits of bringing together physicians, nurses and social workers to enhance collaboration and effective information sharing. This innovative course has broad applicability to all professionals working with children; frontline/emergency services, legal professionals and teachers.\n\nKeywords\n\ninterprofessional simulation; nursing; social work; emergency medicine\n\nReferences\n\nAinsworth, F., & Hansen, P.

Current state of Peruvian simulation centers: ASPEFAM national survey results\n\nVictor Andrés Velásquez Rimachi, Alvaro Prialé Zevallos, Solange Dubreuil Wakeham, Daniela Samaniego Lara\n\nUniversidad Científica del Sur1\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O8\n\nIntroduction\n\nLatin American medical curricula have increasingly integrated simulation-based education (1). In Peru, however, its adoption varies. While some institutions have fully embraced it, its broader influence remains limited. To address this, the \"Peruvian Association of Medical Faculties\" (ASPEFAM) set up a clinical simulation center network in 2017 (2). This initiative seeks to elevate health professional training through simulation. Our study examines the status of these centers in Peru, focusing on resources, teaching approaches, and ongoing medical education. We delve into directors' views on their centers strengths and priorities.\n\nMethods\n\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey using a digital questionnaire in Spanish, aimed at the 34 directors of\n\nASPEFAM-affiliated Peruvian simulation centers. Expert simulation professionals curated the survey content, rooted in established parameters for detailing simulation resources and operations.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nOut of 34 faculties, 33 responded, encompassing 17 private and 16 public institutions. 51% have practiced simulation for over five years, with 95% having designated simulation spaces. Every institution integrates simulation in undergraduate studies; 19% extend it to postgraduate courses. Thirty-two faculties conduct a face-to-face simulation, with 14 using standardized patient simulation. Eleven faculties use distinct applications of virtual patient software and augmented reality to practice virtual simulation. Ten faculties use hybrid simulation, and seven faculties use telesimulation.\n\nRegarding health careers utilizing simulation, medicine is predominant in 32 faculties, trailed by nursing in 15. Only 26% of faculties have >5 full-time teaching staff. Evaluation techniques vary; ECOE is the primary method for 18 faculties. 72% reported that only between 1-25% of their staff have received prior training in simulation. The most common types of simulators used are task trainers and low-fidelity full-body simulators. Task trainers and basic full-body simulators are the most used tools. Directors frequently cited strengths in “equipment”, “infrastructure”, and “skill simulation”. However, the most significant need identified was teacher training, highlighted by 25 faculties.\n\nIn summary, Peru's simulation centers offer diverse simulation activities, predominantly for undergrad medical students.\n\nTheir potential is somewhat limited by insufficient staff training that doesn't meet Peru's educational requirements (3). The prevailing need for continuous training could be addressed by fostering national and international collaborative networks. We must continue with the accreditation processes in Peru with objective monitoring of compliance with quality standards.\n\nKeywords\n\nSimulation Training; Developing Countries; Perú\n\nReferences\n\nArmijo-Rivera S, Machuca-Contreras F, Raul N, de Oliveira SN, Mendoza IB, Miyasato HS, Díaz-Guio DA.\n\nCharacterization of simulation centers and programs in Latin America according to the ASPIRE and SSH quality criteria.

Defragmented debriefing Methodology for Enhancing Online Simulation Training in Medical Education\n\nNatalia Lopina\n\nDirector of the Simulation Training Platform for Medical Education “ClinCaseQuest”\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O9\n\nIntroduction\n\nMedical education has witnessed a paradigm shift towards online learning, necessitating innovative approaches to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice. This abstract presents an innovative staged debriefing methodology designed to enhance the efficacy of online simulation training in medical education. The primary aim of this methodology is to simulate real clinical decision-making processes within an online environment, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and clinical competence among medical learners.\n\nDescription\n\nThe staged debriefing methodology integrates seamlessly with online simulation scenarios, helping to create an adaptive learning strategy.\n\nWe developed the methodology for staged debriefing which means demonstration of the consequences of the decisions made, emotional involvement, reasoning, explanations, and feedback inside the training scenario. Our approach is based on two strategies of staged debriefing according to the patient’s care or the patient’s way in particular nosology. The methodology of staged debriefing encourages learners to critically analyze their choices and the consequences therein. This method effectively emulates real-time clinical decision-making by recreating scenarios with escalating challenges.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nPreliminary implementation of the staged debriefing methodology demonstrates promising outcomes. Learners reported heightened engagement and an improved understanding of the clinical reasoning process. The adaptive nature of the methodology allowed learners to delve into varying complexities based on their proficiency, fostering a personalized learning experience. Initial assessment also revealed a positive impact on learners' confidence and decision-making skills, crucial for effective clinical practice. The innovative staged debriefing methodology represents a significant advancement in online simulation training for medical education. By simulating real clinical decision-making processes, it bridges the gap between theoretical learning and practical application. This methodology offers educators a powerful tool to cultivate critical thinking, clinical competence, and problem-solving skills in medical learners. As medical education continues to evolve, the staged debriefing methodology stands as a pivotal approach to enhance online simulation training, ultimately contributing to the development of proficient and confident healthcare professionals.\n\nKeywords\n\ndefragmented debriefing, simulation-based education, simultaneous debriefing, online clinical simulation, in-simulation debriefing, competency formation, medical errors, competency-based learning, clinical simulation, clinical case learning, problem-based learning, simulation-based learning, scenario-based learning, clinical reasoning, clinical thinking, decision-making, adaptive learning; internal medicine; emergency care cardiology; neurology; haematology.\n\nReference\n\nLopina N. “Staged Debriefing in Simulation Training in Medical Education for Competencies Formation” / 28th Annual conference Society for Simulation in Europe SESAM 2023/ Lisbon, Portugal, 14-16 June 2023\n\nO10. Domestic Violence simulation for Scottish General Practice Teams\n\nTiffany Keep, Sarah Luty\n\nNHS Education for Scotland Medical Education Fellow,\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O10\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhilst a criminal offence in the UK, cases of domestic violence continue to rise (1, 2) and patients experiencing domestic violence present to their GP. Previous work by the authors showed lack of preparedness in GP trainees and the value of simulation based learning to improve skills in managing presentations of domestic violence.\n\nThis study aimed to develop and evaluate a simulation programme to help GP teams- reception staff, healthcare support workers, managers, nurses and General practitioners recognise and manage cases involving domestic violence.\n\nDescription\n\nIn situ simulation scenarios were designed around three core domestic violence presentations, using specialist actors to enable the scenarios. Three scenarios included one participant, with one scenario as a group case. Simulations lasted 10-15 minutes, and were followed by a debriefing by an experienced GP facilitator.\n\nScenario 1 was based on coercive and control; where a partner is witnessed by reception staff exhibiting behaviours that intimidate, manipulate and threaten the patient before her scheduled appointment.\n\nScenario 2 was physical violence with bruising noted by the healthcare support worker or receptionist during a routine blood pressure check for the contraceptive pill.\n\nScenario 3 was based on a potential grooming, where staff are given information about young adolescent girls in vulnerable situations.\n\nWritten feedback was collected from participants to drive improvement of the simulation experience.\n\nThe intended learning outcomes were based on the Scottish adult support and protection framework for all health and social care staff in Scotland.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nThe initial pilot was successful with the practice feedback strongly agreed that the session will help their future care of vulnerable groups. Free text comments included “interesting and realistic scenarios” and safe learning environment for challenging topic” Increased preparedness of what to say “in the now” .GP teams valued the opportunity to learn together and share experience.\n\nThe main learning points were 1. highlighting role of reception and administrative staff in observing behaviours not witnessed by clinical staff. 2. Increased awareness of duty to report concerns . 3. lack of pathways and protocols for information sharing between practice team members. 4. lack of recording and coding of domestic violence or vulnerable adults.\n\nFurther pilot practices have been recruited, but barriers to scaling up have been encountered with difficulty in accessing protected time within general practice, lack of perceived value of including wider team in simulation based learning events, and a lack of awareness of legislative framework for protection of vulnerable adults.\n\nKeywords\n\nPrimary care, vulnerable groups\n\nReferences\n\nStatistics OfN.

Evaluation of cardiac and muscular parameters during chest compressions: an international multicentric pseudo-randomised manikin trial\n\nIngrid Bispo1, Abel Nicolau1, Marc Lazarovici2, Christoffer Ericsson3, Max Gottstein2, Frieder Pankratz2, Pedro Vieira-Marques1, Carla Sá-Couto1\n\n1Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto (FMUP), LMU Universiry Hospital2, University of Helsinki, Faculty of Medicine3\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O11\n\nIntroduction\n\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) demands a moderate physical effort from the rescuer and induces physiological and muscular body adaptations. Previous studies [1-3] showed that heart rate variability and muscle fatigue are related to a decrease in CPR quality, and this varies regarding the rescuer’s position. The aim of this study is to evaluate the real-time changes in cardiac and muscular parameters during chest compressions (CC) in 4 different rescuer’s position and to examine whether they differ among the groups.\n\nMethods\n\nThis international multicentric pseudo-randomised manikin study was conducted in Portugal, Finland and Germany, between May and October 2023. Healthcare professionals experienced in CPR aged between 18 and 65 years old were recruited by convenience sampling to perform uninterrupted 3 minutes of chest compressions in a manikin (Laerdal Resusci Anne QCPR). Subjects reporting back pain and pregnant women were excluded. Participants were pseudo-randomized into 4 different group settings: (1) manikin laying on the ground and rescuer with knees on the floor; (2) manikin laying on a lowered bed and rescuer with no step stool; (3) manikin laying on a bed and rescuer with step stool; and (4) manikin laying on a bed and rescuer with knees on the bed. In standing positions, the height of the bed was adjusted to the participant’s knees. No mattress was used to prevent CC damping. Sociodemographic data were collected using a questionnaire. Electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes were used to measure real-time heart rate (HR) and the intervals between RR peaks (RRi), electromyogram (EMG) electrodes were placed in both triceps brachii to collect the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and the root mean square (RMS) from the muscle action potentials.\n\nApproval from the ethical committee was obtained prior to the study.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nSixty-two subjects were included with different backgrounds (nurses, medical doctors and paramedics). Mean age was 35 years old (± 8,6) and mean BMI was 25 Kg/m2 (± 4,5). Most of participants were female (53,2%). Figure 1 shows the changes in cardiac and muscular parameters. Heart rate increased during the CPR, and RRi declined proportionally.\n\nMVC and RMS showed minimal variability over time. No significant differences were found in any variable among the 4 groups. Conclusion: This study shows that changes in cardiac and muscular parameters during CPR are similar among different rescuer’s position. Additional tests, examining the correlation between CPR quality measures and rescuer fatigue, while considering factors such as gender, profession, and country, are currently in progress.\n\nKeywords\n\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation; chest compressions; muscular contraction; muscular fatigue, heart rate variability.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by national funds of the FCT – Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, I.P., under the project “QualityCPR, ref. 2022.03731.PTDC”, and by a grant from the Laerdal Foundation (ref. 2022-0083).\n\nReferences\n\nRiera SQ, González BS, Álvarez JT, Fernández MF and Saura JM.

The position of the rescuer and the victim’s placement influences the quality of compressions[2]. The rescuer needs to assume a specific position based on the victim’s placement, which can impair the needed strength to achieve the recommended compressions depth or result in excessive pressure hindering full chest recoil. The aim of this study is to explore the influence of different positions of the rescuer in CPR quality, over time.\n\nMethods\n\nThis international multicentric pseudo-randomised manikin trial was carried-out between May and October 2023, in Portugal, Germany and Finland. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling and pseudo-randomized into 4 independent groups, based on a specific setting: (1) manikin laying on the ground and rescuer with knees on the floor; (2) manikin laying on a lowered bed and rescuer standing on the floor; (3) manikin laying on a lifted bed and rescuer standing on a step stool; and (4) manikin laying on a bed and rescuer with knees on the bed. The height of the bed was adjusted to the selected setting, aligning it with the rescuer’s knee level. No mattress was used. Each participant performed 3 minutes of uninterrupted chest compressions in a manikin (Laerdal Resusci Anne QCPR). Demographic details were collected using a questionnaire. The inclusion criteria were healthcare professionals, aged between 18 and 65 years old, self-reporting good general health and physical condition, and experience in CPR. Pregnant women and participants reporting fatigue/muscle pain were excluded. Approval from the ethical committee was obtained prior to the study.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nFifty-one healthcare professionals, including medical doctors, nurses and paramedics, participated in this study. Their mean age was 34.08±8.39 years, with 24 of them being female. Figure 1 presents the variation of CPR parameters (depth, recoil, frequency and overall score) over time, in different positions. No statistically significant difference was found between groups. Overall, most of the participants adhered to the current guidelines, demonstrating adequate performance in all CPR parameters, regardless of position. The compression depth mean shows a consistent decrease in all groups, with a concomitant increase in the standard deviation, indicating a greater performance variation over time. This study suggests that performance is not influenced by the position of the rescuer. Further analysis of the results, considering gender, profession, and country, is currently being undertaken.\n\nKeywords\n\nemergency medicine, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, quality, chest compressions\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by national funds of the FCT – Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, I.P., under the project “QualityCPR, ref. 2022.03731.PTDC”, and by a grant from the Laerdal Foundation (ref. 2022-0083).\n\nReferences\n\nOlasveengen, T.

Human factor skills - From Simulation-based training to competency in clinical practice\n\nLotte Abildgren\n\nOdense University Hospital, Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; Hospital Sønderjylland\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O15\n\nIntroduction\n\nSimulation-based training has become increasingly prevalent as a tool to augment pregraduate healthcare students' knowledge and human factor skills. While its efficacy in imparting technical skills to established qualified healthcare personnel is acknowledged, there remains a gap in understanding transfer of the learned human factor skills to competency in clinical practice. This study aimed to shed light on how qualified in-hospital healthcare personnel integrate skills from simulation-based training into their clinical roles.\n\nMethods\n\nThe study used a qualitative, phenomenological-hermeneutical approach to explore transfer of newly learned human factor skills. The study spanned three phases of ethnographic examination: clinical, simulation-based training, and transfer. Each phase was built upon insights from incipient analysis of the prior phase to understand the transfer process. The research utilised a comprehensive dataset of roughly 107 hours of video recordings, field notes, and in-depth reflective dialogues among the research team. The data analysis was conducted by a hybrid method of two qualitative methodologies: Ricœur-Inspired Analysis and Cognitive Event Analysis.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nThe research emerged three central themes regarding transfer of human factor skills:\n\nIndividual Transfer of Learning Intercollegiate Transfer of Learning\n\nOrganisational Transfer of Learning.\n\nWhile individuals and intercollegiate groups displayed varying degrees of skill transfer, a foundational finding was the indispensable role of organisational structures. Transferring human factor skills from learning to clinical competency requires an organisational framework to scaffold the process. The study identified a notable gap in this area: the absence of organisational emphasis on human factor skills transfer resulted in a lack of motivation and effort to transfer the newly acquired skills into competency.\n\nThe findings provide a more profound comprehension of qualified healthcare personnel's hurdles in transferring human factor skills from a simulated environment to clinical contexts. The research emphasises the essential importance of organisations in this process. For the potential of simulation-based training to be realised fully, healthcare institutions need to recognise the weight of human factor skills, emphasise a team-based approach to the transfer process, and provide the necessary infrastructural support. This will facilitate a seamless transfer of skills and support patient care's quality and safety standards.\n\nKeywords\n\nHuman factor skills; transfer; ethnography; qualified healthcare personnel; competency\n\nReferences\n\nAbildgren L, Lebahn-Hadidi M, Mogensen CB, Toft P, Nielsen AB, Frandsen TF, et al.

Implementing a psychiatry simulation course in rural Scotland\n\nNeera Gajree, Kenneth Ruddock\n\nNHS Lanarkshire\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O16\n\nIntroduction\n\nNearly one million people live in rural areas in Scotland (1). With vulnerability to loneliness, poor accessibility to high quality support and stigma acting as a barrier to seeking care in close knit communities, mental health is a recurring issue in rural Scotland. It has also been noted that many healthcare professionals in remote areas do not have mental health training (2).\n\nSince 2009, NHS Education for Scotland has operated the Mobile Skills Unit (MSU), a training unit which brings state-of-the-art immersive simulation facilities to rural Scotland (3). In order to support staff working rurally, we utilised the MSU to deliver a psychiatric simulation course in Stornoway, Isle of Lewis.\n\nDescription\n\nA high fidelity mental health simulation course was run for a group of medical students and junior doctors. The course comprised three 15 minute scenarios (a depressed patient, an agitated patient and a distressed relative), followed by a 30-minute debriefing session co-facilitated by 2 experienced psychiatrists. Feedback was collected via anonymous pre and post course questionnaires completed at the time of the course.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nThere were 6 participants on the course (3 medical students and 3 junior doctors). When asked about challenges encountered with patients suffering from mental illness in rural areas, participants noted difficulty transferring patients off the island, limited on-site support and the popularity of the area as a destination for patients with mental health problems to travel to.\n\nThe majority of participants felt that the course increased their confidence in assessing patients with depression (67%), conducting a suicide risk assessment (83%) and managing agitated patients (83%). All participants noted that the course increased their confidence in using Mental Health Act legislation. Despite the differing levels of the participants, they were all in agreement that the course was appropriate for their learning needs and stage of training. Participants universally agreed that the course increased their preparedness to deal with similar scenarios in a rural healthcare setting.\n\nThis was the first time that the MSU has been utilised to deliver mental health simulation to medical students and doctors in rural Scotland, to our knowledge. Participants highlighted specific challenges associated with managing patients with mental illness in remote areas, and valued the opportunity provided by the course to improve their confidence in doing so. The results highlight the importance of improving access to mental health simulation in remote and rural areas.\n\nKeywords\n\nmental health, psychiatry, undergraduate, postgraduate, remote, rural\n\nReferences\n\nThe Scottish Government.

Introducing students to Interventional Radiology through simple Simulation of ultrasound-guided peripheral venous access\n\nMatthew Gallacher, Nicola Spence, Sarah Noble\n\nNHS Highland\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O17\n\nIntroduction\n\nInterventional Radiology (IR) is a fast-developing specialty which enables minimally invasive procedures with lower risks than open surgery. Awareness of IR among undergraduates is poor and the authors hope to redress this. Within NHS Highland, limited consultant cover often prevents medical students from attending IR theatre. As a result, a need was identified to give students a simulated introduction to IR in lieu of IR theatre experience. A workshop was therefore designed around ultrasound-guided peripheral venous access; a basic image-guided procedure useful for junior medics. It was delivered to penultimate-year medical students undertaking clinical attachments in Radiology at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.\n\nDescription\n\nThe session began with slides and video-clips demonstrating (i) the IR theatre environment, (ii) imaging modalities (ultrasound, fluoroscopy) and (iii) Seldinger technique. Ultrasound scanning (USS) technique for locating peripheral veins was then demonstrated on a student volunteer, using an USS machine. This comprised basic elements; sono-anatomy of the upper limb, image optimization and colour Doppler.[1] Students were then invited to use the machine to practise USS technique on one another.\n\nOnce students were comfortable with this, a simulation of ultrasound-guided cannulation was demonstrated using an Adam, Rouilly branched 4 vessel vascular access training block model (ABP098), a cannula and the USS machine. Both transverse and in-plane scanning techniques were demonstrated. Students were then invited to perform the same procedure(s) on the model and coached until successful.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nThis workshop has taken place four times as of September 2023. Student feedback was very positive; they found the session both interesting and useful, and particularly appreciated the opportunity to learn basic USS technique. Students reported that being able to image the intravascular part of the cannulation process (especially in-plane) aided their understanding of how to successfully site a peripheral venous cannula.\n\nThey also said they were more interested in IR following the session, many having never previously heard about the specialty.\n\nAs far as we are aware, this is the first time simulation techniques have been used to demonstrate an image-guided procedure within our undergraduate curriculum.[2] The session allowed students to interpret cross-sectional anatomy through ultrasound scanning, and to perform an image-guided procedure through simulated ultrasound-guided cannulation. This is an advanced procedure not conventionally taught until postgraduate level, but was made accessible to medical students through simulation, with positive results.\n\nKeywords\n\nInterventional Radiology, Radiology, Simulation, Model, Ultrasound, Ultrasound-Guided, Image-Guided, Imaging, Cannulation, Vascular Access, Undergraduate\n\nReferences\n\nGriksaitis MJ, Scott MP, Finn GM.

Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Support Automated Performance Assessment During Simulation-Based Training\n\nScott Pappada1. Cristina Alvarado1, Kristopher Brickman1, Shaza Aouthmany1\n\nUniversity of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O18\n\nIntroduction\n\nLearner proficiency during medical simulation (i.e., operational readiness) is commonly determined using subjective/observational tools such as checklists[1]. These tools tend to reflect measures which have limited detail and are binary in nature (e.g., task was or was not accomplished). Assessment of learners during simulation by an instructor is complicated as the instructor has multiple responsibilities including assessment, directing a scenario, and at times serving as a simulated participant. To this end, even key assessment points or criteria may vary significantly across instructors, be missed, delayed, or suboptimal. There is presently a lack of quantitative and objective performance measures in simulation/medical education. While personalization is crucial to simulation-based medical education effectiveness [2], it is not yet available due to lack of such measures.\n\nDescription\n\nTo address the current limitations in simulation/training, our team has developed a novel assessment platform (PREPARE) to collect subjective and objective data at the learner, instructor, and environmental levels during training activities [3]. Data collection capabilities include subjective instructor assessments, objective physiological markers related to performance from learners wearing wearable devices, and audio data collected from the simulation environment. We have established artificial intelligence (AI) within the platform in the form of speech-to-text (STT) and natural language processing (NLP) of audio data collected within the simulation environment [4]. This capability provides automated detection of interventions/actions/decisions completed during training which can be quantified objectively as timeliness of treatment interventions and clinical decisions. Automated performance assessment capabilities of the platform have currently been validated for stepwise and procedural scenarios such as those requiring advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). The established AI-based capability also provides an added benefit of time synchronizing delayed instructor assessments with physiological data collected from learners. We have observed a correlation between reduced performance and increased stress responses around instructor reported performance measures. The STT and NLP module has been designed such that it accommodates use in other languages outside of English which is important for international collaboration and distribution.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nPlatform testing has been completed within procedural tasks and efforts are ongoing to optimize performance during dynamic clinical scenarios. The platform is being leveraged to automate and improve assessment across our undergraduate medical student population during standardized patient encounters. As evaluations can vary significantly amongst different instructors, objective physiological and automated performance measures provide more standardized evaluation metrics. In future use, the platform can be used in real-world clinical settings to detect errors, adverse events, and automatically measure clinical performance.\n\nKeywords\n\nautomated performance assessment, artificial intelligence, advanced cardiac life support, simulation\n\nReferences\n\nHardy J-B, Gouin A, Damm C, Compère V, Veber B, Dureuil B.

Preparing Medical Students to Address Emerging Challenges of Future Wars through Simulation\n\nSherri Rudinsky, Rebekah Cole\n\nUniformed Services University\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O19\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, signaling an escalated threat of future large-scale wars. During these wars, both military and civilian physicians may be called to care for significant numbers of patients in large, complex, and violent environments. Medical students should therefore be prepared to practice medicine within challenging wartime environments as a part of their medical school curriculum so that they are ready, if needed, to care for patients wounded in war.\n\nSimulation has been found to play a key role in equipping medical students with clinical skills and abilities needed to care for patients during war. One example of such simulation, the Advanced Combat Medical Experience (ACME), is a 10-day course utilizing prehospital simulations conducted annually at the Uniformed Services University, the United State’s military medical school. ACME simulates a wartime environment, through outdoor high-fidelity prehospital trauma simulations, and introduces second-year military medical students to practicing their prehospital skills amidst the challenges and obstacles of war. No studies currently exist examining the benefits of prehospital simulation to prepare junior medical students for future wars. Our study, therefore, examined the experiences of second-year medical students during ACME and their personal and professional development while caring for patients during a simulated wartime environment.\n\nMethods\n\nWe used the phenomenological tradition of qualitative research to analyze the experiences of students who participated in ACME. To explore their experiences, our research team closely reviewed the post-simulation reflection papers written by 176 second-year medical students who attended ACME during summer 2021. We then coded each paper and came to a consensus on the themes and patterns within the data, which served as the results of our study. We bracketed our biases throughout the data analysis process in order to enhance the validity of our results.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nWe discovered four themes within the data illustrating the students’ experiences during ACME: 1) self-confidence, 2) teamwork, 3) stress management, and 4) professional identity formation. The students became more confident in their ability to practice medicine during an out of hospital wartime environment. While they were at first surprised by how hard it was to work as a team, the students learned to trust their teammates in order to overcome challenges. They also learned how to manage their stress by grounding themselves and relying on their teammates. Finally, after successfully completing ACME, the students were able to envision themselves as military physicians, affirmed in their career path. Based on these results, ACME may serve as a model for using simulation to prepare both military and civilian physicians to care for patients amidst the emerging challenges of wartime environments and contributes to better understanding the benefits of incorporating environmental fidelity in healthcare simulation.\n\nKeywords\n\nTrauma Simulation, War, professional identity formation, environmental fidelity\n\nReferences\n\nRudinsky SL, Weissbrod E, Cole R. “Not for the Faint of Heart”: First-year Military Medical Students’ Professional Identity Formation During the Innovative Patient Experience at Operation Bushmaster.

Simulation as part of a complex and entangled puzzle\n\nJane Hislop1, Tom Fawns2, Nathan Oliver3, Xinchi Zhang1, Susan Somerville4\n\n1University of Edinburgh, 2Monash University, 3University of Canberra, 4University of Dundee\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O20\n\nIntroduction\n\nSimulation-based education (SBE) is “massively on the rise, highly technological, but under-theorised” (p. 905) [1].\n\nDiscussions often focus on methods and technologies [2, 3] seeing SBE sessions as an adjunct to existing curricula [4]. Recent research highlights challenges of embedding simulation into a broader healthcare landscape [5] that may limit its effectiveness. . Our project seeks to understood how SBE fits alongside other learning (e.g. clinical teaching) and how it is affected by a combination of factors within a wider education ecosystem.\n\nOur ambitious study seeks to shed new light and fresh insights into the complex, sociomaterial landscape of simulation in healthcare environments. Focusing on simulation sessions across two Scottish medical schools, we are exploring how these sessions are situated in wider contexts, where diverse purposes and values are in play.\n\nMethods\n\nUsing an entangled simulation framework (figure 1), this focused ethnographic study [7] involved analysis of documents (including policies, curriculum specifications, lesson plans, and simulation artefacts), observation of simulation facilitators and participants from a backstage and front of house perspective, and unstructured interviews with stakeholders, facilitators, and trainees at simulation centres in Edinburgh and Dundee. The project was funded by the Scottish Medical Education Research Consortium and has ethical approval from the University of Edinburgh, Medical Education Research Ethics Committee.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nPreliminary results suggest that what happens in these simulation sessions is a combination of carefully planned, arbitrary, and emergent factors, that are contingent on competing priorities and a mix of strategic and ad hoc configurations of infrastructure. Facilitators use a blend of knowledgeable and ad hoc practices to negotiate this complexity into educational experiences that are relevant and meaningful, even if these are not exactly as described in design and policy documents. What happens within simulation is more loosely coupled with pre-specified outcomes than is suggested within simulation discourse and documentation, but this looser coupling allows for valuable, emergent and unanticipated experiences. The relevance of these experiences to other learning events is contingent on factors both within and beyond the simulation scenarios and debrief sessions.\n\nOur research is highlighting considerations beyond the design of simulation sessions that influence the activity that happens within sessions and the relevance of that activity to other learning events. Such considerations are important to curriculum planning in which simulation is seen as just one aspect of a medical trainee’s learning journey.\n\nKeywords\n\nN/A\n\nReferences\n\nJohnston JL, Kearney GP, Gormley GJ, Reid H.

Stepping Back for Safety – A simulation-based intervention for adaptive expertise\n\nMaria Louise Gamborg1, Kasper Glerup Lauridsen1, Cirkeline Hytte Pedersen1, Peter Dieckmann2, Kristian Brogaard Krogh3, Mads Lind Ingeman3, Yoon Frederiksen1, Maria Mylopoulos4\n\n1Aarhus University, 2University of Copenhagen, 3Aarhus University Hospital, 4University of Toronto\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O21\n\nIntroduction\n\nClinical decision-making (CDM) is a key competence for physicians that refers to the ability to identify, sort, and prioritize relevant information, with the aim of deciding on a specific diagnosis (1, 2). It is a process that involves a lot of human cognitive processing which is under pressure in the healthcare setting. Disruptions often occur in the clinical setting due to e.g. technical issues with the equipment, relatives demanding attention, or multiple sick patients causing attention (3, 4). Such disruptions increase the demand on cognitive processing and may affect CDM. Adaptive Expertise (AE) encompass cognitive strategies that promote flexible, creative and innovative use of knowledge, to solve novel and complex problems. Therefore, AE has been proposed as a highly relevant approach to CDM, as it prompts clinicians to take a step back to critically reflect on their knowledge (5, 6). Despite the potential to train these essential cognitive competencies exists, and could reduce risk for patient, no educational initiative targets the challenge of handling disruptions. Here, simulation-based education can serve as a unique mode of training. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of two different disruptions during medical emergencies.\n\nMethods\n\nWe designed an experimental study to qualitatively investigate the impact of four conditions: (1) environmental disruptions (faulty equipment), (2) psychological disruptions (treating two patients at once), (3) the combined disruptions, and (4) the simulation without disruptions (control). Participants are randomized to one condition, resulting in 5 participants in each. Directly after the training, participants take part in a semi-structured interview. All interviews are transcribed and analyzed through reflective thematic analysis, using the adaptive expert framework as a sensitizing concept.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nIn all, 20 post-graduate year 1 doctors will be recruited. Data collection is still ongoing, and all data will be collected and analyzed before SESAM 2024, where results will be presented. Preliminary results indicate that the psychological disruptions, either on their own or in combination with an environmental disruption, was experienced as highly unexpected and disruptive to their decision-making process. Particularly themes of entrusting others with acting out one’s decisions was identified as a difficult element to overcome. Preliminary reports from the included participants describe that the psychological disruption prompted more internal struggle, leading to creative and innovative use of knowledge. Final conclusions will be presented at the conference.\n\nKeywords\n\nClinical decision-making, Adaptive expertise, disruptions, emergency medicine\n\nReferences\n\nCroskerry P.

Student Survey Results from a Pan-Canadian Virtual Simulation Program\n\nMargaret Verkuyl1, Lynda Atack1, Efrem Violato2, Nicole Harder3, Theresa Southam4, Melanie Lavoie-Tremblay5, Sandra Goldsworthy6, Wendy Ellis7, Suzanne Campbell8\n\n1Centennial College, 2North Alberta Institute of Technology, 3Unversity of Manitoba, 4Selkirk College, 5University of Montreal, 6Mount Royal University, 7George Brown College, 8The University of British Columbia\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O22\n\nIntroduction\n\nA global shortage of healthcare providers has made it increasingly difficult for healthcare educators to secure quality clinical placements. The Virtu-WIL program, a pan-Canadian initiative, was designed for to develop, offer, and test over 100 work-integrated virtual simulations for healthcare students to alleviate this gap. Nursing, medical laboratory technologist and paramedicine students participated in the program.\n\nMethods\n\nA mixed-methods evaluation, guided by Kirkpatrick’s model, was conducted to explore students’ experiences with the virtual simulations and, importantly, to determine the impact of the simulations on their clinical practice. Students reported their experiences using a survey that included validated subscales and open-ended items. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Open-ended comments were analyzed for themes using a process described by Braun and Clarke (2006).\n\nResults & Discussion\n\n1715 students enrolled in the Virtu-WIL program from 18 post-secondary universities, colleges and institutions across Canada completed the survey. Satisfaction with the virtual simulations was high (86.2%). The mean score for the functionality and engagement subscale was 82/100 suggesting students found the virtual simulations easy to use and aesthetically and intrinsically appealing. Students reported that the simulations provided realistic, meaningful, immersive experiences which contributed to their learning and strongly contributed to students’ perceptions of readiness for practice. The virtual simulations provided an opportunity for students to see their professional roles in action and to take on that role. Students had the chance to think things through, make mistakes and learn from their mistakes in a safe environment.\n\nVirtual simulation has emerged as a learning modality that can help students develop key employability skills. The results of this pan-Canadian project, with students from three different healthcare programs found that the virtual simulations were engaging, helped students to learn and prepare for practice. A key finding was that it is not sufficient to simply add virtual simulations to the curriculum, careful alignment with course objectives and simulation pedagogy are essential. We anticipate that the findings from this large, multi-site evaluation will be of interest to educators from a range of programs who are interested in adopting virtual simulation in education. We will add that the virtual simulation experiences used in this project are freely available through creative commons licensing to the global health care community at https://simulationcanada.ca/virtu-wil/.\n\nKeywords\n\nvirtual simulation, program evaluation, Pan-Canadian, survey\n\nReference\n\nBraun, V., & Clarke, V.

Sustainable Novel 3D Alginate Models for Simulation-Based Medical Education in Pathology: A Validation Study\n\nEduardo Alcaraz-Mateos1, Candela Salmeron-Lopez2, Juan Francisco Minarro-Jimenez2, Angeles Abellan-Palazon1, Fuensanta Caballero-Aleman1, Nicolas Sanchez-Campoy3, Kamran M Mirza4, Xiaoyin Sara Jiang5\n\n1Morales Meseguer University Hospital, 2University of Murcia, 3INE - National Statistics Institute, 4Loyola University Medical Center, 5Duke University Hospital\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O23\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlternatives to formaldehyde-fixed and fresh specimens are a convenient solution for simulation-based pathology education for medical students, pathologist assistants and trainee pathologists (1). Alginate is economical, vegan, and biodegradable, providing a sustainable alternative to other materials such as gelatin and silicone. The aim of this study was to validate novel custom-made alginate-based 3D models for macroscopic examination or gross dissection training.\n\nMethods\n\nSpecimens were hand-built, scanned with the EinScan Pro 2X Plus, and modeled into 3D printed molds using SolidWorks software and the Stratasys F170 with ABS filament. Using these molds, polypectomy, thyroidectomy and skin resection specimens made of alginate were created. These models were replicated and distributed to pathology educators across the country. A 5-point Likert-style questionnaire through Google forms was supplied for face and content validity, considering aspects such as realism, consistency, color and size, ability to be inked, behavior to the section, to assess the utility of the models.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\n37 teachers (8% professors, 19% associate professors, and 73% assistant/adjunt professors) from different institutions (12 hospitals belonging to 9 universities in 7 cities) participated in this 3-week study.\n\nFace validity was demonstrated with overall average teachers' scores of 4.39 out of 5 (range 3-5, SD:0.72). Best results were for the skin resection (4.59), followed by thyroid (4.49) and polyp models (4.08). Content validity or educational value was also proved: all participants agreed that the models allowed effective teaching of pathologic anatomy (4.59), neoplastic pathology (4.27), grossing (4.81), surgical margin concepts (4.92), and hand-eye coordination (4.86). Professors' age was positively correlated with the utility perceived, so that the older the age of the faculty, the greater the utility considered of the models (p<0.05).\n\nThese new alginate-based models were shown to have face and content validity for the three common gross specimens tested, when evaluated by pathologist faculty educators from a variety of institutions and faculty ranks.\n\nInterestingly, the most experienced professors were the ones who perceived the most value to these models. The novel alginate-based models offer a sustainable alternative to existing materials for teaching macroscopic examination. These results demonstrate efficacy of these models for a standardized teaching in an interactive way, with skills acquisition among trainees.\n\nKeywords\n\nPathology; Dissection; Grossing; Macroscopic examination; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing\n\nReference\n\nThe utility of a gross dissection anatomical model for simulation-based learning in pathology.

Think GP: Utilising simulation to enhance General Practice teaching in undergraduate education\n\nRobyn Gatenby1, Joanna Traynor1, Sharon Donaghy1, Sarah Luty2\n\n1NHS Lanarkshire, 2NHS Education for Scotland\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O24\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is a crisis of General Practitioner (GP) recruitment, with GP numbers falling (1). To try to combat this, medical student places are being increased across the country, and the government have mandated that 50% of graduates pursue a career in general practice (2). Experience in undergraduate general practice is directly related to subsequent career choice (3,4). Therefore, there is a target for at least 25% of undergraduate clinical teaching to be in general practice (5). With reducing numbers of full time equivalent (FTE) GPs and ever-increasing workload, finding higher numbers of student placements is a challenge (6).\n\nAs a result, we piloted and evaluated a GP simulation course with forty third year undergraduates at University of Glasgow.\n\nOur aim was to increase students’ exposure to general practice, and allow them to understand the challenges and uniqueness, including the limitations of managing patients who present with acute illness.\n\nDescription\n\nWe utilised a course we had previously developed for doctors in their first year of GP training and adapted these scenarios to be suitable for undergraduate level. The scenarios varied in age, culture and medical specialty to highlight the breadth of general practice. Similar scenarios are used in other simulation courses the students experience in secondary care and highlighted the differences in environmental factors and how this influenced decision making.\n\nStudents were supported by faculty confederate e.g. practice nurse in the room.\n\nScenario 1 - middle aged diabetic patient with hypoglycaemia during Ramadan.\n\nScenario 2 - adult patient walk in with anaphylaxis.\n\nScenario 3 - 10 month old baby with meningitis.\n\nScenario 4 - depressed patient with suicidal thoughts.\n\nWe utilised pre and post course questionnaires to assess how this course impacted on various areas.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nThe feedback was positive, with confidence scores increasing between pre- and post-course evaluation in all twelve domains, including technical and non-technical skills. On asking students if they would consider general practice as a career, one out of eleven who had said they would not, changed their mind and said they would now consider being a GP. Qualitative data was very positive. The data shows that students had a positive experience with improved confidence in consulting in the general practice setting, and that it may encourage students to consider a career in general practice who were not previously considering this. This may be able to be extrapolated to other university medical students across the country.\n\nKeywords\n\nGeneral Practice, Undergraduate experience, Environmental factors\n\nReferences\n\nMarchand C, Peckham S.

Use of extended reality (XR) tools: an adjunct for undergraduate neuroanatomy education\n\nAnna Moore1, Brooke Nash1, Darcey Atkinson1, Rosalia Nash1, Sameera Hettipathirannahelag2, Jack Sheppard2, Latif Miah2, Clinton Mitchell2, Owen Crawford3\n\n1School of Medicine, 2Department of Neurosciences, 3Cardiff Learning & Teaching Academy\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O25\n\nIntroduction\n\nNeuroanatomical knowledge is vital when assessing patients with neurological conditions, yet poses educational challenges. Using Extended Reality (XR) [combining immersive reality (IR); augmented reality (AR); and virtual reality (VR)] for anatomy teaching is gaining popularity within medical education (1, 2). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of XR adjuncts along with near-peer neuroanatomy teaching of undergraduate medical students in enhancing student spatial ability (3).\n\nDescription\n\nIR (projection room displaying 3D-anatomical models), AR (overlaying AR structures onto a brain model) and VR (traversal and manipulation of 3D-neuroanatomical models via Oculus headset) were integrated into small-group sessions (Figure-1) delivered to 29 fourth-year medical students (Mean age= 22.3 years; M:F ratio=1: 2.9) by near-peers (fifth-year medical students).\n\nA service evaluation was performed using anonymised pre- and post-session feedback. A five-point Likert scale [very unconfident(score=1) to very confident(score=5)] determined change in student confidence with neuroanatomy. Pre- and post-session single-best-answer questions (SBAs), consisting of 6 image-based questions (IBQs) assessing neuroanatomical spatial ability and 6 text-based questions (TBQs) assessing neuroanatomical factual recall, were used to objectively evaluate knowledge. Change in student performance in IBQs versus TBQs pre- and post-session was determined. Statistical significance was calculated using Wilcoxon ranking and Mann-Whitney U tests. Data collection ongoing.\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nMost students (63%, n=29) found combining XR modalities of maximum benefit. 72% (n=29) deemed the near-peer session more useful and felt more comfortable asking questions compared to clinician-delivered sessions. Post-session, students were more confident in identifying neuroanatomical structures [Pre-session median=3.00 (Interquartile range (IQR)=3.00-1.00) vs Post-session median=4.00 (IQR =4.00-1.00), p<0.001] and recalling neuroanatomical facts [Pre-session median=2.00 (IQR=2.00-1.00) vs Post-session median=4.00 (IQR=2.00-0.00), p<0.001]. Performance in neuroanatomy SBAs significantly improved for IBQs [Pre-session mean=2.411.15 standard deviation (SD) vs Post-session mean=3.801.15 SD, p<0.001] and TBQs [Pre-session mean=3.241.15 SD vs Post-session mean=4.071.19 SD, p=0.001].\n\nPre-session, students performed better in TBQs than IBQs (Mean TBQ score=3.241.15 SD vs Mean IBQ\n\nscore=2.411.15, p=0.009), but there was no significant difference post-session (Mean TBQ score=4.071.19 SD vs Mean IBQ score=3.801.15, p=0.197).\n\nThis suggests that our XR session particularly addressed deficits within visuospatial applications of neuroanatomical knowledge. The closure of this gap by XR teaching may have significant implications for the provision and modality of medical education in specialties with a propensity for visuospatial problems, such as surgery, pathology and radiology.\n\nKeywords\n\nClinical Neuroscience; Extended reality; Integrated reality; Augmented reality; Undergraduate; Medical Education; Near-Peer; Neuroanatomy; Neurosurgery; Neurology; Neuroradiology\n\nReferences\n\nScantling-Birch Y, Naveed H, Tollemache N, Gounder P, Rajak S.

Using Virtual Simulations to Promote Global Health Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion\n\nMarian Luctkar-Flude1, Jane Tyerman2\n\n1Queen's University, 2University of Ottawa\n\nAdvances in Simulation 2024, 9(1):O26\n\nIntroduction\n\nA major barrier to global health equity is resource limitations including lack of access to educational resources and health equity training.(1-3) There is a need for accessible resources for health professionals and students to learn and stay up to date with evidence-based clinical practices and guidelines. Additionally, persons who identify as racial, sexual or gender minorities experience health inequities due to discrimination. Thus, there is a need for education for health professionals and students about practicing with cultural humility, and a need to provide resources to underrepresented persons and allies to address microaggressions in clinical settings. There is also a global need for accessible and effective educational interventions for patients with chronic diseases to promote self-management. Virtual simulations are screen-based simulations that can be used to address these gaps. We aim to describe development and use of a series of virtual simulations for clinical education, equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) education, and patient self-management education to promote global health equity.\n\nDescription\n\nOver the past five years, a group of nurse educators from Canada collaborated on a series of online learning modules incorporating virtual simulations. We will share a cost-effective and user-friendly process for nurse educators to create virtual simulations that address educational needs of healthcare providers, learners, and patients. We will highlight virtual simulations we created about (i) addressing racism and microaggressions in clinical and classroom settings, (ii) providing culturally humble care to sexual and gender diverse individuals, (iii) wound care for persons with different skin tones, and (iv) patient self-management education in low-resource countries (Table 1). Our modules include presimulation preparation, debriefing strategies, and resources in alignment with the Healthcare Simulation Standards of Best Practice.(4)\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nOur project has demonstrated that virtual simulations are an effective educational strategy for health professionals, students, and patients. Virtual simulations are a novel and cost-effective method to create clinical, EDI, and patient self-management education content that can be shared globally.(5) Collaborations between simulation experts, content experts and persons with lived experience have contributed to the authenticity and value of eLearning modules. Our EDI virtual simulations are hosted open-access and many of these simulations have been accessed over 3 million times by users from around the world, providing evidence of the reach and impact of this project. Virtual simulations can be used to promote global health equity by increasing accessibility to evidence-based healthcare education and patient education in low-resource regions and institutions.\n\nKeywords\n\nhealthcare education; patient education; virtual simulations; health equity; equity, diversity and inclusion;\n\nReferences\n\nFrenk J, Chen LC, Chandran L, Groff EOH, King R, Meleis A, et al.
