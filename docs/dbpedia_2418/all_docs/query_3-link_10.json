M040Long Island SoundEcological ImpactCompetition Styela clava is frequently abundant and often the dominant fouling organism in harbors. It covered 18.5% of fouling plate surface in one-year old assemblages near Avery Point, CT (Altman and Whitlatch 2007).

AUS-VIIINoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change In experimental studies with various densities of Styela clava, fauna from Port Phillip Bay showed idiosyncratic responses to increased Styela density, with crustaceans, and tanaids, as a group decreasing, while the deposit-feeding bivalve Laternula rostrata increased. These changes appeared to be due to subtle changes in hydrodynamics, sediment quality, emigration or altered survival in Styela rather than community-wide effects (Ross et al. 2007). NEP-VIPt.

M040Long Island SoundEcological ImpactFood/Prey Newly settled Styela clava in Long Island Sound are prone to intense predation by the snails Astyris lunata (= Mitrella lunata) and Costoanachis translirata (= Anachis lafresnayi of authors) (Osman and Whitlatch 2000; Whitlatch and Osman 2009). Older juveniles are subject to predation by fishes, mostly Tautog (Tautoga onitis) and Cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus; Osman and Whitlatch 2000).

NEA-IINoneEcological ImpactCompetition Populations increased 'explosively' in the Eastern Scheldt, presumably displacing native species (Buizer 1980). In English waters, the population growth of S. clava was paralelled by a decrease in Ciona intestinalis (Lutzen 1999).

AUS-VIIINoneEcological ImpactCompetition Styela clava grows in very dense populations in Port Phillip Bay, apparently displacing other fouling organisms. Because of its high filtering rate, it was expected to compete for food with other suspension-feeding taxa (Currie et al. 1999). This was not seen in experiments conducted by Ross et al. (2007).
