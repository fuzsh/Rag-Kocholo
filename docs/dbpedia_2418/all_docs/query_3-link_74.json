        "meta_description": "Abstract Lightning is one of the most devastating hazards in Nepal because of a large amount of atmospheric water vapor coming from the Indian Ocean and a large orographic lifting of this moist air. In 2019, a total of 2884 people were affected, with loss of USD 110,982, and the fatality number was the highest (94) in reported lightning events since 1971. The long-term analysis of this hazard is very scanty in Nepal. Therefore, this study analyzes lightning fatality events, fatality rates, and economic loss from 1971 to 2019 collected from the DesInventar dataset and the Disaster Risk Reduction portal of the government of Nepal using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and geographic information system (ArcGIS) tools. The analysis shows that the overall countrywide lightning fatality rate of the entire period is 1.77 per million per year. District lightning fatality rates range from 0.10 to 4.83 per million people per year, and the Bhaktapur district has the highest fatality density (0.067). Furthermore, there were a total of 2501 lightning fatality events in which 1927 people lost their lives and 20 569 people were affected. The increase in lightning fatality events in recent years is due to internet penetration and other measures of information gathering that result in lightning fatality reports reaching agencies collecting information. The high and low concentrations of loss and damage are mainly due to geographic distribution, population density, and economic activities. This study recommends the establishment of lightning early warning systems in the Nepal Himalayas to save life and property.",

        "text": "a. Spatiotemporal distribution\n\nThe fatality rate and fatality density are plotted in Fig. 3. The overall fatality rate of the entire period is 1.77 per million per year (Table 1). The fatality rate varies from country to country; however, this rate is lower than most of the less developed countries. For example, Malawi has a fatality rate of 84 deaths per million people per year (Mulder et al. 2012), which is remarkably higher than other countries. The previous studies show that highly developed countries such as Austria (>0), the United Kingdom (>0), Australia (0.1), the United States (0.1), and France (0.2) have a low fatality rate compared to less developed countries such as Swaziland (15.5), Zimbabwe (14–21), South Africa (6.3), Mexico (2.7), India (2.0), and Colombia (1.8) (Holle 2016a). There are few examples because most countries do not have information on national statistics on lightning fatalities or published data in their national reports and scientific journals.\n\nThe districtwide lightning fatality rate ranges from 0.10 to 4.83 per million people per year (Fig. 3). The fatality rate is high in the Dolakha district (4.83) followed by Okhaldhunga (4.72), Ramechhap (4.69), Nuwakot (4.62), and Makwanpur (4.62). Similarly, the fatality rates are low in Baitadi (0.10), Dang (0.16), Kathmandu (0.24), and Surkhet (0.51) (Fig. 3). The fatality rate in Dolakha district ranks the highest where the population is relatively small (0.2 million). In contrast, the Makwanpur district has the largest number of deaths (94) but still ranks fifth in the population-weighted fatality rate. Moreover, the null hypothesis of equal means with national average is rejected for all the districts except Humla (significance P = 0.098), Manang (P = 0.053), Morang (P = 0.964), and Mustang (P = 0.669). This implies the statistically significant mean difference in fatality rate in all the districts except the above four districts. The highest fatality rate shift from higher- to lower-population regions also matches previous research from other countries (Dewan et al. 2017; Navarrete-Aldana et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2011).\n\nThe fatality density is highest in Bhaktpur district (0.067) followed by Nuwakot (0.056), Jhapa (0.051), Lalitpur (0.049), and Morang (0.047). The fatality density is lowest in Dolpa (0.0001), Bajhang (0.0003), Humla (0.0004), Darchula (0.0004), and Mustang (0.0008). The low number of fatality events and death in the midwestern and far-western region might be due to low population density (Central Bureau of Statistics 2011). The distribution of lightning fatality events is scattered across the country (Fig. 3); however, the fatality density is mostly concentrated in central and eastern Nepal. A high concentration of lightning fatality events exists in central Nepal (Makwanpur, Nuwakot, Sindhupalchowk, Kathmandu, and Dhading) followed by midwestern and far-western development regions. The rural mountainous districts such as Makawanpur (94), Morang (88), Jhapa (83), and Nuwakot (63) have the highest number of deaths compared to urban districts such as Kathmandu (12), Kaski (36), Kailali (21), and Chitwan (27). This finding is consistent with previous findings (Dewan et al. 2017; Gomes and Ab Kadir 2011; Holle 2016b) where higher number of fatalities in developing countries are located in the rural areas. The contributing factors include minimal or no lightning protection in public buildings and households, extensive labor-intensive agriculture, and lack of public awareness about lightning hazards and its protection (Gomes and Ab Kadir 2011; Holle 2016b; Holle and Cooper 2016; Raga et al. 2014).\n\nThe economic loss due to lightning varies from district to district. Some districts such as Dolakha, Sindhuli, Khotang, Dang, Kavre, and Kapilbastu have an economic loss greater than USD 20,000, whereas Mustang, Dadeldhura, and Manang do not report any loss. The lightning fatality events were widespread in Nepal. There were altogether 2501 fatality events (1971–2019), where 1927 people lost their lives and 20 569 people were affected (injured and lost properties) (Fig. 4a) (Table 1). The number of fatality events and deaths increased significantly after 1990 (Fig. 4b). This is related to the major change in the political system widely reported as the “end of an era” where 30 years of the autocratic “panchayat” system was eliminated, and multiparty democracy was established (Koirala 1991). This political reform provided opportunities for migration within the country, and the fatality data reporting system has been improved. The highest number of deaths (131) occurred in 2013, when 127 lightning fatality events were reported. The total economic loss during this period was USD 459,631, which has remarkably increased since 2013 (Fig. 4c).\n\nThe distribution of lightning fatality events, deaths, affected numbers, and economic loss varies in different ecological regions (Fig. 5). The fatality events, deaths, and affected population increased dramatically after 1990, showing an increasing trend (Fig. 5a). The number of fatality events and the death toll was higher in the hill region than in other regions. The highest number of deaths was found to be 18 (2013), 77 (2013), and 37 (2003) in mountain, hill, and Terai, respectively (Fig. 5b). High numbers of fatality events in the hill and Terai are frequent in the foothills of the Himalayas and are partially due to the conversion of copious amounts of moisture into rainfall (Kumar and Karma 2012). The total number of affected people was highest in 1997 (3005) in the Terai; however, the exact reason is still unknown (Fig. 5c).\n\nIn the past few decades, Nepal has made remarkable progress in information technology, and many people have been using mobile phones and the internet in all parts of the country. The analysis showed higher reported lightning fatality events in those districts where there is better availability of communication facilities, that is, phones and the internet (Fig. 6). For example, Morang, Jhapa, and Makanwanpur districts have both a high communication facility density and fatality density. Therefore, the huge increase in reported lightning fatalities in recent years could be due to internet penetration and other measures of information gathering that results in lightning fatality reports reaching the agencies collecting the information. This has been found to be the case in Bangladesh (Dewan et al. 2017), Turkey (Tilev-Tanriover et al. 2015), and Malawi (Kalindekafe et al. 2018). In addition, another reason might be the increasing population as a result of internal migration from existing urban areas to headquarters of rural and urban municipalities after the reclassification of rural and urban municipalities in 2015. Most of the concentrated settlements and district headquarters lie in the ridge of the mountain region of Nepal (Fig. 2).\n\nb. Lightning injury and damage prevention\n\nA lightning early warning system (LEWS) is a very important tool to save many lives and property in the mountainous region. There are mainly two components of LEWS, that is, a device detecting lightning and an application that uses the detection data system to provide a lightning early warning (Murphy et al. 2006). Moreover, two types of lightning, namely, “cloud to ground” and “in cloud,” are typically detected for early warning (Nag et al. 2015). The history of LEWS is not long in the context of Nepal. The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) of the government of Nepal has installed lightning detection network sensors in nine places: Tribhuvan International Airport, Tumglintar Airport, Biratnagar Airport, Simara Airport, Bhairahawa Airport, Pokhara Airport, Nepalgunj Airport, Surkhet Airport, and Attariya, Kailali district in 2018 (DHM 2019) (Fig. 7). This network collects lightning data, location, and time, which are very useful for the analysis of past events and future prediction. This network detects the direction of thunderstorms for one hour and is therefore useful for lightning forecasting. Similarly, DHM has been using a nowcasting technique with information from the weather radar station at Rata Nangala of Surkhet, the lightning detection network, one sounding station at Kirtipur, and 88 automated weather stations for forecasting from present situation up to 3–6 h. Moreover, numerical weather prediction models are being used for nowcasting supported by high-power computing facilities in the newly established advanced hydrometeorological work station on the premises of DHM (Department of Hydrology and Meteorology 2019). Currently, the GoN is installing two additional weather radars at Ribdikot of Palpa in the central region and Rametar of Udaypur in the eastern region of Nepal for better coverage (Fig. 7). The forecasting will be more accurate after the installation of these two radars, however, in situ power shortages, insufficient technically trained human resources for data processing, maintenance, data storage and interpretations are some key challenges in the present scenario.\n\nThese radar stations will provide accurate information about lightning events in the future; however, the GoN should construct lightning shelters in different parts of Nepal. The GoN has introduced a lightning protection code within the National Building Code 1994 (Ministry of Physical Planning and Works 1994), but this rule is provisional. Some government organizations such as the Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (NAST), Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA), and Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC) have installed LEWS (Pangeni 2015). The lightning protection consists of three basic parts: (i) air terminals or arrestors that divert the lightning from damaging the structure, (ii) down conductors that connect the air terminals to channel lightning energy to the ground, and (iii) ground terminal or electrodes that dissipate the lightning energy into the ground (Cooper and Holle 2019). However, the practice of this code is not effective in Nepal because most people are unaware of the code, and some people do not install lightning arrestors despite awareness because it is not mandatory. Hence, it is recommended that the GoN develop standard guidelines on lightning safety measures including a 30–30 rule for safety precautions guidelines for outdoors people. The 30–30 rule explains that an individual needs to start counting to 30 after seeing lightning, and if the sound of thunder is heard before counting to 30, then the individual should immediately go indoors and suspend activities for at least 30 min after the last clap of thunder.\n\nThe impact of lightning can result in lifelong injuries, and therefore public education on lightning safety is very important. However, there is no safe place outside in a thunderstorm. It is difficult to detect the “first strike” and to predict lightning strikes (NOAA 2016). However, people can save their lives if they go to a safe place at the first sign of a thunderstorm. This can be encouraged by introducing lightning safety activities in schools and public institutions. The integration of lightning safety education in school curricula will help children to understand lightning impact and safety measures. Moreover, activities in school also help to educate children’s parents and communities. The hoarding board (billboard)/community map with popular fictional or religious characters showing lightning events and safety procedures may help to create a public awareness. There should be public awareness about how to understand the weather forecast and what to do after the warning sign has been issued. This should be supported by a series to raise awareness on how to recognize a lightning hazard and actions to take even if there is no lightning early warning. The low-cost, easy to implement, stand-alone lightning protection systems for outdoor activities can be applied in regions with high lightning occurrence density (Gomes 2016)."
