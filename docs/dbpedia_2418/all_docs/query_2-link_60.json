PRL is a multifunctional hormone that affects multiple reproductive and metabolic functions and is also involved in tumorigenicity. In addition to being a classical pituitary hormone, PRL in humans is produced by many tissues throughout the body where it acts as a cytokine. The objective of this review is to compare and contrast multiple aspects of PRL, from structure to regulation, and from physiology to pathology in rats, mice, and humans.

Introduction\n\nSINCE ITS DISCOVERY in the 1930s as a distinct pituitary hormone that stimulates milk production in rabbits, prolactin (PRL) has attracted considerable attention among clinicians and basic scientists with diversified interests. Uniquely among the pituitary hormones, PRL has a propensity for hypersecretion and is under tonic inhibition. PRL also has more diverse biological functions than all other pituitary hormones combined. A close scrutiny of the PRL literature reveals that its spectrum of activities varies with the species studied. For example, whereas PRL is essential for the initiation of lactation in all mammals, its roles in other reproductive processes differ markedly from one species to another. The sources of PRL and the control of its production and release are also dissimilar. In addition to the pituitary, PRL in humans is produced by multiple tissues, where it is regulated in a cell-specific manner and acts as a cytokine. With few exceptions, PRL production in other animals is restricted to the pituitary, with PRL acting as a classical circulating hormone.\n\nThis review compares multiple aspects of PRL, from structure to physiology, in rats, mice, and humans. Most of our knowledge of PRL comes from studies with rats. This species with its impressive reproductive fecundity, short generation time, relatively large size, and low costs has served as the animal of choice for endocrinologists. The vast database on PRL in rats supports continuous studies with this species. Mice became useful after the development of the transgenic technology, filling a critical niche in research that cannot be done with rats. Despite their similar physiology, mice and rats are distinct species that should not be confused. Whereas humans are the one species we wish to know more about, it is also the species least accessible to experimental manipulations. Although some features of PRL in humans are well documented, e.g., effects of drugs, prolactinoma formation, and variants of PRL and its receptor, others remain obscure. By necessity, information derived from laboratory animals is essential for our understanding of PRL in human health and disease. Nonetheless, given the versatility and adaptive nature of PRL, extrapolation from rodents to humans should be done selectively and judiciously. At each chapter, we raise issues whether, or to what extent, data from rodents are relevant to PRL homeostasis in humans. Each section includes a short synopsis of the most critical points.\n\nII. The PRL Gene\n\nA. Overview of the PRL/GH/PL family\n\nBased on structural homology and overlapping biological properties, PRL belongs to a large family of proteins. Initially, the family was comprised of PRL, GH, and placental lactogens (PL) only, but it has been expanded to include PRL-like proteins, PRL-related proteins, proliferins, and proliferin-related protein, which exhibit variable degrees of sequence homology (1). The different members of the PRL/GH/PL family are expressed in species-, cell-, and temporal-specific patterns in the pituitary, the uteroplacental compartment, and other nonpituitary sites.\n\nGH is involved in the regulation of postnatal growth and metabolism, with its actions often mediated by IGF-I. Mice and rats have a single GH gene on chromosomes 11 and 10, respectively, which is expressed only in the pituitary gland. Humans, on the other hand, have five GH-related genes that are clustered on chromosome 17 (2). These include GH-N (normal), whose expression is restricted to the pituitary, and four GH/CS (chorionic somatomammotropin) proteins expressed in the placental syncytiotrophoblast: GH-V (variant GH), CS-A (PL-A), CS-B (PL-B) and CS-L (variant PL). Human (h) GH binds not only to its cognate receptor (GHR) but also to the PRL receptor (PRLR), and it mimics some PRL actions. In contrast, nonprimate GH binds only to the GHR. hPL regulate maternal carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (3). Despite the higher sequence homology of hPL to hGH than to hPRL and their GH-like metabolic functions, hPL bind to the PRLR.\n\nPRL has a much broader spectrum of activities than GH, and these are classified as reproduction, metabolism, osmoregulation, immunoregulation, and behavior (4). Rodents express many PRL-related genes, clustered on chromosome 13 in mice and 17 in rats. In rodents, PRL is mainly expressed in the pituitary, but also in the decidua (5) and the lactating mammary gland (6). Other PRL-related genes are expressed only in the uterus and placenta. In rodents, PL play an important role during the second half of pregnancy, replacing the markedly suppressed pituitary PRL (7). Humans express a single PRL gene on chromosome 6, although its expression is not restricted to the pituitary but occurs at multiple extrapituitary sites, where it is under tissue-specific control (8).\n\nB. Regulation of PRL gene expression\n\nBoth GH and PRL genes are composed of five exons separated by four introns. The PRL introns are longer, creating a much larger (about 10 kb) gene than GH (about 2 kb). As is typical of all secretory proteins, the PRL gene encodes a prohormone with an N-terminal signal peptide of 28–30 residues (Fig. 1). After proteolytic cleavage of the signal peptide, the mature PRL protein in rodents and humans is comprised of 197 and 199 residues, respectively.\n\n1. Rat pituitary PRL promoter.\n\nThe promoters controlling PRL and GH gene expression have been characterized in great detail. Most studies focus on the rat (r) PRL gene, a smaller number deals with hPRL, and none covers the control of mouse (m) PRL. This disproportionate attention to one species is due to the wide availability of the rat GH3 cell lines that have been in culture for over 40 yr and, unlike many cancer cell lines, exhibit high genetic stability. GH3 cells have retained many of the cell-specific functions of primary lactotrophs. However, because they lack functional dopamine type 2 receptors (D2R), the mechanism by which dopamine suppresses the PRL gene is more enigmatic. Other rat lactotroph cell lines, e.g., MMQ (9) and PR1 (10), have not been used as extensively as GH3 cells. It is puzzling why the plethora of PRL-producing cell lines are derived from the rat pituitary but not from human or mouse pituitaries. In contrast, there are many human PRL-producing cell lines of nonpituitary origin, as discussed in Section V.\n\nThe rPRL gene is controlled by a proximal promoter located between −250 and −20 bp and a distal enhancer located between −1800 and −1500 relative to the pituitary start site (reviewed in Ref. 11). A full promoter, extending from about −3,000 to +33, is required for pituitary-specific PRL expression in transgenic mice. The sequences flanking the enhancer restrict PRL expression to the pituitary lactotrophs in vivo (12). Figure 1 shows that the rPRL gene has multiple binding sites for Pit-1 protein: four sites (1p to 4p) in the proximal promoter and four sites (1d to 4d) in the enhancer (11). Pit-1 is a pituitary-specific transcription factor that is critical for development of lactotrophs, somatotrophs, and a subset of thyrotrophs (reviewed in Ref. 13). Mutations in Pit-1 cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency in both mice and humans (reviewed in Ref. 14). Pit-1 alone is necessary but insufficient for transcription of the PRL gene (13), and it regulates transcription by interacting with nuclear hormone receptors and a number of coregulators.\n\nThe estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor with high binding affinity to estrogen response element (ERE) in responsive genes (for review, see Ref. 15). GH3 cells express three ER types: ERα, ERβ, and TERP, a pituitary-specific truncated ER product (16, 17). ERα and ERβ, which are encoded by different genes, differ in their N-terminal ligand-independent transactivation domain (AF-1), but have highly conserved ligand- and DNA-binding domains. Both recognize similar ERE sequences and respond equally to 17β-estradiol, but they have different affinities to some estrogenic ligands, including xenoestrogens (reviewed in Ref. 18). When coexpressed, ERβ can act as an attenuator of ERα. TERP, which retains the ligand binding domain but lacks the DNA binding domain and has no independent activity, can suppress the activity of both ERα and ERβ (17).\n\nA single ERE, with four mismatches of the palindromic vitellogenin ERE sequence (GGTCAnnn TGACC), is located at the distal rPRL enhancer next to the 1d Pit-1 site (Fig. 1), enabling physical association between Pit-1 and ER via the AF-2 domain of ER (19). Complex formation between Pit-1 and ER involves coactivators/corepressors, with SRC-1 and GRIP1 stimulating and RIP140 inhibiting PRL promoter activity. The 1500-bp separation between the distal enhancer and proximal promoter raises the question how does the ER complex communicate with RNA polymerase. According to the looping model, activation of an ER complex causes formation of chromatin loops that bring the distal enhancer into juxtaposition with the proximal promoter (20).\n\nThe role of ERβ in the control of the PRL gene has been understudied because of misconceptions as to its pituitary expression. Clearly, the mouse pituitary expresses ERα but not ERβ (21, 22). Hence, PRL production is compromised in ERα-deficient mice (ERαKO), but is unaffected in ERβKO mice (22). In contrast, ERβ is expressed in rat (23–25) and human (26, 27) pituitaries. This translates into different regulation of PRL by estrogens in mice vs. rats and humans. Overexpression of ERβ in GH3 cells increases rPRL promoter activity (16), suggesting a functional role for ERβ in the control of the rPRL gene. With the availability of highly specific ERα and ERβ agonists and antagonists (28), the relative PRL transcriptional activities of the two ER isoforms should be reexamined.\n\n2. Human pituitary PRL promoter.\n\nThere is less information on the transcriptional regulation of hPRL. In the absence of a human pituitary cell line, the hPRL promoter has been transfected into GH3 cells. However, rat pituitary cells may not contain the same variety of transcriptional regulators as do human lactotrophs. The basic exon/intron organization of the PRL gene is similar in rats and humans (Fig. 1), with 90% sequence homology within the distal and proximal regions (29). However, additional upstream sequences (30) show a more complex organization of the hPRL gene, which is comprised of four regions: two superdistal regions (−5100/−4430 and −3474/−2600), a distal region (−1968/−1064), and a proximal promoter (−250/+1). It also contains more Pit-1 binding sites than the rPRL promoter: three in the proximal region, eight in the distal enhancer, and two in the superdistal region (reviewed in Ref. 14).\n\nGellersen et al. (31) showed a dramatic interaction between ER and Pit-1 that results in a 60-fold induction of the rPRL gene. In contrast, a liganded ER caused only 2-fold induction of a hPRL reporter gene, whether or not Pit-1 was present. They proposed that the difference in PRL inducibility by estrogens is due to a lack of sequence conservation between rat and human EREs. Although both have four mismatches relative to the perfect palindromic ERE, the mismatches are not the same. Consequently, the putative ERE site in the distal human promoter may not be compatible with high affinity ER binding.\n\n3. Human superdistal PRL promoter.\n\nPRL mRNA in the human decidua and lymphocytes was reported to be 150 nucleotides longer than the pituitary counterpart, although the mature PRL protein was identical (29, 32). As shown in Fig. 1, this elongation is due to a 5′ untranslated region (UTR), resulting from a noncoding exon (exon 1a) located 5.8 kb upstream of the pituitary start site (reviewed in Refs. 8 and 33). PRL transcription in extrapituitary sites is driven by an alternative promoter, named the decidual or superdistal promoter, not to be confused with the superdistal regions mentioned above that are associated with pituitary PRL. Alternative promoter usage is not a rare occurrence in genes that are under complex tissue- or developmental-specific transcriptional regulation, often resulting in mRNA variants that differ in transcriptional patterns or translational efficiencies (34).\n\nMultiple human tissues express PRL, including the endometrium, decidua, myometrium, T lymphocytes, leukocytes, brain, breast, prostate, skin, and adipose tissue (reviewed in Refs. 8 ,35 , and 36). PRL expression at these sites is cell type-specific and independent of Pit-1 (37). The superdistal promoter extends −3000 bp upstream of the decidual transcriptional start site and is composed of a proximal promoter between −350 and −60 and a distal enhancer between −2000 and −1500 (38, 39). A comparison of basal transcriptional activity of the superdistal promoter in several human cell types is shown in Fig. 2. Note the similarity of stimulatory and inhibitory elements in adipocytes, absence of an inhibitory region in lymphocytes, and a lack of transcriptional activity of the decidual-type promoter in T47D breast cancer cells.\n\ncAMP induces PRL in many extrapituitary sites by activating protein kinase A (PKA), which migrates to the nucleus and phosphorylates target proteins such as cAMP response element binding protein CREB (40). In endometrial cells, PRL shows a biphasic response to cAMP: an early small peak and a stronger, delayed stimulation. Whereas the early response is mediated by a cAMP response element located at −12 that binds CREB, the delayed response involves binding of C/EBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins) to sequences at −332/−270. In leukocytes, cAMP activates two signaling pathways: a PKA-dependent pathway leading to phosphorylation of CREB and a PKA-independent pathway leading to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (41). Several cAMP activating ligands, e.g., isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic receptor agonist, and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), increase PRL gene expression in breast preadipocytes via multiple signaling pathways (42).\n\nEstrogen does not appear to affect PRL expression in any extrapituitary tissue studied. Progesterone, on the other hand, is a prime example of a tissue-specific regulator because it inhibits PRL expression/release in both the myometrium (43) and breast epithelial tissue (44), but it is stimulatory in the decidualized endometrium (45).\n\nThe human breast may not conform to the same promoter utilization as in other extrapituitary sites (Fig. 2), with the decidual type PRL transcripts expressed in some, but not all, breast cancer cell lines (46). For example, BT-474, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-231, and ZR-75-1 use the decidual-type promoter, whereas both pituitary and decidual type promoters are used in MCF-10A, SK-BR-3, and T47D cells. SK-BR-3 cells have a functional pituitary promoter in the absence of Pit-1 expression, with Oct-1 possibly substituting for Pit-1 (47). Expression of Pit-1 in the human breast and MCF-7 cells has been reported (48), but it is unclear whether Pit-1 plays a role in the regulation of local PRL expression. It remains to be determined whether use of the pituitary-type promoter is unique to malignant cells or represents a common mechanism in other nonpituitary PRL-producing sites that thus far has escaped notice.\n\nSynopsis.\n\nThe regulation of pituitary PRL expression is generally similar in rodents and humans. The most striking difference relates to the effects of estrogens, with rats being highly responsive whereas humans are not. Unlike rodents, where PRL originates almost exclusively in the pituitary, PRL in humans is also produced by numerous extrapituitary sites where it is regulated in a cell-specific manner. The clinical implication is that even when pituitary PRL release is severely impaired, humans are not deprived of their local PRL. Consequently, rodents cannot serve as models for this aspect of PRL regulation.\n\nIII. PRL Proteins\n\nA. Structural characteristics\n\nMembers of the hematopoietic superfamily, to which PRL, GH, and PL belong, share a tertiary structure composed of a bundle of four antiparallel α-helices and utilize a conserved, single pass transmembrane receptor named cytokine type 1 receptor (reviewed in Refs. 49 and 50). The three hormones are single-chain polypeptides comprised of 190–200 residues with molecular mass of 22–23 kDa. They have two to three disulfide bridges whose location is conserved across species. Given its clinical importance, much effort has gone into the structural characterization of hGH, with the crystal structure of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of its receptor published in 1992 (51). Since then, the tertiary structure of hPL was determined by x-ray crystallography, whereas that of hPRL was resolved by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (50). The following discussion will focus on structural characteristics of hPRL, with comparisons made to hGH as well as to rodent PRLs.\n\n1. Primary sequence.\n\nPRL and GH show little sequence homology at the amino acid level except for a similar location of two disulfide bridges. hPRL has three disulfide bridges (between Cys 4 and 11, Cys 58 and 174, and Cys 191 and 199) that are similarly located in rPRL (Fig. 3). Mammalian and nonmammalian PRLs show variable sequence homology that reflects their philogenetic relationship (for review, see Ref. 52). For example, baboon PRL has 97% homology to hPRL, ovine and bovine have 76% each, whereas rats and mice have only 64 and 61% homology to hPRL, respectively. Primary sequence homology does not predict binding of PRL to a heterologous receptor. Despite their similar sequence homology, ovine PRL is bioactive in human breast cancer cells, whereas bovine PRL is not. Of significance is the recent report that mPRL does not activate the hPRLR, whereas rPRL does (53). As discussed later, this unexpected finding bears implications to the suitability of immunodeficient mice as an in vivo model for studying hormone-dependent human tumors.\n\nAnother unexpected finding is the binding of hPRL to heparin (54). Heparin binding proteins have topically exposed basic residues that interact with negatively charged sulfate and carboxyl groups of heparin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (55). Heparin binding is a unique property of hPRL that is not shared with hPL, hGH, rodent PRLs, or other pituitary hormones (54). Two motifs implicated in heparin binding are XBBXBX or XBBXXBX, where B is a basic amino acid (Arg, Lys, and infrequently His) and X is any neutral or hydrophobic amino acid. Such sequences are not always contiguous but can be brought into proximity by protein folding. hPRL has two such sequences: between residues 41–47 (Asp-Lys-Arg-Tyr-Thr-His-Gly) and between residues 175–181 (Leu-Arg-Arg-Asp-Ser-His-Lys), which are absent in the primary structure of hGH or hPL. Neither rat, ovine, and bovine PRL nor rGH bind to heparin (54). Binding of hPRL to heparin may enhance its action as an autocrine/paracrine factor by enriching its local concentrations in tissues such as decidua or adipose with high content of glycosaminoglycans.\n\n2. Posttranslational modifications.\n\nPRL undergoes several posttranslational modifications that impact its stability, half-life, receptor binding, and biological activity (reviewed in Refs. 52 and 56). These include polymerization, proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, and phosphorylation. In addition to the 23-kDa PRL, human serum contains macroprolactin (big-big PRL, >100 kDa) and big PRL (40–60 kDa). Macroprolactin (often called oligomeric PRL) is a complex of monomeric PRL with IgG (reviewed in Ref. 57). It has a longer half-life in the circulation and when elevated is often diagnosed as hyperprolactinemia. Given its large size, macroprolactin is likely confined to the intravascular compartment, has low bioactivity in vivo, and is not of major pathological significance.\n\nMuch attention has been paid to a 16-kDa N-terminal fragment of rPRL (58) and hPRL (59) named 16K PRL. It possesses different properties than the parent molecule by acting as an antiangiogenic factor. Clapp named 16K PRL and related N-terminal cleaved products “vasoinhibins” (reviewed in Ref. 60). Most antiangiogenic factors bind to the extracellular matrix rather than to classical membrane receptors. An early report of specific, high affinity binding sites of 16K PRL on endothelial cells (61) has not withstood the test of time, and the manner by which 16K PRL binds to its target cells remains enigmatic.\n\nBoth recombinant and proteolytically digested 16K PRL exert antiangiogenic activity (60). It is unclear, however, how and where 16K PRL is generated and whether it is an endogenous fragment or a laboratory-made compound that can be used as a therapeutic drug. By most accounts, cleavage occurs around residues 145–149 (Fig. 3). Because PRL has a disulfide bond between Cys 58 and 174, cleavage proceeds in two steps: generation of a nicked, covalently linked two-chain form followed by reduction of the disulfide bond, resulting in N-terminal 16-kDa and 8-kDa fragments. That leaves 16K PRL as a potentially unstable molecule with an uneven number of cysteines and altered folding. Indeed, when 16K PRL is made by using acidified mammary microsomal fractions, it must undergo carbamidomethylation to prevent reformation of the disulfide bonds (58).\n\nRecent studies identified cathepsin D as the enzyme responsible for the initial nick in rPRL (62). Cathepsin D is a lysosomal aspartyl endoprotease that degrades proteins at a very acidic pH. Hence, 16K rPRL can be generated both in the pituitary and locally in tissues that release cathepsin D. Although human serum and pituitary extracts separated on denaturing gels reveal PRL fragments of 14–18 kDa, similar electrophoretic mobilities can be misleading. For example, thrombin cleaves hPRL at a neutral pH into a C-terminal, not an N-terminal 16K fragment which is neither antiangiogenic nor mitogenic (63). Unlike rPRL, hPRL is resistant to cathepsin D because at the site of cleavage, Leu 146 in rPRL is replaced by Pro in hPRL. Hence, only N-terminal sequencing can definitely prove whether humans have an endogenous, antiangiogenic 16K PRL.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, hPRL is N-glycosylated on Asn 31 via an Asn-X-Ser consensus sequence (reviewed in Ref. 52). The carbohydrate moiety contains fucosylated and partially sialylated complex oligosaccharides (64), but the exact composition of glycosylated PRL in the human pituitary or at extrapituitary sites is uncertain. Pellegrini et al. (65) reported that glycosylated and nonglycosylated PRL utilize different routes of sorting and release, with glycosylated PRL constitutively secreted whereas the release of nonglycosylated PRL involves a storage step. This concept may be especially relevant to the release of glycosylated PRL in extrapituitary sites such as the decidua that lack secretory granules (66). Serum levels of glycosylated hPRL vary during pregnancy, lactation, hyperprolactinemia, and under certain disease states, and it is also abundant in human milk (67) and amniotic fluid (68). Glycosylated PRL has reduced receptor binding affinity and mitogenic activity, thereby diminishing PRL actions at target tissues (52). Yet, glycosylation may alter proteolytic cleavage of PRL, regulate its distribution, or delay its clearance.\n\nrPRL does not have the Asn-X-Ser consensus sequence for N-glycosylation and is instead O-glycosylated (69), with Thr 11 and Thr 58 the most likely residues (Fig. 3). The carbohydrate complex in rPRL is larger than that in hPRL, and it also stands apart by its high sialic acid content and significant charge heterogeneity. Con A-bound PRL constitutes more than 50% of serum PRL in rats, but only a minor component (less than 10%) in their pituitary, indicating either differential release rate or longer half-life of glycosylated PRL (70).\n\nPhosphorylated PRL has been characterized in bovine (71) and rat (72) pituitaries, but not in humans (73). The major phosphorylation site in bovine PRL is Ser 90, which is conserved in PRL, GH, and PL of most species. Addition of a bulky, negatively charged side chain to Ser 90 may disrupt hormone folding, reducing its receptor binding and impairing its biological activity (71). Ser 177, which is conserved in PRL from most species, is the primary phosphorylation site in rPRL (74). Phosphorylated PRL constitutes only a small fraction of total rat pituitary PRL content, raising the question how only a fraction of the PRL molecules undergo phosphorylation. One proposed mechanism is by differential sorting of PRL into heterogeneous secretory granules with dissimilar kinase activities. The ratio of phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated PRL in the rat pituitary is altered during the estrous cycle and pregnancy and in response to estrogen (reviewed in Ref. 72). Phosphorylated rPRL serves as an autocrine regulator of GH3 cell proliferation and lactotroph secretion, and it acts as an antagonist of PRL stimulation of Nb2 cell proliferation.\n\n3. Secondary and tertiary structures.\n\nKnowledge of the tertiary structure of PRL helps to understand its receptor binding and serves as the basis for a rational design of PRL superagonists and antagonists. Advances in molecular modeling and x-ray crystallography of GH and PL bound to the receptor facilitated the generation of three-dimensional PRL models, although PRL:PRLR has not yet been crystallized (49). In parallel, site-directed mutagenesis has identified critical residues in hPRL that affect its conformation or interaction with the receptor (75). The recent solution structure of PRL by NMR (50) highlighted several distinct structural features. Unfortunately, there are no structural data on mPRL or rPRL that might explain why the former does not bind to hPRLR, whereas the latter does (53).\n\nhPRL adopts a nonconventional “up-up-down-down” four helical bundle topology that is a common feature of the hematopoietic cytokines. The four helices together with the two connecting loops form a globular folding unit (reviewed in Ref. 76). The disulfide loops that typify the GH/PL/PRL proteins may not be essential for formation of the bundle because they are absent in other members of the superfamily.\n\nThe crystal structure of hGH reveals two asymmetric sites that bind two receptor molecules, forming an active 1:2 trimeric complex. In that, hGH differs from γINF, which uses two identical binding sites to dimerize its cognate receptors, and IL-6, which utilizes receptor heterodimerization (reviewed in Ref. 49). The high affinity (1–2 nm) binding site 1 in hGH is composed of residues on the exposed surface of helix 4 and the connecting loop between helix 1 and 2. Binding site 2 involves residues in helices 1 and 3. Unlike the concave binding crevice of site 1, binding site 2 is flat and is considered of low affinity (1–2 μm). The different affinities of the two binding sites have been exploited in the generation of superagonists and antagonists.\n\nAlthough hPRL resembles hGH in the conserved locations of the four helices, NMR spectroscopy revealed several discrete structural differences. According to Keeler et al. (50), these include: 1) an N-terminal loop that makes contact with helix 1; 2) an absent mini-helix between helices 1 and 2; and 3) a shorter loop between helices 2 and 3 that alters their alignment. They also identified specific residues that may participate in PRL binding to its receptor. Whether the two binding sites in hPRL are also asymmetric, as is the case with hGH, has not been unequivocally determined.\n\nDespite the useful structural information, several unresolved issues remain. One is the need for structural details on glycosylated and phosphorylated PRL. Because both crystallography and NMR require large amounts of highly purified proteins, bacterial expression systems, which do not undergo posttranslational modifications, are used. In addition, crystallization of ligand-receptor complexes uses only the extracellular domain (ECD) of the receptor. Future success in crystallizing the entire receptor should provide a much better insight of ligand-receptor interactions. A clear resolution is also needed for the issue of why hPRL binds to its receptor but not to hGHR, whereas hPRL, hPL, and hGH bind to the hPRLR. Finally, kinetic studies on ligand binding to the PRLR (77) reveal dynamic properties that cannot be uncovered in static structural studies. This and the evolving new concepts on the receptor predimerization (78, 79) are covered in Section IV.\n\nSynopsis.\n\nStudies on structural differences between human and rodent PRLs partially explain PRL phylogeny and its species-dependent adaptive nature. The variability in posttranslational modifications between PRL from these species is not substantial. Rodent and human PRLs differ in two main properties: the binding of human, but not rodent, PRL to heparin and the differential processing of 16K PRL in the two species. Studies with rodent PRLs do not contribute much to a better understanding of ligand-receptor interactions in human cells because this can be done with recombinant hPRL.\n\nIV. PRL Receptors and Signaling\n\nA. Structure-function relationship\n\nThe cytokine-type receptors are single-pass transmembrane proteins devoid of intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that can be phosphorylated by cytoplasmic proteins. They are subdivided into type I or type II, based on conserved features in the ECD, especially the number and spacing of cysteine and proline residues. The PRLR belongs to the type I subfamily, which includes PRL, GH, leptin, few ILs, erythropoietin, and leukemia inhibiting factor (reviewed in Refs. 49 and 80). Binding of PRL to its receptor activates several signaling pathways, which include the Janus kinase-Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-Stat), the MAPK, and the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K). Activation of these cascades results in endpoints such as differentiation, proliferation, survival, and secretion (reviewed in Ref. 81).\n\n1. Gene structure and regulation of transcription.\n\nThe hPRLR gene is located on chromosome 5 close to GHR. It is more than 100 kb long with 11 exons: E1-E11. Exons 1, 2, and part of exon 3 comprise the 5′ UTR, whereas the rest constitute the coding region (Fig. 4). The UTR contains six alternative first exons that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner: hE13, the human homolog of the rodent E13, and five others, termed hE1N1-hE1N5; are all spliced into a noncoding exon 2. Alternative splicing within the coding region yields isoforms that differ in length of the cytoplasmic domain. Transcription of the hPRLR gene is differentially regulated by several promoters, each driving a specific first exon (82).\n\nThe rPRLR gene is located on chromosome 2 close to the GHR gene. As shown in Fig. 4, the UTR has four alternative first exons (E11–4). The rPRLR contains three promoters: a gonad-specific PI, a liver-specific PII, and a ubiquitous PIII (83). The PI promoter has a consensus binding site for the SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1) protein. Despite the high PRLR expression in the liver, little is known about PII, except that it is activated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (84). The rat PIII promoter is activated by C/EBPβ and Sp1/Sp3. Splicing of exon 9 to exon 10 generates the long receptor isoform, whereas splicing of exon 9 to exon 11 generates the short form (85).\n\nThe mPRLR is the least characterized. It is regulated by five promoters, with P1 inactive due to a 2 base-pair alteration in the SF-1 binding site. The UTR in mPRLR contains two exons and is followed by 11 coding exons, the last four of which are alternatively spliced to produce four isoforms: one long and three, very similar, short isoforms; for clarity, only one of the short mouse isoforms is shown in Fig. 4. The cytoplasmic region is encoded by exon 10 for the L-PRLR, exon 12 for PRLR-S1, exon 11 for PRLR-S2, and exon 13 for PRLR-S3 (86).\n\n2. Receptor structure and ligand binding.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 4, the PRLR protein consists of an ECD, a short transmembrane domain (TM) and a variable intracellular domain (ICD) that mediates signaling (reviewed in Refs. 80 ,81 , and 87). The ECD is approximately 200 amino acids long and contains two subdomains, an amino-terminal region (S1), and a membrane-proximal region (S2), both of which have type III fibronectin-like motifs. Two pairs of disulfide bonds (between Cys12-Cys22 and Cys51-Cys62) in S1, and a “WS-motif” (Trp-Ser-x-Trp-Ser) in S2, which are highly conserved, are critical for receptor folding and trafficking. Within a given species, the ECDs of all PRLR isoforms are identical. The two disulfide bonds are preserved in all species, but the WSxWS domain is the same in rats and humans but not in mice, which have a WSxWG. The ECD of the rat and mouse PRLR is 95% homologous, differing by 11 residues only. The human ECD shows 71 and 74% homology to mice and rats, respectively.\n\nThe active ligand/receptor complex has a stoichiometry of one hormone bound to two receptors. In this mode, two ECDs interact with two asymmetric ligand binding sites located at opposite sides of the receptor core. Binding of the first receptor at site 1 is followed by recruitment of a second receptor at site 2 (49). To explain the increased affinity at site 2 after site 1 occupancy, Sivaprasad et al. (88) proposed that site 1 binding confers organization of site 2. Yet, using NMR, Teilum et al. (89) argued that such a conformational change is unlikely, suggesting instead that the increased affinity for PRLR at the second PRL site results from receptor-receptor interactions. Such interactions are supported by the report that once a 1:1 hPRL:hPRLR complex is formed, it readily binds a second PRLR but does not form a mixed 1:2 complex with hGHR as a second receptor (90).\n\nWhether PRL induces sequential dimerization of the PRLR or binds to predimerized receptors is controversial (reviewed in Ref. 78). Although the former represents a long-held view, the latter is gaining support, based on preformed dimers of GH and erythropoietin before ligand activation (91–93). Using combinations of various constructs, Gadd and Clevenger (79) argued for a ligand-independent dimerization of hPRLR. They found that the TM is sufficient for dimerization, but the interaction is strengthened by both the ECD and ICD. They suggested that one ECD is sufficient to bind PRL and induce the necessary conformational change for transducing the PRL signal. Ligand-independent homo- and heterodimers of hPRLR isoforms have also been reported by others (94).\n\nDespite the common practice of treating cells from one species with PRL from another, studies on interspecies differences in PRLR binding and activation have not received a high priority. An early study found that rPRL binds to hPRLR and induces clustering in T47D cells, albeit at a lower affinity than hPL (95). Recently, Utama et al. (53) reported that mPRL, which shares 84% sequence homology with rPRL, does not activate Stat5 or stimulate clustering of human breast cancer cells. Of the 23 residues in hPRL considered interactive with the hPRLR, mPRLs and rPRLs differ by 8 and 5, respectively. The lack of bioactivity of mPRL toward hPRLR may be due to one or more of these substitutions.\n\nSites referred to as “hot spots” consist of key residues that are involved in ligand-receptor interactions (96). Ala-scan analysis of hPRLR identified five ECD residues that are important for hPRL binding (49). Certain structural features also account for the promiscuity of hGH and the specificity of PRL. For example, zinc is required for binding of hGH to the hPRLR but not for binding of hPRL to its receptor. The angles between the N- and C-terminal ECDs of hGHR and hPRLR affect ligand binding and receptor-receptor interface (97). Another possible explanation for the broader preference of hGH is a mini-helix at the loop separating helix 1 and helix 2 (89). Partial unraveling of the mini-helix may be required for correct presentation of hGH residues that interact with hPRLR. Because this motif is absent in PL or PRL, it may explain the promiscuity of hGH in its receptor binding.\n\nA recent study revealed the strong effect of pH on the interaction between hPRL and the ECD of the hPRLR, whereas interaction of hGH with the same ECD was unaffected (98). The configuration and kinetics of PRL binding were dramatically altered within a pH range of 5.8 to 8.3. This was correlated with loss of PRL effectiveness in stimulating Nb2 cell proliferation and activating Stat5 in T47D breast cancer cells at pH 6 and below. Although blood pH is tightly regulated, this is not the case in the extravascular space within tumors, which is often more acidic.\n\n3. PRLR isoforms.\n\nAlternative splicing generates multiple PRLR isoforms, classified by the length of their ICD as long, intermediate, or short (Fig. 4). Humans have more PRLR isoforms than rats and mice combined. The long PRLR, considered the major isoform through which PRL transmits its signals, has an apparent mass of 90 kDa and is composed of 588 amino acids with 364 residues in the ICD. The ICD contains 10 tyrosine residues (only nine in rodents) whose location and adjacent amino acids determine whether they become phosphorylated after receptor activation.\n\nAs reviewed by Clevenger et al. (81), the membrane proximal region of the ICD contains a proline-rich hydrophobic motif named Box 1, Variable Box (V-Box), Box 2, and Extended Box 2 (X-Box). Box 1 and Box 2 are conserved across the cytokine receptor superfamily. Box 1 contains a Pro-x-Pro sequence that adopts the typical folding of SH3-binding domains and is recognized by signal transducers (99). Box 2 consists of hydrophobic, negatively charged, and then positively charged residues and is missing in some of the short isoforms.\n\nHumans have an intermediate receptor isoform of 50 kDa, resulting from a frame shift after residue 312 (Fig. 4). Only three of the nine tyrosine residues in Box 1 are preserved. Despite missing 191 residues in the ICD, this isoform can activate Jak2, but not Fyn tyrosine kinase. It also cannot induce cell proliferation in response to PRL but is equipotent with the long form in mediating cell survival (100). As shown in Fig. 4, alternative splicing and deletion generate multiple short hPRLR isoforms. Both the S1a and S1b isoforms are spliced into exon 11 (101). The S1a isoform has 376 amino acids and includes part of exon 10 and 39 amino acids from exon 11, whereas S1b lacks exon 10 and contains only three residues from exon 11. Both have similar binding affinities to the long form, but do not mediate transcriptional activation of β-casein. When coexpressed with the long form, they act as dominant negatives. Other human short isoforms were also identified (102, 103).\n\nSoluble receptor isoforms containing the ECD have been identified in humans but not in rodents. A PRL binding protein of 33 kDa is present in human serum and milk and may arise by proteolysis (104). Soluble receptors can affect PRL homeostasis by: 1) prolonging its circulation time and biological activity due to a more stable hormone pool; 2) reducing its effective concentrations through competitive binding with membrane receptors; 3) dimerizing with and inactivating functional PRLR isoforms; or 4) affecting GH availability due to their capacity to bind hGH (105).\n\nPRLR isoforms of variable length also exist in rodents (Fig. 4). In rats, the long PRLR has 591 amino acids, 357 of which are in the ICD (106). The mouse long isoform spans 589 amino acids, with 355 in the ICD (107). Their sequences reveal 90% homology, including conservation of Box 1 and the nine tyrosine residues. Both rodent ICDs have 65% homology with humans, but due to preservation of different residues in rats and mice. Rats, but not mice, have an intermediate PRLR isoform with the ECD, TM, and a membrane proximal region identical to the long isoform. It differs from the long isoform by a 198-amino acid deletion (amino acids 323–520) in the ICD (108). This isoform is exclusively found in rat Nb2 lymphoma cells, which express it at high levels and depend on PRL for proliferation and survival. The unusual strong mitogenic and antiapoptotic properties of this isoform in Nb2 cells serve as the basis for a common bioassay for PRL.\n\nLong before their discovery in humans, short PRLR isoforms were identified in rodents. The rat short PRLR encodes a small protein (291 residues) with 57 amino acids within the ICD (85). It is identical to the long isoform up to residue 261 and differs thereafter (Fig. 4). The mouse has three short isoforms, S1, S2, and S3, with unique C-terminal sequences following 27 common membrane-proximal residues in the ICD (109). As in humans, the rat short isoform exerts dominant-negative effects on signals by the long form (110). However, the short form mediates unique actions of PRL in the rat corpus luteum (CL) (111), and its overexpression compensates for a partial loss of the long form in PRLR+/− knockout mice (112), indicating that it has distinct functions.\n\nThe PRLR is ubiquitously expressed, with the ratio of isoforms varying among tissues, during development, and at different stages of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation in rodents (reviewed in Ref. 87). The long isoform is highly expressed in the adrenal, kidney, mammary gland, small intestine, choroid plexus, and pancreas, whereas other tissues, i.e., the liver, also express high levels of the short isoform. PRLR expression varies with the reproductive stage, increasing in the ovary and the uterus during proestrus (113). In the mammary gland, PRLR expression increases during pregnancy, rises at parturition, and declines after weaning (114). The changes in PRLR could be due to alterations in serum PRL, as supported by the up-regulation of the PRLR in PRL-overexpressing MBA-MD-435 breast cancer cells (115) and MCF-7 cells treated with PRL (116).\n\nB. Signaling pathways\n\n1. The Jak-Stat pathway.\n\nJak-Stat signaling is the best characterized of the PRL activated pathways. Jaks are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, whereas Stats are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors composed of a modular structure of five domains. Phosphorylation of a tyrosine downstream of the SH2 domain is critical for Stat activation (117). Jak2, which is constitutively associated with Box 1 of the PRLR, is rapidly activated after receptor dimerization and phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the PRLR (118). Stat proteins, attached by SH2 domains to phosphotyrosine residues on the PRLR, are also targets of activated Jak2, with Stat 5a and Stat5b the primary mediators of PRL action. After phosphorylation, Stat proteins disengage from the PRLR, homo- or heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to GAS (γ interferon activated site) elements and promote transcription of target genes (119).\n\nTermination of signaling is an important component of hormone action. Although receptor desensitization and internalization usually terminate the action of G protein-linked receptors, the Jak/Stat signaling utilizes other termination steps, including inhibition by suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), dephosphorylation, and ubiquitination (reviewed in Refs. 81 and120). SOCS proteins bind to the receptor or to Jaks and attenuate signaling by competing with Stats for receptor docking sites and also target interacting proteins for degradation. PRL induces rapid activation of SOCS-1, SOCS-3, and CIS (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein) in hypothalamic neurons, adipocytes, and mammary cells (121–123). There is also evidence for PRL-induced internalization of its receptor, especially the short isoforms (81).\n\nThe initial work on Jak2 as a PRLR-associated tyrosine kinase used Nb2 cells that express a high copy number of the intermediate PRLR isoform (124, 125). Because no other rodent or human cell line expresses this mutant receptor, Nb2 cells are not considered representatives for PRL action in human cancer cells (126). Induction of milk proteins by PRL has been studied with the HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells (MEC), which synthesize β-casein in response to PRL, insulin, and glucocorticoids (127). PRL rapidly activates Jak2, stimulates phosphorylation of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5, and induces proliferation of T47D, BT-20, and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (128, 129). In MCF-7 cells, PRL increases expression of the cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1 (130).\n\n2. Other PRL-activated signaling pathways.\n\nThe Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway also mediates PRL actions in both rodent and human cells (reviewed in Refs. 81 and 131). Of the MAPKs, ERK1/2 and c-jun N-terminal kinase are primarily activated by PRL. In Nb2 cells, PRL stimulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation within minutes, whereas inhibition of MAPK kinase (MEK), an upstream activator of MAPKs, abolished the PRL-induced mitogenesis (132). Because MEK inhibition does not affect PRL-induced β-casein synthesis in mouse mammary explants, this pathway may not play a role in milk protein synthesis (133). PRL also induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in human breast cancer cells (134).\n\nThe PI3K pathway often involves activation of Akt. PRL has an Akt-mediated antiapoptotic effect in the rat decidua via inhibition of caspase 3 activity (135), and it also prevents apoptosis in MEC in an Akt-dependent manner (136). In Nb2 cells, PRL stimulates rapid phosphorylation of the mammalian target-of-rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine protein kinase that is an integral component of the PI3K pathway (137, 138). PRL also enhances migration of breast cancer cells by modulating the cytoskeleton and interacting with adhesion kinases (139).\n\nRycyzyn and Clevenger (140) reported internalization of PRL via receptor-mediated endocytosis. They found that PRL interacts with cyclophilin B, a peptidyl prolyl isomerase, and is transported into the nucleus by a process termed retrotranslocation. The intranuclear PRL/cyclophilin B complex acts as a transcriptional inducer that interacts with Stat5. Another laboratory did not confirm nuclear translocations of either PRL or its receptor in several cell types (141), and hence this new concept of direct genomic actions of PRL remains controversial.\n\nSynopsis.\n\nStructure-based explanation for cross-activation of hPRL, hGH, and hPL of the hPRLR remains a major challenge that can be pursued only with human-based materials. PRL-activated signaling pathways appear similar in rodent and human cells except for the abundance of PRLR isoforms with a potential for unique signaling in humans. Both rodent and human cell lines express the PRLR to varying degrees, but many human cells also produce PRL. Although rodent cells do not make PRL, they are often cultured with serum supplements that contain lactogenic hormones. Hence, studies evaluating PRL signaling should consider the presence of endogenous or media-derived PRL that can mask the effects of exogenous PRL.\n\nV. PRL Release\n\nA. Regulation of pituitary PRL release\n\nRats serve as the animal of choice for several reasons. First, their large size enables sequential bleeding for studying PRL responses to experimental manipulations. Second, they can be used for making hypothalamic lesions, introducing factors into the brain, and collecting hypophysial portal blood. Third, the large selection of rPRL-producing cell lines and ease of culturing primary rat pituitary cells enable mechanistic studies on PRL release. Although anatomical details are limited and surgical manipulations are restricted in mice, spontaneous and experimentally induced altered genotypes have clarified many aspects of the control of PRL release. The wide selection of dopamine-altering drugs in clinical practice provided a wealth of information on the effects of drugs on PRL release in humans.\n\nLactotrophs comprise 30–50% of rat pituitary cells. They represent a dynamic population of cells with a remarkable ability to adapt to changes in the internal or external environment. Lactotrophs have a large storage capacity and release PRL by a calcium-dependent exocytosis, constituting an additional regulatory level for PRL beyond gene expression. The lactotroph is unique by having an inherent capacity for high constitutive production and secretion of PRL. Unlike hormones such as LH or ACTH, where the hypothalamus provides a positive stimulus and peripheral target glands supply negative feedback inhibition, PRL does not have a single target organ. Instead, its main regulation is provided in the form of tonic inhibition by dopamine, which is counteracted by stimulatory actions of many neuropeptides, steroids, and growth factors (reviewed in Ref. 142).\n\nThe regulators of PRL release can be classified into four categories: endocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and autocrine (reviewed in Ref. 143). Endocrine agents originate in the hypothalamus and the gonads and reach the lactotrophs by the blood. Paracrine factors are produced by other pituitary cells and reach the lactotrophs by diffusion. Juxtacrine interactions emanate from the extracellular matrix and adjacent cells. Autocrine agents are synthesized by the lactotrophs. Hence, at any given time, the secretory activity of the lactotrophs reflects a balance between local and distant releasing and inhibiting factors. For simplicity, we will separately discuss dopamine, estrogens, and releasing/regulating factors, first in rats, and then in mice and humans. A more detailed coverage of the control of PRL release is found in several reviews (142–145).\n\n1. The dopaminergic systems.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5, PRL release in rats is regulated by three hypothalamic dopaminergic neuronal systems, the TIDA (tuberoinfundibular), THDA (tuberohypophysial), and PHDA (periventricular) (reviewed in Refs. 142 and 144). TIDA perikarya from the arcuate nucleus have terminals in the median eminence that do not form synapses and function as true neurosecretory neurons. Dopamine is carried to the anterior pituitary by the long portal vessels (146). The THDA neurons from the rostral arcuate nucleus have terminals in the neural lobe (NL) and intermediate lobe of the pituitary. The PHDA neurons have perikarya in the periventricular nucleus and terminals in the intermediate lobe. The NL terminals are neurosecretory, whereas those in the intermediate lobe synapse on melanotrophs. Short portal vessels that connect the neural and anterior lobes enable dopamine delivery to the lactotrophs. The intermediate lobe is avascular, and its dopamine must reach the lactotrophs by diffusion. The relative input from the three systems to the anterior pituitary varies under different conditions (147, 148).\n\nPRL regulates its own release by affecting the dopaminergic neurons via a short loop negative feedback (Fig. 5). Next to the choroid plexus, the hypothalamus has the highest density of PRLR within the brain. The PRLR colocalizes with neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 149). PRL reaches the arcuate nuclei by retrograde blood flow from the pituitary (150) or from the cerebrospinal fluid via receptor-mediated uptake at the choroid plexus (151). The dopaminergic neurons are activated by both acute and chronic elevations in PRL. The activation (phosphorylation) and induction (increased transcription) of TH by PRL are mediated by nonoverlapping signaling pathways (152). During late pregnancy and lactation and after prolactinoma formation, these neurons become refractory to negative feedback by PRL, enabling physiological or pathological hyperprolactinemia (reviewed in Refs. 153 and 154). Such insensitivity in lactating rats is due to higher expression of CIS, a member of the SOCS family, which inhibits PRL signaling via Stat 5 (155).\n\nDopamine binds to the D2R, a G protein-coupled receptor in the lactotrophs. The five dopamine receptors are divided into D1-like receptors (D1 and D5), which increase adenylyl cyclase activity in response to dopamine, and D2-like receptors (D2, D3, and D4), which inhibit it (reviewed in Ref. 142). Alternative splicing of D2R yields long (D2L) and short (D2S) isoforms. The short isoform has a 29-amino acid deletion in the third intracytoplasmic domain, where interactions with G0/Gi proteins occur. Despite a similar binding affinity to dopamine, the two isoforms differ in their coupling to second messengers. The long isoform is predominant in the pituitary, and its expression is regulated by sex steroids (156).\n\nThe actions of dopamine on the lactotrophs are best viewed as a continuum rather than as discrete events (reviewed in Refs. 142 and 157). Within seconds, dopamine increases potassium conductance and inactivates voltage-sensitive calcium channels. This results in membrane hyperpolarization, reduced intracellular calcium, and inhibition of PRL release. An elevated intracellular calcium accounts for high basal PRL release in the absence of dopamine and its suppression upon exposure to dopamine. Within minutes to hours, dopamine suppresses adenylyl cyclase and inositol phosphate metabolism, leading to down-regulation of the PRL gene. Within days, dopamine inhibits lactotroph proliferation.\n\nFew anatomical details are known about the dopaminergic systems in mice. TH-positive neurons, corresponding to the TIDA in the rat, are located in the arcuate nucleus with terminals in the median eminence; it is unknown whether mice have the two other dopaminergic systems (reviewed in Ref. 158). The number and intensity of the TIDA neurons are reduced in Ames and Snell dwarf mice, which lack GH, PRL, and TSH due to mutations in Prophet of pit-1 and pit-1, respectively. Since their nigra-striatal dopaminergic neurons are intact, PRL input appears necessary for maintaining the integrity of the TIDA system. PRL replacement restores the TIDA neurons if begun before 21 d of age, indicating that PRL serves as a neurotropic factor in these neurons during development.\n\nThree types of transgenic mice with altered dopamine that markedly affects PRL physiology have been generated: 1) those with a deletion of the D2R that prevents dopamine action; 2) those with a deletion of the dopamine transporter (DAT), which increases dopamine availability; and 3) those overexpressing either the long or short dopamine receptors in the lactotrophs. The phenotype of these animals has not always been what was predicted.\n\nTwo groups have described the effects of loss of D2R on the neuroendocrine axis (159, 160). The major phenotype is chronic hyperprolactinemia and lactotroph hyperplasia that develops into adenoma in aged females only. PRL expression is robust, with a slight decrease in GH and no changes in other pituitary hormones. Null mice of either sex have 3- to 4-fold higher basal PRL levels than normal mice. Females have higher serum PRL levels than males, underscoring the importance of estrogen in the control of PRL in rodents.\n\nDAT deletion results in an almost opposite phenotype (161). The DAT takes up secreted dopamine, thereby conserving the released neurotransmitter and terminating its synaptic action. DAT deletion results in increased dopaminergic tone, anterior pituitary hypoplasia, dwarfism, and inability to lactate. The reduced pituitary size is due to decreased number of lactotrophs and somatotrophs without a change in other cells. With more dopamine presumably reaching the pituitary in DAT-null mice, one would expect reduced PRL content and low serum PRL levels. Yet, these mice have unchanged basal serum PRL levels despite a 70–80% reduction in PRL content. So, despite a lower number of lactotrophs, rapid PRL turnover in the remaining lactotrophs or their increased sensitivity to PRL secretagogues may explain the maintenance of near normal basal serum PRL.\n\nOverexpression of D2S results in pituitary hypoplasia, reduced PRL mRNA levels and pituitary content, and a marked decline in serum PRL (162). In contrast, overexpression of D2L has little effect on PRL mRNA levels or content but a marked rise in its serum levels. It is unclear, however, whether a 10- to 20-fold increase in expression of a single D2R isoform without changing the other represents their function under normal conditions, when their ratio is tightly regulated.\n\nAlthough the human fetus has a well-developed pituitary intermediate lobe, it disintegrates immediately after birth. Thus, the anatomy of the hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons in adult humans differs from that in the rat (Fig. 5). In postmortem brains, TH immunoreactivity was detected in the walls of the third ventricle, the arcuate and periventricular nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamic area (163). Fluorescent catecholaminergic neurons were seen only in the arcuate nuclei in human fetuses (164). Neither study is definitive for dopaminergic neurons because noradrenergic neurons are also detectable by both methods. DAT was not detected in the ventral hypothalamus of adult men (165). There is no information on whether there is sexual dimorphism in human hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons or whether the NL contains dopaminergic terminals as is the case in rats.\n\nExpression of functional D2R in the human pituitary, presumably on lactotrophs, is evident by ligand binding, autoradiography, and immunocytochemistry and validated by in vivo imaging (reviewed in Ref. 166). Dopamine and bromocriptine, the dopaminergic agonist, suppress PRL release from normal or tumorous human pituitary cell cultures (167, 168). Moreover, there is an extensive literature on changes in PRL release by drugs that increase dopamine availability or reduce its effectiveness (reviewed in Refs. 142 and 169). Diseases requiring long-term treatment with dopamine-altering drugs include Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, depression, and hypertension. Dopamine agonists used to treat hyperprolactinemia are covered in Section VIII.\n\nUntreated Parkinson’s patients with impaired nigra-striatal dopaminergic neurons have normal basal and episodic PRL release (170). The function of the TIDA neurons is conserved, possibly due to protective effects by local neurotropic factors. Long-term L-dopa therapy, alone or in combination with D2R agonists, results in lower serum PRL but an unchanged PRL response to TRH in these patients (171). The prolonged hypoprolactinemia causes no obvious clinical pathology.\n\nHyperdopaminergia was initially proposed to explain the neurochemical basis of schizophrenia. Recent theories, although not disputing a major role for dopamine, maintain that schizophrenia also involves alterations in serotonin, glutamate, or cholinergic systems (reviewed in Ref. 172). The first generation antipsychotics, i.e., chloropromazine, haloperidol, and trifluoperazine, suppressed dopamine and increased serum PRL levels, causing amenorrhea in some women and sexual dysfunction in some men (reviewed in Refs. 169 and 173). Such adverse effects led to the development of a second generation of drugs, the atypical neuroleptics. Drugs such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzepine do not produce significant extrapyramidal side effects, and their improved efficacy on cognitive functions is attributed to high serotonin-to-dopamine receptor blockade ratio. Most of these drugs produce little or transient rises in serum PRL levels except for risperidone, which resembles the classical neuroleptics in its ability to raise PRL (174).\n\nSerotonin receptor agonists and reuptake inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of depression. Although animal studies showed that drugs that increase serotonin efficacy stimulate PRL release (reviewed in Ref. 144), most serotonergic drugs, with the exception of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors D-fenfluramine and desimipramine, have little effect on serum PRL levels in humans (reviewed in Ref. 175). In contrast, monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as moclobemide, used as antidepressants, induce both acute and prolonged rises in plasma PRL levels. Several other drugs in clinical practice also affect PRL release (reviewed in Refs. 142 and 175). Among these are the D2R receptor antagonists metoclopramide and domperidone, used to treat gastric motility disorders; verapamil, a calcium channel blocker used to treat cardiovascular disease; and α-methyldopa and reserpine, used to treat hypertension. The effects of opioidergic drugs used in alleviating chronic pain on PRL release vary with the type of drug, dose, and duration of treatment.\n\n2. Estrogens.\n\nIn rats, estrogens affect PRL at the hypothalamus, posterior pituitary, and anterior pituitary. Many TH-positive neurons in the arcuate nucleus express ERα (176), whereas ERβ is barely detectable (177). Basal TIDA activity is higher in females than males and is suppressed by ovariectomy. A direct action of estrogen is supported by the suppression of TH activity in fetal rat hypothalamic neurons incubated with estrogen (178). Estradiol also induces rapid release of dopamine from rat posterior pituitary explants, without affecting its release from medial basal hypothalamic explants, indicating differential effects on the two dopaminergic systems (179).\n\nERβ is detectable in the rat pituitary anlage as early as embryonic d 12–13, whereas ERα is seen only on d 17 (180). In adults, both ERα and ERβ are expressed in most anterior pituitary cells (23, 181). The differential regulation of expression and interactions (e.g., dimerization) between the ER isoforms enables fine tuning of pituitary responsiveness to estrogens. At the level of the lactotroph, estrogens stimulate PRL gene expression and release, enhance storage capacity, and increase cell proliferation (reviewed in Refs. 142 and 144). Whereas some actions are exerted directly on the lactotrophs, others involve interactions with neighboring cells, especially follicular stellate cells (reviewed in Ref. 182).\n\nVirtually nothing is known about the dynamics of PRL release in response to estrogens in normal mice. Instead, all information is derived from ERαKO or ERβKO mice. Unlike rats and humans, ERβ is not expressed in the mouse pituitary, and ERβKO females have normal pregnancy and lactation and no alterations in PRL (reviewed in Ref. 21). Scully et al. (183) reported 10- and 20-fold lower PRL mRNA levels in ERαKO males and females, respectively, compared with normal mice, with less dramatic changes in serum PRL, likely due to compensatory mechanisms.\n\nSome reports on ER distribution in the human hypothalamo-pituitary axis predate the 1996 discovery of ERβ. In a 1990 study, ER mRNA was detected in the basal hypothalamus in both postmenopausal and premenopausal women (184). Within the pituitary, expression of both ERα and ERβ is seen in midgestational human fetuses (185), as well as in normal and neoplastic glands from adults (186–188). The receptors are mostly localized to lactotrophs and gonadotrophs and infrequently to other pituitary cell types.\n\nStatements in the literature that estrogens play a central role in the control of PRL release in humans are often based on rodent data, with little direct evidence from humans. The following observations are supportive of positive effects of estrogen on PRL release: 1) higher basal serum PRL levels in women than men; 2) marked increase in serum PRL levels and number of lactotrophs during pregnancy, temporally correlating with the rise in estrogens; 3) higher incidence of prolactinomas in younger women than men; 4) increased PRL release in response to estradiol in hypogonadal women and transsexual (male to female) individuals; and 5) higher mean serum PRL levels and PRL pulse frequency in cycling women than in postmenopausal women or in men (189–191).\n\nThe following counterarguments maintain that estrogens have negligible effects on PRL release in humans: 1) PRL is not elevated in the middle of the menstrual cycle together with the estrogen-induced preovulatory LH surge; 2) there are only sporadic cases of increased serum PRL or higher incidence of prolactinomas in women taking oral contraceptives; 3) basal serum PRL levels are not reduced after oophrectomy; 4) there are no changes in serum PRL levels in postmenopausal women taking antiestrogens such as raloxifen (192–194); and 5) there are inconsistent reports that estrogens increase PRL release from human pituitary cell cultures (167, 168).\n\nIt must be concluded that endogenous estrogens have only modest stimulatory influence on PRL release in normal subjects, with such effects more pronounced in hypogonadal individuals exposed to estrogens. It is unclear whether the substantial rise in PRL during pregnancy is driven by estrogens or is attributed to other pregnancy-related factors. Yet, it is possible that certain individuals are more susceptible than others to the effects of endogenous or exogenous estrogens (i.e., estrogenic drugs or xenoestrogens), due to alterations in their neuroendocrine axis that regulates PRL.\n\n3. PRL releasing/regulating factors.\n\nThe search for the ultimate PRL-releasing factor (PRF) has been going for over 40 yr, but to no avail. The inevitable conclusion is that there may not be a singular potent PRF but instead, many factors counteract inhibition by dopamine. Nondopaminergic regulators of PRL are divided into three categories: 1) those that alter dopamine; 2) those that affect other hypothalamic regulating factors; and 3) those that act directly on lactotrophs (reviewed in Refs. 142–144).\n\nOpioids stimulate PRL release by inhibiting dopamine. The rat hypothalamus contains perikarya of three opioid classes, i.e., proopiomelanocortin, endorphins, and enkephalins. They act as paracrine regulators of the TIDA neurons via κ- and μ-opioid receptors (195, 196). Interactions between opioids and TIDA neurons are especially extensive during the proestrus PRL surge, its nocturnal rise in pregnancy, and during suckling (196, 197). A κ-receptor agonist stimulates PRL release in monkeys in a dopamine-dependent manner (198), and PRL is elevated in humans addicted to opium and to a lesser extent in long-term cigarette smokers (199).\n\nThe stimulatory effect of serotonin on PRL release is well recognized (reviewed in Ref. 200). Serotonergic neurons from the raphe nucleus terminate in the suprachiasmatic and arcuate nuclei. Drugs that impair serotonergic transmission or lesions of the raphe nucleus prevent PRL rises in response to stress and suckling. However, there is no consistent effect of serotonin agonists on TIDA neuronal activity, and serotonin may affect PRL release by stimulating the release of putative PRF(s). Detailed information on neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide Y, neurotensin, angiotensin II, calcitonin, bombesin-like peptides, and atrial natriuretic peptides that primarily interact with the dopaminergic systems, is covered elsewhere (142, 144, 201).\n\nThe original criteria for hypothalamic releasing/inhibiting factors include localization within the hypophysiotropic area of the hypothalamus, presence in portal blood, binding to specific receptors on lactotrophs, and alterations in expression/release that reflect changes in PRL secretion. Because many of these compounds are also produced within the pituitary, broadening of the criteria for PRL-regulating factors became necessary. Selected peptides that affect PRL gene expression/release by acting directly on the lactotrophs are featured below.\n\nTRH neurons in the paraventricular nuclei with terminals in the median eminence secrete TRH into portal blood (reviewed in Refs. 142 and 144). TRH binds to type 1 TRH receptor expressed in both thyrotrophs and lactotrophs (reviewed in Ref. 202). TRH stimulates PRL release especially when the dopaminergic input is low or absent. It induces a rapid, biphasic rise in intracellular calcium, leading to increased PRL release and induction of the PRL gene via protein kinase C- and calcium-dependent activation of MAPK. TRH is not considered a critical PRF, as judged by lower basal serum PRL levels but a normal number of lactotrophs and unimpaired suckling-induced PRL release in type 1 TRH receptor- deficient mice (203). A TRH stimulation test is often used to diagnose hyperprolactinemia in patients (204), but its physiological importance as a regulator of PRL release in humans is unclear.\n\nVasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a 28-amino acid peptide present at high concentrations in portal blood (reviewed in Ref. 205). VIP is also produced by the lactotrophs, where it maintains elevated basal PRL release (206). VIP acts by increasing intracellular cAMP, followed by PKA activation. VIP is more sluggish and less potent as a PRL secretagogue than TRH. VIP- and VIP receptor-deficient mice show no alterations in PRL (207, 208). VIP increases PRL secretion from incubated primary human pituitary cells only at micromolar concentrations (209). The general consensus is that VIP is not a potent PRL secretagogue in humans.\n\nTwo peptides, consisting of 20 and 31 amino acids, were named PRL-releasing peptides (PrRP20 and PrRP31), based on their ability to increase PRL release in vitro. However, it is presently questioned whether they truly deserve their assigned name (reviewed in Ref. 210). Although only PRL release is increased when PrRP is incubated with rat pituitary cells, this required pharmacological doses. Also, their expression is low to undetectable in the ventral hypothalamus or median eminence, raising the question how they might reach the pituitary. Because both peptides and their receptors are abundant in rat and human pituitaries, they may regulate PRL release as autocrine/paracrine factors. If so, they do not differ from other locally produced peptides/growth factors that affect PRL secretion but should not be classified as hypothalamic releasing factors.\n\nOxytocin is a nonapeptide produced by the magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Oxytocin is released at times of elevated PRL secretion such as during suckling, the afternoon of proestrus, after estradiol administration, and during immobilization stress (reviewed in Refs. 143 and 211). Because oxytocin and PRL have different thresholds of activation and dissimilar kinetics, their corelease may be coincidental. The general consensus is that oxytocin is not a major PRF, but it may modulate PRL release under some conditions.\n\nAnother PRF was discovered when posterior pituitary lobectomized rats were used. Suckling, with or without oxytocin replacement, failed to increase plasma PRL levels, indicating the presence of PRF (212). Posterior pituitary PRF participates in the generation of the proestrus PRL surge, mediates the acute estradiol-induced rise in PRL, contributes to the nocturnal rise in PRL during early pregnancy, but is not involved in stress-induced PRL release (reviewed in Ref. 213). Attempts to isolate this PRF from posterior pituitaries from several species were unsuccessful.\n\nB. Regulation of extrapituitary PRL release\n\nKnowledge of the control of PRL release in extrapituitary sites lags behind that of pituitary PRL for several reasons. First, human tissues are not as readily available and show significant variability among specimens. Second, PRL release from such sites is several orders of magnitude lower than pituitary PRL, requiring the use of more sensitive, but often less specific, bioassays. Third, there is no uniform mechanism for the control of PRL release in the various sites, with each cell type utilizing a different set of regulators. There is no evidence for PRL storage granules at extrapituitary sites, implying constitutive PRL release rather than the calcium-dependent exocytosis as in the lactotrophs. Without vesicular storage, the primary regulation of nonpituitary PRL must be transcriptional, like most cytokines. Despite the dissimilar regulation of pituitary and nonpituitary PRL, both are under inhibitory controls, as judged by a progressive rise in PRL release in cultured PRL-producing cells from most sites. Although dopamine is the physiological inhibitor of pituitary PRL, there may not be a singular potent inhibitor in other PRL-producing cells.\n\n1. PRL release from the decidua and myometrium.\n\nProduction of PRL outside the pituitary was first discovered in the decidua, after finding very high PRL levels in the amniotic fluid. PRL in amniotic fluid peaks at 20–24 wk gestation and is temporally and quantitatively distinct from maternal or fetal serum PRL profiles (214–216). PRL synthesis is first detected in the uterine stromal cells in the midsecretory phase of the menstrual cycle, coinciding with the early signs of decidualization. Decidualization is a critical step in the initiation and establishment of pregnancy and is mainly controlled by progesterone acting on an estrogen-primed uterus (reviewed in Refs. 35 ,217 , and 218). Although PRL induction in the decidualized endometrium depends upon progesterone, the steroid is necessary for initiating and maintaining decidualization, but it has no direct effects on decidual PRL (dPRL) gene expression (37).\n\nThe synthesis and release of dPRL are not affected by dopamine, TRH, or estrogen (reviewed in Ref. 35). This is not unexpected because dPRL gene expression is regulated by the superdistal promoter, discussed in Section II. The failure of the dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine to suppress dPRL release in vitro is consistent with clinical studies showing that bromocriptine therapy during pregnancy suppresses maternal and fetal serum PRL levels but does not alter amniotic fluid PRL. Many factors affect dPRL release, most of which are inhibitory (reviewed in Refs. 35 ,218 , and 219). Among the stimulators are insulin, IGF-I, and relaxin, whereas inhibitors include several ILs (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-8), TNFα, ET (endothelin)-1, arachidonic acid, TGFβ, and lipocortin I (also called annexin I). Some of these are produced by decidual cells, whereas others originate from infiltrating macrophages. This suggests that a complex autocrine/paracrine mechanism governs dPRL production.\n\nHuman myometrial tissue also synthesizes PRL. PRL release from myometrial explants was low to undetectable on d 1 of culture but increased many fold by d 4 (220). A similar profile of PRL release was observed in explants of leiomyomas, benign tumors of the myometrium. Incubation of myometrial explants with human chorionic gonadotropin caused a major increase in PRL release. Notably, progesterone inhibits PRL secretion from myometrial explants (220), as opposed to its stimulatory effect on the adjacent decidualized endometrial cells (221). Similarly, ET-1 is a potent inhibitor of dPRL (222), whereas ET-3 increases myometrial PRL release (221).\n\n2. PRL release from lymphocytes and adipocytes.\n\nPRL is produced by many human lymphohematopoietic cells, including thymocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes (mainly T lymphocytes), and mononuclear cells (reviewed in Refs. 223 and 224). Because PRL release from primary human lymphocytes is very low, most of its characterization has been done at the transcriptional level. PRL expression in T lymphocytes is stimulated by cAMP analogs; inhibited by IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-4; and unaffected by IL-10, IFN-γ, or TNF-α (225, 226). Several cell lines, e.g., the B-lymphoblastoid IM-9-P3, the eosinophilic Eol-1, the Burkitt lymphoma sfRamos, and the T-leukemic Jurkat, produce sufficient PRL to be detected by Western blotting or bioassays (227). PRL production is stimulated by cAMP activators and prostaglandin E2 and is suppressed by glucocorticoids and some ILs (227, 228). The general consensus is that PRL transcription in rodent immune cells is absent, weak, or transient (reviewed in Ref. 223).\n\nPRL production in human adipose tissue was discovered upon studying cultured human breast tissue that was separated into adipose and glandular explants. Intended to be used as a negative control, breast adipose explants were unexpectedly found to release 10–15 times more PRL than their glandular counterparts (reviewed in Ref. 229). PRL release from adipose explants progressively increased up to 7–10 d in culture, suggesting removal from inhibition. Whereas PRL release from glandular explants was suppressed by progesterone, neither estrogen nor progesterone altered PRL release from adipose explants (44). This, again, shows dissimilar regulation of PRL in two adjacent tissues. Other fat depots also secrete PRL, with its release in vitro influenced by the state of obesity of the donors (229). PRL release from both visceral and sc explants from nonobese patients showed time-dependent rise, whereas that from sc explants of morbidly obese patients was attenuated, indicating depot-specific control of PRL production during obesity.\n\nBoth preadipocytes and mature adipocytes produce PRL. PRL release from isolated breast preadipocytes is rather low but is stimulated by cAMP-elevating agents such as IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor; isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic receptor agonist; and PACAP (42). To identify the signaling pathways involved, preadipocytes were incubated with the above ligands in the presence of PKA, PI3K, or MEK inhibitors. All inhibitors blocked isoproterenol-stimulated PRL release, whereas the PKA inhibitor did not affect stimulation by PACAP. These data indicate that PRL production in preadipocytes is stimulated by catecholamines and other cAMP activators via several signaling pathways. PRL expression is undetectable in adipose tissue from rats, mice, or the 3T3-L1 and 3T3–442A murine preadipocyte cell lines, confirming the notion that adipose-derived PRL is unique to humans.\n\nTo facilitate further studies on PRL in adipose tissue, we sought a source of human adipocytes meeting the following criteria: immortality, inducible terminal differentiation, PRL release, and PRL response. To this end, we developed a spontaneously immortalized adipocyte cell line, named LS14, from a patient with metastatic liposarcoma (230). LS14 cells can be induced to undergo terminal differentiation and become lipid-storing and adipokine-releasing mature adipocytes. The pattern of expression of most adipose-specific genes is similar in LS14 cells and visceral adipocytes (Fig. 6). Like primary adipocytes, LS14 cells also produce and respond to PRL. PRL expression and release in both primary cells and LS14 cells increases during adipogenesis. Incubation of LS14 cells with exogenous PRL caused dose-dependent inhibition of IL-6 (230). This cell line should be instrumental in the characterization of the control of PRL expression/release in adipocytes as well as its local functions.\n\nSynopsis.\n\nRats continue to provide indispensable information on the neuroendocrine regulation of PRL release for two reasons: the inaccessibility of the human brain to experimentation, and the lack of a human lactotroph cell line. Indeed, practically all the hypothalamic releasing/inhibiting factors have been discovered in the rat brain. The dissimilarity between the species includes a more complex dopaminergic system in rats than in humans and a lesser impact of both estrogens and PRFs on pituitary PRL release in humans. The regulation of extrapituitary PRL release can be studied only in human cells and tissues, and there are no acceptable rodent models.\n\nVI. PRL Functions: Reproduction\n\nAmong the many functions ascribed to PRL, its involvement with reproduction has been best characterized. Reproductive fecundity depends on coordinated functions of organs and glands along the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal-reproductive tract axis. Production of viable offspring requires timely generation and delivery of functional gametes, successful fertilization and implantation, pregnancy that supports optimal fetal development, well-timed parturition, and provision of milk for neonatal nutrition. Although reproductive success is not essential for the individual, it is crucial for survival of the species. To this end, each species has evolved different patterns of reproductive cycles, sexual behavior, as well as length of gestation and lactation that are best suited for its social structure and living environment. Being an adaptive hormone, PRL fulfills few critical, but mostly modulatory, roles in reproductive processes.\n\nA. Reproductive cycles\n\nIn rodents, PRL is essential for the support of the CL (luteotropic action) which promotes progesterone production and the maintenance of gestation. The situation in humans is different. PRL is not luteotropic in humans and, with the exception of lactation, does not have clear effects on most reproductive processes under normal conditions. However, hyperprolactinemia in both men or women can lead to infertility, impotence or other reproductive disturbances, suggesting that PRL contributes, perhaps in a more subtle manner, to optimal reproduction in humans. Here, we focus on three phases of reproduction: the reproductive cycle, pregnancy/fetal development, and lactation. PRL release and functions at these times have been primarily studied in the rat. Transgenic mice deficient in PRL or its receptor have yielded mostly predictable, but sometimes unexpected, observations. Information on PRL in humans is adequate in some respects but fragmentary in others.\n\n1. Estrous cycle.\n\nThe rat reproductive cycle consists of 4 d: proestrus, estrus, diestrus 1, and diestrus 2. These are characterized by temporal changes in the release of three pituitary hormones, LH, FSH, and PRL, and two ovarian hormones, estrogen and progesterone. Serum PRL levels are low during most of the cycle except for the afternoon of proestrus, when a PRL surge coincides with the preovulatory LH surge (reviewed in Refs. 144 and 231). Unlike the sharp and symmetrical LH surge, the PRL rise is triphasic, consisting of a sharp peak, a plateau, and a termination phase (Fig. 7). The PRL surge is driven by the rising estrogen levels in the morning of proestrus. Estrogen action is coupled to a circadian timing mechanism, involves interactions with all three dopaminergic systems, and requires an input from hypothalamic and posterior pituitary PRL releasing/regulating hormones.\n\nBefore ovulation, estrogen is produced by the granulosa cells of follicles, stimulated to grow by FSH. After ovulation, the granulosa cells become luteinized, and each follicle is transformed into a morphologically and functionally distinct structure, the CL. Rodents have four types of CL: those of the cycle, pseudopregnancy, pregnancy, and lactation, which differ in life span and steroidogenic output (reviewed in Ref. 232). If there is no mating, the CL must regress to enable the next ovulation cycle. Sterile mating or cervical stimulation activates a neuroendocrine reflex, which results in the CL of pseudopregnancy that last for 11–12 d. In the case of fertile mating, the life span of the CL is extended to the end of gestation, ensuring continuous supply of progesterone. Ovulation after parturition generates CL that exist during lactation.\n\nThe only well-established function of the proestrus PRL surge is luteolysis of CL of the cycle (233). The PRL surge induces a wave of apoptosis that is prevented by treatment with bromocriptine. Signs of structural luteolysis are seen already in the morning of estrus, but complete demise of the CL takes two to three cycles. PRL does not exert luteolytic actions on CL of pseudopregnancy or pregnancy, presumably because they are protected by an altered state of differentiation (233). It is puzzling how PRL acts in an opposite manner, i.e., proapoptotic vs. antiapoptotic, on seemingly the same structures. CL regression occurs via several forms of cell death, i.e., apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy that involve steroid-producing cells, endothelial cells, as well as infiltrating monocytes/macrophages (reviewed in Ref. 232).\n\nThe presence of PRL in follicular fluid from several species raised the odds that PRL is involved in follicular growth, oocyte maturation, and/or ovulation (234). This notion is not supported by studies with PRLR-null mice, which exhibit normal cyclicity, ovulation rate, and fertilization (235). Although their ovaries contain all stages of follicular development, including Graafian follicles and CL, both the morphology and function of their CL are dramatically altered. Within 2 d after mating, the CL of PRLR−/− mice show accelerated regression with almost no vascularization. The major functional defect is premature expression of 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20αHSD), which catabolizes progesterone. Thus, despite having normal ovulation and fertilization, PRLR-null females are sterile due to failure of embryo implantation, which can be rescued by progesterone replacement (235). Mice deficient in PRL have a similar phenotype, but also show some irregular estrous cycles (236).\n\n2. Menstrual cycle.\n\nSerum hormone profile during the human menstrual cycle is divided into three phases: follicular, ovulatory, and luteal (Fig. 7). The follicular phase is dominated by FSH and the rising estrogen levels. The short ovulatory phase is dominated by a large LH surge and a smaller surge of FSH. The luteal phase is dominated by estrogen and progesterone, both of which are produced by the CL. Overall, the 28-d human menstrual cycle and the compressed 4-d rodent estrous cycle are similar in their hormonal profiles. The major exception is PRL, whose circulating levels are unchanged throughout the human menstrual cycle (237), in sharp contrast to the preovulatory PRL surge that typifies the rodent estrous cycle.\n\nThe absence of a midcycle rise in PRL in humans does not negate the possibility that PRL affects ovarian functions. The human ovary produces its own PRL, whose expression is higher in premenopausal than postmenopausal ovaries (238). PRL is also found in human follicular fluid (239), with high PRL levels correlating with successful pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (240). PRLR expression is detected in aspirated luteinized human granulosa cells but not in small follicles (241). A recent study reported that PRL is a survival factor against ceramide-induced apoptosis in human granulosa cells (242). Unfortunately, there is no information on PRLR expression in the human CL. Collectively, these observations suggest potential autocrine/paracrine roles for PRL within the human ovary at the time of ovulation or beyond.\n\nHyperprolactinemia is often associated with amenorrhea, anovulation, reduced libido, and orgasmic dysfunction in women. Up to 20% of secondary amenorrhea in women is attributed to elevated PRL (reviewed in Refs. 173 ,243 , and 244). The most probable mechanism by which high serum PRL induces menstrual abnormalities is via inhibition of GnRH production and/or pulsatility by a PRL-induced increased dopaminergic tone. However, loss of positive estrogen feedback on gonadotropin secretion and interference by PRL with follicular development and/or progesterone production have also been proposed. Chronic drug-induced hyperprolactinemia in rats (245) or in D2R-deficient mice (160) results in some estrous cycle irregularities but no major effect on fertility, indicating that rodents are not suitable models for hyperprolactinemia-related infertility in women. In men, elevated PRL induces hypogonadism, reduces pulsatile GnRH secretion, lowers testosterone levels, and causes erectile dysfunction (246).\n\nB. Pregnancy and fetal development\n\nPregnancy is characterized by a coordinated release and overlapping functions between PRL and placental lactogens. The shift between pituitary predominance to placental control over lactogenic hormone production occurs at variable degrees and at different times during rodent and human gestation. The relative importance of lactogenic hormones in the maintenance of pregnancy, e.g., the support of progesterone production, also differs between these species.\n\n1. Rodent pregnancy.\n\nThe first 10–12 d of the rat pregnancy are dominated by daily nocturnal and diurnal PRL surges. These are initiated by cervical stimulation at mating and are essential for CL maintenance in early pregnancy (Fig. 7). Termination of these surges coincides with a short rise of PL-I, which peaks on d 10–12 and subsides by d 13. PL-I is then replaced by PL-II, which rises progressively to the end of gestation (reviewed in Ref. 1). The PL increase the activity of the hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons, resulting in the suppression of maternal pituitary PRL release during the second half of pregnancy. Immediately before parturition, an increased estrogen/progesterone ratio caused by CL luteolysis, triggers a large PRL surge. Estrogen, unopposed by progesterone, causes opioid-mediated inhibition of TIDA neuronal activity and increased PRF activity from the neurointermediate lobe (reviewed in Ref. 154). This antepartum PRL surge plays a dual role: it participates in the final maturation of the mammary gland in preparation for lactation, and it affects the onset of maternal behavior (247).\n\nBoth PRL and PL bind to ovarian PRLR, whose expression is enhanced during luteinization. The short PRLR isoform increases more robustly than the long isoform. Both isoforms are reduced toward the end of gestation, underlying the loss of CL responsiveness to PRL or PL (reviewed in Ref. 232). Although Stat 5a and 5b have a 95% sequence homology, Stat 5b is responsible for maintaining the CL of pregnancy and progesterone production in rodents. The actions of PRL/PL on the CL of pregnancy are multifaceted, with PRL playing a mandatory role in progesterone production and a permissive role in estradiol production and actions, as well as in the vascularization and survival of the CL.\n\nAs reviewed by Gibori and colleagues (232, 248), the most established action of PRL/PL on the CL of pregnancy is prevention of progesterone catabolism via suppression of 20αHSD. However, PRL also stimulates progesterone production by enhancing uptake and intracellular transport of cholesterol, and by stimulating expression of two steroidogenic enzymes: P450 side chain cleavage (P450 sec), and 3βHSD, which catalyzes conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. The permissive effects of PRL on estrogen production include increased LH receptor expression, increased P450 aromatase, and activation of 17βHSD, which controls the final step in estradiol biosynthesis. Activation of 17βHSD, also named PRAP (PRLR-associated protein), is mediated by the short PRLR isoform. PRL also increases ERα and ERβ transcription via Stat5 response elements located within their promoters. ERα is regulated by Stat5a or Stat5b, whereas only Stat5b stimulates ERβ (249).\n\nDuring early pregnancy, the rat decidua also expresses and secretes PRL (5), which acts locally to stimulate ERα and ERβ expression and inhibits decidual IL-6 and 20αHSD, both of which are essential for fetal survival (reviewed in Ref. 248). Because at this time the uteroplacental unit produces many PL and PRL-like proteins, it is difficult to assign a specific role to local PRL. The relative roles of PRL and PL in sustaining pregnancy in mice are illustrated by comparing pregnancy in PRLR- and PRL-deficient animals (reviewed in Ref. 250). In PRLR−/− mice, progesterone treatment can overcome the failure of embryo implantation but cannot sustain fetal growth beyond midterm. In contrast, progesterone supplementation in PRL−/− animals results in some embryos that survive to term. This indicates that PL, which can act in PRL-deficient mice, but not in PRLR-deficient mice, mimics the actions of PRL by activating the PRLR.\n\n2. Human pregnancy.\n\nThe profile of PRL release during human pregnancy is entirely different from that in rodents (Fig. 7). It involves three independently regulated compartments: maternal, fetal, and decidual (reviewed in Refs. 8 ,35 ,251 , and 252). Maternal serum PRL levels start rising at 6–8 wk gestation and progressively increase to reach 200–300 ng/ml at term. Concurrently, the pituitary gland enlarges due to increases in lactotroph size and number. Indirect evidence suggests that increased PRL release and lactotroph hyperplasia are driven by estrogens, which presumably suppress hypothalamic dopamine and stimulate lactotroph proliferation. If so, it raises the question as to the mechanism by which the estrogen-insensitive hypothalamo-pituitary axis during the menstrual cycle becomes sensitive to estrogen during pregnancy.\n\nPRL begins to rise in the fetal circulation at 20–24 wk and increases steeply from wk 30 to term, when it reaches levels similar to maternal serum PRL. This PRL rise is fetal autonomous because there is no evidence for PRL transfer from mother to fetus and vice versa. Unique to humans, the decidua produces very large amounts of PRL, which accumulates in the amniotic fluid, attaining peak levels as high as 4000–5000 ng/ml between 16–22 wk gestation and reducing to 400–500 ng/ml at term (216). Despite such profound changes in PRL in the fetal compartment, there is little knowledge of its importance in human fetal physiology.\n\nHuman and rodent CL differ in number, morphology, steroidogenic output, and regulation. Normally, one follicle ovulates in humans, compared with the multiple CL in each ovulation in rodents. Histologically, the human CL is composed of two distinct luteal cell types, large and small, and it also contains a larger number of fibroblasts, endothelial, and immune cells than rodent CL (for review, see Refs. 253 and 254). In addition to progesterone synthesis by both luteal cell types, the human CL produces both androgens and estrogens, with the small luteal cells providing androgenic precursors and the large cells synthesizing most of the estrogen.\n\nThere is no evidence that PRL is luteotropic in the human CL. Instead, pituitary LH supports luteal development and steroidogenesis during the menstrual cycle. Luteolysis of the CL toward the end of the cycle is attributed to the action of local factors. After implantation, human chorionic gonadotropin, produced by the developing placenta, rescues the CL from regression and extends its functional life span in early pregnancy. From midpregnancy to term, steroidogenesis is primarily carried out by the fetoplacental unit rather than the CL (reviewed in Ref. 254). The fate and secretory activity of the CL during the later part of pregnancy are not clear. Given the absence of midcycle rise in PRL and its increase in the maternal serum only after the first trimester, very little attention has been given to potential roles of PRL in CL functions. Yet, both PRL and the PRLR are expressed in the luteinized human ovary (238, 241), with PRL acting as a survival factor in granulosa cells (242). This raises the possibility that local PRL affects CL development or maintenance in humans.\n\nWhereas much is known about PRL production by the human decidua, little is known about the exact functions of decidual or amniotic fluid PRL (reviewed in Refs. 35 ,36 , and 217). PRL is a major protein synthesized and secreted during decidualization, and its expression is detectable in the endometrium during the mid to late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle and persists throughout decidualization, implantation, and midpregnancy. It is assumed that dPRL acts locally as a paracrine/autocrine agent, and also serves as the source of amniotic fluid PRL. Whether some dPRL also escapes into the maternal circulation is unclear.\n\nThe expression of several PRLR isoforms in the human endometrium is temporally correlated with that of PRL. Unlike PRL, the receptors are localized not only to the decidua but also to the chorionic cytotrophoblast, amniotic epithelium, and syncytiotrophoblast (255). Several functions have been ascribed to dPRL, including facilitation of trophoblast adhesion, invasion and growth, regulation of angiogenesis, modulation of uterine natural killer cell survival, inhibition of myometrial contractility, and prevention of immunological rejection of the conceptus (217). Amniotic fluid PRL has been implicated in osmotic regulation and electrolyte transport across the amnion, prostaglandin production, formation of polyhydramnios, and complications of gestational diabetes and fetal lung development. Nonetheless, definitive evidence for all of these functions is lacking.\n\nThe human uteroplacental unit also secretes placental lactogens and GH, which possess lactogenic and somatotropic properties (reviewed in Ref. 35). hPL is first detected in the maternal circulation at 6 wk gestation and increases until wk 30, when it exceeds serum levels of both PRL and GH of pituitary origin by 10-fold. hPL contributes to the metabolic adaptation of the mother to pregnancy, thereby compensating for pituitary GH, which is suppressed during the second half of pregnancy. hPL increases food intake, stimulates glucose uptake, increases insulin secretion, and alters insulin sensitivity. It also affects lipid metabolism by increasing lipolysis and facilitating mobilization and utilization of maternal free fatty acids (256). The concomitant rise in maternal pituitary PRL and PL release during pregnancy is enigmatic. Unlike rodents, where PL shuts down pituitary PRL release, this does not occur in humans, suggesting reduced sensitivity of the hypothalamic dopaminergic system to negative feedback by PRL/PL during human pregnancy.\n\n3. Fetal development.\n\nPRL transcripts are first detected in the fetal pituitary on embryonic d 17 in the mouse (257), d 18 in the rat (258), and at 12–15 wk gestation in the human (259). The human fetal pituitary PRL content increases 50-fold from midpregnancy to term and is accompanied by a steep rise in PRL in the fetal circulation (260). It is unknown whether the fetal pituitary expresses functional dopamine receptors during intrauterine life, but it can respond to dopaminergic inhibition during the perinatal period.
