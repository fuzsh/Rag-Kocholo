        "text": "Rebecca comes to Preemptive Love with two decades of international experience in peace building with Search for Common Ground, primarily focused in Africa. She is particularly motivated by how frequently less heard voices—women, young people, ethnic and religious minorities—can become leaders and actors for peace and positive change in their communities, countries, and the world. She’s recently relocated to Maryland from Rwanda, and is enjoying getting reacquainted with the United States as home. She spends her free time connecting with friends, reading, and trying to keep her two children busy.\n\nMaritza has spent the last twenty years working with non-profit causes that align with her vision of a world that honors and supports every member of our human family and our natural environment. She has dedicated her career and board service to immigrant rights and advocacy, social justice, global poverty, reproductive rights, youth mobilization and leadership development, and international peacemaking work. She is currently based out of Houston, Texas but spends a considerable amount of her time traveling this big, beautiful world. Outside of work, you can find her practicing Baptiste Yoga, exploring hidden culinary gems, and leading social justice and antiracism workshops.\n\nJeff brings over 25 years of experience in managing projects, programs, people, and development teams in financial, mortgage, tax, CRM/loyalty and transportation industries.

Originally from Colorado, Jeff calls Texas home.

Beyond work Kara enjoys swimming, traveling, reading, paddle boarding, and photography.\n\nDanelia was born and raised in Honduras and was taught at an early age the importance of helping others. She brings over 9 years of experience in a variety of HR areas. Daniela loves meeting new people and creating long-standing relationships with them.

She has a Bachelor’s in Psychology and a Master’s in Accounting from Indiana University. Outside of work, you can find Michelle spending time with her family and friends, reading a book, or planning her next trip to see more of this complex and beautiful world.\n\nLiving through four wars and surviving the last war alone as her family fled Iraq to find safe heaven created the pacifist that Sarah is today. She spent the past 17 years of her life on the peacemaking path trying to provide for, protect, and help the persecuted minorities in the Middle East, while trying to build bridges between all the different religious groups and communities. Sarah has focused all her efforts in the past few years on youth and educational development and women empowerment through reaching out and looking for talented young people and push to create a chance for them, providing lecturing and workshop to those who have no access, and creating jobs and business ideas to change the economical and employment scene in Iraq. Sarah tries to lead by example to change the cultural religious perception of women, youth, and general ethics.\n\nShe was awarded in 2016 the Peace and Reconciliation Prize at the House of Lords in London and in 2017 the Tanenbaum Peace in Action Prize (the first Iraqi to ever have the price and the youngest to have ever gotten it).\n\nFaitth Brooks is an anti-racism educator, speaker, writer, and podcaster. Faitth believes in creating spaces that promote healthy dialogue and discussion amongst people across social and political divides.

His favorite items in our store are the Kinsman Lemongrass and Sisterhood Fig & Date Soaps. Outside of work, Nathan loves cooking new recipes, reading a good book, pop culture, and all things Star Wars.\n\nWendy joined Preemptive Love with 17 years of experience in housing and community development. With her passion for storytelling, she enjoys writing about the lives of people in the conflict zones we serve, and helping the rest of the world see not only their urgent needs, but also their amazing beauty and significance to our global family.\n\nLeigh has been with Preemptive Love from its earliest days, first as a volunteer, and later on staff with our finance team. When she started, Preemptive Love was a small group who loved well, and invested all of themselves to make sure that Iraqi children born with heart defects–much like her own son–got lifesaving surgeries. Leigh was part of the pivot to respond to the wave of violence unleashed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and has continued on through our work responding to the effects of violence throughout Latin America. Her compassion, consistency, and attention to detail makes the whole organization better.\n\nAfter graduating as an Environmental Engineer, Saadia worked for the government to ensure compliance of landfills and power generation facilities. She took a pause to raise her family and volunteer for several non-profits, ultimately discovering herself by being an active, responsible citizen in her hometown of Oviedo, Florida. Saadia believes meaningful friendships can be found in unexpected places. Her work to show neighbors how similar we are regardless of ethnic or religious differences led her to Preemptive Love. As a Gathering Coordinator, Saadia hopes to spread this message to communities nationwide. If she’s not participating at an event around town, you may find Saadia picking up after her two girls, reminding her husband where he left his wallet, or saving the last three bananas for her famous banana bread.\n\nLana saw Preemptive Love’s work first-hand when she, along with her family members, volunteered to bring food to children that Preemptive Love was providing heart surgeries for in Iraqi Kurdistan. She has volunteered with various NGOs since middle school, developing a passion to serve others in need of help no matter where they are. Right after graduating from Lipscomb University in Nashville, she immediately began working alongside Preemptive Love to connect with our kind-hearted and inspirational donors. Lana loves to utilize her international business skills to also help our volunteers get creative with their fundraisers and become leaders in their community. Because of her love for people and culture, Lana’s always trying to learn a new language that will help her connect with people from across the globe, and she absolutely loves to listen to music in different languages (especially Korean-pop).\n\nHawar was born in Kurdistan, Iraq.

You can find Kalindi on her mountain bike, reading, writing poetry, chugging insane amounts of coffee, watching telenovelas, and serving as an encouraging friend to all.\n\nAfnan was born in Saudi Arabia after her parents fled the civil war in Somalia.

He is a journalist by trade, and covered hard news stories for seventeen years, through audiovisual media, print and digital newspapers.

For Ronal, faith and family are cornerstones of his life. He’s a teacher and drummer in his local church. He also loves to enjoy a sunrise on the beach with his wife.\n\nJoyce has been a technical guru for over 20 years, and loves the challenge of tech.

Recently, she worked as a Consultant for the past 8 years, and previously was an IT Manager at Planned Parenthood of South Central Michigan. Joyce is a warrior for social justice and anti-racism.\n\nJulia first learned about the work of Preemptive Love in 2014 as the Syrian Civil War was displacing thousands of families from their homes. Passionate about learning from the world around her, she is finishing her degree in International Affairs and continues to stay curious about why systems that work for some people, don’t benefit all people. Julia has experience working with community organizing and enjoys getting to know her neighbors better.
