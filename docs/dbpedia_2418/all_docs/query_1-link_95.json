Chambers1, Lisa Simpson2\n\n1National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA; 2AcademyHealth, Washington, DC, USA\n\nAs we reemerge from the acute phase of the COVID pandemic, top of mind is how best to rebuild our health systems to maximize effectiveness, efficiency, and equity, and what lessons we can learn moving forward. How can we be more proactive to better anticipate challenges and more rapidly overcome them? How can we be more nimble to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances and evidence? How can we be more responsive to the diverse needs of our communities to ensure equity? These significant challenges for the field framed the theme of the 15th Annual Conference on the Science of Dissemination and Implementation in Health: (Re)Building Better Systems: Being Proactive, Nimble, and Responsive.\n\nCo-hosted by the National Institutes of Health and AcademyHealth in collaboration with our co-sponsors, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the conference brought together nearly 1400 researchers, practitioners, and other partners from around the world on December 11-14, 2022, in Washington, DC. Participants included 150 trainees, 8 patient scholarship recipients, and 31 participants from 13 low- and middle-income countries, including in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, South and Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. As we continue to enhance the diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) of the D&I Science community, we offered for the first time DEIA travel scholarships to 35 US-based participants, as well as travel scholarships to an additional 14 participants based in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nThe conference kicked off with an opening keynote from Dr. Kathleen Hall Jamieson on minimizing public susceptibility to misinformation and its impact on behavior and health. Drawing on Annenberg Public Policy Center research on health communication, Dr. Jamieson discussed ways to increase the likelihood that the public understands, accepts, and acts on the best available knowledge to support healthful decision-making and access to effective care. She outlined three key steps: 1) using consequential protective knowledge; 2) capsulizing language; and 3) reaching audiences in need. Consequential knowledge increases the likelihood of science-consistent behavior, can be identified, and minimizes susceptibility to misconception or deception. Dr. Hall Jamieson reviewed the complexity of terms related to infection in the COVID era and how our communication strategies fell short. For example, in a nationwide poll on the meaning of “m” in mRNA (when referring to the COVID19 vaccine) only 37 percent of respondents appropriately selected “messenger”.\n\nIn the plenary keynote on day two, Dr. Olugbenga Ogedegbe highlighted the need for “transcending limits and boundaries” of D&I science to improve health equity, exploring examples from research in low-income countries as well as low-resource settings in the United States. Two subsequent plenary panels focused on the importance of inclusion of diverse partner perspectives in D&I science and data systems to guide the next generation of studies. The former panel discussed front-line priorities and guidance, including the importance of building trust and engaging partners, to more effectively build better health and proactive, nimble, and responsive public health, healthcare and community systems. The latter panel explored issues around data systems and data sharing to enable understanding of ongoing implementation efforts and help focus our efforts to optimize access, quality, efficiency, and health outcomes at a population level. Both panels reflected on the many ways that an intentional focus on health equity and engagement is needed to improve care delivery and data systems.\n\nTo mark the 15th anniversary of this event and the first in-person gathering of the community, the entire audience engaged in an interactive plenary to highlight the accomplishments of the field to date, prioritize challenges, and set goals for the next fifteen. Key themes that emerged included successes in raising awareness about the field, training our D&I science workforce, developing and iterating frameworks, advancing methods, and integrating an equity perspective.\n\nThe conference also included concurrent podium and poster sessions, workshops, discussion forums, and multiple networking events. For the first time, workshop proposals were solicited through the call for abstracts, yielding 24 submissions and resulting in five half-day pre-conference workshops. Additionally, the call for abstracts generated 887 submissions (an increase of 217 (32%) over last year), including individual paper presentations, individual posters, and panel presentations spread across nine thematic tracks: Behavioral Health, Clinical Care Settings (separated into two tracks: Patient-Level Interventions and System-Level Interventions), Global Dissemination and Implementation Science, Promoting Health Equity and Eliminating Disparities, Health Policy Dissemination and Implementation Science, Prevention and Public Health, and Models, Measures and Methods, and Building the Future of D & I Science: Training, Infrastructure, and Emerging Research Areas. As in prior years, the tracks with the greatest number of submissions were Clinical Care Settings: System-Level Interventions (23%) and Models, Measures, Methods (16%). Across the 8 years of the conference being organized by thematic tracks, we find that the field has increasingly focused on Promoting Health Equity and Eliminating Disparities and Building the Future, each of which had the largest increase in the proportion of submissions (125% and 111%, respectively). This supplement is organized by those tracks and includes 168 abstracts from the concurrent paper and panel sessions, which represents a variety of dissemination and implementation research funded by our conference sponsors as well as other agencies, organizations, and systems. The additional 586 abstracts from the poster sessions are not included here but can be viewed at https://academyhealth.confex.com/academyhealth/2022di/meetingapp.cgi/ModulePosterSessions/0.\n\nThe conference also featured a pre-recorded orientation with live Q&A, social musical gathering, yoga, fun run, meet the editors and experts sessions, ancillary meetings, and daily morning coffee chats with D&I experts facilitating open discussions about key priorities for the field. The networking sessions again were hugely popular and well attended, providing attendees with the opportunity to connect with the leaders in the field.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming attendees at the 16th Annual D&I Science conference this December 10-13 in Arlington, VA at the Crystal Gateway Marriott.\n\nBehavioral Health\n\nS1 Moderators of implementation strategy effectiveness to support cbt delivery at michigan high schools: results from the adaptive school-based implementation of cbt (asic) clustered-smart\n\nShawna Smith1, Daniel Almirall2, Seo Youn Choi3, Elizabeth Koschmann4, Amy Rusch1, Emily Bilek4, Annalise Lane1, James Abelson4, Daniel Eisenberg5, Joeseph Himle3, Kate Fitzgerald6, Celeste Liebrecht3,4, Carolyn Andrews7, Amy Kilbourne4\n\n1University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 2University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 3University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 4University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 5UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA, USA; 6Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 7University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Shawna Smith (shawnana@med.umich.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S1\n\nBackground\n\nYouth mental health services are increasingly provided in schools. However, implementation of mental health evidence-based practices (EBPs) in schools remains deficient, in part due to heterogeneous barriers to school-based delivery of EBPs. While implementation strategies hold promise for addressing a variety of barriers, empirical knowledge as to which implementation strategies work best in which school settings remains lacking.\n\nMethods\n\nThe Adaptive School-based Implementation of CBT (ASIC) study recruited 94 Michigan high schools to compare the effects of different sequences of implementation strategies (including some that adapt based on ongoing need) on school professional (SP) delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions over the 55-week study. After the run-in phase, all schools were randomized to receive skills-based Coaching or not. After 8 weeks, schools in both arms that were deemed “slower-responders” were re-randomized to either add Facilitation to their current support or not. Longitudinal multilevel models examined whether the effects of Coaching or (among slower-responders) Facilitation were moderated by school-level variables, including SPs’ formal CBT training, pre-randomization CBT delivery, baseline perceptions of CBT, school administrator support, and/or barriers to CBT delivery.\n\nFindings\n\nOverall, SPs in Coaching arm (vs. no Coaching) reported 0.8 fewer CBT sessions per week; among slower-responders, those who received Facilitation (vs. no Facilitation) reported 1.1 more CBT sessions per week. Coaching improved delivery more in schools where fewer SPs had formal CBT training (bC*week*training=-.92 [CI=-1.57,-.28]), and SPs did not deliver CBT pre-randomization (bC*week*repCBT=-.94; CI=-1.37,-.50). Facilitation (among slower-responders) improved delivery more in schools where SPs reported on average 2+ barriers prior to second randomization (bF*week*barriers=1.10; CI=-.89, 3.10), positive perceptions of CBT (bF*week*perceptions=.11; CI=-.25,.46), and lower school administrator support (bF*week*support=-.36; CI=-.69,-.03).\n\nImplications for D&I Research\n\nSuccessfully scaling up implementation support for EBPs in schools requires understanding how contextual factors differentially affect implementation strategy effectiveness. Moderator analyses can inform how to target and tailor implementation strategy provision by understanding the conditions under which strategies are most effective. Here, Coaching worked best when SP prior experience with CBT was minimal, while Facilitation was most effective when clear organizational barriers were apparent. The findings can help guide deploying implementation strategies to best fit the local needs of schools.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health\n\nS2 Uncovering hypothesized mechanisms of action aimed to increase traumatic brain injury screening adoption in behavioral healthcare\n\nKathryn Hyzak, Uwe Wernekinck, Alicia Bunger\n\nThe Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Kathryn Hyzak (coxe.6@osu.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S2\n\nBackground: Implementation strategies that address barriers can accelerate the public health benefit of innovations in behavioral health settings, yet mechanisms of action that explain how strategies address these barriers remain unclear which limits our understanding of why implementation succeeds or fails. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC), this study advances implementation strategy selection and identifies mechanisms of action for increasing traumatic brain injury (TBI) screening adoption in behavioral health contexts.\n\nMethods: 20 licensed behavioral health providers in the U.S. (social workers, counselors, psychologists) participated in qualitative interviews about barriers to adopting TBI screening. Interview transcripts were managed in NVivo and co-coded using content analysis to identify barriers to TBI screening adoption and linked to CFIR domains and constructs. Next, using the CFIR/ERIC query tool, barriers were mapped to implementation strategies, and hypothesized mechanisms of action were identified based on census agreement between two coders.\n\nFindings: In CFIR's ‘Inner-Setting’ domain, barriers included poor leadership engagement, low priority, and lack of organizational incentives/rewards, which mapped to conducting local consensus discussions, informing local opinion leaders, and funding/contracting for TBI screening. These strategies target knowledge-acquisition, awareness-building, norms/social pressures, and motivations (mechanisms). In CFIR’s ‘Outer-Setting’ domain, lack of external policies/incentives mapped to involving executive boards, obtaining formal commitments, and mandating changes. These strategies target norms/social pressures (mechanism). In CFIR’s ‘Characteristics-of-Individuals,’ barriers included lack of knowledge and awareness about TBI and low self-efficacy to conduct TBI screening, which mapped to conducting educational meetings, distributing educational materials, shadowing other experts, and conducting ongoing training. These strategies target awareness-building, knowledge-acquisition, and skill-development (mechanisms). In CFIR’s ‘Process’ domain, lack of stakeholder engagement mapped to identifying/preparing champions. This strategy targets norms/social pressures (mechanism).\n\nImplications for D&I Research: This study advances implementation science by describing a systematic, data-driven approach to implementation strategy selection tailored to a TBI screening innovation implemented in behavioral healthcare contexts. This represents a fundamental step in the field where understanding of contextual determinants to TBI screening adoption can lead to more precise strategy selection, mechanism specification, and potential impact that can be tested in subsequent studies.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS3 Pay-for-performance is a financing strategy that improved implementation effectiveness: results from a 25-site cluster-randomized type 3 hybrid trial\n\nBryan Garner1, Stephen Tueller2, Michael Bradshaw2, Kathryn Speck3, Denna Vandersloot4, Derek Satre5, James Ford6, Mat Roosa7, Mark Zehner8, Jackie Mungo2, Sarah McDaniel2, Richa Ruwal2, Carla Rash9\n\n1The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA; 2RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA; 3University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA; 4University of Washington, Portland, OR, USA; 5University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; 6University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, WI, USA; 7Independen Consultant, Syracuse, NY, USA; 8University of Wisconsin, Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention, Madison, WI, USA; 9Univeristy of Connecticut, Farmington, CT, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Bryan Garner (bryan.garner@osumc.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S3\n\nBackground: Of high relevance to dissemination and implementation science is rigorous experimental research testing the effectiveness of strategies to improve the implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in real-world practice settings. As part of a dual-randomized type 2 hybrid trial, which included 39 HIV service organizations (HSOs) across the United States, 78 HSO staff, and 824 client participants with HIV and a substance use disorder (SUD), a motivational interviewing-based brief intervention (MIBI) was found to be effective. However, the MIBI was only effective when implemented within the organization-level implementation condition that provided HSOs with (1) the training, feedback, and consultation (TFC) control strategy (i.e., online/workshop training, fidelity feedback, consultation meetings with MIBI expert) and (2) the Implementation and Sustainment Facilitation (ISF) experimental Strategy (i.e., monthly 30-60 minute team-focused facilitation meetings via Zoom), relative to the TFC strategy. Building on this research and prior research supporting the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a financing strategy called pay-for-performance (P4P; providing conditional economic incentives for meeting/exceeding pre-defined level of performance), this presentation highlights the main finding from a cluster-randomized type 3 hybrid trial testing P4P as a strategy for improving MIBI implementation beyond the TFC+ISF Strategy.\n\nMethods: After obtaining institutional review board approval, 25 HSOs, as well as participating staff and clients, were cluster randomized to either the control strategy (TFC+ISF) or the experimental strategy (TFC+ISF+P4P). MIBI staff working at HSOs randomized to the experimental strategy had the opportunity to receive $10 USD per MIBI implemented, as well as $10 USD per MIBI implemented at or above the 80th percentile level of fidelity achieved as part of the dual-randomized type 2 hybrid trial. Guided by the Theory of Implementation Effectiveness, the primary implementation outcome measure was implementation effectiveness (i.e., the consistency and quality of MIBI implementation), a staff-level measure representing the standardized sum of the total number of MIBIs implemented and the total quality/fidelity scores.\n\nFindings: The P4P strategy had a medium-sized impact (d = .47) that significantly (p = .001) improved the level of implementation effectiveness achieved by HSO’s trained MIBI staff.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: P4P is a financing strategy that can improve implementation effectiveness.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS4 Economic evaluation of two implementation strategies for training college mental health providers in interpersonal psychotherapy: a cluster randomized trial\n\nRamesh Raghavan1, Ellen Fitzsimmons-Craft2, G. Terence Wilson3, W. Stewart Agras4, Denise Wilfley2\n\n1New York University, New York, NY, USA; 2Washington University in St. Louis, St Louis, MO, USA; 3Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA; 4Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Ramesh Raghavan (raghavan@nyu.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S4\n\nBackground: Depression and eating disorders are among the most common mental disorders observed among among college students; interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is an evidence-based treatment for these conditions. Identifying cost-effective approaches to implementing IPT in college counseling centers is necessary.\n\nMethods: We conducted a cluster randomized trial of two implementation strategies to train therapists in IPT at 24 college counseling centers. These centers were randomly assigned to either: (1) a strategy in which therapists were coached to train other staff to implement IPT (“train-the-trainer;” TTT, or experimental condition), or (2) a strategy comprising a workshop, therapy manual, and expert follow-up consultation (“expert consultation”). We used an activity-based costing survey and interviews to capture implementation costs at each site. IPT fidelity (adherence and competence) was assessed by auditing audio recordings of selected therapy sessions, and analyzed using linear mixed effects models.\n\nFindings: Out of a total of 184 therapists trained in this study, 95 were in the TTT condition. Each counseling center spent a mean of $8,194 in training and supervision costs to train their one trainer (range: $7,042-$10,078). These trainers then trained between 2 and 9 therapists at their centers in IPT. Across all 12 TTT sites, overall mean costs to produce one therapist in this study was $3,407 (median= $3,077). Mean costs to produce one trained therapist using the expert consultation strategy was $2,055 (median costs = $1,932). Therapists in both training groups showed improvements over time in both adherence and competence, with effect sizes in the large range. There was no statistically significant difference in the magnitude of improvement between the experimental and control conditions in the adherence outcome. However, on the competence outcome, therapists in the TTT condition had 0.073 higher scores on competence compared to controls (95% CI, 0.008-0.138; p = .03). Each 1 unit improvement in therapist competence scores requires an investment of $19,033 using a TTT strategy and $19,386 using an expert consultation strategy.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: The TTT implementation strategy is a fiscally sound approach for IPT training. Despite higher short run costs, it results in more competent therapists and permits training of new therapists within the site over time.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS5 Effects of the leadership and organizational change for implementation (LOCI) strategy on the implementation of digital measurement-based care in mental health clinics serving youth: A mechanistic analysis within a cluster RCT\n\nNate Williams1, Steven Marcus2, Mark Ehrhart3, Nallely Ramirez1, Kristine Carandang4, Marisa Sklar4, Lauren Brookman-Frazee5, Susan Esp1, Alexandra Wilson1, Gregory Aarons5\n\n1Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA; 2University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA; 3University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA; 4University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA; 5UC San Diego ACTRI Dissemination and Implementation Science Center, La Jolla, CA, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Nate Williams (natewilliams@boisestate.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S5\n\nBackground\n\nThe aims of this cluster randomized, hybrid Type III effectiveness-implementation trial were to: (1) test the main effects of the Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) strategy on implementation climate, clinician motivation, and clinician implementation of digital measurement-based care (MBC), and (2) test a theorized contextual-motivational mechanism underlying LOCI.\n\nMethods\n\nA total of 252 clinicians working in 21 outpatient mental health clinics in three states received training and technical assistance to implement a well-established digital MBC system. Clinics were randomly assigned to the 12-month LOCI strategy (n=11) or active control (leadership webinars) (n=10). Clinicians completed surveys assessing clinic implementation climate, intentions, and use of the digital MBC system during the 12-month LOCI intervention period and at 6-month follow-up (18-months post-baseline). Mixed effects regression models accounting for nesting of observations within clinicians and clinicians within clinics tested whether LOCI led to greater improvement in study variables over time. Multilevel mediation analysis tested whether LOCI’s effects on digital MBC implementation at 6-month follow-up were transmitted through a hypothesized contextual-motivational mechanism in which improved clinic implementation climate was theorized to increase clinician motivation which in turn was expected to increase implementation behavior.\n\nFindings\n\nIn main effects analyses, LOCI significantly improved clinic climate for digital MBC implementation by 4-months post-baseline and this effect was sustained through 6-month follow-up (18-months post-baseline). Clinician intentions to use the digital MBC system were significantly improved at 8- and 12-months post-baseline. Overall, clinician use of the digital MBC system was low throughout the study, likely influenced by the exigencies of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, LOCI significantly improved clinicians’ self-reported use of digital MBC by 8-months post-baseline and this effect was sustained through follow-up (18-months after baseline). Mediation analysis indicated LOCI’s effect on clinicians’ implementation behavior at 18-months was transmitted through improvement in climate at 4-months and improvement in clinician intentions at 12-months.\n\nImplications for D&I Research\n\nOrganizational leadership- and climate-focused strategies such as LOCI improve the implementation of digital health technologies by creating motivating clinic contexts that are robust even as healthcare systems face significant external shocks (i.e., the COVID pandemic).\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS6 Implementing chronic care treatment for tobacco cessation into community mental health care\n\nSandra Japuntich1, Sarah Helseth2, Melissa Adkins-Hempel3, Nathalia Gutierrez Sacasa4, Rebekah Pratt5, Steven Fu6, Jennifer Tidey7, A.

Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) have high tobacco use prevalence and tobacco-related mortality. Certified community behavioral health clinics (CBHC) provide care for people with SMI, yet delivery of tobacco cessation interventions is limited.\n\nMethods: We will present implementation outcomes from a type 2 hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial testing a chronic care tobacco cessation intervention delivered in a CBHC. The intervention was the US Public Health Service guideline 5As (Ask about tobacco use, Advise to quit, Assess interest, Assist with quitting, Arrange for follow-up). The implementation strategy was the New England ATTC’s multi-level “Science to Service Laboratory” model including a 2-hour virtual/synchronous training followed by 9 months of CBHC-wide performance feedback (i.e., chart documented tobacco treatment) and monthly coaching calls. Feasibility was assessed via medical record review and provider survey (from training attendees) at post-training, 6 and 12 months (data available 10/22).\n\nFindings: 76 CBHC clinicians attended didactic training. Coaching calls were provided monthly at team meetings; average attendance was 9.2 providers/call (22 calls). Post-training, clinician knowledge of and confidence in providing tobacco cessation treatment increased (ps <.05). At 6 months, clinicians reported increases in Advise and Assist behaviors (ps<.05), but not Assess or Arrange (Ask not collected). Medical record data evidenced high levels of Ask and Assess but low levels of Assist amongst providers (regardless of training attendance) with no changes over the reporting period. The organization implemented a tobacco use clinical reminder. Clinicians surveyed reported improvements in availability of tobacco cessation materials and referral processes 6 months post-trainings.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: A multi-level implementation strategy consisting of didactic training, performance feedback and coaching was feasible and demonstrated preliminary effectiveness in improving tobacco cessation services in CBHCs. Clinicians who attended the training demonstrated increases in knowledge, confidence, and 5As behaviors over the implementation period. In addition, providers reported improved systems to address tobacco use including medical record prompts, resources, and referral options. Regardless of training attendance, all CBHC clinicians demonstrated high levels of Asking and Assessing tobacco use, but lagged in assisting with tobacco cessation. This study provides preliminary evidence that clinicians at CHBCs can deliver effective tobacco treatment.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS7 Client experiences of an innovative mobile crisis model: qualitative evaluation of San Francisco’s street crisis response team\n\nRachel Odes1, Megan McDaniel2, Deepa Manjanatha2, Paige Lerman3, Siva Sundaram3, Janet Myers3, Matthew L. Goldman2,3\n\n1National Clinician Scholars Program, San Francisco, CA, USA; 2San Francisco Department of Public Health, San Francisco, CA, USA; 3University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Rachel Odes (Rachel.Odes@ucsf.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S7\n\nBackground: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) recommends including mobile crisis teams in the continuum of care to facilitate access to behavioral health services while reducing reliance on law enforcement to intervene crises that happen in public spaces. In 2020 San Francisco implemented the Street Crisis Response Team (SCRT), comprised of on-call clinicians, paramedics and peers who can provide specialized de-escalation, referral, and support services. The current study, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), describes clients’ experiences of SCRT encounters.\n\nMethods: This qualitative investigation is one arm of a mixed-methods evaluation of SCRT. We interviewed 20 adults who recently received SCRT services. Interviews were conducted during September 2021 – March 2022. Participant ages ranged from 27 to 64 years (mean=45). The sample was 75% male and was racially diverse: Black (45%), white (30%), Latino/a (20%), and Asian (5%). Semi-structured interviews lasted approximately one hour; questions were informed by CFIR domains. We used qualitative methods to code transcripts and thematic analysis to interpret findings.\n\nFindings: Clients described their needs/goals, including access to medical care, case management, and housing services, and pointed out that SCRT was one channel for attaining placements or referrals. Relative advantage was a key theme for SCRT clients, who frequently pointed out that SCRTs’ “gentle” approach made encounters preferable to those involving emergency medical providers or law enforcement. Within the inner setting, SCRT team members’ personal characteristics, including the availability of a peer counselor with experience of the mental health system, helped clients feel supported. SCRT encounters incorporating basic support like food and water provided an immediate, sensitive response to crisis, although underlying housing instability often remained.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: This study identified SCRT’s benefits for clients, but also described ways service needs of people experiencing homelessness are often more than what a mobile crisis program can provide. These findings are highly relevant to inform mobile crisis team implementation in communities seeking to improve access to behavioral health services. Stakeholders should look carefully at how program success is defined and incorporate clients’ goals.

We also interviewed PLF-T group facilitators and coordinator to identify adaptations to deliver PLF-T and learn about barriers and facilitators to implementation. A summary template and matrix analysis approach were used to analyze qualitative data.\n\nFindings: Group participants were mostly male (88%), age 50 (SD=15.6), ethnically diverse, and either divorced or separated (54%). Suicide symptoms upon study entry included past month ideation with methods (100%) and past year aborted, interrupted or actual suicide attempt (59%). Interviews revealed overall positive endorsement of PLF-telehealth with enhanced suicidal disclosure, improved ability to manage urges and mitigate loneliness. On scales from 1-20, PLF-T was rated as highly acceptable (M=17.50; SD=2.92), appropriate (M=17.25; SD=3.59), and feasible (M=18; SD=2.45). Adaptations to deliver PLF-T included using a communications coordinator to conduct assertive outreach to facilitate engagement, instituting a telehealth orientation session and restructuring sessions to review suicide severity and screen sharing safety plans to maximize learning. PLF-T enhanced convenience and access without compromising safety. Concerns included privacy, and technological limitations including connectivity. In conclusion, our findings suggest that suicide-specific safety planning group treatment is acceptable and feasible to deliver via telehealth.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: Information about barriers and facilitators implementing PLF-T with this small sample of high-risk Veterans provides an opportunity to develop implementation strategies to support future implementation and scale up of suicide safety planning group telehealth treatment. Strategies may include creating an easy-to-access repository for all intervention materials, evaluating criteria for enrollment into PLF-T based on access to technology, comfort in group therapy and with using technology and participating in groups online. Other strategies may include sharing best practices for telehealth and establishing a consortium of support for research and clinical programs navigating regulations and policies for telehealth treatment.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n\nS9 Peer recovery specialist-delivered, behavioral activation intervention to improve retention in methadone treatment: results from an open-label, type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot trial\n\nJessica Magidson1, Valerie Bradley1, Mary Kleinman1, Morgan Anvari2, Abigail Hines3, Annabelle Belcher4, Aaron Greenblatt4, Tolulope Abidogun3, Dwayne Dean3, Cj Seitz-Brown3, Michael Wagner2, Melanie Bennett4, Julia Felton5\n\n1University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA; 2University of Maryland, College Park, USA; 3University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA; 4University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA; 5Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Jessica Magidson (jmagidso@umd.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S9\n\nBackground: Despite the efficacy of medication treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), retention is an urgent priority, particularly among low-income, minoritized populations. Peer recovery specialists may be well-positioned to engage vulnerable patients in care, particularly when trained in an evidence-based intervention to promote retention. This Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot trial aimed to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of a peer recovery specialist-delivered behavioral activation approach (Peer Activate) to improve methadone retention.\n\nMethods: Implementation outcomes were feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity, guided by Proctor’s model for defining implementation outcomes. Feasibility and acceptability were defined by the percentage of participants who initiated the intervention (≥75%) and completed ≥75% of core sessions, respectively. We also used a validated quantitative measure of feasibility and acceptability—the Applied Mental Health Research (AMHR) assessment (0-3 scale; Haroz et al., 2019). Fidelity was assessed via independent rating of a randomly selected 20% of sessions. The primary effectiveness outcome was methadone retention at three-months post-intervention vs. a comparison cohort initiating methadone during the same time period. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included substance use frequency and related problems.\n\nFindings: Benchmarks for feasibility and acceptability were surpassed: 86.5% (32/37) initiated the intervention, and 81.3% of participants who initiated attended ≥75% of core sessions. The AMHR quantitative assessment indicated high levels of feasibility (M=2.04, SD=0.43) and acceptability (M=2.92, SD=0.19). The mean independent rater fidelity score was 87.9%, indicating high peer fidelity. For effectiveness outcomes, 88.6% of participants in Peer Activate were retained in methadone treatment at three-months post-intervention—28.9% more than individuals initiating methadone in the same time period [x2(1)=10.10, p=0.001]. There was a significant reduction in substance use frequency [t(25)=1.82, p=.041], and substance use-related problems [t(21)=1.84, p=0.040] among participants who completed the core Peer Activate sessions (n=26).\n\nImplications for D&I Research: Given the rapid scale-up of peer recovery specialist programs nationwide, these results, although preliminary, have important implications for how D&I research can support the implementation of evidence-based peer programs to support individuals with OUD. The next steps are to conduct a larger Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized trial with longer-term follow-ups to further establish the implementation and effectiveness of the Peer Activate approach.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS10 Implementing electronic measurement-based care in outpatient substance use disorder treatment settings\n\nMegan O'Grady1, Patricia Lincourt2, Shazia Hussain2, Vanessa Bobadilla3, Jacqualin Ross2, Sueun Hong3, Charles Neighbors4\n\n1University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA; 2NYS OASAS, Albany, USA; 3NYU Langone, New York, USA; 4New York University, New York, NY, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Megan O'Grady (ogrady@uchc.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S10\n\nBackground: Measurement-based care (MBC), routinely measuring and reviewing treatment progress with a standardized tool, can help inform clinical decision making. MBC has transformed mental health care, however the development and implementation of MBC for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment settings has been limited. While MBC measures for SUD treatment have recently been developed, putting them into user-friendly electronic formats and understanding their implementation is an existing knowledge gap. Study goals are to 1) describe user-centered development of an electronic version of the Treatment Progress Assessment-8 (eTPA8) for SUD care and 2) evaluate early implementation of the eTPA8.\n\nMethods: Iterative user-centered development of the eTPA8 used cognitive interviewing, usability testing, and focus groups with SUD treatment clients and staff. The eTPA8 has been implemented in outpatient SUD clinics using an external practice facilitation approach guided by the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework as part of a larger stepped-wedge trial. Semi-structured interviews (n = 35) with SUD program staff in 14 outpatient treatment clinics evaluated early eTPA8 implementation. Interviews were analyzed using conventional content analysis. The four core i-PARIHS constructs (Facilitation, Innovation, Context, and Recipients) are used to organize results.\n\nFindings: Overall, SUD program staff find the eTPA8 user-friendly. There is variation among staff in the perceived utility of the eTPA8, especially given competing demands and time constraints. Staff find the eTPA8 a clinically relevant tool and use it to support clinical interactions, but vary in embracing new technology and the overall MBC concept. The inner (e.g., leadership support and priorities) and outer contexts (e.g., COVID-19 and staff shortages) influence implementation and require flexibility by practice facilitators and implementation teams. External practice facilitators and clinic implementation champions are key implementation supports, particularly in addressing barriers.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: The eTPA8 is a promising MBC tool. It was viewed positively by SUD treatment programs, but requires intensive implementation supports (e.g., champions, facilitators) that are dynamic, proactive, and responsive. Findings have implications for guiding further development and refinement of responsive, theory-driven implementation strategies to support MBC in behavioral health settings. Future research should also investigate how MCB is sustained after initial implementation.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS11 The mental health and addiction treatment tracking repository: How big data on substance use disorder treatment facilities can inform implementation research, practice, and policy\n\nJonathan Cantor1, Alex Dopp1, Aaron Kofner2, Maria DeYoreo1, Mark Godley3, Bing Han4, Sarah Hunter5, Beau Kilmer5, Rosanna Smart1\n\n1RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA, USA; 2RAND Corporation, Arlington, VA, USA; 3Chestnut Health, Normal, USA; 4Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, USA; 5RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Jonathan Cantor (jcantor@rand.org)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S11\n\nBackground: The United States has faced a worsening drug overdose crisis. There is limited data on the supply of substance use disorder treatment (SUDT) facilities, especially regarding key details like use of evidence-based practices (EBP) (e.g., provision of medication for opioid use disorder [MOUD]) and financing mechanisms (e.g., Medicaid expansion). Well-organized data on licensed SUDT facilities are critical to informing policy and practice improvement efforts.\n\nMethods: We digitized records from the U.S. National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities between 1975 and 2022 to create the Mental health and Addiction Treatment Tracking Repository (MATTR). MATTR also includes daily downloads of the Behavioral Health Treatment Locator since 2019. We geocoded each dataset and linked the data across years. Each facility is assigned a unique identifier to track the opening, closing, and changes in populations served, accepted forms of payment, and treatment services over time. To illustrate how MATTR can inform implementation, we quantified changes in the offering of MOUD and acceptance of Medicaid between 2012 and 2021. We also quantified the number of new or closing facilities that reported offering MOUD or accepting Medicaid in each year.\n\nFindings: Between 2012 and 2021, the MATTR contained 27,699 unique SUDT facilities, with 14,581 openings and 14,073 closings. Rates of Medicaid acceptance increased from 2012 to 2021 (54.5% to 71.8%). There was a substantial increase in the rate of offering MOUD going from 22.1% to 51.2% between 2012 and 2021. In 2021, 54% of facilities that opened offered MOUD, and separately 66% accepted Medicaid as a form of payment. In 2020, 46% of the facilities that closed offered MOUD in the previous year, and 62.3% accepted Medicaid as a form of payment.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: The MATTR data offer, almost in real-time, surveillance information on SUDT facilities. These data can be used to target the implementation of EBP at specific facilities and guide efforts to understand the facilitators and barriers to offering these services. This unique combination of big data and implementation science can support implementation researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in determining where, when, and how to target supports for implementation and sustainment of SUDT EBP.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS12 Implementing interventions to connect parents involved in the child welfare system to substance use disorder treatment: geographic variations in implementation outcomes\n\nMary Finley1, Alicia Bunger1, Elinam Dellor1, Bridget Freisthler1, Fawn Gadel2, Jennifer Millisor2, Jen McClellan2, Kathryn Lancaster1, Marla Himmeger2\n\n1The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA; 2Public Children Services Association of Ohio, Columbus, OH, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Mary Finley (finley.232@buckeyemail.osu.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S12\n\nBackground: Rural and Appalachian communities with limited behavioral health resources and significant geographic barriers to care may struggle to implement and deliver interventions that improve behavioral health service access and outcomes. However, implementation outside of urban contexts has received limited empirical attention. This study compares fidelity and timeliness across urban, suburban, rural, and Appalachian public children services agencies (PCSAs) that are implementing Ohio START (Sobriety, Treatment, and Reducing Trauma), an intervention for families affected by caregiver substance use disorder (SUD) and child maltreatment.\n\nMethods: Preliminary data were drawn from administrative records of 556 caregivers with an open child welfare case and enrolled in Ohio START from forty PCSAs between March 2019 and January 2022. Fidelity was measured as the number of essential START components that caregivers received (SUD screening, family peer mentor visits, shared decision-making meetings, SUD treatment visits). Timeliness was measured as the number of days between the case opening date and each component. ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare fidelity and timeliness for caregivers from urban, suburban, rural, and Appalachian PCSAs.\n\nFindings: Fidelity to START was strong; on average, caregivers received 3.6 components and 66% received all 4. There were no geographic differences in fidelity to screening, family peer mentor visits, or shared decision-making meetings. However, fewer parents received treatment in Appalachian PCSAs (65.91%) compared to parents in rural (84.62%, Tukey HSD, p=.002) or suburban PCSAs (84.68%, Tukey HSD, p=.002). In terms of timeliness, caregivers from Appalachian PCSAs waited longer (22.6 days) to be screened than those in rural PCSAs (7.4 days) (H(3)=23.31, p=<.001). Caregivers from Appalachian PCSAs also waited longer to connect to substance use disorder treatment (on average 49 days) compared to those in rural (48.6 days) (H(3)=18.305, p= <.001, and suburban (46 days) PCSAs [X2 (3)=18.33,p=<.001] although this difference might be due to a few extreme cases in Appalachian PCSAs.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: Available resources and community context can shape implementation of interventions that promote behavioral health service access. Implementation strategies that support behavioral health service expansion and availability might be needed to optimize the public health benefit for Appalachian and other resource constrained communities.\n\nAcknowledgements: RWJF, NIDA, PCSAO\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\n\nS13 Advancing pharmacological treatments for opioid use disorder: outcomes of an implementation trial in eight veterans health administration facilities\n\nHildi Hagedorn1,2, Allison Gustavson1, Princess Ackland1, Ann Bangerter1, Mark Bounthavong3, Barbara Clothier1, Alex H.S.

However, facility-level provision of MOUD continues to be highly variable, requiring development and testing of implementation strategies that target low-performing facilities. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of external facilitation in increasing the provision of MOUD among low-performing VHA facilities.\n\nMethods: VHA facilities in the lowest quartile of MOUD provision (35 facilities) were identified. Eight of these facilities were randomly assigned to participate in the intervention with the remaining 27 facilities serving as matched controls. Intervention facilities participated in a 12-month external facilitation intervention which included assessment of local barriers/facilitators, formation of a local implementation team, a site visit for action planning and training/education, monthly coaching calls, quarterly cross-facility community of practice calls, and on-demand consultation. Outcome measures included pre- to post-change in: 1) facility-level ratio of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) receiving MOUD, and 2) the number of patients with OUD prescribed buprenorphine/naloxone, both compared to matched control facilities.\n\nFindings: Intervention facilities significantly increased the facility-level ratio of patients with OUD receiving MOUD from an average of 18% at baseline to 30% one-year later, with an absolute difference of 12% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 6.6%, 17.0%). The difference-in-differences between intervention and control facilities was 3.0% (95% CI: -0.2%. 6.7%). Intervention facilities significantly increased the number of patients prescribed buprenorphine/naloxone from pre- to post-implementation, with a mean increase of 41.8 new patients per facility (95% CI: 18.3, 61.0). The difference-in-differences between intervention and control facilities was 13.2 (95% CI: -4.8, 31.0). Sensitivity analysis excluding one outlier site demonstrated significantly greater changes in both outcome variables for the remaining seven intervention sites compared to their matched controls.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: Healthcare systems interested in increasing adoption of MOUD, or other evidence-based practices, may consider a tiered approach where less resource intensive interventions (e.g., education, training) are initially employed, followed by more resource intensive, context-specific interventions for facilities that do not respond to initial efforts.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n\nS14 Reach and equity of buprenorphine receipt following the stepped care for opioid use disorder train-the-trainer (scoutt) initiative in va primary care clinics\n\nEric Hawkins1,2, Carol Malte2, Brittany Blanchard4, Emily Williams1,3,5, Hildi Hagedorn6, Adam Gordon7, Andrew Saxon2\n\n1Center of Innovation for Veteran-Centered and Value-Driven Care, Seattle, WA, USA; 2VA Center of Excellence in Substance Addiction Treatment and Education, Seattle, WA, USA; 3VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle,WA, USA; 4University of Washington, Seattle, USA; 5VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Health Services Research & Development, Center of Innovation for Veteran-Centered & Value-Driven Care, Portland, OR; 6Center for Care Delivery & Outcomes Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA; 7VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Eric Hawkins (eric.hawkins@va.gov)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S14\n\nBackground\n\nBuprenorphine, a first-line medication treatment for OUD, reduces opioid overdose and mortality, and can be offered in primary care. However, it is underutilized and inequitably accessed across subgroups of patients with OUD. In 2018 the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) implemented the Stepped Care for Opioid Use Disorder Train-the-Trainer (SCOUTT) initiative to improve access to buprenorphine nationally in general healthcare clinics such as primary care, using a multifaceted implementation strategy. Healthcare inequalities are common and can persist or worsen, after implementation of innovative treatments. Therefore, we evaluated the reach and equity of buprenorphine receipt following the SCOUTT initiative.\n\nMethods\n\nThis prospective evaluation followed a cohort of patients with OUD seen in 17 VA primary care clinics in the year following August 2018. Main measures included Reach, defined as the proportion of patients seen in primary care with an OUD who received buprenorphine, and equitable reach of SCOUTT across social identity (age, sex, marital status, race, ethnicity, housing instability) and clinical characteristics (mental health, substance use, medical diagnoses) extracted from the heath record. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the likelihood of buprenorphine receipt as a function of different characteristics, adjusted for all other characteristics.\n\nFindings\n\nOverall, 2,495 patients with an OUD were seen in participating primary care clinics; 10.8% received buprenorphine in primary care clinics. Approximately, 73.0% of patients were >50 years old, 7.6% were women, and 32.1% were Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). In adjusted analyses, patients who received buprenorphine in primary care, compared to those who did not, were more likely to have housing instability (AOR=1.52, 95%CI: 1.06-2.17), sedative use disorder diagnosis (AOR=2.09, 95%CI: 1.24-3.52), any mental health diagnosis (AOR=1.54, 95%CI: 1.10-2.17), and past-year SUD specialty attendance (AOR=2.49, 95%CI: 1.73-3.59). Patients receiving buprenorphine were less likely to be BIPOC (AOR=0.61, 95%CI: 0.44-0.86) or have documented alcohol use disorder (AOR=0.33, 95%CI: 0.23-0.48), relative to those not receiving buprenorphine.\n\nImplications for D&I Research\n\nThe SCOUTT initiative was implemented equitably across most social identity and clinical subgroups. However, results highlight the importance of monitoring access discrepancies for racially minoritized Veterans and those with alcohol use disorder during implementation efforts.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n\nS15 Four years of external facilitation in the veterans health administration’s stepped care for opioid use disorder train the trainer (SCOUTT) initiative: Stability, innovation, and expansion\n\nJacob Baylis1, Malorie Carter2, Spencer Calder3, Marie Kenney4, Eric Hawkins5, Hildi Hagedorn6, Adam Gordon1\n\n1VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA; 2University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA; 3Veterans Health Administration, Salt Lake City, USA; 4Veterans Health Administration, Minneapolis, USA; 5Center of Innovation for Veteran-Centered and Value-Driven Care, Seattle, WA, USA; 6Center for Care Delivery & Outcomes Research Minneapolis, MN, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Adam Gordon (adam.gordon@hsc.utah.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S15\n\nBackground: The Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Stepped Care for Opioid Use Disorder Train the Trainer Initiative (SCOUTT) intended to facilitate medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in primary care (PC), general mental health (MH), and pain (P) clinics. SCOUTT—a operational and research collaborative—began in 2018 and was led by a coordinating center and external facilitators assigned to each facilities’ clinical champions to provide guidance, education, and overcome impediments to implementation. We sought to examine the models of care (MOC) implemented at 37 SCOUTT facilities and barriers and facilitators in implementation.\n\nMethods: SCOUTT engaged clinical champions in 18 VA facilities (Phase 1) and these teams, in 2020, helped facilitate spread of MOUD in an additional 19 facilities (Phase 2). In June 2022, we conducted a mixed-methods email survey to clinical champions of 37 facilities to inquire about the primary MOC being implemented within their clinics and the top three barriers and facilitators to implementation. Facility responses were tabulated, structured data were recorded, and unstructured data were assessed and analyzed for themes contrasting frequent barriers and facilitators identified by the Phase 1 and 2 facilities.\n\nFindings: Overall, 28 facilities responded (Phase 1: n=15 [83.3%], Phase 2: n=13 [68.4%]) with a total of 63 PC-MH-P clinics at those sites (Phase 1: n=35, Phase 2: n=28). The most common clinic MOC were pharmacy-collaborative-care-model (n=13, 37.1%) in Phase 1 and physician-directed-model (n=16, 57.1%) in Phase 2. The top three barriers to care were provider/staffing (turnover, understaffing), waivered prescribers not prescribing, and lack of incentives to provide care and provider stigma (tie). Phase 1 and 2 sites responded similarly to barriers, but Phase 2 sites reported patient stigma as the primary barrier. Phase 1 top facilitators included provider collaboration (nurses and pharmacists managing patients), clinical/programmatic support (support from clinicians and specialists, staffing), and leadership support. Phase 2 facilitators were similar, however a prominent facilitator in Phase 2 was that clinic prescribers were more accepting of MOUD and training.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: The expansion of the national SCOUTT Initiative has demonstrated diverse MOC adoption throughout PC-MH-P clinics. Similar barriers and facilitators to implementation were observed across SCOUTT phases.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n\nS16 Enhancing the implementation of telemedicine for veterans with serious mental illness\n\nPushpa Raja1, Sonya Gabrielian2, Neal Doran3\n\n1Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare System, Los Angeles, CA, USA; 2Veterans Health Administration, Los Angeles, CA, USA; 3San Diego VA Healthcare System, San Diego, CA, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Pushpa Raja (Pushpa.Raja@va.gov)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S16\n\nBackground\n\nAcross health systems, many anticipate that pandemic-driven telehealth adoption will be sustained. However, little is known about the relationship between telemedicine implementation and the quality of care for individuals with serious mental illness (SMI, defined as psychotic and bipolar disorders). Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), we studied the relationship between facility-level telemedicine adoption and performance metrics focused on SMI care. This work aimed to inform potential adaptations to telemedicine services for individuals with SMI to support effective care.\n\nMethods\n\nUsing national VA administrative data across 138 facilities, from January 2021 – March 2022, we examined facility-level adoption of telemedicine for veterans with SMI and facility-level performance metrics specified for this population. We quantified the percentage of each facility’s SMI outpatient visits delivered via VA Video Connect (VVC). Performance measures were specific to individuals with SMI and addressed: 1. Access to primary care; 2. Continuity of mental health utilization for a subpopulation with high-risk events; 3. Access and continuity of psychotherapy/psychosocial services; and 4. Access and continuity within two intensive SMI specialty programs. We used longitudinal mixed effects regression models to evaluate associations between VVC use and facility performance across these measures.\n\nFindings\n\nA higher proportion of SMI care being delivered via VVC was associated with lower scores on measures of continuity of psychotherapy/psychosocial care, access to primary care, and both access and continuity of case management for SMI. There was a positive association between VVC use and proportion of veterans accessing VA’s intensive outpatient program for SMI (all ps < .05). VVC use was unrelated to mental health care continuity following a high-risk event, or to the receipt of at least 1 psychosocial intervention visit.\n\nImplications for D&I Research\n\nWhile telemedicine implementation enabled healthcare for many veterans with SMI, facility-level telemedicine adoption may negatively impact continuity of care both within programs specific to SMI and across general mental health settings. Facility-level telemedicine adoption may also negatively impact primary care access among individuals with SMI. Implementation supports (e.g., augmentation with in-person case management, integration of peer supports) may be needed to optimize engagement of this vulnerable population.\n\nS17 Project mimic (maximizing the implementation of motivational incentives in clinics): a type 3 hybrid trial in 28 opioid treatment programs\n\nSara Becker\n\nNorthwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Sara Becker (sara_becker@brown.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S17\n\nBackground: CM is one of the most effective adjunctive treatments to medication for opioid use disorders, but its implementation in opioid treatment programs (OTPs) remains low. Project MIMIC is a cluster-randomized, type 3 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial comparing two strategies to implement CM in the OTP setting. We describe Project MIMIC’s design and share preliminary results from the first 18 OTPs, including 131 staff (counselors/leaders) and 378 patient participants.\n\nMethods: Eighteen OTPs were cluster-randomized to receive either the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) strategy (workshop + feedback + coaching) or the Enhanced ATTC (E-ATTC) strategy, which layered in two additional strategies: Pay-For-Performance and Implementation Sustainment Facilitation. Consistent with the exploration, preparation, implementation, and sustainment (EPIS) framework, OTPs engaged in 5 months of preparation, 10 months of implementation, and 6 months of sustainment monitoring.\n\nFindings: During the preparation phase, 105 counselors (55 E-ATTC, 50 ATTC) enrolled in Project MIMIC, of which 99 (100% EATTC, 94% ATTC) completed the didactic CM workshop and 64 (67% EATTC, 54% ATTC) submitted a role play for performance feedback. During the implementation phase, rates of patient recruitment, providers adopting CM, and providers meeting the CM exposure benchmark all favored E-ATTC relative to ATTC (recruitment: 87% vs 77%; adoption: 60% vs. 44%; exposure: 38% vs. 16%, all p-values < .0001). Of the first 18 OTPs, four E-ATTC sites and three ATTC sites sustained CM with fidelity following removal of external support: another four OTPs (1 E-ATTC, 3 ATTC) sustained CM incentives with low fidelity to the model. Another 10 OTPs are currently in the active implementation phase and additional data on these programs will be reported.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: Preliminary data indicate that CM training engagement, recruitment, adoption, and exposure rates were greater in the E-ATTC condition, relative to the ATTC condition. Next steps include examining effects on patient outcomes, and refining ongoing fidelity monitoring. These data have informed design decisions for the implementation strategies used in the planned, Medicaid-funded rollout of CM to 200 clinics across California.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS18 Cost-effectiveness of in-person vs. Virtual contingency management implementation strategies\n\nBryan Garner\n\nThe Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Bryan Garner (bryan.garner@osumc.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S18\n\nBackground: Project MIMIC (Maximizing Implementation of Motivational Incentives in Clinics) is an ongoing cluster-randomized hybrid type 3 trial evaluating multi-component strategies to implement contingency management (CM), a behavioral evidence-based practice, across opioid treatment programs (OTPs). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to rapidly shift the delivery of the training workshop component of the strategy to fully virtual. As a result, counselors in the first cohort received in-person workshop training, whereas counselors from the second cohort received virtual workshop. This unanticipated shift presented a rare opportunity to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the two modalities for equipping OTP staff to implement contingency management with fidelity.\n\nMethods\n\nTwenty-six counselors from eight OTPs received in-person didactic training, whereas 31 counselors from 10 OTPs received virtual didactic training. Common training elements were the facilitator, learning objectives, and educational strategies/activities. All clinicians submitted a post-training role-play, independently scored with a validated fidelity instrument (Continency Management Competence Scale) for which performances were compared against benchmarks representing initial readiness and advanced proficiency. Cohort-specific rates for benchmark attainment were calculated and per-clinician costs were estimated for the two modalities. Adjusted differences between cohorts were estimated using ordinary least squares, and an incremental cost effectiveness ratio was calculated to specify cost differences across cohorts.\n\nFindings: Attainment rates of the readiness and proficiency benchmarks were higher in the virtual than in-person condition (readiness: 86% vs. 96%, proficiency: 36% vs. 41%) though these differences were not statistically significant. Aggregated costs showed a $423 difference in per-clinician cost favoring virtual workshop training. Due to its lower cost and comparable effectiveness, the virtual modality was the dominant strategy.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: Our findings support the utility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of virtual workshop training as a means of promoting CM delivery with fidelity. These results may inform the delivery of workshop training as part of a multi-component implementation strategy for CM and other EBPs post-pandemic.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS19 Translating research to practice: advancing the uptake of culturally tailored contingency management in partnership with american indian communities\n\nKait Hirchak\n\nWashington State University, Pullman, WA, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Kait Hirchak (katherine.hirchak@wsu.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S19\n\nBackground: We conducted two community engaged randomized controlled trials of a culturally adapted contingency management (CM) intervention for alcohol and illicit drug use among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults residing in rural and urban areas. Across 272 participants, CM was associated with reduced alcohol, stimulant, and cannabis use. Responding to interest from Tribal communities, our research team pivoted to translate lessons learned from these studies to develop a suite of implementation support tools for AI/AN communities.\n\nMethods: Tenets of community-based participatory research were applied across partnerships. The Quality Implementation Framework was used to guide the development process. In partnership with the AI/AN communities, four members of the university team developed implementation tools.\n\nFindings: We developed a modified CM manual for Indigenous communities to aid intervention delivery and implementation with 8 new Tribal partners across 3 states. Intervention adaptations included integrating cultural values and alignment of CM with Indigenous worldviews; an incentive tracker that assures Medicaid-compliance; and client narratives (i.e., case studies). Implementation support tools included infographics to illustrate CM fidelity, a modified practice facilitation guide (i.e., a clinic asset and readiness assessment), pre- and post- knowledge surveys, and resources for coaching consultations to support ongoing, high-fidelity implementation.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: A suite of implementation support tools were identified to quickly meet the interest in CM by AI/AN communities. Results indicate that rapid movement from community-engaged Phase III clinical trials to adoption may be feasible and can strengthen the capacity among AI/AN communities in their efforts to provide culturally and clinically meaningful treatment to Tribal members.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS20 State level implementation of contingency management for stimulant use disorders\n\nSara Parent\n\nWashington State University, Pullman, WA, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Sara Parent (sara.parent@wsu.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S20\n\nBackground: Contingency Management (CM) is behavioral evidence-based practice (EBP) for substance use disorder, showing particular promise targeting stimulant use. Nationwide methamphetamine-related morbidity and mortality currently drive widespread interest in CM, creating a need for CM implementation support. The aims of this presentation are to: describe large-scale implementation initiatives in Montana and Washington in terms of the EPIS (exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainment) framework; report preliminary data on common barriers; and discuss lessons learned in translating research designed protocols to real-world settings.\n\nMethods: In partnership with Montana and Washington state healthcare authorities and behavioral health training experts, we co-designed and provided implementation support for a CM intervention for stimulant use disorders. The EPIS preparation phase included both outer and inner context activities. Outer context (state-wide) efforts included meeting with contract providers to secure funding, create an infrastructure to standardize the CM program, and provide group-learning environments that facilitated inter-organizational communication. The inner context (site-level) work accomplished through group and 1-on-1 coaching calls identified site-specific characteristics that facilitated or challenged implementation. During the implementation phase, we provided tracking tools to promote program fidelity and adherence to federal anti-kickback regulations, which allowed for remote fidelity monitoring and data collection. Our findings based on these data as well as detailed process notes and verbal feedback from sites will inform how these state systems move onto the sustainment phase.\n\nFindings: To date, 33 clinical sites have completed our didactic CM training; a total of 44 coaching calls have been conducted. 13 sites have implemented the intervention, as measured by at least one CM visit with an eligible patient. Implementation challenges identified included some common to other EBP implementation efforts (e.g. high staff turn-over, protocol fidelity, incorporating into existing structures/workflow), as well as CM-specific barriers (e.g. federal anti-kickback regulations, use of point of care urine testing).\n\nImplications for D&I Research: Lessons learned and data collected from our CM implementation initiative yield valuable insight for future largescale CM initiatives, including that underway in California for up to 200 clinics. By identifying solutions to common implementation barriers, we hope to advance the uptake of this life-saving EBP.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nState block grants\n\nBuilding the Future of D&I Science: Training, Infrastructure, and Emerging Research Areas\n\nS21 The implementation planning assessment tool: a tool to encourage researchers and trialists to be more proactive, nimble and responsive to implementation science needs\n\nChristine Kowalski2, Linda Kawentel2, Tassos Kyriakides3, Lori Davis4, Nicholas Bowersox2, Amy Kilbourne5, Grant Huang6, Andrea Nevedal1,5\n\n1VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 2VA QUERI Center for Evaluation and Implementation Resources (CEIR), Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 3Veterans Health Administration, West Haven, CT, USA; 4Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA; 5VA Center for Clinical Management Research Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 6VHA Office of Research & Development Washington, D.C., USA\n\nCorrespondence: Christine Kowalski (Christine.Kowalski@va.gov)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S21\n\nBackground\n\nWithout a proactive plan to implement clinical trial findings, it can take decades for one-fifth of effective interventions to be adopted into routine care settings. There is a dearth of pragmatic tools to prepare trialists for implementing effective treatments or programs across the translation spectrum. To address knowledge gaps, we introduce a newly developed Implementation Planning Assessment (IPA) Tool that any trialist or researcher may use throughout initial studies to support future trials or research to understand implementation of effective interventions.\n\nMethods\n\nThe tool was developed through a systematic process by an interdisciplinary team with expertise in implementation science, clinical trials, program evaluation, and qualitative methods; team meetings with an organized set of agendas were used to develop and refine the tool.\n\nFindings\n\nThe tool emphasizes three phases to accelerate the adoption of interventions into routine clinical care: Phase 1, “Planning, Framing, and Aligning Interested Parties,” involves identification and garnering of input from multilevel interested parties who have a vested interest in the trial’s results and potentially the leverage to incorporate results or effective treatments into routine practice via organizational changes. Phase 2, “Implementation Process Data Collection,” involves planning and assessment by clinical and research leaders that will promote uptake of the intervention, if found effective, and the enactment of an implementation plan. Phase 3 “Planning for Sustainment for Effective Trials,” takes results from phases 1-2 to outline a process by which trial results and interventions will be adopted in routine practice. Throughout all phases, the assessment team should also plan for dissemination, which involves sharing information about the intervention, implementation, and trial results to increase uptake among key interested parties.\n\nImplications for D&I Research\n\nThis tool, anchored in implementation science principles, provides a much-needed, practical guide for trialists and researchers working across the translation spectrum to spread effective interventions that would improve the healthcare of patients. This tool brings a ready-made list of necessary steps for trialists and researchers aiming to improve implementation, including scale-up and spread, of effective, clinical-trial-tested interventions in health care settings. It can also be utilized by clinicians and health services researchers who are new to the field of implementation science.\n\nS22 Learning from missed opportunities through retrospective application of the implementation planning assessment (ipa) tool in a va clinical trial\n\nLori Davis1, Tassos Kyriakides2\n\n1Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA; 2Veterans Health Administration, West Haven, CT, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Lori Davis (lori.davis@va.gov)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S22\n\nBackground\n\nThe Veterans Individual Placement and Support Toward Advancing Recovery (VIP-STAR; CSP#589) was a VA Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) multicenter, randomized clinical trial that compared the effectiveness of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported employment vs. usual care (transitional work program) in terms of securing and maintaining competitive employment among unemployed Veterans with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nMethods\n\nThe study operations were built on a collaborative partnership between the clinical and research team(s) at each of the twelve participating sites. While the CSP trial process/protocol did not include any implementation expertise per se, the study IPS trainers, fidelity monitors, program evaluators, PTSD clinicians, and vocational rehabilitation experts successfully executed the trial with essential implementation components. Even though the IPA tool was not available at the time of the trial launch, it was retrospectively applied to assess its utility.\n\nFindings\n\nThe VIP-STAR study concluded that more Veterans in the IPS group became steady workers and earned more income from competitive jobs over the 18-month follow-up compared with the usual care group. Implementation of findings at several local VAMCs was assisted by the pre-existing partnership and the study operations at large. However, despite its strong evidence base, implementation of IPS for PTSD in VA has not been widespread, which is possibly due to our lack implementation specialists working at the front end with program office leadership to develop a roadmap for future sustainment of the most effective services. The application of the IPA tool to this trial provides a retrospective illustration of its components and clearly shows the utility of this tool and highlights the need to consider implementation issues a priori.\n\nImplications for D&I Research\n\nThe IPA Tool would have allowed the VIP-STAR team to assess stakeholder concerns and solve challenges within the VA that would impact efficient and timely implementation of the trial results. Even though no benchmarks of successful implementation were drafted during the trial, the retrospective application of the developed IPA tool strongly points to utilization of this tool in trials going forward.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nVA Cooperative Studies Program\n\nS23 Proactive application of the implementation planning assessment tool in a multi-site va clinical trial\n\nWhitney Mills1,2, Kali Thomas2, Yuan Huang3, Michael Wininger3, Scott Hummel4\n\n1Brown University, Providence, RI, USA; 2VA Providence Healthcare System, Providence, RI, USA; 3CSP Coordinating Center (WH-CSPCC), VA CT Healthcare System ,West Haven, CT, USA; 4VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Whitney Mills (whitney.mills@va.gov)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S23\n\nBackground\n\nThe VA Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) study “Geriatric OUt-of-hospital Randomized MEal Trial in heart failure – Veterans Affairs” (GOURMET-VA; CSP #2025) is a randomized, single-blind, multi-center, clinical trial investigating the effects of home-delivered meals and enhanced dietary education in Veterans discharged from hospitalization for heart failure. GOURMET-VA is one of the first CSP studies to integrate implementation scientists during protocol planning. This presentation describes how the Implementation Planning Assessment (IPA) Tool was used proactively to guide planning and integration of an implementation evaluation in the trial protocol.\n\nMethods\n\nThe three IPA phases guided development of an implementation evaluation oriented towards future adoption and sustainment of this intervention into routine clinical practice.\n\nFindings\n\nPhase 1 (“Planning, Framing, & Aligning Interested Parties”): During early protocol development, the implementation team helped identify and facilitated meetings with relevant VA national leadership including the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care, Office of Nutrition and Food Services, and Office of Nursing Services. These meetings resulted in letters of support outlining engagement throughout the trial. Phase 2 (“Implementation Process Data Collection”): Guided by IPA, the implementation evaluation focuses on understanding the context into which the intervention is being implemented, the experiences of Veterans and clinicians with the intervention, and identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation at the patient, healthcare provider, and leadership levels. The evaluation includes mixed methods analysis of data collected as part of the trial and through prospective qualitative interviews. Phase 3 (“Planning for Sustainment of Effective Trials”): A preliminary dissemination and sustainability plan was drafted, guided by the conversations with our VA leadership partners. As the trial results are not yet known, we also drafted a plan for how the implementation evaluation data may be used to inform adaptations of the GOURMET-VA intervention to improve effectiveness and uptake.\n\nImplications for D&I Research\n\nThe IPA provides structured guidance for integrating dissemination and sustainment into trial protocols. Furthermore, the structured guides that comprise the IPA allowed the implementation scientists and the trial team to find common ground in terms of rationale, methods, and language. The IPA is valuable for both new and experienced implementation scientists.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nVHA Cooperative Studies Program\n\nS24 Vha efforts to develop organizational structured to support consistent implementation evaluation capacity within clinical trials\n\nTassos Kyriakides1, Nicholas Bowersox2, Grant Huang3\n\n1Veterans Health Administration, West Haven, CT, USA; 2VA QUERI Center for Evaluation and Implementation Resources (CEIR), Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 3VHA Office of Research & Development, Office of Research and Development Washington, D.C., USA\n\nCorrespondence: Tassos Kyriakides (tassos.kyriakides@va.gov)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S24\n\nBackground\n\nHigh Reliability Organization (HRO) and Learning Healthcare System (LHS) integration within large healthcare organizations such as the Veterans Affairs (VA) requires significant reorganization of resources, methods, and workflows. HRO and LHS concepts are essential to effective patient care by ensuring that research identifies cutting-edge treatments which can be effectively utilized within standard healthcare settings and providers can rapidly incorporate these treatments into regular clinical practice. Within VA, one major movement to support HRO and LHS has focused on the incorporation of implementation planning within large-scale clinical trials, supporting fluid and realistic efforts to support practice adoption in the post-trial period. While initial VA efforts in this area have focused on trial-by-trial efforts, efforts have also focused on the creation of standardized internal clinical trial assessment capacities for all new VA clinical trials.\n\nMethods\n\nA workgroup of VA implementation scientists and VA Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) leadership reviewed lessons learned from trial-specific efforts to incorporate implementation-relevant factor assessment within CSP trials. These lessons were then used to develop best-practice recommendations to support the development of internal CSP staffing, processes, and workflows which would allow for the collection of data related to practice implementation as a standard aspect of all future VA large-scale clinical trials.\n\nFindings\n\nThe development of systemic capacities related to implementation assessment within large-scale clinical trials includes considerations funding, supervision and oversight, recruitment and training of staff with specialized research skills, and the development of new workflows to support effective collaboration between new and existing CSP staff. Additional considerations focused on both the final desired “new normal” to be achieved as well as interim approaches that would allow CSP to incorporate implementation data collection while also building sustainable long-term capacity.\n\nImplications for D&I Research\n\nThe standardization of large-scale assessment of implementation factors within large-scale clinical trials will improve the direct applicability of clinical trial results to patient care. This process will also open up opportunities for implementation researchers to help inform the identification of clinical breakthroughs and highlights the essential role of implementation science in supporting HRO and LHS within large integrated healthcare systems such as VA.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nVHA Cooperative Studies Program\n\nS25 Designing for dissemination of treatments for covid-19: the fit to context framework and an engagement methods navigator tool\n\nBethany Kwan1, Matt DeCamp1, Chelsea Sobczak1, Jenna Reno2, Adit Ginde1, Hillary Lum1\n\n1University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA; 2RTI International, Denver, CO, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Bethany Kwan (Bethany.kwan@cuanschutz.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S25\n\nBackground: Designing for dissemination and sustainability (D4DS) includes use of participatory engagement methods and application of D&I theories to guide the process of ensuring innovation “fit to context” and planning for dissemination. We used capacity building resources and tools to design, enact, and evaluate dissemination strategies for evidence-based monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments for COVID-19 outpatients. Intravenous mAb treatment was available by December 2020 but uptake was slow and inequitable.\n\nMethods: The Fit to Context (F2C) Framework for D4DS is a process framework with four phases – conceptualization, design, dissemination, and impact – used to guide Colorado mAb dissemination strategies. Diffusion of innovation theory underpinned mixed methods assessment of contextual factors related to mAb use, a key aspect of conceptualization. The DICEMethods.org stakeholder engagement navigator tool yielded methods for engaging partners and communities in design of dissemination messages and products. Conceptualization and design phase insights informed dissemination channels. Real-world data from a statewide referral system showed impact on mAb referral patterns.\n\nFindings: Community and clinician surveys, focus groups, and interviews revealed the need to simplify messaging and centralize mAb treatment systems and processes. A multisector stakeholder advisory panel and community engagement studios oriented dissemination planning to COVID-19 geographic, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities. Dissemination products are at mAbColorado.org. Communication channels included social media, radio, and television, webinars, and distribution by “regional health connectors.” Over 10 months, total mAb referrals increased by 539% from 369/month (March-July 2021) to 1989/month (August-December 2021), and unique referring clinicians increased by 483% from 159/month (March-July 2021) to 769/month (August – December 2021) following the July launch of the mAb Colorado dissemination campaign. Treatment sites increased from 18 to 58, many of which were in rural and underserved communities.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: D4DS involves a complex set of activities to assess context, build partnerships, co-design dissemination products, leverage and build system capacity for distribution, and evaluate impact. Use of the Fit to Context Framework can systematize rapid conceptualization, design, dissemination, and evaluation of strategies for promoting adoption of evidence-based health care innovations during pandemics and beyond. D&I tools such as DICEMethods.org complement use of D4DS process and context frameworks.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS26 Development of a generalizable designing for dissemination and sustainability tool for implementation scientists and practitioners\n\nMaura Kepper1,2, Bethany Kwan3, Russell Glasgow4, Douglas Luke5, Andrea Graham6, Ana Baumann2, Thembekile Shato2, Brad Morse3, Ross Brownson7\n\n1National Cancer Institute’s Consortium for Cancer Implementation Science, USA; 2Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA; 3University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA; 4University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA; 5Center for Public Health Systems Science, Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA; 6Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA; 7Washington University in St. Louis, Brown School, St. Louis, MO, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Maura Kepper (kepperm@wustl.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S26\n\nBackground: The use of Designing for Dissemination and Sustainability (D4DS) principles ensures that the products of research (interventions, tools, materials, findings) are developed to match well with the needs and context of the target problem, audience and setting. Thereby, dissemination efforts can be well-received and implementation and sustainability can be best supported to increase impact. However, D4DS principles are often not used during the various stages of research.\n\nMethods: We are using a user-centered design (UCD) process to develop a digital tool that will facilitate the use D4DS with particular emphasis on the first two phases (conceptualization and design) of the Fit to Context Framework (see abstract 1). Our UCD design process: 1) identifies the need and demand for key issues this tool should address through focus groups and an environmental scan; 2) builds a tool using an iterative design process; and 3) tests the tool for usability. The iterative design process allows end-users to give feedback on design options (e.g., wireframes) in successive versions. Final designs will be built into a digital tool by professional developers and tested for usability.\n\nFindings: End-users were defined as implementation science teams conducting a health-related project, which may include academics (e.g., researchers, students), practitioners (e.g., clinicians, health departments) and non-governmental organizations. An environmental scan confirmed that no such tool exists and gathered D4DS methods and resources that will be delivered via the tool. Focus groups confirmed a need for and excitement about this tool. Practitioners particularly felt a tool that walked them through key steps in design and planning would be useful for community-based research projects. Beyond use in their own work, end-users also wanted to use this tool for teaching and consulting. Users wanted the ability to save their work and work interactively with a team throughout design, which facilitates academic-community partnership. We will present the prototype tool.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: The D4DS tool will provoke users to think critically and engage stakeholders to develop a plan for active and equitable dissemination and sustainability—ultimately resulting in more effective translation of research to practice and policy.\n\nS27 Building dissemination capacity through the colorado clinical and translational sciences institute dissemination consultation service\n\nHeather Gilmartin1, Justin Shrader2, Robert Thompson2, Demetria McNeal3, Bethany Kwan2\n\n1Denver/Seattle Center of Innovation, Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center, Aurora, CO, USA; 2University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA; 3University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Heather Gilmartin (heather.gilmartin@va.gov)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S27\n\nBackground: Scientific dissemination is an active, tailored process of communicating complex research or technical information to a wide audience. Dissemination efforts should be guided by theories or frameworks and the information should be made simple and engaging to convey key messages to non-scientific audiences. Reasons to actively disseminate science beyond posters, presentations, and papers include to connect to those who may benefit from research findings sooner than the 17-year average, to raise the profile of your work and organization, and to engage diverse partners in current and future work. Most scientists are not trained in dissemination, limiting their awareness of best practices, tools, and resources. To build dissemination capacity and provide training, mentorship, and guidance to members of the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CCTSI), a free dissemination consultation service was launched within the Dissemination and Implementation (D&I) Research Core. In this panel discussion we will describe the creation of the consultation service and review and discuss the most common consultation topics, tips, and best practices.\n\nMethods: The dissemination consultation service launched in 2021 and is staffed by six, part-time faculty with expertise in the fields of health communication, D&I, health services, nursing, social psychology, and broadcast media. Virtual consults occur on Zoom. Consultation discussions and evaluations are documented, stored in a secure database, and descriptively analyzed in Excel.\n\nFindings: Over 18 months, 37 consultations with basic, clinical, and public health scientists and practitioners have been provided. The most common topics include dissemination planning guidance, developing an online presence, engaging in online communities, and message creation. Best practice guidance includes use of D&I frameworks, introduction to online profile sites and social media platforms, messaging tips and creation of visual abstracts, infographics, and press releases. Participants have been “extremely satisfied” and report broad application of dissemination best practices within their programs of research.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: The evidence-based guidance provided through the CCTSI dissemination consult service has increased awareness, application, and capacity for dissemination science with researchers across the clinical and translational spectrum. This model could be scaled across academic settings to increase the impact of D&I science.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS28 Innovation corps™ (i-corps™) at the colorado clinical translational sciences institute: fostering innovation across an academic medical campus\n\nDemetria McNeal1, Cathy Bodine2\n\n1University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO, USA; 2University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Demetria McNeal (demetria.mcneal@cuanschutz.edu)\n\nImplementation Science 2023, 18(Suppl 3):S28\n\nBackground: A key barrier to translation of biomedical research discoveries is a lack of understanding among scientists regarding the complexity and process of implementation. Academic Medical Centers (AMC) that have teaching, patient care, research, and service engrained in their mission are well poised to translate these discoveries to real-world clinical and community practice. NIH adapted the NSF I-Corps™ entrepreneurial training program for life-science researchers to help bridge the so called “valley of death”– the schism between research development and market application. The objectives of the I-Corps program are to a) develop the workforce by catalyzing an academic entrepreneurial culture and skillset; b) develop discoveries and commercialization potential, and, c) demonstrate impact by connecting researchers to resources for commercialization, domain expertise, and accelerator funding. Colorado has a vibrant local startup ecosystem, state support for commercialization and entrepreneurship as well as critical mass of product development expertise. University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, as a major AMC, is an engine for growth for the region.\n\nMethods: This team-based experiential three-week training is taught by faculty with business and entrepreneurial experience, many having prior industry experience. From 2016 to spring of 2022, I-Corps@CCTSI has trained over 10 cohorts, more than 70 teams and greater than 200 participants from diverse backgrounds. The customer discovery interview process has resulted in more than 1700 interviews to date. Content includes customer discovery, value proposition, and validating needs.\n\nFindings: Innovations related to medical devices (33%), drugs/biologics (20%), software applications (16%), and diagnostics (8%) have completed to the program. An average of 24 interviews was conducted Teams reported increased readiness for commercialization over time (83%, 9 months; 14%, 3 months). Thirty-nine percent met with institutional technology transfer to pursue licensing/patents and 24% pursued venture capital/investor funding following the short courses.\n\nImplications for D&I Research: I-Corps training provided at the University of Colorado AMC provide teams with a rigorous and repeatable process to aid development of a business model based on customer needs.\n\nPrimary Funding Source\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nS29 Monitoring for unintended consequences of ehr-based implementation strategies: a novel approach using ehr audit logs and machine learning\n\nJinying Chen1,2, Sarah L.

Monitoring for both intended and unintended consequences of CDS on clinic workflow is important. We report a novel monitoring approach using EHR audit logs and machine learning.\n\nMethods: We compared distributions of cancer providers’ EHR activities in 4 clinics from 2019-2020 related to CDS for tobacco cessation. Monitoring was conducted within a 4.5-hour window of patient visits before (2,633 visits) and after (1,070 visits) implementing the CDS alert. We used topic modeling, a latent-variable statistical machine learning approach, to analyze EHR audit logs recording low-level events (e.g., loading a ‘visit navigator’ template, lab review, completing alerts). A topic model, trained using EHR log segments, identified 12 topics, with each assigned a clinical activity by consulting 4 domain experts. We then applied the topic model to EHR logs for during-Visit and before-Visit sessions to obtain the time a provider spent on each clinical activity for each session (estimated from topic distribution and session length). Mean time spent on each activity pre- and post-alert-implementation was estimated by using the inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment method to adjust for imbalance between pre- and post-alert-implementation data. The study was IRB-approved.\n\nFindings: Within the 12 clinical activities, 3 were CDS-related (Topic/T2: reviewing patient records and addressing alerts, T8: acting on CDS, T10: bypassing/postponing CDS), 3 focused on reviewing information (T5: vital signs, T6: snapshot of patient reports, T12: outside organization records), 5 involved modifying EHR (T1: documenting patient visit, T3: modifying diagnosis and problem lists, T4: reviewing and writing clinical notes, T7: using Visit Navigator to manage clinical care and bill, T11: placing and documenting orders), and one (T9) was searching patient chart. Providers spent more time addressing CDS (T2, 8, and 10; 32-35 more seconds) d"
