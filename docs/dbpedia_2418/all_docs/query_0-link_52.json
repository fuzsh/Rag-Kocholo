Irish Texts Society Publications are available via their website (click on the link to the RIA shop).\n\nThe figure in the second column of each table is the file size in KB.\n\nSGML is for download via FTP. The procedure depends on the browser you use:\n\nIf using IE or Opera, right-click on the SGML icon and choose Save Target as... IE and Opera will prompt you to download the file, and ask if you want to open it. Your designated program for SGML files will open the file. If you do not have one, any plaintext editor can display the text. Unfortunately Firefox and Mozilla try to open the SGML directly, as if it were HTML. Therefore, right-click on 'View page source' to see the full encoding. For more information on an SGML browser or plugin to display these files, see our FAQ for details.\n\nTo view XML files, click on them first. The HTML browser will then try to load them and display an error message. By right-clicking and selecting \"View (Page) Source\" or \"Source\" you can display the source code including all markup."
