        "text": "Our curriculum provides you with the opportunity to complete your Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) certification, your Mental Health First Aid certification, certificate in healthcare quality and safety and micro-credentialing in a variety of areas. Many students participate in faculty-mentored field and clinical research during the semester as part of an independent study or over the summer as part of the Quinnipiac Interdisciplinary Program for Research and Scholarship (QUIP-RS).\n\nYou’ll be joining an active, interdisciplinary community. Each year, you’ll have the opportunity to participate in over 80 interprofessional education events, from interactive simulations to other hands-on practice learning. There are numerous community engagement courses and international faculty-led courses that will provide you with a global perspective of healthcare.\n\nThis flexible program offers students a competitive edge to pursue their career interests or postgraduate study paths, including medical school. Whichever area of healthcare you choose to pursue, we will provide the foundation you’ll need to be an inspired and prepared learner dedicated to improving the future of healthcare.\n\nStudents are also encouraged to declare a minor to help broaden their foundational knowledge and to help prepare them for their future careers or graduate programs. 18 credits or six courses are needed for a minor."
