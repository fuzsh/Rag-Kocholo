Analysis of geopotential height and vorticity fields from the North American Regional Reanalysis and cloud-to-ground lightning data indicates that the passage of mobile inverted troughs (IVs) significantly enhances convection when it coincides with the peak diurnal cycle (1800–0900 UTC) over the North American monsoon (NAM) region. The preferred tracks of IVs during early summer are related to the dominant modes of Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability. When La Niña–like (El Niño–like) conditions prevail in the tropical Pacific and the eastern North Pacific has a horseshoe-shaped negative (positive) SST anomaly, IVs preferentially track farther north (south) and are slightly (typically one IV) more (less) numerous. These results point to the important role that synoptic-scale disturbances play in modulating the diurnal cycle of precipitation over the NAM region and the significant impact that the statistically supported low-frequency Pacific SST anomalies exert on the occurrence and track of these synoptic transients.",

        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe frequent presence of upper-tropospheric lows in the subtropical North Pacific and North Atlantic during boreal summer is well documented (e.g., Riehl 1948; Kelley and Mock 1982). Of specific interest to the summer climate of North America are warm core upper-tropospheric lows that develop in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic in or near the tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) that, according to Whitfield and Lyons (1992), is a climatological mean summer circulation with an elongated shear axis (from northeast to southwest) in the upper troposphere. These lows often begin their westward progression from the TUTT into the core North American monsoon (NAM) region covering the southwest United States and northwest Mexico during the summer months. However, it is important that not every transient upper-tropospheric feature that occurs in the core NAM region develops in or near the TUTT region. For example, Pytlak et al. (2005) documented cold core upper-tropospheric lows that formed in the central Mississippi Valley and wrapped around the equatorward side of the subtropical ridge over the southwestern United States and were carried westward by the tropical easterlies across northern Mexico and Southern California. Irrespective of differences in point of origin or dynamic characteristics of these upper-level features, Douglas and Leal (2003) suggest that they appear to enhance the transport of low-level moisture north through the Gulf of California, a process now commonly termed a “gulf surge.” The low-level moisture coincident with upper-level cooling subsequently destabilizes the atmosphere, resulting in a widespread convective outbreak in the core NAM region. They also found that precipitation is enhanced during this time within the metropolitan areas of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona.\n\nThe NAM is a large-scale seasonal atmospheric circulation that generates between 50% and 70% of the annual precipitation during summer over the core NAM region (Carleton et al. 1990; Douglas et al. 1993; Higgins et al. 1997; Adams and Comrie 1997; Mitchell et al. 2002; Sheppard et al. 2002). Upper-level winds change from a westerly direction that transports air from the dry, cool eastern Pacific in late spring and early summer to an easterly direction that carries more humid air from the Gulf of Mexico into the NAM region in summer. The shift in prevailing wind results from the development of a monsoon ridge over the south-central United States (Watson et al. 1994a; Adams and Comrie 1997). However, as many studies have demonstrated (i.e., Hales 1972, 1974; Carleton 1986; Douglas et al. 1993), the mountains of the Sierra Madre effectively block low-level moisture of the Gulf of Mexico from being directly transported into the western half of the core monsoon region (defined as the “tier 1 region” in the North American Monsoon Experiment). Thus, the primary source of low-level moisture is from the eastern tropical Pacific and Gulf of California (Fig. 1), which can be provided via intermittent gulf surges (Maddox et al. 1995; Adams and Comrie 1997; Higgins et al. 2004; Rogers and Johnson 2007), or moisture from evapotranspiration sources in the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) (Watts et al. 2007).\n\nMonsoon thunderstorms are linked to the diurnal cycle of convection. This process is driven primarily by daytime heating over elevated terrain. Higher potential temperatures in areas of elevated terrain, as compared to adjacent valleys and deserts, leads to upslope flow, moisture convergence, and the development of convective clouds over the mountains, typically in the late morning to early afternoon (e.g., Maddox et al. 1995). Thunderstorm development in the afternoon can be further enhanced by the presence of an upper-level cyclone (Fig. 2). Under favorable steering conditions, convection generated over elevated terrain during the early afternoon moves out over the hot deserts in the late afternoon or evening (e.g., Johnson et al. 2007). As a result, radiational cooling of the cloud tops leads to a steepened lapse rate and intensification of convection (Hales 1977). This is an important mechanism for rainfall during the monsoon, especially in the northern part of the NAM region (i.e., southwestern United States) where precipitation is more variable intraseasonally (Castro et al. 2007a).\n\nVariability of monsoon precipitation at interannual and longer time scales is related to the positioning and seasonal evolution of upper-level features, namely an upper-level monsoon/subtropical ridge (Carleton 1986; Carleton et al. 1990; Douglas et al. 1993; Watson et al. 1994a; Adams and Comrie 1997; Comrie and Glenn 1998; Grantz et al. 2007). If this ridge migrates anomalously far north or northeast of its climatological location—for example, the Four Corners region (the common joint corner for Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico) during late July and early August—the core NAM region experiences enhanced upper-level easterlies and an increase in rainfall amounts and coverage. If the upper-level monsoon ridge is, instead, anomalously far south, the core NAM region experiences a weaker (or nonexistent) tropical influence and convection is normally suppressed. This relationship is out of phase with precipitation anomalies over the central United States (Carleton 1986; Carleton et al. 1990; Douglas et al. 1993; Watson et al. 1994a; Adams and Comrie 1997; Comrie and Glenn 1998; Grantz et al. 2007). The strength of the monsoon anticyclone during the monsoon onset period in the southwestern United States (late June/early July) is significantly related, in a statistical sense, to the state of the Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) via a midlatitude atmospheric teleconnection response. If El Niño–like (La Niña–like) conditions prevail in the eastern and central tropical Pacific, and the eastern North Pacific has a horseshoe-shaped positive (negative) SST anomaly, an anomalous southward (northward) displacement of the monsoon ridge is likely to occur (Castro et al. 2001, 2007b).\n\nCastro et al. (2007b) defined a combined Pacific variability mode (CPVM), considering two of the dominant rotated EOFs of global SST that reflect interannual and interdecadal Pacific variability (see their Fig. 4). They found that, if the CPVM is positive (negative), NAM onset, as simulated by a regional climate model, is generally late (early) and summer precipitation is generally below (above) average within the NAM region. As they also note, the CPVM is quite similar to the pan-Pacific mode of Schubert et al. (2004) associated with dry and wet conditions in the central United States during the twentieth century. Interannual variability in the diurnal cycle of convection can dramatically change over relatively short distances in the southwest United States. Even more pertinent to the present work from Castro et al. (2007b), variations in a “synoptic mode” of convection (4–15 days) were found to exhibit a coherent relationship to the CPVM.\n\nUnderstanding intraseasonal variability and its relationship to NAM precipitation is a research and forecasting challenge that has motivated several field campaigns, such as the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) (e.g., NAME Project Science Team 2004; Reyes et al. 1994). The westward progression of the aforementioned TUTT region features, such as easterly waves and upper-level lows, occur on the equatorward and west sides of the subtropical anticyclone where easterly and southeasterly flow exists respectively (Carleton 1986; Whitfield and Lyons 1992; Pytlak et al. 2005; Douglas and Englehart 2007). These features have a distinct influence on convection in the NAM region and came under intense study during NAME (NAME Project Science Team 2004). During 2003 and 2004, lower- and upper-level features were intensely monitored and tracked for research and forecast improvement on the hourly to interannual temporal scale (NAME Project Science Team 2004). A forecast operating center (FOC) in Tucson was created to support daily forecast operations (15 June 2004–30 August 2004), and forecasters were trained to observe specific features. One of these features was referenced as the inverted trough (IV), defined as a mid- to upper-level tropospheric low, detected by either water vapor or upper-air analysis, which was numbered and tracked as long as it was distinct and moving near the core monsoon region (Pytlak 2004). Inverted troughs were also targeted for intense observation periods when all National Weather Service (NWS) and Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) upper-air sites participating in NAME launched four to six radiosondes a day. A NOAA P3 aircraft also monitored possible Gulf of California moisture surges and the surrounding atmosphere (NAME Project Science Team 2004). These upper-level features pose a challenge for operational assimilation systems to analyze in real time with a high degree of confidence owing to their formation and propagation over data-sparse areas (e.g., Sierra Madre Occidental) and their modification by underlying terrain and deep convection. In these instances, output from high-resolution data assimilation systems, regional reanalyses (Mesinger et al. 2006), and remote sensing platforms (e.g., water vapor imagery) provide the means to track their evolution over many days.\n\nLiterature that focuses on the impact of transient synoptic systems is more limited in number and scope. Pytlak et al. (2005) applied potential vorticity (PV) thinking (James and Hoskins 1985) to hypothesize that two possible and distinct areas of upper-level divergence and midtropospheric upward vertical motion exist. The authors proposed that these areas are on both the leading (west) and trailing (east) quadrants of IVs (Fig. 3). These regions theoretically favor positive differential vorticity advection given a westward propagating feature. Pytlak et al. further hypothesized, and Douglas and Englehart (2007) later found, that upper-level cooling can also be expected from these transient IV features. Through this dynamical mechanism, upper-level systems can play critical roles in organizing mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Douglas and Englehart further concluded that IVs were, on average, the dominant transient feature of the NAM region. These transient IVs were also classified by their work into warm (500-hPa trough temperatures >−6°C), neutral (−7°C to −8°C), or cold (<−8°C). From this classification they determined that 62% of all inverted troughs were warm core, 30% were neutral, and 8% were cold core. Although this classification method may be somewhat simple and arbitrary, they did note differences in the physical characteristics of “warm” and “cold” IVs. A majority of these systems follow the dynamical and structural characteristics of TUTT features as found by Whitfield and Lyons (1992) with classifications that could be considered “neutral” or “warm” core. It is stressed by Douglas and Englehart (2007), however, that not all of these systems may have been detected at the 500-mb level. Systems of this classification were found to be midlevel manifestations of moderate or strong low-level tropical waves that were crossing the Mexican Plateau from the Gulf of Mexico, according to Douglas and Englehart. The “cold” IVs produce more precipitation on their forward flanks as they approach the core region of the NAM region and have structure and dynamics akin to midlatitude wintertime systems. Though much fewer in number, on average, these types of IVs can sometimes become cut off from both the polar westerlies and tropical easterlies and supply the forcing mechanism for catastrophic amounts of monsoon rainfall. A good example of this type of event would be one that occurred on 27–31 July 2006 when Tucson, Arizona, experienced a serious flooding event underneath a cutoff upper-level disturbance (Magirl et al. 2007). This system was an upper-tropospheric low that moved down the east side of the monsoon ridge and became cut off over the state of Arizona for four days. This event produced 265 mm during 3 days (a rainfall depth with an estimated 1000-yr recurrence) and caused major damage in Sabino Canyon, a popular local recreation area.\n\nThe NAME works of Pytlak et al. (2005), and Douglas and Englehart (2007) on the dynamics and climatology of IVs over the NAM region, leave unanswered questions concerning operational forecasting. For example, how does the passage of transient IVs influence the diurnal cycle of precipitation, a dominant temporal band of summertime convection over the NAM region? How does the phase of intraseasonal and interannual low-frequency modes (e.g., SST forcing) impact the occurrence of synoptic-scale transients? These are two questions that warrant better inferences of physical processes thorough statistical quantification. This paper addresses these two questions from a statistical perspective, and it takes advantage of datasets not yet applied in toto to upper-level IVs.\n\nThe outline for this paper is as follows: describes the regional geographical definitions based upon those provided by the North American Monsoon Experiment literature. These definitions are chosen because of the size of influence and scaling of mesoscale and synoptic-scale features. An overview of the key geography is also given to help understand the weather and climate of the NAM region. The datasets and the methodology of analysis are also described there. establishes that convective activity during specific hours of the diurnal cycle is enhanced by passage transient IVs. demonstrates the importance of interannual Pacific SST variability on the frequency and passage of transient IVs. Discussion and conclusion are given in section 5.\n\n4. Results\n\na. Diurnal cycle\n\nWarm season convection over the continents and coastal zones is marked by a strong diurnal signal (Wallace 1975; Zajac and Rutledge 2001). The NAM region is no exception. Over Arizona for example, the higher terrain of the Mogollon Rim and White Mountains experiences a diurnal maximum during midafternoon hours, whereas the lower terrain of central and western Arizona experiences its maximum during the early and late evening hours (Hales 1977; Balling and Brazel 1987; King and Balling 1994; Watson et al. 1994b; Maddox et al. 1995). It is hypothesized by Pytlak et al. (2005) that the changes in upper-level divergence and static stability associated with transient IVs could strongly affect the diurnal signal. Hence, it is of value to quantify the role that IVs have in affecting the diurnal cycle throughout the core NAM region.\n\nFigure 4 shows the 3-h evolution of hourly lightning density for the six times of 1800 UTC (1100 LST) to 0900 UTC (0200 LST), inclusive, hours that coincide with the NARR analyses. Results are normalized by the total days in the 10-season composite (1220) to units of km−2 h−1. The daily convective cycle commences around 1100 LST (Fig. 4a) over the high terrain of New Mexico (Sacramento Mountains, Sangre de Cristo) and Arizona (Mogollon Rim, White Mountains). Convective activity reaches its peak diurnal values over these mountain regions three hours later (1400 LST, Fig. 4b). Lightning also peaks over the Santa Rita Mountains (southern Arizona) and the northern Sierra Madre Occidental (northeastern Sonora, Mexico), where the CG density increases tenfold between 1800 and 2100 UTC to its domain maximum of ∼25 km−2 h−1 (e.g., Murphy and Holle 2005). Convection moves off the terrain by late afternoon, 1700 LST (Fig. 4c). It propagates eastward from the Sangre de Cristo range and westward or southwestward over Arizona and northern Sonora State in Mexico, consistent with prior analysis of radar echoes (e.g., Knievel et al. 2004, their Fig. 9). In most regions, the lightning count decreases markedly from late afternoon to early evening (Fig. 4d). Convection weakens, then dies as it approaches the Gulf of California and lower desert of Southern California during the evening hours from 2000 to 0200 LST. Domain-averaged CG flash density is a minimum during the early morning daylight hours (1200 and 1500 UTC, results not shown).\n\nFigure 5 presents the difference in CG density count (km−2 h−1) for IV days minus the non-IV days. Each composite shows field significance at the 99% level, which indicates that the presence of an IV has a strong impact on the likelihood of lighting. Despite accounting for only 38% of all sample days, IV days account for the majority of total lightning strikes over Arizona and northern Sonora. The enhancement becomes significant by 1100 LST (Fig. 5a), with distinct maxima over the climatologically favored high terrain of the Mogollon Rim and SMO. The differences during midafternoon (Fig. 5b) grow and expand away from these ranges, consistent with the mechanisms advanced by Hales (1977), whereby convective activity is more likely to occur in the lower deserts of south-central Arizona and northwest Sonora due to steepened lapse rates and radiational cooling of cloud tops. Largest positive differences are centered over the southern portion of the SMO by early evening (0200 LST, Fig. 5d). Despite the small positive differences, the nighttime panels (Figs. 5e,f) indicate that local significance is essentially confined to extreme southwest Arizona, western Sonora, and the northern Gulf of California. These panels provide evidence of increased lightning counts enhanced in the western deserts of northwest Mexico and southwest Arizona during IV days.\n\nInterpretation of the CG and NARR precipitation and precipitable water data provide some insight into the role played by transient synoptic IV in modulating precipitation. The enhancement of accumulated precipitation during IV days can be as large as 3 mm over the desert regions. Over some regions, such as the low deserts of southwestern Arizona, the enhancement occurs over a prolonged period (0000–0600 UTC). When precipitation is accumulated over the 24-h day, the enhancement on IV days over background non-IV days can add up to 6 mm over the low deserts. Mountainous areas, such as the Mogollon Rim, also have statistically significant enhancements of this magnitude. These results suggest that transient IVs are conducive for increased precipitation over the bulk of the NAM region as well as an increased presence of precipitable water versus climatology (Fig. 6).\n\nIn view of the strong signal evident in the CG data, it is of interest to examine how IVs impact precipitation. The 0–3-h precipitation accumulations from the NARR fields were used to examine this signal from a broad perspective (Fig. 7). Although there is agreement on where and when both the CG and NARR difference fields achieve local significance (Figs. 5 and 7), there is an apparent physical discrepancy between the two fields in a few key places. For example, the CG composite has a significant local enhancement of lightning activity during IV days at 2100 UTC in western Sonora, whereas precipitation input for the NARR assimilation has a meager (if any) signal. The same inconsistency continues throughout the later hours (e.g., 0000 UTC, 0300 UTC, etc.) over western Sonora. Moreover, we observe similar differences near the Arizona–Sonora border region between the CG data and composites based on the 1° Climate Prediction Center (CPC) precipitation product (results not shown), which is the precipitation input during the NARR assimilation. So the result of physical discrepancies is not surprising. Alternatively, the discrepancy between the NDLN and NARR may, in good part, reflect actual physical differences if virga was more prevalent over the low deserts. Unfortunately, we do not have a quantitative estimate by how much the ratio of CG to total precipitation varies between high terrain and the low deserts. However, thermodynamic reasoning suggests that virga should, indeed, be relatively more frequent underneath the high-based convection of low-desert convection. This raises the general issue of the joint assimilation of CG and precipitation data for semiarid environments, one that is beyond the scope of this paper. It also points to the value of using NDLN data to document thunderstorm activity over the NAM region.\n\nb. Interannual variability\n\nAs already noted, the negative phase of the CPVM (see Castro et al. 2007b, their Fig. 4) is associated with a northward displacement of the monsoon ridge, an earlier monsoon onset, and wetter summer over Arizona, so it stands to reason that the occurrence of IV would be affected too. Therefore, it is of interest to quantify this relationship and estimate its statistical significance.\n\nClimatological track densities were compiled to diagnose the evolution of the transient IVs during a “typical” monsoon season. Figure 8 gives the seasonal evolution of the climatological IV track density at 15-day intervals, standardized over 17 years. During the early onset period of the NAM season of 4–18 June (Fig. 8a), the total number of IVs averages only 1 per year per 15 days, a much lower frequency compared to the monsoon peak (late July–early August). The low value reflects the monsoon easterlies not being established in early June; by definition and experimental design, transient IVs over the region must track equatorward of the subtropical ridge, so the absence of easterlies ensures no IVs. Despite the low values, a well-defined track axis is seen centered approximately along 22°N with maximum density near the mouth of the Gulf of California (Fig. 8a). The latitudinal variability in density is related in part to interannual (shown by the cooler colors) differences in the strength and position of the ridge. As the NAM develops and the easterlies become better established, the climatological track densities increase to their maximum value of about 2.8 IVs per year per 15 days from early July to early August (Figs. 8c,d). The maximum nudges northward, closer to the mouth of the Gulf of California. The shape of the track also changes from June to July, becoming more northwest–southeast oriented over southern Baja and sharper along its axis, in response to the 500-mb (Douglas et al. 1993) anticyclone moving its center from southeast Arizona to west-central Texas during the peak of the monsoon season. During the peak of the monsoon season (July to mid-August, Figs. 8c,e), a secondary density maximum develops over the western Gulf of Mexico with peak values of 1.8 IVs per year (Fig. 8d). The primary maximum west of Mexico and secondary maximum east of Mexico are suggestive of two possibilities: either IVs develop in situ downwind of the Mexican Plateau or they impinge against the Plateau from the east, lose their identity over the elevated terrain, then reorganize and strengthen over the west coast of Mexico. Either possibility implies an important role for leeside cyclogenesis in the track and development of IVs (e.g., Zehnder 1993). As the summer monsoon wanes (18 August–17 September, Fig. 8f), track densities decline in number and retreat southward as the easterlies weaken and subtropical anticyclone begins its preautumnal equatorward drift.\n\nA normalized difference of means IV track density between CPVM positive years and negative years (with associated local significance of 90% due to the use of subjectively analyzed data) is shown in Figs. 9a–f. Consistent with the increase in rainfall, when the CPVM index is negative (positive) there is a statistically significant increase in the number of transient IVs and a poleward shift of tracks during the monsoon onset and early part of the peak periods (Figs. 8a–d, late June through July). The regions that are most affected during the month of June are Texas, New Mexico, the Mexican states of Baja California Norte and Sur, and those Mexican states along 20°–22°N. In early July the statistically significant enhancement shifts poleward into New Mexico, Texas, and off the west coast of Baja California. While in late July the statistically significant enhancement is primarily in the northern part of the tier II region, mainly in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, this enhancement rapidly diminishes in August. These results are entirely consistent with the modeling results of Castro et al. (2007b) that, as mentioned, showed an enhancement in moisture flux convergence on a “synoptic” time scale of 4–15 days of the CPVM during July (Castro et al. 2007b, their Fig. 12).\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nAn aim of this study was to determine whether transient IVs could either enhance or interrupt the diurnal cycle of convection within the study region. When all hours over 1220 days (from 1 June 1 to 30 September in 1996–2005) were analyzed, it was determined that lightning counts during the hours from 1800 to 0900 UTC were significantly different than IV days (453 days) vis-à-vis days that were not (747 days). As a trough could be located anywhere within the lightning region, as well as within 4° latitude south of it, this suggests that IVs can influence upper-level dynamics over a large area (i.e., >102 km). The findings support the conclusions by Douglas and Englehart (2007), suggesting that these transient IVs were indeed important and can enhance convective rainfall.\n\nAn enhancement of convection in the western deserts of Arizona during most of the statistically significant hours (e.g., 1800–0900 UTC) of lightning and precipitation was noted during the study. According to the conclusions of Douglas and Leal (2003) and Higgins et al. (2004), such an anomaly in the diurnal cycle, typically phase locked to topographic influence, is normally in response to increased moisture from gulf surge events. In Fig. 12 of Douglas and Leal (2003), it is interesting to note that a midlevel cyclonic circulation near the mouth of the Gulf of California aided the gulf surge. The surface response a day before and the day of the surge was an anomalously strong southeastern flow that extended the entire length of the Gulf of California. This is in agreement with the findings of Higgins et al. (2004) who concluded that “wet” gulf surges were associated with diffluent flow into the states of Arizona and New Mexico and anomalously strong easterly flow (i.e., easterly waves). Rogers and Johnson (2007) documented that a gulf surge during NAME was associated with not only Tropical Storm Blas, but a strong north–south inverted trough at 200 mb located over northern Mexico. It was noted by both Rogers and Johnson (2007) and Pytlak et al. (2005) that upper-level divergence associated with the inverted trough aided in the development of convection over the Sierra Madre Occidental. As a result, an MCS formed over the region, and, with the aid of Tropical Storm Blas, the environment was primed for a gulf surge (Higgins et al. 2004). Further, Johnson et al. (2007) noted another “strong” gulf surge on 23 July2004 that was due to an upper-tropospheric low. Given the conclusions of three prior studies that stated that gulf surges were possibly associated with upper-tropospheric lows, it is reasonable to conclude that the enhancement of lightning noted in Fig. 4c in the southwestern deserts of Arizona and northwestern Mexico is likely associated with the same factors. However, the present temporal and spatial resolution of upper-air data in Mexico makes it extremely difficult to forecast these events.\n\nFrom a climatological standpoint, transient IVs tended to track over central Mexico and reach a maximum over the tip of southern Baja California (or the mouth of the Sea of Cortez). During CPVM negative years, though, transient IVs are more numerous during the months of June and July (by as much as one more IV per year) and take more northerly tracks. This likely resulted in more convection over the core monsoon region. Furthermore, knowing that the CPVM is negative could be an important climate diagnostic tool in determining whether the core NAM region will have an early onset as well as having more IVs and precipitation during the upcoming NAM season. Our future work will quantitatively test whether the CPVM may have value as a potential forecasting tool for NAM interannual variability. Also, detailed numerical modeling studies and/or climatological studies of IV events will be considered under different Pacific SST conditions to ascertain the relationship that these synoptic-scale features have to gulf surge events."
