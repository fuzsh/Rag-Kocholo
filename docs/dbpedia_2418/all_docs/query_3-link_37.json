        "text": "Rationale and objectives\n\nWe aimed to study the relationship between an endangered plant and multiple environmental variables as a case study for understanding the relationships between species of concern, extreme environmental change and invasive species impacts. Our study also highlights a case of coordinating ongoing conservation management with research among multiple agencies by monitoring the response of individuals that were outplanted along biophysical gradients that were perceived to be influential on the species’ survivorship.\n\n‘Ihi makole (Portulaca sclerocarpa; Fig. 1) is an endangered, low-growing succulent herb that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, being found only on the Island of Hawai‘i and one small islet off Lāna‘i (Stone et al. Reference Stone, Pratt and Yoshioka1994). The species grows in relatively dry environments at >900 m above sea level (Stone et al. Reference Stone, Pratt and Yoshioka1994). Previously found throughout much of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park, the plant’s population has been in sharp decline over the past several decades for reasons that have yet to be resolved. The species now occurs naturally at only two sites within Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park, and it has been outplanted at eight additional park sites. The largest population of P. sclerocarpa occurs at the Puhimau Thermal Area, a site with anomalously high soil temperatures, CO2 emissions and steam vents that formed around 1936, probably in response to magmatic intrusion beneath it (Jaggar 1938, McGee et al. Reference McGee, Sutton, Elias, Doukas and Gerlach2006). The Puhimau Thermal Area previously supported thousands of P. sclerocarpa, and over 900 were recorded there in 1994 (Pratt et al. Reference Pratt, VanDeMark and Euaparadorn2011). By 2008, the population had fallen to <300 individuals (Pratt et al. Reference Pratt, VanDeMark and Euaparadorn2011), and the drivers of this decline remained largely unknown. In response to continued population decline, the National Park Service started outplanting P. sclerocarpa at the Puhimau Thermal Area in 2017. Prior to 2017, P. sclerocarpa had been outplanted in a variety of other locations in the park, but survivorship of these outplantings has been extremely low (e.g., 16% after 3 years; Pratt et al. Reference Pratt, VanDeMark and Euaparadorn2011). None of these prior outplanting sites exhibited volcanic heat or gas emissions.\n\nIn the face of the extreme environmental change induced by volcanic activity, as well as the biological invasion of grasses and climate change, we sought to examine how interactions between these shifting biophysical variables might influence environmental conservation efforts for P. sclerocarpa. We hypothesized that invasive grasses would have a negative effect on P. sclerocarpa, as has been shown for other native Hawaiian species (e.g., D’Antonio et al. Reference D’Antonio, Hughes, Mack, Hitchcock and Vitousek1998, Cabin et al. Reference Cabin, Weller, Lorence, Cordell and Hadway2002, Denslow et al. Reference Denslow, Uowolo and Hughes2006), and that both grasses and P. sclerocarpa would be negatively affected by high soil temperatures, as has been shown for a variety of grasses, including some invasive species (James et al. Reference James, Sheley, Leger, Adler, Hardegree, Gornish and Rinella2019). Thus, we suspected that it would also be possible that we might find an indirect positive effect of soil temperature on P. sclerocarpa due to its negative effect on grasses. We also hypothesized that shallower soils would lead to greater mortality because they would be less able to hold water in such sites, which experience seasonal drought (many native plants in the Park have been threatened by recent droughts; Frazier et al. Reference Frazier, Deenik, Fujii, Funderburk, Giambelluca, Giardina, Vose, Peterson, Luce and Patel-Weynand2019). Finally, we thought that it was possible that founder identity could affect the mortality of outplants due to genetic differences (Helenurm Reference Helenurm1998). These hypotheses are summarized in Table 1.\n\nResults\n\nThe population abundance of wild P. sclerocarpa within the surveyed area of Puhimau decreased sharply over time, from 4322 individuals in 1984, to 970 individuals in 1993, to 13 confirmed living wild individuals as of September 2021 – a 99.7% decline in population size. Six of the 13 remaining wild individuals were newly recruited (and were first reported in 2021; they were not included in the analyses nor in Fig. 2). Of the 175 individuals that were outplanted at Puhimau (from 2017 to 2018), only 89 (50.9%) remained by 2021 (although this is much higher than the 16% survival rate observed 3 years after previous outplanting efforts; Pratt et al. Reference Pratt, VanDeMark and Euaparadorn2011).\n\nInterpolated soil temperatures across the Puhimau Thermal Area ranged from 18.9°C to 86.5°C in the 1990s (measured at 5cm depth) and from 19.3°C to 93.7°C in 2019 (measured at 20cm depth). Soil temperatures at wild P. sclerocarpa plants ranged from 30.4°C up to the maximum local temperature of 86.5°C in the 1990s (measured at 5cm depth). Soil temperatures at the locations of wild and outplanted P. sclerocarpa plants ranged from 38.8°C to 77.8°C in 2019, and soil temperatures farther away from P. sclerocarpa were up to 15.9°C hotter than any soil temperatures recorded in the 1990s, although this is probably due to the difference in the depth at which measurements were taken in different years. No P. sclerocarpa survived through 2021 at soil temperatures that were above 70°C in 2019 (Fig. 2 & Table S2). Portulaca sclerocarpa survivorship was highest (66.7%) at moderately high soil temperatures, ranging from 60°C to 70°C in 2019 (Fig. 2 & Table S2). Survival rates of the outplantings were also low (25%) in the lowest soil temperature range (<40°C), but these were the same locations where invasive grass cover was highest (>70%; Table S2).\n\nWe found the strongest binomial regression model predicting survivorship to include soil temperature, percentage invasive grass cover and their interaction (AICc 86.40; Table S1). The model found that for every degree Celsius increase in soil temperature, the likelihood of survival decreased by 19%. Similarly, for every one unit (percentage cover) increase in grass cover, the likelihood of survival decreased by 20% (Table 3). The model revealed a significant interaction between soil temperature and invasive grass cover (p = 0.007), but this interaction carried little weight, having an odds ratio of 1.004. We did not find an effect of founder on the survival of outplanted individuals (0.148 < p < 0.994 depending on founder with null deviance of 242.55 and 174 degrees of freedom), nor an effect of soil depth (p = 0.114 with null deviance of 102.53 and 73 degrees of freedom). Founder identity and soil depth were not included in the most parsimonious model.\n\nBecause soil temperature and invasive grass cover led to the strongest binomial regression model, these two predictor variables were further analysed through structural equation modelling. Soil temperature again exhibited a strong, positive effect on P. sclerocarpa survival (critical value 2.3677, p = 0.0179). Invasive grass cover had no detectable, direct effect on P. sclerocarpa mortality (critical value –0.9068, p = 0.3645). However, interpolated soil temperature also had a significantly strong, negative relationship with invasive grass cover (critical value –8.3509, p < 0.001), indicating that where soil temperatures were high (e.g., >65°C), invasive grass cover was low (Table 4).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe largest remaining population of wild P. sclerocarpa is in steep decline, while outplantings at the same site are also experiencing high rates of mortality over short time frames. Our study shows that high soil temperatures due to volcanic heat emissions are the most constraining factor on P. sclerocarpa survival from among those considered. Portulaca sclerocarpa survival was much higher at cooler soil temperatures, except when surrounded by >70% cover of invasive grasses. We planted P. sclerocarpa in very few plots with abundant invasive grass cover, limiting the power of our statistical analyses to quantitatively determine whether the grasses were a significantly limiting factor. Interestingly, soil temperature also had negative effects on invasive grass cover. Finding the ‘sweet spot’ where soil temperatures are low enough to allow P. sclerocarpa survival but high enough to decrease other constraints may increase P. sclerocarpa population growth in these volcanically active sites. Further research conducting tests in a controlled environment could help confirm and refine this theory.\n\nThe current study narrows in on which biophysical factors are important and which ranges of conditions support P. sclerocarpa. The lifespan of P. sclerocarpa has not been documented, although in this study we have confirmed that individuals have persisted for at least 4 years. The trends observed at Puhimau Thermal Area are reflective of other P. sclerocarpa outplanting sites in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park. The only other naturally occurring population that remains in the Park today has seen high mortality rates but existent (yet slow) recruitment. Although this other population does not experience the elevated ground temperatures and CO2 emissions that the Puhimau population does, it is adjacent to Kīlauea caldera, which has frequently been the site of eruptions and the associated release of volcanic SO2 (Elias et al. Reference Elias, Kern, Horton, Garbeil and Sutton2018). The 28 such eruptions over the past century (most recently 1982, 2008–2018, 2020–2021, 2021–present) lasted from <1 day to c. 10 years (Macdonald et al. Reference Macdonald, Abbott and Peterson1983, Kauahikaua & Mulliken Reference Kauahikaua and Mulliken2020, USGS 2020, 2021), each with variably strong degassing over the course of the activity. Prevailing wind conditions in the vicinity predominantly direct volcanic fumes from the caldera away from the site where this second natural P. sclerocarpa population is found, indicating that volcanic gases are less likely to negatively affect plants than at sites in the direct path of degassing events. The population adjacent to Kīlauea caldera is also more barren and does not have the same prevalence of invasive grasses as Puhimau, although plant cover and soil temperature surveys near Kīlauea caldera have not been conducted to quantify these differences. Access for conducting surveys of this population has been limited by the nearby volcanic activity.\n\nAlthough soil temperatures measured in the 1990s cannot be directly compared to the deeper soil temperature measurements of 2019, it is clear that the spatial pattern of soil temperatures at Puhimau Thermal Area has shifted over the last three decades. The locations of the hottest soil temperatures today are different from those in the 1990s, although we do not know how recently or quickly soil temperatures increased, and there may be a lag between these increased soil temperatures and the mortality of the plants. The distribution of P. sclerocarpa over the soil temperature gradient has shifted over the last three decades; although the plants used to occupy locations ranging from 19.3°C all the way up to the maximum temperature recorded at Puhimau, P. sclerocarpa now achieves >55% survivorship only in a middle temperature range (60–70°C – which is still high compared to soil temperatures without volcanic activity). Some of the plants survive at the low end of the soil temperature spectrum, but these cooler soils are often the same microsites where invasive grass abundance is now high. Our interpretation is that P. sclerocarpa may have found a niche where they can escape from other limiting factors in areas where high soil temperatures are intolerable for the grasses, but as volcanic heat emissions have continued to shift, some of these microsite conditions have become intolerably hot for P. sclerocarpa as well. No microsite apparently had soils too hot for P. sclerocarpa 30 years ago, but that is no longer the case.\n\nInvasive grass effects on P. sclerocarpa may also vary by site or ontogenetically. Prior data from a different site, Kalanaokuaiki Pali, where P. sclerocarpa was planted with and without invasive grass, showed no difference in survival but higher growth rates after 1 year when planted with invasive grasses (Pratt et al. Reference Pratt, VanDeMark and Euaparadorn2011). Kalanaokuaiki Pali has higher air temperatures and is somewhat drier than Puhimau, and it is possible that under more stressful conditions grasses could act as nurse plants and facilitate the species via shade (Callaway & Walker Reference Callaway and Walker1997, Gill et al. Reference Gill, Jarvis, Rogan and Kulakowski2020). A study from a geothermal area in Sonoma County, California, found that Dichanthelium lanuginosum var. thermale, a rare thermophilic grass that needs high soil temperatures to germinate, was also growing in areas with the same invasive grass as found in our study, A. virginicus (Pavlik & Enberg Reference Pavlik and Enberg2001). In that case, however, A. virginicus could only occupy sites where geothermal activity had lessened, while the native grass thrived on hotter soils. The rare native grass was not in refuge on hot soils (i.e., only being there because there was no invasive competitor) but because the soil facilitated its germination. This underlies why understanding the interacting mechanisms within a system will help predict outcomes for species of concern.\n\nInvasive grasses are not the only non-native plants at the Puhimau Thermal Area. Portulaca pilosa, another Portulaca species (introduced to Hawai‘i from the coastal plains of the south-eastern USA), is abundant at Puhimau (based on anecdotal observations), while the population of its relative is in steep decline. Researchers are able to distinguish P. sclerocarpa from P. pilosa primarily through the colouration of their flowers (white on P. sclerocarpa and purple on P. pilosa). The impact of the introduced species on P. sclerocarpa is unknown (Stone et al. Reference Stone, Pratt and Yoshioka1994). One possibility that has not been mentioned in the literature or explored through research to date is whether hybridization of the two species may be contributing to the lack of P. sclerocarpa recruitment. It is also possible that P. pilosa puts competitive pressure on P. sclerocarpa if the two species compete for the same niche. This has not been explicitly tested, but the species co-occur throughout Puhimau. However, in our dataset, P. pilosa was only present in 17 of 72 quadrats (23.6%) where we measured percentage cover of plant species. When present, P. pilosa accounted for an average cover of 4.6% within each quadrat, and its percentage cover or presence/absence was not found to be a significant explanatory variable for P. sclerocarpa mortality (p = 0.142 for cover, p = 0.158 for presence). Finally, it is possible that introduced rodents may be eating seed capsules and thus lowering seed set and recruitment (Pratt et al. Reference Pratt, VanDeMark and Euaparadorn2011), as has been shown for other endangered species in Hawai‘i (Shiels & Drake Reference Shiels and Drake2011, Pender et al. Reference Pender, Shiels, Bialic-Murphy and Mosher2013, Gill et al. Reference Gill, Yelenik, Banko, Dixon, Jaenecke and Peck2018).\n\nAlthough invasive species pose threats to native biodiversity (Simberloff Reference Simberloff2005), addressing the effect of a single invasion on its own may have little impact on the recovery of native plants when other stressors are at play (Gill et al. Reference Gill, Yelenik, Banko, Dixon, Jaenecke and Peck2018), possibly including other interacting invasive species (Simberloff & Von Holle Reference Simberloff and Von Holle1999, D’Antonio et al. Reference D’Antonio, Ostertag, Cordell and Yelenik2017, Yelenik et al. Reference Yelenik, Roy and Stallman2020, Reference Yelenik, Rose, Cordell, Victoria and Kellner2022, Gill et al. Reference Gill, Mahood, Meier, Muthukrishnan, Nagy and Stricker2021b). Our findings have refined our understanding of the factors contributing to the success and demise of P. sclerocarpa, although other factors may also be at play, such as the influence of P. pilosa, possible seed predation by (introduced) small mammals, loss of pollinators or dispersers (Pratt et al. Reference Pratt, VanDeMark and Euaparadorn2011) or a change in soil microbiota or chemistry due to altered plant communities. It is possible that invasive grasses have a direct competitive influence on P. sclerocarpa or an indirect effect such as providing habitat for small mammals (which predate P. sclerocarpa seeds). Alternatively, they could co-occur with soil microbiota or other (e.g., chemical) properties of the soil substrate that affect P. sclerocarpa. Management of valued plant species that are approaching extinction in the wild may benefit from efforts to identify which biophysical factors constrain success while treating multiple threats holistically rather than in isolation (Dávalos et al. Reference Dávalos, Nuzzo and Blossey2014, Bernardo et al. Reference Bernardo, Goad, Vitt and Knight2020, Yelenik et al. Reference Yelenik, Roy and Stallman2020). This presents a challenge because scientific enquiry often relies on the isolation of single variables; yet, for example, a study of multiple threats to four rare species in a New York forest found that the single and combined effects of stressors were species-specific (Dávalos et al. Reference Dávalos, Nuzzo and Blossey2014). Research that places the influence of isolated variables in the broader context of multiple potential threats can accelerate arrival at a fuller understanding of a threatened species’ needs (D’Antonio et al. Reference D’Antonio, Ostertag, Cordell and Yelenik2017, Bernardo et al. Reference Bernardo, Goad, Vitt and Knight2020). Such an approach is important for informed decision-making in the face of extreme environmental change."
