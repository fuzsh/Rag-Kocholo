        "text": "The Pacific Islands region is defined here as HawaiÊ»i and the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI). The USAPI comprises the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI); the unincorporated territories of American SÄmoa, Guam, and the Pacific Remote Islands (PRI); and the Freely Associated States (FAS): the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and the Republic of Palau. The region spans a vast geography and encompasses over 2,000 islands, ranging from small low-lying atolls to large volcanic islands, with the highest peak rising to 13,803 feet (Figures 30.1, 30.2). Marine and terrestrial biodiversity and species endemism are exceptionally high. These islands (excluding FAS) total only 14,060 square miles in land area but define nearly half (47.2%) of the entire US exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The islands also support more than two dozen defense installations key to US security, including the headquarters for the US Indo-Pacific Command. As a consequence of colonization, the lands, waters, and peoples of the Pacific Islands were significantly involved in World War II,11 resulting in widespread environmental devastation, displacement of Indigenous Peoples, and nuclear weapons testing.12,13,14\n\nThe 1.9 million people who call the region home are predominantly (more than 77%) Pacific Islanders, many of whom are Indigenous Peoples (CHamoru, Chuukese, Kosraean, Marshallese, Native Hawaiian, Palauan, Pohnpeian, Samoan, Yapese, and others)âwho speak more than 20 Indigenous languages15âand members of diverse communities of Asian heritage. Population is declining on all islands (except HawaiÊ»i) and is increasingly urban.16,17,18,19,20,21,22 Important economic sectors include tourism, agriculture, and fishing, with government assistance, foreign direct investment, and remittances as major sources of capital. Average per capita income ranges from a high of 124% above the US average in HawaiÊ»i to 4%â20% in the FAS.22,23,24 Governance arrangements across the islands vary, but all share histories of colonization that contribute to structural inequities and vulnerabilities that exacerbate the social and economic impacts of climate change (Box 30.1).14,25\n\nClimate Variability and Change\n\nThe El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (KMs 2.1, 3.3) are dominant sources of climate variability in the Pacific Islands region, affecting rainfall, air and ocean temperature, sea surface height, and trade winds (Box 27.1 in Keener et al. 201838).30,39,40,41 ENSO and other sources of climate variability interact with climate change to reduce or amplify trends and their impacts on decadal and shorter timescales. Natural variability in sea level and tides, for example, affects tidal flooding experienced at various Pacific Island locations.42,43,44\n\nBetween 1951 and 2020, annual average air temperatures across the Pacific Islands region increased 2Â°F (1Â°C).45,46 End-of-century projections indicate up to 4.5Â°F (2.5Â°C) higher temperatures at high elevations (above 9,800 feet) for an intermediate scenario (RCP4.5) and up to 9Â°F (5Â°C) under a very high scenario (RCP8.5).47 Historical precipitation trends are variable across the region, with some islands seeing long-term drying and increases in drought frequency, severity, and duration (KM 4.1).48,49,50 The magnitude and direction of projected precipitation changes are currently highly uncertain (Figure 30.3); some areas are projected to experience drying (e.g., leeward [western] areas of HawaiÊ»i;51 KM 2.1), while increases in precipitation are expected for others (e.g., American SÄmoa).52\n\nAlthough the findings are uncertain and geographically diverse, current analyses indicate that the frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease,53 but associated wind speeds, rainfall rates, and storm surge heights are projected to increase across the entire region (KM 2.2).53,54,55,56,57\n\nThe rate of increase in regional sea surface temperatures (SSTs) has exceeded global rates, while ocean acidification (declining ocean pH)58 in the region has reached levels not seen over the past 30 years.59 These region-wide changes are projected to continue over the remainder of this century,60 with dire consequences for coral reef ecosystems (KM 10.1).61,62 Relative sea level rise (SLR) rates vary across the Pacific region,63 with the highest SLR rates observed in the western Pacific.64 With warming above 3.6Â°F (2Â°C), SLR projections of 3.5 to 7.5 feet by 2100 are increasingly possible (Figure 30.4; KM 9.1).65\n\nIncreasingly Severe Climate Impacts Are Causing Cascading Impacts for People\n\nAll Pacific Island communities are experiencing climate change impacts and, in some cases, facing existential risks (Figure 30.5). Sea level rise is compromising critical infrastructure and threatens to displace populations on low-lying atolls, forcing migration and disrupting social relationships (KMs 9.1, 9.2, 9.3). The vast majority of ports, airports, primary roads, power plants, and water treatment plants are located a few feet above sea level. Ports bring in 80%â100% of all consumer goods (including food and medical supplies) and 100% of fuel,67 placing the islands at the end of long supply chains and making them extremely susceptible to disruptions (Ch. 23). Climate change increasingly affects the lands and waters of the region crucial for sustaining primary economic and cultural livelihoods, including tourism, agriculture, fishing, forestry, and artisan practices (KMs 10.2, 18.1, 19.1, 23.2). These effects exacerbate structural inequities (KMs 20.1, 31.2).68,69 Climate change poses risks to the regionâs rich biodiversity, including many threatened and endangered species, that supports functioning ecosystems and cultural practices (KMs 8.2, 16.1). Table 30.1 illustrates examples of impacts across the region for each of the chapterâs Key Messages related to water and food, human health, the built environment, ecosystems, and cultural and historical resources.\n\nTable 30.1. Illustrative Climate ChangeâRelated Impacts Across the Pacific Islands Region\n\nJurisdiction\n\nKM 30.1:\n\nWater and Food\n\nKM 30.2:\n\nHuman Health\n\nKM 30.3:\n\nBuilt Environment\n\nKM 30.4:\n\nEcosystems\n\nKM 30.5:\n\nCultural and Historical Resources American SÄmoa Increased extreme precipitation events degrade drinking water quality by stressing the water systemsâ filtration capacity (KM 4.2).70,71 Hot weather worsens chronic health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes, already at emergency levels (KM 15.1).72 Climate change threatens fisheries and impacts economic infrastructure, including canneries.73 Climate change promotes invasive species spread in native rainforests, home to rare and culturally important plants.29 Coastal flooding affects villages that contain burials of relatives and ancestors.74 Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Access to safe drinking water is threatened as climate change exacerbates ongoing challenges of disposal of military, industrial, and municipal waste.27 Super Typhoon Yutu in 2018 negatively impacted mental health and healthcare providers.75 Two successive typhoons (2015 and 2018) damaged or destroyed significant portions of the built environment.27 Climate change aids species invasions, which threaten the high biodiversity in wetlands and forests, including endemic birds, threatened reptiles, and two species of bats.27,76 Coastal historical and cultural sites are exposed to SLR.27 Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) Warmer temperatures and saltwater intrusion are projected to increase disease in staple crops such as taro, bananas, and breadfruit.77 Changes to marine and coastal habitats threaten artisanal fisheries, a key protein source.78,79,80,81,82,83 In FSM, 59% of infrastructure (89% of population) is within 0.3 miles (0.6 km) of the coast and vulnerable to coastal climate impacts.84,85 Highly valued mangrove forests in Pohnpei will be threatened by SLR.86 Coastal menâs houses (faluw) are exposed to SLR and can benefit from historical adaptation measures.87 Guam Northern Guam Lens Aquifer is at risk from hotter weather, drought, and possible increases in demand.28,88 In 2018â2019, compound extreme events (flash flooding followed by drought and wildfire) negatively impacted human health (safety, pathogens, and respiratory issues).28 Stronger tropical cyclones around Guam will increase the potential for severe damage to the built environment.53 Increased frequency of coral bleaching89 and increased risk of wildfires are expected.28 Many cultural and historical resources located along the coast will be impacted by 3 feet of SLR.90 HawaiÊ»i Increasing drought is reducing available water supplies.49 Hot weather causes heat-related illness and increases hospitalizations (KM 15.1).91 3.2 feet of SLR would cause $23.1 billion in economic loss (in 2022 dollars).92 Warming at higher elevations will expand transmission of avian malaria, causing declines in endemic bird populations.93,94 Strong winds, large storm waves, SLR, and changes in groundwater impact fishponds throughout HawaiÊ»i.95,96,97 Pacific Remote Islands (PRI) Decreasing precipitation and salinization from SLR are reducing freshwater availability.98 The possibility of disappearing islands contributes to distress due to loss of identity and relationship with place (solastalgia).99 US military installations and low-lying islets are at risk from SLR, which may impact exclusive economic zones.98 The 2014â2016 El NiÃ±o bleached over 90% of monitored reefs in Palmyra Atoll.100 Sea level rise threatens remote islands and megafauna connected to the Native Hawaiian culture and creation story.101,102 Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) During the 2015â2016 extreme El NiÃ±o drought, the northern atolls established freshwater âfilling stationsâ for water access.103 Sea level rise threatens health infrastructure,104 and migration harms mental health.105 Highly urbanized atolls may not be able to adapt to future SLR, leading to land loss and potential uninhabitability.98,106,107,108 Tuna catch within the exclusive economic zone is projected to decline by 10%â40% by 2050 relative to the early 2000s under a very high scenario (RCP8.5).109 Graves in the JenrÅk neighborhood on Majuro were lost to coastal erosion.110 Republic of Palau Climate change affects the timing of when crops are traditionally planted, which impacts food security.111 Mental health challenges arise from degradation of places and ecosystems essential to ocean-centered culture and livelihoods (Box 30.3; KM 15.1).112 Migration to and development in Koror's coastal zone exposes more people to SLR; king tides already flood urban areas.113 The strong 2015â2016 El NiÃ±o reduced the jellyfish population in Palau's Jellyfish Lake.113 High tides and SLR submerged and damaged Kukau el Bad, a historic healing ritual site in Ollei, Ngarchelong.113\n\nMitigation and Adaptation Through Indigenous Knowledge Systems, Collective Action, and Planning\n\nEffective climate mitigation and adaptation measures for Pacific Islanders and Indigenous Peoples are grounded in local ecological knowledge, which promotes intergenerational and holistic stewardship approaches,114,115 and best available Western science (KM 18.3). Indigenous ways of knowing can revitalize resilient practices and confront environmental injustices (KMs 16.3, 31.2).14 Examples of Indigenous Knowledgeâinformed adaptation include agroforestry, wetland taro agriculture, fishponds, and fisheries rules such as rest periods.116,117,118,119 Mangrove and seagrass conservation and regenerative agriculture demonstrate high potential for carbon sequestration (KM 30.4).120,121,122\n\nCollective action in the region is codified in pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the Local2030 Islands Network and Micronesia Challenge (Box 30.2; KM 20.2). Climate literacy may help spur collective action and build social capacity to address climate-driven changes (KM 32.5). Climate changeâfocused education and outreach programming in the Pacific Islands region is diverse and extends across federal, state, and county levels, nongovernmental organizations, and Indigenous-serving organizations (e.g., Bolden et al. 2018; Frungillo et al. 2022; HWMO 2021; Longman et al. 2022; USGS 2021123,124,125,126,127). Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander epistemologies are woven into many programs (KM 16.2).128,129\n\nChanging Climate Threatens Freshwater Resources\n\nDependable and safe freshwater resources and associated services in tropical islands are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures (KM 4.1), altered rainfall patterns (Figure 30.3), runoff intensity and flooding, reduced groundwater recharge, and SLR (Figure 30.4; KM 4.2). Depletion of island aquifers compounds the potential for saltwater intrusion from SLR.98,135,136 The availability of surface water for irrigation, drinking water, and hydropower is affected by increasing frequency and severity of flooding and by reductions in stream baseflow;137 water contamination through increased Staphylococcus sp., Leptospira (a waterborne pathogenic bacteria), fecal coliform bacteria, and suspended sediment (KM 15.1);138,139,140,141 and extreme drought (KM 2.2).103 In response to these changes, adaptation-focused restoration techniques are being applied, including revegetating with native species, reducing impervious surfaces, and redundant water distribution systems. Climate-induced land-cover change can have significant control over groundwater recharge, indicating that land-use adaptation is viable for managing impacts on water resources (KM 6.1).142,143 Flood frequency is projected to increase across the region,70 while drought frequency is projected to vary across the region (KMs 2.2, 4.1).27,28,29,113\n\nChanges Undermine the Sustainability of Water Supplies\n\nPacific Islands potable water supplies depend heavily on accessing clean groundwater or rain catchments, while other needs, such as irrigation, are often met with surface water resources. Groundwater recharge is affected by annual or longer-scale climate processes, while surface water supplies are more sensitive to shorter-term climatic influences.144,145,146,147,148 Although few studies assess regional changes in drought, evidence is clear that HawaiÊ»i has experiencedÂ a drying trend since the 1950s and in La NiÃ±a years.149,150 On atolls and low-lying islands, freshwater aquifers typically occur as very thin lenses and are highly sensitive to groundwater extraction and SLR-driven saltwater intrusion.135,136 Shifting rainfall patterns and runoff conditions are affecting the availability of surface water to meet growing demands.103 Climate change has elevated region-wide efforts to protect and conserve freshwater resources. Communities that rely heavily on rain-fed catchments and surface water are acutely susceptible to short-term and, in particular, long-term drought and the resulting reductions in streamflow.103\n\nSalinization and Pollutants Deteriorate Water Quality\n\nIncreased intensity of extreme rainfall events, coupled with SLR, is projected to exacerbate freshwater contamination risks.151 Past and ongoing disposal of military, industrial, agricultural, and municipal waste contaminates island water supplies.35,152 Although SLR-driven mobilization of subsurface contaminants has received little study in the Pacific Islands, evidence of diverse groundwater contaminants in the region153 and their mobilization154,155 raises concerns for low-lying island aquifers (KM 4.2). Salt is a critical freshwater contaminant; wave-driven overwash135,136,156 and SLR-induced rise of the freshwaterâsaltwater transition zone157,158,159,160 cause salinization and saltwater intrusion.\n\nChanges in the frequency, severity, and duration of drought, associated fires, and flooding all interact to exacerbate sediment loading to streams.103,161 Given the short ridge-to-reef distances in the region, sensitive nearshore coral ecosystems and fisheries are directly impacted by increased sediment and pollutant loads to streams,162 compromising biodiversity, subsistence practices, and economies (KM 9.2).162,163,164\n\nFood Systems Disrupted\n\nClimate change will increasingly impact food production, transport, processing, packaging, storage, retail, consumption, and waste for Pacific Island communities (KMs 11.2, 13.1). The aforementioned challenges will disrupt imports reliant on fragile supply chains and reduce viability of local agriculture and fisheries, thus reducing access to nutritious foods.31,165,166,167,168,169 Fisheries are the principal protein sources for many Pacific Islanders, with locally grown staple food crops such as bananas, taro, breadfruit, and sweet potato supplying critical calories and nutrients.170,171,172 However, Pacific Island communities have increasingly relied on imported foods, which come with complex and sometimes hidden environmental, financial, social, cultural, and nutritional costs (KM 30.2).173,174 COVID-19 and previous disasters exposed the fragility of global supply chains (Focus on Risks to Supply Chains) and emphasized the need to bolster local food production capacity to increase resilience.166,167,175,176\n\nDeclining Fisheries\n\nThe global capacity of coral reefs to supply fish has declined by half since the 1950s, a change that climate stressors have exacerbated (KM 9.2)62,177,178,179,180 through coral bleaching, acidification, SLR (Figure 30.4), terrestrial sediment, and contaminants (Box 30.3).78,79,181,182 Small-scale coral reef fisheries supply Pacific Island communities with a substantial portion (in some cases 50% to 90%) of their dietary protein and important micronutrients.82,172,177,183,184,185,186 Warming waters, acidification, and deoxygenation redistribute open-ocean fish stocks, and fisheries catch within regional EEZs is projected to decline by up to 40% by 2050 relative to the early 2000s under a very high scenario (RCP8.5; KM 10.1).109 Fishing fleets are ill-equipped to adapt to this deficit (KM 10.2).81,187 Warming, extreme events, acidification, and SLR may also compromise efforts to expand mariculture (marine farming), through damage to aquaculture systems,188 decreased species richness,189 and decreased local access to nearshore and open-ocean species.190,191,192\n\nAgriculture\n\nCrop production in the USAPI has generally kept up with population growth over the past 20 years.165,173 Although local agriculture provides a fraction of nutritional needs in the region,165 it remains a critical food source, complementing imported foods, serving as an emergency food source, providing culturally important items, and supplementing household income and government revenue.196,197\n\nClimate change is projected to impact island food systems through a variety of different mechanisms (KMs 11.1, 23.3).77 Warmer nighttime temperatures and saltwater intrusion, especially in FSM and RMI, are projected to increase damage from disease on staple crops such as taro, bananas, and breadfruit.77,198 Cash crops are also likely to be affected, with higher temperatures and increased plant pathogens decreasing coffee yields, increased flooding depressing sugar yields, and higher winds damaging coconut palms, bananas, and breadfruit.191 In HawaiÊ»i, droughts have become longer and more severe and are the principal cause of crop loss.49\n\nAdaptation Strategies to Improve Local Food System Resilience\n\nStrategies are being developed and implemented across the region to revitalize healthier traditional food systems, resulting in more just access to food (KM 11.2).117,118,165,199 Subsistence-based food system practices such as agroforestry and fishing have sustained Pacific Island peoples for millennia and have aided in recoveries from natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis.119,171,200,201 Restoring Indigenous agroecology practices can support conservation, food security, and broader sociocultural objectives in the face of shifting precipitation and SLR (e.g., Bremer et al. 2018; Winter et al. 2020202,203). Community food-sharing networks that empowered the most overburdened to overcome economic and social hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic offer a model for resilient food systems in the face of climate change.175,204,205 Promising fisheries adaptations include establishing networks of marine protected areas to preserve coastal resources, safeguarding fish habitats from pollution runoff, and restoring traditional fishpond mariculture (KM 10.3; e.g., Bell et al. 2013; McLeod et al. 2019; Farmery et al. 202273,116,119).\n\nClimate change can degrade societal foundations of health and well-being, including access to shelter, nutritious food, clean water, and cultural and social relationships (KM 15.1). Prominent international frameworks and Pacific Island Indigenous conceptualizations of health and well-being recognize that the health of people is closely connected to the health of nonhuman beings, to the shared environment, and to place (Figure 16.3).209,210,211,212\n\nIndigenous communities of the Pacific Islands have actively responded to climate-related and other health risks, as well as external economic shocks (Box 30.3; KM 16.3).119,205 However, colonization and economic disparities have resulted in disproportionately high rates of morbidity and mortality for Native Hawaiian and Indigenous Pacific Island peoples (KM 15.2).213 Moreover, Pacific Island populations experienced severe economic shocks during the COVID-19 pandemic (KM 30.3),214 which interacted with existing societal and non-climate stressors that worsen health inequities (KM 18.2).\n\nThe Health Impacts of Extreme Events\n\nTropical cyclone intensity,53,215,216 drought frequency,150,217 and flood potential (KMs 30.3, 2.2)70,98,218,219 are expected to increase and continue to aggravate social and geographic inequities (KMs 2.2, 4.2, 10.1, 16.1, 17.4).53,98 Extreme weather impacts health in ways that persist beyond the initial disaster,220,221 including increases in food- and waterborne pathogens, loss of access to medications and emergency services, loss of electricity needed for medical equipment and medical facilities, and disruptions to transportation networks, all of which increase illnesses and deaths (KM 15.1).222 Healthcare facilities in the Pacific Islands are located primarily on coastlines, making them especially susceptible to tropical cyclones and SLR-driven flooding (KM 9.2),104,223 with limited space and resources for relocation (KM 30.3).\n\nThe built environment is especially affected by extreme weather because of high costs of building materials, supply shortages, delays in code updates, and physical isolation (Figure 30.8; KM 30.3).224 Given the limited emergency infrastructure and evacuation options, extreme weather events create high risks for the mental and physical health of island populations, with individuals with low-income, older adults, children, and persons with disabilities at disproportionately higher risk (Box 15.1).26,225,226,227\n\nDrought poses health challenges, particularly for rural island populations. A 2013 drought in the northern atolls of RMI caused crop failures and unsafe and insufficient water supplies, which led to nutritional deficits and increased prevalence of infectious diseases, especially in children.103,228 Severe wildfires, which occur primarily during droughts,229,230,231 directly threaten health and safety and can create respiratory hazards (KM 14.2).232\n\nHealth-Associated Impacts from Migration\n\nUnder a very high scenario (RCP8.5), human migration will increase due to SLR-driven inundation and salinization, displacing people, even entire populations, from low-lying atolls and low-elevation areas of high islands, with enormous implications for health and well-being (KMs 15.1, 17.1, 20.3).98,105 Migrants often have difficulty navigating foreign healthcare systems233 and face other barriers to accessing healthcare, including ineligibility for federal programs.234 An improved understanding of the experiences and health outcomes of people who migrate, within or away from the USAPI, could inform better policy.\n\nMental Health Consequences and Climate Grief\n\nClimate change directly and indirectly affects the mental health of Pacific Islanders.235,236,237 On some islands globally, local climate stressors (such as floods, droughts, and SLR) are linked with negative mental health outcomes such as sadness, distress, and anger (KM 15.1).238,239,240 Across the Pacific region, studies show that rural populations, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and people with disabilities experience more severe mental health consequences from various climate impacts (KM 15.2).105,239,240,241,242\n\nResearch is limited on the mental health impacts of climate-induced migration. Instability caused by voluntary and involuntary migration is expected to be a continuing source of anxiety,99 although evidence indicates that social cohesion and reducing disparities can counter negative impacts.105,243 Some data show that distress from thinking about climate stressors can be comparable to that from experiencing direct impacts.239 Additionally, because Indigenous People in the Pacific are strongly connected to place, and place is central to conceptions of cultural identity, sudden ecological devastation or gradual change to the environment can create considerable stress (KMs 10.1, 15.1, 15.2, 23.1, 29.1).99\n\nMental health services related to climate change show effectiveness when they are designed to serve Pacific Islander populations in a culturally centered way and include diverse ways of knowing.235,243,244 Finally, the lack of studies on mental health and climate change in HawaiÊ»i and the USAPI indicates that additional research may provide a more nuanced understanding of local implications.Â\n\nIncrease in Vector-Borne Disease\n\nOutbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are increasing in frequency, extent, and duration across the region.245,246 Changes in rainfall (Figure 30.3) and temperature, combined with environmental and demographic changes, are anticipated to exacerbate this trend.34,247 Resources for vector control and managing outbreaks are limited on small tropical islands, and outbreaks sometimes overwhelm health systems.245,247 Health officials in FSM, RMI, and Palau are developing predictive modeling to create a dengue early warning system.248 Similar to how chikungunya and Zika recently emerged and expanded in the Pacific, other vector-borne diseases may emerge in the future.249\n\nHigh Temperatures and Heat-Related Illness and Death\n\nAs in much of the US (Figure 2.11), the number of hot days has increased across the Pacific Islands; 2020 was the regionâs hottest year on record.27,28,29,45,113Â A community heat assessment in OÊ»ahu, HawaiÊ»i, in August 2019 found many neighborhoods with record-high afternoon heat indicesÂ between 100Â°F (38Â°C) and 107Â°F (42Â°C) (Figure 30.9).250,251\n\nClimate changeâdriven hot weather causes heat-related illness and increases hospitalizations and deaths; 82% of heat-related deaths in Honolulu are already attributable to climate change (KM 15.1).252 Those more likely to experience heat-related illness includeÂ young children, older adults, outdoor workers, economically burdened and disadvantaged people with little access to cooling or healthcare (KM 15.1), military personnel whose duties require heavy gear and vigorous activity, and non-acclimated visitors.91 Shock events interact with heat: for example, after the 2009 tsunami in American SÄmoa, dehydration, heat stress illnesses, and barriers to receiving medical care increased.253\n\nImported low-quality foods have replaced local, nutritious, traditional diets (KM 30.1), resulting in some of worldâs highest prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).165,190,199,254,255 Heat worsens health outcomes for people withÂ NCDs such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes256 and creates challenges for the management of obesity and other diseases because exercise is more difficult to do safely.Â Overweight and obesity in young children are at a higher prevalence in American SÄmoa, CNMI, and Guam than globally.257\n\nSocial Adaptive Capacity and Community Resilience\n\nThe ability of individuals, communities, and institutions to endure stress and adapt to change determines health impacts of climate change. Recent examples demonstrating the importance of social capital (such as community networks, equitable access to education [KM 15.3], sharing, and relationships) in disaster response include community initiatives addressing flooding on the island of KauaÊ»i258 and drought in RMI.259Â Traditional Knowledge and coping strategies can enhance adaptive capacity and disaster response in some contexts.260,261,262,263 The resilience of organizations, including health-related institutions and disaster response systems, depends on the ability of organizations to form relationships and communicate with one another, participation by traditional leaders and faith organizations, and effective planning by disaster management agencies (KMs 16.2, 20.2).227,264,265,266,267 Prioritizing social and mental health initiatives in the health sector would aid in responding to the psychological issues that emerge with disasters and climate change.268\n\nBuilt Environment\n\nThe built environment refers to all human-made structures, including buildings, transportation infrastructure (ports, airports, roads, and bridges), military installations, and distribution systems for food, water, wastewater, communications, and power (electrical, oil, and gas). For this region, it includes traditional structures such as burial grounds, fishponds, and taro terraces (KM 30.5). These structures are critical to connecting people and providing access to goods and services, yet their location within a few feet of sea level renders them particularly vulnerable to SLR (Figure 30.4) and natural disasters (KM 9.2). For example, 98% of RMIâs and 80% of Palauâs built infrastructure is located within approximately 1,600 feet of their coastlines.85\n\nImpacts to Infrastructure\n\nSea level rise will increasingly impact coastal infrastructure through increased magnitude and duration of storm waveâinduced flooding (KMs 2.2, 9.1),98,219,269 rising high tides,270 and increased coastal erosion (Figure 30.10).271 In HawaiÊ»i, 3.2 feet of SLR above 2000 levels, which could occur as soon as 2100 under the Intermediate SLR scenario or 2070 under the High scenario (for information on the likelihood of these scenarios, see Appendix 3; Figure 30.4),65 would affect 550 cultural sites, 38 miles (6%) of major coastal roads, 6,500 structures, and 25,800 acres of land, potentially displacing 20,000 residents and incurring $23.1 billion (in 2022 dollars) in economic loss.92 Approximately 3 feet of SLR is projected to affect at least 58% of Guamâs built environment90 and most atolls in FSM and RMI.98 Highly urbanized atolls may not be able to adapt to future SLR (KMs 9.2, 12.2),106,107 leading to land loss and potential uninhabitability.98,108 Elevated SSTs can increase bleaching and degradation of coral reefs, which are some islandsâ primary natural defenses (Figure 30.11; KM 30.4) against coastal flooding.272 Lastly, increased flooding and erosion due to SLR and stronger future cyclones threaten US military bases in the region, potentially destabilizing regional security and the ability of the Department of Defense to respond to natural disasters (KM 17.1).53\n\nArt × Climate\n\nJ. Matt\n\nStructure Failure on Oâahu in the Global Warming Era\n\n(2022, photography)\n\nArtist’s statement: The Ke Nui structure failure illustrates the complexity of coastal climate politics. The owners are native Hawaiians who have kept the building in the family for five generations â descendants of a thriving kingdom overthrown under threat of U.S. arms. Receding coastlines will force reckoning with not only issues of historical Indigenous exploitations and wealth concentration but also community, individual, and statesâ rights pertaining to physically indefensible coastal private property. Without a coastal action plan, property ownersÂ in HawaiâiÂ rely on illegal courses of action when responding to catastrophes such as this one.\n\nView the full Art × Climate gallery.\n\nArtworks and artists’ statements are not official Assessment products.\n\nAdapting the Built Environment\n\nProtecting coastal infrastructure on small islands is costly and requires strong governance and thoughtful urban planning.273 HawaiÊ»i has enacted forward-looking state and county policies, including increased minimum setbacks for coastal development,274,275,276 setbacks incorporating science-based erosion rates and long-planning horizons that account for future SLR,275,277,278,279 a first-in-the-Nation mandate to disclose SLR hazards prior to real estate transactions,280 a requirement for state agencies to assess and plan for SLR impacts,281 and a mandate that environmental impact assessments consider SLR and other climate factors.282 While evaluating a balance between public and private property interests (KM 30.5), HawaiÊ»i is also assessing the feasibility of relocating some coastal developments,283 prohibiting most coastal hardening,274 and helping to preserve public beach access.283\n\nNature-based solutions such as coral reef restoration284,285 have been proposed at the federal (DARPA Reefense Program),286 state (e.g., State of HawaiÊ»i 2021287), and territorial288 levels. Such solutions are potentially cost effective for protecting coastal infrastructure289 and habitats, sustaining ecosystem services such as fisheries (KM 30.1), and supporting tourism and recreation.290\n\nLivelihoods and Economy\n\nDemographics and Migration\n\nCompared to HawaiÊ»i, the USAPI have smaller populations and smaller land masses, as well as fewer financial resources, making adaptation more challenging. During 2010â2020, populations increased in HawaiÊ»i and decreased in American SÄmoa, CNMI, Guam, and Palau.16,17,18,19,20,21 Pacific Islanders are moving from rural to more urban areas that sometimes lack resources and infrastructure to accommodate influxes of people.273,292 Migration is a traditional strategy for coping with resource scarcity in Micronesiaâfor example, a family member often migrates to an urban area for employment, sending money home to support family needs.293 In 2020, these external remittances accounted for 5.7% of FSMâs GDP, 0.08% of Palauâs GDP, and 12.7% of RMIâs GDP.294,295,296 As livelihoods in climate-sensitive sectors are impacted by climate change, the amount of money migrants send to relatives will be affected. Climate change may displace populations,297 but the extent to which climate change drives migration is not well established because migration is an inherent part of Pacific Island cultures.298 However, some evidence points to a strong correlation between climate impacts on ecosystem services (e.g., food and water provision, protection against floods and storms) and peopleâs propensity to migrate.299\n\nEconomy\n\nThe costs of adapting to, mitigating, and suffering the consequences of climate change are projected to increase over time, amounting to between 3% and 13% (under the 450ppm and SRES [Special Report on Emission Scenarios] A1FI scenarios, respectively) of Pacific Island regional GDP by 2100 (KM 19.1).300 Relative to HawaiÊ»i and larger countries, USAPI economies have smaller total GDPs and GDP-per-capita and higher dependence on fisheries and agricultureâclimate-sensitive industries representing a large portion of GDP.301 They also are more dependent on remittances, federal aid, and foreign aid (KM 17.1).302,303\n\nTourism is a major economic engine in the Pacific.304 Before COVID-19, tourism accounted for over 80% of total exports for Palau and less than 20% for RMI305 and approximately 25% of total GDP in HawaiÊ»i. Climate change impacts tourism-based jobs and revenue. Damages to the built environment, especially coastal infrastructure, deterioration of natural assets, and expanding vector-borne disease occurrence could reduce tourism.300\n\nFishing is a critical economic sector in many Pacific Islands.178,306 Tuna license revenues represent a significant source of government income for the FAS but are expected to decline due to projected changes in fish availability in the EEZs (KMs 10.1, 10.2),79,80,81,83,306 with ramifications for local canneries in American SÄmoa and the FAS. Changing coastlines and potential land loss from SLR may result in changed maritime entitlements via changes in the size and shape of the respective EEZs,306 affecting not just fisheries but also marine mineral rights. Climate-related marine and coastal habitat impacts threaten artisanal fisheries, a critical source of food and income for many households (KMs 30.1, 10.1, 10.2).78,82,178,184\n\nEstimated Economic Costs of Climate Change\n\nThe estimated economic impacts of climate change will vary by sector. Coastal hazards have a disproportionately large impact on small islandsâ GDPs.307 Specifically, the projected increased duration and magnitude of storm waveâinduced flooding98,219,269 and increased coastal erosion271 can damage infrastructure underpinning the local economy. Degradation of coral reefs due to a rise in SSTs272 could incur coastal damages costing approximately $1.2 billion (in 2022 dollars) annually to the economies of HawaiÊ»i and the US Pacific territories.218\n\nIn American SÄmoa and Guam, coastal flooding and erosion are projected to disproportionately harm at-risk individuals, including minority and low-income populations and those younger than 16 or older than 65 (groups defined by the 2010 US Census data).218 High-risk coastal properties (i.e., those located in hazard-erosion areas of updated FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps) will be difficult to insure.308 Increased coastal flooding events and drought are expected to negatively impact agricultural revenues (KM 30.1). For example, between 2008 and 2016, Hawaiâi lost approximately $53.5 million (in 2022 dollars) in cattle production due to the most severe drought on record, and federal crop insurance programs paid $11.2 million (in 2022 dollars) to farmers for drought losses during 1996â2018, mainly for macadamia nuts and coffee.49\n\nAdapting Livelihoods and Economies\n\nAs a percentage of GDP, the costs of climate change adaptation are significantly higher for small islands than for larger countries.300,309 Islandsâ geographic isolation, reliance on imported goods, and vulnerable infrastructure can increase adaptation and disaster recovery costs (see Figure 30.8).224 HawaiÊ»i and the USAPI have adopted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (Box 30.2)130 to increase resilience by creating more equitable approaches to adaptation and mitigation. Financing costly climate adaptation is a shared international challenge for the FAS (KM 17.4).300,301 Unlike American SÄmoa, CNMI, Guam, and HawaiÊ»i, the sovereign FAS are eligible for foreign direct investment and receive substantial funding from the Green Climate Fund,310 the Asian Development Bank,311,312 the US Government via the Compact of Free Association,310,313 and other nations (KMs 19.2, 19.3).314 Because credit agencies are increasingly considering vulnerability to climate change as a factor in their ratings, however, Palauâs and RMIâs credit ratings may decrease, with negative impacts on their abilities to borrow external funds, attract foreign investment, or access below-market-rate financing to accelerate development.315\n\nDecarbonization, Sequestration, and Resilience\n\nAlthough many Pacific Islands emit minimal greenhouse gases, they are striving to reduce emissions and sequester carbon while addressing ecosystem resilience needs.119 For example, Guam and HawaiÊ»i established 100% renewable portfolio standards for the electricity sector, to be achieved by no later than 2045.316,317 HawaiÊ»i established a net-negative emissions target by 2045 and created a sequestration task force282 charged with establishing baselines and benchmarks, recommending policies including mitigation, and developing strategies for sustainable agriculture. This work led to a carbon pricing evaluation.318 Similarly, RMI pledged emissions reductions of 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.319 Palau recently committed to 100% energy generation from renewable sources by 2032.320 Opportunities exist for ecosystem-based, place-based adaptation and mitigation informed by Indigenous Knowledge systems (KMs 30.1, 30.5).321,322,323\n\nWith limited land areas, each island in the region is carefully evaluating options for transitioning to renewable energy. In 2016, American SÄmoaâs island of TaÊ»Å« transitioned its energy supply from 100% diesel to 100% solar with battery backup.324 In HawaiÊ»i, rapid growth of rooftop solar generationâcombined with centralized solar, battery storage, wind power, and pumped hydropower storageâis enabling a transition away from an oil-predominant grid.325 The potential for success is high: KauaÊ»iâs grid achieved a 69.5% renewable portfolio standard in 2021, and the island is occasionally 100% renewably powered during midday hours; it is projected to achieve a 90% renewable portfolio by 2026.326,327 HawaiÊ»iâs Act 100328 required a community-based renewable energy program; power utilities and communities in the region are now developing mechanisms to enable shared ownership of renewable infrastructure.329\n\nMarine and Coastal Ecosystems\n\nPacific Island marine environments serve as the foundation for local food systems and cultures (Figure 30.12). Rising ocean temperatures, declining dissolved oxygen concentrations, and marine heatwaves are projected to impact the structure and composition of marine ecosystems (Figure 30.5; Ch. 8; KM 10.1).330 Global marine food web models project biomass declines of 10% to 40% across the region throughout this century, with greater declines projected for large predators.331 Finally, marine species within the regionâs EEZs are projected to shift beyond historical ranges as early as 2030âsooner than much of the globe.83\n\nCoastal and oceanic environments supply direct goods and services such as fish, recreation and tourism areas, regulating services such as coastal protection and carbon storage, and means for trade and transportationâcollectively valued at over $3.1 trillion per year (in 2022 dollars; KM 23.2).332 Rising SSTs and marine heatwaves continue to be the most pressing climate change impacts facing Pacific reefs,333,334 leading to more frequent and severe bleaching events with less recovery time.61,62,335,336 Bleaching-induced mortality has reduced coral cover and decreased available habitat for reef-associated species.62,334 Increased SSTs will negatively affect some animal species distributions,337,338,339 and rising ocean and sand temperatures lead to a higher ratio of female sea turtles observed around the Pacific, threatening the viability of sea turtle populations.340 Increased air temperatures and reduced precipitation are likely to have negative effects on coastal vegetation341 and coastal pond communities,342 adversely affecting coral reefs, seagrasses, and mangroves via altered sediment and pollutant delivery to coasts.343 Increased ocean acidity344 and increased nutrient runoff from the land345 negatively impact corals, shellfish, and associated fisheries (KM 30.1). Although these systems generally have limited capacity to adapt to large climatic changes, regional strategies are being developed to reduce impacts.337,338,346\n\nArt × Climate\n\nConstance Collins\n\nCoral Conundrum: Dead or Alive\n\n(2023, handmade paper, upcycled warp yarn remnants)\n\nArtist’s statement: Coral reefs are being threatened globally from climate change, unsustainable fishing, and land-based pollution. This piece recalls coral reefs and their inhabitants. As reefs deteriorate, they lose their vibrant color and their ability to provide nutrients and shelter to thousands of marine species. Here, the gradation from color to monochrome represents the bleaching that occurs as coral dies. We need to protect these crucial ecosystems, or we lose them. I used upcycled remnant warp yarns for the coral clusters and created handmade paper.\n\nView the full Art × Climate gallery.\n\nArtworks and artists’ statements are not official Assessment products.\n\nSea level rise will cause more frequent and extensive flooding of coastal ecosystems, impacting plants354,355 and animals,356 especially on low-lying atolls such as those in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, PRI, RMI, and FSM. In some cases, flooding is likely to increase erosion rates, reducing the elevation of mangroves, vegetated dunes, and beaches. Development exacerbates these drivers by exposing soils, creating impervious surfaces, and impeding inland migration of coastal ecosystems, limiting their adaptive capacity.357\n\nHigh Island Ecosystems\n\nTerrestrial ecosystems of high islands (i.e., islands characterized by volcanic origin and consequently more diverse topography) have evolved in isolation from continental areas, resulting in unique and diverse fauna and flora with a high proportion of native species naturally occurring only on these islands (Figure 30.12). However, the combination of invasive plants and animals and diseases; habitat destruction; and intensifying fire regimes and ecological drought has resulted in severe range contractions and native species extinctions.93,358,359,360,361,362,363\n\nIn HawaiÊ»i, past droughts and rainfall variability had landscape-level impacts on vegetation364,365 and cascading ecological effects.366 Long-term climatic shifts are likely to accelerate range contraction and extinction rates,93,367 but responses will vary by species, including differences in drought tolerance across populations.368,369,370,371\n\nRainfall changes (Figure 30.3) will affect island aquatic ecosystems. In HawaiÊ»i, declines in dry-season streamflow will result in more intermittent streams137 and loss of habitat connectivity and conservation value.372 Decreased streamflow will also negatively impact stream organisms by reducing fitness and increasing disease and habitat for invasive fish and mosquitoes.373,374,375\n\nAcross the region, climatic shifts are expected to impact native ecosystems via interactions with fire (e.g., Trauernicht 2019; Nugent et al. 2020376,377). Wildland fires already burn a higher proportion of total land area in the Pacific Islands than in the continental US (Figure 30.13)229,378 and are strongly linked to El NiÃ±o events.49,103 While limited future climate projections indicate increasing fire probabilities,377 the future of fire in the region is highly sensitive to management and policy decisions, since ignitions are largely caused by humans (e.g., Dendy et al. 2022; Trauernicht et al. 2015229,378). Education and outreach will continue to play a critical role in wildfire mitigation (e.g., HWMO 2021125).\n\nInteractions between invasive species and climate change in isolated Pacific Islands are complex (KM 8.2),379,380,381,382,383 with climate change most often exacerbating invasion.384,385,386,387 Invasive species may aggravate local water stress, for instance, by using more water resources than native plants148,380,388,389 or by causing less rainfall to reach the forest floor, as in the case of strawberry guava invasion.148,390 Similarly, fire-prone invasive vegetation is likely to further increase future climate-driven fire risk.377 With the steep increase in the number of naturalized species on Pacific Islands,391 these climate and invasion interactions will become increasingly important for managers to address.392 Critical region-wide investments are being made to prevent the introduction of potentially invasive species and diseases,393 given that climate change can alter pathways for species introductions.394,395,396\n\nResponding to Rising Threats\n\nRegional efforts increasingly focus on restoration management that enhances climate resilience.397,398,399,400,401 Besides boosting adaptive capacity,402 ecosystem restoration efforts may provide multiple benefits to islands, including hydrological (KM 8.3)140,148,161,401,403,404 and sociocultural benefits,404,405 as well as carbon sequestration406 and sediment retention.407 HawaiÊ»i and the USAPI have established both marine and terrestrial protected areas (Box 30.2),119,134,408,409 which elsewhere have successfully supported ecosystem resilience under climate change (e.g., GaÃ¼zÃ¨re et al. 2016; Lawler and Hepinstall-Cymerman 2010; Roberts et al 2017; Virkkala et al. 2014410,411,412,413).\n\nThe urgency of conservation actions (Figure 30.14) is exemplified by the Hawaiian forest bird crisis. Forest bird populations are declining due to avian malaria spread driven by warming.414,415 Managers are exploring options for safeguarding species near extinction,416,417,418,419 including habitat restoration, avian malaria vector control,420 and translocation.421,422,423,424\n\nIn addressing these myriad challenges, conservation efforts increasingly involve broader partnerships with educators (e.g., Bolden et al. 2018123) and Indigenous Knowledge holders, who play a vital role in conservation planning and implementation (KM 30.5; Ch. 16).405,425,426,427,428\n\nReciprocal Relationships Between People and Place\n\nCommunities throughout HawaiÊ»i and the USAPI demonstrate Indigenous cultural and community resilience grounded in Traditional Knowledge as they continue to adapt to global changes, just as their ancestors have for millennia (KM 18.3; Figure 16.3).87 These adaptations and the collective resilience of Indigenous communities are strengthened and sustained through reciprocal exchanges between the peoples and the lands, territories, waters, and resources to which they are genealogically connected (Figure 30.15). Resilient communities are vital to the overall health and well-being of island peoples. To effectively advance the science of sustainability and manage resources amidst the changing climate, spiritual rituals and engagements are central to biocultural well-beingâthe collective well-being of landscapes, seascapes, and Indigenous communities (Box 30.6).429 Through these rituals and engagements, island communities individually and collectively are able to connect to the place and all of its life-forms, cultivating reciprocal relations that enhance future resource abundance based on responsibility rather than ownership.430\n\nCultural and Historical Sites\n\nArchaeological, cultural, and historical sites are representations of the living culture and ancestral knowledge of Indigenous and island peoples, and they serve as potential resources and models as communities seek to remediate increasing climate risks and impacts (Figure 30.16).87,118,119,434 Indigenous communities are identifying and protecting cultural and historical sites, assessing climate impacts on natural resources, and creating restoration plans (KM 16.3).435,436\n\nArchaeological sites and oral history document the culturally grounded and traditional resilience of island peoples to historical coastal change that resulted from extreme events and higher sea levels. Approximately 2,000â4,000 years ago across the equatorial Pacific, sea level was at least 3.3â6.6 feet higher than present, which directly influenced the timing of atoll formation and the initial migrations and settlement of island people.437 Initial settlers of Majuro atoll, RMI, arrived within 100 years of island formation, when sea level was 3.3 feet higher than present, and they cultivated trees and shrubs into crop systems rather than waiting for natural vegetation succession.438 On Yap, FSM, coastal stone-built structures are expressions of innovation, cultural identity, and pride that allowed islanders to occupy coastal areas under elevated sea level, and modern structures such as the coastal menâs houses (faluw) and taro gardens document cultural resistance to rising waters.87 On Guam, traditional CHamoru houses were elevated on limestone pillars (latte) along the coast, protecting them from coastal inundation.439 Across higher islands like SÄmoa, settlement along narrow coastal plains occurred after nearly 1,000 years of sea level fall and subsequent natural development of habitable coastal environments.437 The oral histories, stories, myths, storyboards (Palau), and songs/chants of Indigenous Peoples record their observations of the changing environments and lifestyles. The proverb He pÅ«koÊ»a kani Ê»Äina describes the natural evolution of a coral reef into an island and is also interpreted by Native Hawaiians to describe the resilience of a person who begins in a small way and gains steadily until she becomes firmly established.440\n\nAcross the region, one approach to mediating climate impacts is to reinvigorate and restore food production across landscapes (KMs 11.1, 30.1; Box 30.4).441 This is being accomplished through several pathways. At a policy level, work is being done to amend law in HawaiÊ»i to add a âTraditional Landsâ zone under the stateâs Land Use Commission that would streamline permit and building requirements194 for eco-village-type living with mixed-use housing and other sustainable infrastructure such as commercial kitchen and food-processing facilities, as well as the use of traditional agriculture lands such as loÊ»i kalo (irrigated taro, agriculture), loko iÊ»a (fishponds), and large expanses used to traditionally farm staple crops such as âuala (sweet potato).442 Communities and cultural practitioners are working with scientists to identify areas where food production could be expanded under future climate scenarios (KM 12.4). For example, taro cultivation was modeled under future SLR scenarios434 and sweet potato442 and breadfruit under increasing temperature and rainfall scenarios,118 showing the potential resilience of these traditional agricultural practices.\n\nIndigenous Knowledge Systems and Values of Ecosystem Services\n\nIndigenous island communities are also working to ensure that Traditional Knowledge is central to resilience strategies (KM 16.3). A growing body of Indigenous-led research describes how biocultural methods can successfully be incorporated into efforts focused on community-based subsistence,431,432 relationships to place,433 culturalâecosystem service assessments,443 and the protection of historical and cultural resources.444 Biocultural approaches start with and build upon local cultural perspectives by encompassing values, knowledge, and needs and by recognizing reciprocal restoration between ecosystems and human well-being (KM 20.3).195,443 The act of restoring ecosystem services contributes to cultural revitalization433 by reaffirming connection to place, enhancing community relationships and social networks and the physical and mental well-being of Indigenous Peoples,405 increasing local food production,202 and diversifying the local economy427âall while distributing the abundance through reciprocal exchange.431 In return, the renewal of culture promotes the restoration of ecological integrity through the creation and expansion of habitat for native species434 and further supports recovery and resilience of ecosystems following future environmental disturbances (KM 8.3).445 Equitable outcomes from climate research and planning are predicated on properly citing Indigenous elders and knowledge keepers,446 enhancing Indigenous control of Indigenous data via data sovereignty, protecting intellectual property rights, and establishing free, prior, and informed consent (KMs 16.2, 20.2, 31.2).447,448"
