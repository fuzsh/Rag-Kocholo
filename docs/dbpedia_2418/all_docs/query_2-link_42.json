With the launch of the ePQS Portal, the World Health Organization (WHO) will reach another milestone in the digitalization and streamlining of business processes: With Phase 1, companies will be able to make submissions via eCTD. WHO is thus following the example of numerous international health authorities, such as the EMA. WHO and EXTEDO have joint forces in a very special webinar! We are pleased to present this important development to you in an exclusive free webinar, to which we cordially invite you. Join us as WHO representatives talk about the introduction of eCTD and what it means for the future of submissions. Learn from EXTEDO expert Frank Dickert what exactly the WHO Module 1 and the validation criteria look like, and see in a live demo by our product manager, Maren M√ºller, how easy it is to create and validate a WHO eCTD dossier in EXTEDOpulse. Date: 21 November 2023 Time: 11:00 - 12:30 CET Register now and learn how your organization can approach the future of submissions.
