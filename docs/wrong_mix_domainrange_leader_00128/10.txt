This entry includes five subentries: chief of state; head of government; cabinet; elections/appointments; election results. Chief of state includes the name, title, and beginning date in office of the titular leader of the country who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions, but who may not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. Head of government includes the name and title of the person designated to manage the executive branch of the government, as well as the beginning date in office. Cabinet includes the official name and the method of member selection. Elections/appointments includes the process for accession to office, date of the last election, and date of the next election. Election results includes each candidate's political affiliation and percentage of direct popular vote or indirect legislative/parliamentary vote.

The executive branches in approximately 80% of the world's countries have separate chiefs of state and heads of government; for the remainder, the chief of state is also the head of government. In dependencies, territories, and collectivities of sovereign countries -- except those of the US -- representatives are appointed to serve as chiefs of state.

Heads of government in the majority of countries are appointed by the president, monarch, or the majority party in the legislative body. Excluding countries where the chief of state is also head of government, the head of government is directly elected through popular vote in only a few countries.

Most executive branches have a cabinet, or a group of advisers to the country's leader. The majority of cabinets are appointed by the chief of state or head of government, sometimes in consultation with the legislature. Legislatures independently elect cabinets in only about a dozen countries.
