        "text": "Plan De Actuaciones Preventivas De Los Efectos Del Exceso De Temperaturas Sobre La Salud Cantabria 2022 / Preventive Action Plan for the Effects of Excessive Heat on Health, Cantabria 2022\n\nEl presente documento es la actualización del contenido del Plan anterior y su adaptación al Plan Nacional de Actuaciones Preventivas de los Efectos del Exceso de Temperaturas sobre la Salud, aprobado por la Comisión Interministerial en su reunión del 26 de abril de 2022. Su aplicación, está cumpliendo su principal objetivo: la prevención de daños a la salud provocados por el exceso de calor.\n\nEl Plan establece las medidas necesarias para reducir los efectos asociados a las temperaturas excesivas y coordinar las instituciones de nuestra Comunidad implicadas. Describe la magnitud del problema, el conocimiento científico de los efectos de las temperaturas excesivas sobre la salud y los factores de riesgo asociados. También se especifican las acciones previstas para la prevención y control, estructuradas en varios niveles de actuación según el nivel alcanzado por las temperaturas. Se establecen los criterios de un sistema de información que permita la vigilancia activa de los riesgos asociados a la exposición a temperaturas excesivas. Así mismo, plantea la recogida de información predictiva sobre temperatura ambiental, información sobre las variaciones de la demanda asistencial e información diaria sobre los cambios cuantitativos de la mortalidad.\n\nUn aspecto esencial de este Plan es la implicación de los Servicios Sociales, ya que las personas mayores son las más desprotegidas y vulnerables. La participación de la administración (central, autonómica y local), de las organizaciones sociales, y sobre todo la concienciación y el apoyo a los colectivos más sensibles, resultan necesarios para evitar posibles daños en la población.\n\nThe present document is an update of the previous Plan and its adaptation to the National Plan for Preventive Actions Against the Effects of Excessive Temperatures on Health, approved by the Interministerial Commission in its meeting on April 26, 2022. Its implementation aims to prevent health damage caused by excessive heat.\n\nThe Plan establishes necessary measures to reduce effects associated with excessive temperatures and coordinate involved institutions in our Community. It describes the problem’s magnitude, scientific knowledge on the health effects of excessive temperatures, and associated risk factors. Planned actions for prevention and control are detailed across different intervention levels based on temperature levels. Criteria for an information system allowing active monitoring of risks associated with excessive heat exposure are set. Additionally, it proposes collecting predictive information on ambient temperature, data on variations in healthcare demand, and daily information on quantitative changes in mortality.\n\nAn essential aspect of this Plan involves the involvement of Social Services, given that older adults are the most unprotected and vulnerable. Engagement of central, regional, and local administrations, social organizations, and particularly raising awareness and supporting sensitive groups, are necessary to prevent potential harm to the population.\n\nPlan Nacional de actuaciones preventivas de los efectos del exceso de temperatura sobre la salud Año 2023 / Spain National Plan for Preventive Actions on the Health Effects of Excessive Heat 2023\n\nEn 2004 se inició en España el Plan Nacional de Actuaciones Preventivas de los Efectos del Exceso de Temperaturas Sobre la Salud, con el objetivo de reducir los efectos potenciales asociados a las altas temperaturas durante el periodo estival. Desde su puesta en marcha el Plan Nacional ha ido incluyendo mejoras a lo largo de los años, generando un impacto positivo en relación con la prevención de problemas y enfermedades relacionadas con la exposición a las temperaturas excesivas.\n\nEl año 2023 es el décimo noveno año que el Ministerio de Sanidad planifica y gestiona el Plan Nacional y es indudable su relevancia como instrumento de prevención de los efectos de las altas temperaturas sobre la salud, ya que los expertos prevén que las olas de calor serán cada vez más frecuentes y tendrán una mayor duración debido al cambio climático.\n\nComo cada verano el Ministerio de Sanidad pone a disposición de las autoridades sanitarias y de los ciudadanos información relativa a los efectos de las altas temperaturas sobre la salud, así como los niveles de riesgo diarios por exceso de temperatura durante el periodo estival, con el objetivo de prevenir los efectos de las altas temperaturas sobre la salud.\n\nIn 2004, Spain launched the National Plan for Preventive Actions Against the Effects of Excessive Heat on Health, aiming to reduce potential impacts of high temperatures during summer. Since its inception, the National Plan has continuously improved over the years, positively impacting the prevention of health problems and illnesses related to excessive heat exposure.\n\n2023 marks the nineteenth year that the Ministry of Health has planned and managed the National Plan, highlighting its crucial role in preventing health impacts from high temperatures. Experts predict that heatwaves will become more frequent and prolonged due to climate change.\n\nEvery summer, the Ministry of Health provides health authorities and citizens with information on the health effects of high temperatures, along with daily risk levels for excessive heat, aiming to prevent health impacts from high temperatures.\n\nVienna Heat Action Plan\n\nIn Vienna, the increase in urban heat is the most strongly perceived consequence of progressive climate change. But not only average temperatures over the whole year are on the rise: Particular stress is caused by more and more frequent and longer heatwaves characterised by high temperatures over several consecutive days with only minimal cooling-off during the night hours. Moreover, heat is not evenly distributed across the city: The heat island effect is felt especially in densely built-up inner-city districts – here, temperatures are in part significantly higher than in the outskirts and environs of Vienna. For city dwellers, heat constitutes a source of growing stress that can lead to severe health impairments and even to death.\n\nAll over the world, heatwaves are already among those natural disasters with the highest number of fatalities. They especially affect vulnerable individuals and risk groups including elderly and socially isolated people, persons in need of care, individuals with chronic or mental diseases, pregnant women, young children or people living and working under particularly difficult conditions. For this reason, it is the goal of the present Heat Action Plan to proactively define measures that are necessary both for the prevention of overheating in the city and for coping with heat when it actually occurs. This is to prepare above all the health facilities, care and nursing institutions of Vienna for heat-related emergencies and protect the population against the negative health effects of heat.\n\nThe emphasis of the Heat Action Plan is on heat-related ad-hoc measures and on measures that must be taken at relatively short notice to be well prepared for hot spells during the summer months. For this purpose, the Heat Action Plan specifies 29 key measures, half of which target the entire urban population, while the second half focuses on the particular needs of specific vulnerable groups. Further measures are aimed at the long-term avoidance or reduction of heat in the city – however, these measures are mentioned in the Heat Action Plan only by way of example and described in greater detail in other documents of the City of Vienna, such as the Vienna Climate Guide.\n\nPlan d'action en cas de grande chaleur / Luxembourg Heatwave Action Plan\n\nLe plan d’action canicule énumère des recommandations à la population en cas de grande chaleur.\n\nThe Luxembourg heatwave action plan lists recommendations to the population in case of extreme heat events.\n\nPlan de Gestion des Vagues de Chaleur / France Heatwave Management Plan\n\nCe plan n’a pas vocation à remplacer le plan géré par le ministère de la santé s’agissant des risques sanitaires, mais à le compléter. Un retour d’expérience interministériel a été mené à la suite des deux épisodes de canicule de 2019, ainsi qu’à l’épisode de sécheresse de 2022. Il en est ressorti que, si le système de santé n’a globalement pas été mis en tension pendant ces deux épisodes grâce à l’activation du plan national canicule, ces vagues de chaleur ont impacté l’ensemble de la population et ont eu des conséquences majeures dans de nombreux domaines : fermeture de classes et de crèches, report d’examens scolaires, annulation de manifestations sportives et culturelles, perturbations dans les transports en commun et grande pénibilité pour les usagers, mortalité animale, assèchement des cours d’eau et difficultés d’approvisionnement en eau potable, feux de récolte… Il a ainsi été décidé de prolonger le plan national de gestion des vagues de chaleur afin de prendre en compte tous les impacts de ces événements. Ce plan a pour objectifs de se préparer de façon systématique en amont de la période estivale puis d’anticiper l’arrivée prévue d’une vague de chaleur et de définir les actions à mettre en œuvre aux niveaux national et local pour en prévenir et en limiter les impacts. Il prend en compte les particularités des territoires d’outre-mer qui, de par leurs situations géographiques et climatiques, l’impact du changement climatique et l’augmentation des températures, le manque d’infrastructures et d’entretien de celles-ci, sont confrontés à d’importantes vagues de chaleur sur de longues périodes.\n\nThis plan is not intended to replace the plan managed by the Ministry of Health regarding health risks, but to complement it. An interministerial feedback was conducted following the two heatwaves of 2019, as well as the drought episode of 2022. It was found that although the healthcare system was generally not strained during these episodes due to the activation of the national heatwave plan, these heatwaves impacted the entire population and had major consequences in many areas: closure of schools and daycare centers, postponement of school exams, cancellation of sports and cultural events, disruptions in public transport causing significant inconvenience to users, animal mortality, drying up of watercourses, difficulties in water supply, crop fires, among others. It was thus decided to extend the national heatwave management plan to take into account all impacts of these events.\n\nThe objectives of this plan are to systematically prepare in advance of the summer period, anticipate the expected arrival of a heatwave, and define actions to be implemented at the national and local levels to prevent and limit its impacts. It considers the specificities of overseas territories which, due to their geographical and climatic situations, the impact of climate change, the rise in temperatures, and the lack of infrastructure and maintenance thereof, are confronted with significant heatwaves over long periods.\n\nHitzeschutzplan des Landes Tirol / Heat Protection Plan of Tirol\n\nHitzewellen sind auch in Tirol keine Ausnahmeerscheinung mehr. Länger andauernde Hitzeperioden können körperlich sehr anstrengend sein und zu ernsthaften Gesundheitsproblemen führen. Besonders gefährdet sind ältere Menschen, Kinder, Schwangere sowie Menschen mit chronischen Erkrankungen. Bereits einfache Maßnahmen können jedoch helfen, gesund durch die Hitzewelle zu kommen. Gemeinsam mit den tirol kliniken startet deshalb am Montag, den 3. Juli 2023, eine breitgefächerte Hitzeschutz-Kampagne des Landes, die mit fünf praktischen Tipps auf das richtige Verhalten während Hitzeperioden aufmerksam macht.\n\nHeat waves are no longer an exception in Tyrol. Long periods of heat can be physically demanding and can lead to serious health problems. Older people, children, pregnant women and people with chronic illnesses are particularly at risk. However, even simple measures can help you get through the heat wave. Together with the Tyrol clinics, the state is launching a broad heat protection campaign, which will provide information on how to protect yourself during heatwaves.\n\nSouth Australia Health Extreme Heat and Heatwave Strategy\n\nThis document provides strategic guidance, and is intended for use across SA Health, including the Department for Health and Wellbeing (DHW), Local Health Networks (LHNs), SA Ambulance Service (SAAS), Wellbeing SA and all other SA Health clinical support services. This document is not mandatory but serves to guide all areas within SA Health in developing and maintaining their localised planning and preparedness to respond to extreme heat and heatwaves, and establish their own procedures, arrangements or plans specific to their context.\n\nThis document also recognises and acknowledges the important role the wider health, aged care and disability sectors plays during extreme heat and heatwave events, including Aged Care, General Practice, Pharmacies, Community Health, and Disability services – some of whom are Commonwealth government or non-government organisations (NGOs), as well as private businesses. Guidance for these sector partners is included within this document, for their consideration, as part of their preparedness for extreme heat and heatwaves in South Australia.\n\nTurn Down the Heat Strategy and Action Plan\n\nHeat is Australia’s deadliest natural hazard, and impacts 100% of the population of Greater Sydney every summer.Heat impacts are particularly pronounced in Western Sydney, due to a combination of climate change, local geography, and rapid urbanisation – where greening makes way for new housing developments.Heat causes major liveability and resilience problems with critical impacts for human health, infrastructure, emergency services and the natural environment.\n\nThe impacts of heat are already being felt across Western Sydney. We urgently need to respond with strategies that minimise the impacts of intense shocks such as heatwaves and the ongoing stress of frequent hot and very hot weather. It is critical that we improve our region’s resilience to urban and extreme heat. A resilience approach involves not only reducing urban heat, but also helping people adapt, and being prepared to respond in extreme events.\n\nThe Turn Down the Heat Strategy has been prepared in collaboration with stakeholders from a diverse range of sectors including health, infrastructure, academia, planning, utilities and non-profit. Combining the expert knowledge, skills and resources of these stakeholders is essential to comprehensively address urban heat. As a collective we will need to continue to build collaboration between sector experts to ensure the goals of the strategy are achieved.\n\nNew South Wales State Heatwave Subplan - Australia\n\nThis state Heatwave Sub Plan describes the strategic emergency management arrangements for heatwaves affecting New South Wales, including Lord Howe Island. This Plan is written and issued under the authority of the NSW State Emergency and Rescue Management Act 1989 (‘SERM Act’) and the NSW State Emergency Management Plan (EMPLAN). In addition to these instruments, the following Acts and Regulations apply to managing Heat Waves in New South Wales. This plan has been prepared on behalf of the State Emergency Operations Controller and was endorsed by the State Emergency Management Committee, in accordance with the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act 1989 (as amended), Section 15 (e), in April 2023. This plan acknowledges and aligns with the National Heatwave Warning Framework, which includes guidance on the use of the Australian Warning System for heatwaves Heatwave Service for Australia (bom.gov.au)\n\nState Emergency Management Plan Extreme Heat Sub-Plan\n\nThis State Emergency Management Plan (SEMP) Extreme Heat Sub-Plan contextualises the current arrangements, roles and responsibilities for planning, mitigation, preparedness, response (including relief) and recovery from all extreme heat events, regardless of their duration. For the purposes of this Sub-Plan, extreme heat events include low-intensity, severe and extreme heatwaves (three or more consecutive days of high temperatures), or one or two days of abnormal high temperatures which would impact the general population and include consequences for essential services, energy and water supply, health and wellbeing and the environment. The metric for defining heatwaves is the Excess Heat Factor (EHF), which correlates to one of three heatwave levels: low-intensity, severe or extreme heatwaves (see section 2). Operational activities of agencies or businesses are covered within their respective operational plans. Agency specific operational or business continuity plans may be enacted to manage the impacts or consequences of extreme heat events, without state level arrangements being triggered.\n\nHeatwave Planning Guide Development of heatwave plans in local councils in Victoria\n\nIn January 2009, Victoria experienced an unprecedented statewide heatwave, with Melbourne experiencing three consecutive days of temperatures above 43°C and little overnight relief. The report by the Office of the Chief Health Officer concluded that there were 374 additional deaths during the heatwave in comparison to the previous five years. The Heatwave Planning Guide is designed to assist local councils in addressing the risks associated with heatwaves at a community level. Internationally, heatwave plans are commonly used to minimise the health impact of heatwaves\n\nHitzeschutzplan Vorarlberg 2020 / Vorarlberg Heat Protection plan\n\nDie Erderwärmung lässt auch in gemäßigten Klimaregionen die Zahl der Hitzetage und Tropennächte steigen. Das erfordert intensive Vorkehrungen und Maßnahmen zur Klimaanpassung und zum Schutz der Gesundheit. Die Vorarlberger Landesregierung hat daher einen Hitzeschutzplan erarbeiten lassen, der sich an die ganze Bevölkerung sowie speziell an Gemeinden, Pflege- und Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen richtet. „Damit haben wir jetzt erstmals eine umfassende Informationssammlung und Handlungsanleitung, die auch als Grundlage für künftige Entwicklungen dienen soll“, so Landeshauptmann Markus Wallner und Gemeindeverbands-Vizepräsidentin Andrea Kaufmann.\n\nGlobal warming is causing the number of hot days and nights to rise even in temperate climate regions. This requires intensive precautions and measures to adapt to climate change and protect the health of people. The Vorarlberg state government has therefore had a heat protection plan drawn up that is aimed at the entire population and specifically at communities, nursing and childcare facilities. “This means that for the first time we now have a comprehensive collection of information and instructions for action that should also serve as a basis for future developments,” said Governor Markus Wallner and Vice President of the Association of Municipalities Andrea Kaufmann.\n\nSteirischer Hitzeschutzplan / Styrian heat protection plan\n\nHitzewellen kommen in regelmäßigen Abständen in unseren Breitengraden vor. Zusätzlich ist auch aufgrund der Klimaerwärmung mit einem gehäuften Auftreten von anhaltenden intensiven Hitzeperioden zu rechnen. Eine Hitzewelle liegt vor, wenn anhaltende Tag- und Nacht temperaturwerte erreicht werden, die eine massive Belastung der Gesundheit von Personen bzw.Risikogruppen mit sich bringen. Die WHO empfiehlt die Entwicklung von Strategien, Plänen und Maßnahmenpaketen zum Zwecke der bestmöglichen Einstellung der Bevölkerung auf Hitzebelastungstage und des effektiven Handlings von Aufgaben des Öffentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (ÖGD), die durch das Auftreten von Hitzewellen entstehen.\n\nHeat waves occur at regular intervals in our latitudes. In addition, due to global warming, a more frequent occurrence of sustained, intense heat periods is to be expected. When a heat wave occurs sustained day and night temperatures negatively affect the health of people and groups at risk. The WHO recommends the development of strategies, plans and packages of measures to ensure that the population is as well prepared as possible for days of heat stress and to effectively handle public health tasks that arise from the occurrence of heat waves.\n\nNationaler Hitzeschutzplan Österreich 2024 / National Heat Protection Plan 2024 Austria\n\nDer nationale Hitzeschutzplan beschreibt unterschiedliche Maßnahmen, die auf Bundesebene in Kooperation mit den Bundesländern und der GeoSphere Austria im Fall von Hitze insbesondere bei länger andauernden Hitzewellen unternommen werden. Dadurch wird ein Rahmen für zusätzliche Schritte auf Länderebene sowie auf regionaler und lokaler Ebene geschaffen, um die in Österreich lebende Bevölkerung bestmöglich vor den gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen von Hitze zu schützen.\n\nEs handelt sich beim nationalen Hitzeschutzplan somit um eine Anleitung für das Vorgehen des für Gesundheit zuständigen Ministeriums sowie sonstiger Behörden und Organisationen. Dazu zählen insbesondere Gesundheitseinrichtungen und Sozialorganisationen auf Länder- bzw. Gemeindeebene, die im vorliegenden nationalen Hitzeschutzplan Verweise auf Werkzeuge und internationale gute Praxis für weiterführende Maßnahmen finden. Der vorliegende Hitzeschutzplan wird regelmäßig unter Berücksichtigung neuer wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse evaluiert und erforderlichenfalls adaptiert. Insofern ist er als lebendes Dokument anzusehen.\n\nThe national heat protection plan describes measures that are taken at a federal level in cooperation with the federal states and GeoSphere Austria during a extreme heat event, particularly during longer-lasting heat waves. This creates a framework for additional steps at state, regional and local levels in order to best protect the population living in Austria from the health effects of extream heat.\n\nThe national heat protection plan is therefore a guide for the actions of the ministry responsible for health and other authorities and organizations. These includes health facilities and social organizations at state or municipal level, which will find references to tools and international good practices for further measures. This heat protection plan is regularly evaluated taking into account new scientific findings and adapted if necessary. In this respect, it should be viewed as a living document.\n\n2024 Maryland Department of Health Extreme Heat Emergency Plan\n\nThe Maryland Extreme Heat Emergency Plan, developed by the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), guides the state’s actions during an Extreme Heat Event, as well as those of partner agencies and organizations, as defined below. This plan also provides guidance for the local health departments (LHDs) as they fulfill their roles; however, it does not mandate that LHDs perform the actions described. The Office of Preparedness & Response (OP&R) within MDH provides weekly heat reports on the OP&R webpage during each heat season.\n\nNew Hampshire Excessive Heat Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe purpose of this plan is to provide information and to identify the Department of Health and Human Services’ (DHHS) role in response to excessive heat emergencies in the State in collaboration with the NH Public Health Regions (PHR) and with other State agencies, and in accordance with the National Incident Management System (NIMS). The plan includes the threshold for response activation, a description of heat indices and associated health risks, response activities by heat emergency phase, and criteria for cooling centers. It also includes templates for an extreme heat press release, hotline script, health alert message, and heat fact sheet.\n\nPort Moody’s Climate Action Plan - Canada\n\nPort Moody’s Climate Action Plan is a community-wide plan that outlines actions to help the City and its residents adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) that contribute to the warming of the Earth.\n\nThe Climate Action Plan considers both aspects of climate change planning: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation – working to reduce or prevent the emission of GHGs – is an important part of responding to climate change. However, even if we significantly reduced GHG emissions overnight, the effects of climate change would continue to be felt by future generations for a long time to come. That’s why our Climate Action Plan also focuses on adaptation measures, which will help us adjust to our new normal in Port Moody and reduce our vulnerability to the harmful effects of climate change.\n\nThis low carbon resilience (LCR) approach demonstrates that adaptation and mitigation are two sides of the same coin; both are proactive responses that minimize the risks of climate change and build resilience into the future. Integrating the two at all levels of policy, planning and practice will align climate action goals and advance the transition toward a more energy efficient, resilient, and sustainable future.\n\nProject HEATS\n\nHEATS (Heat Exposure, AcTivity, and Sleep) is a three-year, multi-institutional project focused on improving sleep outcomes for people exposed to heat. Funded by the Singapore National Research Foundation, the project will develop technological and behavioral solutions to minimize heat exposure for improved sleep.\n\nThe project is structured as three distinct and complementary components: 1) continuous monitoring of more than 100 working-age persons over several months to study the effect of heat exposure on sleep, 2) develop and evaluate a novel bedroom and worker dormitories cooling solution, and 3) deploy and test personalized smartphone nudging strategies to improve sleep environments.\n\nThe project team is comprised of researchers from University of California, Berkeley, the National University of Singapore, and The University of Sydney. The expertise of the 6-member team includes thermal physiology, sleep quality, indoor environmental quality, thermal comfort, and machine learning. The Principal Investigators are Stefano Schiavon (UC Berkeley) and Jason Kai Wei Lee (NUS). Co-Investigators include June Chi Yan Lo (NUS), Clayton Miller (NUS), Thomas Parkinson (The University of Sydney), and Hui Zhang (UC Berkeley).\n\nBC Provincial Heat Alert and Response System (BC HARS): 2024\n\nWhile focused on describing the BC HARS, this document also contains general background information on heat events in B.C. and the reason for the establishment of the BC HEAT Committee. Section Two details the development of the BC HARS and describes the criteria for the two alert levels. Section Three contains tables with key messages and recommended actions for different partners and public health actors. In general, information in each table is divided into four parts: pre-season, during a Heat Warning, during an Extreme Heat Emergency, and post-season or deactivation. The final section contains links to relevant resources and appendices.\n\nThis document is intended to be used as a resource to support the province-wide implementation of the heat alert and response system in British Columbia. The recommendations in section three of this document are not prescriptive but are intended to be used as tools to initiate heat planning or to complement the creation of more robust heat response plans. Acknowledging the wide variation in local heat response planning needs, not all recommendations may be appropriate for all settings.\n\nThe audience for this BC HARS document is all levels of government and all levels of the health system involved in heat preparedness planning, emergency management partners that plan for and respond to heat events, Indigenous governing bodies and local authorities, as well as organizations that work with and interface with susceptible populations and those at greatest risk of mortality during heat events.\n\nCity of Greater Sudbury Hot Weather Response Plan\n\nIn 2023, Greater Sudbury experienced seven days under a heat warning. The Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment Technical Report anticipates Northeast and Northwest Ontario will see temperatures from 3.8 and 4.1 days now rise to over 35 days per year, on average, with impacts felt in the far North, Northwest and Northeastern Ontario despite the absolute numbers being lower compared to Southern Ontario. The report goes on to predict that by the 2080s, major cities like Sudbury could see as many as 55 days a year with temperatures over 30 degrees, in comparison to the 10 days being experienced now. The Hot Weather Response Plan (HWRP) is intended to alert those most at risk of heat-related illness that hot weather conditions are either imminent or currently exist and to take appropriate precautions.\n\nSurrey’s Extreme Heat Response Guideline\n\nUrban areas are the hot spots of global warming. Extreme heat is a key risk to the health and well-being of British Columbians. The situation is growing more dangerous, driven by irreversible climate change. Canada is warming, on average, at twice the global rate. Urban centres face the greatest risk because of the urban-heat-island effect. Surface daytime temperatures can be 10 – 15°C hotter in urban heat islands, while nighttime temperatures can be up to 12°C hotter than in surrounding rural areas. During episodes of extreme heat, everyone is at risk of heat-related illnesses. The danger is greatest for those who are more vulnerable or less able to protect themselves. This includes people who are more sensitive to extreme heat (such as the elderly or chronically ill) and those with fewer resources to adapt (for instance, people on lower incomes who cannot afford actions to retrofit their homes).\n\nThe purpose of this plan is to outline the actions available to the City of Surrey to support provincial ministries in mitigating risks to life and safety caused from an extreme heat event. Once a heat event is imminent, Surrey will support the messaging and promote the recommendations made by the governing health authority to our citizens, to ensure consistent information is published.\n\nClimate Change and Health in Waitaha Canterbury\n\nThe central purpose of this report is to increase understanding of the interactions between people, the environment, and the climate in Waitaha Canterbury – to provide planners and decision-makers and the wider community with information that can shape the development of effective responses to climate change.\n\nThe scope and extent of climate-related health and wellbeing impacts can be strongly influenced by location and it is important that regional-level adaptation strategies are matched to the specific geographic and demographic characteristics of the Waitaha Canterbury region. This report presents the interim findings of a scoping and profiling assessment that outlines the connections between climate change and health, relevant to the people of Waitaha Canterbury. This report does not specifically cover adaptation or mitigation/transition risks; however, this report does provide some commentary on adaptation and mitigation strategies that could help reduce the health and wellbeing impacts of climate1 . This report describes a range of climate change related determinants of health – incorporating broad perspectives of health and wellbeing.\n\nThis report encompasses the first steps of assessing the health and wellbeing impacts of climate change across Waitaha Canterbury and the potential effects on the health and wellbeing of the population and the distribution of those effects within the population\n\nHeat Resilience Solutions For Boston\n\nHeat Resilience Solutions for Boston presents a roadmap for navigating extreme heat. By building on the legacy of previous resilience plans, including 2016’s Climate Ready Boston report, we will be prepared to combat climate change. This study centers people and recognizes the challenges extreme heat poses to our quality of life. It focuses on environmental justice neighborhoods that disproportionately face extreme heat: Chinatown, Dorchester, East Boston, Mattapan, and Roxbury\n\nVlaams Warmteactieplan / Flemish Heat Action Plan\n\nDit plan schetst de krijtlijnen over hoe en wanneer kwetsbare doelgroepen – en professionals die werken met die doelgroepen – geïnformeerd en gewaarschuwd moeten worden voor en tijdens warmteperiodes. Het actieplan biedt ook handvaten aan professionals om preventieve acties te ondernemen om zo, gezondheidseffecten als gevolg van warmte, te voorkomen. Het Vlaams Warmteactieplan bestaat uit een waakzaamheids- en waarschuwingsfase.\n\nThis plan outlines how and when vulnerable groups – and professionals who work with those groups – should be informed and warned before and during extreme heat periods. The action plan also provides tools for professionals to take preventive actions to prevent health effects due to heat. The Flemish Heat Action Plan consists of a vigilance and warning phase.\n\nKeeping Metro Boston Cool: A Regional Heat Preparedness and Adaptation Plan\n\nThis Heat Preparedness and Adaptation Plan provides an actionable roadmap and recommendations on how the region can better prepare for and adapt to extreme heat and rising temperatures. This plan primarily addresses strategies and actions that reduce risk and increase preparedness through public health, planning, land use, and other municipal and regional actions. This comprehensive plan also provides strategies and actions to improve municipal and regional response to heat emergencies, although it is not intended to stand in for a robust municipal heat emergency response plan.\n\nPlan Nacional de actuaciones Preventivas de los efectos de los excesos de temperaturas sobre la salud de España / National Heat Action Plan Spain\n\nDesde 2004 el Plan Nacional de actuaciones Preventivas de los efectos de los excesos de temperaturas sobre la salud se activa cada verano, entre los meses de junio y septiembre.\n\nEl objetivo de este Plan es reducir el impacto sobre la salud de la población como consecuencia del exceso de temperatura. El Plan establece las medidas para reducir los efectos asociados a las temperaturas excesivas y para coordinar las instituciones de la Administración del Estado implicadas, así como también se proponen acciones que puedan ser realizadas por las Comunidades Autónomas y la Administración Local en función de los niveles de riesgo asignadas en base a las temperaturas.\n\nSince 2004, the National Plan Heat Action Plan has been activated every summer, between the months of June and September.\n\nThe objective of this plan is to reduce the impact on the health of the population as a consequence of the exposure to extreme temperatures. The Plan establishes measures to reduce the effects associated with excessive temperatures and to coordinate the institutions involved, as well as propose actions that can be carried out by the Autonomous Communities and the Local Administration depending on the levels of risk assigned based on temperatures.\n\nNew Zealand Heat Health Plans: Guidelines\n\nExtreme heat can cause illness and death, but effective planning and actions can reduce its effects on health. Because effects of heat are associated with relative rather than absolute temperatures, even in New Zealand’s temperate climate people can experience negative health effects with modest increases in seasonal temperature. The purpose of these guidelines is to assist health and community service providers, health sector organisations, local government and other community organisations prepare heat health response plans.\n\nThe main sections of these guidelines are:\n\nobjectives and scope – objectives and scope for these guidelines and how they fit into existing statutory frameworks\n\nheatwave hazard – the potential of heatwaves as a health hazard and the relevance of heatwave health planning in New Zealand\n\nhealth effects of heatwaves – heatwave-related health effects and vulnerable populations\n\nheat health actions – risk management actions.\n\nThese guidelines are a companion document to Heat Health Plans: Key Information (Te Whatu Ora 2023).\n\nRoadmap zur weiteren Umsetzung, Verstetigung und Weiterentwicklung des Hitzeschutzplans für Gesundheit für den Sommer 2024 / Roadmap for Summer 2024 - Germany\n\nAm20.11.2023 hat unter der Leitung von Minister Prof. Karl Lauterbach mit allen verantwortlichen Akteurinnen und Akteuren von Bund, Ländern, Kommunen, Selbstverwaltungspartnern, Verbänden und Zivilgesellschaft eine „Statuskonferenz Hitzeschutz Gesundheit“ stattgefunden. In diesem Rahmen wurde eine Bestandsaufnahme und Analyse bestehender Konzepte und Ressourcen für Hitzeschutzmaßnahmen durchgeführt und konkrete Ziele und Maßnahmen identifiziert, die zur Verstetigung und Weiterentwicklung des gesundheitlichen Hitzeschutzes auf Bundesebene und zur Vorbereitung von Hitzeschutzmaßnahmen im Sommer 2024 dienen sollen.\n\nEine “Roadmap für den Sommer 2024“ bündelt und konkretisiert diese Ziele und Maßnahmen, die auch auf den Empfehlungen und Vorschlägen der im „Hitzeschutzplan für Gesundheit des BMG“ eingebundenen Akteurinnen und Akteure basieren.\n\nOn November 20, 2023 , a “Status Conference on Heat Protection Health” was held under the leadership of Minister Prof. Karl Lauterbach with all responsible actors from the federal government, states, municipalities, self-government partners, associations and civil society. In this context, an inventory and analysis of existing concepts and resources for heat protection measures was carried out and concrete goals and measures were identified that should serve to consolidate and further develop heat protection for health at the federal level and to prepare heat protection measures in summer 2024.\n\nA “Roadmap for Summer 2024” bundles and specifies these goals and measures, which are also based on the recommendations and suggestions of the actors involved in the “ BMG ’s Heat Protection Plan for Health”.\n\nHitzeschutzplan für Gesundheit des BMG / BMG's Heat Protection Plan - Germany\n\nDer Schwerpunkt der Initiativen liege derzeit vor allem auf der Kommunikation und der Sensibilisierung, erklärte der Bundesgesundheitsministers. Das sei wichtig, um kurzfristig wirksam Hitzeschutz zu betreiben. Prof. Karl Lauterbach: „Langfristig wollen wir uns aber auch strukturell besser aufstellen. Dafür werden wir uns im Herbst zu einer Statuskonferenz zusammenfinden, um uns für den Sommer 2024 zu rüsten“.\n\nThe focus of this initiative is currently on communication and raising awareness, explained the Federal Minister of Health. This is important in order to provide effective heat protection in the short term. Prof. Karl Lauterbach: “In the long term, however, we also want to position ourselves better structurally. To this end, we will meet in the autumn for a status conference to prepare ourselves for the summer of 2024.”\n\nHeat Mitigation & Adaptation Guidebook - Strategies for Sedona\n\nResponding to heat will require a mix of mitigation (reducing temperatures and limiting heat exposure) and adaptation (coping when heat cannot be mitigated); physical, social, and policy interventions; and action by the City, professional partners, property owners, and community members. While some solutions can be quickly implemented, others will take months or years to put in place. Solutions exist at the household level and community-wide. As local leaders and residents plan for a hotter future, it will be essential to consider a range of heat mitigation and adaptation options, and select a complementary blend of solutions which meet immediate and long term needs. Ideally, heat mitigation solutions can integrate with existing priorities to address other environmental and health hazards (e.g., air pollution and stormwater runoff). This guidebook presents solutions which are supported by existing literature, and which are suitable for the steppe climate of Sedona. Of the multiple solutions to mitigate heat, literature overwhelmingly emphasizes tree planting and preservation because trees offer numerous co-benefits such as air quality improvement, stormwater retention, flood reduction, improved neighborhood aesthetics, and increased property values. However, trees are not appropriate in all situations, nor are they the only available option for heat mitigation. In Sedona, a city positioned near the southwest Arizona desert and coping with regional drought, trees are not the most obvious line of defense, though they are one option. In addition to a summary of the benefits and challenges associated with trees, content will emphasize lesser known options which can support, replace, complement, or amplify a vegetation-based strategy. The guidebook includes ideas for maximizing the effectiveness and sustainability of various heat mitigation and adaptation strategies. This is not a prescriptive implementation plan, but rather an offering of potential solutions to help stimulate and structure ongoing conversations about extreme heat.\n\nAustin’s Heat Resilience Playbook\n\nAustin’s first Heat Resilience Playbook identifies neighborhood-based and citywide projects, programs, and policies that can be leveraged to combat extreme heat. This Playbook seeks to uplift existing City-led heat resilience efforts and outline a series of high-impact actions that the City of Austin can take, with additional funding and resources, to build heat resilience. The actions outlined in this Playbook are structured through a three-pillar approach that focuses on individuals, neighborhoods, and our built and living environment. Strategies and actions identified are informed by Austin’s most recent localized extreme heat data and the latest international best practices. The strategies and actions are also a result of workshops, departmental meetings, office hours, and individual review efforts in collaboration with and consultation from City departments and Austin community members. Each action has associated champions assigned based on interest, capacity, and alignment with existing jurisdiction and responsibilities.\n\nHeat Action Plan for Thane City 2024\n\nThe Heat Action Plan (HAP) of Thane City has been formulated using a combination of climate datasets and climate projections from sources such as the Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis (IMDAA) and Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) for the period from 1982 to 2040. It combines these climatic datasets with onground socioeconomic data and satellite-derived indices to map Thane City’s heat risk.\n\nClimatic projections for India indicate that heat extremes are likely to intensify, occur more frequently, last longer, and impact wider geographical areas not previously impacted. Other factors, such as humidity and urban heat islands, particularly in cities, will further exacerbate and compound the risks associated with these extremes. With such record-breaking heat waves already being witnessed nationwide, there is an urgent need to develop and implement heat risk mitigation and adaptation strategies to reduce the impacts of heat waves across various geographical scales.\n\nThane City’s administration attempted to address these challenges by developing a city-level heat action plan, offering insights into heat risks considering historical trends and projections of dry temperature extremes, humidity, warm nights, and socioeconomic factors at a detailed ward/ Prabhag Samitee level (Figure ES1). The primary objective was to mitigate the impact of heat stress on human health and establish effective pathways for preparedness and response mechanisms.\n\nHeat Action Roadmap Tucson, Az\n\nIn response to rising temperatures the City of Tucson has developed this Heat Action Roadmap, a cornerstone of its broader climate resilience initiatives under the Tucson Resilient Together climate action plan.

La situación es más crítica en algunas zonas y para algunos grupos particularmente vulnerables, como personas de la tercera edad, enfermos crónicos, mujeres embarazadas, niños y quienes tienen problemas de salud mental. A pesar de lo anterior, se evidencia la ausencia de políticas públicas enfocadas a la gestión de emergencias o un plan de adaptación con medidas urbanas, económicas y sociales orientadas a la resiliencia. A partir de un análisis comprehensivo del riesgo asociado al calor extremo para el Gran Santiago y un estudio de políticas públicas comparadas en 17 ciudades con desafíos similares, se propone que la Región Metropolitana cuente con un plan para la prevención y gestión de la amenaza del calor extremo que incorpore un sistema de alerta temprana, planes de acción específicos para distintas instituciones, y una hoja de ruta a mediano y largo plazo para mejorar la resiliencia urbana y social de la ciudad. Con esto, se busca crear una gobernanza efectiva, asignando responsabilidades claras y proporcionando recursos adecuados para políticas públicas proactivas y adaptativas para enfrentar el calor extremo, mitigando sus efectos adversos en la población y el entorno.\n\nThis chapter highlights that the sustained increase in extreme heat events, exacerbated by the climate crisis, represents a significant risk to the health, economy and security of people in the Santiago Metropolitan Region. The situation is more critical in some areas and for some vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, the chronically ill, pregnant women, children and those with mental health problems. Despite the above, the absence of public policies focused on emergency management or an adaptation plan with urban, economic and social measures aimed at resilience is evident. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the risk associated with extreme heat for the Greater Santiago region and a study of public policies compared in 17 cities with similar challenges, it is proposed that the Metropolitan Region needs a plan for the prevention and management of the threat from extreme heat that incorporates an early warning system, specific action plans for different institutions, and a medium and long-term roadmap to improve the urban and social resilience of the city. This seeks to create effective governance, assigning clear responsibilities and providing adequate resources for proactive and adaptive public policies to confront extreme heat, mitigating its adverse effects on the population and the environment.\n\nArizona's Extreme Heat Preparedness Plan\n\nHeat relief and preparedness work is not new to Arizona, and this Plan builds on the foundation laid by local governments, universities, and organizations (See Spotlights for examples of innovative initiatives on heat preparedness and Appendix C for heat-preparedness milestones). OOR engaged extensively with subject-matter experts and organizations including Arizona State University’s Knowledge Exchange for Resilience (KER), the Human Services Campus, the Arizona Faith Network, cities and towns, and utilities. OOR also invited the public to weigh in on heat-related issues during the planning process. In collaboration with KER, OOR held two state agency workshops to identify knowledge gaps, areas that require additional research, and opportunities for future collaboration and coordination. Agencies used this time to better understand how they can mitigate extreme heat risks throughout their daily operations and how they can better respond to extreme heat events.\n\nHeat Stress Management Plan For Sport Fraternity - Singapore\n\nSince 2016, the Homefront (i.e., ministries/statutory boards) has relied on a Heatwave Contingency Plan that was based on temperatures reaching up to 35°C over a prolonged period. However, learning from the severity of 2022’s heatwave episodes in Europe and China and more severe climate change projections, MSE has formed a workgroup comprising representatives from MOE, MOH, MOM, NEA, MCCY, PA, SportSG, to review and align contingency plans for the Homefront. SportSG has since updated the Heat Stress Management Plan for reference and use by the sports fraternity.\n\nImplementing nature-based solutions through multi-sector, multi-organisation collaboration to enhance urban resilience to climate change in Malaysia\n\nDue to climate change, Malaysia is projected to experience 200 heat wave days per year by 2050 and a significant increase in floods and storms. This will impact the health and well-being of the population from heat-stress related illness, injury from floods and storms, impact mental health due to loss of property and life, increase allergies due to weather changes, increase vector and water-borne diseases and cause potential malnutrition due to food insecurity.\n\nAI for Resilient Cities: bringing together technology and community outreach for heat-health interventions in India\n\nClimate change is causing an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts. Extreme weather events lead to loss of human life and have devastating consequences on socio-economic outcomes. In India, most vulnerable communities do not have access to either information about the occurrence of these events, or the understanding of risk from current warnings. This lack of useful information inhibits pre-emptive and potentially life saving action.\n\nOccupational heat stress intervention to prevent Chronic Kidney Disease of undetermined causes (CKDnT) among sugarcane workers in Nicaragua\n\nMany laborers are confronted with occupational heat stress from physically demanding work in high environmental temperatures with inadequate protections. Heat stress has multiple well-established adverse health outcomes, including increased accidents, heart attacks, heat illness, stroke, and organ damage including kidney diseases. All are potentially fatal and associated with decreased productivity. Heat stress and its health effects harm workers, communities, employers, and health systems. Active intervention in a warming world is required. Chronic Kidney Disease of undetermined causes (CKDnT) is a fatal progressive loss of kidney function that has killed more than 40,000 people in Mesoamerica and Sri Lanka alone in the last 10 years. Treatment is out of reach for most ensuring an early death for those affected.\n\nWomen climate champions fighting heatwaves and reshaping the urban climate agenda\n\nThis case studies outlines Mahila Housing Trust’s scalable model of woman-led education programme on climate change and health-related risks in urban settlements. Their model uses communication methods to introduce the concept of climate change and build climate resilience among vulnerable communities in India.\n\nREFLECT Study - Understanding the impact of cool roofs on health, environmental & economic outcomes\n\nAs climate change continues to intensify, so will the adverse effects of extreme heat for LMIC communities living in climate hotspots in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Oceania. Identifying effective climate change adaptation interventions that can be implemented in these diverse communities will support people, organisations, and governments to make climate change adaptation investment decisions. Therefore, this project aims to address extreme heat effects using cool roofs as an efficient solution for lowering indoor temperatures without the need for expensive air conditioning or other energy-intensive coolers. Its benefits encompass passive operation, low-cost, and durability. Cool roofs can work to mitigate adverse health, environmental, and economic impacts by:\n\nReflecting sunlight​ to reduce indoor temperatures​\n\nImproving occupant comfort and health\n\nIncreasing occupant productivity ​\n\n​Lowering energy use ​\n\nModelling risks due to urban transformation and climate change scenarios\n\nClimate change scenarios for Rotterdam show multiple future challenges. With rising temperatures, heat stress due to the urban heat island effect is increasing. With rising sea levels, the influx of saltwater into the river delta around Rotterdam is increasing. Peak weather events will lead to challenges for water storage both in the city of Rotterdam and its surrounding areas close to the Rhine and Meuse rivers. Urban transformation and other adaptation measures to overcome these challenges might affect mosquito, rodent, and bird populations.\n\nHandheld access to actionable heat risk and response information in eight global cities\n\nCHALLENGE\n\nThe health impacts of extreme heat are predictable and largely avoidable, provided that city authorities have access to timely and location-specific information. With the right data and tools, city authorities can identify local hot spots, optimize the allocation and management of cooling centres, ensure sufficient drinking water spots and cooling spaces and communicate the health-related risks of excessive heat. Citizens and visitors can plan their daily lives in the city safely knowing the risks, and can adapt their routines accordingly. The challenge then is to improve access to information so that city authorities can reduce heat-related illness and deaths.\n\nAPPROACH\n\nEXTREMA Global148 is a portfolio of digital services based on open Earth observation data as well as climate and atmosphere models and local data, targeting cities and citizens with city-specific customizations. It was originally designed to lessen the impacts of heatwaves on public health, and to make cities more heat resilient. The core services of EXTREMA Global include a free, multilingual mobile app that uses data and services to provide the current heat risk at the location of the user and recommendations for health protection, including directions to the nearest cooling places and drinking water spots and public announcements from city authorities. The app supports multiple profiles, allowing users to check on family members in multiple locations. The city authorities access tools and alerts through a dashboard to help them manage their resources to reduce heat exposure. City authorities also have access to satellite-derived maps showing the distribution of surface temperature in order to identify hot spots and areas that need intervention, through for example, the planning, design and management of urban infrastructure. The smartphone app also has optional modules that allow for the integration of air quality data from Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) and provision of relevant health instructions. EXTREMA Global services are already being used in the municipalities of Athens, Milan, Paris, Rotterdam, Greater London (UK), and in Chicago, Tampa and Newark in the USA.\n\nRESULT\n\nAthens (Greece) was the first city in which the concept was adopted in 2016. City authorities worked to design the app to meet the city requirements, and have since included the app in the #CoolAthens campaign. They have also included the add-on to provide air quality data at the location of the user, and use high-resolution temperature distribution maps to guide planning. The combination of air quality and heat risk proved to be very useful in July 2021 when Athens experienced a severe heatwave that lasted 10 days and saw temperatures reach about 44 °C, with very poor air quality due to nearby wildfires sparked by the heat. The EXTREMA app suggests “cool routes” where users can walk safely around the city, for example, between tourist attractions, a feature much needed for tourists. In July 2023, during a heatwave that lasted 14 days, app requests by Athenians and visitors reached 10 000 hits. Furthermore, the app contributed drastically to strengthening communication between the departments of the municipality to exchange know-how and data. In Milan, hundreds of drinking water spots are mapped in the app, making use of the digital infrastructure to also decrease the use of plastic bottles. Publicity and dissemination by the city authorities play a critical role in the use and impact of the app, with peak usage dates coinciding with days in which the city promoted the app in the local press. In 2022, the app received 6 324 requests for service from Milan. Milan is now using digital services to calculate the safest and coolest routes for bicycles.\n\nIn Athens, the EXTREMA app supports six languages to help tourists find their nearest cooling space and the coolest route to their destination.\n\nPARTNERS National Observatory of Athens, Group on Earth Observations (GEO), Global Urban Observation and Information (GUOI) initiative, ARTi Analytics B.V., Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), Bloomberg Associates\n\nEarly warning system for extreme temperatures in Argentina\n\nCHALLENGE\n\nExtreme temperatures have serious and direct effects on public health. In the summer of 2013–2014 Argentina experienced record heatwaves and preventable deaths. This motivated additional studies of the impact of extreme heat on health, with the aim of developing a health impact-based warning system.\n\nTwo studies established the statistical relationship between the occurrence of extreme temperatures and the increase in mortality. The studies were carried out jointly by the Ministry of Health, the National Meteorological Service, the National University of Entre Ríos, the National University of La Matanza and the University of Buenos Aires.\n\nMortality was analysed by sex, age and cause of death, and results indicated that mortality increased significantly in both extreme hot and cold temperatures. The mortality risk during heatwaves increased in 13 of the 18 provinces analysed. For extreme cold temperatures, risk of death significantly increased in the week following a cold day in 10 of the 21 cities analysed, while cold waves were associated with an increased risk of death in the following two weeks in 10 cities. Based on the evidence of extreme temperature episodes in Argentina driving increased negative health outcomes, an early warning system (EWS) for extreme temperatures was deemed necessary to reduce preventable deaths.\n\nAPPROACH\n\nThe objective of the EWS for extreme temperatures is to enable the population, the health system and civil protection organizations to take the appropriate prevention, mitigation and response measures at each alert level. Development of the EWS occurred in several phases.\n\nFirstly, an EWS for Heatwaves and Health was developed and tested in two cities.132 Subsequently, in 2017 and based on the results of a study,133 the alert thresholds were adapted.\n\nFinally, in 2021, the EWS began to cover the entire national territory (sub-divided into 168 fixed regions) and was renamed the EWS for Extreme Heat Temperatures. In the same way, the EWS for Extreme Cold Temperatures was created. The system issues alerts at different levels (yellow, orange and red). The alert thresholds were established based on the 90th percentile for heat (and the 10th percentile for extreme cold) of each city.\n\nRESULT\n\nDuring the warm period from October 2021 to March 2022, 987 daily alerts were issued for extreme heat (615 yellow, 205 orange and 167 red). Likewise, during the EWS for Extreme Cold Temperatures test period, from 9 June to 20 September 2021, 239 daily alerts were issued for extreme cold (197 yellow, 37 orange and 5 red).\n\nThe alerts were communicated to health and civil protection agencies at the national level, as well as to the general population through different media. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the system is planned. Under this system the weather alerts are issued by the Argentinian National Meteorological Service, and the Ministry of Health issues recommendations for health care.\n\nLIMITATIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED\n\nThe Early Warning System for Extreme Temperatures (SAT-TE in Spanish) has climatic thresholds for which the significant increase in mortality was evaluated epidemiologically. Two studies established the statistical relationship between the occurrence of extreme temperatures and the increase in mortality.\n\nHowever, future studies could evaluate the temperature at which mortality increases significantly, both for extreme cold and extreme heat. The main actions carried out are preventive, with little development of those aimed at mitigation and response. There is still a long way to go to complete the system, including improving the criteria for issuing alerts so that they contemplate different scenarios, such as power cuts or water shortages, among others.\n\nDuring the warm period from October 2021 to March 2022, 987 daily alerts were issued for extreme heat.\n\nPARTNERS: Ministry of Health of Argentina\n\nCan simple home modifications reduce the health effects of heat in Kenya?\n\nGlobal warming is expected to exacerbate heat-related illness, especially in Africa. This not only has an impact on an individual’s health, but also their ability to work, and therefore reduces the economic productivity at a community level. Simple modifications to doors, windows and eaves in a home could help to alleviate these effects. Dr Abong’o will lead a team investigating the effectiveness of simple housing modifications, assessing their impact on cooling internal temperatures as well as their ability to lower the incidence of malaria by preventing indoor entry of mosquitoes.\n\nHow can simple behavioural and structural changes protect people from extreme heat in Southeast Asia?\n\nIn Southeast Asia, annual heat-related mortality is projected to increase by 295% by 2030 if there is no adaptation. To strengthen heat adaptation in Malaysia, Professor Tin Tin Su and her team will evaluate simple behavioural and structural interventions that have the potential to protect vulnerable communities from the health effects of extreme heat. They will introduce interventions that will improve heat health literacy and fluency for individuals and communities and test a passive cooling technology to decrease indoor exposure to extreme heat.\n\nWhat are the most effective heat-health interventions for vulnerable urban and rural populations in South Asia?\n\nSouth Asia is one of the regions most affected by increasing global temperatures and extreme heat events, but more evidence is needed to determine the most appropriate strategies for heat adaptation and harm reduction. Through community participation and pilot testing, this study will assess a possible package of heat-health interventions in representative urban and rural settings in Pakistan. Professor Bhutta and the team will also review global evidence of community-based heat adaptation strategies and use this to evaluate and implement a locally appropriate heat adaptation and reduction plan.\n\nHow can a heat-health action plan help to manage the effects of heat in rural Mexico?\n\nRural communities in low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable to heat-related illnesses. Heat action plans that aide the public in understanding and evaluating their own risks and take the appropriate steps for prevention and preparedness have shown consistently positive results. Working in six rural communities in southern Mexico, Dr Riojas and the team will co-develop, test and evaluate a user-driven heat-health action plan, including an early warning and surveillance system, capacity building, prevention education and communication tools.\n\nHow can the health risks of extreme heat on pregnant women and newborns be reduced?\n\nThe negative impacts of heat exposure on maternal and child health outcomes are well documented, but there is little evidence to help us understand how best to reduce the risk of extreme heat on pregnant women. Professor Chersich will lead this study investigating a range of potential protective mechanisms, covering behavioural, built environment and environmental innovations. The team will work across six maternity facilities and the surrounding communities of urban areas in South Africa and semi-rural parts of Zimbabwe.\n\nWhat are the benefits of heat adaptation for vulnerable groups in sub-Saharan Africa?\n\nDespite a high vulnerability to heat-related health risks, interventions which investigate and implement heat adaptions are lacking in sub-Saharan Africa. Professors New and Dugas, and their collaborators, hope to address this evidence gap by evaluating physical and behavioural adaptations among manual labourers and low-income house dwellers in four study sites across Ghana and South Africa. The study will also develop and test heat warning systems to support these adaptations and gather high-quality data on physiological and mental health, as well as key climate, environmental and socio-economic variables.\n\nAre cool roofs an effective solution for reducing heat exposure in vulnerable housing?\n\nLow- and middle-income countries are severely affected by climate change, but evidence for guiding uptake of suitable interventions is currently limited. Dr Tukuitonga and Dr Bunker will lead a global multi-centre trial in Burkina Faso, India, Niue and Mexico to assess the effects of affordable, sunlight-reflecting cool-roof coatings — an effective home cooling intervention — on health, environmental and economic outcomes for vulnerable populations. The findings will inform global adaptation and policy responses to increasing heat exposure from climate change.\n\nCan trees reduce heat stress in agricultural workers?\n\nTree restoration plays an important role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, we don’t yet have evidence of the human health benefits of this restoration or the impact it has on reducing heat stress. Dr Chiwanga will lead this comprehensive study to evaluate how trees can be used to alter microclimates and protect Tanzania’s millions of outdoor agricultural workers from the long-term health risks of heat exposure. The research will build on land restoration work in central Tanzania which has championed local farmers to regenerate nine million native trees in three years.\n\n“Fan-First” Cooling – a low-carbon way to improve heat resilience in a changing climate\n\nMitigating climate change is vital, but inevitable rising temperatures means that identifying sustainable cooling strategies is also important. Strategies at the individual scale that focus on cooling the person instead of the surrounding air can be effectively adopted, even in low-resource settings.\n\nThis report presents the evidence behind “Fan-First” cooling as a low-carbon approach to improving heat resilience.\n\nQueensland Health's Heatwave Management Sub-Plan\n\nImpact of Climate Change on the Health of Peruvians: Challenges and Strategies for a Comprehensive Response\n\nClimate change has a negative impact on the health of every society, including the Peruvian population. The effects of climate change, such as increased temperature or extreme weather events, are the cause of diseases, for example, air pollution (from forest fires), or water pollution (from floods). Likewise, these effects can lead to direct injuries from extreme events or chronic malnutrition by reducing agricultural production. Which can even increase vector-borne infections, such as dengue fever. In addition, the loss of infrastructure in health services, political instability and poor climate governance amplify these risks and significantly threaten the health and well-being of the Peruvian population.\n\nA Game Plan for Heat Stress: Policy Recommendations for High School Sports\n\nHigh school athletic associations (HSAAs) bear the responsibility of ensuring the health and safety of student-athletes. Exertional heat illness poses a significant risk, making this a task of increasing urgency in light of climate change and rising temperatures.\n\nThis policy brief, from Duke University’s Heat Policy Innovation Hub, builds on prior research to offer recommendations to HSAAs as part of an ongoing commitment to safeguard student-athletes from heat-related illnesses:\n\nImplement environmental heat monitoring using a scientific device for onsite measurement of a heat stress index appropriate for the local climate, with staff training to ensure measurement precision.\n\nDevelop activity modification guidelines contingent on heat stress levels.\n\nIncorporate specific heat action protocols into existing venue-specific emergency action plans.\n\nInstitute universal application of heat policies across all sports and activities.\n\nSupport full implementation by pursuing funding opportunities for measurement equipment and establishing incentives for compliance among member schools.\n\nOccupational heat stress in outdoor works: the need for regulation\n\nThis policy brief discusses cost of extreme heat for outdoor workers/employers in low-and middle-income countries and provides cost-effective protection measures. It calls for workplace interventions and regulation to improve productivity and health.\n\nHeat-attributable mortality in Spain\n\nThis online application calculates daily mortality due to heat in Spain, using methodology is based on the March 2023 paper Heat-attributable Mortality in the Summer of 2022 in Spain The application uses the daily mortality data for Spain from the All-cause Daily Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo) and the average summer temperature (June, July and August) in Spain calculated from the reference stations defined by the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET).\n\nWorking under the 2021 Heat Dome: A Content Analysis of Occupational Impacts Mentioned in the Canadian Media\n\nExtreme heat events directly impact worker health and cause additional cascading and transitional workplace impacts. However, current investigations on these impacts often rely on specific datasets (e.g., compensation claims, hospitalizations). Thus, to continue to work towards preventing and mitigating the occupational risks posed by extreme heat events, this study aimed to explore the occupational impacts of the 2021 Heat Dome in Canada using a qualitative content analysis method on a news-based dataset. A systematized review of news articles published before, during, and after the 2021 Heat Dome was conducted on academic (n = 8) and news (n = 5) databases, along with targeted grey literature. Two researchers qualitatively coded the articles in NVivo for occupational impacts or references mentioned within the articles. Overall, 52 different occupations were identified as being impacted by the 2021 Heat Dome. Impacts were diverse and ranged from work cancellations or delays to work modifications and reports of heat-related illnesses. The 2021 Heat Dome impacted the health and safety of many occupational groups and provided new insights into the expanding impacts that extreme heat events can have on the Canadian workforce. With climate projections showing a growing trend of more hot days and intense heat waves in Canada, addressing these concerns should be a critical priority.\n\nWorking under the 2021 Heat Dome: A Content Analysis of Occupational Impacts Mentioned in the Canadian Media\n\nExtreme heat events directly impact worker health and cause additional cascading and transitional workplace impacts.

Policy considerations to protect against indoor overheating are also outlined.\n\nHeat Stress & Exercise Risk Tool\n\nThis web tool allows users to select their city or Zip code and an activity such as cycling, walking or distance running to determine the level of risk over the course of the day.\n\nPlan Integration for Resilience Scorecard (PIRS) for Heat\n\nThe combination of climate change and the urban heat island (UHI) effect is increasing the number of dangerously hot days and the need for all communities to plan for urban heat resilience equitably. Urban heat resilience requires an integrated planning approach that coordinates strategies across community plans and uses the best available heat risk information to prioritize heat mitigation strategies for the most vulnerable communities. The Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard™ (PIRS™) for Heat is an approach that communities can use to analyze how heat mitigation policies are integrated into different plans and to identify opportunities to better target heat mitigation policies in high heat risk areas.\n\nThe PIRS™ for Heat was developed as an extension of the original Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard™, a methodology, originally developed by Berke et al. (2015) and then further advanced and translated to planning practice by Malecha et al. (2019), for spatially evaluating networks of plans to reduce vulnerability to hazards. With support from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office’s Climate Adaptation Partnerships and Extreme Heat Risk Initiative and in partnership with the American Planning Association, PIRS™ for Heat was piloted in five geographically diverse U.S. communities, including Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, Fort Lauderdale, FL, Seattle, WA, and Houston, TX.\n\nThis guidebook explains the rationale for the PIRS™ for Heat, provides a step-by-step guide for any practitioner or researcher interested in applying the methodology, includes a detailed and ready-to-go worksheet, and summarizes key plan integration findings from five communities across the U.S. There is also an accompanying individual case study report with the PIRS™ for Heat results for Kent, WA.\n\nThis guidebook is available free to all. This project was supported by financial assistance provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Adaptation Partnerships and Extreme Heat Risk Initiative.\n\nRetrofitting passive cooling strategies to combat heat stress in the face of climate change: A case study of a ready-made garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh\n\nThe ready-made garment industry is critical to the Bangladesh economy. There is an urgent need to improve current working conditions and build capacity for heat mitigation as conditions worsen due to climate change. We modelled a typical, mid-sized, non-air-conditioned factory in Bangladesh and simulated how the indoor thermal environment is altered by four rooftop retrofits (1. extensive green roof, 2. rooftop shading, 3. white cool roof, 4. insulated white cool roof) on present-day and future decades under different climate scenarios. Simulations showed that all strategies reduce indoor air temperatures by around 2 °C on average and reduce the number of present-day annual work-hours during which wet-bulb globe temperature exceeds the standardised limits for moderate work rates by up to 603 h – the equivalent of 75 (8 h) working days per year. By 2050 under a high-emissions scenario, indoor conditions with a rooftop intervention are comparable to present-day conditions. To reduce the growing need for carbon-intensive air-conditioning, sustainable heat mitigation strategies need to be incorporated into a wider range of solutions at the individual, building, and urban level. The results presented here have implications for factory planning and retrofit design, and may inform policies targeting worker health, well-being, and productivity.\n\nHeatReady Schools\n\nSchools are hubs for their surrounding community, connecting parents, teachers, children, and families. Hence, the heat conditions at schools, as well as their preparedness and policies for managing extreme heat, impact multiple aspects of the community. However, minimal attention has been paid to formalizing school heat preparedness, ensuring their ability to mitigate the effects of high temperatures on the health and education of students. Since commencing in 2017, this project has sought to improve the safety and protection measures for children exposed to extreme heat during the school day by understanding the important factors for becoming a HeatReady School. We define HeatReady Schools as those that are increasingly able to identify, prepare for, mitigate, track, and respond to the negative impacts of schoolground heat (Shortridge et al., 2021). Through this research, we have improved our understanding of how people perceive and react to heat emergencies, as well as what actions are taken at the school level to mitigate their effects. Based on interviews with key stakeholders, we have gauged the effectiveness of existing heat preparedness actions at schools in the Phoenix area. Our thirty final recommendations based on five action areas (raining, prevention, school policy, community, and environment) are providing important “HeatReady” actions that can be applied or adapted for various school contexts and/or climate regions. To date, we have reached over 30 schools and community centers utilizing HeatReady Schools resources, a number that continues to grow. We have also created a HeatReady Schools growth tree and rubric, share numerous resources with our members, and have developed multiple training resources for schools to leverage (e.g., Bilingual K-12 Summer Emergency Preparedness course, HeatReady Teacher Training). These trainings also support work within HeatReady Neighborhoods, within which schools are a critical player for heat readiness.\n\nHeat-health vulnerabilities in the climate change context—comparing risk profiles between indoor and outdoor workers in developing country settings\n\nOccupational heat stress is a crucial risk factor for a range of Heat-Related Illnesses (HRI). Outdoor workers in unorganized work sectors exposed to high ambient temperatures are at increased risk in developing countries. We aim to compare HRI, Productivity Loss (PL), and reduced renal health risk between workers from outdoor unorganized (N = 1053) and indoor organized (N = 1051) work sectors. Using descriptive methods and a large epidemiological cross-sectional study using mixed methods, we compared risk patterns between the two groups. We analyzed the risk of self-reported HRI symptoms, Heat Strain Indicators (HSIs), PL, and reduced kidney function using Multivariate Logistic Regression (MLR) models. Although Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) exposures were high in both the outdoor and indoor sectors, significantly more Outdoor Unorganized Workers (OUWs) reported heat stress symptoms (45.2% vs 39.1%) among 2104 workers. OUWs had a significantly higher share of the heavy workload (86.7%) and long years of heat exposures (41.9%), the key drivers of HRIs, than the workers in indoor sectors. MLR models comparing the indoor vs outdoor workers showed significantly increased risk of HRI symptoms (Adjusted Odds Ratio) (AORoutdoor = 2.1; 95% C.I:1.60–2.77), HSI (AORoutdoor = 1.7; 95% C.I:1.00–2.93), PL (AORoutdoor = 11.4; 95% C.I:7.39–17.6), and reduced kidney function (Crude Odds Ratio) (CORoutdoor = 1.4; 95% C.I:1.10–1.84) for the OUWs. Among the heat-exposed workers, OUW had a higher risk of HRI, HSI, and PL even after adjusting for potential confounders. The risk of reduced kidney function was significantly higher among OUWs, particularly for those with heat exposures and heavy workload (AORoutdoor = 1.5; 95% C.I: 0.96–2.44, p = 0.073) compared to the indoor workers. Further, in-depth studies, protective policies, feasible interventions, adaptive strategies, and proactive mitigation efforts are urgently needed to avert health and productivity risks for a few million vulnerable workers in developing nations as climate change proceeds.\n\nReducing the Impact of Extreme Heat to Improve Well-Being in Cities\n\nA project developing low-cost options for reducing heat stress in urban contexts.\n\nCities in the Global South experience extreme weather that impacts infrastructure and disproportionately affects the well-being of the urban poor. Extreme heat is an often hidden, yet chronic threat to urban populations, exacerbating vulnerabilities and inequalities. This project aims to co-develop interventions and low-cost options for remodelling formally- and informally built spaces in culturally sensitive ways to reduce heat stress and improve well-being. The interdisciplinary research team will conduct temperature and humidity measurements, interviews, auto-photography and thermal modelling, and construct experimental buildings to explore how heat stress experienced in homes, workplaces and health facilities impacts on well-being, as well as how perceptions of well-being influence the infrastructural decisions of residents and policy makers. REFIT aims to improve the well-being of city dwellers in Ghana and provide new knowledge and insights about adaptations to extreme heat relevant across the Global South.\n\nVulnerability to Extreme Weather Events in Cities: Implications for Infrastructure and Livelihoods\n\nThis project brings together an expert, interdisciplinary team to investigate the impacts of flooding and extreme heat on urban infrastructure and the resultant consequences for the livelihoods of poor urban residents in Ghana.\n\nMany cities in the global South are increasingly experiencing extreme weather events, which are having devastating impacts on infrastructure and human lives. The main aims of “Vulnerability to Extreme Weather Events in Cities: Implications for Infrastructure and Livelihoods” (VEWEC) are to:\n\nRefine methods for mapping ‘hotspots’ of vulnerability and predicting flooding and extreme heat in cities by drawing on existing climate data\n\nExamine the impact of flooding and extreme heat on water, electricity and health services\n\nAnalyse the impact of reduced service levels during extreme weather events on the income-generating activities of the urban poor\n\nCo-produce adaptive strategies to extreme weather events with residents, service providers and policymakers\n\nThe cities of Accra and Tamale, with their differing climates, urban form and size, infrastructure and governance systems, provide contrasting cases within one national context. This project focuses on four areas within each city that have been selected as representative of neighbourhoods suffering from either flooding and/or extreme temperatures. For Accra these are Odawna, Bortianor, Agbogbloshie and Alajo. For Tamale they are Gumani, Sakasaka, Kukuo and Lamashegu.\n\nPut simply, key questions being asked include:\n\nWhere, when and how are climate hazards impacting Accra and Tamale?\n\nWhat actions are already being taken by communities and service providers to adapt to flooding and extreme temperatures?\n\nWhat further action could be taken?\n\nThe views and experiences of key stakeholders and residents of the study communities are being sought using qualitative methods, including in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Household-level temperature data will be collected using tiny-tag sensors located within and outside houses and businesses.\n\nThis collaborative research is being conducted by climate scientists, human geographers, health specialists and infrastructure engineers based at Loughborough University, the University of Ghana, and the University for Development Studies (Tamale).\n\nOvercoming the incumbency and barriers to sustainable cooling\n\nThis article examines cooling in the built environment, an area of rapidly rising energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, the status quo of cooling is assessed and proposals are made for how to advance towards sustainable cooling through five levers of change: social interactions, technology innovations, business models, governance and infrastructure design. Achieving sustainable cooling requires navigating the opportunities and barriers presented by the incumbent technology that currently dominates the way in which cooling is provided—the vapour-compression refrigerant technology (or air-conditioners). Air-conditioners remain the go-to solution for growing cooling demand, with other alternatives often overlooked. This incumbent technology has contributed to five barriers hindering the transition to sustainable cooling: (1) building policies based exclusively on energy efficiency; (2) a focus on temperature rather than other thermal comfort variables; (3) building-centric design of cooling systems instead of occupant-centric design; (4) businesses guided by product-only sales; and (5) lack of innovation beyond the standard operational phase of the incumbent technology. Opportunities and priority actions are identified for policymakers, cooling professionals, technicians and citizens to promote a transition towards sustainable cooling.\n\nPolicy relevance\n\nThe priority actions that can overcome key barriers to a sustainable cooling pathway are as follows. (1) Moving building policies beyond energy efficiency to address climate mitigation and adaptation for improving the heat resilience of the built environment. Building indicators are needed to measure the passive survivability to heat. (2) Conventional cooling control and related regulations based exclusively on air temperature require expansion in scope to consider a wider range of thermal comfort variables, thus stimulating technological innovation. (3) Shifting building-centric cooling control to an occupant-centric design, downsizing centralised cooling requirements and enabling adaptive environments integrating personalised environmental control systems. (4) Business models moving from product-oriented to service-based businesses. (5) Environmental cooling considerations that address the humidity influence, the role of energy storage to support renewables through energy flexibility in cooling, and the impact of F-gases. Regulation and citizen empowerment through better environmental labelling can play an important role.\n\nKeywords: adaptation, barriers, building design, buildings, cooling, heat resilience, incumbency, mitigation, passive cooling, sustainable cooling, thermal comfort\n\nHeat-Resilient Schoolyards: Relations Between Temperature, Shade, and Physical Activity of Children During Recess\n\nBackground: Extreme heat may discourage physical activity of children while shade may provide thermal comfort. The authors determined the associations between ambient temperature, shade, and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) of children during school recess. Methods: Children aged 8–10 (n = 213) wore accelerometers and global positioning system monitors during recess at 3 school parks in Austin, Texas (September–November 2019). Weather data originated from 10 sensors per park. The authors calculated shade from imagery using a geographic information system (GIS) and time-matched physical activity, location, temperature, and shade data. The authors specified piecewise multilevel regression to assess relations between average temperature and percentage of recess time in MVPA and shade. Results: Temperature ranged 11 °C to 35 °C. Each 1 °C higher temperature was associated with a 0.7 percentage point lower time spent in MVPA, until 33 °C (91 °F) when the association changed to a 1.5 lower time (P < .01). Each 1 °C higher temperature was associated with a 0.3 percentage point higher time spent under shade, until 33 °C when the association changed to a 3.4 higher time (P < .001). At 33 °C or above, the direct association between shade and MVPA weakened (P < .05), with no interaction effect above 33 °C (P > .05). Children at the park with the most tree canopy spent 6.0 percentage points more time in MVPA (P < .01). Conclusions: Children engage in less MVPA and seek shade during extreme heat and engage in more MVPA in green schoolyards. With climate change, schools should consider interventions (eg, organizing shaded play, tree planting) to promote heat safe MVPA.\n\nExtreme heat events, high ambient temperatures and human morbidity and mortality in Africa: A systematic review\n\nTemperature extremes vary across Africa. A continent-wide examination of the impacts of heat on health in Africa, and a synthesis of Africa-informed evidence is, however, lacking. A systematic review of articles published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1992 and April 2019 was conducted. To be eligible, articles had to be Africa-specific, in English, and focused on how heatwaves and high ambient temperatures affect morbidity and mortality. A secondary systematic analysis on policies and interventions comprising 17 studies was also conducted, and the findings synthesised together with those of the 20 primary studies. Eleven studies showed that high ambient temperatures and heat waves are linked with increased mortality rates in Africa. These linkages are characterised by complex, linear and non-linear (J or U) relationships. Eight of the nine primary studies of morbidity outcome reported that an increase in temperature was accompanied"
