        "text": "The Rhodes Academy of Oceans Law and Policy is an international collegial institution dedicated to fostering a better understanding of the modern law of the sea. Through education on the principles of contemporary oceans law and policy, the Rhodes Academy seeks to promote adherence to the rule of law in the world's oceans. Founded in 1995, the Academy held its inaugural session in the summer of 1996 and operates on an annual basis.\n\nThe Rhodes Academy is a cooperative undertaking by international law experts and sponsoring universities and institutions. The current Directors are Robert Beckman, Centre for International Law, National University of Singapore (Singapore); Tomas Heidar, Law of the Sea Institute of Iceland (Reykjavik, Iceland); John Norton Moore, Professor Emeritus, University of Virginia (Charlottesville, Virginia, USA); Alex Oude Elferink, Netherlands Institute for the Law of the Sea, Utrecht University (Utrecht, the Netherlands); Nikos Skourtos, Aegean Institute of the Law of the Sea and Maritime Law (Rhodes, Greece); and RÃ¼diger Wolfrum, Max Planck Foundation for International Peace and the Rule of Law (Heidelberg, Germany). The School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering at the University of New Hampshire (USA), the Korea Maritime Institute (Busan, Korea) and the Ankara University National Center for the Sea and Maritime Law (Ankara, Turkey) are associate sponsors. For many years the International Seabed Authority has provided science scholarships for developing country students. Myron Nordquist, former Associate Director of the Center for Oceans Law and Policy, coordinates the substantive portions of the Rhodes Academy while staff attend to administrative arrangements. Administrative activities outside Rhodes are managed by Judy Ellis, the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering at the University of New Hampshire, while Spiros Loupis at the Aegean Institute coordinates local arrangements in Rhodes.\n\nRhodes Academy Past & Future\n\nAbout the Program\n\nThe Academy entails an intensive, three-week course of study, with lectures by leading jurists, practitioners, and international law faculty from around the world. Although it is a single course of study, the program is divided into two distinct units. The first two weeks focus on the foundations of modern oceans law, recent developments, and an overview of the 1982 United Nations Conference of the Law of the Sea. In the second week, several short courses address specific topics under the rubric of oceans law and policy. The third week typically focuses on an issue of current concern to the international community. Passing an optional examination enables students to receive a diploma from the Rhodes Academy.\n\nIn comments prepared for the inaugural session of the Rhodes Academy, United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said, \"The objective of your academy, fostering a better understanding of the law of the sea, is one to which the United Nations has dedicated itself almost since its inception. The success of the Academy is therefore of particular interest to the United Nations. . . . The exchange of ideas and other forms of cooperation between the United Nations and the Academy should serve our common purpose of fostering a better understanding of the law of the sea.\"\n\nThe student body of the Rhodes Academy is kept relatively small to allow for maximum interaction among students and lecturers. The distinguished international faculty and diverse student body are strengths of the Academy, bringing together different perspectives on global and regional issues. These elements make the Rhodes Academy a unique educational opportunity, and facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the principles of oceans law and policy as reflected in the practice of States, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and a myriad of related international agreements.\n\nScholarships/Financial Aid\n\nThe great majority of students are self-paying. The Academy has a small number of scholarships available that are offered based on high academic merit and financial need. The scholarships are extremely competitive due to the many requests received for each session. Virtually all of the few scholarships are designated by their grantees for applicants from developing nations. Students are urged to make every effort to secure their own funding in advance. Requests for financial aid considerations should be indicated in your application.\n\nThere is an annual scholarship sponsored by the International Cable Protection Committee for the best written paper on a submarine cable topic. The winner is awarded a full scholarship to the Rhodes Academy (alumni receive a cash prize): ICPC Writing Award"
