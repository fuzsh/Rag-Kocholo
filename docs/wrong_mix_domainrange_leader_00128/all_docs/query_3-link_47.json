        "text": "Reissued with updates to Country Summary.\n\nExercise increased caution in Brazil due to crime. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.\n\nDo not travel to:\n\nAny areas within 150 km/100 miles of Brazil’s land borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay due to crime. (Note: This does not apply to the Foz do Iguacu National Park or Pantanal National Park.)\n\nInformal housing developments (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, comunidades, and/or conglomerados) at any time of day due to crime (see additional information below).\n\nBrasilia’s administrative regions (commonly known as “satellite cities”) of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa during non-daylight hours due to crime (see additional information below).\n\nCountry Summary: Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, and carjacking, is common in urban areas, day and night. Gang activity and organized crime is widespread. Assaults, including with sedatives and drugs placed in drinks, are common. U.S. government personnel are discouraged from using municipal buses in all parts of Brazil due to an elevated risk of robbery and assault at any time of day, and especially at night.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Brazil:\n\nBe aware of your surroundings.\n\nDo not physically resist any robbery attempt.\n\nDo not accept food or drinks from strangers.\n\nUse caution when walking or driving at night.\n\nAvoid going to bars or nightclubs alone.\n\nAvoid walking on beaches after dark.\n\nDo not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry.\n\nBe extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.\n\nUse caution at, or going to, major transportation centers or on public transportation, especially at night. Passengers face an elevated risk of robbery or assault using public, municipal bus transportation throughout Brazil.\n\nUse increased caution when hiking in isolated areas.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for Brazil.\n\nPrepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nInternational Borders – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nU.S. government personnel are not permitted to travel to areas within 150 km/100 miles of the international land borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay without advance approval from security officials due to crime. Travel to the Foz do Iguacu National Park and Pantanal National Park is permitted.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nInformal Housing Developments (commonly known as “Favelas”) – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nDo not travel to informal housing developments (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, comunidades, and/or conglomerados), even on a guided tour. Neither the tour companies nor the police can guarantee your safety when entering these communities. Even in these communities that the police or local governments deem safe, the situation can change quickly and without notice. While some informal housing developments have clear boundaries or gates, or even names such as “favela”, “vila”, “comunidade”, or “conglomerado”, other such developments may be less obvious, and may be identified by crowded quarters, poorer conditions, and/or irregular construction. In addition, exercise caution in areas surrounding these communities, as occasionally, inter-gang fighting and confrontations with police move beyond the confines of these communities. Except under limited circumstances and with advance approval, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to enter any informal housing developments in Brazil. Read the Safety and Security Section on the country information page and consult the maps on the Embassy’s website for further information regarding favelas.\n\nVisit our website for Travel High-Risk Areas.\n\nBrasilia’s Administrative Regions (commonly known as “Satellite Cities”) – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nWithout advance approval from security officials, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to travel to Brasilia’s Administrative Regions of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. (non-daylight hours) due to crime.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State serves as the U.S. Central Authority (USCA) for the Hague Abduction Convention. In this capacity, the Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, Directorate for Overseas Citizen Services, Office of Children's Issues facilitates the submission of applications under the Hague Abduction Convention for the return of, or access to, children located in countries that are U.S. treaty partners, including Brazil. Parents are strongly encouraged to contact the Department of State for assistance prior to initiating the Hague process directly with the foreign Central Authority.\n\nContact information:\n\nU.S. Department of State\n\nBureau of Consular Affairs\n\nOffice of Children's Issues\n\nCA/OCS/CI\n\nSA-17, 9th Floor\n\nWashington, DC 20522-1709\n\nTelephone: 1-888-407-4747\n\nOutside the United States or Canada: 1-202-501-4444\n\nWebsite: travel.state.gov\n\nThe Brazilian Central Authority for the Hague Abduction Convention is the Secretaria de Estado dos Direitos Humanos (SEDH). SEDH's role is to perform the duties given to central authorities under the Hague Abduction Convention, including processing Hague Abduction Convention applications for return of and access to children.\n\nThey can be reached at:\n\nSecretaria de Estado dos Direitos Humanos\n\nSetor Comercial Sul - B, Quadra 9, Lote C\n\nEdificio Parque Cidade Corporate\n\nTorre \"A\", 10º andar\n\n70308-200, BRASILIA-DF\n\nTelephone/Fax: +55-61-2025-3481 and +55-61-2025-3975\n\nWebsite\n\nTo initiate a Hague case for return of, or access to, a child in Brazil, the left-behind parent may submit a Hague application to the BCA. The USCA is available to answer questions about the Hague application process, to forward a completed application to the BCA, and to subsequently monitor its progress through the foreign administrative and legal processes. Petitioning parents may also initiate a Hague case for return of, or access to a child in Brazil by retaining a private Brazilian attorney and directly filing a Hague case before a federal court. However, if a Hague case is directly filed before a federal court, the BCA will not monitor the progress of the case and will have no authority to assist in any manner.\n\nThere are no fees for filing Hague applications with either the United States or Brazil. Attorney fees, if necessary, are the sole responsibility of the person hiring the attorney. Additional costs may include airplane tickets for court appearances and for the return of the child, if so ordered.\n\nRetaining a private attorney is not required in order to file Hague Abduction Convention applications with courts in Brazil. However, parents should consider hiring a private attorney to follow up on cases, directly provide information to courts, and generally advise courses of action appropriate for their individual circumstances. A privately-hired attorney should contact the BCA as soon as possible after the Hague Abduction Convention application has been filed. If a parent does not hire a private attorney, the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) will act as the legal representative of the state of Brazil on behalf of Hague applications, because Brazilian law considers Hague abduction cases to be public cases. Therefore, it is important to note that the OAG does not represent the interests of either party. The OAG will file cases with a federal court.\n\nThe Brazilian Bar Association and the Brazil's Defensoria Publica Da Uniao (Public Defender's Office) offer free legal assistance for any type of legal proceeding to those who demonstrate financial need. For additional information, please contact the Brazilian Bar Association, Sao Paulo Section, Legal Assistance Committee at: assistencia.judiciaria@oabsp.org.br.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Brasilia, Brazil posts a list of attorneys including those who specialize in family law.\n\nThis list is provided as a courtesy service only and does not constitute an endorsement of any individual attorney. The Department of State assumes no responsibility or liability for the professional ability or reputation of, or the quality of services provided by, the following persons or firms. Professional credentials and areas of expertise are provided directly by the lawyers."
