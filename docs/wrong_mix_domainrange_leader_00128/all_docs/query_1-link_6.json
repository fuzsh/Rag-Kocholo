        "meta_description": "Abstract. In support of the global stocktake of the Paris Agreement\non climate change, this study presents a comprehensive framework to process\nthe results of an ensemble of atmospheric inversions in order to make their\nnet ecosystem exchange (NEE) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux suitable for\nevaluating national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) submitted by\ncountries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC). From inversions we also deduced anthropogenic methane (CH4)\nemissions regrouped into fossil and agriculture and waste emissions, as well as\nanthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. To compare inversion\nresults with national reports, we compiled a new global harmonized database\nof emissions and removals from periodical UNFCCC inventories by AnnexÂ I\ncountries, and from sporadic and less detailed emissions reports by\nnon-AnnexÂ I countries, given by national communications and biennial update\nreports. No gap filling was applied. The method to reconcile inversions with\ninventories is applied to selected large countries covering â¼90â% of the global land carbon uptake for CO2 and top emitters of\nCH4 and N2O. Our method uses results from an ensemble of global\ninversions produced by the Global Carbon Project for the three greenhouse\ngases, with ancillary data. We examine the role of CO2 fluxes caused by\nlateral transfer processes from rivers and from trade in crop and wood\nproducts and the role of carbon uptake in unmanaged lands, both not\naccounted for by NGHGIs. Here we show that, despite a large spread across\nthe inversions, the median of available inversion models points to a larger\nterrestrial carbon sink than inventories over temperate countries or groups\nof countries of the Northern Hemisphere like Russia, Canada and the European\nUnion. For CH4, we find good consistency between the inversions\nassimilating only data from the global inÂ situ network and those using\nsatellite CH4 retrievals and a tendency for inversions to diagnose\nhigher CH4 emission estimates than reported by NGHGIs. In particular,\noil- and gas-extracting countries in central Asia and the Persian Gulf region\ntend to systematically report lower emissions compared to those estimated by\ninversions. For N2O, inversions tend to produce higher anthropogenic\nemissions than inventories for tropical countries, even when attempting to\nconsider only managed land emissions. In the inventories of many non-AnnexÂ I\ncountries, this can be tentatively attributed to a lack of reporting\nindirect N2O emissions from atmospheric deposition and from leaching to\nrivers, to the existence of natural sources intertwined with managed\nlands, or to an underestimation of N2O emission factors for direct\nagricultural soil emissions. Inversions provide insights into seasonal and\ninterannual greenhouse gas fluxes anomalies, e.g., during extreme events\nsuch as drought or abnormal fire episodes, whereas inventory methods are\nestablished to estimate trends and multi-annual changes. As a much denser\nsampling of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations by different\nsatellites coordinated into a global constellation is expected in the coming\nyears, the methodology proposed here to compare inversion results with\ninventory reports (e.g., NGHGIs) could be applied regularly for monitoring\nthe effectiveness of mitigation policy and progress by countries to meet the\nobjective of their pledges. The dataset constructed by this study is\npublicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5089799 (Deng et al., 2021).",

        "text": "Despite the pledges of many countries to limit or decrease their greenhouse gas emissions through the Paris Agreement in 2015, current trends will likely lead to a warming of 3 to 4ââC (Robiou du Pont and Meinshausen, 2018; UNEP, 2021). Following COP26, many countries have recently announced ambitious plans to become neutral in terms of their net greenhouse gas emissions in the future, with some ambitious near-term reduction targets (Masood and Tollefson, 2021). The global stocktake coordinated by the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) aims to use data from national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) to assess collective climate progress. It is expected there will be differences in the quality of NGHGIs being reported to the UNFCCC (Perugini et al., 2021). UNFCCC AnnexÂ I parties, which include all OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries and several EIT (economy in transition) countries, already report their emissions annually following the same IPCC guidelines (IPCC, 2006) and a common reporting format, with a time latency of roughly 1.5Â years. In contrast, non-AnnexÂ I parties, mostly developing countries and less developed countries, are currently not required to provide reports as regularly and in as much detail as AnnexÂ I parties and use different IPCC guidelines (e.g.,Â Revised IPCC 1996 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, or a mix of the two) in their national communications (NCs) or biennial update reports (BURs) submitted to the UNFCCC. Only by 2024, 1Â year after the first global stocktake scheduled in 2023, will non-AnnexÂ I party countries move to regular and harmonized reporting of their emissions, following the Paris Agreement's enhanced transparency framework (ETF).\n\nThe IPCC guidelines for NGHGIs encourage countries to use independent information to check on emissions and removals (IPCC, 1997, 2006), such as comparisons with independently compiled inventory databases (e.g.,Â IEA (International Energy Agency), CDIAC (Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center), EDGAR (The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research)) or with atmospheric concentration measurements interpreted by atmospheric inversion models (see Sect.Â 6.10.2 in IPCC, 2019). Such a verification of âbottom-upâ national reports against âtop-downâ atmospheric inversion results is not mandatory, although a few countries have already added inversions as a consistency check of their national reports (specifically Switzerland â FOEN, 2021; the United Kingdom â Brown et al., 2021; New Zealand â Ministry for the Environment, 2021; and Australia â DISER, 2021). Here we aim to use the results of available atmospheric inversions with global coverage, focusing on three ensembles of inversions with global coverage published with the global CO2, CH4, and N2O budget assessments coordinated by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) (Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Saunois et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020). These inversions cover up to the last 40Â years for CO2 and approximately the last 20Â years for CH4 and N2O.\n\nInversion results for CO2 land fluxes have been compared with bottom-up inventories in previous research work for the USA (Pacala et al., 2001), Europe (Schulze et al., 2009; Janssens et al., 2005), and China (Piao et al., 2009). Further work was done at the scale of large regions for 9Â large regions in phaseÂ 1 of the REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes (RECCAP1) (Ciais et al., 2020) and is being prepared for 14 regions (Canadell et al., 2012). Previously, inversion results were compared to inventories only for one greenhouse gas (Stavert et al., 2020; Thompson et al., 2019; Chevallier, 2021) or for one country (Kort et al., 2008; Miller and Michalak, 2017; Miller et al., 2019; White et al., 2019; Lunt et al., 2021). Recently, Petrescu et al.Â (2021a, b) provided a synthesis of the three greenhouse gas emissions over the EU27 (27 member states of the EU) and the UK for all major emitting sectors in two companion papers using global and regional inversions, the latter with higher-resolution transport models. They also compared NGHGIs with bottom-up datasets: global inventories, vegetation models, forestry models, and bookkeeping models analyzing specifically land use change fluxes (as part of the synthesis activity of the VERIFY project) (VERIFY, https://verify.lsce.ipsl.fr/, last access: 1Â JulyÂ 2021). Yet, for CO2, they did not make any corrections to CO2 inversions for lateral fluxes (Regnier et al., 2013) even though this was done in earlier European syntheses (Janssens et al., 2005; Ciais et al., 2020).\n\nThis study is a contribution to phaseÂ 2 of the REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes (RECCAP2) initiative and takes the next step forward by analyzing UNFCCC inventories for the three greenhouse gases and key sectors and comparing them with inversions for selected high-emitting countries (or groups of countries) that encompass the majority of global emissions. It also provides detailed methodologies to make inversion results more comparable with inventories, in the context of efforts made by the scientific community following the roadmap of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (The Joint CEOS/CGMS Working Group on Climate, 2020) for using satellite inversions to support the Paris Agreement global stocktake process. The methods presented here are also relevant for the development of a global CO2 monitoring and verification support capacity by the European Copernicus Programme (Pinty et al., 2017, 2019; Copernicus, 2021; Balsamo et al., 2021) (e.g.,Â with the CoCO2 project), and by the NASA carbon monitoring system (e.g.,Â the inversion model intercomparison of using OCO-2 satellite data) (Crowell et al., 2019; NOAA, 2021).\n\nThe main methodological advances of this study include (1)Â the separation of CO2 fluxes from inversions over managed and unmanaged land, the former used to compare with NGHGIs; (2)Â the processing of inversion results at the national level to make them more comparable to NGHGIs by subtracting the CO2 fluxes not accounted for in the NGHGIs from the inversion total flux, such as CO2 fluxes from lateral carbon transport; (3)Â the processing of CH4 inversions to split natural and anthropogenic CH4 emissions, enabling a comparison with NGHGIs that only register anthropogenic emissions; (4)Â a similar treatment of N2O inversion results; and (5)Â accounting for indirect N2O emissions from atmospheric anthropogenic nitrogen deposition and anthropogenic nitrogen leaching to groundwater and inland waters, for the countries that did not report these emissions in their inventories. For AnnexÂ I countries, annual common reporting format (CRF) data were downloaded from the UNFCCC website (UNFCCC, 2021c) with complete information about each sub-sector, whereas for non-AnnexÂ I countries, information about sub-sectors is not consistently reported and a manual analysis and quality check of NC and BUR reports (UNFCCC, 2021a, b) had to be carried out for each individual country analyzed here.\n\nOur inversionâinventory comparison framework is applicable to countries or groups of countries with an area larger than the spatial resolution of atmospheric transport models typically used for inversions. Further, inversions use aÂ priori information on the spatial patterns of fluxes. Some inversions adjust fluxes at the spatial resolution of their transport models to match atmospheric observations and use spatial error correlations (usually Gaussian length scales) that tie the adjustment of fluxes from one grid cell to its neighbors at distances of hundreds to thousands of kilometers. Other inversions adjust fluxes over coarse regions that are larger than the resolution of their transport model, implicitly assuming a perfect correlation of fluxes within these regions (see TableÂ A4 of Friedlingstein et al., 2020, for CO2 inversions and TableÂ 4 of Saunois et al., 2020, for details). Thus, the results are shown for selected large-emitter countries or large absorbers in the case of CO2. We have selected a different set of countries or groups of countries for each gas. According to the median of inversion data we used in this study, our selected countries collectively represent â¼70â% of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions, â¼90â% of the global land CO2 sink, â¼60â% of anthropogenic CH4 emissions, and â¼55â% of anthropogenic N2O emissions. To more robustly interpret global inversion results for comparison with inventories, we chose high-emitting countries with areas that contain at least 13 grid boxes of the highest-resolution grid-scale inversions and that have (if possible) some coverage by atmospheric air-sample measurements, although some selected tropical countries have few or no atmospheric stations (Fig.Â S1). We seek to reconcile inversions with inventories with a clear framework to process inversion data in order to make them as comparable as possible with inventories. Uncertainties suggested by the spread of different inversion models (minâmax range given the small number of inversions) and the causes for discrepancies with inventories are analyzed systematically and on a case-by-case basis, for annual variations and for mean budgets over several years. We specifically address the following questions: (1)Â how do inversion models compare with NGHGIs for the three gases? (2)Â What are plausible reasons for mismatches between inversions and NGHGIs? (3)Â What independent information can be extracted from inversions to evaluate the mean values or the trends of greenhouse gas emissions and removals? (4)Â Can inversions be used to constrain national CH4 emissions and separate trends for natural versus anthropogenic sources, and into fossil fuels and agricultural plus waste anthropogenic sources? And (5)Â can inversions help constrain the importance of emissions and removals for unmanaged lands (not reported by inventories and yet important for linking emissions and removals to the concentration and radiative forcing changes) of the three main greenhouse gases?\n\nThe paper presents a new global database of national emissions reports for all countries and its grouping into sectors, the global atmospheric inversions used for the study, the processing of fluxes from these inversions to make their results as comparable as possible with inventories (Sect.Â 2), and the time series of inversions compared with inventories for each gas, with insights into key sectors for CH4 (Sects.Â 3â5). The discussion (Sect.Â 6) focuses on the comparison of terrestrial CO2 fluxes with fossil and cement emissions, the different sources of uncertainties for CH4 inversions, the comparison of inversions with CH4 and N2O inventories for mean budgets in the most recent 5Â years, and the comparison of global inversion results from this study with published regional inversions. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn on how inversions could be used in a systematic manner to support the evaluation and possible improvement of inventories for the Paris Agreement.\n\nFirst, we compared the global land use CO2 flux from inversions with NGHGIs. While data for the specific countries analyzed in this paper (Fig.Â 3) are based on our own compilation, the global land use flux from NGHGIs is from Grassi et al.Â (2021) (based on a compilation of different country submissions to the UNFCCC, in a few cases gap-filled with country reports to FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) 2015). For the period 2007â2017, our inversions give an average global land sink of 1.4âGtâCâyrâ1 over all lands and of 1.3âGtâCâyrâ1 over managed lands. Over managed lands, the CAMS, UoE, and Jena models have a higher sink; CTE2020 and NISMON give similar values; and MIROC gives a smaller sink than over all lands (see TableÂ S1 for the list of models). For a similar period (2010 and 2015) the NGHGI data compiled by Grassi et al.Â (2021) indicate a global land sink of only 0.3âGtâCâyrâ1, which is much smaller than that of inversions. Such a large difference can be possibly explained by the fact that (i)Â NGHGIs are incomplete, especially in developing countries, especially for soil carbon stock change in grasslands, croplands, wetlands, and forests (where actual observation-based estimates are often lacking) and (ii)Â in some cases, NGHGIs do not fully capture recent environmental effects (e.g.,Â CO2 fertilization). Inversions are also smaller than the TierÂ 1 approach published by Harris et al.Â (2021), who estimate a sink of 2.1âGtâCâyrâ1 over the last 20Â years over managed and unmanaged forests, with a large range of Â±13âGtâC that seems biophysically implausible.\n\nDownload\n\nFigureÂ 3 displays the time series of land-to-atmosphere CO2 fluxes for the selected countries (TableÂ 2). Across the 12 countries, the median of inversions shows significant interannual variability, generally consistent between the six inversions (Fig.Â S3). This signal reflects the impact of climate variability on terrestrial carbon fluxes and of annual variations in land use emissions. In the inversion of CO2 fluxes, the effects of climate variability on an interannual and decadal scale, rising CO2, nitrogen availability, and other environmental drivers are not separable from the direct human-induced effects of land use and management. Decadal variability in carbon stocks induced by climate and environmental drivers is mostly captured by the NGHGIs of countries that use regular forest inventories to measure stock changes over time (stock-difference method), e.g.,Â with dense sampling of forest plots. Yet, such gridded stock change inventories do not capture interannual variability, for instance, when higher mortality or a growth deficit occurs in a severe drought year and causes an abnormal CO2 source to the atmosphere (Ciais et al., 2005; Wolf et al., 2016; Bastos et al., 2020). In contrast, the NGHGIs of countries based on forestry models using static growth curves of representative forests do not necessarily capture the recent transient impact of environmental driver changes; see TableÂ 1 in the Supplement of Grassi et al.Â (2021), which includes information on the method (gainâloss or stock difference) used by several major countries. This may partially explain why inversions estimate higher CO2 sinks (e.g.,Â in CAN, AUS, and some EUR countries).\n\nIn large fossil CO2 emitter countries of temperate latitudes, inversions and NGHGI estimates are quite similar in China (CHN) and the USA but give a higher CO2 uptake in the EU27 and UK (EUR), Russia (RUS), and Canada (CAN) (Fig.Â 3). In these five countries/group of countries, adjusting inversions by CO2 fluxes induced by river carbon transport and by the trade of crop and wood products tends to lower CO2 sinks, especially for large crop exporters like the USA and CAN. But it still leaves a median CO2 uptake after adjustment (of 243âTgâCâyrâ1 in CHN, 243âTgâCâyrâ1 in the USA, 189âTgâCâyrâ1 in EUR, 325âTgâCâyrâ1 in RUS, and 217âTgâCâyrâ1 in CAN during 2000â2019) which is still higher than in NGHGI reports (Fig.Â 3). The differences between NGHGIs and inversions differ between countries however.\n\nIn CHN, the successive national communication estimates in five different years fall in the range of the six inversions and give a trend towards an increasing carbon sink. Adjusted inversions provide a median CO2 sink of 142âTgâCâyrâ1 in 2005 and of 245âTgâCâyrâ1 during 2010â2014, consistent with reported values from NGHGI reports (166âTgâCâyrâ1 in 2005 and an average of 247âTgâCâyrâ1 in 2010, 2012, and 2014). Note that the NGHGIs in 2010 and 2014 reported in China's NC3 and BUR2 used the IPCC 2006 guidelines to calculate the flux from the LULUCF sector, which includes fluxes from six land use types (forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, and other land). However, the LULUCF sector in the previous 3Â years reported in NC1, NC2, and BUR1 only considered fluxes from forest land.\n\nIn the USA, the carbon stock change estimates of the NGHGIs fall within the range of inversions during the last 3Â decades, with a mean value of 221âTgâCâyrâ1 from NGHGIs during 2000â2019 compared to an average of 243âTgâCâyrâ1 by inversions (going from a sink of 943âTgâCâyrâ1 to a source of 286âTgâCâyrâ1). Yet, the USA inventory gives a small decrease in carbon sinks with time, whereas the median of adjusted inversions produces a decrease in the net CO2 uptake, from an average of 287âTgâCâyrâ1 in the 2000s to 200âTgâCâyrâ1 in the 2010s, dropping by nearly 30â% during the last 30Â years despite the uncertainty suggested by the range of inversion model results. Estimates from NGHGIs also show a decreasing trend but with less fluctuation, from a mean value of 239, 222, and 219âTgâCâyrâ1 in the 1990s, 2020s, and 2010s, respectively. In EUR, inversions systematically indicate a larger net CO2 uptake than NGHGIs, by on average 104âTgâCâyrâ1 more than NGHGIs yet with a non-significant trend (MannâKendall test p=0.7), consistent with stable land carbon storage shown by NGHGIs.\n\nIn the two largest boreal and Arctic countries Canada (CAN) and Russia (RUS), inversions produce a CO2 sink (average 217 and 325âTgâCâyrâ1) which is systematically larger than that of the NGHGIs (2 and 171âTgâCâyrâ1, respectively) during 2000â2019. CAN is one of the few countries that does not capture most of the recent indirect environmental change effects (Grassi et al., 2021). The larger Russian sink of inversions is similar to the results of a recent analysis (Schepaschenko et al., 2021) of forest inventory and satellite biomass data estimating a carbon accumulation of 343âTgâCâyrâ1 from 1988 to 2014. The Russian carbon sink rate of increase is 6.0âTgâCâyrâ2 in the NGHGIs during the 2000s, smaller than the increasing CO2 sink rate of 16.4âTgâCâyrâ2 across inversions. When inversions include all lands in these two countries instead of managed land only, the net land CO2 sink becomes 40â% larger in CAN and 16â% larger in RUS. Unmanaged lands in our intact forest dataset cover 30â% of CAN and 15â% of RUS total forest area and are associated with CO2 sink densities of 44 and 29âgâCâmâ2âyrâ1, respectively, nearly identical to 46 and 30âgâCâmâ2âyrâ1 in managed lands. It should be noted that in Canada's CRF, removals by forest land are largely diminished by the emissions from harvested wood products in the LULUCF sector.\n\nAmong the selected large forested tropical countries, Brazil (BRA) is one of the few non-AnnexÂ I countries that has provided continuous time series of NGHGIs since 1990. The Brazilian NGHGIs show a net loss of carbon stocks from 1990 to 2020, with an increasing loss from 1990 to 2005 followed by a decrease afterwards. This change is explained mostly by deforestation rates (tree cover loss), which declined by a quarter between 2001â2005 (3.4âMhaâyrâ1) and 2006â2016 (2.7âMhaâyrâ1) (Global Forest Watch, 2021) or from 5.1âMhaâyrâ1 in 2000â2010 to 1.7âMhaâyrâ1 in 2015â2020, following government policies to protect forests, which were enforced until 2019. The latest year of reported inventory was 2016 in BRA, but satellite estimates of deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon from the Program to Calculate Deforestation in the Amazon (PRODES) system of the Brazilian Space Agency indicated a sharp increase in deforestation in 2019 (1âMha). On top of deforestation, degradation and fires also cause a loss of carbon in BRA and other Amazon countries, such as Peru (18âTgâCâyrâ1 during 2000â2019) and Colombia (25âTgâCâyrâ1 during 2000â2019). The area of degraded forests has been reduced in BRA, tailing off with the reduction trend of deforestation until 2019 (Bullock et al., 2020; Matricardi et al., 2020), even though the components of degradation from burned and logged forests, two processes causing the largest loss of carbon per unit area, have remained constant over time. The number of active fires in BRA seems to have remained constant, with peaks during dry years. The CO2 emissions from fires may be larger and decoupled from decreasing CO2 losses from decreasing deforestation (AragÃ£o et al., 2018). Drought generally causes abnormal CO2 losses in the Brazilian Amazon, of 0.48âGtâCâyrâ1 during the 2010 drought, based on a regional inversion with aircraft CO2 vertical profiles (Gatti et al., 2014), and of 0.25âGtâCâyrâ1 during the extreme El NiÃ±o drought of 2015, from aboveground biomass loss estimated by satellite vegetation optical depth changes (Qin et al., 2021). The land fluxes of inversions indicate that Brazilian managed land became abnormal sources in the dry years 2005 (540âTgâCâyrâ1), 2007 (334âTgâCâyrâ1), 2010 (195âTgâCâyrâ1), and 2015 (511âTgâCâyrâ1), with a sudden net increase compared to the previous year (240âTgâC in 2004, 180âTgâC in 2006, 132âTgâC in 2009, and 232âTgâC in 2015). Over the period 2010â2019, the aboveground net mean CO2 flux of the Brazilian Amazon area was estimated to be a weak source of 0.06âGtâCâyrâ1 (Qin et al., 2021), also consistent with data from the inversion of Palmer et al.Â (2019) (see their TableÂ 1). The median land CO2 flux of inversions in this study over the same period shows a source of 0.25âGtâCâyrâ1, comparable in magnitude but with a large spread (from a small sink of 96âTgâCâyrâ1 to a source of 510âTgâCâyrâ1). Recently, a top-down estimate based on 2010â2018 aircraft profiling of CO2 mole fractions (Gatti et al., 2021) suggested a substantial source of carbon in the eastern Amazon forest basin driven by fire emissions and loss of forest carbon uptake in dry seasons. The western part of the basin was nearly neutral in NEE, with deforestation fires and climate warming/drying playing a much smaller role. We also acknowledge that the estimate by Qin et al.Â (2021) gives only the carbon change in aboveground biomass, which is not strictly comparable to inversion results, the latter including soil and inland water CO2 fluxes and legacy CO2 emissions following mortality from the decomposition of coarse woody debris (Yang et al., 2021). Note also the importance of lateral carbon fluxes from the export of agricultural commodities in Brazil as a driver of deforestation (Follador et al., 2021; Weisse and Goldman, 2021). As for the other selected large forested tropical country, the Democratic Republic of Congo (COD), NGHGIs show a net sink of 19âTgâCâyrâ1 from 2000 to 2010 with a smaller interannual variability than in BRA despite a similar forested area. Interestingly, NGHGIs in COD show a decreasing CO2 sink from 1994 to 2010, while inversions give an increasing CO2 sink from the 1990s to the period around 2010, followed by a reversal after 2010. During the last decade, years after 2015 were net CO2 sources to the atmosphere for COD. It should be acknowledged that the NGHGIs of COD are extremely uncertain (and contradictory information, i.e., high removals, has been provided by the country in different official documents sent to the UNFCCC and to FAO).\n\nFor India (IND), although the land CO2 sinks show an increased uptake across inversions during the first half of the 2000s with an annual uptake of 14âTgâCâyrâ1 during this period, the CO2 uptake from the inversions fluctuated between positive and negative values in the 1990s and 2010s, indicating that the role of land CO2 flux shifted between a net carbon sink and a net carbon source (Takaya et al., 2021). This shift to a net CO2 source could be explained by a decreased Indian monsoon after â¼2007 (University of Hawaii Indian Summer Monsoon Index, http://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/monsoon/seasonal-monidx.html, last access: 5Â JulyÂ 2021). For the two continental Asian countries, Mongolia (MNG) and Kazakhstan (KAZ), the land CO2 flux fluctuates around zero with a small interannual variation, indicating a stable trend of land flux changes and a small contribution to the uptake of all Northern Hemisphere AnnexÂ I countries.\n\nFor Australia (AUS), there is a clear CO2 sink anomaly during the extremely wet La NiÃ±a event from MayÂ 2010 to MarchÂ 2012 (Poulter et al., 2014; Haverd et al., 2016). In the following fire season of late 2012 and early 2013, more fires were reported from the legacy of a higher fuel load in the previous wet period, and these CO2 emissions likely caused the net CO2 uptake to decrease (Harris and Lucas, 2019).\n\nFor maritime Southeast Asian countries, that is, Indonesia (IDN), Malaysia (MYS), and Papua New Guinea (PGN) grouped together (Fig.Â S4), we found a large peak of CO2 emissions during the El NiÃ±o of 1998 corresponding to extreme fire emissions from peat burning (Page et al., 2002). This group of countries shows a net sink of 60âTgâCâyrâ1 of CO2 since 2000. For continental Southeast Asian countries, that is, Thailand (THA), Myanmar (MMR), Laos (LAO), Cambodia (KHM), and Viet Nam (VMN) grouped together, we found on average that inversions give a similar net CO2 flux to that reported by NGHGIs. In this group of countries, inversions give a decreasing sink trend in the last decade (Fig.Â S4), consistent with the observation of increased forest clearing and biomass carbon losses, in particular over mountain regions (Davis et al., 2015; Zeng et al., 2018).\n\nDownload\n\nIn this section, we further analyze comparison between NGHGIs and inversions for the three gases. First, we compare the land CO2 flux to fossil fuel emissions and their respective trends. Then we discuss the uncertainty arising from the separation between anthropogenic and natural CH4 emissions in inversions by comparing the results of different separation methods, and we analyze how inversions resolve fossil versus agricultural emission budgets in each country. The contribution of CH4 emissions from ultra-emitters in the fossil fuel sector, which is not counted in inventories but could explain why inversions diagnose higher emissions than inventories in many oil- and gas-extracting countries, is further analyzed using independent estimates. Then, we analyze the separation of natural from anthropogenic sources in national N2O budgets from inversions, a topic which has not been addressed in previous studies. Finally, we compare the results of our global inversions with regional inversions based on higher-resolution transport models or assimilating regional data for China (CHN), the EU27 and UK (EUR), the USA, and Brazil (BRA).\n\nDownload\n\n6.1âLand CO2 fluxes compared to fossil fuel emissions\n\nFigureÂ 8 presents fossil fuel and cement emissions, the net land CO2 flux, and the net flux from the sum of the land flux and fossil emissions. Fossil CO2 emissions are obtained by re-aggregating to national totals the emission maps provided by each modeling group. These emissions are not optimized by inversions and may differ from UNFCCC NGHGIs because most non-AnnexÂ I countries do not have annual emission estimates and because inversions use as fixed priors gap-filled annual data from CDIAC and BP statistics for non-AnnexÂ I countries (Friedlingstein et al., 2020), whereas the red circles in Fig.Â 8 show the average of emissions from available BUR or NC reports in each period (thus, for each period only data of available years of national inventories are used to calculate the average). For AnnexÂ I countries, the prior fossil CO2 emission maps prescribed to the inversions from Jones et al.Â (2021) match by construction national totals from the UNFCCC. For non-AnnexÂ I countries, the prior fossil CO2 emission map is based mainly on CDIAC national emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). The data presented in Fig.Â 8 show differences between NGHGI data and inversion priors, possibly due to (1)Â international bunker fuel emissions from ships and aviation counted in inversions as surface emissions but not included in UNFCCC national registers, (2)Â interpolation or regridding by inversion modelers of gridded fossil fuel emissions, or (3)Â our aggregation processing of national emissions from coarse-resolution inversions back to national totals (see Sect.Â 2.3). Residual differences have been corrected when presenting in Fig.Â 8 the land sink to match the emissions of Friedlingstein et al.Â (2020), but these inconsistencies of emissions between inventories and what is prescribed as prior fossil emissions in inversions should be kept in mind for future studies.\n\nThere is a striking consistency in Fig.Â 8 between means for each 6â7-year period of NGHGI land carbon sinks and inversions, after the adjustments presented in Sect.Â 2, for all major emitters. Although the range of inversions is large compared to the small uncertainties reported by NGHGI reports, the median value of inversions is within 37â% of NGHGIs for China (CHN), the USA, India (IND), and Brazil (BRA). Inversions give a larger sink compared to NGHGI data for several countries, however, such as Russia (RUS, by 85â%), the EU27 and UK (EUR, by 113â%), Australia (AUS, by >600â%), and Canada (CAN, >10â000â%). On the one hand, NGHGIs could potentially report lower estimation of carbon sinks in their managed lands due to incomplete estimation of environmental factors (e.g.,Â CO2 fertilization effect) and incomplete reporting, especially for the soil pool (many of them assume that, e.g.,Â mineral grassland soils are neutral, whereas this is probably not the case); however, the larger sink from inversions may also stem from prescribing bunker fuel aircraft emissions at the surface in the atmospheric transport models, which may imply a larger compensatory land CO2 sink. For CHN, given the large amount of fossil emissions, there is an aliasing effect between the choice of a prior emission estimate and the magnitude of the inferred national land sink (Saeki and Patra, 2017). For CAN and AUS, our proxy for unmanaged lands may explain systematically lower sink estimates in inventories compared to inversions. It should also be noted that Canada uses relatively old growth functions that do not capture much of the recent transient impact of environmental changes such as rising CO2 and longer growing seasons. AUS considers all forest as formally âmanagedâ, but the vast majority (100âMha of âother native forestâ) is assumed to be in carbon equilibrium in the AUS NGHGIs. Thus with this assumption there is no biomass loss because the wood removal is zero, whereas old-growth forest may comprise carbon sinks.\n\nIn this study, we applied a mask of unmanaged forests to inversion gridded CO2 fluxes, which has mainly the effect of reducing CO2 uptake over the countries that have a large fraction of unmanaged forests, namely by 14â% in RUS, 30â% in CAN, 16â% in BRA, and 16â% in COD. BRA is a specific case because although large fractions of the Brazilian Amazon forest are slightly disturbed by âmanagementâ activities, it contains a significant fraction of protected areas and indigenous territories (23â% of the total forest area in BRA) (Alejo et al., 2021; IWGIA, 2021) which are counted as managed land by a political decision on land use. Thus, there is a large mismatch between nationally reported areas of unmanaged land (316âMha in 2010 according to TableÂ 3.109 from MCTI, 2016) and the intact forest mask that we used (166âMha in 2010, â¼33â% of the national forest cover). According to TableÂ 3 in the Supplement of Grassi et al.Â (2021), the share of total forest comprising intact forest was around 40â% in CAN and BRA and 20â% in RUS. This share depends on the threshold used to define forest, but in BRA, our intact forest area (16â%) used to exclude the inversion fluxes from unmanaged land seems to be too small. In comparison, the land carbon removals from NGHGIs are compiled based on the national communication reports of Brazil that say for instance that about half of Brazil's forest is unmanaged. We also note that we did nothing to mask unmanaged grasslands and rangelands for CO2 fluxes, even though these systems are thought to be larger CO2 sinks per unit area than managed grasslands (Chang et al., 2021a). In the future, it should be possible to mask inversions using the area simulated as managed grasslands by Chang et al.Â (2021a), that is, 1650âMha or a fraction of 33â% of the global grassland area from their study. The masking of inversions' fluxes over unmanaged forests in the USA, CHN, and EUR has a negligible impact on the net land CO2 flux from inversions given their small/negligible share of forest being declared as unmanaged.\n\nRegarding the effect of CO2 fluxes caused by lateral processes, which do not result in national carbon stock changes, the correction that we applied to inversions (Sect.Â 2) is equivalent to reproducing the rules of accounting by countries, where wood products harvested (also biofuels) are considered to be emitted where they have been produced, even though these products can be exported and CO2 emitted elsewhere. On the other hand, domestically produced and consumed wood, which comprises the majority of wood use in most countries, will induce subnational patterns of CO2 sources and sinks, assumed to be captured by inversions and not considered explicitly here as an inversion adjustment. To our knowledge, no country is accounting for carbon in traded crop products (as it is not a stock change) or for carbon transferred from soils to rivers and outgassed, buried in aquatic sediments, or transferred to the ocean. In inventories, observed soil carbon stock changes should implicitly include carbon leached or eroded from soils. However, since very few inventories are based on actual soil carbon change estimates but rather use assumptions or models that ignore the river loop of the carbon cycle, it is possible that the amount of carbon remaining in soils is overestimated by these approaches (Lauerwald et al., 2020). We found that altogether, the correction of inversions by CO2 fluxes induced by the lateral transport from river, crop, and wood products goes from a net source of 19âTgâCâyrâ1 in Sudan (mainly crop import) to a net sink of 169âTgâCâyrâ1 in Brazil (mainly lateral export). The river correction always makes the inversion net land CO2 flux a smaller sink, whereas the trade of crop and wood can be a net CO2 source or a sink, depending on the balance of exports and imports. We found that these trade fluxes are a source of CO2 in the net-importing countries China, the EU27 and UK, and Japan and a CO2 sink in wood- and food-exporting countries like the USA, Brazil, and Argentina. We outline the fact that most of the carbon lost by soils to rivers in a country is outgassed in territorial waters (see Sect.Â 2.3). Inversion results should partly include this source, although without prescribing it in an explicit manner (e.g.,Â in their prior), but part of this CO2 source could also be misallocated to other countries in the flux increment of inversions. The same remark holds true for CO2 fluxes induced by crop and wood product growth, harvest, and trade. Although there is uncertainty about the share of unmanaged land as well as the lateral fluxes, we still make our efforts to narrow the gap between NGHGIs and inversions by excluding flues in unmanaged land and adjusting lateral fluxes from inversions. However, more profound and systematic analysis and comparisons are called for to harmonize the different scopes between national inventory compilations and inverse models.\n\nDownload\n\n6.2âUncertainties due to the separation of natural from anthropogenic CH4 emissions\n\nUncertainty in anthropogenic CH4 emissions using the inversion method is suggested not only by the spread between models (due to transport models and other inversion specific settings) but also by the method chosen to separate anthropogenic from natural emissions. The data shown in Fig.Â 9 compare the results of the four different separation methods presented in Sect.Â 2. They show that the uncertainty due to the separation method is generally much smaller than the spread between different models, derived from the fact that inversion vertical ranges appear large relative to differences due to the separation procedure. In China (CHN), the between-method range of median inversion estimates of anthropogenic emissions is 4âTgâCH4âyrâ1, compared to the mean model spread (interquartile) of 46â60âTgâCH4âyrâ1. The range between the median of different methods is 10âTgâCH4 for the USA, 6âTgâCH4 for the EU27 and UK (EUR), and 3âTgâCH4 for Russia (RUS). In Brazil (BRA), methodsÂ 3/1 and 3/2 based on ecosystem models of wetland emissions to diagnose natural emissions give much larger anthropogenic emissions. This is likely because these models report lower natural emissions (Sawakuchi et al., 2014); e.g.,Â they do not have emissions from flooded forests (Pangala et al., 2017), from the open river itself, or from palm swamps and peat complexes (Winton et al., 2017), which comprise an important CH4 source in BRA (Melack et al., 2004). MethodÂ 1, which is based on the original separation of natural vs. anthropogenic emissions from inversions, is not systematically different from other methods, but its results differ markedly due to its different use of data sources in each natural/anthropogenic part (see Sect.Â 2.4). MethodÂ 1 gives slightly higher anthropogenic emissions than other methods by 4âTgâCH4âyrâ1 on average for EUR and by 3âTgâCH4âyrâ1 for the USA and a smaller value than other methods by 1âTgâCH4âyrâ1 for RUS. The positive difference between methodÂ 1, chosen for this study, and other methods (Fig.Â S5) implies a better match of inversions with respect to NGHGIs for EUR than if other methods were used. For the USA, if we were using methodÂ 2, the anthropogenic CH4 emissions would be smaller by 2âTgâCH4âyrâ1, which would further accentuate lower estimations of inversion emissions compared to the NGHGIs, especially before 2010. For RUS, even if other methods were used to compare with NGHGIs, our result of a lower estimation of anthropogenic CH4 emissions by the NGHGI report remains valid. In CHN, our result that inversions produce systematically smaller anthropogenic CH4 emissions than NGHGI data is also robust to the choice of method.\n\n6.3âContributions from fossil fuel versus agriculture and waste sectors in CH4 emissions\n\nFigureÂ 10 compares the share of the different sectors for anthropogenic CH4 emissions across a selection of 12 top emitting countries (selected countries from top anthropogenic and top fossil CH4 emitters). Generally, inversions partition agricultural and waste emissions consistently with NGHGIs within the respective uncertainties in both approaches. Inversions provide, however, larger biomass burning emissions than reported by NGHGIs, partly because we assumed that all biomass burning and biofuel emissions were anthropogenic in inversion results, whereas countries report only fire emissions on managed lands and emissions of biofuel burning used for house heating and cooking. Inversions tend to produce higher CH4 emissions than NGHGIs for all major oil- and gas-emitting countries (except CHN), in particular the USA, Russia (RUS), and Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan (KAZ&TKM). This under-reporting (also discussed in Sect.Â 4.2) can be due to the fact that inventories and emission factors do not consider CH4 leaks from ultra-emitting events consisting of very large and sporadic emissions, like accidental leaks (Cusworth et al., 2018). Here, we used the first global quantitative estimate of ultra-emitters derived by Lauvaux et al.Â (2022) from S5P-TROPOMI measurements, namely all short-duration leaks from oil and gas facilities (e.g.,Â wells, compressors) with an individual emission >20âtâCH4âhâ1, with each event lasting generally less than 1âd. Using the event duration obtained by fitting a local dispersion model to observed S5P-TROPOMI methane plumes, all ultra-emitting events in each country were aggregated during the period from JanuaryÂ 2019 to DecemberÂ 2020 (TableÂ S3). Assuming that those large leaks are not reported by NGHGIs, they were added to NGHGI reports of fossil CH4 emissions as plain red stacked bars in Fig.Â 10. Doing so reduces the misfit with inversions, especially in RUS and KAZ&TKM. Ultra-emitters represent 85â% (1.4âTgâCH4âyrâ1) of NGHGI fossil emissions for KAZ&TKM, 14â% (0.9âTgâCH4âyrâ1) for RUS, and 2â% (0.03âTgâCH4âyrâ1) for the countries grouped in the GULF region. We also considered emissions derived from S5P-TROPOMI measurements at the scale of regional extraction basins for oil, gas, and coal. Four major oil and gas basins were considered (Fig.Â S7) as they are specific areas where many individual wells and storage facilities are concentrated, each of them with a probability of emitting CH4 and forming a clear regional enhancement of CH4 detected in S5P-TROPOMI and imaged and assimilated with a regional inversion into a regional CH4 emission budget (see TableÂ S3, Supplement, and Kayrros Methane Watch, https://www.kayrros.com/methane-watch/, last access: 30Â JulyÂ 2021). Such basin-scale emissions were diagnosed from regional inversions using S5P-TROPOMI atmospheric measurements. Here, we assumed that those basins are already counted as part of the national CH4 budgets from inÂ situ and GOSAT inversions. Thus, they are shown here for the share of total national fossil emissions that they represent in inversions (dark red bars, part of total fossil emissions in inversion results displayed in Fig.Â 10). In the USA, the Permian basin emissions represent between 21â% (inÂ situ, S) and 24â% (GOSAT, G) of the total national fossil CH4 estimates from inversions. Alone, the Permian basin contributed 16â% of the total gas and 35â% of the oil extracted in the USA in 2019 (EIA, 2021a). Our average 2019â2020 emission estimate in the Permian basin is 2.3âTgâCH4âyrâ1 from S5P-TROPOMI data, which is consistent with an estimate of 2.7âTgâCH4âyrâ1 from O&G industries in the Permian basin reported by Zhang et al.Â (2020) but contrasts with the 1.4âTgâCH4âyrâ1 emission estimate for the entire USA reported by EPA (2020). In the GULF, emissions from the basin comprising Iraq and Kuwait represent 32â% (S)â46â% (G) of the total estimated fossil emissions of this region. This basin estimation encompasses four of the highest-oil-producing fields in the world, and its oil production accounts for 31.5â% of all the countries in the GULF region (EIA, 2021a). The basin estimation from inversions for IRN (2.3âTgâCH4) represents 55.2â% (S)â71.0â% (G) of estimated fossil fuel emissions and 94.8â% of the national total NGHGI estimates.\n\n6.4âOverlooked importance of natural N2O emissions in non-AnnexÂ I countries\n\nAs shown in Sect.Â 5, the estimation of N2O emission fluxes by emission inventories is challenging, and currently some non-AnnexÂ I countries (e.g., COD) have no estimates available. FigureÂ 11 compares inversions (CAMS, GEOS-Chem, and INVICAT) to available NGHGI-reported N2O emission fluxes. Because emission sectors of NGHGIs and inversions are limited and do not coincide with each other, the comparison of N2O emission sectors between these two data sources can only be accomplished partially. The main innovation proposed in this study has been to separate total inversion fluxes into unmanaged and managed lands so that the emissions over managed lands minus the natural inland water emissions can be compared with inventories (Sect.Â 2). We can see in the data presented in Fig.Â 12 that natural emissions (natural fluxes from lakes and rivers plus fluxes from unmanaged lands) account for 32â% of the mean inversion total in BRA, 47â% in COD, and 57â% in AUS. In temperate industrialized countries with a smaller fraction of unmanaged land, the magnitude of natural fluxes relative to anthropogenic ones is smaller. In comparison to emissions from unmanaged lands, the natural emissions from rivers are always of a very small magnitude. In general, removing natural emissions tends to improve the agreement with inventories in non-AnnexÂ I countries. In AnnexÂ I countries, it tends to make inversion-based emissions smaller than those of NGHGIs. The main uncertainty is in the area of grasslands and forests assumed to be unmanaged from our masks and how well they correspond to the unmanaged areas used by each country. A large area of extensively grazed land, e.g., in Mongolia and Kazakhstan, is considered here natural, whereas those countries may consider them under management, even though the nitrogen cycle and N2O emissions are close to natural conditions for extensive grazing. The consistent pattern of higher emissions in inversions than NGHGIs among the three model inversions for non-AnnexÂ I countries suggests possible improvements in inventory compilation including adopting country-specific emission factors or re-assessing and reporting indirect emissions when this is not the case (TableÂ S2). On the other hand, for the USA and CHN, the median of inversion emissions is smaller than in inventories and CAMS is higher than the two other inversions considered. Concerning smaller inversion estimates for CHN and the USA compared to NGHGIs, this could be because the TierÂ 1 used by NGHGIs assumes static EFs, whereas EFs may change (become smaller or larger) depending on cropland nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and climate. The USA improved its NUE in the 1990s compared to the 1980s considerably (Lassaletta et al., 2014), but if the EFs used are based on flux measurements in the 1980s, these could be too high. A recent data-driven model of direct cropland N2O emissions (Q.Â Wang et al., 2020) using non-linear EF and regional N-fertilizer input data found emissions smaller than those found by TierÂ 1 methods, which would be in better agreement with inversions. Another source of uncertainty in the N2O inversions is the prior estimates for land versus ocean. Since the ocean is not well constrained in the inversions, having a too high ocean prior will mean the land total will be underestimated and vice versa.\n\n6.5âComparison with regional emissions\n\nTableÂ 3 compares the results of the global inversions used in this study with regional inversion results compiled from the literature, generally obtained with higher-resolution regional transport models and sometimes using atmospheric data not assimilated by global inversions. Global inversion results are given without and with adjustments for CO2 fluxes due to lateral transport and for anthropogenic emissions estimated using equation methodÂ 1 for CH4 and Eq.Â (6) for N2O (Sect.Â 2). The purpose of introducing a CO2 flux correction (Sect.Â 2.3) was to make an accurate comparison with inventories, but since regional CO2 inversions did not use such an adjustment, here we focus on comparing regional inversions with global ones without adjustment.\n\nFor CO2 fluxes in CHN, except for the large uptake found by the inversion (J.Â Wang et al., 2020), all previous regional inversion results fall within the range of our global inversion ensemble for their period of overlap, indicating no systematic bias of global inversions. Note that J.Â Wang et al.Â (2020) provide a global inversion using new Chinese stations data and a discretization of fluxes into smaller sub-regions within China. In BRA, the range of global inversions also covers regional inversion results yet with global inversions being a small CO2 source in 2010 (194âTgâCâyrâ1) and regional inversions a large source in that year. The regional inversions from Gatti et al.Â (2014) and Van der Laan-Luijkx et al.Â (2015) using aircraft CO2 and CO profiles in the Amazon also give a larger flux change between 2010 (a dry year, a CO2 source in the Amazon) and 2011 (a wet year, a CO2 sink in the Amazon) than global inversions that do not assimilate these aircraft data. For EUR, the range of regional inversions (Petrescu et al., 2021a) is similar to the one of global inversions. For North America, however, regional inversions give a higher average CO2 uptake than global ones, although within their range.\n\nFor CH4 emissions in CHN, the results of all regional inversions (Miller et al., 2019; Thompson et al., 2015) are consistent with our global inversion ensemble, although the inversion of Miller et al.Â (2019) is in the upper range. For BRA or the Amazon basin, interestingly, regional inversions (Tunnicliffe et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2016) provide systematically higher CH4 emissions than global inÂ situ inversion estimates, but regional inversions include wetlands and rivers, which can explain their higher values. If natural emissions were removed from regional inversions, then their values would be consistent with global results; i.e.,Â Tunnicliffe et al.Â (2020) estimated that CH4 emissions from BRA are 33.6Â±3.6âTgâCH4âyrâ1 with 19.0Â±2.6âTgâCH4âyrâ1 from anthropogenic sources, falling within the range of our estimates for anthropogenic emissions from global inversions (19â36âTgâCH4âyrâ1). In the EU and the USA or North America, the regional inversions in TableÂ 3 which have higher-resolution transport models give higher CH4 emissions than global inversions, even when only anthropogenic emissions are considered in regional inversions. This suggests that global models may systematically underestimate CH4 emissions from those two high emitters. For N2O, we have several regional inversions for North America, all producing higher emissions than the median of global inversions by a factor ofÂ 4, on average. The only regional N2O inversion over Europe is also about 2Â times higher than the median of global inversions.\n\nDownload XLSX\n\nThis study proposes a new toolbox to improve the consistency between inversions and UNFCCC NGHGIs for each of the three greenhouse gases. We post-processed inversion results to make them comparable with the rules of accounting of inventories. For CO2, we excluded the fluxes in unmanaged lands with an intact forest mask and estimated the fluxes associated with lateral transport (by river or by trade). For CH4, we proposed three methods to split the anthropogenic fluxes from inversions by aggregating prior estimates from each sector or by removing fluxes of natural processes. For N2O, we also separated the fluxes from managed land by using the same method on CO2 and accounting for the indirect N2O emissions. In the case of CO2, using a mask of managed lands is also critical for large forested countries (Grassi et al., 2021) and tends to make their âcarbon sinkâ smaller than when using inversion fluxes over all the grid cells. Here we made a first attempt to use an intact ânon-managedâ forest mask for this purpose. Such a mask could be extended to unmanaged grasslands in future studies, e.g., following recent work by Chang et al.Â (2021a). However, it should be noted that there are discrepancies between the intact forest landscape maps of Potapov et al.Â (2017) that we use and the unmanaged land defined in NGHGIs. For instance, an intact forest protected in a national park will be classified as managed in the corresponding NIR. Conversely, some areas of âunmanaged forestâ are outside of the intact forests defined by Potapov et al.Â (2017), e.g., northern open woodlands. Here, we recommend that countries should report their managed land in a spatially explicit manner to enable a better evaluation of national emissions reports using inversions (and other observation-based approaches), and countries should also follow the recommendations of the IPCC 2006 guidelines encouraging countries to use atmospheric data as an independent check on their national reports (IPCC, 2006, 2019) (see also the discussion in Chevallier, 2021). Removing from inversions the CO2 fluxes coupled to lateral transport, which represent no carbon stock change and are not all visible to inventories, generally makes the carbon sink significantly smaller in northern mid-latitude countries (e.g.,Â 26â% in CAN and 18â% lower in RUS) than if raw inversion data were used. All harvest is seen by NGHGIs as a loss of carbon stock in forest. Then, the wood that remains in the country enters the harvested wood products (HWP) pool (where gains and losses are recorded). What is âinvisibleâ in NGHGIs is the wood that enters the HWP pool of a foreign country. CH4 and N2O emissions have been even less explored for a systematic comparison of inversions with inventories. For these two gas species, we improved the processing of inversion gridded fluxes to separate anthropogenic fluxes from the total emissions in order to provide estimates that can be compared with NGHGIs for policy implementation. For CH4, we proposed three methods to remove the signal of natural CH4 emissions and found that their robustness is country dependent, the separation of natural emissions to retrieve anthropogenic emissions being more difficult in countries that have both large natural and anthropogenic emissions and few atmospheric stations, like RUS or BRA. We certainly recommend here to reduce the uncertainty in prior estimates and improve estimations of natural sources using, e.g.,Â better bottom-up datasets of wetland area, rivers, and lakes and their CH4 emissions rates in order to make further in-depth comparisons between these methods. For CH4, a second notable result is that despite the large spread of inversions, both inÂ situ and GOSAT inversions show valid differences from NGHGI anthropogenic emissions. We also found that Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan in central Asia and the Gulf countries in the Middle East, characterized by oil- and gas-producing industries, report much lower CH4 emissions than atmospheric inversions. It is fair to say that in this region, there are few ground stations, and inversions could depend on their prior fluxes, but the fact that GOSAT and inÂ situ data point to NGHGI emissions being underestimated suggests areas for future research to constrain the emissions of these countries. We recommend here developing regional campaigns (such as those performed in Alvarez et al., 2018) to refine emission factors and to track regional oil, gas, and coal basin emissions and ultra-emitter site level emissions using new tools (such as moderate- and high-resolution satellite imagery). For N2O, the prevalence of large tropical natural sources, being outside the responsibility of countries if they are located on unmanaged lands, has been overlooked before. For example, nearly half of the forests in Brazil are unmanaged according to its national inventory report. We did not solve this problem but highlighted it and proposed a new method to remove natural emissions from inversion total emissions. As many non-AnnexÂ I countries which will have to produce inventories for the global stocktake are tropical countries with a very active nitrogen cycle and large natural N2O emissions, a decoupling will exist between targeted emissions reductions and the observed growth rate of N2O; it may hamper the eventual effectiveness of mitigation policies that are directly reflected in the UNFCCC NGHGI reports, especially for this greenhouse gas.\n\nIt is fair to say that the uncertainty from inversions from the spread of different models is generally large, so inversions cannot âfalsifyâ NGHGIs in most instances. Nevertheless, for CH4 in countries around the Persian Gulf and central Asia and to some extent in Russia and for N2O in tropical countries, Mexico, and Australia, we found that NGHGI emissions are significantly lower than inversions, which suggests that activity data or emission factors may need to be re-evaluated. Despite their large spread, inversions have the advantage of providing fluxes that are consistent with the accurately observed growth rates of each greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The uncertainty in inversions is mainly a systematic bias due to internal settings or to the choice of a transport model. It does not mean that inversions cannot be used for monitoring interannual variability and trends of fluxes, in response to mitigation efforts, since most of their bias should have a small temporal component.\n\nThe study of global inversions at the country scale rather than at the traditional subcontinent scale (e.g., the âTransComÂ 3 regionsâ of Gurney et al., 2002) obviously pushes inversions close to the limit of their domain of validity, even in the case of large countries. The densification of observation networks and systems, especially from space, increases the observational information available at all spatial scales and gradually makes it possible to study smaller countries. This densification must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the horizontal resolution of inversion systems (both the transport model and the control vector to be optimized). Note that the spatial resolution of most inverse models such as those contributing to the global carbonâmethaneânitrous oxide budget is larger than 1â (see TableÂ A4 in Friedlingstein et al., 2020; TableÂ S6 in Saunois et al., 2020; and TableÂ 18 in the Supplement of Tian et al., 2020). They will likely soon have to go below 1â on a global scale to remain competitive for this type of study, despite the high computational challenge posed by the atmospheric inversion of long-lived tracers.\n\nAlden, C.
