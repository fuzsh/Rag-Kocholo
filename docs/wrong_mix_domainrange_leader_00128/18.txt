Smith, John. A True Relation of Such Occurrences of Noate as Hath Happened in Virginia. London, 1608. B3-C3, E3-E4. (Ed. Charles Deane. Boston, 1866. 24-40, 72-73. See esp. footnote 3, pp. 38-40, for comments on the discrepancy in Smith's accounts of his captivity.) (Travels and Works of Captain John Smith. Ed. Edward Arber, with Biographical and Critical Introduction by A. G. Bradley. Vol. 1. Edinburgh, 1910. 14-21, 38-39.) (Philip L. Barbour, The Jamestown Voyages under the First Charter, 1606-1609. 2 vols. Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1969.) (The Complete Works of John Smith. Ed. Philip L. Barbour. Vol. 1. Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina P, 1986. 43-59, 93-95.) Written by Smith in Virginia, this document contains the first appearance of Pocahontas in the historical record but no mention of the rescue. Powhatan treats the captive Smith with "kindness," and he is sent back to Jamestown without incident. Pocahontas, "a child of tenne yeares old . . . the only Nonpareil of [Powhatan's] Country," is introduced later as part of a diplomatic mission regarding Indian prisoners.

Wingfield, Edward Maria. "A Discourse of Virginia." 1608. Ed. Charles Deane. Archaeologica Americana: Transactions and Collections of the American Antiquarian Society 4 (1860): 67-103. Esp. 92 (entry for December 10, 1607) and footnote 8, 92-95, on the omission of the rescue account. (Philip L. Barbour, The Jamestown Voyages under the First Charter, 1606-1609. 2 vols. Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1969. 213-34.) This account by the first president of the Virginia council mentions Smith's captivity and freedom but not the Pocahontas rescue episode -- another piece of evidence for those who question Smith's veracity. Editor Deane, for instance, determines the rescue an "embellishment" that never happened.

The story of John Ortiz, of the Narvaez expedition, rescued by the daughter of the chief, an Indian princess [Hirrihigua], who argued "that one only Christian could do him neither hurt nor good, telling [her father] that it was more for his honour to keepe him as a captive" -- cited by some skeptics as a possible source for Smith's Pocahontas episode.

Strachey's A true reportory, his account of the shipwreck he survived on the way to Virginia in 1609 (Strachey was in the colony from 1610-1611 and became Secretary), is thought to be a source for Shakespeare's The Tempest. Here in his history of Virginia (not published until Major's edition) he memorably describes Pocahontas as an 11-12 year-old cartwheeling "little wanton," now married to Kocoum, whose right name was Amonute -- but there is no mention of connection with Smith, who had left Virginia by this time.

This is a companion to Smith's A Map of Virginia (it's often called Part II or an appendix), and they may have been published together (though they have separate title pages). Proceedings is a collection of narratives by colonists compiled by Symonds, an English minister who wrote an important justification document for the Virginia Company, and describes Smith's captivity for a third time without the rescue by Pocahontas: instead, Smith "procured his owne liberty." But this work does mention that Powhatan sends Pocahontas to seek freedom for Indian prisoners (which Smith grants for her "sake only"), and there is refutation of the claim that Smith would make himself king by marrying Pocahontas. Smith drew heavily on the Proceedings for his 1624 Generall Historie, where he connects Pocahontas with several of the episodes mentioned in this earlier work.

Purchas, a friend of Smith's and successor to the great Richard Hakluyt as England's premier collector and editor of travel narratives, apparently uses a manuscript of Symonds' 1612 Proceedings here as his source. His account of Virginia and the pertinent Pocahontas episodes grows over the subsequent editions of his work. In this first version there is only mention that "They carryed [Smith] prisoner to Powhatan, and there beganne the English acquaintance with the savage Emperour" -- the fourth published account without mention of a rescue by Pocahontas. The "womens entertainment" or "Virginia Maske" episode is also mentioned, but without reference to Pocahontas.

Enhanced account of Virginia in this second edition probably using the published Symonds' 1612 Proceedings as his source. There's more detail about Smith's captivity but still without reference to Pocahontas, for he procures his own liberty: "Smith, with two others, were beset by 200 savages his men slain, & himselfe in a quagmire taken prisoner; but after a moneth he procured himselfe not onely libertie, but great admiration amongst them, and returning, once more stayed the Pinace from flight." Pocahontas's abduction -- just lately happened -- is noted: "they took Pocahuntis (Powhatans deerest daughter) prisoner, and for her ransome had Corne, and redeliverie of their prisoners and weapons."

In his 1624 history Smith claims (there seems to be no other corroboration) to have sent this "little booke" to the Queen on Pocahontas's 1616 arrival in England. In it, we learn that Pocahontas (now described as "a child of twelve or thirteen years of age" when he knew her) not only rescued Smith more than once but was instrumental in saving the entire colony from starvation. If this letter is genuine, it contains the first description of "the" rescue, though there is no indication it was publicly known in 1616.

"They tooke Pocahuntis (Powhatans dearest daughter) prisoner, a matter of good consequence to them, of best to her, by this meanes being come a Christian, & married to Master Rolfe, an English Gentleman." The Indians concealed her real name of Matokes "in a superstitious feare of hurt by the English if her name were knowne."

Though conversion of a "poore, wretched and mysbeleiving people" was the climactic thrust of his justification of the colony, there is no mention of Pocahontas.

Perhaps to establish his credentials for command, Smith responds to the 1622 massacre of colonists in Jamestown with a vigorous assertion of his proven ability to handle the Indians, and he affirms Pocahontas as "the meanes to deliuer me [and who] thereby taught me to know their trecheries to preserue the rest." This slim sentence (in the 1622 edition but not in the 1620) seems to be the first verifiably public reference by Smith to the fabled rescue from captivity.

This, of course, is the source of the widest range of information about Pocahontas, and the source of the full description of Smith's captivity and subsequent rescue by her. In addition, references to Pocahontas include: her name in an Indian language example (the one listed above from Smith's Map), supplying food to stave off starvation, reviving spirits with her love, making amends for injuries, negotiating for prisoners, entertaining Smith with the "maske," traveling through the "irksome woods" to save Smith from a murder plot, saving Richard Wyffin and Henry Spilman, falling captive herself, marrying Rolfe, visiting England, reunion with Smith, and death.

The first image of the rescue here in the book that, as we have seen, contains the first full description of it, if not the first public mention. This first depiction of the rescue, say Rasmussen and Tilton, with elements based on earlier representations of Virginia Indians, is not itself totally original, and, in turn, it stands at the head of a long line of such images, as the image gallery in the archive attests.

In his fourth and final work on Virginia (see 1613, 1614, 1617), Purchas now uses Smith's Generall Historie to describe the rescue by Pocahontas (p. 1709). Though he includes the 1614 letters by Dale and Whitaker, he only cites three other mentions of Pocahontas from Smith: her diplomatic mission, her "darke night" rescue of Smith, and her rescue of Henry Spilman. Most importantly, Purchas also reports from personal experience that in London Pocahontas "carried her selfe as the Daughter of a King" and, in his presence, was accorded respect by the Bishop of London (p. 1774). Smith's verbatim reference to Pocahontas from the 1622 New Englands trials (p. 1841) is here as well.

There is no mention of Pocahontas, and there is a skeptical view of Smith's credibility: "From the Turks in Europe, he passed to the Pagans in America, where towards the latter end of the Raign of Queen Elizabeth, such his Perils, Preservations, Dangers, Deliverances, they seem to most men above belief, to some beyond Truth. Yet have we two witnesses to attest them, the Prose and the Pictures both in his own book, and it soundeth much to the diminution of his deeds, that he alone is the Herauld to publish and proclaime them." Often referenced as the first slur on Smith's credibility as historian, an attack that surfaces big time in the 19th century with Charles Deane and Henry Adams.

This Lady was afterwards brought into England, Christened by the Name of Rebekah, and Married to one Mr. Rolf, and died at Gravesend in an intended Voyage back to her own Countrey."

Wharton, Henry. The Life of John Smith, English Soldier. 1685. Ed. Laura Polanyi Striker. U of North Carolina P, 1957. 72, 82, 89. Striker feels that the purpose of this unlikely, unpublished account of Smith's life in Latin by a prolific indefatigable theologian was meant to restore heroic status to a man "thwarted from the start by his being a commoner in an aristocratic venture." Striker feels that Wharton's work on the Virginia part of Smith's life (the account ends with his return to England in 1609) is drawn from the Generall Historie. Be that as it may, there are significant variations (there is no confrontation between Smith and Indians over the murder plot that Pocahontas saves them from in her dark night journey), Wharton embellished significantly at times (calling Pocahontas a "mad woman" at the rescue, describing Pocahontas's dark night journey as inspiring "even those who sleep with terror"), and the charge that Smith wanted to marry Pocahontas is only in Symonds (1612) and Purchas (1625), not the Generall Historie. So in Wharton we first see some tentative free-lancing with the historical record. He plays loose with the story for dramatic purposes, and the result is a very good read, indeed. (In 1834 George Hillard used Wharton in his biography of Smith, so that this unpublished work did have influence in the 19th century.)

Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina P, 1947. 37-44.) Beverley's influential book is the first history by a native Virginian. Beverley mentions the rescue without fanfare but focuses on Pocahontas's marriage with Rolfe and reunion with Smith. For instance, he gives a long litany of reasons why the English would have been better off accepting Indian proposals for intermarriages, and he prints the entire Smith letter to Queen Anne. Beverley's drawing mostly on Smith (the letter is not in Purchas) but he also adds material not found elsewhere: King James's snit over Rolfe marrying royalty, the dialogue with Uttamaccomack (Uttamatamakin/Tomocomo), that Pocahontas would have brought "the Indians to have a kinder Disposition towards the English." Tilton 1994 says this book "contains the first important colonial attempt to reconstruct the Pocahontas narrative," and he finds the topic of intermarriage (cf. Alexander, Oldmixon, Fontaine, Russell, Chastellux, etc.) central to the first phase of Pocahontas representation.

Oldmixon is aware of Smith's Generall Historie, referring readers there for a description of the rescue, saying only that Pocahontas's "wonderful Humanity" in saving Smith is a "remarkable Instance, how vain we are to our selves, in thinking that all who do not resemble us in our Customs are barbarous." Instead, he draws from and adds to Beverley (though in the preface to the 1741 edition he mentions a manuscript by William Byrd I), calling the king's snit a "very notable piece of King-Craft" and suggesting that "the Reader may judge" how likely intermarriage would have brought peace, "but the English were not fond of taking the Indian Women to their Beds as their Wives. Whether it was on account of their being Pagan or Barbarians we cannot decide; or whether that Nicety was not very unseasonable in the Infancy of the Settlement." See also 1741.

Tilton 1994 says this painting "is certainly the first original depiction of Pocahontas produced in the New World, and almost surely the first done by a woman" (111). Lubbers 1994 says "she looks like a graduate from a young ladies' finishing school(174).

Likely the first proposal, says Towner, "urging the elevation of Pocahontas to the status of American folk heroine" via a poem, a painting, or a statue. The anonymous English correspondent writes: "For my own part I don't recollect any of the celebrated Heroines of Antiquity of half so just a behaviour or that any way exceed her in virtue or true greatness of Mind. How many Statues and Medals would have been made by the Romans in memory of such a Lady?" The letter is followed by an account of the Smith-Pocahontas story from Beverley.

Smith having never dropt his main Design to make himself the Hero of his History. . . . Capt.

Stith, well-regarded influential historian of Virginia after Beverley and president of the College of William and Mary, claims dissatisfaction with previous histories and access to original sources. His work on Pocahontas appears mainly, though, a long, long comprehensive paraphrase solely of Smith's Generall Historie (the rescue, Pocahontas as gift-bringer, her second rescue on the dark night, saving Wyffin, abduction) till the trip to England, which is a blend of material from Smith, Beverley (King James's snit), and Purchas (Tomocomo's failed arithmetic). However, what Stith adds to the Pocahontas story comes at the end, information about her son Thomas, who was first left in England with Sir Lewis Stukley, but then transferred to Henry Rolfe, "and afterwards became a Person of Distinction and Fortune in this Country," where the "Imperial Family of Virginia . . . is now encreased and branched out into a very numerous Progeny."

Englishman Bampfylde-Moore Carew was a real, nationally known character -- swindler, imposter, jokester -- whose life was a best seller in numerous and various editions for a hundred years. In this biography he joins the Gypsies, becomes King of the Beggars, is transported to Maryland, escapes, and sojourns with the Indians, at which point, we get the Smith-Pocahontas story (rescue, abduction, marriage, trip to England, meeting Smith) as an example of noble action by an Indian. Goadby has been described as a key figure in the book trade of the west of England, and his Pocahontas account is copied from Oldmixon.

Someone has suggested that the woman might be one of the Indian women who came to London with Pocahontas and stayed on (see 1621). Sedgeford Hall is a property of the Rolfe family in England.

Smith "is preserved by the affection of a young Indian damsel . . . and by her conducted back to the colony." Also mentions Pocahontas saving Henry Spilman, her abduction, her marriage, and her baptism. Pocahontas "was the first christian Indian of these parts, and, as my author says, perhaps the most worthy that has ever been since, her affection to her husband extremely constant, and on his part to her in every respect reciprocal." "My author" is apparently Stith.

Seems to be chiefly copied from Stith, except for embellishments like this, which may be the first expression of love of Pocahontas for Smith: "By this means he [Smith] got them all to resolve to maintain their fort, and to provide for themselves in the best manner they could; and this resolution was in a few days confirmed by Pocahontas's coming with a great number of attendants, and bringing them plenty of all kinds of provisions, which she continued to do every four or five days for some years afterwards; for Capt. Smith had impressed such an idea upon the Indians of the English courage and knowledge, and such a terror of their instruments of war, that Pocahontas easily prevailed with her father and her countrymen to allow her to indulge her passion for the captain, by often visiting the fort, and always accompanying her visits with a fresh supply of provisions; therefore it may justly be said, that the success of our first settlement in America, was chiefly owing to the love that this young girl had conceived for Capt. Smith, and consequently in this instance, as well as many others, that love does all that's great below" (355). Closing the circle, this account describes the reunion of Smith and Pocahontas in this manner: "She at first shewed great resentment against him, which is a plain sign of her having expected that he would have married her, and indeed it was what he ought in gratitude to have done. However, such is the native modesty of the sex in all countries, that she did not even then insinuate any such expectation" (435). Another first here is the charge of ingratitude to Smith for not marrying Pocahontas.

Virginian Fontaine sees value in intermarriage with the Indians (land inheritance, peace, conversion), "but this our wise politicians at home put an effective stop to at the beginning of our settlement here, for when they heard that Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in Council, whether he had not committed high treason by doing so, that is, marrying an Indian Princess; and had not some troubles intervened which put a stop to the inquiry, the poor man might have ben hanged up for doing the most just, the most natural, the most generous and polite action that ever was done this side of the water." For others on the idea of intermarriage, see Beverley, Alexander, Oldmixon, Russell, Chastellux, etc., during this first phase of Pocahontas representation.

Copies accounts by Stith of Pocahontas's two rescues of Smith, her abduction, marriage, trip to England, and reunion with Smith, even including Smith's letter to Queen Anne (these last two points do not seem directly drawn from Stith and may go back to Beverley).

Winkfield, Unca Eliza. [pseud.] The Female American, or, The Adventures of Unca Eliza Winkfield. London, 1767. (Rpt. sometimes as The Female American, or, The Extraordinary Adventures of Unca Eliza Winkfield or The Female American in 1800, 1814, 1970, 1974, 2001.) This early novel, which Burnham (editor of the 2001 edition) says "adds a great deal to our understanding of the cross-articulation of gender, empire, and race," begins with a version of the Pocahontas story in which rescuer and rescued marry. Captured in the 1622 massacre, the narrator's father is about to be executed when the king's daughter "stroked my father with a wand, the signal for deliverance." The Indian declares her love: "Though a complexion so different, as that of the princess from an European, cannot but at first disgust, yet by degrees my father grew insensible to the difference, and in other respects her person was not inferior to that of the greatest beauty; but what was more, her understanding was uncommonly great, pleasantly lively, and wonderfully comprehensive, even of subjects unknown to her, till informed of them by my father, who took extraordinary pains to instruct her; for now he loved in his turn." Marriage to a "Pagan" is out of the question, however, but she "became convinced of her errors" and converts. So "happy was my father . . . that he began to look upon the country he was in as his own." (Interestingly, though we just saw the introduction of Pocahontas's love for Smith in 1755, Smith will not be a romantic partner for a long time.)

Russell, a successful historian who also published major works on modern and ancient Europe, wrote this history during the Revolutionary War, which he calls in his sub-title "the present unhappy contest." Russell footnotes the Generall Historie several times but covers only and briefly Pocahontas's rescuing actions (suggesting her love for Smith) and her marriage with Rolfe (without, amazingly, any indication at all that she was a hostage at the time). For instance, he says, the "kindness of this fair Indian" did not stop with the rescue of Smith, but "Pocahontas supplied her favourite so plentifully with provisions, that he was enabled to save the lives of many, who must otherwise have perished for want." And also "but what contributed more especially to the safety as well as advancement of the colony, was the marriage of John Rolfe, a young gentleman of great merit, to the princess Pocahontas, who had formerly shown such a predilection for captain Smith." This latter point, followed up with a rosy picture of Powhatan's resulting "cordial amity" with the English, generates a footnote about the value of intermarriage similar to Beverley, Oldmixon, Fontaine.

While the notes show he was aware of Smith, Purchas, and Stith, Chalmers (like Crouch a century before) doesn't mention Pocahontas at all, and, in fact, finds little exciting at all in his chapter on Virginia: "In vain shall we search their history for the fate of battles, the sack of cities, the conquest of provinces, for those objects that fix the attention or melt the heart." Apparently, the Smith-Pocahontas narrative did not enliven "the uninteresting turmoils of a few men, stationed in a desert, whose principal pursuit was for some time only in quest of food." What became national mythology for us is not even on his radar screen -- an interesting point relating to the construction of history.

(Translated and notes by Howard C. Rice, Jr. Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina P, 1963. 419-26.) The Marquis de Chastellux was one of the French Generals who aided the Revolutionary cause. He recounts a visit to the Bollings where he was surprised to find the descendant of Pocahontas -- whom he calls "the protectress of the English" and an "angel of peace" -- quite European looking. His version of Pocahontas's life -- very influential, quite colorful, much copied (even as late as Blake 1825) -- has some interesting touches: savages "more affected by the tears of infancy, than the voice of humanity," begging Smith to "spare her family" and "to terminate all their differences by a new treaty," bitterly deploring her fate as a captive, throwing herself into Smith's arms in England, living "several years" as model wife there. Chastellux also, like Beverley, raises the issue of intermarriage, nailing James I for being "so infatuated with the prerogatives of royalty" to be upset that one of his subjects married a princess (for other discussion of intermarriage in this early period, see Alexander, Oldmixon, Fontaine, Russell, etc.). Tilton 1994 believes Chastellux to be the "most important purveyor" of the Pocahontas narrative before John Davis.

"Anecdote of Pocahunta, a Savage Princess, and Captain Smith, an Englishman." [London] Daily Universal Register 16 April 1787: 3. A bit loosely but clearly drawn from Chastellux. Perhaps for the first time, Pocahontas is given a voice in direct discourse at the rescue scene: at the "fatal moment" Pocahontas cries out, "if you kill him the first blow must fall on me." And Powhatan's "heart melted with sympathy." And thus another small step away from simple reporting of the event.

"Anecdotes of Pocahunta, an Indian Princess, from whom several respectable families in Virginia are descended." [Philadelphia] Columbian Magazine 1 (July 1787): 548-51. Directly from Chastellux.

(Ed. Winthrop D. Jordan. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1965. 201-2.) Relevant to the topic of intermarriage that we've seen raised several times so far in the archive (for instance, Beverley, Oldmixon, Fontaine, Russell, Chastellux). Smith argues, against Kaims, that in four or five generations, the "dark tinge" in mixing of races "may be entirely effaced." As evidence, he points to two male descendants of Pocahontas, in which Indian characteristics "appear to be entirely obliterated." One in particular is "perfectly Anglo-American." Thus, like Chastellux, there is evidence that what we might call the bad part of the interracial marriage, Indian color, fades while the good characteristics remain.

Reprints exactly and without editorial comment the 1616 "little booke" relating to Pocahontas's London visit, as well as his description of their meeting, that Smith published in the Generall Historie.

(The key pages are 638-40, 702, 722, 725-26.) The American Plutarch series title tells us that this anonymous piece was by Belknap, who published this again in his very influential 1794 American Biography: contains accounts of the rescues, the "Virginia Maske" (though see Salmon and Douglass, perhaps the first time in an historical account since Smith), the reunion in England, and the death. Belknap notes his sources as Smith and Purchas.

Morse was the most eminent geographer of his day, author of the first textbook on American geography published in the United States. Brief mention of Pocahontas's marriage, her trip to England (where she was treated by merited "attention and respect"), and her death, leaving a son who eventually returned to Virginia "where he lived and died in affluence and honour."

Thanks to Colin Wells for the citation, who says, "It's fascinating as an attempt to use the Pocahontas myth to justify the war against the Miami (Ohio) tribes in the early 1790s." According to Cornstalk: "Her little cabin still is neat and clean, / When she has work to mind she is not seen; / A thousand little cupids round her wait, / She keeps her house in order air and late:-- / Strives to domesticate her roving race / To cultivate the soil, and quite the chace. / Happy, young Princess, if thy labours prove / The source of so much health, and so much love."

Castiglioni, Luigi. Viaggio: Travels in the United States of North America, 1785-87. 1790. Ed. Antonio Pace. Syracuse: Syracuse UP: 1983. 190-92. Interesting script by the Italian Naturalist. Smith is condemned to be burned alive. Pocahontas pleads for him, and he was "united with his liberator, and was respected by the Indians, who regard as one of their nation the prisoners that they allow to live." Both go to England, where, when Smith "no longer showed her the affection that he manifested in America, she became disgusted with him and the ingratitude with which she was treated," whereupon she left him, returned to Virginia, and married Rolfe.

Webster, of course, is the premier early American educator and dictionary maker. This story, likely adapted from Belknap, of Smith as a model hero ("Such a man affords a noble example for all to follow when they resolve to be good and brave") describes Pocahontas saving him from death, warning him about another plot ("Thus this kind and friendly young Indian saved the English from her father's snares"), and their meeting in England ("an agreeable interview with the amiable Pocahontas"). In what is perhaps her first appearance in a schoolbook, Pocahontas is climactically represented as an "excellent woman, who would have done honor to christianity itself."

"Pocahontas." 1793. (William M. S. Rasmussen and Robert S. Tilton, Pocahontas: Her Life and Legend. Richmond: Virginia Historical Society, 1994. 32.) According to Rasmussen and Tilton, in this re-issue of the van de Passe engraving, Pocahontas's "features have become more those of an Englishwoman": "To eighteenth-century European eyes, this less 'native' Pocahontas perhaps comes closer to achieving the beauty that would have been expected of the 'Indian princess' of legend."

Belknap's collection of biographies was very influential and much copied. The Smith life contains accounts of the rescues, the "Virginia Maske," the reunion in England, and the death. In the magazine publication, Belknap notes his sources as Smith and Purchas.

Latrobe, thought of as the father of the American architectural profession and the most important engineer of his day, covers eight generations of genealogy here. Rather fascinating: this edition contains images of Latrobe's handwritten chart. "Should Monarchy and its concomitant, Nobility of blood, ever come again into fashion in this Country, an event which at this moment is most seriously apprehended by, and disturbs the sleep of many of our good citizens, I hope the blood of Powhatan will not be neglected, unless the great good sense, and merit of many of his descendants whom I know, should be thought less necessary to a man of title, than to a plain commoner. It is somewhat singular that, though the family are rather proud of their royal Indian blood, not one of them should have preferred the names of their Ancestors in their own family excepting Robert Bolling, son of Colonel John Bolling who named a son and a daughter Powhatan and Pocahontas. He was a man of great wit and learning."

Robertson, William. The History of America. Books IX and X. Edinburgh, 1796. 72-73, 92-95. One of the foremost historians of his day, Robertson, head of the University of Edinburgh, moved in intellectual circles with such men as David Hume, Adam Smith, and Thomas Carlyle. His section on Virginia draws on Smith, Stith, Beverley, and Purchas -- with some interesting variations. Pocahontas's motivation in saving Smith is "that fond attachment of the American women to their European invaders," and her marriage to Rolfe is the consequence of frequent visits to Jamestown, "where her admiration of their arts and manners continued to increase," not to being a prisoner (which is not mentioned at all), as well as the impression her superior beauty made on Rolfe. She seems to have been baptized in England, that is, after her marriage, and Robertson follows Beverley and others regarding intermarriage in criticizing the English for failure to intermarry (the result of cultural shyness and lack of flexibility), which the Indians "naturally imputed . . . to pride and to their contempt of them as an inferior order of beings."

This is the beginning of the Davis cottage industry on Pocahontas that would include eight or so works and extend into the 1820s. Here in a chapter seemingly unrelated to the rest of the plot, the narrator's son tells the family a "once upon a time" story of Pocahuntas, an "Indian Queen," not a "squaw," who saves Captain Smith from death by burning at the stake. This tale, drawn from Chastellux and modified only by fire as the death tool, is tame compared to Davis's following works, which are credited with blowing Pocahontas representations wide open. Tilton 1994 says that Davis removes the Pocahontas story from the "exclusive preserve of historians and biographers."

She's "whiter far, than other natives are," but her lover has to worry "How will it sound, that you are close ally'd / In marriage vows, with a young tawny savage?" The play concludes with a treaty of peace and a vision of the "future destiny" of the colony that is representative of the nationalistic thrust of the time.

(Ed. Alfred J. Morrison. New York: Holt, 1909. 285-322. Poems: 309, 310, 311, 317.) (Rpt. as Personal Adventures and Travels of Four Years and a Half in the United States of America. London, 1817.) The second of Davis's book work on Pocahontas, containing perhaps the first poems written about her, and containing the wildest representation of her yet -- initiating future directions. Drawing on Smith and Beverley for his basic "facts" and motivated to best Chastellux as a memorialist ("No Traveller before me has erected a monument to her memory, by a display of her virtues"), Davis completely romanticizes Pocahontas for the first time. Davis's main contribution to the developing representation of Pocahontas is to make love her primary motivation (see Kimber 1755). Pocahontas falls deeply in love with Smith at first sight; he recognizes her love, cultivates it, but doesn't reciprocate it. When Smith leaves, Rolfe capitalizes on her emotional devastation, catches her on the rebound, and eventually marries her, taking her to England, where there is reunion with Smith. For the first time, Pocahontas is "hot."

A visit to Pocahontasâ€™s birthplace spurs a melancholy meditation on the plight of the Indians on the part of this prominent lawyer who, in the 1830s, would defend the Cherokee before the Supreme Court. Virginians have â€œno right to this country,â€ and it is â€œno wonderâ€ that the â€œpoor wretchesâ€ are so â€œimplacably vindictive against the white people." Wirtâ€™s â€œsoul melts with pity and shame," and he states that if he were president he would â€œbury the tomahawkâ€ by asking for forgiveness and permission to remain in their homeland. But Pocahontas, â€œthe patron deity of the enterpriseâ€ worthy of â€œa better fate,â€ undoubtedly sought in her marriage "the abolition of all distinction between Indians and white men," and deserves a festival â€œin honour of her memory." Without this â€œsensible and amiable woman,â€ â€œthe anniversary cannon of the Fourth of July would never have resounded throughout the United States." And thus this essay is one of the earliest indications of what would be called the "Indian problem" and one of the earliest calls for public canonization of the â€œunfortunate princess.â€ (See Ruricola 1831 for testimony to the lasting influence of this essay.)

First, Burk heralds the pictorial potential that would flower in the 19th century: â€œThe spectacle of Pocahontas in an attitude of entreaty, with her hair loose, and her eyes streaming with tears . . . is a situation equal to the genius of Raphael [and in which] the painter will discover a new occasion for exercising his talents.â€ And, secondly, Burk foresees the emergence of a Smith-Pocahontas romance: â€œIt is not even improbable, that, considering everything relating to captain Smith and Pocahontas as a mere fiction, [posterity] may vent their spleen against the historian, for impairing the interest of his plot, by marrying the princess of Powhatan to a Mr. Rolfe, of whom nothing had previously been said, in defiance of all the expectations raised by the foregoing parts of the fable.â€

"The poetry with which the volume is interspersed is very inferior to the prose. It is introduced with peculiar impropriety, in the history of captain Smith and the female Indian Pocahontas. This history, Mr. Davis assures us, has been related with an inviolable adherence to truth, every circumstance being rejected that had not evidence to support it: but by attributing his own verses to one of the personages, he has given a character of fiction to the story which was in itself too romantic to be believed without a solemn affirmation of its authenticity." But the description of the young Indian girl who reminds Smith of Pocahontas is quoted liberally.

"A Sketch of the Life of Pocahontas." [Boston] Monthly Anthology 1.4 (February 1804): 170-74. Not clear if this is by Davis or drawn from his 1803 Travels. Begins right at Smith's capture rather than developing his previous history as in Travels, but the basic plot is the same and some phrases are exact or similar. Most obvious difference is the classical reference: Pocahontas is Dido, Hortensia, the Goddess of Plenty. And ends with: "When we reflect that so much virtue, heroism, intellect and piety adorned so young a native of our country, we cannot but regard America as the natural clime of greatness, and consider Pocahontas, as exhibiting proof of the powers and capacity of savage nature, rather than an exception to common degeneracy." Could well be Davis because a comparison of the 1805 Captain Smith and Pocahontas with Travels shows that Davis recycles his basic plot with variation, and Tilton 1994 (p. 51) shows Davis quoting the Aeneid about Dido. Striking article; reprinted several times -- see below -- through 1814.

Same basic story of Pocahontas smitten with Smith who transfers her passion immediately to Rolfe when he is presumed dead as in the 1803 Travels, but there is considerable exotic and erotic elaboration in descriptions of Pocahontas (cherub lips, luxuriant tresses, filling bosom) and events (the happy couple's "first intercourse" and "conjugal endearments"). Pocahontas is even "hotter" than she was in 1803. (Appendices include accounts of Smith and Jamestown, a memoir of the author, as well as Smith's letter to the Queen introducing Pocahontas. A final note mentions the possibility of a sequel called Massacre of the Virginia Planters.) (Kribbs 1975 quotes a subscription appeal to "the Philadelphia ladies of tender sensibilities," who "will all come forward with alacrity as Patronesses to a volume that records the virtues, and develops the conscious flame of Pocahontas the lovely, the susceptible and artless!"

Pocahontas, a New World Medea, is urged to "Let virtue's voice o'er filial fears prevail" and lead Smith to safety, "For thine shall be his friends, his heart, his name; His camp shall shout, his nation boast thy fame."

Report of the Proceedings of the Late Jubilee at James-Town. Petersburg, 1807. 5, 8, 18, 19, 20, 42, 43. A collection of "orations, odes, and toasts" (including the one in the entries above) delivered at the Bicentennial celebration (the first) on May 13th. The amiable, tender, compassionate Pocahontas is remembered several times, especially in regard to the rescue, and toasted thus: "The benignant spirit, whose humanity and courage so often snatched our ancestors from famine and the sword . . . Her ashes lie neglected in a strange land, without monument or device; without Barrow, or string of Wampum, but her gentle spirit is in the midst of us, and we hail her with reverence and admiration, as the guardian genius of our fathers, or our infancy, of our cradles."

Barker, James Nelson. The Indian Princess; or, La Belle Sauvage. Philadelphia, 1808. Music by John Bray. (Representative Plays by American Dramatists. Ed. Montrose J. Moses. New York: Dutton, 1918.) (The Romantic Indian. Ed. Charles M. Lombard. Vol. 2. Delmar: Scholars' Facsimiles and Reprints, 1981.) (Early American Drama. Ed. Jeffrey H. Richards. New York: Penguin, 1997.) (John Bray, The Indian Princess. New World Records NW-232.) (New York: Da Capo Press, 1972.) The first play in English about Pocahontas and based, says Barker, on Smith's Generall Historie and "as close an adherence to historic truth has been preserved as dramatic rules would allow of." Which is not much. The English come to the New World for altruistic purposes, to bring civilization to the Indians. Their presence creates a division among the Indians, and the English actually fight with the "good" against the "bad" (led by Pocahontas's Indian lover). Twice Pocahontas saves Smith, whom she treats as a "brother" (asserting the first time, "White man, thou shalt not die; or I will die with thee!"), for it is Rolfe she loves ("I lived not till I saw thee"), though they do not marry within the play. The play ends with a thumpingly patriotic speech by Smith envisioning "a great, yet virtuous empire in the west" disjoined "from old licentious Europe" that underscores Barker's nationalistic purpose.

This is a selection of the first seven paragraphs from the 1803 Wirt essay, the part with the very tough comments about the dire state of the Indians. The trip to Pocahontas's birthplace is simply the occasion for this excerpt; the parts of the original Wirt essay relating to her are not included.

"Retrospective Notice of American Literature." [Boston] Monthly Analog [Boston Review] 5 (August 1808): 455-60. This was a series of essays on valuable older books begun in March 1808 and here dealing with a London 1627 edition of Smith's Generall Historie. The author finds Smith's letter to Queen Anne a "curious morsel," and he quotes at length the reunion with Pocahontas in England, comparing it to Beverley's account.

Baltimore, 1809. 153-55. Smith as the husband of Pocahontas?? That's an interesting slippage given the history of Pocahontas representations. But included here are the fictional speeches from Davis's 1805 First Settlers of Virginia by Opitchapan, Kahoky, and Nantaquas before Powhatan, arguing for and against killing the captive Smith (pp.47-50).

Marcy, William. An Oration on the Three Hundred and Eighteenth Anniversary of the Discovery of America Delivered before the Tammany Society or Columbian Order. Troy, 1809. 47. The Tammany Society, best known for being a powerful and corrupt political force in New York in the mid-19th century, was named after a Lenape Indian and promoted a positive view of Indian culture. This speech by William L. Marcy (later Governor of New York and U.S. Secretary of State and not to be confused with William Marcy Tweed -- the infamous Boss Tweed) reminds hearers that "our social felicity and national importance spring from the misfortunes" of the Indians. What should we do? "Let us recollect they are the same race, and believe they are capable of the same friendship and generosity -- the same independence of soul and love of liberty, which distinguished a Pocahontas or a Logan. Justice and humanity demand that we should cast off our illiberal and barbarous notions concerning the Indians, and no longer amuse ourselves with the unreal picture of their unmerciful cruelty, savage ferocity, and barbarous inhumanity."

Randolph, Edmund. History of Virginia. 1809-1813. Ed. Arthur H. Shaffer. Charlottesville: UP of Virginia, 1970. 24, 61-64. Randolph, a powerful political figure (governor of Virginia and first U.S. Attorney General) was a descendant of Pocahontas, and his basic facts come from Stith. In regard to Pocahontas, he says some "sudden impulse of love or compassion" saved Smith, "the soul of the Virginian enterprise," and "With whatever justice soever the character of an uncivilized Indian may have been drawn as cool, cruel, sullen, suspicious, and designing, a better class ought to be assigned to hers." Pocahontas was "beautiful, engaging, and innocent," with a "compassionate and susceptible heart," who looked "up to Smith as a second father, not as a companion for love."

Review of "Tears and Smiles, a Comedy, by J. N. Barker / The Indian Princess or La Belle Sauvage, an Operatich Melo-Drama, in three acts, by J. N. Barker." The Ordeal; a Critical Journal of Politicks and Literature 1.21 (May 27, 1809): 322-26. The reviewer notes the difficulty American dramatists have in garnering respect, and he holds the two Barker plays up for worthy attention. The "principal interest" in the latter play is the Rolfe-Pocahontas romance, and a love scene "is well wrought, replete with tenderness, and superiour to the composition of most of the modern European play-compilers."

C. "Notice of Captain John Smith, The Father of American Colonization." [Philadelphia] Port-Folio 8.3 (Sept. 1812): 218-33. The unknown "C" does not seem to be slavishly following past accounts. He covers only one episode in the Virginia period of Smith's life: the capture/rescue/conspiracy events. At the "critical moment," a "protecting Providence" snatched Smith from destruction. Pocahontas was "deeply interested in the fate of Smith." Her rescue, "which, in point of benevolence and romantickness of character, has scarcely a parallel in the records of fable, was crowned with success." The "thirst for blood" in the crowd "was converted, as by magic, into a sentiment of humanity," and Powhatan was "softened and subdued by this more than human daring of his daughter."
