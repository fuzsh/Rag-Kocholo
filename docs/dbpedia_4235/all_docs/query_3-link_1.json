It's always love, club activities, and play, so I'm having fun. I have no friends. I have no lover. I haven't even entered club activities. Youth has nothing to do with it. But what's wrong with that!? Those who appreciate such crap and those who look down on me are all shit. That's what I thought. Until I met her.\n\nAn empty doorway. A broken clog box. Dirty stairs. A wooden corridor where the floor is likely to come off. There was a secret room at the back of the third floor of such an old school building. Wearing a black triangle hat and robe, Mei-senpai draws magic squares on the floor and is eager to curse people with black magic. She brushes her graceful hair over her ears, with big eyes as clear as the sea, and she tells me, squeezing.\n\n\"Because I'm cursed\"\n\nSpring when the sky is clear and blue and cherry blossoms dance. I can't forget her smile that she met in high school when she just entered, even now as an adult.\n\nThe story of a high school student who will give an irreplaceable youth by meeting a senior who is worshiped as a saint.\n\nLight Novel Volumes[]\n\nGakuen no Seiji ga Ore no Tonari de Kokumajutsu wo Shite Imasu Information Release Date JP: May 10, 2022 ISBN-13 JP: ISBN 9784049139358 Number of Pages 296 What you need for youth may be a curse ...!\n\nWhat is youth.
