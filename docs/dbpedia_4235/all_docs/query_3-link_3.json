        "text": "Welcome to the Wiki Spotlight page\n\nSpotlighting for anime/manga wiki on the Animanga Wiki's main page\n\nThe Animanga Wiki spotlights various wiki on its main page. Normally these are lesser-known wiki that could use contributors.\n\nOf course there are some criteria for spotlighting.\n\nA wiki needs to be here on Fandom\n\nA wiki needs to have a few actual contributors to the wiki.\n\nThe wiki needs some content already, or helpful hints on how to help out.\n\nIt must have a link back to the Animanga wiki.\n\nIn the Wiki-navigation(if there is room) as:**w:c:animanga|Anime/Manga Hub\n\nor in the Wiki-navigation(main dropdown) as:*w:c:animanga|Anime/Manga Hub\n\nAnd on the main page as one of the footers, {{w:animangafooter}} or {{w:ACGBox}}\n\nWe're trying to network wiki together, spotlighting without links in the reverse direction don't aid the flow of users. Simple promotion via series articles doesn't require this of course.\n\nWith the exception of established wiki with a heavily vandalized main page, the main page must not be fully protected, and should only be semi protected if shown to be necessary.\n\nHave an idea for a good spotlight? Create a new section on the talkpage suggesting it.\n\nDo Spotlights Work?[]\n\nIt depends, for wikis with high traffic already, probably not, for low traffic wikis, yes. Although it helps increase traffic to the wiki, it doesn't mean there will be new contributors, maybe just readers.\n\nPrior to using the cross-wiki footer(Apr 2010), there wasn't much change in traffic to spotlit wikis. After the footer was used there was much clearer traffic spikes on some wikis.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of a traffic spike during a spotlight:\n\nYou can view your wikis traffic at: quantcast.com, just change the url. access removed by Fandom, though you can see any changes in your admin dashboard quickstats under Special:Analytics.\n\nTo do for monthly update\n\nSpotlights[]"
