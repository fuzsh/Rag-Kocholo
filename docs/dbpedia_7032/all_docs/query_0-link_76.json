        "text": "The Manitoba Historical Society recognizes the role that we, as an organization, can play in supporting the calls to action made by the National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. We also understand that before real change can happen, the truth must be revealed, and only then can we make the path clear for reconciliation. Our organization is committed to help educate, support, preserve, and promote Indigenous, First Nations, Métis, and Inuit histories, traditions, languages, and culture through our publications and online resources. We can help to address the systemic racism, discrimination, and marginalization that has been experienced by Indigenous communities in Canada.\n\nWe acknowledge that the Manitoba Historical Society office is located on original lands of Anishinaabeg, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota, and Dene peoples, and on the homeland of the Métis Nation. We respect the Treaties that were made on these territories, we acknowledge the harms and mistakes of the past, and we dedicate ourselves to move forward in partnership with Indigenous communities in a spirit of reconciliation and collaboration."
