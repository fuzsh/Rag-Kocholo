        "text": "Member\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 7,461\n\nLikes: 1\n\nDear Discerning, the closest thing we have to the four-volume Roman breviary in Slavic Eastern Catholic usage in English is the five-volume set of books published by the Sisters of St. Basil the Great in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. These are, (1)Vespers, (2) Matins, (3)Triodion (Sunday of Zaccheus through the midnight service of Pascha), (4) Pentecostarion (Paschal Matins through the first sunday after Pentecost which we call Sunday of All Saints) and the Festal Menaion which covers all of the major fixed feast days. Even this five volume set is abbreviated (believe it or not) especially in the Menaion which has abbreviated many of the Matins canons and the Triodion which has abbreviated some Matins canons and does not include some Great Compline canons among other things...\n\nThere are several sources of books for Orthodox usage, including New Skete, St. John of Kronstadt Press, Holy Transfiguration Monastery in Massachusetts, etc. in addition to that Alex has mentioned above. Just in terms of a \"carry-on\" prayer book, somewhat pocket sized, I love the Old Believer prayer book from Erie, Pennsylvania. This book has the general form of the \"little hours\" of the day which would correspond somewhat to Prime, Terce, Sext, and None, which are some of the best offices in the Byzantine tradition for solo recitation.\n\nYou can see that to get a \"complete\" set of liturgical offices for the year is really quite a task! And if you throw in the various molebens, akafists and other occasional services, there really is no single individual source of texts in English in either Eastern Catholic or Orthodox usage. You will have to mix and match from several sources...this is the Byzantine way, get used to it...God bless\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Diak,\n\nYes, I too cherish the Old Believer prayer book and I understand that they are now working on a fuller Horologion as well.\n\nYour point on the Old Rite in Ukraine is interesting and Met. Ilarion Ohienko commented on this in his works.\n\nThe two-fingered Sign of the Cross (\"Dvoperstiye\") actually never came into the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the 17th century or before.\n\nThe Kyivan ties to the Greek Church were simply too strong for that to have happened. The Ukrainian Saint Dmytro Tuptalenko and others wrote quite scathing critiques of the Old Believers, denying, for example, that the Church ever sanctioned the use of the Christogram for laity etc.\n\nThis practice and other aspects of the Old Believers seem to have been a uniquely Russian phenomenon.\n\nEven Patriarch Nicon was himself a Hellenophile to the point of preferring Greek over Russian food!\n\nHe considered a number of Russian practices substandard because they did not conform to the Greek which he held above all.\n\nOf course, the Tsar wished to become Emperor of all the Orthodox, so that was his stake in promoting the Niconian reforms.\n\nSt Peter Mohyla addressed the Old Believer schism by essentially creating a uniquely Kyivan Sign of the Cross.\n\nUsing the three fingers, we invoke the Holy Trinity as per usual. Then we say the Jesus Prayer, the Old Believer's words for the Sign of the Cross, immediately following. This is how Mohyla laid down the Slavic Sign of the Cross in his Catechism.\n\nAnd of course the use of the Jesus Prayer in making the three-fingered Sign of the Cross was also permitted.\n\nAlex\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 7,461\n\nLikes: 1\n\nThere were pockets of Old Believers well into parts of Western Ukraine - a sizeable one in Bukhovyna. This is well outside of the original areas served by Archpriest Avvakum. Perhaps they were the descendants of those who fled Tsarist oppression and suppression of their practices?\n\nExcellent point about Metropolitan Petro Mohyla, in his usual genius he synthesized practices with economia into a uniquely Kyivan way...\n\nMetropolitan Sheptytsky certainly tried to reach out to the Old Believers through Fr. Eustachy Susalev, an Old Believer priest who was also a fan of Soloviev and later became Greek Catholic...and it is interesting that there were some Old Ritual Greek Catholic missions served by Father Susalev until they were apparently all wiped out during the Soviet era...do you think we could re-vitalize the Old Ritual within our Church? I've already got the beard and the sorochka/rubashka...Just dreaming...\n\nSubdeacon Randolph, a sinner\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Diak,\n\nYou've touched on a number of fascinating points.\n\nYes, the Old Believers escaped into Ukraine beginning with the persecutions of Tsar Alexei IV.\n\nUkraine was historically a \"holding tank\" for all sorts of sects, including the Socinians!\n\nThese groups were not persecuted in Ukraine, there was plenty of wheat and bread to go around and they were left alone.\n\nEven the Pochaiv Lavra at one time published the Old Believer liturgical and catechetical books (see Met. Ilarion Ohienko's work on the Lavra where he includes an entire list of these books).\n\nThe Old Believers had quite the devotion to the three-bar Orthodox Cross and believed, unlike the Niconian Church, that this was the only valid Cross. They regarded the one-bar Cross as \"Latin Chrismo.\" In Ukraine, no one was going to argue with them over what kind of Cross they preferred!\n\nIt is no wonder that their eventual renewal as a Church with the Priesthood began in Ukraine at Bila Krinitsa.\n\nI've also collaborated with an Old Believer living in Kyiv on a video about their history and I'm very pleased to say the fellow included my name among the credits at the end! Cool or what?\n\nCertainly, not only Andrew Sheptytsky, but Patriarch Joseph the Confessor also promoted the Old Rite within the Ukrainian Catholic Church and the Patriarch was accepted as the spiritual pastor of a number of Old Believer groups in Siberia - he made mention of this several times when he got out of captivity.\n\nFor the Patriarch, his Church was not only for Ukrainians, but was the Church of Kyivan-Rus' that includes Belarusyns, Russians, Siberians, Old Believers etc.\n\nWe Ukrainian Catholics have lost this vision in our self-imposed ethnic limitations.\n\nAlex\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 33\n\nThank you very much, Alex and Diak, for the information. Now pulling together all of these books...I had a good laugh at the \"This is the Byzantine way--get used to it!\" I'm finding this out more and more. As I learn more and more, I find I have to refer to more and more books! Heck, even at Liturgy, I have to go between 2 or 3 books: for the readings, then the Tropars, etc. (if a feast day or proper), and then the \"Divine Liturgy of +St. J.C.\" 'missal'. It makes it very difficult to bless yourself when your fingers are stuck in a book trying to hold your place! Lots of paper cuts to the forehead!\n\nThanks again you guys! Sorry I haven't written back for a bit. Vacation and new job have occupied my time. I also lost my place of where I posted these questions. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa...\n\nPeace and prayers,\n\nRich\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 348\n\nQuote\n\nOriginally posted by Orthodox Catholic:\n\nUkraine was historically a \"holding tank\" for all sorts of sects, including the Socinians!\n\nThese groups were not persecuted in Ukraine, there was plenty of wheat and bread to go around and they were left alone.\n\nIt has little to do with Ukraine as such. It\n\nwas general characteristics of all the Commonwealth of Both Nations (Polish Crown and\n\nGreat Principality of Lithuania united in one state).\n\nQuote\n\nEven the Pochaiv Lavra at one time published the Old Believer liturgical and catechetical books (see Met. Ilarion Ohienko's work on the Lavra where he includes an entire list of these books).\n\nBasilians of Suprasl Lavra printed many books for\n\nOld Believers too.\n\nQuote\n\nThe Old Believers had quite the devotion to the three-bar Orthodox Cross and believed, unlike the Niconian Church, that this was the only valid Cross. They regarded the one-bar Cross as \"Latin Chrismo.\" In Ukraine, no one was going to argue with them over what kind of Cross they preferred!\n\nThe story is more complex: Old Believers' cross\n\nmust be not only three-bar, but also \"vosmikoniechnyi\" (a cross with 8 \"ends\").\n\nUkrainian three-bar crosses often have 7 \"ends\".\n\nQuote\n\nCertainly, not only Andrew Sheptytsky, but Patriarch Joseph the Confessor also promoted the Old Rite within the Ukrainian Catholic Church and the Patriarch was accepted as the spiritual pastor of a number of Old Believer groups in Siberia - he made mention of this several times when he got out of captivity.\n\nVery interesting. Could you tell more about it or/and provide a source?\n\nQuote\n\nFor the Patriarch, his Church was not only for Ukrainians, but was the Church of Kyivan-Rus' that includes Belarusyns, Russians, Siberians, Old Believers etc.\n\nWe Ukrainian Catholics have lost this vision in our self-imposed ethnic limitations.\n\nSo we have to regain that vision as soon as possible!\n\nHowever, \"Belarusyns\" don't exist, but \"BYELARUSY\"\n\ncertainly do!\n\nSincerely,\n\nsubdeacon Peter\n\n[ 06-28-2002: Message edited by: Piotr Siwicki ]\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 33\n\nHee hee hee!!! Subdeacon Randolph, If I had a swiveling analogion, I'd either break it, send books flying, or hurt myself (or others).\n\nNow here's my next question, sort of on subject, but dealing with the liturgy itself. I was visiting my parents in VA, and attended the little Ukrainian Catholic Church there. They had a very basic Ukrainian Divine Liturgy Book, and also the Ruthenian Divine Liturgy book. They said the main prayers from the Ukrainian, the topars and other propers from the Ruthenian, and then prayed parts in Old Slavonic, also taken from the Ruthenian book. Is it permissable to do this? I read the Ukrainian tropars, etc. and compared them to the ones in the Ruthenian book, and while the translations are essentially the same, the wording, in some cases, is very different. Could you please help me out and explain this to me? Or is this a more \"relaxed\" Ukrainian parish/priest (it was very small, the nave of the church was about the size of a large living room!)\n\nThanks!\n\nRich\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 7,461\n\nLikes: 1\n\nRich, that's the 10,000 hryvni question. It's mix and match time, baby! In some Ukrainian parishes, the only English translations for propers other than regular weekdays, the Eight Resurrectional Tones and panakhyda that anyone has access to are Ruthenian sources such as the Byzantine Seminary Press (Pittsburgh) translations or the Uniontown Basilian translations. In the UGCC there is no uniformity in usage of propers, with only some uniformity in the Eight Resurrectional Tones, weekday propers and Panakhyda. Even these have variations, for example the Eparchy of Parma has its own English Divine Liturgy book which has many propers translated in their own version. Also in Canada some parishes have their own English versions, such as St. Demetrius in Toronto and St. Elias in Brampton.\n\nThe bottom line is that there are some better English translations than the Ruthenian texts out there, you just have to look, find, and practice singing them and see what works. I have also used New Skete, Jordainville, Mother Mary/Kallistos Ware, Holy Transfiguration Monastery, St. John of Kronstadt Press, Melkite Menaion, Archbishop Raya, Isabel Hapgood and various OCA texts among others over the years in addition to the Ruthenian texts.\n\nI have found in general the UGCC Synodal English translation of the Eight Tones and weekday propers that are in the little blue pew books sings much better in the Galician chant used in the Ukrainian Catholic parishes than the Ruthenian translations of the same, which are generally meant to be sung in Prostopinje, the Carpatho-Ruthenian chant style.\n\nTo avoid boring everyone to death here you can e-mail me privately and I can go into greater length and explanation about this topic and resources that might be of interest to you. I can babble incoherently like this about this stuff for days, just ask my wife"
