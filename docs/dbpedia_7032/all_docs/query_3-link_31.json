The UOCC is based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and has the Metropolitan Cathedral (Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral (Winnipeg, Manitioba)), seminary (St. Andrew's College), and central administrative office based in that city. Also the Church has cathedrals in the cities of Saskatoon, Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, and Montreal.\n\nCurrently the Church's membership is about 10,000, and the current primate is Metropolitan John (Stinka).\n\nOrigin[]\n\nMost of the ethnic Ukrainians moving to Canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were from Western Ukraine (predominantly from two provinces: Halychyna (aka Galicia) & Bukovyna). The settlers from Halychyna were predominatly Greek Catholics, and were tended early on by the local Roman Catholic hierarchy due to the fact that the Vatican wanted to assimilate the Greek Catholics into the mainstream. As the Halychany were coming to Canada, a smaller group of settlers were arriving from Bukovyna who were predominatly Orthodox. These Orthodox were initially served by the Russian Orthodox Mission (who were part of the Church of Russia). The Russian Orthodox Mission was by then established in the northwest of North America through Alaska, and it served all the needs of the Orthodox in that area. It is also noteworthy that many native Ukrainian priests served in the Mission.\n\nBoth groups of Ukrainians desired to have a church that was truly \"Ukrainian Orthodox,\" and a church that met their spiritual and cultural needs. This led to the creation of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada (UGOCC) in July 1918, in the city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. This convention established not only the church, but a brotherhood to protect the church. The brotherhood (which had former Greek Catholics) condemned the Union of Brest-Litovsk, which had created the Greek Catholics in Ukraine.\n\nAs soon as the Church was created, the lay leaders knew that they had to find a bishop to guide the new Church. Thus, the brotherhood approached Archbishop Alexander (Nemolovsky) from the Russian Orthodox Mission in North America. Abp. Alexander was the bishop of Winnipeg at the time. He had agreed at first to become the temporary bishop of the UGOCC, but later refused due to the fact that he claimed he did not want to lead a Ukrainian Church.\n\nAbp. Alexander was to preside over the UGOCC's first Sobor (Church council; this is a clergy-laity conference, where the bishops, priests, and laity participate), but the Sobor still continued without a bishop, and was held on December 28, 1918 (which is interesting to note that it is still recorded as SOBOR I). The Sobor led to the establishment of the Church's first theological seminary in Saskatoon. Sobor II took place on November 27, 1919, with the presence of an Antiochian Metropolitan, Germanos (Shehadi) of Zahle.\n\nFormation of the Metropolitanate[]\n\nThe UOCC had strong ties to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church after 1921, when that body was established in Ukraine. In 1951, St. Mary the Protectress Cathedral (which was not in the UOCC at that time) had invited Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko) to Canada to become their church's bishop, while the Consistory of the UOCC had already invited Archbishop Michael (Khoroshy) and Bishop Platon (who reposed shortly after arriving in Canada) to come to Canada to be the Church's Metropolitan and Bishop respectively. Once the Consistory had learned of Metropolitan Ilarion's coming to Canada, they sought him out, and invited him to become Metropolitan of the UOCC. He accepted only if St. Mary the Protectress was to be accepted back into the UOCC. The Consistory agreed, and the Central and Eastern Dioceses were created with Abp. Michael heading the Eastern Diocese with its headquarters in Toronto, and Metr. Ilarion heading the Central Diocese in Winnipeg as Metropolitan.\n\nThe UOCC Today[]\n\nIn 1990, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada became a canonical church by being accepted into the Church of Constantinople. A few years later its sister church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA joined her.\n\nOn January 10, 2005, at the age of 95, Metropolitan Wasyly (Fedak) reposed, three days after the Church had celebrated Christmas (Julian calendar). His Beatitude has served in the capacity of Metropolitan and Primate for nearly twenty years. The funeral services took place on January 21 and 22 at Holy Trinity Cathedral, and many Orthodox Christians of many nationalities paid their last respects to the former Metropolitan. Eight Bishops had gathered for the funeral including His Eminence Metr. Iakovos of Chicago, who was Representative of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.\n\nIn July 2005, at the Twenty-first Sobor (XXI) of the UOCC, Archbishop John (Stinka) was elected Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of Canada. In late 2005, the Holy and Sacred Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate elected Archbishop John as the official successor to Metropolitan Wasyly (Fedak). His Eminence would be the first Canadian-born leader of the Church in her 87-year history.\n\nOn July 23, 2006, Metr. John was enthroned in Holy Trinity Cathedral by His Eminence Metropolitan Sotirios (Exarch of Canada, and representative of the Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew). Also present were their Eminences, Abps. Yurij of Toronto, and Antony of New York-Washington (UOC of USA), and His Grace Bp. Georgije (Serbian Bishop of Canada). Also present was the Chancellor of the Orthodox Church in America's Canadian Archdiocese, the Metropolitan and Metropolitan-Emeritus of the Ukrainian Catholic Church of Canada (Lawrence and Michael, respectively), and representatives of the Roman Catholic, Anglican, and United Churches of Canada.\n\nDuring a Church Council in August 2008, members came from all across the country came together to elect two new bishops, vote on a change of bylaws, and celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Church. Bishop Ilarion (Rudnyk), vicar bishop in Portugal (under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate), was elected to the Edmonton cathedra, and Bishop Andrij (Peshko), of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Western Europe, was elected to be the vicar of the Central Eparchy [1] . With the election of these two young bishops, the UOCC again restored its Council of Bishops, and a full slate of bishops for the Church. The Council was also attended by Bishop Christophoros (Vicar Bishop of the Toronto Greek Metropolis) as representative of the Patriarch, and by Archbishop Antony and Bishop Daniel of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the USA.\n\nIn October of that year, his Grace Ilarion's election was ratified by the Holy and Sacred Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and he was enthroned in the St. John the Baptist Cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta on Sunday, October 26, 2008 by his Eminence Metropolitan John [2].\n\nBishops and Eparchies[]\n\nIn Ukrainian (Slavic) Tradition, the Metropolitan is the Primate of the Church, and then followed by the eparchial Archbishops and Bishops.\n\nIn the UOCC, the Primate and Metropolitan is styled the Archbishop of Winnipeg and of the Central Eparchy, Metropolitan of Canada, while the following two eparchial bishops are always styled (Arch)bishop of Edmonton, and the Western Eparchy and the (Arch)bishop of Toronto, and the Eastern Eparchy. The Church's vicar bishop to the Metropolitan is styled: Bishop of Saskatoon, and Vicar of the Central Eparchy. Usually the church only has four bishops, but the titles of: Bishop of Montreal, and Vicar of the Eastern Eparchy, and Bishop of Vancouver, and the Vicar of the Western Eparchy are also available.\n\nThe Western Eparchy is comprised of the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, and Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories. The Central Eparchy consists of the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and Nunavut Territory. The Eastern Eparchy is comprised of the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. The church has yet to establish any parishes in the three Territories or the Maritimes (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland), although there is talk of expansion.\n\nHistorical Bishops of the UOCC[]\n\nList of bishops who have served in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada in the past:\n\nMetr.
