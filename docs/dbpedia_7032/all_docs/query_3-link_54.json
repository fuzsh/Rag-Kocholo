        "text": "Member\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Lauro,\n\nWell, we Ukies over here are really detached from the situation over there, for starters.\n\nThe UOC-KP Filaret was also involved with such \"parishioners\" in his time . . .\n\nThis came about as a result of a strong alliance between Church and State that has really always existed in Russia.\n\nOrthodox clergy in Ukraine have traditionally been markedly different with respect to support of the state.\n\nSt Dmitri of Rostov and St Paissy Velichkovsky both thought nothing of preaching against the state and the wealthy in times of war and other crises that resulted in the drastic impoverishment of the people.\n\nSt Arsenius Matsievich, Met. of Rostov, was walled up and died of neglect by the Tsarist authorities because he opposed Russian state involvement in church affairs.\n\nThe last Russian Met. of Moscow to oppose the Tsars was St Philip (in fact, of the same Ruthenian/Ukrainian family, Kolitsiv, as St Alexis).\n\nHe was ordered smothered to death for his efforts . . .\n\nBut the Church in Russia was hit by the Soviets worse than any other Church.\n\nIt has survived by its willingness to be identified with the state and its goals - just as it always has before.\n\nAlex\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 7,461\n\nLikes: 1\n\nQuote\n\nBut the Church in Russia was hit by the Soviets worse than any other Church.\n\nI'm not sure I agree with this statement. I do not recall a wholesale rounding up and assasination of clergy and hierarchs on a scale that befell the UGCC and UAOC in the 1930s and 1940s, nor the continued harassment and holocaust of believers that continued into the 1980s. Similar purges occurred in Georgia and Armenia as well.\n\nI am not trying to present a \"one-up\" of atrocities that occurred in Ukraine compared to Russia but rather am stating this as historical fact. And when discussing Ukraine the atrocities also inflicted by Tsarist repression also cannot be eliminated when discussing the last two centuries. The poetry of Taras Shevchenko attests to treatment under the Muscovites.\n\nAtrocity can not always be measured in numbers. The deep divisions in Orthodoxy in Ukraine itself is an attribute of the deep damage inflicted by Soviet interference into the ecclesiastical structure of Ukraine.\n\nI guess my point is that when it comes to religious atrocities, there are no \"winners\" but only losers and victims.\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Diak,\n\nAgreed!\n\nI was only quoting from the Ukrainian Orthodox Metropolitan Ilarion Ohienko who said the Russian church suffered more, in various terms, than any other church under the Soviets.\n\nThe Soviets, according to the report of an investigator who looked at KGB records, seem to have had the greatest hatred for their own Russian Church, perhaps because of its identification with Tsarism.\n\nThey loved nailing Russian Orthodox priests upside down and cross-wise to iconostasis doors etc.\n\nReal charmers, those . . .\n\nI would naturally say the Ukrainian Church suffered more.\n\nBut here I quote a Ukrainian Orthodox Metropolitan who was known for his strong patriotic Ukrainian perspectives.\n\nAlex"
