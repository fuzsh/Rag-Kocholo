        "text": "METROPOLITAN OF KYIV AND ALL OF UKRAINE\n\nTo His Eminence ILARION,\n\nMetropolitan of Winnipeg,\n\nPrimate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada\n\nDear Vladyka Ilarion!\n\nFrom myself personally, and from the plenitude of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, I greet you on your enthronement as the Metropolitan of Winnipeg and the Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada!\n\nFor more than a century the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has existed and been developed in Canada and is marked by many achievements. The names of such figures as Metropolitan Ilarion(Ohienko) of blessed memory are historically inscribed in golden letters. In the new era, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada continues to be a spiritual community for Orthodox Ukrainians on Canadian soil despite facing many new challenges.\n\nDear Vladyka, I sincerely bid that with God&#39;s help, you will carry out the all-important ministry as the Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada and the Archbishop of the Central Eparchy to succeed in the further growth of the Church. My hope is for the deepening of mutually beneficial cooperation between the independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada â€“ for the glory of God, for the good of Orthodoxy, and for the good of the Ukrainian people.\n\nDuring the difficult trials of the ongoing war, I entreat you, Dear Vladyka, to continue praying for the victory of truth and for a just peace for Ukraine. Herewith, I assure you of my prayers and wish you good health, spiritual and physical strength, and many blessed years of service!\n\nWith love in Christ,\n\nEpiphaniy"
