        "text": "Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Ilarion Ukrainian Orthodox Residence, 1972, 1978\n\nFoundation, 1972\n\nThe Ilarion Ukrainian Orthodox Residence for seniors in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, was founded effectively in 1972.\n\nThis came about as a consequence of a decision in that year of the Ukrainian Self-Reliance League to establish a residence for senior citizens in Saskatoon.\n\nFormal decisions, 1973\n\nOn 15 April, 1973, there was a combined meeting in Saskatoon of both Holy Trinity Cathedral and All Saints Parish, and both branches of the Ukrainian Women's Association of Canada (U.W.A.C.). At this meeting, a resolution was made to approve the project to build a senior's home for persons of the Ukrainian Orthodox Faith. This complex was intended to provide low-cost rental units.\n\nFrom that time, serious discussion and planning produced the construction of the initial stage of this project. This process required several years of work before there was visible fruit from the invisible labour.\n\nThe site chosen for this residence was 2509, Louise Street, Saskatoon, which was very near to the Parish of All Saints (in fact, directly across from the residence, on Louise Street).\n\nBefore the opening, it was decided to name the residence in honour and in memory of Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko), who had reposed in Christ in 1972.\n\nOpening, 1978\n\nOpening of Phase I, 1978\n\nOn 24 June, 1978, the Ilarion Ukrainian Orthodox Residence was opened officially. It consisted of 51 units.\n\nOn 20 August, 1978, the Board of Directors at Ilarion Residence began to investigate the possibility of building an addition to Phase I.\n\nOpening of Phase II, 1984\n\nOn 30 September, 1984, the construction of the second stage of the development was completed. The second stage consisted in a continuation of the original building, which effectively doubled the size, and made one larger building.\n\nOn 26 October, 1984, the official ceremony of opening Phase II was held.\n\nPhase II added another 51 units for senior citizen accommodation.\n\nThese units functioned and served well for many years. However, circumstances in society were changing, and other ways for meeting the needs of ageing persons were being developed. The directors of the Ilarion Ukrainian Orthodox Residence decided to work towards providing further accommodations which would provide a wider variety of means to support elderly persons in their fragility.\n\nIt was decided to name Phase III (the planning and design of which took 5 years) “Ilarion Residence/Village”. This phase added 30 Life Lease units, and 21 Assisted Living accommodations. The latter provision allowed residents to remain in their familiar residence with familiar friends for a longer period of time.\n\nThe official blessing of the beginning of Phase III took place on 27 June, 2003.\n\nOpening of Phase III, 2003\n\nThe new facility opened its doors on 25 July, 2003. The facility was opened officially on 18 September, 2003.\n\nFrom that time, the residence complex has been fulfilling its stated purposes. For some years, Metropolitan John (Stinka) was a resident after he retired from active service.\n\nEntertainment beside Phase III\n\nDescription\n\nThe Ilarion Residence and Village is a seniors' complex located in the Nutana Suburban Centre neighbourhood of Saskatoon, one block east of Market Mall shopping centre.
