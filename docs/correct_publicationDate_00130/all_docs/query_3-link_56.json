When a favorite cousin of the Imperial Princess disappeared, the princess searched through the land of the River, its ghosts and priests, giants and frightening creatures to find her cousin. But the princess wished for a hero.... and far away, a hero's journey would begin.\n\nThank you for visiting Bobbis Bookstore !!"
