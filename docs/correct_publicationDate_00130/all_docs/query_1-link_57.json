        "text": "John Adam\n\nIt is unusual for mathematicians to write in such personal terms and with such candor. Readers with any mathematical background will find this book intriguing and fascinating.\n\n John Adam, coauthor of \"Guesstimation\"\n\nAdrian Banner\n\nContaining many mathematical morsels, this decades-long correspondence tells the story of a very special student-teacher relationship. These men have taught each other more than they could ever have envisioned.\n\n Adrian Banner, author of \"The Calculus Lifesaver\"\n\nAlan Alda\n\nAs these two men find truer, deeper friendship through an exchange of letters on math, you may be surprised to find yourself, as I was, moved by powerful emotions. I never thought I'd get choked up by an equationbut these guys are plotting out the hardest kind of change to track: the movement from Me to Us.\n\nJames Tanton\n\nMathematics speaks to the transcendental, as does this extraordinary friendship. A beautiful book!\n\n James Tanton, founding director of the St. Mark's Institute of Mathematics\n\nJanna Levin\n\nSteven Strogatz has written an unpretentious, charming, original, and inspiring book. In a disarmingly personal depiction, Strogatz leads us through a story of friendship between understated mentor and virtuosic student. The mathematical excursions are as much a pleasure to read as the moving narrative of the unusual friendship that the mathematics inspires.\n\n Janna Levin, author of \"A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines\"\n\nLarry Zimmerman\n\nIn this delightfully inspired account of a thirty-year correspondence, two mathematicians discover even deeper things than theorems that are fundamental. A math book for the mind and for the heart.\n\n Larry Zimmerman, winner of the 1986 Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics Teaching\n\nBrian Greene\n\nThe Calculus of Friendship is an intriguing journey that casts mathematics in a most unusual light. Through thirty years of correspondence between student and teacher, we enter a private world where the rigors of logic are the last defense against the vagaries of life.\n\n Brian Greene, author of \"The Elegant Universe\"\n\nJohn Cleese\n\nThe gentle but unremittingly honest account of this friendship utterly absorbed me. Also, some of the calculus is hilarious.\n\nBarry Cipra\n\nThis is a lovely book. Strogatz succeeds in producing a sincere tribute to teachers, and he emphasizes in a direct way the human element of mathematics.\n\n Barry Cipra, author of \"Misteaks...and How to Find Them before the Teacher Does: A Calculus Supplement\"\n\nFrom the Publisher"
