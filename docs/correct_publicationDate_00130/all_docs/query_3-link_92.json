It's four books long and stars the likes of Benjamin Franklin, Isaac Newton, Blackbeard, and other historical chums, but with an original fantasy setting with some good twists. I've just finished the second book, A calculus of Angels, and though I didn't enjoy it as much as the first installment, I thought it was very enjoyable. Book three is on its way.\n\nAnyone else read it? If so, any thoughts?\n\nHe's an author that is spreading here by word of mouth, Bear. Fitzflagg has been a fan of his for a while, and a lot of people here are really liking his latest book, The Briar King. Here's a link to an earlier thread about it, which also mentions the Age of Unreason and has a good link to an interview with the man himself, courtesy of Fitzflagg:\n\nThe Briar King, A Review (and interview)\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHobbit\n\nI've read the first three books of the Age of Unreason, and enjoyed it quite abit. I found the third book a little weak, but, most middle books tend to be weaker. But, over all, I've really enjoyed the series, and aiming to finish the series asap.\n\nKeyoke\n\nThe furry footed Admin is correct, Keyes is a writer who deserves much recognition. Age of Unreason was a fascinating series that blened SF, Fantasy, Horror and Alternate History. A great series.\n\nAs great as that series is, he really comes into his own and boldly makes a name in The Briar King\n\nI just ordered my copy of Briar King. I'm looking forward to it.\n\nAnd it's good to see some other Keyes fans out there. I think he deserves a little more recognition.\n\nThe Briar King's a great read. I also liked the induction of semi-sci-fi elements. I haven't read anything else by Keye's but if any of his other stuff is of this caliber I certainly look forward to adding it to the list of must reads (thank god for that speed reading class).\n\nJust wondering, does anyone else use the speed reading tecniques on novels?\n\nI read his Waterborn duology a few years ago and found it quite entertaining. Definitely different than a lot of fantasy out there. Had some native American myth mixed in what with earth spirits and such.\n\nHaven't gotten around to his Age of Unreason series yet, but one of these days..."
