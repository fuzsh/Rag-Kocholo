        "text": "Greg Keyes was born in Meridian Mississippi on April 11th, 1963. His mother read to him early and often, until he learned to read. After that he read a lot, between exploring the forests of his native state and the red-rock cliffs of the Navajo Nation where his father worked for a time, Greg took advantage of public libraries and bookmobiles to keep himself entertained, reading science fiction and fact, folktales, and mythology. To his delight, he discovered that writing books was actually a job, and so he decided he should do that. He began to write tales of dinosaurs, spaceships, and fantastic inventions. He listened to the oral traditions of his family, to the stories told in the Navajo Nation -- and more than ever, to read and adventure in the physical world around him. He went to college, earned degrees in anthropology, worked as an archaeologist, travelled, played strange, violent games, learned to play music, worked as a night guard, ironed newspapers, associated with interesting people. In 1996 he managed to get the job he had been working toward when his first novel, THE WATERBORN, was published. Since that time Greg has published over thirty books, including the original series CHILDREN OF THE CHANGELING, THE AGE OF UNREASON, and THE KINGDOMS OF THORN AND BONE, as well as the stand-alone books THE HOUNDS OF ASH and FOOTSTEPS IN THE SKY He has also had the great fortune to be asked to contribute to other universes, writing books for BABYLON 5, STAR WARS, PLANET OF THE APES, PACIFIC RIM, THE ELDER SCROLLS, XCOM, INDEPENDENCE DAY and Marvel's AVENGERS, and to novelize the films INTERSTELLAR, GODZILLA KING OF THE MONSTERS and GODZILLA vs KONG. He recently scripted her first graphic novel, GODZILLA Vs. KONG: DOMINION He is currently finishing the third book in his newest trilogy, THE HIGH AND FARAWAY. He lives, writes, fences and cooks in Savannah, Georgia with his wife Nell, son John (formerly known as Archer), daughter Lilith (formerly known as Nellah), and a small pack of dogs.\n\nRead full bio"
