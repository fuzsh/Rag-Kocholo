All of his family are storytellers. He got degrees from both University of Georgia and Mississippi State University in anthropology.\n\nKeyes has a knowledge of linguistics and fencing that feature heavily in his work. One of the main characters from “Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone”, Stephen Darige is both an adept linguist and a skilled and knowledgeable fencer.\n\nKeyes also focuses on many main characters, who rarely meet each other, but help the reader follow the different threads of the story.\n\nKeyes writes fantasy and science fiction books. He is the author of the “Chosen of the Changleing” series, the “Age of Unreason” series, and the “Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone” series.\n\n“The Briar King” is the first novel in the “Kingdom of Thorn & Bone” series, which was released in the year 2002. The Kingdom of Crotheny there are two little girls playing in the tangled gardens in the city of the dead, a sacred place. While they flee from an imaginary attacker, the girls (one is the king’s reckless young daughter) find an unknown crypt of the ancestral and the legendary queen (named Virgenya Dare).\n\nIn the wilds of the forest, Aspar White (who is the king’s holter) is investigating an innocent family’s slaughter. While there, he weaves his way through all of the willows, and finds himself confronting a monstrous beast. It is one of nightmares and folk tales. At the same time, a young priest is walking on the same road, and starts learning about the nature of evil. It is found festering just below what looks to be a peaceful land.\n\nThe royal family ends up under siege, too. It faces betrayal that could have only come from sorcery. Three beautiful sisters, one young guy that is suddenly a knight, and a female that is in love with a roguish adventurer type. Against them, is the rising darkness that shows up and wrecks what used to be good, certain, and familiar. Their destinies are going to be linked as evil forces are walking the land. Crotheny has been shaken to its core. The Briar King (who is a harbinger of death) has awakened from his sleep.\n\nFans of the novel found this to have a good cast of characters, time spent on a history that is believable, the author is able to create emotional effects, and the story moves quickly. This is a first rate fantasy epic that makes the reader sit on the edge of their seat, and reading through the chapters to find out what happens next in the story.\n\n“The Charnel Prince” is the second novel in the “Kingdom of Thorn & Bone” series, which was released in the year 2004. After the Briar King woke up from his sleep, there was a season of horror and darkness that fell upon the Kingdom of Crotheny. There are many breeds of all kinds of awful monsters roaming the countryside.\n\nMadness sweeps the land and turned the once peaceful villagers into flesh eating and savage fiends. Off in Eslen, King William was just murdered, and Queen Muriele is hunted by treachery on all sides. Anne (the couple’s final surviving daughter) has just fled the assassins determined to destroy her family.\n\nRight behind the runaway princess is Neil MeqVren (a young knight) who is a trusted ally of the queen, and is sworn to get Anne back from those looking to kill her. Anne goes on a dangerous journey to get to the sanctuary of her paramour’s arms, who is far away. Along the way are the sinister agents and many hidden traps that makes up a sprawling conspiracy that very few people can hope to evade.\n\nAll the while, spies working for Praifec Hespero (who is the powerful Churchman) go on a mission to ruin the Briar King while in the heart of his own domain. The Church (power hungry and pushed on by all the mystical events) has started an inquisition, the repercussions put even the queen at risk. Intrigue’s noose tightens all over the land, and personal fates and the destiny of a kingdom are going to be determined in a conflict held between magic, malevolence, might, and virtue.\n\n“The Blood Knight” is the third novel in the “Kingdom of Thorn & Bone” series, which was released in the year 2006. Poorly comprehended and half remembered prophecies appear to point to Anne Dare (young princess and rightful heir to Crotheny’s throne) as the only hope this world has. Yet Anne is hunted by Robert the usurper and his minions. His return from the grave has opened up a doorway that allows sinister sorcerers have come into the world.\n\nEven though Anne herself is a conduit of amazing powers beyond anything she can control or even understand. This girl has to become a woman, and this princess to become a queen. Anne has to quit running, and start marching at the head of her army to get back her kingdom. Or die trying.\n\nThere is a mysterious assassin that stalks her, who is so skilled in dessrata (a deadly fencing style), so much so that even Cazio (Anne’s protector and friend) is unable to stand against him. Neither is Neil MeqVren, Anne’s sworn defender. And Cazio is a master of the form.\n\nHer other companions cannot help her either. There is Aspar White, who is the royal holter and has an enchanted arrow that is able to fell the Briar King. Stephen Darige, who is the monk that blew the horn that awoke Briar King to begin with. All while the separate paths they take push them deeper into the deadly maze of magic and myth where return may not be a possibility.\n\nAt the same time, Queen Muriele is a captive of the fake king. She only has a crippled musician as an ally (another prisoner), as well as a serving woman that is somehow more and less than she seems to be. She is going to find herself a pawn in the Robert’s schemes for conquering. Not to mention a weapon to be used against Anne, her daughter."
