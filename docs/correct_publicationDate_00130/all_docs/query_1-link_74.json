This reading group is designed especially for those interested in mathematics and science and how they affect our lives. No prior math or science background is necessary.\n\nNext Up\n\nA discussion of\n\nA Russian Childhood\n\nby Sofya Kovalevskaya\n\nHosted by Ingrid Daubechies\n\nMonday, August 5\n\n6:30 pm to 7:30 pm ET\n\n(online)\n\nJoin MoMath's Distinguished Visiting Professor Ingrid Daubechies for an engaging conversation about the book, A Russian Childhood by Sofya Kovalevskaya.\n\nIn the year 1889, Sofya Vasilievna Kovalevskaya, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Stockholm, published her recollections of growing up in mid-nineteenth century Russia. Professor Kovalevskaya was already an international celebrity, and partly for the wrong reasons: less as the distinguished mathematician she actually was than as a \"mathematical lady\" — a bizarre but fascinating phenomenon.\n\n_____________\n\nLooking for the MoMath book club designed specially for tweens and teens (ages 10–17)?
