        "text": "American novelist\n\nGregory Keyes (born April 11, 1963)[1] is an American writer of science fiction and fantasy who has written both original and media-related novels under both the names J. Gregory Keyes and Greg Keyes.\n\nEarly life[edit]\n\nKeyes was born in Meridian, Mississippi, as John Gregory Keyes.[2] He received degrees in anthropology from Mississippi State University and the University of Georgia before becoming a full-time writer.\n\nWriting career[edit]\n\nHe is famous for his tetralogy The Age of Unreason, a steampunk/alchemical story featuring Benjamin Franklin and Isaac Newton. He wrote the Babylon 5 Psi Corps trilogy, a history of the Psi Corps and a biography of Psi Corps member Alfred Bester.\n\nIn 2003 he began a fantasy series titled The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone, the first volume of which was The Briar King. The second book in the series The Charnel Prince was published in 2004 and the third, The Blood Knight, was published in July 2006. His fourth and final book of the quartet, The Born Queen, was released in March 2008.\n\nIn 2009 it was announced that Keyes would be writing two novels based on the successful computer game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The first of these, The Infernal City, was published by Random House in November 2009.[3] The second, Lord of Souls, went on sale on September 27, 2011.[4]\n\nStyle[edit]\n\nGreg Keyes builds his stories around multiple main characters who meet only rarely, but allow the reader to follow different threads of the same events. Most of the chapters in his books focus on one of the main characters. Chapters often end in a surprise or a cliffhanger as the story moves to follow another character.\n\nKeyes's knowledge of fencing and linguistics also figures heavily in his books. For example, Stephen Darige, one of the main characters in The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone, is an adept linguist, and his knowledge and skills play an important role in the development of the story.\n\nWorks[edit]\n\nChosen of the Changeling[edit]\n\nThe Waterborn (1996), ISBN 0-345-40393-2\n\nThe Blackgod (1997), ISBN 0-345-40394-0\n\nThe Age of Unreason[edit]\n\nNewton's Cannon (1998), ISBN 1-56865-829-X\n\nA Calculus of Angels (1999), ISBN 0-7394-0260-9\n\nEmpire of Unreason (2000), ISBN 0-345-40609-5\n\nThe Shadows of God (2001), ISBN 0-345-43904-X\n\nBabylon 5: The Psi Corps Trilogy[edit]\n\nDark Genesis: The Birth of the Psi Corps (1998), ISBN 0-345-42715-7\n\nDeadly Relations: Bester Ascendant (1999), ISBN 0-345-42716-5\n\nFinal Reckoning: The Fate of Bester (1999), ISBN 0-345-42717-3\n\nStar Wars: The New Jedi Order[edit]\n\nEdge of Victory I: Conquest (2001), ISBN 0-345-42864-1\n\nEdge of Victory II: Rebirth (2001), ISBN 0-345-44610-0\n\n\"Emissary of the Void\" (2002), short story published in Star Wars Gamer, issues 8-10, and Star Wars Insider, issues 62-64\n\nThe Final Prophecy (2003), ISBN 0-345-42875-7\n\nThe Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone[edit]\n\nThe Briar King (2003), ISBN 0-345-44066-8\n\nThe Charnel Prince (2004), ISBN 0-345-44067-6\n\nThe Blood Knight (2006), ISBN 0-345-44068-4\n\nThe Born Queen (2008), ISBN 0-345-44069-2\n\nThe Elder Scrolls[edit]\n\nThe Infernal City (2009), ISBN 978-0-345-50801-0 - based on The Elder Scrolls video game series\n\nLord of Souls (2011), ISBN 978-0-345-50802-7 - based on The Elder Scrolls video game series\n\nThe High and Faraway Series[edit]\n\nThe Reign of the Departed (2018), ISBN 1-543680-30-5\n\nKingdoms of the Cursed (2019), ISBN 1-597809-95-0\n\nThe Realm of the Deathless (2022)\n\nOther[edit]\n\nThe Hounds of Ash: and Other Tales of Fool Wolf (2008), ISBN 1-894063-09-0\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes: Firestorm (2014), ISBN 978-1783292257\n\nXCOM 2: Resurrection (2015), ISBN 978-1608877126\n\nInterstellar: The Movie Novelization (2014), ISBN 978-1783293698\n\nIndependence Day: Crucible (2016), ISBN 978-1785651304\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes: Revelations (2016), ISBN 978-1785654725\n\nPlanet of the Apes: Caesar's Story (2018), ISBN 978-0316485395\n\nGodzilla: King Of The Monsters - The Movie Novelization (2019)\n\nMarvel's Avengers: The Extinction Key (2020)\n\nGodzilla: Dominion (2021)\n\nGodzilla vs. Kong: The Movie Novelization (2021)\n\n[edit]\n\nJ.
