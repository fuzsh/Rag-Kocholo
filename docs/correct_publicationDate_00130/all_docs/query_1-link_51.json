        "text": "I'm looking for a calculus book that (1) is comprehensive and rigorous enough for Calculus I-III (but pre-Spivak/Apostol in terms of rigor -- they can come later perhaps) (2) has only a small number of exercises (say, about 10 per section, where a section is along the lines of a section in the standard brick textbooks of Stewart/Anton/etc.).\n\nEvery so often I attempt a cover-to-cover completion of a calculus book but end up getting bogged down in tedious, repetitious exercises whose answers I get right. Even supposedly pared-down books -- e.g., Stewart's ESSENTIAL CALCULUS -- have way too many exercises.\n\nNow, you may wonder why I can't take one of the standard books and focus on, say, only the odd-numbered exercises. I've tried that. There's still too much tedium and repetition. I come away thinking I could've learned just as much with a tiny set of well-chosen exercises. As for other schemes, I really don't want to spend half my time examining dozens and dozens of exercises just to pick out a custom exercise set.\n\nHelp.\n\nEdit: I just discovered that Serge Lang has a book called CALCULUS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES. I wrote off Lang's A FIRST COURSE IN CALCULUS because it's weak on Calc III and may not even be all that comprehensive for Calc I and Calc II -- but, on the other hand, it seems to have just the right number of exercises for my needs. Does anyone have any comments on using these two books for Calc I-III? Are there better alternatives? (I don't mind if it's not the same author for Calc I+II and Calc III.)"
