        "text": "Infinite Powers: The story of calculus\n\nMonday, June 13 at 8:00 pm ET (New York)\n\n(in person/online)\n\nEveryone has heard of calculus, but why is it so important? Join MoMath’s Distinguished Visiting Professor for the Public Dissemination of Mathematics, Dr. Steven Strogatz, as he illuminates the fantastic idea at the heart of calculus. With the help of pictures and stories, he’ll trace where calculus came from and then show how it — in partnership with medicine, philosophy, science, and technology — reshaped the course of civilization and helped make the world modern. Everyone is welcome to attend, whether you’ve taken calculus or not, and whether you like math or not. By the end of the evening, you’ll understand how calculus can be viewed as one of the greatest triumphs of human creativity. MoMath is grateful to the Simons Foundation for its support of the Distinguished Visiting Professor program.\n\nYou can join this event in person at the Museum (11 East 26th Street) — or online by participating in a live-streamed broadcast of the event.\n\nRegistration closed."
