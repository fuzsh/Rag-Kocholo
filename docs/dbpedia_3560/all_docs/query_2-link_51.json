        "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - Cold temperatures can be dangerous, especially for the unhoused community.\n\nVersailles Police say a man was found unresponsive in a vacant home on Macey Avenue. They were later pronounced dead. It’s too early to say if this death was weather-related. Police believe the man was homeless.\n\n“There’s a lot going on in our community. We did have a fatality,” said Woodford County Judge Executive James Kay.\n\nKay says he wants people to know the Woodford County Senior Center is open as a warming center.\n\n“Both the library, our courthouse is open, there are other public buildings, Fallen Springs is open those sorts of things,” said Kay.\n\nGinny Ramsey is the Director of the Catholic Action Center. Lexington Police say one person was found dead on Newtown Pike Tuesday afternoon. Ramsey says this person was unhoused. The Fayette County Coroner’s Office was not able to confirm this or the cause of death.\n\n“It’s devastating because we know that it doesn’t have to happen. And it but it does happen. We go through this every winter and even in the summer when it’s too hot. But they’re human beings. They’re God’s children. They’re our brothers and sisters,” said Director of the Catholic Action Center, Ginny Ramsey. “This weather is bad. And you know, we’re fearful that there’ll be more found.”\n\nThe Catholic Action Center and other groups, like the Lexington Rescue Mission, are working to keep unhoused people safe and warm.\n\n“Deaths from being on the street are entirely preventable by going into shelter. And so it’s heartbreaking when we hear that there’s people who are really facing the effects of being out in the elements,” said Executive Director of the Lexington Rescue Mission, Laura Carr. “We’re going to do everything we can do to get them into shelter, convince them to go into shelter. It’s you know, it’s not always easy for people to get that help and or to seek that help. But it’s critical, and it’s life-saving.”\n\n“We all are responsible for those folks who are on the streets. And we all can come up with solutions, whether it be opening churches, which was the original Catholic Worker request back in the 30s. And that’s what we’re based on,” said Ramsey.\n\nThe Catholic Action Center says they still need lots of supplies. Specifically, they’re asking for heavy socks, gloves, long underwear, sleeping bags, hand warmers, sandwiches, and gas cards.

They’re asking for hoodies and coats sizes extra large and above so people can layer them for warmth."
