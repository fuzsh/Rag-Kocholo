You can fill out an RA (research assistant) application (for PSY 394 credit or to volunteer) at any time. Interviews are invited mid-semester in the Spring for the following academic year. Undergraduates interested in pursuing an honors thesis (PSY 495 / 496) with the FAD Lab in their senior year should discuss the possibility with me no later than 2nd semester of their junior year.\n\nAre you looking for me to write you a letter of recommendation or provide a reference for you? Please complete this inquiry form for a reference!\n\n***NOTE: the Minnesota-Texas Adoption Research Project (MTARP): In 2022-2023, the original PIs of MTARP, Dr. Harold Grotevant (UMass Amherst) and Dr. Ruth McRoy (UT Austin, Boston College) moved into well-deserved retirement. They named me to serve as the next PI for the project and host the MTARP data set here at UK. This arrangement makes it possible for researchers to continue to work with MTARP data now and into the future. Please contact me with any questions and ideas!\n\n**********************************************************************************************************************************\n\nIn directing the FAD Lab (Families, Adoption, and Diversity) here at UK as part of the Developmental Psychology area, I conduct mixed method (i.e., qualitative and quantitative) research related to diverse family systems and issues of adoption through the lenses of Developmental and Community Psychology, with particular interest in child development, parenting, family functioning, and intersectionality of identities. I primarily study adoptive families and families headed by LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) parents. I'm also interested in how issues of race (e.g., transracial adoption), gender, and birth family contact are relevant in adoptive families. Given the intersections of this area of research with public policy, practice, and law, it is exciting that some of our findings have been influential in media circles, public debates, and legal and policy domains.\n\nSee some of the publications, media mentions, and amicus briefs citations below for more information! Consider watching these brief videos about my work in adoption (with PDF) and LGBTQ+ families for overviews!\n\nWe have several key research projects currently ongoing, as well as others not listed here! See some of our publications from these and other projects in tab below. To read more about the studies we're conducting in the FAD Lab, visit our CURRENT PROJECT website.\n\n1. The Contemporary Adoptive Families Study (CAFS): For over 15 years, I have been conducting a longitudinal study of adoptive families headed by lesbian, gay, and heterosexual parents in the U.S. We have data collected from two time points: when children were preschoolers, as well as when they were in middle childhood (elementary school-age). We are now following up with families to collect data for a third wave, as children are now in adolescence! (*Funded by the William T. Grant Foundation, the APF Placek Grant, and the UCLA Williams Institute)\n\n2. Queer Parent and Adolescent Lives (Q-PAL): Building from qualitative data collected in SELFY (see next), Q-PAL is a survey-based project to learn more about the experiences of racially, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse adolescents (12-18 years old) with at least one LGBTQ+ parent and LGBTQ+ parents with at least one adolescent child in the U.S. (*Funded by the William T. Grant Foundation and the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues)\n\n3. Stories & Experiences of LGBTQ+ Families from Youth (SELFY): Early in 2020, we finished collecting interview data from racially and socioeconomically diverse adolescents (especially those who live in the South, Midwest, and Mountain West of the U.S.) with LGBTQ+ parents about their intersectional experiences of identity (e.g., race, class, adoption, parents’ sexual orientation) and discrimination. Through thematic and content analyses, we are exploring feelings about relationships with family and friends, as well as positive identity development, coping behaviors, and perceptions of community and support resources. (*Funded by the William T. Grant Foundation)\n\n4. The Experiences of Queer Parents with Infants in the NICU (NICQu): With colleagues in Social Work (Dr. Aubrey Jones), Fine Arts (Dr. Olivia Yinger), Medicine (Dr. Keisa Fallin-Bennett), we are exploring the experiences of LGBTQ+ parents who have had an infant in the NICU through a mixed method, community-based action research (CBAR) approach. (*Funded by UK's Center for Health Equity Transformation and Center for Clinical and Translational Science)\n\n5. The Birth Family Project: We are interested in the experiences and well-being of birth family members connected to adoptive families (who may or may not have current contact with other another). As research has often focused on the perspectives of individuals who are adopted and their adoptive parents, it is so important to hear the stories of birth parents and birth relatives! We finished data collection (interviews and surveys) and are now working on analyses and manuscript writing based on this project. (*Funded by the Family Process Institute)\n\n6. Children's Attitudes about Diversity (CAD) Project: In collaboration with Dr. Christia Brown (Psychology, UK) and Dr. Jazmin Brown-Iannuzzi (Psychology, UVA), we explored elementary school-age children’s attitudes about diverse families, such as those formed through adoption, with same-gender parents, and who are multiracial. We have two rounds of data collection for which we are conducting analyses and writing up reports for publication.\n\nBooks for children about LGBTQ+ topics:\n\nDaddy, Papa, and Me by Lesléa Newman, illustrated by Carol Thompson\n\nRhythmic text and illustrations with universal appeal show a toddler spending the day with their daddies.

A flower or a shooting star? At school, though, they must endure inquisitive looks and difficult questions from the other children, and they have trouble finding friends who will accept them for who they are. But they find comfort in the loving arms of their mother, who always offers them the same loving refrain: “whatever you dream of / I believe you can be / from the stars in the sky to the fish in the sea.” In this captivating book about gender, identity, and the acceptance of the differences between us, Miu Lan faces many questions about who they are and who they may be.

It tells the story of Jeremiah Nebula ― a Black boy who loves pink things. Jeremiah Nebula longs to travel to Mars where he thinks he will find people and things that accept him rather than shame or alienation for being different from other young Black boys in his life.

Followed up by Totally Joe.\n\nGreat for: Tween (ages 9–12), Teen (ages 13–14)\n\nAs the Crow Flies by Melanie Gillman\n\nThirteen-year-old Charlie experiences isolation resulting from racist and homophobic bullying while at an all-girls’ Christian camp. This 2018 Stonewall Award Honor-winning graphic novel sensitively explores issues around race, faith, feminism, and girls’ friendships. For ages 12 and up.\n\nAnger Is a Gift by Mark Oshiro\n\nA high school boy falls in love with an undocumented immigrant in this timely and thought-provoking novel. Sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity are all portrayed against a backdrop of police violence and social injustice in an inner-city Oakland setting.

But when an email falls into the wrong hands, his secret is at risk of being thrust into the spotlight. Now change-averse Simon has to find a way to step out of his comfort zone before he’s pushed out — without alienating his friends, compromising himself, or fumbling a shot at happiness with the most confusing, adorable guy he’s never met. Incredibly funny and poignant, this twenty-first-century coming-of-age, coming out story — wrapped in a geek romance — is a knockout of a debut novel by Becky Albertalli. For ages 12–18.\n\nHistory is All You Left Me by Adam Silvera\n\nWhen Griffin’s first love and ex-boyfriend, Theo, dies in a drowning accident, his universe implodes. Even though Theo had moved to California for college and started seeing Jackson, Griffin never doubted Theo would come back to him when the time was right. But now, the future he’s been imagining for himself has gone far off course. To make things worse, the only person who truly understands his heartache is Jackson. But no matter how much they open up to each other, Griffin’s downward spiral continues. If Griffin is ever to rebuild his future, he must first confront his history, every last heartbreaking piece in the puzzle of his life. For ages 14 and up.\n\nLet’s Talk About Love by Claire Kann\n\nAlice had her whole summer planned. Nonstop all-you-can-eat buffets while marathoning her favorite TV shows (best friends totally included) with the smallest dash of adulting―working at the library to pay her share of the rent. The only thing missing from her perfect plan? Her girlfriend (who ended things when Alice confessed she’s asexual). Alice is done with dating―no thank you, do not pass go, stick a fork in her, done. But then Alice meets Takumi and she can’t stop thinking about him or the rom com-grade romance feels she did not ask for (uncertainty, butterflies, and swoons, oh my!). When her blissful summer takes an unexpected turn and Takumi becomes her knight with a shiny library-employee badge (close enough), Alice has to decide if she’s willing to risk their friendship for a love that might not be reciprocated―or understood. For ages 13 and up.\n\nSelected Publications:\n\n*student co-author; 1joint first author\n\nYinger, O. S., Jones, A. E., Fallin-Bennett, K., *Gibbs, C. R., & Farr, R. H. (2024).
