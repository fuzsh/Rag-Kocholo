Joan incorporates a potpourri of decorative stitches for highly textured and mitered effects, as well as layered and three dimensional motifs. Her desire to make stitchery a pleasurable experience for the consumer led to what she refers to as ‘The Art of the Chart’ or the creation of some of the most user-friendly charts and instructions available.\n\nThroughout her 40-year career Joan has demonstrated the knack of ‘designing for trends in the marketplace’ and the ability to tailor her designs to a wide variety of styles and skill levels.

She began college at Trinity University in San Antonio, but unwisely (in retrospect) and much to the horror of her parents, transferred the next year to TCU in Fort Worth to be with the man to whom she was pinned. There she took a mix of government, history, and sociology courses along with the usual requirements. At the insistence of her mother, who feared that she'd never get a job if the soon-to-be-acquired husband left her, she also earned a teaching certificate.\n\nSusan completed her B.A. in 1964. She accepted a teaching assistantship in the Government department and pursued the M.A., writing her thesis in political philosophy: CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE: THOREAU, GANDHI, AND KING. The M.A. was conferred in 1967.\n\nHer professional teaching career began in 1965 at Weatherford Junior College, Weatherford, Texas, teaching American politics and Texas politics. (By Texas law, all public colleges and universities were required to teach (and require) one course in the U.S. Constitution and one on the Texas Constitution. Such schools usually (always?) rolled the respective constitutions into a more general politics course. The Wikipedia entry on this college is interesting enough to recommend. She also taught WOCs at the helicopter base in nearby Mineral Wells, Texas.\n\nAs Susan began reading more of the professional political science literature after her M.A. had been conferred, she realized that there was a whole new area about which she had learned little -- political behavior. Faced with difficulties in translating the new quantitative research, she decided that she needed to pursue a more advanced degree that would include attention to this strange new world and still let her continue her interests in the philosophies and institutions of governance. She enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Iowa where she was granted fellowships both in teaching and research, and summer work in journal editing. She took comprehensive exams in American politics, methodology, political philosophy, and comparative politics. Her Ph.D. thesis was \"Party Identification and Voter Stability in the United States and West Germany.\" The Ph.D. was conferred in 1974.\n\nSusan accepted a tenure-track position at Miami University for the fall of 1973 that continued until her retirement January 1, 2007. She taught Introduction to American Politics, Public Opinion and Political Behavior, Research Methods and Data Analysis (both undergraduate and graduate), Party Politics, Women in Politics, a seminar on Religion in Politics, and Introduction to Women's Studies. In the early 1990s, she began to refurbish the comp exam area on Comparative Politics, studying EU and European politics with a specialist in the field, and valiantly attempting to learn enough French to get by. She then was a Core Professor at Miami University's Dolibois European Center in Luxembourg -- teaching Comparative Political Behavior one term and EU Structure and Politics another, as well as planning and leading field study tours.

He more or less grew up in southwestern Pennsylvania with a sojourn in northern New Jersey with his parents and two brothers for several years. He enrolled at Allegheny College somewhat reluctantly, mostly because his uncle had gone there; Momeyer would have preferred working as a machinist apprentice at $2.50/hr in 1960 and preaching the gospel on the side. But Allegheny proved transformative, with teachers who took a very earnest but full-of-himself young person seriously and challenged him to be more than he thought he could be, to be more aware of the world's complexity and reflective about how to be in the world. A semester at Fisk University further opened his eyes to the depth of racism and resistance to change human beings were capable of and, along with the study of philosophy, dissuaded him from the illusions of religion. The rather surprising and unlikely offer of a generous fellowship for graduate study took Momeyer to the University of Chicago after graduating from Allegheny and a summer working as a field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). There he suffered the indignities regularly inflicted upon graduate students, perhaps most especially in the Philosophy department at that time, before moving on to the University of Washington to complete a Ph.D. in 1969. For 44 years, more or less, he taught philosophy at Miami University. \"More or less\" because for approximately eight of those years he was absent from Miami doing research or teaching elsewhere and another three spent at Miami on a project to \"reinvent\" the Honors Program. Fully retiring in December 2012, Momeyer was motivated still again to reflect on how life might have meaning when productive labor was no longer a central part of one's life.\n\nMoon, Melanie\n\nMelanie Moon was born and raised in Cincinnati, OH.
