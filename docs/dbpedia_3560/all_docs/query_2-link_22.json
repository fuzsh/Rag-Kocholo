        "text": "WOODFORD CO., Ky. (WKYT) - For nine months, Captain Logan Forrest was deployed in the Middle East. He was welcomed home by his family and community at the end of May. It was just a little over a month later, when a family vacation turned tragic.\n\n“It’s unimaginable. I can’t imagine what they’re going through. But what I can share from talking to Logan is his strength, and his trust is in God,” said Woodford County Judge-Executive, James Kay.\n\nWhile on a hike in Gatlinburg on July 3rd, Logan’s three-year-old daughter Emerson “Emmie” Forrest slipped on a rock. Logan tried to catch her, but both fell down a 30-foot cliff, and they were both left unconscious. Among many injuries, Logan had two broken ribs, and a fractured skull.\n\nEmmie suffered damage to her brain. She’s now starting to wake up, something family friend, and county Judge-Executive James Kay, calls miraculous.\n\n“They’re living a normal life, but they’ve had some extraordinary circumstances. And they’ve really, really been dealt some difficult challenges hopefully our community can help them overcome at least a little bit.”\n\nWe spoke to Logan and his wife Taylor over the phone while they’re at the hospital in Tennessee. They said they truly believe in the power of prayer. And they’ve felt all of the prayers and well wishes coming from the Woodford County community.\n\n“Logan knows that the best thing our community does is wrap around families who are struggling, experiencing difficulty, or trouble. I wasn’t surprised at all by the outpouring of support.”\n\nEmmie has a long road ahead of her, but an even larger family cheering her on back home.\n\nYou can keep up with Emmie’s recovery by following along on her family’s Facebook, at the link here."
