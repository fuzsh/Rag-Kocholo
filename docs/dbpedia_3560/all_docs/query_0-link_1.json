        "text": "The Department of Political Science is pleased to be able to offer a variety of internship opportunities to students. Internships allow students to gain first-hand experience that relate to their academic preparation for work settings. Students also often discover new areas of interest, make valuable connections, and receive job offers at the conclusion of their internships. Graduating Political Science majors, when asked about the highlight of their academic experiences at UK, they commonly single out their internships as the most-enriching experiences they have had. We encourage bright and ambitious Political Science majors to plan their studies so that they can fit internships into their curriculum.\n\nThere are a variety of internship opportunities for Political Science students. Students often volunteer or take jobs with elected officials, government agencies, political campaigns, non-profit or nonpartisan organizations, law firms, and the like. We also offer more structured programs in Frankfort and Washington, D.C. See the menus below to learn more about the primary paths to pursue internships, some recent opportunities that have come across our desks (Summer Tab; Local, Regional, and Remote Opportunities tab), and a list of previous internship placements (Internship Placements Tab) to get an idea of the type of Political Science internships available.\n\nPath 1: Kentucky Legislative Internship Program (KLIP)\n\nThe Department of Political Science conducts the Kentucky Legislative Internship Program (KLIP) every spring semester to align with the Commonwealth's legislative sessions in the Kentucky General Assembly. This comprehensive legislative boot camp can serve as the culminating experience of a Political Science major's studies, or it can be a great launching point for students earlier in their academic careers who intend to continue their study of the political process or to go on to additional political work at the national level.\n\nWhat is it? KLIP gives UK undergraduates a comprehensive experiential education related to the legislative process, with a focus on Kentucky state politics, by combining extensive hands-on experience in the Kentucky General Assembly (assisting an individual legislator) with intensive academic exploration of the scholarly literature relevant to their internships (by enrolling simultaneously in relevant Department of Political Science courses). Interns also periodically gather with their cohorts to share advice and experiences.\n\nNote that the Commonwealth’s legislature has both long (no more than 60 legislative days in even-numbered years) and short (no more than 30 legislative days in odd-numbered years) sessions that meet each spring. KLIP varies in a manner consistent with these long and short sessions.\n\nStudent requirements and recommendations for KLIP include:\n\nEnroll in 3 credit hours (odd years) or 6 credit hours (even years) of PS 399 Internship. Students must be able to work in Frankfort all day on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as well as on Wednesday afternoons.\n\n[Even years only] Enroll in a special seminar for interns (PS 492), worth 1 credit hour, taught either on campus or in Frankfort.\n\n[Even years only] Enroll in PS 476G Legislative Process, PS 557 Kentucky Government and Politics, or PS 458 State & Local Government, taught on campus MWF mornings and worth 3 credit hours (although students who have already taken the course still may be allowed to participate). The department will make every effort to offer one of these three courses every even-numbered spring semester. Students can still participate in KLIP even if these courses are not offered.\n\nStudents wishing for more than the required credits may sign up for additional course work as long as doing so does not conflict with the internship obligations.\n\nWho can apply? You must be a Political Science major/minor or a pre-law student in good standing. You must have completed 9 hours of Political Science (or other relevant) course work before the spring semester in which you wish to intern. Entrance into the program is competitive, and selection of legislative interns will be based on academic record, relevant experience, and perceived ability to perform as an intern.\n\nWhen do you apply? Each fall the Department of Political Science will put out a call for applications.\n\nApplications for spring 2024 are due on October 31. Apply for spring 2024 here.\n\nPath 2: WilDCats at the Capitol and Washington, D.C. Internships\n\nWilDCats at the Capitol\n\nWilDCats at the Capitol is an internship program for students wishing to work in Washington, D.C. It is a collaborative program between the UK President’s Office, Student Government, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Department of Political Science. The program allows students to intern for a full semester (fall or spring terms) or during the summer.\n\nWatch the video below for a description of this opportunity:\n\nFor more information and to apply, visit the WilDCats at the Capitol page here.\n\nOther Internship Opportunities in Washington, D.C.\n\nAlthough WilDCats at the Capitol works to place students in internships, students who find their own internship in Washington, D.C. are also eligible to participate in the program. And, some internships, like those with government agencies, require students to apply independently of their internship programs and far in advance. Here are some resources for students interested in finding their own internship or applying for internships, then in the next section, we include more details about applying for internships in the federal government.\n\nLog into Handshake and search for positions that are specifically posted for UK students and alumni. Handshake is exclusive to UK students and is the preferred online job resource for employers specifically seeking UK students. The Career Center posts internships and jobs (local, national, and global), upcoming events, employer info sessions, and more.\n\nGlassdoor is an online job board linking you to thousands of jobs. You can research companies, employee reviews, use a personalized salary tool, etc.\n\nLinkedIn is a social network that focuses on professional networking and career development. You can use LinkedIn to display your resume, search for jobs, and enhance your professional reputation by posting updates and interacting with other people.\n\nGoinGlobal is a database that contains country-specific career and employment resources for more than 80 locations. You can use job searching resources, learn about work permits/visa regulations, resume guidelines, interview tips, etc.\n\nCollege of Saint Benedict/Saint John’s University maintains a list of internship postings in Washington, D.C. here.\n\nFor Internships in International Relations & Foreign Policy, Dr. Meredith Loken from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst has compiled a hyper-linked list of 109 organizations that have paid and unpaid internship programs. Check out all the available opportunities here.\n\nOther organizations in Washington with recuring internship opportunities include:\n\nThe National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) hires undergraduate and graduate students for semester long internships throughout the year.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) regularly hires interns in their Washington, D.C. office (as well as offices in New York City and San Francisco). ACLU internships are often paid. You can view their internships here.\n\nThe Center for International Policy has a paid internship program.\n\nThe Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA) regularly seeks interns.\n\nNational Women's Law Center (NWLC) offers year-round academic credit internship program and a paid summer internship program. NWLC offers stipends in the amount of $100 per month, not to exceed $600, for the length of the internship to defray the cost of food and transportation to interns who are receiving college/university credit.\n\nThe Hill has a very active internship program that covers our editorial and creative departments.\n\nInternships in the Federal Government\n\nSome of the best internships in Washington, D.C. are in the federal government. Often times, students must apply for these internships independently. Although we regularly place our interns in congressional offices, we cannot typically place students in government agencies. They require a separate applications submitted far in advance. Students who want an internship with a federal agency typically must plan a year in advance.\n\nThe Congressional Research Services developed a report to help students navigate this process. They summarize their report in this way: \"Although there are many opportunities in the federal government for internships, fellowships, and other work experience, there is no comprehensive source to assist in locating these opportunities. This report describes internet resources for prominent and popular opportunities for internship, fellowship, and work experience programs within the federal government. The report is intended as a selective guide for students of all levels: high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate. It provides information on legislative, executive, and judicial branch opportunities and links to several aggregators of jobs data. The introduction provides a number of insights to assist applicants on understanding terminology, timing applications, and expectations for types of work involved.\" You can access a copy of the report here.\n\nIn addition to this very useful report, below are links to federal government internship programs that are popular among our students.\n\nU.S. Department of State Student Internship Program.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Internship Program.\n\nSupreme Court Internship Program.\n\nCongressional Budget Office Internship Program.\n\nThe United States Attorney's Office has several student programs for which recruiting is done each semester.\n\nUSA Jobs often posts internship opportunities. You can search by key words or type in \"internships\" to see a range of opportunities are currently available.\n\nDiversity Opportunities in Washington, D.C.\n\nWe would also like to bring your attention to a number of diversity opportunities featured in the Congressional Research Services report. Many of these are paid opportunities.\n\nAsian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies: The Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies (APAICS)offers internship and fellowship opportunities for Asian Pacific Americans to encourage participation in the political process.

Each semester, many of our students earn internship credit by working on political campaigns, local government agencies, non-profits, and law offices. These are enriching experiences, and we are delighted when our students earn credit towards their degree with this type of work.\n\nWatch the video below for an example of the experiences our students find with these types of internships.\n\nSimply working at a job, even a professionally enriching job, does not necessarily contribute to a liberal-arts education. On-site supervisors can teach the skills needed to carry out necessary tasks, but there is no guarantee supervisors will encourage interns to look beyond the job at hand and consider how it fits within the student's overall academic curriculum.\n\nOur internship course, PS 399 (sample syllabus here), provides students with an opportunity to embed early work experiences within the liberal-arts education they are pursuing. To earn credit, students not only must serve in a job with some connection to Political Science, they also must read a modest amount of social-science scholarship related to the internship. They communicate regularly with the Internship Director or another Faculty Sponsor within the Department of Political Science – sometimes to seek advice or guidance, sometimes just to share their progress, but always with the expectation that they will show they are thinking abstractly or scientifically about the job and its techniques. Finally, they write reflective papers connecting their job(s) to the scholarly readings. Thus, in addition to (1) exhibiting the skills learned on the job and (2) documenting that they have gained abstract knowledge about the topical area in which they are working, the course has a third beneficial outcome, which is that students (3) show that, as professionals, they can perform a job successfully yet still think critically about the work they are performing.\n\nStep 1: Finding the Internship. The Department of Political Science typically lacks the resources to find internships for undergraduates (aside from the research internships that students sometimes coordinate with our own faculty, as explained below). Students who wish to enroll in PS 399 first must line up work that will qualify under the program. Discretion ultimately rests with the Internship Director, but in general, the student’s employment must include substantial exposure to political, governmental, or legal institutions, and much of the work must involve some level of learning or individual discretion (rather than, for example, simply photocopying, stapling and/or delivering documents). Students receiving internship credit usually take paid or unpaid employment with one of the following:\n\nGovernment agencies (whether local, state, or federal, including legislative staff)\n\nPolitical parties or campaign organizations\n\nInterest groups or other policy-related organizations (e.g., non-profit research)\n\nJudicial institutions (whether local, state, or federal)\n\nLaw firms and other legal organizations (e.g. county attorney’s office)\n\nThe news media if primarily writing on government or politics\n\nIf you’re unsure of where to start your internship search, visit Handshake to search internships available for University of Kentucky students. Students should also review the weekly Political Science newsletter for internship opportunities. All opportunities that come to the department are announced in the newsletter. There are also a number of reoccurring opportunities listed above in the Local, Regional, and Remote Opportunities section.\n\nStep 2: Contact the Internship Director. Prior to formal approval of the internship (step 3 below), students should contact the Internship Director, Dr. Stephen Voss, at dsvoss@uky.edu to provide initial information about the potential internship. Students should answer the following questions in their email:\n\nWhat are the start and end dates of your internship?\n\nWhat is the name of the organization you will be interning for?\n\nWhat will your duties be in your internship and, briefly, describe how the work will connect to the Political Science major?\n\nHow many hours a week will you average at your internship?\n\nHow many hours total will you work during the semester?\n\nWhat is the name and contact for your supervisor?\n\nThe Internship Director will use this information to determine if your internship is eligible for political science credit and how many credit hours you can earn for your internship.\n\nOnce the Internship Director has approved the student’s proposal, s/he will provide an override that allows the student to enroll in PS399. Once you are granted an override to enroll in the class, students must go online and enroll in the class the same way they would sign up for any other class.\n\nStep 3: Signing Up for the Course. Students may earn up to six (6) credit hours in PS 399 during a given semester, for a total of no more than 12 credit hours of the 120 required to graduate.[2] The number of possible credits in a given semester depends on how many hours the student will be working at the internship, as well as on the scope of the academic work the student is willing to perform. See the sample syllabus (here) for a table that provides guidance on how many credits students should expect for their internship.\n\nStep 4: Securing Formal Support of the Internship Director (step 4a) and the Internship Supervisor (step 4b)\n\nStep 4a: Formal Support from the Internship Director[1]. The Internship Director is in charge of the academic side of the internship. To secure formal support for the internship, students must complete and submit a Learning Contract Form (here). This contract lays out the academic requirements for PS 399 coordinated between the student and the Internship Director. These requirements will typically include (1) ongoing communication, (2) required readings, and (3) written evaluation(s). See the sample syllabus (here) for a more thorough explanation of these requirements. All forms will be submitted via Canvas once students are enrolled in PS399. Students who do not submit this required form can not earn credit for the class.\n\nStep 4b: Formal Support from the Internship Supervisor. While the Internship Director is in charge of the academic side of the internship (as explained in Step 3a above), the Internship Supervisor is the onsite person in charge of the job duties that the intern performs at the internship. This person will usually be someone who is in charge of the office where you will intern, such as the office manager. In addition to the Learning Contract coordinated with the Internship Director above, students must also complete a Memorandum of Agreement (here) with the Internship Supervisor. This form must also be turned in via Canvas. Students who do not submit this required form can not earn credit for the class.\n\nOnce students have completed Learning Contract (Step 4a) and Memorandum of Agreement (Step 4b), they should submit them to the Internship Director. Submissions will be made via Canvas no later than within the first two weeks that classes start. Submissions will not be accepted via email.\n\nStep 5: Exit Evaluation. Internship Supervisors will be asked to provide an evaluation for each student at the end of the term, and students cannot pass the course without either (a) achieving a favorable evaluation or (b) receiving an official waiver from the Internship Director. It is the student’s responsibility to provide the Internship Supervisor with the Exit Evaluation Form (here). As noted in the form, the Internship Supervisor may return the form directly to the Internship Director or give it to the student for submission.\n\n------------------------------\n\n[1] Note that students may secure sponsorship from another faculty member in lieu of the Internship Director to supervise the academic component of internships. This commonly happens when a faculty member’s research overlaps with the content of the internship (e.g., our Judicial Politics faculty commonly sponsor internships for students working at legal offices). In most cases, however, the Internship Director guides internships.\n\n[2] Note that internships do not always accommodate the semester’s academic calendar. As long as a majority of the hours on the job take place during the regularly scheduled semester, the Internship Director may count work performed in the weeks before the session starts when determining the number of credit hours for which a student is eligible. (However, students who perform work in advance hoping to receive internship credit do so at their own risk, because the department only gives formal approval to the Learning Contract and planned course of study when the semester gets underway.) Similarly, if the student can afford to take a temporary \"I\" incomplete grade at the end of the semester, the Internship Director has the discretion to count work hours completed after the semester's grades are due. Either way, the student still must complete the academic course requirements necessary to earn such credit before a grade may be entered.\n\nPath 5: Research Internships with Faculty\n\nStudents interested in performing research with faculty are encouraged to do so, and we commonly have many students each semester enrolled in PS 399 to perform research with faculty. These opportunities usually begin with students contacting faculty to see if they can support their research. Faculty also sometimes reach out to students with research opportunities.\n\nIf faculty agree to research internships, they have the discretion to proceed how they wish in terms of paperwork and agreements, provided that the Internship Director approve of the plan. Faculty frequently use the PS399 syllabus template (here), require a Learning Contract (here), and align work with PS399 Path 3 (see above). Faculty may also devise their own syllabi and modify the Learning Contract to suit the agreement coordinated with the student. Faculty willing to supervise a research internship should communicate with the Internship Director to assure that student experiences align with department goals and university rules.\n\nOnce the faculty sponsor, student, and the Internship Director have a mutually-agreeable plan, the Internship Director will instruct the student on how to enroll to earn PS399 credit for their research experience.\n\nFunding Opportunities\n\nInternships can be costly. Students often have to break leases, forgo income from paid jobs they would be doing otherwise, and take on additional costs for transportation, moving and living. However, students should never assume that they cannot afford to be an intern. The Political Science department is firmly committed to supporting students as much as possible to assure that our internship opportunities are available to all students. There are several routes to secure financial support for your internship.\n\nScholarships provided by the College of Arts and Sciences (here). Note that the Robert and Anne Trunzo Scholarship in Political Science and Pre-Law (here) is a common source of funding for PS interns. Students are automatically considered for the Trunzo Scholarship when they apply to either KLIP or WilDCats at the Capitol for the fall or spring terms. However, students must apply for Trunzo funds for all opportunities during the summer term.\n\nFunds provided by the Student Government Association (here; also see Wildcat Wardrobe here)\n\nFunds provided by the Office of Nationally Competitive Awards (here).\n\nScholarships provided by the University (here).\n\nFunds provided by the Department of Political Science (see the “Support for Internships and Financial Need” tab here).\n\nSummer\n\nAs we learn about internship opportunities available for the summer we will post them here.\n\nThe Summer Civic Leaders Program is a paid summer internship experience where Federal Work-Study eligible students engage with the community and a cohort of their peers.
