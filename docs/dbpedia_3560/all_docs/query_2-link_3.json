Rollins is leaving office to work with two state education groups. Kay is the chair of the Woodford County Democratic Party and a legislative aide to Democratic House leadership. A group of Democratic leaders from Woodford, Franklin and Fayette counties nominated him to run. Republicans will choose their nominee tonight . The special election will be June 25.\n\nThis race is the first of many anticipated battles for control of the state House, which is currently led by Democrats. The GOP has been eyeing a takeover for years, and hopes to gain ground in the next two years."
