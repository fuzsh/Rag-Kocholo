According to Sandy, “The determination my mom had when we were in the projects, paved the way to my success. Much to my surprise, I did become a statistic.

It took a while but I can humbly say that law is my future from this point forward.”\n\nALABAMA LAWYER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AWARD\n\nJeanne Marie Service Award\n\nThis award recognizes exemplary service to lawyers in need in the areas of substance abuse and mental health and is presented by the Alabama Lawyer Assistance Program Committee.\n\nJohnny V.
