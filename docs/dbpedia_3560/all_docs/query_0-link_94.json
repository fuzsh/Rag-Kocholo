In his message, President Franklin announced that the College had developed an organized way for Fellows to volunteer their pro bono legal services to assist needy children and families. In particular, the College established relationships with RAICES (The Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services) to allow Fellows to go directly to our Texas border to assist, and the American Immigration Lawyers Association to allow Fellows interested in assisting with asylum/immigration opportunities as they arise within their own city or state. Approximately 25 Fellows have already volunteered to help as needed. If you wish to volunteer, please contact Mark Surprenant Access to Justice and Legal Services Committee Member 504-585-0213 or at mark.surprenant@arlaw.com. Thank you for your assistance for those in need.\n\nIssues on Advertising in Canada\n\nThe Admission to Fellowship Advertising Subcommittee is interested in considering any current issues in Canada touching upon the topic of advertising and how it impacts our qualification criteria. Contact Advertising Subcommittee Chair Walter Bundy at walter@bundymcdonald.com or 843-212-0525.\n\nKentucky to Sponsor Trial Skills Training Program\n\nThe Kentucky Fellows are co­-sponsoring with the Kentucky Supreme Court Access to Justice Commission, a trial skills training program for legal aid lawyers with less than five years' experience. On Friday, Sept. 7, 2018, Kentucky Fellows will present lectures and training to the legal aid lawyers. The following day, Saturday, Sept. 8, a mock trial will take place with the scenario of a wrongful eviction case.\n\nConnecticut Works with Legal Services\n\nOn Jun. 29, 2018, Fellow Paul Iannaccone, State Committee Chair John Houlihan, Jr. and Judicial Fellow Hope Seeley, Judge of the State of Connecticut Superior Court participated in the Connecticut Legal Services Annual Meeting by putting on a lecture and demonstration on use of expert testimony.\n\nSecond Consecutive Trials Skills Seminar a Success in Massachusetts\n\nMassachusetts held its second annual trial skills seminar on May 14, 2018. It was well attended with over 100 young attorneys practicing in the greater Boston area and in New England. Many Fellows affiliated with the region participated in the program. There were individual sessions with training and demonstrations provided by some local Fellows. Suffolk University hosted the event. This year’s subject was direct examination.\n\nNew York Program Focuses on Direct, Cross Examination\n\nAn all-day program with 24 participants was held by Fellows from New York-Downstate on Jun. 27, 2018. All participants were legal services lawyers. Held at the Jones Day office in downtown Manhattan, it included 9 Fellows who acted as trainers. Titled “Direct & Cross Examination,” it consisted of mock trial exercises using College materials. Actors were used to play witnesses. Fellows who volunteered included: Regent Ritchie Berger, Susan Kellman, former Downstate New York Committee Chair Isabelle Kirshner, Shawn Kelly; newly nominated Regent Larry Krantz; Marc Mukasey, Pete Putzel, Andrew Lawler, and Tai Park. The feedback received was overwhelmingly positive.\n\nPennsylvania Fellow Recognized for Work to Help Veterans\n\nOn Jun. 21, 2018, Fellow Denny Shupe received the Jeffrey A. Ernico Award of the Pennsylvania Bar Association. The Ernico Award is \"an occasional award of the PBA Legal Services to the Public Committee that is to be given to such individuals and groups as the committee, from time to time, determines have provided unique service that has resulted in significant improvement in the provision of legal services to the neediest among us.\" Shupe received the award in large part for his work for veterans through the College's Special Problems in the Administration of Justice Committee (U.S.) which he currently chairs. He is one of the leaders in the College's nationwide effort to develop and implement a groundbreaking project to address the national problem of the Veteran Administration's over four-year backlog in processing and deciding disability award appeals for U.S. military veterans, delays that deny constitutional due process and can deny veterans the financial resources they need for daily living. Former Regent Dennis Suplee spoke at the award ceremony about Shupe’s many efforts on behalf of veterans. He also read a letter of congratulations from President Franklin which stated, in part, \"[t]he work that you, and other Fellows, recently have done to assist U.S. veterans in appealing adverse decisions in disability claims has been remarkable. On Jun. 7, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in Martin v. O'Rourke and consolidated cases, granted significant relief, abolishing the mandamus standard that the Veterans Court has applied since 1999. That previous standard was an insurmountable one under which no veteran ever has prevailed because it required the appellant to show that the delay amounted to an 'arbitrary refusal to act' by the VA. Hopefully the newly adopted standard for evaluating agency delay will prove much more effective for all veterans.\" Read the special edition on this latest update.\n\nUpdate on Special Problems in the Administration of Justice (U.S.)\n\nIn honor of Canada Day and Independence Day, a special edition of the eBulletin was sent highlighting the work Fellows have done for U.S. veterans. Read the special edition.\n\nNew Task Force on Judicial Independence\n\nThe Board of Regents approved the Task Force on Judicial Independence during the 2018 Spring Meeting in Phoenix, Arizona. The purpose of the Task Force is to review the College’s 2006 White Paper on Judicial Independence and update the same in light of current attacks on the judiciary, as well as to evaluate whether there are other actions the College might consider to be even more involved in defending judicial independence, consistent with the College's mission statement.\n\nVermont Continues to Lead in Second Annual Trial Academy\n\nVermont Fellows provided invaluable contributions to the Vermont Bar Association Second Annual Trial Academy at the Vermont Law School on Jul. 13, 2018. The day-long program was given high praise by participants. The program provided an opportunity for lawyers to present a variety of segments in criminal, civil, and family trial settings. Each participating lawyer was critiqued in individual courtrooms by either a judge or a volunteer lawyer. Judicial Fellows Kevin Griffin and David Fenster along with Fellows Ex Officio David Cleary, Vermont State Committee Chair Tom McCormick, Vermont State Committee Vice Chair Karen McAndrew, Regent Ritchie Berger, James Murdoch, Bill Leckerling, Jim Spink, and Mary Kay Lanthier offered thoughtful and detailed personalized critiques of the lawyer participants as they presented opening statements, direct examinations, cross examinations, and closing arguments. Lanthier also provided a closing argument of her own. During the intervening plenary sessions, the judges and Fellows presented tips and tricks for the courtroom. Vermont Law School Dean and President Thomas McHenry commenced the event by welcoming all to the trial academy and Judge Fenster closed the event with final remarks and thanks to all of the participants and volunteers."
