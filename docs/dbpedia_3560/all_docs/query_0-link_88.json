My dad served in the Navy, and I never even thought about his transition back to school. Your training was very eye opening and helpful to know the right questions to ask.\"\n\n- Kayla Robles, Advisor/Lecturer\n\n\"The Green Zone Brigade training equips the campus community with the information and tools that will help our military affiliated students succeed at NKU. I really appreciate the growing network of colleagues who are part of the GZB and who I can consult as appropriate to serve our students.\"\n\n- Peg Adams, M.ED Director, University Connect and Persist (UCAP)\n\n\"After attending the Green Zone Brigade training, I have a better understanding of military-affiliated students. The more I understand, the better advisor I will be. I appreciate Rusty's expertise, energy, and advocacy.\"\n\n-Mike Ruwe, English Department Advisor\n\n\"âThank you so much for todayâs training! I found it to be informative and fun (you were super entertaining!).\n\n- Margo Wheatley, Academic Coordinator PolitScience/Criminal Justice/Organzational Leadership"
