The changes became real in February 1988 when Lloyd said yes to the Lord’s call to pastoral ministry. Lloyd went back to school to finish his undergraduate degree in preparation to go to seminary.

There, she met her future husband, Steve Williams, who completed his PhD program at the University of Kentucky in political science.\n\nSteve and Elaine Williams moved to Cookeville, Tennessee, in 1970. At the center of Elaine’s faith was her devotion to public service. She served as an instructor, a mental health counselor, a social worker, and a grant writer. Working tirelessly, she improved the lives of those she served, seeking, in the words of St. Francis, to “understand rather than to be understood.” She divorced in 1998 and moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 2008 to be closer to her daughter.\n\nWhile in Indianapolis, Elaine served as a grant writer for the Indiana Primary Health Care Association, winning national awards for her work. Most importantly to her, she worked with local, state, and federal governmental agencies to procure the funds to build free and low-cost health clinics across the state. Her family has maintained a memorial scholarship in the name of her mother, Sybil Cordelia Bowden Tomlin, providing numerous scholarships to Asbury students.\n\nElaine is survived by her daughter, Laura (Allen) Town, and two grandsons, Lucas and Griffin Town, all of Zionsville, Indiana.
