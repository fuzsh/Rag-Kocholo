        "text": "Desireé Vega, Ph.D.\n\nAssociate Professor, Disability and Psychoeducational Studies, College of Education\n\nDr. Desireé Vega is an Associate Professor in the School Psychology program at the University of Arizona. She completed her BA in psychology at SUNY-Binghamton University and MA and Ph.D. in school psychology at The Ohio State University. Dr. Vega worked as a school psychologist for the Omaha Public Schools district for three years prior to beginning her faculty career at Texas State University. Her research, teaching, and service intersect to focus on advancing the academic outcomes of culturally and linguistically minoritized students and preparing future school psychologists and researchers to engage in advocacy and implement culturally responsive practices. Dr. Vega’s research focuses on three main areas: 1) identifying best practices in the training of bilingual school psychologists; 2) preparing culturally competent school psychologists; and 3) advancing the educational success of African American, Latinx, and emergent bilingual youth. She was most recently awarded the Excellence in Graduate Teaching and Mentoring Award from the Graduate College at the University of Arizona and the New Leader Award from The Ohio State University. Dr. Vega was also named an Emerging Scholar by Diverse: Issues in Higher Education in 2017 and a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) Fellow in 2019.\n\nMary Carol Combs, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor, Teaching, Learning & Sociocultural Studies, College Education\n\nI began my career as an ESL teacher in Washington, DC. Because my teacher’s salary didn’t cover the bills, I went to work for a non-profit organization as a bilingual education policy analyst. That was my day job. I continued to teach at night and on the weekends (I was young and energetic!). At the non-profit, one of my responsibilities was to talk to federal legislators about the role of students’ first languages in their acquisition of English. This meant I had to explain theories of second language learning, a task I often struggled with, in part because I didn’t understand these theories well enough myself. This fact led me to the University of Arizona and a doctoral program in language, reading and culture. My plan was to return to DC, but I discovered that I loved teaching and working with students. Currently, I am a professor in the Department of Teaching, Language and Sociocultural Studies, in the College of Education. My research interests include language and education policy and law, language and migration, sociocultural theory, second language acquisition, and teacher preparation for immigrant, refugee, and citizen second language learners. My published work focuses on the intersection of issues and their implications for students, teachers, and schools. I am honored and humbled to have received one of the Graduate Teaching and Mentoring Awards, particularly because I was nominated by my students, who continue to inspire me. The award is especially meaningful, because of the challenging conditions brought about by the COVID pandemic. Last year, I often questioned my ability to teach and mentor effectively. This award reminds me again that working with students is incredibly fulfilling and brings me great joy. Thank you.\n\nRobert Stephan, Ph.D.\n\nAssistant Professor, Religious Studies and Classics, College of Humanities\n\nDr. Stephan is an archaeologist by training and has taught in the University of Arizona’s Department of Religious Studies and Classics since 2016.

She earned her Ph.D. in Germanic Studies at the University of Chicago, where she subsequently held a postdoctoral position as Humanities Teaching Scholar. Prior to coming to the US from Germany, she studied at the Universities of Bonn, St. Andrews, and the Freie Universität Berlin to receive her M.A. in German and English Philology.\n\nDr. Jacobs’ research focuses on 19th-21st century German literature and film, Animal Studies, Environmental Humanities, Jewish Studies, the History of Sexuality, and the History of Science. She has published articles on monstrosity, multilingualism, literary censorship, biopolitics, animal epistemology, zoopoetics, critical plant studies, cultural environmentalism, and contemporary German Jewish identity. She also founded the Literary and Cultural Plant Studies Network together with Isabel Kranz (Vienna) and the help of Dani Stuchel (Tucson).\n\nCurrently, she is working on a monograph that examines a preoccupation with non-human forms of life in the micro-genre of the literary grotesque (die Groteske) around 1900, which begins with Oskar Panizza’s neo-romantic work in the 1890s, becomes a central element of modernism with authors such as Hanns Heinz Ewers and Salomo Friedlaender, and culminates in Franz Kafka’s unique oeuvre. This genre creates a field of artistic experimentation that allows for the transgression of categories such as species, race, and gender by introducing a nonhuman perspective on sexual and linguistic normativity. The vegetal, animal, and marginalized human figures at the center of these grotesque texts challenge biopolitical measures of control through, for instance, their non-conformity with standard human language. This linguistic limitation is reinforced by the genre’s response to mechanisms of literary censorship, which resulted in new modes of expressing political dissent during modernity’s language crisis. One of these central strategies is the texts’ provocative use of grotesque humor vis-à-vis normative conceptions of what it means to be human, which also marks the genre’s distinct historical scope, as it perceptively critiques the rise of the New Human from 19th-century physiognomy to the wake of the Nazi rule.\n\nAli Behrangi, Ph.D.\n\nDepartment of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences, College of Science\n\nDr. Behrangi is a University Distinguished Scholar and Associate Professor in the department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Science, a Joint Associate Professor in Civil Engineering-Engineering Mechanics and Geosciences.
