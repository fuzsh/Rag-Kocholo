Denver\n\nCivil War general, territorial governor and potential presidential candidate, James W. Denver personified “manifest destiny.” A room of the museum contains General Denver’s personal library and artifacts from his military and governmental careers. Born in 1817 near Winchester, Virginia, he and his family moved west to a farm near Wilmington in 1831. After receiving a degree from the Cincinnati Law School, he moved to Platte City, Mo., and opened a law office with a partner. Always in motion, Denver recruited a volunteer infantry in the war against Mexico and served under Gen. Winfield Scott. He led a party overland to California during the Forty-niner gold rush. He served in the California State Senate, was appointed secretary of state from California and elected to Congress from California in 1855. That same year he married Catherine Rombach, daughter of Matthew Rombach of Wilmington where the couple made their home. Involved in national politics, Denver served as commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1857, governor of the Kansas Territory during the era of “Bleeding Kansas,” and in the Civil War became brigadier general of all federal troops in Kansas. In the later years of Denver’s career, he organized a Washington, D.C., law firm representing Indians against the U.S. government for treaty violations. Upon his death, he was buried in the Denver Family plot located in Sugar Grove Cemetery (Wilmington). The home where he and Catherine resided, Rombach Place, while raising their family still stands and has been the location of the Clinton County Historical Society’s museum since 1955.\n\nThe Textile Room\n\nThe Textile Room includes a variety of Quaker (the Society of Friends) quilts and coverlets. Quakers played an early and prominent role in the settlement of Clinton County. Quaker influence remains today with over a half dozen active Quaker meetings in Clinton County. In 1870, a Society of Friends purchased the struggling Franklin College and established the Quaker college Wilmington College. Of particular interest in the Textile Room is the abolitionist quilt, circa 1842, made by abolitionist Quakers in Clinton County and Newport, Indiana. Measuring about six feet square, each of its 16 blocks is signed by its Quaker woman maker.\n\nWhile the quilt’s exact cause for creation remains unknown, scholar Ricky Clark, in the craft magazine “Piecework” (July/August 1995), suggests it was made by the women to strengthen bonds between the two Friends meetings during the abolition separation of 1843, “when Quakers were so divided over the question of abolition that members left or were excluded from the particular Quaker meetings to which they belong.”\n\nArtifacts, Clothing, Furnishings, and Photograph Repositories\n\nThe Society has a large textile collection (not on public display) and periodically features different eras of fashion. We also house a large photography collection which features historical images from across Clinton County, ranging from the early 1800s to more present. The photography repository is not open to public, but images are available for reproduction. Many of these images are featured weekly in our Throwback Thursday partnership with the Wilmington News Journal. Reproductions can be made in-house with 4×6 and 5×7. Should you need large images, a USB flash drive can be provided and copies made elsewhere. The Society does ask for a minimum $10/per image reproduction donation, which is used to purchase new archival materials and supplies for the images."
