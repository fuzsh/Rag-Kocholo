        "text": "Profiles of candidates for the Midway City Council were written by students in the University of Kentucky School of Journalism and Media. They appear in alphabetical order by candidate name.\n\nAdam Bailey says he's focused on helping local businesses\n\nBy Heston Bates\n\nCity Council candidate Adam Bailey has no prior experience with elective office but says “I want to give back to the community that has given myself and my family so much.”\n\nAdam Bailey\n\nBailey, 34, is director of community outreach and marketing at Trilogy Healthcare, a senior-living community in Lexington. He earned a business degree from Western Kentucky University and a Master’s in Business Administration from Midway University. He has lived in Midway for five years with his wife Amy and his two daughters, Harper and Scarlett. His father, Freeman Bailey, is director of the Woodford County Emergency Medical Service.\n\nBailey says one of his main goals if elected is to work more closely with local businesses to help them navigate the difficult economic climate of the pandemic.\n\n“I think it’s critical that we support them,” he said in the candidate forum sponsored by the Midway Woman’s Club and the Midway Messenger.\n\nBailey said he would love to give businesses another round of relief grants “if that’s in our budget” and suggested that the city work with the Woodford County Tourism Commission “to see what we can do.”\n\nHe also suggested that instead of continuing to lower property taxes as real-estate assessments rise, some property-tax revenue could be used to help businesses: “I think we should talk to the citizens and say, we can cut this property tax, or we can keep it and use that revenue to help support our small businesses.”\n\nAnother chronic issue facing the council is speeding on city streets. The city has tried a number of measures to deter speeding, such as new speed-limit signs and placing an empty police car on South Winter Street. Asked what he believes the council should do about speeding, Bailey said “We need collaboration from the state, the police department and us to come up with a plan.”\n\nMidway recently bought a ladder truck that doesn’t fit in the fire station, so Mayor Grayson Vandegrift raised the idea of building a new fire station at Midway Station. Bailey said, “It’s definitely something we need to explore. I would love an opportunity to talk to the fire department and see what they think.”\n\nAnother issue at Midway Station is the proposed buffer zone. The Economic Development Authority has offered the city 38 acres along the highways in return for debts it owes the city. The property would be a buffer zone separating the industrial park from the highways. Bailey said “It sounds like a fair trade and good deal, but I would need more information to say I support it one hundred percent.”\n\nOne question facing the council is whether to keep pursuing industrial development once Midway Station is fully developed. Bailey said the urban service zone should not change. “It’s important that we do create growth opportunities” he said, “but at the same time make sure we keep that small town culture that I think is Midway’s allure.”\n\nThe historic Odd Fellows Lodge at 116 W. Main St. is another issue that the council may have to handle. The building inspector has required the owner of the property to make repairs to the building by Oct. 31, and it looks unlikely that the owner will get the repairs done in time.\n\nAsked what the city should do about the building, Bailey said “It’s difficult because it is a historic building and I think it should be protected by Midway, but at the same time it is very rundown; it’s dangerous.” He added, “I think we should reach out to the community and get their opinion and see if we can find a way to keep the building.”\n\nKaye Nita Gallagher says her experience is needed at a critical time\n\nBy Heston Bates\n\nUniversity of Kentucky School of Journalism and Media\n\nRunning for a fourth term, City Council Member Kaye Nita Gallagher says she believes that her six years will be crucial in helping Midway navigate the unpredictability of the pandemic and other issues.\n\n“I think it helps,” she said in an interview, “because I know what’s going on especially with Midway Station and the sewer project.”\n\nKaye Nita Gallagher\n\nGallagher, 56, is a retired state employee, assistant manager at the Brown Barrel restaurant, and runs a mobile kettle corn business, 2 Ladies and a Kettle. She also works part time at Kohl’s in Frankfort. Gallagher said she believes working a variety of jobs helps her council work because the jobs provide connections to the community.\n\nGallagher grew up in Franklin and Scott counties, attended the University of Kentucky for a year and worked in personnel and payroll for Kentucky State Parks. She said she has lived for nearly 26 years in her grandparents’ old house in the 100 block of West Main Street.\n\nWhat goals does Gallagher have if elected to another term? “I would like to see Midway Station at 100 percent occupancy.” The city has already filled the industrial lots but still needs to sell the commercial ones to complete development. “I want to see all the lots filled before my time on the council is over,” she said. In the forum, she said, “Once we get Midway Station full that’s it; we don’t need to develop anymore.”\n\nAsked if she favors another round of pandemic relief for businesses, she said, “If it’s possible yes. If there was another round, it would be back on us, and chances are it couldn’t go to the citizens again; it would have to go to the businesses. . . . Obviously their sales aren’t as good as they’ve been in the past,” she said, “but they’re surviving.”\n\nDue to a rise in real-estate evaluations the council has lowered property-tax rates. Asked in the Oct. 5 candidate forum if the council should continue to do that if assessments keep rising, Gallagher said “I think with Midway Station full the occupational tax is going to bring in a lot more money. If we can lower it without being a burden on the city, that would be great. If not we ought to keep them where they are at.”\n\nAnother issue facing the council is speeding. Gallagher said new speed limit signs and an empty police car in front of the doctor’s office to deter speeders seem to be only temporary solutions, because she still gets complaints about speeding. Gallagher is open to new solutions “if we can do some kind of research, if we can get some sort of study.”\n\nThe city recently bought a new ladder truck for the fire department, but it won’t fit into the fire station on Bruen Street, prompting Mayor Grayson Vandegrift to suggest building a new station at Midway Station. Asked about that, Gallagher said, “Not right now; possibly in the future, as long as we have the money, but if there is a fire at Midway University the one on Bruen Street would be able to get there faster.”\n\nIn developing Midway Station, the Woodford County Economic Development Authority has incurred debts to the city. The EDA recently proposed to retire the debt by deeding the city 38 acres of land along the highways that would be a buffer zone between the industrial park and the roads. Gallagher said “We should accept the buffer zone just because they have helped us out so much with developing Midway Station.”\n\nThe owner of the historic Odd Fellows Lodge at 116 E. Main St. has been required by the building inspector to complete repairs by Oct. 31. “I really don’t know what we would with it if we took it over,” Gallagher said. “A lot of people have talked about wanting a public restroom in downtown Midway; well, there you go.”\n\nSara Hicks says she is seeking re-election to finish work on projects\n\nBy Taylor Beavers\n\nSara Hicks has served five two-year terms on the Midway City Council and is seeking a sixth.\n\nShe said in an interview that she wants to be re-elected because “There are some projects that I would really like to see us complete,” such as painting the water towers and repairing cemeteries.\n\nSara Hicks\n\nHicks, 68, was born in Midway and grew up on a farm now called Lantern Hill Farm, just outside the city. She completed her master’s degree in marriage and family therapy from Azusa Pacific University, then practiced as a marriage and family therapist for 30 years in Los Angeles and Naples, Florida.\n\nHicks returned to Midway in 2004. She takes care of her mother, Neisje Spragens, who is 96, and gets involved in the community through groups such as the Dining for Women club, an organization that donates money to international projects that support women.\n\nHicks is an advocate for environmental conservation, often raising such issues at council meetings. “I think we all should be concerned about the environment,” she said. “It takes a group of people on city council to push these ideas, because otherwise they don't get talked about.”\n\nShe said she wants to preserve the beauty and health of the community by making a sustainable agenda with ordinances and plans for the city. She says she wants to keep as many mature trees in the community as possible, and replace those that have to be cut down. Looking at options to use solar energy for heating and cooling is also one of her goals.\n\nHicks also voiced her support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and said she would like to see more people of color in positions on boards and policymaking groups in Midway: “It’s important that we make every effort to bring more people of color into our governance.”\n\nWhen local businesses received covid-19 relief, Hicks was in support of it and believed it lifted people’s spirits and gave them hope.\n\nHicks said in the Oct. 5 candidate forum that she would be in support of another round of relief “if we get it from the federal government.” She said that during the pandemic, the economy is too unsteady for the council to consider lowering property taxes further if real-estate assessments keep increasing.\n\n“We need to see how we’re doing, in terms of income for the city, before we think about reducing property tax further or reducing occupational tax,” said Hicks. In an interview, she said, “I don’t foresee Midway lowering the occupational tax.”\n\nHicks says rezoning of land for industry has come to a stopping point. She said that until the whole of Midway Station is built out, there’s no need to rezone any property for industry.\n\n“That’s a lot of property that’s already been allotted to growth,” she said in the forum. “I think that’s probably enough that should do us, hopefully, for another 50 years at least.”\n\nHicks is also in favor of accepting land for a buffer zone around Midway Station in return for forgiving debt of the Woodford County Economic Development Authority. “Any time that you can put aside land to be left as parkland,” she said, “ it's a benefit to the environment and a benefit to your community.”\n\nAs for relocating the fire station to Midway Station, partly to accommodate a recently purchased ladder truck, Hicks said she would support it because, “The firemen have said they need more space.”\n\nHicks said she wants to be responsive to these requests but believes other projects should come first, such as repainting the water towers.\n\nAsked what should be done about speeding in the city, Hicks said she would consider speed bumps but worries that they would slow ambulance response time. “Time is of the essence when someone is in an ambulance,” she said, adding that continued attention from the police department would help.\n\nThe owner of the property at 116 W. Main St. has until Oct. 31 to complete repairs, but if he doesn’t, Hicks says she would want to “follow our ordinances for blighted property.”\n\nJohn McDaniel seeks return to council after two years out of office\n\nBy Gage O’Dell\n\nJohn McDaniel, who ran for a second term on city council in 2018 and lost, is running to get back on the council. And he is running on his own terms.\n\nOne of the most well-known figures in Midway, McDaniel did not give an interview to the Midway Messenger, did not respond to the seven questions that the Messenger emailed all council candidates, didn't answer the Chamber of Commerce questionnaire and did not participate in the candidate forum.\n\nJohn McDaniel\n\nHe did say on Facebook that he is running because “Many people have put their heart in soul into Midway, making it what is today. I want to continue to carry on the love they had for the community and continue to practice financial conservatism.”\n\nHe also answered a questionnaire from Woodford Forward, which exacerbated his ongoing conflict with Mayor Grayson Vandegrift.\n\n“The city should have a five-year comprehensive plan that includes present number of businesses that are licensed, carrying out the work that needs to be done on infrastructure, and consideration for possible grants and future purchases for the fire department,” McDaniel said, the added:\n\n“Our firefighting needs are changing as the structures being built at Midway Station require special equipment and need to be considered ahead of time, not just buying firetrucks on the spur of the moment. . . . We don’t need a truck that when it is picked up ... requires two service calls to get it to Midway. If we have as much money as the mayor says, let’s get good, reliable equipment. Let’s plan ahead.”\n\nVandegrift told the Messenger that that the fire department had searched for a ladder truck for two years. “They came across a perfect opportunity for us and got a really good ladder truck,” he said.\n\nHe said the money for the truck was in the budget, as part of state fire aid: “We didn’t specifically budget to purchase it this year, but we had the line item in the budget as essentially a contingency.”\n\nHe said McDaniel’s statement about service calls was inaccurate. “I have no idea what he is referring to,” he said.\n\nMcDaniel also said in the questionnaire that he hopes “city government can find its way clear to support the next bank that opens in Midway.”\n\nThe city moved all but one of its accounts from WesBanco before the bank announced that it would close its Midway branch in January. Vandegrift told the Messenger in September that he did not think the change had anything to do with the closing.\n\nAlso in the questionnaire, McDaniel said he would need to have more information regarding the Versailles northwest bypass. He is the only candidate not opposed to the project.\n\nIn early 2015, the council endorsed a letter from an alliance of Woodford County groups saying the road should not be built. In 2016, it was removed as a goal in a revision of the comprehensive plan, as part of an amendment by a committee of representatives from Midway, Versailles and the county government.\n\nMcDaniel, 71, has a long record of public service, volunteer and paid. He has been active in the Midway Merchants Association, the Midway Veterans Memorial, Midway Renaissance and the Midway Museum. He was also a city and county police officer for 12 years.\n\nMcDaniel was Midway’s citizen of the year in 2003 and received a governor’s citation for community Service in 2007 and 2013. The council recognized him in 2012 for saving the life of a woman who was choking at a local restaurant. During the last council meeting of his term, a farewell resolution honored him by calling him “Mister Midway” for his passion to the city and his civic leadership.\n\nMcDaniel lost his bid for a second term on the council after finishing third in the Democratic primary for Midway-area magistrate. He placed seventh of eight candidates, 19 votes behind sixth-place finisher Bruce Southworth. The top six vote-getters are elected.\n\nLogan Nance still taking stands on issues as he seeks second term\n\nBy Gage O’Dell\n\nLogan Nance took a high profile as a freshman City Council member, winning passage of a resolution promoting resettlement of refugees and voting against annexation and industrial zoning of land next to Midway Station.\n\nNance is running for a second term on the same reasons he ran for his first, calling for continued infrastructure investment and exploring options for affordable housing, and a more recent issue of finding a better option for investing the city surplus.\n\nLogan Nance\n\nNance, 33, is a six-year veteran of the Army and was deployed to Afghanistan for a year. He graduated from the University of Kentucky with a degree in political science in 2014 and is a consultant for a firm that helps businesses improve employee performance,\n\nNance introduced a resolution in May 2019 declaring that the city of Midway supported the resettlement of refugees in Kentucky communities and called on others to join them in support. The council passed the resolution 4-2 after much debate.\n\nNance said he was surprised by the initial public backlash, but felt confident after a public forum on the issue that Midway’s heart was in the right place. “I think that public forum was one of the best things to come out of my two-year term,” he said. “I’m very proud of that resolution.”\n\nIn the same month he introduced the resolution, Nance was the lone council member who voted against annexation of the 138-acre Freeny tract, on grounds it would ensure industrial development beyond Midway Station. Seven months later, he was the only member to vote against rezoning it from agricultural to industrial, saying “At some point we have to stop our industrial development.”\n\nNance now says, “I’m not in favor of any more industrial development,” and he is no longer a loner. During the Oct. 5 candidate forum, all 10 candidates agreed that it was time to stop rezoning land in and around Midway for industry, especially once Midway Station hits capacity.\n\nDespite his wish to stop industrial development, Nance said he is thrilled with the results Midway has seen from it. “I’m very happy with what’s going on at Midway Station,” he said. “It’s allowed us to do some great projects around town and has a great number of jobs,” which have tripled the city’s main source of revenue, the occupational tax on wages and net profits.\n\nNance said he is undecided on whether the council should accept the proposed deal on the buffer-zone land at Midway Station. The city would take the land along highways in exchange for forgiving debts of the Woodford County Economic Development Authority. “My only concern is what kind of commitment is it going to take for us to maintain it,” he said. “I still need to look into it more.”\n\nNance was in favor of reducing property-tax rates this year, to counter an increase in real-estate assessments, but said in the forum that the council should consider a more far-reaching option.\n\n“If we’ve decided there’s not a ton of places to build more homes,” he said, “I do think we need to look at reducing or getting rid of property taxes at the city level altogether. . . . You have a lot of people in Midway on fixed income and as the population ages, that will go up more. We have to look at it and see how we can help people not get priced out of their homes.”\n\nNance also stood out at the forum by opposing city funding of public restrooms downtown, saying “I have concerns with the logistics of building the facility and maintaining it.” He said city employees are already overworked, and “Not having public restrooms does force people into the restaurants.”\n\nAnd he is the only council member to come out against the idea of building a new fire station at Midway Station to replace the one on Bruen Street.\n\n“I want the fire station to stay in town,” he said. “Now I know the mayor said it was at the recommendation of the chief, just one brief conversation. . . . I think it’s important the fire station be near residential buildings, just in case there is some sort of emergency; every second counts.”\n\nNance said he wants to find a better option of investing a portion of the city’s surplus than the current certificates of deposit, which produce “very minimal returns,” he said. “I think there are great options at minimal risk that could give us more return in the end.”\n\nAndrew Nelle has been watching the council and wants to join it\n\nBy Evan Johnson\n\nIf political novice Andrew Nelle gets elected to the City Council, it won’t be unfamiliar to him. Ever since he moved from Lexington to Midway in November of 2019, he said, he has had a strong desire to get involved in the community and local government, and started proving it immediately by watching every meeting of the council, Midway Mayor Grayson Vandegrift said when Nelle filed in June.\n\n“I love Midway and want to give back,” Nelle said in an interview.\n\nAndrew Nelle\n\nNelle has an associate’s degree from McKendree University and is pursuing an associate’s degree in hotel, motel, and restaurant management at Sullivan University. He is a delivery driver for Amazon Transportation Services and a musician. He and his fiancé Jillian have three children.\n\nNelle said he was in the Air Force for eight years and is a part-time chaplain assistant and staff sergeant in the Kentucky Air National Guard. He is also a noncommissioned officer at the affiliated Religious Affairs, assisting military members and their families by providing religious support.\n\nNelle calls himself a proud Hispanic-American. His mother’s family is from Puerto Rico and Guadeloupe, in the Caribbean. He says he understands the importance of cultural heritage and the need for it to be preserved, one aspect of Midway that he is very passionate about.\n\nNelle said he experienced some prejudice growing up in Lexington, due to his multi-ethnic background and darker skin tone, but those experiences strengthened him and gave him a clearer perspective on race and ethnicity issues in the U.S. He recalled, “There were several times where I experienced situations like that when I was really young and it definitely changed the way I see certain things.”\n\nIn answering the Woodford County Chamber of Commerce questionnaire, Nelle said he comes from “a family of civil servants.” His father was chair of the history department at the University of Kentucky and his mother was a longtime research librarian for the Lexington Herald-Leader.\n\nNelle said Midway still needs growth opportunities, but he wants to preserve the historical aspects that give Midway its identity. “Maintaining the historical heritage in this town is really important to me.”\n\nNelle emphasized growth opportunities, not change, as the cornerstone of his campaign agenda: “I do not believe Midway needs change as much as it does growth opportunities.”\n\nIn particular, he said small businesses need to have as much support as possible from the council and the community during the turbulence of the pandemic.\n\nIn regard to the proposed Midway Station deal with the EDA, Nelle said “I am in favor of any initiatives that completely benefit Midway and its citizens. If I understand this deal correctly, acquiring land for forgiveness of previous debts seems like a legitimate exchange.”\n\nAsked about what the city should do about the historic building at 116 E. Main St. if the owner fails to complete repairs by the building inspector’s deadline of Oct. 31, he said the owner should get more time, given the pandemic. “I believe a fair but stern warning should be given to the building owners,” he said. “However, I also believe more time should be provided for them to complete their restoration.”\n\nNelle said he was interested in establishing a small business near Midway, and advocated tax policy that would be advantageous to small businesses and citizens.\n\nHe said he is the type of person “not afraid to knock on some doors” and would do whatever was required of him as a council member. He said he wouldn’t be opposed to frequent town-hall meetings on Zoom so that every citizen could have a chance to voice their opinions.\n\nMary Raglin says she would bring diversity, unheard voices to council\n\nBy Jordan Brown\n\nMary Raglin, a Midway resident pretty much her entire life, is retired at 69 but looking to get more involved by trying to get elected to the City Council. This is her first race for an elective office.\n\n“It’s time to take a step into the unknown. I feel like I’m getting married to Midway after a long relationship,” Raglin wrote in her Woodford County Chamber of Commerce election profile.\n\nMary Raglin\n\nRaglin told the Messenger she wants to be a voice for African Americans and people of color, who she believes have been unheard in recent years. Asked what she can add to the council, she said, “Number one is going to be diversity.”\n\nRaglin would be the first councilwoman of color and the first African American since Aaron Hamilton served in 2011-14. He signed her nominating petition.\n\nShe reiterated her motivation for running during the candidates’ forum, saying she wants “to be that voice you don’t hear; I want to be that Black voice. I’ve lived in Midway all my life and I’ve been silent. I don’t want to be silent anymore; I want my voice to be heard.”\n\nRaglin worked for the Lexington-Fayette Urban County government for 27 years as a 911 operator and also retired from the Army Reserve after 25 years. The council appointed her to the Woodford County Human Rights Commission in 2016, and she would have to resign from the commission if elected.\n\nDuring the forum, the candidates agreed on many topics, but Raglin was one of two who opposed city funding for public restrooms, along with incumbent Logan Nance.\n\nAsked if it is time to stop rezoning of land for industry in and around Midway, Raglin said, “I would say Midway is a small, quaint, little, personable town. Let’s keep it that way. . . . Midway Station is a big enough project that will keep Midway busy for a while.”\n\nThe council has reduced property taxes as real-estate assessments have gone up. Raglin was asked if that should continue, or if the occupational tax should be reduced. “Reducing the property-tax rates would be very beneficial to all property owners, especially our elderly and our senior citizens,” she said. “I really need to take the time to study more about occupational taxes, though.”\n\nAsked if the city should fund another round of covid-19 relief to businesses, Raglin said she wouldn't object. “Everyone is struggling during this covid-19, so if we can help, then we should.”\n\nSpeeding has been an issue in Midway for a long time. Raglin said, “I say put more speed-limit signs.”\n\nRaglin said she supports the idea of a new fire station, “one that would be able to house all of the equipment we have and possibly have space for future equipment we made need later and still be accessible for the city of Midway at Midway Station.”\n\nAsked if the council should accept the proposed deal on the buffer-zone land at Midway Station, Raglin said, “This is what excites me about having a seat on the Midway City Council. This is what I want to learn more about and have a voice that will affect everyone in Midway.”\n\nAsked what the city should do about the property at 116 E. Main St. if the owner doesn’t complete repairs by Oct. 31, she said the owner should get more time if requested. “If he is making an effort in getting the repairs done but has not yet completed the job I would be a little more patient,” she said. “If he just flat out refuses to make the repairs, then the building inspector or the mayor/city council has to take the next step . . . whatever that is.”"
