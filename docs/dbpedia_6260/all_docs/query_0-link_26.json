The term \"Stefan problem\" isgenerally used for heat transfer problems with phase-changes suchas from the liquid to the solid. Stefan problems have somecharacteristics that are typical of them, but certain problemsarising in fields such as mathematical physics and engineeringalso exhibit characteristics similar to them. The term``classical\" distinguishes the formulation of these problems fromtheir weak formulation, in which the solution need not possessclassical derivatives. Under suitable assumptions, a weak solutioncould be as good as a classical solution. In hyperbolic Stefanproblems, the characteristic features of Stefan problems arepresent but unlike in Stefan problems, discontinuous solutions areallowed because of the hyperbolic nature of the heat equation.

Knez Stefan (1377-1427, Knez Lazar's son, received the title of Despotes according to the procedure long ago established at the Byzantine Court. In Byzantium, this title, which was second in rank only to the title of the Emperor, used to be endowed to the relatives of the imperial dynasty, it was not hereditary and did not depend on the territory ruled by the bearer of the title. It was a personal court title of the highest rank in Byzantium. This honor was bestowed upon the young Knez Stefan in summer of 1402 after his return from the battlefield of Angora (Ankara, where Sultan Beyazid I suffered a disastrous defeat from the hands of the Tatars. The Serbian Knez was solemnly received in Constantinople, a marriage between himself and a sister of the Byzantine Empress was arranged and John VII Palaeologus, the co-regent of the then-absent Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus, endowed him with the title of Despotes. Knez Stefan carried this title till the end of his life. It was held in great honors in Serbia and was broadened in meaning to designate a ruler's title in general, remaining alive among the Serbs even after the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Stefan LazareviÄ received the dignity of a Despotes once more, in 1410 in Constantinople. All this notwithstanding, the political situation in the South-East of Europe at the beginning of the 15th Century was all but favorable. Some Christian states were conquered by the Turks (Bulgaria, some were vassals of the Sultan (Byzantium, Serbia. Everything depended on the Ottomans. At the time of dynastic conflicts in the Turkish Empire (1403\n\nThe 'Byzantinisms' of king Stefan Radoslav\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaksimoviÄ Ljubomir\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The life-style and politics of Stefan Radoslav bear the mark of activities that indicated his special attachment to the Byzantine world. These activities were prompted by a combination of ideological ambitions and political reality, but they were not in keeping with the modest achievements of Radoslav's reign. Moreover, most of these activities belong to the time when Radoslav was heir to the throne. There is no doubt that Stefan NemanjiÄ the Grand Zhupan and subsequently the first crowned king, had exclusive connections with the Byzantine dynasty of the Angeloi, especially with the emperor Alexios III (1195-1203. In that context, the donor's inscription in the basic ring of the dome in the Church of the Mother of God in Studenica (1208, in which his father Stefan Nemanja, is mentioned as (former 'veleslavni gospodin vse srbske zemlje veli(ki Å¾upan i svat cara grÄkog kir Alesija', is quite indicative. This ideological construction would acquire a contour in reality by means of a political marriage with one of the female offspring of Angeloi lineage, which would represent an alternative solution to Stefan's failed marriage with Eudocia, daughter of the emperor Alexios. Instead, several years elapsed in waging war with the Latins, the Bulgarians and the State of Epiros. However, efforts to create firmer, more tangible ties with the Angeloi dynasty from Epiros were not forgotten. Therefore, the Serbian monarch brought his eldest son Radoslav into play, intending to have him act as a link with the Angeloi bloodline. As a result of all this, the final attempt to have Radoslav become the husband of a princess from the Angelos dynasty is not surprising. At the end of 1219 or the beginning of 1220, he married Anna Doukaina, the daughter of the epirotic ruler Theodore I Angelos Doukas Komnenos, which at that point represented a marriage connection of the highest possible level between two ruling houses.

The suggested solution on the co-rule of Stefan and Radoslav may be most succinctly expressed as following: as early as in the year of 1220, due to the frail health of Stefan the First-Crowned and Radoslav's marriage to Anne the Epirus princess, Radoslav was crowned to be the king and positioned to co-rule with his father after the Byzantine model of governing. Nevertheless this point of view has some loose ends. The notion of co-ruling and the very term of 'co-ruler' are quite freely used in the scholarly works. A general consensus on the precise meaning has not been reached yet. At the point where one author perceives a co-rule, the other categorically denies it. Basically the approach equalizing the heir to the throne and the co-ruler is wrong. Although the co-rulers in most cases were the throne heirs, they cannot be called the co-rulers because of the right to inherit the throne, but for the ruling attributes that formally established that right. The conviction of the co-rule of King Stefan and his son Radoslav is founded on the interpretation of the facts coming from the following sources: entitling charters for the monastery of Å½iÄa, produced by Stefan and Radoslav around 1220; some segments from St. Sava's biographies by Domentian and Theodosius describing the circumstances of Stefan's death-bed leaving the throne to Radoslav; the three acts of the town of Kotor from 1221 and 1227 dated by the rule of king Radoslav, the portraits of Stefan and Radoslav next to the entrance to the Church of the Ascension in the monastery of Å½iÄa and in the nartex of the MileÅ¡eva monastery church. In the first Å½iÄa charter, Stefan calls Radoslav his heir, while in the second Å½iÄa charter Stefan points out Radoslav as his first-born son blessed by him to be the king of the whole state.

Stefan flow, an aerodynamic flow originating in the fluid surrounding evaporating or condensing bodies, pushes airborne particles away from the surface of the supercooled droplets evaporating in the vicinity of an ice crystal. The particle Brownian flux towards the surface of the ice crystal (terminal velocity of about 1 m s -1 ) is, therefore, enhanced. However, the efficiency of this process of airborne-particle removal is strongly reduced as a consequence of the cooling of the evaporating droplet which produces a ''thermal force'', thermophoresis, which counteracts the particle Stefan flow. At the surface of an evaporating droplet in a quasi-equilibrium state, the two airborne-particle velocity fields practically balance each other. This counteracting effect on particle motion needs to be evaluated in the transient case. An approach is presented which consists of reformulating the transient heat and mass transfer problem in such a way as to convert it into a purely heat transfer problem having a known analytical solution. The approach is discussed and found to be correct. The results of the computations show that the counteracting role of thermophoresis on Stefan-flow particle motion during the residence time of supercooled droplets in the vicinity of an ice crystal (from 10 -5 to 10 -4 s), which is also the time in which evaporation takes place, is considerably weak. It turns out to be practically negligible for large droplets (radius >= 8x10 -4 cm)\n\nApproximate Analytic Solutions for the Two-Phase Stefan Problem Using the Adomian Decomposition Method\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nXiao-Ying Qin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available An Adomian decomposition method (ADM is applied to solve a two-phase Stefan problem that describes the pure metal solidification process. In contrast to traditional analytical methods, ADM avoids complex mathematical derivations and does not require coordinate transformation for elimination of the unknown moving boundary. Based on polynomial approximations for some known and unknown boundary functions, approximate analytic solutions for the model with undetermined coefficients are obtained using ADM. Substitution of these expressions into other equations and boundary conditions of the model generates some function identities with the undetermined coefficients. By determining these coefficients, approximate analytic solutions for the model are obtained. A concrete example of the solution shows that this method can easily be implemented in MATLAB and has a fast convergence rate. This is an efficient method for finding approximate analytic solutions for the Stefan and the inverse Stefan problems.\n\nNumerical solution of Stefan's problem to heterogeneous materials\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBasombrio, F.G.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nWe present an extension of the methodology developed by R.H.

The simple Fick law with a diagonal diffusion matrix is an approximation of Maxwell-Stefan. Formulations of diffusion combined with mass-averaged Darcy flow are considered for three component gases. For this application, the formulations can be compared computationally in a simple, one dimensional setting. Despite the models' seemingly different structure, it is observed that the predictions of the formulations are very similar on the cathode when air is used as oxidant. The two formulations give quite different results when the Nitrogen in the air oxidant is replaced by helium (this is often done as a diagnostic for fuel cells designs). The two formulations also give quite different results for the anode with a dilute Hydrogen stream. These results give direction to when Maxwell-Stefan diffusion, which is more complicated to implement computationally in many codes, should be used in fuel cell simulations.\n\nMemorias de un judÃ­o: el mundo visto por Stefan Zweig\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKÃªnia Maria de Almeida Pereira\n\n2011-03-01\n\nFull Text Available El artÃ­culo traza el periplo vital e ideolÃ³gico del escritor Stefan Zweig a partir de su libro El mundo que yo vi: mis memorias, de 1942.

This paper focuses on solving the two-phase inverse Stefan problem when the interface moving is unknown, which is more realistic from the practical point of view. With the help of optimization method, the paper presents a hybrid method which combines the homotopy perturbation method with the improved Adomian decomposition method to solve this problem. Simulation experiment demonstrates the validity of this method. Optimization method plays a very important role in this paper, so we propose a modified spectral DY conjugate gradient method. And the convergence of this method is given. Simulation experiment illustrates the effectiveness of this modified spectral DY conjugate gradient method.\n\n[Stefan Hartmann.

Salomatova\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The article focuses on archbishop Stefan Yavorskyâs works which reflect the transitional character of late 17th â early 18th centuries Russian sermons. Before that time the genre had been loyal to the canonical principles of scholasticism, and beginning with Stefan Yavorsky the sermon was enriched with new ways of material presentation and new content. The use of numerous biblical personal names, names of saints, Fathers of the Church and theologians represents a trait inherent in the sermon as a genre, a wide use of non-biblical names being chiefly a distinctive feature of scholastic works. Among those names the author points out: 1 names of saints, Fathers of the Church, church hierarchs; 2 names of gods and heroes of Antiquity; 3 names of ancient philosophers, historians and rulers; 4 names of foreign rulers, historians and public figures of the modern period; 5 names of Russian rulers. Thereby, the anthroponyms of non-biblical origin could be attributes of both âinformationalâ (names of ancient gods and historical figures and âspiritualâ (names of saints, Fathers of the Church, church hierarchs parts of a sermon. The author distinguishes the following functions of the analyzed names: 1 indication of sources of information (most frequent; 2 naming of the characters of a story or parable cited for illustrative purposes; 3 naming of a described person.\n\nHistorical basis of the Miracula of Saint Symeon in Stefan the First-Crownedâs life of Symeon\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKomatina Ivana\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper is devoted to the research of the so-called Catalog of Miracles in the Life of Saint Symeon by Stefan the First-Crowned. Because the miracles are divided in the Life into those in which Symeon-Nemanja is revealed as a Saint, and those in which his heir Stefan the First-Crowned conquers the enemies of the Serbian State with his help, the attention is paid on research of their historical basis and chronological frame, as well as their religious essence.

Asinari, Phys. Rev. E 77, 056706 (2008)]. The theoretical basis is the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-type kinetic model for gas mixtures [P. Andries, K. Aoki, and B. Perthame, J. Stat. Phys. 106, 993 (2002)]. In the present paper, the recovered macroscopic equations in the continuum limit are systematically investigated by varying the ratio between the characteristic diffusion speed and the characteristic barycentric speed. It comes out that the diffusion speed must be at least one order of magnitude (in terms of Knudsen number) smaller than the barycentric speed, in order to recover the Navier-Stokes equations for mixtures in the incompressible limit. Some further numerical tests are also reported. In particular, (1) the solvent and dilute test cases are considered, because they are limiting cases in which the Maxwell-Stefan model reduces automatically to Fickian cases. Moreover, (2) some tests based on the Stefan diffusion tube are reported for proving the complete capabilities of the proposed scheme in solving Maxwell-Stefan diffusion problems. The proposed scheme agrees well with the expected theoretical results.\n\nA Stefan model for mass transfer in a rotating disk reaction vessel\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nBOHUN, C. S.\n\n2015-05-04\n\nCopyright Â© Cambridge University Press 2015. In this paper, we focus on the process of mass transfer in the rotating disk apparatus formulated as a Stefan problem with consideration given to both the hydrodynamics of the process and the specific chemical reactions occurring in the bulk. The wide range in the reaction rates of the underlying chemistry allows for a natural decoupling of the problem into a simplified set of weakly coupled convective-reaction-diffusion equations for the slowly reacting chemical species and a set of algebraic relations for the species that react rapidly. An analysis of the chemical equilibrium conditions identifies an expansion parameter and a reduced model that remains valid for arbitrarily large times. Numerical solutions of the model are compared to an asymptotic analysis revealing three distinct time scales and chemical diffusion boundary layer that lies completely inside the hydrodynamic layer. Formulated as a Stefan problem, the model generalizes the work of Levich (Levich and Spalding (1962) Physicochemical hydrodynamics, vol. 689, Prentice-Hall Englewood Cliffs, NJ) and will help better understand the natural limitations of the rotating disk reaction vessel when consideration is made for the reacting chemical species.\n\nRomain Rolland, Stefan Zweig et lâEurope (1919-1933)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBrancy , Jean-Yves\n\n2005-01-01\n\nInternational audience; Romain Rolland (1866-1944), lâhomme qui a tentÃ© de fÃ©dÃ©rer les esprits europÃ©ens contre la Barbarie de la guerre en 1914, fut un prÃ©curseur de lâidÃ©e europÃ©enne moderne.

The model is based on the Maxwell-Stefan approach and takes into account steric, Donnan, and dielectric effects in the transport of mono and divalent ions. Theoretical ion rejection for multi-electrolyte mixtures was obtained by numerically solving the 'hindered transport' based on the generalized Maxwell-Stefan equation for the flux of ions. A computer simulation has been developed to predict the transport in the range of nanofiltration, a numerical procedure developed linearization and discretization form of the governing equations, and the finite volume method was employed for the numerical solution of equations. The developed numerical method is capable of solving equations for multicomponent systems of n species no matter to what extent the system shows stiffness. The model findings were compared and verified with the experimental data from literature for two systems of Na 2 SO 4 +NaCl and MgCl 2 +NaCl. Comparison showed great agreement for different concentrations. As such, the model is capable of predicting the rejection of different ions at various concentrations. The advantage of such a model is saving costs as a result of minimizing the number of required experiments, while it is closer to a realistic situation since the adsorption of ions has been taken into account. Using this model, the flux of permeates and rejections of multi-component liquid feeds can be calculated as a function of membrane properties. This simulation tool attempts to fill in the gap in methods used for predicting nanofiltration and optimization of the performance of charged nanofilters through generalized Maxwell-Stefan (GMS) approach. The application of the current model may weaken the latter gap, which has arisen due to the complexity of the fundamentals of ion transport processes via this approach, and may further facilitate the industrial development of\n\nStefan blowing effect on bioconvective flow of nanofluid over a solid rotating stretchable disk\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nN.A. Latiff\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available A mathematical model for the unsteady forced convection over rotating stretchable disk in nanofluid containing micro-organisms and taking into account Stefan blowing effect is presented theoretically and numerically. Appropriate transformations are used to transform the governing boundary layer equations into non-linear ordinary differential equations, before being solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method. The effect of the governing parameters on the dimensionless velocities, temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction (concentration, density of motile microorganisms as well as on the local skin friction, local Nusselt, Sherwood number and motile microorganisms numbers are thoroughly examined via graphs. It is observed that the Stefan blowing increases the local skin friction and reduces the heat transfer, mass transfer and microorganism transfer rates. The numerical results are in good agreement with those obtained from previous literature. Physical quantities results from this investigation show that the effects of higher disk stretching strength and suction case provides a good medium to enhance the heat, mass and microorganisms transfer compared to blowing case.\n\nJozef Stefan Institute annual report for 1986\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGams, M.\n\n1987-06-01\n\nThis report presents the main features of the Josef Stefan Institute work in the course of the year 1986.

His desire to see Brazil, in the 40âs, as a land free from the intolerance and violence that devastated Europe during World War II made Zweig revive the mythological image of the country as a paradisiacal land, a rediscovered Eden. His description of Brazil, rather than optimistic, acquires a prophetical aspect when he emphasizes the fact that the prevailing harmony and peace of the country made it a locus for the advent of a messianic and utopian future. Curiously, the writer/prophet often betrayed his prophecies, projecting in Brazil old European values, and sometimes contradicting himself as to the issue of tolerance and harmony that he witnessed in\n\nModelling of simultaneous mass and heat transfer with chemical reaction using the Maxwell-Stefan theory II.

An exact solution is constructed using Kummer functions in case that an inequality for the convective transfer coefficient is satisfied generalizing recent works for the corresponding one-phase free boundary problem. We also consider the limit to our problem when that coefficient goes to infinity obtaining a new free boundary problem, which has been recently studied in Zhou et al.

Core-shell models have been used to investigate the relationship between composition, viscosity and equilibration timescales. These models have traditionally relied on the Fickian laws of diffusion with no explicit account of non-ideal interactions. We introduce the Maxwell-Stefan diffusion framework as an alternative method, which explicitly accounts for non-ideal interactions through activity coefficients. e-folding time is the time it takes for the difference in surface and bulk concentration to change by an exponential factor and was used to investigate the interplay between viscosity and solubility and the effect this has on equilibration timescales within individual aerosol particles. The e-folding time was estimated after instantaneous increases in relative humidity to binary systems of water and an organic component. At low water mole fractions, viscous effects were found to dominate mixing. However, at high water mole fractions, equilibration times were more sensitive to a range in solubility, shown through the greater variation in e-folding times. This is the first time the Maxwell-Stefan framework has been applied to an atmospheric aerosol core-shell model and shows that there is a complex interplay between the viscous and solubility effects on aerosol composition that requires further investigation.\n\nStefan-Maxwell Relations and Heat Flux with Anisotropic Transport Coefficients for Ionized Gases in a Magnetic Field with Application to the Problem of Ambipolar Diffusion\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKolesnichenko, A. V.; Marov, M. Ya.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe defining relations for the thermodynamic diffusion and heat fluxes in a multicomponent, partially ionized gas mixture in an external electromagnetic field have been obtained by the methods of the kinetic theory. Generalized Stefan-Maxwell relations and algebraic equations for anisotropic transport coefficients (the multicomponent diffusion, thermal diffusion, electric and thermoelectric conductivity coefficients as well as the thermal diffusion ratios) associated with diffusion-thermal processes have been derived. The defining second-order equations are derived by the Chapman-Enskog procedure using Sonine polynomial expansions. The modified Stefan-Maxwell relations are used for the description of ambipolar diffusion in the Earth's ionospheric plasma (in the F region) composed of electrons, ions of many species, and neutral particles in a strong electromagnetic field.\n\nInterview about nuclear regulatory supervision with Stefan Mappus, Baden-Wuerttemberg State Minister for the Environment and for Transport; Interview zur Kernenergieaufsicht mit Stefan Mappus, Minister fuer Umwelt und Verkehr des Landes Baden-Wuerttemberg\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAnon.\n\n2005-02-01\n\nStefan Mappus, member of the Baden-Wuerttemberg State Parliament, has been State Minister for the Environment since July 14, 2004.

F.; Aniceto, J. P. S.; Silva, C. M.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCadmium(II) is a toxic hazardous cation, whose presence in the environment causes great concern because of its bioaccumulation in organisms and bio amplification along food chain. Hence, the removal of cadmium compounds from industrial waters and wastewaters is particularly essential, which requires intensive experimental and modelling studies to deal with the problem. In this work, the ion exchange of Cd\"2\"+ ions from aqueous solution using microporous titanosilicates (ETS-4 and ETS-10) has been modelled using adapted Maxwell-Stefan equations for the ions transport inside the sorbent particles. The fundamentals of the Maxwell-Stefan equations along with correlations for the convective mass transfer coefficients have been used with advantage to reduce the number of model parameters. In the whole, the model was able to represent successfully the kinetic behaviour of 11 independent and very distinct curves of both studied systems (Cd2\"+\"/Na\"+/ETS-4 and Cd\"2\"+/Na\"+/ ETS-10). The predictive capability of the model has been also shown, since several uptake curves were accurately predicted with parameters fitted previously to different sets of experimental data.\n\nMaxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficient estimation for ternary systems: an ideal ternary alcohol system.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAllie-Ebrahim, Tariq; Zhu, Qingyu; BrÃ¤uer, Pierre; Moggridge, Geoff D; D'Agostino, Carmine\n\n2017-06-21\n\nThe Maxwell-Stefan model is a popular diffusion model originally developed to model diffusion of gases, which can be considered thermodynamically ideal mixtures, although its application has been extended to model diffusion in non-ideal liquid mixtures as well. A drawback of the model is that it requires the Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients, which are not based on measurable quantities but they have to be estimated. As a result, numerous estimation methods, such as the Darken model, have been proposed to estimate these diffusion coefficients. However, the Darken model was derived, and is only well defined, for binary systems. This model has been extended to ternary systems according to two proposed forms, one by R. Krishna and J. M. van Baten, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2005, 44, 6939-6947 and the other by X. Liu, T. J. H. Vlugt and A. Bardow, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2011, 50, 10350-10358. In this paper, the two forms have been analysed against the ideal ternary system of methanol/butan-1-ol/propan-1-ol and using experimental values of self-diffusion coefficients. In particular, using pulsed gradient stimulated echo nuclear magnetic resonance (PGSTE-NMR) we have measured the self-diffusion coefficients in various methanol/butan-1-ol/propan-1-ol mixtures. The experimental values of self-diffusion coefficients were then used as the input data required for the Darken model. The predictions of the two proposed multicomponent forms of this model were then compared to experimental values of mutual diffusion coefficients for the ideal alcohol ternary system. This experimental-based approach showed that the Liu's model gives better predictions compared to that of Krishna and van Baten, although it was only accurate to within 26%. Nonetheless, the multicomponent Darken model in conjunction with self-diffusion measurements from PGSTE-NMR represents an attractive method for a rapid estimation of mutual diffusion in multicomponent systems, especially when compared to exhaustive\n\nImagining Afrikaners musically: Reflections on the âAfrican musicâ of Stefans GrovÃ©\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nS. J.

His own conception of himself as an African who composes African music challenges the inhibition of âwhiteâ Afrikaner culture and revivifies Afrikaner culture as African culture. In so doing, GrovÃ© is consciously subverting the myth of a united Africa over against a monolithic \"Westâ - and with it the legitimacy of an autochthonous echt African culture previously excluded by âwhites\" and Afrikaners.

The King's previous invasion of Macedonia, in the thirties, had been aimed directly towards Thessalonica and was a failure. Thus, in the second phase of his politics, in which Macedonia was used as a backing in the striving for the Empire, Thessalonica was temporarily left aside, although not before first Serres and then Berroia had been captured, so as to leave it completely isolated. Initially, it was Serres rather than Berroia that DuÅ¡an was focused on, its conquest in September 1345 leading immediately to the proclamation of the Empire. Afterwards â in the first half of 1346 â Berroia was also conquered and turned into an important Serbian stronghold, Thessalonica being thus cut off, which enabled the Serbs to await a more favorable time to capture it. At the same time, the conquest of Berroia paved the way for the Serbian invasion of Epirus and Thessalia. Emperor John VI Cantacuzenus was certainly aware of the consequences of such a strategic constellation. Thus, when he finally managed to neutralize the Zelots in Thessalonica, his first move towards the change of the situation was to recuperate Berroia and surrounding towns. This was such a severe blow for the Serbs, that it immediately became clear that even DuÅ¡an's imperial power might be endangered if his position in Macedonia further weakened. He reacted promptly and recaptured Berroia and other strongholds he had lost. The conquest of Berroia was lead by the nobleman Radoslav Hlapen, who first acted as a governor on behalf of DuÅ¡an, and after the death of the Emperor practically as an independent ruler of that part of Macedonia.\n\nCharacterization of a Cytokinin Response Factor in Arabidopsis thaliana\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKetelsen, Bernd\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe papers of this thesis are not available in Munin: 1.

This paper highlights and discusses ideological and aesthetical aspects in his recent novel, Den grÃ¶na cirkeln (2011 and its sequel, Under tiden (2012, from an ecocritical perspective. The novels combine environmental commitment with a dystopian story about four young people who survive a climate catastrophe but get lost in a world they no longer recognize and where ordinary logic does not seem to exist. The paper elucidates this process by a comparison with Buellâs (2001 concept of toxic discourse as there are several parallells, such as elements like a lost paradise, inescapable toxic, and the oppression of powerful societal interests, throughout the story. Simultaneously, ambivalence towards culture and civilization is expressed. Nature and culture become intertwined in a way that differs from the conventional dichotomy and this complexity is the supporting structure of the texts. The four teenagers, and even more so the following generation, become symbols of a new future, a pattern recognized from much dystopian as well as childrenâs fiction, where the weak and oppressed turn out to be the heroes. The optimistic and didactic ambition in this kind of dystopian stories is often aimed at creating an engagement for environmental issues and a sustainable future among young people. By placing the story in an imagined future as well as adding fantastic elements, Stefan Casta creates a kind of âVerfremdungseffektâ on phenomena we often do not question in our lifestyle. This could be a liberating relativization to the young readers; the social and cultural drives that rule many of our life choices are not essential and can therefore always be reconsidered.\n\nPodolsky electromagnetism and a modification in Stefan-Boltzmann law\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBonin, Carlos Alberto; Bufalo, Rodrigo Santos; Escobar, Bruto Max Pimentel; Zambrano, German Enrique Ramos [Instituto de Fisica Teorica (IFT/UNESP), Sao Paulo, SP (Brazil)\n\n2009-07-01\n\nFull text. As it is well-known, gauge fields that emerge from the gauge principle are massless vector fields. Considering the photon as a Proca particle, experience sets an upper limit on its mass. This limit is m{sub Proca} < 6X10{sup -17}eV (PDG 2006). However, a mass term, regardless how small, breaks the gauge symmetry. Nevertheless, there exists a theory in which is possible to introduce a mass term preserving all symmetries of Maxwell electromagnetism, including the gauge one: such theory is known as Podolsky Electromagnetism. Podolsky theory is a second- order-derivative theory and has some remarkable properties, despite those already mentioned: the theory has two sectors, a massive one and massless one, it depends on a free parameter (which happens to be the mass of the massive sector) that, like all other elementary particles's masses of the Standard Model, must be fixed through experiences, and the fact that the electrostatic potential is finite everywhere, including over a punctual charge. Just like Maxwell electromagnetism, Podolsky's is a constrained theory and, since it is of second order in the derivatives, it consists in a much richer theoretical structure. Therefore, from both, theoretical and experimental points of view, Podolsky electromagnetism is a very attractive theory. In this work we study a gas of Podolsky photons at finite temperature through path integration. We show that the massless sector leads to the famous Planck's law for black-body radiation and, therefore, to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. We also show that the massive sector of the Podolsky theory induces a modification in both these laws. It is possible to set limits on the Podolsky parameter through comparison of our results with data from cosmic microwave background radiation.

Stavitskiy\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article presents the theoretical study results of platinum workability by electrical discharge machining (EDM, based on the solution of the thermal problem of moving the boundary of material change phase, i.e. Stefan problem. The problem solution enables defining the surface melt penetration of the material under the heat flow proceeding from the time of its action and the physical properties of the processed material. To determine the rational EDM operating conditions of platinum the article suggests relating its workability with machinability of materials, for which the rational EDM operating conditions are, currently, defined. It is shown that at low densities of the heat flow corresponding to the finishing EDM operating conditions, the processing conditions used for steel 45 are appropriate for platinum machining; with EDM at higher heat flow densities (e.g. 50 GW / m2 for this purpose copper processing conditions are used; at the high heat flow densities corresponding to heavy roughing EDM it is reasonable to use tungsten processing conditions. The article also represents how the minimum width of the current pulses, at which platinum starts melting and, accordingly, the EDM process becomes possible, depends on the heat flow density. It is shown that the processing of platinum is expedient at a pulse width corresponding to the values, called the effective pulse width. Exceeding these values does not lead to a substantial increase in removal of material per pulse, but considerably reduces the maximum repetition rate and therefore, the EDM capacity. The paper shows the effective pulse width versus the heat flow density.

The zirconium ions are found to be 8 fold coordinated with fluoride ions for all temperatures and concentrations. All the diffusive flux correlations show back-scattering. Even though the MS diffusivities are expected to depend very lightly on the composition because of decoupling of thermodynamic factor, the diffusivity Ä{sub Na-F} shows interesting behavior with the increase in concentration of ZrF{sub 4}. This is because of network formation in NaF-ZrF{sub 4}.

[High Pressure & Synchrotron Radiation Physics Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai-400085 (India)\n\n2015-06-24\n\nApplying GreenâKubo formalism and equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have studied the dynamic correlation, Onsager coeeficients and MaxwellâStefan (MS) Diffusivities of molten salt LiF-BeF{sub 2}, which is used as coolant in high temperature reactor. All the diffusive flux correlations show back-scattering or cage dynamics which becomes pronouced at higher temperature. Although the MS diffusivities are expected to depend very lightly on the composition due to decoupling of thermodynamic factor, the diffusivity Ä{sub Li-F} and Ä{sub Be-F} decreases sharply for higher concentration of LiF and BeF{sub 2} respectively. Interestingly, all three MS diffusivities have highest magnitude for eutectic mixture at 1000K (except Ä{sub Be-F} at lower LiF mole fraction) which is desirable from coolant point of view. Although the diffusivity for positive-positive ion pair is negative it is not in violation of the second law of thermodynamics as it satisfies the non-negative entropic constraints.\n\nThe Generalized Maxwell-Stefan Model Coupled with Vacancy Solution Theory of Adsorption for Diffusion in Zeolites\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSeyyed Milad Salehi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available It seems using the Maxwell-Stefan (M-S diffusion model in combination with the vacancy solution theory (VST and the single-component adsorption data provides a superior, qualitative, and quantitative prediction of diffusion in zeolites. In the M-S formulation, thermodynamic factor (Ð is an essential parameter which must be estimated by an adsorption isotherm. Researchers usually utilize the simplest form of adsorption isotherms such as Langmuir or improved dual-site Langmuir, which eventually cannot predict the real behavior of mixture diffusion particularly at high concentrations of adsorbates because of ignoring nonideality in the adsorbed phase. An isotherm model with regard to the real behavior of the adsorbed phase, which is based on the vacancy solution theory (VST and considers adsorbate-adsorbent interactions, is employed. The objective of this study is applying vacancy solution theory to pure component data, calculating thermodynamic factor (Ð, and finally evaluating the simulation results by comparison with literature. Vacancy solution theory obviously predicts thermodynamic factor better than simple models such as dual-site Langmuir.\n\nDESCRIPCIÃN Y ANÃLISIS DE LOS HALLAZGOS DE LAS INVESTIGACIONES HECHAS POR STEFAN TENGBLAD SOBRE LA PRÃCTICA DIRECTIVA HASTA EL AÃO 2014\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nDulce Romero, Claudia Patricia; Sierra CagÃ¼eÃ±as, SebastiÃ¡n\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSe realizÃ³ el anÃ¡lisis de ocho artÃ­culos y un libro escrito por el profesor Stefan Tengblad desde el 2000 hasta el 2012.

S.; Kantzas, A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nDue to the steep production decline in unconventional gas reservoirs, enhanced recovery (ER) methods are receiving great attention from the industry. Wet gas or liquid rich reservoirs are the preferred ER candidates due to higher added value from natural gas liquids (NGL) production. ER in these reservoirs has the potential to add reserves by improving desorption and displacement of hydrocarbons through the medium. Nevertheless, analysis of gas transport at length scales of tight reservoirs is complicated because concomitant mechanisms are in place as pressure declines. In addition to viscous and Knudsen diffusion, multicomponent gas modeling includes competitive adsorption and molecular diffusion effects. Most models developed to address these mechanisms involve single component or binary mixtures. In this study, ER by gas injection is investigated in multicomponent (C1, C2, C3 and C4+, CO2 and N2) wet gas reservoirs. The competing effects of Knudsen and molecular diffusion are incorporated by using Maxwell-Stefan equations and the Dusty-Gas approach. This model was selected due to its superior properties on representing the physics of multicomponent gas flow, as demonstrated during the presented model validation. Sensitivity studies to evaluate adsorption, reservoir permeability and gas type effects are performed. The importance of competitive adsorption on production and displacement times is demonstrated. In the absence of adsorption, chromatographic separation is negligible. Production is merely dictated by competing effects between molecular and Knudsen diffusion. Displacement fronts travel rapidly across the medium. When adsorption effects are included, molecules with lower affinity to the adsorption sites will be produced faster. If the injected gas is inert (N2), an increase in heavier fraction composition occurs in the medium. During injection of adsorbing gases (CH4 and CO2), competitive adsorption effects will contribute to improved recovery of heavier\n\nWeber Stefan, Damascus.

Absorption of some decontaminant components proceed concurrently with extraction of the CWA, resulting in multicomponent diffusion in the polymer. In this work, the Maxwell-Stefan equations were used with the Flory-Huggins model of species activity to mathematically describe the transport of two species within a polymer. This model was used to predict the extraction of the nerve agent O-ethyl S-[2(diisopropylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothioate (VX) from a silicone elastomer into both water and methanol. Comparisons with experimental results show good agreement with minimal fitting of model parameters from pure component uptake data. Reaction of the extracted VX with sodium hydroxide in the liquid-phase was also modeled and used to predict the overall rate of destruction of VX. Although the reaction proceeds more slowly in the methanol-based solution compared to the aqueous solution, the extraction rate is faster due to increasing VX mobility as methanol absorbs into the silicone, resulting in an overall faster rate of VX destruction.\n\nMaxwellâStefan diffusion and dynamical correlation in molten LiF-KF: A molecular dynamics study\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nJain, Richa Naja, E-mail: ltprichanaja@gmail.com; Chakraborty, Brahmananda; Ramaniah, Lavanya M. [High Pressure & Synchrotron Radiation Physics Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai-85 (India)\n\n2016-05-23\n\nIn this work our main objective is to compute Dynamical correlations, Onsager coefficients and Maxwell-Stefan (MS) diffusivities for molten salt LiF-KF mixture at various thermodynamic states through GreenâKubo formalism for the first time. The equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using BHM potential for LiFâKF mixture. The velocity autocorrelations functions involving Li ions reflect the endurance of cage dynamics or backscattering with temperature. The magnitude of Onsager coefficients for all pairs increases with increase in temperature. Interestingly most of the Onsager coefficients has almost maximum magnitude at the eutectic composition indicating the most dynamic character of the eutectic mixture. MS diffusivity hence diffusion for all ion pairs increases in the system with increasing temperature. Smooth variation of the diffusivity values denies any network formation in the mixture. Also, the striking feature is the noticeable concentration dependence of MS diffusivity between cation-cation pair, Ä{sub Li-K} which remains negative for most of the concentration range but changes sign to become positive for higher LiF concentration. The negative MS diffusivity is acceptable as it satisfies the non-negative entropy constraint governed by 2{sup nd} law of thermodynamics. This high diffusivity also vouches the candidature of molten salt as a coolant.\n\nBelgrade as new Jerusalem: Reflections on the reception of a topos in the age of despot Stefan LazareviÄ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nErdeljan Jelena\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In the Vita of despot Stefan LazareviÄ, Belgrade is compared to Jerusalem The use of this topos is aimed at a social construction of meaning within the framework of historically determined cultural discourse, based on the premise that culture itself can be observed as a complex system of signs constantly open to redefinition. This implies that the approach to its more profound understanding must rely on a method based on reconceptualization of the problem of text and context. Therefore, the true object of investigation becomes the relation between text and society whose activities are themselves perceived as a sort of behavioral text, in which that relation functions as two homologous systems of signs. As a result, our attention is focused on activities which produce social and cultural phenomena and objects â actually on the means by the use of which a world filled with meaning is created. Apart from texts, those means, as real as the text itself, belong to the instruments of creating sacred space or hierotopy, a phenomenon historically recognized as translatio Hierosolymi. Beyond any doubt, in the eyes of homo medievalis, the absolute paradigm of hierotopic activity is Constantinople the capital of the Empire and universal model through the emulation of which or through the appropriation of whose elements of identity (ranging from cults of saints to visual identity throughout history, and in particular in the later middle ages (especially following the events of 1204, a growing number of other points in the Christian oikoumene gains the status of center as a God-chosen and God-protected place â Arta, Trebizond and Nicea, Paris and Venice, Novgorod and Moscow, to name just the most prominent examples In investigating the case of Belgrade, attention is focused on the modes and vehicles of hierotopy which in the days of despot Stefan LazareviÄ (1402-1427 were laid as the foundation of likening Belgrade and Jerusalem as the utmost example of\n\nKÃµigepealt tuleb moraal / Bernd Ulrich\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nUlrich, Bernd\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAutor selgitab, et kliimamuutused asetavad inimkonna enneolematusse olukorda, mis tingib meie eluviisi ja majanduse radikaalse muutuse.

The Botanic Garden established by Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert (1741â1814 in 1781 (or, actually, from 1782 survived the loss of independence by Poland (1795, and a later closure of the University (1832, and it continued to function until 1842, when it was shut down by Russian authorities. After Poland had regained independence and the University was reopened as the Stefan Batory University (SBU, its Botanic Garden was established on a new location (1919, active since 1920. It survived as a Polish institution until 1939. After the Second World War, as a result of changed borders, it found itself in the Soviet Union, and from 1990 â in the Republic of Lithuania. A multidisciplinary research project has been recently launched with the aim to create a publication on the history of science at the Stefan Batory University. The botanical part of the project includes, among others, drafting the history of the Botanic Garden. Obtaining electronic copies of archival documents, e.g. annual reports written by the directors, enabled a more thorough analysis of the Gardenâs history.

To boost the epithermal neutron flux at the reference irradiation point, the efficiency of a fission plate with almost 1.5 kg of 20% enriched uranium and 2.3 kW of thermal power is investigated. With the same purpose in mind, the TRIGA reactor core setup is optimized, and standard fresh fuel elements are concentrated partly in the outermost ring of the core. Further, a detailed parametric study of the materials and dimensions for all the relevant parts of the irradiation facility is carried out. Some of the standard epithermal neutron filter/moderator materials, as well as 'pressed-only' low-density Al 2 O 3 and AlF 3 , are considered. The proposed version of the BNCT facility, with PbF 2 as the epithermal neutron filter/moderator, provides an epithermal neutron flux of â¼1.1 x 10 9 n/cm 2 .s, thus enabling patient irradiation times of nfast /Ï epi -13 Gy.cm 2 /n and [overdot]D Î³ /Ï epi -13 Gy.cm 2 /n), the in-air performances of the proposed beam are comparable to all existing epithermal BNCT facilities.

We use our results to extend the scaling relations obtained at low Stefan number and establish the correlation between the melting front propagation and the Stefan number for fully-developed convection.

In particular, this specific Stefan problem is of interest when studying corium pool behavior in the framework of light water reactor severe accident analysis. The objective of this research is to analyze the applicability of different approximations related to the modeling of the solid phase in terms of boundary heat flux closure relations. Three different approximations are considered: a quadratic profile based model, a model where a parameter controls the power partitioning at the interface and the steady state conduction assumption. These models are compared with an accurate front-tracking solution of this plane fusion front problem. This âreferenceâ is obtained by combining the same integral conservation equations as the approximate models with a mesh-based solution of the 1D heat equation. Numerical results are discussed for a typical configuration of interest for corium pool analysis. Different fusion transients (constructed from nondimensionalization considerations in terms of Biot and Stefan numbers) are used in order to highlight the potential and limitations of the different approximations.\n\nEntering of Stefan DuÅ¡an into the Empire\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPirivatriÄ SrÄan\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available At the moment when, in October 1341, a new Civil War broke out in the Byzantium after the death of Andronicus III, the traditional views of the imperial power and the Empire underwent considerable changes. The powers of the co-rulers had been on the rise since 1272, and during the Civil War of 1321-1328 the Byzantine Empire was in effect divided, that is, two Basileis were ruling 'imperially' (autokratorikÅs over their respective territories within the formally unified Empire, under the scope of relations of Superior basileus - co-basileus. Therefore, the Empire (autokratoria, imperium could multiply in the sense of rulersâ authorities, and be divided in the sense of territoriality. The imperial power and the Empire became subject to family relations and family law. In view of the family connections between the Byzantine Emperors (basileis autokratores and the monarchs of the neighboring countries and nations, the right to succession was being used as an argument in some disputes between the rulers. The Byzantine law, that is the Byzantine political views, allowed for the possibility of the so-called 'joint rule' (e oikeia arch by a Byzantine basileus autokrator and some other, foreign member of the dynasty ruling over certain region of the Byzantine Empire - a foreign ruler would be allowed to rule on condition that the Byzantine basileus be recognized as the supreme master. This scenario is known from one recorded dispute between the Byzantine basileus Andronicus III and the Bulgarian tsar Michael Assen III dating from 1328, when the Bulgarian Emperor did not accept the Byzantine rule, however. All these circumstances are of special importance since they directly precede the King Stefan DuÅ¡anâs involvement in the Civil War, that is, his later entering into the Empire. The first phase of DuÅ¡anâs involvement in the Civil War is typically conquering and opportunistic in nature, with the aim of immediate territorial enlargement.

After a discussion of the state of the filed special emphasis will be made on the role of transfer matrix (the Stefan matrix) both in deriving the grammar from known symbolic dynamics and in extracting the rules from experimental data. The block structure of the Stefan matrix may serve as another indicator of complexity of the associated dynamics.

The waste was first thoroughly characterised, then the radionuclides present solidified by appropriate chemical treatment, and the final product separated and prepared for storage in compliance with the legislation. The activities were carried out within the recently renewed Hot Cells Facility of the Jozef Stefan Institute and the overall process resulted in substantial volume reduction of the waste initially present.

In the latter case, you may wish to get another perspective or some guidance before taking steps. Â Stefan, Paul and Lucas work together on a challenging project. Over time, Lucas has started to notice Paulâs verbally aggressive behaviour towards Stefan: he frequently criticises him in public, cuts him short at meetings when he is trying to make his point and is known to make derogatory remarks about him behind his back. Stefan does not seem to react but the tension between them is evident and Lucas feels increasingly uncomfortable in their company. It is never easy to know whether or not to intervene in these delicate situations, and the âbystander effectâ - where people do nothing - tends to prevail in most workplace cultures. Bystanders hesitate to act because th...\n\nLaser-Neuron Interaction with Femtosecond Beat-Modulated 800-1200 nm Photon Beams, as the Treatment of Brain Cancer Tissue. Laser Neurophysics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStefan, V. Alexander\n\n2011-03-01\n\nI propose a novel mechanism for the brain cancer tissue treatment: nonlinear interaction of ultrashort pulses of beat-photon, (Ï1 -- Ï2) , or double-photon, (Ï1 +Ï2) , beams with the cancer tissue. The multiphoton scattering is described via photon diffusion equation. The open-scull cerebral tissue can be irradiated with the beat-modulated photon pulses with the laser irradiances in the range of a few mW/cm2 , and repetition rate of a few 100s Hz generated in the beat-wave driven free electron laser.
