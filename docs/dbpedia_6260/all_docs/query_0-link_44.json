        "text": "This in-conversation was held on 1 April, 2019 at the Barbican and hosted by curator Florence Ostende on the occasion of Martin’s exhibition Tonight the World in the Curve Gallery between Thu 31 Jan—Sun 7 Apr 2019.\n\nThe full video can be watched here.\n\nLaura Mulvey: I just wanted to say what a very rich work, I think, Tonight the World is, how complex it is: its variety of media; its visual references brought together, framing its extraordinary central panel made up of the five segments of the dream films. And although other media contribute to Tonight the World, film is so central to the work and it’s going to be central to our discussion as well. And we’re going to focus on the filmic aspects of the exhibition rather perhaps slightly one-sidedly. But I think the film medium, with which Daria has translated her grandmother Susi’s dreams into material form, is also part of a long tradition of interaction and dialogue between film and dream, going back very much, as people probably can recognize, to the surrealists and one remembers the favorite surrealist image of the sleeping figure in a hotel room under a notice on the door: Poet at Work. Daria draws on film history, on film theory, taking the initial translation into dialogue with a wide range of references that we’re going to be discussing –but I think that dream is also a reminder of the flexibility of film and the former film’s ability to depict confusions and uncertainties of time. So these uncertainties of temporality escape the linear, and offer us multiple other ways of thinking about the figuration of time and the place of time in all our imaginative formations.\n\nSo I want to start by asking Daria to tell us a bit about your grandmother, Susi, your relationship with her and how she came to be such an important source to your work. I think you actually said that it was through Susi that you came to be an artist.\n\nDaria Martin: Thank you for that, Laura. Yes, my grandmother Susi was a great inspiration to me and also somebody who troubled me greatly in equal measure. She was an artist herself, a painter. She made expansive, spacious, color field paintings, and my time spent with her in her studio as a child set the foundations for my later desire to become an artist.\n\nShe was also somebody who ignited in me a curiosity about the life of the mind. She was a rather brilliant intellect, not unlike you, Laura. But she also had a rather dreamy, ethereal side. By the time I was born, she had been in Jungian analysis therapy for several years. And at the dinner table she would talk to me about Jungian theories, about universal archetypes, these underlying symbols and feelings that she felt were universal, and about the capacity of delving into one’s own unconscious as a means to realize one’s full potential.\n\nAnd I was aware meantime that she was keeping this daily dream diary initially in support of her therapy. This went on for half of her life for about forty years. It was a meticulous daily process of recording every dream: typed, organized. And when she died, this was left to [the family], and she had given us permission to look at it. So this vast archive of about 20,000 dreams was one starting point.\n\nLM: 20,000 dreams. But can I just take you back a little bit? Because Susi went into her analysis when she was middle aged and was suffering from a certain depression, but there was also the legacy of her traumatic childhood.\n\nDM: That’s right.\n\nLM: And if you might say where she grew up.\n\nDM: Susi was somebody who had quite a lot of privilege in her life. She, after all, had the time to sit down and record her dreams every morning, go into analysis, paint, etc. But she’s somebody who also suffered. She grew up the child of Jewish industrialists in Brno, Czechoslovakia. When she was sixteen, the family had to evacuate, and moved initially to England and then to Brazil, and finally to California, where they settled.\n\nAnd this trauma of her forced migration was something that was put on ice for many years, and I believe, was reignited in her middle age, when she went through a crisis of severe depression.\n\nLM: To finish off this introduction to the family background, if you could bring your own presence in and tell us about your return to the house, and how this return changed your emotional relationship to Susi’s stories.\n\nDM: Yes, another disturbance. Yeah, the starting points for the [Barbican] exhibition were the diaries and the house in which my grandmother lived. The diaries encompass everything from her forties through her eighties, and recycle all sorts of references. But the five dreams in the exhibition specifically were dreams about her childhood home in in Brno, Czechoslovakia.\n\nAnd about two years ago, I was invited back to my grandmother’s childhood home by the Czech Heritage Institute, who had at that point inherited the house and had renovated it, and were reopening it to the public as a sort of museum of modernist architecture.\n\nAnd we showed up at the House and we were greeted by a panel of well-wishers. And we three family members were already far outnumbered. And then this press corps arrived; a group of photographers and reporters with microphones and they snapped pictures, and asked us questions. And then we were invited out to the garden where we were asked to plant a tree and a banner popped up as if from nowhere. We’re invited back into the dining room. More pictures were taken and then something rather strange happened: someone pulled out a folder, a photograph. And I recognized this old black and white portrait vaguely as an ancestor, right? I thought it was my grandmother’s grandmother, which it turned out to be. And the person presenting it was telling me something in Czech and I raised up the photo obediently and the flash came, and the picture was taken, smiling, and only at that point did the translation to English come through: this photograph was being returned to our family from the Gestapo archives where it had been sitting for decades as evidence of my great-great-grandmother’s capture by the Nazis.\n\nAnd only in this moment, in which I was being photographed, did I learn for the first time that my grandmother’s grandmother had been murdered in the concentration camps.\n\nLM: And so that moment of sudden alienation, from the ritual that you were undergoing, gave you a new desire in a sense, to repossess the story.\n\nDM: Yes, exactly. As I digested all of the feelings stirred up by this visit, I wanted very much to get back behind the camera to make my own images and, in a sense, to reclaim the house for myself, to restore something, perhaps to repair something.\n\nLM: I think at this moment we would like to show one of the dreams that Daria has selected for our discussion, which will give those of you who haven’t seen any, a chance to see the dream. And also this particular dream is going to be a kind of central focus for our conversation. [Film clip from Tonight the World].\n\nNow, Daria, I think it would be really nice if you could also read some of the text of the dream so we could put the image and Susi’s original together.\n\nDM: Yes, exactly so. It begins with a discussion about the fussy and old-fashioned furniture in the house, and then it continues:\n\n‘The children who share the back bedroom with us have discovered that they can poke holes with straws into the stucco of the curving wall above the fireplace. I poke a bigger hole and I see lots of eyes inside, like some small mammals, a nest of some kind perhaps.\n\n‘I stick my arm in and rip a big hole and see that it is people. I call in that we are the Korean Army. The kids think that this is a mistake and that I should not give them too much information till I find out who they are.\n\n‘Actually, the Korean Army isn’t us, but they’re just outside the house. I poke all the way through and see a stout, small man in grey pants and sleeveless undershirt, domestic looking, as though he were just going to another small room within the wall to where his family is.’\n\nAnd then she has some comments about it and associations.\n\nEssentially, [for the film] I’ve added some things and taken some things away. One of the main changes is in the pacing of the dream. In what I’ve just read to you, there’s a moment in which she digresses and slows down and talks about the side conversation with the kids: ‘And actually, I’m not the Korean Army. The Korean Army is outside.’ I’ve elided that and allowed for a more, one could say, conventional build-up of suspense and then deflation.\n\nLM: I’d like to continue with some really practical, but very significant choices that you made in staging this. First of all, the performances, the casting, who the characters are: could you talk to us a little bit about that?\n\nDM: Well, the central challenge here was to lift these dreams off the page. They’re vividly described in a great detail, but this is only black text on white paper. To really embody the dreams and give them sculptural heft and space and life and sense was my challenge. So the first task was to cast the dreams, and I decided to allow Susi to be embodied by four actresses of four different generations who also play all the other parts, including the men.\n\nLM: And the boys?\n\nDM: And the boys, yeah. And this started off as something of a practical consideration because we had to fly everyone out to Brno and a nice small cast of four was quite economical. But also, I think it hints at the sense that within our dreams we populate them with many figures who appear to be familiar to us, but who also might be parts of ourselves in a sense.\n\nLM: Yes.\n\nDM: But I also wondered whether that flexibility of gender and subjectivity had something to do with some of your own ideas about the instability of gender in spectators of film.\n\nLM: Yeah, I think that there’s a way in which I argued in my old essay that the female spectator was absorbed into the masculine orientated language of the film itself, so that was to do with the actual language of film, but that was particularly about Hollywood; it wasn’t about cinema in general. And here I think you seem to be almost commenting on the instability of spectator’s positioning. Nowadays, I think the spectator is much more able to shift, change, kind of chameleon-like, from gender to gender, from position to position, different kinds of identification. And certainly, in a film like yours, I see the oddness of the gender as something which is almost commenting on playing with that.\n\nBut then there’s also an instability of generations as well, which is not something that I’ve ever commented on. Do you want to say something about the way in which gender and play with gender leads on to play with intergenerational identity?\n\nDM: Yeah, a central part of the process of making the film was the sense of play amongst these four actresses of different generations, and a sense of collectively creating or recreating this figure of my grandmother, not in a singular identity –not one actress embodying her solely, but spread across these, well it’s three older actresses and the youngest implies her without actually ever playing her.\n\nThis was also one of the most restorative aspects of the film’s creation. The different generations imply different times at which she was writing her diaries, perhaps, but I think they also imply generations, including her, my parent, and myself within a family.\n\nLM: Yes, exactly. I was very interested in the way that you seem here to be referring to the genre of melodrama. You have the kind of comfortable bourgeois interior that you associate with the Hollywood domestic melodrama. But also, you have this sense –this is both in the original dream and in your film– a sense of the uncanniness of the domestic interior. I have things I could say about this, but would you like to comment on it?\n\nDM: Let’s both talk about it. Yes, certainly the house in this film is a crucible for fears and desires. The scene implies the suppressed longings and frustrations that a woman at home might feel and how that could be played out within the family. And because the dreams within Tonight the World are selected for their containment by my grandmother’s house –I was scanning these 20,000 dreams for references to Brno and specifically to the house– all of these dreams do play out within the house. So it is a hothouse for repressed desire.\n\nLM: And then there’s that extraordinary, slightly uncanny interior decoration, seeing that this house is famous for its modernist architecture. It was celebrated in as part of Czech heritage for its modernist architecture but Susi’s mother insisted on decorating it in this chintzy, insistently feminine, Victorian way…\n\nDM: Yes, absolutely. At the beginning of this clip you see the actress tinkering with a ceramic figurine, and my great-grandmother really had crammed this functionalist house with knick knacks and floral curtains and all of that. So it doesn’t make for a great site of modernist tourism, but as a film set, it’s fabulous, yeah?\n\nLM: Yes, exactly. And it does resonate with the way in which the melodrama constructs the domestic interior as claustrophobic and that claustrophobic interior then leads on suggestively to the idea of the interiority of the psyche, the interiority of the woman’s repressed feelings, her inability to express herself –which in traditional melodrama criticism, feminist criticism –well, actually it goes back to Thomas Elsaesser– is understood as a genre and an aesthetic of displacement. So what the repressed interior, the tense family relations, cannot express between themselves in melodrama tends to be displaced onto lighting or objects like Susi and the figurine, and then suddenly an explosion of the melodramatic excess. You have [in Tonight the World] the gramophone which epitomises the object of display, but also suddenly becomes an object of the uncanny and anxiety…\n\nDM: Absolutely.\n\nLM: …and the abject in a sense.\n\nDM: Oh yeah, well, you said it beautifully. Yes, I think the salience of objects is something that has always interested me as a filmmaker –the way that people can become like objects and objects can become like people. And here I think yes, the gramophone, most obviously, but also let’s say the toy soldier figurines, the glove that she pulls out of the hole: These objects all seem to have some sort of import that doesn’t have a narrative driver. I think it was Freud who talked about how, in dreams as opposed to waking life, sometimes there’s an unexpected reversal of emotional salience. So a massive event in a dream might be played quite lightly, and might not be felt so strongly as it would in life, while some small detail might fill one with horror or joy.\n\nLM: And then of course, the space does become strange, uncanny, and so on. And, in order to move on to the space of the house as uncanny and anxiety provoking, I’d like you to say a word about the scene from The Birds that you mentioned to me as a point of reference.\n\nDM: So, in pacing this scene, one inspiration was perhaps the first manifestation of a particular horror trope in Hitchcock’s The Birds. There’s a scene in which Tippi Hedren hears something, it’s upstairs. She slowly approaches. She turns a door handle, she looks, we look with her, there are shadows, she’s fearful but curious and we feel the same way, and she must move slowly with trepidation and caution. Finally, in the attic she finds a huge hole in the ceiling and all the birds fly out and attack her. This kind of scene in which we move very slowly and hesitantly with the protagonist towards the object of both fear and fascination…\n\nLM: I think— sorry to interrupt, Daria, but I think it’s called the Hitchcockian Moving Point-of-View Shot. [laughter]\n\nDM: OK, good.\n\nLM: Where, you see Melanie moving slowly forwards and then the camera then moves steadily forward with her…\n\nDM: With her, yes…\n\nLM: Then a reverse shot and so on. Gradually incorporating us, the spectator, into this very kind of anxiety-provoking but curiosity-driven—\n\nDM: Yes, yes, it’s the slow movement forward together —isn’t it?— that creates that suspense. We are moving towards something that we both want to see but also dread seeing.\n\nLM: Maria Walsh mentions in her essay in the [Barbican] catalogue the genre of ‘the woman’s film’. This is often a woman who is haunted by the past, or is persecuted by her husband who is inventing a haunting, But that sense of the topography of the house, the attic as somewhere that’s uncanny and not part of the house, not part of its lived, everyday bits, as it were. I think that although The Birds is not that genre, there’s something of that sense of the space of the house, and whether that discovery of something hidden, behind the wall, when Susi blasts through the wall, kicks it down… I just mentioned, in melodrama theory, there’s always the sense of a displacement of an idea onto an object, which is drawn directly from Freud’s ‘Interpretation of Dreams’. So if you could just talk to us a little bit about the way that displacement and condensation are working here; it takes us across melodrama and into the dream and through to your staging of it.\n\nDM: Yes. A lot to digest there, but to start I would say that I think we all have certain dreams in common, dreams in which our teeth are falling out, dreams in which we show up to an event in our nightgown, and I think another very common dream is one in which we’re in our own house or familiar space and we see that there’s an extra room or an extra wing to the house; there’s something more to be discovered, and it’s surprising. I’m sure it wouldn’t take a psychoanalyst to point towards these extra rooms as referring to the unconscious, or to parts of our psyches to which we don’t have immediate access. In terms of displacement and condensation: my understanding again of displacement, as Freud describes it, is that in a dream, the true meaning or event or feeling would be displaced onto another object…\n\nLM: Yes, exactly…\n\nDM: …which it resembles.\n\nLM: …and partly because the original idea is difficult, painful…\n\nDM: …too intense…\n\nLM: …repressed, and so it has to find a way of displacing itself onto something that can come to the surface.\n\nDM: …that will appear readily…\n\nLM: I think it’s condensation that’s particularly interesting in this scene, isn’t it?\n\nDM: Yes. Condensation meaning that there are multiple difficult feelings that all condense into one symbol, so that when one retrospectively unpicks the dream, there are multiple things that can come out of a single symbol. And I think that’s very true of the appearance of this man inside the wall at the end of the clip that you saw. In fact, I chose the five dreams that we see in the exhibition precisely for the sense that there is at least a double, if not a multiple, layering of meaning to the main symbols. And specifically, I chose dreams that had symbols that seemed to point towards the history of the Holocaust, on one hand, but also that pointed in a completely different direction. So, the man inside the wall could be a Jew hiding during the war, like Anne Frank did, inside walls, under floorboards and hidden in rooms. It could be that, but he could also simply be a worker going about his life as he seems to be in the dream. My grandmother, in her diaryassociations, talks about her own grandparents being of this proletariat class, and how one only had to scratch the surface of the wallpaper to see back to that generation.\n\nLM: So in her self analysis, [Susi] says: this could have been my grandfather.\n\nDM: Yeah, yeah.\n\nLM: Yes, but the association with hiding during the Holocaust, was your association. One that you could easily link with her.\n\nDM: Yes exactly. I’m applying my own interpretation.\n\nLM: But it’s very complex because one thinks, to begin with, that there’s something menacing behind the wall. So it’s actually a series of shifts, a number of different associations all condensing in the image.\n\nDM: Absolutely. And this is why the dream itself was such a wonderful ‘found object’. It implies this incredible build-up of fear, and then this wonderful, almost comic deflation of that fear.\n\nLM: Something that’s of interest to me, of my generation, is the reference to the Korean Army, which places it completely in the early 50s and gives us another kind of dimension. But that’s just one of the ways in which these meanings, in sense, float and connect… Now, when we’re talking about the melodrama, we’re talking about a female protagonist, but a female protagonist who’s very much trapped in a situation of which the domestic space represents that kind of trapped-ness and also her interiority, her own psyche. But we wanted to move on to the way in which these kinds of stories can open up to a more active female protagonist, an investigator, and you’ve said that Susi did detective work on her soul. Would you like to say something about the question of investigation, curiosity, narrative?\n\nDM: Yes, absolutely. So following on from melodrama you also have the whole genre of horror, where women may be trapped in a house and murdered. But there’s a growing –largely series-based– genre that is almost a hybrid of the investigative crime drama on one hand and horror on the other, in which a female detective or reporter is investigating her own troubles– going back to Helen Mirren and Prime Suspect.\n\nLM: You said you’ve been watching Jane Campion’s Top of the Lake.\n\nDM: For me, that’s one of the more successful outings in this genre. You have Elisabeth Moss’s character investigating the disappearance of a young girl. And over time we realize that the passion with which she’s investigating this is bound up in her own traumatic history. And we see short flashes of that history, and then they become longer and longer and build up through time until the two stories tie together and reveal a new meaning. In this new genre the investigator is herself wounded and has her own horrific story to uncover.\n\nLM: So you mean there’s a double pattern here, one the way in which the detective story is always based on going back to an earlier moment in time – so for instance, there’s moment A when a crime is committed, and then there’s later a moment B, from which the detective has to return, to go back to the beginning and figure out how to make Point A fit with point B. But also, in your case you’re describing, the female detective is also self-analyzing as as it were. Or the film itself is investigating her own past. There’s an interior investigation of her interiority and also an investigation of some outside wound…\n\nDM: Yeah. She out to vanquish the murderer, or the perpetrator, but she’s also dealing with her own internal story at the same time. And the two come together.\n\nLM: Yes, exactly. This is really just an aside, but whereas nowadays you do have Wonder Woman, you know, active female protagonists, heroines who become heroes, traditionally a female protagonist has been much more a detective. Going right way back to fairy stories, action hasn’t been so open to her, but the process of detection always has, and we can think of women detective story writers for as long as the genre has existed.\n\nDaria, time is carrying on, and so I’d like to move on to another series of questions but also just to recapitulate a little bit where we are: which is the way in which the dream itself confuses time, confuses objects and fragments into a puzzle which someone –the dreamer, or the psychoanalyst– has to decipher. And also in the melodrama, the theory has always been that the spectator is a decipherer of what’s happening on the screen. So in a sense, what I’d like to bring together is this idea of the deciphering spectator, a deciphering investigator, but also, as you’ve pointed out, the way in which the detective genre confuses time. It’s about temporality.\n\nDM: Yes. Is this a good time to bring in afterwardsness?\n\nLM: Yes, well, just before we get to that, I’d just like to ask you a couple of things. Do we, how much? We’ve got five minutes. It’s a bit of a challenge. [Laughter] We could take it. Five minutes, we can do it. But I did want to ask before we just round up with questions of time, I’d wanted to ask Daria to talk very specifically about the way she worked with her own practice, her own theory. Do you think about the gaze of the camera? Do you think about… do you think about my old theories and things like that?\n\nDM:\n\nAbsolutely, and —where to start?— in some earlier films, I very strongly, and almost didactically, contrasted a voyeuristic gaze, one in which a wide-angle camera with a great depth of focus takes in the whole scene at once, with another sort of camera’s gaze, which was much more haptic and caressing and intimate and intersubjective. In Tonight the World those types of looking have integrated more. But one kind of shot that might be interesting to mention, is one that appears twice in this clip, and once elsewhere in the film, in which the protagonist enters her own point of view; it creates a rather uncanny effect. The protagonist looks; cut to her point of view, possibly moving with her; and then, unexpectedly, she enters that shot. It’s not my invention, I think maybe Tarkovsky invented it, but it creates a strange moment in which she becomes an object of her own gaze.\n\nLM: And that’s very appropriate also for the dream. In a dream, the dreamer is the object of their own gaze in a sense, or a very shifting subjectivity. But I think in your film there’s also a destabilization of the gaze. As we talked earlier about the unstable gender identities, unstable generational identities, the gaze itself also shifts around.\n\nThis might lead us on to the question of time and afterwardsness, which is about the relation—which I think is very important in this particular work— between the public and the private. Or rather, put the other way round, how the private becomes public. And in a sense, Susi has done one step of the work. She’s recorded her dreams and her interior experiences, but that it still, as it were, a private, personal, family restricted thing, and in a sense, what you’ve done is found a way of making these private emotions and experiences into a public discourse, which means that we are now sitting here with an auditorium full of people talking about Susi and her dreams, and, in a sense, that’s the magic of the Tonight the World project. So I think there’s a relationship of time, as we were talking about before, but also a way in which one can tell a woman’s history.\n\nDM: Yeah, and I suppose it’s in a sense, two women’s histories rolled up in one, it’s hers and mine, and her dreams receive my projections. You could talk also about there being two private archives- one being obviously these 20,000 dreams, hidden from view until they were cracked open after Susi died. The other being an informal or invisible archive, which is my own emotional experiences and memories, filed away over the years. And one of the ways in which I’ve been thinking about this project is to do with transgenerational trauma transmission, which implies larger historical traumas, impacting on someone personally, and being passed generationally. So perhaps it would be helpful to give a sort of anecdote as an example.\n\nThe psychoanalyst Gerard Fromm, in his book on the subject, Lost in Transmission, describes a New York City Santa Claus going about his business in December, following 9-11. A couple of months after this attack on the World Trade Center, his perceptions of the way that parents are dealing with their children completely changed. He says that from behind his hat and beard, he could see this radical difference in the behavior of the parents. They would not let go over their children. They were clutching their hands with anxiety. So this is one example of the way that a large trauma —yeah, it’s intuitive, isn’t it?— can trickle down and affect the way that parents are parenting and this in turn affects the children. So I received those kind of messages from Susi through my life, as well as receiving these great gifts of her creativity and artistic sensibility and interest in the interior life. You know, small messages that might be absences as well as disturbing stories. A whole host of things, and these create a sort of invisible archive you might say. So, this project is about bringing both of these to life, in concert. And to the public.\n\nLM: And so that is, in in a sense, using Susi as your archival material, but then also the way in which she impacted on you, gives the emotional drive, as it were, to make the process a work of art.\n\nDM: I think works of art can perform that process of repair even as they also dig in and create new ruptures. There’s a dual process, and perhaps we can bring in one last idea of the afterwardsness now… This is a dynamic process very much like these crime dramas I mentioned earlier in which a present-day trauma or crisis ignites memories of an earlier one, which is then given a new meaning and transforms the present. And one can see this this moment happening in two directions. One is moving forward in time so that trauma one is put on ice, it’s not experienced fully until trauma two. So moving forward in time it’s deferred, that’s the translation by[James] Strachey that implies moving forward in time: deferral, or ‘deferred action’. But there’s also a retrospective movement, which is when trauma two, again, triggers feelings and associations to trauma one and gives it a new meaning again. So there’s a dual direction. And you see that played out in these crime dramas in which t flashbacks build up, and then the revelation comes through –that’s the conventional narrative way of addressing this. In this project, time is collapsed into one, so we don’t so much have that narrative progression to the moment of simultaneity. Rather, timeframes coexist: we have the 1950s, the 1970s and 1938 all rolled into one in a sort of co-existence.\n\nLM: But, actually, while the concept of afterwardsness is embedded in the work itself, it’s also in your process, so the afterwardsness is your working through of the unassimilated experience that is located somewhere in the past. And just to give the [Jean] Laplanche definition: ‘the past has something deposited that demands to be deciphered. A message from the other person’. And for me that relates very clearly to a sense for how you, in perhaps a painful as well as in a liberating way, have, in a sense, been the person on whom that demand to decipher has been left, as Susi’s legacy to you.\n\nFrom: Sophie\n\n8 March 2008\n\nHi, Daria,\n\nI experience pain and sensation in response to seeing or thinking about another individual getting hit or touched on part of their body. I get it in the same place on the opposite side if I am facing them, or on the same side if we are facing the same direction, and also get a shooting sensation up and down the middle of my torso when it happens.\n\nIt used to happen a lot more vividly when I was a child, and when I was 7, my mother took me to the doctor, who said my experiences were not uncommon and that they were called ‘Sympathetic Symptoms’. He taught me how to manage the pains by filling my head with other thoughts as quickly as possible when I saw someone else getting hurt, which happened a lot because little girls have a habit of playing with skipping ropes and chasing each other and nearly every day someone would fall or sprain their ankle. A cognitive distraction could manage the pain, to the point where, if I looked away and thought of other things quickly enough, I could almost prevent myself from experiencing it at all. It did, however, make me feel like an awfully unsympathetic person whenever one of my friends fell over!\n\nWishing you all the best,\n\nSophie\n\nFrom: Daria\n\n9 March 2008\n\nHello, Sophie,\n\nThank you for your intriguing account of your mirror-touch-synaesthesia.\n\nI am curious about this form of synaesthesia specifically because it seems to differ from other forms in one important way: unlike ‘coloured hearing’, say, (in which the synaesthete experiences colours in their mind’s eye that others don’t perceive), mirror-touch synaesthesia is concerned with what others do experience. Rather than being inward-turning, does mirror-touch enable social connection?\n\nBut your story implies a movement in the opposite direction: despite being highly empathic, funnily enough, you described feeling more callous than others when you had to look away from your hurt friends. Do you think that mirror-touch (that might have evolved to increase protectiveness towards others) could, because of its extremity and your need to protect yourself from vicarious pain, ironically cut down\n\non your ability to act caringly?\n\nAs an artist (though not a synaesthete), I am attracted to synaesthesia as a complicated model to open up approaches to learning, perceiving, and communicating – approaches which might be latent but suppressed by our culture. What could the experiences of mirror-touch synaesthetes contribute socially or artistically to a matrix attuned to other thresholds of sensitivity?\n\nHow does your mirror-touch syn affect you on a daily basis?\n\nBest,\n\nDaria\n\nFrom: Cara\n\n10 March 2008\n\nFor Daria, Sophie and All:\n\nMy mirror-touch isn’t exactly feeling what other people experience, but instead I can feel things if they’re pointing at me. For example, a pen sitting on my desk pointing in my direction results in a very uncomfortable sensation of a pressure point. If a fork on the dinner table is pointed at me, I can feel the tines leaving a row of sharp pressure on my body where the fork is pointing. The intensity of the pressure varies depending on the object – book corners are dull sensations, while pens and fingers are sharper and ‘deeper’. However, it seems that I have to see the object, even just out of the corner of my eye, to ‘feel’ it.\n\nAlso, if something is moving across my line of vision, I can ‘feel’ its pull. It’s as if I have a kind of ‘magnetic field’ around my body, and an object moving across my line of sight ‘disturbs’ the field, creating a pulling sensation. The feeling corresponds to the part of my body that the moving object is level with.\n\nAnother sensation I’m beginning to wonder if it may be mirror-touch is that sometimes, when looking at an object, especially if it’s spindly or sharp, I can feel it in my mouth. It’s really unpleasant, especially since I ‘feel’ insects and spiders on my tongue!\n\nAll the best,\n\nCara\n\nFrom: Amelia\n\n12 March 2008\n\nMy son, Akim, has mirror-touch synaesthesia. He says what\n\nhe feels is dependent on previous experiences. If it is something he has experienced before, then he will feel nearly the same thing. If he has not had that particular experience, then he will feel a milder form of a related experience. This goes for pain as well as other sensory perceptions.\n\nSome examples of how this works: (1) If he watches someone’s throat being slit on TV or in the movies, he feels the kind of cut he’s gotten from penknives; (2) If he sees someone being stabbed in the stomach, he feels it like a punch to the stomach. He’s never been stabbed, but he has been punched; (3) When he was younger, he didn’t feel much when he saw a man being kicked in the groin on TV or in the movies, although he never understood why people found it funny. He was kicked in the groin once when he was 12, and now he finds it very painful when he sees it on screen; (4) When he sees kissing on screen or in real life, he feels like he’s kissing. He didn’t feel this until after his first experience. Before that time, he felt a light touch on the cheek – which was the usual kissing he got as a child. When he sees couples kissing in the hallway at school, it annoys him because he doesn’t like feeling like he’s kissing on the way to class; (5) Once, when holding a cat of ours that was just coming out of anaesthesia after surgery, his hands felt numb and continued to feel numb for at least five or ten minutes afterward. He’s had anaesthesia and knows what it feels like. He was surprised I couldn’t feel it.\n\nHe can feel the sensation either as victim or attacker –\n\nbut it depends on the genre. He doesn’t like horror shows.\n\nHe feels what the victim feels. But, when he watches\n\naction movies and karate movies, he feels like he’s the\n\none hitting, kicking, shooting. He relates this to the fun he had as a child pretending to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle or a Power Ranger, and happy sessions with his dad learning karate techniques, or the hours of fun playing with toy guns or swords – all of which almost never ended\n\nup with painful contact.\n\nOne last thing: when he touches someone, he can feel their emotions, like most people feel hot and cold. He just senses it; it doesn’t become his own emotion.\n\nFrom: Daria\n\n13 March 2008\n\nTo Amelia\n\nAkim’s synaesthesia sounds like it is part-gift and part-burden for him. The sensations you describe him experiencing are strong ones (whether pleasant or painful). Does he experience mirror-touch synaesthesia also for mild kinds of touch, like a soft caress or the touch of a distinctive fabric? For extreme temperature experiences? Or for taste, smell, for proprioceptive sensations (i.e., does he feel a sensation in his belly when he watches someone somersault)?\n\nI wonder, Syn List, whether people with other kinds of synaesthesia experience excess empathy as Akim does?\n\nDaria\n\nFrom: Rachel\n\n14 March 2008\n\nKnowledge of empathy in the human condition is hardly\n\na recent trend.\n\nEmpathy as part of moral development is as old as religion and included in Kohlberg’s stages of moral reasoning. What people in the media and corporations are beginning to realise is that it’s not enough to be intelligent. It’s also important to be able to deal with other people successfully and collaboratively. Myers-Briggs tests notwithstanding, a brilliant boss with terrible empathy is a terrible boss.\n\nHaving good social skills doesn’t necessarily mean empathy.\n\nPsychopaths are usually ‘charming’, which refers to flattery and social graces. These are rules that can be followed; drop compliments, open doors, make pleasantries and you’re charming. Empathy is the ability to internalise what someone else is feeling as if you were feeling it. Psychopaths most definitely have no regard for the feelings of other people.\n\nPeople suppress personal or other people’s pain all the time: soldiers, snipers, or even just pedestrians walking past the homeless and suffering. There is surely a spectrum of pain experience and empathy as part of that, just as there is an unsurprising spectrum of every other part of human development.\n\nFrom: Anne\n\n15 March 2008\n\nHi Sophie, Daria, Amelia and everyone\n\nI think that too much empathy can be just as much of a problem as too little.\n\nOn a personal note, I find it very difficult to detach from both the physical and emotional pain of others, even though there are clearly times when it would be ideal to do so. For example, I have always had big problems with seeing kids with loose teeth wobbling them around (it is like I can strongly feel the remembered pain of my own experience, although I would not call it anything like mirror-touch synaesthesia in my own case).\n\nWhere it becomes problematic is with the kids. My daughter stepped on glass and made it back from the park (about 300 yards away) with a shoe full of blood sloshing around and a deep gash on her foot. She put the shoe back on and managed to hobble home (it had fallen off at just the wrong moment and she put her foot down on the glass). Not every adult is good in a situation like this, but I had extra problems detaching enough to see the wound and clean it, in a situation where (for a lot of practical and evolutionary biological reasons) it would have been a lot better for my daughter if I could have detached, cleaned the cut and sorted it out with a minimum of emotion and physical malaise at the sight of the blood. This is one reason I was never\n\na candidate for medical school. Only some people can detach enough to dissect cadavers.\n\nSimilarly, my daughter’s teachers came up to us and said that she is the only one in the class who visibly trembles and shakes and starts to cry when another child is being strongly disciplined. They have said that, even though she is not the one being disciplined, ‘it is like she feels the thing personally’. She is the only one in the class who has to keep being sent to the girls’ bathroom to wash her face and try to compose herself after such events.\n\nBest wishes\n\nAnne\n\nFrom: Fumiko\n\n15 March 2008\n\nDear Daria\n\nI do not have mirror-touch syn, but emotion-colour and music-colour syn. I found it interesting you asked whether empathy was increased with all synaesthetes. I never really associated my empathy with my syn, but it is definitely higher than almost anybody I have known. I cannot watch certain movies, and have a very low tolerance to watching people inflict pain and suffering on others intentionally. I cannot comprehend it, literally. It has nothing to do with squeamishness; I have worked in the medical field for almost 25 years, with almost 20 in level-one traumas, and do just fine. I cry right alongside my pregnant patients when they learn they have miscarried, and at times when watching TV, it’s almost like\n\nI do experience mirror-emotion. I got agitated when I saw a clip of the Virginia Tech shooter video released to the public. I couldn’t watch more than a short couple of minutes. It wasn’t like I felt hate. I felt his hate, and a certain pain at the world. It’s always been this way.\n\nPersonally, I would love to associate this with my syn, because my boyfriend believes I’m a complete ‘sissy-la-la’.\n\nFumiko\n\nFrom: Shaun\n\n15 March 2008\n\nMy most significant types of synaesthesia are emotion-colour and physical sensation-colour. I am possibly oversensitive to how people feel to me, but I have always thought that this was tied to having grown up in an abusive household and church … my safety and my ability to keep my little sisters safe was tied to knowing who was dangerous or when people were likely to hurt me or my siblings.\n\nI have had experiences of physically sensing what I perceived others were physically sensing (for instance, when watching the Chinese acrobats earlier this week, I got dizzy and queasy in response to the act where they roll around and spin inside the big rings). I also have had what I think\n\nof as physical memories (there was a week or two I couldn’t open one of my hands when I remembered how it got burned when I was a child). I never thought of either of these as having anything to do with synaesthesia. Couldn’t it be that we all, and not just synaesthetes, carry physical memories that can be evoked on a cellular level just as memories are evoked on a cognitive, linguistic, visual or aural level?\n\nI know of some other women who were abused as children who also experience what I call physical memory and find it difficult to watch violence because it evokes such strong empathetic experiences.\n\nShaun\n\nFrom: Olivia\n\n15 March 2008\n\nAll, and anyone discussing mirror-touch synaesthesia\n\nI don’t have a very strong sense of mirror-touch, and I’m not sure I would like it too terribly much! However, I have noticed ONE sensation I get, in response to media, when\n\na character is somehow knocked unconscious. It could be drowning, head-blow, drugging, suffocation – it doesn’t really matter, just the fact that the character becomes,\n\nby outside forces, unconscious.\n\nIt does NOT occur when someone just passes out (say, a mother fainting because she just got the news her son died). Until reading this discussion, I was under the distinct impression everyone experienced this, but I get a very physical sinking feeling everywhere between my ribs and hips. Pretty much just the abdominal area; nothing else. If the sensation is evoked for a long period of time, it moves to the legs to where they cannot support a standing position.\n\nIs that the same thing?\n\nOlivia\n\nFrom: Alex\n\n16 March 2008\n\nConcerning feeling what others are feeling I would like\n\nto suggest that at least some of this is probably a more universal phenomenon. Here is why.\n\nIn the U.S. a while back, there was a television commercial campaign against smoking. In it, a child is sitting in the back seat of a car. The mother is smoking a cigarette, and the cigarette smoke permeates the car. The camera shows the child being buckled into the seat. The camera shows the windows being rolled up. The camera shows the doors being locked. The camera shows the cigarette smoke.\n\nThe effect is one of suffocation.\n\nIf it were only synaesthetes who felt this, they probably never would have made the commercial.\n\nThank you\n\nAlex\n\nFrom: Daria\n\n18 March 2008\n\nHello Syn List members\n\nRegarding non-synaesthetes also experiencing ‘sympathetic symptoms’, a possible connection: some scientists have recently speculated that mirror-touch synaesthesia is an explicitly felt (as opposed to implicit, or unconscious)\n\nform of ‘mirroring’ that we all experience (with the exception, perhaps, of a few – people with extreme autism, psychopaths, and others with very low empathy). Some\n\nsuggest that mirror-touch synaesthesia is a new term for old-fashioned ‘squeamishness’.\n\nAs you probably know, there has been much recent research into what scientists have identified as ‘mirror neurons’, and one theory about mirror-touch synaesthesia is that these synaesthetes’ mirror systems are on overdrive. Jamie Ward, a pioneer in this research, says: ‘We often flinch when we see someone knock their arm, and this may be a weaker version of what these synaesthetes experience.’\n\nAs Alex writes, many people cringe or look away while watching onscreen violence (I have always been very sensitive in this respect). Do films also appeal to and impact on our senses of touch, temperature, taste and smell, in part, through mirror neurons?\n\nDaria\n\nFrom: Gudrun\n\n19 March 2008\n\nIn response, Daria, to your musing about the visceral effects of media, I think that at times it can have the opposite effect.\n\nSome years ago when I was studying behaviour disorders and aggression, I remember reading a piece of research in which an audience was assembled ostensibly to hear a lecture. The auditorium had televisions mounted high at both sides of\n\nthe stage. Researchers watched the audience from a hidden location above the stage. During the lecture, a man came up on the stage and engaged in an altercation with the speaker. When the man began to physically assault the speaker, the majority of the audience shifted from watching the lecturer to watching the altercation on the television sets, even\n\nas it unfolded in front of them. They did not intervene to defend the lecturer. The whole thing was staged, of course, to test the theory that people are comfortable watching violence on TV – that is, they are able to distance themselves from violence.\n\nGudrun\n\nFrom: Lili\n\n19 March 2008\n\nI believe ‘empathy’ is a number of different attitudes, experiences or skills. I see danger in assuming that (for example) a person with mirror-touch synaesthesia cannot\n\nbe a con man, or assuming that a crime suspect is more likely to be the serial killer if he is autistic. I also think conforming to gender roles has some influence on the behaviours that are thought to involve empathy.\n\nI have a male family member who has, for as long as I have known, shown great distress when watching scenes of real bodily harm and surgical scenes in movies and TV. This same person has a history of neglecting to notice when people around him are seriously ill or injured, requiring medical attention. I suspect that he’s pretty hopeless at reading the emotions of others. Noticing that someone has a great bleeding gash in their flesh does not require any type\n\nof skill at reading emotions, social situations or facial expressions, but noticing that someone is in severe pain from a closed-injury broken bone requires rudimentary social or medical skills.\n\nI do not know whether he has mirror-touch synaesthesia. I do not have it, but I do have many other forms of synaesthesia. I do not enjoy watching footage of real bodily injury in news broadcasts or surgical scenes, but movies don’t bother me as I know it is all fakery. Does knowledge of genuineness or fakery affect mirror-touch synaesthesia?\n\nLili\n\nFrom: Laura\n\n21 March 2008\n\nHi, all\n\nI’m new to the list. I’m 25 years old and am pretty close to being totally blind, due to an inherited condition. For most of my life, I thought I could see only light, and only when the contrast is high. But recently, I’ve discovered that I seem to have some kind of visual tactile synaesthesia that helps me make sense of the tiny bit of visual information I’m getting. Here are a couple of my experiences.\n\nI was looking at a computer screen that was set to high contrast, and I was able to describe some shapes that were on the screen. My mind supplied me with a picture that\n\nfelt like the raised line drawings I had seen in my maths textbooks. This is a common element of my experience: I’ll see something, and then instantly feel like my fingertips are exploring a picture of whatever it is I’m seeing. It seems as though colours and different kinds of light have different textures. Some light feels plasticky, others feel heavy, others feel thin, or thick, or metallic. I tend to feel these colour textures on my cheek. Also, sometimes moving different parts of my body helps me to understand what I’m seeing.\n\nAnother time, I was at a movie theatre and, when I looked at the movie screen, a picture popped into my head of a bathtub draining, or something melting. My mom told me that this is probably when the images on the screen are changing. At another time, I looked at the screen and saw something that felt like a wide open field, or an echoey building, and my mom said that’s when I’m seeing a landscape with not a lot else happening on the screen.\n\nThanks\n\nLaura\n\nIn conversation: Daria Martin and Etel Adnan\n\n14 February 2013\n\nDaria Martin was born in the San Francisco Bay Area around the same time that Etel Adnan, esteemed Lebanese poet and painter, settled there. As a child, Martin knew Adnan as a family friend. The two met again in Adnan’s Paris home and spoke about Martin’s new film and some shared histories within.\n\nEtel Adnan: Film has a haunting power. It shows people and images as if they were in front of us, while they are in fact utterly absent. In your recent film, One of the Things that Makes Me Doubt, people, texts and artworks appear, disappear and return, links within a wider world.\n\nDaria Martin: One of the reasons I work with film is its capacity to elide time and space. It makes images continuous — images that, in the ‘real’ world, inhabit very different contexts. It can also create ruptures and dissonances. Before films, I made abstract paintings, very formal and strict, but they didn’t allow me to explore this kind of agency.\n\nEA: Many generations appear in the film, including Anna Halprin, founder of postmodern dance. She surges onto the screen, her triangular face like an arrow, an element that ties things together and pushes them forward.\n\nDM: Anna is a powerful force! And another woman artist, like you, making work inspired by Mount Tamalpais, in Marin County, California.\n\nEA: But the central past figure in the new film is that of your grandmother, Susi Martin, who I have had the privilege to know and befriend. We don’t see Susi’s image but rather her paintings and diaries, surfacing fragmented or whole, like the soul of a person on which everything else is grounded. We witness a continuum of past and present, which is a transmission.\n\nDM: Susi’s paintings and diaries are the ‘ground’ of the piece, and I layered on top of her relatively private bodies of work my relatively public body of film work. As the film progresses, Susi’s centrality is diffused, spinning off into parallel conversations with actresses who have appeared in my films. These women perhaps become stand-ins for Susi, or her part-personas, the recurring personalities she tracked in her dreams — an internal community.\n\nAs you know, in ‘real life’ Susi was part of a tight-knit community of painters called Sight and Insight, a Bay Area group influenced by abstract expressionism and Zen Buddhism. You were also painting there in the 70s. How did you discover the group and Ann O’Hanlon, its founder?\n\nEA: Ann was very important for me because she made me paint. In the 70s, while I was teaching philosophy of art at Dominican College, Ann was teaching art there. When I met her for the first time she asked me provocatively if I painted. I said, ‘No’. She said, ‘Why?’ And I heard myself say, ‘Because my mother said I’m clumsy’. She said, ‘And you believed her?’ And you know, that answer freed me. There are moments in life when certain words change your life.\n\nDM: From then on, you painted with a palette knife, a confident and definite technique!\n\nEA: Later Ann started weekly seminars at her own place. She didn’t want an academic setup. By word of mouth, in a few years, she had many people, as many as 60. It was a beautiful place, two or three acres in Mill Valley, in the foothills of Mount Tamalpais. That’s where I met your grandmother, Susi.\n\nDM: Sight and Insight was a place where Susi could experience reverie.\n\nEA: Well, the Bay Area is paradise — the mountain, the sea…\n\nI want to be in the open — I want it, and it’s becoming more acute. Perhaps it’s to do with ageing. Nature frees me; it leaves me free. Nature isn’t territorial. Yosemite belongs to itself.\n\nAnn based her teaching on not teaching, on letting a student find their way. She didn’t teach to draw or paint. She was philosophically like her contemporary John Cage, embracing chance and play. Let people find what you cannot teach.\n\nAt the same time, Ann had her hang-ups. She hated women who decorated themselves, who wore earrings. She couldn’t stand high heels. It was something very deep. Her own sexuality was non-existent.\n\nDM: So her advocacy of free expression met its limits in decorative, feminine expression. Yet it was mostly women in the group.\n\nEA: Very few men; occasionally a husband would come. There were many foreign women: Austrian, German, English from Rhodesia — people homesick for Europe or elsewhere. Susi was not American herself, was she?\n\nDM: No, she was a Czech Jew whose family fled during the Second World War. When she was 13 she was sent to boarding school in England because, luckily, her parents understood what was happening. She was separated from her parents for a few years, while she read in the papers about Germany’s advance towards her childhood home.\n\nDecades later, in her 50s, she fell into a deep depression and began to paint. She tried to tackle her crisis simultaneously with painting and with Jungian analysis. They functioned in two very different ways to process her experience of exile. While her analysis was probing and penetrative, a way to dig into neuroses, painting freed her from it. I think that painting was a way for her to find some internal home or balance.\n\nEA: It’s maybe the same for me, I don’t know. Sometimes people ask me where I live, and I say ‘I live in my books’. I am where I am.\n\nDM: Thinking again about Ann and what you said about her denial of sexuality, I wonder about the role of the Zen attitude in all of this. Zen Buddhism is very attractive in its openness, its lack of hierarchy. But my experience of Zen is that some Westerners use the philosophy as a tool for denial, perhaps distorting the concept of ‘detachment’ or ‘emptiness’ to detach from emotions, passions, the conflict of life.\n\nEA: You’re opening up an interesting question. Not the Buddhists of Japan or China but American Buddhists, Cage included, they escape the conflict of the world. That might even be the purpose of Zen: to solve problems by escaping them. Perhaps it’s about protection. But there is something cold about it — more of a denial than a solution. There is more than lack of pain in a solution.\n\nDM: Do you think that denial itself can be a sort of solution?\n\nEA: Well, Susi was the only person who helped me, once, over a very strong phobia. I can’t stand snakes. If I come across one in a book, I cut the page and burn it. It’s not fear for of my life. It’s incredible, uncontrollable horror.\n\nOne day Susi and I were at Sight and Insight. We were going from one building to another along the hillside and there was a little garden snake, not moving. I said, ‘No, I can’t go, there is a snake!’ She said, ‘So what!’ I was terrified, I couldn’t move. But she said ‘Nonsense!’ She took me by the arm and I went on. It didn’t cure me but I was happy I could do it.\n\nDM: Susi had quite a stoic side. She was a rigorous mountain climber.\n\nEA: She had both sides: she was a dreamer and a determined, strong person.\n\nDM: –A natural introvert, but toughened from the trauma of what she went through during the war. She wasn’t directly involved in the conflict but —\n\nEA: She absorbed it.\n\nDM: She really absorbed it, and one of the striking things about her dream diaries is the continuous mention of Nazis until the end of her life. They kept arising in her dreams. Her diaries are dense with arguing voices and characters, while her paintings were dreamy, floating and beautiful.\n\nEA: Well, I’m a writer and a painter. My paintings are the dream, the beauty of the world. My writings are full of conflict.\n\nDM: Is writing a way to give voice to the crises you see in the world? You’ve written in response to wars in Algeria, Vietnam and Lebanon, your home country.\n\nEA: Yes, writing is totally opposite to painting — same as with Susi. But it’s personal. If I weren’t a writer maybe my painting would be different. You can say political things in paintings, like Picasso and Goya did. Goya painted about war. I wrote about it.\n\nAll the arts have an inner balance to achieve. Rhythm is part of any art form. But also, each one has its own mystery. A painting you see. A short poem also has immediacy. But a film you have to memorise — you never see it whole. A book is the same.\n\nDM: Each medium carries images differently. In the new film, I wanted to create a frame in which different media and subjects can speak, different images can arise, a bit like Scheherazade’s One Thousand and One Nights mentioned by Susi in her diaries.\n\nEA: Do you have the diaries?\n\nDM: Yes, I brought some pages to show you.\n\nEA: This is an invaluable document! I see that she meticulously dated the entries; that’s good. She took great care. (Reading.) And she writes well.\n\nDM: The diaries were only intended for an audience of two — her and her analyst — but they are very orderly. There are white pages documenting the dreams and yellow pages recording her account of the analysis. She also tracks the archetypes that recur in her dreams, and their evolution through the years, as if these characters were living.\n\nIt’s addictive reading. Every night she records two or three dreams, in detail. She did this for over 30 years. It’s like literature.\n\nEA: What is literature? Once it gets published, it’s literature!\n\nIt’s writing.\n\nThe One and the Many\n\nAn essay by Catherine Wood, 2005\n\nI first saw Daria Martin’s film Birds (2001) projected in the crumbling loft space of the temporary Bart Wells Institute in Hackney, in an exhibition curated by the artist David Thorpe. We climbed up a stepladder onto the damp and dark topmost space before the 16mm film flickered into view. The moving image conjured by the projector feeding its strip of 16mm film through a beam of light was intensified by the rudimentariness of the surrounding situation which it suddenly illuminated: the simply constructed wood and perspex screens around which the performers move and the coloured poles which they manipulate into lattice-like patterns were unexpectedly echoed by the physical structure of the roof’s beams above the make-shift viewing platform; the film’s title was given a certain animality by the pigeons resident in its shadowy, woodwormed corners. Because of this, the primariness of the materials used in the film – sheets of coloured acetate, cloth, wood, paint – not only framed the bodies of the performers who touch, move and are enclosed by them, but they also felt all the more tangible. Despite the marked difference between the ultra-clean, white studio of the film and the deteriorating Victorian roof space, my relationship to the piece was not purely one of physically suspended immersion in the image but of increased haptic investment. At a level removed from the rest of the exhibition this space also perfectly suited the nature of Martin’s work, as a kind of elevated and private ‘hideaway’.\n\nThe world in which we live in the early twenty-first century takes for granted a high level of social connectedness mediated by technology, a situation which is often popularly lamented as being at the expense of primary contact between people. A great number of contemporary artists have made work attempting to counter technology’s refraction of experience and its complicity with the capitalist ideology of ‘spectacle’ culture. Working against high Modernist painting’s prioritisation of optical engagement with an artwork, the Minimalist artists of the 1960s such as Robert Morris made a feature of the viewers phenomenological engagement with his ‘blank-form’ sculpture placed directly on the floor. In the 1990s, the generation that have been characterised by Nicholas Bourriaud in terms of ‘relational aesthetics’ – Rikrit Tiravanija, Liam Gillick, Mauricio Cattelan et al – made work which encouraged literal participation in a collective situation, addressing the ‘realm of human interactions and its social context, rather than the assertion of an independent and private symbolic space.’ Daria Martin’s films all depict the staging of relations between people as choreographies mediated by objects or formal rules. But what is striking in her work, as distinct from the viewer’s physical constitution of installation environments in the 60s or the 90s, is that its invitation to participate in its world is opened only through the imagination. Despite the fact that they represent relationships between people, the films conjure an atmosphere of intense solitude, inviting an intimate form of communion between artist and viewer mediated via the film’s fantasy world of suspended disbelief. At the same time, a sense of haptic identification with the sculptural matter with which Martin builds her costumes and sets rubs against the immateriality of the projected image, complicating the idea that it marks the boundary to a separate sphere into which the viewer has no physical access.\n\nThe twilit and isolationist titles of In the Palace (2000) (after Giacommetti’s surrealist sculpture The Palace at 4am (date)), Birds (2001) and Loneliness and the Modern Pentathlon (2004-2005) hint at the private space in which they are conceived to exist, and at the work’s essentially romantic basis. Martin’s work investigates the individual imagination as it inhabits or draws upon the real fabric of the outside world, in this sense treating the film medium traditionally, as a ‘window’. And yet the artist stages a direct level of sensory communion with the viewer which seems to temporarily suspend for the viewing subject the fact that they exist on the worldly plane. This is part of the fantasy of becoming immersed in the work, at least.\n\nHer films, derived firstas textual scripts, have something in common with Maurice Blanchot’s characterisation of writing as an ‘affirmation of solitude’. Blanchot writes of transferring thought to written text and of the extent to which this transfer, unlike speaking out loud, severs the subject from acting and inter-acting in the world at large; “to write is to break the bond that unites the world with myself. It is to destroy the relation, which, determining that I speak toward ‘you’ gives me room to speak within the understanding which my word receives from you… To write is to withdraw language from the world” (p. 26, Blanchot). In choosing the film medium, Martin is able to depict a world of acting subjects, who relate to each other physically. They are, in Blanchot’s terms, separated by their outwardly communicative gestures from their own interior being. At the same time, her films open up a space which invites a direct channel of communion between artist and viewer that sidesteps usual modes of communication in the form of bodily gestures or verbal exchange.\n\nThe evocation of solitary fantasy is most evident, and related to Blanchot’s observation, in the profoundly silent nature of the films: the dancers and actors never speak, their interaction is gestural and mimed, always set to a musical soundtrack, setting them in a sphere which is at one remove from us. In the earlier films, Martin frequently uses material scrims and blank studio spaces which give the space inside the film a sense of being ‘screened off’. The performers are often posed still here too, which, in combination with her use of props and objects, lends the work the appearance of sculpture. Karmen Mackendrick has written of stillness in dance as an equivalent for silence in the use of language, describing Bataille’s claim that language ‘cheats’ in concealing the violence that silence implies (p. 145). Martin’s work is daring in its embrace of that quietness and stillness that goes against the grain of the film medium and its very ability to capture movement. These early works test the boundaries of her separateness from the world, oscillating between abstracted distance and voyeurism. In a climate excessively concerned with connectedness, Martin stakes out territory which appears not to be afraid of solitude.\n\nGiven that Martin’s films are all, in a sense, edited sequences from recordings of elaborately staged performances, it is revealing that she consistently chooses to repress live presence into the immateriality of film. Rather than choosing to situate such performance in the theatrical context that requires a live audience to constitute it, Martin creates films that can be conjured into the present in the darkened space of a gallery installation, for just one. Although the technology Martin uses is not new (preferring the quality of 16mm film) she registers that very contemporary form of isolated contact with which I began, tapping into the intimacy and fantasies offered by communication technology’s capacity for virtuality. Making film recordings instead of live pieces enables their looping and repetition. The action is preserved and can be repeated in a way that connects with Blanchots conception of writing’s reiteration, a form of stasis that connects with the core of ‘being’. In this, Martin reinterprets the classic eighteenth century Romantic artist’s struggle to distinguish between internal subjectivity and external object, or the world at large, via the mediation of the image. In making films that combine abstract aesthetic form with performed action, Martin’s actors become in a sense ‘puppets’ and their presence registers a split between her own private subjectivity and Blanchot’s ‘worldly plane’ in which internal subjectivity is necessarily repressed. Moreover, the films stage and dramatize the split between the imagination and the world outside. Like the presence of the male figure looking out onto the sublime, Romantic landscape in the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, Martin often focuses on a central female figure within the film who serves both as a kind of stand-in for the artist’s own subjectivity, and as a ‘threshold’ marking the boundary of this other world.\n\nEssential in this discussion of solitude, though, is the fact that the making of Martin’s work is unavoidably collective. It is a generative process, not an entirely controlled one, relying on the participants ‘playing her game.’ Martin first writes a script and treatment for her films which includes details of the film’s aesthetic, its atmosphere, the filming style and the movements and attitudes of the characters, as well as technical instruction for the camera. Extracts from her treatment for Loneliness and the Modern Pentathlon read, “the camera tilts back up to the first floor gridded window where the headmistress stands; the camera slowly zooms towards her.” Or, “she is a woman of unplaceable age and enduring sexual charisma; her face silently speaks of a life well lived”. This script, a fantasy dreamed up by the artist in private, is then realised through the participation of a large team of people – from the individual performers who carry out the artist’s instructions, attempting to inhabit her vision, to the choreographer who invents the movement patterns, the designer of costumes and the production and camera crews and post production editing. The degree of mediation at stake in making the primary conception of the script and the artist’s formal composition – with its abstract basis – manifest is something that Martin deliberately embraces. The linearity of the script-text and the compositional visual patterns are literally fleshed out. The encounter with real people as the substance and subjects of her medium creates the essential texture to Martin’s imagined vision. Not only is this visible through the individual characteristics of the actors, but also in specific areas of the films, such as her use of ‘found’ locations and narrative situations which provide real-time frameworks for playing out the artist’s ideas.\n\nOne of Martin’s earliest films, In the Palace (2000), shows a group of performers posed still inside a scaffold which might equally be the stage of a pole-dancing club, a commonly found venue in LA (where the film was made) or nearby Las Vegas. The male and female performers are dressed in hand-made looking aluminium foil and fabric costumes which resemble those seen in early modern dance performance by Martha Graham but their skin and bodily contours are nevertheless revealed. Despite the static petrification of this ‘performance’ in which the dancers remain for the most part still whilst the camera rotates mesmerisingly around them, the piece has erotic overtones. Occasionally we catch a glimpse of an embrace between them – silvery made-up skin touching skin under the cold blue light. In common with the mood of Giacommetti’s piece, Martin’s film appears to turn the suggestion of erotic spectacle and its drive towards revelation and display into a deathly space of memory and latent, rather than explicit, charge. She pulls back from the potential offered by the live situation, as though wanting to crystallise the moment as sculpture. The piece contains a kind of petrified ecstasy, both sexual and fantastical, corrupting remembered fragments of theatre, art and of dance history with the factuality of the real context in which they are revived, as though the artist wants to inhabit them and preserve them at once. The static atmosphere is intensified by the soundtrack which includes thunder and rain rumbling in the distance, like an approaching tropical storm which never comes. Throughout the film’s 7 minute duration, the figures remain together yet isolated in this art historical cage.\n\nBirds (2001) conversely, sets the performers free in a white photographic ‘infinity’ style studio space which is mapped out by the relative positions of moving bodies and moving structures. As though the space is too wide, too far-reaching, the figures position themselves in relation to screens, sticks and hoops, making lattice-like grids against which their own shape is set. They are in turn playful and serious, but seem to be stranded in this borderless place with its conflation of history and curious futurism. As with In the Palace, though, wind blows through the set and its suggestion of ‘naturalism’ charges the pure artificiality of the scene, as though it is connected with the elements despite being an indoor space, and yet we know that this too is a deliberate and artificial filmic construct, ‘breathing life’ into the scene. In Closeup Gallery (2003), the last film in the trilogy, a focus on a magician’s hands dexterously shuffling, spreading and picking up cards sprayed as Malevich-like red, blue, black and green rectangles on occasions viewed sandwiched between the layers of the revolving, 3-tier glass table – proposes them as equivalents for the performers in Birds who move between fabric scrims, wearing coloured squares of acetate and painted paper costumes. In the Palace, Birds and Closeup Gallery present elements of idealism represented as early twentieth century modernist abstraction transferred to situations referencing the secular rituals of the strip club, the magazine fashion shoot and the Las Vegas style magic show.\n\nWhat is at stake in the work, then, is the degree of ‘directedness’ or artistic control versus the input of the individuals, and real objects and places, that Martin works with, whether she literally invites improvisation or not. The films reveal the extent to which real, performed action and the specificity of a built or customised set always exceed the formal principles through which it has been set out. Martin has said, “In general I am drawn to ideals: primary colours, cohesive communities, ordered cosmologies and beautiful bodies” but at the same time, she ways, she wants the work to embrace awkwardness: “I intentionally include in the edit moments in which the performer drops their guard, stops acting, allows themselves to relax, reveals exhaustion”. Indeed, in both In the Palace and Birds Martin captures the performers breaking at the end of the shot or smiling.\n\nIn Soft Materials Martin complicated the relationship between ‘actor’ and director, working with an artificial intelligence lab and two dancers trained in contact improvisation to effect a complex collision of man and machine. The dancers’ naked bodies are shown as vulnerable and real against the metal antennae of the artificially intelligent ‘being’ in the opening shot whose rods resemble the barrel of a gun, and Martin shoots flesh as it is seen through the grid of steel wires or juxtaposed with the metal teeth of turning cogs. But rather than containing this relationship within the early twentieth century narrative framework of the mechanisation of man of the anthropomorphism of the machine, or in surreally humanising it after Rebecca Horn, Martin blurs the boundaries with the setting together of two kinds of randomly generated rules which respond to, learn from and appear to become intimate with each other, despite one being human and one robot. The film creates an impression of tenderness in the sequence in which the female performer allows the fine plastic antennae of the intelligent machine to ‘flutter’ against her face, feeling the soft skin of her cheek, lending the robotan anthropomorphic quality. But at the same time, we are explicitly aware of the robot’s hand-built, provisional construction from pieces of electrical and computer equipment. In Loneliness and the Modern Pentathlon, the formal idea of the sculptural object is substituted with a succession of ‘readymades’ which come with the readymade form Martin has chosen to structure her piece: the ritualised sport of the modern pentathlon and its accompanying kit, rifles, horse-jumps and fencing masks and swords. Martin weaves her own aesthetic threads through the found form of the sport using coloured ropes and ribbons pulled across the screen to make linear patterns; the actors carry the white poles for the equestrian event back and forth across the screen in measured lines; in the shooting section the rifles are raised and lowered by a line of marksmen and women in choreographic succession. Martin’s film treatment describes a desire for the film to “emphasize repetition and movement en mass”, continuing that, “they do not depict military precision as much as a rippling, delirious excess found in baroque architecture, a stylisation of nature that abstracts yet intensifies its effect.” However, the formal abstraction of Martin’s composition and choreography and the rules of the sport are cut through by the suggestion of emotional narrative: a love triangle between the ‘headmistress’ and a female pupil, who is attached to one of her male peers. Martin conflates the rigour of sport-derived choreographic form with the emotive drive of the ‘movie’ narrative to explore the extent to which a real situation (signified by this twist in the ‘love story’) exceeds set patterns – whether they be the rules of a complex sport, or filmic convention.\n\nBoth Soft Materials and Loneliness and the Modern Pentathlon draw upon forms of choreography, the former free-form, the latter highly regulated. Martin admits a fascination with simultaneously designed movement. She acknowledges Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia as a point of reference, but her work complicates the frequent association of mass bodily movement with the subjugation of individuality in military or sporting displays deriving from Fascist politics. Slavoj Zizek rejects this generally drawn association in any case, arguing against the idea of “the allegedly proto-Fascist character of the mass choreography displaying disciplined movements of thousands of bodies.” He writes, “the ‘bad’ bodily discipline, if there is one, is not collective training, but, rather, jogging and body building as part of the New Age myth of realisation of the Self’s inner potentials.” This boundary line – between performing oneself as part of a community and as an individual – is a distinction that Martin’s work problematises: to what extent do shared codes or rules enable participation and to what extent to they oppress? Do or can these idealised and self-enclosed communities she represents thrive in reality if, according to Blanchot, the outward gesture of codified communication between people is produced at the expense of ‘being’ a solitary subject in an inward sense?\n\nA sequence in Matthew Barney’s Cremaster 3 shows one of the ‘air stewardess’ characters in the futuristic, sealed-off room of the living space idly playing with a bowl of red and green grapes, placing them in different patterns. These patterns are, surreally, played out to spectacular scale in a grand arena below by hundreds of dancing showgirls in matching costumes. Barney here stages the split between a daydream and its fully fleshed out realisation. But where Barney’s vision is made in the airtight and glossy manner of a high production value Hollywood film, Martin specifically aims for a more fragile aesthetic. Martin has said she wants to go beyond the “seamless quality of Hollywood films because they don’t allow breathing space for the viewer to enter or leave at will”. Her props have more in common with the provisional nature of Maya Deren or Jack Smith, she incorporates elements of spontaneity or mistakes which recall the recorded performances of Carolee Schneeman. Where Barney employs one hundred idealised female models, Martin deliberately seeks realness in the people she casts, whether they be actors, athletes, dancers and/or friends. She chooses individuals for their qualities of vulnerability and readability.\n\nIn her staged tableaux for film, Martin presents equivalences for the dream or fantasy space of the mind as it processes and recycles the material it consumes. Images from history and the present are equally available to her as references and resources, woven together to make a fabric of continuous present. A.W. Schlegel wrote that the mind has its own ‘ideal time’ linked to ideas of an eternal, a-chronological truth. Henri Bergson developed this idea as psychological time: the world experienced as a continuous progression rather than as a succession of identical separate moments, similar to how we hear music. Woven throughout Martin’s films, always set to specially composed musical scores, are elements of formal composition drawn from her training as a painter, from art history: the constructivist painting of Popova, the stage and costume designs of Sonia Delaunay or Varvara Stepanova, the Triadic Ballet of Oskar Schlemmer or Fernand Leger’s film Ballet Mecanique. Martin draws from these sources a set of patterns and archetypes quite specific to art history: lattices of wooden poles or ribbons, choreographies, sculptural costumes and props are woven together to create complex formal arrangements synthesising the arts into a magically conjured immaterial space.\n\nDespite the seductive visuality of Martin’s films and the work’s temptation towards complicity with its fantasy, there is always a degree to which the work itself prevents this, pushes one back to an awareness of its construction, its fakery and its surface. Martin’s choice of the film medium seems to be specifically – and politically – aware of its own power. Unlike the utopian aims of some of the work that Martin references – the way in which constructivist theatre quite literally set out a ‘world’ in which the performer was depicted in harmony with objects, the gesamtkunstwerke – Martin’s work registers a different kind of utopian agenda, an attempt to reclaim some mental or imaginative space, some potential for collective understanding beyond what we are fed by marketing and branding strategists. Where Stepanova had faith in the possibility of abstract art’s potential functionality in the everyday world – as costume design, furniture, political poster design – Martin’s utopia is concerned especially with the artist and viewer’s relationship as it is mediated via the fantasy space offered by her medium. The artist is fascinated by Jungian ideas on the unconscious and its archetypes or ‘primordial images’ which might act as essential points of connection between people across cultures and across time.\n\nIn contemporary, late-capitalist culture, short moving-image advertisements on television represent a world which we are invited to be a part of as consumers only. A pop cultural anti-equivalent of Martin’s work might be seen in the advertisements for ‘Gap’ shown on UK TV in 2001, for example, showed a group of young, beautiful people wearing Gap clothing dancing in choreographed unison against a white background. Writing on dance, Randy Martin has made a negative comparison between the cathartic, collective identification with the protagonist of Greek Tragedy and the pop cultural spectacle of ‘marketised consumption’ in which “one watches anonymously but constantly for that image which might finally give place to identity. This process of watching life go by outside oneself means that the virtual life of the spectacle looks back, casting judgement on the onlooker as a negative reference to what he or she lacks.” Martin’s work addresses the extent to which advertising co-opts our relationship to images and fantasy, attempting to substitute for those deeply buried collective archetypes relations to a commercial brand. Martin seeks to locate her work in a recognisable world; to graft the aesthetic realm with the vernacular of everyday activity with her use of real people and situations, employing a povera frankness of her materials. In so doing, Martin digs into that ephemeral, two-dimensional image space with deeper perspective.\n\nMartin borrows from the familiar pop-cultural image-world as much as from other areas of art, theatre and dance history, but she refuses to be satisfied with its interiorlessness, substituting fallibility, sensuality, awkwardness and humour for its hard flawlessness. In the worlds of her films, Martin stages relations between acting subjects that fall in and out of conventional gender roles, predictable movements or positions, rubbing the two-dimensionality of text or abstract pattern against the flesh of the world. The work is political in the sense that Jacques Ranciere describes the ‘distribution of the sensible’ in the wider social sphere; “The artist only ever lends to projects of domination or emancipation what they are able to lend them, that is to say, quite simply, what they have in common with them: bodily positions and movements, functions of speech, the parcelling out of the visible and the invisible” (Ranciere, p.19) Martin’s work tests out the fantasy that the solipsistic space of the individual imagination might incorporate forms of collective history and memory. The work stages, on the one hand, a fantasy of how social or communal experience might be played out according to aesthetic codes and patterns – recalling, for example, the feminist project of Californian artist Suzanne Lacey titled The Crystal Quilt(1987) in which a large group of older women arranged at differently coloured tables moved in unison to make ‘patchwork’ patterns– and at the same time the work problematises the necessarily directorial relationship between the root of that aesthetic impulse and its material realisation. This contradictory longing is mediated for the viewer via the otherworldliness of a film projection set to music so that the artist is able to both offer her world and pull it back, to expose the bulkiness of the real materials or bodies she works with and to flatten them as dream-like visions. The seductive qualities of Martin’s work makes it mischievously double-edged in its appeal: the films have the power to colonise and propel the viewer’s appetite to devour images at the same time as interrupting and prizing loose compulsive, learned habits of viewing.\n\nDaria Martin in Conversation with Yilmaz Dziewior and Beatrix Ruf\n\n2005\n\nYilmaz Dziewior (YD) and Beatrix Ruf (BR): We have collaborated already on three exhibitions, but one thing we find especially intriguing about our current working together on your book, Daria, is that it seems that the whole project (your exhibitions in Zurich and Hamburg as well as the catalogue) seems to follow an intrinsic logic. In Zurich you showed your trilogy consisting of In the Palace (2000), Birds (2001) and Closeup Gallery(2003) and in a single screening the newly finished film Soft Materials (2004), which you then showed in Hamburg with Loneliness and the Modern Pentathlon (2004-2005). As we three all know that the sequence of the shows was not planned from the beginning, we just wonder if the same can be said about your trilogy? Watching the films one after the other it seems as if you would have known already before starting the series how each part would look in the end. It starts in a dark space and with a somber atmosphere (In the Palace) then the space is light and the action a bit funnier (Birds) and in Closeup Gallery the narration gets more elaborate and it seems that you increased the formalistic approach of the first two films to an even higher degree.\n\nDaria Martin (DM): It may look as if the films have been designed methodically to unfold in sequence, but in fact they’ve evolved in an unplanned way, guided by strong interests and semiconscious desires. I think it was Marguerite Duras who spoke about writing as a process of groping in the darkness toward a distant light. Writing for film is like that for me—an instinctive impulse—so it is only in looking back on the films’ progression that the logic is spelled out. I called my first three films a trilogy because, in retrospect, they seemed to provoke and then resolve a dialogue: In the Palace poses questions (blackness, voyeurism, holding poses); Birds provides counter-questions (whiteness, participation, frequent breaking of poses), and Closeup Gallery perhaps begins to resolve or at least to distill those questions. For example, the trilogy’s engagement with hand-made magic is made literal and concrete as well as symbolic in Closeup Gallery.\n\nThe role of the films’ performers has evolved from the assumption of static poses to enacting increasing degrees of movement, and, looking back, this gradual “awakening” is parallel to a slow move from my former painting practice into the full possibilities of the film medium. Also, the direct references to particular art movements or pieces in the earliest films have with time become more imbedded within my growing visual language, and sometimes within a loose narrative structure.\n\nOne way that the more recent films depart from the trilogy is that they have moved away from my self-enclosed studio and out into the world, away from manufactured, possible worlds to engagement with actual ones. Loneliness and the Modern Pentathlon and Soft Materials both work with existing phenomena that tie into the work’s conceptual strands. Soft Materials takes off from intriguing research on embodied artificial intelligence and Loneliness weaves a fiction around an anachronistic Olympic event. They use occurrences in our culture as traction to broaden the work’s sensibilities.\n\nYD: I think it is quite significant that Beatrix, having been involved in modern dance earlier, and I, who recently did an exhibition about formalism and the impact of modernity on younger artists, invited you for an exhibition. These themes seem deeply rooted in your work.\n\nDM: It’s the first time I heard that Beatrix used to be involved in dance but somehow I’m not surprised! The connections you’ve mentioned are significant indeed because you’ve touched on two poles of the work: abstraction as against figuration, or more specifically, the use of sculptural form and painterly colour as against the performing body. The trilogy of films beginning with In the Palace arose from the context of my graduate school training in Los Angeles in the late 1990s, when my peers were turning to Greenbergian modernism as a touchstone for a new sense of agency, a way out of over-theorised postmodern academia, or a guiltless indulgence in beauty. I was also attracted to the sense of freedom that this return to “Modernism” seemed to promise, but I worried that what many artists were doing willfully shut out the whole arena of the body and its vulnerability. So in searching for a place to begin, I turned instead for inspiration to the some of the stumbling first moments of 21st-century modern culture, when the modernist project hadn’t yet worked out its parameters (if it ever really did) and was open to the contamination of humour, exaggeration, pathos, play, and awkwardness. For example, I was intrigued by Oskar Schlemmer’s direction of the Bauhaus theatre program: he combined instruction in the arts of vaudeville with an application of his own rigorous painting practice; he created a continuum, not always seamless, between the dress-up games of the Bauhaus’ gala costumed balls and his own self-serious, pseudo-scientific study of abstraction. I’m very attracted to awkward clashes like Schlemmer’s: areas where Apollonian control and Dionysian release come into conflict.\n\nBR: My past involvement in dance did not have any influence at all on having invited you for the show in Zurich, but of course this “reference” did reactivate knowledge in perceiving your films. I was very intrigued by the formalist understanding of what early modern dance created in relation to crossovers to visual art practice (as you mentioned with Schlemmer) and especially to the interaction of sculptural forms and three-dimensional movement. I understand that for In the Palace your reference is Alberto Giacometti’s The Palace at 4 am (1932), which is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Can you talk more about the spatial and sculptural concepts that interested you? Thinking of Giacometti’s sculpture that creates a kind of spatial box in which activities can/might happen—it also reminds me of another artist you seem to refer to a lot in your work, Joseph Cornell.\n\nDM: The relationship between film and sculpture is an interesting paradox. On the one hand, film is extremely articulate in describing form, space, and volume. Unlike video, it doesn’t flatten its subject through a grid of pixels; unlike photography, it can actively move around its subject. But on the other hand of course, it’s impossible to fully capture the bulk and volume of sculpture on the ephemeral medium of film; it’s a relationship that doesn’t quite work. That not-quite-working can generate an emotional tension, a little bit like the uncertain desire created by a psychological projection, or by the experience of romantic love directed towards someone who might or might not care.\n\nGiacometti created The Palace at 4am before he began making his famous existential figures. Whereas Giacometti explained those attenuated sculptures as being a result of directly observing people in the distance of a cityscape, compressed by the atmosphere around them, the pieces made around the time of The Palace at 4amseem to be compressed in the mind, by another kind of atmosphere. These sculptures, quite small, resembled game boards or maquettes; many looked like models for something that could exist on a much larger scale.\n\nThe Palace at 4am, as practically anyone who’s seen it will agree, has a particularly evocative feeling, as if the figures within it have each been caught within their own dreams, simultaneously sleepwalking through the same house. When I used to visit it at the old MOMA in New York, it seemed vast and diminutive at the same time—its scale shifted in the imagination. The idea that sparked In the Palace was a desire to literally realise my own fantasy to inhabit this small sculpture, to blow it up to human dimensions and to populate it with performers.\n\nAfter measuring the sculpture in MOMA’s archives for the accurate proportions, it was quite a shock, months later, to finally stand inside the 25-foot high version that I built with my art-school friends. It wasn’t until the thing was lit, within a darkened sports arena, that you felt a hint of the isolated atmosphere of the original sculpture. In the process of making all my films, I hit this odd point of shock and recognition, where a mental fantasy suddenly meets the reality of a collective physical effort to realize that fantasy.\n\nThis is an aspect of filmmaking that really fascinates me: the voyage of the work’s existence from its beginnings as a daydream to its translation into a real-world event when it is filmed, and finally to its return to an ephemeral presence when it is projected. In a way, the film projection, the light streaming from the projector, is like a maquette or model: physical space and action has been compressed, but the on-screen images hold the potential, in the imagination, to expand into an entire world, to spring to life.\n\nJoseph Cornell, who filled hundreds of boxes with delicate selections from his collections of objects and images, is an artist who has fascinated me for many years. His boxes seem to compress emotional experience; sometimes, like Giacometti’s early sculptures, they take the form of a game or a maquette that seemed to invite, yet exclude, participation. These boxes seduce you into complicity, yet they also shut you out of their self-contained worlds. Like The Palace at 4am, they suggest a whole world growing from a lap-sized space.\n\nYD: I would like to get back to Schlemmer because, especially concerning his ballet, there are more striking similarities we haven’t yet mentioned. Just the title Triadisches Ballett (Triadic Ballet) already indicates the structure of the three components it was built of. I read that just like Daria’s trilogy: it starts with a funny, burlesque scene, here all in yellow, then the Schlemmer stage becomes pink and in the end turns—again comparable with the trilogy—into black. Besides these formal analogies, it is most of all Schlemmer’s fascination with what he called “artificial figures,” which also seems evident in a different way in Soft Materials. But whereas Schlemmer’s fascination with progress and the machine age was not tainted by any doubts, the figures in Soft Materials seem to be both using and being used by the machines.\n\nDM: Schlemmer created a kind of science of the body that was oddly irrational—an awkward fusion of art and mechanics. The performers usually appeared in baggy body suits padded in the hips and shoulders, almost exaggerating both their masculine and feminine attributes. Perhaps they were meant to represent androgynous “everyman” and “everywoman” but instead they looked like awkward aliens making mischief.\n\nThere was plenty of humour in the Bauhaus performances—mime acts and moustachioed masks and lots of staccato trotting around the stage. Schlemmer built his theatre around what he called the “play instinct.” The ridiculousness of his performances is difficult to reconcile with the seriousness of his diagrams, drawings, and paintings; there seems to have been a “split” there; he apparently felt that his performances were inferior to his paintings. You say that his optimism was untainted, but I think that there might have been a kind of secret, lingering doubt there; a doubt about how the presence of the real human body might corrupt the kind of unblinking faith he felt for his painting practice.\n\nMy first films set the performing body in relation to sculptural objects. At times the constructed environment around the performers—sets and props—almost appears as important as the human presence. And yet the sense of bodily frailty and fallibility is always hinted at. These films set up a parity between the delights of artifice—form, colour, sculptural space—and the complex nature/culture entity that is the human body.\n\nSoft Materials was an experiment in introducing the vulnerability and tenderness of human flesh and feelings to animated yet man-made objects: robots. Working with scientists in the field of artificial intelligence seemed like a natural extension of my involvement with the notion of artifice.\n\nBR: I find it quiet interesting that the robots you worked with for Soft Materials have a really old-fashioned aesthetic; they appear to refuse recent high-tech knowledge, and yet they also seem to work against the suspicion we have of post-mechanic machines/technologies. These robots also seem to refer again to a modernist, specifically a handmade, look and to early utopian concepts of the relationship between humans and machines, with an underlying dream of a functioning and an interaction between the two, which keeps humans “in power,” pre-sci-fi kind of. And these robots again remind me of early modernist dance props.\n\nHow did you find the AI (Artificial Intelligence) Lab at the University of Zurich, where you shot the film? What exactly where you looking for? (Funnily this all happened before our plan to do the show at Kunsthalle Zürich.) Can you also speak about the scientists’ ideas behind using these “old fashioned” models?\n\nDM: AI is an emotionally loaded area in the popular imagination, and I wanted to remove the sense of fear of these objects, to move away from paranoid fantasies of machines taking over humankind and toward a far more open area of poetic and metaphoric possibility. I also wanted to keep this experiment somehow “grounded.” The robots at the AI lab at the University of Zurich appealed to me in part because they look, as you say, quite “low tech,” their parts held together with gaffer tape, plastic cogs, and wheels. In appearance, they reminded me a bit of the “new sculpture” coming out of Los Angeles recently—formal work made with DIY materials. The scientists at the lab work like artists; their desks are completely covered with raw material, a big mess. The lab is also very open to outsiders, making a policy of inviting professionals from other disciplines to visit the lab and this is how I found them.\n\nWhat is fascinating about these creations is that, despite their rat"
