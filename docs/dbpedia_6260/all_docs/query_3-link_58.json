        "text": "The 2012 European Championships kick off on June 8 in Poland and Ukraine, and as we fans get amped up for this summer's excitement, what better way is to prepare than to peruse the rosters set to do battle on the pitch?\n\nFrom Sneijder to Schweinsteiger, Ronaldo to Rooney and everyone in between, here's what the final rosters look like.\n\nHistory: Though \"the White Eagles\" have finished third in two World Cups (1974 and 1982), 2008 marked their first appearance in the European Championships. They did not make it out of the first round.\n\nHistory: Though Greece has reached two World Cups, the national side is best known for its remarkable underdog run to the Euro 2004 title in Portugal.\n\nHistory: As Czechoslovakia, the national side won the 1976 European crown in Yugoslavia. Under their current moniker, the Czechs then finished runners-up to Germany in England at Euro 1996.\n\nHistory: One of the top sides in the world and the runners-up at the 2010 World Cup, \"Clockwork Orange\" won the European title in West Germany in 1988.\n\nHistory: The Danes have never gotten past the quarterfinals in a World Cup, but they shocked the continent by winning Euro '92 in Sweden.\n\nHistory: Three-time winners of both the World Cup (1954, 1974, 1990) and the European title (1972, 1980, 1996), Germany has one of the finest resumes in all of international soccer and will be among the favorites to win it all in Poland and Ukraine.\n\nHistory: Despite a history marked by incredibly creative and talented players, the Portuguese national side has never won a World Cup or European Championship, though they did finish runners-up to Greece as the host nation at Euro 2004.\n\nHistory: The reigning World Cup and European champions head into Poland and Ukraine as one of the favorites, but few know that Spain also won the 1964 European title as host.\n\nHistory: Four-time winners of the World Cup (1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006), the Azzurri also won their one and only European title as hosts in 1968.\n\nHistory: The fourth-oldest international team in the world, the Irish side, originally run by the Irish Football Association, officially split into Ireland and Northern Ireland in 1950.\n\nAs the Republic of Ireland, the Boys in Green reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup in 1990 and reached the second round in both 1994 and 2002.\n\nHistory: Europe's sixth-best team according to FIFA's rankings, Croatia finished third in the 1998 World Cup and reached the quarterfinals at both Euro 1996 and 2008.\n\nHistory: Though the co-hosts of Euro 2012 enter the tourney as underdogs, Ukraine did reach No. 11 in the FIFA rankings in 2007 after reaching the World Cup quarterfinals the year before."
