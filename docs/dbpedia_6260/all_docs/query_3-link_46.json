        "text": "The Sports councilor, Mário Soares, made these statements, on the sidelines of the swimming team and city council meeting, at Paços do Concelho, which took place this Tuesday.\n\n“In this swimming competition there were good results and reaching the podium, taking into account that the athletes brought five medals, four bronze and one silver. Our competitors have been training in open waters, but the competition took place in a swimming pool, and this is a significant gain for Brava”, he highlighted.\n\nIn this sense, he considered it to be a source of pride for the athletes, coaches and even the Cape Verdean swimming federation, as last year they invested in the training of 16 young athletes.\n\n“This shows that by creating conditions and providing more opportunities, we also have the capacity to achieve much more. We are talking about young people who participated in the tournament together with the best swimmers in Cape Verde and achieved five medals in their first participation, and this is something that everyone from Brava is proud of and we as a local authority will work on creating conditions for more participation from young people”, he stressed.\n\nMário Soares highlighted that, at the municipal council level and within the scope of creating conditions, the city council has a project for a municipal swimming pool to be “materialized” in the Fajã d´Água area, being a Government program.\n\nTherefore, according to him, the chamber will make a small readjustment to the project, which, in addition to being a leisure space, will be used to hold competitions, as all the minimum and necessary requirements will be added to host a competition. .\n\n“It will be another investment in the sports sector here in Brava that will facilitate and encourage more athletes to practice this sport”, he concluded.\n\nThe coach of the swimming team in Brava, Hélder Brito, considered his team's participation to be “excellent”, as the island does not have any resources for training, but even so the athletes were not intimidated and competed on equal terms. with the other competitors.\n\n“My team managed to bring five medals to the island, as we are all to be congratulated, we approached this competition with a lot of responsibility, determination and determination and we managed to put on a good race”, he said.\n\nThe coach also highlighted that they came from the competition richer in terms of knowledge and that they now have a more detailed training plan, which will allow more efforts from the athletes so that they can bring more medals to the island in the next competition.\n\nIn turn, athlete Leonardo Pereira, who won the bronze medal, said that participating in this competition was “good” although they did not have much training opportunities, but guaranteed that next time they will be well prepared with more techniques.\n\nRegarding the city council's project to create a swimming pool, the athlete considered that it would be of “great value”, taking into account that the team's training takes place only in open waters.\n\nInforpress"
