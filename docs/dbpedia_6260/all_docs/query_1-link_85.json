Well the Olympics certainly a Texas flair to it for the United State as a whole.\n\nSo when an American wins a Gold, Silver, or Bronze medal, it's cause to celebrate. Even more if they're representing to the great state of Texas. One athlete who's recently made the news is none other than Valarie Allman from Austin, Texas.\n\nOf course, she brought another Gold medal to this wonderful state. But how she's going to celebrate the accomplishment is truly the Texan way.\n\nValarie Allman Set To Memorialize Gold Medal With A Texas Food Classic\n\nAllman's performance, which you can see here, resulted in her second straight gold medal in the discus event. She also talked to NBC Sports about the moment when took the top spot as well. But how she is going to toast to her moment is what many Texans will all agree that is the best way to do so.\n\nAccording to KXAN, Allman will be going to Terry Black's in Austin, and to quote her directly: \"celebrate and eat a pound of brisket...I canâ€™t wait to go all out there.\"\n\nAs it turns out, Terry Black's is ready for her appearance:\n\nCongrats Valarie! Eat all the brisket you want, you've earned it!"
