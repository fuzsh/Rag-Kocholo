At the end of another decent day for Team GB, it’s time to draw the curtain. Katarina Johnson-Thompson leads the heptathlon after four events and here’s hoping she gets a good night’s sleep of this, her fourth attempt to win that elusive Olympic medal. Thanks for your company, we’ll be back sooner than you think!!!\n\nShare\n\nTrack cycling: “Team GB’s Emma Finucane will turn her attention to the women’s individual sprint after a bronze medal in the keirin ended her dreams of a golden Olympic hat-trick but far from being disappointed, the 21-year-old from Carmarthen was ebullient. Jeremy Whittle reports from the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines Velodrome.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nMen’s basketball: The USA survived an almighty scare to emerge 95-91 winners over Serbia in their semi-final and will play France in the gold medal match. Stephen Curry scored 36 points for the States, a tournament high for the team.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 00.15 CEST\n\nCindy Ngamba has to settle for bronze ...\n\nWomen’s boxing: With this 75kg fight scored at a round each, Atheyena was docked a point in the final round for excessive holding but still goes through to the gold medal fight on a split decision.\n\nI thought Ngamba, who boxes for the Refugee Olympic Team but trains with the British team in Sheffield, had done enough to win it and so did she. Having learned that she lost, she took the decision with good grace.\n\nHats off to our winner, Atheyna Bylon, who is guaranteed a silver at least and has won Panama’s first ever Olympic boxing medal.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.53 CEST\n\nJack Snape\n\nBoxing: Tokyo silver medallist Li Qian has narrowly defeated Australia’s Caitlin Parker in their women’s middleweight boxing semi-final at Roland Garros.\n\nThe first round went to the Australian, and the powerful Chinese fighter came out swinging in the second, getting the nod from the judging panel.\n\nIt set the scene for a grand final three minutes, stopped once for the Australian to have a bloody nose cleaned up.\n\nBut it was Li who was awarded the bout by all five judges despite the close nature of the contest.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nBoxing: Already guaranteed a bronze medal, Cindy Ngamba of the Refugee Olympic Team has just started her semi-final bout against Panama’s Atheyna Bylon.\n\nA British-based refugee from Cameroon who grew up in Bolton after arriving in the UK with her parents as a child, she does not wish to return to her home country because she is a lesbian and homosexuality is illegal in Cameroon. Ngamba trains with Team GB’s boxers in the British Institute for Sport and is the first member of the Refugee Olympic Team to ever win a medal. All of Team GB’s boxing team and their support staff are in Roland Garros tonight to support her.\n\nAt the end of the first round, Cindy’s trainer Darren Maher, who has been seconded from the British team, gives her a pep talk and could not sound more Scouse.\n\nShare\n\nGood morning, Australia! Here’s what happened while you were sleeping, and from an Aussie perspective you were probably as well off in bed, because your recent flood of medals slowed down to a trickle.\n\nShare\n\nUSA track and field respite on otherwise brutal day\n\nBeau Dure\n\nTrack and field: Tara Davis-Woodhall, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Grant Holloway (and three fellow US athletes taking silver or bronze) provided a bit of relief for Team USA on what had been a brutal day for the 2028 host nation.\n\nThe women’s water polo team suffered a rare loss in the semifinals. The men’s basketball team are in a deep hole against Serbia. US athletes finished fourth in sailing and diving. Two wrestlers favored to keep up the rush of medals on the mat lost in the semifinals.\n\nAnd we learned after the fact that Noah Lyles won a bronze medal with Covid - an accomplishment in itself, but it leaves us all wondering “What if?” He told NBC that he never considered withdrawing from the 200m, but he sounds doubtful about running in the 4x100m tomorrow.\n\nIn the heptathlon, top-ranked Anna Hall is well off the pace of the leaders and is barely in third, though her second-day scores are usually well ahead of those posted by Belgium’s Noor Vidts, who sits in fourth. Based on past performance, Belgium’s Nafi Thiam should have the edge over Team GB’s Katarina Johnson-Thompson, but KJT can produce magical moments.\n\nShare\n\nTonight’s track ands field has concluded. It’s been a pretty good night for thre Americans, who took gold in the men’s 110m hurdles courtesy of Grant Holloway and the women’s long jump thanks to Tara Davis-Woodhall. A little earlier, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone was the runaway winner of the women’s 400m, breaking her own world record.\n\nThe Yanks didn’t have it all their own way, of course. BOtswana’s Letsile Tebogo was the surprise winner of a men’s 200m final in which Noah Lyles, suffering from third, could only finish third behind the winner and Kenny Bednarek. In the men’s javelin final, Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem set a new Olympic record on his way to victory.\n\nNot yet among the Olympic medals at her fourth attempt, Team GB’s Katarina Johnson-Thompson is the overnight leader after four events of the seven she has to complete.\n\nMeanwhile in the velodrome, Welsh speedster Emma Finucane took bronze in the women’s keirin, while Ellie Aldridge won Britain’s only gold medal of the day in Marseille after triumphing on the waves in the women’s kite final.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.17 CEST\n\nShare\n\nNadeem wins Pakistan's first athletics gold\n\nMen’s javelin: Already assured of first place, the athlete from Pakistan launches another monster of a final throw: 91.79. It’s not as good as his winning effort of 92.97 but serves to confirm his superiorty tonight. It’s Pakistan’s first ever Olympic medal in athletics.\n\nThe well beaten defending champion, Neeraj Chopra (Ind) has taken the silver medal, while Grenada’s Anderson Peters has taken the bronze.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.46 CEST\n\nJack Snape\n\nBoxing: IBA world champion boxer Abdumalik Khalokov has beaten Australian Charlie Senior in their men’s featherweight semi-final at Roland Garros in a unanimous decision.\n\nThe fight was a rematch of the round of 16 clash in last year’s world championships, and again Khalokov got the better of the Australian.\n\nBut Senior can consider himself unlucky, after an even second round was given to the Uzbekistani boxer by four of the five judges.\n\nAustralia’s Caitlin Parker takes on Tokyo silver medallist Li Qian in their women’s middleweight semi-final later tonight.\n\nShare\n\nHolloway wins 100m hurdles gold ..\n\nTrack and field: Despite a slow start, the American wins from a field that could not get near him. He wins in a time of 12.99sec. His compatriot Daniel Roberts (13.09sec) is second, while Jamaica’s Rasheed Broadbell was third.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.03 CEST\n\nMen’s 110m hurdles final: They’re under starter’s orders in the final race of the day. America’s Grant Holloway is the hot favourite as he searches for his first Olympic medal …\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.01 CEST\n\nWomen’s long jump final: Tara Davis-Woodhall wins another gold for the USA with a leap of 7.10m. She beats the defending champion Malaika Mihambo (Ger) into second, while Jasmine Moore was third (USA).\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.15 CEST\n\nMen’s 200m final: Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo was the surprise winner of the race, finishing ahead of Kenny Bednarek in second place. Race favourite Noah Lyles had to settle for bronze before it was revealed he was suffering from covid.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s javelin: We’re over halfway through the final and Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem continues to lead with his earlyOlympic record of 92.97m.\n\nThe defending champion, Neeraj Chopra (India) is in second place with 89.45m. A former double world champion, Grenada’s Anderson Peters is in the bronze medal position with his best throw of 88.54m.\n\nShare\n\nWomen’s 400m hurdles: Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone milks the applause of the crowd, with an American flag draped around her shoulders. In coming second, her teammate Anna Cockrell set a huge personal best of 51.87. Femke Bol, who finished in 52.15, looks very disappointed with her performance. She seemed to get her race tactics all wrong and went too hard, too soon.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.23 CEST\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone takes gold!\n\nWomen’s 400m hurdles: The American wins at a canter, pulling away from the field and setting a new world record of 50.37sec in the process. Her compatriot Anna Cockrell finished second and Femke Bol had to settle for a well beaten third place.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.20 CEST\n\nWomen’s 400m hurdles: It’s next up and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone (USA) and Femke Bol (Netherlands) are the out-and-out favourites. They have not competed against each other for 748 days. The American is the favourite and the world record of 50.65sec, set by McLaughlin-Levrone in June, has to be under threat.\n\nShare\n\nHeptathlon standings after four events\n\nKatarina Johnson-Thompson (GBR) 4,055\n\nNafissatou Thiam (Bel) -48\n\nAnna Hall (USA) -99\n\nNoor Vidts (Bel) -104\n\nSofie Dokter (Ned) -162\n\nShare\n\nKieran Pender\n\nWater polo: The Australian women’s team, the Stingers, are through to their first gold medal match in 24 years after emerging victorious from a thrilling semi-final with the United States.\n\nThe Americans led at every quarter, but a late equaliser from Australia sent the match to a shoot-out - and the Stingers emerged triumphant. Australia won the first-ever women’s water polo gold medal, at Sydney 2000, and they will face Spain for another shot at gold on Saturday.\n\nShare\n\nKJT leads heptathlon after day one\n\nWomen’s heptathlon: Katarina Johnson-Thompson is first home in her heat, finishing in 23.45sec. It’s a good time, but not a great one. It will earn her 1,035 points, take her tally to 4,055 and put her into the lead overall going into day two.\n\nShare\n\nWomen’s heptathlon: At the end of a good opening day so far, Katarina Johnson-Thompson is about to run in her fourth event, a heat of the 200m.\n\nThe 31-year-old Team GB athlete has, for various reasons, never won an Olympic medal in three attempts and it would be heartbreaking for her and her many fans if she doesn’t win one this time around.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.31 CEST\n\nMen’s javelin: Jakub Vadlejch (Cze) has gone into third place with a throw of 88.50.\n\nWomen’s long jump: Team USA’s Tara Davis-Woodhall goes into the lead with a leap of 7.05m.\n\nShare\n\nWomen’s long jump: The final is in its early stages and Team USA’s Jasmine Moore is the early leader with a leap of 6.96m.\n\nShare\n\nNadeem smashes Olympic javelin record\n\nMen’s javelin: We’re in the second round of the final and Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem has just thrown a monster effort of 92.97m. It’s a new Olympic record and is going to take some beating.\n\nThe reigning Olympic champion, Neeraj Chopra is currently in second place with 89.45m, while Anderson Peters (Grenada) is in third with 87.87m.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.08 CEST\n\nNoah Lyles: US Track and Field officials have just revealed that Noah Lyles ran with covid, a state of affairs that must raise serious questions over his participation in assorted USA sprint relay teams in the coming days.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.55 CEST\n\nLetsile Tebogo: The 200m winner has taken his win in his stride and pointedly not gone overboard in his celebrations. His mother, Seratiwa, was a huge influence on his career and passed away in May. Tebogo is still trying to come to terms with that huge loss and had his mother’s date of birth embroidered in his spikes tonight.\n\nShare\n\nTebogo wins 200m gold ...\n\nTrack and field: Tebogo wins fairly easily, beating his chest and looking to his left and right as he crossed the line. Kenny Bednarek was on Tebogo’s shoulder all the way down the home straight but ended up being well beaten.\n\nNoah Lyles was never in contention and finished a distant third. There is talk he may have been feeling poorly but on the BBC coverage, Michael Johnson says he’s not sure if Lyles had a 19.46sec race in him whatever the state of his health.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.30 CEST\n\nLetsile Tebogo wins the men's 200m!\n\nTrack and field: The sprinter from Botswana beats Kenny Bednarek into second place in a time of 19.46sec. Noah Lyles has to settle for third.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.39 CEST\n\nMen’s 200m: The race is almost upon us and the eight finalists are currently being introduced to the crowd. Noah Lyles (USA) is the hot favourite to double up after winning gold in the 100m but could face stiff competition from his compatriot Kenny Bednarek, Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo or one of the less fancied runners. Not long now …\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nBeau Dure\n\nBasketball: Germany had every opportunity to knock out France and their 7ft 4in star Victor Wembanyama in the men’s semifinals. They led 12-2 early. The defense kept them in the game when the offense went cold in the second quarter, and they reached halftime tied 33-33.\n\nFrance pushed ahead, and with 6:51 left, the score was 66-53. But Germany made things very difficult for France’s NBA stars down the stretch, and the lead was 69-65 with 1:01 remaining.\n\nIt all came down to an unfortunate slip. With France clinging to a 70-68 lead, Franz Wagner had his hands on a rebound. But he didn’t have his feet under him, and he tumbled, spilling the ball out of play. France hit just enough free throws after that for a 73-69 win.\n\nGood luck to the team who faces France in the final -- Bercy Arena was rocking throughout this game and should be a tough place for either the USA or Serbia to walk out with gold.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.58 CEST\n\nWomen’s heptathlon after three events\n\nNafissatou Thiam (Bel) 3,070 points\n\nKatarina Johnson-Thompson (BBR) -50\n\nAnna Hall (USA) -105\n\nNoor Vidts (Bel) -113\n\nSofie Doktoer (Ned) -184\n\nShare\n\nTaekwondo: Bradly Sinden has been forced to pull out of his 68kg bronze medal fight with a knee injury.

He’ll have to face the world record holder and three-time Olympic gold medallist, Harrie Lavreysen from the Netherlands, in the semi-final.\n\nShare\n\nFrance win the men’s omnium\n\nTrack cycling: Benjamin Thomas is a very popular winner of the omnium and beats world champion Iuri Leitao, from Portugal, into second place.

Germany’s Malaika Mihambo and Team USA’s Tara Davis-Wood hall are the favourites for this competition and the only two competitors who have jumped longer than seven metres this season.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.36 CEST\n\nWomen’s 1,500m: Team GB’s Georgia Bell and Laura Muir have both qualified from their semi-final but Revee Walcott-Nolan wasn’t good enough in her’s. Despite running a personal best time of 3min 58.o8sec, the 29-year-old from Luton could only finish ninth in the second semi and will not be in the final.\n\nShare\n\nFinucane: \"A 'pinch me' moment\"\n\nTrack cycling: “Going up in that final and scraping through the semi, I knew I had to find something in my legs that I hadn’t seen before,” says Emma Finucane in an interview with the BBC after winning bronze in the women’s keirin.\n\n“Ellesse [Andrews] is world champion, she has demonstrated today that she is so strong. All of the other girls in that final, we’re the strongest girls in the world that’s why we are in the Olympic final. And to even be there next to one of my best friends Katie [Marchant] was such a ‘pinch me’ moment.\n\n“To get a bronze medal, it literally feels like gold to me because I left everything out there on the track. If you told me a year ago I’d be coming to the Olympics and getting a gold in track sprint and then bronze in keirin, I would’ve been like ‘no way’ but here I am.”\n\nAnd breathe.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.13 CEST\n\nWomen’s heptathlon: The shot put is under way at the Stade de France. It’s not Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s favourite event by any stretch of the imagination but she throws a decent effort of 13.38m with her first effort.

For the uninitiated here are sprints for five, three, two and one points every 10 laps through the race and riders get double-points on the last sprint.\n\nIf a rider laps the field, they gain 20 points and if they are dropped from the field and lapped, they lose 20 points – all added or subtracted to everything they’ve earned throughout the four races. The rider with the most points at the finish wins the Omnium.\n\nShare\n\nTrack cycling: After three disciplines of the men’s omnium – the scratch, tempo and elimination races – Great Britain’s Ethan Hayter is in fifth place going into this evening’s final event, the points race. He’s just 18 points behind the event leader Fabio van de BOssche (Bel) and bang in the shake-up for a medal.\n\nShare\n\nTrack cycling: The Flying Scotsman Jack Carlin gets the better of his Japanese opponent, but could find himself in a bit of bother as he went off his sprinter’s line and may have impeded his opponent’s progress. Earlier in the race, Kaiya Ota had played fast and loose with his elbow again, so the judges have a lot of work to do.\n\nShare\n\nTrack cycling: Hamish Turnball is out of the men’s individual sprint, losing his best-of-three quarter-final encounter against Hoogland. He was well beaten by a vastly more experienced Dutchman.\n\nShare\n\nTrack cycling: Jack Carlin is no longer out of the men’s individual sprint and will have a decider against his Japanese opponent, Kaiya Ota, who has been relegated from one of his two victories for injudicious use of his elbows.\n\nFirst up, however, there’s a decider between Team GB’s Hamish Turnball and the Netherlands’ Jeffrey Hoogland.\n\nShare\n\nTrack cycling: Having won gold in the women’s team sprint, Emma Finucane from Carmarthen secures her second medal of her first Olympic Games by taking bronze in the keirin.
