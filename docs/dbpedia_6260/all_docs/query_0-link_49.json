The method presented in this paper is used for a number of realistic nuclei in the A=160 mass region. Two slightly different calculation schemes are put into practice. The first calculation gives results in qualitative agreement with experiments and the second calculation provides remarkable improvements to the first. A possible explanation of the mechanism for signature inversion of odd-odd nuclei is discussed.\n\nEffect of exact Coulomb-exchange calculations on band-head spectra of odd-proton nuclei\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKoh, Meng-Hock; Nurhafiza, Mohamad Nor\n\n2017-10-01\n\nPrevious calculations of band-head energy spectra of odd-mass heavy nuclei in the Hartree-Fock-plus-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (HF-BCS) framework showed that the agreement with data is better for odd-neutron as compared to odd-proton nuclei. The reason for a poorer agreement with data for the latter have been ascribed to the possible usage of the Slater approximation in calculating the Coulomb-exchange term. In this work, we report the effect of exact Coulomb-exchange calculations on band-head energy spectra of two odd-proton nuclei (namely 237Np and 241Am) as compared to the results obtained using the Slater approximation. We performed self-consistent blocking calculations while taking the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the mean-field level into account due to the unpaired nucleon. The SkM* and SIII parametrizations of the Skyrme interaction have been employed to approximate the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction while a seniority force is used for the pairing channel. Contrary to what was expected, our preliminary results show no improvement on the band-head spectra as compared to data when the Coulomb-exchange term is calculated exactly.\n\n28 CFR 85.2 - Calculation of adjustment.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 85.2 Judicial Administration DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (CONTINUED) CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES INFLATION ADJUSTMENT Â§ 85.2 Calculation of adjustment.

It has been expected that odd-odd nuclei should have even larger amount of octupole-octupole correlations. We have recently made measurements on the structure of {sup 224}Ac. Although spin and parity assignments could not be made, two bands starting at 354.1 and 360.0 keV have properties characteristic of reflection asymmetric shape. These two bands have very similar rotational constants and also similar alpha decay rates, which suggest similarity between the wavefunctions of these bands. These signatures provide evidencemoreÂ Â» for octupole correlations in these nuclides.Â«Â less\n\n39 CFR 3010.26 - Calculation of unused rate adjustment authority.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 39 Postal Service 1 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Calculation of unused rate adjustment authority. 3010.26 Section 3010.26 Postal Service POSTAL REGULATORY COMMISSION PERSONNEL REGULATION OF RATES FOR MARKET DOMINANT PRODUCTS Rules for Applying the Price Cap Â§ 3010.26 Calculation of unused rate adjustment...\n\nSystematics of signature inversion in odd-odd nuclei in the mass regions A=80 and A=160\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZheng, Renrong; Zhu, Shunquan; Cheng, Nanpu; Wen, Jiayan\n\n2001-07-01\n\nBased on an axially symmetric rotor plus quasiparticles model, the study of the signature inversion (SI) in odd-odd nuclei in the mass region A=160 is extended to include the region A=80. In spite of many differences between the two mass regions, the calculation results show that the possible SI mechanism, which has been confirmed by the calculation of odd-odd nuclei in the A=160 region (i.e., the competition between the n-p interaction and the Coriolis force in low-K space) is also appropriate for odd-odd nuclei in the A=80 region. This seems to indicate that there may be a universal mechanism of SI in odd-odd nuclei for different mass regions.\n\nAlpha-cluster preformation factor within cluster-formation model for odd-A and odd-odd heavy nuclei\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaleh Ahmed, Saad M.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe alpha-cluster probability that represents the preformation of alpha particle in alpha-decay nuclei was determined for high-intensity alpha-decay mode odd-A and odd-odd heavy nuclei, 82 < Z < 114, 111 < N < 174. This probability was calculated using the energy-dependent formula derived from the formulation of clusterisation states representation (CSR) and the hypothesised cluster-formation model (CFM) as in our previous work. Our previous successful determination of phenomenological values of alpha-cluster preformation factors for even-even nuclei motivated us to expand the work to cover other types of nuclei. The formation energy of interior alpha cluster needed to be derived for the different nuclear systems with considering the unpaired-nucleon effect. The results showed the phenomenological value of alpha preformation probability and reflected the unpaired nucleon effect and the magic and sub-magic effects in nuclei. These results and their analyses presented are very useful for future work concerning the calculation of the alpha decay constants and the progress of its theory.\n\nStudy of Even-Even/Odd-Even/Odd-Odd Nuclei in Zn-Ga-Ge Region in the Proton-Neutron IBM/IBFM/IBFFM\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nYoshida, N.; Brant, S.; Zuffi, L.\n\nWe study the even-even, odd-even and odd-odd nuclei in the region including Zn-Ga-Ge in the proton-neutron IBM and the models derived from it: IBM2, IBFM2, IBFFM2. We describe {sup 67}Ga, {sup 65}Zn, and {sup 68}Ga by coupling odd particles to a boson core {sup 66}Zn. We also calculate the beta{sup +}-decay rates among {sup 68}Ge, {sup 68}Ga and {sup 68}Zn.\n\nIncidence, prevalence, and hybrid approaches to calculating disability-adjusted life years\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWhen disability-adjusted life years are used to measure the burden of disease on a population in a time interval, they can be calculated in several different ways: from an incidence, pure prevalence, or hybrid perspective. I show that these calculation methods are not equivalent and discuss some of the formal difficulties each method faces. I show that if we donât discount the value of future health, there is a sense in which the choice of calculation method is a mere question of accounting. Such questions can be important, but they donât raise deep theoretical concerns. If we do discount, however, choice of calculation method can change the relative burden attributed to different conditions over time. I conclude by recommending that studies involving disability-adjusted life years be explicit in noting what calculation method is being employed and in explaining why that calculation method has been chosen.

R.\n\n1982-06-01\n\nThe code ADENA, which approximately calculates fussion-product beta and gamma decay energies and spectra in 19 or fewer energy groups from a mixture of U235 and Pu239 fuels, is described. The calculation uses aggregate, adjusted data derived from a combination of several experiments and summation results based on the ENDF/B-V fission product file. The method used to obtain these adjusted data and the method used by ADENA to calculate fission-product decay energy with an absorption correction are described, and an estimate of the uncertainty of the ADENA results is given. Comparisons of this approximate method are made to experimental measurements, to the ANSI/ANS 5.1-1979 standard, and to other calculational methods. A listing of the complete computer code (ADENA) is contained in an appendix. Included in the listing are data statements containing the adjusted data in the form of parameters to be used in simple analytic functions.\n\nHybrid configuration mixing model for odd nuclei\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nColÃ², G.; Bortignon, P. F.; Bocchi, G.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nIn this work, we introduce a new approach which is meant to be a first step towards complete self-consistent low-lying spectroscopy of odd nuclei. So far, we essentially limit ourselves to the description of a double-magic core plus an extra nucleon. The model does not contain any free adjustable parameter and is instead based on a Hartree-Fock (HF) description of the particle states in the core, together with self-consistent random-phase approximation (RPA) calculations for the core excitations. We include both collective and noncollective excitations, with proper care of the corrections due to the overlap between them (i.e., due to the nonorthonormality of the basis). As a consequence, with respect to traditional particle-vibration coupling calculations in which one can only address single-nucleon states and particle-vibration multiplets, we can also describe states of shell-model types like 2 particle-1 hole. We will report results for 49Ca and 133Sb and discuss future perspectives.\n\nComparison of model results transporting the odd nitrogen family with results transporting separate odd nitrogen species\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDouglass, Anne R.; Jackman, Charles H.; Stolarski, Richard S.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nA fast two-dimensional residual circulation stratospheric family transport model, designed to minimize computer requirements, is developed. The model was used to calculate the ambient and perturbed atmospheres in which odd nitrogen species are transported as a family, and the results were compared with calculations in which HNO3, N2O5, ClONO2, and HO2NO2 are transported separately. It was found that ozone distributions computed by the two models for a present-day atmosphere are nearly identical. Good agreement was also found between calculated species concentrations and the ozone response, indicating the general applicability of the odd-nitrogen family approximations.\n\n33 CFR 138.240 - Procedure for calculating limit of liability adjustments for inflation.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... calculating limit of liability adjustments for inflation.

Given that risk estimates take into account other fitted and design-related factorsâand that is how risk gradients are interpretedâso should the presentation of risk gradients. Therefore, for each risk factor X0, I propose using appropriate regression techniques to derive from appropriate population data the best fitting relationship between the mean of X0 and all the other covariates fitted in the model or adjusted for by design (X1, X2,ââ¦â, Xn). The odds per adjusted standard deviation (OPERA) presents the risk association for X0 in terms of the change in risk per s = standard deviation of X0 adjusted for X1, X2,ââ¦â, Xn, rather than the unadjusted standard deviation of X0 itself. If the increased risk is relative risk (RR)-fold over A adjusted standard deviations, then OPERA = exp[ln(RR)/A] = RRs. This unifying approach is illustrated by considering breast cancer and published risk estimates. OPERA estimates are by definition independent and can be used to compare the predictive strengths of risk factors across diseases and populations.

We sought to examine prospectively whether lower plasma bicarbonate is associated with incident hypertension. We conducted a prospective case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study II. Plasma bicarbonate was measured in 695 nonobese women without hypertension at time of blood draw who subsequently developed hypertension during 6 years of follow-up. Control subjects were matched to case subjects according to age, race, time and day of blood draw, and day of menstrual cycle. We used unconditional logistic regression to generate odds ratios (ORs) for development of hypertension by quintile of baseline plasma bicarbonate. After adjusting for matching factors, body mass index, family history of hypertension, plasma creatinine, and dietary and lifestyle factors, higher plasma bicarbonate was associated with lower odds of developing hypertension across quintiles (P for linear trend = 0.04). Those in the highest compared with the lowest quintile of plasma bicarbonate had 31% lower odds of developing hypertension (OR = 0.69; 95% confidence interval = 0.48-0.99). Further adjustment for diet-estimated net endogenous acid production, plasma insulin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and uric acid did not alter these findings. Our case-control study is consistent with a modest association between higher plasma bicarbonate and reduced odds of developing hypertension among nonobese women, although our findings are of borderline statistical significance. Further research is required to confirm this finding as part of a larger prospective cohort study and to elucidate the mechanism for this relation.\n\nSpectroscopy of the odd-odd fp-shell nucleus {sup 52}Sc from secondary fragmentation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGade, A.; Bazin, D.; Mueller, W.F.\n\n2006-03-15\n\nThe odd-odd fp-shell nucleus {sup 52}Sc was investigated using in-beam {gamma}-ray spectroscopy following secondary fragmentation of a {sup 55}V and {sup 57}Cr cocktail beam. Aside from the known {gamma}-ray transition at 674(5) keV, a new decay at E{sub {gamma}}=212(3) keV was observed. It is attributed to the depopulation of a low-lying excited level. This new state is discussed in the framework of shell-model calculations with the GXPF1, GXPF1A, and KB3G effective interactions. These calculations are found to be fairly robust for the low-lying level scheme of {sup 52}Sc irrespective of the choice of the effective interaction. In addition, the frequencymoreÂ Â» of spin values predicted by the shell model is successfully modeled by a spin distribution formulated in a statistical approach with an empirical, energy-independent spin-cutoff parameter.Â«Â less\n\nOctupole deformation in odd-odd nuclei\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSheline, R.K.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nComparison of the experimental and theoretical ground-state spins of odd-odd nuclei in the region 220less than or equal toAless than or equal to228 generally shows agreement with a folded Yukawa octupole deformed model with epsilon/sub 3/ = 0.08 and some lack of agreement with the same model with epsilon/sub 3/ = 0. Thus in spite of limited spectroscopic information, the ground-state spins suggest the existence of octupole deformation in odd-odd nuclei in the region 220less than or equal toAless than or equal to228.\n\nOdds per adjusted standard deviation: comparing strengths of associations for risk factors measured on different scales and across diseases and populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nHopper, John L\n\n2015-11-15\n\nHow can the \"strengths\" of risk factors, in the sense of how well they discriminate cases from controls, be compared when they are measured on different scales such as continuous, binary, and integer?

P.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThe process by which odd nitrogen species (atomic nitrogen and nitric oxide) are formed during atmospheric entry of meteoroids is analyzed theoretically. An ablating meteoroid is assumed to be a point source of mass with a continuum regime evolving in its wake. The amounts of odd nitrogen species, produced by high-temperature reactions of air in the continuum wake, are calculated by numerical integration of chemical rate equations. Flow properties are assumed to be uniform across the wake, and 29 reactions involving five neutral species and five singly ionized species are considered, as well as vibrational and electron temperature nonequilibrium phenomena. The results, when they are summed over the observed mass, velocity, and entry-angle distribution of meteoroids, provide odd-nitrogen-species annual global production rates as functions of altitude. The peak production of nitric oxide is found to occur at an altitude of about 85 km; atomic nitrogen production peaks at about 95 km. The total annual rate for nitric oxide is 40 million kg; for atomic nitrogen it is 170 million kg.\n\n42 CFR 484.230 - Methodology used for the calculation of the low-utilization payment adjustment.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 42 Public Health 5 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Methodology used for the calculation of the low...

DNA typing now is playing a more prominent role in the identification of human remains, and particularly so for highly decomposed and fragmented remains. The strength of genetic associations, by either direct or kinship analyses, is often quantified by calculating a likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio can be multiplied by prior odds based on nongenetic evidence to calculate the posterior odds, that is, by applying Bayes' Theorem, to arrive at a probability of identity. For the identification of human remains, the path creating the set and intersection of variables that contribute to the prior odds needs to be appreciated and well defined. Other than considering the total number of missing persons, the forensic DNA community has been silent on specifying the elements of prior odds computations. The variables include the number of missing individuals, eyewitness accounts, anthropological features, demographics and other identifying characteristics. The assumptions, supporting data and reasoning that are used to establish a prior probability that will be combined with the genetic data need to be considered and justified. Otherwise, data may be unintentionally or intentionally manipulated to achieve a probability of identity that cannot be supported and can thus misrepresent the uncertainty with associations. The forensic DNA community needs to develop guidelines for objectively computing prior odds.\n\nSystematization of Î±-decaying nuclei based on shell structures: The case of odd-even and odd-odd nuclei\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYarman, Tolga; Zaim, Nimet; Yarman, Ozan; Kholmetskii, Alexander; ArÄ±k, Metin\n\nIn previous studies, we provided a novel systematization of Î±-decaying even-even and even-odd nuclei starting with the classically adopted mechanism [T. Yarman et al., Eur. Phys. J. A 52 (2016) 140; Eur. Phys. J. A 53 (2017) 4]. Knowing beforehand the measured decay half-life, we had taken as a parameter the probability of the Î±-particle as being first born in a unit period of time, within the parent nucleus before it is emitted out. We thence developed a scaffold based on shell properties of families composed of âalike nucleiâ. Along the same line, we now present a systematization of odd-even (OE) as well as odd-odd (OO) nuclei. We apply our approach further to the investigation of the effect of pairing (e.g., the effect when the number of nucleons is increased by one neutron), and that of unpairing (e.g., the effect when the number of nucleons is decreased by one neutron); thus it becomes an even number for the case of odd-even nuclei (Case OE), and an odd number in the case of odd-odd nuclei (Case OO). For the first case (OE), we pick the exemplar set 161Re, 217Fr, 243Bk, 263Db; where we delineate by, respectively, Re, Fr, Bk, and Db all of the odd-even or odd-odd isotopes that neighbor the four mentioned odd-even isotopes on the proposed scaffold. We proceed in the same way for the second case (OO). Thus, we choose the exemplar set of odd-odd nuclei 172Ir, 218Ac, 244Es. We then gather all of the Ir, Ac, and Es odd-odd and odd-even isotopes that neighbor the three mentioned odd-odd isotopes on the proposed scaffold. We show that, in the former case, pairing, as expected, generally increases stability of the given nucleus; and in the latter case, unpairing works in just the opposite direction â i.e., it generally increases instability. We disclose âstability peaksâ versus Z for both sets of nuclei, we tackle here. Furthermore, we present a study to highlight an outlook of âodd-A nucleiâ at hand. Contrary to the general expectation, we unveil no\n\nMechanism for odd-electron anion generation of dihydroxybenzoic acid isomers in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry with density functional theory calculations.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamagaki, Tohru; Takeuchi, Michika; Watanabe, Takehiro; Sugahara, Kohtaro; Takeuchi, Takae\n\n2016-12-30\n\nProton and radical are transferred between matrices and matrix and analyte in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and these transfers drive ionization of analytes. The odd-electron anion [M-2H] â¢- was generated in dihydroxybenzoic acids (DHBs) and the ion abundance of the 2,5-DHB was the highest among six DHB isomers. We were interested in the mechanism of the ion generation of the odd-electron anion. The observed [M-2H] â¢- and [M-3H] - ions, which were generated with the hydrogen radical removed from the phenolic hydroxyl groups (OH) in DHB isomers, were analyzed using negative-ion MALDI-MS. The enthalpy for ion generation and their stable structures were calculated using the density functional theory (DFT) calculation program Gaussian 09 with the B3LYP functional and the 6-31+G(d) basis set. The number of observed [M-2H] â¢- and [M-3H] - ions of the DHB isomers was dependent on the positions of the phenolic OH groups in the DHB isomers because the carboxy group interacts with the ortho OH group due to neighboring group participation, as confirmed from the stable structures of the [M-2H] â¢- anions calculated with the Gaussian 09 program. The DHB isomers were placed into three categories according to the number of the ions. Odd-electron anions ([M-2H] â¢- ) and [M-2H â¢ -H] - ([M-3H] - ) ions were generated from DHB isomers due to removal of the hydrogen radical from the phenolic groups. The enthalpy for ion generation revealed that ion formation proceeds via a two-step pathway through the [M-M] - ion as an intermediate. Â© 2016 The Authors.

A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWhile probability forecasting has many philosophical and mathematical attractions, it is something of a dishonest nonsense if acting on such forecasts is expected to lead to rapid ruin. Model-based probabilities, when interpreted as actionable, are shown to lead to the rapid ruin of a cooperative entity offering odds interpreting the probability forecasts at face value. Arguably, these odds would not be considered \"fair\", but inasmuch as some definitions of \"fair odds\" include this case, this presentation will focus on \"sustainable odds\": Odds which are not expected to lead to the rapid ruin of the cooperative under the assumption that those placing bets have no information beyond that available to the forecast system. It is argued that sustainable odds will not correspond to probabilities outside the Perfect Model Scenario, that the \"implied probabilities\" determined from sustainable odds will always sum to more than one, and that the excess of this sum over one reflects the skill of the forecast system, being a quantitative measure of structural model error.\n\nUse of the Posterior/Anterior Corneal Curvature Radii Ratio to Improve the Accuracy of Intraocular Lens Power Calculation: Eom's Adjustment Method.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Mingue; Eom, Youngsub; Lee, Hwa; Suh, Young-Woo; Song, Jong Suk; Kim, Hyo Myung\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTo evaluate the accuracy of IOL power calculation using adjusted corneal power according to the posterior/anterior corneal curvature radii ratio. Nine hundred twenty-eight eyes from 928 reference subjects and 158 eyes from 158 cataract patients who underwent phacoemulsification surgery were enrolled. Adjusted corneal power of cataract patients was calculated using the fictitious refractive index that was obtained from the geometric mean posterior/anterior corneal curvature radii ratio of reference subjects and adjusted anterior and predicted posterior corneal curvature radii from conventional keratometry (K) using the posterior/anterior corneal curvature radii ratio. The median absolute error (MedAE) based on the adjusted corneal power was compared with that based on conventional K in the Haigis and SRK/T formulae. The geometric mean posterior/anterior corneal curvature radii ratio was 0.808, and the fictitious refractive index of the cornea for a single Scheimpflug camera was 1.3275. The mean difference between adjusted corneal power and conventional K was 0.05 diopter (D). The MedAE based on adjusted corneal power (0.31 D in the Haigis formula and 0.32 D in the SRK/T formula) was significantly smaller than that based on conventional K (0.41 D and 0.40 D, respectively; P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The percentage of eyes with refractive prediction error within Â± 0.50 D calculated using adjusted corneal power (74.7%) was significantly greater than that obtained using conventional K (62.7%) in the Haigis formula (P = 0.029). IOL power calculation using adjusted corneal power according to the posterior/anterior corneal curvature radii ratio provided more accurate refractive outcomes than calculation using conventional K.\n\nDirect comparison of risk-adjusted and non-risk-adjusted CUSUM analyses of coronary artery bypass surgery outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nNovick, Richard J; Fox, Stephanie A; Stitt, Larry W; Forbes, Thomas L; Steiner, Stefan\n\n2006-08-01\n\nWe previously applied non-risk-adjusted cumulative sum methods to analyze coronary bypass outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess the incremental advantage of risk-adjusted cumulative sum methods in this setting. Prospective data were collected in 793 consecutive patients who underwent coronary bypass grafting performed by a single surgeon during a period of 5 years. The composite occurrence of an \"adverse outcome\" included mortality or any of 10 major complications. An institutional logistic regression model for adverse outcome was developed by using 2608 contemporaneous patients undergoing coronary bypass. The predicted risk of adverse outcome in each of the surgeon's 793 patients was then calculated. A risk-adjusted cumulative sum curve was then generated after specifying control limits and odds ratio. This risk-adjusted curve was compared with the non-risk-adjusted cumulative sum curve, and the clinical significance of this difference was assessed. The surgeon's adverse outcome rate was 96 of 793 (12.1%) versus 270 of 1815 (14.9%) for all the other institution's surgeons combined (P = .06). The non-risk-adjusted curve reached below the lower control limit, signifying excellent outcomes between cases 164 and 313, 323 and 407, and 667 and 793, but transgressed the upper limit between cases 461 and 478. The risk-adjusted cumulative sum curve never transgressed the upper control limit, signifying that cases preceding and including 461 to 478 were at an increased predicted risk. Furthermore, if the risk-adjusted cumulative sum curve was reset to zero whenever a control limit was reached, it still signaled a decrease in adverse outcome at 166, 653, and 782 cases. Risk-adjusted cumulative sum techniques provide incremental advantages over non-risk-adjusted methods by not signaling a decrement in performance when preoperative patient risk is high.\n\nParent-adolescent conflict in teenagers with ADHD and ODD.\n\nPubMed\n\nEdwards, G; Barkley, R A; Laneri, M; Fletcher, K; Metevia, L\n\n2001-12-01\n\nEighty-seven male teens (ages 12-18 years) with ADHD/ODD and their parents were compared to 32 male teens and their parents in a community control (CC) group on mother, father, and teen ratings of parent-teen conflict and communication quality, parental self-reports of psychological adjustment, and direct observations of parent-teen problem-solving interactions during a neutral and conflict discussion. Parents and teens in the ADHD/ODD group rated themselves as having significantly more issues involving parent-teen conflict, more anger during these conflict discussions, and more negative communication generally, and used more aggressive conflict tactics with each other than did parents and teens in the CC group. During a neutral discussion, only the ADHD/ODD teens demonstrated more negative behavior. During the conflict discussion, however, the mothers, fathers, and teens in the ADHD/ODD group displayed more negative behavior, and the mothers and teens showed less positive behavior than did participants in the CC group. Differences in conflicts related to sex of parent were evident on only a few measures. Both mother and father self-rated hostility contributed to the level of mother-teen conflict whereas father self-rated hostility and anxiety contributed to father-teen conflict beyond the contribution made by level of teen ODD and ADHD symptoms. Results replicated past studies of mother-child interactions in ADHD/ODD children, extended these results to teens with these disorders, showed that greater conflict also occurs in father-teen interactions, and found that degree of parental hostility, but not ADHD symptoms, further contributed to levels of parent-teen conflict beyond the contribution made by severity of teen ADHD and ODD symptoms.\n\nBeyond Body Mass Index: Using Anthropometric Measures and Body Composition Indicators to Assess Odds of an Endometriosis Diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBackonja, Uba; Hediger, Mary L; Chen, Zhen; Lauver, Diane R; Sun, Liping; Peterson, C Matthew; Buck Louis, Germaine M\n\n2017-09-01\n\nBody mass index (BMI) and endometriosis have been inversely associated. To address gaps in this research, we examined associations among body composition, endometriosis, and physical activity. Women from 14 clinical sites in the Salt Lake City, Utah and San Francisco, California areas and scheduled for laparoscopy/laparotomy were recruited during 2007-2009. Participants (Nâ=â473) underwent standardized anthropometric assessments to estimate body composition before surgery. Using a cross-sectional design, odds of an endometriosis diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for anthropometric and body composition measures (weight in kg; height in cm; mid upper arm, waist, hip, and chest circumferences in cm; subscapular, suprailiac, and triceps skinfold thicknesses in mm; arm muscle and fat areas in cm 2 ; centripetal fat, chest-to-waist, chest-to-hip, waist-to-hip, and waist-to-height ratios; arm fat index; and BMI in kg/m 2 ). Physical activity (metabolic equivalent of task-minutes/week) and sedentariness (average minutes sitting on a weekday) were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Measures were modeled continuously and in quartiles based on sample estimates. Adjusted models were controlled for age (years, continuous), site (Utah/California), smoking history (never, former, or current smoker), and income (below, within 180%, and above of the poverty line). Findings were standardized by dividing variables by their respective standard deviations. We used adjusted models to examine whether odds of an endometriosis diagnosis were moderated by physical activity or sedentariness. Inverse relationships were observed between endometriosis and standardized: weight (aORâ=â0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.88); subscapular skinfold thickness (aORâ=â0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.98); waist and hip circumferences (aORâ=â0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.98 and aORâ=â0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.94, respectively); total\n\nIntraocular lens calculation adjustment after laser refractive surgery using Scheimpflug imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchuster, Alexander K; Schanzlin, David J; Thomas, Karin E; Heichel, Christopher W; Purcell, Tracy L; Barker, Patrick D\n\n2016-02-01\n\nTo test a new method of intraocular lens (IOL) calculation after corneal refractive surgery using Scheimpflug imaging (Pentacam HR) and partial coherence interferometry (PCI) (IOLMaster) that does not require historical data; that is, the Schuster/Schanzlin-Thomas-Purcell (SToP) IOL calculator. Shiley Eye Center, San Diego, California, and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. Retrospective data analysis and validation study. Data were retrospectively collected from patient charts including data from Scheimpflug imaging and refractive history. Target refraction was calculated using PCI and the Holladay 1 and SRK/T formulas. Regression analysis was performed to explain the deviation of the target refraction, taking into account the following influencing factors: ratio of posterior-to-anterior corneal radius, axial length (AL), and anterior corneal radius. The regression analysis study included 61 eyes (39 patients) that had laser in situ keratomileusis (57 eyes) or photorefractive keratectomy (4 eyes) and subsequent cataract. Two factors were found that explained the deviation of the target refraction using the Holladay 1 formula; that is, the ratio of the corneal radii and the AL and the ratio of corneal radii for the SRK/T formula. A new IOL adjustment calculator was derived and validated at a second center using 14 eyes (10 patients). The error in IOL calculation for normal eyes after laser refractive treatment was related to the ratio of posterior-to-anterior corneal radius. A formula requiring Scheimpflug data and suggested IOL power only yielded an improved postoperative result for patients with previous corneal laser refractive surgery having cataract surgery.

We use an intense, nonresonant femtosecond laser pulse superimposed with its phase-controlled second harmonic field to impulsively align and orient a dense sample of molecules from which we subsequently generate high-order harmonics. The even harmonics appear around the full revivals of the rotational dynamics. We demonstrate perfect coherent control over their intensity through the subcycle delay of the two-color fields. The odd harmonics are insensitive to the degree of orientation, but modulate with the degree of axis alignment, in agreement with calculated photorecombination dipole moments. We further compare the shape of the even and odd harmonic spectra with our calculations and determine the degree of orientation.\n\nCalculation of (P,T) -odd electric dipole moments for the diamagnetic atoms X129e , Y171b , H199g , R211n , and R225a\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDzuba, V.

The single fermion is assumed to be in one of the lh{sub 9/2},3p{sub 3/2},2f{sub 5/2}, and 3p{sub 1/2} single-particle orbits. It was found that the calculated negative parity state energy spectra of the even-odd erbium isotopes agree quite well with the experimental data. The B(E2) values were also calculated and compared with the experimental data.\n\nMothersâ Caries Increases Odds of Childrenâs Caries\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWeintraub, J.A.; Prakash, P.; Shain, S.G.; Laccabue, M.; Gansky, S.A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThere are many determinants of childrenâs dental caries. We hypothesized that a motherâs untreated caries was associated with increased likelihood of her childrenâs untreated caries, after controlling for other factors. This population-based study was conducted in a rural, primarily Hispanic, California community. Interview and dental examination data for mother-child (children < 18 yrs old) dyads were analyzed. In a Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) logit model for mothers (n = 179) and children (n = 387), maternal untreated caries was a statistically significant correlate of childâs untreated caries, odds ratio (OR) = 1.76 (95%CI: 1.10, 2.70), adjusted for demographic factors. This relationship did not change when behavioral and dental utilization factors were added to the model, OR = 1.85 (95% CI: 1.12, 3.07). Maternal untreated caries almost doubled the odds of childrenâs untreated caries and significantly increased childâs caries severity by about 3 surfaces. Caries prevention and dental utilization programs for mothers and their children should be increased.

Our aim is to understand these systematic features within the framework of particle rotor model including both a residual pn interaction and a Î³ deformation. Signature inversion is present in the bands of odd-odd nuclei , ^120-130Cs, ^124-132La, ^126-134Pr and ^132-136Pm and having an yrast structure built on Ï h_11/2Î½ h_11/2 orbitals. Pr isotopes seem to indicate an inversion decreasing for smaller neutron numbers, trend that is opposite for the Cs nuclei(J.F. Smith et al., Phys. Lett B 406, 7 (1997)). Why? A question that remains to be answered is if there is any relation of signature inversion to chiral twin bands (two ''look alike positive parity'' bands proposed for as in ). The lower band has signature inversion all the way up. Could these effects be related to triaxiality? Can one trust an apparent conclusion suggested by L.L. Riedinger( L.L. Riedinger, talk presented at High) Spin Physics 2001, Warsaw, Poland, February, 2001, to be published in Acta Phys. Pol.: ''signature inversion in an odd-odd band of two quasiparticles pointed along different axes is always associated with the formation of chiral twin bands''?\n\nQuantifying and Adjusting for Disease Misclassification Due to Loss to Follow-Up in Historical Cohort Mortality Studies.\n\nPubMed\n\nScott, Laura L F; Maldonado, George\n\n2015-10-15\n\nThe purpose of this analysis was to quantify and adjust for disease misclassification from loss to follow-up in a historical cohort mortality study of workers where exposure was categorized as a multi-level variable. Disease classification parameters were defined using 2008 mortality data for the New Zealand population and the proportions of known deaths observed for the cohort. The probability distributions for each classification parameter were constructed to account for potential differences in mortality due to exposure status, gender, and ethnicity. Probabilistic uncertainty analysis (bias analysis), which uses Monte Carlo techniques, was then used to sample each parameter distribution 50,000 times, calculating adjusted odds ratios (ORDM-LTF) that compared the mortality of workers with the highest cumulative exposure to those that were considered never-exposed. The geometric mean ORDM-LTF ranged between 1.65 (certainty interval (CI): 0.50-3.88) and 3.33 (CI: 1.21-10.48), and the geometric mean of the disease-misclassification error factor (ÎµDM-LTF), which is the ratio of the observed odds ratio to the adjusted odds ratio, had a range of 0.91 (CI: 0.29-2.52) to 1.85 (CI: 0.78-6.07). Only when workers in the highest exposure category were more likely than those never-exposed to be misclassified as non-cases did the ORDM-LTF frequency distributions shift further away from the null. The application of uncertainty analysis to historical cohort mortality studies with multi-level exposures can provide valuable insight into the magnitude and direction of study error resulting from losses to follow-up.\n\nProjected shell model study of odd-odd f-p-g shell proton-rich nuclei\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPalit, R.; Sheikh, J.

The first excited configurations in the odd parity system are 5d36s2 (6p+7p+5f+6f)+5d46s6p. Further excitation leads to large number of configurations. However the configuration 5d56p belonging to the odd parity was obtained by doubly exciting the 5d46s6p configuration. Relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) and least squares fitted (LSF) parametric calculations were carried out to interpret the observed spectrum recorded on a 1.5-m Wadsworth spectrograph at our laboratory in the wavelength region 2300Ã to 4500Ã . We confirmed the earlier reported ground configuration 5d46s2 and excited configuration 5d46s6p. Almost fifty new transitions establishing 22 energy levels belonging to the configuration 5d36s26p have been identified.\n\nIncreased mortality odds ratio of male liver cancer in a community contaminated by chlorinated hydrocarbons in groundwater\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, L; Chung, C; Ma, Y; Wang, G; Chen, P; Hwang, Y; Wang, J\n\n2003-01-01\n\nAims: To investigate the association between cancer mortality risk and exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons in groundwater of a downstream community near a contaminated site. Methods: Death certificates inclusive for the years 1966â97 were collected from two villages in the vicinity of an electronics factory operated between 1970 and 1992. These two villages were classified into the downstream (exposed) village and the upstream (unexposed) according to groundwater flow direction. Exposure classification was validated by the contaminant levels in 49 residential wells measured with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Mortality odds ratios (MORs) for cancer were calculated with cardiovascular-cerebrovascular diseases as the reference diseases. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to estimate the effects of exposure and period after adjustment for age. Results: Increased MORs were observed among males for all cancer, and liver cancer for the periods after 10 years of latency, namely, 1980â89, and 1990â97. Adjusted MOR for male liver cancer was 2.57 (95% confidence interval 1.21 to 5.46) with a significant linear trend for the period effect. Conclusion: The results suggest a link between exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons and male liver cancer risk. However, the conclusion is limited by lack of individual information on groundwater exposure and potential confounding factors.

In order to check the assignments of this band, two calculation schemes are put into practice. The first one is for previous Ïh11/2 otimes Î½g7/2 configuration with bandhead spin I0 = (6-) which was obtained from cranked shell model (CSM) calculation, and the other one is for Ïh11/2 otimes Î½h11/2 configuration with I0 = (9+) supported by the systematic analyses of experimental data. A qualitative comparison between the present PRM calculation and that of CSM has also been made. The results indicate that, rather than Ïh11/2 otimes Î½g7/2 with I0 = (6-), Ïh11/2 otimes Î½h11/2 with I0 = (9+) is a more reasonable assignment to the yrast band in 122Cs.\n\nMiddle atmosphere heating by exothermic chemical reactions involving odd-hydrogen species\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMlynczak, Martin G.; Solomon, Susan\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe rate of heating which occurs in the middle atmosphere due to four exothermic reactions involving members of the odd-hydrogen family is calculated.

These data are often analyzed using ordinal logistic regression models that assume proportional odds. When this assumption is not met, it may be possible to capture the lack of proportionality using a constrained structural relationship between the odds and the cut-points of the ordinal values (Peterson and Harrell, 1990). We consider a trend odds version of this constrained model, where the odds parameter increases or decreases in a monotonic manner across the cut-points. We demonstrate algebraically and graphically how this model is related to latent logistic, normal, and exponential distributions. In particular, we find that scale changes in these potential latent distributions are consistent with the trend odds assumption, with the logistic and exponential distributions having odds that increase in a linear or nearly linear fashion. We show how to fit this model using SAS Proc Nlmixed, and perform simulations under proportional odds and trend odds processes. We find that the added complexity of the trend odds model gives improved power over the proportional odds model when there are moderate to severe departures from proportionality. A hypothetical dataset is used to illustrate the interpretation of the trend odds model, and we apply this model to a Swine Influenza example where the proportional odds assumption appears to be violated.

Risk adjustment is accomplished using accelerated failure time regression models. We compare the average run length performance of the RAST CUSUM chart to the risk-adjusted Bernoulli CUSUM chart, using data from cardiac surgeries to motivate the details of the comparison. The comparisons show that the RAST CUSUM chart is moremoreÂ Â» efficient at detecting a sudden decrease in the odds of death than the risk-adjusted Bernoulli CUSUM chart, especially when the fraction of censored observations is not too high. We also discuss the implementation of a prospective monitoring scheme using the RAST CUSUM chart.Â«Â less\n\nTime does not heal all wounds: older adults who experienced childhood adversities have higher odds of mood, anxiety, and personality disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nRaposo, Sarah M; Mackenzie, Corey S; Henriksen, Christine A; Afifi, Tracie O\n\n2014-11-01\n\nWe aimed to examine the prevalence of several types of childhood adversity across adult cohorts, whether age moderates the effect of childhood adversity on mental health, the relationship between childhood adversity and psychopathology among older adults, the dose-response relationship between number of types of childhood adversities and mental disorders in later life, and whether lifetime mental health treatment reduces the odds of psychopathology among older survivors of childhood adversity. In a population-based, cross-sectional study on a nationally representative U.S. sample, we studied 34,653 community-dwelling Americans 20 years and older, including 7,080 adults 65 years and older from Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Trained lay interviewers assessed past-year mood and anxiety disorders and lifetime personality disorders. Participants self-reported childhood adversity based on questions from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study. Childhood adversity was prevalent across five age cohorts. In our adjusted models, age did not moderate the effect of childhood adversity on mental disorders. Older adults who experienced childhood adversity had higher odds of having mood (odds ratio: 1.73; 95% confidence interval: 1.32-2.28), anxiety (odds ratio: 1.48; 95% confidence interval: 1.20-1.83), and personality disorders (odds ratio: 2.11; 95% confidence interval: 1.75-2.54) after adjusting for covariates. An increasing number of types of childhood adversities was associated with higher odds of personality disorders and somewhat higher odds of anxiety disorders. Treatment-seeking was associated with a reduced likelihood of anxiety and, especially, mood disorders in older adult childhood adversity survivors. These results emphasize the importance of preventing childhood adversity and intervening once it occurs to avoid the negative mental health effects that can last into old age.

Quartets are four-body correlated structures characterized by isospin T and angular momentum J. We show that the ground state correlations induced by a realistic shell model interaction can be well accounted for in terms of a restricted set of T = 0 low-J quartets, the J = 0 one playing by far a leading role among them. A conceptually similar description of odd-odd self-conjugate nuclei is given in terms of two distinct families of building blocks, one formed by the same T = 0 quartets employed for the even-even systems and the other by collective pairs with either T = 0 or T = 1. Some applications of this formalism are discussed for nuclei in the sd shell.\n\nCalculating summary statistics for population chemical biomonitoring in women of childbearing age with adjustment for age-specific natality.\n\nPubMed\n\nAxelrad, Daniel A; Cohen, Jonathan\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe effects of chemical exposures during pregnancy on children's health have been an increasing focus of environmental health research in recent years, leading to greater interest in biomonitoring of chemicals in women of childbearing age in the general population. Measurements of mercury in blood from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey are frequently reported for \"women of childbearing age,\" defined to be of ages 16-49 years. The intent is to represent prenatal chemical exposure, but blood mercury levels increase with age. Furthermore, women of different ages have different probabilities of giving birth. We evaluated options to address potential bias in biomonitoring summary statistics for women of childbearing age by accounting for age-specific probabilities of giving birth. We calculated median and 95th percentile levels of mercury, PCBs, and cotinine using these approaches: option 1: women aged 16-49 years without natality adjustment; option 2: women aged 16-39 years without natality adjustment; option 3: women aged 16-49 years, adjusted for natality by age; option 4: women aged 16-49 years, adjusted for natality by age and race/ethnicity. Among the three chemicals examined, the choice of option has the greatest impact on estimated levels of serum PCBs, which are strongly associated with age. Serum cotinine levels among Black non-Hispanic women of childbearing age are understated when age-specific natality is not considered. For characterizing in utero exposures, adjustment using age-specific natality provides a substantial improvement in estimation of biomonitoring summary statistics. Copyright ÃÂ© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Maria; Tchetgen Tchetgen, Eric J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDespite the recent flourishing of mediation analysis techniques, many modern approaches are difficult to implement or applicable to only a restricted range of regression models. This report provides practical guidance for implementing a new technique utilizing inverse odds ratio weighting (IORW) to estimate natural direct and indirect effects for mediation analyses. IORW takes advantage of the odds ratio's invariance property and condenses information on the odds ratio for the relationship between the exposure (treatment) and multiple mediators, conditional on covariates, by regressing exposure on mediators and covariates. The inverse of the covariate-adjusted exposure-mediator odds ratio association is used to weight the primary analytical regression of the outcome on treatment. The treatment coefficient in such a weighted regression estimates the natural direct effect of treatment on the outcome, and indirect effects are identified by subtracting direct effects from total effects. Weighting renders treatment and mediators independent, thereby deactivating indirect pathways of the mediators. This new mediation technique accommodates multiple discrete or continuous mediators. IORW is easily implemented and is appropriate for any standard regression model, including quantile regression and survival analysis. An empirical example is given using data from the Moving to Opportunity (1994â2002) experiment, testing whether neighborhood context mediated the effects of a housing voucher program on obesity.

Recently, ballistic parachute recovery systems (BPRS) have been introduced as a safety feature in some GA aircraft. This study evaluates the effectiveness and associated factors of the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) at reducing the odds of a fatal accident in Cirrus aircraft crashes. Publicly available Cirrus aircraft crash reports were obtained from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database for the period of January 1, 2001-December 31, 2016. Accident metrics were evaluated through univariate and multivariate analyses regarding odds of a fatal accident and use of the parachute system. Included in the study were 268 accidents. For CAPS nondeployed accidents, 82 of 211 (38.9%) were fatal as compared to 8 of 57 (14.0%) for CAPS deployed accidents. After controlling for all other factors, the adjusted odds ratio for a fatal accident when CAPS was not deployed was 13.1. The substantial increased odds of a fatal accident when CAPS was not deployed demonstrated the effectiveness of CAPS at providing protection of occupants during an accident. Injuries were shifted from fatal to serious or minor with the use of CAPS and postcrash fires were significantly reduced. These results suggest that BPRS could play a significant role in the next major advance in improving GA accident survival.Alaziz M, Stolfi A, Olson DM.

In general, amine-linked cages, obtained by the reduction of corresponding imines, are not shape-persistent in the crystalline form. Moreover, they require multistep synthesis. Herein, a one-pot synthesis of four new amine-linked organic cages by the reaction of 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp) with different analogues of alkanediamine is reported. The POCs resulting from the odd diamine (having an odd number of -CH 2 groups) is conformationally eclipsed, while the POCs constructed from even diamines adopt a gauche conformation. This odd-even alternation in the conformation of POCs has been supported by computational calculations. The synthetic strategy hinges on the concept of Schiff base condensation reaction followed by keto-enol tautomerization. This mechanism is the key for the exceptional chemical stability of cages and facilitates their resistance towards acids and bases. Â© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The positive-parity states from this work together with compiled data from the available literature for 185-199Au are compared to Interacting Boson Fermion Model calculations employing the Spin(6) Bose-Fermi symmetry. The evolution of the parameters for the Ï splitting and the J splitting reveals a smooth behavior. Thereby, a common description based on the Bose-Fermi symmetry is found for 189-199Au. Furthermore, the calculated E2 transition strengths are compared to experimental values with fixed effective boson and fermion charges for all odd-even gold isotopes, emphasizing that the Spin(6) Bose-Fermi symmetry is valid for the gold isotopes.\n\nDiagnostic specificity of poor premorbid adjustment: Comparison of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and mood disorder with psychotic features\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTarbox, Sarah I.; Brown, Leslie H.; Haas, Gretchen L.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIndividuals with schizophrenia have significant deficits in premorbid social and academic adjustment compared to individuals with non-psychotic diagnoses. However, it is unclear how severity and developmental trajectory of premorbid maladjustment compare across psychotic disorders. This study examined the association between premorbid functioning (in childhood, early adolescence, and late adolescence) and psychotic disorder diagnosis in a first-episode sample of 105 individuals: schizophrenia (n=68), schizoaffective disorder (n=22), and mood disorder with psychotic features (n=15). Social and academic maladjustment was assessed using the Cannon-Spoor Premorbid Adjustment Scale. Worse social functioning in late adolescence was associated with higher odds of schizophrenia compared to odds of either schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder with psychotic features, independently of child and early adolescent maladjustment. Greater social dysfunction in childhood was associated with higher odds of schizoaffective disorder compared to odds of schizophrenia. Premorbid decline in academic adjustment was observed for all groups, but did not predict diagnosis at any stage of development. Results suggest that social functioning is disrupted in the premorbid phase of both schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, but remains fairly stable in mood disorders with psychotic features. Disparities in the onset and time course of social dysfunction suggest important developmental differences between schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

This study compared 74 children aged 4-8Â years with ODD to 45 comparison children (33 healthy; 12 with an anxiety disorder) on behaviourally assessed measures of emotion perception, emotion perspective-taking, knowledge of emotions causes and understanding ambivalent emotions and on parent-reported cognitive and affective empathy. Adjusting for child's sex, age and expressive language ODD children showed a paucity in attributing causes to emotions but no other deficits relative to the comparison groups. ODD boys with high levels of callous-unemotional traits (CU) (nÂ =Â 22) showed deficits relative to low CU ODD boys (nÂ =Â 25) in emotion perspective-taking and in understanding ambivalent emotions. Low CU ODD boys did not differ from the healthy typically developing boys (nÂ =Â 12). Impairments in emotion perceptive-taking and understanding mixed emotions in ODD boys are associated with the presence of a high level of CU.\n\nThe ODD protocol: A review and first update\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGrimm, Volker; Berger, Uta; DeAngelis, Donald L.; Polhill, J. Gary; Giske, Jarl; Railsback, Steve F.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe 'ODD' (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol was published in 2006 to standardize the published descriptions of individual-based and agent-based models (ABMs). The primary objectives of ODD are to make model descriptions more understandable and complete, thereby making ABMs less subject to criticism for being irreproducible. We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models.\n\nOdd-frequency pairing in superconducting heterostructures .\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGolubov, A. A.; Tanaka, Y.; Yokoyama, T.; Asano, Y.\n\n2007-03-01\n\nWe present a general theory of the proximity effect in junctions between unconventional superconductors and diffusive normal metals (DN) or ferromagnets (DF). We consider all possible symmetry classes in a superconductor allowed by the Pauli principle: even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity state, even-frequency spin-triplet odd-parity state, odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity state and odd-frequency spin-singlet odd-parity state. For each of the above states, symmetry and spectral properties of the induced pair amplitude in the DN (DF) are determined. The cases of junctions with spin-singlet s- and d-wave superconductors and spin-triplet p-wave superconductors are adressed in detail. We discuss the interplay between the proximity effect and midgap Andreev bound states arising at interfaces in unconventional (d- or p-wave) junctions. The most striking property is the odd-frequency symmetry of the pairing amplitude induced in DN (DF) in contacts with p-wave superconductors. This leads to zero-energy singularity in the density of states and to anomalous screening of an external magnetic field. Peculiarities of Josephson effect in d- or p-wave junctions are discussed. Experiments are suggested to detect an order parameter symmetry using heterostructures with unconventional superconductors.\n\nUsing Quantile and Asymmetric Least Squares Regression for Optimal Risk Adjustment.\n\nPubMed\n\nLorenz, Normann\n\n2017-06-01\n\nIn this paper, we analyze optimal risk adjustment for direct risk selection (DRS). Integrating insurers' activities for risk selection into a discrete choice model of individuals' health insurance choice shows that DRS has the structure of a contest. For the contest success function (csf) used in most of the contest literature (the Tullock-csf), optimal transfers for a risk adjustment scheme have to be determined by means of a restricted quantile regression, irrespective of whether insurers are primarily engaged in positive DRS (attracting low risks) or negative DRS (repelling high risks). This is at odds with the common practice of determining transfers by means of a least squares regression. However, this common practice can be rationalized for a new csf, but only if positive and negative DRSs are equally important; if they are not, optimal transfers have to be calculated by means of a restricted asymmetric least squares regression. Using data from German and Swiss health insurers, we find considerable differences between the three types of regressions. Optimal transfers therefore critically depend on which csf represents insurers' incentives for DRS and, if it is not the Tullock-csf, whether insurers are primarily engaged in positive or negative DRS.

A total of 13,920 Hispanic/Latinos aged 18-74 years of different heritages underwent a full-mouth oral examination and completed two 24hr dietary recalls during 2008-2011. Severe periodontitis was defined as having â¥30% tooth sites with clinical attachment loss â¥ 5mm. Diet quality was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010). We evaluated the association of diet quality with severe periodontitis adjusting for age, sex, nativity status, income, education, last dental visit, current insurance, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and energy intake. Relative to those at the lowest quartile of diet quality, individuals at the highest quartile had significantly lower odds of severe periodontitis (adjusted OR=0.57, 95% CI: 0.39-0.82), with evidence of a dose-response relationship across AHEI quartiles. Among AHEI-2010 components, higher consumption of whole grains and fruits, and lower consumption of red/processed meats were associated with lower odds of severe periodontitis. Better diet quality was associated with lower prevalence of severe periodontitis, though the causal pathways need to be clarified in future work. This article is protected by copyright.

Most of the individual ADHD/ODD symptoms showed convergent and discriminant validity with the loadings and thresholds being invariant over mothers, fathers and teachers in both samples (the three latent factor means were higher for parents than teachers). The ADHD-IN, ADHD-HI and ODD latent factors demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity between mothers and fathers within the two samples. Convergent and discriminant validity between parents and teachers for the three factors was either absent (Thai sample) or only partial (Spanish sample). The application of exploratory SEM to a multiple indicator by multitrait by multisource model should prove useful for the evaluation of the construct validity of the forthcoming DSM-V ADHD/ODD rating scales.\n\nSleep duration, vital exhaustion, and odds of spontaneous preterm birth: a case-control study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKajeepeta, Sandhya; Sanchez, Sixto E; Gelaye, Bizu; Qiu, Chunfang; Barrios, Yasmin V; Enquobahrie, Daniel A; Williams, Michelle A\n\n2014-09-27\n\nPreterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, resulting in a pressing need to identify risk factors leading to effective interventions. Limited evidence suggests potential relationships between maternal sleep or vital exhaustion and preterm birth, yet the literature is generally inconclusive. We examined the relationship between maternal sleep duration and vital exhaustion in the first six months of pregnancy and spontaneous (non-medically indicated) preterm birth among 479 Peruvian women who delivered a preterm singleton infant (<37 weeks gestation) and 480 term controls who delivered a singleton infant at term (â¥37 weeks gestation). Maternal nightly sleep and reports of vital exhaustion were ascertained through in-person interviews. Spontaneous preterm birth cases were further categorized as those following either spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. In addition, cases were categorized as very (<32 weeks), moderate (32-33 weeks), and late (34-â<37 weeks) preterm birth for additional analyses. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). After adjusting for confounders, we found that short sleep duration (â¤6 hours) was significantly associated with preterm birth (aOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.11-2.19) compared to 7-8 hours of sleep. Vital exhaustion was also associated with increased odds of preterm birth (aOR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.79-3.23) compared to no exhaustion (Ptrend <0.001). These associations remained significant for spontaneous preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes. We also found evidence of joint effects of sleep duration and vital exhaustion on the odds of spontaneous preterm birth. The results of this case-control study suggest maternal sleep duration, particularly short sleep duration, and vital exhaustion may be risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth. These findings call for increased clinical attention to\n\nOdd Shape Out\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCady, Jo Ann; Wells, Pamela\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Odd Shape Out task was an open-ended problem that engaged students in comparing shapes based on their properties.

PDs were assessed using the Semistructured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders (SCID-II). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to determine significant comorbidity among OCPD and other axis II disorders. The most elevated odds ratios were found for the cooccurrence of OCPD with cluster A PDs (the \"odd\" PDs, or paranoid and schizoid PDs). These results are consistent with those of previous studies showing a higher cooccurrence of OCPD with cluster A than with cluster C (\"anxious\") PDs. In light of these observations, issues associated with the nosologic status of OCPD within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders clustering system remain unsettled.\n\nAgainst All Odds\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nManzo, Kathleen Kennedy\n\n2005-01-01\n\nMore than a decade ago, no one held out much hope for the poor, immigrant children at Kennedy Middle School.

The results obtained for two models of the eccentricity - the Glauber and the factorized Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (fKLN) models - indicate magnitudes which are essentially zero. They suggest that a possible correlation between the orientations of the odd and even participant planes ({Psi}{sub n+1} and {Psi}{sub n}, respectively) does not have a significant influence on the calculated eccentricities. An experimental verification test for correlations between the orientationsmoreÂ Â» of the odd and even participant planes is also proposed.Â«Â less\n\nRedundant prepuce increases the odds of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS).\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Yu-Yang; Xu, Dong-Liang; Zhao, Fu-Jun; Han, Bang-Min; Shao, Yi; Zhao, Wei; Xia, Shu-Jie\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSome published evidence has revealed that the dendritic cells can interact with pathogens that exist in the inner foreskin. This information provides a new vision that pathogens could play a role through the redundant prepuce; numerous studies have failed to find pathogens in prostates of patients who had chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). However, no studies have reported an association between foreskin length and CP/CPPS. Hence, we conducted a retrospective case-control study of clinical data from 322 CP/CPPS patients (case group) and 341 nonCP/CPPS patients (control group). Demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and foreskin lengths were collected and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was adopted to calculate the odds of foreskin length for CP/CPPS. According to the multivariate logistic regression results, when the foreskin length covered up more than half of the glans penis, the odds for CP/CPPS were higher with an increased foreskin (odds ratio (OR): 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-2.66). In comparison, when the glans penis was completely covered by the foreskin, the OR value increased to 1.86 (95% CI, 1.2-2.88). The study results showed an association between foreskin length and the odds of CP/CPPS. When the foreskin length covered up more than half of the glans penis, there were greater odds for CP/CPPS. This possible mechanism might result from interaction between pathogens and DCs in the inner foreskin, consequently activating T-cells to mediate allergic inflammation in the prostate and producing the autoimmunizations causing CP/CPPS.\n\nIs adherence to weight monitoring or weight-based diuretic self-adjustment associated with fewer heart failure-related emergency department visits or hospitalizations?\n\nPubMed\n\nJones, Christine D; Holmes, George M; Dewalt, Darren A; Erman, Brian; Broucksou, Kimberly; Hawk, Victoria; Cene, Crystal W; Wu, Jia-Rong; Pignone, Michael\n\n2012-07-01\n\nHeart failure (HF) self-care interventions can improve outcomes, but less than optimal adherence may limit their effectiveness. We evaluated if adherence to weight monitoring and diuretic self-adjustment was associated with HF-related emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. We performed a case-control analysis nested in a HF self-care randomized trial. Participants received HF self-care training, including weight monitoring and diuretic self-adjustment, which they were to record in a diary. We defined case time periods as HF-related ED visits or hospitalizations in the 7 preceding days; control time periods were defined as 7-day periods free of ED visits and hospitalizations. We used logistic regression to compare weight monitoring and diuretic self-adjustment adherence in case and control time periods, adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates. Among 303 participants, we identified 81 HF-related ED visits or hospitalizations (cases) in 54 patients over 1 year of follow-up. Weight monitoring adherence (odds ratio [OR] 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.76) and diuretic self-adjustment adherence (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19-0.98) were both associated with lower adjusted odds of HF-related ED visits or hospitalizations. Adherence to weight monitoring and diuretic self-adjustment was assoc"
