        "text": "Biographies from History of Running Water, 1989\n\nIvan Echelberger\n\nIvan Echelberger worked for the Northwestern Public Service Co. for several years. He recalls many things about Running Water. The first line to Running Water was put in 1929, electricity to the homes was the following year (not many home hooked up).\n\nIvan remembers one year, several people from Running Water took their cars across on the ferry boat to tour around Niobrara, when they came home the hill from the ferry was wet and no one could make it to the top, so the Gowlings used a rope from the ferry and tied it onto their car that was at the top of the hill and pulled everyone to the top.\n\nPeter & Dora Dykstra\n\nPeter and Dora (Vanderlie) Dykstra lived one half mile north of Running Water. They moved there in 1924. There children are Andrew, Annie, Jayson, Jessie, Marie, Mable, Ruth, Raymond, Donald, and Darwin. The children all attended the Running Water School.\n\nPeter farmed and Dora was a homemaker. Deceased family members are Raymond in 1982, Peter (father) in 1972, and Andrew in 1965.\n\nFrank & Lena DeRoos\n\nFrank and Lena Oorlog DeRoos were married March 19, 1903. They made their first home on a farm east of Tyndall. Later they moved to a farm north of Running Water, and from there to Perkins, where he operated a blacksmiths shop. Moving from there to ar farm near Springfield. He retired from farming in 1931 and moved to Running Water living there until his death February 13, 1949.\n\nThey were the parents of 13 children: Cora, Hattie, Jennie, Grace, John, twins George and Nick, Frank, Clarence, twins Pearl and Oscar, Frances, and Robert.\n\nSeveral of their younger children attended the Running Water school. George, Nick, and Clarence worked for John Fitch on the ferry. Clarence recalls on days when there were no cars to cross he got 25 cents a day, when there were 10 cars he got 50 cents a day.\n\nSix of the grandchildren were born at the grandparents home here in Running Water.\n\nAs teh oldest grandchild I remember going to Grandpa and Grandma's house for Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners, and also on Sundays quite often. The may uncles, aunts, and cousins would come too, making quite a house full. The children were fed first and then the adults. Grandma's chicken and dressing were the best.\n\nMany times my cousins and I would ride the ferry boat (free).\n\nby Leona Ruppelt\n\nClarence DeRoos\n\nClarence DeRoos moved to Running Water with his parents, Frank and Lena in 1931.\n\nHe was in the 8th grade and the teacher was Margaret Malone. He and some of the other members of his family along with the Williams girls put on a play in the town hall.\n\nWinter days were fun days for us kids when we could sleigh ride down Running Water hill onto the ice. I also helped John Fitch put up ice. John would saw the ice part way then Clarence would finish the cutting, they put it in the ice building that was located west of John's home. John sold ice to many, one he could remember was the Dutch Church.\n\nClarence also worked on the ferry and was also a janitor for the Congregational Church for 3 years. He rented the little Hunt home for a few year where he had some cows, pigs, and chickens.\n\nRunning Water was home for him until 1940. Clarence is staying in Yankton at the home of one of his daughters for the winter (Duane and Deanna Hill). Before leaving their home Clarence made a comment that seems to be the feelings of many that I have talked to.\n\n\"Running Water! Everyone who lived there was your \"family,\" you were in touch with them everyday.\"\n\nBob DeRoos\n\nBob DeRoos moved to Running Water with his parents, Frank and Lena in 1931. He was the youngest of 13 children. He attended the Running Water School. Many of his memories were good and some sound a little mischievious, so we would like to share some of them with you.\n\nLike the time Bob and the Gowling boy would sleigh ride down Running Water hill and one time they couldn't make the corner at the boom and they tore out the fence of Malones (Bob didn't say who fixed it).\n\nHis one friend, \"Stinky\" Sherman, came by his nickname for a reason. Stinky came to school one day with some rotten cheese (fish bait) stuck on the bib of his overhauls and he smelled BAD!\n\nBob and Doug Williams tried to lower themselves down the chalk rock bluffs one day, as to get inside the cave (no luck).\n\nHe also remembers playing on a steel hull from one of the galvinized life boats that was below their place. In latter years the river washed it away.\n\nHe and a friend also rolled tires down the hills and one of them hit the apron on the ferry and broke thru and broke the apron on the other side. (Someone bet he couldn't do it. Well, he did!)\n\nMr. Adam Billman from the General Store is someone he knew well. He would often play checkers with him, Bob never won because Billman always cheated. He recalls Mr. Billman as being a great horticulturist. For about 4 years he had an apple tree peach tree in the back yard of the store.\n\nMr. Hunt was also everyone's friend. Bob and his friends would often visit with him. He remembers Mr. Hunt as telling them at one time Running Water had 10 saloons.\n\nAfter graduating from Running Water School he then attended Springfield High School, then he worked in California. Until going into the service, he served 3 years in the European Theatre, 7 years with the Armored Division. He then married Lorraine Halsey on June 12, 1947. He operated the DeRoos Gargage in Springfield for 26 years, then taught a Springfield College until its closing.\n\nAdelia DeBoer\n\nMy parents were Paytrus and Dora (Bakker) Logterman. When I was 17 years old my folks moved to a farm 1.5 miles north of Running Water (the place that Gerald Tjerdsma now owns), that was in 1927.\n\nAdelia and her dad both worked at the Running Water elevator, she was the bookkeeper and also helped in loading of the box cars. One day a belt came off of the motor located under the floor, and she was scared to death, because of the badger holes and what ever else may be down there. This was the elevator that was next to the round house.\n\nOne of Adelia's best friends was Lottie Durphy, they would often run on top of the box cars. Lottie's parents lived in Running Water.\n\nI can also remember helping to get ice out of the river, and putting it in Bollingers ice house, then we shared it.\n\nWhen Adelia and Jake DeBoer got married on March 12, 1931, they had their wedding reception in the Running Water hall. They had a two man band, she thinks one of their names was Case Konall.\n\nShe also played the organ at the Congregational Church for Mrs. Anson Young's funeral in Decmeber of 1930.\n\nEd & Ardith Davis\n\nEd and Ardith Davis - In 1983 we purchased Lot 18, Block 12, where the dance hall was located, and then in 1984 we purchased Lot 17. We discovered the smaller trailer tucked away in some trees and weeds when we were up at Running Water helping some friends moved into their house.\n\nAfter we found out who owned the property with the small gray trailer on it. We purchased that lot (18) and trailer, cleared the land and fixed the trailer up and used it to stay in. IN 1986 we purchased a larger trailer house and placedin on Lot 17.\n\nWe have two sons and five grandchildren (so far).\n\nEd's in the restaurant supply business and Ardith is a secretary.\n\nCarvel & Inez Cooley\n\nJ. P. Cooley purchased the land where our house is in 1893 from George Snow. W. R. Cooley took over the ranch in the spring of 1912. He retired in February 1958, moved to Yankton and died July 23, 1973.\n\nCarvel Cooley has lived on the ranch all of his life. He became acquainted with Inez Knutson in Vermillion and they were married in 1946. God gave them two healthy sons and this perfect place to raise them.\n\nIn all our travels we have never found more beautiful scenery then our chalk rock bluffs and Nebraska hills - a beautiful yellow cottonwood tree in autumn or a viberant red sunset, and of course, the rainbows after a shower.\n\nOur sons, David and Jim are now grown and married, living far away, but we know their hearts are still here with us. We treasure their \"home visits.\"\n\nOtis & Ada Cogdill\n\nOtis & Ada Cogdill ~ 1988\n\nWe moved to Running Water the fall of 1970. We had operated the \"Sally Ann\" ferry boat, when Otis decided to retire. We bought a house from Dave Einrem.\n\nWe have 5 children, 4 daughters, 1 son, 15 grandchildren, 7 great grandchildren.\n\nThere were just a few families living here when we came. Running Water has grown. We enjoy living along the banks of the Missouri River with its beauty, peace and quiet.\n\nLewis Billman\n\nLewis Billman's parents were Mr. and Mrs. Adam Billman, who owned and operated the General Store in Running Water, South Dakota. They bought the store from Charles Dunn in 1914.\n\nLewis was appointed post master in Running Water in 1934. He sold the store and contents in August of 1939 to a Mr. Smith of Tyndall, who was his mail carrier.\n\nLewis and his wife reside in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n\nFrances Billick\n\nFrances was born January 18, 1905 to Dorr and Annie Billick. Frances had 2 sisters and a brother, the brother and one of the sisters are buried in Yankton, South Dakota, the other sister died when she was a little girl in 1918 while they were living in Colorado.\n\nWhen Frances lived in Running Water with his parents, they lived in the west end of Main Street, on the south side in a big two story house. The living room floor was of black walnut, salvaged from a wrecked steam boat on the Missouri River.\n\nFrances died October 1, 1986, in Escondido, California, his wife, June, still resides there.\n\nAlys Beltman\n\nWilliam & Alys Beltman ~ 1972\n\nMy parents were Ulbe and Mieke Eringa. There were six children in our family: Grace, Dora, Jessie, Pierre, Thyrza and Alys. I was born in 1909 and lived 1.5 miles north of the ferry boat landing with my parents until 1926 when I moved to Iowa. All of us attended the Running Water School.\n\nI remember many people and happenings in the town of Running Water. The first home on the west end of teh town was Hannah and Bill Malone. Neither one ever married, Bill was a good carpenter. If I rode my horse to school on cold days I would keep him in Bills barn. Margaret Malone was their niece, she stayed with them during teh week to go to school, she went home to her parents farm on the weekends. She and I were the same age, often at noon after I had eaten my cold lunch I would go to get Margaret and Hannah would always have a dish of jello with whipped cream for me. What a treat!\n\nThe Jess Bradbury family lived on the south side of the street, they had two daughters: Alice and Carol. The Brays had two sons: Howard and John. In 1900 these boys were in their upper teens. Mr. Bray was a depot agent.\n\nAdam Foster was the baggage man on the passenger train. They say Mrs. Foster danced at the town hall until midnight and that following morning gave birth to twins.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Bert Walker were the next house and they had four daughters: Alice, Ruth, and twins, Ruth and Helen. Mrs. Walker was the daughter of Hans Johnson.\n\nNext was John and Ella Fitch. Their children were: Lester, Sylvia and Robert. Before them the Billick family lived there. Mr. Billick was also a good carpenter. Both families that lived there were captains of the ferry boat.\n\nNext place was the Brooks Hotel, later the Sabins owned it and about 1916 in burned down. In later years John Terpstra moved the old school house onto the hotel lots and remodeled the school into a home and rented it out to railroad families. I can't recall their names, but one had a niece living with them by the name of Lillian Coombs. She attended Tyndall High School when LIllian Hunt, John Judd and I did, they took the train back and forth each day, but I boarded in Tyndall and came home only on weekends. The train fare was 66 cents.\n\nNext was the post office run by Mr. and Mrs. Anson Young and their son, Ray. They had an invalid daughter named Allie. Ray had a horse named Harry that pulled a cart with barrells so Ray could deliver river water. The Youngs also had a cow or two and they supplied milk for many families.\n\nThe next home was Mr. and Mrs. Hans Johnson, he was the keeper of the round house. He made sure the train engine was in good running order. Mrs. Johnson always had a beautiful flower garden. They were the parents of Mrs. B. Walker, Mrs. Annie Gowling, Sue Porter and John Johnson.\n\nThe next place set on a higher level. The depot and train track were just below Mr. and Mrs. Ira Cottrell lived here, she was one of our good customers when we had apples to sell.\n\nThen there was a little shack where in my early years a Mr. and Mrs. Jake Messmore lived, she came from the deep south and she smoked a pipe, so we children were scared of her.\n\nThen on the next house it was built into the hill with the top story level with the ground and the south lower level was also on ground level. Mr. and Mrs. Kramer and son, Stanley, lived there. Stanley had a job in the County Court House. Kramers were the parents of Mrs. Zelenka. This was the last house on the southeast end of town.\n\nOn the Northwest end was a newer house the first family that I can recall was Werman, then later Mr. and Mrs. Crews, these were all railroad people. Later the Guslafsons, they had a set of twins. Mrs. Guslafson's sister was Lillian Kunz, she taught the Running Water school. She later married Gerrit Dykstra.\n\nNext house was John and Marie Johnson.\n\nNext house was the Captain Leach home, in the earlier years. Later a family by the name of Hills lived there, some of their children's names were Ward, Lois and twins Ona and Olis. There werwe two other children, but I cannot recall their names.\n\nNext was the General Merchandise Store run by Frank Brooks and later by Charles Sunn and his wife, Mandy. After that a Mr. Hornstra bought it and his sister and brother worked with him. Then Mr. and Mrs. Adam Billman from Milwaukee bought it and operated it for a long time. They lived above the store, she had it nicely furnished. In the summer of 1912, my sister, Dora and I took care of the store while Mr. and Mrs. Billman went on a two week vacation and we lived in their home. They had a son, Lewis.\n\nNext was the town hall, where all public meetings were held. Our school had its programs there. We also had Basket Socials there. Voting was there and lots of public dances because of teh beautiful dance floor.\n\nFarther east was Mrs. Bollenger's home, her daughter, Mildred Burns, and her little son lived there. Mrs. Bollenger was a sister of Mike and Pat McGoldereck, who ran the ferry boat in Springfield, I think in the summer of 1921 or 1922. Pat was murdered by an Indian.\n\nNow on the next street north on the west was the Durfey family, their children went to school with me. They were Elmer, Edith, Clarence and Lottie. They had a team of horses, some pigs and chickens.\n\nNext to them was the Catholic Church and just east of it across the road south was the school house. We had a large playground, but no play equipment.\n\nNext to the Catholic Church was the Congregational Church. When the post office burned down in 1916 the Young family moved into the church and Mr. Young operated the post office from there. An offering was taken in the community to help the Youngs build a new home where the old post office had been.\n\nNext was the Congregational Church Parsonage, since no minister occupied it after the Rev. Priestly family. It was rented out to different families. Mr. and Mrs. Hurlbut and two daughters lived there for awhile. He was a conductor on the train. Later a family lived there and the wife was an invalid, her husband had to carry her up the steps to bed. They had a house keeper by the name of Kate White. Their daughter went to school and her name was Evelyn, I think.\n\nNext house was where Grandma and Grandpa Hunt lived.\n\nNext house was where Mrs. Leona Anderson lived with her three children: Annie, Levi and Mae. She was a sister to John Fitch who ran the ferry . Joe Long whose wife was in a mental institution boarded from her.\n\nFrom there on the town stopped growing. The first school house was north of Mrs. Anderson and on the Joe Zelenka land. Mr. and Mrs. Joe Zelenka lived on a farm east of the school, their children were: Frank, Elsie, Helen and Vern.\n\nThere were a few families who lived along the tracks by the depot, they were Mr. and Mrs. Walter Judd. John and Charles lived in a box car converted into a cozy home. The Coynes also lived down there and another family by the name of Pompey, their children Frances and Mildred went to school with me.\n\nSome of the other children that attended school when I did were Walt and Daisy Warrington and the boys of Nick DeVries, they were Tony, Abe and Clarence. Others who lived towards the Cooley Ranch were Sanford and Henry Sell, children of B. Sell, also children of Nick Van Asperen and two boys by the name of Marion and Blaine Covington who lived on the Cooley Ranch where the Jacobs later lived.\n\nI forgot to mention the Wayne Hunt family who lived in the Captain Leach home. AFter the Hills moved out, Mr. and Mrs. Hunt kept rooms. \"Baldy\" Falling Ramp had room and board there he was the engineer on the train he stayed with them for several years. Pearl Noble (later Mrs. Jim Hubregtse) roomed there while she taught school, she was my eighth grade teacher. The Hunt's parents lived east of teh Congregational Parsonage.\n\nI have many memories of my life in Running Water and I was happy to share them with others. My husband, William and I live in Alton, Iowa. We have three sons Norman, Brian and Dennis.\n\nby Alys Eringa Beltman\n\nAndrew & Leona Anderson\n\nWhen Andrew Anderson passed away, Leona (Fitch) Anderson and her three children moved to Running Water in 1912. Their children are Levi, Ann and Mae.\n\nAugust & Nellie Hennies\n\nAs I sit in my warm kitchen and listen to the weather report it sounds like this winter will be very cold. January came in below zero and now the month is half gone and not many hours have been above zero, this means I will be in teh house an dI will jot down things that I remember and have heard from my parents and relatives, maybe it will be interesting for my family and generations to come. I am seventy-years of age so please excuse the grammar and punctuations. In 1989, seven years have passed and I am now 82 and as Mary Lou (Einrem) Livingston is compiling a book on Running Water, I will add other happenings I have been thinking of.\n\nRunning Water was an interesting little town by the Missouri River where the ferry boat would cross to Niobrara, Nebraska. My father, August Hennies, helped build many of the buildings there, the post office, the school, a church, these I remember him talking of. He was on the election board for many years. The hill going north from the town seemed long and steep when we were young and we worried that the car wouldn't get to the top. We lived to cross the river to Niobrara. In the winter several men would haul ice that they cut from the river. We had an ice house and in the summer the ice was good to make ice cream and to keep the ice box cold. My father August Hennies was born in 1869 in Kemma Germany and at th age of 17 he had to decide between Compulsory Military or go to America. He and a cousin decided to go to America and make a life of their own. They had very little money, but had communicated with Americans on the Keegan Ranch doing carpenter work and ranch work. He saved his money and homesteaded on an 80 acre just east of the Keegan Ranch. My mother came with her parents were John and Winifred Gertrude Weimstra Hornstra, she was born Nellie Hornstra in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, 1871. Later they moved to Bon Homme County in South Dakota, where they lived on the farm that is still the Hornstra Farm. Mrs. Fred Hornstra (Ruby) lives there.\n\nMy mother's father was married four times, his first family was Cornelius, Freddi, Peter and Egbert born in Holland. His second family was Rachel and Flora. His third wife had no children. His fourth family was Garrett, Hudson, Nellie (my mother) and John. In 1891 my mother and father were married. They lived on the small farm where my father built a small house. He farmed and did carpenter work. Mostly in Running Water, seven miles away. He walked those seven miles when he could do carpenter work. My mother had two little boys, Albert and William (Dutch) and she was afraid to go in the house before my father came home, she and the boys would sit on a bench till they saw my dad walking home. Albert was born in 1893. William (Dutch) in 1896, Arthur in 1903, I was born in 1906, Winefred in 1909, and Helen Florence in 1915, she died in 1917 of dyptheria. We all grew up on the farm. My father made the house bigger as the family got bigger. Working conditions were not easy. My mother had to carry water from the well which was nearly 1/8 miles east of the house. Later a well was drilled closer to the buildings by Dirk Dykstra and it was a soft tubular well, 440 feet thru the sand rock, that must have been around 1915, about the time my father bought his first car, a Ford that had to be cranked. He broke his wrist shortly after we had it when the crank recoiled.\n\nWorld War I was in 1917 and my brother Albert and Dutch went in the service. Albert joined the army and was in office training first at Camp Dodge and then Camp Fuonston in Kansas. Dutch joined the navy and was in Great Lakes training in Chicago. In 1918 the war ended and they came home. My dad had a hard time keeping the work done on the fram, but he managed to get help. Art was 14 and too young to go to war. He and a neighbor boy would pal around and they wanted to be beig so they started smoking. One evening when he was getting the cows home to milk he stopped behind the straw stack and the match lit the straw and it burned to the ground. When the boys came home from the war my dad had Albert and Dutch's friends to help build a big bar, they made beds in teh corn crib. At night they would go to dances. One night they went to Springfield, one tire came off and rolled ahead of the car.\n\nMy sister Winnie and I would help my mother cook. The threshers had their bunk house, but we had to cook their meals. We baked cakes for their coffee times. When the barn was finished we had a big barn dance. My sister was 10 or 11 and I was 12 or 13, that's when we started dancing. We served sandwiches, cake and cookies on the lawn. What a crwwod! My brother Albert played the drums with the Hornstra Brothers Orchestra, Ernie Hornstra played violin, Edgar played clarinet, George played the harp and they also had a piano player. They played for many barn dances and also in the Perkins Hall. Many memories of the days in the 20's and everyone remembers the 30's when it was so dry and the dust was so bad you had to drive with the lights on. Then came the 40's and in 1941 my last child was born and my folks celebrated their 50th in the Congregational Church in Springfield. In 1949 my father was 80 and my mother was 77. They left the farm to retire in California. They lived there for 16 years. My dad passed away in 1962 at age 93, my mother passed away in 1964 at age 92. I reside in Yankton.\n\nby Pearl (Hennies) Balfany\n\nJanet Abraham\n\nMy parents were Paytrus and Dora Bakker/Logterman. I was one of six children - Adelia, Henrietta, Alice, Janet, Thelma, and Calvin. The four youngest went to school in Running Water. Miss Magret Malone was one of our teachers, she taught for several years. Her parents lived one mile north of our farm, we lived about 1.5 miles north of Running Water.\n\nI remember the Billman Store as being huge! Billmans lived above the store, he also had a gasoline pump for selling gas to customers. The post office was across the street and a little to the east. It was run by Ray Young, he lived with his mother and sister in the back of the building. There was a large dance hall near the school, my two older sisters held their wedding receptions there.\n\nBetween the dance hall and the school was an open lot and Mr. Billman had a garden there, he would plant some sunflowers, and one day the 8th grade boys jumpbed the fence and took a large head. We older girls joined them, we all ate teh sunflower seeds. Mr. Billman complained to the teacher, and we were all punished by staying in at all recesses for the rest of the week (thank goodness it was near the end of the school year). You can rest assure we didn't do that anymore.\n\nThe DeRoo's Fitches, Louis Billman, Irma and Bob Gowling and all of us enjoyed many fun times together, such as a picnic out on the sand bar or a moonlit night sledding down the long hill, leading into Running Water. Many times in the winter all would gather around the Old Stove in Mr. Fitch's shed near the ferry singing songs.\n\nMy dad and a group of townsmen would cut ice for our ice boxes. Dad dug a big hole in the ground, packed the ice in straw and built a cover over the ice pit, so we would have ice for a long time. A big home made batch of ice cream was really a treat.\n\nIn the summer we would go wading and swimming in the old, muddy Missouri, and to our surprise come winter it was hard to believe the ice could be so clear.\n\nby Janet Logterman/Abraham\n\nJim & Darlene Egli\n\nDarlene and I, along with our daughter Carolyn and her husband Tom Moore bought the property in Running Water in 1977. We built the new cabin in 1978 and sold it to Harlen and Carol Ferwerda in 1987. We had some great times there along with some very sad times with the sudden death of our son-in-law, Tom, in 1980.\n\nThe river home was a place to relax and enjoy the beauty of the outdoors. Carolyn and Tom lived in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Darlene and I lived in Des Moines, Iowa. We would meet at the river home almost every weekend from April to November. After I retired, Darlene and I lived there two summers. We would work, fish, hunt, and just relax and enjoy ourselves. We spent many happy days with Carolyn and her girls, Nikki and Kathi. Our granddaughters also enjoyed boating and fishing and riding in the trailer that I built to pull behind my snapper lawn mower.\n\nThe fall of the years was such a special time of the year because of the golden colors of the cottonwoods, and the ducks, gulls, and pelicans flying over the river.\n\nWe reside in Texas now and Carolyn and the girls live in Sioux Falls.\n\nCarl & Grace Einrem\n\nWe moved to Running Water March 1, 1947. We bought the John McPeek residence. Our new neighbors to the west of John Terpstra, Mamie Walker, her daughter, Helen, and her son, David. Harold and Ann Kibble lived on the far west end. Across the road from us was Mildred Burns, this was only a summer home for her. East of us was Joe and Katie Zelenka, beyond them was William (Slim) and Mary Jacobs, north of them was Mrs. John Crane, and her son Ray, and Elmer Zelenka. For a short time Vern and Viola Zelenka lived in the small house behind Mildred Burns.\n\nThese neighbors became very dear to me. It was so nice to have close neighbors as most winters were cold and blizzards closed roads for days at a time. One could always walk to a neighbors for a cup of coffee or a game of cards to pass the time. I also became active in the Congregational Church Ladies Aid, (at Running Water). They had services there a few times after we moved there, but it was mainly used for social gatherings and Summer Bible School until it closed for good.\n\nMarcleen, Charles, and Mary Lou attended the Running Water School, our oldest daughter Joyce was in high school in Springfield and she was living there.\n\nCarl was a hired man for several farmers. He also did some farming of his own land, along with all that he was a commercial fisherman. In later years he worked at the Kingsburg Elevator and the Springfield Elevator.\n\nI was a busy housewife with a big garden for canning and selling. In later years I went to work for the Southern State College as a cook, then I worked at the Merit Jane Rest Home in Springfield. I also went into homes and helped the sick and disabled.\n\nCarl and I moved into Springfield in 1976. Carl passed away on October 25, 1977. I moved into the Marion Creek apartment in Yankton in 1981, and this is where I still reside.\n\nI have many good memories of Running Water that will never be forgotten. My father was a well driller and I remember him drilling a well for several people living in Running Water, one was my uncle John Fitch, Joe Zelenka, (when they lived on their farm to the north of us) and William (Slim) Jacobs. He drilled many wells in his working years, but I do remember the ones in Running Water. My mother and my uncle, John Fitch, were brother and sister. Uncle John ran the ferry service here for many years.\n\nBefore Carl and I married I use to come here to dances, (in the big dance hall). We also shopped at the Billman General Store, and often visited with the Youngs, who ran the Post Office. My mother's oldest sister, Aunt Leona (Fitch) Anderson, also lived here and my folks would often come here to visit. I can also remember visiting with Grandpa and Grandma Hunt who lived in the little house to the west of Aunt Leona. They were such dear people to everyone.\n\nCarl, Joe, and Dave would cut ice along the Missouri River and would sell it for 6 cents a cake. Some of the farmers refused to pay that much, they said it was too expensive. While cutting the ice one day Carl fell through the ice, his brothers were able to get him before the current took him under.\n\nI can't remember whose house it was that my dad moved out here, but Mr. Johnny Blayer bought it and they moved it on his land near Chateau Creek. My uncle, John Fitch's, house was moved to Niobrara, Nebraska and the others I don't know, but these two dad moved.\n\nPeter David Einrem\n\nPeter was one of eight children born to Einer and Johanna (Erickson) Einrem on February 12, 1894. He and his brother, Joe, farmed the parental homestead. He also was employed as a salesman for the Watkins Co. for several Years. He bought the John Terpstra home in Running Water in the early sixties. In about 1967 or 1968 he went to Merit Jane Nursing Home in Springfield, later to the Tyndall Good Samaritan Center. He died July 31, 1971.\n\nHe was a collector of antiques and was especially interested in Indian Artifacts. He found most of the arrowheads by walking in the Norwegian Hill Area.\n\nUlbe & Maaike Eringa\n\nUlbe and Meike Eringa came from the Netherlands in the early 1890's. They settled in the Running Water area. They had six children: Grace, Dora, Jessie, Pierre, Thyrza, and Alys. The children attended the Running Water School.\n\nPierre & Lillian Eringa\n\nPierre was born July 11, 1902, to Ulbe and Meike Eringa at the home farm near Running Water, South Dakota. He attended the Running Water School He married Lillian Walking September 4, 1924. They resided on the home farm and took over the farming for his father. They lived on the farm until 1969. Herb DeJong rented the farm until Pierre's death.\n\nPierre and Lillian had 2 children, Urwin and Anita. The children attended the Running Water School, Urwin for 8 years and Anita for 1 1/2 years. Anita finished her schooling at the Donnely School. In 1963 their daughter, Anita and her husband Robert Tjeerdsma moved onto the home place and started farming. The year of 1968 a new farm home was built by Alfred Stockholm.\n\nHarlan & Carol Ferwerda\n\nHarlan and Carol Ferwerda purchased their Running Water home in August of 1987 from Jim and Darlene Egli and Carolyn Moore.\n\nCarol's mother, Mrs. Jennie Odens, was born in Running Water. Jennie is the daughter of the Late Frank and Lena DeRoos. The DeRoos has 13 children. The DeRoos lived in Running Water for several years. All of their thirteen children spent some of their childhood years in Running Water.\n\nI was only 4 years old when my Grandpa DeRoos passed away and then my Grandma sold their home in Running Water and moved to Springfield, but I have some precious memories of all my family getting so excited about going to visit Grandpa and Grandma's house in Running Water, as did all the other DeRoos grandchildren (there were many of us!). I guess that's what drew me back to Running Water and to want to buy some property there. It's just a little extra special to me and my mom and family feel the same way.\n\nHarlan, Carol and 16 year old daughter, Terri, enjoy Running Water every chance they get as do their other children, sons, John and Cindy Jochims of Brandon, Dennis and Darla Jochims and son Jason Stohlecker of Springfield, Richard and Lynda Jochims, Rosanna and Krystal of Valley Springs, South Dakota, daughter Barbra and Loren Gregerson and Justin and Jessica Gregerson of Chamberlain.\n\nHarlan, Carol, and Terri recently moved from Springfield to Yankton where Harlan is employed as a manager with Alumax Extrusions, Inc. Carol has started her own cleaning business and Terri is a 10th grader in Yankton Senior High School.\n\nJohn & Ella Fitch\n\nJohn B. and Ella (Hartman) Fitch and their family lived in Running Water. Their children were Lester, Sylvia, and Robert.\n\nJohn operated the Ferry Service across the Missouri River for 25 years. He had a succession of 3 ferris: The \"Little Pearl,\" \"Falls City,\" and the \"L.S. Robert\". He offered ferry service from 1915 to 1940.\n\nLester Fitch\n\nJohn B. and Ella (Hartman) Fitch and their family lived in Running Water during the late teens through the thirties. Their children were Lester, Sylvia and Robert. Those days as a growing boy were a lot different than 60 years later.\n\nI think Running Water had a population of around one hundred. I don't believe it was ever incorporated. We had an elementary rural school of eight grades, which all three of us children attended. Robert was the only one of us that was born in Running Water.\n\nThe population was made up mostly of railroad employed people. It was the end of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Rail Road Line, that ran to Marion, South Dakota. There was passenger service daily that left Running Water each morning, except Sunday, and returned in the evening. The train was made up of a steam engine locomotive, a mail car, an express baggage car and three or four passenger cars. Then, as I remember, the freight train leaving Running Water would go to Marion one day and return the next day. This was the main transportation moving people, livestock, grain, and mail and other freight merchandise. A lot of this business came from Nebraska.\n\nThe railroad company maintained a good depot, round house, coal shed and water tank. This is where the steam locomotives were taken care of each night. The engine would be put on the turn table and turned around. This was done by hand. Then backed into the round house where it was checked and serviced. It would take on a supply of coal and water for the next days trip.\n\nThere was a grain elevator and stock yards at the foot of the hill, on the river bank. The elevator burned down and the stock yards were torn down as the river eroded away the land. There was a great tract of land that is all eroded away now.\n\nMy dad owned and operated the Ferry service across the Missouri River to Niobrara on the Nebraska side. He also had the mail contract between the Running Water Post Office and the Niobrara Post Office in connection with his ferry service. He operated a bus service for passengers between the railroads, also. The Northwestern Rail Road was from Norfolk, Nebraska to Winner, South Dakota. Students would come down on the Winner Line to go to school at Springfield.\n\nDuring the twenty-five years that my dad operated the ferry he had three ferry boats, first the \"Little Pearl\" then the \"Falls City\" and the \"L.S. Robert\". This one he had built at Running Water and named it after his three children. He had a carpenter who lived in Running Water named Bill Malone, (he and a sister lived together and I think the house is still there). They had to use steam to bend some of the planks to form the front bow of the boat, etc., to keep them from breaking when bending. It was 65 feet in length and approximately 30 feet wide on the deck. It was powered with a single cylinder gas engine, with two fly wheels that measured five feet or better in diameter. A heavy 12 inch belt conveyed the power from the bow to the stern paddle wheel. The ferries had to be inspected each spring and a licensed operator had to be on board each trip. He operated the \"L.W. Robert\" until the fall of 1940 when it was ruined in the severe blizzard of November 11.\n\nMany exciting experiences happened during those years on the ferry of transporting horses and buggies, old Model T's without any brakes, herds of cattle, circuses, horse trading Gypsies, Hobos, bootleggers, etc. We were very fortunate that we didn't have any bad accidents or tragedies.\n\nThere were lots of times when the engine would stop or the wind would blow the boat onto a sand bar. During the winter the ferry had to be pulled out of the river onto the bank.\n\nWinter time's occupation changed to putting up ice for the next summer. There were no electrical refrigerators during those years, no electricity. Ice was stored in ice houses, packed generally in saw dust. Ice on the Missouri River would get two to three feet thick. It was sawed mostly by hand or horse drawn ice plow, that procedure made uniform size cakes of 18 inches by 36 inches. Ice was hauled by wagon and team from the ice field to the box cars. It was shipped to various towns along the railroad. This operation took from twenty to thirty men, and lasted a ceks. Farmers with teams would earn extra money in the winter by helping. Someone would slip and fall into the cold water at times.\n\nI recall an incident that Elmer Duffy had a two ton model A Ford truck and he went looking for wood one day, driving down the river on the ice. He came upon some thin ice and the truck went through into the river. He got out okay. Later the truck was gotten out some way but I don't remember how.\n\nEntertainment was lots of dances held in the dance hall and in other communities. Occasionally there would be a first fight. There were card parties, picnics, and coasting down hill on a sled in the winter snow was fun.\n\nBillman's Store was the gathering place for local farmers and men around town each evening after supper, to swap tales and discuss events of the day. Saturday night, farmer's night, most everybody would make a trip to Springfield for shopping, business places always stayed open. Mother generally had eggs and some cream to take in to trade for groceries. We always had a cow and a team of horses. My chores were to help take care of them.\n\nI remember when Highway 37 was built down the hill, a lot of dirt was moved with dump wagons pulled with three mules. Some people felt that the mules were very much abused. When the road was completed if you had a car that would make the hill in high gear you had a good car.\n\nAnother memory was that mother cooked some evening meals for people staying over night at the hotel, railroad people, and then the school teacher stayed at our house. We had a player piano and people would sit by the hour and pump it.\n\nI think I started to school in about 1918. Eight years there in Running Water and then drove back and forth to high school in Springfield for four years. I graduated there in 1930. Blanch Buck from Springfield, as I remember, was my first teacher.\n\nI attended school at the normal for one year, taught school for 3 years, spent 4 years in the army and spent about 25 years in the banking business. I am now retired and living in Niobrara, Nebraska. For 50 years or more we have been working to get a bridge built across the Missouri River and I am still working on it.\n\nSylvia Fitch left Running Water in the late thirties and went to California. She married George DeRoos and had one daughter. Sylvia still lives at Pleasant Hill, California. George died in 1988.\n\nRobert Fitch graduated from Niobrara High School. He never married. He was employed at Tom's Music House in Norfolk, Nebraska until his death in 1982.\n\nDeddo Gelling\n\nThe Deddo Gelling family lived in the Running Water vicinity from 1942 until 1947. They lived about 2 miles north of Running Water on the George Genant farm. Deddo and Theressa (Rienstra) Gelling were the parents of 6 daughters. They also cared for Mrs. Gelling's mother, Mrs. Feikje Reinstra, who lived with them. Frieda, the oldest daughter, was already in high school, but the rest of the Gelling girls attended Running Water School. They were Minnie, Tiena, Janette, Annie, and Willma.\n\nDeddo Gelling passed away on July 15, 1959. Mrs. Theressa Gelling now resides in Avon Meadow View Manor at Avon, South Dakota. Frieda (Mrs. Ken Van Deursen) lives in Shelbyville, Illinois; Minnie (Mrs. Clayton Wittmeier) at Avon, South Dakota; Tiena (Mrs. Henry Zondervan) at Raymond, Minnesota; Janette (Mrs. Les VandenBerg) deceased on May 17, 1976; Annie (Mrs. Robert Peterka) at Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Willma (Mrs. Robert Wissink) at Canton, South Dakota.\n\nDeddo & Theressa Gelling Daughters\n\nMemories of Running Water recalled by the Gelling girls were, of course, the school. They remembered that since it was during the war years, they were, as a school project, encouraged to collect and sell old scrap iron. They remembered that one teacher, Mabel Wynia, occasionally used an hour of their school time to take the students out to pound up an old furnace in a vacant building and sell the scrap iron. As an extra reward, the school received a gold colored eagle with little flags attached to it. As individual projects, they were encouraged to collect bones which were gathered from the pastures. The bones were also sold. They also recalled having the opportunity of going into the old Hunt Hotel. One daughter remembered nothing of the interior of the rooms except the large water basins and pitchers in each bedroom, which really fascinated her. Other memories were the pie or basket socials, sometimes held in the school or church there. Also recalled was a chalk rock house or cave, somewhere in teh vicinity west of where the ferry landing was recently located. Also of some of the residents; John Terpstra, who had the skill to make decorative carved cans; Joe Zelenkas; John McPeeks, etc. They have regrets of not recording more of the events that took place during the years they lived there.\n\nGeorge & Annetta Genant\n\nThe Larney Malone farm located one and one half miles north of Running Water consisted of 275 acres plus about 80 more on river bottom extending south from the ferry landing. On this land stood the round house where the train engine was turned around and also a small stockyards where cattle and hogs were loaded on train cars. In later years, this land all washed away by the river.\n\nLarney Malone had a wife and two children, Harold and Margaret. Two unmarried brothers and a sister lived in a one story house on the west edge of Running Water which is still standing. Two of them taught school and the brothers also did carpenter work.\n\nThe Malones, Martins, Donnellys, and Foleys to the north were all of Irish decent and came to South Dakota from Canada originally.\n\nIn 1912 Larney constructed a new two story house on his farm. It was a precut structure that Sears and Roebuck sold. He raised hogs and cattle.\n\nMost of the farmers in the area would get their mail in the Running Water Post Office, often in the evening, where they would visit in the store. Sometimes when politics were discussed, there were some heated arguments. One evening in the mid-thirties, he came from from Running Water, walked into his house and dropped dead on the kitchen floor.\n\nThey had a mortgage on the farm with the Federal Land Bank which was greater than the farm was worht, so the Land Bank took possession. His son Harold continued to farm the land and also operated a restaurant in Springfield which is part of Springfield Hardware now. In the meantime Harold's sister Margaret died of cancer and his uncles had moved from Running Water to Murdo, where they had a large wheat farm.\n\nIn the spring of 1941 George Genant from Orange City, Iowa was visiting relatives at Springfield and was told land was selling for $20 per acre. Therefore, he contacted the Federal Land Bank at Yankton. They still had the Malone farm and George bought it for $6000. The farm yard consisted of one lone tree, the house, a large barn, corn crib, garage and chicken coop, also a well with a windmill on it. The terms of sale were $1000 down with the balance to be paid in thirty-three years. The interest was 4% and taxes $95 per year. He bought the place with immediate possession and became Harold's landlord. The land was then planted to barley and corn. George had a job in Iowa and did not plan to farm immediately. In the later part of November 1941, he received a phone call from Harold Malone who said, \"If you want your share of the corn, you will have to pick my share too! I'll pay you 10 cents a bushel, supply a team and wagon, also board and room.\"\n\nSo, George, the landlord, headed for South Dakota the next day to pick his tenant's corn by hand which was flat on the ground with lots of sandburrs and cockleburrs. There was no elevator and the corn had to be scooped into the crib by hand. The crop was not very good and it wasn't possible to pick more than thirty bushels daily.\n\nThen one day, a man, his wife, and six girls came to the field where George was hand picking and said would like to rent the farm. His name was Deddo Gelling. George wanted someone to live on the place so rented it to him. He could apply for a loan from the government on the condition that he farm with horses, not a tractor. They lived on that farm until the spring of 1948 when they moved to another farm near Kingsburg. Finally they purchased their own farm southwest of Springfield.\n\nIn June of 1947, George was married at Orange City, Iowa and moved in march of 1948 to the former Malone farm.\n\nA very interesting family were the Homers living in the hills one quarter mile west of Running Water. They occupied a large two story house. The children were quite musically talented and they had a piano. In 1948 they sold their farm and purchased another at Bell Fourche. Anyway, the first week in March the neighbors came to have a farewell party at the Homer place. George Genant was batching a few months because his wife had to finish teaching in Iowa, so the neighbors asked George to come along to the party. Driving through the winding hills was a beautiful experience that night. One could see the lights of farm houses and the town of Niobrara across the river. The Homers were in the process of loading some possessions on one of Fred Dawe's trucks. A good time was had by all visiting and reminiscing. The brought-in lunch was served and enjoyed. Mrs. Homer stated that they didn't know what to do with the piano as there wasn't room for it on the truck. It was a smaller size in mahogany in pretty good shape. They used it for many parties and dances in their home. So for $50 George Genant purchased the piano and over forty years later, the instrument is still being used almost daily by the Genants in their new home in Springfield. It has been tuned only once by John Matuska of Yankton who also put on new ivories for $50.\n\nThe land now owned by George Genant including the Malone farm has seven different places where at one time stood buildings or houses. Most of these places were small and usually the father of these families worked in Running Water or on the railroad.\n\nJohn Terpstra came from Holland in the early 1880's. His parents were poor and his father worked for Ryne Talsma. That first summer he became overheated and died. John's mother later remarried and lived two miles north and one half miles east of Running Water. This 80 acre hilly farm later came into John's possession. Being unmarried, he advertised for a wife and one came from North Carolina. They adopted a girl whose name was Pearl. Later she married an older man, a Mr. Young, the postmaster of Running Water and took off for the West Coast.\n\nGeorge became acquainted with John in 1943. He had retired in Running Water. When a new school was built, John purchased the old one and used the lumber to build his house which is still being used today, the one Otis Cogdill's bought and lived in at first. John had a fondness for the river and Running Water itself. In the early 1950's George would visit John and listen to his stories of pioneer days. the Running Water road (hill) to the north used to be much steeper. To bring loads of grain with horses and wagons took a great deal of skill. Occasionally there were mishaps and injuries.\n\nOne of John's stories concerned a seventeen year old boy who lived with his parents in the east end of town. He had younger brothers and sisters. The father worked for the railroad and part-time in one of the four elevators. In those days, when one could read and write, it was considered to be enough education. A seventeen year old was considered a man and was needed to help the family. The particular boy did odd jobs in the Running Water ares. He got acquainted with some horse traders who took him along across the river to the southeast in Nebraska to steal one or two horses. There was a good market for horses in Charles Mix and Douglas Counties. Anyway, they stole a horse in Nebraska and the two horse traders and the boy were caught by a group of vigilantes before they could cross the river. Now, justice, if you could call it that, was quick in those days. Horse thieves, if caught, were hung, unless the sheriff caught them first, then there was a trial. As the rope was placed around the neck of that seventeen year old boy, he begged to be shot, not hung like a dog, as he put it. He is probably buried on the side of the hill north of Running Water.\n\nIn 1895 the body of a Mr. Scott, the treasurer of Holt County, Nebraska, was discovered under a bridge south of Spencer, Nebraska. Scott had taken county money, was caught by vigilantes, and hung there. The rope was still around his neck.\n\nJohn Terpstra was a skilled craftsman and carved wood like chains. He whittled cats and dogs from pieces of wood. He also chiseled stone. George has a piece of limestone on which John chiseled 1900, the year he built a barn. In stature, he was a tall slender man. His wife was a big woman. They are both buried in the Springfield Cemetery.\n\nGeorge & Anna Gowling\n\nGeorge and Vivian, Bob and Hazel Gowling, and their sister Erma (Gowling) Johnson, came to Running Water on Sunday, August 31, 1986, to see, and reminisce about their early childhood days. They stopped by our home and shared many of their memories with Ray and I. Nothing looked like it did back in the 20's. But, the memories never changed. They had happy memories of friends and relatives, who also lived there at that time.\n\nTheir parents were George and Anna (Johnson) Gowling, their grandparents were Hans and Antonie Johnson.\n\nGeorge sketched a map of what Running Water was like when they lived here, so I would like to share that with you.\n\nGeorge and Vivian live in Minnesota. Bob and Hazel live in New Jersey. Irma lives in South Dakota.\n\nby Mary Lou Livingston\n\nPaul & Sally Hendrickson\n\nWe moved to Running Water in 1971, where we operated the \"Sally Ann\" ferry. We purchased 3 lots in the River side of the road, from where we could see both the South Dakota and Nebraska crossing flags.\n\nOur children Paula age 10, Troy age 12 and Guy are 13 also helped with the business. All learning to load and unload vehicles, as well as tieing u pth eterry. Our sons became quite good at operating it as well. It was a great experience for us all to be working together.\n\nAfter 3 years Paul decided to go back to his former employment as a captain on the barge lines and the ferry was sold. Since he flew back and forth to work we were able to continue living in Running Water.\n\nIt's a beautiful place to live. There was very few people there and we were able to have horses, dogs and et. after purchasing more property. Little by little the town is again growing, mostly with weekenders and summer people.\n\nWe found Running Water to be a good place to raise our children. It's beautiful year round. Always something to do. Boating, swimming and skiing in the clear and clean Missouri River. Good places to hunt, hike and bike. Also winter sledding and ice skating. I am really thankful for the country and the great people.\n\nRichard Hermanek\n\nI purchased part of lot 4 (west part of Running Water) from Joe Holy on March 15, 1963.\n\nAlso purchased all of Block 8 from Ralph and Nancy Mord on November 11, 1968 for proposed homesite. I did not build until approximately 10 years later when a basement \"A\" frame cottage was constructed by myself.\n\nI work road construction most of the year throughout South Dakota.\n\nThe main reason I lived here is for the recreation provided by the Missouri River and the easy access to it at Running Water.\n\nIn 1961 when I first came to Running Water, a Mr. Roy Blacknik was a commercial fisherman here and lived alone near the ferry landing. John Gretchman ran the Missouri River Ferry and lived just north of the ferry landing. At the base of Spuce Street (south of Block 30) lived Helder Thompson. David Einrem (the Walkins man) and Carl Einrem (Mayor of Running Water) lived at the far east end and Mac McCollum in a small house (the remains are still standing).\n\nJoseph & Elsie (Bartikowsky) Holy\n\nJoe was born in October of 1906 and Elsie was born in October 1912. They have a son, Jim, and a daughter, Mae.\n\nThey purchased land at Running Water from Nick Wynia. They then purchased the Donnelly School and moved it onto their land and made it into a cabin. They enjoy gardening and their orchard along with fishing with their son and grandchildren. Their son, Jim and Sharon's children are Karla, Karen, and Joe. Their daughter, Mae's children are Pamala and Marie.\n\nBen & Iva (Sell) Homer\n\nWilliam & Ellen Homer ~ 1925\n\nThey lived west of Running Water in the hills, in the former home of his parents, William and Ellen, Ben's father built the house, his brothers, Frank, Otto, Boyd, Charlie, and sisters, Edna and Ellen, all lived there. Ben married Iva Sell and lived there with their family until 1947 when they then moved to the western part of South Dakota.\n\nBen was born in 1889, Iva in 1896.

Iva passed away in 1979, also Dorthy and her husband Gordon, their daughter Elizabeth, Wayne's son Kenneth and Don's daughter, Debra. The grandparents, William and Ellen are buried in Springfield Cemetery and Ben and Iva are buried in Belle Fourche, South Dakota.\n\nBen and Iva were well known as well as Ben's brothers for their musical talents. They played for many house dances. Several of their children attended the Running Water School. Their son Bill worked on the ferry boat for John Fitch.\n\nLottie (Durfey) Hoyer\n\nCharles and Thresa Osburn/Durfey moved to Running Water with their family in 1914. Their home was located 1 block north of the Billman General Store. My father was a dray man hauling freight. He passed away in April of 1921. Mother lived there and raised us children, in May of 1940 she passed away.\n\nEllen Durfey Farris, married Stone Farris and they also lived there after they married until 1931. Stone worked on the section and also worked at the round house. Ellen passed away in McMinnville, Oregon in 1985.\n\nElmer Durfey worked on the section and farmed for several years. He married Elaine Johnson, they lived in Avon for a few years. Elmer passed away in November of 1985 at Lynwood, Washington.\n\nEdith Durfey Thomas, taught school near Oldham, South Dakota, she passed away August of 1940.\n\nClarence Durfey worked for farmers, he served in the Army during the second World War. He passed away in 1962.\n\nLottie Durfey Hoyer, my brother and I were in the first grade at the new Running Water School. I married Hans Hoyer in Oldham, South Dakota in 1932. We farmed near Arlington, South Dakota, until Hans' death in 1981. I now live in Arlington, South Dakota. My grandson and his wife live on our home place.\n\nJana (Warrington) Jelsma\n\nI have some fond memories of this little town and so do the rest of the sisters and brothers. We take a tour every year and sometimes more when family comes home. We are all excited and glad to hear that they are being included in the Centennial Year celebration.\n\nIt was a small town but mighty, with common, plain, kind folks ready to help their friends whenever the need occurred. I grew to young womanhood and left the community when I married in 1948. Some of the things that were small then still remain with me as well as the rest of the family.\n\nThe old school house was good sized and in winter so cold that teachers would set desks all around the furnace and our lunch boxes to keep them from freezing in the cloak rooms. Highlight of the school years was the Christmas program, but what made it so special was we held it in the church across the street, where there was a \"stage\" and we pupils thought we were doing things in a big way. I'm sure this was all added work for our teachers and they were glad when it was over. Our Christmas trees were always large and decorated so pretty and the gifts we made at school for our Moms and Dads were wrapped and under it.\n\nSome Sundays we girls would walk to Running Water and cross and ride the ferry all afternoon, enjoying the beauty and the water.\n\nSunday evenings in summer jot down again to attend church services in the evening, where Reverend Warner would commute back and forth.\n\nOur grocery store was another nice little place folks would sit and visit after picking up their mail and a few groceries. You could always buy something with our few pennies.\n\nThe old dance hall stood south of school, my sister and myself were quite young but we'd watch and try to dance, we liked the lunch counter best with those good hamburgers which was an open door concession stand.\n\nIrma (Gowling) Johnson\n\nSome of my memories are the winters, sliding down the hill that led tot the ferry. In the warm evenings the children and adults played \"Run Sheep Run.\" I loved to play the piano that Fitchs had, and watching the men cut ice out of the river and putting it in the ice house packed with straw, also taking my pennies or nickels to the Billman store to buy candy, and going to the post office in the evenings for the mail. I would also walk to Zilenka's farm for some milk and cream.\n\nOne of our teachers was Margaret Malone. Everyone went to the dances and the Box social that were held at the dance hall. I can also remember helping my grandma Johnson with the alter work and taking flowers there. I also attended the services at the Congregational Church.\n\nThese years were in the middle twenties. My parents were George and Ann Johnson Gowling. My grandparents were Hans and Antonie Johnson. I have two brothers, George and Robert.\n\nWillem & Femmigje Jonkers\n\nFemmigje \"Fern\" Jonkers Talsma\n\nThe Willem and Femmigje Jonkers family came to America from Wolvego, the Netherlands in the fall, October of 1904, to Running Water, South Dakota. Their children included: Henry 23, Gerard 19, Lena 17, Koendert (Karl) 15, Isabell 11, Minnie 6, and Elsie 3. The older boys picked corn for area farmers including Hartman and Maarsingh, as I recall.\n\nIn 1905 another daughter, Clara, her husband, Mike Blom, and small son, Jake, joined the family. Mike also was employed by area farmers until they moved to Charles Mix County. they also immigrated from Wolvega (Friesland), the Netherlands.\n\nThe house was so small and with all these people, that during the day they would hang the chairs on nails on the wall to make more room. They also froze to death that first winter with so few provisions.\n\nSubmitted by Mrs. Gertrude Crouse, daughter of Gerard & Agnes Jonkers\n\nCopied from a letter to me by my Aunt Isabel DeVries, Belvidere, South Dakota, in February, 1985.\n\nYes we came in 1904 to Running Water and in March of 1905 we moved to a place by the river south of the Hartman place.\n\nIn September, Shaver came to us to rent their 80 acres as her girls were ready for high school (they just had 2 girls then) but they wanted to moved as they did not want to have the place stand empty. This was nice for us as we had to go to school too. the land lay next to Rein Talsma to the south. Shaver had oats that year so they had that harvested, we had corn on the river we could pick that fall. So from September 1905, we rented the Shaver place.\n\nThen on April 2, 1906, when Willem drowned in the Choteau Creek the Blom's worked for the Hento brothers in Charles Mix County; Henry and Gerard farmed a bigger place north of Avon.\n\nRein Talsma later married our mother Femmigje (Fern) Jonkers.\n\nThe Shavers belonged to the Dutch Church which was about 2 1/2 miles east of Rein's place. This is directly east of the Hornstra school.\n\nWayne Krisl\n\nWayne Krisl from Slaine County, Nebraska, came to work on the Gavins Point Dam after his discharge from the Army in 1952.\n\nIn July of 1955, he met Joyce (Einrem) Lutz. Joyce had graduated from springfield College that spring and began teaching school at Dante, South Dakota, that fall. They married on April 2, 1956. Wayne and Joyce had two children, Bernadine and Larry.\n\nMany happy weekends were spent at the family home of Carl and Grace Einrems, located on the bank of the Missouri River in Running Water.\n\nFishing was an important part of the memories, fishing with Carl was a fun time as well as educational and the stories of his fishing days are ones he will always remember. Grace was always making food that everyone liked, my favorite was the baked duck and sauerkraut, although no matter what she made it was enjoyed by ALL.\n\nI still reside in Yankton, Joyce died in 1974, and in 1979 I married Sandy Jensen.\n\nFred & Ethel (Williams) Lange\n\nChildren: Marie (Mrs. Woodrow Johnson), Leonard, Lucille (Mrs. Charles Morton), Edith, Rosada (Mrs. Alan Nelson), Viola (Mrs. Dale Meyer), Leslie, Betty (Mrs. Harold Snoozy). All the children are deceased except Rosada and Leslie. Both parents also.\n\nThe house has been gone for many years. It was just north of the highway. It was the first house west of Joe Zelenka, it was across a field from his farm. Just south of the road was Vern, Ruth and Margie Zelenka. I think the house is there yet.\n\nWe moved there in the spring of 1932 and moved in October 1934 to Springfield.\n\nD worked for Bill Martin on his farm as a farmhand. He stayed there during the week.\n\nWe all went to Running Water school except Betty, Leslie and Marie. It seems there were at least 30 kids and probably more since our family had 5 kids enrolled. We had one teacher for all grades and I don't think she had any outside help.\n\nSome of the people I remember who lived there were the McBrides, who lived just west of us. There was a creek right by them where Leonard and Rex had a road for a wagon they road down the bank. I don't believe it ever had water in it. Our cousins moved there after we did. They were the Bert Williams family. They lived on the river side of the highway. DeRoos lived on the corner northeast where the road turned north then south to the ferry boat. The store was run by Billmans. They had a grown son. Lucille used to help Mrs. Billman in her house. Margie Zelenka lived there and we played with her a lot. her and I used to make paper dolls and clothes for them from school paper. Dykstras lived on a farm north of us across the field. They had about 7 kids. Violat used to play with mabel, Marie and I were same age and Lucille and Jessie were good friends. Alice Jacob lived a mile east on a farm and Lucille and her were good friends.\n\nWhen we moved to Springfield all us kids hated it. Marie, Lucille and Leonard drove a team of horses pulling a hayrack load of hay with a cow tied behind it to Springfield.\n\nThere were quite a few families in Running Water when we lived there. There was a small post office where the mail came in each night about six. We walked there to get our mail.\n\nMary Lou (Einrem) Livingston\n\nWhen my parents bought the home of John McPeeks in Running Water I was 9 years old. It was truly one of the nicest homes I had ever seen. The old muddy river was just beside out home, the school was only one block away (if you crossed the field). My first teacher here was Betty Wynia. Erwin Eringa, Janette, Annie, and Willma Gelling, Joyce Lancrain and Darwin Dykstra were the only ones attending the school, so when we moved here Mrs. Wynia got three more, my sister Marcleen, Charlie and me. My sister, Joyce, was in high school and she lived in Springfield. Coming here to a small school was different for us as we had always attended larger schools. In early spring of 1948 the George Olson family moved here. They moved into the house just west of us. They had four children, Carolyn, Gary, Gayle and Jennie. Then Helen Walker moved here and she had a son, David, so our town's population seemed to be changing and the school was getting bigger. The George (Swede) Olson family moved here because of the ferry boat, George's father, Henry, owned the ferry \"Bertha\" so George came here to help.\n\nOther neighbors in Running Water were John Terpstra, Mamie, Helen Walker and Helen's son David, Harold (Bud) and Ann Kibble, Mrs. Mildred Burns, who came here just for the summer months, Joe and Kattie Zelenka, William (Slim) and Mary Jacobs, Vern and Viola Zelenka. So we had several close neighbors. School was seldom closed due to the weather as we were all within a walking distance. Our teacher the second year was Harold (Bud) Kibble, that was a real treat as we learned how to ply marbles, jump rope competitions and if you didn't have a dog at home you had one at school, Mr. Kibble had 2 coon dogs who were in attendance at school every day. One of them always layed by my desk, the other one by Mr. Kibble, or in the cold of the winter they would lay around the big black stove. One day in the spring of the year the dog laying by me got sick and vomited green grass all over the floor, Mr. Kibble picked it up with the coal scoop and went on with school like nothing happened. The only one who knew different was my stomach, the dog and the smell stayed for the remainder of the day. Mrs. Walt Einrem (my cousin's wife) was my teacher for the next 2 years. Then Mr. Don Tjeerdsma, that was my last year of grade school and the last year of school for 2 years. They reopened the school but only for a few months, then it was closed permanently.\n\nSome of my good memories of school days were the field days hiking the hills, the competition ball games with other schools (even though we lost), also the Christmas programs and the school picnics at the end of the year, especially the picnic we had in the Niobrara park. My dad was a commercial fisherman and a farmer, and often my brother and I would be up early to go check the nets with Dad and help clean fish if needed, so if it got warm in the school you could usually tell where the Einrem kids were sitting. Rotten cheese (for fish bait) and the wet fish smell seemed to cling to ones hands. Need I say more.\n\nWinters were often very long, but we usually found something to do, if the neighbors were not at our house we were at theirs. Monopoly was a game we all had, as well as the marble game that our dads made us. Cards were something we all loved to play even the adults, night and daytime sleigh riding was also a fun time for all of us kids, with all the big hills around us. We didn't have very many sleds so we made some out of trunk lids and we also used old tires. My cousin, Walt, made all of us skis out of a board and tin, and could we ever go on them. One year we had lots of snow and the fences were covered so we could start out at the far hill, north of the school and ski all the way down to our place. One big challenge was to see who could stand up in the trunk lid and go over the highest snow drift on the hill and still be standing when you go to the bottom. Well, guess who always won? Everyone would bet money that it couldn't be done, and now that I think of it I never did get the money, (Hmm).\n\nPancake Days in Niobrara, Nebraska, was another big time, as Dad would drive the 1929 Chevy on the ice and we would stay over there for the day, many times when it was time to come home the ice had melted enough so we melted so much Dad had a hard time getting the car to Niobrara for groceries. Dad put the groceries in a gunnie sack and tied it to the sled. We would both carry a stick to test the ice that we weren't sure of, before we would walk on it.\n\nSummer time here was like every place else \"HOT.\" Dad and Mom owned property all over in Running Water, so if Dad wasn't farming the land he had cattle on it in the day time. When the cattle were in the pasture by the ferry landing, that was always a good time for a swim (even though we didn't know how) and then bring the cows home. My brother, Charlie, and I always had set lines in the river so while the cows were getting a drink of water we would check the lines. One summer eve as I went over to the pasture to bring the cows home a covered wagon of Gypsies were also going to the river and camp, as the ferry was docked for the evening so they set up camp at the landing. There were always lots of Gypsies with their covered wagons passing through here, they were usually not friendly but these were, so I went over and started talking to them, it was an old man and woman. I was a little nervous because my folks had often told stories of how the gypsies would steal anything even children, so we were told to come right home if any of them came around. anyhow I knew no one would take me, they were so friendly. The lady asked me if my mother would have any soap she could buy, I told her I would ask. But! I told her my mom didn't have boughten soap, only homemade lye soap. \"Oh!\" she said \"I will even pay more for that, because that's much better than store boughten.\" So home I went with the cows, and to tell Mom I had been visiting with the gypsies and they wanted to buy some of her soap. WELL! Mom told me in a \"BIG\" way I shouldn't have talked to them they were bad people, she gave me some soap and told me to give it to the lady, not sell it to her as we wanted to stay on the good side of them, so they wouldn't come steal from us come dark. So away I went with 2 bars of lye soap, the lady was fixing pancakes for their supper when I go there and I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE SEEN SUCH BIG PANCAKES! They asked me to eat with them, because they were so happy for the soap they wanted to share their meal with me, I assured them I wasn't hungry, the lady then asked if I could write, I said \"No but I could print\", she wanted me to write a letter to her daughter for her. It was getting dark out so the lady lit the kerosene lantern and inside the covered wagon we went. That was kind of scary, I will never forget it. their bed was in the front with piles of clothes, a big trunk and some wooden boxes, she hung the lantern on a hook in the middle of the wagon, then she got a sheet of paper and a big round pencil out of the trunk and gave it to me. I was still a little nervous, so I told her maybe I could see better if I sat on the tongue of the wagon, so I did. She told me what to put down and then I went to the river with her while she washed clothes. The next morning when I took the cows to the pasture they were still there and the clothes were hanging on the barbwire fence, I told them good-bye and that was the last time I saw them.\n\nOne other afternoon when I went after the cows the sheriff's cars were blocking the road going to the ferry, so I walked up there to see what was going on, they explained to me that a man who killed lots of people was headed this way to cross on the ferry and they were planning to catch him if he came. They were walking around with their guns in hand ready to shoot if they needed to . I didn't bother them too long as they were very friendly to me and answered all my questions best as they could, so I skipped along after the cows and we never heard any shooting so the criminal must not have shown up.\n\nMrs. Burns was a very dear friend of mine, she lived across the road to the north of us, she usually came in the spring and stayed till early fall. She paid me $1.00 a week to haul her a pail of water from our cistern each day. I often stayed and visited with her and her dog, Rocksie. Many evenings she would invite me over and she would play her old pump organ and I would sing. The organ had a shelf on each side to put the kerosene lamps on, she also had a picture of her boy on there. The organ was beautiful, Mrs. Burns often said when she no longer could play it I could have it. She said she bought it from one of my relatives, however I have often wondered what happened to it, I never got it.\n\nThis is just a small part of what life was like for me as a child growing up here in this little valley. The June floods were one of the bad times here, we were usually fortunate to recover after them, many weren't. I do have good memories of friends, relatives, and everyday happenings in this little village. Only just yesterday I talked to someone who once lived here as a kid when I did. I asked if they would like to share their memories, they replied \"What memories there was never anything here.\" So life is just what one chooses to make of it.\n\nMany years have past since my childhood, I married Delbert \"Ray\" Livingston in 1954, we have lived in Yankton and Running Water always. In the early 1970's we bought my folks place here at Running Water. Ray and I still enjoy the river, we spend many hours hunting and fishing. We own Modern Body Shop in Yankton, so our time is divided between homes. We have four sons, Ronald R. is married to Ruth (Matteson), they live in Springfield, South Dakota, Darrell C. is married to Nancy (Cwach), they have three children, Mary Beth, Jennifer and Carl (C.J.), they live in Yankton, Alan (Cork) R. is married to Gail (Weisser), they have 2 girls, Lindsay and Jessica, they live in Yankton, Kevin L. is not married, his \"love\" is \"Sail Boards\" (as yet), he lives in Yankton. All our children and grandchildren have spent their childhood and adult years here at Running Water, they all share good memories with us.\n\nI work as a Bailiff for Yankton County, and also do the bookkeeping for our body shop, along with that we are members of Trinity Lutheran Church and I belong to the Arickara Chapter of Questers, and my bridge club that have been together for over 25 years. This is what makes ones life so busy and memorable.\n\nRay Livingston\n\nIn 1952 I graduated from Burke High School in South Dakota and came to Springfield to attend trade school at S. S. T. College. I chose to learn to be an auto body repair man, which had been my career for 36 years.\n\nI met this tall blonde Norwegian girl that was so neat and genuine and cheerful. I took her to a prom at the college, she said I would have to take her home out to her parents place at Running Water after the dance. I had no idea where that might be, but eventually we came to this long hill, and I thought I saw a reflection from the headlights of my \"41\" Chevy on the water, about that time she said turn here. I was going too fast to turn, but I remembered that reflection and instantly not knowing how close the water was I turned, I used up all the road and probably part of the ditch to make that turn, but Mary Lou Einrem was home safe and sound from her first prom date with that kid from west river. There must have been an attraction there or something unexplainable as I have loved the blonde and the river ever since.\n\nWe have raised four sons and the river in the Running Water area has given us all countless hours of recreation and enjoyment.\n\nSome of my favorite memories are of my father-in-law, Carl, and I going up to Greenwood and putting his boat in there and running his fish nets on the way down to Running Water. I learned a lot about the river and fishing from him. When we got back it was usually afternoon and we really had an appetite, then my mother-in-law, Grace, would have a feast prepared that would accommodate a threshing crew.\n\nWe have always lived in Yankton where I have my business, Modern Body Shop Inc. Mary Lou helps me with the book work and she also is a Bailiff in the Yankton County Court System, (and she researches and writes historical books.) So on weekends and holidays or anytime off we head for our place up river. I have several friends who have moved to the sun belt and they always ask why we don't move south or to the coast, my answer is \"THAT ALL THOSE PLACES ARE SURE NICE BUT THEY ARE TOO FAR FROM RUNNING WATER.\"\n\nMrs. Walter (Grace) Ludens\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, as told by our folks, two creeks were named by our forefathers. The first was Coffee Creek which was about 9 or 10 miles west of Springfield where Grandpa Wynias first lived in a log house. Later when our folks were married they lived there and Grandpa moved to the place 3/4 miles north of where Petersburg used to be. This creek got its name because the Indians used to stop by the Wynias and they would often trade coffee for blankets that the Indians got from the government. So it was called Coffee Creek.\n\nThe other creek was Mule Creek. It was about one mile east and one mile north of Running Water. It happened that our Dad and 2 sisters, Bertha and Jennie, were coming home from Running Water when a wall of water (result of a cloud burst) came rushing towards them as they were crossing this ravine. Somehow they were saved and the one horse they were driving with was a mule, but the mule drowned and so it was called Mule Creek.\n\nAllen & Alice Marek\n\nOn November 14, 1981, Allen, \"Brute\", and Alice Marek bought their Running Water cottage from Everett C. Thompson and Betty J. Wittrock, a brother and sister of the late Helton Thompson who owned the house.\n\nThe first two summers were spent remodeling and extensively reconditioning the house. Once the house was modernized with an up to date kitchen, new plumbing, electric heat, new wall and floor coverings and new windows, it was time to start on the grounds. Some outdoor changes including removing most of the surrounding forest, looking for the grass underneath an over vegetation cover, digging a new well pit and the installation of a boat dock, used mainly for sunbathing , fishing and dry landing to put on your skis before jumping into the water.\n\nMost of the work on the weekend hideaway was done by us along with the help of our daughter, Trudy, her husband, Douglas, and their three ever ready to help children: Aaron, Amanda, and Allison. We hired some outside help for some of the specialty projects, but most of the sweat was on the family brows, which makes our riverside cottage something very special to us.\n\nRunning Water has a less than ten population during the week, but by 9:00 p.m. Friday evening, there will be more than ten boats tied up to docks along the South Dakota shoreline. The little city's size grows considerably on the weekends. Some come to fish, some come to ski, some come just to enjoy being with family and soaking up some of that warm summer sun. Whatever the reason, it's just a nice quiet place to come to and get away from the hustle and bustle. Just a nice quiet recreation spot on our Missouri River in the state of one hundred years, South Dakota. Stop in and see us!\n\nMcGoldrick Family\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone told me I was the image of my maternal grandmother, McGoldrick Bollinger. I couldn't see it then but now that I am sixty-four, I see my grandmother every time I look into a mirror. She was hardy Irish stock, touch to the end of her eighty-six years. I thank her for her healthy old genes. When I walk the streets of Running Water this summer, I will feel like a ghost from the past.\n\nThe last twelve years of her life my grandmother lived with my Aunt Mildred and Uncle Frank. But every summer till she was eighty-two, she went to her old house in Running Water all the summer months. I was a high school girl during the last three trips to her beloved house, and I stayed with her to help. It was during these warm summer evenings in 1941-1943, as we sat on her screened porch watching the moon rise over her beautiful river, that she told me these stories about the early years.\n\nThe history of our McGoldrick family (as far back as I know) started with the famous Potato Famine in 1846. There had been an earlier potato famine about 1812, but the people managed to survive that one. However, in 1846 they were desperate and this is the time when the great Irish immigration to American began.\n\nMy great grandmother, Bridget Ryan, was born about 1823 in Cork County. She was married to Edward McGoldrick when she was sixteen years old. Edward McGoldrick had a merry heart and a beautiful tenor voice. He loved to sing an Irish tune. They say he often danced an Irish jig while working in his barn. When the potato famine hit, my great grandmother was a young farmwife about twenty-three years old. By this time she had four small children. The decision to leave all they loved in Ireland and go on one of the crude ships to America with four small children must have been a frightening thing to face. But these people had great faith in the goodness of God and perfect trust that they could face the test. Also, there was one other thing that forced them to leave home. There was the problem of the British soldiers roaming the countryside exactly as they are today. I was told of the time my great grandmother nearly got caught crossing a field. She hid in a ditch with a small child on each side breathless and silent. They watched the boots of the soldiers marching along the road above them. My people's hatred of the English was fierce, and with good reason. For the last eight hundred years the Irish have borne the violence as they are bearing it today.\n\nThere were three other families who decided to leave Ireland with my people, they were neighbors and dear friends. The Martins, Malones and Hunts together with the McGoldricks began the hopeful voyage to America sometime in 1846 or near that date.\n\nWhen the immigrant ship arrived in New York harbor, it was not allowed to dock, because a plague of some sort had broken out among the passengers. Fortunately, none of the people my great grandparents loved caught the disease, whatever it was. The ship went on to Quebec, Canada, where no one stopped them from entering there.\n\nMy great grandfather started a maple sugar farm which prospered well in Quebec. My grandmother loved to tell me about the method of gathering maple sugar and the \"sugaring off\" which was great fun for all the children. During the twenty-seven years (from about 1846 to 1873) while they lived in Quebec, my great grandfather built a luxurious big house for his family (which had grown to twelve kids by 1873). That big house is still standing in Quebec, or at least it was there in the 1940's, and it was a night club during the World War II years.\n\nMy grandmother was the youngest child, born on January 23, 1861, when my great grandmother was about thirty-eight years old. In 1873, when my grandmother was twelve years old, there came a great urge to go \"out west\" to the United States where rich land was being given just for the asking. The six older children in the McGoldrick family were all settled in the good lives in Quebec. We traced some them during the 1940's and found Uncle Tim, the oldest son, had been a quite famous lawyer in New York during his long life. My grandmother was educated in the Quebec French School and could read French well, but she never did learn to read or write English very well. While the older children were not interested in going to the United States, there were the six younger children to find good careers yet. Great grandmother and his good friends, the Martins, Malones, and Hunts, decided that this rich new land opening up in the Dakota Territory would be a wonderful opportunity for the young men to take up farms and for their girls to catch a rich farmer husband. So, after about twenty-seven good years of successful life in Quebec, they packed up again and became pilgrims heading west. My grandmother was a little girl of twelve years as they left Quebec, and the other five children were in their teens, there was Tom, Terry and Patrick nearing twenty and Rose and May in early teens, and little Anne, leaving with their parents on that fateful day in 1873. I do not know what means of travel they took, but I am sure they went by train. If they had gone by covered wagons, I am sure I would have heard some colorful stories of the journey, but grandma never said how they got out here.\n\nThey arrived in Running Water to find a wild, lawless river town in the spring of 1873. Somehow they managed to build a protective shelter before the winter came. My great grandmother would have been about fifty years old at this time, and this new life must have weighed heavy on her. They found a place just across from where the Langes lived later, and near where Roy Young's house later stood. Here they dug a shelter back into the hill as most early pioneer families did. This \"cave\" was surprisingly warm in winter and cool in summer. They built a small wood frame front as an entry. A short while later, they moved the small entry room down the hill to the lot on main street across from where the Einrem Livingston house now stands. The entry room became the kitchen for the house they built there. This tiny house would be home for my great grandmother for the rest of her life till 1904 when she died. She must have through many times of the beautiful big house she left in Quebec but my great grandmother was a true saint, and she took this as part of God's plan. Everyone in her life considered her a saint. When she died, the doctor said, \"Her soul was in heaven before the breath left her body.\"\n\nMy grandmother's description of Running Water in those early years was as colorful as any roaring western movie. She told of seeing the huge, black Negro men who worked on the river boats coming up from the south. There were seven saloons (some say there were nine saloons all at one time). The saloon my grandmother remembered best was a bit one that stood on the south edge of the ravine just across from where the Einrem Livingston house now stands. it was on the west side of the street. My Uncle Tom was the best customer of the saloon, and when it burned in the 90's the owner gave my Uncle Tom the huge mirror that had hung over the bar. It still hangs in my brother's house. It is three feet by five feet of mirror encased in a thick, ornate, oak frame. This was the only beautiful thing my great grandmother had, and it hung in her tiny room for many years.\n\nThere was also a hotel uptown where my grandmother worked as a girl, and she told of seeing Wild Bill Hickock and other famous westerners of the time when they stayed at the hotel. Sometimes there were fights in the hotel and the chambermaids would hide behind a door or in a closet when the guns began to blaze. She told of the hard work involved in washing the hotel linens. My grandmother worked for the hotel until she met a nice young man who was with the railroad, named William Bollinger, she married him on August 24, 1889. He was really a Frenchman, but on one could pronounce his name. So he changed it to Bollinger. He had been a newspaper journalist in northern France. Grandma said he got into trouble for criticizing the government and had to leave France one night. Soon after they were married they were sent to Puckwana as a depot agent for the railroad. Mildred Rose was born there on October 16, 1892, and my mother, Edith Marie, was born January 16, 1897. Shortly after my mother was born my grandfather lost a leg on a rainy night while trying to rescue a bum on top of one of the box cars. The train gave a lurch and he got caught between the cars. After this accident, he could no longer hold the important job at Puckwana, and the railroad offered him a lesser job at another depot. My grandfather was a very proud man and would not take a lesser job. While he was in great mental anguish, my grandmother's sister, May, talked my grandmother into leaving him and going back to Running Water. Aunt May's purpose was to get Grandma to take care of their mother so she could go to work in Norfolk, Nebraska. I am sure God punished Aunt May for this in hell for a while. My grandfather wandered off and was never seen again. In the 1940's his two daughters were able to afford to search for him, and found had died in Minneapolis just before their search left them there. Grandma's sadness over this situation grew worse as she neared the end of her life. My mother and Aunt Mildred were reared in Running Water in the tiny house. Grandmother's two bachelor brothers, Tom and Terry, lived there also, and were drunk most of the time. It is a miracle these two children ever grew up to be normal human beings.\n\nComing to Running Water from their home in Quebec was a terrible mistake for the McGoldricks. Tom and Terry did not take up land as they were supposed to do. they became riverboat captains. This was an easier life than farming, and it paid very well. There are records of a summer's work in an old 1922 notebook in which they recorded for June 3rd: automobile 320, teams 217, passengers 1175. This is an accurate example of how their summers went. They also sold ice (which they cut from the river in winter months). These old records show ice was delivered for 75 cents. There is a long list of customers with the average of eight deliveries made over the summer at a $6.00 total price. I am not sure whether these records were for the whole summer of just one month. The customers included C. P. Paterson, Demster, Fitcler, Flavon, O'Donnell, A. Tucker, J. Stevens, Lon Palsma, Thomas, Jud Bolden, Lea Mitchell, Ross Crossley and twenty-five deliveries to the school. There is also a page of records which says \"Work On Poals\" (during January and February) showing the many days of hard work in cutting the ice or \"plowing the ice\" as they called it.\n\nSo, for their times, they made good money. The trouble was, they spent most of it in the saloons. I don't think Uncle Tom was ever really sober, but he was a likable guy. Uncle Terry could go for six months without a drink and then go on a binge. He was not very well liked. When my great grandmother saw that Tom and Terry could not be stopped from their wild lives, she prayed that they be stopped from their wild lives, she prayed that they would find their way back to the Church and die in a state of grace. God granted her prayer. Uncle Tom had moved his boats to Springfield in 1924. He broke a leg that summer and became friends with a priest while in Sacred Heart Hospital in Yankton, who brought him back to the Church. He was back in Springfield a short time when he was shot by someone who knew he usually kept the boat money in his little house. Tom had banked the money that morning (a day earlier than usual) so the thief got no money. Grandma said most people in Springfield had a good idea who shot Tom, but in those days there was little police work to turn to. Uncle Tom was buried November 23, 1924. My mother could not be there because I was bring born that day in Hastings, Minnesota. Uncle Terry also wasted his life, ending up with nothing. At one time he was engaged to a very beautiful girl in Sioux Falls. We have a picture of them taken in Sioux Falls. They were such a handsome pair. But Terry ran away the night before the wedding. The family always said if Terry had married that girl, his life would have been saved, but I always felt that girl was very lucky to be saved by God from marrying Terry. She probably felt terrible. Whenever my life has not gone as I wanted it to go, I think of that girl and realize God knows best. Deserting his bride bothered Terry the rest of his life. He spent his last years living with my mother and my family in Sioux Falls. He felt a little happiness there with us, probably for the first time in his life. He went to mass every Sunday, and I can still see him kneeling straight as a ramrod. He died with the full rites of the Church, thus fulfilling my great grandmother's prayer. No others in this family have ever had this problem of alcoholism.\n\nUncle Patrick did much better than Tom and Terry. He was never an alcoholic, so drinking was never a problem with him. He had a good wife named Aunt Annie, who died early without children. A while later he married another sweet lady, our Aunt Gertie, and they had four beautiful daughters, Esther, Evelyn, Edith and Elva May. Uncle Patrick was a river boat captain also, but he spent his money wisely, and he prospered.\n\nMy aunts Rose and May did remarkably well also. Rose married a young man from a royal family, who had left England to find adventure in the American west, and he found it in Running Water. His father, an English Duke, disowned him when he married Aunt Rose who was Irish and poor. But his mother stuck by him and left him all the money she could. He and Aunt Rose were in Seattle, Washington, when this inheritance came to them. They bought a large store there much like a Kmart of today. They also owned most of the ocean front property there at one time. They had two sons, Lionel and Einer, and a daughter, Evelyn. I think this uncle's first name was probably a name he did not like, because we only know him as Uncle \"Ack\" Atkinson. His listing in the family Bible is Y. H. Atkinson.\n\nAunt May went to work in the state hospital at Norfolk, Nebraska, and married Dr. Dave Regan, who was superintendent of the male wards. She was an early occupational therapist (except that in those days they called it the \"art room\" for women patients who enjoyed making lace and creating gorgeous embroidery, etc. They never had children, so we were all their children. Grandma said that during the Depression Uncle Dave could have foreclosed on most of Norfolk, because he loaned money to most of the businessmen who asked him for help. They sleep on a hill overlooking Norfolk. My Aunt May had only one failing, she always knew what was best for everyone, and she ruined several lives including my grandmother's life.\n\nSo the two little girls who were my mother and Aunt Mildred grew up in the good years of Running Water's life from 1897 to 1915. When they were grown up and ready to go out into the world, Aunt Mildred met her husband, Frank Burns and married him in 1912. He was working on the railroad in Running Water. Their only child, Francis Leonard, was born in 1914, shortly after his birth, they moved to Sioux Falls where Uncle Frank was sent as foreman of the switchmen on the Rock Island line. Even during the Depression years, Uncle Frank always had a good job with the Rock Island. He died in October, 1974, and Grandma died the spring of that year.\n\nMy mother, Edith Marie, went to work at the Yankton State Hospital in 1915 as an eighteen year old girl, and found she liked that work. She enjoyed working in the hospital at Beatrice, Nebraska and met my father, John Bryant, there. He was in charge of the music therapy which meant creating fun and parties and dances for the patients. He was an accomplished violinist and was very good at his work. They were married in Beatrice on April 2, 1922. A short while later, they went to the State Hospital in Hastings, Minnesota, and I was born there on November 23, 1924. There was a law that no children could live on state hospital grounds, so my parents decided to get out of state hospital work and they came to Sioux Falls. My dad worked as a barber at the Cataract Hotel and in spite of the Depression, he was able to start his own barber shop in the Stock Exchange Building at the Stock Yards. This little business continued to support us all those miserable Depression years fairly well. Dad enjoyed his work and did not retire until he was seventy years old. My brother, Larry, was born January 18, 1929. His real name is John Alfred Bryant, Jr., but everyone calls him Larry. I forgot to say cousin Leonard became a prominent lawyer in Sioux Falls, and brother, Larry, has been the staff artist for KELO TV from the first days of KELO's start in 1953.\n\nThere are also all the things I remember as a child visiting my grandmother in the summers during the 1930-1943 era. One night we had just arrived at Grandma's house when she called me to , \"Come quick and see the train pulling in.\" I saw the train with its two coaches lit up running along the river side to the depot. I did not realize I was seeing one of the last trains to pull into Running Water. I must have been only five years old when I saw it, because June Henderson told me the trains quit coming to Running Water in 1929. But I can see that train with its many windows lit up in the early evening darkness as though it was yesterday.\n\nI remember the big kettle of catfish my grandmother always seemed to have on the back of her stove. How delicious those catfish were, and the pancakes with crispy edges and sweet chokecherry jelly. There were chokecherry bushes all over the yard and in the ravine south of the house to make her wonderful jelly. There was also a line of D. B. Gurney's good cherry trees along the fence by the road. I can see Uncle Terry up on the ladder picking cherries day after day, and Grandma, with her sleeves rolled up, canning cherries in the 100 degree heat of those Depression summers. There was a garden by the south side of the house which they managed to grow. It was my job to take a pail and pick the potato bugs off the potato leaves, but I spent more time eating the peas than I did picking the bugs.\n\nGrandma always had a big bar of pine tar soap by the water barrel outside her kitchen door. How I loved the smell of that pine tar soap and the soft feeling of the rain water on my skin. That big barrel of rain water was all she had for bathing and laundry. One year there was so little water we did not dare to use one drop carelessly, and Mother would give me only a small soup bowl of water to bathe in. We were always glad to get back to our faucets in Sioux Falls. I remember the baloney sandwiches Aunt Mildred always made to eat on our trips to Running Water. Whenever I eat a baloney sandwich today, I can still taste the hot dust from the gravel roads which we travelled on. there were no paved roads after we left Highway 16 in those days. There was a little girl just my age who lived across the street from Grandma's house for a few years, her name was Margie Zelenka. I remember how excited I was one summer when we came to visit Grandma, and she was there. There were the little Lange kids who were so sweet and shy until I finally coaxed them into playing on Grandma's big screened porch. There were the visits with Grandma's friends, the Martins. I can still see the huge, square, white farm house on the \"top Road\" . How grand that house was. The Martins had all t"
