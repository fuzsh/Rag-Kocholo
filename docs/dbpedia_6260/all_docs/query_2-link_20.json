        "text": "New DPhil in Area Studies Launched at Oxford\n\n17 August 2016\n\nThe School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS) is proud to announce the launch of a new and distinctive DPhil in Area Studies to complement its existing world-renowned master’s programmes. Applications for our doctorate will be accepted from September 1st 2016, for entry in October 2017.\n\nThe School is recognised as one of the world’s foremost centres for research and teaching in Area Studies, offering specialist postgraduate courses covering Africa, China, Japan, Latin America, Russia and Eastern Europe, India and South Asia, and the Middle East. SIAS hosts the largest department of Area Studies scholars anywhere, engaging with both theoretical and empirical debates to deliver ground-breaking research that shapes a better understanding of contemporary global challenges. In the recent REF, the School’s submission was rated as the most impressive in terms of volume of research that was judged to be world leading (4*) – by a considerable margin. Building on these firm foundations for success, the department offers a vibrant and dynamic educational environment and we are very excited to be adding the DPhil in Area Studies to this impressive portfolio.\n\nOur DPhil is a research doctorate designed to turn students into scholars. Its distinctive approach will provide the opportunity to undertake a project dedicated to the study of a specific country, a particular region, or to create a comparative perspective of more than one country or region from across the School’s area-based programmes and Centres. Throughout their time studying for the DPhil in Area Studies, the department’s doctoral cohort will be part of an international community of students, tutors, researchers, and practitioners from across the School that engage with Area Studies, as well as with relevant disciplines from the Social Sciences Division and the University as a whole.\n\nFor more information, please visit the course pages of the School website or email admissions@area.ox.ac.uk.\n\nFull details about the application process and the application form will be available on the University’s Admissions webpages from 1st September 2016.\n\nWorkshop \"Forty years on from Operation Condor: Comparative Experiences in the Southern Cone and Brazil:” Final Report now available in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese\n\n26 July 2016\n\nOn June 24, 2016, Dr Francesca Lessa organised together with the Observatorio Luz Ibarburu a closed-session workshop, held at the Montevideo’s Municipal Government in Montevideo, Uruguay, with the participation of human rights activists, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and members of national ministries, for a total of 36 participants. Taking as starting point the Operation Condor trial in Buenos Aires, but also investigations in Chile and Uruguay on the same subject, the discussion focused on the legal and factual challenges associated with investigating transnational crimes. Working in two small groups, the goal was to develop suggestions for concrete tools and strategies to implement at the national and regional levels to facilitate the investigation of Operation Condor crimes. Two key recommendations that emerged from the workshop were: the creation of teams dedicated exclusively to the investigation of human rights lawsuits and the need to establish channels ensuring a smooth flow of information, such as for example, creating a database for judges and prosecutors to access information and records to use in judicial proceedings.\n\nThe final report is now available in Spanish, French, English and Portuguese.\n\nDPhil student wins thesis prize at the Museum of Memory in Santiago, Chile\n\n4 July 2016\n\nHugo Rojas Corral, an Oxford DPhil student, was awarded a prize for his thesis “The Veil of Oblivion: Explaining indifference to past human rights violations in Chile” by the Museum of Memory in Santiago, Chile.\n\nOperation Condor, 40 Years Later: a three-day event by the Latin American Centre and the Observatorio Luz Ibarburu\n\n30 July 2016\n\nThe Latin American Centre of the University of Oxford and the Observatorio Luz Ibarburu (OLI), together with Montevideo’s Municipal Government and the Human Rights Secretariat of the Central Trade Union PIT-CNT, held a three-day event in Montevideo (Uruguay) from June 22 to 24, 2016, within the framework of the project “Justice without Borders: Accountability for Transnational Crimes in South America,” funded by the ESRC’s Impact Acceleration Account of the University de Oxford, The Leverhulme Trust, The British Academy, and also supported by Open Society Foundations’ Human Rights Initiative.\n\nThe event was held the week before the 43rd anniversary of the dictatorial coup in Uruguay and commemorated the 40th anniversary of Operation Condor, of which Uruguay was a founding member. The transnational network of Operation Condor - set up by the regimes of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay – facilitated the persecution of political opponents beyond borders throughout South America, resulting in hundreds of illegal detentions, murders, and disappearances.\n\nOn Wednesday, June 22, a press conference took place in the building of the Uruguayan Press Association to formally launch the event. The speakers were Dr. Francesca Lessa (LAC), Raúl Olivera (OLI Coordinator) and Dr. Pablo Ouviña (Condor Trial public prosecutor). That same afternoon, Dr. Lessa, Dr. Ouviña, Dr. Paulina Zamorano (Human Rights Programme, Chilean Ministry of Interior) and journalist Luiz Claudio Cunha were invited to Radio Uruguay on the afternoon show to discuss progresses and challenges in the prosecution of Condor crimes in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil.\n\nOn Thursday, June 23, the conference “Operation Condor: 40 Years Later” was held in the Paraninfo of the University of the Republic. The conference was organized just one month after the historic Operation Condor trial in Buenos Aires ended. The key conference goals were to disseminate the verdict and discuss the status of investigations into Condor crimes across the Southern Cone and Brazil. The Opening Panel inaugurated the event with the words of Hugo Rodriguez, the representative sent by the University Chancellor’s Office, Dr. Francesca Lessa (LAC Oxford) and Raúl Olivera (OLI Coordinator).\n\nThe first panel focused on the Operation Condor trial in Buenos Aires and the speakers were: Lorena Balardini (University of Buenos Aires), who provided an overview of human rights trials in Argentina over the past decade; Jaime Nuguer (lawyer for the original lawsuit), who outlined the origins of the historic Condor prosecution in 1999; Martin Rico (lawyer from Argentina’s Ministry of Justice Human Rights Secretariat), who discussed the background and features of Operation Condor; and Pablo Ouviña (Prosecutor in the Argentine Operation Condor trial), who through the emblematic case of two Uruguayans and three Argentines detained in Paraguay in 1977, discussed the inner workings of Operation Condor. The moderator was Dr. Francesca Lessa, from Oxford.\n\nThe second panel tackled investigations on Operation Condor crimes in Uruguay. It began with criminal prosecutor Gilberto Rodriguez who discussed some of the challenges in human rights prosecutions in Uruguay. Subsequently, Mirtha Guianze, a former criminal prosecutor, outlined her work in two leading cases relating to Operation Condor, which led to two historic verdicts in 2009, in one case seeing a former military dictator sentenced for 37 murders. Judge Mariana Mota recounted her efforts as a criminal judge when she was tackling over 50 separate criminal proceedings relating to dictatorship crimes, several of them linked to Operation Condor. Pablo Chargoñia (Coordinator of the Legal Team of the Observatorio Luz Ibarburu) described current efforts by the legal team in litigating trials in Uruguay, including the recent filing of a new lawsuit regarding the disappearance of Uruguayan Hector Giordano in Buenos Aires in 1978. Lilian Celiberti, a Uruguayan survivor of an Operation Condor kidnapping in Brazil, narrated the enduring struggle against impunity in Uruguay. The panel was moderated by Leonardo Di Cesare, a lawyer from the OLI.\n\nThe third panel focused on Operation Condor and Brazil. Jair Krischke, President of the NGO Movement for Justice and Human Rights, narrated endeavours undertaken to firstly locate and then extradite to Argentina former Uruguayan Army Coronel, Manuel Cordero, later sentenced for 11 cases of disappearances in Buenos Aires in the Condor trial. Journalist Luiz Claudio Cunha who saved Lilian Celiberti’s life in 1978 when he went to her house together with a photographer, recounted his attempts to ensure that Lilian and her family members would not be disappeared and that the individuals involved in the failed kidnapping would be identified. Finally, public prosecutor Ivan Claudio Marx discussed his work in trying to initiate criminal investigations in Brazil regarding Operation Condor atrocities committed there.\n\nOn Friday, June 24, a closed-session workshop was held on the premises of Montevideo’s Municipal Government with the participation of human rights activists, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and members of national ministries, for a total of 36 participants. Taking as starting point the Operation Condor trial in Buenos Aires, but also prosecutions in Uruguay and Chile on the same subject, the discussion focused on the legal and factual challenges associated with investigating transnational crimes. After an introductory session, two separate groups worked for 1.5 hours to address debate and exchange experiences in relation to the Operation Condor trial and the investigation and prosecution of transnational crimes. Working in the two groups, led by the project consultant Lorena Balardini (PhD student at the University of Buenos Aires), Dr. Lessa, Raúl Olivera, and Maria Florencia Gonzalez (Chilean Ministry of Justice and Human Rights), the aim was to develop suggestions for concrete tools and strategies to implement at the national and regional levels to facilitate the investigation of Operation Condor crimes. Among the key recommendations discussed were the creation of a regional database to simplify the exchange of information and proofs among judges and prosecutors, as well as the creation of multidisciplinary research teams. These conclusions, together with those gathered in the 2015 event in Chile, will be then presented to regional organisations and justice ministries.\n\nPress and Radio Links about the Event:\n\nRadio Uruguay\n\nhttp://www.radiouruguay.com.uy/innovaportal/v/88829/22/mecweb/jornadas-internacionales-sobre-el-plan-condor?parentid=80188\n\nhttp://www.radiouruguay.com.uy/innovaportal/v/89202/22/mecweb/nos-sorprendio-la-cantidad-de-gente-que-participo-dijo-investigadora-italiana-sobre-jornadas-por-plan-condor?parentid=11305\n\nLa Diaria\n\nhttp://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2016/6/todavia-esperamos/\n\nhttp://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2016/6/recuerdos-vivos/\n\nTele Doce\n\nhttp://www.teledoce.com/telemundo/nacionales/fiscal-argentino-no-hay-mas-uruguayos-procesados-por-el-plan-condor-porque-se-rechazaron-las-extradiciones/\n\nHispanTV\n\nhttp://www.hispantv.com/noticias/uruguay/279789/investigaciones-victimas-plan-condor-montevideo\n\nSputnik GPS Internacional\n\nhttp://mundo.sputniknews.com/radio_gps_internacional/20160628/1061319202/nuevo-modelo-de-gobernanza-global.html\n\nEfe\n\nhttp://www.efe.com/efe/cono-sur/cono-sur/la-condena-por-el-plan-condor-sirve-para-concienciar-a-los-jovenes-dice-fiscal-del-caso/50000818-2965041\n\nHorizontes 2016\n\n29 June 2016\n\nWe are pleased to announce the publication of our 2016 edition of Horizontes, the University of Oxford Latin American Centre newsletter.\n\nSIAS Green Impact Team goes GOLD!\n\n16 June 2016\n\nOn Wednesday 15th June, the University’s Environmental Sustainability Team invited us all to the Blavatnik School of Government for their annual Sustainability Showcase.\n\nWe are proud to announce that the School’s Green Impact Team were presented with a Gold award – the highest accolade possible within the Green Impact scheme.\n\nThe Showcase is an opportunity to distribute awards to the numerous Green Impact teams and others involved in sustainability practices for their achievements over the past year and this year’s event was described by Professor William James, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Planning and Resources) as “the biggest celebration of social and environmental actions…at Oxford University ever” joining together the Sustainability Awards and the Social Impact Awards for the very first time.\n\nVice-Chancellor, Professor Louise Richardson said “There really is an extraordinary amount of work taking place in the University, both within the Departments and most particularly across them, which is really very exciting.”\n\nThe evening itself not only gave us the chance to celebrate our achievements, but also to take part in a tour of the recently opened Blavatnik School of Government at the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter.

The transnational network of Operation Condor - set up by the regimes of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay – facilitated the persecution of political opponents beyond borders throughout South America, resulting in hundreds of illegal detentions, murders, and disappearances.\n\nOn Thursday, December 17, the conference “40 Years since Operation Condor: Justice without Borders” was held in a symbolic location, the former Congress, shut down by the Pinochet dictatorship and later moved to Valparaiso. The Opening Panel inaugurated the event with the words of the Chilean Sub-secretary of Justice, Ignacio Suárez, and with the participation of Ricardo Brodsky (Director of the Museum of Memory and Human Rights), Humberto Henderson (UN OHCHR Deputy Regional Representative for South America), Fernando Silva (Executive Director of the Senate’s Centro de Extension) and Dr Francesca Lessa (Researcher and project leader, University of Oxford). The panel’s moderator was Sergio Campos, from Radio Cooperativa, an emblematic voice that accompanied Chileans through the dark days of the dictatorship.\n\nThe second panel focused on the Operation Condor trial in Buenos Aires and the speakers were Jaime Nuguer (lawyer for the original lawsuit), who outlined the origins of the historic prosecution in 1999; Martin Rico (lawyer from Argentina’s Ministry of Justice Human Rights Secretariat), who discussed the background and features of Operation Condor; Luz Palmás Zaldua (lawyer from Argentina’s Centre for Legal and Social Studies) that analysed the strategic role played by human rights NGOs in the struggle for justice in Argentina for three decades, and Pablo Ouviña (Prosecutor in the Argentine Operation Condor trial), who through the emblematic case of Chilean-Swiss Alexei Jaccard Siegler, discussed the inner workings of Operation Condor. The moderator was Maria Florencia Gonzalez from the Human Rights Unit of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe third panel tackled the status of investigation about Operation Condor crimes in Chile. It began with former Appeals Court judge for human rights, Alejandro Solis, who discussed the case of the 1974 Operation Condor assassination in Buenos Aires of General Carlos Prats and his wife, a case he investigated. Subsequently, Paulina Zamorano Valenzuela, from the Human Rights Programme of the Ministry of Interior and Public Security, outlined the current Operation Condor case, as well as some of the obstacles and challenges of this specific investigation. Laura Elgueta Diaz recounted in a moving testimony the suffering of her family that, after leaving Chile to take refuge in Buenos Aires in 1974, had to live through the disappearance of her brother Luis Enrique in 1976 and her own detention in 1977 in Argentina. Eduardo Contreras, who filed the historic lawsuit that led to Pinochet’s being prosecuted for human rights violations in Chile, narrated some of the precedents and contexts to Operation Condor. Lastly, Dr Patricio Bustos, Director of the Legal Medical Service, described the forensic work of this unit. The panel was moderated by MP Tucapal Jimenez.\n\nThe conference concluded with the screening at the Museum of Memory of the new documentary “Operacão Condor: Verdade Inconclusa” (Operation Condor: an unfinished truth) with the participation of its director Cleonildo Cruz, an event attended by over 80 people.\n\nOn Friday, December 18, a closed-session workshop was held at the Miguel de Cervantes University with the participation of human rights activists, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and members of national ministries, for a total of invited 24 participants, including Mario Carroza, judge of the Operation Condor case in Chile. Taking as starting point the Operation Condor trial in Buenos Aires, but also investigations in Chile on the same subject, the discussion focused on the legal and factual challenges associated with investigating transnational crimes. After an introductory session, two separate groups, with Argentine and Chilean participants, worked for 1.5 hours to address debate and exchange experiences in relation to the Operation Condor trial and the investigation and prosecution of transnational crimes. Working in the two groups, led by the project consultants Lorena Balardini and Marcos Kotlik (both PhD students at the University of Buenos Aires), the aim was to develop suggestions for concrete tools and strategies to implement at the national and regional levels to facilitate the investigation of Operation Condor crimes. Among the key recommendations discussed were the creation of a regional database to simplify the exchange of information and proofs among judges and prosecutors, as well as the creation of multidisciplinary research teams. These conclusions, together with those gathered in the subsequent events in 2016 in Brazil and Uruguay, will be then presented to regional organisations and justice ministries.\n\nLinks to press Notes about the events\n\nMinistry of Justice\n\nChilean Judiciary\n\nMiguel de Cervantes University\n\nInterviews (in Spanish)\n\nDr Lessa at Radio Cooperativa\n\nProsecutor Pablo Ouviña on CNN Chile\n\nNew report on social policy in Central America for ECLAC\n\n13 January 2016\n\nJuliana Martínez Franzoni, Diego Sánchez Ancochea and Salvador Martí have just concluded a report on universalism and social policy in Latin America that can be found on the CEPAL webpage. Here is the abstract:\n\nThis document studies changes and continuities in terms of social incorporation in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua since the early 1990s. To this effect, old-age pensions, health services and conditional cash transfers (CCTs) programs, particularly in their relation to health services, are studied. The main concern is establishing the evolution of universal incorporation —particularly important for income redistribution— which takes place when social programs combine broad coverage, generosity and equity.\n\nThe study reports significant improvements in terms of social incorporation but most often of a segmented (as opposed to universal) kind. The three countries still face significant problems of coverage, generosity and equity in healthcare and pensions. Meanwhile, CCTs have been unequally able to influence the other social policy sectors. Although the three countries share these patterns, the document shows that El Salvador has taken more significant steps to promote universalism in healthcare (but not in pensions).\n\nCAF European Academic Network: Book Launch on “Desafección Política\"\n\n30 November 2015\n\nOn 27th November, Timothy Power was a discussant at the book launch for Ludolfo Paramio (editor), Desafección política y gobernabilidad: el reto político (Madrid: Marcial Pons, 2015).

In this edited volume, an international and interdisciplinary group of scholars and development practitioners explore the causes of, consequences of, and contemporary reactions to Brazil’s sharply unequal agrarian structure. They focus on the Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST), Latin America’s largest and most prominent social movement, and the ongoing efforts of the MST to confront historical patterns of inequality in the Brazilian countryside. Carter obtained his doctorate in political science at Columbia University, served as a lecturer at American University and is currently the Founding Director of DEMOS – Centro para la Democracia, la Creatividad y la Inclusión Social, a new think tank based in Paraguay.\n\nThe book´s dedicated page at the Duke University Press website can be found here, and for a link to the volume’s front matter and overview chapter see here.\n\nNEW BOOK FROM TRACY FENWICK\n\n18 May 2015\n\nTracy Beck Fenwick (Australian National University), a former St Antony’s student and LAC affiliate, has just published Federalism, Democracy, and Poverty Alleviation in Brazil and Argentina with the University of Notre Dame Press.

This goal involves user-led research to collect data and analyze evidence needed for effective litigation and public policy models. Second, the project aims to raise awareness of corporate complicity in repressive regimes. It thus includes user-led public engagement activities to disseminate the main findings of the project. The third aim is to produce valuable research and analytical tools to be adapted to other countries in which business are complicit in human rights violations. It relies on the co-development of research tools, specifically capacity-building through training and enhancing human resources to carry out needed research and analysis to advance accountability efforts. Fourth, an overall aim of the project is to legitimize and protect the work of human rights practitioners in this controversial area of abuse. It will achieve this goal by connecting the serious and objective work of human rights practitioners to the world renowned University of Oxford, providing global and local resonance to that project.\n\nProfessor Payne will present her research findings on transitional justice at World Bank HQ\n\n3 March 2015\n\nProfessor Payne from the Transitional Justice Research Collaborative will discuss the impact of transitional justice mechanisms in strengthening democracy, human rights, and peace at the World Bank headquarters on Thursday 5 March. The Transitional Justice Research Collaborative, under way since 2010, is the most comprehensive single collection of information on TJ mechanisms in 116 countries around the world from 1970 to 2012. The group recently launched a website (https://transitionaljusticedata.com) including data on two parts to this project: traditional mechanisms (trials, amnesties, and truth commissions) and \"alternative accountability\" mechanisms (lustration and vetting, traditional or customary trials, civil trials, and reparations). Based on the analysis of these data, there is evidence to support the claims for the value of TJ in strengthening democracy, human rights, and peace. But not all mechanisms, at all times, or in all combinations produce positive outcomes. The new database and analysis is more refined and complete than its previous iteration, allowing for further testing and confirmation of some of the assumptions behind TJ's impact. Professor Leigh Payne and Bridget Marchesi will present a summary of their findings and suggest new directions in TJ to enhance its effect.\n\nOutside Participants: We welcome participants from outside the World Bank. For reasons of building security, attendees who are not World Bank Group staff will need to register by emailing Victoria Esquivel-Korsiak at vesquivelkorsiak@worldbank.org by 12pm March 4th.\n\nNew grant awarded to researchers at the Latin American Centre\n\n12 February 2015\n\nDiego Sánchez-Ancochea and Francesca Lessa were successfully awarded a grant from the University of Oxford’s ESRC Impact Acceleration Account in February 2015 for their project on Operation Condor and accountability for transnational crimes in South America. The project will run for eight months (May to December 2015) and will bring together the Oxford researchers and local partners in Brazil, Chile and Uruguay for exchanges on the topic of accountability for transnational crimes, to debate and develop appropriate and effective public policies to redress crimes perpetrated by multiple states. Judiciaries across the world increasingly have to respond to transnational crimes, i.e. crimes perpetrated by complex criminal structures made up of multiple state and/or non-state actors. What challenges do judiciaries face when dealing with transnational crimes? What public policies may be needed? What forms of inter-judiciary, civil society and governmental cooperation underpin and increase the effectiveness of accountability efforts?\n\nThe proposed project addresses these policy-relevant questions by focusing on current judicial efforts, specifically the Operation Condor trial in Argentina, to redress the transnational crimes perpetrated jointly by military dictatorships in South America in the 1970s and 1980s. The Operation Condor trial is an excellent case study: it encompasses legal professionals, state and civil society actors and has required national as well as international forms of cooperation to facilitate the investigation of these complex offences.\n\nPhoto Credit: H.I.J.O.S. Capital\n\nRemembering Tulio Halperín-Donghi (1926-2014)\n\n9 January 2015\n\nTulio Halperín-Donghi, who held the Chair in Latin American History at Oxford in 1970-1, passed away last 14 November. Born in Buenos Aires on 27 October 1926, he completed his doctoral degree in history at the Universidad de Buenos Aires in 1955 going on to become one of the most respected Argentine historians of his generation. He lectured at the universities of Rosario, Buenos Aires and Harvard before coming to Oxford, and then moved for the rest of his academic career to the University of California at Berkeley, where he was made an Emeritus Professor in 1997. He published extensively on the history of Argentina and Latin America, including Argentina en el callejón (Montevideo, 1964), Politics, Economics and Society in Argentina in the Revolutionary Period (Cambridge, 1975), The Contemporary History of Latin America (Duke, 1993), and Una nación para el desierto argentino (Buenos Aires, 2005). His death, Francisco Pereguil wrote in El País, has ‘motivated in Argentina a similar consensus that the one which existed around his hero, Manuel Belgrano, to whom he devoted his last book. The Latin American Centre laments his passing and pays tribute to his memory. Below a few words from Klaus Gallo, Malcolm Deas and Alan Knight remembering him.\n\nKlaus Gallo, Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, writes: Tulio Halperín Donghi was a unique intellectual. His legacy in Argentine historiography is as powerful as that of Jorge Luis Borges in Argentine literature. Masterpieces such as Revolución y guerra (1972), Tradición política española e ideología revolucionaria de Mayo (1961), Una nación para el desierto argentino (1982) and Guerra y finanzas en los orígenes del estado argentino (1791-1850) (1982), among other outstanding publications, are all groundbreaking contributions that encompass the fields of political, social, intellectual and economic history, a fact that reveals Halperín’s versatility as a historian.\n\nBorn in 1926 in Buenos Aires, Halperín graduated in Law and History in that city’s university and continued with his postgraduate studies at the École Pratique des\n\nHautes Études, in Paris, where he established direct contact with Fernand Braudel and the écoles d’anales. Back in Argentina, he became a regular collaborator in publications such as Sur, the cultural supplement of La Nación, and Imago Mundi, where he met José Luis Romero and Claudio Sánchez Albornoz. It was partly due to the influence of these two historians that Halperín drove his attention towards medieval European history, an area of study to which he eventually dedicated his doctoral thesis Un conflicto nacional: moriscos y cristianos viejos en Valencia, presented in 1954.\n\nA few years before, Halperín had already published his first significant work, a study on one of the pioneers of the so called Argentine Romantic group or Generación del 37, Esteban Echeverría, entitled El pensamiento de Echeverría (1951), putting in evidence, at this early hour, the wide range of his historical interests. This book is paradoxically one of Halperín’s least cited contributions, with a very limited circulation. During the latter part of that decade, Halperín wrote a series of articles around other referents of Argentina’s early intellectual and historiographic tradition such as Bartolomé Mitre, Vicente Fidel López, José María Ramos Mejía and Juan Alvárez.\n\nIn the first half of the 1960’s Halperín experienced the tumultuous and traumatic consequences of the post-peronist political experience in Argentina, which eventually forced him to abandon the University of Buenos Aires and leave his country in 1966, shortly after the military coup that same year. He arrived to the United States where he was professor at Harvard and, a couple of years later, also in the United Kingdom after obtaining the prestigious Chair in Latin American History at the University of Oxford. From 1971 onwards he taught at the University of California, at Berkeley. During the late sixties and early seventies, Halperín published some of his most significant books, namely Historia contemporánea de América latina; Revolución y Guerra. Formación de una elite dirigente en la Argentina criolla, which most historians regard as his most significant work, and also Historia Argentina. De la revolución de Independencia hasta la Confederación Rosista, which no doubt contributed to consolidate his stance as one of Latin America´s most prolific and influencial historians.\n\nBy the time democracy was re-established in Argentina in 1983, Halperín was already revered as a living legend in academic and intellectual circles, especially after the revitalization experienced in the sphere of historical studies, which allowed him to return more often to his country and participate actively in all sorts of academic events. In spite of his aura, those fortunate enough to approach him on such occasions –professors, students, admirers- were frequently surprised by his accessibility and humility. His influence is visible also in the academic contributions of some of his students and disciples during the last half century.\n\nDuring the eighties and nineties, Halperín’s concern with the complexities of Argentine politics, was made visible with the publication of La larga agonía de la Argentina peronista (1994) and the re-edition of works such as Argentina. La democracia de masas (1991), a work that dated from 1972 and Argentina en el callejón (1995), originally published in 1964. This intense incursion in more contemporary themes coexisted with a series of writings on Argentine political and intellectual history, which Halperín presented as a collection of anthologies for the Biblioteca del Pensamiento Argentino, consisting of seven volumes published by Ariel. Four of these volumes were written and edited by established Argentine historians such as José Carlos Chiaramonte, Natalio Botana, Ezequiel Gallo, Beatríz Sarlo and Carlos Altamirano. The reminding three volumes were of Halperin’s authorship: the re-edited Proyecto y construcción de una Nación (1996); Vida y muerte de la República verdadera; 1910-1930 (2000); La República Imposible. 1930 - 1945. (2004)\n\nHis more recent publications reflect up to what extent he was inclined to return to the area of studies of his first publications: intellectual history in general, and more specifically the political trajectories of certain Latin American nineteenth century intellectual referents, namely Alberdi, Sarmiento, Mitre, Lastarria, Mier, Samper, Prieto and Belgrano, as can be witnessed particularly in some of his essays published in the brilliant El espejo de la historia; problemas argentinos y perspectivas hispanoamericanas (1987), more recently in Letrados y Pensadores. El perfilamiento del Intelectual hispanoamericano en el siglo XIX (2012), and in his final and probably most controversial contribution, El enigma Manuel Belgrano. Un héroe para nuestro tiempo (2014). He also wrote an autobiography entitled Son Memorias, an incisive account of his early life and first incursions in the academic world which, inevitably, left quite a few of his readers longing for a follow up rendering his most prolific years as a leading historian.\n\nCertain patterns and trends reverberate from the wide variety and scope of Halperín´s works. As the reader penetrates an often complex, dense and at times impenetrable narrative structure, he is confronted and simultaneously illuminated by the ironies, nuances, subtleties, and wit that emerge from Halperín´s sharp and original analysis. A similar effect was evident on the occasions when Halperín lectured in courses and conferences or simply conversed with colleagues and friends in cafes and restaurants. Apart from his invaluable academic contributions, it was his style that made him truly unique, a style that enabled him to achieve what few have managed: a trademark.\n\nMalcolm Deas writes: ‘Tulio's passage through Oxford was relatively short, but long enough for all of us who came to know him and who heard him lecture here to have fixed in our memories his brilliance, originality and wit. He was also, behind a certain shyness and puzzlement with the native Anglo-Saxons, a keen and often amused observer of the vagaries of the University and of many of its inhabitants. On meeting him on subsequent occasions in Argentina, one would be again impressed by his limitless and undiminished curiosity and incisiveness, and be moved by his friendly enquiries about his erstwhile colleagues here, which showed we were not forgotten’.\n\nAlan Knight writes: I was a graduate student and postdoc at Oxford during Tulio’s brief stint as Professor of the History of Latin America. In fact, the first paper I ever gave was in the LAC, c1971, with Tulio chairing, charitably. Though he (and his family) did not take to Oxford (and who can blame them, I am tempted to add?) so he moved on to UC Berkeley, where he remained thereafter. But he maintained an interest in Oxford, and recommended at least one Argentine historian, Roy Hora, to opt for Oxford, when he did his (very good) doctorate. Tulio also returned to Oxford for occasional events, maintaining an interest in our modest programme, and I encountered him at several conferences over the years: at Berkeley, Urbana-Champaign, and Tel-Aviv (when we visited Jerusalem together and Tulio, though already quite old, had no trouble with the touristic forced march we had to undergo). Though towards the end of his life he became physically very frail, his sharp intellect was never blunted: at the last LASA conference (Chicago May 2014), which he could not attend in person, they showed an interview recently filmed at Berkeley which showed him to be as lively as ever. He could also be waspishly critical (‘he did not suffer fools gladly’); but I won’t name names. His historical output was very substantial and wide-ranging. Though C19 Argentina was his chief area of expertise, about which he spoke with more authority than almost anyone, he also knew a lot about Mexico and ventured some interesting – and cogent - comparisons between the two countries. His writing (in Spanish) made few concessions to slow-witted or impatient readers; when I started teaching a Latin American survey course at Essex University in 1973 I discovered, somewhat to my surprise, that Tulio’s Historia Contemporánea de América Latina was the set text, which posed a formidable challenge to students, it being dense, allusive, and written in Tulio’s elaborate baroque style, whereby clauses and parentheses writhed their way through serpentine sentences. But it remains one of the best overviews of modern Latin American history which – when very ably translated and abridged by John Chasteen – also became a stand-out textbook. It is difficult to think of another historian who made such a big contribution to our knowledge of C19 (and to some extent C20) Latin America.\n\nProfessor Leigh Payne receives Newton Fund Research Grant\n\n9 January 2015\n\nCongratulations to Professor Leigh Payne and Oriana Bernasconi Ramírez from Universidad Alberto Hurtado, recipients of a Newton Fund Research Grant.

In a multidisciplinary dialogue, the delegates explored Colombia’s challenges related to security and democracy during the peace process and reflected upon the long-term implications for a potential post-conflict period. The conference thus provided a critical space to engage in a fruitful, intellectually stimulating discussion guided by the following themes: (i) past peace negotiations; (ii) democracy and political participation; (iii) security, drugs and justice; (iv) land issues and victims’ rights; (v) lessons learned from other peace processes. The event brought together some ninety delegates from Oxford and across the UK, Europe and Colombia. Participants included senior and junior academics, the NGO community, diplomats, analysts from think tanks and development agencies as well as citizens interested in the topic. Panelists included among others Ingrid Betancourt, John Dew, Jorge Orlando Melo, Mauricio Rubio, Markus Schultze-Kraft, Leigh Payne, Henry Patterson and Eduardo Posada-Carbó.
