        "text": "Tokyo 2020 awarded 339 titles. 93 countries took home at least one medal. Botswana, Burkina Faso (Hugues Zango in the men’s Triple Jump won by Pedro Pablo Pichardo), Ivory Coast, Ghana, Granada, Kuwait, Republic of Moldova and Syria, all with bronzes, prop up the bottom of the medals table.\n\nAmong those further up, Portugal ended up alongside Ethiopia in 56th place, 47th in the global ranking from summing up the gold (1), silver (1) and bronze (2).\n\nThe top-3 rankings were taken by two of the usual and a new member on the block.\n\nThe 39 gold medals, 41 silver and 33 bronze, 113 medals in total, placed the United States of America as the top medal winner at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nTopping the medals table is a place that the country with a flag of 50 stars, seven red and six white horizontal stripes knows so very well. At 29 Olympic Games, they have led the way on 18 occasions. From Sydney 2000 to Rio de Janeiro 2016, only in Beijing 2008 did they not sit at the pinnacle of the medals table and knocked off by the host country, the People’s Republic of China.\n\n“The Star-Spangled Banner” was heard 39 times but only one more than China’s national anthem. The Asian state picked up 38 gold, 32 silver and 18 bronze, totalling 88 medals around the necks of its athletes.\n\n“Our team, when it goes to any international competition, wishes to show the strength of China”, pointed out Wang Zhouyu, weightlifting winner (87 kg) reflecting the affirmation regarding the boosting of the sovereignty of China through sport made by Xi Jinping.\n\nThe 27 gold, 14 silver and 15 bronze won by Japanese athletes, 58 in total, placed the hosts on the third step on the podium even while coming in 5th according to the other medal accountancy approach. However, more importantly, the numbers obtained by Japan at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games set their national record and exceeding Athens 2004 (with 16 golds and a total of 37 medals).\n\nPRESIDENT OF THE PORTUGUESE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE\n\nWere you expecting the country’s connection to Tokyo during the early hours?\n\nThere were good results, there was good coverage. With good press coverage, there is good public opinion. One thing drives the other.\n\nFour medals in Tokyo, double that contracted with the government and the institute of sport and youth. What is your overview?\n\nPositive. The objectives established were achieved. The percentages of success were significant. Despite everything, I have to recognise that the expectation in relation to positions on the podium were higher. A percentage for our Mission, 1/3, fell short. Other than that, the great majority, and in some specific cases, exceeded this.\n\nWhen we look at the “Medals Table”, when might Portugal begin thinking about rising a few places within the European context?\n\nWithin the European context, there were 50 countries participating. 40 managed positions on the podium. At the European level, we are at the top of the lower half. In terms of the EU, we are at the bottom of the top half. We shall only be able to do better if we have an attitude of maximising the potentials that the country and its athletes have and, to this end, it is essential that everything aligns: that there is talent, the desire of athletes to make use of their talents and to express themselves at the highest level, that there are human resources qualified to help these athletes and that the general environment, the sport, federation and policies are favourable. If we establish this complementarity between these different actors, success becomes much easier. If not, we may get close but we won’t get there. And this helps explain the 4th and 5th places and not getting into podium positions. What makes the difference are the details.\n\nDo we have more talent nowadays?\n\nIn judo, handball, football, athleticism, canoeing and aquatic sports, we’re getting results we didn’t a decade ago. The competitive profile of Portugal within the international context in the last two decades is incomparably greater than the past in a European context which is distinctive. One thing is having Europe and the USSR. Another is having Russia and 15 other countries that emerged since its breakup. At the Los Angeles Olympic Games, with the USSR boycotting, with three medals, Portugal came in 23rd. This time, Portugal ranked 80th.\n\nWe have infrastructures, public and private investment and the technical component. Is that the secret of the respective sports?\n\nI’m not quite so positive. There is a deficit in the technical qualifications among those working in the youth area where we must raise qualifications. Either you do a good job there or you don’t get the results. I would point to the example of football. The work done with the younger age groups, by Carlos Queirós and Nelo Vingada, the federation and the relationship with the universities, ISEF. Today, we export talent, players, trainers and managers. In other sports, there has been strong investment in child-youth sports, particularly in the qualifications of the human resources involved. For high performance, multidisciplinary teams are needed. This does not boil down to having a trainer. We have both a quantitative and qualitative deficit in the high performance sector. We need people qualified across the areas of physiology, physiotherapy, psychology and anatomy.\n\nAnd is there time to wait?\n\nJust like in football, there is no time. Really, no time at all. Either there is success and this enables some reforms or nobody is willing, not the political powers, public opinion and the media for participation with objectives: our podium positions are those in eight years time. Nobody gives us that amount of time.\n\nWe have to have medium and long term perspectives without missing out on solutions in the present. We have to get results in the present. And to do that, we have to know that there were already stages passed through during training. Now, it is about extracting the maximum returns and adding the pieces that I mentioned.\n\nHow do you perceive the naturalisation of athletes?\n\nWith the same naturalness that I perceived Obikwelu when he won silver (Athens 2004). This is an inevitable process, the mobility of athletes seeking better conditions in their sporting and personal lives. And given the nature of sporting representation, given they represent the states, they should be regulated. So that the demand is curbed on the attractiveness of rich countries over poor countries and, on the other hand, to ensure some dignity to the act of national representation. For the process to be regulated from the civil point of view, by the state and sporting organisations so as to place tighter rules than those currently existing to avoid situations when those who have already represented other countries then migrate.\n\nFrom a broader viewpoint, I always question why this issue is raised in relation to sport and not as regards other cultural activities. How many Portuguese born performers are there in the Gulbenkian ballet or symphony orchestra? Sport always lives out this drama of national representation in being genuinely national when talking about the quality of the performers. Sport has always faced an apartheid type regime in relationship to other social activities. This needs many identity mechanisms and greatly involves recognition due to the connections of those who represent a country having a blood or birth connection with that same country.\n\nMobility is therefore an unavoidable reality today…\n\nMobility is higher than in the past. The federations receive dozens of inquiries by the agents of athletes seeking to be naturalised. We do not have much notion about what is going on but it is happening and there are organised people involved. Therefore, before this becomes a jungle, there is a need regulate to ensure good sense and a proper balance.\n\nWhat were the first Olympic Games that you saw?\n\nI’m already old but not so elderly in terms of watching the Games. I don’t remember: perhaps Munich 72 I think, ever since there was television coverage."
