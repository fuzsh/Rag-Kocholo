However, it is also possible that pericycle founder cells that initiate LRs never cease proliferative activity but rather are displaced to the most distal root zones while undertaking successive stages of LR initiation. In this study, we tested these two alternative hypotheses by examining the incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) into the DNA of meristematic root cells of Zea mays. According to the values for the length of the cell cycle and values for cell displacement along the maize root, our results strongly suggest that pericycle cells that initiate LR primordia ceased proliferative activity upon exiting the meristematic zone. This finding is supported by the existence of a root zone between 4 and 20mm from the root cap junction, in which neither mitotic cells nor labelled nuclei were observed in phloem pericycle cells.

To understand the molecular mechanisms of MC-induced reproductive system cytotoxicity, we evaluated global changes of miRNA and mRNA expression in mouse Sertoli cells following MC-LR treatment. Our results revealed that the exposure to MC-LR resulted in an altered miRNA expression profile that might be responsible for the modulation of mRNA expression. Bio-functional analysis indicated that the altered genes were involved in specific cellular processes, including cell death and proliferation. Target gene analysis suggested that junction injury in Sertoli cells exposed to MC-LR might be mediated by miRNAs through themoreÂ Â» regulation of the Sertoli cell-Sertoli cell pathway. Collectively, these findings may enhance our understanding on the modes of action of MC-LR on mouse Sertoli cells as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of MC-LR on the male reproductive system. - Highlights: â¢ miRNAs were altered in Sertoli cells exposed to MC-LR. â¢ Alerted genes were involved in different cell functions including the cell morphology. â¢ MC-LR adversely affected Sertoli cell junction formation through the regulating miRNAs.Â«Â less\n\nMicrobe-independent entry of oomycete RxLR effectors and fungal RxLR-like effectors into plant and animal cells is specific and reproducible.\n\nPubMed\n\nTyler, Brett M; Kale, Shiv D; Wang, Qunqing; Tao, Kai; Clark, Helen R; Drews, Kelly; Antignani, Vincenzo; Rumore, Amanda; Hayes, Tristan; Plett, Jonathan M; Fudal, Isabelle; Gu, Biao; Chen, Qinghe; Affeldt, Katharyn J; Berthier, Erwin; Fischer, Gregory J; Dou, Daolong; Shan, Weixing; Keller, Nancy P; Martin, Francis; Rouxel, Thierry; Lawrence, Christopher B\n\n2013-06-01\n\nA wide diversity of pathogens and mutualists of plant and animal hosts, including oomycetes and fungi, produce effector proteins that enter the cytoplasm of host cells. A major question has been whether or not entry by these effectors can occur independently of the microbe or requires machinery provided by the microbe. Numerous publications have documented that oomycete RxLR effectors and fungal RxLR-like effectors can enter plant and animal cells independent of the microbe. A recent reexamination of whether the RxLR domain of oomycete RxLR effectors is sufficient for microbe-independent entry into host cells concluded that the RxLR domains of Phytophthora infestans Avr3a and of P. sojae Avr1b alone are NOT sufficient to enable microbe-independent entry of proteins into host and nonhost plant and animal cells. Here, we present new, more detailed data that unambiguously demonstrate that the RxLR domain of Avr1b does show efficient and specific entry into soybean root cells and also into wheat leaf cells, at levels well above background nonspecific entry. We also summarize host cell entry experiments with a wide diversity of oomycete and fungal effectors with RxLR or RxLR-like motifs that have been independently carried out by the seven different labs that coauthored this letter. Finally we discuss possible technical reasons why specific cell entry may have been not detected by Wawra et al. (2013).\n\nCharacterization of in vitro effects of microcystin-LR on intestinal epithelial cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Yuan; Xu, Xiaoping; Yu, Beibei; Yu, Guang\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe intestinal epithelium is a single-cell layer that provides an important barrier against natural toxins. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a cyclic heptapeptide, is one of the best known toxins able to alter the functions of intestine. This study evaluated the toxic effects and the possible mechanisms of MC-LR on barrier function of the intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) were exposed to 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 Î¼M MC-LR. Cell viability significantly decreased, while the ratio of apoptotic cells increased after exposure to 12.5Î¼M and higer concentration of MC-LR. As expected, the integrity of a polarized IEC-6 monolayer was affected by MC-LR exposure, as demonstrated by a decrease in the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values, becoming most pronounced at 50Î¼M, 24 h. No effects were detected on the protein expression levels of the tight junction protein claudin at 50Î¼M. However, the expression of occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) declined. Furthermore, MC-LR can immigrate into IEC-6 cells. The activity of protein phosphatases 2A (PP2A) decreased from the concentration of 12.5 Î¼M, showing a dose-dependent decline. These results provide new information that strengthens the concept that the intestinal epithelium is important targets for toxic effects of water contaminants like MC-LR.

To a large extent, this adaptability depends on their ability to initiate and form new organs throughout their entire postembryonic life. Plant shoot and root systems unceasingly branch and form axillary shoots or lateral roots, respectively. The first event in the formation of a new organ is specification of founder cells. Several plant hormones, prominent among them auxin, have been implicated in the acquisition of founder cell identity by differentiated cells, but the mechanisms underlying this process are largely elusive. Here, we show that auxin and its local accumulation in root pericycle cells is a necessary and sufficient signal to respecify these cells into lateral root founder cells. Analysis of the alf4â1 mutant suggests that specification of founder cells and the subsequent activation of cell division leading to primordium formation represent two genetically separable events. Time-lapse experiments show that the activation of an auxin response is the earliest detectable event in founder cell specification. Accordingly, local activation of auxin response correlates absolutely with the acquisition of founder cell identity and precedes the actual formation of a lateral root primordium through patterned cell division. Local production and subsequent accumulation of auxin in single pericycle cells induced by Cre-Lox-based activation of auxin synthesis converts them into founder cells. Thus, auxin is the local instructive signal that is sufficient for acquisition of founder cell identity and can be considered a morphogenetic trigger in postembryonic plant organogenesis.

Vascular endothelial cell apoptosis has been implicated in the pathophysiology and progression of atherosclerosis. We investigated whether the advanced glycation end-product inhibitor LR-90 could prevent MGO-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were pre-treated with LR-90 and then stimulated with MGO. Cell morphology, cytotoxicity and apoptosis were evaluated by light microscopy, MTT assay, and Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide double staining, respectively. Levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome c, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and caspase activities were assessed by Western blotting. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured with fluorescent probes. LR-90 dose-dependently prevented MGO-associated HUVEC cytotoxicity and apoptotic biochemical changes such as loss of MMP, increased Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3 and 9. Additionally, LR-90 blocked intracellular ROS formation and MAPK (p44/p42, p38, JNK) activation, though the latter seem to be not directly involved in MGO-induced HUVEC apoptosis. LR-90 prevents MGO-induced HUVEC apoptosis by inhibiting ROS and associated mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic signaling cascades, suggesting that LR-90 possess cytoprotective ability which could be beneficial in prevention of diabetic related-atherosclerosis.

Previous studies have demonstrated that exposure to MC-LR impairs pancreatic islet function, however, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. In the present study, we explored the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) impairment in Î²-cell dysfunction caused by MC-LR. The result showed that MC-LR modified ER morphology evidenced by increased ER amount and size at low doses (15, 30 or 60Â Î¼M) and vacuolar and dilated ER ultrastructure at high doses (100 or 200Â Î¼M). Also, insulin content showed increased at 15 or 30Â Î¼M but declined at 60, 100, or 200Â Î¼M, which was highly accordant with ER morphological alteration. Transcriptomic analysis identified a number of factors and several pathways associated with ER protein processing, ER stress, apoptosis, and diabetes mellitus in the cells treated with MC-LR compared with non-treated cells. Furthermore, MC-LR-induced ER stress significantly promoted the expression of PERK/eIF2Î± and their downstream targets (ATF4, CHOP, and Gadd34), which indicates that PERK-eIF2Î±-ATF4 pathway is involved in MC-LR-induced insulin deficiency. These results suggest that ER impairment is an important contributor to MC-LR-caused Î²-cell failure and provide a new insight into the association between MCs contamination and the occurrence of human diseases.

Studies performed in rat Sertoli cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells have demonstrated typical apoptosis after MC-LR exposure. However, little is known on how to protect against the reproductive toxicity induced by MC-LR. The present study aimed to explore the possible molecular mechanism underlying the anti-apoptosis and protective effects of resveratrol (RES) on the co-culture of Sertoliâ»germ cells and rat testes. The results demonstrated that MC-LR treatment inhibited the proliferation of Sertoliâ»germ cells and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and Bcl-2 were inhibited, while p53 and Ku70 acetylation, Bax expression, and cleaved caspase-3 were upregulated by MC-LR. However, RES pretreatment ameliorated MC-LR-induced apoptosis and SIRT1 inhibition, and downregulated the MC-LR-induced increase in p53 and Ku70 acetylation, Bax expression, and caspase-3 activation. In addition, RES reversed the MC-LR-mediated reduction in Ku70 binding to Bax. The present study indicated that the administration of RES could ameliorate MC-LR-induced Sertoliâ»germ cell apoptosis and protect against reproductive toxicity in rats by stimulating the SIRT1/p53 pathway, suppressing p53 and Ku70 acetylation and enhancing the binding of Ku70 to Bax.\n\nAnti-LRP/LR Specific Antibody IgG1-iS18 Impedes Adhesion and Invasion of Liver Cancer Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChetty, Carryn; Khumalo, Thandokuhle; Da Costa Dias, Bianca; Reusch, Uwe; Knackmuss, Stefan; Little, Melvyn; Weiss, Stefan F. T.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTwo key events, namely adhesion and invasion, are pivotal to the occurrence of metastasis. Importantly, the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) has been implicated in enhancing these two events thus facilitating cancer progression. In the current study, the role of LRP/LR in the adhesion and invasion of liver cancer (HUH-7) and leukaemia (K562) cells was investigated. Flow cytometry revealed that the HUH-7 cells displayed significantly higher cell surface LRP/LR levels compared to the poorly-invasive breast cancer (MCF-7) control cells, whilst the K562 cells displayed significantly lower cell surface LRP/LR levels in comparison to the MCF-7 control cells. However, Western blotting and densitometric analysis revealed that all three tumorigenic cell lines did not differ significantly with regards to total LRP/LR levels. Furthermore, treatment of liver cancer cells with anti-LRP/LR specific antibody IgG1-iS18 (0.2 mg/ml) significantly reduced the adhesive potential of cells to laminin-1 and the invasive potential of cells through the ECM-like Matrigel, whilst leukaemia cells showed no significant differences in both instances. Additionally, Pearson's correlation coefficients suggested direct proportionality between cell surface LRP/LR levels and the adhesive and invasive potential of liver cancer and leukaemia cells. These findings suggest the potential use of anti-LRP/LR specific antibody IgG1-iS18 as an alternative therapeutic tool for metastatic liver cancer through impediment of the LRP/LR- laminin-1 interaction.

We have combined fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA-seq to characterise the cell-type-specific transcriptome at the earliest developmental time-point of lateral organ formation using DORNRÃSCHEN-LIKE::GFP to mark founder-cell populations at the periphery of the inflorescence meristem (IM) in apetala1 cauliflower double mutants, which overproliferate IMs. Within the lateral organ founder-cell population at the inflorescence meristem, floral primordium identity genes are upregulated and stem-cell identity markers are downregulated. Additional differentially expressed transcripts are involved in polarity generation and boundary formation, and in epigenetic and post-translational changes. However, only subtle transcriptional reprogramming within the global auxin network was observed. The transcriptional network of differentially expressed genes supports the hypothesis that lateral organ founder-cell specification involves the creation of polarity from the centre to the periphery of the IM and the establishment of a boundary from surrounding cells, consistent with bract initiation. However, contrary to the established paradigm that sites of auxin response maxima pre-pattern lateral organ initiation in the IM, auxin response might play a minor role in the earliest stages of lateral floral initiation.\n\nRegistration of spring wheat sources of the resistance genes Lr53, Lr56, Lr59 and Lr62\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nSpring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasm with the alien derived leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Erikss) resistance genes, Lr53, Lr56, Lr59, and Lr62 has been developed with infrastructure and financial support provided consecutively by the University of Stellenbosch (South Africa), the ...\n\nAbundant and equipotent founder cells establish and maintain acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nElder, A; Bomken, S; Wilson, I; Blair, H J; Cockell, S; Ponthan, F; Dormon, K; Pal, D; Heidenreich, O; Vormoor, J\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHigh frequencies of blasts in primary acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) samples have the potential to induce leukaemia and to engraft mice. However, it is unclear how individual ALL cells each contribute to drive leukaemic development in a bulk transplant and the extent to which these blasts vary functionally. We used cellular barcoding as a fate mapping tool to track primograft ALL blasts in vivo. Our results show that high numbers of ALL founder cells contribute at similar frequencies to leukaemic propagation over serial transplants, without any clear evidence of clonal succession. These founder cells also exhibit equal capacity to home and engraft to different organs, although stochastic processes may alter the composition in restrictive niches. Our findings enhance the stochastic stem cell model of ALL by demonstrating equal functional abilities of singular ALL blasts and show that successful treatment strategies must eradicate the entire leukaemic cell population.\n\nCell density dependence of Microcystis aeruginosa responses to copper algaecide concentrations: Implications for microcystin-LR release.\n\nPubMed\n\nKinley, Ciera M; Iwinski, Kyla J; Hendrikse, Maas; Geer, Tyler D; Rodgers, John H\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAlong with mechanistic models, predictions of exposure-response relationships for copper are often derived from laboratory toxicity experiments with standardized experimental exposures and conditions. For predictions of copper toxicity to algae, cell density is a critical factor often overlooked. For pulse exposures of copper-based algaecides in aquatic systems, cell density can significantly influence copper sorbed by the algal population, and consequent responses. A cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, was exposed to a copper-based algaecide over a range of cell densities to model the density-dependence of exposures, and effects on microcystin-LR (MC-LR) release. Copper exposure concentrations were arrayed to result in a gradient of MC-LR release, and masses of copper sorbed to algal populations were measured following exposures. While copper exposure concentrations eliciting comparable MC-LR release ranged an order of magnitude (24-h EC50s 0.03-0.3mg Cu/L) among cell densities of 10 6 through 10 7 cells/mL, copper doses (mg Cu/mg algae) were similar (24-h EC50s 0.005-0.006mg Cu/mg algae). Comparisons of MC-LR release as a function of copper exposure concentrations and doses provided a metric of the density dependence of algal responses in the context of copper-based algaecide applications. Combined with estimates of other site-specific factors (e.g. water characteristics) and fate processes (e.g. dilution and dispersion, sorption to organic matter and sediments), measuring exposure-response relationships for specific cell densities can refine predictions for in situ exposures and algal responses. These measurements can in turn decrease the likelihood of amending unnecessary copper concentrations to aquatic systems, and minimize risks for non-target aquatic organisms.

The ability of 37/67 LR to promote cancer cell aggressiveness is further increased by its ability to transduce physiochemical and mechanosensing signals in endothelial cells and modulate angiogenesis. Recently, it was demonstrated that 37/67 LR modulates the anti-angiogenic potential of the secreted glycoprotein pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Restoration of PEDF balance is a desirable therapeutic outcome, and we sought to identify a small molecule that could recapitulate known signaling properties of PEDF but without the additional complications of peptide formulation or gene delivery safety validation. We used an in silico drug discovery approach to target the interaction interface between PEDF and 37 LR. Following cell based counter screening and binding validation, we characterized a hit compound's anti-viability, activation of PEDF signaling-related genes, anti-wound healing, and anti-cancer signaling properties. This hit compound has potential for future development as a lead compound for treating tumor growth and inhibiting angiogenesis.\n\nOrg-1 is required for the diversification of circular visceral muscle founder cells and normal midgut morphogenesis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchaub, Christoph; Frasch, Manfred\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe T-Box family of transcription factors plays fundamental roles in the generation of appropriate spatial and temporal gene expression profiles during cellular differentiation and organogenesis in animals. In this study we report that the Drosophila Tbx1 orthologue optomotor-blind-related-gene-1 (org-1) exerts a pivotal function in the diversification of circular visceral muscle founder cell identities in Drosophila. In embryos mutant for org-1, the specification of the midgut musculature per se is not affected, but the differentiating midgut fails to form the anterior and central midgut constrictions and lacks the gastric caeca. We demonstrate that this phenotype results from the nearly complete loss of the founder cell specific expression domains of several genes known to regulate midgut morphogenesis, including odd-paired (opa), teashirt (tsh), Ultrabithorax (Ubx), decapentaplegic (dpp) and wingless (wg). To address the mechanisms that mediate the regulatory inputs from org-1 towards Ubx, dpp, and wg in these founder cells we genetically dissected known visceral mesoderm specific cis-regulatory-modules (CRMs) of these genes. The analyses revealed that the activities of the dpp and wg CRMs depend on org-1, the CRMs are bound by Org-1 in vivo and their T-Box binding sites are essential for their activation in the visceral muscle founder cells. We conclude that Org-1 acts within a well-defined signaling and transcriptional network of the trunk visceral mesoderm as a crucial founder cell-specific competence factor, in concert with the general visceral mesodermal factor Biniou. As such, it directly regulates several key genes involved in the establishment of morphogenetic centers along the anteroposterior axis of the visceral mesoderm, which subsequently organize the formation of midgut constrictions and gastric caeca and thereby determine the morphology of the midgut.

In the embryo, founders are selected by Notch-mediated lateral inhibition, while during adult myogenesis this mechanism of selection does not appear to operate. We show, in the muscles of the adult abdomen, that the Fibroblast growth factor pathway mediates founder cell choice in a novel manner. We suggest that the developmental patterns of Heartbroken/Dof and Sprouty result in defining the domain and timing of activation of the Fibroblast growth factor receptor Heartless in specific myoblasts, thereby converting them into founder cells. Our results point to a way in which muscle differentiation could be initiated and define a critical developmental function for Heartbroken/Dof in myogenesis.

In this study, divalent cations and release of intracellular potassium were used to assess the mechanism of interaction and killing of enterocin LR/6 produced by Enterococcus faecium LR/6 on three target Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, namely Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus sp. strain LR/3 and Escherichia coli K-12. Whilst treatment with enterocin LR/6 in all cases led to a significant loss of viability, suggesting a bactericidal mode of action, E. coli K-12 showed better tolerance than the other two strains. Bacteriocins have generally been reported to create pores in the membrane of sensitive cells and this function is diminished by divalent cations. In this study it was shown that Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) markedly improved the viability of enterocin LR/6-treated cells in a concentration-dependent manner. K(+) release as a sign of membrane leakiness was higher in M. luteus compared with the other two test strains. In agreement with the viability response, pre-exposure to Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) substantially reduced the amount of K(+) leakage by M. luteus and Enterococcus sp.; in the case of E. coli K-12, no leakage of K(+) was recorded. These results suggest that enterocin LR/6, which possesses good antibacterial potential, may not be very effective as a preservative in foods containing high concentrations of calcium and magnesium.

It is also thought that microcystin-LR induces reactive oxygen species (ROS). We tried to establish the chemical prevention of microcystin-LR poisoning. We investigated the effect of grapefruit flavanone glycoside naringin on cytotoxicity of microcystin-LR using human hepatocyte uptake transporter OATP1B3-expressing HEK293-OATP1B3 cells. We found cytotoxicity of microcystin-LR was attenuated by naringin in a dose dependent manner. The inhibition magnitude of total cellular serine/threonine protein phosphatase activity induced by microcystin-LR was suppressed by naringin. In addition, uptake of microcystin-LR into HEK293-OATP1B3 cells was inhibited by naringin. Furthermore, microcystin-LR induced phosphorylation of p53 was inhibited by naringin. Regardless of the difference in the exposure pattern of pre-processing and post-processing of naringin, the toxicity of microcystin-LR was comparable. These results suggested that naringin is promising remedy as well as preventive medicine for liver damage with microcystin-LR. In addition, involvement of ROS production after exposure to the sublethal concentrations of microcystin-LR in the onset of cytotoxicity was negligible. Therefore, inhibition of microcystin-LR uptake and the pathway other than ROS production would be involved in the effect of naringin on the attenuation of microcystin-LR toxicity.

In this investigation, we have focused on L. monocytogenes as the target organism, as it is not only an important pathogen but can also survive over a wide range of environmental conditions such as refrigeration temperature, low pH, and high-salt concentration. This allows the pathogen to overcome many food preservation and safety barriers and poses a potential risk to human health. The enterocin LR/6 showed a bactericidal action against L. monocytogenes and completely inhibited the growth on agar plates, supplemented with 200 AU/ml of enterocin LR/6. The effectiveness of enterocin LR/6 in completely killing a population of acid-adapted (pH 5.2, 2 h) L. monocytogenes exposed to different temperatures (4-37 degrees C), pH (2.5-8.0), and osmotic (up to 30% NaCl) stress is reported here. This paper focuses on the key issue of killing of the acid-adapted L. monocytogenes cells under adverse environmental conditions.\n\nsiRNA - Mediated LRP/LR knock-down reduces cellular viability of malignant melanoma cells through the activation of apoptotic caspases.\n\nPubMed\n\nRebelo, Thalia M; Vania, Leila; Ferreira, Eloise; Weiss, Stefan F T\n\n2018-07-01\n\nThe 37â¯kDa/67â¯kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) is over-expressed in tumor cells and has been implicated in several tumourigenic processes such as metastasis and telomerase activation, however, more importantly the focus of the present study is on the maintenance of cellular viability and the evasion of apoptosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of LRP/LR on the cellular viability of early (A375) and late stage (A375SM) malignant melanoma cells. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis revealed that A375SM cells contain more cell-surface and total LRP/LR levels in comparison to the A375 cells, respectively. In order to determine the effect of LRP/LR on cell viability and apoptosis, LRP was down-regulated via siRNA technology. MTT assays revealed that LRP knock-down led to significant reductions in the viability of A375 and A375SM cells. Confocal microscopy indicated nuclear morphological changes suggestive of apoptotic induction in both cell lines and Annexin-V FITC/PI assays confirmed this observation. Additionally, caspase-3 activity assays revealed that apoptosis was induced in both cell lines after siRNA-mediated down-regulation of LRP. Caspase-8 and -9 activity assays suggested that post LRP knock-down; A375 cells undergo apoptosis solely via the extrinsic pathway, while A375SM cells undergo apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. siRNAs mediated LRP knock-down might represent a powerful alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of malignant melanoma through the induction of apoptosis.

Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were fed dietary Microcystin-LR (0, 0.46, 0.85, 2.01 and 3.93 microg MC-LR/g dry diet for 8 weeks at 25 degrees C. The results revealed that dietary MC-LR inhibited growth at the end of 8 weeks. The survival of embryos and the RNA/DNA ratio of whole fish decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in fish fed 3.93 microg MC-LR/g dry diet. Heat shock protein (Hsp60) expression was induced in the liver of female and male fish fed diets containing > or =0.85 and 0.46 microg MC-LR/g diet, respectively. The activity of liver caspase 3/7 was significantly higher in female fish fed 3.93 microg MC-LR/g diet and in males fed 2.01 MC-LR microg/g dry diet than fish fed the control diet. The threshold for inhibition of liver protein phosphatase expression was lower in female (2.01 microg/g diet) than that in male fish (3.93 microg/g diet). Histopathological examination showed significant single-cell necrosis in female and male medaka fed diets containing 0.85 and 3.93 microg MC-LR/g diet, respectively. Based on different biomarkers, this study demonstrated that dietary MC-LR is toxic to Medaka and the effects are gender dependent.

Strasburger raised many problems which are hot spots in recent plant cell biology, e.g., structure and function of the plasmodesmata in relation to phloem loading (Strasburger cells) and signaling, mechanisms of cell plate formation, vesicle trafficking as a basis for most important developmental processes, and signaling related to fertilization.\n\nThe founder's dilemma.\n\nPubMed\n\nWasserman, Noam\n\n2008-02-01\n\nWhy do people start businesses? For the money and the chance to control their own companies, certainly. But new research from Harvard Business School professor Wasserman shows that those goals are largely incompatible. The author's studies indicate that a founder who gives up more equity to attract cofounders, new hires, and investors builds a more valuable company than one who parts with less equity. More often than not, however, those superior returns come from replacing the founder with a professional CEO more experienced with the needs of a growing company. This fundamental tension requires founders to make \"rich\" versus \"king\" trade-offs to maximize either their wealth or their control over the company. Founders seeking to remain in control (as John Gabbert of the furniture retailer Room & Board has done) would do well to restrict themselves to businesses where large amounts of capital aren't required and where they already have the skills and contacts they need. They may also want to wait until late in their careers, after they have developed broader management skills, before setting up shop. Entrepreneurs who focus on wealth, such as Jim Triandiflou, who founded Ockham Technologies, can make the leap sooner because they won't mind taking money from investors or depending on executives to manage their ventures. Such founders will often bring in new CEOs themselves and be more likely to work with their boards to develop new, post-succession roles for themselves. Choosing between money and power allows entrepreneurs to come to grips with what success means to them. Founders who want to manage empires will not believe they are successes if they lose control, even if they end up rich. Conversely, founders who understand that their goal is to amass wealth will not view themselves as failures when they step down from the top job.\n\nPlasma membrane microorganization of LR73 multidrug-resistant cells revealed by FCS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWinckler, Pascale; Jaffiol, Rodolphe; Cailler, AurÃ©lie; Morjani, Hamid; Jeannesson, Pierre; Deturche, RÃ©gis\n\n2011-03-01\n\nTumoral cells could present a multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapeutic treatments. This drug resistance would be associated to biomechanisms occurring at the plasma membrane level, involving modification of membrane fluidity, drug permeability, presence of microdomains (rafts, caveolae...), and membrane proteins overexpression such as Pglycoprotein. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is the relevant method to investigate locally the fluidity of biological membranes through the lateral diffusion of a fluorescent membrane probe. Thus, we use FCS to monitor the plasma membrane local organization of LR73 carcinoma cells and three derived multidrug-resistant cancer cells lines. Measurements were conducted at the single cell level, which enabled us to get a detailed overview of the plasma membrane microviscosity distribution of each cell line studied. Moreover, we propose 2D diffusion simulation based on a Monte Carlo model to investigate the membrane organisation in terms of microdomains. This simulation allows us to relate the differences in the fluidity distributions with microorganization changes in plasma membrane of MDR cells.\n\nPhytophthora parasitica Effector PpRxLR2 Suppresses Nicotiana benthamiana Immunity.\n\nPubMed\n\nDalio, R J D; Maximo, H J; Oliveira, T S; Dias, R O; Breton, M C; Felizatti, H; Machado, M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPhytophthora species secrete several classes of effector proteins during interaction with their hosts. These proteins can have multiple functions including modulation of host physiology and immunity. The RxLR effectors have the ability to enter plant cells using the plant machinery. Some of these effectors have been characterized as immunity suppressors; however, very little is known about their functions in the interaction between Phytophthora parasitica and its hosts. Using a bioinformatics pipeline, we have identified 172 candidate RxLR effectors (CREs) in the isolate IAC 01_95 of P. parasitica. Of these 172 CREs, 93 were found to be also present in eight other genomes of P. parasitica, isolated from different hosts and continents. After transcriptomics and gene expression analysis, we have found five CREs to be up-regulated in in-vitro and in-planta samples. Subsequently, we selected three CREs for functional characterization in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. We show that PpRxLR2 is able to completely suppress INF-1-induced cell death, whereas PpRxLR3 and PpRxLR5 moderately suppressed N. benthamiana immunity in a less-extensive manner. Moreover, we confirmed the effector-triggered susceptibility activity of these proteins after transient transformation and infection of N. benthamiana plants. All three CREs enhanced virulence of P. parasitica during the interaction with N. benthamiana. These effectors, in particular PpRxLR2, can be targeted for the development of biotechnology-based control strategies of P. parasitica diseases.\n\nBreast cancer risk is similar for CHEK2 founder and non-founder mutation carriers.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeedom, Tracey P; LaDuca, Holly; McFarland, Rachel; Li, Shuwei; Dolinsky, Jill S; Chao, Elizabeth C\n\n2016-09-01\n\nCHEK2 mutations are associated with increased cancer risks, including breast; however, published risk estimates are limited to those conferred by CHEK2 founder mutations, presenting uncertainty in risk assessment for carriers of other CHEK2 mutations. This study aimed to assess phenotypes and molecular characteristics of CHEK2 mutation carriers (CHEK2â+âs) from a multi-gene panel testing (MGPT) cohort, focusing on comparing phenotypes of founder and non-founder CHEK2â+âs. Clinical histories and molecular results were reviewed from 45,879 patients who underwent MGPT including CHEK2 at a commercial laboratory. Of individuals tested, 2.4% (nâ=â1085) were CHEK2â+âs. Sixteen individuals harbored biallelic CHEK2 mutations, bringing the total number of CHEK2 mutations detected in this cohort to 1101. Personal/family cancer histories were compared between founder (nâ=â576; included c.1100delC, p.S428F, c.444â+â1Gâ>âA, and EX8_9del) and non-founder (nâ=â259) CHEK2â+âs using Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Individuals carrying the p.I157T moderate risk founder mutation (nâ=â231), additional mutations in non-CHEK2 genes (nâ=â83), or biallelic mutations (nâ=â16) were excluded from phenotype analysis, as were cases with no clinical information provided. No significant phenotypic differences were observed between founder and non-founder CHEK2â+âs. These data suggest that cancer risks reported for founder mutations may be generalizable to all CHEK2â+âs, particularly for breast cancer. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors.

The most commonly encountered form of microcystin is microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Humans are exposed to MC-LR by drinking contaminated water. The toxin accumulates rapidly in the liver where it exerts most of its damage. Treatment of water containing MC-LR by ultrasonic irradiation leads to the breakdown of the toxin. Both the parent toxin and the treated toxin reaction products (TTRP) were evaluated for toxic effects in mice. Animals were exposed to purified MC-LR or an equivalent dose of the TTRP and sacrificed aftermoreÂ Â» 4 h or 24 h. Serum was collected and assayed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity as an indicator of hepatotoxicity. LDH activity was detected in the serum of MC-LR exposed mice indicative of liver damage, but not in control mice. Only a fraction of that activity was detectable in mice exposed to TTRP. Liver RNA was used for microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Individual animals varied in their overall genomic response to the toxin; however, only 20 genes showed consistent changes in expression. These include chaperones which may be part of a generalized stress response; cytochrome P450 which may be involved in metabolizing the toxin; and lipid dystrophy genes such as lipin-2, uridine phosphorylase and a homolog to tribbles, a stress-inducible gene involved in cell death. Of the genes that responded to the MC-LR, none showed significant changes in expression profile in response to TTRP. Taken together, the data indicate that ultrasonic irradiation of MC-LR effectively reduces hepatotoxicity in mice and therefore may be a useful method for detoxification of drinking water.Â«Â less\n\nRole of founder cell deficit and delayed neuronogenesis in microencephaly of the trisomy 16 mouse\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHaydar, T. F.; Nowakowski, R. S.; Yarowsky, P. J.; Krueger, B. K.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nDevelopment of the neocortex of the trisomy 16 (Ts16) mouse, an animal model of Down syndrome (DS), is characterized by a transient delay in the radial expansion of the cortical wall and a persistent reduction in cortical volume. Here we show that at each cell cycle during neuronogenesis, a smaller proportion of Ts16 progenitors exit the cell cycle than do control, euploid progenitors. In addition, the cell cycle duration was found to be longer in Ts16 than in euploid progenitors, the Ts16 growth fraction was reduced, and an increase in apoptosis was observed in both proliferative and postmitotic zones of the developing Ts16 neocortical wall. Incorporation of these changes into a model of neuronogenesis indicates that they are sufficient to account for the observed delay in radial expansion. In addition, the number of neocortical founder cells, i.e., precursors present just before neuronogenesis begins, is reduced by 26% in Ts16 mice, leading to a reduction in overall cortical size at the end of Ts16 neuronogenesis. Thus, altered proliferative characteristics during Ts16 neuronogenesis result in a delay in the generation of neocortical neurons, whereas the founder cell deficit leads to a proportional reduction in the overall number of neurons. Such prenatal perturbations in either the timing of neuron generation or the final number of neurons produced may lead to significant neocortical abnormalities such as those found in DS.\n\nDiversity and convergence in the mechanisms establishing L/R asymmetry in metazoa\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCoutelis, Jean-Baptiste; GonzÃ¡lez-Morales, Nicanor; GÃ©minard, Charles; Noselli, StÃ©phane\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDifferentiating left and right hand sides during embryogenesis represents a major event in body patterning. LeftâRight (L/R) asymmetry in bilateria is essential for handed positioning, morphogenesis and ultimately the function of organs (including the brain), with defective L/R asymmetry leading to severe pathologies in human. How and when symmetry is initially broken during embryogenesis remains debated and is a major focus in the field. Work done over the past 20 years, in both vertebrate and invertebrate models, has revealed a number of distinct pathways and mechanisms important for establishing L/R asymmetry and for spreading it to tissues and organs. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge and discuss the diversity of L/R patterning from cells to organs during evolution.

One group of these effectors are the RxLR effectors for which it has been shown, in a few cases, that the RxLR motif is important for their translocation. It has been suggested that the RxLR-leader sequences alone are enough to translocate the respective effectors into eukaryotic cells through binding to surface-exposed phosphoinositol-3-phosphate. These conclusions were primary based on translocation experiments conducted with recombinant fusion proteins whereby the RxLR leader of RxLR effectors (i.e., Avr1b from Phytophthora sojae) were fused to the green fluorescent protein reporter-protein. However, we failed to observe specific cellular uptake for a comparable fusion protein where the RxLR leader of the P. infestans AVR3a was fused to monomeric red fluorescent protein. Therefore, we reexamined the ability of the reported P. sojae AVR1b RxLR leader to enter eukaryotic cells. Different relevant experiments were performed in three independent laboratories, using fluorescent reporter fusion constructs of AVR3a and Avr1b proteins in a side-by-side comparative study on plant tissue and human and animal cells. We report that we were unable to obtain conclusive evidence for specific RxLR-mediated translocation.\n\nLevels of soluble LR11/SorLA are highly increased in the bile of patients with biliary tract and pancreatic cancers.\n\nPubMed\n\nTerai, Kensuke; Jiang, Meizi; Tokuyama, Wataru; Murano, Takeyoshi; Takada, Nobuo; Fujimura, Kengo; Ebinuma, Hiroyuki; Kishimoto, Toshihiko; Hiruta, Nobuyuki; Schneider, Wolfgang J; Bujo, Hideaki\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThe utility of molecules derived from cancer cells as biomarkers of the pathological status in biliary tract and pancreatic cancers is still limited. Soluble LDL receptor relative with 11 ligand-binding repeats (sLR11), a molecule released from immature cells, has been shown to be a circulating biomarker for early stage hematological malignancies. We have evaluated the pathological significance of bile sLR11 levels in 147 samples from 72 patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC), pancreatic cancer (PC), or benign diseases. The bile sLR11 levels in the cancer patients were significantly increased compared with those in patients without cancer, independent of cytological detection of cancer cells in bile. The average bile sLR11 levels in cancer patients were significantly higher than in those with benign diseases, while levels of bile carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were not different. LR11 protein was found to be highly expressed in the BTC and PC cells. The LR11 transcript levels in cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer cell lines were sharply induced during proliferation and significantly increased under hypoxic conditions. Therefore, sLR11 levels in bile may be indicative of cancer cell conditions and may serve as potential novel biomarker in patients with BTC and PC. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In Drosophila, the FGF8-like ligands Pyramus (Pyr) and Thisbe (Ths), which signal through their receptor Heartless (Htl), are known to regulate early mesodermal cell migration after gastrulation as well as glial cell migration during eye development. Herein, we show that Pyr and Ths also exert key roles during the long-distance migration of a specific sub-population of mesodermal cells that migrate from the caudal visceral mesoderm within stereotypic bilateral paths along the trunk visceral mesoderm toward the anterior. These cells constitute the founder myoblasts of the longitudinal midgut muscles. In a forward genetic screen for regulators of this morphogenetic process we identified loss of function alleles for pyr. We show that pyr and ths are expressed along the paths of migration in the trunk visceral mesoderm and endoderm and act largely redundantly to help guide the founder myoblasts reliably onto and along their substrate of migration. Ectopically-provided Pyr and Ths signals can efficiently re-rout the migrating cells, both in the presence and absence of endogenous signals. Our data indicate that the guidance functions of these FGFs must act in concert with other important attractive or adhesive activities of the trunk visceral mesoderm. Apart from their guidance functions, the Pyr and Ths signals play an obligatory role for the survival of the migrating cells. Without these signals, essentially all of these cells enter cell death and detach from the migration substrate during early migration. We present experiments that allowed us to dissect the roles of these FGFs as guidance cues versus trophic activities during the migration of the longitudinal visceral muscle founders.

Garcia\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThis paper presents a new algorithm to compute the exact list of tokens expected by any LR syntax analyzer at any point of the scanning process. The lexer can, at any time, compute the exact list of valid tokens to return only tokens in this set. In the case than more than one matching token is in the valid set, the lexer can resort to a nested LR parser to disambiguate. Allowing nested LR parsing requires some slight modifications when building the LR parsing tables. We also show how LR parsers can parse conflictive and inherently ambiguous languages using a combination of nested parsing and context aware scanning. These expanded lexical analyzers can be generated from high level specifications.\n\nNew insights into cytotoxicity induced by microcystin-LR, estradiol, and ractopamine with mathematical models: Individual and combined effects.\n\nPubMed\n\nMa, Min; Pi, Fuwei; Wang, Jiasheng; Ji, Jian; Sun, Xiulan\n\n2017-02-01\n\nHumans are most likely to be exposed to microcystins (MCs) combined with other water pollutants rather than to individual compounds through the consumption of contaminated drinking water or through recreational activities, such as swimming. However, the combined effects of MC-LR, estradiol (EST), and ractopamine (RAC) have not been extensively researched. The goal of this study was to investigate the combined effects of these compounds. For this purpose, cytotoxicity was evaluated in HepG2 cells treated with single or combined doses of MC-LR, EST, and RAC based on concentration addition (CA), independent action (IA), and Chou-Talalay's combination-index (CI) methods. Singly applied MC-LR and EST induced HepG2 cellular proliferation at low-concentration levels (1Â ÃÂ 10 -12 -1Â ÃÂ 10 -9 Â M), and decreased viability at higher doses of exposure (1Â ÃÂ 10 -9 -1Â ÃÂ 10 -6 Â M). Exposure to binary or ternary mixtures of MC-LR, EST, and RAC exhibited synergistic effects at high concentrations, irrespective of the models used. In contrast, antagonism was observed for the mixture of MC-LR and EST at relatively low concentrations. A synergistic effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was observed for the combined drugs at high concentrations. Additionally, the ratio of apoptotic cells was increased more by the combined drugs than the single drugs, consistent with the inhibition of cell viability. The ROS increase after treatment with the combined drugs may enhance cytotoxicity and subsequently lead to cell apoptosis. Given the interactions between MC-LR, EST, and RAC, government regulatory standards for MC-LR should consider the toxicological interactions between MC-LR and other environment pollutions.

Pregnant females were distributed into two experimental groups: control group and MC-LR group which were exposed to 0 and 10Â Î¼g/L of MC-LR, respectively, through drinking water separately during fetal and lactational periods. At the age of 30 days after birth, the male offspring were euthanized. The body weight, testis index, and histomorphology change were observed and the global changes of piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) expression were evaluated. The results revealed that MC-LR was found in the testis of male offspring, body weight and testis index decreased significantly, and testicular tissue structure was damaged in the MC-LR group. In addition, the exposure to MC-LR resulted in an altered piRNA expression profile and an increase of the cell apoptosis and a decrease of the cell proliferation in the testis of the male offspring. It was reasonable to speculate that the toxic effects on reproductive system of the male offspring in MC-LR group might be mediated by piRNAs through the regulation of the target genes. As far as we are aware, this is the first report showing that MC-LR could play a role in disorder of proliferative and cell apoptosis in the testis of the male offspring by the maternal transmission effect of toxicity.

To document the effects of long-term, low-dose MC-LR exposure on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in mice with healthy and diseased livers. Male CD1 mice (N = 20/group) were exposed to 1.0 Î¼g/L of MC-LR in drinking water; 1.0 Î¼g/L MC-LR plus 300 mg/L of the hepatotoxin thioacetamide (MC-LR/TAA); or 300 mg/L TAA alone for 28 weeks. Liver biochemistry and histology were documented at the end of the study period. In addition, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), were exposed in vitro to MC-LR (0.1-10,000 Î¼g/L) and monitored for changes in cell metabolism, proliferation and activation. Liver biochemistry and histology were essentially normal in MC-LR alone exposed mice. MC-LR/TAA and TAA alone exposed mice had significant hepatic inflammation and fibrosis but the extent of the changes were similar in the two groups. In vitro, MC-LR had no effect on HSC metabolism, proliferation or activation. Long-term, low-dose exposure to MC-LR is unlikely to lead to chronic liver disease in the setting of a normal liver or exacerbate existing liver disease in the setting of ongoing hepatitis.\n\nSulforaphane protects Microcystin-LR-induced toxicity through activation of the Nrf2-mediated defensive response\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGan Nanqin; Mi Lixin; Sun Xiaoyun\n\n2010-09-01\n\nMicrocystins (MCs), a cyclic heptapeptide hepatotoxins, are mainly produced by the bloom-forming cyanobacerium Microcystis, which has become an environmental hazard worldwide. Long term consumption of MC-contaminated water may induce liver damage, liver cancer, and even human death. Therefore, in addition to removal of MCs in drinking water, novel strategies that prevent health damages are urgently needed. Sulforaphane (SFN), a natural-occurring isothiocyanate from cruciferous vegetables, has been reported to reduce and eliminate toxicities from xenobiotics and carcinogens. The purpose of the present study was to provide mechanistic insights into the SFN-induced antioxidative defense system against MC-LR-induced cytotoxicity. We performed cell viabilitymoreÂ Â» assays, including MTS assay, colony formation assay and apoptotic cell sorting, to study MC-LR-induced cellular damage and the protective effects by SFN. The results showed that SFN protected MC-LR-induced damages at a nontoxic and physiological relevant dose in HepG2, BRL-3A and NIH 3 T3 cells. The protection was Nrf2-mediated as evident by transactivation of Nrf2 and activation of its downstream genes, including NQO1 and HO-1, and elevated intracellular GSH level. Results of our studies indicate that pretreatment of cells with 10 {mu}M SFN for 12 h significantly protected cells from MC-LR-induced damage. SFN-induced protective response was mediated through Nrf2 pathway.Â«Â less\n\nFunctional analysis of a pathogenesis-related thaumatin-like protein gene TaLr35PR5 from wheat induced by leaf rust fungus.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Jiarui; Wang, Fei; Liang, Fang; Zhang, Yanjun; Ma, Lisong; Wang, Haiyan; Liu, Daqun\n\n2018-05-04\n\nPlants have evolved multifaceted defence mechanisms to resist pathogen infection. Production of the pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins in response to pathogen attack has been implicated in plant disease resistance specialized in systemic-acquired resistance (SAR). Our earlier studies have reported that a full length TaLr35PR5 gene, encoding a protein exhibiting amino acid and structural similarity to a sweet protein thaumatin, was isolated from wheat near-isogenic line TcLr35. The present study aims to understand the function of TaLr35PR5 gene in Lr35-mediated adult resistance to Puccinia triticina. We determined that the TaLr35PR5 protein contained a functional secretion peptide by utilizing the yeast signal sequence trap system. Using a heterologous expression assay on onion epidermal cells we found that TaLr35PR5 protein was secreted into the apoplast of onion cell. Expression of TaLr35PR5 was significantly reduced in BSMV-induced gene silenced wheat plants, and pathology test on these silenced plants revealed that Lr35-mediated resistance phenotype was obviously altered, indicating that Lr35-mediated resistance was compromised. All these findings strongly suggest that TaLr35PR5 is involved in Lr35-mediated adult wheat defense in response to leaf rust attack.\n\nMicrocystin-LR and Cylindrospermopsin Induced Alterations in Chromatin Organization of Plant Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMÃ¡thÃ©, Csaba; M-Hamvas, MÃ¡rta; Vasas, GÃ¡bor\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCyanobacteria produce metabolites with diverse bioactivities, structures and pharmacological properties. The effects of microcystins (MCYs), a family of peptide type protein-phosphatase inhibitors and cylindrospermopsin (CYN), an alkaloid type of protein synthesis blocker will be discussed in this review. We are focusing mainly on cyanotoxin-induced changes of chromatin organization and their possible cellular mechanisms. The particularities of plant cells explain the importance of such studies. Preprophase bands (PPBs) are premitotic cytoskeletal structures important in the determination of plant cell division plane. Phragmoplasts are cytoskeletal structures involved in plant cytokinesis. Both cyanotoxins induce the formation of multipolar spindles and disrupted phragmoplasts, leading to abnormal sister chromatid segregation during mitosis. Thus, MCY and CYN are probably inducing alterations of chromosome number. MCY induces programmed cell death: chromatin condensation, nucleus fragmentation, necrosis, alterations of nuclease and protease enzyme activities and patterns. The above effects may be related to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or disfunctioning of microtubule associated proteins. Specific effects: MCY-LR induces histone H3 hyperphosphorylation leading to incomplete chromatid segregation and the formation of micronuclei. CYN induces the formation of split or double PPB directly related to protein synthesis inhibition. Cyanotoxins are powerful tools in the study of plant cell organization.

The resistant allele Lr34 and the susceptible allele Lr34s can be distinguished by three polymorphisms that cause alternation of deduced amino acid sequences of Lr34 at the protein level. In seedlings of a cultivar carrying the resistant Lr34r allele, only a portion (35%) of its transcripts was correctly spliced and the majority (65%) of its transcripts were incorrectly spliced due to multiple mis-splicing events. Lr34 mis-splicing events were also observed at adult plant age when this gene exerts its function. All of the mis-spliced Lr34r cDNA transcripts observed in this study resulted in a premature stop codon due to a shift of the open reading frame; hence, the mis-spliced Lr34r cDNAs were deduced to encode incomplete proteins. Even if a cultivar has a functional Lr34 gene, its transcripts might not completely splice in a correct pattern. These findings suggested that the partial resistance conferred by a quantitative gene might be due to mis-splicing events in its transcripts; hence, the resistance of the gene could be increased by eliminating or mutating regulators that cause mis-splicing events in wheat.\n\nThe RxLR effector Avh241 from Phytophthora sojae requires plasma membrane localization to induce plant cell death.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Xiaoli; Tang, Junli; Wang, Qunqing; Ye, Wenwu; Tao, Kai; Duan, Shuyi; Lu, Chenchen; Yang, Xinyu; Dong, Suomeng; Zheng, Xiaobo; Wang, Yuanchao\n\n2012-10-01\n\nâ¢ The Phytophthora sojae genome encodes hundreds of RxLR effectors predicted to manipulate various plant defense responses, but the molecular mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Here we have characterized in detail the P. sojae RxLR effector Avh241. â¢ To determine the function and localization of Avh241, we transiently expressed it on different plants. Silencing of Avh241 in P. sojae, we determined its virulence during infection. Through the assay of promoting infection by Phytophthora capsici to Nicotiana benthamiana, we further confirmed this virulence role. â¢ Avh241 induced cell death in several different plants and localized to the plant plasma membrane. An N-terminal motif within Avh241 was important for membrane localization and cell death-inducing activity. Two mitogen-activated protein kinases, NbMEK2 and NbWIPK, were required for the cell death triggered by Avh241 in N. benthamiana. Avh241 was important for the pathogen's full virulence on soybean. Avh241 could also promote infection by P. capsici and the membrane localization motif was not required to promote infection. â¢ This work suggests that Avh241 interacts with the plant immune system via at least two different mechanisms, one recognized by plants dependent on subcellular localization and one promoting infection independent on membrane localization.

LR provides the option to store on average either 1.08 references per triangle or 26.2 bits per triangle. Its construction, from an input mesh that supports constant-time adjacency queries, has linear space and time complexity, and involves ordering most vertices along a nearly-Hamiltonian cycle. LR is best suited for applications that process meshes with fixed connectivity, as any changes to the connectivity require the data structure to be rebuilt. We provide an implementation of the set of standard random-access, constant-time operators formoreÂ Â» traversing a mesh, and show that LR often saves both space and traversal time over competing representations.Â«Â less\n\nThe reality and importance of founder speciation in evolution.\n\nPubMed\n\nTempleton, Alan R\n\n2008-05-01\n\nA founder event occurs when a new population is established from a small number of individuals drawn from a large ancestral population. Mayr proposed that genetic drift in an isolated founder population could alter the selective forces in an epistatic system, an observation supported by recent studies. Carson argued that a period of relaxed selection could occur when a founder population is in an open ecological niche, allowing rapid population growth after the founder event. Selectable genetic variation can actually increase during this founder-flush phase due to recombination, enhanced survival of advantageous mutations, and the conversion of non-additive genetic variance into additive variance in an epistatic system, another empirically confirmed prediction. Templeton combined the theories of Mayr and Carson with population genetic models to predict the conditions under which founder events can contribute to speciation, and these predictions are strongly confirmed by the empirical literature. Much of the criticism of founder speciation is based upon equating founder speciation to an adaptive peak shift opposed by selection. However, Mayr, Carson and Templeton all modeled a positive interaction of selection and drift, and Templeton showed that founder speciation is incompatible with peak-shift conditions. Although rare, founder speciation can have a disproportionate importance in adaptive innovation and radiation, and examples are given to show that \"rare\" does not mean \"unimportant\" in evolution. Founder speciation also interacts with other speciation mechanisms such that a speciation event is not a one-dimensional process due to either selection alone or drift alone.

Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) contains Leucine (L) and Arginine (R) in the variable positions, and is one of the most common and potently toxic peptides. MC-LR can inhibit protein phosphatase type 1 and type 2A (PP1 and PP2A) activities and induce excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The underlying mechanism of the inhibition of PP1 and PP2A has been extensively studied. The over-production of ROS is considered to be another main mechanism behind MC-LR toxicity; however, the detailed toxicological mechanism involved in over-production of ROS in carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) remains largely unclear. In our present study, the hydroxyl radical (â¢OH) was significantly induced in the liver of carp after a relatively short-term exposure to MC-LR. The elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may play an important role in the disruption of microtubule structure. Pre-injection of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) provided significant protection to the cytoskeleton, however buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) exacerbated cytoskeletal destruction. In addition, the elevated ROS formation induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes, including p38, JNKa, and bcl-2. A significant increase in apoptotic cells was observed at 12 - 48 hours. Our study further supports evidence that ROS are involved in MC-LR induced damage to liver cells in carp, and indicates the need for further study of the molecular mechanisms behind MC-LR toxicity.

This was a prospective single-center study in a general gynecology unit of a tertiary hospital during 33 months. There were 292 consecutive women who underwent surgery after an ultrasound diagnosis of an adnexal tumor. All examinations were by a single level 2 ultrasound operator, according to the IOTA guidelines. The malignancy likelihood was calculated using the IOTA LR1 and LR2. The women were then examined separately by an expert operator using subjective PR. These were compared to operative findings and histology. The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy of the 3 methods were calculated and compared. The AUCs for LR1 and LR2 were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92-0.97] and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), respectively. Subjective PR gave a positive likelihood ratio (LR+ve) of 13.9 (95% CI, 7.84-24.6) and a LR-ve of 0.049 (95% CI, 0.022-0.107). The corresponding LR+ve and LR-ve for LR1 were 3.33 (95% CI, 2.85-3.55) and 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01-0.10), and for LR2 were 3.58 (95% CI, 2.77-4.63) and 0.052 (95% CI, 0.022-0.123). The accuracy of PR was 0.942 (95% CI, 0.908-0.966), which was significantly higher when compared with 0.829 (95% CI, 0.781-0.870) for LR1 and 0.836 (95% CI, 0.788-0.872) for LR2 (P < 0.001). The AUC of the IOTA LR1 and LR2 were similar in nonexpert's hands when compared to the original and validation IOTA studies. The PR method was the more accurate test to diagnose ovarian cancer than either of the IOTA models.\n\nEffects of microcystin-LR, cylindrospermopsin and a microcystin-LR/cylindrospermopsin mixture on growth, oxidative stress and mineral content in lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa L.).\n\nPubMed\n\nFreitas, Marisa; Azevedo, Joana; Pinto, Edgar; Neves, Joana; Campos, Alexandre; Vasconcelos, Vitor\n\n2015-06-01\n\nToxic cyanobacterial blooms are documented worldwide as an emerging environmental concern. Recent studies support the hypothesis that microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and cylindrospermopsin (CYN) produce toxic effects in crop plants. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is an important commercial leafy vegetable that supplies essential elements for human nutrition; thus, the study of its sensitivity to MC-LR, CYN and a MC-LR/CYN mixture is of major relevance. This study aimed to assess the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations (1, 10 and 100 Âµg/L) of MC-LR, CYN and a MC-LR/CYN mixture on growth, antioxidant defense system and mineral content in lettuce plants. In almost all treatments, an increase in root fresh weight was obtained; however, the fresh weight of leaves was significantly decreased in plants exposed to 100 Âµg/L concentrations of each toxin and the toxin mixture. Overall, GST activity was significantly increased in roots, contrary to GPx activity, which decreased in roots and leaves. The mineral content in lettuce leaves changed due to its exposure to cyanotoxins; in general, the mineral content decreased with MC-LR and increased with CYN, and apparently these effects are time and concentration-dependent. The effects of the MC-LR/CYN mixture were almost always similar to the single cyanotoxins, although MC-LR seems to be more toxic than CYN. Our results suggest that lettuce plants in non-early stages of development are able to cope with lower concentrations of MC-LR, CYN and the MC-LR/CYN mixture; however, higher concentrations (100 Âµg/L) can affect both lettuce yield and nutritional quality.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that microcystin-LR (MCLR) induced very different molecular effects in normal cells and the tumor cell line SMMC7721. To further explore the MCLR toxicity mechanism in tumor cells, human laryngeal epithelial cells (Hep-2) was examined in this study. Western blot, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and transwell migration assay were used to detect the effects of MCLR on PP2A activity, PP2A substrates, cytoskeleton, and cell migration. The results showed that the protein level of PP2A subunits and the posttranslational modification of the catalytic subunit were altered and that the binding of the AC core enzyme as well as the binding of PP2A/C and Î±4, was also affected. As PP2A substrates, the phosphorylation of MAPK pathway members, p38, ERK1/2, and the cytoskeleton-associated proteins, Hsp27, VASP, Tau, and Ezrin were increased. Furthermore, MCLR induced reorganization of the cytoskeleton and promoted cell migration. Taken together, direct covalent binding to PP2A/C, alteration of the protein levels and posttranslational modification, as well as the binding of subunits, are the main pattern for the effects of MCLR on PP2A in Hep-2. A dose-dependent change in p-Tau and p-Ezrin due to PP2A inhibition may contribute to the changes in the cytoskeleton and be related to the cell migration in Hep-2. Our data provide a comprehensive exposition of the MCLR mechanism on tumor cells. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 32: 890-903, 2017.

It has the potential to alter regulation of the plant cell cycle. The aim of this study was improved understanding of the mitotic alterations induced by cyanotoxin in Vicia faba, a model organism for plant cell biology studies. Methods Vicia faba seedlings were treated over the long and short term with MCY-LR purified in our laboratory. Short-term treatments were performed on root meristems synchronized with hydroxylurea. Sections of lateral root tips were labelled for chromatin, phosphorylated histone H3 and Î²-tubulin via histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Mitotic activity and the occurrence of mitotic alterations were detected and analysed by fluorescence microscopy. The phosphorylation state of histone H3 was studied by Western blotting. Key Results Long-term MCY-LR exposure of lateral root tip meristems increased the percentage of either early or late mitosis in a concentration-dependent manner. We observed hypercondensed chromosomes and altered sister chromatid segregation (lagging chromosomes) leading to the formation of micronuclei, accompanied by the formation of disrupted, multipolar and monopolar spindles, disrupted phragmoplasts and the hyperphosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10. Short-term MCY-LR treatment of synchronized cells showed that PP1 and PP2A inhibition delayed the onset of anaphase at 1 Âµg mLâ1 MCY-LR, accelerated cell cycle at 10 Âµg mLâ1 MCY-LR and induced the formation of lagging chromosomes. In this case mitotic microtubule alterations were not detected, but histone H3 was hyperphosphorylated. Conclusions MCY-LR delayed metaphaseâanaphase transition. Consequently, it induced aberrant chromatid segregation and micronucleus formation that could be associated with both H3 hyperphosphorylation and altered microtubule organization\n\nMicrocystin-LR, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, induces alterations in mitotic chromatin and microtubule organization leading to the formation of micronuclei in Vicia faba.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeyer, DÃ¡niel; TÃ¡ndor, IldikÃ³; KÃ³nya, ZoltÃ¡n; BÃ¡tori, RÃ³bert; Roszik, Janos; Vereb, GyÃ¶rgy; Erdodi, Ferenc; Vasas, GÃ¡bor; M-Hamvas, MÃ¡rta; Jambrovics, KÃ¡roly; MÃ¡thÃ©, Csaba\n\n2012-09-01\n\nMicrocystin-LR (MCY-LR) is a cyanobacterial toxin, a specific inhibitor of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A) with significant impact on aquatic ecosystems.

Biofilms are often studied with respect to bacterial interactions. Many cells inhabiting biofilms are assumed to express âcooperative traits', like the secretion of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). These traits can enhance biofilm-related properties, such as stress resilience or colony expansion, while being costly to the cells that express them. In well-mixed populations cooperation is difficult to achieve, because non-cooperative individuals can reap the benefits of cooperation without having to pay the costs. The physical process of biofilm growth can, however, result in the spatial segregation of cooperative from non-cooperative individuals. This segregation can prevent non-cooperative cells from exploiting cooperative neighbors. Here we examine the interaction between spatial pattern formation and cooperation in Bacillus subtilis biofilms. We show, experimentally and by mathematical modeling, that the density of cells at the onset of biofilm growth affects pattern formation during biofilm growth. At low initial cell densities, co-cultured strains strongly segregate in space, whereas spatial segregation does not occur at high initial cell densities. As a consequence, EPS-producing cells have a competitive advantage over non-cooperative mutants when biofilms are initiated at a low density of founder cells, whereas EPS-deficient cells have an advantage at high cell densities. These results underline the importance of spatial pattern formation for competition among bacterial strains and the evolution of microbial cooperation.

Here, we present the Mediterranean Founder Mutation Database (MFMD), established to offer web-based access to founder mutation information in the Mediterranean population. Mutation data were collected from the literature and other online resources and systematically reviewed and assembled into this database. The information provided for each founder mutation includes DNA change, amino-acid change, mutation type and mutation effect, as well as mutation frequency and coalescence time when available. Currently, the database contains 383 founder mutations found in 210 genes related to 219 diseases. We believe that MFMD will help scientists and physicians to design more rapid and less expensive genetic diagnostic tests. Moreover, the coalescence time of founder mutations gives an overview about the migration history of the Mediterranean population. MFMD can be publicly accessed from http://mfmd.pasteur.ma.

Resolution of this debate has been hindered by a lack of empirical evidence from naturally founded island populations. Here we undertake a genetic analysis of a series of historically documented, natural colonization events by the silvereye species-complex (Zosterops lateralis), a group used to illustrate the process of island colonization in the original founder effect model. Our results indicate that single founder events do not affect levels of heterozygosity or allelic diversity, nor do they result in immediate genetic differentiation between populations. Instead, four to five successive founder events are required before indices of diversity and divergence approach that seen in evolutionarily old forms. A Bayesian analysis based on computer simulation allows inferences to be made on the number of effective founders and indicates that founder effects are weak because island populations are established from relatively large flocks. Indeed, statistical support for a founder event model was not significantly higher than for a gradual-drift model for all recently colonized islands. Taken together, these results suggest that single colonization events in this species complex are rarely accompanied by severe founder effects, and multiple founder events and/or long-term genetic drift have been of greater consequence for neutral genetic diversity.\n\nEffects of serotonin on expression of the LDL receptor family member LR11 and 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis in human vascular smooth muscle cells\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNagayama, Daiji; Ishihara, Noriko; Bujo, Hideaki\n\n2014-04-18\n\nHighlights: â¢ The dedifferentiation of VSMCs in arterial intima is involved in atherosclerosis. â¢ 5-HT showed proliferative effect on VSMCs which was abolished by sarpogrelate. â¢ 5-HT enhanced expression of LR11 mRNA in VSMCs which was abolished by sarpogrelate. â¢ 5-HT suppressed 7KCHO-induced apoptosis of VSMCs via caspase-3/7-dependent pathway. â¢ The mechanisms explain the 5-HT-induced remodeling of arterial structure. - Abstract: Serotonin (5-HT) is a known mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The dedifferentiation and proliferation/apoptosis of VSMCs in the arterial intima represent one of the atherosclerotic changes. LR11, a member of low-density lipoprotein receptor family, may contribute tomoreÂ Â» the proliferation of VSMCs in neointimal hyperplasia. We conducted an in vitro study to investigate whether 5-HT is involved in LR11 expression in human VSMCs and apoptosis of VSMCs induced by 7-ketocholesterol (7KCHO), an oxysterol that destabilizes plaque. 5-HT enhanced the proliferation of VSMCs, and this effect was abolished by sarpogrelate, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. Sarpogrelate also inhibited the 5-HT-enhanced LR11 mRNA expression in VSMCs. Furthermore, 5-HT suppressed the 7KCHO-induced apoptosis of VSMCs via caspase-3/7-dependent pathway. These findings provide new insights on the changes in the differentiation stage of VSMCs mediated by 5-HT.Â«Â less\n\nEffects of PorphyromonasÂ gingivalis LPS and LR12 peptide on TREM-1 expression by monocytes.\n\nPubMed\n\nDubar, Marie; Carrasco, Kevin; Gibot, Sebastien; Bisson, Catherine\n\n2018-05-19\n\nPeriodontal disease involves the activation of host immune response, acting not only as defender of periodontal tissues against bacterial aggression but also as mediator of tissue destruction. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is an immune receptor that synergizes with Toll-like receptors in amplifying the inflammatory response mediated by microbial molecules. To investigate the role of P.Â gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the effect of LR12, a TREM-1 inhibitory peptide, on the expression of membrane-bound and soluble form of TREM-1 on human primary monocytes, as well as the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Cells were stimulated with 1Â Î¼g/ml of LPS with or without LR12. PCR, flow cytometry and ELISA were used to determine TREM-1 expressions and cytokines release by monocytes. P.Â gingivalis LPS can induce a significant increase in TREM-1 expression (mRNA, membrane-bound and soluble form, pÂ <Â 0.001) as well as cytokines (IL-1Î², TNFÎ±) and chemokines (IL-8) production by monocytes. This monocytes' activation was partly prevented by LR12. TREM-1 inhibitors such as LR12 could be interesting for the modulation of the excessive inflammatory response that occurs during periodontal disease. Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Here, we analyse the function of the highly conserved RxLR24 effector of Phytophthora brassicae. RxLR24 was expressed early in the interaction with Arabidopsis plants and ectopic expression in the host enhanced leaf colonization and zoosporangia formation. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments followed by mass spectrometry identified different members of the RABA GTPase family as putative RxLR24 targets. Physical interaction of RxLR24 or its homologue from the potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans with different RABA GTPases of Arabidopsis or potato, respectively, was confirmed by reciprocal Co-IP. In line with the function of RABA GTPases in vesicular secretion, RxLR24 co-localized with RABA1a to vesicles and the plasma membrane. The effect of RxLR24 on the secretory process was analysed with fusion constructs of secreted antimicrobial proteins with a pH-sensitive GFP tag. PATHOGENESIS RELATED PROTEIN 1 (PR-1) and DEFENSIN (PDF1.2) were efficiently exported in control tissue, whereas in the presence of RxLR24 they both accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. Together our results imply a virulence function of RxLR24 effectors as inhibitors of RABA GTPase-mediated vesicular secretion of antimicrobial PR-1, PDF1.2 and possibly other defence-related compounds.

This study aimed to understand the toxic effects and mechanism of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) on the seedling growth and physiological responses of Iris pseudacorus L. (calamus). After a one-month exposure experiment, the growth and development of the calamus leaves were significantly inhibited, and this inhibitory effect was verified to be concentration dependent. Furthermore, the cell membrane system was damaged, and the photosynthesis was also adversely affected by MC-LR. The relative conductivity of the leaves increased from 10.96% to 97.51%, and the total chlorophyll content decreased from 0.89â¯mg/g to 0.09â¯mg/g. Notably, the behavior of the roots in the presence of MC-LR was different from that of the leaves. The seedlings needed to absorb more nutrients to maintain the normal growth at low-toxin concentrations, but the high concentration of (over 250â¯Î¼g/L) MC-LR exceeded the tolerance of plants and inhibited the growth of roots. In addition, MC-LR led to an excessive accumulation of H 2 O 2 , and the seedlings enhanced the activities of catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase to resist oxidative stress. The presence of MC-LR also affected the capacity of the plants to absorb nitrogen and phosphorus. The removal efficiency of NO 3 - -N, the main source of nitrogen, was 63.53% in the presence of 100â¯Î¼g/L MC-LR. As a result, the pH increased, and the growth of plants was indirectly inhibited. Therefore, the presence of MC-LR could affect the purification efficiency of calamus in eutrophic water. This study provides theoretical support for the selection of plants in the eutrophic water.

Primary care in an aging society is a key issue worldwide and the establishment of a new model for primary care in Japanese medical malls is needed. Understanding the requirements of integrated management that contribute to the improvement of medical mall founders' satisfaction levels will help provide better services. We conducted a questionnaire survey targeting 1840 medical facilities nationwide; 351 facilities responded (19.1%). We performed comparative analyses on founders' satisfaction levels according to years in business, department/area, founder's relationship, decisionâmaking system and presence/absence of liaison role. A total of 70% of medical malls in Japan have adjacent relationships with no liaison role in most cases; however, 60% of founders are satisfied. Integrated management requirements involve establishing the mall with peers from the same medical office unit or hospital, a"
