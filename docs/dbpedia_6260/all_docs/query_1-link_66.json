        "text": "Games Summary\n\nGames of the IX Olympiad\n\nThe 1928 Olympic Games marked the first appearance of the Olympic flame. The main stadium design included a tower topped with a large stone bowl in which a symbolic fire burned for the duration of the Games. Seen for miles around, it indicated where the Games were being held.\n\nDuring the Opening Ceremony, Greece led the Parade of Nations with the Dutch coming in at the end, introducing the protocol of having the original host nation marching first and the current host nation marching last.\n\nThe number of female competitors more than doubled from four years earlier as women’s events were finally included in gymnastics and athletics. This led to the first Canadian women being included on a summer Olympic team. There were just seven women on the 92-member team, but they accounted for four of Canada’s 15 medals and made Canada the only country to win more than one gold medal in the five women’s athletics events. “Saskatoon Lily” Ethel Catherwood won the high jump while the 4x100m relay team of Fanny “Bobbie” Rosenfeld, Ethel Smith, Jane Bell, and Myrtle Cook was also victorious. Rosenfeld and Smith shared the podium in the 100m, winning silver and bronze, respectively."
