        "text": "Jessica Martins was just 10 months old when she was struck down with meningitis and septicaemia.\n\nShe was so ill doctors decided to put her in an induced coma and at one stage considered amputating her arms and legs.\n\nDespite surviving and keeping her limbs intact, the side-effects of septicaemia caused damage to her skin, tissue and bones.\n\nA decade on, the schoolgirl is now in desperate need of an operation to extend the length of the bones in her left leg which is nearly 8cm shorter than her right.\n\nBut her father Helder Martins says there have been major delays in the procedure being carried out at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.\n\nAs a result, Jessica is often confined to a wheelchair and needs daily painkillers to stop her her leg muscles from causing her unbearable agony.\n\n\"She's on the maximum amount of painkillers she's allowed,\" said Helder, who says the family have been kept in the dark over the hospital's decision to delay her leg-lengthening procedure.\n\n\"She's in a tremendous amount of pain constantly - and it's now affecting her psychologically.\n\n\"Even though she's been through so much stuff in her short life, she's faced it in a positive way. But now she's getting very angry.\"\n\nJessica was given less than a 30% chance of survival when she was diagnosed with meningitis and septicaemia as a baby.\n\nLuckily she pulled through — but lost the tips of two fingers.\n\n\"Since then she's had approximately 20-odd operations, including pain management surgery and skin grafts,\" said Helder, who lives in Abercynon, Rhondda Cynon Taff.\n\n\"She had previous leg-lengthening surgery on the lower part off her leg to correct it, but now due to normal growth on her right side, her left upper leg needs correcting too.\n\n\"She was under the care of Great Ormond Street Hospital in London for a long time, but we did our research and the University Hospital of Wales said they could cater for her needs. So we moved to Wales.\"\n\nHow to spot the signs of meningitis:\n\nHelder said that the difference in length between Jessica's two legs has increased substantially over the years.\n\n\"The success rate for this kind of operation normally falls within a 5cm discrepancy,\" he said.\n\n\"But now there is almost an 8cm difference as it's gone on for so long.\n\n\"There are times she's in pain at even the slightest movement or the slightest touch to her skin.\"\n\nHelder said while there was a general consensus from UHW medics that an operation to lengthen the bones in her upper left leg is the best course of action, the procedure has been delayed.\n\n\"We were originally given a pre-op appointment on January 31 this year, but it was cancelled one hour prior to the appointment. We were just about the leave the house,\" he added.\n\n\"Since then we've had no answers. Between myself, my wife and the social worker we must have called the hospital every day to get an update. But we haven't got anywhere.\n\n\"We cannot afford private surgery, but as a parent I would do anything for my kids, so fundraising would be the next option.\n\n\"We are getting to a desperate stage now.\"\n\nHelder said the complex operation would require Jessica's leg to be broken in two places and a metal frame inserted underneath the upper part of Jessica's leg.\n\nScrews would then allow the bone to be stretched and grow as normally as possible.\n\n\"I believe the orthopaedic team is working hard to get the surgery carried out, but it's the hospital itself that is delaying it,\" he added.\n\nIn response, a spokesman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: \"We would like to apologise to the family for the delay in Jessica’s surgery.\n\n\"There is a robust process in place to approve the use of new products and technologies in surgical cases to ensure the best outcome possible for patients.\n\n\"The team are working diligently to ensure this process is carried out as quickly as possible.\n\n“If the family would like to discuss their treatment with us directly, then we would encourage them to contact our concerns team.”"
