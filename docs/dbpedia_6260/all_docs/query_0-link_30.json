        "text": "‘If you are interested in helping to alleviate some of the suffering of Jewish Refugees and want to give hospitality, make and adapt clothes, or donate to a relief fund which is being operated by a local committee that is being formed, contact Miss E. Workman, 68 Eaton Avenue.’ So read an appeal which had been placed in the local press, and for Miss Workman, a local teacher, it was perhaps of particular relevance since, from 1935, her counterparts in Germany had been placed directly under the control of the Nazi Party, with the ‘Jewish Problem’ then becoming a focus of classroom lessons. However, on the international scene the plight of Jewish refugees was just one manifestation of an increasingly hostile situation, but, not least through inadequate military preparations, for the moment political gesturing took the place of aggressive action. Nevertheless, perhaps it could be said that Bletchley’s first military ‘casualty’ was Gunner H. Jenkins, of the Royal Artillery Depot, Woolwich, who, one Sunday evening in January, had to be taken off the Wolverton to Euston express and rushed by ambulance from Bletchley to Northampton hospital, as a consequence of having some days before sustained injuries to his ribs in a skating accident.\n\nIn 1936 Britain had started mass-producing gas masks, and as early as 1937 the passing of the Air Raid Precautions Act had laid down the basis for civil protection, with the Government allocating £200,000 in December 1938 for the building of air raid shelters. In other means of defence, with an order being placed for 1,000 Spitfires in March 1938 it had been announced that £11 million was to be spent on new airfields for the R.A.F., and plans for local measures were now set up in the form of Air Raid General Precaution schemes, and Air Raid Fire Precaution schemes. At Bletchley, a new school clinic had recently been opened in Bletchley Road and, should the need arise, as part of the town’s contingency operations plans were advanced to convert these premises into a first aid post for air raid casualties. In fact few people now had any doubts that the need would quite probably soon arise, especially since during January 1939 the Government published a National Service Handbook, which informed the population of the qualifications that would be necessary for service in the armed forces, as well as for other organisations.\n\nIn January Mr. J. Symons, the A.R.P. officer to Aylesbury R.D.C., had been appointed as the Deputy Council Executive Officer for Bucks., and in a further measure to cope with a possible crisis the Government’s ‘National Emergency Survey’ now intended to survey the number of schoolchildren who, in towns and villages of the Rural Districts, could be accommodated nationally. The Minister of Health had accordingly drawn up a scheme to determine the accommodation available in local households, and on a voluntary basis ‘visitors’ would be appointed in every town and village. Persons willing to carry out such duties were invited to contact the R.D.C. Offices at 7, Station Road, Newport Pagnell, and, in connection with the National Evacuation Scheme, official notices were duly received by Bletchley Urban District Council. Householders would then shortly receive a letter asking for their co-operation, and with canvassers duly appointed to visit every home, the A.R.P. Committee subsequently approved the list. The complete report had to be sent to the Ministry by February 28th, and in Bletchley 60 lady enumerators were eventually tasked to investigate available billets with, if evacuation became necessary, Buckinghamshire to then be designated as a ‘receiving area.’\n\nMr. Reginald Leuty Sherwood, Clerk to the Council, had been appointed as Chief Officer to oversee the evacuation scheme, and during February the Chief Constable then agreed to accept County responsibility for the air raid warden services - on condition that extra staff were appointed. In fact B.U.D.C. estimated that 156 A.R.P. volunteers would ideally be required in wartime, although as a minimum reserve 47 could suffice. During the following month the evacuation census then revealed that 10,174 habitable homes were available within the Urban District, plus additional ‘housing’ for 360 persons, and it was decided that 1,601 unaccompanied children could thereby be accommodated, plus 156 teachers, helpers and others. Consequently it would be necessary to supply 165 double mattresses, 176 single mattresses, 202 double blankets and 194 single blankets, and in a conclusion of the exercise a letter of thanks would be sent to each enumerator. By now appropriate plans were being made for the urban rescue and decontamination and demolition services, and in addition the County Council proposed to erect a ‘cleansing station’ - to deal with the effects of a gas attack - near to the Destructor Works in Western Road. Local residents were also mindful of the national concerns, and in March the Council received an offer from the owners of both 81, Bletchley Road, and Ropley House, to lease their premises for A.R.P. purposes, although in the absence of an immediate need the offers were politely declined.\n\nJack Parriss\n\nOn April 5th the Government announced plans for the immediate evacuation of 2½ million children in the event of war, and for those destined for Bletchley perhaps there was some consolation that Jack Parriss had now applied to retail ice cream from his shop at 11, Victoria Road! Under the Evacuation Scheme, 2,000 places had been locally allocated for billeting, although B.U.D.C. had pleasingly received voluntary offers for an additional 3,172. A letter from the Ministry of Health to the Council then confirmed that in the event of an evacuation from London 2,000 people would be accommodated in Bletchley. However, a total of 4,500 would be de-trained at Bletchley L.M.S. station for subsequent transport to adjacent rural districts, and being authorised to appoint volunteers as necessary, Mr. E. Cook, headmaster of the Bletchley Road Senior School, was appointed as the Chief Evacuation and Reception Officer. By a Home Office directive, during April two separate telephone lines were approved for the sole use of the A.R.P. Headquarters, with the actual Control Centre for the area of North Bucks. being located at Newport Pagnell. Under the County Scheme further measures were also then made for the control of the decontamination services, and the Bletchley squads would assume responsibility for the urban district and the parishes of Tattenhoe, Shenley Brook End and Newton Longville. There was also to be a joint decontamination depot at the police station in Simpson Road, whilst as for the staff needed for these emergency organisations, appeals were placed in the local press for volunteers. Aged 30 or over, 20 men would be required as air raid wardens, with 17 vacancies for women, 10 men, aged 25 years or over, as auxiliary firemen and 10 men or women as first aid volunteers. Applicants were asked to contact the A.R.P. officer at the Council Offices, Bletchley, and evening training would then be arranged. As equally important as the A.R.P. measures was the need for food production, and since the country produced less than a third of the amount required, the Government now announced a policy to pay farmers £2 an acre to plough up and reseed pastures.\n\nA decision to conscript men aged 20 for military service was endorsed by the Government on April 27th, and a compulsory national register of youths aged under 21 was nearing completion. Conscripts would then face six months of intensive training, before being transferred to the special reserve or Territorials. As for the military personnel in Bletchley, at a strength now above 60, the 393rd Royal Bucks. Yeomanry Field Battery, Royal Artillery, (T.A.), actually exceeded the war requirement, but in early April the Bletchley section nevertheless acquired a further 20 recruits, who were enlisted as signallers and gunners. A few vacancies still remained for drivers, and those wishing to apply for these positions were asked to contact Sergeant Dickinson, the N.C.O. in charge of the Drill Station, at the Yeomanry Hall, Old Bletchley. The drill nights were held each Monday and Thursday, and on these occasions all the members travelled to Aylesbury for training on the 4.5 howitzers, which equipped the unit. Historically, the contingent had been formed about nine years ago by Major Whiteley, M.P. of The Grange, Bletchley, and had then been solely comprised of signallers. During May the Bletchley Territorial ‘double establishment strength’ of 100 men was achieved, although there was also the potential for about 50 others who were awaiting enlistment. The ‘Receiving Centre’ was situated at the Social Centre, (St. Martin’s Hall), and here to encourage additional interest demonstrations in the car park were being given in a Territorial wireless car. The eventual aim was for Bletchley to have a troop of four guns and a battalion staff, and this seemed a wise ambition when on May 22nd the ‘Pact of Steel’ was signed, binding Germany and Italy in mutual support if war was declared. Meanwhile, on civilian matters the Urban Council had now taken special precautions to protect the waterworks and with spares having been laid in, a squad of waterworks’ employees were being especially trained to defend and repair the water fittings. They could operate even in the presence of gas and explosives, and another squad had also been trained to repair the sewers and other public services.\n\nBy May, in conjunction with the County Council a comprehensive scheme for road repair, rescue and demolition had been organised for the north of the county. In Bletchley a specially trained staff was accordingly on hand to deal with any such situations in the town, whilst in the event of a more widespread emergency, as part of a provision for large scale reinforcements they would also help out in other areas when necessary. As for the Auxiliary Fire Service, despite a need for 12 more recruits training was proceeding well, and much of the necessary equipment had already been obtained from the Home Office. Additional wardens, especially women, were also required, but at least the adapting and manning of the Bletchley Road Clinic as a First Aid Post had now been arranged, with The Hatch, at Old Bletchley, having also been selected as a First Aid point. In the event of air raids the Council Offices would become a ‘Report Centre’, where additional equipment could be installed at short notice, and in association with the brickworks of Fletton’s Ltd., at Water Eaton, an extra warning siren had also been provided since, in certain winds, tests had proved that it was difficult to hear the warnings provided by the siren affixed to the Council Offices, as well as those at Vaughan’s and Cowley & Wilson’s garages. In fact the air raid warning would consist of a two-minute signal, of fluctuating pitch, and residents on hearing the sound were to proceed at once to a gas-proof room, garden trench, outdoor shelter or cellar, and remain there until the all clear was given. As for the protection of buildings, 22,000 sandbags had now been delivered to the Council Offices, and special precautions were taken at the police station which, in the event of an emergency, would become a vital centre.\n\nAt Bletchley station the office windows on no. 8 platform had been painted blue, to comply with the blackout regulations, and, in addition to the sirens in the town, the station would also receive a warning direct from Luton. Roofed over with heavy timbers, upon which the excavated earth and clay was piled, near the goods yard large, well-drained trenches had been dug, lined with seats and with timber lining the steps, and for additional protection the subway under the station could be opened if necessary. As well as those from the loco depot, 30 men had been trained in anti-gas measures and special equipment could be employed for dealing with incendiary bombs. Elsewhere, a schedule for first aid and fire fighting duties had been prepared at the Post Office, and amongst their measures for fire fighting Beacon Brushes now planned to utilise a hydrant, with a small squad being specially trained for this purpose. Near the works a number of large concrete bins, formerly used for storing gravel, could be swiftly covered with beams, corrugated iron and sand bags, to provide the work force with an adequate shelter, whilst in Denbigh Road for the accommodation of the female workers reinforced concrete air raid shelters would be erected at the rear of the W. O. Peake’s factory. Placed near the glass roofs, wire netting would then afford protection to any workers still left in the factory. As for their 70 employees, Premier Press, in Buckingham Road, had arranged for a strong room and an adjacent room to be converted into a shelter, and the scheme also proposed the building of a reinforced wall outside the present wall, to be protected by layers of sandbags. Brick partitions would break up any air concussion, and placed over the factory windows would be wooden frames covered with brown paper. This would prevent any light from escaping, and blinds fitted to the girders of the glass roof would perform a similar function. Elsewhere, further protective measures were in hand at the Root’s Brush Works in Tavistock Street, whilst arrangements at the brushworks in Victoria Road of M. A. Cook & Sons also complied with the Home Office regulations. As for the Fletton’s brickworks, the precautions involved making convenient use ‘of the works’ natural resources.’\n\nYet it seemed that the sense of national urgency was not apparent to everyone, since the Bletchley branch of the N.U.R. passed a resolution protesting against peacetime conscription. However, others appeared more mindful of their duties and in May Dr. A. Critchley, as the Medical Officer, was granted 14 days leave for military training. Also on the military scene, with the expansion of the Bletchley detachment of the 393rd Royal Bucks. Yeomanry Field Battery, R.A., promotions during the month included those of Sergeant A. Dickinson to the rank of Troop Sergeant Major, and Lance Sergeant R. Dickinson to Sergeant. In future, the battery’s ‘A’ Troop and some specialists would be based at Aylesbury, whilst ‘B’ Troop signallers, plus some drivers at Bletchley, and ‘C’ Troop, would be centred at Buckingham and Wotton. With two, or sometimes four, guns being available, the N.C.O.s carrying out the duties of Number 1 on the guns were now Sergeant Cutler, Sergeant Dickinson, Bombardier Simcox and Bombardier Hall, and with the training proceeding well, an attendance of around 80 members could usually be expected at the drills, which took place on Mondays, Thursdays and Sundays. Under the instruction of Sergeant Dowsett the drivers were also making good progress, and the combined skills of the battery would be made apparent at a parade on Sunday, June 4th, when a field day took place at Wotton. In addition, night operations were also scheduled for July 1st and 2nd.\n\nAccording to the initial letter of their surname, with some flexibility being allowed for ‘personal circumstances’ 76 young men were enrolled at Bletchley Employment Exchange on the afternoon and evening of June 3rd. Between the hours of 1.30p.m. and 8.30p.m., in seven groups each man was handed a leaflet and also a card, which although they had to sign would only be returned in the event of a change of address. During June, with the final equipment now received mock air raid tests were conducted, and in preparation for a real situation members of the St. John Ambulance Brigade had not only been given talks on A.R.P. matters by Mr. A. Bates, the Surveyor, but had also undergone the emergency gas test. In fact the first course of A.R.P. First Aid Work had begun in September 1938, and the third course was now presently in progress. With the increasing likelihood of air raids, the enforcement of the blackout would become of extreme importance, and especially perhaps for the newly elated residents of Railway Terrace, who, by courtesy of a recently approved plan from the Northampton Electric Light Co., would shortly enjoy the novelty of electricity. In fact this was a benefit to be also bestowed on the inhabitants of Beechcroft Road, for a letter from the St. Georges Building Works had been received stating that the building work was now complete. However, perhaps unsurprisingly an application by the residents of Church Green Road for additional street lighting would be deferred.\n\nAs a spectacular culmination of the various training schemes, on the evening of June 9th hundreds of people watched the local National Service parade and demonstration which, to be inspected by the Chief Constable, Colonel T. Warren, had assembled in Bletchley Park. A quarter of a mile long, it was headed by an R.A.F. pipe band, and set off along Buckingham Road and Bletchley Road. Also included were the Territorials, with a gun and trailer and two wireless cars, the St. John Ambulance workers and nursing sisters with two ambulances, (regular and auxiliary), the firemen, (with a fire engine and equipment), and A.R.P. wardens, and upon reaching the Council Offices an air raid warning was then sounded. Indeed, for the purpose of the exercise it was announced that from a formation of enemy aircraft, which had supposedly been intercepted over Great Yarmouth, three had breached the home defence and were now heading for Bletchley. From the aerodrome at Cranfield a trio of bombers consequently swept overhead, and in the grounds of the Bletchley Road Schools Sergeant Boyes simultaneously exploded two ‘bombs.’ The nursing sisters immediately gave medical attention to the ‘casualties’ lying on the footpaths, and the ‘injured’ were then taken away on stretchers to the waiting ambulances. Meanwhile, the ‘raiders’ made a second approach, and during this attack ‘gas bombs’ were set off. With ‘fire’ breaking out on the balcony and the roof of the County Council offices, led by Captain Brooks the fire brigade swiftly manned the necessary equipment and skilfully dealt with the crisis. Soon the decontamination squad and lorry arrived via Western Road, and at the Victoria Road corner the contaminated section was marked off, whilst men working in full kit and gas masks dealt with the hazard. At the sound of the ‘All Clear’ the parade then re-formed and marched via Vicarage Road, Aylesbury Street, High Street and Victoria Road back to the Council Offices, where they then dispersed. However, as if for an added emphasis it seemed appropriate that the film ‘The Warning’ was being currently shown at the County Cinema!\n\nOn a more pacifist theme, for a mass protest against conscription permission was later given for the Bletchley Branch of the N.U.R. to use the Leon Recreation Ground, but this was only on the understanding that the gathering remained orderly. On more potent matters, on the evening of Monday, June 10th, the Bletchley A.R.P. Report Centre took part in a county report centre test. With all the personnel at their posts trial messages were sent and received, and at an evening ceremony at the Bletchley Senior School Hall, on Friday, July 14th, Major Whiteley then presented nearly 200 A.R.P. badges to the Bletchley volunteers. By now the arrival of evacuees in the town seemed an increasing possibility, and therefore amongst the necessary preparations a course of four lectures on Home Nursing was arranged for mothers, and other women, who in the event of an emergency would be tasked to receive the refugee children.\n\nAfter the Munich Crisis a massive publicity drive had taken place to recruit A.R.P. wardens and other personnel, and the Bletchley Surveyor, Arthur Bates, had been appointed as A.R.P. organiser for the Bletchley district. However, in July 1939, despite the urgency of the situation, emphasised by the issue to every household of Public Information Leaflet No. 2, which recommended the measures to comply with the potential blackout, he tendered his resignation. This was because of a significant increase in the responsibilities of the post, and no doubt the work load of the Clerk of the Council had also significantly increased, since a new typewriter had now been ordered for his office. As for Mr. Bates, he felt that he would no longer be able to offer a full commitment, since in his usual duties he was not only the Council’s surveyor, but also the engineer and water engineer, having therefore to deal with the duties for decontamination, rescue and demolition, road and sewer repairs, and also the protection of the waterworks, the reservoir and many miles of associated mains and appliances. Yet understandably reluctant to sanction his resignation, the Council nevertheless sympathised with his reasons.\n\nBy now there were 59 A.R.P. wardens, 27 auxiliary firemen, 83 first aid and ambulance workers, six report centre workers and 14 messengers, and the Council had agreed that an additional seven wardens, two H.Q. staff and one first aid post worker would also be needed as full-time personnel. As for the protection of the residents in the town, the Council had deliberately chosen not to pursue a policy of building shelters or digging trenches, with the reason being to so lessen the vulnerability of the population by avoiding a concentration in specific areas. During July, in the event of evacuees being received in the town the Ministry of Health had asked the Council to accept the first instalment of blankets, but, since no suitable storage was as yet available, the request for the time being was deferred. Meanwhile school life continued as normal, and on July 6th the Bletchley Road Senior School was closed on the occasion of the school journey to Southampton. Accompanied by all the staff the 150 pupils in the party enjoyed a full day and although this included a cruise on Southampton Water and an inspection of the liner Aquitania, it could not be known that in just a few months time on this very vessel a small code breaking contingent from America would cross the Atlantic, to join the code breakers at Bletchley Park.\n\nIn August, performed under the direction of Dr. Critchley, Dr. W. Carter and Mr. W. Brown, B.U.D.C. announced via the local press that, as part of Home Defence exercises, an A.R.P. blackout would take place on the night of August 9/10th. With London and 26 other counties to be affected, householders were consequently asked to extinguish, or ‘black out’, their lamps between 11.30p.m. on Wednesday night, August 9th, until 4a.m. on the morning of August 10th, and about 45 Bletchley wardens would patrol their areas from 11.30p.m. until 1a.m. As the first aid centre, the Clinic became the assembly point for around 40 workers, some wearing decontamination clothing, and at ‘The Hatch’, Old Bletchley, the A.R.P. post remained fully manned. Then for an added realism, at 12.02a.m. ‘gas cases’ were treated by special squads of workers, and ‘casualties’ were tended at both Water Eaton and the back of the Bletchley Road schools. However, since the new ambulance was required elsewhere, on this occasion the old one had to suffice instead. Police and Special Constables were briefed to not only patrol the district, but also exercise traffic control at the crossroads on the Watling Street, although as a concession to motorists and pedestrians at the most important road junctions all the kerbs had been painted white. As for Bletchley station, to allow the railway work to continue the most important lights remained on. The exercise certainly emphasised the need for, and the scale of, A.R.P. activities, and, with office accommodation provided, not surprisingly B.U.D.C. advertised in August for an A.R.P. officer at a salary of £200p.a. Ideally possessing administrative and organisational experience, and being fully prepared to devote the whole of their time to these duties, interested persons were to apply by August 31st, a date which in fact seemed entirely significant, since by then Germany and the Soviet Union would have signed a Non Aggression Pact, and Poland and France would be calling up reservists.\n\nWith ‘B’ Troop and the Signal Section consisting of Warrant Officers, N.C.O.s and ordinary members, in other ongoing preparations the Territorials now underwent training at their annual camp in Chiseldon, near Swindon, but having been washed out by a severe storm, they were hurriedly obliged to transfer from tents into huts. Commanded by Colonel F. Watson, with Major Whiteley as second in command, the 95 men from the Bletchley district then returned to the town on the morning of Sunday, August 13th. In fact some weeks earlier the 99th Regiment (Field), comprising the Berks. & Bucks. Yeomanry, had been divided and, whilst the Bucks. unit remained as the 99th, the Berks. ‘component’ then became the 145th Regiment. The Council, by hiring temporary accommodation in a building near the Lantern Café, at 38, Bletchley Road, had now resolved the problems of storage for the blankets and mattresses, provided under the Evacuation Scheme, and the fee of 5s would be inclusive of the necessary heating and lighting. Then on Wednesday, August 23rd, preparations began to bring the Bletchley precautionary measures into immediate readiness, and, in the absence of a replacement, Mr. A. Bates, the Surveyor, had rescinded his resignation as the A.R.P. organiser, and agreed to resume the work. This had been at the specific request of the Council chairman, the A.R.P. and the police, and regarding other appointments in August the Clerk of the Council reported that because of the international situation nominations would be considered for a local Food Control Committee, to be formed whenever the need arose. Candidates included the Senior School headmaster, Mr. E.C. Cook, of ‘Draycot’, Church Walk, Mr. H. Baker, of Rhondda House and Mr. E. Callaway M.B.E., of 143, Bletchley Road, and nominations were also sought for a Fuel and Light Committee, to be activated by the Government if necessary.\n\nIn the event of a national emergency, together with the U.D.C. Squads and the necessary equipment the County Council Decontamination and Road Repair Squads were now concentrated at the Urban Council Depot, behind the Council Offices. By night and day specialist staff manned the Report Centre, at the Council Offices, and telephone links had been extended to all the wardens’ posts. On the evening of Friday, August 25th, the A.R.P. wardens then met to receive their equipment, and for the ‘blacking out’ of the helmets Messrs. M. A. Cook & Son had placed their paint spraying plant at the disposal of the A.R.P. organiser. All necessary equipment and emergency lighting was now being urgently installed at the wardens’ posts, and these were situated at (1) Simpson House, tel. 149; (2) Staple Lodge, tel. 146; (3) Council Offices, tel. 27 & 270; (4) Wigley & Johnson offices, tel. 53; (5) The Sned, Buckingham Road, tel. 151; (6) Manor Farm, Old Bletchley, tel. 240 and (7) Maudanclair, Stoke Road, tel. 219. Meanwhile, applications for respirators were being directed to the District Warden, and not Central Office, and in other measures, Mr. A. Hancox, the local Scoutmaster, had organised messengers for immediate service. It was therefore just as well that although the Bletchley Scouts had planned to camp at Salcombe, Devon, in view of the worsening situation their parents had asked that instead they should now stay within the district. August witnessed the increasing need for additional rescue and demolition squads, to be recruited from amongst the local builders, and, if aged above 30, potential candidates were asked to apply to the Central Offices. With the imposition of a blackout being increasingly likely, with the advent of screened headlights a large ‘P’ was to be painted near every pedestrian crossing in the town, and as a further assistance for road users Council workmen were also painting a dotted white line along the centre of Bletchley Road.\n\nIn the event of war, rationing would be inevitably introduced, and Mr. R. Sherwood had made arrangements under the Food Defence department to bring a control scheme into operation. When the need arose, the public would then be supplied with a ration card form, to be filled in and returned to the Council Offices as soon as possible. With international tensions now heightened, the Bletchley Observer Post became manned night and day and, as Captain of the Bletchley Fire Brigade, Mr. J. Brooks was appointed to direct both the Brigade and Auxiliary Fire Services, the latter of which currently comprised 27 members with four modern auxiliary fire fighting units. As for the control of the ambulances, on his return from holiday these, and the first aid sections, became the responsibility of Dr. Critchley, whilst in other measures Mr. W. Brown, and Mr. A. Bates, arranged the necessary fitting of blinds for the Central First Aid Post at the Clinic. In further preparations the auxiliary ambulances, lent by Ramsbotham & Co., and the Bletchley Co-op, had been fitted with stretchers, and from Aylesbury a Co-op van was detailed to collect the full medical supplies for Bletchley on August 28th.\n\nThe employees at W. O. Peake’s were now taking their gas masks to work, to rehearse for a real emergency, and at the Northampton Electric Light Co. a man was kept on duty at the power station, with his task being to switch off the town’s street lighting as soon as an air raid warning was received. Bletchley provision traders had been asked to carry as large a stock as possible, this being a preliminary to the anticipated arrival of evacuees in the town, and at the end of August Mr. E. Cook, the Chief Evacuation Officer for the B.U.D.C. scheme, duly gave a full report to the Council. Carrying 822 children, and scheduled to arrive at Bletchley station each day at 1.43p.m., the evacuation train would be met by the Chief Evacuation Officer, amongst others, and on the first day the entire contingent would de-train at Bletchley. On the second day, however, they would go to the Winslow Rural area and, on the third day, 174 would come to Bletchley with the remainder being sent to Winslow. At least that was the initial arrangement, although following a recent visit by a Ministry of Health Inspector, Mr. Sherwood had now been informed that a further 1,500 might also be sent to the town.\n\nFor the distribution of the children to their billets, the town would be divided into zones, with each zone coming under the control of a marshal. They had responsibility for the billeting books, and would await the arrival of their charge at the rationing centre. Once the issue of rations was complete they would then march the children off to their zone where assistants, each holding charge of a street or streets, would be handed the billeting books before taking the evacuees to their new homes. Should for any reason accommodation not be available, then they were to go with a guide to the Bletchley Road Senior School and await further instructions. In order to ensure that the evacuees were safely settled in, the helpers had organised themselves into a welfare group, and if necessary Mr. Cook, under the Emergency Powers Act, had the right to requisition any billet or property that he felt might be additionally needed. In the event of any objections, these would then be dealt with by a tribunal. According to the evacuation plans, on the first day no buses would be required, but on the second day six would be waiting in Oliver Road, to undertake at least two journeys to the Winslow area. Thus initially the plans seemed well prepared until, on receipt of the rations, it was discovered that the biscuit quota was 317lb. short. On investigation it then transpired that some of the tins marked as 7lb. had in fact contained 12½lb., and this thankfully then left only a shortfall of 95lb! That the plans were well prepared was indeed fortuitous for, with war now seemingly inevitable, on August 31st at 5.30a.m. the evacuation of 1½ million children began. The following day German troops crossed the Polish frontier, and on September 3rd Britain and France were once again at war with Germany.\n\nAs the evacuation to the countryside began, in scenes repeated during the following two days, on Friday, September 1st, 1939, the mainline stations of the nation were swamped by not only thousands of children, but also a lesser number of mothers, helpers and teachers. However, the story of those evacuees arriving at Bletchley station, (and the subsequent arrangements for billeting), is told elsewhere, in the chapter ‘Far from Home.’ Under the overall charge of Mr. Taylor the new arrivals comprised 300 children and 31 adults, (under the charge of Mr. Lewis), from St. Paul’s School, Islington, seven children and two adults, (under Miss Mills), from Beresford School, Islington, five children and two adults, (under Miss Fulford), from Arundel House School, and the largest contingent, 407 children and 47 adults, from Ecclesbourne Road School, Islington. Then known as the Ecclesbourne Road Elementary School the premises had opened on May 3rd, 1886, with a capacity for 1,209 pupils, but initially only 350 attended. However, by 1895 the school had become so popular that an extension had to be built, and during World War Two to prevent children from wandering the streets it continued in education as an Emergency School. After the war Ecclesbourne became a primary school, divided into infants and juniors, and from 1965 until 1969 one famous pupil would be Linda Robson, star of the recent television series ‘Birds of a Feather.’ Due to the age of the buildings, and the limited number of pupils, at the closure in 2004 the school was then combined with the nearby Charles Lamb Primary to become The New North Community School. As for the story of the London wartime evacuation from Ecclesbourne, this belongs elsewhere, and all the log books and other documents have now been lodged with the Joint Archive Service of the Corporation of London. As for the wartime children from Islington aged under five, they were sent to Gloucestershire, to the residential Pro Patria Nursery at Dyrham Park, ‘a grand 17th century mansion now owned by the National Trust.’\n\nAt Bletchley, ‘Owing to the War Emergency’ the local schools were in use as the centre of the evacuation organisation, and with the premises - at least ‘until further instructions have been received’ - being closed for the purpose of tuition, at Bletchley Road Senior School the Evacuation Office staff were consequently kept busy with any problems that arose. The Senior School reopened on September 22nd, and by September 26th the schools of the town were again receiving local and evacuee children. However, the following day a conference took place between the heads of the Bletchley schools and the London schools to discuss the problems that arose from working in double sessions, and this was a need brought about because, taught by local staff, the local children were now attending between 9a.m. and 12.30p.m., whilst evacuees attended from 1p.m. until 4.30p.m., taught by the staff of the London schools. With boys and girls split into groups, the evacuated schools were allocated different sections of the local school, and to distinguish between the schools some scholars wore improvised badges. At the two entrances to the Senior School two large boards had been erected, on which notices were placed for the evacuees to study, and, with no fixed schedules as yet planned, apart from a mix of lessons the pupils were occupied with a course of nature study walks. Nevertheless, matters seemed under control and when the chairman of the managers visited the Senior School on September 29th he found a satisfactory situation, ‘bearing in mind the difficulties through which the staff are passing, which reflects great credit on the Head Master and his whole staff.’ Then on October 2nd Miss E. Ford, H.M.I., signed the Emergency Time Table, by which it was intended to preserve a balance of subjects by devoting less time to each, with organised outdoor activities arranged for the afternoons. The evacuated Senior School children now attended the local Senior School, and with Mr. Taylor being the headmaster Miss Stearns was the headmistress. A lady of great belief in the benefit of rest for her pupils, at her London school she had even placed beds on the roof such that, especially for those girls aged 10 and above, ‘the scholars could thus thoroughly relax in the open air and in comparative quiet.’\n\nAt Bletchley, due to the increased number of pupils it was now perhaps of little surprise that Miss Mead, the school caretaker, would shortly apply for an increase in her wage, especially since an additional 50 evacuees were expected to arrive within the next fortnight. On October 30th the Senior School then began using the Spurgeon Memorial Baptist Chapel Sunday School in the afternoons, and in fact this facility was alternated each week with the Juniors, who were now being taught by Mr. Lewis as headmaster, and Miss Hawkins as headmistress. As for the infants, they attended the Infants’ School under Miss Eden, and with the further introduction of gardening on ground near the schools, games and walks were to be arranged in the mornings. Elsewhere, with the idea being to guide the children in school discipline, and to teach them to look after themselves, 32 pupils aged between three and five attended the Bletchley Nursery Class which, this being the first full term, occupied a separate building opposite the Bletchley Road Infants’ School. As for adults, they could further their education through the reading material available at the now relocated local library for, in February, a letter proposing to transfer the amenity from the Temperance Hall to the Bletchley Road schools had been sent to the County Council. This had been at the instigation of the Buckinghamshire County Education Committee, and, with the work now to be taken over by a Voluntary Committee, the position of part-time paid librarian was in consequence abolished. The employment of the paid librarian, Mr. J. Fennell, thus came to an end on September 30th, and a letter of thanks was sent in appreciation of his past service. Following this rearrangement, from October 21st books were then issued from Bletchley Road Junior School on Saturday afternoons from 2p.m. until 4.30p.m., and at this new centre the County Librarian asked that, with £27 as the balance in hand from the County Council Library Fund, the money should now be expended on providing shelves and other necessities.\n\nWith the weather proving inclement, no outdoor activities could be carried out on the afternoon of November 6th, which thereby provided the first opportunity for the school teaching staff to meet together since the evacuation. Held in the headmaster’s room at the Senior School the occasion ‘was all very refreshing and inspiring’, and these were perhaps also the sentiments aroused for a member of the teaching staff, Winifred Burnham, when three days later she obtained leave of absence to attend her sister’s wedding. A member of staff since June 13th, 1938, her home was at 16, Victoria Street, Wolverton. (In fact she would remain a member of the staff until her retirement in July, 1967, on the occasion of which she was presented with a watch). As for adult education, with the enrolment at Bletchley Road Senior School taking place on Tuesday, November 14th, the Bletchley Evening Institute would reopen on Monday, November 20th, with ‘Technical, Commercial and English Appreciation’ being amongst the courses. The Bletchley Parents’ Association then held a social evening at the schools on Saturday, November 18th, and this was the first time since the beginning of the war that the large hall had been used at night. Indeed, only a small area remained for dancing, since the event proved so popular that the hall was crowded with soldiers, local people and evacuees! Also increasing the local population were the many personnel employed at Bletchley Park, where, apart from the activities which are now well known, boys from the Senior School were busily engaged in building pig sties, in connection with the school farm which was accommodated in the grounds! Also in the vicinity was Elmers Grammar School, and since this had now been taken over by the code breakers it no longer remained available for the purposes of education. Therefore, as an alternative a limited number of pupils were being received at The Rectory and, with the next term due to commence on Thursday, January 18th, particulars could be obtained from the headmaster at ‘Highfield’, Manor Road. School accommodation for the evacuated children also remained a problem, and on November 21st the L.C.C. Inspector, Mr. Waite, in the company of the Senior School headmaster, Mr. E.C. Cook, inspected several halls in the town, in fact an exercise that was followed up on November 27th by Mr. Higg, when amongst several locations he investigated the possibilities of the Wesleyan Hut, St. Martin’s Hall, the Temperance Hall and Water Eaton Hall. On December 4th Mr. E.C. Cook attended a teachers meeting in Aylesbury. This was to discuss the Christmas arrangements for evacuated children, and of the seasonal school entertainments which were now rounding off the year, those given by the children of the Bletchley Road Junior School in the Senior School hall formed a prelude to the forthcoming Christmas party. The pupils of the Senior School then staged an impressive production of Dickens’ ‘Christmas Carol’ - which duly ‘proved that the school was going to be a force in giving pleasure and enjoyment to others’ - and after this the London teachers gave an entertainment for all the evacuee children at the Bletchley schools. Following a tea a concert suitably concluded the festive events, with the schools then closing for the Christmas break on December 22nd.\n\nDue to the war, at the beginning of 1940 it had not been possible to hold the London Brick Company’s children’s party. Instead, a New Year party was organised by the London Brick Company’s Ladies’ Social Club, and this thereby augmented the efforts to raise money for a distribution of gifts, to those children of school age whose fathers were presently on active service. The Bletchley Road schools reopened on January 10th, and Mr. E.C. Cook had received information at the end of the previous year that the Ecclesbourne Road Senior Girls’ School would now be accommodated in the Temperance Hall, and the Ecclesbourne Road Senior Boys’ School in the Pavilion, at Bletchley Park. As for the Bletchley Road Senior School, the full timetable would now be worked with - due to the blackout - the only deviation being that the afternoon session was scheduled from 1.30p.m. to 3.30p.m. Yet the school day would perhaps seem longer for the many children who had to travel from the outlying villages, being conveyed back and forth in some eight or nine school coaches. With German measles prevalent, and flu ‘spreading rapidly’, there would now be numerous absences, and with the ongoing call up there would also be several absences of the male teaching staff. In fact as one instance on February 27th Mr. Kenneth Davies, of the Bletchley Road Senior School, was summoned to an interview for military service. A history graduate, (with honours), of Swansea University, he had joined the Senior School on September 4th, 1939, and would begin his military duties on June 27th.\n\nThe Bletchley Road schools now carried on a local education successive to that of the original ‘Board School’, built in 1890, which, administered by a ‘School Board’ - composed of locally elected worthies - was then part of a national policy to impart a general education to all children, as demanded by an increasingly industrialised society. In fact the plaque of the ‘Board School’ may still be seen on the original building, which initially accommodated girls and infants. However, by 1898 a boys’ school had also been constructed and in 1902, the year in which Board Schools were abolished, (their duties to be taken over by the County Council), a girls’ school as well, which bordered the Leon Recreation Ground. On Speech Day in 1934 the presiding Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, Mr. H. Ramsbotham, then forecast an impending reorganisation of the Bletchley schools, and indeed in 1937 a new building for the Senior School was constructed. The Infants’ School thereby became a primary school and the girls’ school an infants’ school, where Miss M. Brown held sway at the infants’ nursery class. Indeed, this would be a role in which she continued until the end of the war, when appointed to a similar position at Slough. Having been a soldier in Germany at the end of World War One, in the years before World War Two Mr. William Crisp had been headmaster at Stewkley village school. Described as ‘a tall man, dark hair, with half a smile on his face’, he was now the headmaster of the Bletchley Junior Mixed Department, (remaining in this appointment until 1953, when appointed headmaster at the new Water Eaton Junior School), and amongst the other teaching staff who were now reporting for duty were Miss Amy Milsom, who had been teaching in local schools for over 20 years, Mr. Harold Harding, Mrs. J. Ounsworth, Mr. A. Richards, Miss C. Fowler, and, to commence Student Teacher training, Miss E. Clark, Miss Ida Capell and Miss Elsie Wing. Before the war Miss Wing had arrived in Bletchley from Luton, and she would teach local children aged from seven to eleven for nearly 40 years, indeed remaining at the Bletchley Road school until 1953, when she moved to the newly built Water Eaton school as deputy head. Accounting music and country dancing amongst her interests, at her retirement in 1965 she was then appropriately presented with a record player. As for Miss Capell, she had trained at Bishops Stortford Teachers’ Training College and, following the re-organisation of the Bletchley Road schools, in 1946 became deputy head of the Junior School.\n\nUpon entry to the Bletchley Modern Secondary School the pupils were streamed according to practical or academic ability. Equipped with a short and frequently carried cane, Mr. Cook maintained a firm discipline - ‘Just looking at him made you decide never to argue’ - and, when walking along the lengthy corridors, (which induced ‘a glorious temptation to run’), pupils had to obey the rules and maintain an orderly progression along the sides. For any misdemeanour, at his whistle everyone would immediately stand still, and the cane effected the necessary punishment! Another cane wielding teacher was Bill Puryer, art master and assistant head, and his means of maintaining discipline was by the use of a white stick with a silver tip! Mr. Bennett taught handicrafts and metalwork/woodwork, and prominently displayed on the wall of his workshop was the ‘motto’ ‘Plane one surface and one edge true (Before beginning any piece of woodwork).’ Hailing from Wales, (as did several of the teachers, who were escaping the poverty and industrial gloom of their homeland), he was a well respected but ‘feared’ master, and was in a good position to keep an eye on his son, Cledwyn, who also attended the school! Regarding the other masters, during the war Mr. Baker and Mr. Cross variously took rural studies, Mr. Harris, biology, Mr. A. Richards, geography and Mr. William Moss, an ex World War One sergeant, maths. In fact, resident at ‘Parkway’, Woburn Sands, he would join the staff on November 6th, 1941. As for the female staff, introducing a romantic interest Miss Ellen Hope married the science master, ‘Jotter’ Jones, Mrs. Evans, of 69, Eaton Avenue, took the cookery classes, Miss W. Burnham taught arts and needlework, and amongst the other lady members of the Bletchley schools were Miss Capell, Miss Wing and Mrs. Edwards, who played the piano. At the front of the school the lawns, which had been first laid to turf in September, 1890, were mown and maintained by the boys, and employed from April 5th, 1943, as the groundsman and gardener George Cheshire was rarely seen attired without a hat, woolly jumper and jacket, ‘and for all the world he looked like an ordinary householder.’ With air raid precautions now of national concern, on January 19th the Junior School received 29 yards of blackout curtain material, and despite very heavy snow on January 26th Mr. J. Haynes, the Assistant Secretary for Education, brought the blackout material for the Senior School. Indeed, for the schoolchildren life in 1940 must have seemed a very strange affair for, firstly contained in a cardboard box, and later in tin canisters, gasmasks had to be carried at all times, and the children were given instructions on wearing them by the teachers; ‘Get your chin in first and then pull it up.’ In fact further reminding of the prevailing perils the Central War Memorial was situated outside the boys’ school, on a site which had been first approved in 1920. At that time the Council had given permission for a captured German field gun to be displayed on the lawn of the Infants’ School but being regarded as somewhat unsuitable the offer, from the Lord Lieutenant of the County, would be subsequently declined.\n\nAt first perhaps invariably there had been a fair degree of animosity between the local lads, many of whom came from a rural background, and the new evacuees, who predominantly came from an impoverished urban environment. Fights would occasionally break out although, unless matters got out of hand, these were generally tolerated to thus allow a gradual integration and a mutual respect to develop. As for bullies the solution was simple. They were paired off in the boxing ring, where their egos soon became lessened, and their aggressions expended. As the result of a meeting of parents, held under the chairmanship of Mr. C. Flack, chairman of B.U.D.C., just before the opening of the Senior School in 1937 the Parents’ Association had come into being, With a working committee formed the officers were then duly appointed, and in the formulation of the objectives it was decided;\n\n1/ To promote the right kind of co-operation between parents and teachers and to establish a spirit of good fellowship between all concerned with the upbringing and education of children.\n\n2/ To make contact with those who have expert knowledge on all educational matters.\n\n3/ To organise Lectures, Classes, Social Gatherings, Visits to Places of Interest, and Outings for Pleasure.\n\n4/ To stimulate interest in the Physical, Mental and Moral Development of Children.\n\nIn fact through the Parents’ Association the school would be variously provided with an encyclopaedia, The Cambridge History of Literature, many other reference works, a complete P.T. outfit - both dress and equipment - for girls, tennis courts, a putting green, croquet and other games equipment, and in addition the ‘Talkie Film Apparatus’ was overhauled. Entertainments were also provided, and on Saturday, January 27th the Association held a popular Sausage & Mash Supper and social evening in the Senior School hall. Some 200 people attended, and music for dancing was provided by Mr. T. Papworth. As for membership of the Parents’ Association, this was open to all married persons who lived within the area served by the schools, which from February 1st would close at 4p.m. Attendance by the schoolchildren was now severely affected by heavy snowfalls, yet nevertheless on February 5th the Medical Officer for Health arrived in the afternoon to carry out his ‘Routine Inspection’ of the Juniors. On the following day Nurse Plant then undertook an examination for lice which, if discovered, were dealt with by a treatment containing coal tar, with the smell being allegedly not dissimilar to that of creosote! Far more unnerving were visits to the school dentist, Dr. Blumenau, although his kindly manner, and the promise of a silver sixpence for tooth extractions, helped to allay any initial fears. He was born and bred in Germany, where he practised in the medical and dental professions, but in 1938 friends in the Nazi party then warned him that, because of his Jewish origins, his name was on a list of those persons destined for a concentration camp. Thus pre-warned he managed to flee just three days before the Gestapo came to arrest him and, aged in his 50s, and scarcely speaking the language, he arrived in England with only 10 marks and a few possessions. However, since these included his dental equipment he duly set up as a dentist in premises at Clarence Parade, Portsmouth, overlooking the harbour, although this situation, plus the fact that as a keen photographer he always travelled with his Leica camera, ‘in all innocence, could hardly have made himself more suspect.’ - especially since he soon gained the friendship of a retired admiral, with whom he often played chess! At the outbreak of war, having passed through a transit camp at Liverpool he was then interned as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man where, with the camp run by the military authorities, the inmates were courteously treated and the conditions generally good. During this incarceration Dr. Blumenau was given violin lessons by one of the inmates, and in fact he would feel almost ashamed to be living ‘so pleasantly and safe’ whilst London, where his brother and family were accommodated, was the subject of heavy air raids. Yet his conscience was amply redeemed, for being the only dentist in the somewhat overcrowded camp he employed his skills looking after the teeth of the inmates, although with no one to look after his own teeth he lost all of them.\n\nBy September, 1939, there had been around 75,000 people of Germanic origin in Britain, some 60,000 of whom were Jewish refugees seeking asylum, and despite having to report to the police, they were otherwise free to seek work and accommodation. However, on the outbreak of war it was decided that all Germans and Austrians were to appear before Enemy Alien Tribunals and thereby be initially categorised into three classes; ‘A’ - those who were overtly hostile, ‘B’ - those who seemed to pose no immediate threat, although their movements were restricted and a curfew imposed, and ‘C’ - German or Austrian nationals who had been resident in the country for at least six years, and political or racial refugees from the Continent. Yet in preparation for long term internment in January, 1940, the Home Secretary, Sir John Anderson, reported that no place in the British Isles was sufficiently remote from areas of military significance, and indeed this scenario was soon compounded by the tensions following the German breakthrough in Europe in May, 1940. Those aliens in the ‘A’ category were immediately imprisoned, those of the ‘B’ class, of German or Austrian descent, rounded up, and the majority of the ‘C’ class sent, during the next few weeks, to various camps. With the entry of Italy into the war on June 11th, 1940, large numbers of Italians, many of whom had lived in Britain for several years, were also reclassified from aliens to enemy aliens and, although Churchill instructed Anderson to immediately detain all Italian males, the overall process of internment proved disappointingly slow, a situation not greatly helped when the Home Policy Committee of the Cabinet decided to immediately intern all male enemy aliens aged between 16 and 60. The roundup began on June 25th, and to help solve the problem of providing suitable accommodation facilities would be used on the Isle of Man where, during World War One, wooden huts erected at Knockaloe had been used as an internment camp. However, for World War Two it was initially decided that 30 houses, suitably guarded, should now be requisitioned for the purpose, and regarding the Isle of Man, in other measures to assist the war effort the Isle of Man steam packet, ‘Mona’s Queen’, had evacuated 1,420 men from Dunkirk, but was sunk three days later.\n\nIn the continuing blitz on British cities by the Luftwaffe, the Portsmouth premises of Dr. Blumenau had been bombed and, with all his equipment destroyed he was directed to North Buckinghamshire. Arriving at Bletchley on September 26th, 1941, he subsequently lodged with the local headmaster, Mr. E.C. Cook, in Church Walk, and beginning regular work as a dentist on October 15th was appointed as the school dentist for North Buckinghamshire, with responsibility for some 40 schools. He had brought with him ‘a most fascinating huge baroque wardrobe’, decorated with colourful angels and cherubs, and this Mrs. Cook was proud to display in the hall, as part of the effects presumably sent over by his first wife, following his arrival in England. In his study in the front bedroom stood an equally ornate desk, and amongst his other possessions were several fine impressionist paintings, book cases, a music stand and, (he being a keen musician, with a large collection of records), his ‘very fine viola’. In fact becoming friends with many people at Bletchley Park, (especially ‘two delightful Irish women’, Doreen Henderson and Dorothy Atkinson), he would be warmly invited to join their music societies. Air raid alerts and mock gas attack alarms were a continuing feature of daily school life, yet educational standards were still being upheld despite the war and, followed by a visit from the Assistant Secretary for Education, Mr. Haynes, the qualifying test of the Secondary School Examination took place at 10p.m. on February 9th. As for the recent arrivals in the town, appropriately on St. Paul’s Day the evacuated children of St. Paul’s School enjoyed a day’s holiday, which included a morning service in St. Martin’s Church. However, although many of the evacuees had settled into their new surroundings a few seemed somewhat unsettled by their unfamiliar environment, and one Tuesday morning in February five homesick children from an Islington family left their Bletchley billets and began to walk home! They were eventually found at 7p.m. 29 miles away at South Mimms, and were brought home in a police car. Two of the evacuees had been billeted with Mr. & Mrs. Collyer of 19, Osborne Street, whilst another, a boy aged 12, had been staying with Mr. & Mrs. Battams, at no. 39. Two other boys were in the care of Mr. & Mrs. Essam, of 20, North Street, and with all the children having gone to school as normal that day, even when they did not return this initially raised little concern, since it was assumed that they had stayed for dinner.\n\nUnderstandably, school attendance was now closely monitored. However, school standards were also kept under regular scrutiny and on February 23rd the report was received on Needlework Instruction. This followed a visit by the Organiser of Needlework in the county on June 9th the previous year, and pleasingly the comments proved favourable; ‘The tuition given in each group is effective and neatness encouraged. Processes are introduced progressively and are pleasingly carried out by the children.’ As for the report on Physical Training, following a visit on December 18th by the County Organiser for P.T., this was also encouraging and ‘Although this school is working double sessions it has been found possible to keep to the daily physical training period.’ With ‘Standard 1’ in the charge of an L.C.C. teacher, he ‘most sensibly kept the class very active’, and, rounding off a general praise, the visit on February 28th by Mrs. Helen Reynolds reported that ‘The classes have been inspected and everything found in order. The children appear very happy. Many absent due to sickness.’ Yet also through illness the headmaster, Mr. William Crisp, would also be shortly absent for a week. For some while St. Martin’s Hall had now been established as a school for evacuees, but the Secretary of the St. Martin’s Hall Committee, Mrs. McLeod, seemed far from happy. In fact she reported that this was ‘not a good thing for them at the moment’, since the Committee was spending £1 7s 6d per week just on coke. When the Vicar then enquired how often the Education Authority paid for the use of the Hall, Mrs. McLeod replied that in response to her request for an agreement and money, no answer had as yet been received. On a brighter note, with Mr. J. Crouch having now joined the Junior School as ‘Unattached Staff’, a colourful and cultural occasion took place one Saturday evening at the beginning of March, with the staging of a Welsh night in the Bletchley Senior School hall. Attracting an audience of 200 the event had been arranged by five Welsh teachers on the Bletchley and London school staffs, and the designs inside the school included the appropriate combination of red dragons and leeks. Then in a continuing emphasis of this theme in addition to the National Anthem at the conclusion of the evening the Welsh national anthem was also sung - in Welsh! No doubt this all proved rather emotional for Mr. Benjamin Davies who, as a master at the Bletchley Road Senior School since January 31st, 1938, was now shortly to leave for a teaching position in North Wales, at Penygoddfa Council school, in Newtown. Nicknamed ‘Big Ben’, on account of his popularity, in fact this was his home town, and heightening the sentiments in April the ladies of the Bletchley Parents’ Association Committee gave him a farewell dinner. At his departure in May the schoolchildren and staff would then present him with a gold wristlet watch and a propelling pencil, and perhaps the farewell celebrations would include renditions on the new school piano, which on March 11th had been received from the makers, Barratt and Robinson Ltd., of 288/310 York Road, Kings Cross, N7. At the Bletchley Road Senior School evacuation matters were still occupying the attention of the headmaster, Mr. E.C. Cook, for on March 4th he had attended an afternoon conference at Aylesbury. Then the following day, in order to discuss evacuation matters, and also the establishment of a sick bay, he met both an Inspector from the Ministry of Health and one of their medical officers, and concluding his travels on March 18th he attended another afternoon conference which, with Aylesbury again as the venue, had been convened by Miss E. Ford to discuss the ‘Leisure of Evacuated Children.’\n\nThe schools closed for the Easter Holiday on March 20th and, as a further bonus, from April 1st arrangements were begun to supply free milk ‘to necessitous, undernourished children’ in the town. On April 2nd the schools then reopened at 9a.m., and Mrs. E. Jones now joined the staff of the Juniors as a supply teacher. She would replace Mrs. Martin who, being a London County Council teacher, had received instructions to return to London. As for the school activities, a quantity of needlework material had been received from Messrs. Leighton and Baldwin Ltd., and from April 9th the timetable of Std. 2a (Class 5) was modified to allow work in connection with a ‘Centre of Interest’ on farms and farming. Pastures new were now also in sight for Miss Capell, for she had been deputed to take charge of Drayton Parslow School from April 15th until Friday, April 19th. Meanwhile, at the Bletchley Road Senior School, from the 15th Mr. E.C. Cook and Miss E. Hope were off to a ‘Special Course for Senior Schools’, held at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, and in their absence Mr. E. Jones would take charge. However, this timing proved rather unfortunate since, late on the night of Friday, April 19th, the school was burgled. Forced entry had been attempted at several locations, and with a window broken in the Men’s Staff Room and the Lady Teachers’ Room several rooms were entered, including that of the headmaster, where milk money to the value of 1s 10d was stolen. The break in had been discovered by the caretaker early on Saturday morning, and the matter was swiftly reported to the police. As for the school at St. Martin’s, in early May Sir Sydney Nicholson, Director of the School of English Church Music, paid a visit as part of a tour of affiliated choirs, and also during April the Council agreed that children on holiday could use the local tennis courts at half price. This would be during the mornings whilst, regarding other recreations, speaking in May at the A.G.M. of the Bletchley Schools Sports Association, (which had been started the previous year), Mr. E. Cook now affirmed the decision to carry on with the organisation. Being open to all members of the teaching staff membership included not just the Senior School ‘but also of its contributing Junior partners’ and in addition the Evening Institute, children under the age of 16 and the Parents’ Association, which had so far paid out £59 5s 2½d for sports club equipment, principally concerned with tennis and cricket. Their wish was to now have the Club run separately, but it would be another wish that was more immediately granted when permission was given for cricket to be played in Bletchley Park by the Bletchley and London schoolchildren. In fact it was also hoped that matches would be arranged for the men employed at Bletchley Park.\n\nOn May 10th instructions were received that, due to the ‘International Situation’, the arrangements for the Whitsun holiday were cancelled. However, because of the late arrival of the message Mr. Kenneth Davies had already left for his home in South Wales, and had to be recalled by telegram. The instructions for cancellation had been relayed by the School Correspondent, Mr. Ernest Marchant, who, having served during World War One in the 18th Royal Fusiliers - the Public Schools Fusiliers, was a man of considerable military experience. Later in the war he had joined the Middlesex Regiment as an officer, and on being wounded was taken prisoner during an unsuccessful attack on Friday, November 13th, 1916. However, his view of the Germans became slightly softened when a German corporal, on his way to the trenches, took out a bottle of cognac and shared it with him and a couple of other prisoners. During his captivity Ernest made two unsuccessful attempts at escape, and after the war, having been admitted to the roll of solicitors in 1913 he joined a firm in Ramsgate before acquiring, in 1924, the ‘relics’ of a former practice in Bletchley. He then made his home at Woburn Sands, and during World War Two would make the Woburn Sands platoon of the Home Guard his special responsibility. There had been much confusion over the cancellation of the Whitsun holiday but the children were now to report on Monday, May 13th, at 9a.m., whilst should a second evacuation from London take place then Mr. Crisp was to report to Wolverton Secondary School. However, on May 13th a radio broadcast to schools then announced that those premises within neutral and reception areas should be closed that day, and in view of this only 50% of the Junior children turned up. Yet all the staff attended, except Mrs. Ounsworth, Mr. Richards and Mr. Crouch, who explained that they had acted in accordance with the broadcast. Clarifying the confusion, after consultation the Managers then issued instructions that the school should indeed be closed for the day! The tensions of war were now beginning to heighten. Accordingly the staff and children of the Junior School received A.R.P. instruction on May 22nd, and those at the Senior School on May 24th, but thankfully the schoolwork appeared to not suffer unduly, and following a visit on May 27th the Managers reported themselves ‘pleased with work done and pleased that Mr. Crisp and staff work so well together which makes for best results.’\n\nDue to the international situation, on May 31st as a result of instructions received from the Superintendent of Police came the postponement of the Bletchley Road Senior School sports day, and also the cancellation of the second annual sports day of the Junior School, which had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday, June 4th. However, away from sporting pursuits in the quest for academic excellence four Senior and four Junior School boys were awarded places at the end of May in a ‘Central School.’ This followed the recommendation of their headmasters, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Lewis, and now billeted in the town the boys had all arrived from London schools. They would now be able to remain at school until the age of 16, although since the nearest evacuated London Central School was the relocated Marylebone School, the boys were to be consequently re-billeted in Buckingham. By early June, at the Bletchley Road Senior School ‘every precaution possible has been taken with regard to air raids in a practical way’, but the schools now received an official instruction to close until further notice at the end of the afternoon session on Wednesday, June 12th. This was by terms of Circular Letter 471/1940 although the staff would still be required to report for duty since, to provide occupation for the children, the building would remain open during normal hours, and in addition parties of boys at the Senior School were organised for farm work. However, the school registers would not be marked, and also on the question of paperwork on June 14th the Junior School took proud delivery of a ‘Rotary Hand Feed Duplicator.’ During June, emphasising the national crisis it was decided to close the schools if continuous air raids took place on the country, and not surprisingly the threat of air attack lead to an acceleration of the protective precautions that were now being taken. In fact as a further inconvenience a shortage of staff was the result of the continuing call up of teachers into the Forces, and just one example was that of a former Bletchley Road Junior School master, Mr. Cyril Evans. Having recently taken a teaching appointment in Shrewsbury, he had now opted to join the R.A.F. as a P.T. instructor.\n\nYet despite the tensions of the time morale remained high and, encouraged by the Government’s Cog Scheme, during the war children would be asked to collect salvage. Even a special song was composed - ‘There’ll always be a Dustbin’ - and, with books for the troops also required, an opportunity for publications to be collected was presented by the Empire Day festivities at the Bletchley Road Infants’ School. The pupils were asked to collect printed matter of any description, and with a certain amount collected the child would then receive a cardboard ‘Corporal’ badge. In fact the more books they collected the higher their elevation in rank, and as one former pupil recalled; ‘although very timid at that age, I knocked on all the houses in the street where I lived and also asked family and friends if they would turn out their bookshelves and everyone obligingly gave me their books. I collected more than 100 and was elevated, I believe, to Colonel and also received a certificate.’ Continuing the theme of Empire Day, read by the headmaster, Mr. Cook, the Bletchley Senior scholars were assembled to hear an especial Empire Day message from Viscount Bledisloe, President of the Empire Day Movement, and a similar message was delivered to the Junior children. Meanwhile, for the celebrations at the Ecclesbourne Road Infants’ School decorations adorned the Spurgeon Memorial Baptist Hall, and all the children took part in hymns, songs and recitals. Other activities also helped to promote a general optimism, and in June several foster mothers attended a Friday afternoon entertainment, given by the Senior boys and girls of the London schools in the Temperance Hall. However, sadly tempering the mood the death occurred at the end of the month of Mrs. Harriet Lewis, the wife of Mr. J. Lewis, headmaster of the evacuated St. Paul’s School. Since November she had lived at the home of Mr. & Mrs. H. Thomas, in Aylesbury Street.\n\nOld Bletchley Church of England School.\n\nIn 1838 the school held in Rectory Cottages was discontinued and became united to the National Society, which encouraged education based on church principals. Through a grant provided by the Society, on a site previously known as Long Croft a school complete with a teacher's house was then constructed in Church Green Road in 1840, the land having been purchased for a nominal 5s. A rebuilding occurred in 1864, an enlargement in 1885, and in\n\n1892 the school was converted into two private houses.B.C.H.I.\n\nDespite A.R.P. and gas mask drills now being part of the school routine, as normally as possible education continued, and 16 new desks were received for the Junior School on July 5th. As for examinations, as a result of those for entrance to the County Secondary Schools 16 pupils received special awards, and 10 candidates qualified for admission as fee payers to Wolverton Secondary School, and The Cedars School at Leighton Buzzard. As for other academic achievements, during July as a pupil of Miss Sybil Keymer, Miss Betty Metcalfe of 10, Water Eaton Road, passed the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music Grade 7 (advanced) for violin playing. With the ceremony taking place at Holy Trinity Church, Wolverton, (which was the home town of his bride), another cause for celebration then occurred at the end of the month with the marriage of Mr. Eric Jones, who for several years had been a popular master at Bletchley Senior School. Marriage was also pending for another local teacher, Miss Ivy Le Min, who had been on the staff of the Old Bletchley Church of England School since September, 1937. On becoming Mrs. J.S. Harrington she then resigned to join her husband, (an Australian, from Sydney), in Rugby, and subsequently Mrs. Zilpah Bailey, an assistant teacher at the Tonman Mosley School, of Slough, would be appointed as the replacement headmistress. In fact for the pupils of the school extra accommodation had now been sought at the Yeomanry Hall and with Mrs. Bailey commencing her duties at the beginning of December, one of her first activities would be to set up a Cigarette Fund for local men serving in the Forces. As a child, when aged five Zilpah had to walk 3½ miles each day to attend her school in Huntingdonshire, but she eventually won a scholarship to Ramsey Grammar School and there she stayed until the age of 16½. She next became a student teacher at her village school, and then at the age of 18 trained at Homerton College, Cambridge, with her grandmother paying the fees. Having taught senior school children in Hertfordshire she left the profession for six years to bring up her daughter, but in 1934 came to Buckinghamshire and resumed her career, firstly at Chesham and then at Slough. Bletchley was to be her next teaching appointment, and she would eventually retire as the headmistress of the Old Bletchley Church of England School after 20 years. As for others of the local teaching staff the prospect of being ‘called up’ now loomed, and on July 30th Mr. J. Crouch, an unattached assistant teacher at the Junior School, attended an interview at the War Office. This was by permission of the Managers and also absent was a fellow colleague, Mr. A. Richards, who was to join his R.A.F. unit the following day.\n\nFor two weeks holiday, on August 2nd at 4p.m. the Bletchley schools closed until August 19th and no doubt this proved an ideal opportunity for 15 year old Joe Birtle, of 22, Water Eaton Road, to make his aeroplane models of two Spitfires, two Fairey Battles, a Westland Lysander and a Messerschmitt 109, all of which were subsequently displayed at the Water Eaton Co-op. Also taking advantage of the holiday was Helen Reynolds, who on a visit to the Bletchley Road Junior School on August 9th had found that ‘every possible precaution seems to be taken, in the event of an air raid, to ensure the protection of the children.’ Nevertheless, during the course of the war the town would be threatened by other aerial perils, and not only is a Lancaster bomber said to have crash-landed on Talbot’s Farm, near the Denbigh playing fields, but a Hawker Tempest allegedly nosedived into the ground just past the Blue Lagoon, with the engine penetrating 10 feet into the earth. As for the proceeds from Master Birtle’s models, these were now appropriately applied to the Spitfire Fund, and, regarding another local collection, towards the end of the month a Saturday social evening, held by the Parents’ Association in the Bletchley Road Schools, raised £1 6s 2d for the refugees’ charity.\n\nOn August 21st the report on Physical Instruction was received at the Bletchley Road Junior School, following a visit on July 12th. Regarding Standards III - IV Boys, ‘The teacher was keen and with vigorous encouragement and teaching gave the boys plenty of exercise of the right type.’ As for Standard 1, ‘This class was taken by a student teacher who, considering her limited experience, did satisfactory work. A demonstration was given to assist this teacher.’ Also in need of physical prowess was another member of staff, Mr. Crouch, who towards the end of the month gained leave of absence when called before the Army Medical Board. In view of the satisfactory results he would then receive his call up papers, and on leaving the school on September 27th his place would be taken by Mrs. B. Swain. The Junior School closed at 12 noon on August 30th for an occasional holiday, awarded for good attendance, whilst as for more permanent matters, on the same day Mrs. Joyce Ounsworth left the employment of the Education Authority. However, on September 2nd Miss K. Bonham, a Certificated Assistant from Newton Longville, commenced her duties at 9a.m., and regarding other staff movements, having completed her student teaching course on August 30th Miss E. Clark began her career by taking the place of Mr. Richards. Just before 11a.m., on September 3rd the sounding of a public air raid alarm coincidently marked the anniversary of the London schoolchildren’s arrival in the town, and during a tea at the Bletchley Road Infants’ School Mr. E. Jones, who had performed a great deal of work for the benefit of the evacuees, received a barometer in celebration of his endeavours. The gift was presented by the headmistress, Miss Workman, who with her staff had been responsible for arranging the event. In fact Miss Workman had been the headmistress at the Bletchley Infants’ School since 1927, and she would remain in the position until 1947 when, being replaced by Mrs. W. Simpson, she resigned due to her impending marriage.\n\nAir raid precautions were now increasingly important and, with A.R.P. practice having been taken in the playground on September 4th, on September 11th the air raid sirens sounded just after noon. Being supervised by members of staff 20 children returned to the Junior School, whilst in the Senior School children staying to canteen dinner continued their meal in the protected part of the building. The ‘all clear’ then sounded at 12.30 but the next day the sirens again sounded at 10.55a.m., with the children assuming their A.R.P. positions until the all clear was given at 11.15a.m. On September 16th the sirens heralded a possible raid at 2.40p.m. and again at 4.05p.m., and under the supervision of the staff all the children and parents in the vicinity took shelter in the school, until the all clear was given at 4.25p.m. Yet still the danger continued and on September 25th the sirens sounded at 11.10a.m. - ‘A.R.P. positions as usual’ - and although the all clear came at 11.25a.m., the following day witnessed warnings at 11.55a.m. and 3.45p.m., with the all clear on these occasions being given at 12.25p.m. and 4.15p.m. Indeed, a need to be aware of the dangers was tragically emphasised during the later period of the war, when a schoolboy in the town picked up a butterfly bomb in a local field. He lost several fingers as a result of his curiosity.\n\nOn September 27th the schools closed at 4p.m. for a week’s vacation. Yet for the Evacuation Secretary, at the end of the month he found his workload increased by the need to assist the billeting officer, Mr. E. Cook, headmaster of Bletchley Senior School, when accommodation had to be found for another 660 London schoolchildren and helpers. As told in the chapter ‘Far from Home’ they arrived from many parts of London on the evening of Sunday, September 29th, and at Bletchley were met by a fleet of vehicles, many of which had been lent to the evacuation committee by residents of the town. Including Miss Robinson and Miss Townsend, two London teachers who were allocated to the Bletchley Road Senior School, on October 9th the new arrivals soon began to settle into their unfamiliar surroundings, and in early November the children of St. Paul’s L.C.C. school, who were now working in St. Martin’s Hall, even donated £4 to the Spitfire Fund. Confirming the wisdom of the evacuation policy, throughout October frequent air raid alarms were sounded but on October 23rd Miss Workman, headmistress of the Infants’ Department, said that in future she would not allow the Junior School class to take up their positions in the Infants’ cloakroom. During an alert another location would have to be found but the alleged reason for this was strongly refuted by the teacher in charge, Miss Fowler, who denied that certain children had misbehaved. In any case, their antics could have been hardly more mischievous than those of some German schoolchildren who, by blowing down the spouts of watering cans, were imitating the sound of air raid sirens. However, one of the Senior School teachers, Mr. W. Hinton, would shortly be helping to sound the enemy sirens for real for, having been a specialist teacher in agriculture and horticulture, he had now volunteered for the R.A.F. as a wireless operator. When called for attestation by the Air Ministry he was consequently absent during October on Monday 21st, Tuesday 22nd and Wednesday 23rd, and after attending at Reading and Cardington he had now been accepted. A teacher at the school since April 24th, 1939, he would leave for the Forces on December 19th.\n\nAs a reward for the excellent results in the Secondary Schools Entrance Examination, the Managers granted the Junior School a holiday on November 1st, and on November 8th the school closed for a two day half term holiday, perhaps thereby providing a welcome interlude from the now almost regular routine of air raid alerts. Disruptions to school life were also being caused by the action of some of the pupils, and in December a boy of 12 was sent to an approved school for stealing two diaries from W. H. Smith & Co. Also stolen had been two packets of cigarettes and a box of matches from the premises of Doris Perrin, but when the charge of stealing was denied an assistant at the shop, Miss Gladys Bess, of 11, Duncombe Street, subsequently testified that she had noticed the cigarettes to be missing on November 23rd, after the boy had entered the shop several times in the company of some other lads. His defence was then hardly helped by his mother’s declaration that the boy ‘did not seem to have the sense he ought to have’! A frequent truant he led others astray and, although ‘domestic troubles’ were offered in mitigation, his parents were still ordered to pay 2s 6d per week for his maintenance. As for another 11 year old, having admitted the charge of theft he was sternly told to keep away from the other boys. He was said to be otherwise of good character, but his mother was probably less than good humoured when ordered to pay costs of 15s. On more law abiding matters a collection by Form 3a, at the Senior School, raised £1 18s 6d for the Spitfire Fund, which now stood at £475 5s 9d. Just before Christmas donations were then further encouraged when, over the course of a weekend, a captured German Messerschmitt 109 was displayed in the grounds of Bletchley Road Senior School. Admission cost 6d, or 3d for children, but for an extra 3d it was possible to sit in the cockpit. In order to transfer her household belongings from London, on December 12th Miss Townsend was granted leave of absence from her teaching position at the Senior School and, with the approach of the Christmas festivities, the schools were now beginning to hold their various break-up parties. That for the Bletchley Road Junior School took place on the afternoon of December 18th, held in the classrooms, and the previous Friday the corridor had been decorated in green and white, being further adorned by two tableaux, one of the Nativity and one of a snow scene. Over a period of two months, by bringing in small monetary amounts the children had helped to fund the parties, and the Parents’ Association had given £3 7s 6d. Each child then received a bag containing a roll, bun and mince pie, and with money left over from the previous Christmas in the Evacuation Fund having paid for these, this source now also provided the finance for a visit by the children to the Studio, at 10.30a.m. on December 20th. As for the celebrations at St. Paul’s Junior Mixed, the headmaster, Mr. J. Lewis, gave an impromptu concert in St. Martin’s Hall, whilst the Ecclesbourne Road Infants’ School, (which had been evacuated to the Spurgeon Memorial Baptist Church Hall), enjoyed their event on a Wednesday. Further enhancing the entertainments was the gift of a Christmas tree from the Duke of Bedford, and to close the year on Boxing Day a Christmas party took place in St. Martin’s Hall, where over 400 evacuees thoroughly enjoyed a good tea, dances and games.\n\nFrom March 3rd until further notice the Junior School would now commence at 9a.m., and close at 4p.m. However, this routine could well be interrupted by the continuing air raid alerts, although in as normal a manner as possible school life continued and on March 12th the L.C.C. Secondary School Exam was taken, with the sealed papers for the Secondary Schools’ Entrance Exam being received on March 17th. As for another type of examination, on March 24th and 25th the routine medical inspection was conducted by Dr. Stones, the Local Medical Officer. At the Bletchley Road Senior School, on March 24th the headmaster, Mr. E.C. Cook, received instructions to prepare a lunch for 100 evacuee children, who would be arriving on Tuesday, and the following day a special lunch was accordingly prepared. This consisted of vegetable stew, potatoes and jam tart, although in the event only 68 evacuees turned up, accompanied by six helpers. On April 1st, having been arranged by Mr. Higg, the Board of Education Inspector of Schools, the famous B.B.C. violinist, Arthur Catterall, then paid a visit to the Bletchley Road Junior School where, in the school hall, he not only listened attentively to the school percussion band, but also watched puppet shows. He then accompanied the various piano solos of his daughter, Yvonne, herself a talented musician, and following the visit Mr. Higg sent an appreciative letter to the headmaster, Mr. Crisp, proclaiming that ‘I need hardly say we were really thrilled by the warm and cordial reception you and your children gave us.’ In fact this seemed well in keeping with the character of Mr. Crisp for, being a ‘genial, smiling, exuberant teacher’, ‘his enthusiasm for his job bubbles over and flows right through the school.’ Mr. Crisp had begun his teaching career in North London and then, as a sports master and general subjects teacher, moved to a senior boys’ school in the Black Country town of Smethwick. In 1927 he then became Deputy Superintendent of the Smethwick Schools Campaign, (situated near the River Severn at Bewdley, Worcs.), which was an experiment to enable pupils from a highly industrialised area to receive a general education, but whilst camping in the country. In 1935 he then moved to Buckinghamshire and became headmaster at Stewkley school, being three years later appointed as headmaster at Bletchley Road Junior School.\n\nThe month of May witnessed a tide of rising morale when, through the Ship Adoption Society, the Bletchley Senior Schools claimed as their own the vessel S.S. Chelwood, commanded by Captain J.W. Wright. In consequence, on May 6th he paid a visit to the school and was entertained to lunch by the headmaster, Mr. E.C. Cook, and the staff. Elsewhere, perhaps of little surprise considering the traumas of wartime the Medical Officer had been in correspondence with Dr. Ethel Dukes, of the Institute of Child Psychology, about the need to provide appropriate treatment for ‘difficult’ children. The Council decided to accordingly establish a child psychology clinic in the town, and - with this also being the view of the A.R.P. Committee - an approach would be made to the County Health Department about using two of the rooms at the Bletchley Welfare Clinic. If the Ministry of Health granted the necessary approval then the arrangement would be continued until the end of the war, and it was hoped that the Evacuation Account would pay for Dr. Dukes’ travelling expenses, as well as Mrs. Hay’s fee of 10s 6d per visit as ‘play therapist’, with £5 being the sum needed for the play material. However, the news that they were not to bring small bottles of lemonade to school, and instead would have to use the tap in the recreation ground, where ‘there is no receptacle to drink from and a flood of water to stand in’, must hardly have helped the therapy of the evacuated children. In need of some rather different therapy was Mr. E.C. Cook, the headmaster of Bletchley Road Senior School, when at the end of the month he suffered several injuries and shock when involved in a motor accident. Whilst he was driving between Bicester and Oxford his car skidded into a ditch when he was forced to brake suddenly, but this misfortune seems not to have interfered with the running of the school for on May 29th a manager’s visit ‘found everything most satisfactory and a carrying out of gas mask drill enforced at proper intervals.’ At the end of May, for the town’s War Weapons Week the sums were raised by the children of the Bletchley Road schools of £18 10s from the Infants, £204 1s from the Juniors, (Group No. 1/9G/7), and £221 7s from the Seniors. Then also on school fiscal affairs, as recently discussed with Mr. Leonard, the Deputy Secretary for Education, the shower baths at the Bletchley Road schools were now being used by troops, a facility for which the Buckinghamshire Education Committee had decided to charge £5 for the water used in the past, and 10s per month for that to be used in the future. Music perhaps to an accountant’s ears, and also melodious to the ears was a rehearsal for the Junior School concert, held in the school hall at 2.30p.m. on May 23rd. The concert took place on May 26th, May 27th and May 28th at 7.15p.m., with the school then closing at 4.30p.m. on the following day for the Whitsun holiday. With all the staff present the premises would reopen on June 3rd, although Mr. Harding, a teacher at the school since 1937, was soon to attend an interview for the R.A.F. From 100 applicants, after the war he would then find a new employment at the new Holne Chase school, when appointed in 1951 as the headmaster. However, this status had already been achieved at a London Selective Central School by Mr. J. Reeve, who on June 12th, 1941, paid a visit to the Bletchley Road Senior School, where he interviewed several L.C.C. children selected for admission.\n\nFrom the beginning of July the vacancy for a full-time caretaker at the Bletchley Road Council School was advertised at a salary of £12 10s per month, plus 6% war bonus. With a caretaker’s house available at 7s 6d per week, (excluding rates), applicants were to contact Mr. Ernest Marchant, at ‘The Elms’, and the position of assistant part-time caretaker was also offered. Food for thought, on which topic on Wednesday, July 8th, having been sponsored by the Ministry of Food, and arranged by the Buckinghamshire Education Committee, Miss W. Evans, the domestic instructor, then gave as the second of six lectures an interesting cookery demonstration at the Bletchley Road Schools. This was on the theme of ‘Packed Lunches’, and in fact the pupils at the Senior School were helping to produce their own food by cultivating a school garden. However, whilst working on this patch a few days earlier one boy had been accidentally speared through the foot with a fork, when he inadvertently stepped into the way of another pupil. After medical attention he was then taken to his home at 38, Newton Road. Medical attention - to sore bottoms - was possibly also in need on June 26th when, without permission, several boys left the Senior School and ventured to the gravel pits, ‘one of the most dangerous places in the area.’ Two of the boys almost drowned when they fell in, and after assembling the school to warn against such folly the headmaster administered suitable punishment. For those pupils who had taken the Secondary School Entrance Examination, the results were received on July 10th, and 12 scholars had gained Special Places, with 15 candidates qualifying as fee paying pupils. In fact in recognition of this achievement on September 9th the School Correspondent, Mr. Ernest Marchant, wrote a congratulatory letter to Mr. Crisp, headmaster of the Junior School; ‘Dear Mr. Crisp, Your school’s most excellent record of successes in the recent Secondary Schools Entrance Examination was brought to the attention of the Managers at the meeting yesterday.’ Congratulations were to be conveyed on this ‘splendid performance’, and in a continuing exhibition of scholastic talent articles made by the classes were available for sale at the Bletchley Junior School annual Open Day, held on July 25th. A sale of needlework took place from 2.30p.m. until 4.30p.m., and with a microphone concert given from 3.10p.m. to 3.35p.m. country dancing was featured on the lawn from 3.40p.m. to 4.15p.m. However, some of the schoolchildren seemed possessed of a less constructive aptitude, and the teachers were subsequently asked to prevent them from swinging on the shop blinds! Presided over by Mr. W. Brown, chairman of the school managers, on July 29th the Bletchley Senior School speech day and prize distribution took place and Mr. E. Cook, the headmaster, said that this was the second speech day since the school had opened in 1938. As for Mr. W. Leonard, the Deputy Secretary of Education, he made it known to the gathered assembly that ‘The building of good character, the ability to think and the ability to acquire knowledge’ were the chief attributes of life.\n\nCelia was the daughter of Mr. E. Cook, the headmaster of Bletchley Road Senior School, and apart from his educational role during the war he was associated with Bletchley Park, not only as Food Officer, tasked to provide their entire provisions, but also as a messenger. Driving a camouflaged car, in which a small metal tube had been fitted in the engine compartment, he would take secret messages to Bomber Command Headquarters on Salisbury Plain, and returning from one such occasion one Friday evening he collected Celia for the weekend from her Oxford lodgings. Having to deliver a message to Bletchley Park, because it was late he suggested that since Celia did not have security clearance she should crouch down on the back seat of the vehicle and, covered by a rug, keep ‘mousy quiet.’ With the ruse proving effective, at the whisper of the codeword of the day, ‘candelabra’, the guards unsuspectingly waved the vehicle through, and Mr. Cook parked his car in front of the main entrance. As Celia would recall; “I waited an interminable time for him to come out of the building - it got to past midnight and I was terrified some duty officer would come and investigate the car.” However, at last Mr. Cook completed his duties and on the journey home Celia quite understandably vowed that “never again will I be a party to such subterfuge!” Indeed, the incident proved quite an education for all concerned. Also on educational matters the senior master of the Senior School, Mr. E. C. Jones, had now been appointed as housemaster at Water Stratford, and specialising in music, English and gardening he would then shortly move to the position of headmaster at Yardley Gobion school. He would then hold this position for six years, before returning to Bletchley. Having been involved with teaching at Bletchley for the past 14 years, he had not only begun the Book Lovers’ Circle and Old Scholars’ Literary and Debating Society, but also afforded much help when the Bletchley evacuees arrived. He had been the commander of the local 456 Squadron A.T.C. since its formation, and having the previous July married Frances Throssell, of Wolverton, would now continue to live at Old Stratford.\n\nAs headmistress of the Bletchley Road Infants’ School, in early October Miss Workman thanked the parents for those goods which had recently been sold by the children. Applied to the P.O.W. Fund the money raised came to more than £4 5s, and further assisting the war effort the Council now met to discuss a requirement for additional day nurseries. The underlying intention was to allow more married women to undertake work ‘of national importance’, and the need arose because the present Day Nursery was fully booked, and did not take children under the age of three. In early November a romance that had begun in 1939, at Swansea University College, culminated in the marriage of two of the graduates, Mr. Ken Davies and Miss Dilys Jenkins, a P.T. mistress at Fishguard. As the son of Mr. Martin Davies, of Lon Dan-y-Coed, Swansea, until joining the Forces Mr. Davies had been a games and history master at Bletchley Senior School whilst as for another of the Senior School teachers, Miss D. Browning B.A. now left for a position as headmistress at Frieth. The appointment would begin from the start of the New Year, and at Bletchley she had been an English mistress for the past five years. A visit was made on November 12th by Mr. Higg, the Board of Education Inspector, in connection with a visit of C.E.M.A., (the Council for the Encouragement of Music and Arts), and the following day at the Junior School the artists watched a programme of percussion and puppetry. Then during the afternoon Class 1 - in the charge of Miss Milsom and Miss Wing - made a visit to the Senior School, where they heard a reciprocal programme of music, given by the C.E.M.A. artists. Having previously been revived in 1925, mainly through the efforts of the president, Mr. A. Morris, the Workers’ Education Authority had been reformed in Bletchley during 1938. The aim was to provide the opportunity for further education, and in fact the origins dated from a public meeting held in the Bletchley Road schools during May, 1920, when, despite an attendance of only some 20 persons, a vote was duly taken, and a decision made to begin the branch. Classes were now being held for members of the Forces, and with a commendable dedication the lecturers even ventured to lonely searchlight and A.A. posts. Amongst the subjects, at the Bletchley Road schools a course in social psychology had been set up at the beginning of the year by Mr. A. Gordon Mackay, although the academic progress suffered a stumble when he injured his foot whilst taking a class. Unusual matters of a stranger kind were also afoot in the schools, for with these having supposedly been built on the site of the burial pits from the Great Plague, there always seemed a creepy feeling in the premises at night, and in fact on the evenings of the Institute classes whilst working late in his office the Senior School headmaster, Mr. Cook, would often hear knocks on the door, only to find that no one was there! Since the start of their National Savings Group, (in April, 1940), children of the Bletchley Road Junio"
