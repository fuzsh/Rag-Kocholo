        "text": "by John Wilmes\n\nThis round of Olympics basketball felt different (weightier, more grand) than usual. It might be the last time that America is the clear favorite.\n\nby Wes Goldberg\n\nKevin Durant has spent his NBA career touring the country, ingratiating himself to different fanbases before making a complicated exit. The through-line for it all has been his place on Team USA.\n\nby John Wilmes\n\nThe Nuggets very well will be like the 2024 Serbian national team: a hardly extraordinary collection, expanded to their strategic limits by the genius of their leader.\n\nby Jack Tien-Dana\n\nWhereas Jamal Murray once complemented Nikola Jokic, he's now wholly dependent on him; he's jerry-rigged his game around Jokic such that he can't stand on his own. Yet he remains irreplaceable for the Nuggets."
