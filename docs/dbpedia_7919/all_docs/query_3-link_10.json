        "text": "\"Sex and the City 2\" is a 2010 American romantic comedy musical film written, co-produced, and directed by Michael Patrick King. It is the sequel to the 2008 film Sex and the City.\n\nSex and the City 2 was released theatrically on May 27, 2010, in the United States and the following day in the United Kingdom. It was panned by critics but was a commercial success grossing $294 million on a $95 million production budget.\n\nOverview[]\n\nSarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon reprised their roles as friends Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda, while Chris Noth co-stars as Carrie's husband Mr. Big. It features cameos from Liza Minnelli, Miley Cyrus, Tim Gunn, Ron White, Omid Djalili, Penélope Cruz, Norm Lewis, and Kelli O'Hara.\n\nPlot[]\n\nCarrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda attend the wedding of their gay friends Stanford and Anthony. Three of the four women are now married themselves but Samantha, aged 52, is desperately trying to keep her libido alive as she enters menopause. The wedding is officiated by Liza Minnelli who also performs a musical number, and Carrie serves as Stanford's \"best man\". Back home, Miranda quits her job after her firm's misogynistic new managing partner disrespects her once too often. Charlotte's two children are a handful, mostly her two-year-old daughter Rose's extreme and constant crying, and she is worried that her husband Harry is attracted to their buxom Irish nanny, Erin. Carrie's marriage to Mr. Big has settled down, although they differ on how to spend their spare time. Carrie wants to go out often to dinner, parties and big events, whereas Big prefers to stay in and relax on the couch.\n\nFor their anniversary, Carrie gives Big a vintage Rolex watch engraved with the message “Me and You, Just Us Two” while he, much to her dismay, shows her a new TV in their bedroom as his gift, which Big says they can use to watch old films together, something they did at the hotel at Anthony and Stanford's wedding and seemed to enjoy. She is disappointed with Big's gift, as she had hoped for something more personal to show he realizes they must maintain the spark in the marriage. However, Big starts to watch TV more often, making Carrie feel unappreciated. In response she stays at her old apartment for two days to write an article, after which Big acts the way he did while they were first dating and they both enjoy a romantic night out. He enjoys it so much he suggests to Carrie that they take two days off every week, he can go somewhere for those two days to relax, watch TV and lie on the couch, and the rest of the time he will have more energy to do what she wants to do. Carrie does not dismiss this, but is hurt by the suggestion and worries it means they will drift apart.\n\nMeanwhile, Samantha is to devise a PR campaign for an Arab sheikh's business. He flies her and her friends on an all-expenses-paid luxury vacation to Abu Dhabi. Carrie is happy she will have time to think about Big's suggestion. Charlotte is worried about leaving her husband alone with the nanny. But Miranda, unfettered by a job for the first time in her life, is especially excited. Upon entering Abu Dhabi, Samantha's hormone-enhancing drugs are confiscated under United Arab Emirates law, rendering her devoid of estrogen and hindering her libido. Charlotte tries to call Harry every few minutes; Miranda revels in the culture surrounding her; and Carrie befriends her manservant, Gaurau, who is an underpaid temporary worker from India.\n\nOn a visit to a local souq (market), Carrie runs into her former lover, Aidan. He proposes dinner à deux at his hotel, and she accepts. The dinner is very enjoyable, with the two discussing old times. Aidan remarks on the ways Carrie is \"not like other women\". In a moment of remembered passion, they kiss. Carrie runs away in panic and returns to her hotel, where Miranda and Charlotte are having drinks together and discussing the difficulties of motherhood. When Carrie wonders whether she should tell Big about the kiss, as they have no secrets between them, Miranda reflects on when her husband Steve told her about his affair. Samantha counsels Carrie to wait before deciding anything. Carrie opts to call Big to tell him. Big is silent upon hearing the news, and after saying a few words, hangs up.\n\nThe four women find their Western style and attitudes clash with Muslim customs. For example, while on a date with a handsome Danish architect, Samantha is arrested for public display of affection after fondling him at a restaurant, giving him an erection in public and making out with him on the beach. With the Sheikh's intervention, Samantha is released but is left with a permanent police record. To make matters worse, the Sheikh cancels the PR meeting and ceases paying for the remainder of the women's luxurious stay. They quickly pack their bags and leave, but must return to the souq to find Carrie's passport that she accidentally left there when she ran into Aidan. When Samantha's liberal dress and western attitude incites an outraged mob among the local men, the women are rescued by a group of local Emirati women who share their sense of style hidden underneath their customary black robes. The Emirati women help to disguise the 4 American women in robes and veils so they can escape and make it to the airport in time.\n\nWhen Carrie returns home, she finds the bedroom TV removed and Big gone. She passes an anxious day, at the end of which he returns. Big tells her that although he was torn, he realizes that what she needs is something to remind her at all times that she is married. He hands her a jewelry box, which reveals an engagement ring set with a black diamond. When Carrie asks him why a black diamond, he says she is not like anyone else, echoing Aidan's earlier comment, showing he does appreciate her and they have not lost their spark.\n\nBig and Carrie combine their interests; Charlotte's nanny, Erin, turns out to be a lesbian and no threat to her marriage; Miranda finds a new job at a more laid-back and diverse law firm where she is appreciated; and Samantha remains unchanged, and even meets for sex on the beach with the Danish architect, this time in the Hamptons.\n\nCast[]\n\nSarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw\n\nKim Cattrall as Samantha Jones\n\nKristin Davis as Charlotte York\n\nCynthia Nixon as Miranda Hobbes\n\nChris Noth as Mr. Big\n\nDavid Eigenberg as Steve Brady\n\nEvan Handler as Harry Goldenblatt\n\nJason Lewis as Jerry \"Smith\" Jerrod\n\nJohn Corbett as Aidan Shaw\n\nLynn Cohen as Magda\n\nLiza Minnelli as Herself\n\nMiley Cyrus as Herself\n\nPenélope Cruz as Lydia\n\nDhaffer L'Abidine as Mahmud\n\nProduction[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nAfter months of speculation, the cast confirmed in February 2009 that a sequel was in the works. Filming began in August 2009 for a May 28, 2010 release. All four stars, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis, and Kim Cattrall will return in the sequel; Chris Noth has also officially signed on to reprise the role of Mr. Big. A significant amount of attention has been given to the fact that Cynthia Nixon's recent win at the Grammys in 2009 mean that an Oscar win for this film would make her a Showbiz Grand Slam Winner. It has been confirmed that Evan Handler will be returning as Harry Goldenblatt, David Eigenberg will play Steve Brady once more, Willie Garson will return as Stanford Blatch and Mario Cantone will again play Anthony Marentino, making the original cast almost complete. In addition Michael Patrick King will be writing and directing again, and Patricia Field will once again take charge of the costumes and wardrobe.\n\nFilming[]\n\nFilming in New York had been postponed to the end of July as Dubai authorities have refused clearance for filming in the emirate. As a result, production of this segment of the film will be in Morocco. All four leading ladies and other cast and crew were photographed filming scenes in Morocco in November 2009, where they had originally planned to shoot for 13 days, which had to be extended to almost 6 weeks.The sequel officially began filming on September 1, 2009 and continued until the end of 2009. Photos of all four leading women filming scenes around New York together and separately have emerged, featuring present-day scenes as well as a range of looks believed to be flashbacks from the earlier years of Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte's long-standing friendships. Images of Samantha in a wedding dress have also been released. Additionally, scenes featuring prominent characters such as Mr. Big, Magda, Smith Jerrod, Steve Brady and the children of Miranda and Charlotte have been filmed and photographed.\n\nCasting[]\n\nIt has been speculated that singer Victoria Beckham will appear in the sequel, after she turned down a cameo for the first film in 2007, because of the Spice Girls Tour, though this has yet to be confirmed. Oscar-winner Penélope Cruz has been reported to appear briefly as Lydia, a banker. In September 2009, American singer/actress Liza Minnelli confirmed to several media outlets that she will be appearing in a cameo role, and that singer/actress Barbra Streisand will also appear. Singer/actress Bette Midler has been photographed on set, and was speculated to play the role of Carrie's mother, which she denied, stating she was on the set to support her daughter who was working on the film's production. Teen pop sensation Miley Cyrus will have one scene where she appears at the premiere of Smith Jerrod's new film, wearing the same dress as Samantha. On October 17 Oceanup.com posted several pictures of Miley filming the scene. John Corbett was seen on location in Morocco, confirming his speculated involvement in the film as Aiden.\n\nRelease[]\n\nPromotion[]\n\nPromotion for the film began in December 2009, when the official teaser poster was released online, featuring Carrie in a white dress and gold sunglasses which reflect a Moroccan backdrop, and the tagline \"Carrie On\", a similar pun of the lead character's name as 2008's \"Get Carried Away\" from the first film. The same image and tagline was used for the launch of the official Sex and the City 2 website, also launched in December 2009.\n\nThe teaser trailer for the film premiered online on 22 December 2009, featuring current New York City themed hit \"Empire State of Mind\" by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys.\n\nTrivia[]"
