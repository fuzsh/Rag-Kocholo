        "text": "As I have gone through each year in film, both in covering the year, and later, in covering the Oscar nominees for Best Picture, I have included very little of my own nominees. Partially it’s because I don’t want to throw too much of my own stuff in these and partially because I included all of my own nominees in my History of the Academy Awards series as I covered each category.\n\nBut, as I finish each decade, I’d like to take a look back and cover the best of each decade in each category. So, I’ll go with each current Oscar category (other than documentaries and shorts) and I’ll list my top 5 covering an entire decade (in this case, covering all of film history up until 1929).\n\nBecause I’m covering a whole decade at a time, I am doing away with my requirement to keep to Academy eligible years and I just go with the original release date.\n\n1894 – 1929\n\nTotal Films I’ve Seen: 193\n\nFilms that Make the Top 5 in a Category: 34\n\nBest Film to Not Make Any Category List: The General (1928, dir. Buster Keaton)\n\nBest Animated Film: Only one feature length animated film still survives from this era. It is The Adventures of Prince Achmed, which is good, but doesn’t score high enough to get a nomination from me.\n\nBest Foreign Film:\n\nMetropolis\n\nThe Battleship Potemkin\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\n\nNosferatu\n\nThe Last Laugh\n\nBest Song: As far as I can tell, there aren’t songs from this era that written for film.\n\nBest Makeup:\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\n\nThe Golem\n\nNosferatu\n\nBest Costume Design:\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\n\nCabiria\n\nNibelungen: Siegfried\n\nThe Man Who Laughs\n\nBest Visual Effects:\n\nNibelungen: Siegfried\n\nThe Thief of Bagdad\n\nBen-Hur\n\nMetropolis\n\nFaust\n\nBest Art Direction:\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\n\nMetropolis\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera\n\nGreed\n\nFoolish Wives\n\nBest Sound:\n\nThe Gold Rush\n\nIn Old Arizona\n\nThe Jazz Singer\n\nBest Original Score:\n\nThe Gold Rush (Charlie Chaplin)\n\nThe Circus (Charlie Chaplin)\n\nThe Kid (Charlie Chaplin)\n\nnote: Of course, most film didn’t have scores back then and even The Gold Rush and The Kid didn’t originally have scores, but Chaplin went back and wrote scores for them (the Gold Rush score even earned an Oscar nomination when it was re-released with the score and sound in 1942).\n\nBest Cinematography:\n\nSunrise\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\n\nNosferatu\n\nGreed\n\nThe Battleship Potemkin\n\nBest Editing:\n\nThe Battleship Potemkin\n\nNosferatu\n\nSunrise\n\nThe Birth of a Nation\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nBrigitte Helm (Metropolis)\n\nEvelyn Brent (The Last Command)\n\nZasu Pitts (Greed)\n\nZasu Pitts (The Wedding March)\n\nnote: Most early films focused on the leading roles and I find it hard to notice good performances in the supporting categories. It’s something I’ll try to look for at a later date when I don’t have so much going on. But for now, these are the performances I think are worthy of mention.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nWilliam Powell (The Last Command)\n\nDonald Crisp (Broken Blossoms)\n\nnote: Like with Supporting Actress, I find it hard to notice early supporting performances because of the way the films were made.\n\nBest Actress:\n\nJanet Gaynor (Sunrise)\n\nMaria Falconetti (The Passion of Joan of Arc)\n\nJanet Gaynor (Seventh Heaven)\n\nLilian Gish (Broken Blossoms)\n\nGloria Swanson (Queen Kelly)\n\nLilian Gish (The Wind)\n\nJanet Gaynor (Street Angel)\n\nGloria Swanson (Sadie Thompson)\n\nLilian Gish (The Birth of a Nation)\n\nMary Pickford (Coquette)\n\nnote: There are 10 nominees because of the multiple performances from Gaynor, Gish and Swanson\n\nBest Actor:\n\nEmil Jannings (The Last Command)\n\nCharlie Chaplin (The Gold Rush)\n\nLon Chaney (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)\n\nEmil Jannings (The Last Laugh)\n\nErich von Stroheim (Foolish Wives)\n\nLon Chaney (The Phantom of the Opera)\n\nMax Schreck (Nosferatu)\n\nnote: there are 7 nominees because of the multiple nominations for Jannings and Chaney\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nThe Gold Rush\n\nMetropolis\n\nThe Battleship Potemkin\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\n\nFoolish Wives\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nGreed (from the novel McTeague)\n\nSunrise (from the original theme “Die Reise nach Tilsit”)\n\nNosferatu (from the novel Dracula)\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera (from the novel)\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame (from the novel Notre-Dame du Paris)\n\nBest Director:\n\nFritz Lang (Metropolis)\n\nSergei Eisenstein (The Battleship Potemkin)\n\nErich von Stroheim (Greed)\n\nF.W. Murnau (Sunrise)\n\nD.W. Griffith (The Birth of a Nation)\n\nBest Picture:\n\nMetropolis\n\nThe Battleship Potemkin\n\nSunrise\n\nGreed\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\n\nFilms That Earn Best of Decade Nominations (Winners in Bold):\n\nMetropolis (1926, dir. Fritz Lang)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Supporting Actress, Art Direction, Visual Effects, Foreign Film\n\nThe Battleship Potemkin (1926, dir.

Paul Leni)\n\nCostume Design\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920, dir. John Robertson)\n\nMakeup\n\nThe Golem (1920, dir. Carl Boese)\n\nMakeup\n\nActress of the Decade:\n\nJanet Gaynor\n\nShe did it with only three roles, but she was so captivating, so amazing at such a young age (she was only 21), that she swept in and won the Oscar, with all three roles being noted. She could play the young lover or the young wife who is being spurned for a more sophisticated lover. While Lilian Gish gave more good performances, Gaynor was so amazing that she takes this award with ease.\n\nActor of the Decade:\n\nEmil Jannings\n\nHe not only gave the best performance of the decade as the fallen general in The Last Command, but he also played Othello and had his three great performances for F.W. Murnau (The Last Laugh, Tartuffe, Faust). He could storm around the set with the best of them and with Tartuffe and the later scenes in The Last Command, he could also evoke our sympathy. His later fall from grace with his embracing of the Nazi regime doesn’t erase how great his early performances were.\n\nDirector of the Decade:\n\nF.W. Murnau\n\nHe ends up with 8 films in the top 100 of the decade, including 2 in the top 10 and 4 in the top 20, and that’s even with many of his films from this era completely lost. We can only imagine what 4 Devils or Der Januskopf (his version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) could have been like. But his Sunrise rightfully won the Best Artistic Quality of Production. Nosferatu is one of the greatest of all Horror films. And his films with Emil Jannings are classics. Griffith might have more films in the top 100, but Murnau’s films were always there at the top.\n\nTop 100 Films of the Decade:\n\nMetropolis (1926, Fritz Lang)\n\nThe Battleship Potemkin (1926, Sergei Eisenstein)\n\nSunrise (1927, F.W.
