        "meta_description": "Softcover/Paperback - 1920 - Condition: Good - Great image on this arcade/exhibit card. Post card back. Sex is a 1920 silent drama film directed by Fred Niblo, written by C. Gardner Sullivan, produced by J. Parker Read, and starring Louise Glaum. On its surface, the film was a morality story on the evils of marital infidelity. However, the film producer, J. Parker Read, had made a series of pictures on sex themes. The release of Sex, with its provocative title and explicit scenes of seduction and debauchery, made it the subject of controversy among censors and commentators. Louise Glaum (September 4, 1888 ? November 25, 1970) was an American actress. Best-known for her role as a femme fatale in silent era motion picture dramas, she was credited with giving one of the best characterizations of a vamp in her early career. ABOUT ARCADE/EXHIBIT CARDS: From the early 1900 to the 1960 these cards were sold for a penny each in arcade machines. These cards were almost always black and white or some type of single color toned cards. They issued cards on a variety of subjects, but the most sought after cards feature movie stars, cowboys and boxers. The method of distribution of Arcade/Exhibit cards was unique in the first half of the 20th century. Until the period after World War 2, Americans did not have the incredible variety of home-delivered amusements that we find common today. Only radio provided home entertainment beginning in the 1920. When people wanted something to do, people left their homes for movie theaters, boardwalks, and arcades. Every town had annual fairs or carnivals that had arcade tents. ESCO manufactured amusement machines for those places: fortune telling machines, prize machines, scales, pin-balls, etc. It most historic development was the card dispensing machine. Exhibit cards were the first nationally distributed trading card product sold without any ancillary uses or purposes. The cards were not for advertising nor were they product premiums. They themselves were the product.A carnival or arcade owner purchased an ESCO vending machine and ESCO sold them refill products for the machines. ESCO made its real money on the refill orders, not on the machines. The cards were dispensed for a penny (later, a nickel or dime) to the patron of the arcade. ESCO sold refill cards direct to vendors. There was no permanent place where you could get these cards in most cities. Usually buyers had to wait for a carnival or fair to hit town to have access to the cards. This limited availability has made many of these cards quite scarce today and in recent years they have become very desirable collectors items. In the silent movie era many cards were issued with Post Card backs. Size of card is about 3 1/4' x 5 1/2'. - GRADE: G+ - SEX-LOUISE GLAUM-ARCADE CARD-1920-SILENT FILM! G",
