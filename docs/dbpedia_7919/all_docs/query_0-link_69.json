        "text": "A rare screening of the 1920 hit with live musical act and film accompaniment by Cliff Retallick!\n\nDirected by Fred Niblo (The Mark of Zorro, Blood and Sand, Ben-Hur), and produced by J. Parker Read and the legendary Thomas H. Ince, Sex features one of the silent screen’s most exotic vamps, lovely Louise Glaum, as the star of the Midnight Follies at Broadway’s Frivolity Theater, where she performs the scandalous Spider Dance.\n\nCo-producer J. Parker Read was a veteran of the vamp genre, having already been responsible for a series of similarly-themed box office successes. Like many films of the 1920s, Sex used a moralistic framework to avoid censorship of its exploitative scenes of seduction and debauchery, which were quite controversial a century ago. Louise Glaum’s character ends a marriage, then leaves her lover for a wealthier prospect only to have her selfish way of life come back to haunt her.\n\nIn 2004, Los Angeles Times film critic Kevin Thomas wrote: “Six years before Mae West dared to call her play Sex, Thomas Ince produced and Fred Niblo directed a 1920 film called Sex, starring pioneering screen vamp Louise Glaum as a New York cabaret star, the mistress of a married man. What gives the film its edge is that in truth she is simply a blunt, honest woman who doesn’t realize her own vulnerability.”\n\nPlus a live musical act and live film accompaniment by Retroformat Musical Director Cliff Retallick! Join us for the 100th Anniversary of Sex!"
