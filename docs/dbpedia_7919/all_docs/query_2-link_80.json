        "text": "Oh, I’m going to get some abuse over this post!\n\nI confess that I don’t think I have ever seen a more preposterous film than the 1924 silent The Red Lily, written and directed by Fred Niblo, and starring Ramon Novarro and Enid Bennett. This following contains considerably spoilers, which are likely to stop you enjoying the film if you haven’t yet seen it – however, quite why you would enjoy the film anyway is something we don’t have time to argue about. But I will give a full summary of the story, so you can see the merits of the film. Or not.\n\nRamon Novarro and Enid Bennett live in a French village. Novarro is the mayor’s son, Bennett is the cobbler’s daughter. They are madly in love, but the mayor won’t allow them to marry. The cobbler dies, meaning that Bennett has to go and live with some other relations in a nearby village. (Quite why, as a grown woman, she can’t look after herself is something we don’t know.)\n\nWhen she arrives at her new home, she finds that the family she is now to live with is ruled by a husband and wife who are a dab hand at domestic abuse. When the husband comes after Bennett with a whip, she runs off back to her old house, which is now empty. Novarro spots the light in the window, and goes to see what’s going on (lucky he was passing, really). He comforts Bennett as they sit in front of the fire, but nosey neighbours believe they have slept together (quite why when they can plainly see they have spent the night clothed and in front of the fire is anybody’s guess). When they are discovered the next morning, Novarro tells his father that they will marry, no matter what – but the mayor thinks this is only happening because they have slept together, and so Novarro and Bennett run off to Paris to get hitched.\n\nIt’s at this point that the film falls apart and becomes even more unsavoury. At the Paris train station, Novarro says he is going to find out where they can get married (obviously that’s more important than finding somewhere to live in a city where they know no-one). He leaves Bennett for a few minutes, at which point he is arrested on suspicion of robbing his father (he didn’t do it). While he eventually escapes from the police, nearly a day has passed. He arrives at the station just as Bennett leaves, and they don’t see each other because a stone pillar is separating them. (Yes, it’s that sort of film.)\n\nThey wander the streets of Paris. She gets a cleaning job, but is fired when she refuses to sleep with her boss. She makes her way to the banks of the Seine, where she sits down on a bench. Behind her is Novarro, gazing out into the river. Despite only being about ten feet from each other, they don’t spot each other. Yes, it’s still that sort of film.\n\nNovarro turns to crime. She contemplates suicide, but becomes a prostitute instead. (No, I’m not making this up). One night, Novarro and Bennett are reunited. But he is so repulsed by the ageing, weary woman she has become that, instead of running into her arms, he hits her in the face. (I’m really not making this up.) Shortly after, he gets shot by the police, and Bennett nurses him back to health. During this time, he verbally and mentally abuses her and then walks out on her, returning to his criminal friends.\n\nShe follows, and is there when the police raid. She gets shot saving Novarro, and Novarro escapes into the sewers. When he returns to the bar full of criminals, he is told that Bennett is in hospital, dying. He goes there to see her, and is arrested at her bedside.\n\nTwo years later, she has miraculously recovered and is doing rather well as a seamstress. Novarro is recently out of prison. He arrives there in a nice new suit and a bunch of flowers. They return to their village a married couple, and live happily after.\n\nQuite what anyone was thinking making such (rather unsavoury) tosh is anybody’s guess. Novarro was put into some pretty potty vehicles towards the end of his career, but this shows that he was in some potty ones at the beginning too. At this point (1924), we was basically being viewed as a poor (wo)man’s Rudolph Valentino. But we can see even through this ridiculous movie that Novarro was easily the better actor. Despite this idiotic fare, he manages to somehow make something of the young innocent in the first half and being a complete bastard in the second. Enid Bennett is also extremely good. If Novarro was being seen as a poor man’s Valentino, then Bennett was the equivalent with regard to Lillian Gish. But on the basis of the current film, she was far more subtle in her own acting skills.\n\nQuite what Fred Niblo was doing when he wrote this story, I have no idea. Perhaps he’d been at the absinthe. Oddly, he wasn’t given a writing credited ever again after The Red Lily. I can’t think why. Perhaps they ran out of absinthe. The best thing to come out of the Red Lily was Ben Hur. Niblo and Novarro worked well together (and had made a previous film together), and so when George Walsh was deemed unsuitable part of the way into filming the epic, it was Novarro who stepped in. And the rest is history.\n\nShould you wish to see The Red Lily (and who wouldn’t?), it is available in the Warner Archive series. And while I might have not liked this movie much, it is wonderful just how many rare silents that the Warner Archive releases have given us access too. The print is good for the most part, with a bit of nitrate damage near the beginning. The score is also very good."
