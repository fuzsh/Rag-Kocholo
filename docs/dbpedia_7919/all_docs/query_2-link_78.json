        "text": "Me and my friend Brian are going to see this on the 29th. Should be a blast.\n\nBen-Hur: A Tale of the Christ is a 1925 American epic silent film directed by Fred Niblo, starring Ramón Novarro and Francis X. Bushman, based on the 1880 novel by Lew Wallace. Ben-Hur was the most expensive silent film ever made, with an enormous cast and crew and a visual scope that is breathtaking to this day. In 1997, Ben-Hur was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nIn 2010 legendary drummer from the band The Police and film score composer, Stewart Copeland was asked to compose a score for an arena spectacle of the original book including the iconic chariot scene and marine battle. It ran throughout Europe including Munich, Rome and the O2 Arena in London. Copeland was commissioned by the Virginia Arts Festival to edit the Niblo classic film and re-assemble his score for live performance with orchestra."
