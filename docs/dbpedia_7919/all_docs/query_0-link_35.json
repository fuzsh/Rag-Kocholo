Most lists rank the director's ten greatest films, while some directors with a particularly small filmography only have five films listed. Feature films, TV films, documentaries, short films, experimental films, essay films, TV miniseries and TV series that were created mainly by the director in question were all eligible.\n\nEdited By: pauldrach, Deany, PBR Streetgang, Sodacake, AgentAJD, erikk, Tim\n\nLast Updated: 2020-06-05"
