        "text": "In 1926 the Fitzgeralds rent a house in Salies-de-Bearn, which is a commune in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department in south-western France.\n\nAfter that spell in France, they return to America and Scott works in Hollywood.\n\nThere he meets Douglas Fairbanks. Douglas Fairbanks (born Douglas Elton Thomas Ullman; May 23, 1883 – December 12, 1939) was an American actor, screenwriter, director, and producer. He was best known for his swashbuckling roles in silent films such as The Thief of Bagdad, Robin Hood, and The Mark of Zorro but spent the early part of his career making comedies.\n\nHe also meets Lois Moran, a teenage actress, and in the book Scott flirts with her, which naturally upsets Zelda. Lois Moran (March 1, 1909 – July 13, 1990) was an American film and stage actress. Lois Moran has been immortalised as the supreme ingénue in American literature; she was F. Scott Fitzgerald’s inspiration for Rosemary, the beautiful young actress in Tender is the Night. Fitzgerald, with whom Moran was at one time romantically involved,\n\nIn 1927 Zelda mentions Charles Lindbergh and his feat to fly to France. Charles Augustus Lindbergh (February 4, 1902 – August 26, 1974), was an American aviator, military officer, author, inventor, explorer, and environmental activist. At age 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a U.S. Air Mail pilot to instantaneous world fame by making his Orteig Prize–winning nonstop flight from Long Island, New York, to Paris.\n\nAround this time the Fitzgeralds get acquainted with Carmel Myers. Carmel Myers (April 4, 1899 – November 9, 1980) was an American actress who achieved her greatest successes in silent film. In 1925, she appeared in arguably her most famous role, that of the Egyptian vamp Iras in Ben-Hur, who tries to seduce both Messala (Francis X. Bushman) and Ben-Hur himself (Ramón Novarro)."
