        "text": "On Facebook, my friend Zack made a post asking for his friends to chime in with movies that they themselves saw as important to watch. Not necessarily because they were good movies (though that’s always a plus), but because they were important to the people who watched them. Initially, I chimed in with 1989’s Cinema Paradiso, as I was at Best Buy just doing a quick Facebook check. But once I got home, I wondered what else I could recommend, and decided to do a year-by-year analysis of all the films in my Blu-Ray and DVD collection, then pick one film from each year that I felt most strongly as my favorite of the moment. Some choices were obvious to me (1980’s Somewhere in Time or last year’s Sing Street), but I became conflicted with a few others. Would I pick something because it was my favorite, or would I pick it because I wanted to recommend it to Zack? Or maybe I’d pick it because it’s a universally-agreed-upon great movie?\n\nUltimately, I decided to always pick movies that I wanted to watch, regardless if I were recommending it for someone else or not. And for years where I couldn’t pick just one movie (it’s such a Sophie’s Choice when I’m asked to pick between Bell, Book and Candle or Vertigo), I’d list the other as “Honorable Mention,” basically implying that it’s a tie. The 97 films chosen (and 16 honorable mentions) surely aren’t going to please everyone (I doubt anyone will find as much joy in 1984’s Supergirl as I do), but it’s my list and I’ll do what I want with it. Eventually, I’ll do more with this list; maybe I’ll write a paragraph about each film and why it’s here. For now, just enjoy a list of great movies as decided by the Albert Film Institute.\n\nThe Kid (1921, Charlie Chaplin)\n\nNosferatu (1922, F.W. Murnau)\n\nSafety Last!

Plus, it was either that or The Lego Batman Movie. As much as I love both, Newsies clearly is the better film. But let’s see what else the cinema has to offer. There’s plenty of films that have caught my eye which I’ll want to see this year, from blockbusters to dramas to sci-fi epics, including: Baby Driver (Edgar Wright), Beauty and the Beast (Bill Condon), The Book of Henry (Colin Trevorrow), Call Me By Your Name (Luca Guadagnino), Dunkirk (Christopher Nolan), The Lovers (Azazel Jacobs), Murder on the Orient Express (Kenneth Branagh), My Cousin Rachel (Roger Michell), The Sense of an Ending (Ritesh Batra), Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (Luc Besson), and Wonder Woman (Patty Jenkins).\n\nAlso, Descendants 2 comes out this summer. Shut up.\n\nI’ll be seeing you…"
