        "text": "When word of his younger brother’s life-threatening illness reached him, Roman General Tiberius (later Emperor Tiberius Caesar Augustus) who was in Pavia at the time, crossed the Alps like a man possessed. Without stopping day or night, he covered 200 Roman miles in a dangerous country. When Tiberius finally arrived, his younger brother Drusus, despite being on the verge of death, ordered his men to greet Tiberius with the dignity due to a consular and an imperator.\n\nTiberius’ frantic dash across the Rhine from northwestern Italy to Germany to his brother’s bedside evolved into a legend. The death of Drusus alone would have been worthy of a two-act epic. The tribute for Drusus the brother would have been a beautiful first act. Told first by Livy (now lost) and retold by others, this act consists of the dying Drusus’ struggle to show his brother the honours befitting a victorious general, the final brotherly kiss and embrace between the two men, and finally the ritual closing of Drusus’ eyes by Tiberius. Then there’s the funeral of Drusus the hero, in the second act. As a mark of respect for Drusus, the German tribes stopped fighting, allowing Tiberius to walk ahead of the procession to bring Drusus’ body all the way home to Rome. The young general’s body is carried by his centurions and tribunes in the first stage, in enemy territory, from the summer camp to their winter quarters. The body was then carried by the leading men of each town and city that passed by the procession.\n\nThe Burial of a Great and Preserving the Great General’s Fame\n\nWhen the funeral procession arrived in Pavia, they were joined by the emperor Augustus himself and his wife Livia (the mother of Tiberius and Drusus) as they continued their journey to Rome. The order of the scribes, the highest in rank of the four prestigious decuriae (“occupational grades”) among the civil servants, received Drusus’ body in Rome and carried it to the Forum, where Tiberius proceeded to deliver the eulogy. The body was then transported to the Circus Flaminius where Augustus delivered a second eulogy. Drusus’ body was then carried to the Campus Martius and burned at the Ustrinum. His ashes were then interred in the Mausoleum, and he was lavished with tributes such as statues, an arch and a cenotaph on the Rhine. But perhaps the most significant honour bestowed upon him is the title “Germanicus,” which denotes him as the conqueror of Germany.\n\nDrusus’ posthumous fame as Drusus Germanicus was immense and long-lasting. His family became keepers of this fame. For decades, his young widow was identified in literature, inscriptions and papyri as Antonia Drusi. Antonia outlived Drusus by nearly 45 years and never remarried. Drusus’ two young sons were also to be given the name Germanicus. His elder son (born in 15 BC) became known as Germanicus Julius Caesar after his adoption by his uncle Tiberius in 4 AD, and proceeded to become the Roman people’s hero until his own death, much like his father. On inscriptions, his younger brother, the future Princeps Claudius (born in 10 BC), is frequently referred to as Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus, son of Drusus Germanicus. Later, when Claudius became Emperor, the name Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus appeared frequently on his coins. Claudius’ predecessor and successor as Princeps, Gaius Caligula (son of his brother Germanicus) and Nero (son of his niece Agripinna, daughter of Germanicus), were both identified as grandson and great-grandson of Drusus. Drusus’ mother, Livia, later Julia Augusta, is named as mother of Drusus Germanicus on inscriptions decades after his death. Before 14 AD, Livia was known as Livia Drusi f. Augusti. After 14 AD, Livia was known as Julia Augusta, Mater Tiberius Caesaris principis et conservatoris et Drusi Germanici genetrix orbis (“Mother of Tiberius Caesar, ruler and conservator, and mother of the great Drusus Germanicus”).\n\nBrother, Son, Soldier: Who is Nero Claudius Drusus?\n\nThe marriage of Octavian and Livia Drusilla on 17 January 38 BC paved the way for the meteoric careers of Livia’s two sons from her previous marriage to praetor Tiberius Claudius Drusus. Her first husband is descended from Appius Claudius Caecus who was responsible for the building of one of Rome’s earliest and most important roads Via Appia (the Appian Way) and the Aqua Appia (the Appian Waters), the first Roman aqueduct, constructed in 312 BC. Livia’s two sons from her first marriage are Tiberius Claudius Nero and Decimus Claudius Drusus. Through their parents, Tiberius and Drusus were thus descendants of both the Claudii Nerones and the Claudii Pulchri, two of the Roman Republic’s most prominent patrician families.\n\nBy the time Octavian was attracted to Livia and started making arrangements to marry her, Livia was already heavily pregnant with Drusus. Octavian arranged for Livia to divorce her husband and soon married her. Drusus was born three months after this marriage in Octavian’s house in 38 BC, and there was speculation that Augustus was Drusus’ natural father. Nevertheless, the claim seemed to be little more than gossip as Tiberius and Drusus remained with their father until his death in 33 BC. Following their father’s death, the boys were placed in the care of Octavian and their mother. Livia and Octavian most likely had Drusus abandon the praenomen Decimus, which might have been offensive to Octavian because of his relationship with Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus around the time of his mother’s marriage to Octavian. Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus was one of the conspirators in the plot to murder Julius Caesar, Octavian’s adoptive father. It is likely that Drusus was renamed Nero Claudius Drusus around the time that he started living with his mother and Octavian. Also around the time of his mother’s marriage, Tiberius was adopted by senator Marcus Gallius and accepted the inheritance, but he soon abandoned the name Gallius because the senator had been an opponent of his new stepfather in his battle against Mark Antony.\n\nLater in this life, Drusus grew to be more popular than his brother Tiberius, who went on to become one of the least popular Roman emperors. His conduct in his domestic relationships and unwavering fidelity to his marriage bed also became a source of popular admiration and applause in a decadent age especially around the time that the Augustan policies on marriage and adultery were first introduced to the senate in 18 BC to, among other things, discourage adultery and divorce. He married the beautiful and illustrious Antonia, the younger daughter of the triumvir Mark Antony by Octavia, Augustus’ sister. He married Antonia around 16 BC, when he was about 22 years old and, despite dying at the age of thirty, he had several children who died before him, in addition to the three who survived their father, Germanicus, Livia and Claudius.\n\nDrusus and His Public Life\n\nThrough a senate decree in 19 BC, Drusus obtained permission to fill all magistracies when he around 19 years old, five years ahead of schedule. Three years later, in early 16 BC, he was already married and presiding with his brother at a gladiatorial show. When Augustus left for Gaul, taking Tiberius who was then praetor with him, he evidently trusted Drusus enough to leave him in the city to discharge the important duties of that office in his brother’s place. Drusus was appointed quaestor the following year and sent to fight against the Rhatians who were accused of preying on Roman travellers and allies.\n\nThe outbreak of war with the Cantabri and Astures, as well as an Alpine Salassi revolt, thwarted Augustus’ plans to send an expedition to Britain. As the predominantly Celtic Raeti, who lived in the lands north of the Alps between Noricum and Gaul, raided northern Italy, harassed Romans and their allies passing through their territory, and allegedly committed atrocities, Augustus sent Drusus against them first. He was promoted to praetorian rank after defeating one of their forces in the Tridentine mountains, the Alpine range bordering Italy, no doubt by Senate decree at the behest of Augustus. Despite being repulsed in northern Italy, the Raeti pressed on Gaul, prompting Augustus to dispatch Tiberius against them as well.\n\nCassius Dio says, “the pair then launched simultaneous invasions of the enemy’s territory from different directions, both under their own command and that of subordinate commanders…”. Tiberius and Drusus were able to defeat the Raeti in a series of set battles using this multipronged strategy. Because the Raeti were abundant in manpower and thought to be prone to rebellion, they deported the majority of adult males, including the fittest of them, leaving just enough men to populate the land but too few to rebel against the Roman Empire.\n\nDrusus’ Life-Long Obsession: The Conquest of Germany\n\nAfter having two castles built, one near the Chatti country on the Rhine near the confluence of the Luppia and the Aliso, Drusus then returned to Rome with the reputation of having conquered several tribes beyond the Rhine. He was rewarded with a Senate vote granting him an ovation with the insignia of a triumph and decreeing that he should have proconsular authority at the end of his praetorship. Drusus likely became proconsul in 14 AD, at the age of about 24 years old. However, Augustus forbade him from using the title of imperator (a title roughly equivalent to “commander”) which the army in the field had bestowed upon him. It was perhaps by this time that it was already widely known that Drusus wished for the restoration of the commonwealth and the people of Rome look to him in the hope that he would restore their ancient liberties. In a letter to Tiberius, Drusus discussed forcing Augustus to resign the empire. Perhaps due to his feelings of being duty bound to the emperor, Tiberius read this letter to Augustus.\n\nDrusus resumed his duties in 10 BC as the Chatti fled the territory that the Romans had assigned to them. They join forces with Sicambri after years of refusing to do so. However, their combined forces were no match for Drusus. He was able to subdue some Chatti but could only threaten others. He attacked the Nervii, led by Snectius and Anectius, and most likely built a castle on the Taunus during this campaign.\n\nDrusus then returned to Rome with Augustus and Tiberius who had been in Lugdunensian Gaul watching the outcome of his war in Germany. Drusus was elected to the consulship on in 9 BC upon his arrival. However, as his main goal in life appeared to be to subjugate the Germans, Drusus was not able to find peace in Rome. Without waiting for his consulship to begin, he prepared himself to return to the battlefield. By this time, even before he left Rome, there were already evil forebodings surrounding him such as terrible storms and flooding during the winter months and lightning which had struck three temples in Rome.\n\nDrusus attacked and defeated the Chatti in a hard-fought battle. He then crossed into Suevi territory, signalling defeat to the Marcomanni (a subset of the Suevi, a group of Germanic peoples who originated from the Elbe river region in what is now Germany and the Czech Republic), and erected a trophy mound with the arms taken as spoil. He then turned his forces against the Cherusci and marched all the way to the Elbe.\n\nDrusus attempted and failed to cross the Elbe before experiencing a strange vision of a woman “of superhuman size,” according to Cassius Dio. “Whither, pray, art thou hastening, insatiable Drusus?” she asked. It is not fated for thee to see all these lands. But depart, for the end of both thy labours and thy life is near.” (Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55).\n\nDrusus returned to the Rhine, having been so deterred. On his way out, however, he heard wolves howling and women screaming around the camp. Two strange youths appeared on horseback among the entrenchments as stars raced across the sky. Drusus and his men interpreted all of these events as bad omens. The battle drums died somewhere between the Elbe and the Sala, and Drusus’ horse fell on his leg, according to Livy. He died 31 days after the accident. It should be noted at this point that, aside from Livy, no one else mentions Drusus’ broken leg among the numerous writers who mention his death. Suetonius, whose history is filled with scandal, mentions an incredible report that the Emperor Augustus had Drusus poisoned after he disobeyed his orders to leave the war and return to Rome, or perhaps due to Drusus’ desire to restore the commonwealth.\n\nCastor and Pollux: The Brothers who Become Gods\n\nDespite Tiberius’ betrayal, Drusus and Tiberius maintained the appearance of fraternal tenderness throughout their lives. Their brotherly love, according to writer Valerius Maximus who flourished in the reign of Tiberius, had only one parallel—the love between the twin gods Castor and Pollux.\n\nThe Greek mythological twins Castor and Pollux were also known as the Dioscuri, sons of Zeus, or the Tyndaridai, the sons of their earthly father Tyndaros. Their birth and parentage reports are complicated and contradictory. According to some versions of their origin story, they and their sister, Helen of Troy, were all three the children of Leda and Tyndaros, King of Sparta; according to other stories, they were the sons of Leda and Zeus, who had visited Leda in the form of a swan. Nevertheless, it was established at some point that Pollux was immortal, whereas Castor was born to die.\n\nEach brother possessed a unique talent, as their sister Helen refers to them in the Iliad as “Kastor, breaker of horses, and the strong boxer, Polydeukes (Pollux).” The twins were hailed as heroes in the Calydonian boar hunt and the voyage of the Argonauts, as well as a few of their own exploits, but they are best remembered for what happened after their deaths. After Castor was killed in an altercation, Pollux begged Zeus to let him die alongside his brother. Zeus offered him the choice of eternal life with the gods on Olympus or sharing Castor’s fate, alternating with him one day beneath the earth and one day on Olympus. Without hesitation, Polux chose the latter. In literature and history, they appear as divinities together after death, and they represent the very incarnation of brotherly love. In one version of their story, Zeus created them as Gemini, the heavenly twins, and Poseidon rewarded their brotherly love with command of the winds, transforming them into shipwrecked mariners. They also developed a habit of appearing to bring or announce victory in battle, with Athens’ defeat at the sea battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC being the most famous example in Greek history. On that occasion, they appeared as two stars, but by land, they could be recognised as a pair of beautiful young men mounted on white horses, holding spears and wearing the distinctive pilleus, the half-egg-shaped hat or helmet, often crowned by a star. One can imagine, then, the poignancy of the vision of two strange youths on horseback as stars raced across the sky before Drusus’ death.\n\nTiberius was keenly aware of this comparison between him and Drusus with Castor and Pollux. After Drusus’ death, and especially after he became Emperor, Tiberius, who was notoriously obsessed with mythology, used the dedicatory inscription of Rome’s Temple of Castor and Pollux to forge a strong public association between the heavenly twins and himself and his Drusus. He encouraged the people of Rome’s deep historical affection for the twins Castor and Pollux over the years, aided greatly by his brother’s great posthumous popularity for generations after his death. Tiberius’ only son, Drusus Julius Caesar, was nicknamed “Castor” as, perhaps, a touching tribute to his father’s brother.\n\nYears later, in 37 AD, Tiberius Caesar, suffering from illness and alarmed by bad omens that he started seeing himself, moved south from Rome to the Bay of Naples, eager to return to his refuge on Capry. However, bad weather kept him at his Misenum villa. “The Pharus tower collapsed in an earthquake on Capri a few days before he died,” Suetonius writes. One can imagine the dying Emperor gazing out his bedroom window at the great lighthouse on the island’s eastern heights. He was probably already aware that its flame had gone out, signaling the end of a story he had begun years ago with the death of Drusus – the story of Castor and Pollux, the brothers who became gods."
