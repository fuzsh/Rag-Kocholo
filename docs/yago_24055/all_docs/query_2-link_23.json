        "text": "Augustus kept Claudius from appearing in public because he was afraid that he might ridicule both himself and his family. He did realize, though, that he was nit feeble-minded. Suetonius writes:\n\nAgain in another letter: \"I certainly shall invite the young Tiberius to dinner every day during your absence, to keep him from dining alone with his friends Sulpicius and Athenodorus. I do wish that he would choose more carefully and in a less scatter-brained fashion someone to imitate in his movements, bearing, and gait. The poor fellow is unlucky; for in important matters, where his mind does not wander, the nobility of his character is apparent enough.\" Also in a third letter: \"Confound me, dear Livia, if I am not surprised that your grandson Tiberius could please me with his declaiming. How in the world anyone who is so unclear in his conversation can speak with clearness and propriety when he declaims, is more than I can see.\"\n\nTiberius didn't think him fit for public office either but named him as one of his heirs.\n\nOne thing that's obvious is that Claudius *SURVIVED*. Other family members were eliminated. No one thought of Claudius as a \"threat\".\n\nYou make a good point that Suetonius might have inserted the August/Tiberius material in order make Claudius more \"legitimate\" in the telling. He wasn't some crippled oaf that stumbled into power. Suetonius may have setup the references so it doesn't appear Claudius suddenly got smart, but was smart all along ... just under appreciated.\n\nI'm not as up on Claudius as I should be, I guess. He did have a prostitute girlfriend for a while before he was forced to marry in the right class. This was not approved behavior. The historians were quite upset that Marc Antony had an \"actress\" girlfriend for years ... and he wasn't ANYTHING at the time, just a citizen. Would a live-in prostitute be allowed in the palace? I dunno. Graves has Claudius visiting/living-with her elsewhere. It would be a wise move on his part to GET OUT OF THE PALACE when so many were being killed. This is all speculation. It's easy to see why Robert Graves made him a centerpiece. How did he survive? What was going on in his head?\n\n\"41 1 He began to write a history in his youth with the encouragement of Titus Livius101 and the direct help of Sulpicius Flavius. But when he gave his first reading to a large audience, he had difficulty in finishing, since he more than once threw cold water on his own performance. For at the beginning of the reading the breaking down of several benches by a fat man raised a laugh, and even after the disturbance was quieted, Claudius could not keep from recalling the incident and renewing his guffaws. 2 Even while he was emperor he wrote a good deal and gave constant recitals through a professional reader.102 He began his history with the death of the dictator Caesar, but passed to a later period and took a fresh start at the end of the civil war, realising that he was not allowed to give a frank or true account of the earlier times, since he was often taken to task both by his mother and his grandmother.103 p77 He left two books of the earlier history, but forty-one of the later. 3 He also composed an autobiography in eight books, lacking rather in good taste than in style, as well as a \"Defence of Cicero against the Writings of Asinius Gallus,\" a work of no little learning. Besides this he invented three new letters and added them to the alphabet, maintaining that they were greatly needed;104 he published a book on their theory when he was still in private life, and when he became emperor had no difficulty in bringing about their general use. These characters may still be seen in numerous books, in the daily gazette,105 and in inscriptions on public buildings.\n\n42 1 He gave no less attention to Greek studies, taking every occasion to declare his regard for that language and its superiority. To a foreigner who held forth both in Greek and in Latin he said: \"Since you are ready with both our tongues\"; and in commending Achaia to the senators he declared that it was a province dear to him through the association of kindred studies; while he often replied to Greek envoys in the senate in a set speech.106 Indeed he quoted many Homeric lines from the tribunal, and whenever he had punished an enemy or a conspirator, he commonly gave the tribune of the guard107 this verse when he asked for the usual watchword:\n\n\"Ward off stoutly the man whosoever is first to assail you.\"108\n\n2 At last he even wrote historical works in Greek, twenty books of Etruscan History and eight of Carthaginian. Because of these works there was p79 added to the old Museum at Alexandria a new one called after his name, and it was provided that in the one his Etruscan History should be read each year from beginning to end, and in the other his Carthaginian, by various readers in turn, in the manner of public recitations.\"\n\n--- Suetonius\n\nDid you catch that last bit? He built and addition to the Great Library of Alexandria named after himself and required that his twenty books of Etruscan History be read aloud in public, every year, from beginning to end.\n\nWikipedia has pretty good coverage of all his books (mainly histories). He also tried to introduce new letters into Latin. Claudius - Wikipedia\n\nThe \"defense of Cicero\" surprised me. It must be a \"post-mortem\" theoretical defense of Cicero. Cicero died in the mid-30's BC, Claudius was born 10 bc.\n\nThat's a complicated one. As a general rule, Augustus and Tiberius were more prone to keep him away from public affairs; however, he probably wasn't seen as the 'black sheep' of the family and nor as a laughingstock of the people, as Suetonius writes. Claudius was a member of the Domus Augusta, was an integral part of various marriage strategies and appears in statuary groups celebrating the Domus. Both the Senate and the equestrians showed him respect multiple times; and while Graves' take on Claudius is an absurd, cherry-picking revisionistic tale that deserves no credit whatsoever (I know it's just a set of novel, but many people still think of Graves' Claudius as the real Claudius, who was more similar to his predecessors than people would like to believe), his assumption that Gaius might have wanted to kill Claudius is not too far-fetched. The latter was the oldest member of the Domus Augusta, and probably had a good deal of allies, some of whom were linked to Gaius' murder. While it's only an assumption, the possibility Claudius was a more willingful part of his nephew's murder must be taken into account.\n\nDeath by natural causes? Julio-Claudians? Not so much ...View attachment 46374\n\nOf course, Caesar's grandfather died, sitting on his bed putting his boots on ... but there aren't many of those.\n\nI like this chart. You need Marc Antony (and Caesar's dad) to get Caligula, Claudius, and Nero.\n\nIt looks like Cleopatra's line died out, but from Drusilla you get 7 Roman emperors (not on chart).\n\nThe problem with this chart is that it takes into accounts several rumors. For one, Antonia Minor likely died of natural causes - that's what Fasti Ostiensi implie -, while allegations of poisoning or suicide are likely a later fabrication to blacken her nephew Gaius' reputation. Rumors regarding Tiberius' death are inconsistent at best, and the most reliable testimoniance is Seneca the Elder's, who lived in Tiberius' time and talks about a natural death, which is completely realistic given the princeps was just shy of his 79th birthday. Claudius' death is more complicated: while Levick considers rumors regarding his poisoning accurate, the fact Flavius considers it just a rumor sounds suspicious. The same goes for Germanicus: allegations of poisoning are inconsistent and easily dismissable (eg. ancient writers claims Tiberius entrusthed Piso to check on Germanicus right after saying Piso hated Tiberius? Souns strange to say the least). Augustus' death was also likely a natural one: allegations of murder are probably later fabrications. Livia had no reason to poison him.\n\nI stand corrected. I haven't looked into those deaths.\n\nI've really only researched two deaths: Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe in Ephesus, and Cleopatra's youngest brother. The earliest author to refer to them is Josephus, who hated Cleopatra with a passion ... presumably from her multiple attempts to annex Judaea. Josephus was born 67 yrs after Cleopatra's death, but he used up every word in the dictionary-of-vile-adjectives describing her.\n\nJosephus says Antony had Arsinoe IV murdered under Cleopatra's orders ... he says in two different spots. The second time, it's in \"Contra Apion\" where he's criticizing that author. Apion repeats the Arsinoe story, probably picking it up from Josephus writing about him. Cassius DIo repeats the rumor ... but has Cleopatra killing both her younger brothers ... in Ephesus ... at the time they were in Alexandria and both lived for a few more years. Plutarch doesn't mention it at all.\n\nHer youngest brother is similar. Josephus starts the rumor he was poisoned. No one prior to that mentions it. They just say \"he died\" ... which happened a lot from natural causes back then: many people on the Med had malaria (like Caesar), Egyptians had the added load of bilharzia (and still do today) ... plus all the usual things like cholera, diphtheria, typhus, and influenza. There's a pharaoh on one of Egypt's list of kings that has the inscription \"carried off by a hippo\".\n\nYet, these rumors are well accepted despite absolutely no corroboration from timely sources. It's \"generally accepted history\"."
