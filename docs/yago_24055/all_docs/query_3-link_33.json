She was named after her grandmother, Augustus' wife Livia Drusilla, and commonly known by her family nickname Livilla (\"little Livia\"). She was born after Germanicus and before Claudius.\n\nShe was twice married to the potential successor in the Julio-Claudian dynasty, first to Augustus' grandson Gaius Caesar (died 4 AD) and later to Tiberius' son Drusus the Younger (died AD 23). Allegedly, she helped her lover Sejanus in poisoning her second husband and died shortly after Sejanus fell from power in AD 31.\n\nThis page uses content from the English Wikipedia.
