        "text": "Chronicle of the Eastern Kings\n\nEt album historia de Oriente regum\n\nor a history of the East and a list of kings​\n\nThe assemblage of courts and patronages in the East is a considerable and ancient collection thereof, and it is not commonplace for any legionaries, governors, or diplomats, to be acquainted with the likewise histories when it ought be commonplace. To this end, I have compiled a chronicle of the regnal periods thereof in the style of the ancient Aegyptian and Aramaic king lists which may be used by Asiaticus in his governorship of Syria as well as by successive magistracies and by the princeps himself. The current state of the Eastern courts is thus:\n\nKing of Kings, Philhellene, King of Parthia, Tiridates III\n\nAscended after a revolution overthrew Vonones, the heir to Phraates V, whom had been initially succeeded by his cousin, Orodes III\n\nKing in Osroene, Abgar V of Edessa\n\nHolding power for the second time after defeating the usurper Ma'nu IV and reclaiming the throne\n\nKing in Adiabene, Izates\n\nAdopted Jewish son of the previous Arsacid governor, Artaxares, and first sovereign king of Adiabene\n\nKing in Media, Artabanus II\n\nSucceeded Vonones, the eventual King of Kings, whom had been the Arsacid king there previously\n\nKing in Charax, Attambolos III\n\nLegitimate son of his predecessor, Abinegros\n\nKing in Elam, Orodes\n\nHaving usurped the lineage of seven successive Kamnaskirid kings\n\nKing in Persia, Pakor\n\nSon of his predecessor, Vahshir, and descendant of the house of Arsaces​\n\nThe Parthian Empire, the greatest rival to Rome​\n\nKings of the House of Arsaces, Philhellenes, Kings of Kings and of Parthia, of Mesopotamia, and of the reaches of Asia with their throne at Ctesiphon​\n\nThe house of Arsaces, having decisively defeated the house of Seleucus in the consulship of Lucius Caecilius Metellus for the second time and Numerius Fabius Buteo, assumed for themselves the title of “Shahansha”, which in the language of the Persians is reserved singularly for the king above all kings, acquired the throne of the East, under the banner of Arsaces I, and thereafter all men to hold any likewise title was called Arsaces, although this chronicle will refer simultaneously to their princely names, rather than singularly their regnal names in the year which they took power. These kings also retained direct control over the realms of Hyrcania, Abarshahr, Hatra, Elam, Korduene, and India.\n\nArsaces I - cos. L. Caecilius Metellus II and N. Fabius Buteo (247 BCE)\n\nArtabanus I (Ars. II) - cos. Gn. Fulvius Centumalus Maximus and P. Sulpicius Galba Maximus (211 BCE)\n\nPhruapatius (Ars. III) - cos. Ap. Claudius Pulcher and M.

Julius Caesar (91 BCE)\n\nArsaces XII - seized power in the same year from Gotarzes I\n\nMithridates III (Ars. XIII) - cos. L. Cornelius Sulla Felix the Dictator and Q. Pompeius Rufus (88 BCE)\n\nOrodes I (Ars. XIV) - cos. L. Cornelius Sulla Felix the Dictator II and Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius (80 BCE)\n\nSanatruces (Ars. XV) - cos. D. Junius Brutus and Mam. Aemilius Lepidus Livianus (77 BCE)\n\nArsaces XVI - seized power in the same year from Sanatruces\n\nPhraates III (Ars. XVII) - cos. Gn. Pompeius Magnus the Triumvir and M. Licinius Crassus the Triumvir (70 BCE)\n\nArsaces XVIII - cos. M’. Aemilius Lepidus and L. Volcatius Tullus (66 BCE)\n\nMithridates III (Ars. XIX) - cos. L. Aurelius Cotta and L.

Augustus XIII and M. Valerius Messalla (2 BCE)\n\nOrodes III (Ars. XXVI) - seized power from Phraates V in cos. L. Julius Caesar Vipsanianus and P. Vinicius with the aid of Musa, the former wife of Phraates IV and herself a powerful patron in the Arsacid court (4 CE)\n\nVonones (Ars. XXVII) - cos. T. Statilius Taurus and L. Norbanus Balbus (17 CE)\n\nTiridates III (Ars. XXVIII) - cos. M. Cocceius Nerva and Mam. Aemilius Scaurus (21 CE)\n\nThe modern political situation in the East, which came about after the Mithridatic Wars​\n\nKings of Osroene, Arabian vassals to the King of Kings and victors over Crassus and Antonius with their throne at Edessa​\n\nThe house of Osroes were originated in their powers at the fall of the house of Seleucus at the behest of both Parthia and Armenia, as well as Pontus, which at that time gave patronage to a great multitude of eastern kings. The kings thereof descended from a sect of the Nabataeans which had migrated into Mesopotamia and were likewise known to speak Greek and Aramaic in addition to their native Arabian languages. The Arabs are most notable in our histories for their slaughter of Marcus Crassus, his son, and his legions at Carrhae and they have since been thralls to the Arsacid court, whom themselves have leveraged the vulnerability of the realm to depose numerous kings including Abgar V of Edessa, whom in addition to reigning concurrently with his august prince Germanicus had been deposed in the consulship of Postumus and Metellus Creticus.\n\nAryu - cos. P. Popillius Laenas and P. Rupilius (132 BCE)\n\nAbdu - cos. L. Cassius Longinus Ravilla and L. Cornelius Cinna (127 BCE)\n\nOsroes Fradhast - cos. P. Manilius and G. Papirius Carbo (120 BCE)\n\nBakru I - cos. M. Aemilius Scaurus and M. Caecilius Metellus (115 BCE)\n\nBakru II - cos. M. Livius Drusus and L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (112 BCE)\n\nMa’nu I - cos. G. Coelius Caldus and L. Domitius Ahenobarbus (94 BCE)\n\nAbgar I Piqua - seized power from Ma’nu in the same year\n\nAbgar II the Traitor - cos. L. Caecilius Metellus and Q. Marcius Rex (68 BCE), victor over Crassus\n\nMa’nu II - cos. Gn. Pompeius Magnus III and Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio (52 BCE), victor over Antonius\n\nPaqor - cos. M. Antonius the Triumvir II and L. Scribonius Libo (34 BCE)\n\nAbgar III - cos. Imp. Caesar Divi f. Augustus V and Sex. Appuleius (29 BCE)\n\nAbgar IV Sumaqa - cos. Imp. Caesar Divi f. Augustus VIII and T. Statilius Taurus II (26 BCE)\n\nMa’nu III Saphul - cos. Imp. Caesar Divi f. Augustus XI and Gn. Calpurnius Piso (23 BCE)\n\nAbgar V of Edessa - cos. Q. Haterius and L. Passenius Rufus (4 BCE)\n\nMa’nu IV - cos. G. Vibius Postumus and Q. Caecilius Metellus Creticus (7 CE)\n\nAbgar V of Edessa - seized power from Ma’nu IV in cos. Dr. Claudius Nero and G. Visellius Varro (13 CE)\n\nKings in Media, themselves in union with the Arsacids and vassals to the King of Kings with their throne at Ganzak​\n\nThe Median throne of Atropatene was among the royal houses which emerged following the death of Alexander. The dynasty was founded by Atropates, whom himself was the satrap of Media, and revolted against Antigonus in the consulship of Titus Vetrurius Calvinus for the second time and Spurius Postumius Albinus Caudinus for the second time. However, the ensuing anarchy in the East left the Medians without sufficient written records for the next century, and thus the regnal chronicle will begin a hundred years later.\n\nAtropates - cos. T. Vetrurius Calvinus II and Sp. Postumius Albinus Caudinus II (321 BCE)\n\n--No record for the next century--\n\nArtabazanes - contemporary of Antiochus III Magnus beginning in cos. P. Cornelius Scipio Asina and M. Minucius Rufus (221 BCE)\n\n--Another gap in our records exists for the next century and a half--\n\nMithridates - came to power as a contemporary of Tigranes Magnus in cos. G. Calpurnius Piso and M’. Acilius Glabrio (67 BCE)\n\nDarius - cos. L. Aurelius Cotta and L. Manlius Torquatus (65 BCE)\n\nAriobarzanes I - seized power from Darius in the same year\n\nArtavasdes I - cos. Gn. Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus and L. Marcius Philippus (56 BCE)\n\nAsinnalus - cos. Imp. Caesar Divi f. Augustus III and M. Antonius the Triumvir III (31 BCE)\n\nAriobarzanes II - cos. Imp. Caesar Divi f. Augustus XI and Gn. Calpurnius Piso (23 BCE)\n\nArtavasdes II - cos. L. Julius Caesar Vipsanianus and P. Vinicius (4 CE)\n\nArtabanus I - cos. A. Licinius Nerva and M. Aemilius Lepidus (6 CE)\n\nVonones - cos. Imp. Caesar Dr. Divi f. Augustus Germanicus III and Ger. Julius Caesar (10 CE)\n\nArtabanus II - cos. G. Vibius Marsus and L. Voluseius Proculus (18 CE)\n\nKings and Philhellenes of Charax, themselves vassals to the King of Kings with the throne at Spasinou whom were frequently subsumed in their imperia by the Shahs of Parthia during the numerous interregna​\n\nThe realms of Characene, or Charax as it is called by the Greeks who inhabit it, emerged with their royal house, the house of Aspasine, from the auspices of the satrap of Babylon during the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. They have thenceforth enjoyed a privileged position in Mesopotamia and have frequently incurred the wrath of the kings of kings in their insubordination. Thusly, the regnal chronicle of this realm is punctuated by interregna during which the kings of kings have assumed direct patronage over this realm in retribution against their Greek vassals.\n\nHyspaosines - cos. L. Cassius Longinus Ravilla and L. Cornelius Cinna (127 BCE)\n\nApodakos - held power from cos. M. Minucius Rufus and Sp. Postumius Albinus to cos. G. Marius and L. Aurelius Orestes (110 - 103 BCE)\n\n--Interregnum of eight years during which time Mithridates II, the King of Kings, was also the king in Charax\n\nTiraios - held power from cos. L. Licinius Crassus and Q. Mucius Scaevola to cos. Gn. Pompeius Strabo and L. Porcius Cato (95 - 89 BCE)\n\n--Interregnum of ten years during which time Arsaces XII was king in Charax for one year, Mithridates III was king in Charax for eight years, and Orodes I was king in Charax for a further year before reinstating their autonomous rights, while each of these also held the title of King of Kings\n\nTiraios II - held power from cos. P. Servilius Vatia Isauricus and Ap. Claudius Pulcher to cos. G. Julius Caesar the Dictator II and P. Servilius Isauricus (79 - 48 BCE)\n\nArtabazos - seized power from Tiraios II in the above year and held it for one year\n\nAttambalos I - held power from cos. Q. Fufius Calenus and P. Vatinius to cos. Imp. Caesar Divi f. Augustus X and G. Norbanus Flaccus (47 - 24 BCE)\n\n--Interregnum of five years during which time Tiridates II was the king in Charax while also reigning as the King of Kings\n\nTheonesios - cos. G. Sentius Saturninus and Q. Lucretius Vespillo (19 BCE)\n\nAttambolos II - cos. G. Furnius and G. Junius SIlanus (17 BCE)\n\nAbinergaos - cos. Imp. Caesar Drusus Divi f. Germanicus Augustus III and Ger. Julius Caesar (10 CE)\n\nAttambolos III - cos. Imp. Caesar G. Divi f. Augustus III and M. Aurelius Cotta II (23 CE)\n\nKings in Elam, themselves vassals to the King of Kings and successors to the Elamite lineage of time immemorial​\n\nElam is believed to be the most ancient lineage in Asia, drawing their histories from a time preceding the Chaldeans and Assyrians. They were conquered by the house of Achaemanes in the time of the Conflict of the Orders before their later conquest by Alexander and the house of Seleucus. They threw off this yoke during the time of the Macedonian Wars and have been under the rule of the house of Kamnaskires ever since, with numerous of their rulers bearing the same name, and the Kings of Kings have shown deference to their sovereignties in the succeeding centuries.\n\nKamnaskires I Megas Soter - cos. P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus Aemilianus and G. Livius Drusus (147 BCE)\n\nKamnaskires II Nikephoros - cos. Q. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus and L. Hostilius Mancinus (145 BCE)\n\nOkkonaspes - cos. Gn. Calpurnius Piso and M. Popilius Laenas (139 BCE)\n\nTigraios - cos. M. Aemilius Lepidus Porcina and G. Hostilius Mancinus (137 BCE)\n\nDarius - ruled for less than one year while claiming to be a descendant of the last Achaemanid king in cos. P. Popilius Laenas and P. Rupilius (132 BCE)\n\n--Interregnum during which time Vadfradad I, king in Persia, and his immediate successors, held dominion over Elam\n\nKamnaskires III Megas Nikepohorus - rebelled against Vadfradad III in cos. L. Cornelius Cinna III and Gn. Papirius Carbo (85 BCE)\n\nKamnaskires IV - ruled jointly with his wife, Anzaze, beginning in cos. G. Marius Minor and Gn. Papirius Carbo III (82 BCE)\n\nKamnaskires V - cos. M. Terentius Varro Lucullus and G. Cassius Longinus (73 BCE)\n\nKamnaskires VI - cos. G. Julius Caesar the Dictator III and M. Aemilius Lepidus (46 BCE)\n\nKamnaskires VII - cos. Imp. Caesar Divi f. Augustus VI and M. Vipsanius Agrippa II (28 BCE)\n\nKamnaskires VIII - cos. G. Julius Caesar and L. Aemilis Paullus (1 CE)\n\nKamnaskires IX - cos. M. Vipsanius Agrippa Postumus and L. Scribonius Libo (15 CE)\n\nOrodes - cos. Imp. Caesar G. Divi f. Augustus V and M. Vipsanius Agrippa Postumus II (25 CE)\n\nThe location of Persis within the old Persian Empire\n\nKings of Persia of the house of Bazrhangi and successors to the house of Achaemenes, themselves vassals to the King of Kings with their throne at Persepolis​\n\nAfter the fall of the house of Achaemanes at the hands of Alexander, the house of Seleucus was unable to fully wrest control of the Persian homeland from the newly established royal house. These men did not record the precise breadth of reigns with respect to their subsequent overlordships, and thus their regnal chronicle is imprecise and it is inappropriate to use the traditional calendar, and I will thuswise employ generalities in this respect. The chronicle of Achaemanid kings is likewise included with the subsequent interregnum.\n\nAchaemanes - vassal to the Chaldeans, ascended in 48 ab Urbe condita, or reg. Numa Pompilius X (705 BCE)\n\nTeispes - son of Achaemanes, reg. Ancus Marcius II\n\nCyrus I - son of Teispes, reg. Ancus Marcius XVII\n\nChambyses I - son of Cyrus I, reg. L.

The ongoing war is hard on all of us, especially after the death of the emperor, and we can only hope that the new joint emperors, Paullus Aquilla and Galerius Germanicus are up to the task of manning this ship of state. In any case, this and later translations, as well as all earlier installments of these annals will be transcribed and sent to every imperial university in the hopes that they will survive with the chronicles of later rulers, even in the event that the Empire itself falls into disarray once more. We have survived crises such as these before, and there is no reason that we cannot complete such a feat a second time.\n\nA recreation of the villa in Sardinia to which Gaius I retreated after his deposition during the Julian Schism​\n\nWe know in hindsight that the reign of Gaius I was merely a stop-gap during the long and prosperous Drusillan dynasty which lasted from the accession of Drusus to the early death of Appian more than a century later, but at the time in which Volume Six takes place, this was far from certain. Germanicus Invictus, who had spent considerable time in the provinces and away from Rome before his ascension, fought resistance at every turn. Volume Six, which covers most of his reign, will establish this dynasty, and set the tone for the next century of Rome, which will see the conclusion of these Annals and their continuation by Callistus.\n\nChronicle of Volume Six (780 - 793 AUC)​\n\nGermanicus began his reign by awarding many honors to his allies from the civil war. His comrades-in-arms, Gaius Aviola and Valerius Asiaticus were granted consulships and prestigious legionary commands in the early years, and the powerful men who took his side in that struggle would be consistent members of his inner-circle for the duration of his reign. However, behind the scenes, Germanicus engaged in a nonviolent, but considerable, purge of the praetorian guards to rid their ranks of any dissenters. The second year of his reign however, drew great controversy when he arranged for the election of twelve consuls in the span of a single year. Several of these men were allies of him and his family, including Domitius Ahenobarbus, Servius Galba, and Aulus Plautius. However, several of them were not appeased by these token magistracies, and the political upheaval from this year would have far-reaching implications in the subsequent years. In particular, many of the Julian family disengaged from politics at this time, including Germanicus’ younger brother, Tiberius, as well as Lucius Caesar, brother of the previous emperor.\n\nThe next few years would be marked by Germanicus taking a considerable and direct effort to engage the younger members of the Julian family, including his own sons, with the politics of the imperial government. Both his eldest sons, as well as the sons of Agrippa, would serve consulships at this time, and subsequently would spend many years serving commands in the legions. However, Germanicus was wary of the charisma and influence of Agrippa, which had only grown since the Julian Schism, and so he sent him to serve a command in Africa where he might be satiated yet politically marginalized.\n\nAnother fixture of Germanicus’ early reign would prove to be the reform of the structure of legionary commands. A key fixture of his own rise to power was the contradictory imperium of the various legates and proconsuls serving in the imperial provinces. In order to tame this unwieldy and potentially seditious apparatus, he sought to centralize legionary commands of each region of the empire under a central regional command. This was first undertaken in Germania to great effect, where an escalating war against the Marcomanni would serve as a fertile testing ground. The legions, commanded first by Marcus Vinicius, then Lentulus Scipio, and later Gaius Aviola and Junius Blaesus, prosecuted a war against the Germans with brutal efficiency. The Marcomanni, whom had been the aggressors against the Pannonia garrison, were routed northward, where the legions of Cisalbis intercepted them as part of a unified command theatre. After three years of consistent fighting, the Marcomannic king would be assassinated and several legions would be garrisoned in barbarian territory to defend against future threats. This war would prove a fertile proving ground, not just for the legionary commanders of Germanicus’ inner-circle, but also for the young rising stars of imperial politics, including Domitius Corbulo and Gaius Silius, who were friends of Drusus.\n\nHowever, the region of Illyricum would soon be gripped by another devastating revolt. The provincial governors in the Balkans, led by the ex-consul Naevius Surdinus, revolted against the martial reforms of Germanicus, which saw themselves stripped of military command in favor of a more professionalized officer corps. The revolt rapidly engulfed the region, and Germanicus’ allies were forced to flee to Italy where a loyalist expeditionary force began to assemble. Germanicus himself traveled with this expedition to quell the rebellion, which he viewed as a severe threat to his regime. Initial successes in Noricum and Pannonia were followed up by a decisive two-pronged invasion of Dalmatia which saw the revolutionaries turn on one another and the war was over as quickly as it had begun. However, Germanicus would quickly learn on the heels of this victory that all was not well in Italy in his absence.\n\nAgrippa had returned to Rome and was resentful at being sidelined by Germanicus after assisting his rise to power. He assembled a group of similar malcontents and, when they seized control of the highest magistracies, they addressed the senate and denounced the regime of Germanicus. This second revolution, consisting of Agrippa’s family, their allies, the leftovers from Gaius’ regime, and several old senatorial stalwarts, quickly seized control of Rome and the surrounding countryside with illegally levied legions. Many allies of Germanicus were murdered as they tried to flee the city, and the remnants of the Julian family fled, including Felix Pius and Marcus Rufus, the sons of Gaius Augustus. These Julians rallied a number of veterans into two impromptu legions which were joined by a token force withdrawn from the garrison in Germania and in winter of the next year, they crossed the Rubicon.\n\nThis next civil war was as brief as it was brutal. Germanicus’ second son, Vopiscus, had snuck into Rome and was leading an armed citizens’ insurrection against Agrippa, which resulted in the untimely deaths of both of the consuls for that year. Agrippa saw the installation of Aulus Gabinius and Octavius Laenas as consuls, but this would prove to be a fatal mistake as these men opened the gates of Rome to the besieging legions of Felix Pius. The bloodshed was considerable, and Agrippa as well as Lucius and both of their sons were killed. Most surprisingly, Agrippa’s second son, Antonius Agrippa, took part in the massacre as a legate under the command of Felix, and this drew considerable controversy as he betrayed his father to serve his patron.\n\nWhen Germanicus arrived back in Rome, he resolved to put the traumatized city at ease from the bloodshed of the last ten years by implementing a monumental reform effort. The censors and consuls together worked to appoint a ten-man “decemvirate” which would be set forth with the task of rationalizing the laws of the later Republic with those of Augustus and Drusus in order to form a more coherent governing structure of the empire. The two men at the forefront of this effort would be Marcus Cato and Sextus Marius, both of whom boasted noble ancestries. The most notable of these laws made official what Germanicus’ efforts had established as a largely informal system. The legions would be commanded by a body of officers wholly separate from the provincial governors, who would be confined to judicial and administrative matters. Most crucially, these laws established a new and powerful magistracy — the praetor patriae — who would oversee all treason trials and serve a unique, eighteen-month term. With this new administrative apparatus, Germanicus could rest easy and re-allocate his attention to grander plans.\n\nGaius (left), the third princeps, next to his brother, Lucius in a statue commissioned by Lucius to be displayed in Rome​"
