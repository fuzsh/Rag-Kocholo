        "text": "Claudius (Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus) was a Roman emperor from 41 to 54. He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul on 1 August, the first Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy. He was a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and he was also the son of Drusus and Antonio Minor. His family kept him from the public eye because of the fact that he had a limp and slight deafness due to being sick at a young age.

He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign the Empire began the conquest of Britain. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many senators. These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife. I do believe that Claudius was a good leader. Yes. He healed the Roman Empire after Caligula's reign of terror. He is best remembered for the conquest of Britain.
