        "text": "CHAPTER TWO\n\nTHE JULIO-CLAUDIANS 27 B.C. ñ A.D. 68\n\nWith the deaths of Marc Antony and Cleopatra in 30 B.C., Rome entered a new phase of its history known as the Empire. Although for all practical purposes the Republic had stopped functioning more than a decade before, most of its traditional, if decaying institutions remained. The task at hand for Octavian (later known as Augustus) was simple in purpose but complex in execution, for he intended to make a slow transition from a Republic to a dictatorship. This required a series of careful measures in the legal, social and military systems that retained the façade of Republican virtue, but which secured his absolute authority.\n\nThis transition took several decades to achieve, and the coinage clearly reflects his progress. From the initial issues bearing the names of the mon-eyers, the great Augustus ended his principate with issues that bore no oneís name but his own. Even though he was advanced in age, his image itself was youthful and idealized. (This alone was a remarkable transition from the Republican concept of harsh realism in portraiture.) Many volumes have been written on the achievements of Augustus, and so only a brief treatment is given here, and in his biography.\n\nFor nearly a century we find Rome under the autocratic rulership of the Julian and Claudian families. With the childless marriage of Augustus to Livia, these two powerful families joined fortunes, and came to be known as the Julio-Claudians.\n\nThe Julians came into prominence with the impressive political career of Julius Caesar, who achieved the unparalleled office of ìdictator for lifeî in 44 B.C., but was murdered soon thereafter. In Caesarís will, he had named his grand-nephew Octavian as sole heir of his political legacy, and most of his fortune. It required nearly 15 years of civil war after Caesarís death before Rome was united, and this occurred only after Augustus gained the upper hand on his ally-turned-foe, Marc Antony.\n\nThe Julio-Claudians comprise the first half of Suetoniusí ìTwelve Caesars.î Though of great interest to most students of Roman history, the interrelations of this dynasty are the most complex in the history of the Empire. But what appears at first to be a hopelessly complex web of associations is easily separated into several components. Once this is done, the whole array becomes approachable, and the enjoyment of collecting Julio-Claudian coins is greatly enhanced. What follows is a general outline of the dynasty.\n\nTHE JULIO-CLAUDIANS\n\nA.Earlier married to Marcellus; later to Tiberius.\n\nB.Daughter of Octavia and Marc Antony (thus, niece of Augustus & half-sister of Marcellus).\n\nC.Later married to Julia.\n\nD.Daughter of Agrippa. Later wed Asinius Gallus.\n\nE.First husband of Livilla.\n\nF.First married to Aelia Paetina (by whom he had Claudia Antonia); later to Agrippina Junior.\n\nG.Earlier married to Gaius Caesar; lover of Sejanus.\n\nH.Husband of Livia Julia.\n\nI.Wife of Nero Caesar; later betrothed to Sejanus.\n\nJ.He and his brother possibly sired by Sejanus.\n\nK.Husband of Caesonia, father of Drusilla Minor.\n\nL.Later married to Claudius.\n\nM.Married to Nero.\n\nN.Nero was also a paternal great-grandson of Marc Antony and Octavia.\n\nO.Earlier married to Otho (emperor, A.D. 69).\n\nNote: Names in Capitals are of emperors or dictators; names in italics are of people not found on coinage.\n\nïAugustus (Octavian) comes to power in 44 B.C. when the will of Julius Caesar is read, and it is revealed that he is heir to both his great-uncleís personal fortune and political legacy.\n\nïThe dynastic foundations are set when Augustus marries Livia in 38 B.C. Both of them had children from previous marriages, but in more than half a century of marriage they had none together. Therefore, different branches of the family existed along bloodlines, which was to be a source of great rivalry. Three principal branches existed: the first (I) was of Augustusí blood, the second (II) was of Liviaís blood, and the third (III, IIIa and IIIb), through three later marriages, was of the mixed blood from Augustus, Livia and Marc Antony. These branches are described later.\n\nïWith so many potential heirs to the throne, conflicts occurred between the family branches. Regrettably, even inter-branch marriages did not reduce hostilities. First, Livia may have eliminated some of the heirs favored by her husband, Augustus (though that has not been proven to the satisfaction of many historians). Second, Tiberius tried to clear a dynastic path by exterminating his deceased brotherís popular family; helping Tiberius was his prefect Sejanus, who himself had ambitions for the throne. Third, and much later, Agrippina Junior cleared the path for her own son, Nero, by murdering her uncle-husband, Claudius, and his son, Britannicus.\n\nThe three main family branches are:\n\nïBranch I: Augustusí direct descendants. No male heirs of this branch survived. The initial rivalry was between the brothers-in-law Marcellus (Augustusí nephew) and Agrippa (Augustusí chief lieutenant). Shortly after Marcellus died in 23 B.C., Agrippa married his widow, Julia, who was Augustusí only daughter, and thus was uncontested heir-apparent until his own death in 12 B.C. Augustus next looked to his grandchildren, whom Agrippa Julia had produced from 20ñ12 B.C. They included three sons (Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar and Agrippa Postumus) and two daughters (Julia the Younger [for whom no coins were struck] and Agrippina Senior). All the boys and the eldest girl, however, died or were banished during a six-year period (A.D. 2ñ8). Only Agrippina Senior survived this traumatic period, and her marriage to Germanicus (a second cousin who headed Branch III) resulted in six children who lived past childhood (Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar, Caligula, Agrippina Junior, Drusilla and Julia Livilla), four of whom were important in future politics. But after having survived the destruction of her original family, Agrippina Senior witnessed the systematic massacre of her husband and children under the regime of Liviaís eldest son, Tiberius (the head of branch II), who as a result succeeded Augustus in 14. Despite her great suffering, it is Agrippina Senior who principally kept Augustusí blood flowing in the later Julio-Claudians.\n\nïBranch II: Tiberiusí direct descendants. This branch was headed by Tiberius, the older brother of Nero Claudius Drusus and one of two sons of Livia from her first marriage. Except in the grandchildren (who were born of Livilla, the daughter of Augustusí niece), no blood of Augustus flowed in this branch. Tiberius had one son, Drusus, by his wife, Vipsania Agrippina, a daughter of Agrippa. Through his son, Tiberius had at least one grandchild, Livia Julia, and two others, Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus Gemellus, who were officially attributed to Drusus, but were likely sired by Tiberiusí praetorian prefect, Sejanus. When Tiberius became emperor in 14, he tried to destroy the family of his long-since-deceased brother, Nero Claudius Drusus, for their line was rich with the blood of Augustus, and thus the people and senate favored them over his own offspring. Leading this rival branch was Tiberiusí popular nephew, Germanicus. Though several fine members of Germanicusí family (including Germanicus himself) perished, the sinister designs of Tiberius were unsuccessful, for Tiberiusí own son (Drusus) predeceased him and in 37 he was succeeded by Germanicusí youngest son, Caligula.\n\nïBranch III: Nero Claudius Drususí direct descendants. This was the most successful branch, despite the very early death of its founder in 9 B.C. (some 23 years before Augustus himself died). It was founded by Nero Claudius Drusus (a son of Livia, and the younger brother of Tiberius) and Antonia (the daughter of Marc Antony and Augustusí sister, Octavia). Unlike Tiberiusí branch, this one was of very mixed blood, including that of Augustus, Livia and Marc Antony. Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia had two sons, Claudius and Germanicus, and a daughter, Livilla. During their generation the branch splits into two sub-branches (Ilia and Illb), headed by the sons, which (genetically, at least) developed separately. The daughter, Livilla, had marriages in both branch I and branch II.\n\nïBranch IlIa: Germanicusí direct descendants. This sub-branch was headed by Germanicus, and was rich with Augustusí blood. Not only was his maternal grandmother, Octavia, a sister of Augustus, but his wife (Agrippina Senior) was Augustusí granddaughter. Despite suffering much loss at the hands of Tiberius and his prefect, Sejanus, three important children of Germanicus survived. The first was a son, Gaius (called Caligula), who ruled cruelly from 37ñ41 and was murdered. The second was a daughter, Agrippina Junior, who became the mother of the third important offspring, the future emperor Nero (54ñ68), who, like his uncle Caligula, ruled cruelly and was murdered. With Neroís death, so ended the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\n\nïBranch Illb: Claudiusí direct descendants. Since Claudius was born sickly, he was put aside early in life, and hopes resided with his highly popular brother, Germanicus. This obscurity spared Claudius fatal consequences in the ìwarî between the families headed by Tiberius and Germanicus. In the meantime, Claudiusí marriages produced three children, of whom only a son, Britannicus, figured as a potential heir. When his demented young nephew Caligula was murdered in 41, Claudius was hailed emperor by the praetorian guards who wished to preserve their power, and recognized Claudius as not only a legitimate candidate, but one who they could dominate. Later, Claudius married one of his nieces, Caligulaís sister Agrippina Junior, who also had a son from a previous marriage (Nero). Though they produced no children together in marriage, some have speculated that Claudius had sired Nero before they were wed. During Claudiusí principate (41ñ54) only two legitimate male Julio-Claudian heirs remained: Britannicus and Nero, representing the two sub-branches of Germanicusí family. This spelled disaster for Claudius and his son, Britannicus, both of whom were murdered by Agrippina Senior and Nero so the latter could reign uncontested. Thus, Claudiusí sub-branch ends.\n\nAUGUSTUS 27 B.C. ñ A.D. 14\n\nAS OCTAVIAN: MEMBER OF THE SECOND TRIUMVIRATE, 43ñ33 B.C.\n\nAS OCTAVIAN: IMPERATOR, 31ñ27 B.C.\n\nAS AUGUSTUS: 27 B.C. ñ A.D. 14\n\nGRAND-NEPHEW AND ADOPTED SON OF JULIUS CAESAR\n\nHUSBAND OF SCRIBONIA AND LIVIA\n\nFATHER OF JULIA (BY SCRIBONIA)\n\nBROTHER OF OCTAVIA\n\nBROTHER-IN-LAW OF MARC ANTONY\n\nFATHER-IN-LAW OF MARCELLUS, AGRIPPA AND TIBERIUS\n\nADOPTIVE FATHER OF TIBERIUS AND NERO CLAUDIUS DRUSUS\n\nUNCLE OF ANTONIA\n\nGRAND-UNCLE OF GERMANICUS, CLAUDIUS AND LIVILLA\n\nGRANDFATHER OF GAIUS CAESAR, LUCIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA POSTUMUS, JULIA THE YOUNGER AND AGRIPPINA SENIOR\n\nGREAT-RANDFATHER OF NERO CAESAR, DRUSUS CAESAR, CALIGULA, AGRIPPINA JUNIOR, DRUSILLA AND JULIA LIVILLA\n\nGREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER OF NERO\n\nPotential Heirs of Augustus\n\nMarcellus\n\n23 B.C.\n\nMurdered (?)\n\nAgrippa\n\n12 B.C.\n\nDied\n\nNero Claudius Drusus\n\n9 B.C.\n\nDied\n\nLucius Caesar\n\nA.D. 2\n\nDied\n\nGaius Caesar\n\nA.D. 4\n\nDied\n\nAgrippa Postumus\n\nA.D. 7\n\nBanished\n\nAsinius Gallus\n\nñ\n\nFailed\n\nTiberius\n\nA.D. 14\n\nSucceeded\n\nCaesar Augustus (earlier Gaius Octavius, modified subsequently), 63 B.C. ñ A.D. 14. Augustus was the son of Atia (a niece of Julius Caesar) and of Gaius Octavius, an aspiring novus homo (ìnew manî), who died young in 59 B.C. without achieving the nobility he desired. However, his two children by his second wife, Atia, would serve his memory well. They were Octavia, the future wife of Marc Antony, and Octavian, who came to be known as Augustus, and was the first ìemperorî of Rome.\n\nOn balance, Augustus was a simple man who tackled enormous tasks in a pragmatic manner. As such, his accomplishments were both real and lasting. In his desire to achieve absolute power, Augustus demonstrated remarkable patience as he slowly and methodically accumulated titles and privileges, and restructured legal procedures to his advantage. Quietly, almost invisibly, he transformed a Republic into a constitutional hereditary monarchy.\n\nHis life was remarkable, and he enjoyed the company of great men, such as Virgil, Horace, Livy and Ovid. During his 57 years in power, he is said to have found Rome brick and left it marble. From this statement can be divined both a literal and a figurative truth which allows us, 2,000 years later, to reckon the greatness of his accomplishment.\n\nNOTE TO THE READER: In his own biography, Augustus is referred to as Octavian during the period in which he used that name (63ñ27 B.C.), and as Augustus from 27 B.C. onward. However, in other biographies in this book in which he is mentioned, the name Octavian is used only in the Imperatorial Period (chapter 1), and the name Augustus is used for the Imperial Period (chapter 2 and beyond). This has been adopted for the sake of simplicity.\n\nAS OCTAVIAN (63ñ27 B.C.)\n\nOctavian was only 4 years old when his father died, and so he was raised by his mother. Julius Caesar took an interest in helping his fatherless great-nephew, and personally introduced him into society. While a teenager, Octavian was appointed Pontifex and Praefectus Urbi in 47 B.C., and in 46 he accompanied Caesar at his military triumph in Rome. In the following year, Octavian campaigned in Spain with Caesar, and subsequently went to Apollonia in northern Greece, where he was to finish his studies.\n\nBut on the 15th (Ides) of March, 44 B.C., Julius Caesar was murdered, and soon after Octavian learned that his great-uncle had adopted him as his son, and by doing so had named him heir to his political legacy. According to Suetonius, Octavian received three-fourths of Caesarís fortune (with the remaining one-fourth being divided between two other of Caesarís grandnephews, Quintus Pedius and Pinarius Scarpus).Though not yet 20 years old, and frail of constitution, Octavian sensed the calling of destiny and abandoned his studies (against the advice of his mother and other family members). He and his friend Marcus Agrippa traveled back to Rome, arriving in May or June of 44 B.C., whereupon he changed his name to Gaius Julius Caesar and launched his career in politics.\n\nOctavian found Marc Antony (a former ally of Caesar, and the theoretical head of the Caesarean Party) to be confrontational, for Octavian was a threat to the career Antony had built. Indeed, Antony had good reason to fear, for Octavian proved himself to be a bold and resourceful politician from the start. Octavian allied himself with moderate Republicans, catered to Caesarís loyal veterans, and convinced the orator Cicero to emerge from retirement and take up his cause against Antony.\n\nAt this point, the political tide had turned strongly against Antony, who offered stubborn resistance, but still had to flee Rome. Octavian himself was getting resistance from the senate, which realized its peril and offered support to Brutus and Cassius (who had fled for their lives in 44 B.C.) by granting them great authority in Greece and Asia.\n\nIn 43 B.C., Octavian was given command with the two consuls, Hirtius and Pansa, and confronted the renegade armies of Antony in northern Italy at Mutina, where Antony was defeated by this senate-backed army. Though the victory belonged to the senate, both consuls were killed in the battle. Octavian (with the support of Caesarís veterans and Cicero) was named a replacement for one of the consuls, even though he was well below the requisite age. In this same year, Octavianís status as heir of Caesar was ratified by the senate, and his mother died, leaving him parentless.\n\nLate in 43 B.C., laden with his new powers, Octavian marched against Antony, who in the meantime had allied himself with another Caesarean, Lepidus. But instead of fighting Antony and Lepidus, Octavian achieved a truce with his two rivals on November 27. This was a wise move by Octavian, who realized his power in Rome had only come through brute force, and had no guarantee of longevity. The three formed what is known as the Second Triumvirate, a legally sanctioned political alliance by which the trio would rule Rome and its territories for the next five years. In the pact, Octavian received control of Africa, Sicily and Sardinia.\n\nOn New Yearís day, 42 B.C., Julius Caesar was declared a god, and Octavian thus became divi films (son of a god). In the meantime, the Republican renegades Brutus and Cassius had been ravaging Greece and Asia, and had amassed a considerable war chest and a large, well-equipped army. It was only a matter of time before these ìRepublicanî forces would engage whatever armies the Caesareans could assemble. The Republicans needed to win to justify their murder of Caesar, and the Caesareans needed to avenge Julius Caesarís death.\n\nAntony and Octavian left Lepidus in command in Italy, and led their armies east to confront Brutus and Cassius. The armies of the Caesareans (Triumvirs) and the Republicans met in northern Greece, near Philippi, and engaged in two pitched battles. Octavian was so ill that he had to be carried about the battlefield on a litter, and thus he had to rely on the healthier and more experienced Antony to carry the day against the Republicans. In October of 42 B.C., these battles occurred at Philippi about three weeks apart. Cassius committed suicide after the first battle, and Brutus did the same after having lost the second.\n\nThe memory of Julius Caesar was avenged, and Rome awaited the triumphant return of Octavian and Antony. This marked a new era in the Roman world, and each of the Triumvirs thus tried to strengthen his own position. Also, the three carved up the Roman world. Antony headed to the east while Octavian and Lepidus remained in the West. In the following year, 41 B.C., Octavian came into conflict with Lucius Antonius, the youngest brother of Marc Antony, and defeated him in what is called the ìPerusine War.î Octavian wisely spared the life of Lucius Antonius, so as not to antagonize Marc Antony.\n\nIn 40 B.C., Octavian married Scribonia, a relative of Sextus Pompey, the youngest son of the long-deceased warlord Pompey the Great. After the murder of Julius Caesar (who in 48 B.C. had defeated Pompey the Great), Sextus Pompey had re-activated his ambitions, and had been given by order of the senate command of a powerful fleet which he used to gain control of Sicily and Sardinia.\n\nThough Octavianís marriage to Scribonia had a political motive, it also resulted in a daughter named Julia, who was to be the only child Octavian fathered. In the same year, 40 B.C., Octavian also came to an agreement with Antony known as the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Antony married Octavianís only sister, Octavia. Though the marriage was received well by the public (who hoped it might prevent civil war), it was a private failure.\n\nTwo years later Octavian divorced Scribonia, not only because it was politically expedient, but also because (as Suetonius reports) he ìÖ could not bear the way she nagged Öî Octavian replaced Scribonia with an aristocratic lady named Livia, who proved to be his final wife. This marriage was based principally upon love and, though childless, endured 52 years. They seemed perfect companions though, admittedly, Livia frequently had to turn a blind eye to Octavianís extramarital affairs (which, we are told, were numerous).\n\nThe five-year Triumviral pact expired in 37 B.C., and Octavia (the sister to one Triumvir, and wife to another) was instrumental in organizing the Treaty of Tarentum, at which their pact was renewed. Only one year later, in 36 B.C., the complicated situation in the West was greatly simplified when Octavianís general Agrippa defeated Sextus Pompey in a pitched naval battle off the coast of Sicily.\n\nNot only did this remove Sextus Pompey, the last member of the Pompeiian party, but during the campaign the least charismatic Triumvir, Lepidus (who had control of Africa), came into conflict with Octavian. In that same year, Lepidus was thus stripped of all honors except that of pontifex maximus (high priest). The Roman world was now exclusively in the hands of Octavian and Antony, who parceled it between themselves. Octavian received the West, and Antony took command in the wealthier East.\n\nWith the geographical separation came also a political division between Octavian and Antony. Octavian focused on restoring peace in Italy, where his support grew enormously. From 35 to 33 B.C. he was mainly occupied with wars in Illyria and Dalmatia, which gave Italy greater security on its eastern front. His building projects, headed by his lieutenant Agrippa, only added to Octavianís popularity. In the meantime, Antony became more estranged to the Italians. His recalcitrant treatment of his wife, Octavia (Octavianís sister), in favor of the Egyptian queen Cleopatra VII, only worsened public opinion. Furthermore, Octavian fiendishly revealed the contents of Antonyís will, which left no doubt that his tastes had become thoroughly Orientalized.\n\nEven though public opinion in Italy was moving in Octavianís favor, when the Triumviral pact (and Octavianís consulship) expired at the end of 33 B.C., the incoming consuls (of 32 B.C.) were Ahenobarbus and Sosius, both of whom strongly supported Antony. Octavian thus occupied Rome with his soldiers and terrified the senators: the two consuls and some 300 senators fled to Ephesus to seek Antonyís protection. The Triumviral Pact was not renewed, amounting to a declaration of war.\n\nIn 31 B.C., Italy and the western provinces submitted to Octavian, who assumed the consulship and officially declared war against Cleopatra VII, with the dual purpose of also eliminating Antony. The war came to a head in the spring of 31 B.C., when the armies and navies of the two warlords settled about five miles apart near the mouth of the Gulf of Ambracia on the western shore of Greece. Octavianís trusted naval commander, Agrippa, blockaded Antonyís forces, and took his toll by the end of summer. Antony and Cleopatra VII burst through Agrippaís blockade and headed for Egypt, leaving the main parts of their army and navy to stay and fight.\n\nThe epochal battle occurred on September 2 at Actium. It was a massive engagement that filled the mouth of the gulf so thickly with warships that it has often been described as a virtual land war at sea. Agrippa proved to be the better admiral, and Antonyís fleet, abandoned by its leader, capitulated. A few days later, Antonyís land forces also surrendered, and one of the great victories in Western history was complete.\n\nAfter having made their journey to Egypt, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide separately in 30 B.C. rather than be taken to Rome to adorn Octavianís triumphal procession. As the new ruler of the Mediterranean, Octavian annexed Egypt (which had been a client kingdom) as his own private territory and executed the boy Caesarion, who Cleopatra claimed had been sired by Julius Caesar.\n\nIn 29 B.C., Octavian celebrated his triumph in Rome, and the doors of the Temple of Janus were formally closed. This was a rare occurrence, for they were only closed when Rome was at peace. Octavian subsequently was hailed Imperator by the senate, but instead of being a title, it was adopted as his praenomen. Octavian began the lengthy process of disbanding his many legions by settling veterans with land grants.\n\nNow, came the artful part of Octavianís career, for after having achieved absolute power, he did not want to lose it in the same manner as Julius Caesar had nearly 15 years before. Thus began his mission to retain his absolute authority without having it appear so. Octavian declared the restoration of the Republic, and, on January 13, 27 B.C., forfeited most of his authority to the senate and the people of Rome.\n\nHe kept only his position as consul, and the provinces of Spain, Gaul, Syria and Egypt, complete with their legions. Three days later, the senate granted Octavian the title Augustus (meaning ìsacredî or ìreveredî), which he chose in preference to that of Romulus. However, his true preference was Princeps, which meant ìfirst citizen.î Under succeeding emperors, Augustus came to mean the title of office of the emperor.\n\nNote: For more details on this period, see the historical outline in the introductory section of Chapter 1.\n\nAS AUGUSTUS (27 B.C. ñ A.D. 14)\n\nAlthough Augustus had achieved far more than one might have expected from the frail teenager of 43 B.C., his career as leader of Rome was just beginning. The five years following his being hailed Augustus were dangerous ones, in which Romeís new frontiers were secured or expanded. Augustus paid close attention to the submission and organization of Spain and Gaul, two of Romeís most important provinces.\n\nIn 23 B.C., Augustus resigned his decade-long possession of the consulship, but in its place the senate granted him for life the tribuniciae potestas (ìpower of the tribunateî). In this way Augustus attained perpetual veto power, and with this gesture the Republic formally came to an end. In that same year Marcellus, Augustusí only nephew and heir-apparent, died. Since Augustus had no son of his own, and was never in possession of good health (twice recently, in 25 and 23 B.C. he had been critically ill), his need for an heir seemed urgent.\n\nNext in line was his lifelong friend and lieutenant, Agrippa, who two years later (21 B.C.) married Augustusí daughter, Julia (who recently had been widowed with the death of Marcellus). Only three years after that, in 18 B.C., Agrippa was granted a five-year co-regency with Augustus, which was renewed in 13 B.C. But the search for an heir who did not die prematurely proved to be Augustusí lifelong frustration. Indeed, he would lose no fewer than six prospects, only to be succeeded by Tiberius, the step-son whom he disliked.\n\nShortly before he began three years of travel in Sicily, Greece and Asia, Augustus turned down the senateís offer of becoming dictator. He introduced many pieces of legislation in 18 and 17 B.C. that supported traditional Roman family values. In the latter year, Augustus adopted his two eldest grandsons, Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar, and personally saw to their education in hope they might succeed him when they came of age.\n\nFrom 15 to 13 B.C. Augustus focused on the western European provinces. He resided in Gaul and annexed Rhaetia and Noricum. One of his first actions in Gaul was to establish an Imperial mint at Lugdunum in 15 B.C., and, in a related measure, to reduce the senateís jurisdiction to the copper coinages only.\n\nTwo important deaths subsequently occurred. In 13 or 12 B.C., the long-since-demoted Triumvir Lepidus died. Since Lepidus had retained the title of Pontifex Maximus, it was now available and was given to Augustus, who became the head of the Roman religion. In 12 B.C., Augustusí heir-apparent and comrade-in-arms Agrippa died. Once again, Augustus had lost a promising heir, and his only daughter was widowed in the process. Now, Augustus was without a suitable heir should he die any time soon.\n\nHaving no other personal option (for his two grandsons were only 8 and 5 years old), Augustus brought into the Imperial fold his two stepsons, Tiberius and Nero Claudius Drusus, the sons of Livia by her previous marriage. With their promotion came an increase in Roman aggression in the unconquered lands bordering the Rhine and the Danube. Nero Claudius Drusus died just three years later, in 9 B.C., from an accidental fall off his horse.\n\nNow Tiberius, who in 12 or 11 B.C. had been forced into an unhappy marriage with Augustusí daughter, Julia, was the only plausible heir in the event of an emergency. However, Augustus did not care for Tiberius, and viewed him simply as a regent for his two eldest grandsons, Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar. While this arrangement suited Augustus, it angered Tiberius, who realized that he was being used. Not only had he been forced to give up his blissful marriage to Vipsania Agrippina to enter into a hateful one with Augustusí daughter, but he now had to deal with the ìspoiledî grandchildren of Augustus.\n\nIn the meantime, Tiberiusí service to the Empire as its leading field general was being taken for granted by Augustus. The small measure of help Augustus offered in 6 B.C. ó granting Tiberius the tribuniciae potestas for five years ó rang hollow. Tiberius refused the title and ìretiredî to the island of Rhodes, where he stayed in self-exile for the next eight years. This left Augustus without a suitable heir who was of age.\n\nIn 2 B.C., after the most creative era of his principate had passed, the senate hailed Augustus Pater Patriae, meaning ìfather of his country.î As flattering as this was, it had little effect on Augustusí spirit, for it occurred in the same year he banished his only daughter Julia on a charge of adultery, for she had engaged in many affairs while Tiberius was absent. Though heartbroken, Augustus had little choice in the matter, for about 15 years before he himself had introduced the legislation (lex lulia de adul-teriis) that made adultery a public crime.\n\nTiberius returned to Rome in the summer of A.D. 2 on the condition that he stay out of public affairs. Later in that same year, Augustusí second grandson, Lucius Caesar, died, and only two years after that (A.D. 4), his oldest grandson, Gaius Caesar, died. The only legitimate candidates for the succession were now the 46-year-old Tiberius and Augustusí remaining grandson, the recalcitrant 16-year-old Agrippa Postumus. Augustus formally adopted both of them in A.D. 4., but by A.D. 7 he had banished Agrippa Postumus, who would never return.\n\nThe years A.D. 6 to 9 were fraught with military crisis, which kept the heir-apparent Tiberius busy on the frontier. Augustus soon realized that his 28 legions (which were reduced from 60 at the height of his civil war with Antony) were insufficient. Indeed, when a revolt broke out in Pannonia, it required three years of Tiberiusí full attention to suppress.\n\nJust as Rome was emerging from this crisis on the Danube, the incompetent general Publius Quinctilius Varus lost three legions to a Germanic ambush in the Teutoburg forest. Now, Augustus had only 25 legions. This devastating blow sent Augustus into depression. For several months thereafter he occasionally banged his head against doors or walls and cried out ìQuinctilius Varus, give me back my legions!î After having experienced these problems, Augustus postponed his plans to annex other European territories.\n\nDuring the last five years of Augustusí reign, he resigned himself to the fact that Tiberius would succeed him. Even so, the aging emperor may have engaged in one last attempt to repair his relationship with Agrippa Postumus, whom he had exiled seven years previously. If this were true, it may have been what killed him, for Livia is said to have poisoned Augustus either to prevent such a meeting or in response to it having occurred.\n\nWhatever the truth is, Augustus died at Nola on August 19, A.D. 14, just one month short of reaching his 76th year. Tiberius, who sped back from his journey to the Danubian front, arrived either while his adoptive father was on his deathbed or shortly after he died. Unpopular though he was, the 54-year-old Tiberius was hailed emperor. Except for the objection of the opportunist Asinius Gallus, there was no significant opposition or delay, for no one else was better qualified to succeed the great Augustus.\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: Because of the various forms in which Augustus held power, and the great length of his political career (some 57 years), his is by far the most complex of all Roman coinages. As he shaped the political system from the crumbling Republic to the Principate (from Imperium to A uctoritas, as Michael Grant so appropriately described it in 1946), the character of his coinage changed. To simplify matters, his listings are divided according to the phase of his career in which they were struck. No serious attempt has been made to catalog all of his Imperatorial or Imperial coins, and relatively little attention has been paid to his ëprovincialí coins, for he struck them at perhaps 150 mints. It should also be noted that the honorary coinage struck after his death was the largest of its kind in all Roman history.\n\nJULIA\n\nDAUGHTER OF AUGUSTUS (BY SCRIBONIA)\n\nNIECE OF OCTAVIA\n\nSTEP-DAUGHTER OF LIVIA\n\nWIFE OF MARCELLUS, AGRIPPA AND TIBERIUS\n\nMOTHER-IN-LAW OF GERMANICUS\n\nMOTHER OF GAIUS CAESAR, LUCIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA POSTUMUS, JULIA THE YOUNGER AND AGRIPPINA SENIOR\n\nGRANDMOTHER OF NERO CAESAR, DRUSUS CAESAR, CALIGULA, AGRIPPINA JUNIOR, DRUSILLA AND JULIA LIVILLA\n\nGREAT-GRANDMOTHER OF NERO\n\nJulia (often called Julia Major or Julia the Elder), 39 B.C. ñ A.D. 14. Famous for her kindness and sense of humor, Julia had little choice but to endure a tragic life. She was born to Augustus (Octavian) and his second wife, Scribonia, whom he divorced the day after Julia was born. Because she proved to be Augustusí only natural child, Julia was important to her fatherís political career from the very outset. At the Treaty of Tarentum in 37 B.C., while only a small child, she was betrothed to Marc Antonyís son Marcus Antonius Junior, who was only about 7 years old.\n\nBecause Marc Antonius Junior died in 30 B.C., Julia was wed to her 17-year-old cousin Marcellus in 25 B.C. Though this union cemented Marcellusí position as preferred eventual heir to Augustusí throne, it was not destined to last. Marcellus died in 23 B.C., apparently of natural causes, but perhaps on the orders of Livia. Augustus needed a new heir, and so he called upon his old comrade-in-arms, Agrippa, who all along had been the only serious rival to Marcellus. Julia was thus married to Agrippa in 21 B.C., even though he was some 25 years her senior and had been married several times before.\n\nIn 20 B.C. the couple produced a son, Gaius Caesar, and thereafter they had four more children: Julia the Younger in c. 19 B.C., Lucius Caesar in 17 B.C., Agrippina Senior in 14 B.C., and Agrippa Postumus in 12 B.C. No coins were struck for Julia the Younger, who (in A.D. 8), like her homonymous mother, was banished for rampant promiscuity (and apparently was kept alive until 28 by the support of her step-grandmother, Livia). Julia and Agrippa seemed to have gotten along well, and she accompanied her husband in the East from 16ñ13 B.C.\n\nHowever, this fruitful marriage ended with Agrippaís tragic death in 12 B.C. Julia was now a widow, and Augustus had lost a second heir-apparent. Furthermore, he had no other immediate heir, as his grandsons were merely children. Thus began a very unhappy stage of Juliaís life, as she was forced by Augustus and her stepmother Livia to marry yet again (in 12 or 11 B.C.), this time to Tiberius, Livia s eldest son. Tiberius was happily married to Vipsania Agrippina (a daughter of Agrippa, and the mother of Drusus) and did not want to divorce her so he could marry Julia, the widow of his ex-father-in-law. Political necessity, however, overshadowed personal desires; Tiberius would become the emergency heir, but in essence was perceived by Augustus as little more than the guardian of Augustusí eventual heirs, his eldest grandsons, Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar.\n\nTiberius and Julia proved to be completely incompatible, and the marriage was a failure. Tiberius spent as much time away from Rome on campaigns as possible, and in 6 B.C. exiled himself on the distant island of Rhodes while Julia remained in Rome. She engaged in affairs with many aristocratic men, including perhaps the poet Ovid, and Iullus Antonius, the youngest son of Marc Antony and Fulvia.\n\nFor her sexual escapades, Augustus reluctantly charged Julia with adultery in 2 B.C. and exiled her to the barren island of Pandataria, where she was accompanied by her mother, Scribonia. Suetonius tells us that this was perhaps the most tragic event in Augustusí life, and was far more hurtful even than the untimely deaths of his grandsons, Gaius and Lucius Caesars, or even the massacre of his legions under Varus in Germany.\n\nWhile on Pandataria, Julia was forbidden to drink wine or indulge in any other luxury. Five years after she was banished, Julia was allowed to reside in somewhat greater comfort in Rhegium in southern Italy. Despite this upgrade in lifestyle, Julia and her mother still lived in virtually complete isolation for the next 11 years, during which time her three sons perished. According to Tacitus, Julia died of slow starvation in 14 sometime after her last son, Agrippa Postumus, was murdered (though some scholars suggest she actually died two years earlier). In any case, she was starved because her embittered former husband, the emperor Tiberius, disconcontinued the allowance Augustus had granted her, and forbade all gifts.\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: All coins depicting Julia were struck by her father, Augustus. Her Imperial issues are of interest, for one type is most unusual, and another is controversial. On the former (represented by two issues of denarii) Juliaís bust is shown together with those of her two eldest sons, Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar. This format is interesting, but seldom yields detailed portraits. The controversial issue is a denarius from the same moneyer (C. Marius C. f. Tromentina) of 13 B.C., the year in which Augustus renewed Agrippaís tribunician power and designated him as his successor. Several coins struck by the moneyers of 13 B.C. celebrate the foundation of an Augustan dynasty in which Julia and Agrippa represented the next generation, and their two sons Gaius and Lucius (for their other son, Agrippa Postumus, had not yet been born) were considered the eventual heirs. Indeed, it is in this remarkable series that ëImperialí portrait coins are first struck for Agrippa, Julia, Gaius and Lucius. The historical context for the bust of Diana representing Julia is so strong that any doubts must be ascribed to overly cautious scholarship.\n\nMARCELLUS\n\nNEPHEW, SON-IN-LAW AND INTENDED HEIR OF AUGUSTUS\n\nSON OF OCTAVIA\n\nFIRST HUSBAND (AND COUSIN) OF JULIA\n\nBROTHER-IN-LAW OF AGRIPPA\n\nHALF-BROTHER OF ANTONIA\n\nMarcus Claudius Marcellus, 42ñ23 B.C. Marcellus ó just like the future emperor Tiberius ó was born in the eventful year of 42 B.C., when his uncle, Augustus (Octavian), had joined forces with Marc Antony to defeat the Republican forces of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi.\n\nMarcellus was the son of Augustusí sister Octavia by her first husband Gaius Claudius Marcellus (the consul of 50 B.C.). Two years after Marcellus was born his mother divorced the boyís father at the urging of Octavian, who for political reasons wanted her to marry Marc Antony. Even while a toddler Marcellus was thrown into the political mix when, in 39 B.C., he was betrothed to the daughter of Octavianís rival Sextus Pompey (though the marriage never occured).\n\nSince Augustus had no sons of his own, his nephew Marcellus was considered the foremost heir. Indeed, Augustus took a personal interest in his nephewís education in Spain, and originally betrothed him to a daughter of Sextus Pompeius. However, in 25 B.C. Augustus insisted instead that he wed Julia, the only child Augustus had fathered. Genetically this was a very close match (they were first cousins), and it is perhaps fortuitous that they did not have children.\n\nAfter this marriage occurred, there remained no doubt that Marcellus was Augustusí preferred eventual heir, but since he was still only in his late teens, he was not yet a practical one. Marcellusí main rival was his brother-in-law Agrippa, the trusted lieutenant of Augustus. The two men often clashed ó Agrippa because he believed his record of service should prevail, and the younger Marcellus because he was ìfamily.î Indeed, when Augustus fell seriously ill in 23 B.C., he gave his signet ring to Agrippa, not Marcellus, for he felt his nephew was still too young for this responsibility at that point.\n\nThe likelihood that Marcellus would inherit the throne not only displeased Agrippa, but also Augustusí wife, Livia, who had two sons of her own (Tiberius and Nero Claudius Drusus). We can be justifiably suspicious that Marcellusí sudden death in 23 B.C. at age 19 was not natural, and was perhaps engineered by Livia. Although Agrippa perhaps had the most to gain from Marcellusí death, it would seem to be out of character for him to resort to such an underhanded act.\n\nNone-the-less, Agrippa became the leading heir to Augustus, a position which was greatly strengthened some two years later when he divorced Marcellusí sister, Marcella, and married his widow, Julia. Though Marcellusí death came as a shock to both Augustus and to the people of Rome, it proved to be the first in a long line of tragic and suspicious deaths of Augustusí intended successors.\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: The coinage believed to portray Marcellus and Julia is rare and controversial. The most complicating factor is that there is no identifying inscription, and thus the attribution (even of the mint) is uncertain. However, since the coin belongs to the ninth consulship of Augustus (25 B.C.), it is likely that Marcellus and Julia are the subjects. Other authorities suggest the manís portrait is either Julius Caesar or Agrippa, and that the womanís portrait is Octavia, the mother of Marcellus. But in each of these alternate cases finding a proper context and a suitable partner in 25 B.C. is difficult, and so the attribution must tentatively remain with Marcellus and Julia.\n\nAGRIPPA\n\nSON-IN-LAW AND INTENDED SUCCESSOR OF AUGUSTUS\n\nSECOND HUSBAND OF JULIA\n\nBROTHER-IN-LAW OF MARCELLUS\n\nFATHER-IN-LAW OF TIBERIUS\n\nFATHER OF VIPSANIA AGRIPPINA, GAIUS CAESAR, LUCIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA POSTUMUS, JULIA THE YOUNGER AND AGRIPPINA SENIOR\n\nGRANDFATHER OF NERO CAESAR, DRUSUS CAESAR, CALIGULA, AGRIPPINA JUNIOR, DRUSILLA AND JULIA\n\nGREAT-GRANDFATHER OF NERO\n\nMarcus Vipsanius Agrippa, c. 63ñ12 B.C. The lieutenant and a chosen successor of Augustus, Agrippa was a close childhood friend of the first princeps, and was an ardent supporter of his until his own death in 12 B.C.\n\nAlthough of relatively humble birth (he hailed from an equestrian family from Dalmatia), he was relied upon heavily by Augustus. When Augustus (Octavian) was recalled from his studies in Apollonia following the murder of his granduncle Julius Caesar in 44 B.C., it was Agrippa who accompanied him. He was an active commander in the Perusine War, governed Gaul, and later led an expedition across the Rhine. In 37 B.C. he served as consul in Rome and he twice received the tribunician power during his illustrious career.\n\nAgrippa was the chief architect of Augustusí campaigns against Sextus Pompey, whom he defeated off the coast of Sicily in 36 B.C., thus stamping out the remnants of the Pompeian Party, and making it possible for Augustus to become the unrivaled commander of the Western Mediterranean. He also served with distinction in the Illyrian War of 35ñ33 B.C. But his greatest contribution to the building of Augustusí political career was yet to come. Indeed, it was Agrippaís genius as a naval commander to which Augustus owed his defeat of Marc Antony at the monumental Battle of Actium in 31 B.C.\n\nThereafter, Agrippa held additional consulships in 28 and 27 B.C. During the next few years, Agrippa had to contend with his brother-in-law Marcellus, who was Augustusí nephew and son-in-law. Because of Marcellusí blood connections to Augustus, the young man was intended to be Augustusí eventual heir. Not surprisingly, followers of Agrippa and Marcellus often clashed because both hoped to succeed Augustus, but each had different qualifications.\n\nWhen Augustus fell seriously ill in 23 B.C., it was to Agrippa that he handed his signet ring, for Marcellus was only 19 years old and not ready for the responsibility of ruling an Empire. But the rivalry did not last for long, for Marcellus died prematurely in 23 B.C., perhaps as the result of a cunning murder.\n\nAfter taking on a diplomatic mission in the East, Agrippa returned to Rome in 21 B.C., where he switched wives. He divorced Claudia Marcella (Major), a niece of Augustus and the sister of his former rival Marcellus (who not long ago had died) so that he could marry Marcellusí widow Julia, the only daughter of Augustus. Together, Agrippa and Julia had five surviving children, four of whom appear on coins.\n\nAgrippa spent the next two years pacifying parts of Spain and Gaul, and returned again to Rome in 18 B.C., whereupon he was given the tribu-niciae potestas for a period of five years (which was renewed in 13 B.C.). His next important mission began in 16 B.C., when he spent three years in the East settling a variety of political and military problems and established veterans in colonies. After this, he returned in 13 B.C. to Pannonia, where his presence was instrumental in stamping out a potential revolt by frontier legions. Agrippa then returned to Rome, where he died a natural death in 12 B.C.\n\nThis came as a great shock to the nation, and to his long-time friend Augustus, who had chosen him as heir to the throne. Agrippaís career was remarkably eventful, but hardly as colorful as one might expect. Indeed, it reads like a laundry list of accomplishments, tireless service, and unquestioned loyalty to Augustus. No doubt, these character strengths must have concerned Livia, who was hopeful that one of her own two sons would succeed Augustus. It is worth noting that Agrippaís career was not entirely devoted to warfare, as he also held top governmental posts and supervised several massive building projects, including one that improved the water supply of the city of Rome. Among these was the Pantheon, one of the most enduring symbols of Rome, which much later in history was renovated by the emperor Hadrian.\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: Agrippaís precious metal coinage was struck during two periods: 38 B.C. and 13ñ12 B.C. Most of Agrippaís provincial coinage occurred under Augustus, including the dual-portrait issues of Nemausus, which were struck in three phases, c. 27 B.C., c. 16ñ10 B.C. and c. 9ñ3 B.C. The most enigmatic issues of Agrippa, however, are the posthumous asses which are most often attributed to the reign of Caligula. Many scholars rightly believe the finest-style pieces were struck under Tiberius (14ñ37), and that the series continued through the reign of Caligula (37ñ41) and into the principate of Claudius (41ñ54). That they were struck by Caligula at all is enigmatic, as his disdain for Agrippa was well known. Suetonius relates: ìBecause of Agrippaís humble origin, Caligula loathed being described as his grandson, and would fly into a rage if anyone mentioned him, in speech or song Öî.\n\nGAIUS CAESAR\n\nSON OF AGRIPPA AND JULIA\n\nGRANDSON AND INTENDED HEIR OF AUGUSTUS\n\nFIRST HUSBAND OF LIVILLA\n\nBROTHER OF LUCIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA POSTUMUS, JULIA THE YOUNGER AND AGRIPPINA SENIOR\n\nGaius (Julius) Caesar, 20 B.C.ñA.D. 4. Gaius Caesar and his younger brother Lucius Caesar were adopted by their grandfather Augustus in 17 B.C., who personally saw to their education. After his father, Agrippa, died in 12 B.C., Gaius Caesar was hailed princeps iuventutis (in 5 B.C.), as he and Lucius Caesar became the intended successors of Augustus.\n\nBut the brothers were spoiled and presumptuous about their future roles in government, so in 6 B.C. Augustus tried to teach them some humility by awarding Tiberius the tribunician power for five years. But Tiberius refused the honor since he was fed up with his marriage to Julia and was not anxious to be drawn into conflict with his stepsons Gaius and Lucius. Instead, Tiberius withdrew from public service and exiled himself on the distant island of Rhodes.\n\nIn the following year Gaius Caesar turned 15, upon which he was designated for the consulship of A.D. 1 and prematurely admitted to the senate. By all accounts, his public presentation was warmly received. Gaius Caesarís first and only wife was Livilla, the daughter of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia, whom he married in 1 B.C. Livilla is better known for her later marriage to Tiberiusí son, Drusus, and for her adulterous affair with the praetorian prefect Sejanus. Though their marriage united the families of Augustus and Livia, it produced no children, and thus did not have the unifying effect their parents might have envisioned.\n\nGaius Caesar attained his first important mission in 1 B.C., when he was sent to the East to direct a campaign against Parthia, which had seized Armenia. Accompanying him as advisers were Sejanus, the future prefect of Tiberius, and Domitius Ahenobarbus, the grandfather of Nero. While in Syria, he celebrated his first consulate, and all seemed to be going well for the young heir to the throne, though the death of his younger brother, Lucius Caesar, in A.D. 2 must have come as a shock.\n\nA similar fate, however, was awaiting Gaius Caesar, who near the end of the war in the East suffered a serious wound that some 18 months later proved fatal (though some suggested Livia may have had a hand in his ìnaturalî death). Gaius Caesar died at Limyra in Lycia on February 21 of A.D. 4 while returning to Rome. His death was a shock not only to his adoptive grandfather, Augustus, but also to the people of Rome, who seem to have been fond of the young man. Once again ó for the fourth time ó Augustus had lost an heir to the throne.\n\nLUCIUS CAESAR\n\nSON OF AGRIPPA AND JULIA\n\nGRANDSON AND INTENDED HEIR OF AUGUSTUS\n\nBROTHER OF GAIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA POSTUMUS, JULIA THE YOUNGER AND AGRIPPINA SENIOR\n\nLucius (Julius) Caesar, 17 B.C. ñ A.D. 2. The younger brother of Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar was cherished by his grandfather, the emperor Augustus. The brothers were jointly adopted by Augustus upon Luciusí birth in 17 B.C. After their father, Agrippa, died in 12 B.C., the brothers became the intended successors of Augustus, though as yet they were far too young for the task.\n\nTo remedy this, their mother, Julia, was married against her wishes to Tiberius, the eldest son of Livia, who at the time was married to her exhusbandís daughter. Tiberius was to act as guardian for the spoiled boys, but both the marriage and the guardianship proved too much for Tiberius to bear, and so he exiled himself to the island of Rhodes in 6 B.C. and left his new family to determine their own fates.\n\nThe years 3ñ2 B.C. were important for Lucius, who was hailed princeps iuventutis, presented publicly (assuming the toga virilis), admitted to the senate, and designated for the consulship in A.D. 4. However, in the summer of A.D. 2, while en route to Spain to gain military experience, he died at Massalia on August 20 of an illness which some considered suspicious.\n\nAGRIPPA POSTUMUS\n\nSON OF AGRIPPA AND JULIA\n\nGRANDSON AND INTENDED HEIR OF AUGUSTUS\n\nBROTHER OF GAIUS CAESAR, LUCIUS CAESAR, JULIA THE YOUNGER AND AGRIPPINA SENIOR\n\nAgrippa Julius Caesar (formerly Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa Postumus), 12 B.C.ñA.D. 14. The third and youngest son of Agrippa and Julia, Agrippa Postumus was the last surviving male descendant of Augustus. He was born a few weeks after his father died, and as such he acquired the agnomen Postumus. However, Agrippa Postumus did not possess the noble qualities of his two older brothers (spoiled though they were).\n\nThe ancient historians describe him as being physically tough, brutish, temperamental, stubborn, rebellious, seditious and depraved. Tacitus goes so far as to call him ìa savage without either the years or the training needed for imperial responsibilities.î Indeed, from the outset the young man was unable to deal with his older co-heir, Tiberius, who was adopted along with him by Augustus in A.D. 4.\n\nThrough the influence of Livia, in A.D. 6 Agrippa Postumus was ëabdicatedí from the Julian gens and sent to Surrentum (near Pompeii). In A.D. 7 he was condemned by the senate to perpetual exile on the islands of Planasia, where he remained under guard for the next seven years.\n\nEven the boyís death in 14 was an inauspicious event, and one for which several possibilities exist. It seems that his Augustus either secretly visited him a few months before his own death (where Tacitus tells us they had a ìtearful display of affectionî) or was planning to do so. This aroused the suspicions of Livia, who feared Augustus would try to bring his natural grandson back into the Imperial fold. Since this would cost her own son, Tiberius, the inheritance he was so near to receiving, we are told that Livia poisoned Augustus before he embarked. If this were true, the grandson who had caused Augustus so much grief and pain in his lifetime proved also to be a cause of his death. Not surprisingly, after his grandfatherís death in 14 Agrippa Postumus was murdered by a staff officer who took him by surprise.\n\nTiberius and Livia could now rest assured that no grandson of Augustus could threaten Tiberiusí principate. It remains uncertain whether Agrippa Postumusí death was carried out on the orders of Augustus, Livia or Tiberius, though it seems most likely that Livia or Tiberius did it, for we are told by Tacitus that Tiberius blamed it on Augustus.\n\nIn one of the more colorful events in Julio-Claudian history, a man named Clemens, who had once been Agrippa Postumusí slave, sped to Planasia to rescue his former master and deliver him to the armies in Germany, but arrived too late. Tacitus tells us that the inventive Clemens stole Agrippaís ashes and went into hiding in Etruria until his hair and beard grew to sufficient length so that he could nearly pass as his former master. By now it was the year 16, and Clemens began to plant rumors of Agrippaís survival, which were eagerly accepted by those who sought an option to Tiberius.\n\nWe are told that many senators and members of Tiberiusí household supported the impostor, who purported to have returned to claim his rightful inheritance. But Clemensí ruse did not last long after he emerged, for he was tricked by agents of Tiberius, who kidnapped him and interrogated him in the palace. After it became clear that Clemens would reveal no useful information, he was killed. And with this story, so ends the chapter of Augustusí last biological heir.\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: Understandably few coins were struck for Agrippa Postumus. The few that exist were struck by Augustus in the provinces\n\nASINIUS GALLUS\n\nPOTENTIAL SUCCESSOR OF AUGUSTUS\n\nSECOND HUSBAND OF VIPSANIA AGRIPPINA\n\nSTEP-FATHER OF DRUSUS\n\nGaius Asinius Gallus, 41 B.C.ñA.D. 33. The son of the distinguished orator and historian Gaius Asinius Pollio, Asinius Gallus was deeply involved with the affairs of state. Augustus characterized him as a man eager for supreme power, but unequal to the task.\n\nThe death of Augustusí lieutenant Agrippa in 12 B.C. was a loss on many levels, for not only was he a superb commander and the Imperial heir, but he was also Augustusí son-in-law, and the father of his grandchildren. Thus, Augustusí daughter, Julia, was now a widow ó and far too important to remain unattached. Augustusí adopted son Tiberius was then happily married to Vipsania Agrippina (the daughter of Agrippa, and mother of Drusus), but was compelled by Augustus and Livia to divorce so he could enter a tragically unhappy marriage with the widowed Julia.\n\nThis chain of events spelled opportunity for Gallus, who married the freshly divorced Vipsania Agrippina. By marrying her, Gallus believed he had taken a step closer to the principate, but instead all he gained was the enmity of Augustusí eventual heir, Tiberius. Despite the apparent political advantages of the marriage, it seems the two were compatible, for she bore Gallus at least five sons, and Gallus welcomed his new step-son Drusus, then just a toddler, who he claimed and raised as his own.\n\nGallus had a distinguished career in government. It seems one of his earliest posts in government was the position of moneyer in about 16 B.C., after which he advanced through the cursus honorum at an accelerated pace under the patronage of Augustus. Gallus later served in the senate, was consul in 8 B.C., and then was governor of Syria from 6ñ5 B.C.\n\nThough Gallus had been friendly with Augustus, his relationship with Tiberius was understandably poor, for not only was Gallus perceived as a competitor for the throne, but his sharp wit and opportunistic marriage to Tiberiusí former wife earned him no gratitude. Tiberiusí initial hatred for Gallus only grew when the latter made a fierce remark at the senate meeting in A.D. 14 where Tiberius was being confirmed emperor.\n\nGallus later fell victim to the political intrigues of Sejanus, and was accused by Tiberius of having had an adulterous affair with Agrippina Senior. Although Gallus had enjoyed a long and fruitful career, his downfall was rapid. He was imprisoned in 30 (one year after Agrippina Senior had suffered the same fate), and even after Sejanus was executed in 31, neither Agrippina nor Gallus emerged from their imprisonment, for Tiberius had no intention of freeing these two trouble-makers. Gallus died of starvation three years after his arrest without ever receiving a trial.\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: Gallusí coinage as governor of Syria was struck in 5 B.C., and there is no doubt that this portrait issue can be attributed to him. Though there is no record of his being a moneyer, Gallus appears also to have struck coins as one of Augustusí three moneyers who perhaps served in 16 B.C. (the date of this college of moneyers is not certainly known). Though the approximately eight years between his serving as moneyer and becoming consul is less than the decade normally required, Gallus enjoyed such special patronage with Augustus that it would come as no surprise if his progress was more rapid than normal.\n\nLIVIA\n\nAUGUSTA, A.D. 14ñ29\n\nWIFE OF AUGUSTUS\n\nMOTHER OF TIBERIUS AND OF NERO CLAUDIUS DRUSUS\n\nSTEP-MOTHER OF JULIA\n\nGRANDMOTHER OF GERMANICUS, CLAUDIUS, LIVILLA AND DRUSUS\n\nGREAT-GRANDMOTHER OF NERO CAESAR, DRUSUS CAESAR, CALIGULA, AGRIPPINA JUNIOR, DRUSILLA, JULIA LIVILLA, BRITANNICUS, TIBERIUS GEMELLUS AND GERMANICUS GEMELLUS\n\nGREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER OF NERO\n\nJulia Augusta (earlier Livia Drusilla), 58 B.C. ñ A.D. 29. The influence of Livia in the construction of the Empire cannot be underestimated, for she was the first matriarch of the Julio-Claudians, and one of the most trusted advisers of her second husband, Augustus (Octavian). Indeed, for Augustusí last 52 years, Livia was perhaps the most influential person in his life.\n\nBefore marrying Augustus she was married to Tiberius Claudius Nero, by whom she gave birth to the future emperor Tiberius, and to his younger brother, Nero Claudius Drusus. However, her husband had fought against Augustus in 40 B.C. and only returned to Italy when it was safe. In 38 B.C., while she was still pregnant with Nero Claudius Drusus, she divorced her first husband and married Augustus, who had been married three times before. This marriage was a successful political union based on what by all accounts was a genuine love and compatibility, but it produced no children.\n\nLivia accompanied Augustus on many of his campaigns, and in his will she was adopted into the Julii family and given the lofty title of Augusta. She was the first lady to receive that title, and it was given sparingly until the principate of Domitian (81ñ96), after which it was granted to wives of the Augusti as a matter of formality.\n\nLivia was legendary for her dignity and chastity, as well as for her tireless efforts to clear the path for her own sonís accession. This required the banishment and murder of many people. Among her victims, it was rumored, were Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar and, even more likely, her own husband. Fearing that Augustus would try to bring his banished grandson Agrippa Postumus back into the Imperial fold (and thus cost her own son, Tiberius, the inheritance), she is said to have poisoned Augustus as a preventive measure. Livia may also be credited with ordering the subsequent murder of Agrippa Postumus to assure he would never pose a threat to Tiberiusí principate. However, it should be noted that some historians consider these accusations of murder made against Livia to have been false.\n\nAfter the death of Augustus in 14, Liviaís life became far more difficult, as her son Tiberius eagerly shed her domineering influence. Even though she had inherited the name and title Julia Augusta from her deceased husband, Tiberius refused her any additional honors. What began as mere intolerance grew with the passage of time to become hatred, and she devoted her last few years to counteracting the intrigues of her sonís praetorian prefect, Sejanus.\n\nWhen Livia died in 29, Tiberius (who was then living in self-exile on Capri) did not attend her funeral, disregarded the instructions in her will, and forbade her deification. Her death was a great loss to the many who fought hard to limit the powers of Sejanus and Tiberius, and within months Agrippina Senior, Nero Caesar (and soon after, Drusus Caesar) were all banished or imprisoned. She was consecrated by her grandson Claudius in 42.\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: Though Livia makes an impressive showing on provincial coinage during the reigns of her husband and son (and more modestly under Caligula, Claudius and Nero), there are markedly fewer dedicated to her in the Imperial series. This comes as somewhat of a surprise since she was Augustusí wife for 52 years and subsequently survived for 15 years into her sonís principate. Indeed, there seems to be only one issue of Imperial coinage which offers a portrait bust of Romeís first Augusta ó a dupondius struck grudgingly by her son in 22/3.\n\nThat the bust of Salus (health) on the dupondius represents Livia is a foregone conclusion. The supplemental inscription AVGVSTA is of great importance, for Livia was the only woman to hold the title Augusta at the time. Furthermore, its symbolism of a recovery from illness is shared with a sestertius from the same series depicting a carpentum, which certainly alludes to a supplicatio decreed by the senate for her recovery from illness. Tacitus (Annals 3.64) tells us that in the latter part of 22 Livia fell so seriously ill that Tiberius hastily return to Rome, adding that when Livia recovered the senate vote a supplicatio for her and decreed that great games (ludi magni) were to be held in honor of the Julian house. That the carpentum sestertius is inscribed Ivliae Avgvst is additional evidence, for she was given both that name and that title in the will of Augustus. The other two dupondii in this series (inscribed Ivstitia and Pietas) are traditionally attributed to Livia, but in fact neither represents her. Of paramount importance is the fact that both lack the supplemental inscription Avgvsta (which undoubtedly would have been added based on the precedent set by the Salus dupondius). Furthermore, there are a host of reasons why they are more applicable to others. See the discussions following the biographies of Livilla, Antonia and Agrippina Senior for further details.\n\nIt is worth noting that Livia was about 80 years old when the Salus dupondius was struck. That she appears to be pleasantly middle-aged is of no consequence, for it was standard since the reign of Augustus to falsify the youth of Imperial personages. The portrait on the Salus dupondius is identical to those on some provincial coins struck in Liviaís honor, most notably a didrachm of Byzantium (RPC 1779) and a bronze of Oea (mod. Tripolis) in North Africa (RPC 835).\n\nTIBERIUS A.D. 14ñ37\n\nSON OF LIVIA\n\nSTEPSON, SON-IN-LAW AND HEIR OF AUGUSTUS\n\nHUSBAND OF VIPSANIA AGRIPPINA AND JULIA\n\nBROTHER OF NERO CLAUDIUS DRUSUS\n\nFATHER OF DRUSUS (BY VIPSANIA AGRIPPINA)\n\nSON-IN-LAW OF AGRIPPA\n\nFATHER-IN-LAW OF LIVILLA\n\nGRANDFATHER OF LIVIA JULIA, AND(?) OF TIBERIUS GEMELLUS AND GERMANICUS GEMELLUS\n\nUNCLE AND ADOPTIVE FATHER OF GERMANICUS, CLAUDIUS AND LIVILLA\n\nADOPTIVE GRANDFATHER OF NERO CAESAR, DRUSUS CAESAR, CALIGULA, AGRIPPINA JUNIOR, DRUSILLA AND JULIA LIVILLA.\n\nTiberius Caesar Augustus (earlier Tiberius Claudius Nero), 42 B.C. ñ A.D. 37. Tiberius was the eldest of two sons born to Livia and Tiberius Claudius Nero, the head of the aristocratic Claudii family. His father was a strong believer in the Republic, and as such he took up arms against the Triumvirs in 40 B.C. After losing a battle he was forced to flee from the Triumvirs, and did not return to Italy until the following year. He suffered further injury when in 38 B.C. one of the Triumvirs, Octavian (Augustus), forced him to divorce Livia so that Octavian could take her as his own wife.\n\nAt the time Tiberius was 4 years old, and Livia was pregnant with his younger brother, Nero Claudius Drusus. Thus, while still a child, Tiberius was destined to play an important role in the politics of Rome. He was given his first important task in 20 B.C., when he led a campaign against the Parthians. Tiberius showed immediately that he had a flair for military leadership, and he recaptured the standards Crassus had lost 33 years before. Tiberius then tried his hand at governing Gaul in 16 B.C., and campaigned in the Alps in the following year with his brother. Tiberius then returned to Rome in 13 B.C. to assume his first consulship.\n\nIn the following year, 12 B.C., tragedy struck when the celebrated commander Agrippa died, for not only was he the husband of Augustusí only daughter, but he was also the emperorís foremost heir. Agrippaís death had dire personal consequences for Tiberius, who in 11 (or possibly 12) B.C. was forced to divorce his own beloved wife, Vipsania Agrippina. This was a doubly-cruel blow to Vipsania, who not only lost her loving husband, but who would now have to face life without her heroic father, Agrippa.\n\nBut it was not much better for Tiberius, who was forced to divorce his young, beautiful wife Vipsania (by whom heíd had a son, Drusus, who would be his future heir) so he could enter into an unhappy marriage with the widowed Julia. Tiberius spent most years of his marriage campaigning on the frontiers, as he could not tolerate Julia. During this period Tiberius was also the guardian of Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar, his new stepsons, who replaced their father as heirs-apparent.\n\nTragedy struck again in 9 B.C. when Tiberiusí younger brother, Nero Claudius Drusus, died by accident. By 6 B.C. Tiberius found the political and social environment in Rome so unbearable that he moved to the island of Rhodes, where he isolated himself for eight years. Meanwhile in Rome, his wife, Julia, was engaging in embarrassing adulterous affairs, for which she was banished in 2 B.C. and was eventually killed 16 years later. Throughout Tiberiusí self-exile his life seems to have been in danger, for the eldest heir-apparent, Gaius Caesar, did not want him back in Rome.\n\nTiberius returned in August of A.D. 2 on the condition that he not participate in public affairs. Shortly after Tiberius had returned, the younger heir, Lucius Caesar, died, and only two years after that, in A.D. 4, the oldest heir, Gaius Caesar, also died. Though the deaths of the boys must have come as a great relief to Tiberius (who was now 46 years old), it was traumatic for Augustus, whose options for an heir had narrowed considerably. Indeed, the only legitimate candidates were Tiberius and his remaining grandson, the temperamental 16-year-old Agrippa Postumus. So Augustus formally adopted both of them in A.D. 4., at which time Tiberius changed his name to Tiberius Julius Caesar and grudgingly adopted his nephew Germanicus as his son.\n\nWhile Tiberius and Germanicus went off to fight in Pannonia and Germany, Agrippa Postumus continued to estrange his grandfather, never outgrowing his foul disposition. Three years later, in A.D. 7, Agrippa Postumus was banished, never to return. With renewed vigor, Tiberius spent most of his next eight years fighting in Germany and in the Balkans (during which the Roman general Varus lost his three legions to a Germanic ambush in the Teutoburg forest) and proved once again that he was a capable soldier and a competent leader.\n\nHe finally returned to Rome in October of A.D. 12, upon which he was granted supreme power along with Augustus, who was in his 75th year. In the summer of 14, Tiberius left Rome to head an army in the Balkans, but just when he arrived, he was instructed by Livia to return, presumably because she feared Agrippa Postumus would be named successor while Tiberius was absent. However, by the time Tiberius had returned, Augustus was either already dead or nearly so.\n\nDespite the objections of Asinius Gallus (who we are told had long-aspired to the throne) and Tiberiusí displays of false modesty, the senate hailed the 54-year-old Tiberius as the second emperor of Rome in August of the year 14, upon which he changed his name to Tiberius Caesar Augustus. The change of regime did not go over well with the public or with the army. The frontier legions showed signs of open mutiny and, to prevent a revolution, Tiberius sent his nephew Germanicus to Germany, and then his son, Drusus, to Pannonia to restore order.\n\nAfter a rocky start, Tiberiusí principate was launched by a fresh offensive deep into German territory, which Germanicus had the honor of leading. Though Germanicusí work was yet unfinished in 17, the new heir-apparent was recalled to Rome, where he celebrated a magnificent triumph. In the following year Tiberius shared the consulship with Germanicus, whom he then sent to Asia to settle a variety of urgent matters.\n\nTiberius perceived the great popularity of Germanicus as a threat ó not only to his own regime, but also to the one he envisioned for his natural son, Drusus. Thus, Tiberius (it is believed) ordered his governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, to poison Germanicus when he returned to Antioch in 19. His widow, Agrippina Senior, and the people of Rome were outraged and demanded a trial. They received it in 20 and Tiberius found it politically expedient to abandon Piso, who was found guilty and killed himself.\n\nTiberius had narrowly escaped serious consequences, but in the process his goal was achieved, for now his son, Drusus, was clearly next in line to the throne. Thoughout all of the controversy Drusus had remained on the frontiers fighting, and in May of the year 20 he was recalled from Pannonia so he could jointly hold the consulship with his father, Tiberius.\n\nFather and son were on good terms when he first arrived, but with the passage of time they grew apart. In the meantime, the praetorian prefect, Lucius Aelius Sejanus, had become increasingly important in Tiberiusí regime, even though personally Tiberius did not care for him. Since Sejanus himself aspired to the throne, he was only too willing to poison Tiberiusí mind against the other possible heirs, including his own son, Drusus, with whom Sejanus had come into public conflict on more than one occasion.\n\nBut Sejanus was as crafty as he was ambitious, and he had already seduced Drususí wife, Livilla. Their adulterous affair moved from the lewd to the macabre when they conspired to murder Drusus so that they could later be wed and eventually claim the throne themselves. So Drusus was administered a slow-acting poison by his wife, the effects of which caused his death on September 14 of the year 23. The plot was so well concealed that it only became known when Sejanusí own wife revealed it prior to her own death eight years later.\n\nTwo years after Drususí murder, Sejanus asked Tiberius for the widow Livillaís hand in marriage, but the request was denied because the prefect was not a senator, but merely an equestrian, and the match was not sufficiently dignified. As major a setback as this was, it did not cure Sejanus of his ambition, for he next determined to become emperor by default.\n\nTiberius was tiring of life in Rome and in 26 he left the capital. He first established residence in Campania, and in 27 settled permanently on the picturesque island of Capri in the Bay of Naples, never again returning to Rome. He left the day-to-day business of Roman politics in the hands of Sejanus, who had become de-facto ruler in the capital. Indeed, not only did he have the backing of Tiberius, but he also had an extensive network of spies and the might of the praetorian guards behind him.\n\nIn 29, Tiberiusí 86-year-old mother, Livia, died. Their relationship had been cold for at least 15 years, and recently he had refused even to speak with her. Her estranged son, consumed by his debauched lifestyle on Capri, did not even come to Rome for her funeral. Furthermore, he refused her deification and ignored the instructions in her will. If Liviaís death was pleasing to Tiberius, it was a windfall for Sejanus, who had long combated the forceful Augusta.\n\nIn that same year Sejanus renewed his attacks on the remaining obstacles in his rise to supreme power. In 29 and 30, three leading opponents ó Agrippina Senior and her two eldest sons, Nero Caesar and Drusus Caesar ó were imprisoned or banished after Sejanus charged them with a variety of offenses, including planning to overthrow Tiberius. Now, the only possible heirs other than Sejanus were Tiberius Gemellus (the grandson of Tiberius), Caligula (the youngest son of Germanicus) and Claudius (Tiberiusí bookish and sickly nephew).\n\nThe Imperial partnership between Tiberius and Sejanus reached its apex in 31. In this single year Sejanus held the consulship with Tiberius (even though he was not of senatorial rank), and plotted to overthrow his regime. Details of Sejanusí plot, however, were discovered by Tiberiusí sister-in-law Antonia, who had become the matriarch of the Julio-Claudians when Livia died in 29. Antonia informed Tiberius of the imminent coup ó certainly not out of love for Tiberius (who probably had ordered the poisoning of her eldest son, Germanicus), but out of a desire to punish Sejanus, who had systematically targeted her grandchildren.\n\nFive years of voluntary exile had not diminished Tiberiusí survival instinct, and he arranged for Sejanusí arrest, execution and replacement all in one fell swoop. Sejanusí family and partisans were then hunted down with such speed and ferocity that it shocked contemporaries. There now remained six years in Tiberiusí principate, which the ancient historians characterize as being increasingly filled with debauchery.\n\nThe emperor was residing at Villa Jovis (the villa of Jupiter) on the eastern summit of Capri. Here, Tiberius is said to have occupied himself with literature, mythology, language, astrology and unwholesome acts of violence and sexual perversion. We are told that condemned men were thrown to their deaths from the precipitous cliffs that flanked the villa, and that if they survived the fall, they were beaten to death below by men armed with oars and boat hooks. The aged emperorís sexual exploits are equally disturbing, and the future emperor Vitellius was numbered among the young male prostitutes, known as spintriae, who indulged the emperorís desires.\n\nResiding with him on the island (and no doubt subjected to the cruelties of the environment) were Tiberius Gemellus and Caligula, both of whom were named Tiberiusí heirs in 35. Caligula was older than his cousin by a decade, and certainly was the craftier of the two, for he had made his own plans for succession by securing the loyalty of the new praetorian prefect, Macro. While on a brief excursion to the mainland on March 16 of 37, the 7 7-year-old Tiberius died in his seaside villa at Misenum in Campania.\n\nOne version ó which is not entirely unbelievable ó is that Caligula had pulled Tiberiusí signet ring from his finger before he was dead, and that the prefect, Macro, proceeded to smother the emperor with a pillow when he began to speak. In any event, the partnership of Caligula and Macro had at long last come to fruition, and the unfortunate Tiberius Gemellus was executed a few months later on a charge of treason, leaving Caligula unopposed as emperor.\n\nThough the people called for Tiberiusí desecration, his corpse was taken by armed escort to Rome where he was cremated by the soldiers, after which his ashes were placed in Augustusí mausoleum. Tiberiusí frugality, Claudian arrogance and stiff personality caused him to be unpopular among the people, the senate, and oftentimes, the army. Indeed, it can rightly be said that he neither sought, nor received the love of his people. His reign was eventful only because of the dynastic intrigues and his regrettable association with Sejanus. Without these exceptional circumstances, his reign no doubt would have been a dull affair.\n\nCuriously enough, the event of Tiberiusí reign that has had the greatest impact on world history ó the ministry and crucifixion of Jesus Christ ó was no more than a minor event in the eyes of the emperor, who at the time was occupied indulging his pleasures on Capri.\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: With Tiberius we find almost a complete reversal of the coinage policy of his predecessor, Augustus. Whereas Augustusí gold and silver offered an amazing variety of types, his aes coinage was mundane and utilitarian. Tiberiusí precious metal coinage, in contrast, was dull and unimaginative, but his aes coinage is of great interest. Not only does it offer some memorable types, but it also established firmly the practice of honoring both predecessors and family members.\n\nIn the years 22 and 23 Tiberius struck a series of dated aes dedicated to family members who, in addition to himself, included his adoptive father Augustus (sestertius and as), his mother Livia (sestertius and ëSalusí dupondius), his son Drusus (as), his daughter-in-law Livilla (ëPietasí dupondius), his twin grandsons Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus Gemellus (sestertius), and Agrippina Senior and/or Antonia (ëJustitiaí dupondius). Each of these types may be found in this catalog under the listings of the persons named.\n\nThis series is especially interesting because by 22/23, Tiberius was fond of none of these people, except Antonia (if she is even meant to be represented) and his twin grandsons (who were too young yet to have offended him or, perhaps, to have aroused his later suspicions that they were fathered by Sejanus). As such, the series is the perfect illustration of the propaganda value of coinage in the Empire, even if the messages promoted were not truthful.\n\nWhen Tiberius ascended the throne, he sent his son Drusus and his nephew Germanicus to the Danube and Rhine, respectively, to prevent rebellion by the frontier legions. Since coins of Tiberius had not yet been produced, both Drusus and Germanicus countermarked existing bronzes with the abbreviated name of Tiberius. Also of note is that billon tetradrachms were first struck at Alexandria during Tiberiusí reign for the first time since the regime of queen Cleopatra VII. Though they were further debased with the passage of time, the denomination served as the principal coin of the sealed Egyptian economy for nearly the next three centuries.\n\nDRUSUS\n\nSON AND INTENDED HEIR OF TIBERIUS\n\nSTEP-SON OF ASINIUS GALLUS\n\nSECOND HUSBAND (AND COUSIN) OF LIVILLA\n\nFATHER OF LIVIA JULIA AND(?) TIBERIUS GEMELLUS AND GERMANICUS GEMELLUS\n\nCOUSIN AND BROTHER-IN-LAW OF GERMANICUS AND CLAUDIUS\n\nGRANDSON OF LIVIA AND AGRIPPA\n\nFATHER-IN-LAW OF NERO CAESAR\n\nDrusus Julius Caesar, (often called Drusus the Younger or Drusus Junior), 14/13 B.C. ñ A.D. 23. Drusus was the son of Tiberius and Vipsania Agrippina, the woman whom Tiberius was forced to divorce in 12 B.C. so he could marry Augustusí widowed daughter, Julia. Even though he was essentially raised by his step-father, the senator Asinius Gallus, he was the only natural son of Tiberius, and thus a potential heir to the throne.\n\nDrususí prospects as heir brightened in A.D. 2 when he was hailed princeps iuventutis, and further in A.D. 4, when his father was adopted by the emperor Augustus. Though Augustus was not fond of Tiberius, he evidently saw some promise in young Drusus. No doubt, Augustus had a hand in arranging the young manís marriage to Livilla, the sister of Germanicus. The marriage occurred shortly after A.D. 4, the year Livillaís previous husband, Gaius Caesar (Augustusí eldest grandson), had died from an injury he received fighting the Parthians.\n\nThis marriage bound together the two branches of Liviaís family and served to cement Drususí position as a legitimate heir. Drusus and Livilla soon had a daughter named Livia Julia for whom no coins were struck, but who in 20 or 22 (accounts vary) was wedded to Germanicusí eldest son, Nero Caesar. Drususí prospects brightened further when Agrippa Postumus, the last grandson of Augustus, was banished in A.D. 7. This fortuitous event cleared the path for Tiberius and his son considerably.\n\nNow only Germanicus and his three sons remained as rivals. Though slightly younger, Drusus was a contemporary of his popular cousin and adoptive brother, Germanicus. Tacitus informs us that not only were the two boys good friends, but that they did not allow their apparent rivalry to come between their friendship.\n\nThe most positive development of all for Drusus, however, occurred in 14, when Augustus died and the throne was passed on to his own father, Tiberius. Indeed, Drusus played an immediate and important role when he was sent to Pannonia to cure the frontier legions of their mutinous attitudes. Much like his cousin Germanicus (who had been sent to Germany to do likewise), Drusus won the army over with his strong personality and inspirational speeches.\n\nIn the year following his fatherís accession, Drusus held the consulship, and from 17 to 20 he commanded in Illyria, for which he celebrated a triumph. The year 19 was especially eventful, for his cousin (and adoptive brother) Germanicus was murdered in far-away Antioch by the Syrian governor, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. There was no doubt in the minds of the people that Piso had acted on orders of Tiberius.\n\nOnly a few weeks later (indeed, only a few days after news of Germanicusí death reached Rome) Drususí wife Livilla gave birth to twin boys ó Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus Gemellus. With the birth of the twins (always an auspicious event to the Romans), Tiberius now had a dynasty of his own, complete with an able son and two grandsons. Now the path was clear for Drusus, who was much older than Germanicusí three sons. Indeed, what was a tragic year for Rome, was a glorious one for Tiberius.\n\nBut there was another contender for the throne ó one not yet suspected by Tiberius ó his praetorian prefect, Sejanus. Drusus was incensed at the power which Sejanus had amassed ó power no doubt he felt entitled to as the emperorís only son and the leading Imperial commander in the field. He was also perceptive enough to see that Sejanus was looking after his own interests before those of his father. Thus, Sejanus and Drusus swiftly became mortal enemies, and it was not long before they clashed.\n\nTime proved that Drusus was no match for Sejanus, who was not about to let Drusus interfere with his own grand scheme. In 21, Drusus held his second consulship and was given the tribuniciae potestas, and thus was a virtual co-ruler with his father. However, Sejanus had long been engaged in an adulterous affair with Drususí wife, Livilla (indeed, he may have sired the twin boys), and together they plotted to remove Drusus from contention. Sejanus convinced Livilla to administer a slow-acting poison, from which Drusus died on September 14, 23. So ended the story of Drusus.\n\nHis father, Tiberius, we are told, was not particularly distressed, for with the passage of time he had become less and less fond of his son, whom we are told was vicious and of poor moral character. The young man apparently had a cruel streak and found great pleasure in killing. Indeed, the legionnaires had named the sharpest kind of sword, the drusiani, after him.\n\nThe secret of Drususí death remained concealed for eight years, and was only revealed in 31 by Sejanusí wife, Apicata, as she cleared her conscience before her own execution. With the passing of Drusus, the field of likely candidates had narrowed to the two eldest sons of Germanicus, and they proved to be the next targets of Sejanus and Tiberius. As for the two other candidates: Caligula was only 11 years old, Tiberiusí nephew Claudius was considered too sickly to be of consequence, and the twin grandsons of Tiberius were mere children.\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: Drususí lifetime Imperial coinage is limited to an as, a dupondius and a sestertius in the series produced by Tiberius in 22/23. Drusus himself is portrayed on the as, his wife Livilla is portrayed (in the guise of Pietas) on the dupondius, and the twin boys Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus Gemellus are portrayed on the sestertius. Tiberius struck silver drachms (denarii) at Caesarea in Drususí honor in 32/33 and 33/34. The central date of these two issues is 33, and since the tenth anniversary of Drususí death occurred in that year, it no doubt was the reason for this otherwise inexplicable issue. This coinage is especially appropriate since only two years before, in 31, it was revealed that Drusus had been murdered by Livilla and Sejanus. After learning of this, Tiberius no doubt felt a measure of personal guilt for having invested enough trust and authority in Sejanus that he was able to murder Drusus with such ease.\n\nLIVILLA\n\nWIFE OF GAIUS CAESAR; WIFE AND COUSIN OF DRUSUS\n\nMOTHER OF TIBERIUS GEMELLUS, GERMANICUS GEMELLUS AND LIVIA JULIA\n\nDAUGHTER OF NERO CLAUDIUS DRUSUS AND ANTONIA\n\nSISTER OF GERMANICUS AND CLAUDIUS\n\nGRANDDAUGHTER OF LIVIA, MARC ANTONY AND OCTAVIA\n\nDAUGHTER-IN-LAW OF TIBERIUS, JULIA AND AGRIPPA\n\nSISTER-IN-LAW OF AGRIPPINA SENIOR\n\nAUNT OF NERO CAESAR, DRUSUS CAESAR, CALIGULA, AGRIPPINA JUNIOR, DRUSILLA, JULIA LIVILLA AND BRITANNICUS\n\nLivia Julia or Livia Claudia (often called Livia or Julia Livilla the Elder), c. 13 B.C. ñ A.D. 31. Although little-discussed in numismatic circles, Livilla was an important lady during the principates of Augustus and Tiberius. As the only daughter of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia (and the sister of Germanicus and Claudius), she was a desirable bride.\n\nThe date of Livillaís birth is uncertain, though it must have occured sometime between 14 and 11 B.C. Her absence from the design on the Ara Pacis has led some researchers to surmise that she was born in 12 or 11 B.C., though most prefer 13 B.C.\n\nHer first marriage, in 1 B.C., was to Gaius Caesar, the eldest grandson of Augustus, and the young man in whom he had the highest hopes for succession when he came of age. Indeed, this marriage not only cemented the families of Augustus and Livia, but it also secured Livillaís eventual position as empress. Livilla accompanied her husband on his mission in the East, traveling extensively while there, but she suffered a great blow in A.D. 4 when her husband died at age 24 from a wound he received in battle against the Parthians.\n\nLivilla was now a young widow, and eligible for another political marriage. Her second and final marriage was to her only cousin, Drusus, the son of her uncle Tiberius. Augustus is said to have seen promise in Drusus, and no doubt both he and Livia were happy to arrange the marriage in hopes that it would unite the two branches of Liviaís family. The marriage occurred shortly after A.D. 4, and soon resulted in a daughter named Livia Julia, for whom no coins were struck.\n\nWe hear little of Livilla until well into the principate of Tiberius, and what we are told is less than flattering. After what seems to have been an initial period of closeness, Livilla and Drusus eventually grew apart. This spelled great opportunity for Tiberiusí prefect, Sejanus: not only did he find Livilla a worthy conquest (for he was notorious for his seduction of noble wives), but through her Sejanus perceived a method of removing Drusus from the succession. It is difficult to determine when their adulterous affair began, but it may have been early enough for him to have sired her twin boys, Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus Gemellus, to whom Livilla gave birth in 19.\n\nIndeed, at some point later, Tiberius became openly suspicious that Sejanus ó not Drusus ó was the twinsí natural father, thus making them not his grandsons. But what followed was far worse, for Sejanus was able to convince Livilla to poison her husband, Drusus, so that he could marry her as soon as she became eligible. The plan was executed with great precision, and Drusus died of what seemed to be natural causes in 23.\n\nLivilla was now a widow again, and in the year 25 Sejanus asked Tiberiusí permission to marry her. But Tiberius denied the request, explaining that Sejanusí low birth made the match impossible. Despite this setback, the two apparently continued their amorous relationship for the next six years, during which Sejanus made every sinister effort to achieve his goal of becoming emperor.\n\nIn 31, everything Sejanus and Livilla had planned came together at once, and just as swiftly fell apart. The first problem occurred when Livilla learned that Tiberius had given Sejanus permission to marry her own daughter, Livia Julia. Though Sejanus defended the marriage as a mere formality, Livilla understandably did not want Sejanus to share beds with both mother and daughter. (Note: There is confusion among the ancient historians on this matter, and it may well be that Sejanus actually got permission to marry Livilla, not her daughter, Livia Julia.)\n\nWhen Antonia (the mother of Germanicus) found a document revealing Sejanusí plot to overthrow Tiberius, she delivered it to him personally. The aging emperor had Sejanus arrested and executed. As part of Sejanusí downfall, a great many of his partisans and family were also arrested and executed. Among them was Sejanusí ex-wife, Apicata, who in the final hours of her life revealed that Sejanus and Livilla had conspired to poison Drusus. Her statement was confirmed through the interrogation of other sources, and as a result Livilla was executed in that same year that same year, and suffered damnatio memoriae.\n\nLIVIA JULIA\n\nThough there are no coins known for Livia Julia, the granddaughter of Tiberius and the daughter of Livilla and Drusus, her story is of great interest. She was born shortly after Livilla and Drusus were wed, and, unlike Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus Gemellus (who may have been sired by Sejanus) there is no reason to doubt her parentage. At the very least Livia Julia was their half-sister.\n\nShe herself was wed to her cousin Nero Caesar (the eldest son of Germanicus), either in 20 or 22 (Tacitus suggests the former, but the latter seems equally likely). Just as with her parentsí marriage, this union bound the two branches of Liviaís family. It turned out to be a promising union for Livia Julia because shortly after they were wed, her father, Drusus, died, thus making Nero Caesar the leading heir to the throne. But her clear path to becoming empress lasted only a few years, for in 31 her husband was executed on the orders of Sejanus, the prefect of Tiberius who had been having an adulterous affair with her mother, Livilla, for more than a decade.\n\nHistorians are in some disagreement over what happened next. It seems as though Sejanus pursued Livia Julia as the perfect bride by whom he could further his personal ambitions. At the height of his power in 31, Sejanus seems to have gained Tiberiusí permission to marry her. Since Livia Julia was the eldest descendant of Tiberius, she was a better marriage prospect than her mother, Livilla, with whom Sejanus was still adulterously involved. As if this werenít strange enough, it must be considered that Livia Julia was available for marriage only because Sejanus had executed her husband.\n\nBut fate quickly sorted out the loose ends. Both Sejanus and Livilla were executed in 31 for their various crimes, and the mother-daughter love triangle never came to fruition. Livia Julia survived the chaos and in about 33 married a ìmere knight from Tiburî named Gaius Rubellius Blandus, by whom she had a son named Rubellius Plautus. Since her son was Tiberiusí great-grandson ó and thus a potential rival to the throne ó he was put to death by Nero in 62. Concerning the fate of Livia Julia, we are told by more than one source that she was murdered (seemingly in 43) on orders of Valeria Messalina, the third wife of Claudius, and thus predeceased her son by perhaps as much as two decades.\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: Livilla is represented on only one coin type ó a dupondius of 22/23 issued by Tiberius in the name of his son, Drusus. However, this is not acknowledged in the standard references, such as RIC, BMC and Cohen. Though this correct identification was proposed late in the 19th Century, it was not adopted in Cohenís multi-volume treatise (which was revised and republished from 1880ñ1892), and as a result it has been largely overlooked.\n\nOf the three dupondii which Tiberius struck in the ëfamilyí bronzes of 22/23, the one which honors Livilla bears the bust of Pietas, the personification of duty toward the gods, the state, and the family. As such, Pietas was the ideal guise for the public image of Livilla. She was, after all, the wife of Drusus and the mother of Tiberiusí twin grandsons. Equally strong evidence can be found with the reverse inscription, for it is the only one of the three dupondii which bears Drususí name and titles (the other two name Tiberius). In the family aes series of 22/23, only three coins bear Drususí name in the inscriptions: the as which portrays Drusus, the sestertius which honors the twin sons he allegedly sired, and the Pietas dupondius. The three coins make a family set: a sestertius for the children, a dupondius for the mother and an as for the father. As if more evidence were necessary we should also consider that these are the only three Imperial coins bearing the name of Drusus (and, as such, they all should be of relevance to Drusus and his family). Indeed, to conclude anything other than that it is Livilla who is meant to be honored by the Pietas dupondius is simply to ignore the overwhelming evidence at hand.\n\nIronically, this issue reflects the public image of Livilla as a devoted mother and wife, in reality she was neither. Not only did she conspire with her adulterous lover Sejanus to murder her husband, but it seems likely that her twin sons were sired by Sejanus. As such, the Pietas dupondius is one of the least-forthright issues of the Julio-Claudians. For details about the other two dupondii in the series, see the Numismatic Notes following the biographies of Livia, Antonia and Agrippina Senior.\n\nTIBERIUS GEMELLUS\n\nHEIR APPARENT (OF TIBERIUS), A.D. 35ñ37\n\nSON OF LIVILLA AND DRUSUS or SEJANUS\n\nBROTHER OF GERMANICUS GEMELLUS AND LIVIA JULIA\n\nCOUSIN OF NERO CAESAR, DRUSUS CAESAR, CALIGULA, AGRIPPINA JUNIOR, DRUSILLA, JULIA LIVILLA AND BRITANNICUS\n\nGRANDSON OF ANTONIA, NERO CLAUDIUS DRUSUS, AND(?) TIBERIUS\n\nGREAT-GRANDSON OF OCTAVIA AND MARC ANTONY AND(?) OF LIVIA AND AGRIPPA\n\nTiberius Julius Caesar Gemellus, A.D. 19ñ37. As Tiberius searched for an heir to replace his own son, Drusus, who died in 23, he initially adopted the two eldest sons of Germanicus, though no doubt he hoped one of his twin grandsons, Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus Gemellus, would eventually succeed. Theoretically, both of these boys were in Tiberiusí direct bloodline, and thus to him were preferable to the sons of Germanicus.\n\nHowever, Tiberius suspected (and over time was convinced) that the twins were born of the adulterous affair between Livilla and Sejanus. Were this the case, they would have been of no closer relation to him than Germanicusí sons, and this uncertainty was always in the back of his mind. Suetonius tells that Tiberius ìhatedî Tiberius Gemellus for being born of adultery, and that as such, he likened himself to the Trojan hero Priam, who also had outlived his entire family.\n\nDuring the last years of Tiberiusí life on Capri, his options for a youthful heir had narrowed to Tiberius Gemellus and his grandnephew Caligula (the only surviving son of Germanicus, whom he had adopted as a grandson). Claudius, it seems, was still considered too sickly for the job. Tensions between Tiberius and Caligula grew on Capri, for Tiberius was aware of the latterís capacity for brutality. Indeed, the dying emperor feared for the life of Tiberius Gemellus, and Tacitus tells us that in the last few months of his life, a weeping Tiberius clasped the 18-year-old boy and said to Caligula: ìYou will kill him! And someone else will kill you!î\n\nSince Tiberius had formally adopted Tiberius Gemellus and Caligula as co-heirs in 35, there must have been ample tension between the two young men as Tiberiusí health declined. Indeed, Suetonius tells us that Tiberius spared their lives not out of personal affection, but rather due to the counsel of his chief astrologer. Even so, Caligula was not willing to leave his own fate to chance, and so he made a pact with the praetorian prefect Macro. When Tiberius died (some said with the assistance of Macro), Caligula was hailed emperor just as had been planned.\n\nCaligula then adopted his younger cousin and hailed him princeps iuventutis. But this arrangement did not last, and in the same year Caligula executed Tiberius Gemellus on suspicion of taking a poison antidote, an act which constituted treason. But Suetonius informs us that the smell Caligula detected on Tiberius Gemellusí breath was not an antidote, but medicine for ìa persistent cough which was getting worse.î\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: It would seem that only three provincial cities struck for Tiberius Gemellus, and coins depicting him are understandably rare. The earliest pieces are from Cyrene, for they show him with his father and his brother and must date prior to 23. Most likely these African issues are associated with the ëfamilyí bronzes struck at Rome by Tiberius and Drusus from 22 to 23. Later in his life, when he was an heir-apparent to Tiberius, coins seem to have been struck in his honor at Corinth and at Philadelphia in Lydia sometime between 35 and 37.\n\nGERMANICUS GEMELLUS\n\nSON OF LIVILLA AND DRUSUS or SEJANUS\n\nBROTHER OF TIBERIUS GEMELLUS AND LIVIA JULIA\n\nCOUSIN OF NERO CAESAR, DRUSUS CAESAR, CALIGULA, AGRIPPINA JUNIOR, DRUSILLA, JULIA LIVILLA AND BRITANNICUS\n\nGRANDSON OF ANTONIA, NERO CLAUDIUS DRUSUS, AND( ?)

Although ancient historical sources make appropriate references to his twin brother, Tiberius Gemellus (who survived into his 18th year and was named co-successor to Tiberius), they are understandably silent regarding Germanicus Gemellus, who died at age 5. Some authorities place his death in 23, the same year as his father died, others in 24. The word gemellus is an infrequently used form of the word geminus, which means ëtwin.í\n\nNUMISMATIC NOTE: The Imperial issue (a sestertius with the twinsís heads upon crossed cornucopias), and most likely the provincial issues, portraying Germanicus Gemellus and Tiberius Gemellus were struck by Tiberius c. 22ñ23.\n\nSEJANUS\n\nPRAETORIAN PREFECT, A.D. 14ñ31\n\nPOTENTIAL SUCCESSOR OF TIBERIUS\n\nCOMPANION OF LIVILLA\n\nFATHER(?)
