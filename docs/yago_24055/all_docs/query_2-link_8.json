        "text": "This coin, RIC I (second edition) Claudius 106, was minted by the emperor Claudius sometime between AD 50 and his death in AD 54, yet it’s not his face that graces the obverse of this coin but that of his late brother Germanicus. This is clear in the legend on the obverse, “GERMANICVS CAESAR TI AVG F DIVI AVG N,” which means, “Germanicus Caesar, son of Tiberius Augustus, grandson of Divus Augustus.”[1] The only hint of Claudius is on the reverse, in the legend which reads “TI CLAVDIVS CAESAR AVG GERM P M TR P IMP P P.” This translates out to Claudius’s full name and his many titles, “Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, Pontifex Maximus, Tribunicia Potestate, Imperator, Pater Patriae.” [2] But while this coin may outwardly seem to commemorate the memory of Germanicus, its real purpose is propagandistic in nature – to bolster Claudius’s image by having people associate their fondness for Germanicus with him as well.\n\nGermanicus, Superstar Older Brother\n\nBorn in 15 BC, Germanicus Julius Caesar was Claudius’s older brother. Their father Drusus was the younger brother of Emperor Tiberius, and Drusus’s illustrious military career in Germania earned him the adoration of Romans back home, only to die young at 29 (Cass. Dio. 1.55). Germanicus was on track to be just like his father, leading several successful military campaigns in Germania and winning back military standards that had previously been lost in the Teutoberg Forest in AD 9 (Cass. Dio. 18.57), before he was suddenly recalled by Tiberius. This was out of jealousy, Tacitus claims, although Tiberius did also give Germanicus a triumph in AD 17 (Tac. Ann. 2.26). But Germanicus died suddenly in AD 19, aged 33, a couple of decades before this coin (Tac. Ann. 2.72). His wife, Agrippina the Elder, suspected Tiberius had a hand in his death, though this hasn’t been proven.[3] Just like his father, Germanicus was held up by Romans as a shining example of the Julio-Claudian bloodline. There was a lingering feeling that Drusus would have been a good emperor had he lived and succeeded Tiberius, and Germanicus was similarly idealised, with Rome wondering at what might have been (Tac. Ann. 1.33).\n\nClaudius, Unlikely Emperor\n\nMeanwhile, living in the shadows of both Drusus and Germanicus, Claudius struggled to prove himself. Due to various disorders and illnesses he had growing up (it is unknown what these were exactly), he had been overlooked and dismissed his entire life. His own mother called him “a monstrous specimen of humanity, whom Nature made a start on but never completed” (Suet. Cl. 3). Augustus himself suggested that he be kept out of public life, saying he was “lacking and impaired in the wholeness both of his mind and of his body” (Suet. Cl. 3). Suetonius claims he foamed at the mouth when he was angry and had weak knees when he walked (Suet. Cl. 30). His family considered him a source of embarrassment, and when he fell asleep at banquets, people would throw olive stones at him and put slippers on his hands (Suet. Cl. 3). In the immediate aftermath of Caligula’s assassination in AD 41, Claudius was chosen by the military to be the next emperor solely because he shared the same Julio-Claudian blood as Drusus and Germanicus (Suet. Cl. 10).\n\nWhereas today Claudius is best remembered for his successful invasion of Britain in AD 43, something not even Julius Caesar could pull off, this does not seem to have been particularly momentous back then. Suetonius scoffs at the idea that Claudius earned a triumph for this, when it was a diplomatic victory without any bloodshed (Suet. Cl. 17). And as far as victories in Germania were concerned, there weren’t a lot of battles to excite the ordinary Roman citizen and the empire’s current boundaries remained roughly unchanged. This wasn’t to say Claudius was a horrible emperor by any means. His grand architectural achievements like the aqueduct and port improved the lives of everyday Romans (Suet. Cl. 20), but he just wasn’t awe inspiring like his brother.\n\nWhy Mint a Coin of Germanicus?\n\nIt seems Claudius still felt like he needed to ride on Germanicus’s coattails in order to secure his popularity with the Roman people. He took this so far as to specially change the law so that he could marry Germanicus’s daughter Agrippina – his niece, in other words – without it being incest (Suet. Cl. 26). The next year, in AD 50, he also adopted Agrippina’s son Nero (Suet. Cl. 27). Aveline says Claudius “felt he needed her and Nero’s name and the direct connection to the lionized Germanicus.”[4] The timing of this coin is significant in that it was minted in the years right after his marriage to Agrippina.\n\nSo although this coin commemorates Germanicus, its true purpose is to remind people that Claudius and and the famed Germanicus were siblings, that they are of the same Julio-Claudian bloodline. Following the Roman tradition that people inherited vices and virtues from their ancestors, if Germanicus was an exceptional human being that people believed \"would have restored freedom\" to Rome had he been emperor (Tac. Ann. 1.33), then by virtue of being family, this coin suggests that Claudius too deserves a share of that same idealisation. Claudius would have hoped that when people saw Germanicus’s portrait, it would prompt nostalgia and affection, leading them to hopefully associate those same feelings with Claudius and thus legitimise his role as emperor. Maybe Rome couldn't pin all their hopes on Germanicus anymore, but they did still have his brother.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] \"As - Germanicus\" n.d\n\n[2] Sear n.d\n\n[3] Ward et al 2010, p. 298\n\n[4] Aveline 2004, p. 459\n\nBibliography\n\nAncient sources\n\nCassius Dio (2011).
