These include:\n\n​Impact of the death of Augustus\n\nOne of the most important aspects of the history of this period is that Rome had only recently fallen from being a Republic. During the Republic the elected senate made decisions and ran the administration and army. However, after the creation of the Principate, individuals were able to gain personal power and appoint heirs for that power to be transferred upon after death. Rome’s history from the point of 27 BCE is this new form of pseudo-monarchy called the Principate.\n\n​\n\n​The principate saw individual men accumulate all the powerful honours, titles and positions in Roman government for themselves and the once mighty senate was reduced to an advisory body. Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius and Nero have been depicted throughout the following centuries as tyrants who usurped power form the people and acted as despots with that power. They were therefore depicted as privately immoral and personally depraved. The ancient authors give us such a bleak image of these men and their families that it is important to look outside their works for a more rounded picture of the past.\n\nArcheological evidence in the form of coins, cameos and statues help to tell a truer tale of the Roman Emperors. Modern historians have tried to look at this period of history more in terms of the imperial policies and maintenance and consolidation of the empire of Rome, rather than the personal scandals the ancients would have us believe.\n\nTHE PRINCEPS\n\nPrinceps literally means ‘first citizen’. Augustus, who ruled as first citizen over senate, army and people began the principate. The word ‘princeps’ was officially a collection of titles, powers and honours that made the ruler essentially outrank everyone else in the empire, however, unofficially the princeps was outright supreme ruler with complete military, legal, judicial, religious and administrative control over the empire. After Augustus the following four emperors only increased their own powers and eclipsed the traditional ruling body of the senate by controlling (however poorly) the whole Roman Empire. During Augustus’ lifetime Rome had gone from a Republic to a dictatorship to a chaotic mess. Augustus was seen as the peacekeeper of Rome but his role was not defined. There was no role to step into for Augustus, so between the senate and the people of Rome, one was made up. This role was a mixture of powers and titles all of which resulted in the hereditary role of the princeps.​\n\nIt was the gradual acquisition of all these powers and titles that the position Augustus was to hold was finally determined. This position could be described as that of a magistrate whose province was a combination of various powers and who differed in the immensely wider scope of his functions and the greater length of his term. It cannot be said that his word was law, but it would have been inconceivable and un-roman to question the judgment of a man whose prestige obviously outclassed that of any senator. As he held no definite office, and had no definite title, but in receiving such powers he surpassed all other Romans in authority and influence therefore his role became that of princeps or first citizen.\n\nMODERN INTERPRETATION\n\nM. Cary and H.H. Scullard A History of Rome\n\n'The first fifty years after the death of Augustus was a period of transition, during which his system of government gradually became hard set.'\n\nAugustus' reign was notable for several long-lasting achievements that would define the Empire:\n\nCreation of a position of Princep; a supreme authority, all military power and holding special political privileges\n\nFinal step in the evolution of the Roman Army from a citizen army to a professional one\n\nCreation of the Praetorian Guard\n\nExpansion to the easily defendable natural borders of the Empire\n\nCreation of a civil service outside of the Senatorial structure, leading to a continuous weakening of Senatorial authority\n\nEnactment of the lex Julia of 18 BC and the lex Papia Poppaea of AD 9, which rewarded childbearing and penalised celibacy\n\nCreation of the Imperial Cult of the Deified Julius Caesar throughout the Empire\n\n​Essentially, the death of Augustus had an enormous impact on all aspects of the role of the princeps, succession and the relationships between the princeps and the powerful institutions of Rome including the senate, the Guard, the Army and the imperial family. Augustus had set a model for the new government of Rome that was directly related to his personal power, so when he died, he left a confusing void for his successors to fill, and they were forced to reinterpret his governance for themselves.\n\nMODERN INTERPRETATION\n\nRonald Syme The Roman Revolution (pg. 501)\n\n'Succeeding ages looked back with regret to the freedom enjoyed under the tolerant principate of Augustus.

Tiberius was by birth a Claudian, son of Tiberius Nero and Livia Drusilla. His mother divorced his father and remarried to Augustus in 39 BC. Tiberius would later marry Augustus' daughter Julia (by Scribonia) and even later be adopted by Augustus and by this act he became a Julian. The subsequent emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the next forty years; historians have named it the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nLook at the family tree above.\n\nHow is Tiberius both a Julian and a Claudian?\n\nWho is Germanicus to Tiberius?\n\nTiberius is remembered as a dark, reclusive, and somber ruler ‘tristissimus hominum’ – ‘the gloomiest of men’, by Tacitus account, who had never really desired to be princep. After the death of Tiberius’ son Drusus in AD 23, the quality of his rule declined, and ended in what Tacitus calls ‘the reign of terror’. In AD 26 Tiberius exiled himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous Praetorian Prefects Sejanus and Macro. Gaius Caesar (Caligula) Tiberius’ adopted grandson, succeeded Tiberius on his demise.\n\nEARLY LIFE AND SUCCESS\n\n​Tiberius grew to maturity and took his first real steps in public life. Although the ancient sources paint a picture of Tiberius and Augustus being at odds, it appears from the facts that Tiberius was being groomed for the principate from very early on.\n\nIn 29 BC, he took part in Augustus’s triumph for the Actium campaign, riding on the left of Augustus in the triumphal chariot.\n\nFive years later, at the age of seventeen, he became a quaestor and was given the privilege of standing for the praetorship and consulship five years in advance of the age required by law.\n\nHe then began appearing in court as an advocate and was sent by Augustus to the East where, in 20 BC, he oversaw one of his stepfather's proudest successes. The Parthians, who had captured the standards of the legions lost in the failed Eastern campaigns from some 20 years earlier and formally returned them to the Romans.\n\nAfter returning from the East, Tiberius was granted praetorian rank and, in 13 BC, he became consul.\n\nBetween his praetorship and consulship, he was on active duty with his brother, Nero Claudius Drusus, combating the tribes in the Alps.\n\nIn 16 BC he discovered the sources of the Danube, and soon afterwards the bend of the middle course.\n\nHis personal life was also blessed at this time by a happy marriage to Vipsania Agrippina, the daughter of Augustus’s life-long friend and right-hand man, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. The marriage probably took place in 20 BC or 19 BC and during his consulship of 13 BC, his wife produced a son, Julius Caesar Drusus.\n\nquestions\n\n1.Who was Tiberus’\n\nMother\n\nFather\n\nBrother\n\nBrothers' wife\n\nWives\n\nChildren\n\nGrandchildren\n\n2.List some of the early successes of Tiberius.\n\nVipsania Agrippina - Tiberius' first wife and mother to their child Drusus\n\nIn 12 BC Agrippa died, and Tiberius, on Augustus’s insistence, divorced his wife again pregnant wife Vipsania and married Agrippa's widow, Julia Caesaris, who was also Augustus' daughter. The union was not a happy one and produced one child who died as an infant. Tiberius had been happily married to Vipsania and, following an embarrassing display in public, care was taken that their paths should never again cross. Nevertheless, Tiberius's elevation in his stepfather's succession scheme continued. He received important military commissions in Pannonia and Germania between 12 BC and 6 BC and proved very successful in the field. He was consul for a second time in 7 BC, and, in 6 BC, he was granted Tribunical power (tribunicia potestas) and an extensive commission in the East. In essence, Tiberius had replaced Agrippa as Augustus’s successor. He was Julia's husband, the leading general in the state, and he enjoyed a share of the emperor's power. Everything seemed settled, until the darker side of Tiberius's personality intervened.\n\n​Imperial family and problems of the succession: Julia\n\nLucius and Gaius Caesar - sons of Julia Caesaris and adopted heirs of Augustus\n\nAgrippa died in 12 BCE and Julia gave birth to AgrippaPosthumous after his fathers death that same year. In 11 BCE, the moment the official mourning period was over; Augustus married her to Tiberius, Livia’s eldest son. Tiberius was already happily married to Vipsania (the daughter of Agrippa to one of his previous marriages) with a son to her called Drusus. The marriage between Julia and Tiberius was an unhappy one. Julia -according to the sources- felt that she had married beneath herself. They had a child called Tiberillus who died in infancy and they never had children again.\n\nWhen Tiberius was sent to the East to deal with the rebellious provinces Julia went ‘bad’. She committed adultery, indulged in drunken revels in the forum and generally was indecent.\n\nJulia on the Ara Pacis\n\nANCIENT SOURCE:\n\nSeneca\n\nShe (Julia Caesaris) had daily resorted to….laying aside the role of the adulteress, there sold her favours and sought the right to every indulgence with even and unknown paramour...\n\nIn 6 BCE Tiberius returned to Rome after years in the provinces to find his wife an adulteress. The sources recount that to escape the humiliation, and get far away from Julia, Tiberius retired prematurely to the island of Rhodes.\n\nIn 2 BCE informers told Augustus about his daughter’s scandalous behaviour. While at first Augustus refused to believe the charges against her, he soon became enraged and sent a detailed list of her crimes to the senate, ignoring his own laws he divorced her from Tiberius, and without allowing her to defend herself, he sent her ad her daughter Julia Minor (who was also accused of sexual misconduct) into exile on the rock island of Pandateria. Julia’s mother Scribonia accompanied her daughter in exile voluntarily.\n\nIn 4 CE she was moved to the island of Rhegium where she died in 14 CE at the age of 54.

How did Augustus use Julia as a political pawn?\n\nTIBERIUS WITHDRAWS\n\n​Without warning, in 6 BCE Tiberius announced his withdrawal from public life and went to live on Rhodes with some personal friends and an astrologer. Micheal Grant assures that Tiberius was moving away to remove himself from standing in the way of Gaius and Lucius, Agrippa’s sons and clear heirs. Whatever his motivation, the move was not only a snub to Augustus, but it was also highly inconvenient to his succession plans. Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar were still too young to assume the heavy responsibilities of the Principate, and Augustus now had no immediate successor to assume power and see the boys to maturity, since Tiberius's brother Drusus had died of an illness in 9 BCE. If anything had befallen Augustus during that time, the Principate would have crumbled.\n\nANCIENT SOURCE:\n\nSuetonius\n\n'At the flood-tide of success, though in the prime of life and health, he suddenly decided to go into retirement and to withdraw as far as possible from the centre of the stage; perhaps from disgust at his wife, whom he dared neither accuse nor put away, though he could no longer endure her; or perhaps, avoiding the contempt born of familiarity, to keep up his prestige by absence, or even add to it, in case his country should ever need him.\n\nAccordingly he remained in Rhodes against his will, having with difficulty through his mother's aid secured permission that, while away from Rome, he should have the title of legatus of Augustus, so as to conceal his disgrace. Then in very truth he lived not only in private, but even in danger and fear, secluded in his country away from the sea, and shunning the attentions of those that sailed that way; these, however, were constantly thrust on him, since no general or magistrate who was on his way to any province failed to put in at Rhodes. He had besides reasons for still greater anxiety; for when he had crossed to Samos to visit his stepson Gaius, who had been made governor of the Orient, he found him somewhat estranged through the slanders of Marcus Lollius, a member of Gaius' staff and his guardian. He also incurred the suspicion of having through some centurions of his appointment, who were returning to camp after a furlough, sent messages to several persons which were of an ambiguous character and apparently designed to incite them to revolution. On being informed by Augustus of this suspicion, he unceasingly demanded the appointment of someone, of any rank whatsoever, to keep watch over his actions and words.'\n\nWhatever had been Augustus’s opinion of Tiberius, he seems to have had little patience with, or affection, for him after his exile. Something of Augustus’s irritation is revealed by his repeated refusal to allow Tiberius to return to Rome after Tiberius realized the delicacy of his position on Rhodes; and this in spite of pressure brought to bear on Augustus by his influential and persuasive wife, Livia. When Tiberius's Tribunical powers ran out in 1 BC, they were not renewed, and his situation became even more precarious. According to Suetonius, he was expecting a ship bearing the order for his death. When the ship arrived in 2 CE, however, it brought quite different tidings.\n\n​\n\n​Tragedy worked for the benefit of Tiberius. In 2, Lucius Caesar died of an illness at Massilia. Augustus, resistant to the idea of allowing Tiberius to return, finally yielded to the requests of Livia and Gaius Caesar. At this time Julia was exposed as an adulteress and sent into exile. Tiberius returned to Rome and lived as a private citizen when, unexpectedly, Gaius Caesar died of a wound received during a siege in Armenia. Augustus, devastated, was left without his adoptive sons and, more importantly, without an heir and successor. His careful planning for the succession had come to nothing. In the crisis, he turned once more to Tiberius.\n\nANCIENT SOURCE:\n\nSuetonius\n\nWhen Gaius and Lucius died within three years, he was adopted by Augustus along with their brother Marcus Agrippa, being himself first compelled to adopt his nephew Germanicus.\n\nquestion\n\nWhat seemed to be the tradition of succession that Augustus was establishing?\n\n​​The Senate: changing role and responsibilities\n\nThe accession of Tiberius proved intensely awkward. After Augustus had been buried and deified, and his will read and honoured, the Senate convened on 18 September to inaugurate the new reign and officially \"confirm\" Tiberius as emperor. Such a transfer of power had never happened before, and nobody, including Tiberius, appears to have known what to do.\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to imitate the tact of Augustus, Tiberius donned the mask of the reluctant public servant -- and botched the performance. Rather than tactful, he came across to the Senators as obdurate and obstructive. He declared that he was too old for the responsibilities of the Principate, said he did not want the job, and asked if he could just take one part of the government for himself. One senator asked “which branch do you desire to be handed over to you?” This question highlighted the fact that all of the functions of the senate were inseparable and was also an attempt to get Tiberius to admit the senate needed a single leader, not many. Tiberius seems to have sensed the dilemma and did not answer. The Senate was confused, not knowing how to read his behaviour. Finally, one senator asked pointedly, \"Sire, for how long will you allow the State to be without a head?\".\n\nGrant states that ‘what he wanted to point out was the appalling burden of work he was taking on’. He says that Tiberius had already been working intensely hard for the role, and had been pushed aside as Augustus advanced the juvenile Gaius and Lucius at Tiberius’ expense. And he had ruined his private life by divorcing his beloved wife and remarrying him to the uncontrollable Julia. Robert Syme remarks ‘For him, the splendid prize was spoiled and tarnished’.\n\nTiberius relented and accepted the power of imperium for life. According to Tacitus and Suetonius, he refused to bear the titles Pater Patriae, Imperator, and Augustus, and declined the most solid emblem on the Princeps, the Civic Crown. As one of his contemporaries remarked ‘Tiberius, in spite of all his experience, has been transformed and deranged by the force of absolute power’.\n\nThe first meeting between the Senate and the new Emperor established a blueprint for their later interaction. Throughout his reign, Tiberius was to baffle, befuddle, and frighten the Senators. He seems to have hoped that they would act on his implicit desires rather than on his explicit requests.\n\nANCIENT SOURCE\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\n'Though Tiberius did not hesitate at once to assume and to exercise the imperial authority, surrounding himself with a guard of soldiers, that is, with the actual power and the outward sign of sovereignty, yet he refused the title for a long time, with barefaced hypocrisy now upbraiding his friends who urged him to accept it, saying that they did not realize what a monster the empire was, and now by evasive answers and calculating hesitancy keeping the Senators in suspense when they implored him to yield, and fell at his feet.\n\nThe army in Germania was, besides, reluctant to accept an emperor who was not its own choice, and with the greatest urgency besought Germanicus, their commander at the time, to assume the purple, in spite of his positive refusal. Fear of this possibility in particular led Tiberius to ask the Senate for any part in the administration that it might please them to assign him, saying that no one man could bear the whole burden without a colleague, or even several colleagues. He also feigned ill-health, to induce Germanicus to wait with more patience for a speedy succession, or at least for a share in the sovereignty.\n\nHe even introduced a semblance of free government by maintaining the ancient dignity and powers of the Senate and the magistrates; for there was no matter of public or private business so small or so great that he did not lay it before the Senators, consulting them about revenues and monopolies, constructing and restoring public buildings, and even about levying and disbanding the soldiers, and the disposal of the legionaries and auxiliaries; finally about the extension of military commands and appointments to the conduct of wars, and the form and content of his replies to the letters of kings.'\n\nOvid – Ex Ponto\n\nOffered the reigns of empire, Tiberius took them after frequent refusal\n\nVelleius Paterculus\n\n(Tiberius) … refused the principate almost longer than others have fought to seize it'\n\nTiberius tried to maintain a good relationship with the senate, however the senate had become servile under the reign of Augustus and was used to flattery and subservience. Tiberius on the other hand demanded independent thought and expected the senate to carry out its traditional duties. He enhanced the power and prestige of the senate early on, allowing them to elect magistrates and expanding their judicial functions to conduct state trials, trials for provincial officials and maiestas.\n\nA maiesta is a treason trial, held in the senate house and usually presided over by the princep. People accused of treason would have to provide their own defense, and if found guilty they would be either executed or exiled and a third of their property would be given to the person who informed (delatores) the senate of their suspicions about the defendant. Over use and encouragement of delatores created an atmosphere of fear.\n\nMODERN INTERPRETATION\n\nMichael Grant\n\nThe delicately balanced imperial task set him by Augustus would have been too much for almost any man.

Describe the relationship between Tiberius and the Senate\n\n​Changing role of the princeps\n\nTiberius did his best to maintain the main features of the Principate established by Augustus ‘I treat all his actions and words as if they had the force of law’ he wished to have careful oversight of the administration of the empire, firm control over the army and above all exercise restraint in the use of power. He generally succeeded in these goals, however his nature was so different to the amiable Augustus that he tended to give the impression that he was secretive and hypocritical. The following characterised his role as princeps as unpopular:\n\nHe had a blunt and dull manner, and flattery did not endear him to the senate\n\nHe disliked games/ Ludi and was reluctant to provide them, thus losing popularity with the people\n\nHe rejected the traditional powers of pater patriae, imperator and Augustus which made him seem as though he rejected the responsibilities of the role of princep\n\nHe placed the praetorian guard in the castra praetoria on the walls of Rome which led to suspicion and fear\n\nHe withdrew to Capri, which showed he was not physically required for the senate and Rome to run effectively\n\nANCIENT SOURCE:\n\nExcepts from Suetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nHe so loathed flattery that he would not allow any Senator to approach his litter’\n\nFurthermore, to encourage general frugality by his personal example, he often served at formal dinners, meats left over from the day before and partly consumed’\n\nEven at the outset of his military career his excessive love of wine gave him the name of Biberius, instead of Tiberius’\n\nFor two whole years after becoming emperor he did not set foot outside the gates’\n\nIn money matters he was frugal and close, never allowing the companions of his foreign tours and campaigns a salary, but merely their keep’\n\nquestions\n\n1. What was the role of the Princeps as established by Augustus?\n\n2. How did Tiberius change this role of the princeps?\n\n3. Make some notes on the nature of Tiberius character\n\n​The relationship of the princeps and the army\n\nTiberius had a long and distinguished career with the army long before he was emperor. He had led his army to victory in Armenia, Parthia, Pannonia, and numerous campaigns in Germania. Despite this history at his accession mutinies broke out in Pannonia and Germania. Drusus and Germanicus were sent to deal with the troops.

Cary and H.H. Scullard A History of Rome\n\nHis foreign policy was also successful and adhered to Augustus’ advice\n\nDespite his difficult relationship with the Senate and the Rhine mutinies, Tiberius's first years were generally good. He stayed true to Augustus’ plans for the succession and clearly favored his adopted son Germanicus over his natural son, Drusus, as did the Roman populace. On Tiberius's request, Germanicus was granted proconsular power and assumed command in the prime military zone of Germania, where he suppressed the mutiny there and led the formerly restless legions on campaigns against Germanic tribes from 14 to 16. In order to quell the uprising among the army, Germanicus, without the instruction of the princep, tried to invade areas of Germania previously not extended in. Augustus’ will had been specific in successors not expanding Rome. Germanicus and his wife Agrippina enjoyed massive support and love from the Roman people.\n\n​Imperial family and problems of the succession: Germanicus\n\nBorn on campaign in Lugdunum, Gaul, Germanicus was the youngest son of Nero Claudius Drusus (Livia Drusilla’s youngest son) and Antonia Minor (Antony and Octavia’s daughter). His siblings were Livilla and Claudius. He was raised in Rome and was a favourite of Augustus and became popular for his military exploits in Germania. Augustus was so confident of him that he made Tiberius adopt him as his own son and heir when Tiberius was made Heir to the position of princeps. He was, therefore, Augustus’ second choice as future princeps. In his happy marriage to Vipsania Agrippina, they had 9 children, 6 of whom survived to adulthood.\n\n​\n\nThe new princeps Tiberius stayed true to Augustus’ plans for the succession and clearly favoured his adopted son Germanicus over his natural son, Drusus, as did the Roman populace. On Tiberius's request, Germanicus was granted proconsular power and assumed command in the prime military zone of Germania, where he suppressed the mutiny there and led the formerly restless legions on campaigns against Germanic tribes from 14 to 16. In order to quell the uprising among the army, Germanicus, without the instruction of the princep, tried to invade areas of Germania previously not extended in. Augustus’ will had been specific in successors not expanding Rome. Germanicus and his wife Agrippina enjoyed massive support and love from the Roman people.\n\nANCIENT SOURCE:\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nIt is the general opinion that Germanicus possessed all the highest qualities of body and mind, to a degree never equaled by anyone; a handsome person, unequalled valor, surpassing ability in the oratory and learning of Greece and Rome, unexampled kindliness, and a remarkable desire and capacity for winning men's regard and inspiring their affection. His legs were too slender for the rest of his figure, but he gradually brought them to proper proportions by constant horseback riding after meals.\n\nANCIENT SOURCE:\n\nTacitus The Annals\n\n...the memory of Drusus was held in honour by the Roman people, and they believed that had he obtained empire, he would have restored freedom. Hence they regarded Germanicus with favour and with the same hope. He was indeed a young man of unaspiring temper, and of wonderful kindliness...\n\nAfter being recalled from Germania, Germanicus celebrated a triumph in Rome in 17. While legally speaking, Germanicus had disobeyed orders from both Tiberius and Augustus, and the Roman Emperor was the only one technically allowed to receive a Triumph, the popularity that Germanicus received from his exploits across the Rhine and from retrieving the lost standards was more than Tiberius, as a new and comparatively less popular Emperor, could possibly hope to compete with. In the same year, Germanicus was granted imperium maius over the East and, in 18, after being consul with Tiberius as his colleague, he was sent to the East, just as Tiberius had been almost four decades earlier, clearly indicating that Germanicus was to be considered the heir to Tiberius.\n\nWhile in the east Germanicus made a trip to Egypt which was strictly forbidden of men in the senatorial classes and may have upset Tiberius. The elevation of Germanicus was perhaps nothing more than a show to placate the Roman populace and remove Germanicus from Rome; Germanicus died in 19 and, on his deathbed, accused the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, of murdering him at Tiberius’s orders. Piso was a long-time friend of Tiberius and his appointee to the Syrian governorship, so suspicion for Germanicus’s death ultimately came to rest at the palace door.\n\nWhen Germanicus’s widow, Agrippina returned to Italy carrying her popular husband's ashes, she publicly declared Piso guilty of murder and hinted at the involvement of more hidden agents.\n\nPiso was put on trial in the Senate, where he expected some help from his friend, Tiberius. Instead, Tiberius sat statue-like and let the proceedings take their course. In Tacitus’ account, Piso realised his peril and threatened to make public certain documents that would embarrass the Emperor. The ploy failed and Piso committed suicide; the documents were never made public.\n\n​\n\nSenatus Consultum de Cn. Pisone Patre\n\nIn a fascinating addition, a number of fragments and one complete piece of epigraphic evidence demonstrates the importance of the events surrounding Piso and his trial. The document is a very long Latin inscription (176 lines) recording a decree of the Senate passed late in a.d. 20 after the trial, suicide, and posthumous condemnation of Cn. Calpurnius Piso, the former legate of Syria. What is most fascinating is that the document implies that the people of the empire, including legions, believed that Tiberius and Livia Drusilla were somehow responsible for the death of Germanicus and that this trial has cleared their names. It is also a testament to the powerful nature of Livia Drusilla as she is openly named as having saved Piso's wife Plancina from damnation.\n\nDecree of the Senate condemning Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso\n\n​Political roles of the Praetorian Guard and army: The role of Sejanus\n\nWith Germanicus dead, Tiberius began elevating his own son Drusus, a Claudian, to replace him as the Imperial successor. Relations with Germanicus’s family (mostly Julians) were strained, but they were to reach a breaking point when Tiberius allowed a trusted advisor to get too close and gain a tremendous influence over him. That advisor was the Praetorian Prefect, Lucius Aelius Sejanus, who would derail Tiberius's plans for the succession and drove the emperor further into isolation, depression, and paranoia.\n\nAround the year 17 CE Tiberius appoints his trusted prefect of the Praetorian Guard as the sole prefect (where in the past there had always been two to keep their power and ambitions in check). Sejanus became what Tacitus tells us Tiberius calls ‘the partner of my labours’. This was typical of Tiberius as it exemplified his feeling that being princep was a burden and that he needed a partner to rule. It seems from the sources that Sejanus had imperial ambitions of his own, and attempted to link himself inextricably with the office of princep by:\n\n17CE Sejanus becomes sole prefect of the guard\n\n23CE Sejanus encourages Tiberius to concentrate the whole of the praetorian cohort into the cities eastern outskirts in a new camp called the Castro Praetoria\n\n26CE he induced Tiberius to stay on Capri offering to be his link with the events of Rome\n\nOver time he filled the provincial military commands with allies of his own\n\nHe became joint consul with Tiberius in 31CE and received full imperium\n\nHe urged Tiberius in 29CE to condemn Agrippina I- the widow of Germanicus- on grounds of treason and Agrippina I and her eldest son Nero were both exiled to tiny islands, her second son Drusus was imprisoned in the Palatine's basement, and all three died violently within a few years\n\nHe requested to marry Drusus’ widow Livilla but was refused by Tiberius\n\nHe was betrothed to Tiberius grand-daughter Julia\n\nIn 23 CE Tiberius’ son Drusus died unexpectedly. Many historians believe that Sejanus’ power was kept at bay as long as Livia was alive, but after her death in 29 CE Sejanus went unchecked. The number and frequency of the maiestas increased and the senatorial class began to live in fear of the delatores. During the same year that Sejanus reached the pinnacle of his power his imperial ambition was found out. Antonia, the widow of Tiberius brother Drusus, wrote Tiberius a letter that arrived to Capri detailing her suspicions about Sejanus political agenda, his reasons for the persecution of the family of Germanicus.\n\n​Tiberius acted quickly; he secretly instructed the prefect of the praefectus vigiles called Macro, to deliver a letter to the senate condemning Sejanus to death. Sejanus was summoned to the senate house on the 18th October 31 CE in expectation of being names heir, but on hearing the letter read, found himself trapped in the senate house surrounded by the vigiles and was promptly executed. Tiberius replaced the old guard loyal to Sejanus with the vigiles and paid them a donativum of 1000 denarii each.\n\nThe Sejanus Coin, Struck AD 31 in Bilbilis, Spain\n\nPraetorian Guards\n\nMODERN SOURCE\n\nFrom: Le Glay, M.

Among the innocent victims of the purge were Sejanus' young children. Upon learning of their deaths, Sejanus' former wife Apicata committed suicide (October 26), but not before addressing a letter to Tiberius claiming that Drusus had been poisoned, with the complicity of Livilla (his widow). Livilla too perished, whether by execution or suicide. All of which ultimately resulted in the abuse of the process of maiestas and which served to illustrate Tiberius’ cruelty.\n\nANCIENT SOURCE\n\nTacitus Annals ‘partner of my labors’\n\nHe ordered the death of all who were lying in prison under accusation of complicity with Sejanus. There lay, singly or in heaps, the unnumbered dead, of every age and sex, the illustrious with the obscure. Kinsfolk and friends were not allowed to be near them, to weep over them, or even to gaze on them too long. Spies were set round them, who noted the sorrow of each mourner and followed the rotting corpses, till they were dragged to the Tiber, where, floating or driven on the bank, no one dared to burn or to touch them. The force of terror had utterly extinguished the sense of human fellowship, and wish the growth of cruelty, pity was thrust aside\n\nTacitus tries to build in the mind of the reader the impression of a huge number and frequency of the treasons trials Maiestas that increased as Tiberius reign progresses, however the truth is that over 23 years of rule no more than 52 people were charged with treason, of these 30 were never executed. Of the twelve who were put to death, Tiberius only ordered the death of eight and the senate itself ordered four. In fact Tacitus and other sources reveal that Tiberius would not allow ridiculous or trivial charges to be heard such as insulting the imperial family.\n\nWhether true or not, the news of Sejanus complicity in Drusus’ death destroyed Tiberius who could hardly fathom that the man he had put so much trust in may have killed his son and heir. The ancient sources are convinced that this marks a change for the worst in Tiberius’s principate, and that the last years of Tiberius principate was marked by tension and fear among the senatorial classes of Rome.\n\nquestions\n\n1. Describe the ‘Reign of Terror’.\n\n2. Why is Tacitus considered a biased source for this period?\n\nAfter the Sejanus affair, Tiberius remained on Capri. Macro continued as Praetorian Prefect and no measures were taken for the succession, beyond vague indications of favor to his great-nephew Gaius (Caligula), Germanicus' and Agrippina's only surviving son, and his grandson Tiberius Gemellus, the son of Drusus and Livilla, who was still only a child.\n\nRome’s second Emperor Tiberius died at the port town of Misenum on March 16, 37, at the age of seventy-eight. In a reign of 23 years, Tiberius, despite all his faults, proved a successful continuation of Augustus’s Principate. Later writers suggested that he was smothered at the bequest of Caligula by Macro. Regardless, Tiberius was old and in poor health at his death. His complete unpopularity is proven by the failure of the Senate to vote him divine honours. Tacitus, Dio Cassius and Suetonius certainly painted a bleak picture of Tiberius and his reign. According to Suetonius: \"the people were so glad of his death, that at the first news of it some ran about shouting, \"To the Tiber with Tiberius!\" a form of punishment reserved for criminals.\n\nThe Death of Tiberius, 1864, Jean-Paul Laurens\n\n​Reforms and policies of the Julio-Claudian rulers: political, social, legal, religious and administrative\n\nPolitical\n\nTransferred the election of the magistrates to the senate\n\nIncreased the judicial powers of the senate\n\nAdministrative\n\nProvided large subsidies to lower the price of grain\n\nProvided an interest free loan fund of 100 million sestertii to alleviate a financial crisis in 33 CE\n\nReduced and unpopular tax from 1% to .5%\n\nProtected the provincials from extortion and mis-government by reforming provincial administration\n\nTold one official who had overtaxed provincials ‘you should shear my sheep not flay them’\n\nStrictly controlled finances, left a large surplus in the treasury when he died\n\nSocial\n\nMaintained public order in Rome and greater Italy\n\nDiscouraged games and restricted the number of gladiators competing\n\nExpelled actors\n\nProvided relief for victims of fires and natural disasters\n\nMODERN INTERPRETATION\n\nM.

Scullard A History of Rome\n\nHe upheld and even increased the judicial, electoral and legislative functions of the senate, but it was one of the tragedies of his reign that his well intentioned efforts to cooperate with the senate gradually broke down, partly from defects in his character, partly through undue subservience by the senate\n\nReligious\n\nCreated the Augustales, a priesthood established to maintain the cult of the deified Augustus that were drawn primarily from the freedman classes\n\nExpelled from Rome Jews and worshippers of the cult of Isis who were not Roman citizens\n\nExpelled astrologers from Rome\n\nRejected divine honours for his mother Livia\n\nRejected Provincial requests to build temples to him\n\nTiberius created the college of the Augustales, a priesthood established to maintain the Cult of the Deified Augustus (Imperial Cult). He is best remembered for having expelled Jews, worshippers of the cult of Isis and Astrologers from Rome. He rejected provincial requests to build temples to him (except for one in Smyrna after he provided funds following a destructive earthquake) and refused to grant divine honours to his mother Livia after her death, although Claudius eventually deified her.\n\nANCIENT SOURCE\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nHe forbade the voting of temples, flamens, and priests in his honour, and even the setting up of statues and busts without his permission; and this he gave only with the understanding that they were not to be placed among the likenesses of the gods, but among the adornments of the temples. He abolished foreign cults, especially the Egyptian and the Jewish rites, compelling all who were addicted to such superstitions to burn their religious vestments and all their paraphernalia\n\nTiberius (14-37 AD), with the busts of Livia and the Senate, Smyrna, Roman Province. The temple remains and site have not yet been found. This is the only archaeological reference to the temple to Tiberius.\n\n​Significance of building programs\n\nAgain Tiberius suffers comparisons to Augustus, and is found wanting in his shadow. Tacitus states that Tiberius’ building program was ‘far from extravagant, in buildings on his own behalf, and even on the public account’. Cassius Dio also states that Tiberius finished many of the buildings of Augustus, however he did not record them as his own.\n\nRestored and dedicated the temple of Concord\n\nRestored and dedicated the temple Pollux and Castor\n\nBuilt the temple of the deified Augustus\n\nRestoration of Pompey's theatre\n\nHowever:\n\nHe gave no public shows at all\n\nHe made no magnificent public works\n\nCassius Dio reports that he ‘laid out very large sums for the common good, either rebuilding or adorning practically all the public works and also generously assisting both cities and private individuals’. He replaced buildings destroyed by fires in Rome and in Asia Minor he contributed to rebuilding programs of cities which had been devastated by earthquakes. His building program provided employment and contributed to civic pride, however it was not aimed as personal glorification.\n\nChanging image of the princeps\n\n​The role of princeps is very much an image, through relationships and institutions and displays of power each emperor changes the image of princeps in his own way. Augustus left a lasting image of himself that was very much constructed by him. He used the Ara Pacis, the res gestae and his statues and coins to tell the empire who he wished to be seen as. Augustus favoured the military victor image obvious in the prima porta statue. He also portrayed himself as a builder and philanthropist in his Res Gestae. He essentially wanted to be remembered in the following ways:\n\nAs a great public works builder\n\nAs a military victor over Egypt and the provinces\n\nAs a father of the country\n\nAs a restorer of the true Roman virtues of dignity, family and humility\n\nAs linked to the divine Julius Caesar his adoptive father\n\nTiberius though, has largely been remembered as a despot. His personality has been remembered as insecure and uncommunicative, suspicious and cruel. Tiberius through the eyes of ancient writers such as Tacitus and Suetonius and Cassius Dio, has gone down in history as a tyrant who put his trust in other tyrants, was sexually depraved and could not handle the responsibility of his office alone.\n\nBy contrast Vellius Paterculus provides a positive image of Tiberius and praises his administrative and military skills. However Paterculus wrote during Tiberius lifetime and owed his position to Tiberius’ patronage.\n\nDespite this largely negative image of Tiberius via the ancient authors, the archaeological record tells a different story. Imperial coinage under Tiberius stressed his links to Augustus and the legitimacy of this accession and the various honours and offices that formed the basis of his power. Statues and busts of Tiberius were set up in Italy and the provinces. Official portrait types were created and followed in the provinces and they generally show hairstyles and facial features in common with Augustus’ portraits even though in life the two were not related. A few temples were even set up in honour of Tiberius despite him actively forbidding the practice when it was requested. The remains of statues in the provinces can be found of Tiberius is Smyrna in Asia Minor where Tiberius provided relief after and earthquake in 17 CE and in Aphrodisias as a part of the imperial reliefs on the Sebastieon.\n\nTiberius and a captured barbarian from the Sebastieon at Aphrodisias\n\nquestions\n\n1.What archaeological evidence exists for Tiberius and what does it suggest?\n\n2.What has been the lasting LITERARY tradition about Tiberius?\n\nMODERN INTERPRETATIONS OF TIBERIUS\n\nModern interpretations that ignore the scandals of the ancients, regard Tiberius as more of an apt general, who believed in the republic so strongly that he shied away from the office of princeps and empowered as much as possible, the republican institutions of Rome. His foreign policies were sound, his maintenance and consolidation of the empire was excellent. Consider the following modern interpretations of Tiberius:\n\nRonald Mellor, 1999, The Roman Historians\n\n“And yet this Tiberius retains considerable stature in Tacitus's eyes; he may be bitter, angry, and finally corrupt, but he is no snivelling incompetent. He had no Caligulan madness, Neronian frivolity. Tacitus reports that he led the armies well, that he balanced the imperial budget, that he chose good administrators, that (except in a handful of treason trials) he enforced the laws, and that he did not raise taxes. Few rulers can boast such a record, much less in an account from an admittedly hostile source”\n\nTheodor Mommsen, History of Rome\n\n“Tiberius was someone who always wanted to rule in accordance with the constitution - the most constitutional monarch Rome ever had ... If anyone could have the sense of having ruled well it was Tiberius, and yet he was rewarded for it with bitter hatred. No wonder his misanthropy was so overwhelming.\"\n\nM. Cary and H. H. Scullard A History of Rome\n\n“Tiberius lacked neither ability nor a sense of duty”\n\nM. Cary and H.H. Scullard A History of Rome\n\nThus as Augustus Tiberius had rendered the empire outstanding service as solider and administrator, so as Princeps he provided by wise administration a period of peace and stability which allowed the system time to take deeper root, marred chiefly by faults which arose from the increasing isolation into which the disloyalty of friends and the misunderstanding of senators drove him.\n\nGreg Rowe\n\nTiberius became the only Roman emperor who was neither damned nor deified.\n\nessay question (20 marks)\n\n​Using ancient, modern & archaeological sources, assess the principate of Tiberius.\n\ntimeline of tiberius\n\nBCE\n\n​27 Octavian is called ‘Augustus’ and is recognised as Princeps, First Citizen of Rome\n\n20 Tiberius wins back the lost standards of Rome\n\n12 Imperial cult begins, Marcus Agrippa dies, Tiberius divorces Vipsania and marries Julia Caesaris\n\n10 Claudius is born\n\n9 Drusus, Livia’s younger son dies\n\n6 Tiberius retires to Rhodes an island near the Palestinian/ Syrian coast in the Near East\n\nCE\n\n2 Lucius Caesar dies\n\n4 Gaius Caesar dies, Tiberius & Agrippa Posthumous adopted by Augustus, Tiberius is forced to adopt Germanicus\n\n7 Agrippa Posthumous is exiled for his debaucheries\n\n9 Lex Papia Poppaea law is introduced\n\n12 Gaius is born\n\n14 Augustus dies\n\nTiberius becomes princep\n\n17 Sejanus becomes sole prefect\n\n19 Germanicus dies\n\n29 Agrippina I (the elder) dies in exile\n\n31 Sejanus shares consulship with Tiberius, Sejanus is executed, Macro becomes praetorian prefect\n\n37 Tiberius dies\n\n2021 HSC Examination question 32 part a.\n\nTo what extent was Tiberius' reign significant for the development of the principate? (25 Marks)\n\n- GAIUS -\n\nMODERN INTERPRETATION\n\nAnthony A. Barrett\n\nWith the possible exception of Nero, no Roman emperor has made a more lasting impression on the popular imagination than Gaius Caligula. His reputation as the archetype of the depraved autocrat was acquired despite his reigning for a meager four years…\n\nGaius Julius Caesar Germanicus (August 31, 12 – January 24, 41), most commonly known as Caligula as a nickname given to him by the troops when he escorted his parents on campaign which mean ‘bootikins’, was the third Roman Emperor and a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, ruling from 37 to 41. Caligula represents a turning point in the early history of the Principate. Known for his extreme extravagance, eccentricity, depravity and cruelty, he is remembered as a tyrant.\n\nUnfortunately, Caligula's reign is the most poorly documented of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. The literary sources for these four years are meager, frequently anecdotal, and universally hostile. As a result, not only are many of the events of the reign unclear, but Caligula himself appears more as a caricature than a real person; a crazed megalomaniac given to capricious cruelty and harebrained schemes. Modern historians have gone to great legnths to reassess the action sand motivations of Gaius, most now agree that it was unlikely he was insane, and some even assert that it was possible that he was in fact very lucidly attempting to create a hellenistic-style monarchy.\n\nAfter Tiberius death, the prefect Macro at once submitted the name of Gaius for princep to the senate. The senate accepted his nominee without protest. He belonged to the Claudii family and was the only son of Germanicus and Agrippina I that had not been persecuted in Tiberius’ maiestas and had in fact spent some 5 years on Capri with his uncle from ages 20-25. Despite the fact that Tiberius has mercilessly persecuted his family, Gaius was too young to pose a threat and was thus treated as family.\n\nIn 37 CE the Praetorian Guard led by Macro, presented Gaius to the senate and he was immediately hailed as princep. Gaius’ accession was greeted with general acclamation from the people of Rome, and within the first months of his principate proved to be a new hope. He had the senate annul Tiberius’ will and Tiberius Gemellus the grandson of Tiberius was deprived of any inheritance. Within a short time he:\n\nAbolished sales tax\n\nRecalled exiles\n\nRenewed gladiatorial spectacles\n\nPaid a donativum of 500 denarii to the Guard owed by Tiberius\n\nStarted construction on two aqueducts\n\nBegan construction on a new harbour at Rhegium\n\nBuilt an amphitheatre\n\nAdopted his cousin Tiberius Gemellus (Tiberius’ grandson)\n\nRepressed delatores and discouraged maiestas\n\nThe Court of Caligula by Virgilio De La Fuente Mattoni\n\n​ANCIENT SOURCE\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nGaius himself tried to rouse men's devotion by courting popularity in every way. After eulogising Tiberius with many tears before the assembled people and giving him a magnificent funeral, he at once posted off to Pandateria and the Pontian islands, to remove the ashes of his mother and brother to Rome; and in stormy weather, too, to make his filial piety the more conspicuous. He approached them with reverence and placed them in the urn with his own hands. With no less theatrical effect he brought them to Ostia in a bireme with a banner set in the stern, and from there up the Tiber to Rome, where he had them carried to the Mausoleum on two biers by the most distinguished men of the order of knights, in the middle of the day, when the streets were crowded. He appointed funeral sacrifices, too, to be offered each year with due ceremony, as well as games in the Circus in honour of his mother, providing a carriage to carry her image in the procession. But in memory of his father he gave to the month of September the name of Germanicus After this, by a decree of the senate, he heaped upon his grandmother Antonia whatever honours Livia Augusta had ever enjoyed; took his uncle Claudius, who up to that time had been a Roman knight, as his colleague in the consulship; adopted his brother Tiberius on the day that he assumed the gown of manhood, and gave him the title of ‘Chief of the Youth’.\n\nWhere Augustus and Tiberius earned their titles and powers over time, Gaius was appointed all of them immediately and for life. Where his predecessors had been careful to disguise the almost limitless power of the principate, Gaius was much less restrained and his rule became dictatorial. He eliminated rivals and including Tiberius Gemellus, Macro, and brother in law Lepidus. Ancient sources focus on the extreme aspects of Gaius’ rule and thus ignore the more effective and rational behaviour and policies he put forward. Therefore our lasting image of Gaius is terribly hostile.\n\nquestions\n\n1. Describe Gaius’ early rule.\n\n2. In what ways did Gaius try to win popularity?\n\n3. How did Gaius treat his family?\n\n4. How are the public involved in the reverence of the family of Gaius?\n\nThe brothers of Caligula, Nero & Drusus represented as the Dioscuri\n\nHowever before many of his new reforms could be instituted and public works finished, Gaius fell seriously ill in October 37 CE. When Gaius finally recovered he awoke as a tyrant and a megalomaniac or as Scullard remarks, \"emerged as a monster of lust and diabolical cruelty\".\n\n​\n\nThere is some debate as to the chronology here. Many authors, including Michael Grant (The Twelve Caesars, 1975) and Donna W. Hurley (An Historical and Historiographical Commentary on Suetonius' 1993), state that the real break between Caligula and the Senate, and thereafter his extravagant behaviour, did not occur until 39. Though the exact cause of the argument between the young Caesar and the Senate is unclear, what sources remain, seem to indicate that the Emperor had demanded a triumph and had been refused by the Senate. What is clear is that in 39 Caligula removed and replaced the Consuls without consulting the Senate, and publicly humiliated several Senators. It is from this point on that there is a marked change in the biography of his life; the young man previously hailed as \"our star\" and \"our baby\" by the Roman people became a despotic tyrant.\n\nBetween 37 and 41 CE Gaius made himself a reputation for brutality and cruelty by:\n\nHe proclaimed himself a god\n\nHe ridiculed the senate\n\nHe gave himself continual consulships\n\nHe confiscated property from senators\n\nHe encouraged delatores and conducted numerous Maiestas\n\nHe executed Tiberius Gemellus & Macro without trial\n\nANCIENT SOURCE\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nSo much for Caligula as emperor; we must now tell of his career as a monster. And he came near assuming a crown at once and changing the semblance of a principate into the form of a monarchy. But on being reminded that he had risen above the elevation both of princes and kings, he began from that time on to lay claim to divine majesty; for after giving orders that such statues of the gods as were especially famous for their sanctity or their artistic merit, including that of Jupiter of Olympia, should be brought from Greece, in order to remove their heads and put his own in their place, he built out a part of the Palace as far as the Forum, and making the temple of Castor and Pollux its vestibule, he often took his place between the divine brethren, and exhibited himself there to be worshipped by those who presented themselves; and some hailed him as Jupiter Latiaris. He also set up a special temple to his own godhead, with priests and with victims of the choicest kind. In this temple was a life-sized statue of the emperor in gold, which was dressed each day in clothing such as he wore himself.\n\nquestions\n\n1. Who are the Dioscuri?\n\n2. What is the significance of Gaius linking members of his family with the gods?\n\n3. How can a historian try to gain a fuller picture of the princeps and their rule?\n\n​​Political roles of the Praetorian Guard and army: Macro\n\nMacro had served as Praefectus vigilum, prefect of the vigiles, the Roman fire brigade and night watch. Macro was appointed Praetorian prefect by Tiberius after the arrest of Sejanus. According to Tacitus, Macro was active in discrediting Sejanus and in directing the subsequent purge against his family and followers. As prefect, Macro wielded considerable influence. He furthered his ambitions by befriending Caligula, one of the Emperor's prospective heirs. According to Suetonius, Macro gained further favour by turning a blind eye to his wife Ennia Thrasylla's affair with Caligula, around the year 34.\n\nWhen Tiberius died in the year 37, Macro sided with the new Emperor Caligula. According to Tacitus, Macro even played a role in bringing about Caligula's rise to power, by ordering Tiberius to be killed after it was revealed that reports of his death had been premature. He was also responsible for presenting Gaius to the senate over Gemellus.\n\nMacro was confident of rapid promotion for past services but Caligula was aware of the potential threat Macro posed and soon removed him from office. According to some sources, Macro was promised the governorship of Egypt but upon arriving at Ostia with Ennia to take ship, he was instead arrested and stripped of his office in the year 38 and he and his wife were ordered to commit suicide. Macro was able to leave enough money to provide an amphitheatre for his home town of Alba Fucens.\n\nThe increasing influence of people such as Sejanus and Macro and later Burrus, show the problems of the role of the princeps in managing Rome and her empire alone. Increasingly the role of the princep and the senate is shared with military forces such as the army, it's generals, and the praetorian guard.\n\nAmpithatre paid for by Macro in Alba Fucens\n\nReforms and policies of the Julio-Claudian rulers: religious\n\nCaligula's religious policy was a firm departure from the policy of his predecessors. Under Augustus, the Cult of the Deified Emperor had been established and promoted, especially in the western empire, and was generally the first organisation established in any new Roman colony. Augustus proclaimed on multiple occasions that he was not himself personally divine; instead the Cult centred on his numen, his personal spirit, and gens, the collective spirit of his family and ancestors. After Augustus, Tiberius seems to have had little interest in the Cult, and its promulgation and expansion seems to have been on a local level and driven by local magistrates, rather than from a central organisational structure. Caligula expanded this Cult on an unprecedented scale, demanding that provinces such as Judea worship him as a god.\n\nquestions\n\n1. What controversy surrounds the ‘transformation’ of Gaius?\n\n2. What appears to be Gaius’ religious policy?\n\n3. What does Suetonius suggest about the succession plans of Gaius?\n\nChanging image of the princeps\n\nIn 39, Caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary floating bridge to be built using ships as pontoons, stretching for over two miles from the resort of Baiae to the neighbouring port of Puteoli It was said that the bridge was to rival that of Persian King Xerxes' crossing of the Hellespont. Caligula, a man who could not swim, then proceeded to ride his favourite horse, Incitatus, across, wearing the breastplate of Alexander the Great. This act was in defiance of Tiberius' soothsayer Thrasyllus of Mendes prediction that he had \"no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae\"\n\nCaligula also had two large ships constructed for himself. These two sunken ships were found at the bottom of Lake Nemi. The ships are among the largest vessels in the ancient world.\n\n​Imperial family and problems of the succession: Agrippina the Younger\n\n“…when Caligula became emperor in 37 he made the affairs of his family his prime concern.”\n\nRichard Bauman, Women and Politics in Ancient Rome\n\nIn terms of succession plans, Gaius existed in a precarious situation. He had become princeps at the young age of 25. His father Germanicus was dead, his mother, Agrippina the Elder and brothers Drusus and Nero were dead. Although he married (Junia Claudilla, Livia Orestilla, Lollia Paulina, Milonia Caesonia) he had only an infant daughter in 39CE and no heir. This meant he promoted his remaining family - his sisters Livilla, Drusilla and Agrippina and their husbands. His public promotion of his sisters was unprecedented in the Roman world and included:\n\nGiving them the rights of the Vestal Virgins, such as the freedom to view public games from the upper seats in the stadium\n\nbeing honoured with coins of a type never issued before, depicting images of Caligula and his sisters on opposite faces\n\nhaving their names added to motions, including loyalty oaths (e.g., \"I will not value my life or that of my children less highly than I do the safety of the Emperor and his sisters\") and consular motions (e.g., \"Good fortune attend to the Emperor and his sisters)\"\n\nConsider these husbands to Gaius' sisters:\n\nSestertii featuring Gaius on the Obverse and his sisters, named, on the Obverse.\n\nIn 38 CE Drusilla died. After her death Gaius had Drusilla deified which made her the first Roman woman ever to be deified. After the death of Drusilla, Julia Livilla and Julia Agrippina, his other sisters, appear to have fallen out of favour with Gaius, after having been previously given unprecedented honours in his court as the Emperors sisters.\n\nGaius appeared unexpectedly on the Upper Rhine in Germania in October 39 and suppressed a supposed brewing revolt, while there he executed Drusilla’s widower Lepidus and Gaetulicus the commander of the Upper Rhine armies and an ally of the once powerful Sejanus. Possibly these men were involved with Gaius' sisters in some sort of conspiracy against the emperor. While the facts of this whole events are murky at best, what it does point to is the increasing threat of the military in the leadership of Rome, and the influence of women in the imperial family in succession.\n\nIn 39 CE, Agrippina, Livilla and Lepidus were accused of treason and conspiring against the emperor, Lepidus was executed, and the sisters were exiled to the Pontian Islands. ​\n\nDiva Drusilla inscription\n\nDrusilla, sister of Gaius\n\nANCIENT SOURCE:\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars ‘Life of Gaius’\n\nThe rest of his sisters (Livilla & Agrippina) he did not love with so great affection, nor honour so highly, but often prostituted them to his favorites; so that he was the readier at the trial of Aemilius Lepidus to condemn them, as adulteresses and privy to the conspiracies against him; and he not only made public letters in the handwriting of all of them, procured by fraud and seduction, but also dedicated to Mars the Avenger, with an explanatory inscription, three swords designed to take his life.\n\nThe charges are likely to have had some basis, Lepidus, having come very close to imperial power only to lose his connection with the imperial family when Drusilla died, would surely have wised to marry one of the emperors other sisters, who in turn would naturally have vied to become Drusillas’ successor.\n\n​Susan Wood\n\n\"The whole affair is mysterious, the evidence disconnected and fragmentary,\"\n\n​Ronald Syme.\n\nquestions\n\nWhy did Gaius promote his sisters?\n\nDiscuss the historical probability of a conspiracy against Gaius by Lepidus, and Gaius' sisters. ​​\n\nLe concours d'éloquence sous Caligula à Lyon, Jean-Joseph Weerts, 1905-1911\n\n​The Senate: changing role and responsibilities\n\nThe senate was traditionally the ruling elite of Rome. Augustus becoming princeps had lessened their powers to that of an advisory body. There was a constant feeling in the empire that Rome would one day return to a Republic where the senate ruled and that the role of princeps was a temporary one. All administration that was not in the hands of the princeps fell to the senate and for the empire to run smoothly a good relationship between the two was necessary. Overall each emperor further reduced the senates powers by increasing their own controlling hand in affairs.\n\nGaius recalled many exiles that had been sent under Tiberius and abolished maiestas, which led to a good relationship with them in the first six months. After his ‘transformation’ Gaius treated the senate as a useless institution and behaved in an autocratic manner. At times he ignored them and at others humiliated them. He abandoned Augustus concept that the princeps and senate were a partnership. The right to conduct elections was removed from their privileges, maiestas were re-introduced, delatores were encouraged and property was confiscated. Senators became suspicious of one another and were therefore reduced to servile flattery again. Gaius demanded honours from them, including giving his grandmother Antonia the title of ‘Augusta’, his sisters given the status of Vestal Virgins, his sister Drusilla declared a goddess posthumously and Gaius demanded divine status for himself. Although the sources later state that Gaius forced his grandmother Antonia to commit suicide.\n\nANCIENT SOURCE\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nHe was no more respectful or mild towards the senate, allowing some who had held the highest offices to run in their togas for several miles beside his chariot and to wait on him at table, standing napkin in hand either at the head of his couch, or at his feet. Others he secretly put to death yet continued to send for them as if they were alive, after a few days falsely asserting that they had committed suicide. When the consuls forgot to make proclamation of his birthday, he deposed them, and left the state for three days without its highest magistrates. He flogged his Quaestor, who was charged with conspiracy, stripping off the man's clothes and spreading them under the soldiers' feet, to give them a firm footing as they beat him.\n\nquestions\n\nDescribe briefly:\n\na. The function of the senate\n\nb. The importance of a good relationship between the senate and the princep\n\nc. Gaius’ relationship with the senate\n\n​Significance of building programs\n\nGaius spent readily on public buildings although many of his works were based on self-glorification rather than addressing needs of the empire. Some buildings he began which did not fall into this category were:\n\nTwo aqueducts for Rome’s water supply, both completed by Claudius\n\nAnio Novus\n\nAqua Claudia\n\nRepaired the prison known as the Tullianum\n\nBegan improvements at the harbour at Rhegium to provide better facilities to receive Egyptian grain\n\nAqua Claudia\n\nThe Major public works that did fit the category of self glorification were:\n\nThe racecourse on the banks of the Tiber\n\nAn Egyptian obelisk inscribed with sacred to the divine Caesar, son of the divine Julius and to Tiberius son of the divine Augustus\n\nBuilt a bridge of boats from Puteoli to Baiae in the bay of Naples to ride his horse across wearing the breastplate of Alexander the Great\n\nHistorians regard these acts as examples of Gaius’ megalomania.\n\nCaligula's obelisk at the heart of St Peter's square in Vatican City.\n\n​Reforms and policies of the Julio-Claudian rulers\n\nGaius introduced no significant reforms in his four year reign. Early on he reduced taxes, and transferred the minting of gold and silver coins back to Rome. He provided lavish entertainment which he also enjoyed, and allowed more gladiators to fight than was legal. He greatly reduced the surplus that Tiberius had left in the principate treasury. After his transformation he introduced new taxes, and resorted to various forms of extortion to raise funds to enrich himself.\n\nGaius in his short 4 year reign approached the enormous role of princeps as a ‘part time job’ which greatly increased the role of the freedmen such as Helicon, his personal chamberlain who played, ate and slept with him and who according to Philo of Alexandria, was anti-semitic and was directly responsible for many of Gaius’ anti Jewish policies. Callistus is also mentioned as being one of Gaius’ freedmen in use and may have played some part in his assassination in 40 CE. Callistus went on to be one of Claudius’ closest freedmen.\n\nHe gave client kingdoms to his friends and expected their allegiance to him in return. He disposed the king of Armenia and allowed Parthia to invade, thus losing valuable ground acquired under Augustus and Tiberius. He also killed the king of Mauretania and thus sparked a rebellion there and allegedly instructed the client king of Egypt to kill himself in anticipation of his annexation (The king didn’t respond, and must have breathed a sigh of relief when Gaius was finally assassinated). He offended the Jews in both Judea and Alexandria by asking them to place a statue of himself in the Holy of Holies in the Jerusalem temple. Overall, Gaius’ administrative practices were unsound and reflected the erratic and destructive behaviour that characterised his reign.\n\nquestions\n\nOutline the nature of Gaius’:\n\nReligious policies\n\nBuilding program\n\nReforms and Policies\n\nAdministration of empire\n\nCaligula was murdered following a conspiracy amongst officers of the Praetorian Guard, who apparently acted for purely personal reasons. However, it appears that the officers had at least the support of some senators and an imperial freedman.\n\nWhat is known is that on January 24, 41CE, the praetorian tribune Cassius Chaerea and other guardsmen accosted Caligula while he was addressing an acting troupe of young men during a series of games held for the Divine Augustus. Chaerea had a distinguished record as one of Germanicus's best officers and had known Caligula since infancy. One possible motive provided by Suetonius is that Chaerea had experienced years of abuse by Caligula over his so-called effeminacy, possibly due to a wound to his genitalia; Suetonius records that Caligula commonly gave the watchwords \"Priapus\" (erection) or \"Venus\" (Roman slang for a eunuch) when Chaerea was on duty. Chaerea requested the watchword from the Emperor and after Caligula's response struck the first blow. The co-conspirators quickly moved in and stabbed the Emperor to death. Chaerea and another aggrieved tribune, Cornelius Sabinus, also killed Caligula's wife Caesonia and their infant daughter, Julia Drusilla, by smashing her against a wall.\n\nANCIENT SOURCE\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nFrom this point there are two versions of the story: some say that as he was talking with the boys, Chaerea came up behind, and gave him a deep cut in the neck, having first cried, \"Take that,\" and that then the tribune Cornelius Sabinus, who was the other conspirator and faced Gaius, stabbed him in the breast. Others say that Sabinus, after getting rid of the crowd through centurions who were in the plot, asked for the watchword, as soldiers do, and that when Gaius gave him \"Jupiter,\" he cried \"So be it,\" and as Gaius looked around, he split his jawbone with a blow of his sword. As he lay upon the ground and with writhing limbs called out that he still lived, the others dispatched him with thirty wounds; for the general signal was \"Strike again.\" Some even thrust their swords through his privates. At the beginning of the disturbance his bearers ran to his aid with their poles, and presently the Germans of his body-guard, and they slew several of his assassins, as well as some inoffensive senators.\n\nOne may form an idea of the state of those times by what followed. Not even after the murder was made known was it at once believed that he was dead, but it was suspected that Gaius himself had made up and circulated the report, to find out by that means how men felt towards him. The conspirators too had not agreed on a successor, and the senate was so unanimously in favour of re-establishing the republic that the consuls called the first meeting, not in the senate house, because it had the name Julia, but in the Capitol; while some in expressing their views proposed that the memory of the Caesars be done away with and their temples destroyed.\n\nquestions\n\n1. Why was Gaius assassinated?\n\n2. Which groups were involved in the assassination of Gaius?\n\n3. Why didn’t the senate immediately appoint a successor to Gaius?\n\nSome modern historians believe that the ancient writers paint such a bleak view of the principate of Gaius that they cannot be trusted. They point out that the ancient historians ignore the fact that his supposed personal deterioration does not happen directly after his sickness in October, nor do his policies change after this point. Some modern writers argue that the policies of Gaius at the begging of his reign do not change greatly at all towards the end and propose the theory that he may simply have progressed into a more Hellenistic form of monarchy. Some writers even go so far as to suggest that Gaius was in fact deliberately acknowledging the principate for what it was (a hereditary monarchy pretending to be a shared Republic) and was simply acting accordingly. Egypt and the eastern provinces were used to regarding their king as a god, and in this way even the religious policies of Gaius could be explained as a deliberate and not ‘mad’ move.\n\nMark Antony seems to have been his principal model in statesmanship, and Antony's daughter was probably the first to present this ancestor to him in a favourable light.\n\nEnid Rifner Parker, The Education of Heirs in the Julio-Claudian Family​\n\nWe are asked to picture Gaius as early in his reign having honoured his grandmother Antonia Minor and then after his transformation as having forced her to suicide. However, when the sources are checked it becomes clear that Antonia died on the 1st may in the year 37 CE, some 5 weeks after Gaius was proclaimed Emperor. It is also important to note that during the first 5 weeks Gaius had voyaged to Pandateria and Pontia to bring back the ashes of his mother and his brother. If the weather was fine the whole time, than historians have assumed he would have spent a total of around only 30 days in Rome before Antonia suicides. There are records that show that in late January 38 CE, Gaius sacrificed to honour Antonia Augustae, proving that he respected her even seven months after her death. All this evidence makes the tradition that Gaius forced his grandmother to suicide fairly unlikely and more likely to be a part of the negative and distorted literary tradition about the mad Caligula.\n\nParaphrased from M. P. Charlesworth, The Tradition about Caligula\n\nCaligula’s brief reign was a disaster, but the Romans had only themselves to blame. The army, in the shape of the imperial guard, injected into the imperial system the very worst feature of the final century of the Roman republic: the use of military force to determine political outcomes. The senate certainly did not emerge from Caligula’s reign with honor. They may have been under military pressure at the outset; but they have to take the lion’s share of the blame for the unprecendented and massive powers bestowed on a totally inexperienced youth. Moreover, they seem to have been willing to respond to each successive humiliation with even more fulsome flattery.\n\nAnthony A. Barrett\n\n​The sensational and hostile nature of that record, however, should in no way trivialise Caligula's importance. His reign highlighted an inherent weakness in Augustus’s Principate, now openly revealed for what it was - a raw monarchy in which only the self-discipline of the incumbent acted as a restraint on his behaviour rather than the \"first among equals\" Augustus had intended. That the only means of retiring the wayward Princeps was murder marked another important revelation: Roman emperors could not relinquish their powers without simultaneously relinquishing their lives.\n\nextended response 20 marks\n\n1. Using ancient and modern sources, assess the principate of Gaius.\n\n- CLAUDIUS -\n\nBorn Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus (August 1, 10 BC – October 13, 54), previously, was the fourth Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, ruling from January 24, 41 to his death in 54. Born in Lugdunum in Gaul (modern-day Lyon, France), to Drusus and Antonia Minor, he was the first Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy. Claudius was considered a rather unlikely man to become Emperor.\n\nHe was reportedly afflicted with some type of disability, and his family had virtually excluded him from public office until his consulship with his nephew Caligula in 37. His very survival led to his being declared emperor after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last adult male of his family. Despite his lack of political experience, Claudius proved to be an able administrator and a great builder of public works. His reign saw an expansion of the empire, including the conquest of Britain. He took a personal interest in the law, presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. However, he was seen as vulnerable throughout his rule, particularly by the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position resulting in the deaths of many senators. He also suffered tragic setbacks in his personal life. Such events led to his damnation in the literary sources of Tacitus and Suetonius. ​\n\nThere is no evidence that Claudius had a direct hand in the assassination of Gaius. However, after the deaths of Caligula's wife and daughter, it became apparent that Praetorian Cassius intended to go beyond the terms of the conspiracy and wipe out the imperial family. In the chaos following the murder, Claudius witnessed the German guard cut down several uninvolved noblemen, including friends of his. Concerned for his survival, he fled to the palace to hide himself. According to tradition, a Praetorian named Gratus found him hiding behind a curtain and suddenly declared him imperator. They reassured him that they were not one of the battalions looking for revenge. He was spirited away to the Praetorian camp and put under their protection. At the camp he promised the guard a donativum of 3,750 denarii each for their loyalty.\n\nAureus of Claudius, struck at the Lugdunum (Lyon) mint, dated 41–42. The depiction on the reverse meant to commemorate the \"reception of the emperor\" (imperator receptus) at the Praetorian Camp and the protection the Praetorian Guard afforded Claudius in the days following the assassination of Caligula. Issued over a number of years in both gold and silver, these type of coins were struck to serve as part of the annual military payments Claudius had promised the Guard in return for their role in raising him to the throne.\n\nANCIENT SOURCE\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nHe possessed majesty and dignity of appearance, but only when he was standing still or sitting, and especially when he was lying down; for he was tall but not slender, with an attractive face, becoming white hair, and a full neck. But when he walked, his weak knees gave way under him and he had many disagreeable traits both in his lighter moments and when he was engaged in business; his laughter was unseemly and his anger still more disgusting, for he would foam at the mouth and trickle at the nose; he stammered besides and his head was very shaky at all times, but especially when he made the least exertion. Though previously his health was bad, it was excellent while he was emperor except for attacks of heartburn, which he said all but drove him to suicide.\n\nThe senate meanwhile debated how to restore the Republic. Claudius was chosen and proclaimed imperator by the Praetorian Guard thus making him the first princeps to be the product of the guard without the approval of the senate. His connections with the family of Germanicus set him in high regard with the army and the people; only the senate was reluctant to see him step into office. Because of his ineffectual appearance (he stuttered and was lame) he had never been considered for the principate. He was already over 50 years old and had no real experience in public life. He had not been in the military and had really been only ever given honorary positions in the cursus honourum under Gaius in 37 CE. And even this may have been as a joke by the cruel Gaius.\n\nDonna W. Hurley\n\nThis tale of a reluctant emperor abducted against his will and helpless before necessity, served two functions in the Claudius story as it came to be told. First, it could be used to refute any suggestion that he himself was involved in the assassination (of Caligula) or had purchased the principate. At the same time, the image of a passive and fearful Claudius dragged from behind a curtain conforms to the characterisation that hounded him (and continues to this day): the perception that he was undignified, weak, and manipulated by others.\n\nImperial family & problems of the succession: Messalina, Agrippina the Younger\n\nClaudius had a difficult family life, having been scorned by his mother because of his infirmities and ignored during the princeps Augustus and Tiberius from political life. Though he was granted an honorary position on the political ladder by Gaius, however after its term was up, it was never renewed. He was betrothed in the principate of Tiberius to Aemila Lepida, the daughter of Julia Minor but when she was exiled the betrothal was ended. His first wife Livia Medullina, died on their wedding day. He married his first wife Plautia Urgulanilla in 9CE when he was 18 years old and she bore him two children, Drusus who was betrothed to the daughter of Sejanus and choked on a pear, and a daughter, Claudia. Claudius divorced Urgulanilla in 24CE for adultery with his freedman Boter, who was believed to have been the father of Claudia. However Claudia was born after their divorce Claudius thus never recognised the child as his.\n\nCameo showing Claudius and a wife - probably Messalina on a chariot pulled by dragons\n\nCameo showing Messalina and her children Octavia and Brittanicus (later names Germanicus)\n\nStatue of Messalina and a child\n\nHe married his second wife Aelia Patina sister of Sejanus in 28CE who bore Claudius a daughter Antonia in 30, but Claudius divorced her in 31CE. His third marriage in 37CE was to 15-year-old Valeria Messalina. He was 48. Messalina was very much loved by Claudius by all accounts and enjoyed various honours such as front row seats at the theatre and games and riding in the carpentum. She bore him two children, a daughter Claudia Octavia in 39CE and a son, Germanicus- whose name was changed to Brittanicus after Claudius’ conquest of Britain in 41CE. Messalina eliminated rivals including Livilla, Agrippina II’s sister who was exiled to Pandeteria and then starved to death on the island, and Seneca who was exiled to Corsica and only returned after Messalina’s death.\n\nAccording to the ancient sources, Messalina exercised considerable influence over Claudius who apparently failed to see her many infidelities, such as visiting brothels, organising orgies and apparently sleeping with 25 men in the space of 24 hours (Juvenal, Dio and Pliny). He freedman Narcissus who was loyal to her and her children assisted her in her political endeavours.\n\nMessalina by Henrique Bernardelli\n\n​However in 47CE Messalina took her frivolity too far and after developing a passion for the single and politically ambitious consul-designate Gaius Silius. The two made no attempt to hide their relationship and moved some of the Claudian furniture into Silius’ house and even some of Claudius’ freedmen and slaves, all apparently without Claudius noticing. By 48CE adultery was not enough for the ambitious couple, and they took the opportunity while Claudius visited Ostia to get married. Far from keeping it quiet, they arranged a theatrical bacchic marriage in which many of Rome’s nobles attended. Narcissus, usually loyal to Messalina, acted instantly. He travelled to Ostia and employed two of Claudius own concubines to tell Claudius and to encourage him to seek Narcissus’ help and advice. According to the sources, Claudius was at first hesitant to realise the seriousness of the situation, but on his ride back to Rome, accompanied by Narcissus panic took over and he temporarily suspended the praetorian prefect Geta and replaced him with the freedman Narcissus.\n\nWhen Claudius is away Messalina will play by A. Pigma 1911\n\nNarcissus orchestrated much of what followed. During their journey messengers had arrived at the wedding celebrations and related that Claudius knew and was returning to deal out his revenge. Panic ensured and Silius went to the Forum in the hope of gaining political support. The wedding party broke up and Messalina caught a ride on a cart headed to Ostia in the hope of running into her husband and pleading his mercy and understanding. However she was too late and by the time she reached Ostia she had long missed him. She returned to Rome.\n\nClaudius had been taken to the estate of Silius where Narcissus pointed out all the Claudian heirlooms in the house to Claudius’ disgust. Narcissus empowered with the role of prefect then has the guard execute various nobles involved in the marriage including Silius himself. Messalina meanwhile back in Rome tries to present her children to Claudius but is barred from the palace by Narcissus. Finally she retires to the house of her mother Domitia LepidaMinor with her children Brittanicus and Octavia where the Guard at the instruction of Narcissus alone, assisted Messalina to suicide. ​Upon hearing the news, the Emperor did not react and simply asked for another chalice of wine. The Roman Senate then ordered a damnatio memoriae so that Messalina's name would be removed from all public and private places and all statues of her would be taken down.\n\nIn 49CE Claudius married the daughter of his brother- his niece- Agrippina Minor at the referral of Pallas, one of his foremost freedmen. In 50CE he adopted her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus and renamed him Nero. Thus placing his own son Brittanicus in a secondary position to that of his adopted son. Agrippina received all the honours given to Messalina including some that were altogether new such as the title ‘Augusta’. She played a major role in his administration of the empire, receiving envoys and influencing politics during his reign. The ancient historians all implicate Agrippina in his death. ​\n\nquestions\n\n1.How influential were freedmen in the private life of Claudius?\n\n2.List Claudius’ wives and their children.\n\n​3.Claudius is often criticised by ancient historians as being controlled by his freedmen and wives. Why? How accurate is the criticism?\n\nThe Gemma Claudia - Germanicus and Agrippina I emerge from a Cornocopia and face Claudius and Agrippina II\n\nANCIENT SOURCE:\n\nTacitus Annals ‘the Mother of Nero’\n\nThe destruction of Messalina shook the imperial house; for a strife arose among the freedmen, who should choose a wife for Claudius, impatient as he was of a single life and submissive to the rule of wives. The ladies were fired with no less jealousy. Each insisted on her rank, beauty, and fortune, and pointed to her claims to such a marriage. But the keenest competition was between Lollia Paulina, the daughter of Marcus Lollius, an ex-consul, and Julia Agrippina, the daughter of Germanicus. Callistus favoured the first, Pallas the second. Aelia Paetina however, of the family of the Tuberones, had the support of Narcissus. The emperor, who inclined now one way, now another, as he listened to this or that adviser, summoned the disputants to a conference and bade them express their opinions and give their reasons.\n\nNarcissus dwelt on the marriage of years gone by, on the ties of offspring, for Paetina was the mother of Antonia, and on the advantage of excluding a new element from his household, by the return of a wife to whom he was accustomed, and who would assuredly not look with a stepmother's animosity on Britannicus and Octavia, who were next in her affections to her own children. Callistus argued that she was compromised by her long separation, and that were she to be taken back, she would be supercilious on the strength of it. It would be far better to introduce Lollia, for, as she had no children of her own, she would be free from jealousy, and would take the place of a mother towards her stepchildren.\n\nPallas again selected Agrippina for special commendation because she would bring with her Germanicus's grandson, who was thoroughly worthy of imperial rank, the scion of a noble house and a link to unite the descendants of the Claudian family. He hoped that a woman, who was the mother of many children and still in the freshness of youth, would not carry off the grandeur of the Caesars to some other house…But no difficulty seemed to be presented by the temper of a sovereign who had neither partialities nor dislikes, but such as were suggested and dictated to him.\n\n‘To Claudius, not only did she represent the Julian wing of the dynasty, but he can hardly have been unaware of her political talents or for that matter, her ambitions...But Claudius’ choice of Agrippina was policy, not whimsy...It was good politics.\n\n​Bill Leadbetter, 1997, The Ambition of Agrippina the Younger\n\nClaudius & Agrippina Junior Denarius.

He had written 20 books on Etruscan history and 8 on the history of Carthage, no less than 41 books he wrote on Augustus himself and 8 books of autobiography. Claudius was by no means the fool that his family thought he was. He had escaped the suspicion and wrath of two tyrants who might have seen him as a threat to the office of princeps were it not for his look and manner. Claudius endeavoured to strengthen the empire by:\n\n​He chose capable and loyal freedmen as his closest advisors\n\nHe cancelled and forgave the persecutors of Gaius with the exception of those who held the daggers, whom he justly executed\n\nHe allowed exiles from Gaius principate to return to Rome\n\nHe ended the Maiestas (for a time)\n\n​He held the consulship only 4 times in his principate so as not to anger the republican institutions by continually filling powerful positions\n\n​Some of his less popular policies addressed the needs of the empire but offended the senate such as:\n\nHe opened the office of senator to the Equites a long disenfranchised middle class of Rome\n\n​He centralised administration of Rome by way of the imperial freedmen at the head of administrative bureaucracies\n\nHe became censor, a role that angered the senate and had not been undertaken since Augustus\n\n​Claudius conducted a census in 48CE that found 5,984,072 Roman citizens, an increase of around a million since the census conducted at Augustus' death. He had helped increase this number through the foundation of Roman colonies that were granted blanket citizenship.\n\n​The Senate: changing role and responsibilities\n\n​Because of the circumstances of his accession, Claudius took great pains to please the Senate. During regular sessions, the emperor sat amongst the Senate body, speaking in turn. When introducing a law, he sat on a bench between the consuls in his position as Tribune. He refused to accept all his predecessors' titles (including Imperator) at the beginning his reign, preferring to earn them in due course. He allowed the Senate to issue its own bronze coinage for the first time since Augustus. He also put the imperial provinces of Macedonia and Achaea back under Senate control. Claudius set about remodelling the Senate into a more efficient, representative body. He chided the senators about their reluctance to debate bills introduced by himself, as this fragment demonstrates:\n\nANCIENT INSCRIPTION\n\nThe Lyons Tablet preserves Claudius speech\n\n\"If you accept these proposals, Conscript Fathers, say so at once and simply, in accordance with your convictions. If you do not accept them, find alternatives, but do so here and now; or if you wish to take time for consideration, take it, provided you do not forget that you must be ready to pronounce your opinion whenever you may be summoned to meet. It ill befits the dignity of the Senate that the consul designate should repeat the phrases of the consuls word for word as his opinion, and that every one else should merely say 'I approve', and that then, after leaving, the assembly should announce 'We debated'.\n\nThe Lyons Tablet\n\nDespite this, many in the Senate remained hostile to Claudius, and many plots were made on his life. This hostility carried over into the historical accounts. As a result, Claudius was forced to reduce the Senate's power for efficiency. The administration of Ostia was turned over to an imperial Procurator after construction of the port. Administration of many of the empire's financial concerns was turned over to imperial appointees and freedman. This led to further resentment and suggestions that these same freedmen were ruling the emperor. Several coup attempts were made during Claudius' reign, resulting in the deaths of many senators. Suetonius states that a total of 35 senators and 300 knights were executed for offenses during Claudius' reign. Needless to say, the necessary responses to these conspiracies could not have helped Senate-emperor relations.\n\nquestions\n\nUsing sources, describe Claudius relationship with the senate\n\n​​He extended the summer court session, as well as the winter term, by shortening the traditional breaks. Claudius also made a law requiring plaintiffs to remain in the city while their cases were pending, as defendants had previously been required to do. These measures had the effect of clearing out the docket. The minimum age for jurors was also raised to 25 in order to ensure a more experienced jury pool.\n\nNumerous edicts were issued throughout Claudius' reign. These were on a number of topics, everything from medical advice to moral judgments. Two famous medical examples are one promoting Yew juice as a cure for snakebite, and promoting public flatulence for good health. One of the more famous edicts concerned the status of sick slaves. Masters had been abandoning ailing slaves at the temple of Aesculapius to die, and then reclaiming them if they lived. Claudius ruled that slaves who recovered after such treatment would be free. Furthermore, masters who chose to kill slaves rather than take the risk would be charged with murder.\n\n“The Temples and Cult of Asclepius”, color litograph from portfolio series “A History of Medicine” illustrated by Robert Thom\n\nClaudius also settled disputes in the provinces. He freed the island of Rhodes from Roman rule for their good faith and exempted Troy from taxes. Early in his reign, the Greeks and Jews of Alexandria sent him two embassies at once after riots broke out between the two communities. This resulted in the famous \"Letter to the Alexandrians,\" which reaffirmed Jewish rights in the city but also forbade them to move in more families en masse. According to Josephus, he then reaffirmed the rights and freedoms of all the Jews in the empire. During Claudius census he discovered that many old Roman citizens based in the modern city of Trento were not, in fact, legal Roman citizens. The emperor issued a declaration that they would be considered to hold citizenship from then on, since to strip them of their status would cause major problems. However, in individual cases, Claudius punished false assumption of citizenship harshly, making it a capital offense. Similarly, any freedmen found to be impersonating citizens were sold back into slavery.Claudius personally judged many of the legal cases tried during his reign. Ancient historians have many complaints about this, stating that his judgments were variable and sometimes did not follow the law. He was also easily swayed. Nevertheless, Claudius paid detailed attention to the operation of the judicial system. ​\n\n​administration of the empire: development of the imperial bureaucracy, role of freedmen, Pallas and Narcissus\n\nClaudius was hardly the first emperor to use freedmen to help with the day-to-day running of the empire. He was, however, forced to increase their role as the powers of the princeps became more centralised and the burden larger. This was partly due to the ongoing hostility of the senate, as mentioned above, but also due to his respect for the senators. Claudius did not want free-born magistrates to have to serve under him, as if they were not peers.\n\n​The secretariat was divided into bureaus, with each being placed under the leadership of one freedmen. Narcissus was the secretary of correspondence. Pallas became the secretary of the treasury. Callistus became the equivalent of the U.S. Attorney General. There was a fourth bureau for miscellaneous issues, which was put under Polybius until his execution for treason. The freedmen could also officially speak for emperor, as when Narcissus addressed the troops in Claudius' stead before the conquest of Britain. Since these were important positions, the senators were aghast at their being place"
