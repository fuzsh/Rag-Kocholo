        "text": "The Emperor Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\n\nBorn on 01 August 10 BC in Lugdunum as the son of Drusus and Antonia Minor. Claudius was a grandson of Marcus Antonius and Octavia, the sister of Emperor Augustus. One might think that being born into such an influential line of the ruling family would have brought him great advantages. However, Claudius' life was characterised by hardship from an early age. He was considered incompetent and harmless. On the one hand, this meant that he was not given any tasks or offices as a young man. On the other hand, it was probably the only reason he survived the purges under his two predecessors.\n\nWhen he was young, Claudius was plagued by several physical ailments that caused his family to become estranged from him and he was often treated harshly. Suetonius tells us: \"His mother Antonia often called him \"a monster of a man, not finished, but only begun by nature\" - and when she accused someone of stupidity, she used to say that he was \"a greater fool than her son Claudius. His grandmother Augusta always treated him with the utmost contempt and very rarely spoke to him - and when she did admonish him, she did so in short, harsh letters or through a messenger. When his sister Livilla heard that he would one day become emperor, she prayed openly and loudly that the Roman people would be spared such a cruel and undeserved fate.\"\n\nAs the last male adult of his family, Claudius unexpectedly became his successor after Caligula's assassination in 41 AD. He was the first Roman emperor in whose elevation the military played a significant role. Despite his lack of political experience, Claudius proved to be a capable administrator and developed a lively building programme. The conquest of Britain took place during his reign. Ancient historians and biographers describe Claudius before his time as emperor as a neglected, sickly and ridiculous man; as emperor he was characterised as ignorant, weak and malicious. After his death, he was mocked and denigrated by Seneca. Although many negative things were said about Emperor Claudius by his contemporaries, in the light of modern research he appears as a capable, far-sighted monarch and as a contrasting figure to his stepson and successor Emperor Nero.\n\nThe wives and children of Claudius\n\nEdward Gibbon writes that Claudius' love life was unusual for a higher-class Roman, as he was neither a pederast nor homosexual. Gibbon's view was based on Suetonius' statement that Claudius had a great passion for women but no interest in men. Suetonius and the other historians used his love life against him. They accused him that his wives exerted considerable influence over him. Claudius was engaged twice as a young man, but in both cases the marriage never materialised. The first engagement to his 12-year-old cousin Aemilia Lepida was cancelled when her mother fell out of favour with Augustus in 8 BC. The second engagement to Livia Medullina ended with the sudden death of the bride shortly before the wedding.\n\nClaudius was married four times. His first marriage was to Plautia Urgulanilla, a granddaughter of Livia's confidante Urgulania. Claudius Drusus was born during their union. Shortly after his betrothal to Seianus' daughter, Drusus died of asphyxiation in infancy. Claudius later separated from Urgulanilla due to adultery and suspicion of the murder of her sister-in-law Apronia. When Urgulanilla gave birth to a daughter named Claudia after the divorce, Claudius rejected the child, as the father was one of the freedmen.\n\nProbably in the year 28 AD, Claudius married Aelia Paetina, a relative of Seianus. He had a daughter with her, Claudia Antonia. He separated from her in 31 AD, presumably in connection with the fall of Seianus.\n\nEven before his accession to power (around 39/40 AD), he married the 14-year-old Valeria Messalina. She bore Claudius two children: daughter Claudia Octavia in 40 AD and, shortly after Claudius' accession to power in 41 AD, son Tiberius Claudius Germanicus, who became known as Britannicus. Ancient sources describe Messalina as a nymphomaniac who was constantly unfaithful to Claudius. In 48 AD she married her lover Gaius Silius in a public ceremony while Claudius was in Ostia. The sources are contradictory as to whether or not she had been divorced by the emperor and whether she intended to usurp the throne. The Claudius biographer Vincent Scramuzza believes that Silius had convinced Messalina that Claudius was doomed to failure and that the union was her only hope of maintaining her position and protecting her children, as Agrippina's efforts to have her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (later Nero), the only grandson of Germanicus, on the throne were already recognisable at this point. According to Tacitus, Claudius may have been prevented from publicly denouncing the affair by his ongoing activity as a censor (\"guardian of morals\"). Claudius had Silius and Messalina and most of their acquaintances executed in 48 AD. Claudius made the praetorians promise that they would be allowed to kill him if he ever married again.\n\nDespite this declaration, Claudius remarried. After briefly considering remarrying his second wife or marrying the childless Lollia Paulina, the widow of his predecessor, the choice fell on Agrippina the Younger, who won Claudius over with her feminine charms. However, it was probably also a marriage for political reasons. Claudius had no adult heir, as Britannicus was still a boy. Agrippina was the great-granddaughter of Augustus and brought another successor to the emperor into the marriage with her eleven-year-old son.\n\nClaudia Antonia, daughter of Claudius and Aelia Paetina\n\nClaudia Antonia's mother was the adopted sister of the praetorian prefect Lucius Aelius Seianus, who was the most powerful man in Rome under Emperor Tiberius. At the height of his power, he succeeded in having his sister married into the imperial family in the year 28 AD, even though Claudius was a rather insignificant prince at the time. Claudia Antonia was probably born the following year. After Seianus' fall in 31 AD, Claudius divorced their mother. Claudia Antonia therefore grew up first with her grandmother Antonia minor and then with her father.\n\nHer first husband Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, a descendant of the famous Pompeius, was almost killed as a child by Caligula because of his surname Magnus. Claudius rehabilitated him and gave him his daughter in marriage in 41 AD. According to Suetonius, he nevertheless had him killed later. According to Cassius Dio, he was denounced by Messalina in 47 AD on a pretext and executed by Claudius. Apparently Messalina wanted to strengthen the Julio-Claudian dynasty by marrying her half-brother Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix to her stepdaughter. However, this second marriage of Claudia Antonia produced only one son, who died as an infant. Cassius Dio emphasised that it would have been a good decision on Claudius' part not to celebrate the birth of this child in public.\n\nAfter the murder of her second husband by Nero in 62 AD, Claudia Antonia joined the so-called Pisonian conspiracy against Nero. The plan was for Nero to be murdered on 19 April 65 AD during a visit to the circus. After the successful tyrannicide, Claudia Antonia was to wait with Gaius Calpurnius Piso, the leader of the conspiracy, at the Temple of Ceres until the two were brought into the Praetorian camp to proclaim Piso the new ruler. Antonia was to accompany him \"to arouse the people's favour\". This could be interpreted to mean that Piso intended to marry Antonia, possibly in order to legitimise his claims by marrying a daughter of the emperor. However, Piso was married. But while Piso and numerous co-conspirators died after the betrayed assassination attempt, Antonia seems to have remained unharmed after the conspiracy was uncovered. It was only when she refused to become Nero's third wife after Poppaea's death in the summer of 65 AD that Nero accused her of participating in a conspiracy and had her killed.\n\nClaudia Octavia, daughter of Claudius and Messalina\n\nOctavia was betrothed to her relative Lucius Silanus at the age of one. However, when Claudius intended to marry his niece Agrippina in 48 AD, her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, who later became Nero, appeared to be a more suitable marriage candidate. Lucius Silanus was accused of having an illicit relationship with his sister Iunia Calvina and expelled from the Senate. On the day of Claudius' wedding to Agrippina, he committed suicide. This cleared the way for the new empress to betroth Octavia to her son. The problem that Nero, who had been adopted by Claudius, was now officially Octavia's brother, whom she was not allowed to marry under Roman law, was solved by the bride being pro forma adopted by an Octavian. As a result of this adoption, she was given the name Octavia. The wedding took place in 53 AD.\n\nWhen her father Claudius died in 54 AD, Octavia became empress at Nero's side. The death of her brother Britannicus in 55 AD, which, as in the case of her father, was suspected to be a case of poisoning, left her alone in a hostile environment, as Nero rejected his young wife from the outset and had numerous affairs, including with a freedwoman named Acte. Agrippina, on the other hand, who saw her own position threatened by Acte's influence over Nero, sought Octavia as an ally.\n\nAlthough Nero's lover Poppaea probably had an influence on the murder of his mother in 59 AD, Nero only divorced Octavia after the death of Burrus in 62 AD. The divorce was justified on the grounds of Octavia's infertility. She received the estates of Rubellius Plautus, a great-grandson of Tiberius, who had been murdered shortly before. In order to suppress the protests of the people, who greatly honoured her as a legitimate member of the Iulian-Claudian imperial dynasty, Nero accused her of adultery and - contrary to his reason for divorce, infertility - of having an abortion. As Suetonius reports, Anicetus, Agrippina's murderer, finally claimed to be her lover at Poppaea's instigation.\n\nThe head of Octavia\n\nThis gave Nero an excuse to banish her. Octavia, who resisted the unjustified treatment, was sent to Pandateria and her slaves were murdered to break her resistance. In exile, she was murdered at Poppaea's instigation. Her head is said to have been brought to Poppaea. In contrast to Octavia, who had never received the title Augusta, Poppaea was given this title immediately after the birth of her daughter Claudia on 21 January 63 AD. The fabula praetexta Octavia, attributed to Seneca, is the only surviving drama about a topic from Roman history.\n\nBritannicus, son of Claudius and Messalina\n\nHis original birth name was Tiberius Claudius Caesar Germanicus. He was given the nickname \"Britannicus\" on the occasion of the conquest of Britain in 43 AD, his father's most spectacular military success. Britannicus was the stepbrother of the future emperor Nero. Nero, who was four years older, was the son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Iulia Agrippina, a niece of Claudius. Nero's birth name was Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. After Claudius ordered the killing of Britannicus' mother Messalina (48 AD), Claudius married Iulia Agrippina in 49 AD (this was Claudius' fourth marriage in total and Agrippina's third) and adopted her son from his first marriage, who was henceforth called Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus.\n\nBritannicus was the pride of his father and grew up well protected by his own tutors for the first few years. The young man learnt the fine arts, the right view of politics, both internal and external, and the right way to behave at court. And he also fell in love - with the beautiful Junia. The romance was not to last. It was his stepbrother - Nero, of all people - who stole her from him.\n\nIn 54 AD, Emperor Claudius died, allegedly poisoned by Iulia Agrippina with the help of a mushroom dish. Instead of Britannicus, who was only 13 years old at the time, she installed her biological son Nero as the new emperor. However, when disputes soon arose between her and Nero, the latter allegedly feared that she might support Britannicus' claims to the imperial title in the future. Nero got rid of his supposed or perhaps actual rival by having him poisoned in February 55 AD. He had previously had his taster bribed. One source seems to know that Nero had him killed by the notorious poisoner Locusta with poisonous panther mushrooms. According to Suetonius, Nero lied to the horrified guests that Britannicus had fallen victim to an \"ordinary attack of epilepsy\". It is possible that Britannicus, like Gaius Iulius Caesar, actually suffered from this illness and may have died from it. Tacitus also refers to (unnamed) historians of the time, according to whom Britannicus was abused by Nero in the days before his death.\n\nProvincial Coin from Cyzicus with Britannicus (Caesar), Claudia Antonia and Claudia Octavia\n\nBritannicus (Caesar), Claudia Antonia and Claudia Octavia; Reign: Claudius; Mint: Cyzicus, Mysia; Date: ca. 41/54 AD; Nominal: Bronze; Material: AE; Diameter: 13mm; Weight: 1.46g; Reference: RPC I 2248; Obverse: Bare head of Britannicus, right; Reverse: Draped busts of Antonia and Claudia Octavia, facing each other."
