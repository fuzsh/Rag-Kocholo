        "text": "Hello everyone welcome to Rome the Glorius Empire an alternate history in which Gaius and Lucius Julius Ceasar provide a stable succession for Augustus.\n\nPrologue\n\nAugust 25 14AD\n\nCuria Julia, Rome\n\nThe family and descendent of Augustus were waiting inside the Senate building, the Curia Julia construction of which started under the great Gaius Julius Caesar. These people included all of Marcus Vispanius Agrippa's children excluding two who had yet to arrive. As well as the children of the desceased livia and her son the beloved Drusus.\n\nFinally the two remaining members of the dynasty arrived. With flair Lucius Julius Caesar arrived flanked by soldiers and wearing his generals armour much like his cousins the elder general Tiberius Claudius Nero and Germanicus.\n\nBehind Lucius was his elder brother Gaius Julius Caesar named after the great man during his adoption. Were as Lucius arrived was a proud man his brother almost looked depressed. Black lines around his eyes from lack of sleep. Worry written over his face. Gaius had been reluctant to take Augustus place but had conceded to his adopted father, since his campaign in Armenia he had been experiencing pain everyday and had became reclusive, he did not want to admit it but after his close call with death he became a coward and was seemingly becoming mentally unstable as time went by.\n\nGaius looked upon everyone in the room. \"Upon Augustus's decision i have become the head of Rome and this combined family. Tiberius you have served well and will retire from the army and join me here to administer the empire. Your son Drusus and your nephew germanicus will continue on the frontier with my brother Lucius. We must provide a strong front to the senate.\" This was the strongest Gaius sounded since Armenia, if only it were to last.\n\nNext time in Rome Glorius Empire the tale of how we got to this point will begin to be told.\n\nChapter 1\n\nIn 2AD lucius Julius Caesar travelled to Hispania. In Hispania he was to learn the art of Roman War. At this same time Livia wife of Augustus was planning the seccession of her son Tiberius. First would be Lucius, the son of Agrippa that was the biggest nail in her plan. Lucius had performed well in his Tutoring under Augustus and had learned all the great wars Romans had written about. He had studied Caesars and his fathers campaigns visciously taking in all the knowledge possible. He also seemed to be skilled in politics and was liked by all who knew him and many people he was hugely charismatic. Gaius on the other hand though just as skilled as his younger brother had always seemed depressing. Sometimes Gaius would seem better at anything then everyone then his impeding life as Princeps would weight down on him and he would become meek.\n\nSo Lucius first his brother would be easy.\n\nLucius was eating when it happened. He was being served food at the magistrates of massilia's own house which he was staying in on his way to Hispania for the night. He noticed one of the slaves acting wierd as he brought food over. The man seemed to be hiding something. But the rumbling in Lucius's stomach stopped his suspicions. As he brought the food to his mouth and was about to take a bite he smelled what he thought was a delicious aroma.\n\nBut he nearly puked just from the smell. \"Slave take a bite of this food for me.\" The slave looked at Lucius with wide eyed fear. The slave turned to run but was tackled by Lucius's guard. Lucius felt anger shoot throught his veins the usual cheery man was suddenly filled with extreme anger his veins popping out of his forhead.\n\n\"Slave you will eat this food.\" Lucius and the magistrate watched as the slave was held down and fed the food. \"How long has that slave been part of your household?\"\n\n\"Thing is i dont remember ever buying him.\"\n\nAs the food was shoveled into the slaves mouth and he had no choice but to swallow the slave immediately began to get sick and through up. They watched theoughout the night as the slave stayed sick vomiting, and eventually retching as blood poured out of his mouth his death was not long later.\n\nLucius guard came to him. \"Before he died he told us who his master was. Livia.\"\n\nLucius knew immediately the truth was in his mans words. He would need to be careful from now on.\n\nNext time on Rome Glorius Empire we will see how the young brothers groomed for to be Augustus's hiers deal with thier stepmother\n\nChapter II\n\nIn 2 AD Lucius Caesar would begin his military training in Hispania while also working with the provincial governors learning the administration of the provinces which would be applicable to the entire empire. All the time watching for another attempt from Livia.\n\nWhile Lucius was in Hispania his brother Gaius was in the east. Augustus had given him a directive to bring parthia in as a client state.\n\nGaius Caesar in 2AD lead negotiations with the parthian king Phraates which came out in roman favour. A roman client from Media was placed on the Armenian throne. Gaius then had to lead an invasion of Armenia defeating several rebel forces. Before becoming injured during the siege. Leaving the war under his legates he took leave to Antioch were he recieved a letter from Lucius detailing his discover of Livias attempt on his life. Only weeks later to survive an attempt on himself.\n\nBy 3 AD Gaius's wound had healed mostly though it still caused him pain, the war in Armenia was done. He would stay in the east for another 3 years\n\nNext time in Rome Glorius Empire Lucius Julius Caesar leads the Roman legions in Germania\n\nChapter III\n\nLucius Caesar finished his time in Hispania in 4AD, the same place were his brother had joined Tiberius Claudius Nero in Campaing in 7AD. Here he would take command of 3 legions the XVII XVIII AND XIX. He would lead these legions victoriously and in 6AD he defeated a large rebellion lead by the Cherusci chief Arminius. This victory would effectively end all germanic resistance as many of thier men were wiped out. After his victory Lucius was replaced by Quintillius Varus. Lucius and Gaius would be recalled to Rome were the brothers would stage the poisoning of Livia that looked like a natural death.\n\nIn 7AD Gaius Julius Caesar and Livilla daughter of Drusus had a son born Gaius Julius Caesar the same as his father. This same year Lucius would marry Domitia lepida the elder who at this time was 15 and he 23. A year later Lucius had a son named Lucius Julius Vispasianus Caesar honoring his fathers gens.\n\nDuring this time the grear Illyrian revolt was under way. Tiberius was in overall command. In early 7AD before his son was born Lucius was sent with an army consisting of 3 legions to Macedon to fight the Illyrians from the south while Tiberius and Germanicus fought in the North. By late 8AD the revolt was over and all 3 men entered Rome in triumph.\n\nBoth Gaius and Lucius for the next 2 years stay in Rome supporting Augustus and advancing thier political careers. During this time while his brother has no more children Lucius has another son and daughter born to him. A son named Marcus Julius Agrippa Caesar and a daughter Julia Domitia.\n\nIn 10AD Lucius is once again sent to the frontier once again to Germania were he campaigns across the Elbe river and begins the creation of Roman Colonies in the Province.\n\nIn 14AD after 4 years of governship he is recalled and arrives in Rome days before the death of his adopted father.\n\nNext time in Rome the Glorius Empire the future of Rome is unvieled as the weak Gaius Julius Caesar Becomes Princeps\n\nChapter IV\n\nAD 14\n\nGaius Julius Caesar son of Marcus Vispasianus Agrippa and adopted son of Gaius Julius Octavianus Caesar was now Princeps. Gaius since his only campaign in Armenia had not been happy with his lot in life. Reluctant to take the place of Augustus in constant pain from an old injury which never seemee to fully heal and his health seemed to be worsening he relied on his brother and his cousins Drusus the younger and Germanicus to hold the frontiers which seemed to be at peace for once. His cousin Tiberius was in Rome guiding his hand and policies.\n\n15AD\n\nWhile Gaius was in Rome weak as his health became worse. Lucius was in Syria holding down the east. Since his arrival the Parthians had seemingly halted any plans of war. Lucius entered Armenia and the roman client king toured him around the kingdom.\n\nIn Germania Drusus the younger governed with a steady hand proving his worth as the provinces trade boomed as well as its population. Germanicus meanwhile pushed roman territory to the Danube which he would do in a 6 year campaign.\n\nBy 18AD Gaius Caesars condition has worsened significantly Lucius Caesar is recalled in emergency as his brother becomes violently ill, Lucius and Tiberius form a regency as Gaius enters into a coma. After a 2 month coma Gaius Caesar waked up a changed man. His wound has festered and constantly causes him pain and rashes, prone to violent outbursts his mind finally broken he orders the death of the loyal Tiberius, even the intervention of Lucius cannot stop the execution.\n\nEven though Gaius and Tiberius used a fiscal policy which saved the empire millions and filled the treasury these funds are wasted on orgys and Gaius murders several senators for fun including their families.\n\nAfter a year of chaos and murder in 19AD after reigning for 5 years Gaius Julius Caesar succumbs death, it is not known if he murdered by poison died of infection or had a heart attack but all are thought to have been part of the death. Gaius Caesar is followed on the throne by his 12 year old son Gaius Julius Caesar. The young Caesar is tutored by his uncle Lucius who again is regent as well as his cousins Drusus and Germanicus. Drusus is remarried to Gaius widow Livilla and in 20AD Have a son born Tiberius Claudius Drusus.\n\nIn 21 AD Gaius Julius Caesar the younger dies a sudden and shocking death when he falls from his horse onto the cobblestone road at the age of 14. The boy is known for being like his father though he had trouble learning anything about the administration of an empire or the workings of war. He is Succeeded by his Uncle Lucius Julius Caesar.\n\nNext time in Rome the Glorius Empire We see the reign of Emperor Lucius Julius Caesar and the future of the empire."
