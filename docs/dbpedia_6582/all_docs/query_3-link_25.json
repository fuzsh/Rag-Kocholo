Good compiled a list in 1925 of the best all-time positional players. Good was the respected Sporting Editor for the Toronto Daily News until that paper folded in 1919. Maclean's Magazine asked Good to put a best-of list together for the March 15th edition. Good, in turn, called upon his peers in the sports writing fraternity to submit their picks. From those lists three all-star teams were compile.\"\n\n\"The participants : Charles H. Good, W. A. Hewitt, Lester Patrick, J .F. Ahern, Tommy Gorman, W. J. Morrison, Lou Marsh, Bruce Boreham, K. G. H. McConnell, Roy Halpin, Ross Mackay, Harry Scott, O. F. Young, Art Ross, Frank Shaughnessey, James T. Sutherland, Bill Tackabery, Basil O'Meara, Ed. Baker, \"Dusty\" Rhodes, Walter McMullin, E. W. Ferguson, Joe Kincaid, and W. A. Boys, M.P.\"\n\nhttp://sports.groups.yahoo.com/group/hockhist/message/20402\n\n1st Team: Georges Vezina\n\n2nd Team: Percy LeSueur\n\n3rd Team: Clint Benedict/Hugh Lehman\n\nNote the following:\n\nThe survey took place at the low-point of Benedict's career, after his poor showing in the 1924 playoffs got him run out of Ottawa, and before his revival with the maroons.\n\nThe survey was criticized in western papers as being biased against western players (like Lehman and Holmes?)\n\nLeSueur had been retired for 8 years, while Vezina, Benedict, Lehman, and Holmes were still active, so there might have been a nostalgia component.\n\nDespite all that, this is pretty good evidence in favor of LeSueur compared to Hutton, Hern and Moran\n\nI have been sick for a week and had time to educate myself about hockey history.\n\nSomething from Percy LeSueur.\n\nIn 1908 was selected (from wikipedia) to the first All star game (Hod stuart memorial game). Moran and Billy Nicholson seemed to be very intrested in playing that game also.\n\nhttp://news.google.com/newspapers?id=inYuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=44QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4708,25821&dq=lesueur+ottawa+star&hl=en\n\nHis work at 1908-1909 season \"Stamped\" him as the best goalie in game and made him the best paid goalie.

Of course itÂ´s possible that it was opinon of few people copied by many?\n\nHere are few.\n\nFrom 1910 peerless net custodian\n\nhttp://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tcNSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YDcNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3346,4565329&dq=best+lesueur+custodian&hl=en\n\nBert Lindsay (best of the coast league?

Goalies Moran and LeSueur. (mentioned in Morans profile). I guess this just missed Holmes and Lehman who were still playing.\n\nhttp://news.google.com/newspapers?i...=6508,5254899&dq=lester+patrick+lesueur&hl=en\n\nEverything I've read suggests that LeSueur is head and shoulders above the other earliest goalies (no disrespect to Moran). Every stats nerd around here also owes him a debt of gratitude for being the first one to start reporting shot counts when he came back to the league after the war as a reporter. Heck, he even invented the first link to the modern trapper, and his design for the net was used for almost 60 years.\n\nIf his playing career isn't enough to push him clearly to the top of that list of four (arguably it does), perhaps his innovations push him over the edge?\n\nYeah, I know that secondary sources like books after the fact all praise LeSueuer, but I had to wonder if they were overrating him relative to his HHOF peers because\n\n1) He played for Ottawa, which was hockey's glamour team pretty much up until the Great Depression.\n\n2) He did so much for the position of goalie after he retired as a player.\n\nBut reading the primary sources from the time, they seem to mostly support Leseuer as the best of the era. Though Moran does get some outside support.\n\nBased on what I know (which has all been presented in this thread, including linked profiles), I'd rank them:\n\n1) LeSueur\n\n2) Moran\n\n3) Hern\n\n4) Hutton\n\nBut I'm going to wait and see what other information can be presented in this thread before I say for sure.\n\nI have been sick for a week and had time to educate myself about hockey history.\n\nSomething from Percy LeSueur.\n\nIn 1909 was selected (from wikipedia) to the first All star game (Hod stuart memorial game).

Ottawa resigned during the 1904 season after refusing to replay a disputed game. They retained the Stanley Cup after CAHL champion Quebec refused to challenge Ottawa.\n\nThe GAA rank considers goalies who played at least a third of their team's games so that's why you have a higher number in that column than GA rank in certain years.\n\nPlayoffs\n\nYear|Series W-L|W-L|GF-GA\n\n1903|1-0|1-0-1|9-1\n\nTwo game total goals series played between Ottawa and the Montreal Vics after tying for first in the CAHL\n\n(Asterisk denotes a Hall of Famer, numbers in parenthesis represent goals scored during series)\n\nPosition|Ottawa|Vics\n\nGoalie|Bouse Hutton*|Archie Lockerby\n\nPoint|Harvey Pulford*|W.

Game 1 was played in Montreal and ended a 5-5 tie after the Wanderers refused to play overtime with the current referee. After refusing to replay Game 1 in Ottawa the Wanderers were disqualified and Ottawa retained the Stanley Cup.\n\nPaddy Moran\n\nCAHL\n\nYear|W-L|GAA Rank|GA Rank|Margins|GF Rank|Margins\n\n1902|4-4|4/5|4/5|-19 behind Nicholson (MAAA) and Hutton (OTT)|4/5|-13 behind MAAA\n\n1903|3-4|5/6|4/5|-27 behind Nicholson (MAAA)|4/5|-18 behind Vics\n\n1904|5-1|2/5|2/4|+11 ahead of Nichol (Vics)|2/4|-25 behind Vics\n\n1905|7-2|3/6|3/6|-12 behind Frye (Vics)|1/6|+14 ahead of Vics\n\nIn 1903 and 1904 for the GA and GF Rank columns I used per game ranks. Some teams played two less games than others so per game ranks only seem fair. Quebec accepted two forfeits in 1904 for example and their Goals Against per game was just above Montreal Victorias despite allowing 11 fewer goals.\n\nECAHA\n\nYear|W-L|GAA Rank|GA Rank|Margins|GF Rank|Margins\n\n1906|3-7|5/6|4/6|-32 behind Menard (Wanderers)|4/6|-33 behind Ottawa\n\n1907|0-6|6/7|5/6|-49 behind Hern (Wanderers)|4/6|-43 behind Wanderers\n\n1908|5-5|4/7|4/6|-25 behind Nicholson (Shamrocks)|2/6|-5 behind Ottawa\n\n1909|3-9|4/4|4/4|-45 behind Hern (Wanderers)|3/4|-39 behind Ottawa\n\nNHA\n\nYear|W-L|GAA Rank|GA Rank|Margins|GF Rank|Margins\n\n1910|3-8|5/8|4/7|-41 behind Hern (Wanderers)|5/7|-19 behind Renfrew\n\n1911|4-12|4/5|4/5|-35 behind Vezina (Canadiens)|5/5|-57 behind Ottawa\n\n1912|10-8|2/5|2/4|-13 behind Vezina (Canadiens)|3/4|-18 behind Ottawa\n\n1913|16-4|1/7|1/6|+6 ahead of Vezina (Canadiens) and LeSueur (OTT)|1/6|+19 ahead of Wanderers\n\n1914|12-8|T4/7|4/6|-8 behind Holmes (Blueshirts) and Vezina (Canadiens)|1/6|+9 ahead of Wanderers\n\n1915|11-9|4/6|4/6|-20 behind Benedict (OTT)|2/6|-42 behind Wanderers\n\n1916|10-10|3/5|T3/5|-26 behind Benedict (OTT)|3/5|-13 behind Canadiens\n\n1917|1-5|7/7|3/4|-63 behind Benedict (OTT)|2/4|-22 behind Ottawa\n\nPlayed for Haileybury in 1910, Quebec 1911-1917\n\n1917 gets messy as the Blueshirts and 228th Battalion didn't participate in the second half of the season. I included their goalies numbers in the GAA rank column but only used the 4 final teams in the GF and GA ranks. It was Moran's final season anyways and he only played 6 of the possible 20 games, which keeps him below the 33% threshold but I put the GAA rank up anyways.\n\nStanley Cup\n\nYear|Series W-L|W-L|GF-GA\n\nTotal|2-0|4-0|37-8\n\n1912|1-0|2-0|17-3\n\n1913|1-0|2-0|20-5\n\nBeat Moncton Victorias (Maritime Professional HL) in best of three series 2-0 (17-3) in March 1912\n\nPosition|Quebec|Moncton\n\nG|Paddy Moran*|Billy Hague\n\nP|Goldie Prodgers|Ras Murphy\n\nCP|Joe Hall* (2)|Fred Povey\n\nC|Joe Malone* (5)|Tommy Smith* (2)\n\nLW|Eddie Oatman / Jack Marks|Rollie Norman (1)\n\nRW|Jack McDonald (9)|Louis Berlinguette\n\nSub|Walter Rooney (1)|Fred Doherty\n\nBeat Sydney Millionaires (Maritime Professional HL) 20-5 in two game series in March 1913\n\nPosition|Quebec|Sydney\n\nG|Moran*|T.

All three games were played in Victoria and Quebec went 1-2 (12-16). Quebec won Game 2 under Eastern Rules and dropped Games 1 and 3 under Western Rules. The next year, the NHA champion Blueshirts accepted a Stanley Cup challenge from Victoria and this was the first many NHA/L - PCHA clashes to come.\n\nRiley Hern\n\nWPHL\n\nYear|W-L|GA Rank|Margins|GF Rank|Margins|All-Star Teams\n\n1902|9-5|2/3|-4 behind PAC|2/3|-3 behind PAC|1st Team\n\n1903|1-10|4/4|-53 behind Bankers|4/4|-39 behind Bankers|\n\nGoes from being named the best goalie in the league during his first season to awful numbers in his second season as the Keystones sag to last place in the league and eventually fold in 1904 after Hern moves on.\n\nHern also played in a 5 game exhibition at the end of the 1902 season. I believe it was against other American teams, which probably wasn't the strongest level of competition at this time.\n\nIHL\n\nYear|W-L|GA Rank|Margins|GF Rank|Margins|All-Star Teams\n\n1905|15-7-2|3/5|-6 behind Calumet|2/5|-33 behind Calumet|1st Team\n\n1906|15-5|2/5|-13 behind Michigan Soo|3/5|-21 behind Michigan Soo|2nd Team\n\nHoughton-Portage played 4 more games in 1906 which LoH doesn't give Hern credit for. I would assume this means a backup played and they went 4-0.\n\nHern also had a great year statistically in 1904, but it was during a series of exhibitions as Houghton-Portage had a great team with paid pros, but no league to accept them.\n\nWikipedia said:\n\nIn 1903–04, the professional Houghton team, without a league of its own, played exhibition games against teams from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and Michigan prompting the OHA to ban both the American Soo Indians and Canadian Sault Hockey Club from competing against Canadian amateur teams. As a result, the two teams had nowhere to go but to the proposed professional league.\n\nECAHA\n\nYear|W-L|GAA Rank|GA Rank|Margins|GF Rank|Margins\n\n1907|10-0|1/7|1/6|+15 ahead of LeSueur (OTT)|1/6|+4 over Vics\n\n1908|8-2|2/7|3/6|-3 behind Nicholson (Shamrocks)|4/6|-23 behind Ottawa\n\n1909|9-3|1/4|1/4|+2 ahead of LeSueur (OTT)|2/4|-35 behind Ottawa\n\nNHA\n\nYear|W-L|GAA Rank|GA Rank|Margins|GF Rank|Margins\n\n1910|11-1|1/8|1/7|+13 ahead of Lindsay (Renfrew)|2/7|-5 behind Ottawa\n\n1911|7-9|3/5|3/5|-26 behind Vezina (Canadiens)|3/5|-49 behind Ottawa\n\nStanley Cup\n\nYear|Series W-L|W-L|GF-GA\n\nTotal|7-1|10-4|105-54\n\n1907|2-1|3-3|37-25\n\n1908|3-0|5-0|48-16\n\n1909|1-0|1-1|13-10\n\n1910|1-0|1-0|7-3\n\nBeat New Glasgow Cubs (Maritime Professional HL) 17-5 in two game series in December 1906\n\nPosition|Wanderers|Cubs\n\nG|Riley Hern*|Dutchy Morrison\n\nP|William Strachan|James Musick / J.
