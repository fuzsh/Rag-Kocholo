        "meta_description": "On Saturday, October 1, 2016, our world lost one of the kindest, most generous souls to grace our lives.  John (Jock) Ordway Irvine’s life was marked throughout by service and philanthropy, including a seat on the boards of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, the United Hospital Foundation, Hazelden, and Camp Widjiwagan. He was co-founder of the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts. He also was an an avid sports fan, especially in his support of University of Minnesota Gopher athletics and as part owner of the Minnesota Fighting Saints. He was an avid hunter and fisherman as well, having been named angler of the year at Sailfish Point.  Jock’s greatest passion, however, was sailing, where his talent and dedication to yacht race management earned him national recognition. He was the recipient of the Inland Lake Yachting Association’s Ed Malone Trophy, the Bilge Pullers Cannon Trophy, US Sailing’s Hanson Award, and the White Bear Yacht Club’s Goyer Memorial Trophy, each organization’s highest honor for service in race management.  Jock Irvine was born February 16, 1941, in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was the son of Thomas E. Irvine and Sally Ordway Irvine. He was educated at St. Paul Academy and Hobart College, and was a longtime resident of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, and Stuart, Florida.  Jock is survived by his loving wife of 50 years, Harriette “Twinks” Irvine; their daughter, Heather Irvine Capuano, and son, Roger (Teri) Irvine; their grandchildren Will and Angie Capuano and Chloe, Carter, and Charlotte Irvine; and sister Jill Crow and brothers William Irvine and Horace “Hod” Irvine. He is preceded in death by his brother Thomas E. Irvine.  There will be a celebration of Jock’s life on Friday, October 7, at 4:00 p.m. at the White Bear Yacht Club. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be directed to the Inland Lake Yachting Association, PO Box 662, East Troy, WI 53120, and the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts, 345 Washington St., St. Paul, MN 55102.  Jock was an honorable gentleman, known for his kindness and love of a practical joke. Jock and Twinks’s remarkable philanthropy touched many lives. He will be remembered always as one of those rare persons who give with no thought of reward or recognition.   May your sails always fill with a gentle breeze, Jocko.",
