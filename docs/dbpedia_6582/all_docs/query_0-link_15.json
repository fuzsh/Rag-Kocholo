        "text": "Wendel Clark was a wrecking ball.\n\nWatching the Canucks since the mid to late 70's, Stan Smyl and Cam Neely were huge hitters.\n\nMike Peca for such a little guy had an incredible ability to send guys flying.\n\nSurprisingly, Teemu Selanne, could really do some damage when he threw his body around. He did it as a rookie, but I don't remember him ever throwing hits after very early in his career (did he stop after his rookie season, or after Mike Peca wrecked him???).\n\nMy favorite hitters are guys who have an incredibly low center of gravity; when they hit someone without even much speed, their opponent flies off of them.\n\nAll of the guys listed above had that except for Smyl. Smyl was a short little guy but was a rare guy (for the time) who was into working out, and already had a bodybuilder type of frame by the time he came into the league.\n\nLindros had that same ability to send people flying without needing much speed or momentum. It seems like that is kind of rare for taller guys.\n\nStevens might be the best hitter of all time, but what made him (and Kronwall) so good is their ability to read the play and see when a guys going to leave himself exposed.\n\nI used to love the guys who threw devasting hipchecks, but, as I've gotten older I see too many of those hits are just plain and simple cheap.\n\nHilliard Graves threw devastating hipchecks; but, now looking back at it, I think he was often targeting guys knees.\n\nThere were some players in the 90s who strictly specialized in that (and not much else) who probably deserve a mention (obviously, none of these guys were quite on Stevens level)--guys like Steve Webb, Tyson Nash, Brenden Witt, Kasparaitis even Bob Boughner to a lesser extent (lot of Islanders, now that I think about it). I'm sure I'm forgetting some. Some in the 80s, too, but to my recollection, man for man, shift for shift, those 80s fringe guys didn't hit quite as hard as a Webb or whoever (the more conventional hockey players or stars might be a different story).\n\nAnd while I've always been overly impressed with Pronger's game, he wasn't much for bodychecks. I'm sure someone will find the one or two times he really crushed somebody, but, for the most part, that wasn't frequent with him and certainly he wasn't as strong or technical with his hits as the other stars that have been mentioned (Lindros, Stevens, Robinson, etc) when he did. Mostly Pronger just played people (violently and nonviolently) with his stick, throwing in the occasional elbow to the teeth (which isn't exactly a check in my book).\n\nThis isn't really about tough, though. Alexei Emelin and Niklas Kronwall can wreck people in open ice, but they're the antithesis of tough.\n\nYeah, this isn't about how tough a player is, if it was then Matt Martin is an extremely punishing player who is always leading the league in hits but he doesn't deliver earth shattering hits that would make me consider him an all time hard hitter. Also at the rate which people are just reeling off hockey stars I fully expect someone to say Sidney Crosby or Wayne Gretzky next. A tough player who sometimes lays some good wood and gets into fights here and there isn't a candidate for hardest hitter of all time, just my personal opinion.\n\nHowe\n\nTrottier\n\nMessier\n\na very respected hockey mind thought them the toughest players ever.\n\nI was going to add Trots. So solid with a low center of gravity, he could really dish it out.\n\nI think someone already mentioned Big bird. He didn't throw it around too often but when he did, he absolutely crushed people.\n\nStevens and Potvin are top-2 on my list.\n\nRob Blake and his hip checks come to mind.\n\nNeely before his knee/hips issues was a beast.\n\nLindros of course.\n\nClark, as someone put it, was a freaking wrecking ball.\n\nMessier prolly used the reverse hit more than anyone (yes, even more than Forsberg) usually with an elbow added in (see Natress)"
