THIS FORM MAY BE REPRODUCED UbCOMM-DC 8265-P74 PORTIONS OF THIS REPORT ARE NOT LEGIBLC HOWEVER, IT-IS THE BEST REPRODUCTION AVAILABLEFROM THE COPY SENT TO NTIS PREFACE The events of the past two years have sharply focused the attention of the United States on a whole,array of difficult questions about our future quality of life and a prime ingredient -- energy: how much energy is essential to the economic viability of our Nation? How should we choose to,supply this energy? What costs, particularly those involving environmental quality, are we prepared to bear? In the context of rising prices and con- strained availability of energy and as self-sufficiency becomes a.firmer policy target, the choice of feasible and attractive energy-producing technologies has expanded rapidly. This rapid expansion accentuates a further question: what should be the Federal role during this period of technology development? A number of options are available, many very controversial, but certainly one is indisputable. The Federal Government has a mandate to collect, analyze, and disseminate information. Here, as in all areas of public policy, an informed citizenry is essential. Over the last several years, the Council on Environmental Quality in conjunction with several other Federal agencies has been engaged in several study efforts in response to these issues. This report is the culmination of one such study. The siting of nuclear powerplants offshore has emerged as one of the promising yet disturbing technologies prime for implementation.in the not-too-distant future. offshore siting conceivably.could overcome many of the economic and environmental difficulties of onshore siting, but for many it simultaneously raises the specter of safety hazards and severe environmental.degradation. in accordance with the concept that the involvement of Federal agencies with the development of new technologies should be \"proactive\" rather than reactive, this study was initiated in May 1973 as it became apparent that offshore nuclear powerplants were emerging as a ierious candidate technology. All concerned Federal agencies gathered and formed working groups coordinated by CEO to identify issues and associated information needs and availability. These working group's evolved a study outline for which Federal agencies .were then assigned lead and/or support roles to best employ their expertise and concern for the issues identified. From this structure a draft report emerged which has been reviewed iteratively by these Federal agencies -- resultin% in this final report. That this report doesnot present a forum for totally informed decisions for the deployment of specific offshore nuclear powerplants at specific sites is not surprising and Preceding pargaeup blank in fact is appropriate. The intent was to identify the major issues and considerations as the technology emerged -- thus the report herein. Thisi repor t is not, nor was it ever intended to be, a statement of environmental impacts of offshore nuclear powerplants -- I .that, quite correctly, will result.from.the regulatory process for specific deployment applications. Rather, this report serves to typify the pervasive issues related to the decision to deploy nuclear powerplants offshore not only in the case of a single facility but also in the context of multiple deployment. It is not\"the intent of this study to condemn or applaud this new energy concept. This will be done in other forums. This study will have fulfilled its purpose if it simply points out to the public the major issues and considerations of offshore nuclear powerplants,,including those that are as yet unresolved. it hardly need be mentioned here that conditions in the energy sector have changed rapidly and dramatically since this study was undertaken two years ago. Considerable effort was made to keep the results up-to-date, but that may be impossible in the current environment. one important change has been the increasing uncertainty of future plans for offshore nuclear facilities. The schedule for the Public Service Electric and Gas Atlantic Generating Station has slipped several years furtherinto the future while other customers for floating plants have failed, to materialize. Another important change at the rederai level has been the dissolution of the Atomic Energy Commission and the rebirth of its major components a's the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). This report maintains the old Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) designation. Readers, however, can generally substitute NRC for AEC within the report with no loss in accuracy. The scope of the study is broad and the coverage is deep. For those persons interested only in acquainting themselves with the rudiments of offshore nuclear powerplants, Chapter I may be sufficient. For those interested in pursuing particular points more thoroughly, the body of the report and its appendices will be useful. Chapters 11 and III, based upon significant inputs from the Federal Power Commission, the Department of the Interior (Bureau of Mines), and the AEC, present the role of offshore nuclear powerplants in the perspective of national energy supply and demand iv projections and economic feasibility. in Chapter IV and Appendices A and 13 the AEC describes one candidate offshore nuclear powerplant concept in considerable detail, including not only the construction and operation of these illustrative facilities but also the issues of.safety and dec-, issioning. in Appendix C the.National Oceanic and Atmospheric-Administration (Environmental Data Service) presents a comparative discussion of the environment of the four coastal areas of the United States and a more thoroulh discussion of the environment in four East Coast regions that have been identified as a candidate for early deployment of offshore nuclear powerplants. Chapter V and Appendix E, based on significant contributions from the national Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (National Marine Fisheries Service), the Environmental Protection Agencyand a contractor, @Mathematica, Inc., present a detailed description of the direct environmental effects of this concept throughout its life cycle., Appendix C discusses the direct environmental effects of alternative technological concepts. Chapter VI and Appendix P, based upon work by Mathematica and the Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis), present : discussion of the indirect environmental and economic effects of the floating nuclear lant concept throughout its life cycle. Chapter VIXI discusses the interaction between offshore siting and other potential uses of the outer continental shelf and coastal regions. In Chapter VIII, based upon contributions of several Federal agencies (most notably the ABC and the Department of State) and-Mathematica, the legal and institutional issues associated with the deployment of offshore nuclear powerplants are discussed in the context of various levels of governmental and public concerns. And last, but by all means of major importance, Chapter IX summarizes the current uncertainties relevant to the deployment of offshore nuclear powerplants and makes recommendations for future research. in addition to the agencies mentioned above,several othi;rs have played an important role in this study: Department of Defense (Corps of Engineers), U.S.. Coast Guard, Departmeni of the Interior, Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis), Department'of Justice, and Federal Aviation Admin istration. Moreover, the participation of all of theseagencies has been pervasive throughout the study and not limited to the above summary. Russell W.

The scope of the report is limited in several ways. First of all the focus is primarily upon the interaction between the siting of nuclear plants offshore and the environment vis-a-vis onshore siting. investigations of future nuclear power demands, the economics of offshore siting and safety have also been undertaken, but largely as a means for providing a framework from which environmental effects can be viewed. Secondly, the report emphasizes a single offshore technology the floating ,nuclear plant (FNP)/fixed breakwater !Ccnfiguration -- and concentrates on a single geographical region, the Atlantic coast. Although there appear to be other feasible offshore technologies, the information presently available is insufficient to permit meaningful compa rison. And while FNPs might in the future become economically attractive for the Pacific and Gulf coasts and for the Great Lakes, the Atlantic coast appears to be the most likely candidate for early deployment. Perhaps the most serious limitation is the fact that while this report is gener4C in nature, the issues surrounding deployment of any single FNP facility are highly site-specific. Only,after a particular site has been chosen can most issues be meaningfully addressed in the necessary detail. issues not apparently important from a generic viewpoint could be central in specific instances and vice versa. Thus it shoUd not be Inferred from any of the following discussions that deployment of individual FNPs must await resolution of any or all of the questions raised. Equally important, omission of a question or issue here does not imply that implementation should proceed without its consideration. in general, offshore siting decisions will be made on the basis of a broader view of'thd balance bf economic, social and environmental costs and benefits than is portrayed here. This report shou. not be interpreted as a universal evaluation of the offshore concept. overview Examination of individual floating nuclear powerplants and their potential impacts on man and the environment leads the Council on Environmental Quality to the conclusion that there is reason for guarded optimism about their overall bmwfit. This optimism arises from the comparison of nuclear powerplants sited offshore with those sited onshore. An offshore nuclear powerplant In by no means a not benefit to the ocean environment, nor should it be expected to be. Compared to onshore plants, there appears, on the basis of currently available information, to be little significant difference in overall environmental acceptability.. This is not.to say that the offshore concept can be recommended without.. qualification or reservation. For example, while it iCpossible to estimate the environmental, economic, and safety consequences of a sLngle MP facility, only the most rudimentary guesses can be made about the effects of a cluster or string of several facilities. The importance of clarifying our understanding of.this question is apparent: substantial differences in the effects of limited versus Large-scale deployment of FNP9 would indicate a need for additional emphasis on longer range and more coordinated planning. FNP Illustrated Although several designs have been advanced for offshore nuclear power facilities, only one has been thoroughly developed and analyzed. The FNP has been designed by Offshore Power Systems and Public Service Electric knd@Gas Company for installation near Atlantic City, N.J. It is used for illustrative pL oses throughout the re port. urp The PSUG proposal (see Figure 1-1) has the follow\" components: a A massive D-shaped breakwater 0 Two barge-mcunted 1,150-magawatt electric plants 0 A five-cable transmission system a An onshore construction and maintenance facility. The breakwater (as designed for a water depth of 45 feet) would be the largest structure every placed in the ocean.

The breakwater itsele would cover 15 acres of ocean bottom The perimeter of the breakwater would enclose an area at the mean low water level of roughly 0.12 square miles, 700 yards by 500 yards The breali-.watar would contain 5.5 million tons of aggregate, stone, and reinforced concrete, roughly the amount required for Hoover Dam Two FNPs in the breakwater would each generate 1,150 megawatts of electricity, enough to supply the 1972 power consumption of a city the size of Baltimore or of a state with a population as large as Maine's - The steel barge hulls would be 378 feet by 400 feQt by 44 feet high - The reactor building would rise 174 feet and would be protected by a 34-foot steel wave shield -- Located 3 miles offshore, plants and breakwater, would appear to be the same size as a 1,000-foot ocean liner viewed from 1/2 mile away. The following sections very briefly summarize the 6antent and findings of the chapters which follow. Perspective: The Overall Nuclear Power Outlook No matter what view one takes of future energy consumption -- high growth or low growth -- one is led to the conclusion that electric power consumption will continue to gzcw rapidly and that nuclear power will become an increasingly important source of electricity. The most conservative estimates show electricity growing from 25 percent of total energy consumption to well over@one-third and electric energy generated by nuclear powerplants growing from 2 percent to over .50,percent of electric energy in the year 2000. In absolute terms, the thermal energy generated by nuclear powerplants will grow (under moderate assumptions) from 0.4 quadrillion Btus in 1971 to around 40 quadrillion Btus in 2000 -- a one hundredfold increase. This growth trans- lates into a need for 300 to 400 new nuclear powerplants of 1,150 MWe capacity. It is anticipated that nearly 40 percent of the growth (120 to 160 plants) will serve a strip 200 miles wide along the 4tlantic coast. Roughly half of these are likely to serve the area from Maine through Pennsylvania, the other half south from Pennsylvania to Florida. Why Offshore? These energy estimates are not self-fulfilling. Nuclear power generation has consistently lagged behind projections. The principal reasons for the se deploy ment lags have been siting problems and technical difficulties in construc- tion and operation. Indeed, the difficulties are expected to grow because a higher rate of construction will dilute the existing pool of trained personnel and because relatively uncontroversial plant sites will become increasingly scarce. Both of these factors are ncw causing utility executives to look seaward. Nuclear plants that can be mass-produced and then towed to offshore sites may mitigate the technical problems associated with on-site construction of onshore plants, even if present efforts to standardize onshore plants are successful. Perhaps most important, if offshore locations are less controversial than onshore, nuclear plants could be built nearer load centers and with less delay than usual. it is difficult to compare directly the cost of an offshore facility with its onshcre counterpart because in both cases costs are highly site-specific and relative costs can be expected to change significantly over the time'it takes to actually emplace such a facility. At any given offshore site cost is a.function of several factors: the region in which it is located (labor and transportation costs differ significantly), plant configuration (number of plants within a breakwater), water depth and design wave heights, distance from shore, composition of seabed, etc. Despite the difficulty in making a comparison, total offshore costs appear to be perhaps 20 percent higher under current conditions (see Chapter 111), but this amount could be pared significantly if manufacturing facilities where standardized FNPs will be produced reach full production volume, if the large uncertainty factor presently built into anticipated breakwater costs were reduced, and if cooling systems necessary to meet new EPA effluent guidelines for onshore plants proved more expensive. Even today it appears that offshore plants would be competitive in the Northeast region. Combined with severe siting difficulties in that area, the relative costs suggest that offshore siting willbe an economically viable alternative. 'Given the need for electrical power, and the potential economic viability of the FNP concept, it is necessary to examinelother considerations -- safety, environ- mental effects, other uses of the offshore areas, and the legal and institutional implications of offshore-deployment. FNP Safety Although generalizations are presently difficult or even impossible, important observations related to offshore plant safety can be made. The potential for accidents arising from events internal to the FNP is not much different from an onshore nuclear plant with one exception. Barge-mounted plants are subject to wave and tidal motion which, although limited by the breakwater and the mooring system, could affect the performance and reliability of important plant'' elements. Further, the FNP is located in a corrosive environment. Although the probability is low, these factors conceivably could combine to initiate equipment --Failure and exacerbate otherwise minor accidents. A more important difference in safety is the potential for accidents initiated external to the FNP. Proper siting and barge and breakwater design can probably ,accommodate storms and waves safely and can offer protection against collision with large vessels -- even vessels containing hazardous cargo. The likelihood and effects of accidents which are unique to offshore locations are largely unexplored, however, and need to be more fully addressed. Simply lack of experience suggests that even more caution than is usually exercised with regard to the licensing of nuclear powerplants be applied to FNPs. while severe meteorological conditions could require full or partial plant shutdown, the major question in these instances concern electric grid reliability rather than human health or ecological damage. Reliability becomes increasingly important with multiple deployment and could be a key factor in multiple deploy- ment decisions. Security against military attacki sabotage, and acts of terrorism also becomes an increasingly important factor as multiple deployment proceeds offshore. Environmental Effects It is difficult to conclude definitively whether offshore plants are environmentally more or less desirable than onshore plants. To a large degree, the difficulty is due to site-specific variations. PNPs offer some environmental benefits relative to similar onshore plants in terms of land availability and heat dissipation, bu t they also present some unique environmental problems in terms of disturbance of the marine ecology. offshore siting, however, offers an advantage over onshore in that it provides many additional feasible sites and thereby more flexibility to accommodate adjustments that can reduce environmental impacts and land use conflicts. A disadvantage is that the consequences of accidental releases, radioactive oe chemical, are difficult to assess because of the complexity of the ocean and the,offshore atmosphere as transport media. The major indirect environmental effect of FKP deployment is.probably the disturbance caused by large-scale granite quarrying and its transport. The local effects of quarrying cou ld be magnified by clustering several FNPs in the same general area. with this possible exception, the indirect environmental effects of FNPs do not appear significant. Since offshore plants are unlikely to be a source of inexpensive energy. they are unlikely to induce rapid onshore industrialization. Specific findings are contained in Chapters V and VI. Tables I.-l. and 1-2 list environmental effects in summary fashion. The tables do not attach relative magnitudes tothe effects and thus cannot be used as a measure ofrelative impact. It should also be noted that in most cases, Federal and state regulatory programs will limit or prevent adverse environmental impacts. Other Uses of Offshore Areas The ocean along the coast is a valuable resource. Any use that forecloses other uses represents an additional cost to society -- an opportunity cost, in economic terms. Chapter VII discusses other uses and points out those that may be competitive. Table 1-3summarizes the findings and categorizes potential conflicts with other uses of the offshore areas. FNP site selection decisions should recognize these potentially competing uses. This is another consideration that becomes more important with multiple FNP deployment -- as well as'with increasing use of offshore areas for other purposes.

Legal and Institutional Considerations As shown in Chapter VIII, the Federal process for licensing MPs in coastal waters involves several agencies, each with separate responsibilities. This process is in need of streamlining to eliminate unnecessary duplicative efforts and Federal action is being taken to accomplish this. For all their present complexity, present Federal and state regulatory procedures provide many opportunities for interested parties to participate in the consideration of environmental. economic, and social questions. Any changes in regulatory procedure must retain this feature. As for questions of international law, the United States clearly may deploy an FNP in its territorial sea (0 to 3 miles out). Further offshore on the high seas, an PNP would have to be constructed and operated with reasonable regard for other uses of the sea, and must not involve an assertion of sovereignty. In Fine Although this report is on balance guardedly optimistic about the overall benefit of FNPs, the acceptability of future FNP deployment will depend critically upon public appreciation of their relative merit. Thus. efforts in response to the information inadequacies noted In this report must provide answers to the satisfaction of the public in general -- not just the technician. Further, subsequent findings and the concerns of the public could introduce important issues for future consideration not identified in this report. CMPTER II NATIONAL ENERGY OUTLOOK' During the 25 years from 1949 to 1974, U.S. energy consumption increased in all but three years. it increased from 31.5 quadrillion Btus to 73.2 quad- rillion Btus -- a 3.2 percent annual rate -- while per capita energy usage rose at a 1.6 percent annual rate. Experience over the 25-year period maisks the accelerated growth in energy consumption during the more recent past, as shown in Table 11-1. Oh both a total and a per capita basis, the 1965-70 growth rates far exceed those of earlier periods. There are several reasons for the high growth rite of the sixties. In particular, 1961 to 1969 was the most prolonged period of economic prosperity of this century. The rapid rise in GNP during this period obviously contributed to the high rate of energy consumption. In addition, fuel prices declined rela- tive to other prices. Fossil fuel per million Btus was priced at 35.0 cents Table 11-1 Energy Production and Consumption, 5-Year intervals Energy Production Energy Capita Average annual Average annual Gross BTUs growth rate for Gross BTUs growth rate for Year (quadrillions) 5-year periods (millions) 5-year periods 1950 34.0 - 1955 39.7 3.1% 239.3 1.4% 1960 44.6 2.3 246.8 0.6 1965 53.3 3.6 274.4 2.1 1970 67.4 4.8 329.1 3.7 Source: Dupree.

These prices are in 1967 cents weighted by consumption. Two factors -- increasing income and declining relative prices account for much of the growth of energy consumption during the past decade. Proiections of Energy Consumption Although understanding past energy supply and demand is es.sential to projections, these relationships are becoming less reliable as the basis for prediction. Many new uncertainties have recently entered the energy picture as a result of the emergence of oil as an international political weapon, the rise of energy prices beyond experience, massive Federal expenditures and incentives for energy research and development, growing awareness of energy conservation, and, perhaps more Important, an avowed national goal of energy self-sufficiency. The net effect of these factors is to invalidate previous energy projections and make current projections extremely uncertain. Given the uncertainty implicit in any energy projections, three scenarios representing a wide range of possibilities are presented here: � a \"high\" rate of growth, which assumes continuation of trends of the years prior to the 1973 Arab oil embargo. � a \"medium\" rate of growth, reflecting recent increases in fuel prices but little or no change in Federal energy policies. a \"low\" rate of growth, which assumes large-scale conservation of energy and improvement of energy conversion efficienc' ies. The three levels of demand are shown by consuming sector in Table 11-2. The fuels required are shown in Table 11-3. Because the projections are ranked in the order of total demand, individual components of the \"low\" cases are not always the lowest figures of the three levels, the \"high\" figures are not.always the highest, and the 'medium\" do not always fall between the two. Electric Power Proiections The preceding energy projections all foresee tremendous growth both in the generation and in the use of electricity, particularly electricity produced through nuclear power.

The growth is related both to population growth of about 1.3 percent each year and mounting per capita use. The relatively low cost of electric energy and the convenience, cleanliness, versatility, and reliability of electric equipment have been major influences on the continued increase in con- sumption. Table 11-4 details energy use for electric power generation for the three energy consumption levels. Although thereis a wide range in terms of con- sumption, there is much less difference when consumption of electricity is seen in relation to total energy. In each case electricity composes from 34 to 42 percent of the total in 2000, compared to 27 percent in 1974. Even the low Table 11-4 Energy Resource Inputs for Electric Power Generation (quadrillion Btus) 1974 2000 Actual High Medium Low coal 8.7 17@. 5 17.0 13.1 Petroleum 3.4 5.0 4,.11 2.2 Natural Gas 3.4 2.6 2.0 Hydropower 2.9 6.0 @3.7 3.7 Nuclear 1.2 49.2 40.5 20.4 Geothermal --- 1.4 1.4 19.6 80.3 68.7 40.8 Electricity as a percentage of total energy 26.8 41.8% 41.9% 33.7% Nuclear energy as a percentage of total, energy 1.6% 25.6% 24.7% 16.9% Annual growth rates of electricity 1971 to 200 5.4% 5.1% 3.8% Nuclear power 18.0% 18.0% 16.8% growth rates case, which aims at national self-sufficiency, and assumes very high levels of conservation, shows a high rate of electrification. Note the large increas es in consumption of electricity despite declines in projected electricity growth rates below historical levels. A decline in the growth rate of electricity consunption seems probable, particularly in light of recent,price increases and the likelihood of further rises. It should be,noted that the many authoritative forecasts of electric power made since 1970 have almost unanimously erred by overest imating future growth rates. Table II-S translates the electric energy consumption projections into estimates of electric generating capacity. Here, as in the previous table, the projected growth of nuclear power stands out. Even,under the most restrictive scenario, nuclear generating capacity increases 20 times from 1974 to 2000. if the typical power facility of the next quarter century has a capacity of 2,300 megawatts, nearly 170 new nuclear facilities would have to come- on line by 2000 at the low demand projection and over 400 at the high level. At the national'and regional levels, increasing reliance on electric energy is independent of the Particular consumption level. Table II-61'shows regional requirements under assumptions of high overall energy growth rates. However, although the grcwth in generating capacity of all types'is projected-to be fairly uniform across the Nation, nearly 40 percent of new nuclear capacity added by 2000 is likely to serve a 200-mile wide strip along the.@Alantic Coast. Under any forecast level of total energy consumption, this projection translates Into more than 100 nuclear generating stations. Half will probably be needed for Maine through Pennsylvania and the other half south through Florida. -Supply constraints The growing importance of nuclear power is a direct result of constraints on the use of other fuels -r- relative price increases, environmental regulations, and availability of land and of the resources themselves.

It can be converted to liquid and gas as well as to electri- city.. But coal Is becoming more costly because of health and safety regulations and the remoteness of new deposits. Significant additional production appears several years away, and competition over current production has made it ve .ry difficult to secure future coal contracts. Further, storage of the coal and ash handling involve significant land and aesthetic costs. Oil When.all geological forms -- shale and tar sands -- are considered, oil is potentially abundant. Nonfuel uses and environmental safeguards limit the domestic oil available at moderate prices, and reliance on intern ,ational supplies involves national security issues. The technologies to develop some domestic supplies (shale and tar,sands) are not fully developed and will surely lead to significant environmental challenges. Local storage facilities use large amounts of land ardtend to be aesthetically displeasing. Natural,Gas Available in larger quantities than in generally perceived under the current suppressed price situation, proven supplies of natural gas are limited domestically Reliance on international supplies raises national security questions.. Content of sulfur and ash is ideal for meeting emission standards, but its natural vola- tility raises health and safety concerns in transport and use. Hydropower Hydropower-is inexpensive and clean form of energy. However, additional domestic sites are few, and development may present significant environmental problems. But beyond that, hydropower in the form of pumped storage for peaking requirements is only about 65 percent efficient. 21 Nuclear supplies of nuclear fuel are currently viewed as secure,.and nuclear energy produces little air pollution under normal operations. With recent and anticipated cost increases for the primary resourcesi, nuclear fuel will becomerelatively cheap, particularly alpng the East coast. on the other hand, thermal water emissions are expensive to control. The issues of fuel reprocessing, long-range waste disposal, and nuclear safety present land-use, environmental, and health and safety problems. Purther, capital costs are very high, and construction times have been long'. In general terms,.the above factors or more correctly, their economic implications -- strongly influence the consumption projections'that are presented. Nuclear power is an attractive solution to many current energy problems, not the least of which are of fuel availability and reliability. Several of the negative factors for nuclear power may be-mitigated by offshore locations. 22 CHAPTER III ECONOMIC XSSESSMENT,OF OFFSHORE NUCLEAR POWERPLANTS Although the ultimate decision to deploy a technology depends upon relative economic factors -- and the generalization certainly is true for offshore nuclear powerplants -- the possible \"costs\" must be weighed against possible \"benefits.\" The evaluation must include not only the classical costs of capital operation and maintenance that accrue directly to the owner but also the costs that rarely take monetary form and most often accrue to society as a whole when left uncontrolled. Ecological and aesthetic considerations are prime examples. This chapter addresses the conventional economics of the promosed.ftoating nuclear plant, briefly compares costs of FNPs and onshore plants, and demonstrates how location offshore is constrained by the economics of water depth, distance offshore, meteorologicalconditions, etc. Several concepts have been proposed for the offshore nuclear plant: artificial islands.. bottom-seated plants,with floating breakwaters, submerged and semisubmerged plants am@Sqg them. (See Appendix D..) Manv appear auite -promising. but the one that has received extensive attention and is progressing twoard the implementation stage was proposed by offshore Power Systems (OPS) and Public Service Elecjri_c__a_n,4 Gas (PSE&G) of New Jersey. OPS has proposed barge-mounted nuclear powerp@ants moored permanently inside a massive breakwater or other barrier.' PSE&G's proposed generating station consists of two OPS powerplants within a breakwater located north of Atlantic C ity about 3 miles out. It is depicted,in Figure 1-1. The floating nuclear powerplant (FNP). will be a complete electric generating station of standardized design built on A floating platform in a shipyard-like facility. Plant components and systems will be nearly identical to the recently licensed pressurized water reactor (PWR) nuclear powerplants'. The supporting platform will be a specially designed barge. 23 The breakwater discussed in this study is the one initially proposed by PSE&G for the Atlantic Generating Station (see Appendix A). It is roughly D-shaped, covers about 100 acres, and contains about 6.5 million tons of sand. gravel, rock. and concrete . The curved portion faces open ocean; it is about 3,000 feet long, 300 feet thick at the base, and 30 feet thick at the top and extends 64 feet above mean lower water (mean Low Water for the Atlantic Generating Station is approximately 45 feet). The straight section of the breakwater is approximately 2,140 feet long and is partially constructed of removable caissons to pezmit entry or exit of the FNPs.. Both ends of the straight section are constructed of sand, rock, and dolosse. These dolosse are very large precast concrete forms (tetrapods) whose shape was selected to provide interlocking which minimizes their motion under severe wave attack. The powerplants will have multiple high-voltage cables which will connect to the onshore electrical grid at a switching yard. In addition to.the switching facility, the plant will also,require a small area for materials and personnel, about 15 acres. Further, for the handling and processing of breakwater construc- tion materials-a landside site of as much as 100 acres, with access to the ocean is required. PSE&G has begun preliminary applications to site an OPS station about 3 miles out from Atlantic City. OPS has applied for a license to manufacture the barge- mounted plants at.a facility on Blount Island, near Jacksonville. Capital Costs The capital costs presented here are based on the current concept proposed by OPS in accordance with the \"Guide for Economic Evaluation of Nuclear Reactor Plant Design in the U.S'.\" 531, NUS Corporation, January 1969. -The figures were provided by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory CONCEPT code. The capital costs. derive from the barge-mounted powerplant, the breakwater and mooring system, transmission lines, and shore facilities. The Barge-Mounted Powerplant The analysis assumes an FNP consisting of a barge-amounted pressurized water reactor powerplant of -conventional 'design having a net electrical output of 1,150 megawatts, and using seawater for *'once-through flow of condenser cooling. Except for installation of the nuclear fuel, the FNP is assemblad and functionally tested in a facility similar to a shipyard. The owners of-the manufacturing facility are assumed responsible for designing, engineering, manufacturing, testing (without fuel), and preparing the plant for shipment. The overall capital cost of one barge-mounted powerplant is approxi- mately $368 million. Component'costs are presented in Table 111-1. Breakwater and Mooring System An offshore breakwater large enough to protect a two-unit nuclear powerplant has never been built. The estimated costs were extrapolated from existing data an lesser enterprises. Construction of the breakwater is estimated at about $180 million, as shown in Table 111-2. The cost includes a 33% allowance for uncertainties in offshore construction costs. It consists primarily of the purchase, transportation, and placement of 5 million tons,of rock at an upper limit of $18 per ton, including a 400- mile,barge haql. and of 705,000 tons of reinforced concrete structures at about $100 per cubic yard (or $50 per ton), including materials and labor of onshore construction, transportation, and emplacement at-the offshore site. Hauling the rock over 400 miles increases costs at a rate of $3 million per 100 miles. Several mooring systems have been proposed for limiting horizontal movement, of the FSP. The estimated cost is about $10 million per FNP, or $20 million for : two-unit station. ransmission Lines The most reliable, safe, and esthetic method of transmitting power to shore from an offshore station is by cable buried in the ocean floor. Buried cables are unaffected by violent storms, protected from collision with vessels, and hidden from view. it is likely that each FNP will be required to have two independent three- phase circuits leading to an onshore switching station. A third circuit would be required for emergency use in case of damage or malfunction to one or the other cables. 25 Table III-1 Summary of estimated direct and indirect costs (F.O.B.) of the floating nuclear powerplant (FNP) (In millions of 1973 dollars) Equipment Description of Equipment and Labor Total Materials Direct Costs: ,Structures and Barge -21.0 33.0 .54.0 Reactor Plant Equipment 65.0 10.0 75.0 Turbine Plant Equipment 60.0 15.0 75.0 Electric Plant Equipment 17.0 9.0 26.0 Miscellaneous Plant Equipment 4.0 4.0 8.0 Total Direct Costs 167.0^ 71.0 238.0, Indirect Costs Contingency (10% of Direct Costs) 23.7 Factory Charges (20% of-Direct Costs) 47.4 Engineering-Management (25% of Direct Costs) 59.3 Total indirect Cost (55% of Direct Costs) 130.4 Table 111-2 Estimated Construction Costs of 109 Foot Breakwater for a Mean Low Water Level of 45 Feet* Item Cost (ii@ millions of-1973 dollars) caisson. 7 Rock 98 Dolosse (armor) 30 Contingency 45 Subtotal 180 mooring Facilities 20 TOTAL 200 *See Figure VI-7 for materials breakdown. 26 The two-unit station would require five three-phase cables. Buried cables in bays and alongshore are estimated at $1,325,000 per three-phase circuit-mile and underground.at about $855,000 per circuit-mile. For 8 miles underwater and 3 miles underground installation, the total cost is about $66 million. (Although the OPS-PSE&G plant would be 3 miles offshore, cables are not routed to the nearest shore point.) An allowance of $1 million is made for each of five flexible con- nections, at the FNP. As is customary for powerplant cost summaries, costs were not included for switchyard facilities and a step-up transformer. Thus the total : stimated,cost of transmitting power from offshore to the onshore switchyard Is ver $71 million. Shore Facilities A shore facility,serving as a link for distribution of material and labor is needed during the construction and operational life of the plant. It may include a dock, service and supply vessels, storage yards and wa .rehouses, concrete batch plant, offices, housing, and parking. Here the concrete caissons and breakwater armor (dolosse) will probably be made and the material, equipment, and personnel transported to the offshore site. Land costs, assuming 100 acres with 2,000 feet of ocean front at $1,000 per front foot, would be about $2 million...For development of the shore facility tosupport construction of the two@-unit st ations, a total of $6 million is estimated. Total capital costs for the two-unit station and support facilities are presented in Table 111-3. Table 111-3.

Sea bottom slopeo population constraints on radiation dosages, design wave parameters, aesthetic considerations, alternative site uses, etc. all enter into s.election of an FNP location. Consideration of the variables,may result in require- ments for higher breakwaters and longer transmission lines. The implications on capital costs are briefly discus,sed.below. What wave the breakwater must be designed to withstand depends on exposure of the site to storm-induced surges., to tsunamis, and to nonbreaking, breaking, or broke .waves. These variables, in turn, depend on other factors. Water depth at an offshore breakwater has a major influence on structural design because of the influence of depth on wave height. It also determines the convergence or divergence of wave energy and affects water currents. The break- water must be designed to withstand the most destructive wave possible at the site. The relatively shallow water of the continental shelf directly limits maximum wave height. Shoiild the breakwater be constructed in deeper water and/or where the maximum wave height is increased, costs would, of course, rise. They are shown in Table 111-4 for a breakwater of two heights. The cost of rock more than doubles, Table 111-4 Estimated Construction Costs of 109-Foot and 134-Foot High Breakwaters at 45 Feet Mean Low Water Level (millions of 1973 dollars) Item _____l09 Ft. 134.

Thus a 23% increase In height raises con- struction,costs by nearly 84%, suggesting that breakwater costs can vary by more than the breakwater height raised to the second power. Height significantly affects cost because the volume of material and labor increases by more than the square of the height. other factors that affect the bulk of the breakwater are the.plane and vertical shape and slope of the sides. The shape is determined when the effect of wave attack is minimized, the configu- ration requirements of the contained floating nuclear powerplant are met, and the breakwater can withstand large vessel collisions. The side slopes are simply a function of size and density of armor units and construction methods. There is a general trend toward increased use of dolosse instead of quarry stone. Dolosse can be uniformly produced in a given size, whereas it is difficult to quarry equally large stones of nearly uniform size. Dolosse have better stability characteristics than quarry stone: this means that lighter-weight armor units may be used or that side slopes of the breakwater may be steepened. Steepening the side slopes reduces the volume of material required for a given structure (hence, its cost) and reduces the required reach of handling equipment, for example, the floating cranes. Development of denser concrete may further reduce armor unit Aize and total weight, which would reduce the required capacity of handling equip- ment. Bottom material at a proposed offshore breakwater site is also significant in determining the breakwater design. Soft bottom materials may not adequately support a breakwater unless a sufficient filter blanket is provided, and granular bottom materials may be eroded or scoured by strong water currents. Assurcing a constant water depth, the major cost resulting from varying offshore distances is the cost of the plant-to-shore electrical transmission system. Although the distance from shore may be less than the 3 miles assumed here, it is likely that public or regulatory interests may require longer plant- to-shore distances. Technologically, the limit for underground alternating current high-voltage power transmission without intermediate equipment stations is about 20 miles. This represents an additional 9 miles of sea floor installation for each of.the five cables discussed above. The additional 45 miles of three-phase circuits for a two-unit station costs about $60 million, or $26.1 per kilowatt (electric). Figure 111-1 illustrates the relationship of distance from shore with total capital'cost per kilowatt (electric). $k/We 77' ......... ....... .. .... ... .. .. ............... 520 .............. ............. rev ... ........ .. ..... ........ .... . ....... ............. ............. ... ............ . ...... . ....... ............ .... ........... . ..... ..................... . 31 ....... .... . . ......... .... . .. .............. ........... . .. . .......... ....... .'77' ................... ........... . .......... ....... ........ .. ...... .... . ................. 44c ....... ....... ... ... . ...... ........ . ................... .... . .. . ..... ..... ........ ....... . ............... ..... .. .... .... .... ........ .. -!IPO :::7.: ... ......... ........ ........ ......... .... .... ...... ............. .......... ................ ...... ....... ................ .... ................. ......... ............ .......... ......... ... ............. . .. .. ... ... . .............. .......... - ........... .7= ....... . . .. ... 2 4 6 10 12 14 Miles from Shore Figure 111- 1. Capital Costs of a 2-Unit Floalinig Nuclear Generating Station as a Punction of Distance offshore. 30 Offshore versus Onshore Capital Costs Relative Plant Construction Costs Floating nuclear powerplants are economically attractive from several vi points. One of the most favorable aspects is the ability to build FNPs in a facility similar to a shipyard. The cost savings are similar to those generally found for any item of mass production. onshore powerplants have always been constructed as custom. one-of-a-kind entities. For each facility, different laborers and craftsmen were recruited. trained, and organized to carry out the construction peculiar to the plant and site. The problem is particularly acute in construction of nuclear powerplants where construction must meet very stringent standards and specific site chazac- taristics. Wages and turnover are generally higher in the construction industry than elsewhere and productivity lower. These problems have been reflected in the long slippages experienced in nuclear plant construction schedules and in the opem ting difficulties frequently experienced after a plant is brought on line. The MY avoids many of these problma and costs. Current planning is that powerplants will be built on shallow-draft floating platforms using assembly line procedures. Construction of Me would be amenable to the construction techniques of shipyards, where there is a permanent base of shops, equipment, and materials. A fixed construction site using a mass production approach in expected to stabilize the skilled labor force and increase efficiency as individual craftsmen learn from repetition. Construction of power stations in a factory setting should improve qualit, of workmanship. Recent delays in bringing land-based power stations into full commercial operation have been found to result from poor quality work and inadequate inspection during construction. Quality control in the factory setting can be more rigorously and effectively administered than at a field construction site. 31 In addition, the reduced labor requirements and use of a well-equipped manufacturing plant at a site having a favorable cl`.nate for a year-round activity should permit more rapid completion of an operable floating power station than for curzent land-based construction. Moreover, shorter construction time will result in lower capital costs because of reduced cost escalation due to inflation, reduced total interest charges on borrowed money, and earlier revenue from operations. with inflation and interest each at about 8 to 10%. even modest reductions in can- struction time could significantly reduce t:otal capital costs. According to the AEC, efficiency,in a shipyard is equal to a reduction of 2 man-hours per man-day in a typical construction situation. Shipyard efficiency for two barge units, then, would save $S2 million if 1 man-hour per kilowatt (electric) costs $13 million. In addition, when manufacturing operations reach the planned output level of eight MPs per year, this efficiency will shorten elapsed construction time by at least 1 year., At,that level the capital invest- ment in two units would decrease by about 10% of the direct costs, or around $50 million. Thus an assembly line approach to plant construction could save P100 million for a 2, 300 megawatt. facility. Relative Cost of thermal Emissions Control In a nuclear powerplant only.about 31 percent of the heat released in the boiler is converted into electrical energy. The unused heat energy is discharged through the turbine condenser cooling water. Condenser cooling water has often been handled on a \"once through\" basis in other 'words it is drawn f rom a nearbv water body, pumIped throuch the condenser, and then discharged directly to its source. Large volumes of water are involved -- about 1,S50 cubic, feet per second in a modern 1,000-megawatt fossil fuel plant and the discharge stream is from 60 to 176C warmer than the inlet stream. This temperature differential coinbined with a high flow rate is generally injurious to life in the receiving inland water body. 3 2 Because of the increasing difficillty in finding natural bodies of water that aan accept waste heat, new generation facilities are using coolinq,ponds and cooling towers. Further, EPA requires closed-cycle cooling systems for all power- plants, unless a specific exemption is granted. Thus by 1980 the great majority of now inland generating facilities will employ some form of closed-cycle cooling system. Siting an offshore powerplant is a way of using the heat assimilation capacity of the ocean and its subsequent heat rejection capability. Theoretically, the cooling capacity of the ocean over the continental shelf is several orders of magni- tude greater than the total waste heat load expected to result from all electricity generation in the United States over the next century. And although complete and instant mixing obviously cannot be achieved, the much larger heat sink provided by the'oceans will mitigate the plant's thermal discharge. The thermal capacity of the ocean is distinctly valuable because offshore plants may act have to install cooling towers or acquire costly land for coolinq ponidis.' ror the proposed two-unit station off New Jersey, the savings on cooling towers alone range from $30 to $120 million ($13 to $52 per kilowatt eleciri-fic- , '-deip''e-nid-ing on the type of tower. The higher costs in this range apply to water-deficient areas where dry cooling towers are required. Relative Land Cogts As discussed in Chapter 11, a nuclear generating station requires 300 to 350 acres of land fo r the generating facilities and additional land for the exclusion zone. if the acreage does not front on a waterway, considerably more land must be added for cooling ponds. Often the same general features that make a large site ideal for a generating plant also make it well suited for otbir types of industry. Large industrial facilities ususally require similar acreage with pro- vision for future expansion near highway, railroad, or barge transportation. Acquisition of potential generating plant sites is growing more competitive and expensive. The rising demand for recreational use of the waterfront has increased competition among recreation project, industrial, and powerplant developers for the same space. Nuclear powerplants are generally remote from the population centers that they serve. Although distance tended to reduce land costs somewhat at the generating site, additional land had to be acquired for transmission line rights- of-way. Thus, lower per acre costs for the plant was negated by higher acreage requirements for the longer transmission distance. With projected population Increases along the coasts and waterways, competition for sites with available water supplies at acceptable distances from load centers is expected to boost land costs for future inland nuclearpowerplants. offshore plants,are not nearly as constrained.by land availability and cost. .A landside support area of about 100 acres is necessary during the breakwater construction phase, only about 15 acres permanently. Thus tl@ere is roughly a 300-acre land advantage that accrues to offshore plants. If the price of land is assumed to be $20,000 per acre, the savings is $6 million. Relative Safety Costs The cost disadvantages of offshore siting are associated with the need to protect the powerplants from hazards not experienced on land and with the uncer- tainties.generally associated with application of new technologies.- The most obvious and largest single additional cost is for the breakwater and the mooring system. The problems.inherent, to transporting large volumes of quarried rock and scheduling placement of materials to take advantage of acceptable weather conditions appear one of the major challenges of breakwater construction. Construction in open waters involves greater difficulties than the relatively straightforward site preparation work at a land-based plant. The contingency allowance of 33% is very conservative in view of the risks and uncertainties in offshore construction. Before the PUP.is emplaced inside the protective breakwater, it must be towed through open seas. During this trip from the manufacturing plant, it is-vulnerable to a number of hazards. The risk takes econmic form in insurance premiums and added design features to make it seaworthy. other features are added to protect the FNP after emplacement. Special security and protective measures must be developed to cope with the potential threat of sabotage, for example, and these costs must all be included. one of the least quantifiable disadvantages of offshore siting is the uncertainty of tra nemitting power ashore. High volt age (345 KV) submarine cables would be buried under the ocean floor. considerable research has been performed on submerged high voltage cable, but the only directly applicable experience is a connection across New York Harbor between PSE&G in-Jersey City and Consolidated Edison Co., in Brooklyn. The length of the tie is 6 3/4 miles; 6,600 feet uses copper conductors in an oil-filled pipe for the harbor crossing. The pipe was trenched into the river bottom and back-filled with sand. However, the fact remains that such high-voltage lines have not yet,been completely proven. The risk an d additional development must also be considered costs of off- shore siting. The technological uncertainty may be offset somewhat by the fact that offshore nuclear powerplants will probably be permitted,to locate nearer the load centers V than would onshore plants. Based primarily upon population dosages, a recent study suggests that land-based reactors may have to be sited 30 to 50 miles,from very large population centers while offshore locations may satisfy ran teness require- ments only 15 to 20 miles from population centers (see Chapter IV). Proximity will probably cut costs for onshore transmission, at least partially offsetting the additional costs of offshore transmission. Overall Comparison Construction costs were estimated for onshore-nuclear powerplants using once- through cooling in four industrial areas: Philadelphia, Atlanta, New Orleans, and Dallas. The estimates are based on costs of materials and labor over the past few years in order to show a typical plant completed in 1973. Labor productivity at each location was averaged out at 8 man-hours per kilowatt (electric). The 1973 costs of a single-unit, 1,150-MWe pressurized water reactor station near Philadelphia are compared to a single-unit FNP in Table 111-5. The only significant difference is the 45% higher labor cost associated with wage and fringe benefits available in field construction.

Total costs are compared for fully operational 2-unit stations in Table 111-6. Recent experience with escalating wage rates and evidence of decreasing construction pr oductivity may be more severe than shown, particularly in the Northeast. Up to 12 man-hours/kWo has been reported in the Philadelphia area, and it may be that 10 man- hours/kWe is a more realistic average in other regions. When the number of man-hours per kilowatt (electric) risen from 8 to 10, the cost of a two-unit onshore nuclear powerplant goes up about $80 million. Further declines in productivity could increase the onshore powerplant capital costs as much as $110 milion -- $48 per XWe. The cost ranges of the on- and offshore stations are given in Table Z11-7.* Although initially the offshore station may have higher capital investment costs, offshore unit costs are expected to 'decrease and onshore unit costs to continue to increase. The cost ranges reflect the uncertainties of labor costs,and site-specific requirements. No serious effort was made to fix the capital costs in terms of future dollars. However, assuming a continuation of current trends in material and.labor costs, escalation of construction costs for onshore powerplants in Philadelphia and the Northeast as a whole would,lead to a more favorable capital cost.position for FNP8 in that part of the country. At the present time, it appears that escalation would not affect relative capital costs for the Gulf coast and'the southern Atlantic.

Transporting staff and supplies over water is a cost disadvantage of offshore s1teslexperience in other industries shows that costs are not generally excessive. Radioactive fuel elements will have to be shipped from the FNP to reprocessing plants onshore, entailing both longer transport distances and increased handling as trans- port modes are changed. Again, it is doubtful that the costs would be critical. operating and maintenance costs for nuclear powerplants (excluding charges and nuclear insuraftce) typically amount to about 5% of annual plant operating cost. Personnel probably accounts for about one-half of this 5%. If wages, overtime pay, and personnel transportation costs at an offshore station were 50%,higher than at a land-based plant, these would still amount to only 1.5% of annual costs. with respect to maintenance, the FNP is readily accessible for barge shipment of buLky spare parts, but this accessibility is probably offset by the difficulty of installing large components on site due to lack of suitable handling equipment. without dry dock maintenance facilities, hulls will be maintained in place using cofferdams to provide dry working areas \" a relatively costly procedure. The expense can be minimized, however, with effective hull corrosion prevention. Another added operational cost of offshore plants is periodic dredging within the breakwater and under the barges. Periodic soundings will ascertain when hydraulic dredging is necessary to eliminate possible contact of the barge with the bottom. Although deposition of solids within the breakwater is generally a function of storm frequency and severity, sand deposition will be site - and design dependent, and dredgi!IE_is not expected to be a large cost. For example, the deposition of 3 feet of sand over 15 acres with dredging costs of $5 per cubic yard, would result in an annual cost of $360,000 -- about 0.4 percent of the total annual cost. If 30 feet were deposited, the figure would only be 4 percent. Repairs on the breakwater will generally result from storm damage. it is not uncommon for storm waves to remove heavy stone or dolosse from the face of breakwaters. Spare dolosse will have to be on hand and heavy barge equipment readily available to undertake repairs. Annual storm damage could require replacement of about 100 dolosse each weighing 40 tons each, at a cost of about $200,000 including placement, or 0.2 percent of annual costs. maintenance of buried transmission cables is not expected to be an important disadvantage of offshore powerplants. Routine maintenance is not expected, and possible cable damage by boat anchors or fish trawling can be minimized by adequate burial depth and prudent location. operating costs may be about 50 percent higher offshore than onshore. But the total is about one-half the cost of some mechanical draft wet cooling towers. Further, the entire increment amounts to just 2.0 to 2.5 percent of total annual costs. DECOMISSIONING COSTS Any nuclear powerplant is licensed for 40 years at most. 'Then the operator must renew or apply for termination of the license and for authority to decommission the facility. (He may apply for decommissioning authority earlier if circumstances warrant.) The methods of decommissioning vary with conditions and cbj ectives. However, experience with first-time efforts for relatively sm all, reactors (all less than 10OMwe, though indicating ready accomplishment and the variety of practical methods available, does not contribute much to estimating costs of decommissioning reactors in the 1,15OMwe category. The major difference is that the PWRs considered here have a much longer intended life and larger neutron flux, and differences in pressure vessel materials, mass, and design. Table 111-8 presents cost estimates of decommissioning a 1,150-MWe PWR plant comparable to an FKP'. Because these costs were developed from experience with small reactors, as mentioned above, there is considerable uncertainty, about actual costs. To provide firmer figures, a detailed analysis is being prepared as part of a \"Light water Reactor Decommissioning Study\" sponsored by the Atomic industrial Forum. This study is expected to be completed inlate 1974.

In a discussion of the costs of decommissioning offshore FNP generating stations, it is important to realize that t*he breakwater.and support facilities .may have to be decommissioned. Cost uncertainties in decommissioning onshore facilities are compounded offshore. However, it seems clear that the costs of constructing the breakwater and support facilities are such that the facilities may be very attractive for other uses after the FNPs.have been removed. Further, costs to remove the breakwater or even to maintain it as a safe structure (estimated at over $200,000 per year, including navigation aids, etc.) reinforce its,attractiveness for other uses. The,cost of maintaining it ($500,000 per year) to protect decontaminated ?NPs stored within seem prohibitive., The costs of decommissioning alternatives for FNPs are comparable to similar alternatives for onshore 1,150-Me PWRs. of great importance economically is the point that future dec-ri-issioning costs may not be significant in relation to total costs. For example, if the life of the FNP were 40 years and the discount rate were,10 percent, the present value of a de nissioning cost of $LOO million would be only $2.2 million. The time involved, discount rates, technological Innovations; future development of coastal and offshore regions, etc. lead to the conclusion that discussion beyond possible alternatives and feasibility based upon experience is-not particularly productive. it seems clear that capital expenditures for decommissioning may not be the determining factor either in FN@ deployment or in decommissioning methods choosen in the future. Rather, they may depend upon social and environmental costs. OVERALL ASSESSMMIT Floating nuclear ractors at offshore sites may become increasing economical as onshore construction costs continue to soar, particularly along the north Atlantic. However, even though this offshore concept could become less costly with experience, it wili probably never be a source of low-priced electricity in any absolute sense. There are means of reducing costs. it is clear that the breakwater controls the economics of offshore generating stations. Shared use of thelbreakwater by two generating plants is what makes the OPS proposal econcmicallyrealistic. For single-unit stations, the breakwater costs would lessen by about $36 million, ulting'in a unit cost J:s of about $492 per kilowatt (electric), whic.h is about percent higher than for a two-unit plant. indeed, the planned D-shaped breakwater appears to lend itself to four units by increasing the perimeter of the breakwater 1,000 feet to accomodate a square array of FNPs. :.Discounting potential technical and environmental limitations of this configuration, the additional 1,000 linear feet would add $80 million to site- related costs. Mooring facilities and transmission costs would double. but onsbore costs would be relatively unaffected. As a result, the capital investment for an offshore station with four FNP units would be about $1,925 million. The unit cost of $418 per kilowatt (electric) is a decrease of $21 per kilowatt (electric), or about 6 percent below the two-unit costs. Further savings could conceivably be realized by clustering stations. Two or more breakwaters served by the same shore facility would save some costs. Most important, however, breakwater construction sites in close proximity could benefit from the experience of the labor force and continued relationships with vendors. Thus, itappears that the pressures of economics will be in the direction of*larger generating stations than those presently proposed and probably toward clustering when feasible.- Where the offshore generating station with two FRPs is economically competitive with an onshore facility in the northeastern United States, the anticipated higher onshore construction costs.are expected to move the competitive regions farther south. Moreover, the potential economies of scale may extend the coastal regions in which FNPs are competitive. it is clear that for at least some portion of the Atlantic coast the proposed FXP is today competitve with onshore nuclear powerplants. It is possible that the social costs direct environmental effects, safety, and indirect economic or environmental effects will be ckitical to deployment of the FNP. REFERENCES O.H. Klepper and T.D.

CH&PTER IV POSSIBLE ACC=1WTS The safety of a nuclear pcwerplant proposed for a,given site will be evaluated in terms of the response of the plant and all of its subsystems to postulated disturbances in process variables, to potential external natural and manmade stresses (e.g., earthquakes, floods, explosions, aircraft impact at the site) and to postulated malfunctions or failures of equipment. The proposed design will be analyzed with respect to its capability to control or accommodate these situations. Often these safety, or accident, analyses identify limitations in expected performance of a plant at a site and thereby i.nfluence site selection and plant design. Basic Conceipts of Lquclear Powerplant Safety The characteristic of today's nuclear powerplants that impose overriding safety precautions is their capability of generating and accumulating large quantities of radioactive materials. In the event of an accident to the reactor, basically two objectives must be achieved. stopping the rapid generation of heat and preventing release of accumulated radioactivity. The powerplants are designed to have the capability to shut.down the reactor and to maintain it in a safe shutdown condition - the former to stop the nuclear chain reaction and associated generation of radioactivity and the latter to prevent resumption of the generation of radioactivity and to contain and control the inventory of radioactive materials within the reactor. Containment and control are accomplished by assuring the integrity of the reactor primary system where almost all the radioactive materials are located. To protect against the unlikely accident, such as the remote possibility that the primary system may be breached, nuclear powerplants have numerous engineered safety features. FNPs will be regulated primarily by the Atomic Energy Commission. Licenses are issued only for faciiities'that meet prescribed safety standards and criteria. Provisions for conservative design and operating mazgins and for redundancy of components and systems-compensate for the fact that uncertainties and risks can- not be reduced to zero. Thus, the' AEC requires applicants and licensees to ta Ike actions necessary to assure that risks are'reduced to acceptable levels and that tP the likelihood of severe accidents is extremely remote. Regulation is based upon a philosophy of three levels of safety. The first con cerns prevention of accidents. Each plant must be soundly designed, constructed of quality materials, tested, operated, and maintained in accordance with high standards and engineering_practices and with a high degree of freedom from faults and errors. The basic nuclear plant design must be inherently stable and have a large tolerance (e.g., fail-safe features) for off-normal conditions. The second level of safety is based on the premise that accidents occur in spite of care in design, construction, and operation. Safety systems that consist of reliable protection devices and systems designed to prevent, arrest, or safely acccnarrodate accidents are incorporated into the plant to protect.the operators and the public and to prevent or minimize damage when accidents occur. The third level supplements the first two by providing safety systems-to handle ,situations in which some protective systems are assumed to fail simultaneously with occurrence of the accident that they are designed to control. For each proposed plant several accident sequences are postulated as a basis for design and incorporation of plant features and equipment. These sequences are called Design-Basis Accidents (DBA). A nuclear plant is so designed that,little or no radioactive release would be expected as a result of DBA specified for the particular site and that the resultant offsite radiation doses would be within specifically defined acceptable limits. _D Examples of possible major accidents that an FNP may be required to withstand are listed in Table TV-1. Accidents may be categorized in a number of ways: by type of initiating agent (human, meteorologic, geologic, oceanographic), by system or component primarily affected (breakwater, barge, cooling water intake, reactor primary loop), by location of the initiating agent (external or internal), and by type of the accident-initiating stress (mechanical, thermal, chemical). The following discussion first treats the initiating stress, then internal acci- dents, and accidents during transport of radioactive materials. Mechanical Stresses Collisions Ships. One possible hazard to an FNP within a breakwater is ship collision. Undernormal conditions the use of sites remote from shipping lanes aAd*in relatively shallow water will reduce the collision probability by limiting the number and the size of vessels that can reach the facility. Several accident sequences are conceivable as a result of ships striking different portions of an offshore station. Large or high-speed ships are of particular concern because the damage is related to the kinetic energy of the moving ship. Fire and explosion also are of concern -'tankers, ammunition ships, and vessels with flamma le or 'explosive material are additionally hazardous. In general, the breakwater must safely stop a major vessel. As an indication of the probability of ships hitting the FNP9, collisions with offshore structures in the Gulf of Mexico were reviewed. Eight collisions reported during a 10-year period involving vessels over.1.000 gross tons are shown on Table IV-2. Twenty-two other collisions with fixed structures were : iso reported during this period; they are listed in Table IV-3. Of the latter ollisions, 15 involved vessels less than 10.0 gross tons and 7 vessels were between 100 and 650 gross tons. These data indicate that the likelihood of collisions was small inspite of some 2,000 exposed,structures in the Gulf of Mexico. Nonethe- less, the potential for collision must be examined for each proposed FNP site.

Here cost is the major limitation (see Chapter III). For a breakwater that is large enough, the primary danger from ship collision is subsicluen-t-fire and/or explosions or damage to the cooling water circulating system. Breakwater design must consider possible collisions in stormy seas. Althoughin severe storms, vessels @rould avoid coastal waters, the'possibility of a vessel running out of .Control must be considered. Because of the potential risks, the Advisory Committed on Reactor. Safeguards.(ACRS) has advised that \"studies should be made of the advantages and disadvantages of various additional measures to reduce ship-break- water collision probabilities, including active warning systems and a-separate ship arrester external to the breakwater.\"Y one of the-breakwaters proposed by PSE&G would have two openings, each 24 feet deep'and 75 feet wide. But when storms raise the-set level, large vessels could enter. Deflecting piling is being considered to prevent small ships within the breakwater from colliding with the plant. The Committee recommended further \"that the possible advantages to safety of a closed breakwater (possibly employing locks) be analyzed and receive careful consideration.,, 2/"
