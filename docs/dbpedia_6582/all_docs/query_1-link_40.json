        "text": "Multiple universes\n\n(Main series and Spin-offs)\n\nIs it really over? Was I really right? Someday... until the answer is found...\n\nGary Stewart at the end of Chapter 6[src]\n\nGary Stewart (ゲイリー・スチュワート, Geirī suchuwāto?) is a rookie agent of the now-defunct American government agency AMS. He is one of the main protagonists of The House of the Dead 2 and its upcoming remake, and also appears in a flashback in The House of the Dead 4.\n\nGary embarked on his first mission in 2000, a year after he joined the agency. Along with special agent James Taylor, Gary helped quell a citywide incident involving hostile biologically-engineered creatures, destroying the mastermind Caleb Goldman's final creation, Emperor, to save mankind.\n\nBiography[]\n\nGary Stewart was born in 1976.[1] He joined the AMS in 1999.[1] Despite his inexperience, he put full effort into his job; though his actions were sometimes reckless and concerned fellow agent James Taylor.[1]\n\n2000 incident[]\n\nMain article: The House of the Dead 2\n\nRookie Gary and veteran James Taylor were sent to neutralize a new undead threat on February 26, 2000. They defeated the duo Zeal and Kuarl, known together as Judgment, and the fish-like Hierophant before meeting up with two other agents, Harry Harris and Amy Crystal.\n\nThen they found out that the incident was organized by an individual named Caleb Goldman, who used the same technology that the main antagonist of The House of the Dead, Dr. Curien, used to create his mutants. The former was a financier of Curien's research, who later used the doctor's work to perpetuate his city-wide attack.\n\nGary and James, after separating from Amy and Harry after a sinister phone call from Goldman asking the agents to meet him at the coliseum, ventured through a system of underground tunnels to get there. Along the way they encountered Tower, a huge multi-headed snake-like beast which had already killed a large number of civilians.\n\nAfter Tower's defeat, they arrived at the coliseum to discover Goldman taunting them on a large screen, and found Amy and a critically injured Harry trapped with a chainsaw-wielding mutant monikered Strength. After defeating the mutant, Harry gave the agents a key to a car they could use to get to Goldman's headquarters.\n\nAfter encountering Judgment and Hierophant again and destroying them once again, they were waylaid outside the headquarters by Magician, who had been resurrected by Goldman. This time, however, the agents had the advantage because they knew the creature's weak points, which Thomas Rogan and G learned earlier.\n\nThey traveled to the top floor of the building and confronted Goldman. Goldman then unleashed his magnum opus, Emperor, who was created to rule over humanity. James and Gary defeated the creature after a long fight, while Goldman committed suicide by falling off the roof of his headquarters.\n\nGary, standing alongside a placated James, asked him if they did the right thing. James, not sure of the final outcome, announced that they must \"find the answer by [themselves]\". Gary stood by as James bids farewell to Goldman, and the two left the building.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nGary wields a IMI Desert Eagle.\n\nGary is the only protagonist agent that displays apprehension (regarding his actions in the series) as indicated by him asking if he and James \"did the right thing\" after Goldman's suicide.\n\nHe is shown protagonist agent in the menu for The House of the Dead 2's Boss Mode.\n\nHe is the only one besides Curien that says Magician's name, he says \"You're the only one who's gonna get defeated, Magician!\" if the player plays as him in solo play after defeating Magician.\n\nGary appears in Loving Deads: The House of the Dead EX as a cameo in Chapter 3's Detective Zobiko minigame.\n\nMuch like G before him, Gary's pistol in The House of the Dead 2 is much quieter than James', despite not having any visible suppressors or using a different ammo cartridge.\n\nGary makes a cameo appearance via flashback in The House of the Dead 4, where he is shown standing next to James pointing his handgun at Goldman in his office.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTo view the Gary Stewart gallery, click here.\n\nReferences[]\n\ncontent Characters James Taylor • Gary Stewart • Amy Crystal • Harry Harris • Caleb Goldman • G • Thomas Rogan • Civilians Creatures David • Steve • Johnny • Kageo • Randy • Ebitan • Bob • Max • Mickey • Ryan • Keith • Gregory • Ken • Ricky • Patrick • Peter • Lance • Franklin • Eric • Moowl • Devilon • Bouere • Murrer • Buyo • Mofish Bosses Judgment • Hierophant • Tower • Strength • Magician • Emperor Chapters A Prelude • Muddy • Darkness • Despair • Dawn • Original Sin Spin-offs English of the Dead • The Pinball of the Dead • The Typing of the Dead (Featuring Rakuten Minna no Shushoku Katsudou Nikki) • Zombie Da: Flick of the Dead Other pages Lore (AMS • City • Caleb Goldman's headquarters) Game modes (Boss Mode • Original Mode • Training Mode) Guidebooks (The House of the Dead 2 G's File • The House of the Dead 2 Perfect Guide) 2 & 3 Return • Action figures • Original Soundtrack • The House of the Dead 1 & 2 Music Collection • Original Sin prototype • Unused content"
