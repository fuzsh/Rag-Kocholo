        "text": "TEAMS AWARDS MEDIA BOOKS STATS TRADING CARDS IMAGES\n\nWilliam Hodgson \"Hod\" Stuart (February 20, 1879 – June 23, 1907) was a Canadian professional ice hockey cover-point (now known as a defenceman) who played nine seasons for several teams in different leagues. He also played briefly for the Ottawa Rough Riders football team. With his brother Bruce, Stuart played in the first professional ice hockey league, the American-based International Professional Hockey League (IPHL), where he was regarded as one of the best players in the league.\n\nFrustrated with the violence associated with the IPHL, he left the league late in 1906 and returned to Canada, where in 1907 he helped the Montreal Wanderers win the Stanley Cup, the championship trophy for hockey. Two months later, he died in a diving accident. To raise money for his widow and children, the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association hosted an all-star game, the first of its kind to be played in any sport.[1] An estimated 3,800 spectators attended the Hod Stuart Memorial Game on January 2, 1908, described by the Montreal Herald as \"unique in the history of hockey in Montreal, if not in the whole of Canada\".[2]\n\nIn an era when defencemen were expected to stay behind during the play, Stuart became known for his ability to score goals while playing a defensive role, and for his ability to remain calm during matches that often turned violent. He also became known for his work to reduce that violence and to increase the salaries of hockey players.[4] His efforts were acknowledged when the Hockey Hall of Fame was created in 1945 and he became one of the first nine players to be inducted.[5] He was joined there by his brother Bruce in 1961.[6]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nStuart was born in Ottawa, Ontario, the eldest son of William Stuart and Rachel Hodgson. He had two brothers, Alex and Bruce, and two sisters, Jessie and Lottio. Stuart was involved in sports from an early age. His father had been a good curler and was once point skip of the Ottawa Curling Club, and both Hod and Bruce played hockey from a young age, often for the same teams. Stuart also played rugby and football, and played for the local professional football team, the Ottawa Rough Riders.\n\nOutside of hockey Stuart worked as a bricklayer, and later in his life he also worked with his father in construction. He was said to have been a quiet person, and unlike other athletes of his era was not one to talk about his exploits, except with close friends. Loughlin, his wife, came from Quebec; around 1903 they were married and had two children together.\n\nPlaying career[]\n\nStuart first joined a senior hockey team when he spent the winter of 1895–1896 with the Rat Portage Thistles, a team in northwestern Ontario. Along with his brother Bruce, Stuart joined the Ottawa Hockey Club of the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL) for the 1899 season. He played the 1900 season for Ottawa, captaining the team. Through his father's business contacts, Stuart got a job in Quebec and moved there in 1900; upon arriving there he joined the Quebec Bulldogs, also of the CAHL. He scored seven goals in fifteen games with the team over the next two seasons.[12]\n\nIn 1902, the Pittsburgh Bankers of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League signed Stuart to a professional contract; this was disputed between the Bankers and the Pittsburgh Victorias, who also claimed him. Eventually the Bankers won the dispute and kept Stuart; the following year they would also sign Bruce.[12] Stuart was offered a salary of US$15–20 per week, plus steady income from a day job in Pittsburgh.[14] Stuart scored seven goals and had eight assists and was named the best cover-point in the league in 1903.[15]\n\nAfter one season in Pittsburgh, Stuart moved to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club, a team in northern Michigan, for the 1903–1904 season and played in fourteen exhibition games, finishing fourth on the team with thirteen goals scored.[16] With the formation of the International Professional Hockey League, Stuart left Portage Lake for the Calumet Miners, where he accepted the positions of coach and manager, in addition to playing cover-point, for $1,800.[4] He scored eighteen goals for Calumet in 1904–1905, helped the team with the league championship and was named to the end of season all-star team as the best cover-point in the league.[15]\n\nOn December 11, 1905, before the start of the 1905–06 season, Stuart was suspended from the league after the western teams complained that he had won too many championships and was too rough for the league. He was reinstated by the league on December 30, and joined the Pittsburgh Professionals. After Pittsburgh finished their season, Stuart joined Calumet for one game so they could try to win the league championship, which they lost to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club. Once again he was named best cover-point in the IPHL as he scored eleven goals.[15] A big man with a fluid skating stride, he was considered the finest defenceman of his era for his outstanding play on both offence and defence.\n\nAs the IPHL convinced players to move to the United States and get paid to play, hockey teams in Canada were forced to match the salaries in order to keep their players. Stuart, who was unhappy playing in Pittsburgh because of the violence involved in games, heard from Dickie Boon that the Montreal Wanderers, defending Stanley Cup winners, of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) were willing to make Stuart the highest paid player in hockey if he were to join the team. On December 13, 1906, Stuart had a letter published in the Montreal Star that detailed his problems with the IPHL. Stuart's chief concern was the officiating; he said they \"don't know how to run hockey over here, the rink people appoint the most dumb and incompetent referees that could be found.\" In December 1906 Pittsburgh refused to play a game against Michigan Soo, claiming they did not like the choice of referee. While a common problem in the IPHL, Pittsburgh's management believed Stuart was behind the action, and released him from the team.[22] No longer bound to any team, Stuart joined the Wanderers; his first game with the team was watched by 6,069 fans.[23] He took part in the Wanderers' Stanley Cup challenge against the New Glasgow Cubs, a team from Nova Scotia, on December 27 and 29, 1906, and along with teammates Riley Hern, Frank Glass, Moose Johnson and Jack Marshall, became the first professional hockey players to compete for the Stanley Cup.[24]\n\n\"They could not offer me money enough here to go through what I went through last year in this league. Everybody had a slur at me and I could not lift my stick off the ice. That is a fact. I never took my stick off the ice, except in shooting, all winter, and never checked a man with the stick.\"\n\nExcerpt from letter written by Stuart to the Montreal Star on December 13, 1906 detailing his issues with the IPHL.\n\nStuart did not escape violence in the ECAHA. On January 12, 1907, the Wanderers faced the Ottawa Senators, a game the Wanderers ultimately won 4–2. Charles Spittal of Ottawa was described as \"attempting to split Cecil Blachford's skull\", Alf Smith hit Stuart \"across the temple with his stick, laying him out like a corpse\", and Harry Smith cracked his stick across Ernie \"Moose\" Johnson's face, breaking Johnson's nose.[25] Stuart was commended for his actions during the game; it was said that he neither flinched nor retaliated, even after bearing most of the hits. At a league meeting on January 18, the Montreal Victorias proposed suspending Spittal and Alf Smith for the season in response to their actions, but this was voted down and the president of the league, Fred McRobie, resigned.[25] The next time the Senators visited Montreal for a game, the police arrested Spittal, Alf and Harry Smith, leading to $20 fines for Spittal and Alf, and an acquittal for Harry.[25] Even with the persistent violence, Stuart helped the Wanderers to an undefeated season; they then accepted a challenge from the Kenora Thistles for the Stanley Cup. The Thistles won the series, held in January, but lost a rematch between the teams in March, giving the Cup back to the Wanderers.[26] Stuart participated in both challenges, and though did not score a goal in any of the four games, he was said to have played the best game of his career in the first game of the series, even with a broken finger. Regarded as the most important player on the Wanderers, Stuart was said to know how to play every position on the ice, and passed his knowledge of the game onto his teammates.\n\nDeath[]\n\nTired of the constant violence, Stuart quit hockey after the Stanley Cup championship in 1907 and joined his father in construction.[28] As part of this job, Stuart was sent to Belleville, Ontario, to oversee the building of the Belleville Drill Shed, one of his father's contracts. While in Belleville, he continued to receive offers to join a new hockey team. He was asked if he wanted to manage the Belleville team; a similar offer came from Peterborough, Ontario, while a town outside Toronto was said to have offered a railroad president's salary if Stuart would join them. On the afternoon of June 23, 1907, Stuart went to the Bay of Quinte, near Belleville, to swim with some friends. Stuart swam to the nearby lighthouse, about half a kilometre away from his group, climbed onto a platform and dived into the shallow water. He dived head first onto jagged rocks, gashing his head and breaking his neck. He was killed instantly.[30] His body was brought back to Ottawa, where a service was held at his family's home before he was buried at Beechwood Cemetery.\n\nAll-star game[]\n\nTo raise money for Stuart's widow and two children, the ECAHA decided to host an all-star game, the first of its kind to be played in any sport.[1] An estimated 3,800 spectators attended the Hod Stuart Memorial Game on January 2, 1908, with tickets selling out days in advance.[31] Described by the Montreal Herald as \"unique in the history of hockey in Montreal, if not in the whole of Canada,\" the event featured the Montreal Wanderers, Stuart's former team, playing against a squad of top players from the other teams in the ECAHA.[2] The Westmount Arena agreed to host the event for no charge, and all proceeds from the game went to Stuart's family, totalling over $2,100.[32] Fans were asked to mail in choices of who should play on the all-star team, with the contest winners given two tickets to the game.[2] The Wanderers, an established team, played better than the All-Stars, who had to learn to play together, and led 7–1 after the first half of the game; though the All-Stars played better in the second half, the Wanderers won by a score of 10–7.[33]\n\nRoster[]\n\nWanderers (10)[34] Position All-Stars (7)[34] Riley Hern Goaltender Percy LeSueur (Ottawa) Art Ross Point Rod Kennedy (Victorias) Walter Smaill Cover-point Frank Patrick (Victorias) Frank Glass Rover Joe Power (Quebec) Ernie Russell Centre Grover Sargent (Montreal) Cecil Blachford Right Wing Eddie Hogan (Quebec) Ernie Johnson Left Wing Jack Marshall (Shamrocks)\n\nCareer statistics[]\n\nRegular season and playoffs[]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1898–99 Ottawa Hockey Club CAHL 3 1 0 1 — — — — — — 1899–00 Ottawa Hockey Club CAHL 7 5 0 5 — — — — — — 1900–01 Quebec Bulldogs CAHL 7 2 0 2 — — — — — — 1901–02 Quebec Bulldogs CAHL 8 5 0 5 — — — — — — 1902–03 Pittsburgh Bankers WPHL 13 7 8 15 29 4 1 2 3 2 1903–04 Portage Lakes Hockey Club Exhib. 14 13 0 13 23 9 4 0 4 12 1904–05 Calumet Miners IPHL 22 18 0 18 19 — — — — — 1905–06 Pittsburgh Professionals IPHL 20 11 0 11 50 — — — — — 1905–06 Calumet Miners IPHL 1 0 0 0 0 — — — — — 1906–07 Pittsburgh Professionals IPHL 4 1 3 4 19 — — — — — 1906–07 Montreal Wanderers ECAHA 8 3 0 3 21 4 0 0 0 8 CAHL totals 25 13 0 13 — — — — — — WPHL totals 13 7 8 15 29 4 1 2 3 2 IPHL totals 47 30 3 33 88 — — — — — ECAHA totals 8 3 0 3 21 4 0 0 0 8\n\n*Playing stats from Total Hockey[15]\n\nAwards[]\n\nWPHL[]\n\nAward Year(s) First All-Star Team 1903\n\nIPHL[]\n\nAward Year(s) First All-Star Team 1905, 1906\n\n*Awards from Total Hockey[15]\n\nPreceded by\n\nHarvey Pulford Ottawa Senators captain\n\n(Original Era)\n\n1899–1900 Succeeded by\n\nHarvey Pulford\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of ice hockey players who died during their playing career\n\nNotes[]\n\nBibliography[]\n\n[]"
