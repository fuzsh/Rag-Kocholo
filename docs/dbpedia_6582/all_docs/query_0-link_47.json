The insoluble uncertainties of the future are 1564 THE CHRONICLE always enough to make men careful of commitments far ahead; add to these the continual menace of more interfering statutes, and the natural result is to discourage all operations beyond those from hand to mouth. Confidence and hope are the soil in which business extension springs; anxiety and uncertainty repress it. This is so fundamental that we almost hesitate to say it; yet our politicians show no realization of it whatever. One prominent Chicago merchant puts the situation well in saying that he believes \"the vital organs of the country are in excellent condition,\" but business is suffering under nervous prostration, caused by the destructive attitude of governing bodies, as shown cumulatively now by the so-called anti-trust bills that overhang. The annual convention this week of the National Association of Manufacturers adopted resolutions declaring that \"hostility to business must stop.\" We solemnly protest (said these men) \"against continuous assault on our established industries; we affirm our conviction that unless there is a cessation of hostility to legitimate business the vitality of our commerce and trade will be critically impaired.\" Specifically, they declared themselves opposed to the passage of the pending Clayton bill, H. R. bill 15,657. Is it unreasonable that business asks to be let alone long enough to draw a free breath and try to adjust itself to the statutes already bound about it? Our foreign export trade touched a comparatively low level for the time of year in April 1914, the value of the merchandise shipped hence having been only a little over 162 million dollars, or some 373/ millions less than for the month in 1913 and also well below 1912. Moreover, this year's April aggregate was with one exception the smallest for any month since July 1912, a somewhat anomalous occurrence. Coincidently with this drop in exports, too, there was a marked augmentation in imports as contrasted with a year ago-263/ million dollars, in fact— leaving a balance against us (an import balance) of over 10 millions and reducing the export balance for the 10 months of 1912-13 to a total lower than since 1909-10. As in March, there was a decided contraction in breadstuffs shipments in April, the combined outflow of the cereals classed under that head having been less than 8M millions against over 153/i millions last year, with the loss largely, if not wholly, in corn and wheat. Provisions, too, fell off nearly 2 millions, mainly in pork products, and a considerable diminution in the outflow of cottonseed oil is to be noted. Furthermore, following the comparatively free outward movement earlier in the season, cotton exhibited a large shrinkage. These various declines were offset to only a very moderate extent by an enlarged export of mineral oils and cattle, so that for all the articles enumerated the April total this year was only 583 millions, against 753/ millions in 1913 and 697 4 millions in 1912. Other commodities—manufactures' &c.—also went out in restricted volume this year, showing a decline of 20 millions from last year. The total value of the merchandise exported in April was $162,368,852, against $199,813,438 in 1913 and $179,300,342 in 1912. For the ten months of the fiscal year the export aggregate was also less than for the like period of 1912-13, but exceeded by a good margin that of • 1911-12, the results having been $2,045,590,767 [VoL. xcvm. and $2,107,871,811 and $1,890,708,609, respectively. The decrease from a year ago is accounted for in greatest measure by breadstuffs, and iron and steel and manufactures, although many other articles of importance in our outward trade contributed more or less to the falling off. Merchandise imports in April were of very full volume; constituting a new high record for that period and setting a mark surpassed by only three months in our history—Oct. 1912, Dec. 1913 and March 1914. Specifically they were $172,640,724, against $146,194,461 in 1913 and $162,571,159 in 1912. For the ten months since July 1 1913 the total at $1,571,038,644 also establishes a high mark, exceeding by 23 millions the 1912-13 aggregate. The import balance for April reached $10,271,872, this contrasting with a net of $53,618,977 on the other side of the account in 1913, and for the ten months of 1913-14 exports exceeded imports by only $474,371,465, compared with almost 560 millions in 1912-13, over 524 millions in 1911-12 and no less than 6313/b millions in 1907-08. The gold movement was of no great importance in April 1914, the inflow having totaled $3,462,174 and the outflow $447,386, making our gain of the precious metal $3,014,788 and increasing to $13,616,143 the net imports for the ten months of the current fiscal year. This compares with a net export of $3,480,024 for the period of 1912-13 and $5,727,462 in 1911-12. A spirit of optimism, somewhat out of consonance with prevailing conditions in the general commercial and industrial affairs of the United States, seemed to pervade the nineteenth annual convention of the National Association of Manufacturers held at the Waldorf-Astoria on May 19 and 20. This was especially apparent in remarks made by leading members of the Association outside of the regular proceedings of the convention and found concrete expression in the words of Mr. George Pope, the President, in whose opinion the end of the period of readjustment to meet changed conditions is near. The country, he said, has not had time to adjust itself to the new tariff and must be given a chance. One of the encouraging factors in the situation, he thought, is that factories have not accumulated much stock, so that any increase in demand will have an immediate effect in a resumption of activities. In his formal address to the convention Mr. Pope, referring to the cordial relations existing between employers and employee a few years ago, assumed the unrest now—increasing as time passes—to be due to the passage of laws which, intended for the bettering of working conditions, are the breeders of class consciousness and have debased the spirit of individual initiative and merit .under the guise of social welfare. Mr. Pope spoke in favor of one doctrine for labor and capital, characterized as false the claim that the manufacturers are fighting labor and voiced the need of trade education in the public schools of the country. Wednesday was devoted to a general discussion of present business conditions and state of unemployment throughout the country and the legislative situation as it affects industry and foreign trade. The \"trust bills\" and other legislative hostility toward business interests were, as noted above, vigorously denounced.

Thus it is evident that Huerta is being gradually hemmed in and the critical stage of the situation, so far as the Huerta forces are concerned, is at hand. Meanwhile, a considerable degree of tension arose, owing to the disappearance of John R. Silliman, American ViceConsul at Saltillo. Yesterday's advices, however, state that Mr. Silliman has arrived safely at Mexico City. The State Department has not yet received the official explanation it has demanded of the death of Private Samuel Parks of the 28th Infantry, who is said to have been executed by Federal soldiers outside of Vera Cruz. Secrecy, as is usual in such cases, has marked the sessions of the Mediation Conference that has begun its work at Niagara Falls. The conferences have been thus far more or less informal. It was definitely reported early in the week that Huerta had authorized the Mexican representatives to tender his resignation if they found that such action would being about peace. Later Huerta himself denied that such power had been vested in his delegates. The three South American mediators on Wednesday evening had an informal conference with the American commissioners and on Thursday had a similar conference with the Mexican delegates. No formal expression of views was requested but the mediators suggested hypothetical steps looking to a settlement of the troubles in order to learn the trend of thought. It will be several days, it is understood, before a definite and comprehensive plan will be submitted for the formal consideration of either side. A new feature was, on Thursday, introduced into the mediation situation by the news that General Carranza, the head of the Constitutionalist movement had decided to send an emissary to Niagra Falls. At first, at least, the duty of the Constitutionalist agent will be simply to observe and report, but not to take part in the discussion. In Administration circles in Washington the hope is expressed that this move will eventuate in General Carranza becoming a party to the conference. Selling by Russia has this week been an unsettling influence in the London market for securities as well as in Paris and Berlin. Advices from St. Petersburg have indicated a highly unsettled condition of affairs at that centre, and Russian industrial securities have particularly been under pressure. On Saturday last they were exceptionally weak, and reports of financial failures were so persistent that the Russian Minister of Finance considered it desirable to call a conference of bankers to assure them that the rumors were groundless. It was also reported that the Russian Minister had withdrawn support from certain prominent Russian bankers. Very little increase in activity is expected now in the English market until after the Whitsuntide holidays, which begin at the close of business on May 29 on the London Stock Exchange and continue until Tuesday morning, June 2. Money on the London market has shown increasing firmness during the week and closed yesterday at 23/2@2%% for day-to-day commitments, which compares with 1%@23% a week ago. Private discounts, too, have risen to the official Bank rate [VOL. xcviii. of 3%, so that there is slight probability of a decline in the Bank of England rate in the near future. An advance would not be surprising. For the first time in a month the Bank on Tuesday succeeded in securing a part of the regular weekly offering of new South African bars, taking £600,000 out of the total offering of £800,000, there being no demand from the Continent. India secured the remaining L200,000. The Continental exchanges are, in fact, ruling in favor of London, so that there is hardly reason to believe that the current monetary stringency at the British centre will prove lasting. English underwriters have again begun to test the power of absorption of the British investment market. A £1,000,000 43/2% loan of the Province of Alberta was offered on Tuesday and was more than subscribed. On Monday the £3,000,000 4% loan of the New South Wales Government was announced. The offering price was 99, but the cable has not thus far given details of the volume of subscriptions.. The previous issue by the New South Wales Government in August last comprised £1,500,000 and was offered at 9732. The City of South Vancouver has placed a small issue of three months' bills on a 43 2% basis. / Quite a sensation is reported to have been caused by the offering for Mexico of £700,000 of 6% trust certificates at 82. These certificates, according to the prospectus, are secured by a portion of the unissued balance of 6% ten-year Mexican Treasury bonds, of which £6,000,000 were offered last June by international houses, including J. P. Morgan & Co. and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. It has been publicly stated in London this week by Morgan, Grenfell & Co., as a result of this new offering, that the international syndicate still has an option on the said balance of Treasury bonds, no consent having been given by the syndicate to any negotiation of these securities, which are now slated as collateral for the present issue of certificates. The financial unsettlement which it was hoped had been finally adjusted by the formation of an important syndicate to take control of the securities of an important speculator has, unfortunately, not ended. This speculator, it will be recalled, suffered heavy losses, chiefly by reason of the declines in Canadian securities. London cable dispatches now give the name of Arthur Morton Grenfell as the speculator in question, this information having become public through a formal announcement by Chaplin, Milore, Grenfell & Co. that Mr. Grenfell had on February 17 ceased to be a director of that house. It is feared that the syndicate salvage scheme may not prove entirely successful, as one creditor of Grenfell who agreed to be a member of the syndicate, taking over the latter's securities, is unable to take up his proportion of the stock involved. It is also reported by cable that another firm—of minor importance—is in difficulties. But neither the name of this firm nor the name of the member of the salvage syndicate has been publicly mentioned. British consols in the London market closed last evening, as reported by cable, at 7432, against 74 15-16 a week ago. London & Northwestern Ry. finished at 12831, against 1309; Great Western at 3 1, against 114%, and Great Eastern at 489., 113/ against 503. Japanese 4s still remain at 7732; Bulgarian 6s at 102, Russian 4s at 87, while Servian unified 4s are 2 points lower at 773 2. Mexican Gov/ ernment 5s have not changed from 84, but Mexican MAY 231914.] THE CHRONICLE Ry. ordinary shares have advanced during the week to 32 from 303/2, showing a favorable interpretation of Mexican prospects. German Imperial 3s are without alteration from 76. Advices from Paris are rather more assuring. The Bourse was closed on Thursday, Ascension Day. Early in the week the French centre was also disturbed by the adverse developments in St. Petersburg, to which we have referred in our remarks upon the London situation. There has recently been open intervention by the French banks in an attempt to restore confidence at the French centre. Advices received in this city by mail from Paris, for instance, state that M. Boissiere, the new Director of the Ottoman Bank, went personally into the market on Friday, May 8, to buy Turkish Government securities. He was followed by M. Turettini (Director of the Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas), who attended the Bourse in person—an incident unprecedented for many years—and was a heavy buyer of French Rentes and of the securities in which his bank is particularly interested. Cable advices state the effect of this intervention was momentary. The fact that the Government is to issue at as early a date as possible a loan to restore the budget is considered a favoring omen. Correspondents differ in their estimates as to the size of this offering, though they appear to agree that it will not be below 400,000,000 francs; the highest estimate is 2,000,000,000 francs. The loan will not be in the form of perpetual Rentes. It will pay either 39.% or 4%—the exact rate, as is customary in Paris, not being officially announced until the offering is formally made. The shares of French banks have this week been subjected to some pressure, as a result, quoting the special correspondent of the \"Journal of Commerce,\" of \"a scandalous campaign that is being waged against the bank and credit institutions in the form of scurrilous pamphlets, which are being distributed in every possible way. These pamphlets are actually causing withdrawals of deposits by people who fear for the solvency of the institutions.\" The correspondent learned that directors of several of the financial institutions have held special meetings in respect to these pamphlets, and it is considered not improbable that definite action to punish those responsible for their circulation will be taken. The fact that a national loan is among the early probabilities is regarded a constructive feature by the Bourse, on the ground that such a loan could not be allowed to be a qualified success, and all the leading banks are under obligation to insure its proper distribution. French Rentes closed last evening at 86.10 francs, against 86.75 francs a week ago. Money in Paris finished at 23/2%, against 2% on Friday of last week. There are reports that M. Renault, Minister of Finance, is disinclined to face the criticism which will be leveled at him when Parliament meets and is trying to persuade his colleagues that the part of wisdom is to resign at once rather than be turned out. Cable despatches state, however, that there is no probability of this suggestion being acted upon by Premier Doumergue. The Berlin market, too, was adversely affected early in the week by the Russian unsettlement and selling of securities for Russian account. The redemption on Friday of last week of 50,000,000 marks in Prussian Treasury notes eased the money situa 1567 tion. The refusal of Paris banks to finance speculstive accounts in Russian securities encouraged selling of these stocks on the German market. Steamship shares were depresesd by prospects of further tension between the German and English shipping lines. More than one hundred members of private German banking firms recently met at Berlin and formed an association which will endeavor to represent the common interest of the concerns which still retain their independence of the great banking amalgamations. The recent absorptions by the Deutsche Bank and the Disconto-Gesellschaft, respectively, seem to have created considerable of a scare. The process of bank amalgamation in Germany is quite peculiar because the banks carry all descriptions of business besides that of specific banking. They are, for instance, the great credit agencies, and they also tend more and more to be great investment agencies dealing directly with their customers instead of through the Stock Exchanges. The German Government has rejected the protests of Russia, France, Belgium and Holland regarding the taxing of their nationals who are resident in Germany under the special tax. The Government takes the ground that it is not a \"war tax,\" in violation of commercial treaties, but is merely a \"contribution.\" It is stated officially that the Krupp family and firm ‘vill contribute $2,151,750 of the tax. The session of the Reichstag ended on Thursday without any action being taken on the bill to create a Government petroleum monopoly and to expel the Standard Oil Company from the country. A special committee which had the matter under consideration reported that it could not make sufficient progress to justify the submission of the measure to the Reichstag for the first reading and vote. Nothing, therefore, can now be done in respect to this matter until next November, when the Reichstag will re-assemble. The Berlin Bourse was closed on Thursday, Ascension Day. Money in Berlin yesterday, as reported by cable, was2@23/2%, which compares with 23/2% a week ago. Official European bank rates have not been altered this week. The Bank of Bombay, however, on Thursday reduced its rate 1% to 5%. In Lombard Street private bank rates rose to 3%, the official Bank rate, for both long and short bills, on Thursday, but closed easier yesterday at 2 15-16@3% for 60-day bills and 2%@2 15-16%for 90-day acceptances, comparing with TN% for both classes of bills 4% remains the private bank a week ago. In Paris 23 4% is the quotation, being an rate, while in Berlin 25 advance of A% for the week. Vienna remains at 3%, Brussels at 331% and Amsterdam at 2 15-16%. Official rates at the leading foreign centres are: London, 3%; Paris, 33/2%; Berlin, 4%; Vienna, 4%; Brussels, 4%; Amsterdam, 33/2%. As already stated, the Bank of England,for the first time in a month,succeeded in securing some of the new Cape gold bars at the weekly offering in London. It received £600,000, but this will not show in the Bank's bullion holdings until next week. Nevertheless, the current return by Threadneedle Street records an increase in gold coin and bullion holdings of £140,183. The reserve indicated a corresponding increase of £167,000 and the proportion of reserve to liabilities is now 43.60%, against 44.51% last week and 50.75% a year ago. An increase of $898,000 in public deposits was recorded and of 1568 THE CHRONICLE $682,000 in other deposits. The loan item (other securities) shows the large increase of £1,435,000. It is rather difficult to suggest a cause for this large increase. The bullion holdings are well below those of recent years. They amount to only £35,946,635, against £37,706,963 one year ago and £40,036,726 in 1912. The reserve aggregates £25,720,000. One year ago it was £27,776,473 and two years ago £29,602,376. The loans now register £39,891,000, as against £31,881,039 in 1913 and £31,718,980 in 1912. Our special correspondent furnishes the following details by cable of the gold movement into and out of the Bank for the Bank week: Imports, £101,000 (of which £85,000 from Brazil and £16,000 bought in the open market); exports, £150,000 (of which £50,000 to Scandinavia and £100,000 earmarked East Indian gold standard), and receipts of £189,000 net from the interior of Great Britain. The Bank of France published its weekly statement on Friday—Thursday, Ascension Day, having been observed as a holiday at the French centre. The Bank's holdings of gold increased 25,713,000 francs and its silver holdings were 4,104,000 francs higher. General deposits increased 36,072,000 francs and Treasury deposits expanded 16,137,000 francs. There was a contraction of 52,308,000 francs in note circulation and of the large sum of 65,528,000 francs in discounts. The Bank's holdings of gold now amount to 3,700,038,000 francs, against.3,279,300,000 francs one year ago and 3,258,250,000 francs in 1912. Its silver stands at 633,529,000 francs, against 613,700,000 francs one year ago and 814,000,000 francs in 1912. Circulation aggregates 5,791,906,000 francs, against 5,504,470,190 in 1913 and 5,161,017,075 francs in 1912. Discounts are 1,369,597,000 francs. In 1913 at this date they were 1,623,518,419 francs and in 1912 1,240,854,599 francs The weekly statement of the Imperial Bank of Germany, issued on Monday, was a strong one in virtually all its items. The gold on hand increased 15,904,000 marks, and the total cash, including gold, showed an expansion of 30,331,000 marks. There was an increase in deposits of 103,935,000 marks and of 17,858,000 marks in treasury bills. Meanwhile a contraction of 95,354,000 marks took place in note circulation, of 7,073,000 marks in loans and of 34,813,000 marks in discounts. The cash holdings now amount to 1,699,246,000 marks; one year ago the total was 1,302,760,000 marks and in 1912 1,264,300,000 marks. Loans and discounts make favorable comparisons with earlier years, the total of these two items being 888,268,000 marks, against 1,248,620,000 marks one year ago and 1,100,100,000 marks in 1912. The item of circulation stands at 2,011,099,000 marks. This is an increase from 1,849,720,000 marks in 1913 and 1,617,820,000 marks the year preceding. The local market for money showed a rather firmer tone during the earlier days of the week, and rates were fractionally advanced. A return to an easier position became evident during the closing days, however, and, while asking rates were still nominally above those of a week ago, it is doubtful whether borrowers, if they insisted on obtaining the very lowest quotations, would be compelled to pay higher figures than those current at the close of business [VOL. xcvm. a week ago. An engagement of $4,000,000 gold was announced by Goldman, Sachs & Co. for Paris, $3,500,000 of which was in the form of gold coin, the remainder being bars, which confirms our statement of last week that the supply of gold bars available for export in the local market was becoming exhausted. Last Saturday's bank statement was somewhat below expectations, there having been a decrease of $1,977,550 in the cash surplus above reserve requirements. This, however, was due entirely to the increase in the amount of reserve ($5,456,550) required by an expansion of $26,933,000 in deposits. The actual cash reserve in the vaults of the banks and trust companies increased $3,479,000 and the cash surplus above requirements now stands at $39,706,100, which compares with $25,579,400 one year ago and with $20,902,500 in 1912. Loans during the week increased $22,723,000. The banks in the Clearing House reported an increase of $7,130,000 and the trust companies a decrease of $3,651,000 in cash in vaults and of $6,376,000 in cash in banks. Among the new calls in sight upon the money market during the next few weeks are the income-tax payments, bills for which have just been sent out by the Internal Revenue collectors, and all of which must be paid by June 30. In addition the subscriptions of the national and such State banks as have elected to participate in the Federal reserve system will not unnaturally enter into the immediate calculations of bank managers. On the other hand, the fact that practical efforts are under way to inaugurate the new banking system, is an influence that is reassuring, since it permits the banks to depend upon ample supplies of funds being available from rediscounts as soon as the regional banks are in practical working order. The idea still prevails in large measure in representative banking circles in this city that the development of the regional bank system will be a matter of very gradual progress unless a war or other specific influence should become an immediate factor. Commercial paper, for instance, will have to be created which will involve changes in business methods. These changes, unless direct necessity for them should be found in inability to obtain sufficient supplies of funds, are likely to be resisted by manufacturers and distributers. There is always antipathy to adopting new forms of business procedure unless corresponding advantages are .apparent. The only advantage that could accrue would be ability to borrow at decidedly lower rates of interest. Under current conditions the question of rates does not appear to be an important one, and there will, it is expected, be inducement to do business as long as practicable under the old conditions. Manufacturers and wholesale distributers to-day sell their products at specific discounts for cash in fixed periods. It will take some time for this system to give way to a substitute one such as is contemplated in the foreign interpretation of commercial bills. There is some disposition to regard notes whose proceeds are utilized to pay for merchandise (without such merchandise being the direct consideration of the note), as commercial paper within the meaning of the new law. This, however, is a matter that in due course will be officially ruled upon. There have been no specifjc developments in the Mexican situation to suggest that the Government is to enter the market as a borrower in the immediate future. Our bank executives are, how- MAY 23 19141 ever, keenly alert to any indication of a change in this direction, as it is recognized that the failure of mediation and the beginning of a strong campaign by our Government in Mexico will of necessity cause a sudden change in the fundamental position of the money market. But the prevailing attitude of bank officers in connection with the Mexican outlook, is that final pacification is still a matter for the particularly remote future, since even should agreement be reached with Huerta,there is,obviously, slight probability of inducing the Constitutionalist troops, elated as they are with their recent victories, to stop short of real conquest. There have been no exceptionally important demands upon the capital market on behalf of corporations this week. The Missouri Pacific has $25,000,000 in notes maturing on June 1 which it is endeavoring to induce the holders thereof to extend for one year at a higher rate of interest. Referring to call money rates in detail, the highest figure each day of the week has been 2%, while,'with the exception of a 13/2% minimum on Wednesday, the lowest figure each day has been 1%%. On Monday the ruling rate was 13'%, on Tuesday 2% and on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday 19%. For time money closing quotations were 23/2% for 60 days (against 234@23/2% a week ago), 23/2% for 90 days (against 23'1%), 2%@3% for four months (unchanged), 3% for five months (unchanged) and 3% for six months (against 3@33'%). Commercial paper remains at 3%@4% for 60 and 90-day endorsed bills receivable and for four to six months' single names of choice character. Names less favorably known still require 431@4%%. Sterling exchange has displayed active strength. This is not unnatural in view of the distinct strain in the money situation reported from London, where day-to-day funds are quoted at 23'@2%% and private bank rates on Thursday reached the Bank's minimum of 3%. Under these circumstances there is a disposition to expect gold shipments to London on quite a large scale. Goldman,Sachs & Co.forwarded $2,000,000 in gold coin by Wednesday's steamer to Paris. Yesterday, Friday, they engaged an additional $2,000,000 to go by to-day's steamer, $1,500,000 being in coin and $500,000 in bars. The monthly report from Washington of the foreign trade movement for the month of April suggests the necessity of an outward movement of the precious metal to settle balances due abroad. The excess of imports of merchandise over exports for the month of April was $10,200,000. For the corresponding month a year ago an excess of exports of $53,600,000 was shown. This, however, is merely a partial indication of the so-called \"trade balance.\" Many other items enter into consideration on the adverse side. They are so well known that it is unnecessary to reiterate them at this particular time. It is agreed in sterling exchange circles that the present outflow of the precious metal is due to the fact that balances exist abroad and as creditors are calling for settlement, payment must be made. The Continental exchanges are ruling strongly in favor of London. Sterling checks at Paris closed last evening at 29.193' francs, which represents a further advance of 32 centime for the week; and in Berlin the London check rate finished at 20.50 marks, against 20.483/2 marks a week ago. Sterling exchange in Amsterdam, as reported by cable last 1569 THE CHRONICLE evening, closed at 12.303/ guilders, against 12.1134 guilders on Friday of last week. Berlin exchange in Paris finished at 122.85 francs, against 122.90 francs a week ago. Mexican exchange on New York closed at 290 and on London at is. 4Y 1d., which figures are without net change for the week. New :York exchange on Mexico also remains without change at 35. Compared with Friday of last week, sterling exchange on Saturday was slightly easier for demand and cable transfers, which declined to 4 8820@4 8830 and 4 8860@4 8870, respectively; sixty days remained unchanged at 4 8535@4 8560. On Monday the opening was weak but subsequently there was a rally, cables closing at 4 8875 and demand at 4 8840; the range for the day was 4 8825@4 8840 for demand, 4 8855@4 8875 for cable transfers and 4 8550®4 8575 for sixty days; light offerings and a good demand proved the chief stimulus. Despite some weakness in the early transactions on Tuesday, the continued scarcity of commercial bills induced further advances, and demand moved up to 4 8830®4 8845 and cable transfers to 4 8870@4 8885; sixty days was still held at 4 8550@4 8575. On Wednesday the upward movement was resumed; renewed stiffening in European discount rates caused a rise of 10®15 points in demand and cables, establishing another new high record; demand ranged at 4 8845@4 8855, cable transfers at 4 8890@4 89 and sixty days at 4 8560@4 8575. Increasing scarcity of commercial offerings, coupled with an active inquiry and firm discounts in Europe, occasioned an additional advance of 10 points in sterling on Thursday to 4 8855@4 8865 for demand, 4 89@4 8910 for cable transfers and 4 8585@4 86 for sixty days. On Friday the market was slightly reactionary after an additional engagement of $2,000,000 gold was announced for Paris. Closing quotations were 4 8585@4 86 for sixty days, 4 8850®4 8860 for demand and 4 8890®4 89 for cable transfers. Com2@4 853,documercial on banks closed at 4 843/ ments for payment finished at 4 85@4 86%, and seven-day grain bills at 4 879'@4 87%. Cotton for payment closed at 4 853@4 853/2, grain for payment 4 863/s@4 86%. The New York Clearing-House banks,in their operations with interior banking institutions, have gained $9,554,000 net in cash as a result of the currency movements for the week ending May 22. Their receipts from the interior have aggregated $15,154,000 while the shipments have reached $5,600,000. Adding the Sub-Treasury operations and the gold exports, which together occasioned a loss of $6,246,000, the combined result of the flow of money into and out of the New York banks for the week appears to have been a gain of $3,308,000, as follows: Out of Banks.
