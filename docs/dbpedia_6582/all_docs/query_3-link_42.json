        "text": "“stumped. in stump v1. adj. (Originally U.S.). To cause to be at a loss; to confront with an insuperable difficulty; to nonplus\n\nThis is one of those moments when you just have to bash our a few words for no other reason than to vent. The Independent has reported that archaeologists are “stumped” by a wheel-like building complex at the Kastelli airport development in Crete. An enigmatic, evidently communal complex has been uncovered, whose exact purpose is not clear. It’s a very interesting find of Middle Minoan date, from a time when palatial civilisation was becoming a thing in the Minoan world. This has all sorts of connotations for the emergence of complex societies, where the rule of a central authority – later exemplified by the famous Minoan palaces – was become established. But the exact function of this building can’t be reconstructed from the finds currently available – and this, apparently, means that archaeologists are “stumped”.\n\nI realise at this point that I am the proverbial Old Man Yelling At A Cloud of Simpson’s meme fame, but I’m afraid this time the cloud is just going to have to suck it up. Archaeology is an incomplete, partial picture. Every discovery reforms and recalibrated our view of the past, which can never be whole. So the fact that the exact purpose of this structure is not clear, coming as it does from a pre-writing society with no surviving textual records, and whose administrative infrastructure we cannot reconstruct in any detail, does not mean that archaeologists are “stumped”. They are operating within the limitations of the evidence they have.\n\nNow, I am not familiar with the work of the journalist, Nicholas Paphitis. However if you read the article in full, you will see he has actually done a good job of reporting the Cretan archaeological authorities’ perspective, and the context of the find. What irks – being polite – is the headline, which draws an immediate and – ahaha – monolithic outline of that nuance, totally obliteraing it in the process. I am the son of two journalists, and know that a great way of really annoying one is to assume that they write, and are responsible for, their own headlines. The don’t and they aren’t. The headline writer has really done the issue a big disservice here.\n\nThere is a bigger point: a headline likes this feeds, in a tiny way, into a narrative that the past is somehow objective, and thus can be complete. If you are “stumped” then there has to be some rounded truth to which you do not have access. This lack of nuance, and the implied exclusion of uncertainty, enables the appropriation of past material culture for very, very unsavoury ends. Even with a throwaway headline on an otherwise well-written and apparently innocuous news piece, the mainstream media should not be contributing to this way of thinking.\n\nThank you for listening. The cloud has now drifted away.\n\nThis is not meant to be an overtly political intervention; this blog largely tries to steer clear of these altogether. However, the recent “Tories would swap ‘rip-off’ degrees for apprenticeships” issue in the British General Election has, in various forms, been such a staple of the entire quarter-century that I have spent in academia that I thought it was worth offering some thoughts on its latest iteration. It came up again last week in the context of the Election, with a government promise to fund up to 100,000 apprenticeships per year as alternative to poor-quality degrees, and to give our regulator, the Office for Students (OfS) greater powers to close down badly performing degrees. For the first time, graduate earnings are to be taken into account in such assessments. Both have very important policy implications for the HE sector.\n\nTo reiterate, conversations about the “quality” and “value” (monetary or otherwise) of degree programmes are not a new thing. “Mickey Mouse” degrees have been a target for certain sections of the media for as long as I can remember; for some reason, “Golf Course Management” sticks in my mind as a particularly totemic example of these, which was knocking around in my youth (I have no idea if any such programme has ever been offered by the way, or which institution or institutions were supposed to have done so). Since the turn of the century however, the number of students in UK HE has increased from around 1.9. to 2.8m, according to HESA figures. It is certainly the case that the range of subjects available to study has, for better or worse, expanded along with this increase; driven no doubt in part by a desire on the part of institutions to remain relevant to the societies they serve. Whether any of these are “Mickey Mouse” or not is surely a matter of subjective opinion, but the introducing term “rip-off” implies a more specific characteristic, as a poor financial return on financial investment.\n\nTwo questions are implied by the idea of “rip-off” degrees being offered by universities: firstly, how could any institution expect to get away with offering such a programme, even it if wanted to? From where I am sitting, the current UK landscape is not short of universities willing to take the pruning shears to their offerings in the face of financial pressures. There is more to it than financial viability however. Students are not fools. There are some parallels between choosing a degree programme and buying a house (which, incidentally, I am doing at the moment). House buyers “do their own research” these days, with a plethora of data available about house prices (both historic and current), amenities, transport links, environmental factors and so on. The choice of degree programmes faced by aspiring students is the same. Most institutions provide extensive data about their programmes and outcomes already (although it’s true that too many don’t), and as well as this we have countless university rankings and league tables, less formal forums such as the Student Room, as well the mass of nebulous networks on social media where students and aspiring students comminicate, all of which platform and broadcast student experiences. There is surely enough information out there for young people to make informed choices, and we should trust them to do so. And anyway, shouldn’t the free market rule?\n\nThis is of course not to deny that poor quality degrees exist, although whether they can survive the rigours of today’s academic environment in the long term is an altogether different question. However, just as there are good and bad degrees, there are also good and bad apprenticeships. One does not need to dig very far at all online to find horror stories, both from apprentices and their hosts. There also of course excellent apprenticeships which create experiences of long term value for those that do them. But to set them up as as a whole a panaceic answer to poor quality in their HE counterparts is comparing apples with oranges. The comparison is culture war at its most shallow.\n\nAs noted above, it is suggested that our regulator, the Office for Students, should be able to step in to close “failing” degrees which. As some have pointed out, the OfS more or less has powers to do anyway. But even so, political parties (of any hue) drawing the OfS into such narratives is helpful not for it, for the sector, or for the relationship between the two. Last year, the House of Lords report, Must do better: the Office for Students and the looming crisis facing higher education, concluded that:\n\nThe actions of the OfS and the prioritisation of its duties appear to be reactive and driven by political pressures and input. While there are a small number of cases where the OfS has pushed back against the Government’s view, in too many cases the OfS has translated ministerial and media attitudes directly into regulatory demands on providers.\n\nGiven the importance of trust between the sector and its regulator, involving them in this way can only exacerbate the fears of political pressure which the Lords articulated.\n\nFinally and most importantly: conflating the student experience and all that goes with it with the earnings graduates make on a degree by degree basis is both an oversimplification and a gross distortion of reality. Figures out this week show that students from the LSE are London’s highest earning graduates five years after finishing their degrees, with graduates of the Royal Veterinary College also being among the highest earners. In contrast the lowest earners are those of the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama, with the University of the Arts London and the Royal College of Music also languishing in the table. These figures are hardly astonishing surprises, and they say nothing whatsoever about the quality of the teaching on offer in any of the institutions in questions. The amount graduates can expect to earn on graduation is one of a vast range of factors, some to do with their personal situations others, as illustrated here, to do with the fact that (say) vets tend to earn more than musicians. That is not the fault of either students or universities. To suggest such a link, or that applicants are somehow being hoodwinked by poor teaching, is entirely tendentious.\n\nThe UK’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport has launched a consultation on ratifying the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage. Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) is, as the consultation acknowledges, a “mouthful”. It refers to a broad range of things done, usually in public spaces, which form part of our communities. Spectacles, events or processes that we instantly recognise, whose motifs, significance and practices we already know about collectively, and which thus form part of our community’s identity, are all examples of ICH – with “we” and “our” being used very advisedly. Think Morris dancing perhaps, or the Lord Mayor’s Parade in London, or a Salvation Army band. UNESCO’s Convention on ICH aims to afford safeguards to its manifestations, on the same level as it affords preservation and protection to World Heritage’s more familiar tangible expressions, such as Stonehenge, the Giant’s Causeway or Durham Cathedral. Drawing on UNESCO’s own definitions, the consultation defines Intangible Cultural Heritage as\n\n[T]he practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage.\n\nLater on, it speaks more succinctly of “Cultural heritage that is living and practised as opposed to material, fixed heritage.”\n\nThe “guiding principles” upon which the proposed ratification will take place are broad, and seem entirely reasonable, with a strong emphasis on inclusivity. They speak of ICH being community based and bottom up, of intercultural dialogue around cases of ICH that are both shared and not shared by different communities, while admitting that for ICH to exist at all it must carry a degree of “community recognition” (whatever that means). As Francis Young has pointed out, this could lead to problematic situations in cases where one item of ICH clearly forms part of one community’s identity, but which may at the same time represent ideologies which conflict with another’s – such as Northern Ireland’s fife and drum bands. The consultation – wisely in my view – steers clear of such conflicts by adopting what it calls a “lift not list” approach, which does not seek to elevate any items of ICH over others, or confer on any items any special status. It states that:\n\n[ICH] is different to World Heritage, partly in that it is far broader and more extensive, but importantly in that it has no exceptional universal value and is not necessarily original or unique. Judging which elements are more valuable or important than others is neither desirable or beneficial, nor is there any commonly agreed way of doing so.\n\nFailing to be ultra-responsive and ultra-inclusive would, at this early stage, surely doom the proposed ratification to failure, especially in such fractious and culturally-warlike times for the UK as these. The first stage will therefore be to create an all-encompassing “inventory” of ICH, which will not, at least at first, seek to accession any items to UNESCO’s own “definitive list”, which is far more definitive and exclusive. However, when the consultation gets to defining what it thinks should be included, the principles become so all-encompassing as to risk indeterminacy. It is simply stated that ICH should be “currently practiced” and is not a material object (an ethnically specific piece of food preparation equipment does not itself form part of ICH for example, but a culinary practice which uses it might), that it can come from any time, and can originate from anywhere. The proposed categories within these are drawn from the Convention itself:\n\noral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural heritage;\n\nperforming arts;\n\nsocial practices, rituals and festive events;\n\nknowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe;\n\ntraditional craftsmanship.\n\nTwo additional categories are proposed, traditional games and culinary traditions.\n\nIt is interesting, and perhaps a subject for another blogpost, to note that that digital networked practices, events, and knowledge are not mentioned at all. These potentially cut across all seven categories, and highlight the necessary role of networking, connection, and collaboration within communities in the production of ICH – the process by which information, understanding, knowledge is shared, and is this collectively formed. Mark Hedges and I observed similar processes in relation to the ways that academic crowdsourcing produce knowledge in in our 2017 book, Academic Crowdsourcing: Crowds, Communities and Co-Production. We noted:\n\n“The emergence … of more collaborative and co-productive forms of crowdsourcing in recent years has led to an increased focus both on community motivations, around the creation of benefits for the common good – to human knowledge or a cultural commons – and on a more profound engagement with the subject and closer involvement of contributors in designing and doing research”.\n\np 101\n\nOur main thesis in was that the “networked age” from the mid-2000s onwards, when the Web became truly interactive, brought about a new type of “cultural commons”, whereby academics and cultural professionals were able to do new forms of research, and create and curate new forms of knowledge, by collaborating with enthusiastically amateur (in the best possible sense of the term) members of the public. For “cultural commons” here, one can read ICH, and the ways in which it is produced through collaborative and co-productive means between practitioners and communities; and the way in which it functions as a social good. No doubt the bearing which the theory and practice of networked knowledge has on the relationship between practitioner and public will form a major part of the Convention’s implementation in the UK in the future.\n\nIn order to be all-encompassing and inclusive therefore, the consultation casts its net wide, and skims over any reference to the way that ICH is actually formed. The sharpest contrast in terms of what ICS is not is its comparison with tangible World Heritage, the “tangible” properties already listed by UNESCO. It is worth unpacking this distinction a little more.\n\nThe UNESCO World Heritage List (which defines properties that the consultation explicitly states are not ICH) divides its entries into the high-level categories of “Cultural”, “Natural” and “Mixed” – essentially, those which are created by human hands, those which are not, and combinations of the two. The vast majority of listings are human-made: of 33 listed properties in the UK, 28 are Cultural, four are Natural and only one is mixed. The first thing to note is that under both UNESCO’s definitions and the UK consultation, all ICH would correspond to the “Cultural” category. It is always human-made. It can be further noted that pretty much all of the 28 Cultural listings might be considered to be the result, whether directly or indirectly, of “elite” historical processes. Durham and Canterbury Cathedrals and Blenheim Palace are obvious examples of the former, as is the City of Bath. The Jodrell Bank Observatory is a manifestation of “elite” practice in a scientific rather than a religious or social sense. Similarly, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and Canal is an example of “elite” achievement in the domain of civil engineering – “a pioneering masterpiece of engineering and monumental metal architecture” according to the UNESCO listing. We may not have such a clear vision of the religious, social and architectural significance(s) of Stonehenge and Avebury as they appeared to those who built them, but we can be sure that they resulted from social complexity and hierarchy – some form of elite culture, even if it is one that we cannot access it directly.\n\nBy contrast, the ICH is none of these things. The UK consultation explicitly states that to be inventoried, items and practices of ICH must be “bottom up” and endorsed by their community. ICH derives its legitimacy from a shared embodiment at the local level, and not through validation by scientific, social, religious, engineering or architectural fame. Under the convention ICH will be “safeguarded”, not “preserved”, as physical World Heritage is. But this only serves to highlight that our approach to preserving “World Heritage” is to place it, metaphorically, behind glass, frozen in time and isolated from the world around it. This is in itself is a rather egocentric and monocultural view of World Heritage – privileging the way it appears to us, now, and excluding ways it might evolve in response to its environment over time (a property that is explicitly attached to ICH in the consultation). By banishing them, we in effect absolve ourselves of any responsibility for safeguarding the way in which a heritage monument changes dynamically over time. Recognising heritage’s contemporary importance and impact makes the stark distinction between ICH and World Heritage seem incongruous. As Hugh Thompson points out in The Green Road Into the Trees (2013), any Iron Age druids who might have used Stonehenge for their rituals are just as distinct from the monument’s original builders, and at the same time just as much part of its history, as the hippie celebrants who congregate there at the Summer Solstice in modern times. Under both UNESCO’s definitions and the proposed UK ratification, the hippie events and rituals would surely qualify as an item and practice of ICH. The may not have the same “exceptional universal value” as the Stonehenge itself; but to regard them (and the social-networked process which sustain them) as separate from the movement from the point of view of preserving and safeguarding it in the present day itself seems to make little sense.\n\nI believe that the UK consultation has struck the right tone in terms of setting principles and an agenda; and does a good job in framing the first steps towards ratification. Hopefully ratification will prove to be an impetus to ambitiously rethink the boundaries that an historic (and Westernized) view of heritage imposes on the distinction between the tangible and intangible, past and present, and safeguarding and preserving.\n\nThe idea of “Digital Folklore” has gained a cachet in recent years; much as “Digital Humanities” did from the mid-2000s, and as other “Digital” suffixes have more recently – such as Digital History, Digital Culture, Digital Art History, and so on. Given the intimate connection between folklore studies (especially via anthropology) with the humanities and the social and communications sciences, I am very pleased that we have the opportunity to host the Folklore Society’s annual conference at King’s, on the theme of “Digital Folklore”. The call for papers, which closes on 16th February 2024, is here.\n\nSome, but certainly not all, of the main issues with Digital Folklore group around the impact of algorithms on the transmission of traditions, stories, motifs and beliefs etc. These encourage us to look at those various Digital suffixes in new ways, both semantically and substantively. In framing the idea of “algorithmic culture” in 2015, Ted Striphas noted that:\n\n[T]he offloading of cultural work onto computers, databases and other types of digital technologies has prompted a reshuffling of some of the words most closely associated with culture, giving rise to new senses of the term that may be experientially available but have yet to be well named, documented or recorded.\n\nOne issue which this process of “offloading” of work onto computers highlights is that of agency, and the role of the algorithms which regulate our myriad relationships with “the digital” as agentive actors. This is a theme explored in the current issue of the journal Folklore by the digital culture theorist Guro Flinterud, in a paper entitled “‘Folk’ in the Age of Algorithms: Theorizing Folklore on Social Media Platforms”. In this piece, Flinterud observes that the algorithms which sort content on platforms such as X (Twitter as was) shape the behaviour of those contributing content to them by exerting a priori influence on which posts get widely circulated and which don’t. She views the algorithm as\n\na form of traditional folklore connector, recording and archiving the stories we present, but only choosing a select few to present to the larger public\n\n[451]\n\nHer argument about how the agency of objects drives the “entanglements of connective culture and folk culture, as it alerts us to how algorithmic technologies are actively present in our texts” speaks to what I have alluded to elsewhere as both the “old” and “new” schools of Digital Humanities.\n\nPersonally, I am greatly attracted to this idea of the algorithm as part of the folkloristic process. However, I am not sure it fully accounts for what Striphas calls the “privatisation of process” – that is black-boxification, the technical and programmatic structures of the algorithm hidden, along with the intent behind it, by the algorithm’s design and presentation from (or rather behind) a seamless user interface. I fully agree with both Striphas and Flinterud when they assert that one does not need a full technical understanding of the algorithm or algorithms to appreciate this; but the whole point of this “privatisation” is that it is private, hidden in the commercial black boxes of Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, etc – and serving those organisations’ commercial interests.\n\nBecause this information is proprietary, it is hard to trace the precise outline of these interests for individual organizations. It is, however, widely recognized (to the point of self- evidentness) that what they crave above all else is engagement. So long as the user-public is clicking, Tweeting, re-Tweeting, liking, friending and posting, then they are also looking at adverts. We are neurologically programmed to react more proactively to bad news than to good, so an algorithm in the service of multinationals will surely seek to expose its users to negative rather than positive stimuli. X/Twitter’s embrace of this truth will surely be written about a great deal over the next few years, but in the meantime let me illustrate it with personal experience. I was active on X/Twitter for a little more than a decade, between 2012 and 2021. In January 2022 I had an irrational fit of FOMO, and re-joined. Elon Musk acquired Twitter three months later, in April. I never had a big following there, and never made, or sought to make, a splash, Tweeting mostly about work, and very occasionally about politics or other personal ephemera. Then in September 2023 I Tweeted a throwaway observation about a current political issue – I will not repeat the Tweet or recount the issue here, as to do so would defeat the purpose of reflecting on the episode dispassionately – linking to a BBC News report. The Tweet got, by my low bar, traction. I started getting replies vigorously supporting my position, mostly from strangers, using language that went far beyond my original mildly phrased observation. I also started getting – in much lower volume – abuse, all of which (I’m glad to say) was from strangers.\n\nI realise that all this is entirely routine for many when navigating the digital landscape (including several friends and colleagues who have large online followings), and that my own gnat-bite of online controversy is as nothing in the context of the daily hellscape that X/Twitter has become especially, e.g., for women. However, it bought me to the abrupt realisation that I did not have the time, energy or temperament to carry in this environment. More relevant than that one episode however, it was emblematic of what X/Twitter had become: angry, confrontational and, for me, a lot less useful, informative and fun that it had been before. In particular I noticed that the “videos for you” feature, which promoted video content into my timeline, had taken on a distinctive habit: it was constantly “recommending” soliloquising videos by a certain UK politician – again I will name no names – whose stance and philosophy is the opposite of my own. So far as I can remember I never Tweeted at, or about, or mentioned, or even named this person in any of my Tweets; however, one could probably tell from my own postings that we were of radically different outlooks. One can only conclude therefore that X/Twitter’s algorithm identified my viewpoint, however abstractly, and was pushing this individual’s videos at me solely in order to upset and/or anger me – and thus to ensure my continued engagement with the platform; and that in my continued engagement, I kept looking at their advertisers’ advertisements.\n\nThis anecdote points, albeit similarly anecdotally, to another aspect of the “algorithm as folklore connector” model, which is that not all of the humans they interact with impact them equally in the age of the influencer or content creator. Like its mathematical model, the social media algorithm’s economic model remains black-boxed; but we can still follow the money. According to some estimates, then-President Donald Trump’s banishment from (then) Twitter following the Capitol riots in Washington DC in 2021 wiped $2.5bn off the company’s market value, mainly (I would guess) through the loss of the collective attention of his followers, and the platform’s ability to direct it to advertisements. Social media minnows (such as myself) are individually buffeted by these currents, and we can shape them only through loosely-bound collective action. Whales on the other hand make the currents.\n\nWe can trace the impact of a more specific narrative motif by continuing the marine analogy. Another whale is the author Graham Hancock, the author and journalist who has written extensively about the supposed demise of a worldwide ice age civilisation whose physical traces remain in the landscapes of Mesoamerica, Mesopotamia, and Egypt; an idea he promoted in his 2022 Netflix series, Ancient Apocalypse. Hancock’s strategy has been to establish himself as a “connector” outwith the conventional structures of scholarly publication, verification and peer-review – indeed, in direct opposition to them, portraying them as agents of conspiracy. “Archaeologists and their friends in the media are spitting nails about my Ancient Apocalypse series on Netflix and want me cancelled”, he Tweeted on 25th November. Without entering the debate as to the veracity of his ideas, there is no doubt he has played the role of “folklore connector” with great success, with Ancient Apocalypse garnering 25 million viewing hours in its first week. A powerful message delivered in a framing more akin to gladiatorial combat than the nuanced exchange of ideas that the academy is more used to.\n\nThe algorithm brings another angle which I hope might be explored in June: the presence of algorithms as characters in popular narratives, as well as, for better or for worse, propagators of them. One can reel off a list: The Terminator, Tron, The Matrix, War Games, Dr Strangelove … all the way back to the founding classic, Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, which deal with character-algorithms that take on agency in unexpected and unbenign ways. I strongly suspect that these films, and the dozens or hundreds like them, reflect existential fears about the world, political instability and, to one extent or another in the cases listed here, the Cold War and the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, and that the role that machines might “rise up” to play in it. This fear is a human constant: the fear of the machines in the twentieth century is the fear of the unknown and the unknowable, much like fear of AI in the twenty first; and, indeed, the fear of the darkness beyond the campfire. Folklore helps us to manage it, and understand it. I believe that folklore and the digital have far more in common than they might at first seem to have.\n\nI am adding to a canon here. The Swaledale Corpse path, which runs along the Swaledale Valley in the Yorkshire Dales from the area of Keld to Grinton, is already well blogged about – see here, here and here for just three examples. Probably because of this, it’s one I have wanted to do for a long time, and this week I got my chance. The story is the same as elsewhere: before the church at Muker was built, the deceased had to be carried up Swaledale for burial at St Andrew’s Church, Grinton. As denoted by the blogs, this path seems to have attracted particular interest and tales – including the the haunting of Ivelet Bridge by a headless black dog which was, it seems, a portent of death.\n\nI set off from Frith Lodge, a fabulous B&B a little north of Keld (just off the Pennine Way – very warmly recommended, Neil and Karen are perfect hosts). One needs to cut down and cross the river to get to the start of the walk, but this leads through the pleasant Rivendell-like landscapes of East Gill Force – all granite waterfalls and the swirling, beer-brown water of the Swale – to the notional start of the walk in Keld.\n\nSwaledale from Kisdon Fell\n\nHere, the corpse path briefly overlaps with the Pennine Way, which my late father walked in 1978. In the diary he kept, he said of this section:\n\nAfter the steep climb to Shunner [Fell, to the south] I wanted a rest and a smoke, so [his walking companions] went on again soon disappearing into the most ferocious gale we’d so far experienced. The cloud was racing by at 70 to 80 mph and you had to lean hard over to keep you balance. Cairns, which had seemed ridiculously close when we’d crossed Shunner in fine weather were now a vital supplement to the track of earlier boot-prints. The wind roared by like an express train in a tunnel – an invisible though powerful presence. I started singing a marching song.\n\nThe next day however, the weather had looked up:\n\nI climbed up to Keld with cuckoos in the valley hundreds of feet below. Heavy rain in the night made the going tough (well, sploshy). Past the Tan Hill Inn — lunched in Sleightholm Moor grouse shooters’ shelter (same one as two years ago), then just waded across the morass, perfectly happy in a cathedral of solitude with grouse raising gooseflesh by rocketing away from my feet.\n\nOne’s first encounter on the bath heading east is Kisdon Fell. Taking documentation on yorkshiredales.org.uk, which describes the corpse road between Keld and Muker as a guide, I crossed Kisdon on the path around its western and southern flanks – which, possibly deliberately, avoids the settlement. Truly fantastic views in all directions afforded from the crest. Part of this section runs as a green lane, with crumbling drystone walls on either side. In a rare moment of appreciating the finer things in life, Alfred Wainwright, in his guide to the Pennine Way, describes these thus:\n\nA feature of the Yorkshire Dales country is the network of ‘green’ roads (i.e. grass covered) crossing the hills and linking the valleys: relics of the days when trade was carried on by the use of horse transport. Where these routes ran along the valleys they have long been superseded by tarmac roads, but motors have not been able to follow the horses over the hills and the high moorland ways have fallen into disuse; they are however still plain to see and a joy to walk upon, being well-graded and sufficiently distinct on the ground to remove doubts of route-finding. Often they are walled on one or both sides; sometimes they run free and unfettered across the breasts of the hills and over the skyline. For pedestrian exercise these old packhorse roads are excellent: quiet and traffic free they lead effortlessly into and over the hills amid wild and lonely scenery, green ribbons threading their way through bog and heather and rushes.\n\nThey call a man to go with them!\n\nGreen lane/corpse path over Kisdon Fell\n\nSuch is the green way over Kisdon. One can easily imagine it as an old packhorse way, co-opted for the passage of funeral parties. This would certainly have been one of the more difficult sections of the route as a whole, especially if they were trying to avoid habitation, but at a cost of gradient. The ascent up, and descent down, Kisdon certainly served as an unwelcome reminder that I am now nearer 50 than 40.\n\nAt Muker, I suspect that the original corpse path probably forded the Swale. There is still a ford there and, indeed, a large flat rock which could well have served as a coffin rest. I, however, succumbed to modern health and safety concerns, and doubled back and used the rather splendid stone footbridge. Turing east, one heads along the north side of the river, and onto the floodplain. The flat, easy walking here is a relief.\n\nFord at Muker\n\nPossible coffin rest on the south side of the ford\n\nOne then comes to the sixteenth century Ivelet Bridge, one of the most iconic (and photographed) bridges in the Yorkshire Dales. I was slightly disappointed not to find a headless black hound, but I was able to find the coffin stone which I have read about here. These flat, oblong platforms, at periodic intervals, served the specific purpose of providing coffin parties with the means of setting their burden down for a rest. It is quite clearly visible at the northern end of the bridge, now level with the ground. My guess is that it lost its height, and was incorprated into the surface when the road was mettled.\n\nThe iconic sixteenth century Ivelet Bridge\n\nStone coffin rest at Ivelet Bridge\n\nAfter a lunch stop at Gunnerside, one heads along a wooded footpath along the side of the river (confessing here that I cut off a right angle, probably allowing the ease of modern footpaths to trump being purist about following the exact corpse path route. About half a mile east of Gunnerside, I came across confirmation that I was, literally, on the right track: quite clearly another stone coffin rest. An oblong, distinctly coffin-shaped platform, about six feet long and two feet broad. The archaeologist in me clocked that it was certainly worked stone, and had been put there deliberately (there are no other stones nearby) and it is aligned exactly with the path. Well well…\n\nStone coffin rest near Gunnerside\n\nI felt it is a shame that these features which are of historical interest to the landscape and its past, aren’t marked. A small metal sign would do. If in the highly unlikely event that anyone from the Yorkshire Dales National Park authority reads this, please get in touch, I will be happy to work with you on this.\n\nAnother bit of flat floodplain walking brings you to the Isles Bridge, another iconic photo-op for the Dales. Some more easy walking – except for a section where the path goes along a rather hair raising raised narrow stone walkway, with no rails or anything. There is a section along the main road as it hugs the river before it curves north, and one rejoins the footpath along the leafy riverbank. And so, finally, to the Dales village of Reeth.\n\nSt Andrew’s Church, “The Cathedral of the Dales” at Grinton\n\nThe end of the path, the 12th century church of St Andrews at Grinton, is colloquially known as “the Cathedral of the Dales”. It is certainly a fitting end to the walk. In an interesting connection, the Dales Discovery site mentions that a certain Adam Barker, buried in the church, along with his daughters Sarah and Ann, was fined £5 for conducting a burial with a linen rather than a woollen shroud, contrary to local laws aimed protecting the woollen industry, and that this is recorded on a stone slab. I found Adam, Sarah and Ann’s interment stones, but not the slab.\n\nAdam Barker, and his daughter Sarah’s interment slab at Grinton. Anna’s is just out of shot.\n\nAnd one thing I noticed is that the churchyard is big – much, much bigger than would be needed for a tiny hamlet like Grinton, which makes sense.\n\nAll in all, even though I did not have a coffin to carry, the feel of the terrain, the grandeur of the Dale, and finding a few of the features I’ve read about and also discovering one or two more hiding in plain sight, certainly gave me a very small hint, perhaps a taste of the determination and sense of mission those which the coffin parties must have felt.\n\nToday marks the end of the four … interesting … years of my time as Head of the Department (HoD) of Digital Humanities at King’s College London. In a a College-wide briefing to HoDs last year, the Principal, Professor Shitij Kapur, described HoDs as “the line in the institution where the PowerPoints, the policy papers, the spreadsheets become the actions which make people’s lives better or worse”. I felt at the time that this description hit the nail on the head, and it has thus stuck with me. So: this is not another “reflecting on what is Digital Humanities” post (as I recently did for Viewfinder magazine), or an overview of my subject’s direction of travel (as I recently tried to offer in my Inaugural Lecture); rather I am going celebrate today by capturing a few insights into what I (think I) have learned by being part of the line.\n\nFirstly, in general I have come to dislike the term “leadership role” in an academic setting. “Taking on a leadership role” sounds rather box-ticky, something you do for the CV, or for the probation or promotion panel. “Service” is slightly better, with connotations of facilitating actions for the greater good of a bigger whole in a way that “leadership role” doesn’t. “Citizenship” I think is a bit too generic. “Leadership role” still sets itself apart from the main business of working life. At risk of sounding cliched and/or trite, the aim of a “leadership role”, however flawed the term might be, should be to make life better for all and, by expecting high standards of it, oneself and others, to elevate the institution as a whole.\n\nSo far, so worthy. Having got that out however, I am not so overrefined as to claim this is why I put myself forward for the job in summer of 2019 (although it is something I have come to realise, and judge myself on, in the meantime). Rather, in 2019, DDH was still in the throes of rapid and turbulent expansion in both student and staff numbers, some of it planned, some of it unplanned. I guess I felt that all the components of a vibrant, exciting Digital Humanities research agenda were there, one which was distinct from the kinds of DH done elsewhere, yet which had evolved and grown from twenty or more years of DH teaching and research at King’s. We could, I told myself, create the twenty first century successor to a long tradition of digital scholarship in, for and about the humanities. However, the whirlwind of constant expansion was stopping us from putting it all together. With several great opportunities and specific problems to address, it therefore seemed an exciting time to take on the role. In February 2020, shortly before becoming busy with other things, I published a post on here marking my first six months as HoD. In this, I argued that\n\nDDH’s story is one of evolution, development, and even – perhaps contrary to some appearances – continuity. This is an impression driven by the kind of question that we have always asked at King’s … The prepositions “with” and “about” [the Digital, our strapline] provide space for a multivocal approach, which includes both the work DDH(/CCH) has excelled at in the past, and that which it does now.\n\nLife, however, gets in the way of the very best plans. I became, of course, a “Covid era HoD”, and like many, my time became defined by the pandemic. During those first months of 2020, I remember learning, quickly, how to take one day, and one piece of information, at a time, and how try not to participate in cascades of dodgy information, whether from inside or outside. I vividly remember that I learned about our first Covid case in the Department’s student body on Thursday 12th March 2020 at exactly 5.45 PM, 15 minutes before I was due to take the lectern to give a Gresham College lecture, which itself turned out to be the last in its series before lockdown came. Heady days indeed. Most, but not all, of our classroom teaching had finished by late March 2020, but we still had to adapt, or “pivot” as the term came to be very quickly. We found ourselves working in ways I certainly didn’t expect, having to form a small, agile, very centralised management team that could respond quickly to events that changed almost by the hour through the spring and summer. As a Department with many international postgraduate students, we were particularly exposed to the risks of lockdowns and travel bans. However, the launch of our new MSc in Digital Economy in September 2020 was a major success; and our “pivot” to online, while of course turbulent, worked. Thanks to the innovation and creative flair of my colleagues across the Department, we came through.\n\nSince 2019, we have made a large number of new permanent academic appointments (bearing in mind there are various ways of counting this apparently simple statistic which are too convoluted to go into here, so I am not even going to try). Our professoriate has tripled from two to six, achieving 50/50 gender parity in the process. In the Department, a responsive and discursive research agenda is emerging. We have had considerable grant success, with a cumulative income well into the seven figures, since 2021. Most importantly though, we have seen the emergence of a set of interoperating research clusters in the Department: in Computational Humanities, Creative AI, Environmental Humanities, Global Digital Cultures, and the Centre for Digital Culture, which has now become an integral part of our Faculty’s new Digital Futures Institute. There is much, much work still to do: a year plus after returning to fully in-person teaching, steps are needed to build our research culture, especially with so many new colleagues. This will take time. The question which is always implicit in these conversations is how much time?\n\nBut “satisfaction”, whatever that is, remains elusive. This is not in any way a criticism of anyone, rather it is a manifestation of a bigger truth: like the black and white geese in the M. C. Escher image, a Department is two things at the same time. It is part of a larger institutional and intellectual ecosystem which fosters it, provides it with infrastructure, gives it an official and reputational home, shields it from occasional meteor strikes which would otherwise cause it (and its HoD) devastation, and expects things in return. It is simultaneously a community of scholars, a key part of whose job it is to be independent-minded, with a natural desire to question, to self-govern, and an inclination – indeed a responsibility – to develop a collective research agenda into which all can buy. And they also expect things in return. The purpose of the HoD is to enable their Department to exist in these two parallel states at the same time and – as much as possible – to maintain an equilibrium between them. The whole edifice exists in a state of constant negotiation and renegotiation. It is a journey with (hopefully) direction, but no final destination.\n\nBeing in a Department which has expanded so much and so quickly in the last decade has also brought some larger truths about Higher Education up close and personal. It is probably not too controversial to say that the national funding model, and the principles behind it, are no longer fit for purpose. Across the UK workloads are out of control, people are stretched, compromise become inevitable in areas where we would rather not compromise, and there is often a sense of “running to stay still”. This makes maintaining the equilibrium between the Escher geese harder and harder, and occupying the “line” in the institution as described by Prof Kapur, gives one a very clear perspective on this. My own two cents is that the traditional residential three year BA/one year Masters is certainly a gold standard for the humanities which must be jealously guarded. However, the idea that this one the one model is the best or only one for everyone belongs to an era – which, sadly I am old enough to remember – when an academic could know every student in a year cohort, or even a whole Department, by sight. This is why I am very glad that we have begun to experiment with professional education, career accelerators and short courses; smaller and more adaptable pedagogies of imparting our knowledge to those who need it in more flexible timeframes. Working in such an interdisciplinary field, and across so many disciplines, we have had to develop strong collaborative, pedagogical and method frameworks in our own research. Having worked on some of these experiments directly myself, I have come to believe that these frameworks are strong enough to be bought into the commercial and industry worlds without any compromising of academic standards or rigour. So maybe this points towards the future.\n\nOne of the achievements I am most proud of is instituting our King’s Public Lecture in Digital Humanities, a major new biennial platform for the field’s leading international scholars (which I am much looking forward to continuing to organize in 2025). It was inaugurated this May by the stellar Shannon Mattern, who tackled the issue of modelling doubt in the digital age. The ability to get to grips with doubt is unquestionably the most important skill I have learned. I thank all of those who have taught me this.\n\nHaving done it for 17 years, I know that commuting into Central London is taxing process. Taxing in terms of money certainly, but also in terms of time, physical and mental energy, often productivity and stress. As I live about 40 miles west of the capital, this involves a bus and a train, and then a Tube journey from Paddington to my office, a journey of a bit over one and half hours if it goes well. It was partly this, and partly my academic interests in thoroughfares and mobility, which led me to read Movement: how to take back our streets and transform our lives(2022), by Thalia Verkade, a Rotterdam-based journalist, and Marco te Brömmelstroet, a social scientist and expert in urban planning at the University of Amsterdam, who has a large Twitter following as “The Cycling Professor”.\n\nIn Movement, this collaboration has produced a lively and radical piece of research-driven investigative journalism which seeks to ask “why has traffic taken over our public space?” Traffic, and especially vehicular traffic, has become such an integral part of life that we don’t stop to question why this is, or indeed why it should be. A sign which declares that a road is “closed” for a street party is closed to cars, but open to people; yet the language of “road closure” is do obvious that it blends in. This bias in language reflects historical trends: we have become vastly more mobile since 1950, but while distances travelled have increased, the time we spend travelling remains broadly the same (this is Marchetti’s Constant). If a mode of travel comes along which cuts the time it takes from home to work by 25% then, in the long run, we do not spend less time travelling, we get either a better job or a better house, and the travel time remains the same. It is also for this reason that simply increasing capacity of the transport network will never solve the problem of congestion: make a six-lane motorway into an eight-lane motorway, and you will not reduce the density of traffic, you will increase the volume of traffic. This is the law of economic gravity in action.\n\nMany of the book’s key insights are framed as Direct Message exchanges between Verkade and te Brömmelstroet, with the former framing questions and developing the narrative in a journalistic way, and latter providing scholarship-driven perspectives. This sets a lively, conversational tone in which the book’s main argument is conveyed. It is remarked, for example, by te Brömmelstroet that the “pain of half a century of spatial planning” has stemmed from an assumption that the prerequisite for a better quality of life and escape from the rat race is the ability to travel further, faster, more comfortably and more cheaply, in response to Verkade’s observation that changing the status quo is painful. The implied opposite of this is what do we do to improve the spaces in front of us. The discursive narrative between the two convincingly establishes the former as a neoliberal myth, into which various powerful interests have become heavily invested. Interestingly, this includes in some cases organisations which are supposedly committed to furthering the interests of the passenger/pedestrian.\n\nThe central plank of Verkade and te Brömmelstroet’s thesis is that “car logic has colonized our thinking” to the extent that it becomes difficult to imagine roads or routeways as anything other than dangerous areas to be navigated with the most extreme care, and where the motorcar has unquestioned right of way. Verkade presents three images of the junction between Benthuizerstraat and Bergweg near her home in Rotterdam, from 1908, 1932 and 2020. The change is certainly striking: the scene in the first image is, in Verkade’s words “like a village … [t]hese streets weren’t through roads: this was an area where people strolled about.” The same scene depicted in 2020 is now “one of Rotterdam’s most dangerous junctions”. The evidence amassed for car-colonization is certainly compelling, and its consequences sobering. In general terms at least, the idea that the car has colonized our way of seeing mobility; and realising this critically is a point of epiphany.\n\nA key question which the book touches on throughout, but which I felt never entirely answers, is how the idea of car-colonization really extends to different regions, cities cultures and countries. Writing this reflection from the perspective of one who works (but does not live) in London, this meta-question raises further issues. Few would argue that the coming of the automobile in London was over decades, and remains, a badly negotiated hotchpotch of compromise, conflict and congestion, as an ever increasing volume of traffic elbowed its way along centuries-old streets and between ancient buildings. I get a reminder of this whenever I go into work. Near my office there is a junction linking Waterloo Bridge with the Strand and Aldwych, which is a rather terrifying spaghetti junction of cycle lanes, bus lanes, carriageways, pedestrian crossing and pavement. One is frequently reminded that one moment of lapsed concentration (or road rage) by a cyclist, pedestrian or motorist could have dire consequences (see pic below).\n\nThe car may also have colonized our thinking on London, but I suspect it has probably met more colonial resistance here than in other places. The iconic place of the London Underground in London life, and in London’s genus loci, underlines to this. Witness, for example, the reaction when the authorities tried to remove the Thames from the Tube map in 2009. Contrast on the other side the grid plan layout of many US cities, with their all-sweeping angular logic designed clearly with the car in mind (see Deidre Mask’s wonderful The Address Book: What Street Addresses Reveal about Identity, Race, Wealth and Power (2020) for a discussion of this). It is perhaps also the genus loci of London, and the UK’s other ancient cities, that efforts to negotiate better, or at least more progressive relationships between the car and the public space have riled conspiracy theorists linked to climate change denial, and other “globalist” themes. Current plans by the London administration to expand the city’s Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) for example, which have the aim of removing older, polluting vehicles from the city centre, have met with objections that it is “a grand conspiracy to take away … freedoms through mass surveillance and enforced fines” (although there are more mainstream concerns raised by unions about the ability of low to medium paid workers being able to get to work). Similarly, the notion of the “15-minute city”, where residents like within fifteen cycle or walk from all the amenities they will need, has been described as “an international socialist conspiracy”, and led to unruly protests on Oxford. The 15-minute city is, apparently, a plot to constrain us within pre-defined geographical areas, and to shadow our footsteps with automatic cameras if we seek to leave them.\n\nThe glimpse of an alternative has recently emerged, again in the neighbourhood of my own workplace. Westminster City Council’s Strand/Aldwych pedestrianisation project has seen vehicular traffic routed round Aldwych to the north, closing our section of the Strand to traffic and opening it to pedestrians (and cyclists) – see picutures. The result is wonderful – a clean-feeling open space, framed by the spires of St Mary le Strand and St Clement Danes. The ability to traverse the space gives a greater feeling of open skies. It is a space where you can sit, socialize, eat lunch, or just wander (and, in my case, sketch sometimes). It is clearly not a solution to improve the through-flow of traffic in the city; but what it might do as the project progresses is promote “flow”, as described in Movement, the state in which you think, feel and exist more freely, “that blissful feeling people can experience when al their attention is in the moment, often leading to flashes of inspiration”.\n\nMovement was also grist to my own research, into historic vernacular thoroughfares and routeways. The archaeologists Jim Leary and Martin Bell pointed out in 2020 that much historical and archaeological research into routeways was hamstrung by a residual suspicion that it is a topic of pseudoscience and pseudoarchaeology, stemming from Alfred Watkins’s enormously influential but methodologically flawed Old Straight Track (1925). I believe we can add Verkade and Te Brömmelstroet’s analysis of car-colonization to this as a reason for limiting our scholarly imagination about the history of routeways, and our assumption that they are passive conduits, whereas they exert massive proactive influence of our lives, culture and history.\n\nIn summary, Movement is a work of activism, public scholarship and journalism that I found hugely energetic and energising. It is a book which deserves to be read by anyone who cares urban citizenship, the public spaces in which it happens, and the history and culture that those spaces encode."
