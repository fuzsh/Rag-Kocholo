        "text": "One moment Thursday encapsulated the special nature of the N.H.L.’s traditional handshake line after playoff series: The Montreal Canadiens’ Brandon Prust placed his hand gently on the side of Derek Stepan’s head, smiling as he spoke to Stepan, his affection bound with remorse and best wishes as the Rangers were headed to the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nA week earlier, Prust broke Stepan’s jaw with a late hit, but here Prust was, congratulating his friend and former Rangers teammate, his face close to Stepan’s, which was still enclosed in a protective helmet.\n\n“I’m not going to hold that against him,” Stepan said, distilling the handshake line’s healing qualities. “He feels bad about it. He knows it was late. And we move on from there.”\n\nHandshake lines form every N.H.L. postseason even though no rule mandates them. It is simply a cherished custom emanating from deep in hockey’s past. No one knows when this display of sportsmanship started.\n\nIn May, however, Liam Maguire, a hockey historian from Ottawa, posted a memoir online that might date the first formal postgame handshakes to more than 100 years ago.\n\nMaguire remembered a conversation he had in 1980 with an Ottawa-area resident in his 80s. The resident, whose surname was Lamb, was a cousin of Joe Lamb, who played in the N.H.L. in the 1920s and ’30s.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
