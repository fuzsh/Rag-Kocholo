        "text": "\"How Great Thou Art\" Lyrics\n\nO Lord my God, When I, in awesome wonder,\n\nConsider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;\n\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\n\nThy power throughout the universe displayed.\n\nChorus:\n\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\n\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art.\n\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\n\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art!\n\nWhen through the woods and forest glades I wander,\n\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.\n\nWhen I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur\n\nAnd see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.\n\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\n\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art.\n\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\n\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art!\n\nAnd when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;\n\nSent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;\n\nThat on a Cross, my burdens gladly bearing,\n\nHe bled and died to take away my sin.\n\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\n\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art.\n\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\n\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art!\n\nWhen Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,\n\nAnd take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.\n\nThen I shall bow, in humble adoration,\n\nAnd then proclaim: \"My God, how great Thou art!\"\n\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\n\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art.\n\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\n\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art!\n\nThe Story Behind How Great Thou Art , Hymn Meaning, and Story\n\nStuart K. Hine was a Bristish Methodist missionary on a mission trip in Ukraine in 1931 when he heard the Russian translation of a German song inspired by Carl Boberg's poem \"O Store Gud\" (O Great God). Hine began to translate the song to English and added several verses. The third verse was inspired by the conversion of villagers in Russia who cried out to God loudly as the repented and realized God's love and mercy - \"And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in.\"\n\nStuart Hine and his family left Ukraine as famine and World War Two began, and settled in Somerset, Britain, where he continued to serve as a missionary to Polish refugees. The forth verse of \"How Great Thou Art\" was inspired by displaced Russians who experienced great loss and looked forward to seeing their loved ones again in heaven - \"When Christ shall come with shoult of acclamation to take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.\"\n\nThe final English version of \"How Great Thou Art\" was published in 1949 and quickly spread among Britian, Africa, India, and America.\n\nBiblical Inspiration for \"How Great Thou Art\"\n\n\"For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authoritiesâ€”all things were created through him and for him.\" (Colossians 1:16)\n\n\"Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.\" (Psalm 90:2)\n\n\"Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works!\" (Psalm 105:2)\n\nOur Favorite Performance of How Great Thou Art"
