Since a significant part of the scoring is based on quality of presentation, only the individual presenting the paper receives the award.\n\nGuidelines for Consideration of Candidates\n\nEach Section is responsible for establishing a judging committee to serve at the Section meeting. Papers are judged by this Committee according to creative thinking, organization, delivery, and visual aids.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe selection of the judging committee is conveyed by the Section to Headquarters for preparation of the award.\n\nDescription of Award\n\nThe award is a diamond shape crystal displaying the AAPG emblem and Section name. The crystal is mounted on a wood base with a gold plate inscribed with the recipient’s name, year and name of the award winning paper.\n\nHistory\n\nThis award is perpetuated by the A. I. Levorsen Memorial Award Fund established in 1966 by Dr. Levorsen’s friends, who wished to create a lasting memorial to him.\n\nFunding\n\nFunding for the original award was provided through the AAPG Foundation Awards Fund through generous contributions from many of Dr. Levorsen’s friends. In 2007, Dr. Levorsen’s son, Robert Levorsen, provided a generous contribution to enhance and update the award through the AAPG Foundation Awards Fund as a lasting tribute to his father."
