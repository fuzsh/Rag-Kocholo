Well-known Las Vegas attorney James "Bucky" Buchanan died in a traffic accident Saturday evening after he crashed a Ferrari into a wall, Las Vegas police said.

The accident occurred just before 6 p.m. at Linden Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard, near Bonanza Road and Hollywood Boulevard, Las Vegas police Lt. Steve Herpolsheimer said.

He said Buchanan was the only person in the vehicle. Herpolsheimer had no further details on the crash, which he said occurred near Buchanan's home.

Buchanan was 74.

Police said in a news release, which did not specifically identify Buchanan, that the driver was attempting to back into his driveway when he suffered a medical episode.

Buchanan spent most of his law practice as a defense attorney. He had a list of high-profile clients and a quick wit.

In an April 2005 interview with the Review-Journal, asked why he came to Las Vegas nearly four decades ago, Buchanan said it was mostly for the strippers.

Asked why he went into criminal defense work, Buchanan replied: "A funny thing happened on the way to the church."
