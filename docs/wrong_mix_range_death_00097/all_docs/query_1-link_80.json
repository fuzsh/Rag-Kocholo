        "text": "Allen, James Lane (1849-1925)\n\nSection D, Lot 91\n\nA renowned 19th Century novelist, James Lane Allen taught school for several years after his graduation from Transylvania University and prior to becoming an author. Allen moved to New York, where he was devoted full time to the writing of his stories based on actual occurrences. His most popular work was Flute and Violin and Other Kentucky Tales and Romances, published in 1891. In this book was the story, “King Solomon of Kentucky.” Structured from the King Solomon legend, Allen greatly embellished it. Allen bequeathed a fountain to the youth of Lexington which was placed in Gratz Park, then dedicated in 1933\n\nBarlow, Milton (1818-1891)\n\nSection G, Lot 34\n\nIn cooperation with his father, Thomas, Milton Barlow invented and built the first planetarium in Milton’s silversmith shop. Originally, Thomas simply wanted to illustrate the movements of the planets for his grandchildren, but the process became a three year effort of careful meshing of cog-wheeled gears to produce the minute fractional revolutions of the planets. In 1844, the father and son sold their planetarium to Girard College. They continued to build planetariums for ten years, selling them for $2,000 each and exhibiting one at the 1851 New York World’s Fair. Milton’s tombstone reads “Kentucky’s two greatest inventors.” In addition to being an inventor, Milton was chief of ordnance to Confederate Generals Abraham Buford and John H. Morgan.\n\nBeard, Joseph (1812-1858)\n\nSection F, Lot 12\n\nAs the Lexington city marshal in 1858, Joseph Beard died in the line of duty when he was stabbed by William Barker, a man he arrested for brawling in the middle of town. When Barker was jailed the townspeople angrily gathered outside yelling “Hang him, hang him.” The mob broke into the jail and dragged Barker to the courthouse across the street. A beam was placed through a second story window to which a noose was tied. Baker was forced to stand at the window while the noose was placed over his head, then he was pushed out of the window. The rope broke and Barker fell head first onto the brick walk below. The angry crowd forced him up and to the window again, where he was hanged until dead. William Barker was unceremoniously buried in a potter’s field.\n\nMarshal Beard was buried with a great ceremony in The Lexington Cemetery. His monument reads, “A Victim of Violence whilst in the Discharge of his Duty as Marshal of the City of Lexington.\n\nBreckinridge, Colonel William Cabell Preston (1837-1904)\n\nSection O, Lot 126\n\nHe was a lawyer, soldier, editor, and statesman, known as the “silver-tongued orator of Kentucky.” His downfall was the publicity he received from a breach of promise suit brought in 1894 by Madeline Pollard against him. It was front- page news nationwide for six weeks. The court awarded Pollard $15,000 in damages, then Colonel Breckinridge announced his candidacy for a sixth consecutive term in Congress immediately thereafter.\n\nThe Suffragettes were aroused and publicly opposed him. The National Christian League for the Promotion of Social Purity sent a letter to Congress in protest. They also sent a letter to Col. Breckinridge’s wife asking her, in the name of womanhood, to renounce her husband and refuse to live with him. When he arrived in Lexington to campaign in May, 1894, Laura Clay had organized an “anti- Breckinridge” rally at the Opera House. It was attended by the “best people in Fayette County” and among them were 1,000 women who loudly made their feelings known. Breckinridge lost the election and his political career was over. Without the ability to cast a single vote, the women defeated him.\n\nBreckinridge, Dr. Robert (1800-1871)\n\nSection O, Lot 151\n\nOne of the 25 founders of The Lexington Cemetery Corporation, Dr. Robert Breckinridge was educated at Princeton, Yale and Union College. He practiced law in Lexington, served in the Kentucky Legislature, and became state superintendent of public instruction. That position earned him the title “founder of the public school system in Kentucky.” At the age of 28, he retired from political life and devoted himself to theology. Ordained a Presbyterian minister, he served in Baltimore and at the First Presbyterian Church in Lexington. He was opposed to slavery, and at the beginning of the Civil War, he and others established the Danville Review, which strongly supported the Union. During the war, Breckinridge was Lincoln’s advisor in Kentucky.\n\nBreckinridge, Dr. Sophonisba Preston (1866-1948)\n\nSection O, Lot 126\n\nDaughter of William Cabell Preston Breckinridge, Sophonisba Preston Breckinridge studied law at the University of Kentucky and became the first woman admitted to the Kentucky Bar Association. She was also the first woman to be awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in political science from the University of Chicago, where she became Dean of the School of Social Administration. Concerned for the political and economic equality of women, she associated with the Woman’s Trade Union League where she helped organize garment workers’ strikes in 1911 and 1915. Working with the Clay sisters, she was vice-president of the National American Woman’s Suffrage Association in 1911. She was one of the first women to join the N.A.A.C.P. A representative to many international conferences, she was the first woman delegate to the Pan-American Conference in Montevideo where she advocated legally extending women’s rights for equality in every nation.\n\nBreckinridge, General John Cabell (1821-1875)\n\nSection G, Lot 1\n\nGeneral Breckinridge could be considered one of the tragic heroes of the Civil War. This brilliant southern gentleman graduated from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky in 1839 and studied law at Transylvania. After serving as a major of the Third Regiment in the Mexican War, he served in the Kentucky Legislature and the U.S. Senate. At age 35, he was Vice President of the United States under James Buchanan. In 1860, he was nominated for President. As a senator during the term of President Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge worked for compromise measures, but in 1861 he resigned for the Southern cause. He quickly rose through the ranks of military leadership to Secretary of War for the Confederate States. After the defeat of the South, he spent four years in exile in Europe. When he finally felt physically safe, he returned to Lexington. A broken-hearted man, he kept a low profile, refusing even to comment about politics. His statue stands in Cheapside Park.\n\nBreckinridge, Mary (1881-1965)\n\nSection G, Lot 1\n\nAfter graduating from New York’s School of Nursing at St. Luke’s Hospital, Mary Breckinridge became a certified midwife in a London, England hospital. She worked with the Visiting Nurse Service in France during World War I. She returned to the remote counties in the mountains of Kentucky and started the Kentucky Commission for Mothers and Babies which became the Frontier Nursing Service in 1925. Until this time, “catching the baby” by the father or a neighbor while the mother delivered it from a squatting position or seated in a chair without a bottom had been the standard birthing procedure. The “horseback angels” traveled within 700 square miles around their Hyden hospital in Leslie County. In the first 50 years of service, they delivered 12,262 babies with a maternal death rate of 9.1 per thousand, while the national mortality rate for white women in childbirth was 34 per thousand. Understanding the pride of the mountain people, Mary Breckinridge allowed them to pay for their medical care at a minimum of $2 per year and $50 per birth. Payment was in money, guns, eggs, or whatever the mountain people had.\n\nBurrows, Nathan (1774-1841)\n\nSection F, Lot 28\n\nThe early settlers came to “Kentucke” because they wanted land to grow crops. In 1796, Nathan Burrows invented a machine for cleaning hemp, a native Kentucky plant. It quickly became the most important crop in the area bringing in an estimated half million dollars a year in the early 1800’s. Hemp was needed for bagging cotton and making baling rope. By 1810, between 60 and 100 slaves were working the hemp in long, narrow buildings. The buildings were called rope walks because the slaves walked back and forth from spindles, twisting the hemp fiber into rope as they walked. With the importation of sisal from the Philippines after the Spanish American War, the hemp industry died. Burrows was resourceful and discovered a process for manufacturing mustard which also grew wild in Kentucky fields. His product won a premium at the World’s Fair in London in 1882.\n\nBush, Joseph H. (1794-1865)\n\nSection P, Lot 74\n\nOne of the most popular early Kentucky portraitists was Joseph H. Bush, who studied with Thomas Sully in Philadelphia. After returning to his native state, Bush advertised in the newspaper and charged $150 per portrait. The fact that he was commissioned by some of the most prominent men of his time attests to his skill as a painter. Henry Clay, Dr. Benjamin Dudley, and even Zachary Taylor were his subjects. Like many other artists, he traveled south in the winter, often painting an entire family while he lived on his plantation in Mississippi or Louisiana.\n\nClay, Henry (1777-1852)\n\nSection M\n\nPerhaps Kentucky’s most famous man was Henry Clay, who was actually born in Virginia. His father died when Clay was five. He did manual labor and worked in a drug store to help support his mother and family. At 16, he found a mentor, a Virginia lawyer who took him to Richmond to study.\n\nArriving in Lexington in 1797, Clay was seeking his fortune as a lawyer in a place known for many land disputes. His success in the courtroom propelled him into politics where he spent 43 years as a public figure, 27 years of which he was a U.S.Congressman and Senator. Among his accomplishments were the acquisition for the United States of Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, the admission of Missouri to the Union, and the annexation of the Republic of Texas. Clay served four years as Secretary of State. He is also remembered for his three unsuccessful quests for the presidency.\n\nFollowing his death in Washington, his remains were returned to Lexington by train, carriage and barge. All along the 1,200 mile route, people gathered to salute “The Great Compromiser.” In Lexington, Clay lay in state at his home, Ashland, and it is said that when his funeral cortege was entering The Lexington Cemetery gates, the end of the procession of mourners was just leaving Ashland, more than two miles away.\n\nClay, Mary Jane Warfield (1815-1900)\n\nSection J, Lot 6\n\nWomen from the Bluegrass State were important national figures in the beginning of the women’s rights movement.\n\nMary Jane Warfield Clay was the wife of hot-headed abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, Ambassador to Russia. Born into a wealthy Lexington family, Mrs. Clay, like so many of the women of her time, did not live a life of idle luxury. Like most prominent public figures, her husband was away from home most of their married life. Mrs. Clay raised their large family, paid for the education of six children, managed her husband’s farm, enlarged his mansion White Hall, and paid his debts. During the Civil War, one source of her income was raising and selling mules to the Union Army. “I have had upwards of a thousand mules on the farm, eight hundred and fifty are gone now,” she wrote. When her husband returned from almost nine years in Russia, he brought with him the scandal of his philandering abroad and ultimately proof of his adultery: an illegitimate son.\n\nThe Clays divorced in 1878, and their daughters learned the realities of women’s legal rights. Although their mother had not only maintained his property but improved their father’s financial situation, she was not legally entitled to any recompense, nor did she have any legal right to the custody of the children.\n\nDudley, Dr. Benjamin Winslow (1785-1870)\n\nSection G, Lot 10\n\nSomeone wrote about Dr. Benjamin Winslow, who was considered by many a hero of the 1833 cholera epidemic, “Our physicians are either dead or broken down, Dr. Dudley alone I believe has stood it through, and is still on the alert.”\n\nReceiving his early education Lexington, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania medical department at the age of 19. In returning to Lexington, he was offered the Chair of the Anatomy and Physiology Department at Transylvania University. Dudley performed over 200 lithotomies, an operation for the removal of bladder-stones, with only six fatalities, and was among the first neurosurgeons in the United States to work in trephining. This surgery involved making a circular incision in the skull to release pressure, which was believed to cause epilepsy. Dr. Dudley has an international reputation for his successful operations for bladder stone, and was a pioneer in cataract and brain surgery.\n\nGratz, Benjamin (1792-1884)\n\nSection D, Lot 121\n\nA contemporary of Colonel James Morrison, Benjamin Gratz was a wealthy business and civic leader, and for sixty-five years was one of Lexington’s most astute and valuable citizens. His home, Mount Hope, is still standing beside the park named for him. A partner with Colonel Morrison in hemp manufacturing, Gratz was also involved in many businesses in the city. Like Colonel Morrison, Gratz was a trustee of Transylvania. He was a curator for Kentucky University. Additionally, he was the first president of the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical Association. Gratz helped promote construction of the Maysville- Lexington road and the Lexington and Ohio Railroad. As a member of the city council, Gratz was instrumental in establishing Lexington’s public library, the first in the West. During the Civil War, Gratz was a Unionist, and he turned his home into a commissary and a cookhouse for the companies of Federal soldiers encamped on the lawn of Transylvania.\n\nHunt, John Wesley (1773-1849)\n\nSection C, Lot 17\n\nConsidered to be the first millionaire west of the Alleghenies, the family of John Wesley Hunt was one of Lexington’s most prominent families. He is the father of Charlton Hunt, who became the first mayor of Lexington. Coming to Lexington in 1795, John Wesley Hunt became a merchant, horsebreeder, hemp manufacturer, and banker. He was appointed postmaster by President John Adams in 1799. As postmaster, Mr. Hunt established a mail route from Lexington to Washington, D.C. That pony express route took two weeks to complete.\n\nJohn Wesley Hunt built Hopemont (today known as The Hunt-Morgan House). The house is believed to be haunted by the old Negro nurse, Bouviette, who was called “Aunt Betty” by the Morgan Children. After “her” boys went to war, she would appear on Main Street whenever she thought any Southern troops were coming through town. She often waited for hours to give a drink of lemonade to one of “her” boys. Four of the six boys she nursed lived to carry her remains to the family lot in The Lexington Cemetery where a little stone has this simple inscription, “Bouvieete James Col. Ever Faithful.”\n\nMasterson, James (1752-1838)\n\nSection K, Lot 6\n\nLexington was named for the first site of the battle of the Revolutionary War by settlers who came here in 1775. These first settlers left, but others followed. One of the settlers was James Masterson, for whom Masterson’s Station was named. In the spring of 1779, he helped build the first blockhouse on the corner of what is today Main and Mill Streets.\n\nMasterson loved the woods and prided himself on his strength and skill. As Lexington grew and became a sophisticated city, Masterson kept the old stories of Indian dangers and buffalo and deer kills alive with his tales of the early days of the settlement. One of his favorite stories was how he brought the early settlers their salt. Masterson bragged that he had walked to the Falls of the Ohio River, in what is today Louisville, secured the salt, and returned “in a day or so,” and, in fact, he did just that.\n\nMcKee, Lt. Hugh (1844-1871)\n\nSection P, Lot 71\n\nLt. McKee is immortalized by a majestic monument composed of a white marble column on a massive granite base, topped with an urn draped with the American flag. With reliefs of ships and eagles, the monument traces the career of the young officer. Lt. McKee was killed in 1871 after being the first man to reach a fort in Korea where the U.S., England, France, and Germany were fighting China for trade agreements. The fort was captured and named Fort McKee in his honor. On May 22, 1872, the Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce and Navigation was signed establishing diplomatic and trade relations between the United States and Korea.\n\nMcMurtry, John (1813-1890)\n\nSection I, Lot 63\n\nAs one of Lexington’s most prolific architects and builders, John McMurtry was trained locally as an apprentice. Rather than any one style, McMurtry’s work provided a cross-section of 19th century architecture. Floral Hall near the Red Mile, the courthouse in Winchester, Kentucky, and the chapel in the old Episcopal Cemetery on East Third Street are examples on his various designs. Never without his black stovepipe hat and umbrella, he built and supervised construction of hundreds of homes in Fayette County. He did not design, but built Christ Church Episcopal and the Loudoun House.\n\nPiatt, Thomas (1877-1965)\n\nSection 26, Lot 38 and 39\n\nThe first president of the Thoroughbred Club of America, Thomas Piatt was a noted breeder of thoroughbreds at his Brookdale Farm on Spur Road, which he expanded from 210 acres in 1898 to more than 1,200 acres. One of his greatest horses was Alsab, outstanding two-year-old and three-year-old in 1941 and 1942, winner of the American Derby, and victor over Requested and Whirlaway in match races. He was president of the Breeders Sales Company and a director of Keeneland Association; and in 1949 he was recognized by the Thoroughbred Club at its annual testimonial dinner for his kindliness, sportsmanship, and character.\n\nPostlethwait, John (1769-1833)\n\nSection 13, Lot 9\n\nHaving moved to Lexington from Carlisle, Pennsylvania in 1790, John Postlethwait soon married a daughter of Governor Scott. He was a town trustee in 1794, and in 1827 was chairman of the Board of Trustees. In 1797, John and his brother Samuel bought a large brick school building at Main and Limestone streets and converted it into a tavern, said to have been the finest in Kentucky. He operated it off and on for the next thirty-six years until his death in the great cholera epidemic. The hotel gained the name Phoenix when it was rebuilt after a fire in 1820.\n\nSolomon, William King (1775-1854)\n\nSection A, Lot\n\nIn the summer of 1833, a cholera epidemic killed 500 Lexingtonians in two months, and half the population fled the city in fear. William “King” Solomon remained to dig the graves, an act which earned him the lasting respect of the town.\n\nMigrating to Lexington from Virginia, “King” Solomon was the town drunk who now and then did odd jobs such as digging ditches. Finally his public drunkenness earned him a vagrancy charge. He was sentenced to be auctioned as an indentured servant to the highest bidder. Aunt Charlotte, a free Negro vendor of homemade cakes and pies, purchased him for 18 cents. When the plague broke out, Aunt Charlotte pled with Solomon to leave the city. Solomon was not afraid of contracting the plague, and he remained. For two months, he labored every day burying the dead and sleeping in the pioneer graveyard at night.\n\nOn the first day of the court session in the fall of 1833, Solomon was lounging in the back of the courtroom when the judge spotted him. Without a word, the judge stepped from the bench and walked back to the vagrant. The judge shook his hand, and everyone in the room stood, walked to the gravedigger and did the same. “King” Solomon had become a hero.\n\nStoll, John George (1878-1959)\n\nSection S, Lot\n\nNewspaperman John George Stoll, editor and publisher of the Lexington Leader beginning in 1914 purchased the Lexington Herald in 1937 and left it editorially free. The newspaper was the Democratic opponent of Stoll’s Republican paper. As a member of Kentucky’s House of Representative, Stoll was a strong Republican and a generous contributor to his party, but he was a businessman first. Knowing that the Bluegrass was predominately Democratic, he maintained the freedom of the Herald to promote the Democratic point of view. In 1953, he created the Lexington Herald-Leader Co., of which he was president. Stoll was president of the Lexington Water Company from 1907 to 1926 and of the Phoenix Hotel Company and First National Bank. He was later vice president of the First and City National Bank and a director of the Security Trust Company.\n\nSweeney, Mary E. (1879-1968)\n\nSection P, Lot 129\n\nA native of Lexington, Mary E. Sweeney became known internationally as an authority on home economics and child care. In World War I, she was chairman of home economics in the U.S. Food Administration, headed by Herbert Hoover, and she was in demand as a lecturer and consultant in Europe, India, and China as well as America. She had degrees from Transylvania, the University of Kentucky, and Columbia University, and for twenty years was affiliated with a school for child development and family life in Detroit.\n\nTodd, Levi (1756-1807)\n\nSection F, Lot 26\n\nWhen the Lexington settlers signed a “citizens compact” on January 25, 1807, Levi Todd became a landholder. This specified that the town was to be defined “in lots” of one-half acres each for farming and “out lots” of five acres each for farming. Every man and widow over 21 years of age who had resided in Lexington for six months or who had raised a crop of corn by the following year was entitled to one “in lot” and one “out lot.”\n\nLevi Todd helped defend Harrodsburg against the Indians, survived the Battle of Blue Licks, and became a major general in the Kentucky Militia.\n\nIn 1781, the citizens of Fayette County elected the first Board of Trustees of five men. One was Levi Todd. He was elected the first Clerk of Fayette County, an office he held for 25 years. In 1784, Kentuckians wanted to establish themselves as a state independent of Virginia. They met repeatedly in Danville framing and reframing Kentucky’s constitution. Levi Todd and John Breckinridge were delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Danville, Kentucky.\n\nUnderwood, Thomas R. (1898-1956)\n\nSection 32, Lot 44\n\nHaving spent his entire newspaper career on the Lexington Herald, Thomas R. Underwood started as a reporter in 1917 and served as editor from 1935 until his death. Active in Democratic politics, he became chairman of the party’s State Central Committee, a United States representative in 1949 to 1951, and a senator from 1951 to 1952. He was secretary of the Kentucky Racing Commission for fourteen years, was a founder and secretary of the National Association of State Racing Commissioners, and was a leader in many civic organizations.\n\nVarney, James (Jim) Albert Jr. (1949-2000)\n\nSection C-1 James Albert Varney, Jr. (Jim Varney), an American actor and comedian, was born in Lexington, Kentucky, to Nancy Louise (Howard) and James Albert Varney, Sr. He became interested in theater as a teenager, winning state titles in drama competitions while a student at Lafayette High School in Lexington, Kentucky. Jim Varney is best known for his broadly comedic role as Ernest P. Worrell, appearing in numerous television commercial advertising campaigns and films and for which he won a Daytime Emmy Award. He played Jed Clampett in a film adaptation of The Beverly Hillbillies and performed the voice of Slinky Dog in Toy Story and Toy Story 2. He died of lung cancer at the age of 50 on February 10, 2000."
