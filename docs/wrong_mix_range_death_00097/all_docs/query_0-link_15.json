        "text": "A surprisingly uncommon Presidential check. Two months before he thankfully turned over the reins of the Executive to Abraham Lincoln, the lame-duck President directs payment of an unspecified amount of \"interest on Ohio State [bonds?] standing in my name,\" the order of \"Riggs & Co.\" (whose name does not appear on the check, while the vignette illustration is certainly theirs). In reaction to the election of Lincoln, South Carolina had already seceded (on December 20) and other southern states were debating secession motions. Buchanan maintained that the Federal government had no constitutional powers to force a state to remain in the Union, but when Fort Sumter was threatened, ineffectually sent reinforcements by sea, which were turned back by Confederate fire on January 9."
