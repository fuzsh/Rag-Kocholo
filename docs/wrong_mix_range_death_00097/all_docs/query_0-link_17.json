        "meta_description": "Duke was the only child of tobacco and electric energy tycoon James Buchanan Duke and his second wife, Nanaline Holt Inman, widow of Dr. William Patterson Inman. Her father died in 1925 when Doris was twelve, leaving approximately half of his estate to The Duke Endowment with the remainder, estimated at $100 million, going to Doris.\r\n\r\nDuke spent her early childhood at Duke Farms, James Buchanan Duke's 2,700 acre (11 kmÂ²) estate in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey. At the age of 14, Duke took her mother to court and successfully prevented the sale of the property. Following the death of her father, Duke was raised in a Manhattan mansion at 1 East 78th Street which later became the home of New York University's Institute of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nDuke's mother died in 1962, leaving her jewelry and a coat.",
