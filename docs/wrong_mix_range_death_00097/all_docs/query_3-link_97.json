He would support the Union during the Civil War, and some of Abraham Lincoln’s initial actions as president, but was critical of the Emancipation Proclamation and efforts towards Reconstruction. Cabinet members of Buchanan’s, including five who stayed in their position into Lincoln’s presidency, refused to defend Buchanan, and a Senate resolution to condemn personal attacks levied against Buchanan failed.\n\nBuchanan would begin writing his memoirs in an attempt to rehabilitate his image, including bolstering foreign policy efforts throughout his presidency, and casting blame on the impetus of the Civil War onto Congress. Shortly after his memoirs were published, with little fanfare, Buchanan developed a cold and died on June 1, 1868. His last words were reportedly, “O Lord Almighty, as thou wilt.” He is interned at Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He was 77 years old. \n\nImage Credit: Uncharted Lancaster \n#ThePresidentGuy #USA #History #USHistory #America #Presidents #PresidentHistory #USPresidents #Buchanan #JamesBuchanan #pennslyvania #Lancaster #OnThisDay #RIP #RestInPeace #CivilWar #Democrat #DemocraticParty\".",
