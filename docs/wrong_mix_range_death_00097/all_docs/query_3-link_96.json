While nearly every other country presents, as far as political progress is concerned, little more than the dead calm of despotism, our own land, under the glorious principles of its free Constitution, has given every opportunity for that natural conflict between truth and error, which seems to be the established system of the moral universe, and the only means to insure the progress of wise and benificent reforms. Such a state of society has, we may say, almost created \"a new heaven and a new earth,\" and though its convulsions are regarded with amazement by foreign nations, yet we may reasonably suppose, it is because they are comparatively strangers to the travail and pains necessary to the birth and establishment of new ideas. The prominent part which Democratic statesmen have acted in\n\nvi\n\nall the leading questions of public policy, which have for seventy years divided political parties, and the fact that the doctrines they sustained, have without exception, now become the settled policy of our government, lend an additional interest to their history and opinions. Those who have preserved the purity of our republican institutions, and resisted every effort to model our laws after the example of foreign countries, deserve scarcely less honor than those who first established them. We think it will be shown in the following pages, that the distinguished individual whose life and public services have been, we are conscious, but feebly portrayed, has borne no humble or insignificant part in these patriotic and praiseworthy labors. Let no one, however, expect to find in them an elaborate work, or one even commensurate with the just importance of the subject.\n\nThe object of the volume is very simple and definite. When the Hon. James Buchanan was nominated on the 6th of June as a candidate for the Presidency, the public of course became interested to receive a more full and reliable account of his political opinions, than is usually afforded them in the various newspapers of the day. Immediately after his nomination, the writer was applied to, to furnish such an account of his LIFE AND PUBLIC SERVICES, as would promise to meet the demands of the time. The limited period allowed for the preparation of the volume, and the importance of its presentation to the public at as early a day as possible, precluded anything like a studied or careful effort,\n\nvii\n\nsuch, indeed, as its distinguished subject is eminently worthy of. The main point has therefore been to present merely the facts of Mr. Buchanan's career as a public man, and to show his position upon political questions as they have come before him for his consideration. As the limits of the volume did not admit of giving anything like a full report of his public speeches, it was thought advisable to present two or three of his prominent ones upon important public questions, and to limit the extracts from the others mainly to such matters as bear upon the issues now before the country.\n\nAs Mr. Buchanan has ever shunned publicity, and always been averse to courting public favor through the press, no account of his life and important public services to his country, through so many years of active and devoted labors, has been previously published. The writer has, therefore, been compelled to rely mostly upon the simple record of the Congressional proceedings, and a few leading facts which Mr. B. and some of his personal or political friends have been kind enough to furnish. It is proper to say, however, that while we are confident all the statements in this volume, in regard to Mr. Buchanan's private, professional or public life, may be fully relied on as correct, yet no one is responsible for a single line it contains except the writer.\n\nThe haste with which the volume has been prepared, must be regarded as an excuse for any deficiencies which the critic may discover. The writer has been less careful\n\nviii\n\nof literary niceties, than of presenting a reliable, impartial and candid statement of the life and acts of a public man, who on account of the general impression, that he is destined to be the next President of the United States, deservedly occupies a large share of public attention.\n\nNEW YORK, July 4th, 1856.\n\n13\n\nChapter I.\n\nMr. Buchanan's Birthplace.\n\nJAMES BUCHANAN was born at a place called Stony Batter, in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, at the foot of the eastern ridge of the Alleghanies, on the 23d day of April, 1791. Franklin County borders on the State of Maryland, and the greater part of it consists of a broad limestone valley, watered with copious and unfailing mountain springs, and having a soil of unsurpassed fertility. The immense range of mountains known as the Alleghanies, which commences in the northern part of Georgia and Alabama, and runs generally in uniform ridges to the northeastern part of New York, is in Franklin County divided into an irregular series of rocky, broken eminences. The South Mountain, a continuation of the Blue Ridge of Virginia, forms its boundary on the east, and Tuscarora or\n\n14\n\nCove Mountain, on the northwest. The highest points of the Cove Mountain are estimated at fifteen hundred feet above the valley. The spot where Mr. Buchanan first saw the light of day is situated in a wild and romantic gorge of this mountain. The towering summits of the eternal hills surround it, and slope down like the sides of an amphitheatre. A beautiful stream of water, clear as the crystal fountain from which it flows, meanders through what was once a cleared field, not far from his humble birthplace. The remains of the old Buchanan cabin are still to be seen, although little is left but the chimney. They lie to the north of the Mercersburg and McConnellsburg turnpike, but within sight, and about three miles from the village of Mercersburg. It is a lovely spot, and the scenery has all those elements of grandeur and sublimity which serve to inspire in youthful minds noble aspirations and exalted patriotism. Such places have been those where a majority of our great men have been born and reared. The early struggles necessary to contend with the rugged inequalities of nature, have developed a hardy constitution, inspired them with honest ambition, and taught them in early life those invaluable lessons of self-denial which are the foundation of all true excellence of character.\n\nHis Father and Mother.\n\nMr. Buchanan's father was James Buchanan, a native of the County of Donegal, in the north of Ireland, who emigrated to the United States in the year 1783. He was a poor man when he came to America, but with a vigorous arm, an industrious spirit, and untiring perseverance, he acquired before his death a handsome competency. Five years after his arrival he married Elizabeth Speer, the daughter of a respectable farmer of Adams County, Pennsylvania. At that time the broad and beautiful valleys of Franklin County were comparatively a wilderness, but Mr. Buchanan sought them, and with his young wife became a pioneer in American civilization. Having \"staked his claim,\" and erected a rude log cabin, his own right arm felled the trees that allowed the sunlight of heaven to fall\n\n15\n\nupon the little clearing that surrounded his humble home. In this log-cabin was the present James Buchanan born, and there he continued to reside until he was eight years of age. No one would have suspected, had they then seen the log-cabin boy wandering through the primeval forests, awe-struck at the strange, weird scenes which met his gaze, that he would one day hold listening Senates in attention, and stand among the leading statesmen of America. What a commentary do not such facts present upon our free and glorious institutions!\n\nMr. Buchanan's father was a prominent man in the county where he resided, and exercised a large share of influence. He had an excellent English education, and so fully understood the advantages to be derived from one of a more liberal character, that he early resolved that his son should receive it. The mother of Mr. Buchanan was a woman of uncommon intellect. Although she had not enjoyed the advantages of a superior education, she was distinguished for her masculine sense, and remarkable literary taste. It is a singular fact, that although she had never read a criticism on any of the standard poets, she had selected, and could repeat from memory all the striking passages in Pope, Cowper, Milton, and other prominent English poets. She was also a woman of the most exalted and enlightened piety, and to her influence in forming his character and implanting those fundamental principles of conduct which underlie all true greatness is her son, James Buchanan, indebted for his present distinction. It is a common remark, that all great men have superior mothers; whether such be the fact, or whether the idea has arisen from a pardonable partiality of all men for one who was their earliest protector and most devoted friend, we cannot say. But surely in the case of James Buchanan, the remark is strictly true, and no unmeaning compliment.\n\nHis Early Education.\n\nIn 1798, Mr. Buchanan's father removed with his family to the village of Mercersburg, where his son received his early education in English, Latin, and Greek. His progress in his\n\n16\n\nstudies was exceedingly rapid, and he early gave indications of a remarkably strong and comprehensive mind. At the age of fourteen, he entered Dickinson College at Carlisle, in Cumberland county, then under the presidency of Dr. Davidson. Here he immediately took rank among the most indefatigable students, and rapidly rose in the estimation of his teachers as well as his fellow pupils. The acquisition of learning was to him not at all difficult, and he mastered the most abstruse subjects with the utmost facility. The breadth and energy of his mind seemed to grasp everything as if by intuition, and to hold it with great tenacity. It was often remarked of him, that he never went to recitation unprepared. He did not merely learn his lesson, but he conquered it, and so fully and completely elaborated it, that it became his own. While, however, he was a great student, his exuberant flow of animal spirits made him enthusiastic in all kinds of relaxation and amusement. He sometimes surprised the faculty by his practical jokes, and upon one occasion was severely reprimanded for some youthful prank that was considered contrary to the strict rules of collegiate propriety. There was nothing, however, in his amusements, but what was strictly the result of a desire for mere fun; the kindness of his disposition, and the evenness of his temper precluding any thought of anger or malignity.\n\nHis College Life.\n\nWhile in college, he was a member of the Union P. Society, a literary body connected with the institution. All the members of this society were particularly attached to him, and he became its favorite, as, indeed, he was of the entire college. He enjoyed all the honors conferred by this society, and at Commencement was presented by its unanimous vote to the faculty for the highest collegiate honors. He graduated in 1809, at the age of eighteen.\n\nSporting Life in the Back Woods.\n\nAt this period of his life, Mr. Buchanan was tall, slender, and graceful. He had been cradled in poverty, and at all times inured to hardships and toil. He exercised much in the open air, and the forests of Pennsylvania often resounded with\n\n17\n\nthe crack of the rifle of the young sportsman, who, at an early age like nearly all Americans, learned how to use this sharp-shooting weapon. So dexterous was he with his rifle, that like a true back-woodsman, he considered it a disgrace to go home with squirrels or similar game, unless the ball had been sent with unerring precision directly through the head. His studies had expanded, his mind, while his labors and recreations had given strength to his body, and already laid the firm foundation for a long life of uniform health. There can be no doubt that his vigorous, early training has been the means of giving him that wonderful endurance, which so remarkably distinguished him in after-life as a public man. The amount of labor he can perform is perfectly astonishing, and has always been remarked by all who have known him, both while engaged in his profession and in his duties in Congress.\n\nStudy of Law. Admission to the Bar.\n\nIn December, 1809, Mr. Buchanan commenced the study of the law in the office of James Hopkins, Esq., of Lancaster city, an eminent lawyer, and a prominent, valuable, and much-respected citizen. He was admitted to the bar November 17th, 1812, when he was a little over twenty-one years of age. He immediately rose rapidly in his profession. He came to the bar of his native State when Pennsylvania was distinguished far and wide for the superior ability of her lawyers. She could boast then of her Baldwins, her Gibsons, her Rosses, her Duncans, her Breckinridges, her Dallases, and her Semples, who shed not only honor upon their own State, but who added materially to the legal reputation of the whole country. With such men as these Mr. Buchanan was compelled to struggle for that eminence in his profession which he subsequently attained, and so firmly kept. Perhaps we do not go too far in saying, that there never has been in our country an instance of so rapid a rise in the legal profession as that afforded in his case. From the day he was admitted until he finally retired from the legal profession, his was a series of successive triumphs. He was poor, and necessity demanded that exertion which soon made\n\n18\n\nhim the rival and equal of the best lawyers in his State. He was engaged in all important causes tried in Dauphin, York, and other neighboring counties, and his name appears in the Pennsylvania Reports more frequently than that of any other lawyer of his day.\n\nUnparalleled Success.\n\nIn the session of 1816-17 of the Pennsylvania State Senate, when he was only twenty-six years of age, he defended, unassisted by senior counsel, a distinguished judge of his State, who was tried upon articles of impeachment, and was successful. At the age of thirty he had risen to the highest class of legal minds, and commanded a practice more enviable and more extensive than that of any other lawyer in the State. At this time, however, he yielded to the urgent and repeated solicitations of his friends, and consented to become a candidate for Congress. He was elected, and continued in the same position for ten years, when he peremptorily declined a re-election. He occasionally, during the vacations of Congress, tried some important cause, which, from past associations, or other reasons, he did not feel at liberty to decline. He retired, however, from his profession altogether in 1831, having accumulated a competence by his steady devotion to business and the superiority in his profession, which his commanding talents had given him. Avarice being no trait in Mr. Buchanan's character, he gladly sought repose from business, when Providence had blessed his labors with the realization of the sincere prayer of Agar, \"give me neither poverty nor riches.\" When he retired he left more business than any one man could attend to. Thus had the log-cabin-boy, born in a wild and rocky gorge of the Alleghany Mountains, at the early age of forty years, been the architect of his own fortune, and become the admiration and pride of his native State.\n\nOnce only after he left his profession, could he be prevailed upon to again appear at the bar. This was in the cause of an aged widow, where he was appealed to by the most earnest solicitations. It was an action of ejectment which involved\n\n19\n\nall her little property. The case was a difficult one, and technically decidedly against the unfortunate woman. To the surprise and astonishment of every one, he succeeded in establishing her title to the property in question. The poor woman was intoxicated with joy, and overwhelmed her benefactor with expressions of gratefulness, and offers of remuneration. Mr. Buchanan, however, would accept nothing for his services.\n\n20\n\nChapter II.\n\nMr. Buchanan As Volunteer, in the War of 1812.\n\nMr. BUCHANAN early signalized his devotion to his country by acts as well as words. During the war of 1812 with Great Britain, the English army, after having sacked the city of Washington, threatened to attack Baltimore. The high-handed and outrageous act of destroying the public buildings at Washington lighted up a flame of indignant patriotism, which overspread the whole country. A public meeting was called in Lancaster in 1814, for the purpose of obtaining volunteers to march to the defence of Baltimore. On that occasion Mr. Buchanan addressed his fellow-citizens in a speech of great ability, in favor of a vigorous prosecution of the war, which he followed up by registering his name as a volunteer, the first with a number of other young and patriotic hearts. His country called for his services, and, throwing his law books aside, the stripling lawyer thus enrolled himself as a private soldier, willing to take any place if he could but defend the interests of his native land. The company was commanded by Judge Henry Shippen. They marched to Baltimore, and served under the command of Major Charles Sterret Ridgeley until they were honorably discharged. This early stand of Mr. Buchanan in favor of the war of 1812, will show his feelings\n\n21\n\nat that day, and at a time when the country needed the strong arms and stout hearts of its citizens. How senseless and calumnious, then, has been the story that Mr. Buchanan united with the federalists in opposing the war, and who, about the very time that he was shouldering his musket, and assisting to defend the honor and interests of his country, were meeting in a convention at Hartford to make peace with England without the consent of the United States! The whole cause of this calumny is noticed in a frank and manly letter written by Mr. Buchanan in 1847, after taking a seat in Mr. Polk's cabinet, as follows\n\nWASHINGTON, April 23, 1847.\n\n\"MY DEAR SIR: I have this moment received you letter of the 15th inst., and hasten to return an answer.\n\n\"In one respect, I have been fortunate as a public man. My political enemies are obliged to go back for more than thirty years to find plausible charges against me.\n\n\"In 1814, when a very young man (being this day 56 years of age), I made my first public speech before a meeting of my fellow-citizens of Lancaster. The object of this speech was to urge upon them the duty of volunteering their services in defence of their invaded country. A volunteer company was raised upon the spot, in which I was the first, I believe, to enter my name as a private. We forthwith proceeded to Baltimore, and served until we were honorably discharged.\n\nElection To the Legislature in 1814.\n\n\"In October, 1814, I was elected a member of the Pennsylvania legislature; and in that body gave my support to every measure calculated, in my opinion, to aid the country against the common enemy.\n\n\"In 1815, after peace had been concluded, I did express opinions in relation to the causes and conduct of the war, which I very soon after regretted and recalled. Since that period I have been ten years a member of the House of Representatives,\n\n22\n\nand an equal time of the Senate, acting a part every great question. My political enemies, finding nothing assailable throughout this long public career, now resort back to my youthful years, for expressions to injure my political character. The brave and generous citizens of Tennessee, to whatever political party they may belong, will agree that this is a hard measure of justice; and it is still harder that, for this reason, they should condemn the President for havingvoluntarily offered me a seat in his cabinet.\n\n\"I never deemed it proper, at any period of my life, whilst the country was actually engaged in a war with a foreign enemy to utter a sentiment which could interfere with its successful prosecution. Whilst the war with Great Britain was raging, I should have deemed it little better than moral treason to paralyze the arm of the government whilst dealing blows against the enemy. After peace was concluded, the case was then different. My enemies cannot point to an expression uttered by me, during the continuance of the war, which was not favorable to its vigorous prosecution.\n\n\"From your friend, very respectfully,\n\n\"JAMES BUCHANAN.\"\n\nHON. GEORGE W. JONES.\n\nHis Support of the Volunteer System.\n\nMr. Buchanan's active friendship in behalf of his country did not stop with his volunteer campaign. He was elected, in October, 1814, to the Legislature of Pennsylvania, and there assumed the same fearless and patriotic course which had distinguished him throughout the war. An attack was threatened against the city of Philadelphia. The general government was reduced nearly to a state of bankruptcy, and could scarcely raise sufficient money to maintain the regular troops on the remote frontiers of the country. Pennsylvania was obliged to rely upon her own resources for defence, and the people were ready to do their utmost in the cause. Two plans were proposed in\n\n23\n\nthe Legislature; the one was what was called the \"conscription bill,\" and similar to that which was rejected by Congress, by which it was proposed to divide the white male inhabitants of the State, above the age of eighteen, into classes of twenty-two men each, and to designate one man from the members of each class, who should serve one year, each class being compelled to raise a sum of money not exceeding $200, as a bounty to the conscript. During the discussion of these two plans, Mr. Buchanan took an active and highly patriotic stand. In the course of the debate, he said:\n\n\"Since, then, Congress has deserted us in our time of need, there is no alternative but either to protect ourselves by some efficient measures, or surrender up that independence which has been purchased by the blood of our forefathers. No American can hesitate which of these alternatives ought to be adopted. The invading enemy must be expelled from our shores; he must be taught to respect the rights of freemen.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"We need not be afraid to trust to the patriotism or courage of the people of this country when they are invaded. Let them have good militia officers, and they will soon be equal to any troops in the world. Have not our volunteers and militia under General Jackson covered themselves with glory? Have not our volunteers and militia on the Niagara frontier fought in such a manner as to merit the gratitude of the nation? Is it to be supposed that the same spirit of patriotism would animate the man who is dragged out by a conscription law to defend his country, that the volunteer or militia men would feel?\"\n\nThis noble stand, so early taken by Mr. Buchanan, displays a patriotic love of country and shows, even at this early time, his confidence in the people.\n\n24\n\nThe Resolutions of the Connecticut and Massachusetts Legislatures in Regard to Naturalized Citizens.\n\nMr. Buchanan assumed a position at this time, upon the question of the proscription of naturalized citizens, a position he has, through all the fluctuating changes of politics for forty years since, consistently adhered to. The governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut transmitted to the governor of Pennsylvania, and by him sent to the legislature of his own State, resolutions recommending certain amendments to the Constitution of the United States, among which was the following:\n\n\"That no person who shall be hereafter naturalized shall be eligible as a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives of the United States, nor capable of holding any civil office under the authority of the United States.\"\n\nA committee was appointed to report upon this, among their other resolutions. They disapproved of every resolution sent; but we only give as much of their report as relates to the one we have quoted. It is as follows:\n\n\"It may be fairly questioned whether the total exclusion proposed is generous to others, or wise to ourselves. The revolutions of Europe may hereafter drive, as they have already driven, many an honorable and distinguished exile to the shelter of our hospitality. The distance which separates him from his native country is some guarantee that he has not chosen his new residence from any motive of levity, but from deliberate choice, and when he has abjured his allegiance to that country, when his fortunes and family are fixed among us, when he has closed all the avenues to his return, when a long probation has evinced his attachment to our institutions, why should his mind continue still in exile and why should the natural and honorable ambition for political distinction be extinguished for ever in his breast? Why, too, should we deprive ourselves of the choice of such a man, whose European\n\n25\n\nexperience may be useful, if the deliberate voice of the community is in his favor? Other nations do not indulge in so jealous an exclusion. There is scarcely a nation in Europe which does not habitually employ the talents of strangers, wherever they can be most useful.\n\n\"Even in England, the most fastidious of all the nations of Europe, with regard to strangers, naturalization is in many respects more easy than in the United States. Many of the restrictions on aliens may be at once removed by act of parliament, or by the mere wish of the crown; and we can readily call to our recollection, even within the present reign, several officers of high rank, both civil and military, employed in important and confidential stations, by the government of that country. In the United States, moreover, we enjoy a greater security than other nations, from the deliberation with which the choice of our country must be made; the probationary term of residence, and the certainty that no foreigner can rise to power, but by the voluntary suffrage of the community.\n\n\"The number of foreigners now in office does not threaten any inconvenience, and even that number will no doubt rapidly diminish. Out of 182 representatives in Congress, there are, it is believed, not more than four who were born out of the limits of the United States, and in the Senate, not one member. In one respect, too, the operation of the amendment would be injurious, by preventing the employment of American consuls, natives of the countries in which they reside — a practice almost universal among commercial nations. The natural and prudent precautions against foreign influence will, therefore, probably be satisfied, by requiring a long novitiate to wean a stranger from foreign modes of thinking, and insure his attachment to our institutions, and after that ordeal is past, leaving him a fair competition with native talents for political advancement; a competition in which the natural bias in favor of our own countrymen will insure them at least an equal chance of success.\n\n26\n\nThe committee therefore recommend a dissent from the proposed amendment.\"\n\nThe novitiate required at that time was five years, the same as at present, and yet this committee did not see fit to recommend any alteration, but even referred to five years as a long novitiate; for it will be remembered that during a portion of Washington's administration the term had been but two years. Mr. Buchanan concurred fully in this report, indeed it was unanimously adopted in both houses.\n\nRe-election to the Legislature in 1815.\n\nOn October, 1815, Mr. Buchanan was again elected to the legislature, and again he distinguished himself by a patriotic love of country, and by a devotion to its honor and interests which won for him the universal applause of his constituents. It is well known that no State has ever shown a more earnest love for the Union than Pennsylvania. Instead of endeavoring to embarrass the general government in its delicate and often difficult duties, it has when necessity demanded it, come to its assistance. At this session of the legislature a bill was brought in appropriating the sum of $300,000 as a loan to the United States to pay the militia and the volunteers of that State, in the United States service. The general government had been on the verge of bankruptcy, and this patriotic action on the part of Pennsylvania was as noble as its remembrance will ever be grateful, to every lover of his country. This appropriation received the warm support of Mr. Buchanan.\n\nIt was during this session that Mr. Buchanan became impressed with the danger, the inexpediency, and the unconstitutionality of a United States Bank, an opinion he has adhered to ever since, and in the defence of which he has rendered such lasting services to his country in the legislative halls of the nation.\n\nAfter the conclusion of that session Mr. Buchanan applied himself to his profession with great assiduity, and accomplished\n\n27\n\nin five years what it would have taken many men of considerable rank in the law three or four times that period to have achieved. We gave in the first chapter a very brief account of his rapid progress. The prosperity of his career can scarcely be exaggerated. In 1820 he yielded to the solicitations of his friends and became a candidate for Congress, to which position he was elected.\n\nThe Charge of Federalism.\n\nBefore commencing the history of Mr. Buchanan's congressional career it may be well to notice some charges that have been brought forward tending to impeach the consistency of his political conduct. To pass them over in silence might give rise to the suspicion that his acts and opinions are not susceptible of defence, while we confidently assert that there is not one, which does not admit of the most thorough vindication, indeed which does not challenge the closest scrutiny and investigation. Prominent among the charges which have been flippantly made and perseveringly persisted in, is that of federalism. Now, we say most distinctly that had Mr. Buchanan been a federalist, it has nothing whatever to do with issues now before the public; and if it could be shown that he gave good reasons for changing his opinions upon public questions it should not and would not militate against him in the opinion of any sensible man. If therefore, it were a truth that Mr. Buchanan had advocated any of the leading questions of public policy which that once very respectable party supported, we should so set down the fact, and consider him none the less worthy of support or confidence now, if he gave evidence of honesty of intention and stood upon principles essential to the safety and interests of his country. But as we have failed after a careful study of Mr. Buchanan's public life to find any support for the charge brought against him by those who seem to be but indifferently acquainted with our political history, we have thought a notice of the matter in this place demanded by the integrity of history.\n\n28\n\nOriginally, the name of federal was as honorable a designation as any other. It took its rise from those who approved of our federal Constitution, whilst those who felt that the government was too consolidated, called themselves anti-federalists or republicans; but after the Constitution was adopted, and it was accepted as the fundamental, organic law of the land, as Jefferson truly remarked, \"We are all federalists, we are all republicans.\" After the adoption of the Constitution, therefore, the term federal, so far as its primary signification was concerned, had no meaning. But in a few years it was soon discovered that the very men who had approved most earnestly of the Constitution, began to claim for it doubtful powers, and to give it a liberal construction. Mr. John Adams, the second President, was the first who boldly inaugurated this policy, and by the passage of the alien and sedition laws, overwhelmed himself and his party in disgrace. This was the first stain on the otherwise fair name of federal. Then came the war of 1812, when they completed their ruin as a party, not by opposing the war in a reasonable manner, but by an odious and unconstitional opposition, which finally terminated in a traitorous convention in New England, to make a separate peace with Great Britain. These two acts destroyed the federal party, and brought upon the name an odious reproach. It will not be pretended by any one that Mr. Buchanan approved either of the measures to which we have referred. The principles of the federal party were, however, as we have before observed, in favor of claiming from Congress the exercise of doubtful powers, in opposition to the doctrine of State rights as embraced in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions of 1798. They also claimed the power in Congress to establish a United States bank. Yet, upon Mr. Buchanan's first appearance in public life, we find him announcing himself as opposed to a bank of this kind, and denying the power of Congress to establish such an institution. Now, there is no sense or propriety in calling any man a federalist, who has not advocated\n\n29\n\nor supported federal doctrines. Yet there is not an enemy of Mr. Buchanan who can point to a single act of his life which is contrary to the doctrine of State rights, or to a strict construction of the Constitution. From first to last, from beginning to end, he has adhered steadily to this political faith. In the general disruption of parties after the war of 1812, he may have technically ranked with the federal party, but he certainly never supported' a single one of its measures, as the reader who peruses the remaining pages of this volume will be fully convinced.\n\nBut even had Mr. Buchanan seen reasons for changing his opinions, and doubtless he has upon some public questions, who is there to reproach him for such a course? Where is the man, who in the period of forty years' experience in public life, has not changed? To suppose men not susceptible of an honest alteration of opinion, would be to expect that they come perfect from the hand of their Maker; or else that they were either so dull, that the instruction which experience furnishes, is incapable of making any impression upon them; or that they were so obstinate and self-willed, as to adhere to opinions after they had been convinced they were erroneous. Full-fledged Minervas do not, in these days, spring from Jupiter's head, any more than full-grown men, physically as well as mentally, enter the world to astonish those who have been exploring its mysteries, sometimes with only partial success, for years. All that the people can justly demand of any public man, is, that his course has not been erratic or irregular, and that, if upon any occasion he has changed his opinions, it has the appearance of honesty of purpose, and the excuse of public interest. But with all our study of Mr. Buchanan's career, and we say it without the least particle of anything like a partisan bias, we have failed to discover any change of any of the\n\n30\n\nwho do not imbibe some false principles, which more mature judgment convinces them are erroneous. All who peruse Mr. Buchanan's congressional career of twenty years, will be fully convinced that, for an exemplary devotion to great principles, and a consistent and honorable bearing upon all questions, he is not excelled by any living statesman.\n\n31\n\nChapter III.\n\nMilitary Appropriations.\n\nTHE year 1820 was one of great financial embarrassment. The Bank of the United States, which had been chartered in 1816, had in less than four years proved how delusive were the hopes and expectations of its friends. It had created one of those vast expansions of paper currency which are only the precursors of a calamity more wide-spread and destructive than any prosperity it could produce was satisfactory or desirable. The distress was universal, and pervaded public as well as private affairs. Mr. Benton in his \"Thirty Years' View,\" speaking of this disastrous period of our national history, says:\n\n\"No price for property or produce; no sales but those of the Sheriff and the Marshal; no purchasers at the executive sales but the creditor or some hoarder of money; no employment for industry, no demand for labor; no sale for the product of the farm; no sound of the hammer but that of the auctioneer knocking down property. Stop laws, property laws, replevin laws, stay laws, loan office laws, the intervention of the legislator between the creditor and the debtor — this was the business of legislation in three-fourths of the States of the Union of all south and west of New England. No medium of exchange but depreciated paper; no change even, but little bits of foul paper, marked so many cents, and signed by some trader, barber, or inn-keeper. Exchanges deranged to the extent of fifty or one hundred per cent. Distress the universal cry of the\n\n32\n\npeople; relief the universal demand thundered at the doors of all legislatures, State and Federal.\"\n\nIt was in such a social convulsion as this that the citizens of Lancaster county turned their thoughts upon James Buchanan, then only twenty-nine years of age, as their candidate for representative in Congress. Serious, thoughtful, and considerate, he was, wherever known, regarded as worthy of the utmost confidence. The warm and ardent friend of Mr. Monroe's administration, he contributed not a little in promoting that universal popularity which elevated that distinguished individual almost unanimously the second time to the presidential chair. Mr. Buchanan was elected in the fall of 1820, and took his seat in the seventeenth Congress, in December, 1821.\n\nThis was immediately succeeding the stormy session of 1820, when the difficulties in regard to the admission of Missouri had been adjusted, by the adoption of the first concession ever made to the anti-slavery or abolition sentiment of the country. The attempt was boldly made when Missouri applied for admission into the Union, to exclude her unless she would come in as a State with laws refusing to recognise the right of property interest in the labor and services of negroes. This unconstitutional demand upon her was successfully resisted, and finally only one clause in her Constitution was excepted to as constituting a ground of ultimate rejection. This was a section prohibiting the emigration of free negroes into the State. It was urged by the anti-slavery party of that day, that this was in contradiction to the clause of the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to any citizen of any of the States of the Union equal privileges in all the States, of which privileges the right of emigration was one. It was held, that if negroes were admitted to citizenship in some States, they would be deprived of it by the terms of the Constitution of Missouri. It was successfully replied to this, that the Constitution did not regard persons of this race as citizens, and that the framers of the government expressly stated that it was formed \"for\n\n33\n\nthem and their posterity,\" of whom negroes could form no part. The objection, however, was a mere pretext, the real cause of the opposition to the admission of Missouri being the existence of negro servitude in the State. This is abundantly proved from the fact that the anti-slavery party have long since abandoned the ground then assumed, and many of the western States now have stringent laws in regard to the admission of free negroes, without any objection being raised as to the right of a State to pass such acts in regard to the status of the negro, as it may in its sovereign capacity think proper for its own welfare. Even the \"Free State Constitution of Kansas,\" recently so earnestly advocated by the anti-slavery press of the present day, contained an express prohibition to the immigration of free negroes. The objectionable clause in the Constitution of Missouri was finally so modified by the exertions of Mr. Clay, that a resolution was reported in favor of the admission of the State, upon condition that the legislature should first declare that the clause in her Constitution relative to free colored immigration should never be construed to authorize the passage of any act by which any citizen of any of the States of the Union should be excluded from the enjoyment of every privilege to which he may be entitled under the Constitution of the United States. When this was done, the President was to declare Missouri admitted, by proclamation. This resolution passed the House of Representatives by only four majority, Mr. Randolph and other southern members opposing it with all their might. The Missouri restriction bill of 36° 30', sometimes called \"the Missouri Compromise,\" was also acquiesced in by the same Congress, upon the supposition that this concession to the demands of the anti-slavery sentiment would be a quietus to the agitation of the matter. Subsequent events, however, proved how delusive was this hope, and how dangerous it is to yield even the slightest constitutional right to the demands of a delusion which is propagated mainly for the purpose of acquiring political power. The overthrow of one right\n\n34\n\nonly paves the way for the destruction of another still more important; and the party thus emboldened by success, will continue its lawlessness until it rides over every barrier of the Constitution, and prostrates every right which is not sanctioned by its own insane creed, or until it installs civil war in order to carry out its exclusive doctrines.\n\nMr. Buchanan's entrance to Congress was immediately subsequent to these events. The proclamation of Mr. Monroe had admitted Missouri as one of the States of the Confederacy during the summer of 1821. The country had been agitated with a long and fearful conflict, and all parties, after the settlement made by the preceding Congress, were but too glad to turn their attention from a subject which had threatened in so imminent a degree the safety of the Union, to others more practical in their character. The depression of the times suggested many of these, and the Congress of 1821 — 22 had therefore a great deal of business upon its hands which in the excited state of the public mind on the Missouri question, had been neglected.\n\nThe array of talent on the floor of Congress when Mr. Buchanan arrived in Washington was impressive and commanding. In the House were the ever memorable names of McDuffie, Joel R. Poinsett, John Randolph, Philip P. Barbour, Andrew Stevenson, Louis McLane, and others equally distinguished. In the Senate were Rufus King, Martin Van Buren, Mahlon Dickerson, Samuel L. Southard, Nathaniel Macon, and Richard M. Johnson. Mr. Buchanan immediately took rank among the most industrious and indefatigable members of the House. He was always in his seat, and generally participated in every debate upon any important public question. The first set speech which Mr. Buchanan delivered in Congress was upon a bill making appropriations to the military, for some deficiencies that had occurred in the Indian department. He so ably defended he course of Mr. Crawford, then Secretary of the Treasury, that the \"National Intelligencer\" at the request, of several gentlemen departed from its usual course, and gave a verbatim\n\n35\n\nreport of his speech. As this was the first effort of Mr. Buchanan on the floor of Congress, and as it gave an earnest of the future distinction that awaited him, we give it entire, with the exception of a small portion mostly taken up with statistics. It was delivered on the 11th of January, 1822. Mr. Buchanan rising said: —\n\n\"Mr. CHAIRMAN: On Friday last, when the House adjourned, I did believe that the subject now before the Committee was involved in doubt and in mystery. I thought that a dark cloud hung over the transaction, which ought to be cleared up before the House could give its sanction to this appropriation. After a careful examination the mystery has vanished — the cloud has been dispelled, and to my view the subject appears clear as the light of day. If it had not, my vote would be given against the appropriation, because in a Republican government doubt and mystery, in any measure proposed by the Executive department, should always be sufficient to prevent it from receiving the support of the House.\n\n\"In the remarks which I propose to submit, it will be my endeavor to communicate to the Committee the reasons upon which I have come to the determination to give this appropriation my unqualified support. If I should be wrong, there are many gentlemen in the House whose judgment and whose experience will enable them to correct my errors.\n\n\"Nice distinctions have been drawn between a just confidence in the Executive departments, and an unreasonable jealousy of their conduct, on the one side; and on the other, between that confidence and a belief in their infallibility. Extremes in such case are very dangerous. Whilst unreasonable jealousy of men in power keeps the public mind in a state of constant agitation and alarm, a blind reliance upon their infallibility, may enable them to destroy the liberties of the people before they are aware of the existence of danger. At the same time, therefore, that I trust, I am one of the last men in the\n\n36\n\nHouse who would consent to establish the office of dictator in the commonwealth, or to believe in the infallibility of mortals in politics more than in religion — yet I should think it wrong to withhold from a public officer that degree of confidence which assumes that he has acted correctly, until the contrary appears. It ought to be a maxim in politics, as well as in law, that an officer of your government, high in the confidence of the people, shall be presumed to have done his duty, until the reverse of the proposition is proved.\n\n\"These observations are made, not because I believe have any bearing upon the present question, but simply in answer to those used by gentlemen who have argued upon the opposite side. The Secretary of War, upon the present occasion, requires not the aid of presumptions in his favor, because, to my mind at least, there is the most full, satisfactory, and self-evident proof.\n\n\"Before I come to the principal question, Mr. Chairman, permit me to answer one of the arguments which has been eloquently and ingeniously urged by the gentlemen opposed to this appropriation.\n\n\"It has been said, with truth, that the Constitution provides ‘that no money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.’ It is certain that the provision is the best security for the liberties of the people in the whole of the instrument. Once transfer this branch of power, vested in Congress by the Constitution, to the Executive, and your freedom is but an empty name. That department of the government, having then the command of the purse, might very soon assume the power of the sword.\n\n\"Has the Secretary of War violated this salutary provision? Has he drawn money out of the treasury without an appropriation made by law for that purpose? Unquestionably not. So far from asking you to sanction such an unconstitutional measure, he is now requesting you to make an appropriation to supply a deficiency in the means which you had provided to enable him to\n\n37\n\ndischarge positive duties, enjoined upon him by your own laws\n\n\"Whether this deficiency shall be supplied out of the public purse or the Secretary be made responsible in his private capacity to those with whom he has made contracts on the faith of the government, is the only question now before the committee.\n\n\"Here let me ask gentlemen why they are so much alarmed at the fact that the appropriation has proved deficient? Deficiencies must and will occur so long as the men who wield the destinies of this government are fallible. Nothing short of the spirit of prophecy can prevent them from happening, unless Congress should think proper to make such overwhelming appropriations as would be sufficient to cover all contingencies, not only probable but possible. They existed even whilst the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Randolph) was chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means. I speak the honest sentiments of my heart, when I declare that, in my opinion, he possessed as much penetration as any gentleman who ever occupied that distinguished station. Calculate, with the nicest precision, the future probable expenses of any department of the government, and in the course of the year for which the estimate is made, suppose there should be no events of extraordinary occurrence, still it will be a miracle, if ever the appropriation shall be exactly equal to all the necessary expenditures.\n\n\"At the instant of time when the sum appropriated is expended in executing your laws, would you have the wheels of government to stop? Would you declare that all your public agents who had served you faithfully should receive no compensation, merely because either you or your Secretary of War, in the beginning of the year, could not foresee the expenses which might be incurred before its end?\n\n\"Take, for example, the army; admit, for the sake of argument, that which is impossible even in times of the most profound tranquility — that you had estimated the future annual expense\n\n38\n\nto a fraction, and had made an appropriation accordingly Suppose, that during the recess of Congress, political storms should envelop your country, that treason at home, or war from abroad, were about to disturb your peace, and that the point of meditated attack was within the knowledge of your executive: under such circumstances, would the President of the United States be justified, either to his conscience or to his constituents, if he were not to march the army from all quarters of the Union to the district in danger? What would you then think of his justification, if he informed you that he neglected to provide for the common defence, because the army appropriation was too small to enable him to embody the forces? Such conduct would be treason against the Republic.\n\n\"Your security in all cases of this kind, arises from that admirable provision of the Constitution, which declares that no money shall be drawn from the treasury but under the authority of the law. When any officer of the government applies for the passage of a bill to supply a deficiency, you always inquire into the reasons why it has occurred; and if his conduct upon examination is found to be correct, you will, as you have always hitherto done, supply the deficiency.\n\n\"This course of policy is not only necessary in itself, but it gives you a much greater control over the public purse, than if, in the beginning of the year, you were to make your appropriations sufficiently large to cover all contingencies. Such conduct would be a powerful, temptation to the officer to become extravagant in the expenditure of public money.\n\n\"Let us then inquire, whether it was necessary that the sum of $170,000 should have been expended in the Indian departing during the year 1821, to carry into effect the spirit and intention of the different acts of Congress?\n\n\"It has been urged, that as Congress appropriated but $100,000 to defray the current expenses of that department during the last year, the Secretary was bound to confine himself within that amount. The necessary consequence would be,\n\n39\n\nthat the laws establishing that branch of our policy, were in this manner, at least in part, repealed.\n\n\"This is I confess, the first occasion on which I have ever heard that a system of laws which had received a fixed construction by the practice of the nation for more than twenty years, could be repealed, not by withdrawing the whole, but a part of appropriation necessary to carry them into effect. If this were the case, it would give to estimates, uncertain in their very nature, the effect of expunging from our statute-book the most wholesome regulations. Nay, more, it would be delegating legislative powers to the head of a department, and would introduce the very evil against which gentlemen are so anxious to guard. By this construction, if there be laws in existence enjoining a variety of duties on any officer of the government, and if, to enable him to discharge all those duties, an annual expenditure of $170,000 is necessary, your appropriation of but $100,000 for that purpose would make him the legislator, instead of yourselves. You thus necessarily vest in him the power of deciding what parts of the system shall remain in vigor, and what part shall fall before his power. In order to ascertain what laws are repealed, you would be obliged to resort, not to your statute-book, but to the head of a department. Even then they would be forever varying, because, whilst he confined himself within his appropriation, he might at his pleasure range through the whole system as it originally stood, and select from it such parts as he thought proper to carry into effect. This is not the manner in which Congress ever will, or ever can, manifest their intention. If they desire to reduce the expenses of any department of the government themselves will lop off every branch which they deem superfluous, and not leave if to the discretion of any executive officer no matter how exalted his station. Whilst, however certain duties are enjoined on any department of the government by acts of Congress, or by treaties, we are bound to supply the officer with the means necessary to the performance of those\n\n40\n\nduties. If, in such a case, our appropriation has been insufficient, we ought at once to supply the deficiency.\n\n\"This system, so eminently calculated to preserve tranquility around our borders, and to prevent the intrigues of another nation from obtaining for them an undue ascendency over the minds of the savages has been long established, and was as much incorporated into your policy as that of sending ambassadors to foreign courts. Did Congress express any disapprobation of this system. Did they destroy any part of it by the bill which appropriated $100,000 for the current expenses of the year? Did they intend that the Secretary should destroy the objects of ascertained or of contingent expense? Both had been equally provided for, by your laws, and by your treaties. Did Congress mean either that the Indians should receive no rations at your military posts, or that no presents should be given to them, or that they should be deprived of the benefit of receiving agricultural instruments from your hands? If they did, they have expressed no such determination by any law. The consequence of the construction contended for is, that if they intended anything, by appropriating but $100,000, it was to enable the Secretary to legislate in your behalf, and to repeal so much of existing laws and existing treaties as would reduce the expense to $100,000. This he had no power to do, and to allow him to exercise it would establish a most dangerous precedent against the liberties of this people. It would be to allow an officer to stop the wheels of government and paralyze the energies of the law the moment the appropriation which had been made was expended.\n\n\"Could the Secretary have ever supposed that you intended to destroy any part of this establishment? Certainly not, because the expenditures are most just as well as most politic. You have driven that noble race of men from the hunting grounds which God and nature intended for their support. You have caused intestine wars to rage continually among them, by driving remote tribes near together, and thus making it necessary\n\n41\n\nto their existence that they should invade the hunting grounds of each other. During the very last year, it appears from the letter of the Secretary that the disbursements have been increased by the emigration of the Indians from the States of Ohio Indiana, and Illinois, beyond the Mississippi. After thus crowding them together, you make them waste their scanty supply of game by inducing them to destroy it without necessity, so that you may obtain their fur to gratify your appetite for luxury. In this situation, to which they have been reduced by our policy, the laws have provided that, when the cravings of hunger shall drive these children of the forest to your military posts, either on the frontier or in their own territory they shall receive food; that in order to preserve their existence and enable them to live upon the circumscribed limits within which they have been driven, they should be taught agriculture, and receive the implements of husbandry; that, when their chiefs think proper to visit your metropolis, you will enable them to do so by paying their expenses, and thus manifest to them the extent of both your power and your friendship. In short, all the other provisions, which our laws and our treaties have made for them, and which I shall not detail, are founded, not only in the strictest justice, but in the wisest policy.\n\n\"Did Congress intend, by the mere act of appropriating $100,000 for the current expenses of the last year, that the head of a department should alter the laws of the land, and that he might at his will declare what part of the Indian system should be in force, and what part should be considered as repealed? Was it, for example, their determination that no treaties should be held with the Indians, however necessary they might have been, because the Secretary had thought proper to apply the whole of your appropriations to other objects? This never could have been their intention. Congress alone have the power of changing this system of policy, whenever they think proper to do so, by unequivocal legislative acts; then, and not till then, does it become the duty of executive officers\n\n42\n\nobey. They dare not sooner neglect to carry existing law and treaties into effect.\n\n\"Suppose the Secretary had thought proper materially to alter our policy towards the Indians, and the first information you had heard of the change was, as it probably would have been, the howl of savage warfare around your borders, and the shrieks of helpless women and children under the scalping-knife could you then have justified his conduct? Would you the have told him that he had the power of altering the whole system, because a sufficient appropriation had not been made to keep it in motion till the end of the year? And this, too, when the very sentence before the appropriation of $100,000 provide that $130,205 44 should be drawn from the treasury to cover past arrearages in the Indian department? The legitimate meaning of a reduction in the appropriation was not to destroy any part of our policy towards the Indians, but to warn the Secretary to use the strictest economy in carrying every part of it into effect. It has produced that happy result. He has informed you that the expenses of the present year will not exceed $150,000. This sum is upwards of $85,000 less than, upon an average, was appropriated to the same purpose, in each year, from 1815 to 1820, both inclusive. It is but a few thousand dollars more than was expended for the use of the same department for each of the two last years of Mr. Jefferson. In the meantime, our relations with the Indians have been greatly extended with our extending frontier, and we have become acquainted with tribes, of which before we had never even heard the names. This great curtailment of expense places the character of the present Secretary, in this particular, upon an exalted eminence; and the more so, as it is well known that not one cent more of money was expended by the administration of Mr. Jefferson than was necessary to accomplish its objects.\n\n\"But suppose, for the sake of argument, that the Secretary ought to have inferred from your appropriation bill that you intended he should change the Indian system, still we should\n\n43\n\nvote the $70,000 to supply the deficit. If we do not, we require that he should have performed miracles.\n\n\"This system has been in constant and in vigorous operation since 1802. For six years before the passage of the last appropriation bill, its average annual expense had been more than $235 000. That bill did not pass until the 3d of March. Before that time, it has not been alleged that there had been a whisper of disapprobation against the former appropriations for the Indian Department. On the contrary, during that period, $200,000 at least had been appropriated every year; and, in addition, large deficiencies had been supplied, without a murmur. The Secretary, acting under a firm conviction that the same system would be pursued, had taken the measures necessary to continue its motion for another year, some time before the passage of the bill. The places at which the money was principally to be expended, were agencies upon the borders of your vast empire, far beyond the utmost limits of civilization. The distance to many of them is so remote, and the communication so precarious, that the Secretary has informed you they cannot be heard from more than twice, and often but once, in the whole course of the year.\n\n\"Could the motion of this vast machinery be at once suspended? In the beautiful language of the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Lowndes) it had received its impulse before the passage of the bill, and the momentum could not be withdrawn from it in a shorter period of time than one year. To require the Secretary, therefore to stop it immediately, would have been asking him to do that which was utterly impossible.\n\nThese, Mr. Chairman, are the remarks which I conceived it to be my duty to make on the subject now before the committee. I have, personally, no feeling of partiality for the Secretary of War, nor of prejudice against him. I view him merely as a public character, and in that capacity I conscientiously believe that upon the present occasion he has done his duty and acted in the only manner in which he could constitutionally\n\n44\n\nact. In my opinion, therefore, he deserves applause, instead of censure.\n\n\"One other view of the subject, Mr. Chairman, and I shall have done. In whatever light the conduct of the secretary may appear, still the deficit ought to be supplied. This case does not require such an argument; but suppose, for a moment he had acted improperly, is this one of those extreme cases for I admit that such may possibly exist — in which the House should withhold an appropriation to supply a deficiency? Will any gentleman say, that individuals who have fairly and honestly entered into contracts with your Secretary of War on the faith of the government shall suffer? Surely, you would not impose the task on every person who binds himself by agreement, to form services for the government, to inquire whether the appropriation made by Congress justified his employment. If you did, he then becomes responsible for what in the nature of things cannot be within his knowledge. To enable him to ascertain whether he might safely contract with the head of one of your executive departments, he should be informed, not only of the amount of appropriations, but in what manner their expenditure has proceeded, and is proceeding, in every part of the Union. It would be crying injustice to inform the men who have abandoned civilized life, and undergone all the dangers, the hardships and the privations of dwelling among savages in the wilderness, for the purpose of promoting the interest and the glory of their country, that they shall receive no compensation for their services, because the secretary who employed them has exceeded his appropriation. This would be making the innocent suffer instead of the guilty; if, therefore, there has been any impropriety in the conduct of the Secretary, as some gentlemen have insinuated, but which I utterly deny, it is a question which should be settled between you and him, and one in the decision of which the rights of the persons employed under his authority ought not to be involved. Indeed, no gentlemen has yet said that these men ought not to be paid out of the public treasury.\n\n45\n\nWhy then, considering this question in every point of view in which it can be presented, is there any objection against voting $70,000 to supply the deficiency in the appropriation of the last year? I hope it will pass without further difficulty.\"\n\nBankrupt Bill.\n\nMr. Buchanan seems to have been uncommonly active during the whole period of the first session he was in Congress. Nothing that affected the interests of his constituents was allowed to pass unnoticed. Indeed Mr. B. seems to have entertained from the start the idea that he was strictly the servant of the people who had elected him, and that in his capacity of representative in Congress, he was bound to attend, first of all, to the concerns of his immediate district. While he was strict in the expenditure of money he was liberal where patriotism made the demand. When some members found fault with a bill authorizing the relief of soldiers disabled in the revolutionary war, Mr. Buchanan met the opposition with the remark that the amount the bill proposed to appropriate \"was a scanty pittance for the war-worn soldier,\" and that he was altogether averse to opposing a matter of so trifling a character, where the demands of patriotism were so imperative. Among other things which engaged his attention, and upon which he made speeches, were the Apportionment Bill Transactions in Florida, the Bankrupt Bill, Appropriation Bill, and other matters of minor importance. Various charges had been brought against Gen. Jackson's conduct in Florida, the most prominent of which were that he had usurped authority and actually violated the laws of his country. Mr. Buchanan then a warm friend of Gen. Jackson, was among the most earnest to have them investigated. Speaking upon this subject he remarked, \"that the most serious consequences might be expected to result, if, after charges of this sort were made against an individual, the House should avoid meeting the question — should put them to sleep by permanently laying them on the table. He, for one, was willing to meet the proper responsibility of declaring his opinion, either of the guilt or innocence\n\n46\n\nof this distinguished individual.\" It is scarcely necessary to remark that these charges trumped up against Gen. Jackson by his enemies were not sustained.\n\nThe most important speech that Mr. Buchanan made at this session of Congress was one on a Bankrupt Law, which was powerfully advocated by several of the most distinguished debaters on the floor of the House. There probably never has been a time in the history of our country so opportune as the one which the opponents of the democracy of that day took to bring about \"a uniform system of bankruptcy.\" The universal prostration of commercial affairs, the general and wide spread disasters which seemed to be the inevitable fate of all classes, and the constant cry for relief which was thundering at the doors of every legislative body were enough to make the best grounded in democratic principles waver. The bill was drawn up in the most seductive form. Its operation was to continue only three years, when it expired, unless all branches of the government should concur in re-enacting it. It was shown by the friends of the bill that there was an unexampled number of insolvent debtors, and they contended that a large majority of these individuals were really innocent, and merely unfortunate men, reduced to their embarrassments by the unforeseen disasters of the times. It was shown, that by a rapid transition the country had passed from a state of unexampled prosperity to a condition of commercial and financial ruin, to which no precedent could be shown in the history of the nation. England and all the continental countries had Bankrupt laws, and why should not the United States? The law was held up as a benefit to all classes, and one imperatively demanded by the peculiar condition of the times. Mr. Buchanan did not participate in the debate, which was long and very animated, until late in the session and just before the bill came up for final reading. Then he delivered one of the most powerful and eloquent speeches of the session, taking decided ground against so unequal and unjust a law — one intended merely to encourage the wildest speculations,\n\n47\n\nand tending to destroy public as well as private credit. The speech is quite a lengthy one, but it will amply repay perusal, as well for the just sentiments it contains as for its eloquent and triumphant vindication of public and private honesty, and the rights of the people. It was delivered on the 12th of March, 1822.\n\n\"Mr. SPEAKER: Before the amendment proposed by the gentleman from Kentucky had obtained the sanction of this House, the question whether the bill should be engrossed for a third reading was one of very great importance. That question has, however, dwindled into insignificance compared with the one at present under consideration. We are now called upon to decide the fate of a measure of awful importance. The most dreadful responsibility rests upon us. We are not now to determine merely whether a bankrupt law shall be extended to the trading classes of the community but whether it shall embrace every citizen of this Union and spread its demoralizing influence over the whole surface of society.\n\n\"The amendment which has been adopted today makes it my imperative duty, even at this protracted period of the debate, to trespass upon the patience of the House. I have the honor in part of representing an honest, a wealthy, and a respectable, agricultural community. I owe to them, to my conscience and to my God not to suffer this bill to pass, which I conceive to be now fraught with destruction to their best interests, both moral and political, without entering my solemn protest against its provisions. We have heard it repeated over and over again by the friends of a bankrupt bill that it should be confined by the mercantile classes. One of the principal arguments urged in its favor by its eloquent supporters, was that merchants from the nature of their pursuits were exposed to the vicissitudes of fortune more than other men, and that, therefore, their situation required a peculiar system of laws.\n\n\"That in this country their fortunes had not only been exposed\n\n48\n\nto the dangers commonly incident to their profession, but that the commercial regulations of the government, the embargo, the non-intercourse laws, and, finally the war, had brought ruin upon thousands. It was, therefore, inferred that Congress were under a moral obligation to pass a bankrupt law for their relief. The policy of all the modern commercial nations in the world was presented before us for our imitation; England, France, Scotland, Ireland, Holland, and Spain, we had been told, each extended a bankrupt law to the merchant, and absolved him from the payment of his debts upon certain conditions. Indeed, a great portion of the argument consisted in drawing a line of distinction between traders and the remaining classes of society. Judge then, Mr. Speaker, of my astonishment when, to-day, I found these gentlemen voting in favor of this introducing an amendment extending the provisions of this bill to every individual in society who might ask to become its object. Will you pass a bankrupt law for the farmer? Will you teach that vast body of your best citizens to disregard the faith of contracts? Are you prepared to sanction a principle by which the whole mass of society will be in danger of being demoralized? and it will be left to an election by every man's creditors, in which a majority of two-thirds in number and value against the consent of the remainder, shall have the power of discharging him from the obligation of all his contracts. Surely the House of Representatives are not prepared to answer these questions in the affirmative. No nation in the world, whether commercial or agricultural, whether civilized or savage, has ever for a moment entertained the idea of extending the operation of their bankrupt laws beyond the class of traders. Fortunately for our constituents, we have not the power of doing so. The Constitution correctly expounded has proclaimed, ‘hitherto shalt thou go, but no further.’\n\n\"Nothing but a desperate effort to revive this expiring bill could have ever induced its friends to have adopted the amendment\n\n49\n\nwhich has just now been carried. In the discussion of this question, I can assure the House, it is not my intention to travel over the ground which has been already occupied, or repeat the argument which has been already urged. The subject naturally divides itself into two questions — the one of Constitutional power, the other of policy. On the first, as the bill stood before the introduction of the last amendment, I had not a single doubt. Much as I would have deprecated the passage of the then bill, I should have been infinitely more alarmed if this House had determined that the enactment of such a law transcended the constitutional power of Congress. Upon this branch of the subject, the ingenious arguments of the gentleman from Virginia had not created a doubt in my mind.\n\nInternal Improvements.\n\n\"Where doubts before did exist, the argument of the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Lowndes), and of my honorable colleague (Mr. Sergeant) were, in my opinion, calculated entirely to remove them, and to carry conviction to every understanding. A new question of constitutional power has now arisen on the amendment. The Constitution declares that ‘the Congress shall have power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States.’ To this provision I am willing to give a fair and a liberal construction. Congress have the power to discharge from their debts on the terms prescribed by the bill, all persons upon whom a law emanating from the clause of the Constitution may legitimately act.\n\nBut can Congress make a law extending the penalties and the privileges of a bankrupt system to every individual in society? Can they embrace in its provision the farmer, the clergyman the physician, or the lawyer? Such a proposition was never seriously contended for before this day.\n\n\"By considering the meaning of the term bankrupt, we shall be able at once to solve the difficulty. In adverting to its origin, we find the literal signification of the word to be a spoken counter, which by a figure of speech has been applied in our language to a broken merchant. In the commercial laws\n\n50\n\nof all the nations of the continent of Europe, bankruptcy is confined to merchants in the strictest sense of the word. The operation of the bankrupt laws of England has been extended by judicial construction somewhat further, and they now embrace within their grasp, not only the merchant properly so called, but all persons who are traders, and are concerned in buying and selling any kind of merchandise, unless they have been expressly excepted by some positive legislative provision. This exposition of the law extends not only to those who sell any commodity in the same state in which they purchase it, but also to the manufacturer and the mechanic who bestow upon it their labor and their skill, and thus render it more valuable. The bill, as it formerly stood, confined itself strictly within this range. Indeed, it was more circumscribed as to the persons on whom it would have operated than the bankrupt laws of England. I am willing, then, to expound the powers of Congress upon the subject liberally.\n\n\"In construing the Constitution, Congress ought not to be fettered by nice technical rules. I admit that they have the power, whenever they think proper to call it into exercise, of establishing a system of bankruptcy which shall embrace all persons who have ever been embraced even by the bankrupt laws of England. Further than this they cannot proceed, without extending the plain meaning of the word, bankruptcy, as it has been received by every commercial nation of Europe, and violating both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution. I making this admission, I am sensible that many may suppose I am giving a latitude of construction to the instrument which is not warranted by its spirit.\n\n\"The authority to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States, is contained in a clause of the Constitution, which immediately follows, that to regulate commerce with Foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes. The power over bankruptcy evidently originated from, and is closely connected with\n\n51\n\nthat over commerce. This commerce which Congress has the power of regulating, is chiefly, if not exclusively, conducted by merchants, in the strictest sense of the term, and principally by that class of them denominated importers. They are the men most exposed to the vicissitudes of trade, and, on that account, are more properly the object of such a law than people of any other description. It might, therefore, with much plausibility, be commended, that the power of Congress over bankruptcy is confined to that description if merchants. Another argument, which would give additional strength to this construction, arises from the general spirit of the Federal Institutions. They do not propose to embrace the internal policy of the States. The jurisdiction of the federal courts is confined by the Constitution to controversies between citizens of the different States, and between foreigners and citizens of the United States. To such suits the men who carry on the intercourse with foreign nations, and between the different States, are most generally parties.\n\n\"The object which I have in view in using these arguments, is not to prove that the constitutional power of Congress is confined to such merchants, but to show that it is contrary to the nature and the spirit of our government to extend it to all classes of people in the community. The bill as it stood before the amendment, went quite far enough. It would even then have brought the operation of the law, and the jurisdiction of the federal courts into the bosom of every community. The bill, however, as it now stands, if it should pass, will entirely destroy the symmetry of our system, and make those courts the arbiters, in almost every case of contract to which any member of society who thinks proper to become a bankrupt, may be a party. It will at once be, in a great degree, a judicial consolidation of the Union. This was never intended by the framers of the Constitution. Some of the terrible evils which would flow from such a system, I shall have reason to delineate, when I come to speak of the policy of its adoption.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\n52\n\n\"I shall now proceed to lay before the House my objections to the passage of this bill; as it now stands, certain classes of society are exposed to its adverse operations upon the commission of any of the acts of bankruptcy described in its first section. Every individual in the community, including those embraced by the bill previous to the late amendment, may become voluntary bankrupts. It will be necessary here briefly to inquire who may be declared bankrupts against their will. The adverse operation of the law will not be confined to wholesale and retail merchants, strictly speaking, and to dealers in exchange, bankers, brokers, factors, underwriters, and marine insurers. By the construction which has been placed upon the words, \"other persons actually using the trade of merchandise by buying and selling in gross or by retail,\" not only every dealer in any article, but every manufacturer or mechanic who purchases any material, bestows his skill and labor upon it, an sells it in its improved state, falls within the compulsory branch of this bill, unless expressly excepted by the proviso in its first section. Thus, the distiller who purchases grain, converts it into whisky and sells, the whisky, would clearly be within its operation. The miller, also, who buys wheat and sells it converted into flour, may be declared a bankrupt against his will. These cases are cited only as examples to illustrate the general rule. Each individual member can imagine many others.\n\n\"I will now proceed to that which strikes my mind as a radical objection to the existence of this or any other adversary bankrupt bill in the United States. It arises from the nature of our free institutions, and is one that exists in no other country on the globe. It springs out of the best principle of the Federal Constitution, and if cannot be removed without expunging them from the instrument. In what manner is a person to be declared a bankrupt by the bill now before the House? On the petition of any creditor, accompanied by an affidavit of the truth of his debt, the circuit or district judge\n\n53\n\nof the United States is authorized to issue a commission of bankruptcy. The alleged bankrupt may, however, appear before the commissioners, deny that he has committed any act of bankruptcy, and demand a trial by a jury of his country, before the judge who issues the commission. This is a right of which he cannot be deprived by the power of Congress. In the emphatic language of the Constitution, ‘he shall not be deprived of his life, his liberty, or his property, without due process of law.’ This trial before the circuit or district judge may and probably will, in a majority of cases, be delayed for years before its final termination.\n\n\"In free governments we cannot move with the celerity of despotism. During its pendency, what becomes of the property of the alleged bankrupt? He cannot be dispossessed of it under the Constitution of the country, or by the provisions of this bill, until the jury shall have convicted him of its first section. But although it cannot be wrested from him until after the event, yet the moment the commission issues, he, in effect, loses all control over his estate. The reason of this is, that by the provisions of the bill all intermediate dispositions made by the debtor of his property are absolutely void, should he finally be declared a bankrupt. No person, therefore, would with safety in the meantime enter into any contracts with him, or purchase any part of his estate. From the very nature of an adverse bankrupt system, this must necessarily be the case. If it were not, every man charged with having committed an act of bankruptcy would demand a trial by jury before the district or circuit judge of the United States, so that during its pendency he might have an opportunity to dispose of his property as he thought proper. What, then, is the situation in which the bill places every man within its adverse provisions?\n\n\"Any of his creditors or pretended creditors, by making an ex parte affidavit of the truth of his debt, without ever proving by his own oath or otherwise any act of bankruptcy against him, may bring upon him inevitable and overwhelming destruction.\n\n54\n\nIf envy or malice against him rankles in the soul of any enemy who either is his creditor, or who will swear that he is, that enemy may wreak his vengeance to the full extent of his wishes, by having a commission of bankruptcy issued against him. The commission itself would be the death-warrant of his property, notwithstanding his property may have been sufficient to discharge his debts, and he may have been guilty of no act of bankruptcy. If he submits to the commission, his credit is gone, and his power of exertion is at an end until he shall have obtained his final discharge. If he does not, and demands a trial, he is, during its pendency, in the situation of Tantalus in the infernal regions. Although he may be surrounded by all the comforts of life, and the means of extricating himself from his difficulties, he has not the power of using them.\n\n\"If he should be a merchant, his counting-house must be closed, and his capital remain idle, awaiting the result of a tedious lawsuit. If he be a farmer who has carried on a distillery, or who has been a miller, or retail merchant, he cannot dispose of an acre of his land, or any of his personal property, until the controversy is determined. Whether, therefore, he submits to the commission, or does not, if he be an honest man, he is exposed to inevitable ruin. If he be a fraudulent debtor, the delay of the trial will afford him ample time and opportunity to secrete his property, and place it beyond the reach of his creditors; and in this situation he will have the strongest temptation to be guilty of fraud. The bankrupt law of England, the model from which the present bill has been drawn, provides an effectual remedy for this evil. It is one, however, which we have no constitutional power to adopt; and if we had, it would be repugnant to every feeling of the hearts of freemen. In that country the bare issuing of the commission is itself equivalent to an execution.\n\n\"The debtor is at once deprived of the possession of all his property, and it is vested in the commissioners. Although he may declare he has never been guilty of an act of bankruptcy,\n\n55\n\nand petitions for a trial, he petitions in vain. The iron hand of the law is upon him, and no innocence can elude its grasp. In that country the law declares that ‘caveats against the commissions are not allowed, for they give too much time to a fraudulent debtor.’ The proceedings under it resemble those of the judges in the informal regions, who first condemn and afterwards hear. They deprive a man of all his property by virtue of the commission, and after the evil has been done, allow him to apply to the chancellor to have it superseded. From the nature of those governments on the continent of Europe, under whose dominion bankrupt laws prevail, and from the peculiar character of these laws, and the commercial tribunals by whom they are administered, the same evils do not exist. I will not exhaust the patience of the House by detailing their different provisions.\n\n\"It may be said, as the bill provides, that the petitionary creditor, before the commission can issue, shall give bond to be taken by the circuit or district judge, in such penalty and with such security as he may direct, conditioned that the obliger shall prove the debtor to be a bankrupt, he will be enabled to recover damages to the extent of any injury which he may sustain in case the condition of the bond should be violated. The remedy, from its nature, could be no compensation for an injury sustained. To inform a man, after he had been arrested in the pursuit of his business by a commission of bankruptcy, after his prospects in life had been blasted, after his credit had been destroyed, and after he had been pursued for years in a course of litigation which had terminated in his favor, that he might then enter upon another law-suit, and bring his action upon the bond, would be laughing at his calamity.\n\n\"This would present no prospect of indemnity, even if the obligors should be solvent; but from the ignorance of the judges, so far removed from the people, as those of the United States necessarily are, respecting the solvency of the sureties; and from the lapse of time which must transpire before any suit\n\n56\n\ncould be sustained upon his bond, it would in most instances be of little or no value. These, then, would be the effects of the bill on the persons within its adverse operations. Let us next inquire what would be the moral and practical effects of this bill, with the amendment just adopted, of the gentleman from Kentucky. Should it pass in its present shape, I should shudder at the consequences. How will it affect the great agricultural interests of the country?\n\n\"I have the honor, in part, to represent a district chiefly composed of farmers. They are honest, they are industrious, and they esteem their contracts to be sacred and inviolable. The word of each of them, could their existence be perpetuated, binds them as forcibly as their bond. Have they, or have any other agriculturists over the whole range of this extensive Union, asked you to pass a bankrupt law in their favor? Have they even petitioned you to discharge them from the obligation of their contracts, which they feel themselves as much bound in conscience as in law to perform? It is certain that many honest and respectable men of their valuable class of society have been unfortunate, and I pity them from my inmost soul; but I beseech you, spare them from a law for which they have never asked, and which would tempt them to add guilt to misfortune.\n\n\"What then would be the necessary operation of such a law, when brought home to those and every other member of society? Once declare that contracts shall be no longer sacred, that any debtor, whether he has been a trader or not, by complying with the provisions of the law, may have an election held by his creditors, and if two-thirds of these in number or value consent, may be relieved from all his debts against the will of the remainder; and you make a direct attack on the very first principles of moral honesty, by which the great mass of the people have been hitherto directed. Let a bankrupt be presented to the view of society, who has become wealthy since his discharge, and who, after having ruined a number of his editors, shields himself from the payment of his honest debts\n\n57\n\nby his certificate, and what effects would such a spectacle be likely to produce? Examples of this nature must at length demoralize any people. The contagion introduced by the laws of the country, would for that very reason, spread like a pestilence, until honesty, honor, and faith will at length be swept from the intercourse of society. Leave the agricultural interest pure and uncorrupted, and they will forever form the basis on which the Constitution and liberties of your country may safely repose. Do not, I beseech you, teach them to think lightly of the solemn obligations of contracts. No government in earth, however corrupt, has ever enacted a bankrupt law for farmers; it would be a perfect monster in this country, where our institutions depend altogether on the virtue of the people. We have no constitutional power to pass the amendment proposed by the gentleman from Kentucky; and if we had we never should do so, because such a provision would spread a moral taint through society which would corrupt it to its very core.\n\n\"By the fifty-sixth section it is provided that any creditor of a bankrupt, appearing before the commissioners, may, at his election, have the validity of his claim determined in the circuit court of the district in which the bankrupt resides. The same privilege is extended to the assignee's objections to the validity of any claim upon the bankrupt, presented before the commissioners; in this manner every lawsuit which could arise in the settlement of a bankrupt's estate, respecting the demands of any of his creditors, would be drawn into the circuit court for decision. This would be the case whether he became a bankrupt voluntarily or by compulsion, and without any regard either to his occupation or place of residence, or that of his creditors. The whole structure of the national judiciary would be changed.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Another serious objection to the passage of the bill is its manifest tendency to the perpetration of fraud. It is true it has been strenuously maintained by its friends, that it will, in a\n\n58\n\ngreat degree, repress that evil. Has the experience of England justified them in making this prediction? Does not the testimony taken before the House of Commons prove clearly the contrary? Indeed so pressed down with weight was my honorable colleague (Mr. Sergeant) that he was obliged to attribute the innumerable frauds which had been committed under the bankrupt law of that country, not to the operation of the law itself, but to the general corruption that prevailed among the people. This bill, should it become a law, must be productive of innumerable frauds, unless it will have the power changing the nature of man, and rendering him the less criminal because he is the more tempted. He who created man, and therefore knew best his heart, directed him to pray that he might not be led into temptation. This bill informs the debtor, that if he will conform to its provisions, he shall obtain a certificate which will discharge him from all his debts. The State insolvent laws declare to him that when he has given up all his property for the use of his creditors, he has done no more than his duty, and that his future acquisitions shall be answerable until his debts are paid. If a debtor can pass the ordeal of this bankrupt law, and obtain his certificate, he may then in security enjoy that property which successful fraud has enabled him to conceal under the State insolvent laws; however, he must know that the moment his concealed property is brought to light, it is liable to be seized by his creditors. Whilst, therefore, a bankrupt law holds out every temptation to make the debtor dishonest, an insolvent law presents him no such inducement. Indeed, his true policy is directly the reverse. Upon his good and fair conduct, and the consequent favorable discharge of his creditors, depends his hopes of a discharge.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"I shall now come to my concluding argument against the passage of this bill. It would tend again to arouse the spirit of wild and extravagant speculation, which has spread distress far and wide over the land. It will tend again to produce those\n\n59\n\nevils for which its friends say it is intended to provide a remedy What has been the history of this country? Upon this subject, let us not turn a deaf ear to the dictates of experience. It is the best teacher of political wisdom.\n\n\"Under our glorious Constitution, the human mind is unrestrained in the pursuit of happiness, the calm of despotism does not rest upon us. Neither the institutions of the country, nor the habits of society, have established any castes within the limits of which man shall be confined. The human intellect walks abroad in its majesty. This admirable system of government, which incorporates the rights of man into the Constitution of the country, develops all the latent resources of the intellect, and brings them into active energy. The road to wealth and to honor is not closed against the humblest citizen — and Heaven forbid that it ever should be! It is however, the destiny of man to learn that evil often treads closely upon the footsteps of good. The very liberty we enjoy, unless restrained by the dictates of morality and of prudence, has a tendency to make us discontented with our condition. It often produces a restless temper, and a disposition to be perpetually changing our pursuits, for the purpose of becoming more wealthy and more distinguished. The frame of mind produced by freedom, if kept within proper bound, is a source of the greatest advantages to society and to individuals: if unrestrained, and suffered to run wild, it leads to every species of extravagance and folly.\n\n\"A few merchants both in the cities and in the country have amassed splendid and princely fortunes. These have glittered in the fancy of the thoughtless and unsuspecting countryman, and have moved his ambition or his avarice. He never calculated that it requires a man of considerable parts with great experience to make an accomplished merchant; and that, with all these advantages, but few comparatively are successful. His son is taught book-keeping at a country school, and then he abandons the pursuit of his fathers. He leaves the business of\n\n60\n\nagriculture, which is the most peaceful, the most happy, the most independent, and, I might add, the most respectable in society, to become a merchant. He spurns the idea of treading in the path of his ancestors, and acquiring his living by the sweat of his brow. Wealth and distinction have become has idols, and turned his brain. Is not this the history of thousands in our country within the last twenty years? It was not difficult to predict what would be the melancholy catastrophe. Bankruptcy and ruin have fallen upon the thoughtless adventurers.\n\n\"Happy would it have been for the country had this spirit of speculation confined itself to the farmers who turned merchants. We have witnessed it spreading over every class of the community. We have, in innumerable instances, seen the plain, sober, industrious, and inexperienced farmer, converted into a speculator in bonds and stocks. We have lived in a time when the foundations of society appeared to be shaken, and when the love of gain seemed to swallow up every other passion of the heart. This disposition gave birth to hundreds and thousands of banks, which have spread themselves over the country. Their reaction upon the people doubled the force of the original cause which produced them. They deluged the country with bank paper. The price of land rose far above its real value; it commanded from $200 to $400 per acre in many parts of the district which I have the honor, in part, to represent; and I know one instance in which a man agreed to give $1,500 per acre for a tract of land, which he afterwards laid out in town lots. He sold the lots at so large a profit, that he would have accumulated an independent fortune by the speculation had not the times changed, and the lot-holders inconsequence been unable to pay the purchase money.\n\n\"The universal delusion has vanished, the enchantment is at an end; the people have been restored to their sober senses. In the change, which was rapid, many honest and respectable citizens have been ruined. Among many, misery and want\n\n61\n\nhave usurped the abodes of happiness and plenty. I most sincerely deplore their situation; but, as legislators, we should all have some compassion upon the community. Experience has taught us a lesson which, I trust, we shall never forget — that a wild and extravagant spirit of speculation is one of the greatest curses that can pervade our country. Do you wish again to raise it? Do you wish again to witness the desolation which it has spread over the land, and which we now are slowly repairing? Then pass this bankrupt bill! Inform the farmer, who is now contented and happy, and whom experience has taught the danger of entering into trade, that he may become a merchant or a land jobber; that he may proceed to any excess he thinks proper; that he need confine the extravagance of his speculations within no other limit but the extent of his credit; that if, at last, he should be successful, unbounded wealth will be his portion, if not, the law will discharge him from all his debts, and enable him to begin a new career. Hold out a lure to the industrious classes in society to abandon their useful and honorable pursuits, and enter into speculation of some kind or other, by proclaiming it as the law that, if they should prove unsuccessful, their debts shall be cancelled, and they shall be restored to their former situation. Such a law would present the strongest temptations to every man in society to become indolent and extravagant, because every man in society is embraced in its provisions. In these respects it is as novel as it is dangerous. Rest assured, Mr. Speaker, that our population require the curb more than the reign. If you hold out such encouragement to unbounded speculation as this bill presents, we shall, before many years, see all the occurrences again presented before us which have involved the country in unexampled distress. The time may come, in ages hence, when a bankrupt law may become necessary for the encouragement of commerce. History has instructed us, that nations, like men, rise, and flourish, and decay. At present our population possess all the vigor and enterprise of\n\n"
