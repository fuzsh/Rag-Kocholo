After the stage director Mark Zakharov shifted to the Lenkom Theatre, it became harder for Tatyana Ivanovna to work in the Satire Theatre. Once during a rehearsal she quarreled with the theatres principal director Valentin Pluchek and left for Lenkom.

Like a young pioneer, Tatyana Ivanovna was always ready for filming, even in her eighties. She often worked with unknown directors, because they needed her help, as she explained to her friends. She always kept her travel bag with a compulsory exercise mat ready to be able to rush off wherever she was invited for filming. Once in a theatre when hearing some young actors complains she exclaimed: Why are you lamenting! Just live and be joyful about that  living is such a gift!

In the late years of her life Tatyana Ivanovna Pelttser started loosing her memory. She could hardly move and memorize her text, and constantly confused her cues. Yet, all the company loved the merited actress and wanted her to go on playing. Specially for her Mark Zakharov staged the play A Funeral Prayer after the scenario by Grigori Gorin, who made up for her the character of the old Jewish woman Berta for Tatyna Pelttser. Aleksandr Abdulov who played her son accompanied her onto the stage and did it so carefully and delicately as if she were a fragile treasure. Her role had just a few words, but the viewers did not care. Every appearance of her on stage evoked extraordinary joy and exultation.

In 1992 after a nervous breakdown Tatyana Ivanovna found herself in a hospital again. There she fell down and fractured her femoral neck. There was only one outcome for the 88 year old person. On 16 July 1992 Tatyana Ivanovna Pelttser passed away.
