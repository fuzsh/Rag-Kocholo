With swindler and blackmailer Yaryzhka (Sergei Gerasimov) he finds a functionary who is willing to take the money. Cautious Bashmachkin (Andrei Kostrichkin) to whom the briber comes, does not want to take on the dangerous enterprise, although he can not resist the charms of a beautiful female stranger (Antonina Eremeeva) whom he met on the Nevsky Prospekt. Later Akaky Akakievich finds out that the woman of his dreams is only an accomplice to swindlers. Fearing punishment, the frightened bureaucrat becomes even more reclusive, all the more carefully isolating himself off from people.\n\nYears later, the already aged and decrepit titular counselor Bashmachkin is forced at the cost of enormous efforts, down to saving the last penny to order a new custom overcoat from tailor Petrovich (Vladimir Lepko). It represents for him so much that it is impossible for him not to fall in love with the tailor's creation. The old campaigner literally becomes rejuvenated when he tries on the new clothing with a warm fur collar. Fellow officers have arranged a little party in honor of the colleague, but that night poor Bashmachkin is robbed on his way home from the festivities. He tries to complain and goes with his trouble to the authorities. Nobody wants to listen to him and he is kicked out, and some time later heartbroken Akakiy dies peacefully, a senseless death ending a meaningless life.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAndrei Kostrichkin as Akakiy Akakievich Baschmachkin\n\nAntonina Eremeeva as girl, \"heavenly creation\"\n\nAleksei Kapler as \"insignificant man\" / \"significant man\"\n\nEmil Gal as tailor\n\nSergei Gerasimov as Yaryzhka, swindler-blackmailer\n\nOleg Zhakov as Baschmachkin's colleague\n\nYanina Zhejmo as tailor's assistant\n\nVladimir Lepko as tailor Petrovich\n\nPavel Berezin as functionary\n\nTatiana Ventzel as barber\n\nPyotr Sobolevsky as functionary\n\nKsenia Denisova as Agrafena\n\nNikolai Gorodnichev as Pyotr Petrovich Ptitsin\n\nBoris Shpis\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
