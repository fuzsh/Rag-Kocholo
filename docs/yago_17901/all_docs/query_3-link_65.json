        "text": "i was very busy during these months and my luck with new viewings was a bit below par. the beginning of the end? perish the thought.\n\nDressed in Blue (Rico, 1983): tender doc about trans folks in spain, most of them possessing a complex relationship with sex work. i think that works like this are always vital in some way, not only as a documentarian effort in the preservation sense, but also just because they feel essential in communicating very human emotions and struggles beyond the social context they exist in. this one is also shot beautifully which never hurts such outings.\n\nLittle Children (Field, 2006): field’s lonergan-esque hollywood maneuvering has not quite hit the highs of the master himself, yet it’s placed him at an interesting spot where his material is clearly great, cutting-edge at its best, yet infrequent enough so as to simultaneously cause doubt on his status as a canonical director and give sufficient hype to his new releases. many words to say that this is good; this sort of 00s world feels so alien now, not only cinematically but also in its portrayal of interpersonal relationships. did this suburbia ever truly exist, or did we only find out about it through dramatizations? a question for the gen-xers i guess, should anyone want to ask them anything i guess.\n\nPsychovision (Passeri, 2003): as a frequent, shall we say, onlooker of giallo and z-grade horror, i’ve been burned by both of them a number of times, so when i found out the viewing of the week was a mix of both i was preparing for the worst so to speak. i don’t even really know what passeri is doing here that elevates this; something about the combination of the genuine camp appeals (largely reflective of an outsider art ethos, not some art-kid postmodernism) and the, through it all, “successful” bending of genre tropes warmed my heart, as much as a sleazy facemelter can i suppose.\n\nA Touch of Sin (Zhangke, 2013): i find jia’s most conventional works his most compelling. sue me. it’s hard to say he’s “torn” between the lo-fi proclivities he tends towards and the papa xi melodramas when he seems so comfortable at bouncing between them, but this dichotomy still makes for a filmmaker who offers something for everyone interested in chinese dramas. this film, one of his best, is an exploration of crime, mostly committed out of desperation, and an Elephant-esque bypassing of the root causes beyond poverty, something i kind of appreciate as he’s unable to stuff much backstory into any of these assorted stories. i found the finale particularly moving, but they’re all filled with moments of beauty and gracefulness – in addition to showing off his knack for working in thrillers.\n\nSlipstream (Hopkins, 2007): yet another “we will never get movies like this again.” a psychedelic singularity, baffling on nearly every narrative and cinematic level, compelling in spite of it. feels like someone trying to do lynch who hasn’t seen any of lynch’s works. also features hopkins just goofing around a bunch behind the camera and in front of it. i have no idea how or why this was made, but this is what the movies truly are and can be – vision unperturbed by money. too bad these sorts of things happen maybe once a decade, and they are rarely this successful.\n\nDeath Bed: The Bed That Eats (Barry, 1977): a 77 minute long movie absolutely in love with explaining the lore of its titular killer, which encompasses hundreds of years and victims, through increasingly esoteric corman-esque montages. not doing anything too formally out there to say it’s doing anything that unique, but rare to find glacially paced horrors this charming (and, on plenty of occasions, riotous). very cool the guy who made this has 0 other credits to his name.\n\nKalkia 2898 AD (Ashwin, 2024): in my pursuit to see sci-fi from all corners in the world (and my boredom of being in a cheap LA motel), i saw this on a whim. the first half is unfortunately marred with a bunch of, not quite marvel humor, but too close to that territory for comfort to be sure. the second half picks up more, often feeling cameron-esque at its most transcendent. it’s fun to see the snyder influence on these indian blockbusters, though this is of course doing its own action scifi blockbuster things for the most part. i hope we get some good sequels out of it as well, and it identifies ashwin as a person of interest at the least.\n\nTokyo Twilight (Ozu, 1957): a lot of ozu flicks that i’ve seen feel almost bereft of conflict; societal woes and intergenerational tensions which pass through their entire runtime more or less unperturbed, and concluding in ways determined to resolve as little of that as possible (on purpose of course). this is a mode of filmmaking i do find quite interesting, though something like this – closer to naruse than ozu’s more low-key dramas – is perhaps more to my tastes personally. a very tender and patient film, which erik reeders know that i value highly.\n\nForget Me Not (Horie, 2015): would make an almost too perfect double billing with Before I Fall, another teen romance-drama with a low fantasy twist that ends up working its subtle magic on the viewer by the end. this one is definitely the darker counterpart; a film about the process of forgetting and feeling alienated by your own memories, not a feeling of nostalgia nor even antinostalgia really or trauma or anything like that, just realization that your past life will be gone someday even if you try foolishly to cling to it. the way the film goes about this is really cool, and i found myself moved by it more than just about anything else i’ve seen lately.\n\nBefore the Devil Knows You’re Dead (Lumet, 2007): in the wake of a huge number of both successful and wildly unsuccessful tarantino ripoffs made by foolhardy whippersnappers, it rocks they got an industry veteran the age of US president joe biden to do this one. lots of great choices here in virtually every department, funnier than these sorts of affairs generally are, and considerably less cringey than it could have been. sometimes the machine produces hits.\n\nUptight (Dassin, 1968): frankly unreal that dassin and co were able to produce something this timely and timeless in the immediate wake of mlk’s assassination – something that could have been a quick buck in the blaxploitation sphere ends up being heartfelt and tragic, prescient and historical. i was sort of dumbfounded that it was made by someone i assumed was just a run of the mill white guy before i learned that dassin was hit with the hollywood blacklist (which i should have inferred by his move to france in the 50s but oh well), certainly clarifying the matter a bit. better than i expected and in ways quite different to Rififi‘s qualities.\n\na lot of ground to cover as usual. *s = new favorites.\n\nSwallowtail Butterfly (Iwai, 1996): goes into more conventional areas than iwai’s masterful, messy material does. at times it doesn’t seem too far off from those unambitious american coming of age flicks that do nothing with the medium. at the same time, iwai the dramatist is more compelling than some indie nepo child, and his characterizations are often more fleshed out and real than a lot of fare like this. better than i expected, probably worse than he thinks it is.\n\nReal Life (Brooks, 1979): i had heard good things about this from my friends for years, but i still wasn’t prepared for how successful this was at basically everything it went for. hilarious as an overt comedy, obviously the social commentary is right there and has merit in its targets and teardowns, but what maybe impressed me the most was how much it seems to predict this sort of internet era deconstruction of the “real” in fiction. obviously this concept has been around for quite some time, though i don’t know of anything that does it better than this. makes me curious about brooks’ other works, though this does kinda feel like a lightning striking once somehow.\n\nNo Such Thing (Hartley, 2001)*: high concept work with nuclear levels of empathy. hartley at his most tender and pure, a director whose occasional forays i had seen still couldn’t prepare me for just how close this is to the ideal form of cinema for me. adore the setting, the characters, the absolutely incredible music which was also done by hartley (the lek of the 00s?), just so much to love here and it makes me even more excited to finish his filmography, as it’s rare most directors can provide work on this level and he had already done it before with Trust. not sure what’s going on with this movie’s reputation, but i think it’s as essential as it gets if you’re interested in the director.\n\nThe Duel (Cheh, 1971) & Return of Bastard Swordsman (Chun-ku, 1984) : you know the drill by now. two of the finest directors under the shaw bros pantheon making work that maybe isn’t up to their absolute peak, yet it’s work that for them was probably closer to a 9-5 than a foray at “real art” which absolutely smashes a lot of tryhard flicks of that designation. as usual for these guys, cheh’s work occupies a midpoint between the zany chun-ku and the more drawn out, eerie works of king hu, and i found the plot compelling enough and the stuntwork typically incredible. and chun-ku’s film is a noticeable step up from the original Bastard Swordsman and is a definite highlight in his expansive filmography; an absolute blast with a splattering of his greatest setpieces. as always, i reflect on how wild it is that we live in a world where there’s a near-infinite amount of movies like this.\n\nThe Long Day Closes (Davies, 1992) & A Quiet Passion (Davies, 2016): after seeing Benediction earlier this year and adoring it, i was eager to the other davies i had been slacking on. both are just like, obviously incredible films, as plain as day to see; in some ways this reminds me of things like Citizen Kane or Seven Samurai where their immediate quality is just so palpable they become almost undeniable to me. they aren’t on the level of the masterpieces, but i think they are close. The Long Day Closes in particular has such a nuanced approach to the pitfalls of (working-class) childhood that it quickly convinced me davies had an understanding of cinema that few could match, while A Quiet Passion was a complete 180 in terms of concept and execution yet still contained his knack for fluidity, extravagance, and portrayal of loneliness. despite being in the game for a long time, he really wasn’t that productive; the films i’ve seen of his have all been great, so i assume he was more of the quality over quantity type, but i’m eager to find out for sure as i continue with his work.\n\nTrenque Lauquen (Citarella, 2022): esta es otra pelicula de argentina tiene 180+ minutos. la pelicula de citarella is muy divertido y tiene tres o cuatro historias en uno, similar a llinas. yo estaba en argentina para dos dias, y vi esta pelicula en el avion a USA. KG no tiene la pelicula, solamente American Airlines. por que?\n\nPoor Things (Lanthimos, 2023): despite learning better by now, i do occasionally venture out to the theater when there’s nothing showing, craving the magic of the movies as nicole kidman or maria menounos calls it. most of the time this doesn’t work out, but sometimes it does. i’ve been pretty ambivalent on lanthimos’ career as a whole, though he does have obvious talents in some regard; his humor is spotty but lands in strides at times, his visuals run the risk of kitsch yet transcend that frequently enough to be worth mentioning, i have no complaints about the high concept nature of his works. this one is one of his peaks for sure; melodramatic when it needs to be, campy when it doesn’t. the late burton-esque visuals are certainly…something, though they’re of course significantly better than a hack like burton could achieve.\n\nDie Nibelungen: Siegfried (Lang, 1924): lang’s highs are, of course, untouchable; cinematic miracles that are undeniable as they are beautiful. and for most of the history of the medium, even his lesser films have been described as being on at least a comparable level. i never really shared this view – not sure if it’s a “you had to be there” thing or what – but i only really could elevate 1 or 2 other langs as “great.” but this is one of them! very charming and also exactly the kind of thing i would want to see when it comes to this sort of medieval adaptation: take things literally and shoot them in the craziest possible ways. the only lang film that really feels comparable to gance.\n\neXistenZ (Cronenberg, 1999): had no idea cronenberg had an action blockbuster in him. and unlike most auteurs that come up short when given more restrictive sensibilities, cronenberg is able to step up to the plate and deliver the goods. as someone who can find his more…icky stuff to be excessive and not really successful as a splatter artist, seeing this restraint was honestly quite refreshing. honestly one of my favorites of his – i’ve still got a couple of blind spots, but this is peak in entertainment and as a conceptual piece i think.\n\nZoo (Wiseman, 1993) & Menus-Plaisirs – Les Troigros (Wiseman, 2023): i have luckily been able to keep pace and watch my requisite 1 wiseman film per month by knocking these two out. Zoo is the better one for sure – something which begins with a “fun” elephant demonstration of tricks that likely wouldn’t fly anytime in the last two years, then covers just an insane amount of gore, surgeries, and death within the titular zoo. without any narration or even talking heads suggesting as much, it gets into questions of veganism and existentialism as we question the need for such institutions, yet are reminded always that this is also just a part of nature and life in general. Menus-Plaisirs is a bit of a weaker wiseman flick – in part due to so much of the 4 hours being devoted to restaurant happenings as opposed to the more invigorating restaurant plannings and logistics – but still, being able to see true craftsmen and innovators honing and perfecting their talents is invigorating in its own way. i would love to eat here someday, though who knows if that’s possible.\n\nDune: Part Two (Villeneuve, 2024): as a villeneuve fan and Dune: Part One ambivalent, it was exciting to hear the good things about this one. but what perhaps most caught my eye during the press run of this flick was the interview with villeneuve when he professed his love for images over words and wanted to make his films only contain images. this has been said in some form or fashion by everyone from skin-in-the-game folks like stan brakage to “yeah sure buddy”-s like george lucas, and i was convinced that villeneuve was in the latter category. but after seeing the movie, i totally get it – his films work as visual journeys not in-service of their generally unremarkable writing, but as a direct counter to them. Dune: Part Two, then, is more about movements, glances, sounds, and motifs than it is about the overt polemics of the source material. and in a world where blockbusters are so often given a glossy finish of digital muck and liberal pontificating, this decades-old approach to moviemaking appears quite radical.\n\nSlow Moves (Jost, 1983)*: the jost formula for filmmaking is so simple and honestly imitable that it’s shocking it hasn’t been co-opted by someone else in the decades since his best films. get some working-class actors, have them play some working class people, shoot everything in a couple of weeks, make everything feel real without feeling over-dramatic, throw in a couple of experimental segments and country songs, and boom, you have a feature that very often (The Bed You Sleep In, Bell Diamond, Sure Fire) is a masterpiece. Slow Moves is one that never quite goes into the hellish horrors of those features, but this isn’t a criticism and the film is as dark as any cassavetes flick at the end of the day, and it’s definitely a highlight for someone wanting to check out jost’s incredible filmography.\n\nDark Horse (Solondz, 2011): i still haven’t quite figured out what solondz’ deal…is. are his protags people that he finds relatable, even at their darkest? someone he has a fondness for, or a disdain? a way to air his grievances, or a form of therapy? i still don’t know, after watching this one; it’s hard to believe this indulges in the self-crit that Storytelling does given the, well, plot of the movie, yet at the same time there’s a chance that solondz is aware of some manchildisms that he himself inhibits. also very funny film, like solondz’ other ones, which is basically a must-have in these sort of sneering character dramas.\n\nHenry Fool (Hartley, 1997) & Fay Grim (Hartley, 2006): i was able to watch the first two of hartley’s trilogy with friends. they both go in zany, ambitious directions; Henry Fool starting as a Dead Poets Society esque romp before veering off into uncomfortable tangents (generally successfully but there is some drag towards the end), while Fay Grim is a wild thriller that almost seems to be an earlier, american version of those sidewinding argentinian flicks that are so hot thesedays. i hear lesser things about the next film in the series, Ned Rifle, but as much fun as i had with these two i’m still looking forward to checking it out. some of hartley’s safer work from a narrative perspective, as well, if you’re trying to dip your toes in the water so to speak.\n\nLake of Illusions (Hashimoto, 1982): i’d known about this one for a little while and was intrigued with its premise and reviews, and i saw it unceremoniously got uploaded to KG with english subtitles recently so i figured i’d get through it. unfortunately not as wild from a structural basis as its (negative) reviews make it sound – honestly for like 90% of this movie it’s a fairly conventional, if offbeat, revenge tale (it does hit a nice sweetspot in its daunting runtime and simple story where it feels genuinely real due to how long we spend on this basic material – similar to Secret defense). the ending and one of the side-plots truly are out of left-field – but not enough to capitulate this to a singularity in the film canon or anything. quite good, and worth seeing if something about it interests you, but don’t expect a messy masterpiece.\n\nAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed (Poitras, 2022): solid HBO talking heads doc. at its most affecting when it’s direct stories of the horrors of pharmaceutical addiction, at its least when it’s a biography of its central subject – though i think she would probably agree with that assessment so i don’t think it’s a super compelling insight. anyways, poitras clearly has a knack for this stuff but i don’t think she elevates the material much higher than it already is, yet there’s worth in creating these normie docs that are more than just nominally productive.\n\nThe Friends of Eddie Coyle (Yates, 1973): workmanlike auteurism has never looked so seamless. a more than capable caper, yates’ unassuming crime flick seems as quintessential as melville’s minor work; kind of shocked that this doesn’t have a grander reputation, though i suspect that comes down to yates not being an especially big name in the canon of film. i hope to see more of his work to see if that’s something i want to change or not.\n\nTheta (Lek, 2021): fits perfectly into the sinofuturist cinematic universe, but it’s more of a lore dump than an actual arc. and given the greatness of Aidol (and, to a much lesser but still relevant extent, Geomancer), one can’t help but wish this was fleshed out more. oh well, lek is young and his projects are still exciting – and this one is definitely worth it as a bite-sized appetizer for whatever is to come.\n\ndue to extenuating circumstances this is very late, but it’s better late than never of course. *s = new favorites.\n\nGodzilla Minus One (Yamazaki, 2023): whatever enthralls people about kaiju movies (and, presumably, wrestling) is stuff that just blows right off of me, and that i pretty obviously glean from shaw bros films instead. but sometimes there comes a kaiju flick that i fully get, and this one ended up being one. simple to the point of redundancy at times, has heart where it needs to. hardly the work of an auteur but it seems like every time we get one of these good blockbusters we remember to appreciate the workmen.\n\nBelfast, Maine (Wiseman, 1999): looking at wiseman’s daunting (to say the least) filmography, in my head it becomes easier to start to conquer if i watch the long ones first. and this 4 hour behemoth of a northeastern town in economic transition is certainly a bit of that, as wiseman’s avenues for exploration include lectures, town meetings, workers at the factory, and those on public assistance. like with wiseman’s other city symphonies of sorts, one gets the idea that despite hitting the 2, 3, or 4 hour mark we’re really only scratching the surface of what gives a community its identity, yet eager for more. invaluable as a time capsule, and also the sort of thing that makes you want to make movies.\n\nDeep Red (Argento, 1975): i’ve said for years i’m not really an italian horror guy, and while i never really jump for joy at the prospect of increasing my view-count of them, i kinda “get” the wavelength now. silly, but not too silly. sleazy, but not too sleazy. violent, but not too violent. homogenized, but not too homogenized. a lot of fun in the theater, that much is true, and perhaps the biggest element i was missing out on before.\n\nDo Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World (Jude, 2023): jude’s genuine appreciation for bombastic narratives and hairy hodgepodges is welcome in festival environment that runs the risk of being sterile. his latest outing is, on the surface, not too far removed from your typical cannes-core bougie satire that has the potential to go big and get a wide viewing; a film about the whims of a company and how divorced they are from the workers on the ground. and i suppose it’s not doing anything too radical in that vein, but it is actually funny, has a visual identity of its own, and its punches never feel rehearsed, despite the fact that it’s not going for any sort of realism. exciting as always, and makes jude continue to be a director i look forward to at every avenue.\n\nMerry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (Oshima, 1983): my ambivalence to oshima can fortunately be breached sometimes, and this bizarre outing of his is luckily one of those that breaches. manages to broach a queer topic in a way that suggests to me that there might have been something cooking for him in a deeper sense if you catch my drift, but beyond that it’s respectful and beautiful and also has an incredible score. funny enough it seems like the kind of movie that americans would try to remake somehow, surprised that sort of thing hasn’t happened yet but thankfully i don’t think this is famous or influential enough to attempt it now.\n\nSudden Rain (Naruse, 1956): naruse’s filmography is sprawling in a way common for those classic japanese filmmakers, but so far taking random stabs at it has proved fruitful. this one’s a fairly straightforward domestic drama that he seemed ever-interested in. the score is noteworthy here as it appears to be just one guy noodling on the piano for the entire runtime, kinda adding to the sitcom-esque humor to the whole deal. i’m not confident naruse was the guy who made multiple masterpieces, but if his deep cuts are as masterful as this then consider me a devoted fan.\n\nCarmen (Saura, 1983): the narrative gimmick here is one that runs the risk of being overplayed, though the setting (opera tryouts of sorts) is a breath of fresh air, as is the flurry of dancing that features prominently in this. i kinda don’t care a whole lot about the stakes of the characters in saura’s films for the most part – his music-based films seem to excel for this, and his more dramatic ones seem to suffer. maybe i just have finally been converted to the “bodies in motion” side.\n\nThe Evil Within (Getty, 2017): what do you even say about something like this lol. one of a kind “rich parents” movie where there’s some clear talent and mania from the person behind the camera, and who knows what would have happened to the ill-fated getty in another world without those rich parents. i guess this film probably wouldn’t exist as this is pretty solidly outsider art by most definitions.\n\nThe Boy from Hell (Asato, 2004) & Dead Girl Walking (Shiraishi & Kazuhiro, 2004): two japanese horror featurettes in the style of like, goosebumps tv episodes. asato’s feels like the best realized version of a no-budget evil folktale come to life in crappy digital, while the other one is a pretty well envisioned exercise in abstract horror. i hear the other films in this series are a bit weaker, but for the interested gremlins, these are nice palette cleansers after a Guinea Pig marathon.\n\nBruine Squamma (Eizykman, 1977): no idea how she conjured these images up (one of the best feelings to have while watching an experimental film), and it must have taken ages to do so, but this pays off as i enjoyed watching an experimental feature-lengther which is an arduous task sometimes. from my immediate glance, i think a lot of her work is in a similar vein of creating narratives through rhythm and editing, but i’m somewhat doubtful she can top this. who knows, i’ll try to see more of hers soon.\n\nThe Boy and the Heron (Miyazaki, 2023): i think a lot of miyazaki’s more conventionally adored work is frustratingly juvenile, and a lot of his more bombastic work to be frighteningly well-done surrealism, so obviously this one ranks highly for me. funny how close this ends up being to the Matrix sequels, notably Revolutions, as it questions the notion of pulling the plug on a fantasy world of sorts – obviously the narrative journey is far different but there’s similarities that don’t feel particularly intentional. won me over in a very cinematic way, wish they stuck to the other title but when you’re dealing with normie weebs as your audience i understand you gotta turn up the slop-o-meter as much as possible.\n\nCity Hall (Wiseman, 2020): ok a reasonable chunk of this movie is just a campaign ad, another reasonable chunk is a veteran town hall of sorts, and those two things do unfortunately bring this down as they grind the film to a halt on an ideological and a narrative level respectively for a few minutes each time. otherwise though it’s a fascinating document; the sprawl threatens to overwhelm this time however as it’s dealing with a much larger city than wiseman’s other films of this nature. what kind of a complaint is that though? only a few more 3+ hour wiseman films to go before i get to the 2 hour ones that 200 people in the world have seen.\n\nFerrari (Mann, 2023): so far below what mann is capable of, but with this material i’m not really seeing what more he could have done honestly. this feels like a pretty dour way to sell you on a movie. mann-heads know that even at his weakest (and this is also, similarly, far from his weakest) he’s still interesting, and at his midpoint he’s better than most directors tryharding. i also saw this in an absolutely awful presentation at a theater i rarely go to which made me wonder how bad projection is at other random theaters in the country.\n\nJu Dou (Yimou, 1990): features many of yimou’s most adventurous palettes, and also one of the most ontologically evil children in celluloid history. not two things that immediately sound like they should go together – and, full discrepancy, they really have nothing to do with each other – yet these are enough to probably sell some of the people on a random early film from the master.\n\nScarlet (Marcello, 2022): i found marcello’s prior feature Martin Eden to be divine – a film with sensory pleasures abound, a real heart for its characters, an interesting structure, frankly brilliant conversation about the politics of individualism, and lovely experimental interludes. so when i went into his newest, i really had no idea what to expect but expectations were high. and this is…probably just as lovely as that film, but very different. has an almost pastoral simplicity, tender as can be, and never felt like some squeamish festival-core stuff either. after this very successful curveball, i’m really just excited to see what type of film we get from marcello next.\n\nGlitter Goddess of the Sunset Strip (Campbell, 1991): if you only see one cali brainrot groupie auteurism post-lesbian stress disorder movie make it this one.\n\nClose Your Eyes (Erice, 2023)*: i saw Spirit of the Beehive during my criterion crave as a teenager and found it somewhat disappointing in a world where the good movies are obvious masterpieces and the disappointing ones are like, ingmar bergman’s 13th best movie. perhaps its subtle pleasures went over my head. but here they don’t. here i felt as though i was watching something so beautiful unfurl that it felt like i was gassing it up even while watching – what is erice even doing here that’s “complicated?” what about this scenery is so captivating? what about its somewhat nondescript characters is so compelling? it’s a mystery wrapped in a mysterious film that culminates in some of the most moving sequences i’ve ever seen. literally, how did he do it?\n\nThe Delinquents (Moreno, 2023): todos las películas de argentina yo veo tienen 180+ minutos. este película es muy divertida, sin los segmentos de mal, y tiene laura paredes de La flor. quiero ver mas películas de moreno, mas películas de argentina, y hablar mas español en el blog.\n\nRun Lola Run (Tykwer, 1998): should have watched it when i was, conservatively, like 15, but honestly had a pretty good time with it now in the theater. dates itself in a very admirable way, and while it’s the kind of thing that almost surely signals diminishing returns of the director’s future outings, it’s still a fun outing for what it is.\n\nTrailer of a Film That Will Never Exist: Phony Wars (Godard, 2023): obviously calling this a film in the conventional sense is stretching some words, which is why it isn’t called a film in the conventional sense. calling it a trailer is also stretching some things. more than anything, feels like you’re watching someone die – not unlike peter whitehead in his final cinematic offering. in both cases, it’s evident that the authors have more to say, and wish they could get just a few more words in before their final everlasting. and godard’s are somewhat scrapped together pleas for peace at his most opaque yet. he didn’t leave us with any easy answers, but he left us with something beautiful in its own right.\n\nBenediction (Davies, 2021): i watched a couple of davies’ films as a teenager and enjoyed them to some extent but felt a distancing. this one i had no such trouble with – i adored the marcello-esque experimental flourishes, the abrupt cuts to WWI archive footage (or is it really? who knows) and the film’s narrative being a breeding ground for davies’ frustrations on queer lifestyles and his penchant for periods before his adolescence. it made me realize that maybe there’s more to this unfashionable old british guy than met the eye initially, and i’m excited to work through more of his work in the coming months.\n\nTwo for the Road (Donen, 1967): the birth of new hollywood was a watershed moment in american cinema shedding the hays code and its newfound depictions of debauchery and violence, but it also brought upon this film – by (at this point) a has-been relic of the old system, breathing life into this portrait of a tumultuous romance. it’s wild that it never really feels totally out of place as a mid 50s technicolor flick, but it’s so mature and goes into such daring directions (not even sub-textually, it’s all just text!) and it seems like the perfect sort of thing to benefit from these loosened restrictions. glad i finally got to see this after having it hyped up to me for forever.\n\nMad Fate (Cheang, 2023): cheang’s a competent mix between workman who understands the assignment and auteur in his own right, never quite convincing me that he’s a master of either. this sort of jack of both trades is rare, and in this film he teeters on the edge of creating a great conventional genre thriller and making a more bizarre, off the wall character study, and it never quite coalesces into either but there’s enough meat on the bone that i’m intrigued to see what directions he goes into next.\n\nThe Heartbreak Yakuza (Harada, 1987): though harada may be a one-hit wonder after all (though how many directors have a Kamikaze Taxi in them?), his more minor offerings still hold their own pleasures. looks incredible and i found it refreshingly sympathetic for a gangster flick of this sort. perhaps my penchant for kind films and harada’s insistence on filling his films with love will win me over to his other works though, guess i’ll have to see them to find out.\n\nThe Dreamed Films (Pauwels, 2010)*: i don’t even remember how i heard about this film’s existence, but those i knew who’d seen it adored it. the description tells me nothing about it, the reviews arguably even less so, and here i am completing the puzzle, saying nothing about this mysterious 3 hour essay film masterpiece. i guess you’ll have to find out for yourself.\n\nThe Sleeping Beauty (Breillat, 2010): at times reminds me of Petit Maman, others reminding me of breillat’s own Bluebeard, at no times reminding me of the woman who made Anatomy of Hell and Fat Girl. but breillat fans probably are aware that she operates in two distinct modes, and while her more prickly new french extremity tendencies are obviously what make her masterful, stuff like this is proof that she’s not some one-trick pony by any means. if she were to continue making stuff in this mold for the rest of her (diminishing?) career, i certainly wouldn’t complain – competent adaptations and true childlike wonder in fairytales is something fleetingly rare for some stupid reason.\n\nSo let’s keep with the idea of translating essays that I wrote for the MAM-Rio Film Archive. These two are the latest ones. Both are for the 100 Year Anniversary rubric that the archive has, in which it exhibits films that were released a century ago. As you’ll see I started to develop a more historiographic and contextualist approach with these, which Ruy (the head of programming) seems to appreciate. I also like writing stuff like this, so that’s a win-win for me!\n\nCinema in expansion: the epic western and Hollywood’s new frontiers\n\nJames Cruze’s The Covered Wagon (1923)\n\nNothing more unitedstatian than the western. Within a cinematographic scope the western not only accompanied the development of US industry but it was, for a long time, commonly associated with its great turning points. The reason being that the western – as a set of narrative codes – is almost inseparable from the mythological understanding of the US as a nation. Especially in the decades prior to the 1950s and 1960s, the western was the ideal way with which to argue in favor of traditional american values. But the form and style with which filmmakers made westerns wasn’t always the same.\n\nWhen fiction films started to gain popularity in the US at the turn of the century, the western was already in the foreground. The Great Train Robbery (1903) is one of the oldest examples, a film about the assault and armed conflict between bandits and policemen. The western stayed relevant with the popularization of the two-reelers, including productions by the format’s own master, D.W. Griffith. A notable example is The Battle at Elderbush Gulch (1913), which already featured the classic (and problematic) conflict between the Native tribes and the white cowboys. With the cliffhanger serials of the beginning of the 1910s, the genre grew exponentially. The first western stars started to emerge, figures like Tom Mix, Texas Guinan, William S. Hart, Harry Carey etc. dominated the screens with their ruthless chases, their risky maneuvers, and their extravagant shootouts. At that moment, the western was a sure shot type of entertainment, but it would soon be in crisis.\n\nThe 1910s saw a revolution in cinema as an industry and as an artform. The feature-length format was gaining popularity, the big studios were being formed, the chains of production, distribution, and exhibition were becoming more sophisticated, and with that, films were transforming into something a lot grander than the quick and cheap entertainment that it once was. At first, Europe was ahead of the curve with these innovations. Italian directors such as Giovanni Pastrone and Francesco Bertolini experimented with large scale epic feature-length productions (peplums) like L’Inferno (1911) and Cabiria (1914). These pictures sought to adapt the epic quality of the classical texts using immense sets, state-of-the-art equipment, crowds of extras, aside from editing and photography techniques that brought to life the poems’ fantasies. These films dominated movie theaters worldwide, and in the US, the Italians’ example was taken as a model before the epic feature established itself as the biggest type of cinematic spectacle.\n\nAfter The Birth of a Nation (1915) – considered the first feature-length epic produced in the US -, D.W. Griffith released Intolerance (1916), which was openly inspired by the peplums of the time. From there he went on to make Hearts of the World (1918), Way Down East (1920), and Orphans of the Storm (1921), among others. Beyond Griffith. Thomas Ince directed Civilization (1916), Rex Ingram directed The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921), and Cecil B. DeMille made The Ten Commandments in 1923. With the vertiginous decline that European cinema suffered thanks to World War 1, these productions ended up proving decisive to the establishment of American cinema in the international market. It was time for Hollywood to expand. But how would the western fit into this?\n\nBy the end of the 1910s, the western genre was going through an existential crisis: what started the decade as one of the main national genres ended up seeming irrelevant in face of the grand and luxurious productions that brought crowds to the movie palaces. In response to that, producer Jesse L. Lasky assigned director James Cruze a mission: to make the first western epic. Thus, The Covered Wagon was conceived.\n\nThe Covered Wagon tells the story of a group of families that trail the old West with the intention of reaching Oregon, where they could acquire their own land. However, to get there, they must traverse all imaginable sorts of obstacles (of nature and of man). The plot has clear parallels with the famous biblical tale of Moses and the Israelites, which cross the desert to reach the promised land of Canaan. The similarities are intentional: The Covered Wagon is, above all, a story about how the American people managed to overcome all hurdles to establish the bases of what would become “a great civilization”. It’s no coincidence that the American president of the time, Warren G. Harding, considered this his favorite film.\n\nJames Cruze opted for a pretty orthodox authenticity in this production, using the actual wagons from the original Oregon trail, hiring actual members of the indigenous tribes to play the parts of the natives, even ordering that the wagons cross an actual river, which resulted in the drowning of two horses. Like it or not, this considerably elevated the standard of how westerns would be produced from then on. The characters, dramatic arcs, and action sequences would be appropriated and permanently included among the narrative codes of the genre.\n\nAnd the legacy of The Covered Wagon is extensive. One year later, a young John Ford directed The Iron Horse, another epic western about the construction of the transcontinental railway. In 1926, Henry King directed The Winning of Barbara Worth, an epic western with romantic elements; in 1929 Allan Dwan directed Tide of Empire, which is about the California gold rush; in 1930 Raoul Walsh made the ambitious The Big Trail – also about the Oregon trail – which was filmed on the then experimental 70mm widescreen base, and was one of John Wayne’s first acting roles; Wesley Ruggles released, in 1931, the epic Cimarron, the first western to receive a Best Picture award at the Oscars. And, of course, in 1939 John Ford returned to the westerns with his seminal Stagecoach, which requires no further explanations.\n\nBuster Keaton’s not-so-shy feature length debut\n\nBuster Keaton’s Three Ages (1923)\n\nIt might seem weird, but the idea of making a feature-length comedy film was once unimaginable. During the silent era, usually features were accompanied by newsreels, cartoons, and comedies, all in short length format. Feature films were the “serious” products, while the “cheap” entertainment remained as shorts. In the 1920s, this started to change.\n\nIt all started in 1921 with Charles Chaplin’s The Kid. The ambitious release of a feature-length comedy (even if containing dramatic elements) was a smashing box office success, and Harold Lloyd followed with Safety Last! in 1923, which is, to this day, his most iconic film. Buster Keaton already showed an interest in making features, but until then the closest he got was a role in The Saphead (1920). For three years, Keaton kept making shorts, a lot of which would become classics. Despite his success, he decided to experiment directing his first feature film. The result is Three Ages.\n\nAt the surface, it’s a shy production. Composed of three interchanging episodes, the feature could be divided into three separate shorts at any point in development. The structure is similar to D.W. classic Intolerance (1916), a film which has four dramatic cores situated in different historical periods (Griffith also considered dividing his picture in two parts). Griffith’s feature is notorious for its meta narrative throughline that connects the different periods, like the title itself explains: Love’s struggle through the ages. Buster’s film offers a rebuttal: “Love is the unchanging axis on which the world revolves.”\n\nThe three periods are strategically selected. The first is the paleolithic, also known as the “stone age”. Thanks to Charles Darwin’s discoveries in the 19th century, a genre of stories involving “cavemen” was popularized in Europe and, in films, it became a brief subgenre kickstarted by D.W. Griffith in 1912 with his film Man’s Genesis. This Biograph two-reeler dramatized the moment in which a primitive man uses his intelligence to produce the first weapon (the stone club) and win against his stronger opponent. In the following years more films were made on top of the same premise and even Chaplin parodied the cliché with His Prehistoric Past (1914).\n\nThe second period is the Roman Empire era. Much like the paleolithic, films embraced the Roman Empire like a stage for spectacles with the release of aforementioned works like Intolerance and of films like Cabiria, Ben-Hur, Salomé, etc. The last period is called the “modern era”, but it ends up being a representation of what we now call the “roaring twenties”.\n\nLike in Intolerance (and in other similarly structured movies, like Leaves of Satan’s Book by C.T. Dreyer, and Destiny by Fritz Lang), there’s a poetic repetition of the plot. The same narrative unfolds in the three periods and, in the process, we can see how each era is similar or different to each other. In each story, a young man (Buster Keaton) falls in love with a girl (Margaret Leahy), but in order to conquer her heart, he must convince her family, and in the process, compete with another man (Wallace Beery). The problem? This rival is always stronger, richer, and crueler than the protagonist. In each period, the young man fights for the girl’s love while attempting to survive the villain’s tricks.\n\nThat’s when Buster Keaton’s shyness goes away. Each period features daring special effects. In the paleolithic, for example, there’s the use of stop motion to animate a dinosaur on which the protagonist rides (a reference to the work of Willis H. O’Brien, who worked in The Ghost of Slumber Mountain in 1918, and would later make The Lost World in 1925, not to mention the classic King Kong in 1933). In the Roman era, huge sets were used and made to look even bigger with double exposure tricks. In the modern years, there’s a famous scene in which Buster is being chased by cops and jumps from the ceiling of a building to another, but he fails to land properly and falls disastrously down. Believe it or not, that fall was improvised: Keaton fails the landing and falls for real, but instead of cutting it out, he incorporates it into the sequence. Maybe this isn’t his most technically elaborate film, but it’s certainly his most visually varied work.\n\nAs someone fascinated by intertextuality and self-references, Keaton plays with the anachronisms in each period, projecting modern elements into the old eras (cavemen playing baseball with clubs and stones, Roman streets having “no parking” signs) while also commenting on the peculiarities of the modern times (if in the first two periods the one who decides who the girl will marry is the father of the family, in the modern era the mom is the authority; while in the first two eras the couple ends up having many children, in the modern era they settle for a small dog).\n\nWhile Chaplin experimented with feature-length humor in The Kid by combining comedy with tragedy in his own peculiar way, and Harold Lloyd used the format to construct an extensive and thrilling action-comedy sequence in Safety Last!, Buster Keaton played – in his not-so-shy manner – with the clichés and expectations of genre filmmaking through his characteristically irreverent and metalinguistic humor. Three Ages releases in 1923 to establish a new phase in comedy cinema: in an expanding Hollywood, now even the comedians were doing “serious” pictures.\n\nThis concludes my essays written in 2023 for the MAM Film Archive website. Hopefully in 2024 I can keep writing out my thoughts on movies for them. And if I do, I’ll make sure to translate them here for you guys.\n\nNot sure if I explained this here at any point, but since mid-2022 I’ve been collaborating with the MAM-Rio Film Archive as a volunteer and with freelance work. It’s been some amazing months and definitely the most fun I’ve had in a very long time. As part of my collaboration, I’ve gotten to join the “writing staff” of the Archive’s website by contributing with 4 essays on topics prompted by Ruy Gardnier, the Archive’s programmer. The first two essays were related to films that were exhibited earlier in 2023, the first was on Abel Gance’s La Roue (1923) which was shown as part of a 100 Year Anniversary rubric, and the second was on Howard Hawks’ Twentieth Century (1934), which was part of the Howard Hawks Retrospective that happened back in August, and whose selected films are all accompanied by an essay written by folks like Filipe Furtado, Ruy Gardnier, Hernani Heffner, and Yours Truly.\n\nSince these essays are in Portuguese, I cannot link them to the readers of the Erik Reeds WordPress since most of you don’t read the language, so I decided to translate the ones I wrote and maybe post them in couplets every few months. Hopefully as I keep writing for the MAM Film Archive I can keep translating them and posting them here. So here’s two translated essays on two movies that I like.\n\nEngineering a Cinema of the Future\n\nAbel Gance’s La Roue (1923)\n\n“There is cinema before and after La Roue just like there is painting before and after Picasso” is a phrase commonly cited by Jean Cocteau to describe the weight that the 1923 film directed by Abel Gance has on film history. Other intellectuals also recognize its importance: Sergei Eisenstein and G.W. Pabst have listed Gance as one of their main inspirations, Jean Epstein describes the film as one of the most beautiful in the world, and Akira Kurosawa said it was the first film to impress him. Many see D.W. Griffith as the creator of the cinema of Hollywood, but it’s time to elect Abel Gance as the creator of avant-garde cinema, the cinema of the future.\n\nAs with many associated with the French avant-garde cinema, Gance saw the possibility of re-understanding and advancing the ways to conceive cinema and language. While the Soviets were inventing the film school in the early 1920s and incorporating the studies of the then revolutionary “Kuleshov effect,” Gance was materializing these same montage and composition theories that still only existed on paper on the other side of the Rhine.\n\nAlready in the prologue of La Roue there’s a sequence that seems pretty familiar to those acquainted with Soviet montage. At a French trainyard, two trains meet in a high-speed collision. Thanks to the immediate help of the protagonist, the train engineer Sisif, the catastrophe was deescalated and the lives of many were saved, one of them being an English child called Norma, who lost her mother in the accident and is secretly adopted by Sisif as his daughter and Ellie’s (Sisif’s biological son) sister. This prologue sets up all the ensuing drama, but it also presents the genius ways in which Gance constructs through montage (done by Marguerite Beaugé, who also did the montage of The Passion of Joan of Arc by C.T. Dreyer) the horrifying spectacle of seeing two immense trains colliding, crashing, exploding, and merging into blood and boiling metal. Through quick, drastic, rhythmic cuts a collision is transformed into an apocalyptic event. It wouldn’t be surprising to learn that Eisenstein studied this opening before directing the final sequence in Strike or the Odessa steps scene in Battleship Potemkin.\n\nIt’s also worth noting the more symbolic use of montage in the work. This is a constant element in Gance’s work even in his earlier film, J’accuse! (1919). There is an imagetic construction through diverse filming techniques to reinforce ideas with relations between trains and obsessions, Norma and nature, Sísif and the railways etc. The title of the movie itself is an allusion to a metaphor made by Victor Hugo, which is mentioned in the opening: “I know that creation is a Great Wheel that cannot move without smashing someone!” Watching La Roue is seeing a set of signs interlacing and forming a net of signifiers until they come to life. The camera presents everything in relation to its signs, the train in relation to Sisif, Norma to flowers, Ellie to his violins, Hersan to his money, until the point when a train, a violin, or a rose start representing all that they were associated with throughout multiple hours. As an effect, the spectator starts thinking in a certain Gancian language and learns to see the symbols as superior to the drama. When the film concludes, so does an entire imagetic logic that the spectator carries to the end. A toy train falling on the floor is the answer to a million metaphors. And to Gance this was the most profound form of cinema, when one stops watching in a rational manner and transcends to a nearly spiritual process of seeing what’s beyond the screen.\n\nAfter La Roue, his following work was the epic Napoléon, from 1927, which for many represents not only the peak of Abel Gance’s career, but also of French Avant-Garde, and even of silent cinema. But, at the same time, 1927 is the beginning of the end to silent cinema, and from then on Gance had a lot of difficulty adapting his style to the new industry. One might say, alternatively, that he always struggled against the medium that he helped to advance. Napoléon, for example, was originally produced to have a runtime of over 9 hours. It was reduced to 5 and a half hours, and later 2 hours, until finally becoming 90 minutes long. Gance struggled to distribute such a long work, and ended up giving in to the pressure of cutting 90% of the movie. The same happened to La Roue, which was re-edited and reduced from 9 hours to 2, but since the director created different versions of the film throughout the years, eventually it was possible to reconstruct a copy that was close in duration to the original 1923 print. In 2006, Lobster Films spearheaded a restoration of the 4 hour version, using Russian and French negatives. This is the most well known version currently, which was released on DVD in 2008. In 2019, the Swiss and French Cinematheques worked in collaboration with Pathé and the Jérôme Seydoux-Pathé Foundation to restore another longer version, which is 7 hours long.\n\nIn the film’s opening credits, there’s a close-up of Abel Gance gazing at the camera. Theorists and historians interpret it as an “auteur’s signature” in his own work, and while this might probably be the correct reading, it’s also interesting to think that in the moment that an audience in a movie theater in 2023 looks at the eyes of a man from a century ago, that’s the opportunity that Gance had to imagine himself gazing at the cinema of the future that he himself sought to construct. 100 years later, his eyes meet ours.\n\nSvengali and Mata Hari in a train to New York: the invention of the Screwball Comedy\n\nHoward Hawks’ Twentieth Century (1934)\n\nThe word screwball comes from the technical vocabulary of baseball and refers to the act of throwing a ball as a screw, but it is also an early 20th century slang for insane people. How did this term end up being associated with a romantic comedy genre in the classical Hollywood era? If there’s someone who can help us understand the origins of screwball comedies in the 1930s and 1940s, it’s the American director Howard Hawks, and more specifically, his 1934 film, Twentieth Century.\n\nRomantic comedies are a genre as old as narrative cinema itself. Since the silent era there was a tradition of humor around romantic situations and erotic adventures, but usually with a farcical tone. Some good examples are the German films of Ernst Lubitsch, such as The Doll (1919) and The Wildcat (1921) or even the meta parodies of King Vidor such as The Patsy (1928) and Show People (1928). Even Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd movies usually involved a romantic arc. Only later that a more satirical tone would be associated with the genre, and once again it’s possible to observe this change with Lubitsch himself, who would become a Hollywood pioneer with works like The Marriage Circle (1924) and So This is Paris (1926), but only after the coming of sound cinema did he completely develop the famous Lubitsch’s Touch, with which his romantic comedies satirized not only the European aristocratic culture but also the conventions of love, flirtation, and sex. The biggest examples are The Smiling Lieutenant (1931), One Hour With You (1932), Trouble in Paradise (1932) and Design for Living (1933).\n\nThus, a tendency to parody the traditional love story and explore non-ideal love relations – and as a consequence, question the type of social conventions that constituted them – is developed. Enter Howard Hawks, who up until then was known for directing the great hit Scarface, and who in 1934 adapts another Ben Hecht scenario into a film that, along with the Frank Capra classic It Happened One Night (of the same year), is considered the official start of the screwball comedy genre.\n\nThe plot is anything but a conventional love story. A highly famous Broadway director named Oscar Jaffe (played by John Barrymore) discovers a lingerie model named Mildred Plotka (Carole Lombard) who has the potential of becoming a great actress. He trains her in the art of theater and eventually Mildred becomes the great Lily Garland, a Broadway star. As a result, they fall in love. Years – and many successful plays – later, the two end up in a rocky relationship, in which Lily finds herself progressively more frustrated with the controlling manner with which Oscar Jaffe treats her, and, after reaching her limit, decides to accept an invite to work in Hollywood far from Jaffe. Once without his muse, the director falls into an existential abyss and becomes incapable of producing new hits with other actresses. In a moment of crisis, he boards a train from Chicago to New York, the Twentieth Century Limited, and – unbeknownst to him – ends up on the same vehicle as Lily Garland and her fiancé.\n\nThrough this long trip, Jaffe throws himself into a conspiracy to produce the perfect scene which will lure Lily back to the stage. Alongside his assistants, Jaffe fabricates an array of lies in order to reach Lily’s heart, but in the process the two exchange incessant yells, kicks, curses, fits, and all the loudest noises that could be captured by a Western Electric Noiseless Recording system. Chaos reigns from the moment the two meet inside this train. And that is the tone that defined the entire screwball comedy genre.\n\nAs a director, Howard Hawks let Carole Lombard and John Barrymore be as creative as possible with their characters by not allowing them to hesitate or to hold back on the violence and even incentivizing exaggerations and ad-libbing. Hawks was given two actors that had the capacity of invoking chaos in their performances, but who also worked well on top of each other’s chaos without stepping on anyone’s toes. Watching Twentieth Century is like seeing what two extremely professional artists can achieve when working with good material, a good director, and with a good work relationship.\n\nBut it wasn’t just the performances that made this an iconic film. The characterization and setting were enough to shake the foundations of the love story in cinema. While It Happened One Night broke new ground with a love story that reflected the class divisions of the US and by containing a more sarcastic humor, Twentieth Century showcases a pair of egocentric verbose liars, whose final romance is carried through a war of egos and a net of lies. Lily is a two-faced spoiled crybaby, while Jaffe is a narcissistic controlling liar who is even compared to the mythological Svengali. A love story between maniacs is constructed, and the surprising result is that audiences are enamored and completely entertained by these villains’ intrigue.\n\nThe aforementioned paradigm shift was possibly Twentieth Century’s main contribution. In the following years, Hawks would continue contributing to the screwball comedy genre with other classic works such as Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday. Both are examples of what can be achieved when a director works with two super sharp actors. Twentieth Century was at the beginning of a north-american comedy revolution, and Howard Hawk’s contribution is immeasurable. With the intention of making a film about two lunatics inside a train, Hawks ended up eternalizing himself in another cinematographic genre.\n\nThese were the first two essays I wrote. The other two will be posted soon. I hope y’all enjoyed this idea. Stay tuned!\n\nas the years trudge onward i feel less and less confident rankings films that i’ve seen. in a way it feels futile – many things i watched half my life ago, others were watched in optimal conditions contrasted with watching a vhs rip off my laptop, sometimes i’m in a bad mood (or a great one) which can influence things one way or another depending on the content, etc. as such i find that it may be best for me to just speak about those films that greatly moved me and leave possible rankings to the spectators who can glean something subconscious on my words about the films themselves.\n\nsome directors are funny in a way; i find myself drawn and repulsed by them as i alternate between their “good” and “bad” films. and no director encapsulates this more than tourneur. it’s still puzzling to me how an auteur who seems so singular even in his great workmanlike flicks can also appear so dull in material that should be easily grabbing me. luckily i saw two incredible films of his this year – Stars in My Crown (Tourneur, 1950) and Anne of the Indies (Tourneur, 1951). on the surface, they are entirely different; Stars eschews tourneur’s more audacious visual style and genre mannerisms and replaces it with a depiction of a fordian community (and largely usurps the master himself), while Anne finds him working his magic in the gorgeous possibilities of the technicolor blockbuster. yet where they both overlap is their intense emotion; the leads in both are so diametrically opposed, yet so filled with passion and gumption that they seem to form their own sort of archetypes. unfortunately, the other tourneurs i saw this year were less impressive, but i’m hopeful i’ll find more of his that i adore like this.\n\ni realized when i watched another minor naruse film i snatched off of a kg freeleech that i really hadn’t seen enough of his works – the two that i had seen i greatly enjoyed, and reading about his personal life in wikipedia made me interested in him due to his real-life eccentricities. i talked to jack, a friend of mine, who sold me on Two in the Shadow (Naruse, 1967), the final work of the japanese master. it’s somewhere between ozu and sirk in terms of what i want from this sort of melodrama – readers of mine know that i like ozu and adore sirk – so this ended up being a beautifully constructed, yet weirdly conflicted take on the forbidden lover film. in particular, the final shots are so fleeting and mysterious (made even moreso after the fact; they were the final shots naruse would ever shoot) that i find a sort of spectral energy to the film, making it stay in my mind still.\n\na director i did not feel that i had underwatched prior to this year was melvin van peebles – despite only seeing Sweet Sweetback, his mode of filmmaking just seemed not really like my type of thing in my estimation. which is, of course, silly; filmmakers are rarely so defined by a single film. just is the case with peebles, and his triumphant The Story of a Three-Day Pass (Peebles, 1967). it wears its fairly recent influences on its sleeve – it’s difficult not to think of this being directly influenced by the early french new wave joints, cassavetes, and other such budding 60s filmmakers and movements. at the same time, it imbues peebles’ sensitivity for the interracial relationship at the forefront of the film, successfully weaving in jovial breaks from the dismal reality of post-64 race relations. i am excited to give van peebles more chances, as something like this is singular filmmaking.\n\nthough i don’t have much interest in joe dante as a filmmaker (and, on principle, don’t have much faith in so-called experimental directors who are unmistakably mainstream artists at heart making experimental works), i did go to a showing of The Movie Orgy (Dante, 1968) because – well, i mean, come on. and what astounded me was how everything – the editing, the commentary, the sense of humor itself – reminded me of watching YTPs at a young age, this slipshod montage which surely took a mountain of effort to assemble coalescing into a herculean effortpost that had me in stitches for nearly the entire 280 minutes. i almost never see movies that make me feel like a kid again, and yet this one did – i was back on the computer, laughing at morshu and mama luigi, except now i was laughing at the absurdity of 50s advertising and dante’s own irreverent sense of humor. if the movies were ever gone, they were back in 1968.\n\none of the lovely things about the kg freeleech system is being exposed to films and directors you’d never heard of – or at least, had no interest in beforehand. such is the case with arietta and his masterpiece Flammes (Arietta, 1978). at times it seems like mdo, at other times it more closely resembles The Story of Marie and Julien, yet these influences (or…influencees?) don’t do justice to how potent arietta’s bizarre low fantasy lovestory is. the blocking and framing alone is unique – i can’t think of anything else that truly feels the way this does, feels like how dreaming does in my platonic ideal – and that’s to say nothing of its pathos, care for its characters and their fantasy lands. while the other ariettas i saw were a bit disappointing compared to this, it’s hard to make something this incredible twice – and i am glad that anyone was able to make this film once.\n\non a bit of a whim (and being in one of those “i should watch something but i only have 20 minutes” moods) i checked out Tyll The Giant (Ramaat, 1980), an estonian animated short. i should note that the version i watched had an alternate soundtrack - but it is absolutely killer, and rarely have i seen music and visuals cohere into something this beautiful and cruel. i feel silly ranting about things that are only a few minutes long; not because i feel as though they are less worthy of longer texts, but because…well the reader should just spend that time watching them and forming their own opinions.\n\non the recommendation of my friend pedro, i checked out Vengeance is Mine (Roemer, 1984) despite not knowing much of anything about roemer. and now i still don’t, despite seeing another of his (that i found great as well), beyond the fact that he is an immense talent and has been tragically under-productive from a filmmaking standpoint. this film, otherwise (and, in my opinion, much more fittingly) known as Haunted, features a cassavetes-ish deconstruction of a hetero relationship and its broader rippling impacts. and like the best of cassavetes, it’s harsh, difficult to watch, but filled with great humanity, yearning, and defiance; roemer’s eye for patient observations and tender glances is unmatched, and his work becomes a conduit of emotions that every melodrama aspires to be yet few attain. i am excited to finish up the remainder of his filmography, that which is available at least.\n\nin my efforts to watch more films that my friends collectively rate highly, i finally sought out Miracle Mile (de Jarnatt, 1988) earlier this year – and i was floored that it hadn’t become a major cult classic yet. its charms and quirks are so massive and undeniable that it almost feels poised to become one, even if the world isn’t ready to fully accept it yet. oftentimes it works its way into a carpenter-esque groove, only to subvert that with its own 80s romcom leanings (say what you will about carpenter but tenderness has rarely been his strong suit). it’s a pity that de jarnatt’s work went largely under appreciated at the time, as this has the markings of a once in a lifetime genre filmmaker, but such is hollywood i suppose.\n\nthose who know me know that i get a sizable chunk of my recommendations from remi, and those who know remi know that he has seen more trashy american genre films than like 99.9% people of people on planet earth (certainly more than me at the least). and one of the best ones must definitely be The Roller Blade Seven (Jackson, 1991), a no-budget…rollerblading film..with a…plot maybe…? it defies easy explanation, operating as an extended music video at times, yet at others it’s a heartfelt demonstration of insane costuming. it’s rare to see something where every department on the film seems to give their all on what could just as easily have been some random throwaway sleazeball project – and it surely was for a non-negligible amount of the creatives working on it here, let’s be honest – but somehow the stars align and this one singular outsider art genre flick becomes transcendence incarnate.\n\nthe film scene in north texas is atrocious, there’s no sugarcoating that. the closer you get to the metroplexes the better, of course, but even in seemingly artsy college towns, it appears as barren as can be. luckily, the local arthouse by me began showing some retro screenings that, while not 35mm or rare or anything, made for pleasant outings that i’d largely not had since i lived out of the state, and perhaps the finest was Mary Jane’s Not a Virgin Anymore (Jacobson, 1996). filled with a tender, worldly energy, this sole feature by the immensely talented sarah jacobson, who left us much too soon, differentiates itself from nearly every other coming of age / hangout flick somehow. both while watching it and recalling it now, i’m not even sure how it manages this balancing act; on the surface, it’s not doing anything crazy in any formal directions, nor does it offer showy pleasures or anything of that sort. yet the cumulative effect of its charms won me over – it’s such a sweet, caring film, yet also one that never quite shies away from the more prickly woes of transitioning to adulthood.\n\nfor years, i had convinced myself in my head that i had seen every great godard film, and that though there were others i wanted to check out, i had combed through the best of them. well, i may finally be hitting a wall with godard in that regard – but i seem to have not hit it with akerman, whose devastating documentary South (Akerman, 1999) brutalized me by the end of it. i didn’t think of it too much beforehand, somehow, yet akerman’s sensibilities are perfectly suited to this sort of somber documentary storytelling. longing tracking shots pepper the landscape of the film, and make the brutal lynching at the center of the film’s focus feel even more evil, as they seem to suggest “how could these people do this? how could this world let this happen?” and other such impossible questions. a difficult and queasy watch, yet akerman does the content justice.\n\nafter being exposed to the blackpilled auteur that is david mamet a couple of years ago, i’ve greatly enjoyed his offerings so far. it’s a refreshingly dark worldview, isolating itself from the finchers and co. of the world by seeming committed to an extremely pessimistic (and borderline fascistic at times) worldview, devoid of transcendence and even tenderness oftentimes. it’s with Redbelt (Mamet, 2008) that i feel as though mamet has bridged the gap between his sensibilities and my own and made something that appears to have that human pulse to it that also retains this dismal outlook on the world. fantastic lead work here goes a long ways, but mamet’s characterization is especially nuanced; oftentimes it feels as though you’re watching a character of pure drive and initiative, whose morals are uncompromising yet never feel sensationalized. it also looks incredible when it probably doesn’t even need to – another testament to mamet’s virtuosity.\n\na friend of mine, carlos, passed me the absolute riot of a film Roller Junkies! (Masters, 2022) at the start of last year. it’s as funny as it gets, reveling in the sort of lowbrow, unserious humor that makes these sorts of works tick, and mostly lacks the sort of unpleasant sleaziness and bad vibes that tends to taint things like uh…this. so what is it? what is this ridiculous, 74 minute flick? it’s a brisk detailing of skating gangs, which effectively are imagined in the way that a 12 year old girl would imagine them to be – perhaps a 12 year old girl at the turn of the 00s anyways. as the years go on i find myself unable to feasibly identify what makes a “good movie,” as cinema’s pleasures are so vast and variable that any connecting fibers of greatness appear equally arbitrary when zoomed out, and Roller Junkies! largely epitomizes this.\n\nand finally, i got to see a much-anticipated film this year – that being Coma (Bonello, 2022). descriptions and early word-of-mouth had my interest piqued, and while my outings with bonello had been hit-or-miss at that point, something about it just captivated me. when i did eventually get to see a leaked version, i was ready to be let-down by the silly qualities i’d already embellished it with… but it turns out, it was exactly what i was wanting. at once experimental, tender, heartfelt, bombastic, and mysterious – it’s a film that tells a billion ideas in a brief runtime, something that makes me yearn for this type of explosive filmmaking that has its own sympathetic and caring roots. i cannot wait to see what bonello manages to do next, and i am glad to have more established directors making left-field turns like this.\n\na whole lot to talk about here. no new faves but a whole lot of new things i liked a lot.\n\nThe Battle of Chile: Part II (Guzman, 1976): a measured chaos, compared to the more wild part 1 in guzman’s trilogy, this one doesn’t feature anything as wild as the frankly horrifying ending of part 1 but it is overall more engaging on a purely cinematic level. it gets depressing seeing the misdeeds of imperialism featured so directly like this over the course of several hours – though that’s obviously the primary point being made. i hope to see some of guzman’s more conventional work at some point.\n\nDark Star (Carpenter, 1974): i’d always heard about this being one for the carpenter completionists only – and i’m frankly stunned that it has this reputation. even if you delegate this to the “not very successful” category, its value as a straight comedy in carpenter’s oeuvre is noteworthy enough to deserve watching. i found it quite successful though – funny throughout, lots of good gags, and i think it takes itself just seriously enough to not devolve into outright silliness for the most part – incredible it was made before Star Wars, anticipating a lot of the more annoying tropes of things satirizing that series and handling them gracefully.\n\nMy Twentieth Century (Enyedi, 1989): feels like maddin in many ways, but also it seems as though the aesthetic eccentricity is less a fetish and more of a conduit, if you get my drift. looks gorgeous and easy to find yourself lost in – above all makes me wonder what other things enyedi has been cooking up through the decades. i find this sort of sidewinding narrative to be often a bit tedious, though it sort of flows like water (or even electricity…) in her hands.\n\nBlue Strait (Jost, 2015): the little i’ve seen and heard of jost’s 21st century work hasn’t inspired me to seek much more out, luckily remi showed me this one and it ended up being quite a delight. it’s as stripped down as it gets; jost’s commitment to minimalism on every level ends up with a slow cinema film whose lofi digital aesthetics contrast with its arty leanings, leaving for a unique viewing experience that is often moving even when there’s little happening narrative-wise. i should try to seek out more of his minor pictures one of these days, though if they’re all this depressing then it might be a slow endeavor.\n\nShaolin Temple (Cheh, 1976), The One-Armed Swordsman (Cheh, 1967), and The New One-Armed Swordsman (Cheh, 1971): i watched several cheh films the last two months, and liked all of them a good amount. Shaolin Temple focuses extensively on training montages whereas the two One-Armed Swordsman moves are about overcoming crippling weaknesses, but all of them (and, i assume, other cheh films) are ultimately about the power of the body and the mind, and the power unlocked by the two in unity. what could be more beautiful? helps that these movies look incredible of course.\n\nThe Exorcist III (Blatty, 1990): i still need to see the second one, and maybe rewatch the first while i’m at it, but for my money this is basically the zenith of what you can do for horror rehashes. goes hard and not afraid to get nasty, and it gets downright mean oftentimes; rare to see this skill involved from a nobody, but that’s the fun part about cinema i reckon.\n\nTo Sleep So as to Dream (Hayashi, 1986): another pre-maddin maddin-esque flick, this one by hayashi is, like the best of maddin, clearly committed to its aesthetic principles out of a love for the era it’s portraying and not out fetishism. has many beautiful moments, and many funny ones as well, even if its sidewinding noir-y nature attempts to undercut how poignant it can be at times. i would love to see what else hayashi has done as something as idiosyncratic as this is always a joy to see.\n\nFire of Waters (Brakhage, 1965), Self Song/Death Song (Brakhge, 1997) and Panels for the Walls of Heaven (Brakhage, 2002): had the pleasure and the privilege of seeing brakhage projected on film, and finally crossed these off the list. Fire of Waters has some of his best live action cinematography honestly, adore the grainy BW photography, even if it’s a little undermined by the off-the-wall ending in this (seems weird to speak of it as if it’s a narrative, but some of stan’s work did approach that asymptote). Self Song/Death Song is about death, so obviously horrifying. and Panels for the Walls of Heaven, on top of having the hardest title known to man, is as beautiful as any of brakhage’s great painted work – i’m glad i finally got to see this one as it’s one of the last true grails of mine.\n\nAnatomy of a Fall (Triet, 2023): it’s been a while since i saw some honest to goodness festivalcore (outside of those by the established auteurs i was already a fan of, of course), and it’s nice to see that these types of movies are still thriving. i find the viral marketing for it pretty hilarious as it seems entirely incongruent to what the movie is doing (showing a family’s struggle through a tragedy, versus making it a tabloid story of sorts), but i luckily saw the movie before i let that agitate me much. anyways, establishes triet as someone to watch out for, but i could also just as easily see this being her peak, as this sort of arthouse stuff is hard to crank out consistently at this level of quality.\n\nWeather Diary 1 (Kuchar, 1986): first kuchar i’ve seen, and it’s just him watching tv and getting obsessed with storm chasers while he’s stranded in an oklahoma hotel – which is more relatable than anticipated. funny and sweet, i will have to see more from the low budget legend himself.\n\nAll Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (Curtis, 2011): always fun to see the detours that adam curtis goes down in his polemics, but this one goes into surprisingly esoteric (and, compared to his other work, apolitical) directions. like no, i did not know about the history of 20th century ecology, but it was nice to learn about it. always come away from his films feeling as though i learned something, but never quite feeling as though they are personal favorites – i am hopeful that he makes something that bridges the gap. in the meantime, i think his narratives are universally great, full of decisionmaking that many essayists could learn from.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon (Scorsese, 2023): went into this expecting something around the usual quality of scorsese’s mediocre 21st century output and came out bewildered that the person who just made The Irishman suddenly learned how to pace a 3.5 hour movie – not to mention how to film empathetically. i guess you can teach an old dog new tricks after all.\n\nNotebook on Cities and Clothes (Wenders, 1989): obviously as a film which exists as an extended hangout session with yohji yamamoto is something i would be predisposed to loving. features many nuggets of wisdom (such as great clothes feeling like you are seeing you as the best you can be, not as an extension of clothing), and it’s nice to have actual high definition footage of fashion shows from this era which are frighteningly rare for some reason. would love to see this kind of stuff done for more designers but i unfortunately believe their images are much more controlled thesedays.\n\nDrive a Crooked Road (Quine, 1954): plot-based noir that focuses on its characters seems like one of those “unlike most mechas this one focuses on the characters” type of compliment but i can assure you it’s true here. has a ray-like humanism to it, but with even more of the lurid fatalism. twists and turns before the predictable finale, that’s the fun with great noir though, isn’t it? i will have to see if quine’s other work is this accomplished as it seems the writing did a lot of the work here, but who knows.\n\nPrisoners (Villeneuve, 2013): if only all copaganda was half as competent as this. actually that would probably be very bad.\n\nBallet (Wiseman, 1995): similar to the shaw bros flicks i saw, this one is all about stretching the limits of the human body – and, at times, its mind – and finding beauty in those limitations. every time i watch one of this guy’s movies i feel as though i could watch what he’s documenting for days on end, i really need to binge him sometime and learn all about bureaucratic public institutions and vanity art projects.\n\nThe Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant (Fassbinder, 1972): took me a while to realize what this was doing, but once i hit the “oh this is just the whole movie” point it really clicked for me. suffocating and tragic, has that sort of baroque horror that i associate with manoel de oliveira oftentimes, yet it’s handled in a somewhat less detached way in fassbinder’s hands. looks gorgeous too, reminded me of visconti’s work in that way. enough name dropping, i need to seek out his other major pictures asap.\n\nTwo in the Shadow (Naruse, 1967): most of this is stunning melodrama set up into stunning melodrama payoff, but the ending of this (and to naruse’s entire career no less) is…perplexing on a cosmic level. i love it. it is full of mystery and questions and desire and heartbreak and just leaves so many unanswered questions, a perfect mix of ambiguity and conclusion. i cannot wait to see more of naruse’s work, as that which i’ve seen has been masterful.\n\nNothing But a Man (Roemer, 1964): between this and Haunted (i will hopefully start a movement to change the name of his 1984 back to its original instead of its portentous re-label) i’m convinced that roemer is one of the greatest voices in all of american film, and it’s a travesty that he either wasn’t able to or interested in making more films. i still have more to see, but the fact that i could easily watch the rest of his film offerings tomorrow afternoon is still a depressing factoid. this one is full of life and emotion, of very real stress that doesn’t seem sugar-coated in a way that lesser filmmakers would be tempted by. in a world of hurt, his films feel like a loving embrace.\n\nwas busy at the end of july…but find myself even busier at the end of august. nevertheless, the show must go on. *s = new favorites.\n\nThe Approach of Autumn (Naruse, 1960): i’ve seen frighteningly little naruse – before this i had only seen Floating Clouds, which i also remember being great. this is a form of narrative that rarely moves me to great depths (melodrama focusing on children), but when it does, it tends to strike me powerfully. i’m impressed by his editing, his ability to capture narrative events with a rare degree of importance; each specific introduction seems wholly memorable. as an example: the kid loving beetles in this is just off-the-wall enough to be ingrained in my head, but not too much so to devolve into quirkiness. i should watch more of his stuff soon, even if this size of his filmography is daunting.\n\nTyll the Giant (Raamat, 1980): eastern european animation had a harshness difficult to overstate, it seems. this is likely the most hyperviolent of these shorts that i’ve seen; an estonian folktale with vivid, brutal depictions of the violent acts, hardly leaving them to the anonymous “and then the giant crushed the army” descriptions of such stories. the character’s faces are perhaps the most effective in this mold. they feel moody and meditative, like eyes that have seen thousands of deaths and will continue to see thousands more. really great stuff.\n\nThe Return of the Living Dead (O’Brannon, 1985): as an ambivalent appreciator of the horror-comedy genre, i kinda just nodded my head for the most part when hearing the greats of the genre fusion. i don’t have any problems with Evil Dead 2, but…i mean, come on. anyways, this is what all those supposed high kino horror comedies are supposed to be, in my head anyways. frequently hilarious, with dour kills and high concept work squeezed in. always feels like i’m watching a comedy that has respect for horror as a genre within itself, something shockingly rare (unsurprising, the balancing act is tricky) or the other way around (surprisingly poor judgment).\n\nThe Other Side of the Wind (Welles, 2018): there are about a dozen welles flicks better than this, and though i generally trust netflix’s hand here, it can’t help but feel like another massive missed opportunity like many of his other pictures are. though like The Magnificent Ambersons, the end product is still great in its own way. more often than not i was reminded of We Can’t Go Home Again, this sort of inscrutable sidewinder, never sure what exactly it wants to be, and i’m not exactly sure what’s going on in it either. i’m surprised the reception ended up being so positive – this is welles at his most confounding, even moreso than something like F For Fake or The Trial, and as late-period as it gets (welles had, of course, been dead for decades by the time this released…). but difficult not to get wrapped up in its chaotic energy.\n\nNothing Lasts Forever (Schilling, 1984): did you know there was a saturday night live film from the 80s that is high concept, extremely endearing, borderline experimental (who was doing maddin-esque golden/silent era hollywood throwbacks in 1984??) that has been shelved for decades for…seemingly no reason anymore? well now you do. never quite reaches the highs that it promises, but i really liked its commitment to the bit.\n\nLiu Lan (Fudong, 2003): there are a lot of 20 minute-ish black and white short films, arty flicks about nothing really, committed to the aesthetic beauty that is a disappearing format. and you know what? this is one of the best of them. recommended for Dawn Breaking enjoyers.\n\nUnrequited Love (Petit, 2006): this was a kg freeleech that i had been putting off for a while – do i really want to watch a petit film i’ve never heard of that has no real acclaim? as it turns out…it’s pretty great! has a similar approach to Terrorism Considered as an essay film, where it focuses on gettting stalked around london – though this one is more cohesive than that one (what isn’t?). the acerbic, self-deprecating tone throughout helps it not to feel too self-serious, and it isn’t quite cynical to the point of being grating – often a difficult balance to strike. i hope to see some more of petit’s work soon, though it feels as though i’m approaching him without a roadmap so to speak.\n\nOur Legacy (Poggi & Vinnel, 2016): big fan of Jessica Forever and got tired of waiting around for their followup feature, so i figured i’d go through a couple shorts. this one is the best i’ve seen so far – like their lone feature, it’s a look at love in the modern world. it hones in on the self-questioning nature of men, facing easy self-gratification from pornography or any other “easy” sexual pleasures, and weighing those (sincerely) with the beauty of romantic embrace, fit with its own challenges and anxieties. the visual ideas that p&v bring to the table are quite lovely as well; they thrive on these lo-fi CGI uncanny valleys like few others. i can’t wait to see what they get up to next.\n\nSambizanga (Maldoror, 1972): harsh and cruel and rough and beautiful and difficult to endure and necessary as any truly anti-colonialist piece is. also helps that maldoror has a command on the cinematic language and poetry of shots that few others do so early on in their career. i hope to see some more of her material one of these days.\n\nRhapsody in August (Kurosawa, 1991): the longer this went on, the more i found myself questioning how in the world this was a considered a minor piece. granted, kurosawa’s filmography is rife with masterpieces and hidden gems as is, but i’m surprised this is normally counted as neither. a look at a family still enduring the cataclysmic effects of nuclear war, this examines everyday trauma and how victims attempt to cope with decisions that happened so long ago but still harbor so much hurt in them. it’s a film of great pain, but also of great love. i highly recommend it for the kurosawa completionists, and really anyone else – it’s phenomenal, feels like you are both young and old at the same time on a bitter summer day.\n\nFox and His Friends (Fassbinder, 1975): european arthouse, of the criterioncore variety, occasionally dips its feet a little too far into the miserycore directions. and this one kinda does at times. but fassbinder is too talented, and too drawn to the humor in such situations, to let it get the better of him. the fact that so much of this is about tax and loan negotiations is pretty funny too; after the like 4th scene about it i couldn’t help but laugh at the lengths that the film goes to in order to explain what exactly fox got scammed by, as if the details are even that important. got some nice drip in this too, of course, the one nice thing that the manic pixie nightmare gay ended up doing for his lover.\n\nRedbelt (Mamet, 2008): the most immediate thing i have to give props to here is that mamet is the maddeningly rare screenwriter turned director that seems to know how to construct a shot and aesthetic; this looks incredible for a domestic drama/light action film. but more than that, for all of mamet’s blackpilled euphemisms and narrative beats that he throws into all of his work, this one features a lead who is wholly redeemable, caring, and never quite feels like some self-insert. the end of the film pointing towards a bressonian feeling of transcendence, yet one that is with coming to terms with your own power and commitment, is surprisingly beautiful and tender, especially for mamet. very, very impressed by this one – and while i doubt mamet has made much else worth considering, this is easily the one to watch if you’re on the fence.\n\nTopology of Sirens (Davies, 2021): the best slow cinema adventure film i have ever seen. alright with the funny back-handed compliments out of the way: i’m a big fan of endearing cinema, particularly that which is about niche interests, and this is about as endearing and niche as it gets. delicate, warm, pure, and has a fascination with music and the discarded instruments used to create it that i had always wished to see represented somewhere. i really hope davies gives us some more strange journeys soon, as i felt like i was watching something genuinely new and fantastic here.\n\nThe Movie Orgy (Dante, 1968)*: an absolute riot! the obvious bits are funny, of course; show me weird bible-themed BDSM ads and embarrassing boomer housewife food and i’ll always laugh, but it’s in dante’s YTP-esque editing that i feel like it is most powerful in. seeing this at a dingy screening with a dozen or so people going in and out over the massive runtime was an unforgettable experience, and i’m surprised how entertained i was throughout the whole thing. doubtful that dante has anything else quite like this, but anyone who makes a masterpiece of this caliber is worth respect forever i think.\n\nThe Annihilation of Fish (Burnett, 1999): like the rest of burnett’s work, it’s a tender, moving film about broken people. i really liked seeing the tics of these two; simultaneous schizos on complete opposite ends of the spectrum is not a commonly enough explored coupling in film. it’s rare to see filmmakers tackle love this pure, organic, and non-judgmental, and i’m not surprised that it was burnett who was able to pull it off in spades. hope to catch up on his other work shortly.\n\nAn Autumn Afternoon (Ozu, 1962): wish this guy was born in an era where color film stock was common, but alas at least we have this one to go off of. anyways, there’s an ancient proverb of some sort about how there are two ways to open a nut. the first is to smash it with a hammer, and the other is to let it sit in water for a long time until the shell practically falls off. the conflict in this reminded me of the latter; at the beginning it’s about a family that loves each other and friends who care about each other, and this never really changes the whole time. and yet still, characters undergo hardships, difficult questions, marriages, etc. it’s a beautiful way to design a narrative, and something i’ll look out for more in the next ozus i see.\n\nThe Wages of Fear (Clouzot, 1953) & Sorcerer (Friedkin, 1977): by sheer chance, i started on these right before friedkin’s death, compelled to finally knock them off my must-watch list. and, to nobody’s surprise, they are both incredible. i have to question the structure of both (why do we spend so much time in the beginning town in Wages and so little in Sorcerer?), and i wish Sorcerer in particular was like 6 hours longer, but both of them are frankly transcendent when they get to the truck-driving segments. would love to see equally talented directors remake this for the end of time (i thought of llinas while watching Sorcerer, and man….).\n\nKnock Off (Hark, 1998): hark is often remembered as being more consistent than he actually is (he has a ton of movies i’ve never heard a word about, unlikely to be anywhere near the caliber of his best work), though i think this is a definite highlight. jcvd is a natural fit for hark, the sort of antihero turned protagonist that many of his films feature. the plot of this nominally being about cheap knockoffs combined with the fact that so many setpieces feature…cheap buildings and vehicles breaking upon any contact with another object is an underrated bit, and honestly i don’t see anything in this that makes it noticeably worse than something like The Blade or even Saigon. i should really watch Double Time…\n\nHappiness (Solondz, 1998) & Storytelling (Solondz, 2001): finally got to this guy’s movies after over a decade of putting them off, and i’m glad i did. his work is filled with self-reflexivity; criticism of his characters and sympathy for their eccentricities, or love for them in spite of their genuine character flaws. on top of that, he’s one of the more talented guys to emerge from the 90s independent scenes as far as making cohesive films goes; i’m impressed at how effortless his movies appear to be so far, in spite of their troubling subject matter (or, in the case of Storytelling, their conclusions).\n\nNainsukh (Dutta, 2010): it’s kind of funny seeing something as singular and specific to its own culture and subject as The Color of Pomegranates and then finding out that there’s another movie in a completely different era and culture that is…basically identical to it from a formal perspective. dutta’s biopic-of-sorts traces the origins of its titular painter, the end result being a series of vignettes that allows you to “feel” the pieces before understanding them, to use a cliched terminology. it’s my first film by dutta, but i am eager for more.\n\nThe Ambulance (Cohen, 1990): from my very brief understanding of larry cohen, he seems like a guy who is basically the dream auteur for genre enthusiasts. that is, someone who fully understands camp as a concept, but not to the undermining of his understanding of what makes serious genre flicks tick, and who utilizes this pendulum of sorts to gratifying heights. this film is a perfect distillation of that: it never takes itself too seriously, and at the same time, never surrenders itself to the “well who cares it’s just a goofy movie” mindset, a particularly painful one to endure thesedays. can’t wait to see more!\n\nImaginary Light (Noren, 1994): what would be an erik reeds movie writeup without the avant-garde flick? anywho: i loved this, my first noren but he took me on a trip to the shadow dimension. or maybe the light dimension. either way, the images i came away from here felt like i was seeing the unseeable, the darkness in static and the beauty in chaos. i hope all of his stuff is as good as this, any abstract filmmaker who approaches the aesthetic of makino is one to be celebrated.\n\nTargets (Bogdanovich, 1968): the fact that the social commentary in this is borderline inexplicable adds a lot to its charm, in my opinion.\n\n*s = new faves, same as ever. watched more than i thought i would in may.\n\nA Better Tomorrow III: Love and Death in Saigon (Hark, 1989): after years of hearing about this, it was nice to finally sit down and watch the master at work. like the best hark films, it excels at being effortlessly cool, bombastic, exciting not only in thrills but in cinematic possibilities. more importantly, it succeeds as a touching film ultimately about the power of bonds in human relationships. many of the best hark films tread this line between machismo and sensuality, and few of them are able to do so while being as obviously commercial as this one.\n\nSouth (Akerman, 1999)*: begins as sort of an ominous talking head doc with a healthy dose of akerman’s landscape shots, very quickly jumps into horror. the communities primarily impacted by the sheer violence documented in the film – namely, the black community in a southern mixed-race town – are given the bulk of the screentime, able to share their own reactions and sorrows at the incident in question. the camera seems to linger on a town in a ponderous longing, questioning how something so evil and so obviously bile could happen in something that almost appears idyllic in certain shots. essential, grueling stuff.\n\nOne Way or Another (Gomez, 1975): this one had been on my radar for a while, and the sight and sound poll gave me a good enough excuse to finally watch it. and wow! pretty incredible! it’s this wonderful blend of narrative and documentary – something that is often advertised as a great formal step forward yet usually falls into similar narrative trappings as anything else, here in gomez’ hands it’s able to do all that it’s promised. one of the better essay films i’ve seen in quite a while as well, perfectly outlining labor struggles and class solidarity all within a very brisk runtime. all of the cuban films i’ve seen thus far i would consider to be great, gotta check more out from their industry soon.\n\nFlames (Arietta, 1978)*: kinda funny checking the reviews for this fairly obscure flick and being greeted with a barrage of big european names: dryer, chabrol, and oliveira came immediately to mind for me as well. the thing this reminded me a lot of was The Story of Marie and Julien, which i’m doubtful had any direct impact on rivette given its relative obscurity but it’s nice to know two artists made the weirdest, purest romance flicks out there. the low fantasy elements in this one never threaten to overpower the beauty of its narrative, and it’s quite breathtaking how arietta is able to weave the story itself together in a way that makes all of its components work – though the incredible techs certainly help a lot in that regard. need to see more of this fella for sure.\n\nSailor Uniform: Lily Lovers (Nasu, 1983): breezy, mostly unproblematic pinku film that, well, delivers on the title. probably one of the better softcores i’ve seen, which isn’t saying much, but it’s a relaxing watch that more or less functions as timepasser – the characters being passionate is a highlight in something that could have lacked chemistry and thus defeated the whole purpose of its existence.\n\nBreakaway (Conner, 1967): speaking of sensual, here’s a proto-music video (and, arguably, another softcore) from the madman himself bruce conner. only four minutes in length (and, even then, more like 2…) it’s able to exist as a fun little short which has a modern, kinetic approach to editing. always fun watching these pre-70s a-g flicks and seeing just how ahead of the curve so many of them were to what was going on elsewhere in the zeitgeist.\n\nCrippled Avengers (Cheh, 1978): went into this one expecting a minor shaw flick and i think one of these days i will learn my lesson and stop doing that because these guys really made like, dozens if not hundreds of great kung fu flicks. this one is fun in how it examines the injuries of the titular avengers and ultimately does show them to be a weakness – they’re used to the characters’ advantages sometimes, though ultimately the punishment inflicted on them is rarely romanticized, and the dual nature of the an"
