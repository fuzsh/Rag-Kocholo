        "text": "(1902–1990), film director, scriptwriter, and educator. In 1920 Trauberg moved from Odessa to Petrograd, where he worked as a journalist and participated in amateur plays. He also attended the Comic Opera Theater School and studied directing. In 1921 Trauberg became acquainted with the directors Grigorii Kozintsev, Sergei Iutkevich, and Georgii Kryzhitskii, with whom he organized Fabrika Ekstsentricheskogo Aktera (Factory of the Eccentric Actor; FEKS); their collaboration continued until 1926, first as a theater and then as a cinema collective that exerted great influence over the aesthetics of Soviet cinematography throughout the 1930s.\n\nIn 1924 Trauberg became a director at the Lenfilm Cinema Studio, and from 1941 to 1943 he held the post of artistic director of Tsentral’naia Ob”edinennaia Kinostudiia (Central Consolidated Film Studio; TsOKS) in Alma-Ata. In 1949, he took on the directorship of the Mosfilm Cinema Studio. Simultaneously, from 1926 to 1949 he was affiliated with theatrical institutes in Leningrad as well as Leningrad State University. From 1961 to 1965 he taught at the Graduate School of Scriptwriters and Film Directors in Moscow, becoming its artistic director in 1963.\n\nTrauberg collaborated on many films with Kozintsev; indeed, his only independent film was Aktrisa (Actress; 1943). The pair made their debut as directors with the eccentric comedy Pokhozhdeniia Oktiabriny (The Adventures of Oktiabrina; 1924), followed by Mishki protiv Iudenicha (Mishki against Iudenich; 1925), Chertovo koleso (Ferris Wheel, or The Devil’s Wheel; 1926), Bratishka (Little Brother; 1927), and Shinel’ (The Overcoat; 1927). These films adopted a style similar to the popular German expressionism. Later, their work, along with that of the entire Soviet avant-garde, began to evolve in the direction of classical literary and cinematographic traditions. This is evident in such films as Soiuz Velikogo Dela (The Union of the Great Deed [SVD]; 1927) and Novyi Vavilon (The New Babylon; 1929).\n\nWhen sound techniques made the silent screen obsolete in the early 1930s, Trauberg and Kozintsev’s film Odna (One; 1931) represented part of the triumph of socialist realist poetics. Their Maksim trilogy—Iunost’ Maksima (Maksim’s Youth; 1935), which won first prize at the First Moscow International Film Festival; Vozvrashchenie Maksima (Maksim’s Return; 1937); and Vyborgskaia storona (The Vyborg Side; 1939)—is considered their greatest joint project. It tells the story of Maksim, an enthusiastic young worker, passionate in his fight against the enemies of the state, who eventually becomes commissar of the state bank and an important party leader. During World War II, they filmed several short propaganda pieces, and after the war, they produced Prostye liudi (Plain People; 1945), a film that was banned by the censors in 1946 for “slandering the lives of simple Soviet people” and was not shown until 1956, after their partnership had dissolved."
