        "text": "When I first saw the film as a teenager, I was quick to mine it for insight into the minds and hearts of my parents and their peers, and the world in which they had come of age. When I revisit the film now, as a youngish adult in my own right, it feels as new and essential as I imagine it must have felt to youngish adult New Yorkers like me, four decades ago.\n\nMrinal Sen, the most radical of India’s parallel cinema pioneers, once said that his goal as a filmmaker was to “make things look unpretty, to keep the rough edges.” At first glance, his Ek Din Pratidin seems to belie that motto. Set over the course of a single night, the film captures the anguish of a lower-middle-class family when their sole breadwinner, a young woman named Chinu, doesn’t return home from work.\n\nIf all of Le Pont du Nord’s games, rules, and neuroses point back to a single theme, it is the fear of death, and the possibility (or impossibility) of cheating it. It’s difficult to say more than that, because for everything you could say about Rivette’s attitude towards mortality, the opposite would likely be just as true. Death is the chief subject of comedy, and at the same time the tragedy for which all comedy exists to compensate; it’s something at once unspeakably awful and unspeakably trivial, unimaginable even as it serves as the basis for all other imaginings.\n\nIt’s hard to think of anything as susceptible to the effects of time and social change as identity politics. So you certainly couldn’t call Wayne Wang’s Chan Is Missing an authoritative, timeless picture of what it means to be Chinese-American. It wouldn’t even be true to say it was a representative depiction of what it meant to be Chinese-American in 1982, when the film was made; rather, it ponders a range of possible identities within different social backgrounds and age groups in the San Francisco area, and that’s probably about as specific a description of the film as you can accurately attempt. Even so, Chan Is Missing—generally considered the first Asian-American fiction film to make an impression with mainstream audiences—remains not just a ground-breaking film, but also a witty, intelligent, mischievous attempt to mix identity politics (of an inquisitive, skeptical sort), social documentary, and genre parody. Thirty-four years on, it still looks brazenly inventive and bracingly fresh.\n\nLa Truite/The Trout, Joseph Losey’s best film in a decade, is a plum pudding for auteurists. Sexual ambivalence, elaborate settings and camera work, game-playing, the corruption of the bourgeoisie, the intrusion of an outsider upon a social body, you name it—there are the Loseyan leitmotifs in abundance. More important, The Trout was the most enjoyable film on view at Lincoln Center this year.\n\nI have a lot of influences. Anything that moves me influences me somehow. I take from European and Japanese films and also from America: The characters are really American. There’s something very American about the film and yet formally, it’s not traditional at all, it’s very untraditional. That comes from the way I write, which is backwards: Rather than finding a story that I want to tell and then adding the details, I collect the details and then try to construct a puzzle or story. I have a theme and a kind of mood and the characters but not a plotline that runs straight through. I think that’s partly why the narrative takes the form that it does. My first film (Permanent Vacation) was similar—and the two things that I am writing now I’m writing in the same way.\n\nThe stories are born in my memories, my dreams, in what I imagine and fantasize; it’s a very natural and spontaneous birth. I don’t specifically sit down to invent something. It’s a series of suggestions of the mind, thinking about things read, personal experiences lived, coming together with a pretext of some sort, a stimulus of the moment, such as the face of a man in the subway, the smell of a waft of perfume that passes, a sound I hear—something that evokes those fantasies and persons and situations that I have in me, and which almost by themselves organize into a form, provided I give them freedom and follow them on their path. It’s a matter of staying with them for a while, of making friends with them.\n\nJonathan Demme was very much a cheerleader. He was very helpful. His producer at the time, Gary Goetzman, was super supportive during the developing process. And Jonathan would look at what I was doing, and it was kind of outside of his wheelhouse, the things that I was doing, but he could offer really good advice.\n\nConcerned equally with gesture as confounded desire, Carax’s general sensibility is that of the excluded voyeur, a role he gives himself for his brief on-screen cameo (revisited with his pajama-clad turn in the prologue of Holy Motors). In Mauvais sang, everything is a product of sleight of hand—the film was almost entirely shot on a soundstage, thanks to a healthy advance on receipts from the Centre National du Cinéma—but it nevertheless resonates emotionally, carrying the distortions that come from looking from the outside in."
