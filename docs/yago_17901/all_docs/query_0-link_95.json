        "text": "This Master’s thesis examines the period of transition (1928-1935) in Soviet cinema when the avant-garde directors Grigori Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg, and Oleksandr Dovzhenko, among others, began to make films under the strictures of a new state-mandated socialist realist aesthetic. It argues, despite the prominence of literature which maintains that socialist realism precipitated a conceptual break that effectively ended avant-garde filmmaking practice, that socialist realism simultaneously preserved, developed, and negated elements of the avant-garde cinema. Using Katerina Clark’s The Soviet Novel and Louis Althusser’s “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses,” this thesis first illustrates the programmatic, narrative, and ideological continuities between the aesthetics in Kozintsev and Trauberg’s The New Babylon (1929), Alone (1931), and The Youth of Maxim (1935). These films exemplify how socialist realism perpetuated the modified bildungsroman plot pre-figured by the avant-garde, further transformed Leninism’s spontaneity/consciousness dialectic which ideologically interpellates individuals via social being, and began to utilise continuity editing in place of montage to construct overtonal ideological impressions. Next it explores continuities of visual stylistics in five films by Oleksandr Dovzhenko, Zvenigora (1928), Arsenal (1929), Earth (1930), Ivan (1932), and Aerograd (1935). Here the concepts of the “transitional film” and the “reduced form of stylistics” are introduced. The claim is made that the films made after the introduction of sound technology and before the official codification of socialist realism in 1934 represent a distinct hybrid of the avant-garde and socialist realist aesthetics and that a particular mediation of avant-garde stylistics through the new strictures was practiced. In the films of Dovzhenko, the continuing employment of three devices is identified to support the concept of the reduced form of stylistics: the use of the monocle (single element) lens, the poeticization of death, and stylised figure movement. In identifying the trajectories of plot structure, ideology, and stylistic devices in the transition from the avant-garde to socialist realism, this thesis elucidates significant continuities between the two aesthetics that embody a conceptual development, or sublation, in place of a conceptual break, or pure negation.\n\nThe subject of Western cinema on the pages of the Soviet Screen magazine in 1925−1927 was extensive and varied. Due to rather significant creative freedoms in the Soviet Screen in 1925−1927, photographs of Western movie stars (including photos on the covers of magazines), rather neutral or even positive biographies of Hollywood and European actors and directors, notes on filming and film distribution, reviews of Western films, etc. were widely published in 1925−1927. Although, of course, there were also ideologically biased materials on the pages of this magazine. Based on the analysis (in the context of the historical, socio-cultural and political situation, etc.) of the first years of the existence of the Soviet Screen magazine (1925−1927), the authors came to the conclusion that materials on Western cinema during this period can be divided into the following types:-ideologized articles emphasizing criticism of bourgeois cinema and its harmful influence on the audience (this included materials on censorship and perception of Western films by the Soviet public);-biographies and creative portraits of Western actors and directors (often neutrally or positively evaluating these filmmakers);-reviews of Western films (often positive);-reviews of Western national cinematographies (here, as a rule, criticism of bourgeois cinematography was combined with a positive assessment of works and trends ideologically acceptable to the USSR);-articles about Western newsreels (with approaches similar to reviews of national cinemas);-articles about foreign film technology, studios and cinemas (as a rule, ideologically neutral, containing calls to adopt technically advanced Western experience, in particular, sound film technology);-short informational materials about events in foreign cinema, about everyday details of the life of movie stars.\n\nThis collection of articles is one of the last achievements of the scientific project called Cinema in the Soviet Union at war, 1939-1949. This project was initiated by Valérie Pozner (CNRS, Arias THALIM) and Alexandre Sumpf (University of Strasburg, ARCHE, CERCEC) and its goal was to go way further than studies on a couple ofSoviet war films uniformly quoted by authors dealing with the role of cinema during the “Great patriotic war”. It meant to include in its scope documentaries, newsreels and cartoons in order to explore this crucial moment in the development of one of the most important creative cultures of film history.\n\nThe subject of Western cinematography was presented in a rather limited volume on the pages of the Soviet Screen magazine in 1957–1960. However, with the appointment of film critic Dmitry Pisarevsky (1912–1990) to the post of editor-in-chief the \"thaw\" tendencies in the Soviet screen led to a gradual increase in the number of materials about foreign cinema on the pages of the magazine (sometimes they took up to a third of the total volume of the issue). Increasingly, photographs of Western movie stars were published (in rare cases, even on color covers), neutrally or positively presented biographies of Hollywood and European actors and directors, articles about Western film weeks and international film festivals, reviews of Western films, etc. Although, no doubt, there were also ideologically biased materials in this magazine. Based on the content analysis (in the context of the historical, socio-cultural and political situation, etc.) of the texts published during the \"thaw\" period of the magazine Soviet Screen (1957–1968), the authors came to the conclusion that materials on the subject of Western cinema on this stage can be divided into the following genres: - ideologized articles emphasizing criticism of bourgeois cinema and its harmful influence on the audience; - articles on the history of Western cinema (as a rule, about the period of the Great Silent, with a minimum degree of ideologization); - biographies and creative portraits of Western actors and directors (often neutrally or positively evaluating these filmmakers); - interviews with Western filmmakers (here, as a rule, interlocutors were selected from among \"progressive artists\"); - reviews of Western films (positive in relation to most of the Soviet film distribution repertoire and often negative in relation to those movies that were considered ideologically harmful); - articles about international film festivals and weeks of foreign cinema in the USSR (with a clear division into \"progressive\" and \"bourgeois\" cinematography); - reviews of the current repertoire of Western national cinematographies (here, as a rule, criticism of bourgeois cinematography was also combined with a positive assessment of works and trends ideologically acceptable to the USSR); - short informational materials about events in Western cinema (from neutral reports to caustic feuilletons and \"yellow\" gossip)."
