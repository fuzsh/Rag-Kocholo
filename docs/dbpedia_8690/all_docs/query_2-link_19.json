        "text": "(born 1954). Canadian-born director James Cameron was noted for his action and science-fiction motion pictures. He wrote, directed, and coproduced the movie Titanic (1997), earning an Academy award for best director for the epic film. More than a decade later his movie Avatar (2009) knocked Titanic out of the number one position of highest-grossing film in U.S. history and took over the coveted spot.\n\nCameron was born in Kapuskasing, Ont., on Aug. 16, 1954. He was encouraged to study art as a child and, being industrious, would often enlist neighborhood kids to build elaborate underground forts or functioning catapults. In 1971 his family moved to California, where Cameron became an avid movie fan during his teenage years. He was greatly influenced by such films as David Lean’s Doctor Zhivago (1965) and Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). After high school, Cameron studied physics at California State University at Fullerton, but he dropped out before completing his degree. He was working as a truck driver in 1977 when George Lucas’ groundbreaking movie Star Wars was released in theaters. Seeing this movie prompted Cameron to become a filmmaker, and he taught himself the rudiments of operating film equipment and studied special effects techniques. He made several films on his own and designed sets and special effects for a low-budget production company.\n\nCameron made his directorial debut when he was hired to direct Piranha II: The Spawning (1981). The movie was a flop, and Cameron vowed to make only his own films in the future. He got his first opportunity to do so in 1984 when he wrote and directed The Terminator, a movie based on a nightmare he had had in which a robot from the future was sent back to the past to destroy him. With a modest budget of 6.5 million dollars, he had created a film that not only became a cult classic but also enjoyed box-office success.\n\nAfter the popular success of The Terminator, Cameron made a succession of films that used increasingly higher budgets and produced increasingly more innovative special effects. He wrote and directed Aliens (1986) and The Abyss (1989), both of which received an Oscar for best visual effects, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and True Lies (1994). He also found time to form his own production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, and in 1993 he established a special-effects production company, Digital Domain.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Cameron spent three years researching, writing, producing, directing, and editing the historical drama Titanic. He skillfully blended special effects with a fictional love story between a penniless artist (played by U.S. actor Leonardo DiCaprio) and an unhappily engaged first-class passenger (British actress Kate Winslet). Titanic stayed atop the U.S. charts for an unprecedented 15 weeks, earning well over $500 million in North America to become the highest-grossing movie in U.S. history to that point.\n\nAfter Titanic Cameron took a break from feature films. He created and coproduced Dark Angel (2000–01), a science-fiction television series about a genetically altered female warrior. Turning to documentaries, Cameron made Expedition: Bismarck (2002), showing footage of the sunken Nazi battleship Bismarck deep in the Atlantic Ocean. It won an Emmy award. Some of his other documentaries included Ghosts of the Abyss (2003), which explored the Titanic, and Aliens of the Deep (2005). Cameron returned to feature films in 2009 with Avatar, a science-fiction thriller that was lauded for its innovative special effects. Considered both a critical and box-office success, the movie earned Cameron a Golden Globe for best director and nine Academy award nominations including that of best director and best picture."
