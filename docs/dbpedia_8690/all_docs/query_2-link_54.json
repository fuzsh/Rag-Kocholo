He first found success with the Hollywood hit move \"The Terminator\" in 1984. He then wrote and directed Aliens in 1986 and The Abyss in 1989.

Cameron has also contributed to underwater filming and remote vehicle technologies. On 26 March 2012, Cameron reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the ocean, in the Deepsea Challenger submersible. He was the first person to do this in a solo descent, and only the third person to do so ever."
