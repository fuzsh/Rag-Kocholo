        "text": "As a boy, filmmaker James Cameron dreamed of a voyage to the deepest part of the ocean. This film is the dramatic fulfillment of that dream. JAMES CAMERON’S DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D chronicles Cameron’s risky solo dive to the depths of the Mariana Trench ― more than 11,000 metres deep ― piloting a submersible he designed himself. Discover a journey of historic proportions that celebrates science, courage and extraordinary human aspiration.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe Mariana Trench is deeper than Mount Everest is tall, by 7,000 feet.\n\nJames Cameron’s submarine, DEEPSEA CHALLENGER, had to be built to withstand 8 TONS of pressure. That’s like having to hold up 40 to 50 jumbo jets!\n\nThe pilot’s sphere in DEEPSEA CHALLENGER is only 3ꞌ7″ in diameter, and James Cameron is more than 6ꞌ tall!\n\nJames Cameron chose to make the pilot area a sphere because it is the strongest shape for resisting pressure.\n\nIn 1960, Jacques Piccard and Navy Lieutenant Don Walsh descended to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, but immediately went back to the surface because they couldn’t see anything. James Cameron was the first man to go solo to the bottom and was able to spend three hours there!\n\nMore than 180 systems — from battery packs to sonar — were operating during James Cameron’s dive. And at any moment, one of those systems could have failed under so much pressure.\n\nJames Cameron first sketched his idea for the design of DEEPSEA CHALLENGER on the back of a napkin, seven years before the actual dive.\n\nTHE MOVIE IN PICTURES"
