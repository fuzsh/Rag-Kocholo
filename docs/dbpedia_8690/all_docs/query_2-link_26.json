        "text": "“It’s a very similar tragedy where warnings went unheeded – to take place at the same exact site with all the diving that’s going around all around the world. I think it’s just astonishing, it’s really quite surreal,” Cameron told ABC News.\n\nHere’s how the 68-year-old makes and spends his money, and a look into his undersea interests:\n\nBox office hits\n\nMost of his fortune comes from directing, writing and producing three of the top four highest-grossing films of all time. They total US$7.3 billion together.\n\nFew people have the confidence of Cameron. Famously, he gave back his US$8 million salary for his 1997 blockbuster Titanic when the film went over its budget, and traded that for points on the back end, making a percentage of the profits instead.\n\nThat decision worked out pretty well for him – reportedly, he made US$97 million just from the immense success of Titanic, according to Deadline. And that was back in 2010, before two lucrative re-releases in 2012 and 2023. The 2012 re-release made US$350 million, while this year’s re-release has made US$70 million so far, per Box Office Mojo.\n\nHis three production companies are behind many hit films\n\nCameron founded Lightstorm, an independent production company, in 1990.\n\nHe founded Digital Domain, a visual-effects company, three years later. Digital Domain has been used by all of Cameron’s films, plus over 100 more like Dune, and various Marvel and DC films and TV shows.\n\nLastly, he created Earthship Productions, which has been behind all of his documentaries about ocean conservation, like Ghosts of the Abyss and Titanic: 20 Years Later with James Cameron.\n\nHe co-developed the 3D Fusion Camera System\n\nCameron and colleague Vince Pace developed the Fusion Camera System as a way to shoot in stereoscopic 3D – in other words, to shoot things with the illusion of depth.\n\nHis vineyards and properties\n\nIn 2020, Cameron put his Beaufort Vineyard and Estate Winery up for sale for US$5.6 million. Cameron originally bought the vineyard in 2013 for US$2.7 million. Seven years later, it went on the market for US$5.9 million before getting dropped to US$5.6 million.\n\nThe director moved to New Zealand full-time during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic with his wife Suzy Amis Cameron, after originally buying land in 2012, per Stuff.\n\nWhen the move became permanent, Cameron began offloading some of his US real estate, including his Malibu compound that actually consists of two side-by-side estates. In 2020, the two properties went on sale for a combined US$25 million.\n\nAccording to Dirt, by 2021, the smaller of the two houses had sold for US$8.2 million. That property comes with a single-story Spanish-style mansion and guest house with a combined six bedrooms, six-and-a-half bathrooms and 9,000 sq ft of space. Cameron had bought the home in 2003 for US$4.4 million, meaning it sold for almost double.\n\nHe bought the first, larger house in 1989 for US$3.4 million.\n\nIn 2014, he also sold over 283 hectares (700 acres) of land in southern California to a land conservancy group for US$12 million.\n\nNew life in New Zealand\n\nHis original land buy in New Zealand cost him US$20 million. He and his family grew fruits, vegetables and nuts, and until 2020, Cameron and his family sold their produce at their cafe and grocery store, Forest Food Organics in Greytown.\n\nIn addition to his land and farm, Cameron also injects money into the Kiwi economy by filming his films there. Like its predecessor, Avatar 2 was also shot in New Zealand and the coming sequels will be as well, giving work to 1,500 local crew members, according to Newshub.\n\nHe originally started buying land there in 2012, before continuously adding on to his hectarage as the years went on.\n\nHe and his wife founded food brand Verdient Foods, which was acquired in 2020 by Ingredion\n\nIn 2020, Ingredion Incorporated bought the Camerons’ final stake in Verdient for an undisclosed amount of money, giving Ingredion 100 per cent ownership.\n\nCameron has invested in luxury submarine brand Triton\n\nAnyone who knows anything about Cameron knows that the director loves the ocean, loves to deep-sea dive, and especially loves submarines. So, it’s no surprise that Cameron is an investor in Triton Submarines, according to Curbed.\n\nBesides the Deepsea Challenger, which he donated to science and had used to solo dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench – the first person to ever do that – Cameron reportedly owns at least one Triton, which costs up to US$3 million.\n\nHe also helped in the design of a US$20 million yacht with his organisation OceanX\n\nIn 2020, the 285 ft explorer yacht OceanXplorer was revealed, featuring a hi-tech, Hollywood-style studio designed by Cameron, Yahoo reported. The company’s website called it “the most advanced combined marine research and media vessel in existence”. Its voyages can be seen on the National Geographic show Mission OceanX, coming soon.\n\nCameron is a big motorcycle enthusiast\n\nApparently, Cameron owns at least three Harley Davidsons. During the Avatar 2 press cycle, many fans were quick to point out that Cameron was frequently seen wearing a Fox Racing shirt. Fox Racing is an extreme-sports, protective-equipment and lifestyle-clothing brand that many motocross fans love.\n\nHe also owns a Rolex Submariner\n\nGiving back\n\nCameron uses his wealth to back both land and sea conservation efforts. “I tend to be pessimistic about political systems and about human systems in general, but I’m optimistic about human beings. We’re resourceful. When our back’s against the wall, I believe we can team together to come up with the solutions necessary. And I believe we will be willing to make the changes to our lifestyle that we’re going to need to make,” he told CNN in 2021."
