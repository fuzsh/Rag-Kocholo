        "text": "â™ª >> Welcome to Canada Files .\n\nI'm Valerie Pringle.\n\nMy guest today is James Cameron.\n\nWho is a man of extraordinary energy and accomplishments.\n\nAn artist and a scientist.\n\nHe has directed three of the four top-grossing movies of all time.\n\nAvatar 1 and 2, Titanic, and changed film-making.\n\nHe is also a celebrated explorer who has led trail-blazing deep-sea expeditions including more than 30 dives to the Titanic.\n\nAnd a solo dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.\n\nI spoke to him at the Royal Canadian Geographic Society.\n\n>> Valerie: Jim, hello.\n\n>> James: Hello, how're you doing, Valerie.\n\n>> Very well.\n\nThere's a great line of Frank Capra's.\n\nWhich was, \"Only the valiant can create, only the daring should make films, only the morally-courageous are worthy of speaking to their fellow man for two hours in the dark.\"\n\n>> Valerie: I think this is you!\n\n>> I think that's fair.\n\nThat's the mantle or the burden that we have to accept, I think.\n\n...it's a meritocracy.\n\nIf people aren't interested in what you're saying, they won't show up.\n\nThen your career doesn't go anywhere.\n\nIf people are interested in what you're saying, showing, or how you're entertaining them, they will show up.\n\nBut every time you make a new film, you have that sense of how am I going to keep people entertained or reach them, especially emotionally.\n\nThat's when you face that blank page and start to write.\n\nI think that's the hardest part of the whole thing.\n\nEverything else is problem solving.\n\n>> But you write, you're an artist.\n\nSo you create these worlds then you figure out how to make them come to life.\n\n>> Pretty much, yeah.\n\nI've written everything I've directed.\n\nIt starts with an idea that's compelling to me.\n\nSomething that I feel needs to be expressed.\n\nOr that's in a area that I feel comfortable in, telling a story.\n\nSome people are natural storytellers.\n\nI think film-makers and writers are people that, if you can't entertain at a dinner table with a story, then you probably shouldn't be a writer.\n\n>> But the other thing-- and I love this line.\n\nIt was Bill Paxton said about you.\n\nYou love being told that something's impossible.\n\nThat you can't do it.\n\nIt is actually thrilling to you.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\nThat's just...telling me it's impossible is basically threatening me with a good time.\n\nBecause to me, I like hard problems.\n\nI like finding other people to work with that like solving hard problems.\n\nI love the comradeship of a team that goes up against a big challenge and prevails in whatever way.\n\nWhether you're building a robotic vehicle to go into the high-pressure regime of the deep ocean.\n\nWhether you're creating a story-- >> An alien mother.\n\n>> A liquid terminator.\n\n>> That was a hard problem.\n\nBecause we were right at the bleeding edge of computer graphics and animation...that was in 1990.\n\nBasically.\n\nAnd we had a little precursor of it in The Abyss .\n\nWhere we created the water tentacle, or the pseudo pod , as it was called in the script.\n\nAnd that was successful.\n\nThen you build--you don't just sort of go completely nuts off the deep end-- you sort of build in stages.\n\nBut I always feel I want to be at that cutting edge.\n\nDoing something new and exciting.\n\n>> And you have been-- motion capture...everything.\n\nHow have you changed films?\n\n>> Well, I think I was involved in certain kinds of vanguard periods with respect to computer graphics, for example, or CG.\n\nIt was right at the edge on that with a lot of people who have since gone on to really expand the tools.\n\nNow you literally can't watch a movie that doesn't have some form of digital visual effect or computer graphics in it.\n\nThat wasn't the case when we started down that path.\n\nAgain, that's the late 80s, early 90s.\n\n>> Tell me about women because all your protagonists... >> Yes, tell me about women.\n\nCan somebody please explain this to me.\n\n>> But your protagonists through sci-fi, all your movies-- adventure, you know, have all been women.\n\n>> Look, I've spent very little time in my life in therapy.\n\nSo I don't know what the psychological underpinnings of that are.\n\nBut I strongly suspect it was having a very strong mother, as kind of a role model.\n\nWho was always out doing some crazy courageous thing, joining the Canadian Army Reserve.\n\nComing home with a uniform and a rifle when no-one had ever discussed that ever .\n\nAll of a sudden, my mom is standing there in a uniform.\n\nLike that's kind of cool.\n\n>> There's Sarah Connor in my living room!\n\n>> Exactly.\n\nOr coming home as a nurse.\n\nIt'd turned out she'd studied nursing but nobody knew.\n\nShe decided to go back to work as a nurse.\n\nI had a prototype.\n\nThen I did The Terminator .\n\nI really admired films like-- Alien came before I did The Terminator .\n\nSo here was an example-- not my film, Aliens .\n\nBut the film, Alien , Ridley Scott's film.\n\nI thought she's amazing.\n\nThat character's amazing.\n\nIt just struck a chord with me.\n\nThen I made The Terminator .\n\nThat was successful.\n\nI thought, \"People aren't doing this.\"\n\nWomen at the time were the girlfriend, the wife, the love interest or femme fatale .\n\nThey were all these classic, somewhat sexualizedcharacters.\n\nI can imagine it wasn't interesting for the actresses at that time.\n\nSo I just thought I appear to be doing well with this.\n\nLet's do some more.\n\nIt always made sense to me.\n\nAnd no two of them were ever the same.\n\nMary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's character in The Abyss was completely unlike all the other characters I've done.\n\nI think Ripley is her own thing.\n\nI didn't create her.\n\nI think I expanded who she was.\n\nAnd what she meant to the world with my film.\n\nSo I had good prototypes, both in film and in real life.\n\n>> You're very loyal.\n\nYou use people, you know... Bill Paxton, Kate Winslet, even Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nYou have a team.\n\n>> Yeah well, Arnold is very loyal.\n\nOne of the things I've always admired about him is his loyalty-- he's always been loyal to me.\n\nI've always been loyal to him.\n\nI think when you have a good experience with somebody and you come to respect them.\n\nComing out of the end of that experience, and you're not in some kind of fight.\n\nI never wind up in any long-term beef with any of my actors.\n\nWe usually come out of it pretty much respecting each other.\n\nWhy not continue?\n\nThen there's somebody you know.\n\nIf you're not fast friends--I was very close with Bill Paxton.\n\nWe always looked for ways to work together.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way.\n\nKate Winslet is a great pal of mine now.\n\nWe'll just write each other, try to crack each other up.\n\n>> She'll get back in the water for you.\n\n>> She got back in the water.\n\nShe actually loves water.\n\nThis is a thing that people don't know about here.\n\nShe and her husband are really into board sports and things like that-- kite surfing and all that.\n\nShe's actually quite athletic and she loves the water.\n\nI think that's what-- there were two things that got her to make... the choice to be that character for The Way of Water .\n\nAnd in movie 3 as well-- same character.\n\nOne was she loves the water and two, her kids said, \"Don't be an idiot.\n\nBe an avatar.\"\n\nThat's the story that she tells anyways.\n\n>> Great line!\n\nIt's interesting when you read about making Titanic again, which I was doing before we talked.\n\nEveryone predicted total doom-- that it was the biggest loser movie of all time!\n\nThat the analogy of going down was what was going to happen to your movie.\n\nYou couldn't take a salary at a certain point.\n\n>> I think the media got a little too happy with their own interpretation of what was happening.\n\nThey got a little too happy with the metaphor of the sinking ship.\n\nTo the extent that they went beyond the pale .\n\nBy actually trying to be the architects of the failure of a film, sight unseen of a foot of the movie.\n\nAnd I think that was wrong.\n\n>> When you think that you've directed, written three of the four top-grossing films of all time, are you gob-smacked or amazed at how popular they are?\n\n>> Valerie: Does that surprise you?\n\n>> Well look.\n\nI think I'd be stupid to say I was surprised.\n\nBecause we go in and spend all this money on the principle that people are going to like the film.\n\nBut I don't want that to be confused for a kind of arrogance before the fact.\n\nWe're always biting our nails before we release a film.\n\nAudiences and tastes change.\n\nAvatar 2 came out years, more than a decade, after Avatar 1 .\n\nWhich was crazy successful but we didn't even predict that success!\n\nIt's a strange eco-poise between believing that you have something-- enough to spend a lot of time, energy and somebody else's money on.\n\nThen at the last second, absolute terror that it won't be received well, you know.\n\nAnd then, it works out.\n\nBecause you were actually right the first time.\n\nIt's all that second guessing.\n\nEspecially in the case of Avatar , there was a lot of nay-saying around that film.\n\nI actually saw a similar pattern to Titanic .\n\nOnce people actually saw it, then the film got to work its magic.\n\nBut we were definitely judged negatively before the fact.\n\n>> Avatar was personal for you very much, in the message in the world that you wanted to create.\n\nWhere did that come from?\n\nExplain that message.\n\n>> I mean I wouldn't want to say it was a message because... >> That sounds too heavy.\n\n>> The old adage, if you want a message, call Western Union.\n\n>> Sorry, bad word.\n\n>> Yeah, but there's definitely a theme or a motif there that I think people do respond to.\n\nI found that to be tremendously encouraging after the film came out, and after its wild success in all global territories.\n\nThat people actually did resonate to the message of we are connected to each other and connected to nature.\n\nAnd nature's worth fighting for.\n\nBecause that's what's going to keep us alive.\n\nIf we really still have that in ourselves, at a global level, then that's what's going to keep us alive.\n\nIs there enough of it?\n\nIt doesn't seem to be really changing the course of events.\n\nWe're still overheating, now 1.5 degrees is in our rearview mirror.\n\n2 degrees centigrade is probably where we're going to land.\n\nBut who knows.\n\nIt could be more than that.\n\nWe keep compromising with ourselves.\n\nIt's almost like the way addicts talk themselves into the next thing that they need to do.\n\nAnd it all makes sense in their world but it's completely delusional.\n\nI actually think that's what we kind of are collectively.\n\nBut if you can do something that reminds people of that inner voice that says we need to change.\n\nWe need to do something.\n\nThen that's at least a step in the right direction.\n\n>> I love the line that is repeated so often in the film, I See You.\n\nWhere did that come from?\n\n>> I was literally sitting there thinking up another culture and thinking what would somebody say.\n\nI was visualizing maybe two people from different tribes, or the same tribe, in Africa.\n\nWhat would the essence of what they said-- whatever the actual word would be, is I see you, you're right in front of me.\n\nHi, nice to see you.\n\nWe say it all the time.\n\nBut then I thought what if it was just, I see you.\n\nAnd what if it suddenly took on other layers of meaning like, I respect you.\n\nI see who you are.\n\nOr in the case the way Neytiri, Zoe Saldana's character, uses it in the first movie.\n\nWhen Jake returns with the big bird and fulfills the prophecy.\n\nShe says I see you with a sense of wonder.\n\nWhat she's saying is I love you and I see you for the first time for who you really are.\n\nMeaning I see into you, right?\n\nAnd everybody wants to be seen.\n\nEverybody everywhere just wants to be seen.\n\nSome people become extravagant extroverts to be seen, noticed.\n\nOther people just want to be discovered for who they are and they don't say a damn thing.\n\nBut I find that everybody's fascinating.\n\nEverybody's a universe, you know?\n\nThis sort of Trump-ian idea that there are winners and losers of the world.\n\nAnd all the losers aren't even worth talking to.\n\nThey're not even worth knowing or caring about, if they die or starve to death or whatever.\n\nIt's just so wrong.\n\nFrom a writer's standpoint, everybody is a universe.\n\nWhether they're rich or poor, whatever.\n\nThey've got something that's human in them that's worth listening to.\n\nSo I try to live by the ethos that I actually stumbled upon that people responded to.\n\nI thought if people are responding to this, it's for a reason.\n\n>> And you've got Avatars up to number 7 plotted out?\n\n>> I blurted out the other day that I've got ideas for 6 and 7...they've got about a page of ideas.\n\nSo let's not read too much into that.\n\n4 and 5 are completely written.\n\n4 is partially shot.\n\n4 and 5 are both completely designed.\n\nAnd mapped out.\n\nWe just have to get to it.\n\nIt's like building the transcontinental railroad.\n\nYou got to lay the track in sequence.\n\nWe're kind of halfway.\n\n>> I love your line that you say, \"I'm an explorer at heart.\n\nA film-maker by trade.\"\n\n>> So I want to talk about your work as an explorer.\n\n>> Thank you.\n\n>> Which began when you were a kid at 14.\n\n>> When you saw an underwater habitat.\n\n>> Sure.\n\n>> At the Royal Ontario Museum and you went, \"I'm going to build one of those and I'm going to get in it.\"\n\n>> Valerie: And you could put it in Chippawa Creek.\n\n>> Yeah, I did all that.\n\nI think exploration is something that starts maybe at the moment of conception.\n\nI think it has to do with your curiousity.\n\nBefore I even thought of doing underwater exploration, I was exploring the woods, the local animal population.\n\nI was collecting butterflies, finding snakes, frogs and all kinds of creatures.\n\nIt's that scientific curiousity, I think all kids are scientists.\n\nThey all want to know how it all works.\n\nThen most of them lose it.\n\nBut some stay on that curious pathway for the rest of their lives.\n\nThat's what a true scientist is.\n\nThere is a distinction between scientists and explorers.\n\nThere's a Venn diagram where there's an intersection set where you have scientist explorers.\n\nBut some scientists are comfortable solving serious problems in a lab.\n\nOthers--explorers have to go out and look with their own eyes.\n\nThey gotta go out there, get some dogs, go to the North Pole.\n\nGet in a sub, dive down.\n\nGet in a spacecraft.\n\n...go and be that leading edge--that tip of the spear for the rest of humanity that doesn't have that access, or that privilege really.\n\nTo sit on the top of a Saturn 5 rocket and go to the moon.\n\nThese are the things that captivated me when I was a kid.\n\nJacques Cousteau--these guys in their silver wetsuits and diving saucer.\n\nI wanted to be one of those guys.\n\n>> Well you became one of those guys.\n\n>> I became one of those guys.\n\n...I'm kinda..you know the movie, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou ?\n\nThat was my life for about 8 years.\n\nI kind of left Hollywood.\n\nI took an 8-year sabbatical.\n\nI did a number of deep-ocean expeditions.\n\nBuilt a lot of vehicles and systems.\n\nWent to incredible amazing places.\n\nMade films about that-- natural history films.\n\n>> Why did exploring underwater appeal to you so much?\n\nWhy was that important to you?\n\n>> It's funny.\n\nPeople ask why is this important to you?\n\nWhy do you build a sub?\n\nI never get that question from kids.\n\nBecause kids are like, of course you want to explore underwater.\n\nOf course you want to get in a sub.\n\nI think it's keeping contact with that child-like curiousity and sense of wonder, you know?\n\nI think we all make our compromises with the practicalities of life.\n\nAnd think oh, that's not possible or I couldn't do that.\n\nI've gotta finish college or, now I've got a child.\n\nWe all have the things that derail us off that path of child-like wonder.\n\nI've just tried to hold onto that.\n\n>> But you've had a couple of close calls.\n\nOne when you were directing The Abyss , and one when you were down by the Titanic.\n\nWhat did the pilot say, \"Oh oh.\"\n\n>> Yeah, you never want to hear your pilot say, \"Oh, oh\".\n\n>> Valerie: When you're at the bottom of the ocean.\n\n>> Yeah, well I was in the Deep Sea Challenger, down about 4 - 5,000 metres.\n\nI was filming an octopus that was walking across the bottom.\n\nIt was a pearl octopus-- kind of amazing ambulation.\n\nI heard this loud bang!\n\nI realized...something has imploded somewhere on the sub.\n\nIt's on film because I'm filming myself the whole time.\n\nI go, \"Oh well, I'm still here.\n\nThis is a great shot.\"\n\n>> Well, are you fearless?\n\n>> I don't know about fearless... >> Didn't your kids make you feel like okay, there are a few people I'm responsible for now.\n\n>> Well, I knew they'd be well cared for.\n\nMy wife's kind of amazing that way.\n\nShe's supported me in all of it.\n\nShe's a pilot--I support the things that she does.\n\nShe supports the things that I do.\n\nI don't know about fearless.\n\nI'm not claustrophobic clearly.\n\nI think there's a difference between being fearless and having legitimate fears of things and knowing that's what drives the engineering that we do.\n\nTo make it safe.\n\nI think it's more of doing the math on risk versus reward.\n\nThe reward for me to go to someplace no-one has ever seen, to bring back scientific data, to expand our human consciousness in that way is a risk worth taking.\n\nBut it took us seven years to build that sub.\n\n>> The Deep Sea Challenger.\n\n>> Yes... That was seven years of figuring out to do it safely.\n\nTo me, that was the challenge, the fun part of it.\n\n>> Then getting seven miles down.\n\n>> There's a moment when you say to yourself-- and it happened to me right after I reached the bottom and I called in and gave them the depth.\n\nI'm sitting there thinking there's a lot of water over my head.\n\nThat's a lot of pressure-- 16,500 lbs.\n\nper sq.in.\n\nThat's like having a stack of 2 - 3 SUVs on your thumbnail.\n\nBut distributed across the entire sphere.\n\nThere's a moment where that flashes through your mind.\n\nBut I never worried about implosion, per se.\n\nI was worried about other things.\n\nThey lose these giant half-mile or mile-long fishing nets.\n\nEventually they sink, go to the bottom and become ghost nets.\n\nIf a submersible ran into a ghost net, there would be no way for it to come back to the surface.\n\nYou'd be dead.\n\nSo you can't engineer against that.\n\nThere are some risks you can't engineer against.\n\nSo that's a problem.\n\nBut you accept that risk.\n\nBecause most of the risks you can engineer against.\n\nFire, electrical failure, loss of buoyancy control.\n\nAll of those things you build in safety systems.\n\nAnd our sub had layers upon layers of safety and backup systems.\n\n>> Wow.\n\nWas that the most powerful experience, being at the bottom of the Mariana Trench by yourself?\n\n>> It's certainly on my list of Top 10, you know.\n\n>> I can't imagine what the Top 10 list-- >> Well, being at the birth of your children, for example.\n\nDelivering your own children-- I delivered three of our kids myself.\n\nWith medical support standing by.\n\nThat's a religious sort of experience.\n\nI think of all these as spiritual experiences.\n\nSometimes it takes you awhile to even unpack what you've done and what it means to you.\n\nMy first dive to Titanic-- I wasn't able to unpack it until I was back on the ship.\n\nI was crying in my cabin... because I had deferred it all while I was there on the mission.\n\nThen I realized the impact of where I had been and what I had seen, later when the mission pressure was off.\n\nThat happens sometimes too.\n\n>> You still mark the April date every year?\n\n>> Every year.\n\nWe have a little email chain of the other-- we call ourselves rivet counters .\n\nYou know, the people who know so much about the Titanic they get so nerdy, your eyes roll back in your head after five minutes of talking to us.\n\nWe all sort of get around and say, you know-- tonight we're going to raise a glass to the crew, the designer, Thomas Andrews, whatever...is important to you.\n\nYeah, it's observed every year.\n\n>> But it's such a powerful metaphor.\n\n>> It's a metaphor.\n\nIt's an incredibly epic novelistic thing that actually happened.\n\nIt's a real event.\n\nIt's undeniable.\n\nIt happened.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nHow does it warn us about plunging headlong into things that we've been warned about.\n\nI think of that metaphor applying to climate change and maybe artificial intelligence and many other things that confront us.\n\nSo it always resonates.\n\n>> Why is a vegan diet so important to you?\n\n>> It's interesting.\n\nBeing 100% plant-based which I've been for 12 years, with my wife, Suzy, and some other members of our family that we've managed to convince.\n\nAlthough not our teenagers.\n\nThey're still burgers and pizza but they know better.\n\nSo it'll kick into gear at some point in their lives.\n\nIt's important for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, health.\n\nBut health wasn't my primary reason.\n\nIt was environmental.\n\nThe footprint of animal agriculture is so great.\n\nThe carbon and pollution footprint is so great.\n\nThat, just as a thought experiment, if every human being on the world just decided to eat 100% plant-based, we could re-wild 2/3 of the agriculture land that we currently have under cultivation.\n\n...that's a pretty amazing concept.\n\nNow that's not going to happen.\n\nBecause of culture momentum, how we were raised and what we've been taught.\n\nMost of which is wrong, by the way--delusional.\n\n100% plant-based diets are much healthier.\n\nYou live longer, have more athletic performance and energy.\n\nAll of those things.\n\nI felt that from the moment we switched which was 12 years ago.\n\n>> Are you able to say at this point, what you're most proud of?\n\n>> It's tricky.\n\nI'm proud of my kids.\n\nI'm proud of the movies including some that haven't made money.\n\nI'm very proud of my writing on Strange Days , from example.\n\nMost people, that's a footnote.\n\nThey can barely even remember.\n\nThe Abyss holds up very well-- didn't make a lot of money.\n\nBarely broke even I would say.\n\nNot a huge hit.\n\nBut I'm proud of that film.\n\nDefinitely happy with the results of the expedition work.\n\nA lot of science was published.\n\nSome nice films were made.\n\nAnd I got to be physically present, to physically bear witness in places that are astonishing.\n\nTruly astonishing!\n\nWhen I think back on some of the things that I've seen, looking through the port hole or through my HD camera system, you know, I feel blessed.\n\nOf course, it's not a blessing someone bestows, you bestow it on yourself with a lot of hard work.\n\nBut somehow the memory of all the work goes away and you just remember all the highlights.\n\n>> The wonder.\n\n>> It's all about the wonder.\n\n>> The final question we ask is what does being Canadian mean to you?\n\n>> Well look, I'm Canadian-born and bred.\n\nI'll always be Canadian no matter where I go or live.\n\nI'm currently living in New Zealand.\n\nBut I think like a Canadian.\n\nI was raised as Canadian.\n\nI'm proud of those roots and whatever the societal influences were to give me the value system that I take out into the world.\n\nAnd I try to bestow on my children as well.\n\nI could have easily moved back here.\n\nI wound up moving to New Zealand.\n\nAlmost a quirk of fate because that's where the visual effects company is that we worked with on the Avatar films.\n\nAnd that's where our infrastructure was built up.\n\nBut to want that value system for your children-- get them out of Los Angelos and Malibu.\n\nAway from all that craziness.\n\nI could have easily come here versus there.\n\nI've done productions and I have businesses and work here in Canada.\n\nI'm proud of Canada for what it accomplishes.\n\nFor being relatively small population as a country.\n\nAnd a lot of hardship being so far north and so spread-out, and so on.\n\nWhat we accomplish here is quite amazing, I think.\n\n>> Well, we're super proud of you.\n\n>> Well thank you!\n\n>> It's been a pleasure.\n\n>> It's been great talking to you, Valerie.\n\n>> Thank you.\n\n>> We'll be back next week with another episode of Canada Files .\n\nâ™ª â™ª"
