        "text": "Ontario-born filmmaker James Cameron attended a ceremony at Rideau Hall Thursday recognizing his appointment as a companion of the Order of Canada.\n\nCameron is the director of many of the biggest blockbusters of all time, including Titanic, Avatar, and The Terminator.\n\nSome people might now know Cameron has a connection to Saskatchewan. He spoke about it in 2022 on the SmartLess podcast.\n\n\"We have a couple of businesses in Saskatchewan. So I mostly get back to Canada to work on that stuff,\" Cameron said on the podcast.\n\n\"We grow yellow peas and fava beans and lentils â€¦ and we built a factory there for plant-based protein.\"\n\nCameron appeared in the province in 2017 to announce Verdient Foods, a facility to process organic pea protein.\n\nSaskatoon pop culture commentator Craig Silliphant said he's not surprised by Cameron's appointment.\n\n\"He's made his mark, not only on Hollywood in an entertainment sense, but I think more impactful things in the world. Especially, you know, food production and stuff like that,\" Silliphant said.\n\n\"I think it's well deserved.\"\n\nHe said aside from being a famous director, Cameron is a pioneer in new technology and has a lot of resources that he isn't afraid to pour into what he believes in. He said it's a testament to the province to have someone like Cameron investing and seeing value in coming here.\n\n\"He and his wife, you know, they eat plant-based and not meat. So they wanted to invest in businesses like this and they have, I think it started with like organic pea processing plant in the province,\" Silliphant said.\n\nCameron was not available for an interview Thursday."
