        "text": "Filmmaker\n\nPlace Of Birth:\n\nKapusaking, Ontario, Canada\n\nBest Known As:\n\nThe director of Titanic and Avatar\n\nA self-made giant of Hollywood, Canadian-born James Cameron went from set-builder to art director (for 1981's Escape From New York) to writer and then director of some of the biggest movies of his era, including Titanic and the Avatar films. James Cameron first broke through to fame when he directed Arnold Schwarzenegger in the actor's career-making role in The Terminator (1984). Schwarzenegger played a creepy cyborg assassin, sent back from the future to kill the mother of the unborn son who will save humanity decades later. Years later, Cameron and Schwarzenegger teamed up again for the smashingly successful sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Cameron also directed Sigourney Weaver in the box office hit Aliens (1986) and Ed Harris in the gripping underwater drama The Abyss (1989). Cameron's 1997 film Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, took Cameron to new heights: it broke box office records and won 11 Oscars, including awards for best picture and best director. After the success of Titanic, Cameron worked on a variety of non-feature projects, including the TV series Dark Angel (2000-02, starring Jessica Alba) and documentaries based on his love of diving and the ocean, including Ghosts of the Abyss (2003) and Aliens of the Deep (2005). After 12 years away from feature films, he made a spectacular return in 2009 with the effects-heavy sci-fi epic Avatar. The film was nominated for an Oscar as best film (eventually losing out to The Hurt Locker), and in only its second month of release surpassed Titanic as the highest-grossing movie of all time. In 2022, Cameron returned with Avatar: The Way of Water. After just a few months of release, it zoomed past the $2 billion mark in global box office grosses. Cameron has announced three more sequels in the Avatar series, to be released throughout the 2020s.\n\nExtra Credit:\n\nJames Cameron was married to actress Linda Hamilton, the star of his movies The Terminator and Terminator 2, from 1997-1999… He has also been married to Sharon Williams (1978-84), the producer Gale Anne Hurd (1985-89), the director Kathryn Bigelow (1989-91), and the actress Suzy Amis (2000-)… Bigelow directed the 2009 film The Hurt Locker, which beat Avatar for the Oscar as the year’s best picture. Bigelow and Cameron were both nominated as best director as well, and Bigelow won the Oscar there, too… The love theme from Titanic, “My Heart Will Go On,” was a huge hit for Celine Dion.\n\n4 Good Links\n\nGround zero for all his splashy sci-fi films\n\nWikipedia lists all his films, documentaries, and many other projects\n\nEntertainment Weekly looks back at Cameron's original iconic franchise\n\nFrom 1999, but still a great interview and bio\n\nSee also:"
