        "text": "Profession: Film Director\n\nBiography: James Cameron is responsible for some of the most popular and technically advanced films ever made including \"Terminator 2\", \"Titanic\" (1997) and \"Avatar\" (2009).\n\nThe Canadian's first success was \"The Terminator\" (1984), starring Arnold Schwarzenegger which he both wrote and directed. The film spawned a franchise, most notably \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\" (1991), which was the highest-grossing film that year.\n\n\"Titanic\" (1997) starring Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet was both the most expensive film and the world's highest-grossing, overtaken only by another of Cameron's film's \"Avatar\". Titanic won 11 Oscars, including Best Director for Cameron.\n\n\"Avatar\" is the first film to gross over 2 billion, earning 2.74 billion worldwide. The film is famous for its special effects particularly its computer-generated animation.\n\nCameron is an expert in deep-sea exploration and has filmed a number of documentaries on the subject. In 2012 Cameron became only the 3rd person to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench.\n\nBorn: August 16, 1954\n\nBirthplace: Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada\n\nAge: 70 years old"
