        "text": "Name\n\nJames Francis Cameron\n\nBirthplace\n\nKapuskasing, Ontario, Canada\n\nBirth date\n\nAugust 16, 1954\n\nOccupation\n\nDirector, Producer, Screenwriter\n\nActive Years\n\n1978–present\n\nNotable Films\n\nThe Terminator, Aliens, Titanic, Avatar\n\nJames Francis Cameron (born August 16, 1954) is a Canadian film director, film producer, screenwriter, editor, environmentalist and inventor. He is noted for his action/science fiction films, which are often highly successful financially and innovatively. Thematically, James Cameron's films generally explore the relationship between man and technology. Cameron also directed the film Titanic, which went on to become the top-grossing film of all time, with a worldwide gross of over US$1.8 billion; he also created The Terminator franchise.\n\nHis writing and directing work includes Piranha II: The Spawning (1981), The Terminator (1984),Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), True Lies (1994), Titanic (1997), and Dark Angel (2000–2002). In the time between making Titanic and his return to feature films with Avatar (2009), Cameron spent several years creating many documentary films (specifically underwater documentaries), and also co-developed the digital 3D Fusion Camera System. Described by a biographer as part-scientist and part-artist, Cameron has also contributed to underwater filming and remote vehicle technologies.\n\nBackground[]\n\nJames Cameron was born in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, to Phillip, an electrical engineer, and Shirley Cameron, an artist. He grew up in Chippawa, and in 1971 his family moved to Brea, California. There he studied physics at Cal State-Fullerton, but his passion for filmmaking would draw him to the film archive of UCLA at every opportunity. After seeing the film Star Wars, Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry. [1]\n\nEarly career[]\n\nHe started in the film industry as a screenwriter, then moved into art direction and effects for films such as Battle Beyond the Stars and Escape from New York. Working with producer Roger Corman, Cameron landed his first directorial job in 1981 for the film Piranha II: The Spawning, shot at Grand Cayman Island for the underwater diving sequences, and in Rome, Italy for most of the interior scenes. He was originally hired as the special effects director (and his hand in story-writing can be suspected under the H. A. Milton pseudonym on the original script), and took over the direction when the original director left.\n\nAccolades[]\n\nCameron received the Bradbury Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 1991 — but, being primarily thought of as a genre filmmaker, he did not receive any major mainstream filmmaking awards prior to Titanic. With Titanic, Cameron received the Academy Awards for Best Editing (shared with Conrad Buff IV and Richard A. Harris), Best Picture (shared with John Landau), and Best Director.\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to underwater filming and remote vehicle technology, the University of Southampton awarded Cameron the honorary degree of Doctor of the University. Cameron received his degree in person at the graduation ceremony in July, 2004.\n\nHe has been nominated for six Academy Awards overall, and received half of them, three Oscars for Titanic. In total, Cameron's directorial efforts have grossed approximately US$2 billion in North America and US$6 billion worldwide. Without adjusting for inflation, Cameron's Titanic and Avatar are the two highest-grossing films of all time at over $2 billion and $2.78 billion respectively. In March 2011 he was named Hollywood's top earner by Vanity Fair, with estimated 2010 earnings of $257 million.\n\nRecurring cast members[]\n\nCameron often casts certain actors more than once in his films. Cameron has mostly worked with Bill Paxton in The Terminator, Aliens, True Lies, Titanic and Ghosts of the Abyss. Michael Biehn was also in The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss and a deleted scene from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Lance Henriksen appeared in Piranha II: The Spawning, The Terminator, Aliens, and narrated Expedition: Bismarck. Jenette Goldstein appeared in Aliens, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic. In addition to starring in the Terminator films, Arnold Schwarzenegger also starred in True Lies. In February 2007 Sigourney Weaver was cast for Cameron's upcoming film Avatar after having worked with him on Aliens as lead actress.\n\nFilmography (Director)[]\n\nYear Title Genre Other notes Estimated Budget 1978 Xenogenesis Sci-Fi with Randall Frakes (co-director) 1981 Piranha II: The Spawning Horror 1984 The Terminator Sci-Fi / Action $ 6,400,000 USD 1986 Aliens Sci-Fi / Action $ 18,500,000 USD 1989 The Abyss Sci-Fi $ 41,000,000 USD 1991 Terminator 2: Judgment Day Sci-Fi / Action $ 100,000,000 USD 1994 True Lies Action $ 100,000,000 USD 1996 T2 3-D: Battle Across Time Sci-Fi / Action with John Bruno & Stan Winston (co-directors) $ 60,000,000 USD 1997 Titanic Disaster / Drama / Romance $ 200,000,000 USD 2000–2002 Dark Angel Television drama 2002 Expedition: Bismarck Documentarie 2003 Ghosts of the Abyss Documentary / 3-D 2005 Aliens of the Deep Documentary / 3-D 2007 Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand) Music video / 3-D pre-production with Marilyn Manson 2009 Avatar Sci-Fi / 3-D pre-production[2] $237,000,000 USD 2022 Avatar: The Way of Water Sci-Fi / 3-D post-production $250,000,000 USD 2024 Avatar 3 Sci-Fi post-production 2026 Avatar 4 Sci-Fi pre-production 2028 Avatar 5 Sci-Fi pre-production\n\nFilmography (Screenwriter)[]\n\nYear Title Genre Other notes 1978 Xenogenesis Sci-Fi with Randall Frakes (co-writer) 1984 The Terminator Sci-Fi with Gale Anne Hurd (co-writer) 1985 Rambo: First Blood Part II Action with Sylvester Stallone (co-writer) 1986 Aliens Sci-Fi 1989 The Abyss Sci-Fi 1991 Point Break Action / Drama with Kathryn Bigelow (co-writer) 1992 Terminator 2: Judgment Day Sci-Fi with William Wisher Jr. (co-writer) 1994 True Lies Action / Comedy 1995 Strange Days Sci-Fi / Drama with Jay Cocks (co-writer) 1996 T2 3-D: Battle Across Time Sci-Fi / Action with Gary Goddard & Adam J.

He is also credited with giving the Predator character the dreadlock-look, after sharing ideas with Stan Winston. His screenplay for A Crowded Room, a thriller about a person suffering from DID, eventually became a casualty of the long pre-production nightmare. A heavily-rewritten screenplay to The Crowded Room is currently being produced under the direction of Joel Schumacher.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nCameron has been married five times: Sharon Williams (1978-1984), Gale Anne Hurd (1985-1989), Kathryn Bigelow (1989-1991), Linda Hamilton (1997-1999, one daughter), Suzy Amis (2000-, one son, two daughters).He ended up canceling all dierections forward for this paticilar film because they had a gas leek in the studio.\n\nHe is also a member of the Mars Society.\n\nHe has been described by one collaborator, author Orson Scott Card, as selfish and cruel. When asked about working with Cameron on the novelization of The Abyss, Card said the experience was \"Hell on wheels. He was very nice to me, because I could afford to walk away. But he made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of working with people, I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people.\"[3]\n\nCameron has a famously explosive temper. The (London) Independent compares him with the tyrannical Attila the Hun: \"[T]he man is also, by all accounts, a nightmare to work with. Studios have come to fear his habit of straying way over schedule and over budget. He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, as well as his flaming temper - he's been called the film-making equivalent of Attila the Hun.\" [4]\n\nCameron Appearances[]\n\nEntourage\n\nThe Muse\n\nSaturday Night Live\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"I think the most important thing if you're an aspiring film-maker is to get rid of the 'aspiring'... You shoot it, you put your name on it, you're a film-maker. Everything after that, you're just negotiating your budget.\"[5]\n\n\"I love working with 3-D cameras. I don't want to go back to shooting on film. I don't want to go back to shooting in 2-D\" [6]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\n{{{name}}} at the Internet Movie Database (IMDB)\n\nThe Exodus Decoded\n\nLife's Abyss and Then You Die (Interview with James Cameron from the L.A.
