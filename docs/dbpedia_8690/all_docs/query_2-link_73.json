        "text": "James Cameron’s rise to prominence in the Canadian Premier League has been remarkable, and it’s attracted great attention both in North America and Europe.\n\nAccording to OneSoccer’s Josh Deming, the 18-year-old from North Vancouver is attracting serious interest this month from an array of clubs including Columbus Crew and D.C. United in MLS and the likes of Everton, FC Copenhagen, and Motherwell.\n\nCameron, who burst onto the scene with Vancouver FC midway through the 2023 Canadian Premier League season and ultimately became a core starter in Afshin Ghotbi’s young team, trained with multiple English Premier League clubs including Luton Town late last year.\n\nNow, it appears a transfer to a higher level isn’t out of the question this offseason.\n\nCameron cemented himself as a first-team regular in Ghotbi’s starting XI after his June debut, missing just one match from that point onwards. Nobody for Vancouver — and only three players across the entire league — played more U21 minutes than his 1,503. He played in all but one of the club’s eight wins in its debut season, finishing the campaign as the club’s leader in both tackles and duels won per game. He was nominated for the CPL’s Best Canadian U-21 Player award.\n\nGhotbi told Canadian Soccer Daily in recent months that the success of the likes of Cameron and TJ Tahid was a core starting aim for Vancouver FC and is a source of great pride for him and club CEO Rob Friend.\n\n“A big question for us was how do we create a club that creates pathways and mentors and helps to develop a platform and environment wherein we can develop the young talent?” Ghotbi told us. “This is really dear to us. One of our mission statements is taking local young players and coaches, developing them to become professionals and make a living of their passion.\n\n“We looked at young players and we gave players like TJ and James Cameron contracts and brought them into the organization and then gave them playing time. We want to continue improving players and developing players, that’s very important for the ownership and myself.”\n\nThis report of interest in Cameron comes less than a week after it was revealed that Cameron’s young teammate Tahid has headed on trial with Dutch giants Feyenoord.\n\nMeanwhile, on Thursday, Vancouver announced that key midseason additions Vasco Fry, Miki Cantave, and Renan Garcia have all signed guaranteed multi-year contracts to return."
