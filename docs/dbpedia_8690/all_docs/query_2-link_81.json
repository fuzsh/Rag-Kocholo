        "text": "Article content\n\nIn the spring of 1969, a newly-built underwater science station, Subliminos, was exhibited outside the Royal Ontario Museum, where it fired the imagination of a 14-year-old James Cameron.\n\nCameron would often travel from his home near Niagara Falls, Ont., to sketch the museum’s dinosaur bones, mummies and ancient helmets.\n\nThis time he sketched the five-metre-tall undersea laboratory and sent the picture, along with a letter, to its inventor, Dr. Joe MacInnis, a Toronto physician, marine scientist and underwater explorer. Cameron said he wanted to build his own undersea station and asked MacInnis for his blueprints.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

Cameron, meanwhile, went on to bigger projects as a Hollywood director, screenwriter and deep ocean explorer.\n\nMacInnis told this story at the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, where an exhibit featuring Cameron’s Deepsea Challenger submersible was unveiled. Cameron co-designed the Deepsea Challenger and took it on a solo dive more than 10 kilometres below the Pacific Ocean’s surface to the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, a place known as Challenger Deep.\n\nExploration is in everyone’s DNA: We’re hardwired to be curious. So, stay curious and explore\n\nJames Cameron, via video message\n\nIt took 10 years to design and build Deepsea Challenger. Made primarily from a high-strength, low-weight material called syntactic foam, it had to withstand crushing pressure from the ocean above it.\n\nCameron piloted the submersible to the bottom of the ocean on March 26, 2012. He was 10,908 metres below the surface. The force being exerted on the vehicle amounted to eight tonnes per square inch: the equivalent of two armoured Humvees for every fingernail of space.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCrammed inside a steel sphere encased in the nose of Deepsea Challenger — the sub sits vertically in the water — Cameron spent three hours exploring the seafloor in the first-ever manned scientific study of the deepest part of the ocean.\n\nMacInnis, now 86, served as a medical advisor and journalist on the mission, which required 60 days at sea. He said Cameron made hundreds of life-and-death decisions during that time.\n\n“It has the echoes of the Wright brothers’ first flight and the initial ascent of Everest,” MacInnis said of Cameron’s accomplishment.\n\nMacInnis’s long friendship with Cameron is rooted in their shared fascination with the ocean. MacInnis has acted as medical advisor and journalist on three of Cameron’s deep-sea expeditions and was invited to the sets of two of Cameron’s movies, The Abyss and Avatar.\n\nHe also helped Cameron reach the RMS Titanic. In 1991, MacInnis co-led an expedition to the wreck of the Titanic, which resulted in an IMAX film, Titanica. He invited Cameron to its world premiere in Ottawa and introduced him to the Russian submersible pilots who were part of the dive team.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCameron hired the same pilots to take him down to the Titanic wreck before he made his blockbuster 1997 film, Titanic, which earned him an Academy Award for best director.\n\nCameron sent a videotaped message in which he told the Ottawa audience that his obsession with the deep ocean and its mysteries began as a teenager in Canada. “Exploration is in everyone’s DNA: We’re hardwired to be curious. So, stay curious and explore,” he urged.\n\nJohn Geiger, chief executive officer of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, said the exhibit was designed to celebrate Cameron, a great Canadian explorer and filmmaker, while also highlighting the perilous state of the planet’s oceans, now under pressure from overfishing, pollution and climate change.\n\n“We want to drive home the message that humans are putting the planet’s oceans at risk, and we need to take steps to protect them and their fisheries,” he said.\n\nMacInnis has been scuba diving in the ocean for 70 years.\n\n“The changes I’ve seen are just depressing,” he said in an interview. “For me, the ocean is now a place that excites the imagination and stimulates the spirit, but also wounds the heart … From the shoreline to the middle of the ocean, from the surface to the seafloor, the oldest, most critical ecosystem is in serious trouble.”\n\nThe Deepsea Challenger will be on display at the Royal Canadian Geographical Society’s headquarters at 50 Sussex Dr. until Sept. 1. The exhibit, Pressure: James Cameron Into the Abyss, is free to the public.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nMeet uOttawa's newest bachelor of science graduate: She's 12\n\nObituary: The Ottawa man who helped shape Toronto's skyline and sketched the CN Tower on a napkin\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
