        "text": "Iconic director James Cameron has entered the prestigious Order of Canada list for his outstanding contributions to the movie industry.\n\nOn Friday, December 27, the Governor General of Canada, Julie Payette, announced the honourees list that includes 120 new appointments to the Order of Canada.\n\nAnd, Canadian-born filmmaker James Cameron is among the five people to be bestowed with the highest ‘honour of companion’ rank along with Nobel Prize-winning physicist Donna Strickland and former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.\n\nThe Order is conferred to felicitate people “whose service shapes our society, whose innovations ignite our imaginations, and whose compassion unites our communities.”\n\nJames Cameron will be awarded for his contributions to filmmaking as a writer, producer, and director.\n\n“Well, I was kind of shocked. It’s out of the blue and I don’t know whose idea it was but, look, I am definitely honored,” said Cameron.\n\n“I wish I had done more in my career, actually in Canada, but I am sort of making up for lost time the last few years with our investments in the Prairie provinces, especially in Saskatchewan around the Saskatoon area.”\n\nVerdient Foods\n\nThe executive producer of the latest pro-vegan documentary – The Game Changers is also an investor in Verdient Foods, a plant-based company he cofounded with his wife Suzy Amis.\n\nThe couple also support numerous eco-causes, including Global Green and Oceana.\n\nSpeaking on his association with Verdient Foods, the Director said:“We tried to find something that was less well understood and was a major lever that could effect change.\n\n“We felt that [food] was one of the least well served, least understood, and biggest, most important ways that we could effect change.”\n\nMoving forward\n\nThe Hollywood heavyweight hopes that the order will highlight not only his film career but also his passion to drive scientific sustainable practices to save the planet and minimize the environmental damage caused by the meat industry.\n\n“For me it’s less about looking back and more about moving forward,” he said.\n\n“Nobody wants to talk about the food business but it’s the quickest way for us to turn down the thermostat on global climate.\n\n“If we can make money in the plant protein area, then other people will do it, and that will foster more products that make it easier for people to transition from meat and dairy into a whole-food, plant-based diet.”\n\nRead: James Cameron says people need to ‘Wake the f*** up’ over climate change and ditch meat\n\nWhat do you think of James Cameron’s plant-based advocacy?
