        "text": "(1954â€“ )\n\nCanadian-born US film director, whose high-budget high-tech movies have proved hugely successful at the box office.\n\nJames Cameron was born in Kapuskasing, Canada, before moving to the USA, where he graduated in physics from California State University. After university he worked in Roger Corman's New World Pictures, where he built miniature sets before progressing to the post of art director on such science-fiction films as Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) and Galaxy of Terror (1981). He established his own distinctive style as a director at the age of thirty with The Terminator (1984), a violent futuristic fantasy starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, which became enormously successful at the box office. Its sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), enjoyed a vastly increased budget (making it the most expensive film to date), most of which was spent on stunning state-of-the-art computer effects. The stunt-packed True Lies (1994), demonstrated Cameron's mastery of technical trickery yet again. However, everything in Cameron's previous career has now been surpassed by the extraordinary tour-de-force of his Titanic (1997), which set a new budget record, proved cinema's biggest ever success at the box office, and won eleven Oscars, thereby equalling the record of Ben Hur in 1960."
