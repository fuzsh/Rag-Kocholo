        "text": "Another Eagle is being sent on international duty as VFC defender James Cameron is answering the call to represent Canada’s U-20 Men’s National team in a series of international friendlies later this month.\n\nThis is Cameron’s second call up to Canada at the U-20 level as he was previously part of the team who qualified for the 2024 U-20 Concacaf Championship back in February of this year. In that qualification tournament, Cameron played in all three of Canada’s matches and got to experience 146 minutes of what it means to represent his home country.\n\nNow, Cameron is joining Canada in three international friendly matches to help the squad gear up for the Championship tournament which is set to take place from Friday, Jul. 19 to Sunday, Aug. 4 in Mexico. The native of North Vancouver is heading to La Calera, Chile as Canada takes on hosts Chile on Wednesday, Jun. 19, followed by Ecuador on Friday, Jun. 21, and will close out the trio against Paraguay on Sunday, Jun. 23.\n\nFor his hometown team, Cameron has made 24 appearances across all competitions since joining VFC on a Developmental contract in May 2023. The 19-year-old defender made his professional debut nearly a full year ago on Jun. 11, 2023 before signing his first professional contract with Vancouver on Jul. 20, 2023.\n\nCameron had a breakout season in 2023, starting in all but two of his 19 appearances and registered 1,504 minutes played which significantly contributed to Vancouver’s league-mandated 2,000 domestic U-21 minutes. The youngster scored his first professional goal on Sept. 9, 2023 with a game-winner against Atlético Ottawa in added time. For his efforts in 2023, Cameron was nominated for the Canadian Premier League (CPL)’s Best Canadian U-21 Player award in October of last year.\n\nSo far in 2024, Cameron has made one start in five appearances including registering 49 minutes in Vancouver’s lone Canadian Championship match against Cavalry FC. Cameron will be away from Vancouver for the team’s two upcoming CPL matches on Sunday, Jun. 16 against Cavalry FC at the Apple Bowl in Kelowna for the CPL “On Tour” series, and on Sunday, Jun. 23 against Halifax Wanderers FC.\n\nCameron is the second VFC player to be called up to international duty in this window following the club’s confirmation last Friday that attacker Mikaël Cantave is representing Haiti in a pair of FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Haiti earned a 2-1 victory over St. Lucia on Thursday, Jun. 6 and will now face Barbados on Sunday, Jun. 9. Cantave will also be unavailable for Vancouver’s selection in the CPL-side’s upcoming match against York United FC on Sunday, Jun. 9."
