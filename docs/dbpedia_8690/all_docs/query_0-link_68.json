        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Director , Producer , Screenwriter more\n\nNationality Canadian\n\nBirth August 16, 1954 (Kapuskasing, Ontario – Canada)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nJames Cameron began his career as art director, layout artist, and projectionist for a Roger Corman- produced film , Space Mercenaries , in 1980. He moved on to directing his first film until 1981 with Piranha 2 – The Flying Killers . A not very prolific filmmaker, he still managed to give science fiction cinema its letters of nobility with great reinforcement of revolutionary special effects, and this in only four films for which he also wrote the scripts: Terminator (1984) , Aliens the Return (1986), Abyss (1989), and Terminator 2 (1991).\n\nThree years after the second Terminator, he reunited with Arnold Schwarzenegger and scored one of the biggest successes of 1994, with the muscular remake of Claude Zidi ‘s La Totale , True Lies . In the meantime, he produced Point Break (1991), and another science fiction film, Strange Days , both feature films by Kathryn Bigelow . Considered the most profitable director of his generation thanks to the unprecedented success of Titanic (1997), the biggest success in the history of cinema with more than 600 million dollars in revenue on American soil alone and more than 1.8 billion dollars in international revenue, Cameron takes advantage of his aura to embark on more atypical projects. In 2003, he returned to the wreck of the Titanic for the documentary Ghosts of the Titanic, shot with a revolutionary three-dimensional shooting system and presented out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2005 James Cameron began the very long filming (around 4 years) of a film whose story and universe he began to imagine 15 years earlier: it was Avatar . This 3D science fiction film released at the end of 2009 with a record budget (around $500,000,000) highlights emerging stars like Sam Worthington or Zoe Saldana as well as established actors and actresses such as Stephen Lang or Sigourney Weaver . (which James Cameron finds 23 years after Aliens Returns ). With Avatar, he broke his own record by collecting more than 2.5 billion dollars worldwide. Building on this success, the Canadian quickly launched into the design of four sequels to Avatar, but also into the writing and production of\n\nAlita: Battle Angel , adapted from the famous manga Gunnm (which he has been particularly fond of for many years). He entrusted the direction to Robert Rodriguez and the film was released in early 2019. After several filming postponements, Avatar: The Way of Water was released at the end of 2022. The third part is currently scheduled for December 18, 2024. , the 4th for December 16, 2026 and the 5th for December 20, 2028."
