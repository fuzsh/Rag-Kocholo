        "text": "“The choice, however, is as clear now for nations as it was once for the individual: peace or extinction. ” 1 and Lester B. Pearson was definitely a man of peace. To those who don’t know who Lester B. Pearson is, he’s the fourteenth Prime Minister of Canada, that served from April 22. 1963 - April 20. 1968 2. During his time as Prime Minister, he’s accomplished many things, and that’s why I believe that Lester B. Pearson is the greatest Canadian.\n\nI few things about Stephen Lewis and why I think he should take second place as the best Canadian. A few things about Stephen Lewis is that he was born on November 11th, 1937 in Ottawa and is 79 years old. Lewis came from a family of three siblings, two sisters and one brother, his dad’s name is David Lewis and his mom’s name is Sophie Lewis. Stephen went to school at the university of Toronto and studied sociology and politics. Stephen was exposed to politics at a young age due to his father who was the national secretary of the co-operative commonwealth federation, that's why he chose to study politics.\n\nOver the years, plenty of great Canadians have achieved and shaped Canada to what is it today. One individual by the name of Lester Bowles Pearson changed Canada in a way very few have. Pearson was born in 1897 in a small town just outside of Toronto (www.nobelprize.org). His parents Edwin Pearson and Annie Sarah raised him. Little did they know their son would be one of the greatest Canadians of all time. Pearson was known as a diplomat, professor, historian and the Prime Minister of Canada from 1963-1968(www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca). Lester B. Pearson was a remarkable man with a dream to put Canada on the map and he did so not only in a domestic way, but also in an international way. In particular, his idea to give Canada a new flag,\n\nThroughout Canadian history, a plenty of figures appeared to be significant for the time being. However, out from this great number of candidates that may qualify for the most important Canadian in history, William Lyon Mackenzie King prevails. First elected in 1921 after the Borden's Unionist government failed, Mackenzie King served as the longest serving Canadian head of government ever, holding the office of prime minister for 22 years. During his premiership, Canada developed from an attacked British colony to a major international player, building cornerstones for the golden age of Canadian diplomacy. His war policy made Canada an important contributor in the Allied forces during the World War II, giving supports for British and other\n\nAs a teenager, Pierre Trudeau attended Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, a French-speaking Jesuit institution. At home, the Trudeaus spoke a mixture of French and English, so Pierre found the transition from an English school to a French one quite effortless . His interest in politics has waned slightly. Instead, he wanted to become a sea captain, explorer, or an astronaut, a term not yet coined. He loved to travel, and just before he had graduated from high school, he toured the Gaspé Region on foot, rode through the three Maritime Provinces on a motorcycle, visited British Columbia, and took a train to Mexico.\n\nPierre Elliot Trudeau was arguably one of the most vivacious and charismatic Prime Ministers Canada has ever seen. He wore capes, dated celebrities and always wore a red rose boutonniere. He looked like a superhero, and often acted like one too. Some of the landmark occurrences in Canadian history all happened during the Trudeau era, such as patriating the constitution, creating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the 1980 Quebec Referendum. However, it is Trudeau’s 1969 “white paper” and the Calder legal challenge which many consider to be one of his most influential contributions to Canadian history.\n\nPierre Philippe Yves Elliot Trudeau, better known as Pierre Trudeau, was an author, a university professor, a lawyer and a politician. Through his political actions, as well as through his personality, he stimulated a great deal of emotions, both positive and negative, among the Canadian public. Thus making him a very memorable figure. He introduced important political initiatives, which strongly influenced many aspects of Canadian political and private life. His significance is still recognized by Canadians at present, which is illustrated by the fact that in 2004, he was selected as the\n\n\"Star Wars\" was arguably the first in a new breed of high concept, high budget sci-fi action films. It was directed by George Lucas and originally released in only a few cinemas in 1977. However, the buzz around the film grew, and it is now one of the highest grossing films of all time, and along with its sequels, prequels and re-mastered re-releases, has a large cult following. I feel this is because of Lucas` ability to engage the audience through careful use of sound and camera technique;\n\nSince confederation, Canada has been a nation that is completely different to the rest of the world. Citizens embrace different cultures, religions and ethnicities as their own. When a civic nation is born there are always going to be discrepancies; not everyone is united under one idea. Therefore, loyalties begin to contend with each other which has resulted in the Canada we live in today. Separatists are amongst the majority. Quebec, The Maritimes, Cascadia, The West, all want to be independent from the government run within Ontario. As citizens we must ask ourselves, if the confederation in 1867 was offered to us today, would we accept?\n\nFormer prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, believed greatly in what he thought Canada was to become. “The nineteenth century was the century of the United States. I think that we can claim that is it Canada that shall fill the twentieth century. “ was said by Laurier and his words passed almost without notice at the time. However, it did not take long before his words had somehow been transformed into the most famous phrase in Canadian history, “The twentieth century belongs to Canada.” His words showed great confidence and pride in the actions that Canada was supposedly to take to fulfill his vision. He believed that Canada would fill the century, not in size or military might but in progress, growth, and quality of life. Ultimately, he\n\nThis essay will show you how Canada was at the turn of the century in 1896 to 1919. A lot of points show how Canada was at the turn of the century such as how Canada was at a time of social change, the immigrants in Canada come from all over the world, Chinese were treated horribly, a lot of racism factored into this.
