Conversely, any “non-Canadian” content would be punished by getting bumped to the back of users’ recommendations — or hidden entirely.\n\nAvatar only meets one of the four criteria by which the CRTC (Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission) officially certifies a film as “Canadian content.”\n\nThe movie satisfies the requirement that “the producer must be Canadian,” but fails a complex checklist of other metrics by which Ottawa officially denotes a program’s Canadianness.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAmong other things, one of the lead actors must have a Canadian passport and 75 per cent of the film’s production expenses must be put up by Canadians. Cameron would also have needed to track down a Canadian citizen to act as the film’s composer, production designer or director of photography.\n\nThanks to these rules, a not-insignificant number of films that are casually regarded as Canadian cinema do not meet Ottawa’s official test.\n\nThis includes virtually the entire oeuvre of Canadian actors such as Jim Carrey, Mike Myers or Ryan Reynolds. Even Reynolds’ decision to shoot much of Deadpool 2 in Vancouver didn’t get it past CRTC scrutiny.\n\nThe same treatment was given to Pixar’s Turning Red. Despite taking place in Canada, being written by a Canadian and starring a heavily Canadian cast, the movies’ largely foreign financing is what lost it Cancon status.\n\nConversely, plenty of films with no Canadian plotlines or characters whatsoever technically qualify as Canadian content. This includes the 2014 documentary Monsoon, which profiles a weather phenomenon that doesn’t occur in Canada, but gets the Cancon designation anyway thanks to the composition of its funding and production staff.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBorn in Kapuskasing, Ont., Cameron spent much of his childhood in Chippawa, just outside Niagara Falls.\n\nCameron has frequented credited a Chippawa teacher Ian McKenzie with inspiring him to start a school theatre troupe and ultimately putting him on the path to becoming a filmmaker. “He came up to me in the hallway one day and he said, ‘You have unlimited potential,'” Cameron said in 2020.\n\nAmong Canadians who relocate to Hollywood, it’s common to secure joint U.S. citizenship or abandon their Canadian passport altogether.\n\nBut Cameron remains an exclusively Canadian citizen; he tore up his last application for U.S. citizenship in protest over the 2004 re-election of U.S. President George W. Bush.\n\n“I’m Canadian, motherf—-r,” is how Cameron described his citizenship during a 2012 appearance on U.S. late night television.\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water is poised to be the third time that the Canadian filmmaker has written, produced and directed a movie that went on to become the highest-grossing in history. Cameron first did it with 1997’s Titanic and then again with the original Avatar, released in 2009.\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
