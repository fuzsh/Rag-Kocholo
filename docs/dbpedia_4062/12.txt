Subject and Association Description

Commander Eric Augustas Feldt (1899-1968) was Leader of Coastwatchers of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in World War II, 1939-43. Born in Ingham, Queensland, to Swedish immigrants, he was selected in 1913 for the Royal Australian Naval College's first intake of cadets. Graduating in 1917, he served in World War I. In 1923, after leaving the RAN and being placed on its retired list, he joined the Administrative Service of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. in 1933 in Brisbane he married Nancy Lynette Echlin, a daughter of South African War veteran Richard Boyd Echlin.

In 1939, Feldt transferred to the RAN emergency list, and on the outbreak of war was posted to Port Moresby. He then travelled across Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands to recruit civilians for the Coastwatcher service, a task for which he was well suited. As the Japanese Army swept southward in 1942 many of his team found themselves behind enemy lines. Feldt offered them firm support as they courageously continued to report sightings of enemy aircraft and ships. Coastwatchers made significant contributions to the Pacific War, particularly the Battle for Guadalcanal, with their messages alerting Allies of approaching attacks. Besides intelligence gathering, they rescued many servicemen, civilians and Indigenous people.

Feldt's responsibilities led to his suffering a heart attack at Guadalcanal in 1943, and he had to resign his command. While convalescing in Brisbane he wrote a book, The Coast Watchers, published in 1946. He was appointed OBE in 1944. In 1959, at the opening of the Coastwatchers Memorial Lighthouse at Madang, he unveiled a honour roll of those who had given their lives. Following his death in Brisbane in 1968, his ashes were scattered at sea off the Madang Memorial.
