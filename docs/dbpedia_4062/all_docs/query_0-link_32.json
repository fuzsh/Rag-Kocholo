        "text": "Revised edition, with additions to June 2011\n\nPREFACE\n\nThis bibliography lists histories and selected contemporary accounts of the University of Iowa and many of its colleges, departments, and other programs. Faculty biographies are placed with the appropriate departments. Both published and unpublished works are included: Typescripts, term papers, master’s theses, doctoral dissertations, oral history transcripts, articles, and books. Two very useful general works are a scholarly history by Stow Persons (37) and a pictorial history by John C. Gerber (21). The most comprehensive study of historic Old Capitol and its restoration is by Margaret N. Keyes (827). Scholarly and popular writers have explored many specific areas, but many subjects and approaches are still available for treatment. The works listed are not equally reliable; the reader must judge the accuracy and usefulness of each one.\n\nThis bibliography is located in Archives, and is cataloged as such: Z5816 .I68R6 1997 cop.16. Copies of nearly all of the works listed may be found (1) in the University of Iowa Archives (located in the Special Collections Department on the third floor of the Main Library), (2) elsewhere in the University Libraries, or (3) in the State Historical Society of Iowa-Iowa City. Many can be found in more than one location as noted in abbreviated italic notes at the end of each entry. For a list of locations described fully, click here. Items highlighted in blue are available online; blue indicates an active link you need merely click on. The locations noted are not exhaustive, and while care has been taken to confirm them, changes in records over time may have created errors here. To confirm locations, use both online and card catalogs or ask Libraries’ staff for assistance.\n\nIn addition to University Archives holdings of unpublished university records of permanent administrative and historical value, faculty papers, audiovisual materials, and vertical files on buildings, departments, faculty, organizations, and other subjects, historical information can be found in such printed sources as alumni registers, budgets (Internal Allocations), catalogs (fLD2557), commencement programs, course schedules, departmental minutes and newsletters, directories (faculty, staff, and student), Iowa Alumni Quarterly (title varies), Iowa Alumnus, Iowa Journal of Literary Studies, The Iowa Review, Pharmaceutical Alumni Association Proceedings (1st, 1897, includes histories), Philological Quarterly, regents minutes and reports, student newspapers (Daily Iowan, S.U.I. Quill, Vidette-Reporter), University of Iowa News Bulletin, University of Iowa Service Bulletin, and Hawkeye yearbooks (fLD2577.H3). The Hawkeye, vol. 2, 1893, includes histories. The Iowa Alumnus (Iowa City, 1903-24) is especially useful for activities and obituaries of alumni and faculty, discussions of current university issues, athletics, and photographs.\n\nThe University of Iowa Libraries, State Historical Society of Iowa, and Iowa City Public Library have motion picture film, videotapes, and still photographs on student protest, 1960s-1970s. For a summary of Archives holdings, click here.\n\nThe names of the three state universities in Iowa have changed several times and the similarity of their names has led to confusion among them. The works in this bibliography all concern the University of Iowa, Iowa City, and its former branches, at least in part. The University of Iowa was for much of its existence named State University of Iowa (SUI), in the nineteenth century sometimes reworded as Iowa State University, which should not be confused with the present Iowa State University in Ames. In popular usage, the word “State” was dropped from “State University of Iowa” in 1964.\n\nInformation on specific topics may often be found in works listed under more general headings. Many subjects are cross-referenced. The index of personal names includes authors, editors, and subjects in a single alphabet. Works with anonymous or corporate authorship are missing from the index and therefore must be found by using the table of contents.\n\nThis bibliography was compiled by Earl M. Rogers, University Archivist 1970-1998, who acknowledged in its several print editions the valuable assistance given by members of the University Libraries’ staff and by many helpful researchers. It has been slightly revised and annotated for online presentation but it remains, and will remain, his work in essence and structure.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nGuidesGeneral\n\nVisitors\n\nLand grant\n\nBranches and early departments\n\nStudent life\n\nCoeducation\n\nMinorities\n\nLiterary societies\n\nStudent publications\n\nFaculty\n\nBoards\n\nAdministration\n\nPresidents and acting presidents\n\nLiberal Arts and Sciences, College of\n\nAerospace Military Studies\n\nAfrican American World Studies\n\nAmerican Studies\n\nAnthropology\n\nArt\n\nGrant Wood\n\nBiology\n\nBotany\n\nChemistry\n\nClassics\n\nCommunication Studies\n\nComputer Science\n\nEnglish\n\nWriting programs\n\nFrench and Italian\n\nGeography\n\nGeology\n\nGerman\n\nHistory\n\nHome Economics\n\nJournalism\n\nMathematics\n\nMilitary Science\n\nMusic\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPhysical Education for Men\n\nPhysical Education for Women\n\nPhysics and Astronomy\n\nPolitical Science\n\nPsychology\n\nReligion\n\nRussian\n\nSocial Work\n\nSociology\n\nSpeech\n\nSpeech Pathology and Audiology\n\nTheatre Arts\n\nZoology\n\nBusiness Administration, College of Dentistry, College of\n\nEducation, College of\n\nEngineering, College of\n\nGraduate College\n\nHomeopathic Medicine\n\nLaw, College of\n\nMedicine, College of\n\nKeokuk schools\n\nNursing, College of\n\nPharmacy, College of\n\nAlumni\n\nAthletics-Men\n\nFootball\n\nAthletics-Women\n\nBuildings and grounds\n\nOld Capitol\n\nOther buildings\n\nConference Center\n\nContinuing Education\n\nFiction\n\nFine Printing\n\nHospitals\n\nIowa Child Welfare Research Station\n\nIowa Lakeside Laboratory\n\nIowa Memorial Union\n\nLectures\n\nLibraries\n\nMuseum of Art\n\nMuseum of Natural History\n\nPhotography\n\nPublications\n\nRadio and television\n\nReligious activity\n\nSummer Session\n\nTraditions\n\nWar, veterans, and wartime research\n\nGUIDES\n\n1.
