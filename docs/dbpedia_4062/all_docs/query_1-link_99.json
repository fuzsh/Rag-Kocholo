Johnson, chairman, presented the following report: \"At the meeting of the committee on February 22, 1983, in Indianapolis during the Hoosier Association of Science Teachers Conference, a major item of discussion was how to involve more high school and middle school students in Academy sponsored programs. This fall, the Junior Academy meeting will again take place on a state-wide teacher study day. In order to get more high school teachers to attend and bring students, the committee will ask that the Academy Meeting be listed as a suggested ISTA teacher education activity. The committee also recom- mended that the Academy President write to public school superintendents and administrators of private schools to inform them of the Junior and Senior Academy meetings. With the goals of encouraging high quality science and, at the same time, attracting more students from more schools to participate in the Junior Academy, plans are underway to modify the meeting format of the Junior Academy. The modification includes a spring meeting, the first of which will be held on April 30, 1983. The spring meeting will include field trips and other hands-on science learning activities. Student participation will not require prior research and scholarly preparation. The Fall meeting will continue to feature presentation of research papers by students. A chance for junior members to hear about senior level research is also planned for the fall meeting. At this time, winners of regional science fairs have been selected, and those students, advisors, and regional fair directors who plan to attend the International Science and Engineering Fair on May 9-14 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, have made reservations with Karl Kaufman. In order to facilitate the fund-raising efforts of regional science fair directors, the Academy is supporting production of a science fair brochure. Lloyd Anderson is doing this work. The plan is to deliver the brochure to regional directors by the fall, so that the directors can distribute brochure copies to potential contributors. Under the leadership of Walter Cory, 47 high school juniors and seniors participated in the Indiana Science Talent Search. Fifteen students were introduced as winners at the awards luncheon on March 12, 1983, at the Student Union of IUPUI. The Academy was represented officially by Alice Bennett and Duvall Jones. Susan Johnson represented the Youth Activities Committee. In other business, the Youth Activities Committee approved a motion that Keith Hunnings, former Director of the Junior Academy, be recognized for his work. The motion was forwarded to the President.\" Chairman Johnson moved that the amount allocated for production of the brochure for science fair directors be increased from $400 to $600. Discussion of the motion brought out that although the Academy does not sponsor science fairs, it does foster them, and this brochure should be helpful. The motion carried. Walter Cory spoke to the value of the Science Talent Search to the students and teachers involved. Winners are automatically members of the Academy for one 24 Indiana Academy of Science year, and several continue their membership. Science fair winners also are eligible to apply for scholarships through an interview process. Junior Academy of Science Leota Skirvin, director, was unable to attend. Her report was presented by Susan Johnson. The trophy for \"Best Overall School\" has been eliminated because it generated unhealthy rivalry. The Spring meeting is to be held April 30 at Brown County High School in Nashville. The theme will be \"Caves\" and it will include an afternoon of spelunking. Susan Johnson will lead a workshop on inspiring students to do research. Several awards will be announced. Library Lois Burton, chairman, was unable to attend. Her report was presented by William Daily. Volume 91 of the Proceedings has not yet been received from the binder. It will be distributed immediately upon being received. The \"Requisition for Printing\" for Volume 92 was prepared for the Editor and submitted March 29 to the Department of Administration. The amount paid from the allotment for 1983-84. Notification has been received from the State Budget Agency that the state funds for printing of the Proceedings for 1983-84 will be $8400, and for 1984-85 will be $8900. Editor Donald R. Winslow, Editor, reported that Vol. 91 of the Proceedings is at the binder. Publications William R. Eberly, acting for Benjamin Moulton, chairman, reported that copies of Ectoparasites of Indiana are available. The next publication will be the History of the Indiana Academy of Science being prepared by William and Fay Daily. Eberly suggested it be printed for free distribution. Climate of Indiana is in progress. Butterflies of Indiana will not be complete for several years. It is to include photographs of all Indiana butterfly species. Relations of Academy to the State Alice S. Bennett reported for Robert Henderson, chairman. President Bennett has written to Lieutenant Governor John M. Mutz welcoming him to membership in the Academy and informing him of the existence of this committee and the hope that it and his office will find ways to work together. Invitations Invitations are needed for meeting sites for 1986 and beyond. Parliamentarian No report. President Bennett spoke of the need for a review of the Constitution and By-laws. See discussion under \"Old and New Business.\" Preservation of Natural Areas Marion T. Jackson, chairman, was unable to attend. His report was presented by Alice Bennett. The committee's two active concerns are: Minutes of the Executive Committee 25 Developing a standardized inventory methodology for natural areas that can be used by a number of field workers across the state. Exploring ways to better utilize the diverse talents of IAS members with natural areas interests to help natural areas professionals (e.g., Division of Nature Preserves, Indiana Natural Heritage Program, and The Nature Conservancy.) Emeritus Membership Robert H. Cooper, chairman, sent a report nominating the following persons for Emeritus membership: Robert M. Brooker 1951-1982 32 years Harold D. Caylor 1931-1982 52 years Margaret Fulford 1929-1982 54 years Keith Hunnings 1954-1982 29 years Willis H. Johnson 1928-1982 55 years Preston McGrain 1940-1981 42 years Frank Streightoff 1954-1981 28 years Election to Emeritus membership was moved, seconded, and carried. Biological Survey Reporting for John A. Bacone, chairman, Theodore J. Crovello said that the committee is planning publication, as a Centennial volume, of a summary of information on biota and the environment. OLD AND NEW BUSINESS Registration Fee for Meetings Duvall A. Jones moved the following Amendment to the Academy By-Laws: Article XII Registration Fee for Meetings Section 1. Registration fees for Spring and Fall meetings of the Academy shall be determined annually by the Executive Committee (at the annual meeting). Section 2. Honorary, Emeritus, and Life members shall be exempt from registration fees. Section 3. Registration fees may be collected by the host institution, but must be transmitted to the Treasurer of the Academy for dis- bursement. Jones explained the need for such a fee due to escalating costs. In response to a question, President Bennett said that even if the host institution did not request reimbursement, the Executive Committee should set a non-zero fee to build up an account for funding meetings. The motion was seconded and carried. Development Fellowship for Secondary-School Science Teachers Ernest Campaigne reported on the current status of this project, which has been fostered by the Research Grants committee. The Fellowship would provide to the teachers $120 per week for 8 to 10 weeks, and to the sponsor up to $300 for materials. One or two teachers will be sponsored this year on a trial basis; then outside help, such as NSF, will be sought. A separate committee, under the chairmanship of Walter Cory, has been named to review applications and to oversee the program. 26 Indiana Academy of Science Operations Manual Duvall Jones distributed without discussion drafts for statements of the duties of Section Chairperson, Program Requirements for Meetings, and Program Chair- person. Publication of Saturday Meeting Presentations President Bennett reported the suggestion of the Academy Council that transcripts of the Saturday morning symposia be published and distributed as a separate publication of the Academy. William Eberly said there was ample precedent for special publications. There was objection from the floor to funding such a project outside the regular budget procedure. Walter Cory suggested that the topics of Saturday meetings are within the purview of the Science and Society Committee, and perhaps that committee would have time and funds to pursue the matter. Constitutional Review Copies of the Constitution of the Academy appear in the Proceedings for 1964 and 1980, but it is not clear that all Amendments voted at intervening meetings are in operation. The matter needs study by a special committee. The President will pursue the matter.

Anthony Blvd., Fort Wayne, on Thursday, October 27, 1983. The meeting was called to order by President Alice S. Bennett at 3:20 p.m. Council members present were Dr. Bennett, Duvall Jones, Theodore Crovello, Donald Winslow, Walter Cory, Douglas Lyng, James Haddock, Benjamin Moulton, and Richard Conklin. President Bennett announced appointment of a new nominating committee: J. Dan Webster, chair; William Eberly, and John Patton. In preparation for a change of officers, the President suggested that all Council members gather information on deadlines for action by the officers. She will ask at the Executive Committee meeting that each committee chair do likewise. The program chairs raised two matters of concern: Slow delivery of bulk mailings is a problem. The laboratory equipment display was cancelled. Since the displayers had agreed to provide some fund for coffee, this raised the question of whether program chairs in the future should solicit funds for coffee and list in the program names of sponsors. At the time of the vote on the constitutional amendment authorizing registration fees, Council will suggest the following fee schedule for the Fall meeting: $5.00 Members, except those specifically exempted $7.00 Non-members $2.00 Students Council will suggest to the committee studying the constitution that additional chairs (e.g., Publications Committee) be added to the membership of the Council. Minor publications, such as pamphlets and list of speakers, should be managed by the Publications Committee. The speakers bureau list has been published by the Director of Public Relations with the understanding that his budget would be reimbursed, perhaps from Science and Society or the President's Fund. New Academy brochures are needed. Cory will prepare a design and circulate it to Council. Cory announced that both winners of Secondary School Teacher Fellowships will be presenting papers at their sections of the meeting. Dr. Robert Fischer of Ball State Department of Psychological Sciences has received positive response from several persons around the state concerning reac- tivation of the Psychology Section. Council granted approval, and it will be taken to the Executive Committee for final approval. There was considerable discussion about a resolution stating the Academy's position on elementary and secondary science education. It was decided that Jones and Bennett would prepare such a resolution to be presented to the membership at the General Meeting. The essence of that resolution would be strong support of public education and possible reorganization of the educational structure in the state. The meeting adjourned to dinner at 5:00 p.m. Respectfully submitted, Richard L. Conklin, Secretary 29 Indiana Academy of Science FALL MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE October 27, 1983 MINUTES President Alice S.

Indiana Academy of Science Budget Committee Meeting December 10, 1983 Minutes The 1983 meeting of the Budget Committee of the Indiana Academy of Science was called to order by President-elect Theodore Crovello at 10:00 a.m. Saturday, December 10, in the Medical Center Union Building, Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis. Present were Alice Bennett, Lois Burton, Richard Conklin, Walter Cory, Theodore Crovello, William Daily, Frank Guthrie, Uve Hanson, Susan Johnson, Duvall Jones, Benjamin Moulton, John Patton, Donald Winslow. Crovello announced four committee appointments and assignments: Alice Ben- nett, will chair the Science and Society Committee. This committee will absorb the functions of the former committee on the relation of the Academy to the State. Frank Guthrie will chair a new ad hoc advisory committee on financial planning. Other members are William Daily, Duvall Jones, and John Ricketts. Walter Cory will chair the membership committee. Philip St. John will act as program chair for both the Spring and Fall meetings. A proposed budget for 1984 was presented by the Treasurer. In a discussion of this budget, the following items were discussed and actions taken: $600 was allotted to Membership for printing a new brochure $100 was added to the Newsletter budget The Centennial Committee allocation of $2,600 is subdivided as follows: Space Rental (Brookville) $ 150.00 Honoraria (Fall Meeting) $1,000.00 Speakers' Travel 950.00 Speakers' Expenses 350.00 Misc. Administrative 150.00 (A one-page letter from the President detailing Centennial plans will accompany dues notices to be mailed in March.) The Allocation to the Youth Activities Committee is $1,650: Brochure for Science Fair Directors $600.00 AAAS Grant Matching Funds: 1983-1984 300.00 1984-1985 300.00 Recognition of pre-college science teachers 450.00 The new Finance Committee is budgeted $450.00 to pay legal, CPA, etc. fees. An increased fee by the CPA formerly employed resulted in a change to Blue, Inc., of Rensselaer. The Junior Academy of Science was allocated $1,000: Awards $300.00 Travel Expenses 600.00 Administrative 100.00 This was moved from Administered accounts to Academy accounts. The spirit of the registration fee recently approved by the Academy is that such money not spent on a given meeting should accumulate. Guthrie suggested that this money should be placed in the reserves to pay fees when needed. Publication of the History of the Academy will be financed from the John S. 39 40 Indiana Academy of Science Wright fund. The History will be distributed free to all members. The price to non-members will be based on publication cost. A request for $27,900 for publication of Butterflies of Indiana (5000 copies) was submitted by the Publications committee. Decision on this was delayed to the Spring meeting of the Executive Committee, at which time the Publications Committee should report its recommendations as to number of copies, distribution, and prices to members and non-members. Similar decisions must be made on the forthcoming Climate of Indiana. Bennett suggested that the announcement of participants in the Speakers' Bureau be allocated $500 and another $2000 be authorized for publication of the proceedings of the Saturday morning symposium at the Fall meeting. No action was taken. A special award for the best research paper in the Proceedings was funded by adding $300 to the budget. The proposed budget was approved unanimously. The Treasurer will prepare copies of the budget as revised in this meeting and circulate them to those who need to see them. The meeting adjourned at 12:35 p.m. Respectfully submitted, Richard L.

Mehall John Ricketts 19 January, 1984 1/24/84 INDIANA JUNIOR ACADEMY OF SCIENCE The Indiana Junior Academy of Science has been more active this year, involving more students and a greater number of schools by virtue of having both a Spring and a Fall meeting. As reported previously, the first Spring meeting was held at Brown County High School in Nashville on April 30. The theme was caves. The 1984 Spring meeting will be hosted by Gavit Jr.-Sr. High School at Hamond. The ecology of the dunes will be the theme. The Junior Academy is proud to announce that Keith Hunning's special desire for the Academy to send a delegate to the American Junior Academy of Science sym- posium has been accomplished. Jim Barsic, with his sponsoring teacher, Dean Christakis, attended the AJAS symposium at Detroit in May. Part of the afternoon program tomorrow will be a slide-illustrated account of Jim's experiences for the four days. An amount of six hundred dollars ($600) was allocated for this activity. The Junior Academy remains within its budget. It is proposed that this activity continue as a special incentive for students and teachers. Some changes in format have been made for the Fall meeting. The Mouse Trap Car and Paper Plane contest have been eliminated so that there is no competing activity going on during the paper presentations. In a mailing, teachers were asked to urge their students to attend the presentations as a learning experience. Due to intense competition developing between two schools, the large trophy for Best Over-all School has been eliminated. This also is a monetary saving. The practice of awarding a year's membership in the AAAS to The Outstanding Junior Scientist-Senior Division has been reactivated. This includes a subscription to Science 83. The subject of a registration fee has been discussed by the Junior Academy Council. In general, the Council is in favor. This will be acted upon after the Senior Academy has made its decision. 46 Necrology Fay Kenoyer Daily, Butler University Eberhard Friedrich Ferdinand Hopf Salzburg, Austria Bloomington, Indiana April 17, 1902 July 24, 1983 A renowned mathematician, Dr. Eberhard Hopf, was a native of Salzburg, Austria. Born April 17, 1902, he spent his first 28 years in Europe. He was educated at a sec- ondary school in Berlin-Friedenau from which he graduated in 1920. A Ph.D. degree was earned from the University of Berlin in 1925 and Habilitation in 1929. He was an instructor there from 1929 to 1930. Dr. Hopf came to America as an International Fellow at the Rockefeller Founda- tion where he taught from 1930 to 1932. Then, he went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1932 to 1936. He was back in Europe as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Leipzig from 1936 to 1944 and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Munich from 1944 to 1948. Dr. Hopf moved to Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, September 1, 1948, serving as Professor of Mathematics until 1962. From 1962 to 1972, he was Research Professor of Mathematics becoming Research Professor Emeritus of Mathematics July 1, 1972. Dr. Hopf was one of the prominent figures in 20th century mathematics. His col- league at Indiana University, William Ziemer, said that \"Many of his mathematical discoveries are now basic principles . . .\". He contributed many articles to mathemat- ical journals and wrote Mathematical Problems of Radiative Equilibrium (Cambridge University Press, 1934) and Ergodentheorie (Berlin, Springer. 1937). Dr. Hopf was not only recognized for his eminent research reputation, but when he was named Research Professor of Mathematics at Indiana University, he was con- gratulated on his contributions \"to a better academic life at the university\". His chief research interests were: differential equations, integral equations, calculus of variations, mathematical astronomy, theory of measure and probability, ergodic theory, celestial mechanics, and turbulent fluid flow. His work brought recognition from the American Mathematical Society in 1981 when he was awarded the Steele Prize \"for a paper . . . proved to be of fundamental or lasting importance in its field, or a model of important research.\" According to an Indiana University News Release (June 2, 1981) the award was actually for three papers. Dr. Hopf contributed a method of solving equations applied to problems of fluid mechanics, solid mechanics and chemical reactor theory. Another paper analyzed turbulence in a viscous fluid in- spiring further work in the field. The third paper analyzed an important equation in fluid dynamics laying the foundation for a method now used to deal with equations describing shocks. Frequently, Dr. Hopf was invited by universities and scientific organizations to give lectures. He visited the University of Heidelburg, Gottingen, Mainz, Tuebingen and Munich in 1954. He lectured at a mathematical conference on ergodic theory in California, 1955. He was Visiting Professor of the Mathematics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin from February to August, 1959. He was invited to take part in international invitational conferences in Varenna, Italy, in 1960. Dr. Hopf joined the Indiana Academy of Science in 1951 and gave a paper that year on A mathematical problem in hydrodynamics. He served as Section Chairman of 47 48 Indiana Academy of Science the Mathematics Section in 1952. In 1953, he gave another paper on Quadratic forms in vector spaces. Other societies to which he belonged were: German Mathematical Society, American Mathematical Society, Saxon Academy of Science, Bavarian Academy of Science, and Sigma Xi. He was co-editor of mathematical monographs and a mathematical journal. Biographic sketches of Dr. Hopf can be found in Who's Who in Indiana (p. 107), Who's Who in the Midwest and American Men and Women of Science (1982), 15th edition. We are grateful to Indiana University for providing much archival material. After suffering a long illness, Dr. Eberhard Hopf died July 24, 1983, in the health center of the Meadowood Retirement Community at Bloomington, Indiana, where he lived. He had achieved a very fruitful, distinguished career during his 81 years of life. Necrology 49 Roderic Malcolm Koch Evansville, Indiana Evansville, Indiana September 29, 1904 November 12, 1981 Mr. Roderic Malcolm Koch was an Evansville manufacturing executive with many facets to his interests. He was born in Evansville, Indiana, September 29, 1904. His early education was obtained from the Centennial Grade School and Central High School of Evansville. He attended the University of Wisconsin from 1922 to 1923, and received an A.B. degree from Evansville College in 1945. He received an honorary degree from Indiana State University-Evansville in 1980 for his many contributions to the cultural life in Evansville. Mr. R.M. Koch was the grandson of George Koch who founded George Koch and Sons, Incorporated, in 1873 in Evansville. Roderic joined the firm as machine shop foreman in 1924 which position he held until 1930. He was then assistant shop superintendent from 1930 to 1934, superintendent from 1934 to 1938, assistant general manager from 1938 to 1941, general manager from 1941 to 1951, vice president from 1951 to 1955, executive vice president from 1955 on. He also was president of the Standard Industrial Products Incorporated, Evansville; Koch Industrial Equipment, Incorporated; McMasters Incorporated Plastic Manufacturers; R. Malcolm and Associates advertising agency. He was vice president of Kaysons Incorporated; Modern Products, Incorporated; on the Board of Directors of Santa Claus Samaritans, Santa Claus, Indiana; treasurer of the Evansville Public Schools from 1943 to 1946; president and director of the Astronomy Section of the Evansville Public Museum, president of the Indiana Foundation for Arts and Sciences, 1966. Mr. Koch was a philanthropist who had an interest and curiosity about many things. He was instrumental in the founding of the Evansville Museum which was built entirely with public donations. The planetarium was named for him, and he championed the cause of science there which was one of the main reasons for the ex- pansion in that area. The first R. Malcolm Koch lecture which was on space explora- tion was given just before his death. He also donated paintings to the museum and was interested in coin collecting. Mr. Koch found time to devote to the Salvation Army by serving on the Board. He received the \"Others Awards\" from them in 1980 for his work with the Army and the museum, the first time a board member had ever received the award. Santa Claus Land, Incorporated, was also a family operated business. According to .his brother, Mr. R.M. Koch was instrumental in establishing Holiday Village at Santa Claus Land and was active in serving on the board. Mr. Koch joined the Indiana Academy of Science in 1949 listing Chemistry and Geology and Geography as his chief interests. He was a member and director of the Evansville Manufacturers and Employers Association, Evansville University Presidents Club and Alumni Association vice president (1966), Evansville Astronomi- cal Society, Conrad Baker Foundation, Deaconess Hospital Foundation, Wessleman Park Nature Center, Indiana State University-Evansville Century Club and a member of the advisory board of the Evansville Foreman's Club. For biographic data see Who's Who in the Midwest. Mildred I. Harmes of George Koch Sons, Incorporated, a former assistant to Mr. Koch, kindly provided an obituary prepared for press release and a reprint from the Evansville Press. Mr. Koch was still working for the air conditioning and industrial equipment com- pany founded by his grandfather when he was stricken at work. He died later at the Deaconess Hospital in Evansville, November 12, 1981. He was highly regarded in his community. In a fine article about him on the front page of the Evansville Press (Nov. 50 Indiana Academy of Science 13, 1981) it was stated \"If Evansville could have but a few dozen more R. Malcolm Kochs, there would be ample reason for optimism about our community's future.\" Necrology 51 Basil Elwood Montgomery Near Cynthiana, Indiana Lafayette, Indiana October 10, 1899 January 19, 1983 Dr. B. E. Montgomery was born in Gibson County along the Posey County line near Cythiana, Indiana, October 10, 1899. He attended the Cythiana grade school and graduated from the Poseyville High School in 1918. His teaching career began in 1918 in a one room schoolhouse where he taught all eight grades. He taught public schools until 1928 during which time he was a teacher of Science, History and Latin. He was also a teacher and principal of schools in Posey (1918-1921); Pennville, Wayne (1922-1924); Monroe, Adams (1925-1926); Owensville, Gibson (1926-1927); and Evansville, Vanderburg (1927-1928) Counties in Indiana. His higher education was interspersed between his winter teaching schedule earning a B.Sc. degree from Oakland City College in 1922. He taught History and Mathematics there from 1920 to 1922. In 1925, he obtained an M.S. degree at Purdue University majoring in Entomology and Education. He was also a teaching assistant in Biology there. He studied Parasitology at Iowa State University (Iowa City) during the summer of 1927, and was a graduate assistant in Entomology and Zoology at Iowa State University (Ames) from 1928 to 1929. In 1929, he came back to Purdue University as an Instructor of Entomology where they needed someone with a knowledge of beekeeping. He was hired because of his long time interest and expertise with bees which began in childhood when he learned beekeeping methods from his father. Related research was one of his chief interests professionally. In 1936, he received a Ph.D. degree from Iowa State University. During World War II between 1939 and 1943, he also taught Mathematics at Pur- due University. Dr. Montgomery was married in 1930 to Esther Barrett and they raised a daughter, Emily. Both Mrs. Montgomery and Emily played an important part in Dr. Montgom- ery's career and he named dragonflies for them. His interest in dragonflies was in- fluenced by Dr. E. B. Williamson, president of the Indiana Academy of Science in 1918, with whom Dr. Montgomery became well acquainted when teaching in Adams County. It was about twelve miles from Monroe, where Dr. Montgomery was teaching, to Bluffton where Dr. Williamson was a banker and lived. Dr. Montgomery spent many nights studying notes and manuscripts loaned by Dr. Williamson. After Dr. Williamson died in 1933, Dr. Montgomery carried on much of Dr. Williamson's work. During the 1900s, scientists were not able to specialize in the subjects taught to any great extent. Consequently, Dr. Montgomery taught a variety including General En- tomology, Aquatic Entomology, History of Entomology, Morphology, Physiology, Entomological Tehcniques, Literature of Entomology, Beekeeping, Biology and Life History of Insects, Economic Entomology, Systematics and Taxonomy. His work became well known internationally and a number of research grants, honors and responsibilities came his way. He was with the Entomology Laboratories of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in New Jersey, Louisiana, Indiana and Ohio during the summers from 1922-1948. He then received Fulbright grants in 1949 and 1950 to specialize in bumblebees and cloverseed production at the Cawthorn Institute, Nelsen, New Zealand. In the sum- mers of 1955 and 1956, he was at Point Barrow, Alaska, as a Research Biologist with the Office of Naval Research, Arctic Institute of North America to study the ecology of bees. 52 Indiana Academy of Science In 1942, a Sigma Xi grant was received by him to study dragonflies at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1960, 1964, 1965 and 1968, National Science Foundation Grants were given to him to study specimens in Euro- pean museums. He received the D.Sc. Honoris Causa from Oakland City College in 1978. In addition to his studies on distribution, seasonality and classification of insects, he studied the relation of climatic factors, chiefly photoperiod and temperature, upon plant production and growth rate of insects. The development of special strains of legumes and bee handling techniques were sought to improve agricultural production. Dr. Montgomery developed a method whereby legumes and other crops may be pollinated by bees in cages in order to study them. He also developed a strain of clover which produces two seeds in a pod instead of one. He studied climatic factors and photoperiod impact upon the biology and life history of dragonflies during 1960 and 1968 under the auspices of Purdue University Experiment Station. He produced more than 100 journal articles. A bibliography of papers is given in a fine biographic sketch of him in 1974 by J.M. Macklin entitled To B. Elwood Montgomery on his 75th birth- day published in Odonatologica (III (4):203-209) from which much information in this report was derived. (Dr. Montgomery, aware that his days were numberd, kindly sup- plied us with a copy. His thoughtfulness was manifest in many things that he did.) Dr. Montgomery owned one of the largest collections of dragonflies. He listed the dragon- flies of North America and compiled a bibliography of all papers written about them. For a while, Dr. Montgomery initiated and edited Selysia, a newsletter on Odonatology. He also edited the Colloquium on Odonata, 1963, which was a report from the first worldwide colloquium on Odonata organized by Dr. Montgomery and held at Purdue University in 1963. He did much to popularize science and gave many public lectures using live bees to illustrate the talks. One year, early in his career, he gave 48 lectures in a four-month period to a wide audience of pre-school students as well as retired people. He wrote Bumblebees and bombiculture for Outdoor Indiana (June, 1961). A short biography of the author accompanied that. Dr. Montgomery became Professor Emeritus in Entomology at Purdue University June 30, 1968. He then taught at Marian College (1969) in Indianapolis and Frostburg State College (1969-1972) in Maryland. One of Dr. Montgomery's hobbies was photography which was used often for il- luminating illustrated lectures. Other biographies of Dr. Montgomery can be found in Who's Who in Indiana (p. 154), and Indiana Scientists by S.S. Visher. His work was often the subject of In- dianapolis newspaper articles. He was the subject of an article in the Indianapolis Star Magazine, November 17, 1957. He also wrote to Walter Cory to share with us some recollections and activities in the Academy. These were published in the Newsletter 36, April, 1982. Dr. Montgomery joined the Indiana Academy of Science in 1922 and was quite active. He was a member just over 60 years. He was elected to Fellow in 1929 over 50 years ago. He served on two committees in 1927-Program and Archeological Survey. From that year forward, he missed very few years in which he was not serving in some capacity. He was on the Biological Survey, Program (twice), Resolutions and Fellows committees and was often chairman and thus on the Exeuctive Committee also. He was Chairman of the History of Science Section in 1955 and of the Entomology Section in 1962 and 1963. He was again Chairman of the History of Science Section in 1969. Dr. Montogmery gave about 45 papers before Academy Sessions. Many of these were in his series on Indiana dragonflies. He related the history, A century of Odonatology in Indiana before the History of Science Section in 1944. Many of his Necrology 53 other papers touched on subjects relating to bees, history of Entomology, etc. Dr. Montgomery addressed the Academy at the spring meeting of 1976 on the Life and times of Thomas Say (Proc. I.A.S. 86: 228-229. 1977. Abstract based on address). It was the National Bicentennial and Sesquicentennial of Science in Indiana and also the sesquicentennial of the year Thomas Say and other scientists came to the Owen com- munity at New Harmony, Indiana. Dr. Montgomery died in Lafayette on January 19, 1983, after a lingering battle with cancer. His career had not only led to important scientific discoveries but also cap- tured the popular fancy. He was an energetic man, kind friend and staunch supporter of the Academy. 54 Indiana Academy of Science Herman George Wilhelm, Jr. Somerset, Pennsylvania Kokomo, Indiana October 18, 1920 August 10, 1982 Somerset, Pennsylvania, was the birthplace of Mr. H. G. Wilhelm, geneticist and microbiologist. He was born October 18, 1920, and was raised in the mountains of western Pennsylvania. He was a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh receiving a B.S. degree in 1941 and an M.S. degree in 1947. His major subjects were genetics, microbiology, anatomy and physiology. He became a lieutenant in the United States Navy and served from 1942 to 1946 during World War II. He was executive officer and navigator for the USS Platte. From 1947 to 1951, he was an Instructor in Biology at the University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio. He was assistant professor at Morris Harvey College from 1951 to 1955 when he returned to the University of Pittsburgh to work on a doctorate in microbiology. Due to a growing family and attendant financial difficulties, he could not complete his degree. He taught at St. Joseph School of Nursing as well as various other schools of nursing in the Pittsburgh area. He also served the Department of Health, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Mr. Wilhelm came to Indiana in 1962 to teach at Franklin College, Franklin, In- diana, where he stayed until 1966. He then moved to the Indiana University campus at Bloomington, Indiana for a year, and then on to Kokomo, Indiana where he taught at Indiana University at Kokomo. Mr. Wilhelm was a very dedicated and effective teacher. In a memorial resolution by Ruth Hanig, Gary Dolph and Steven R. Johnson (kindly provided by Indiana University at Kokomo) some students' quotes were included such as: \"He brought microbiology down to earth\" and \"We really learned microbiology.\" He made a great effort to assist students in the laboratory and present material relevant to special courses of study for nurses and other scientific endeavors that the students might be pursuing. Mr. Wilhelm was especially interested in human genetics and genetic engi- neering. He also was interested in environmental matters. Mr. Wilhelm was a member of the Indiana Academy of Science only a short time joining in 1979 as a senior member. Bacteriology was listed as his major interest. He was also a member of the A.A.A.S. and fraternal groups of Masons, Shrine, and Scottish Rite. He was an adviser for the DeMolay and on the board of directors for the Howard County Red Cross. He is listed in American Men of Science (9th ed.) 1955, Physics and Biology Section. Mr. Herman George Wilhelm, Jr. was very ill in December 1981 developing a col- lapsed lung and spending New Year's Day in an intensive care ward. He recovered enough to return to teaching in March, 1982, carrying a full teaching load during the second summer session with an arranged course in Genetics extra. He was very ill the last few weeks of the session and had just prepared his final grades before he died. He was at home listening to a selection from his large collection of violin music when he died August 10, 1982. The memorial resolution by his colleagues demonstrates the high regard and affection with which he was held by both student and faculty at In- diana University at Kokomo.
