        "text": "13. Your urgent attention is drawn to my letter 9/1/AIR(5a), dated 23.5.41 (Provisional War Establishment of Northern Area - Townsville-\"Establishment HD 49). It would be appreciated if the best available action could be taken on this letter in view of the above. As predicted in the above letter, the two Officers posted enter the category of Plotters rather than Controllers.\"\n\n14. In the meantime, the S.A.S.O. and the S.O. Training, when he arrives, will put the two officers we have through a practical course in the A.C.H. here. It must be appreciated that this will interfere with other important tasks but is unavoidable in the circumstances.\"\n\n15. Whereas the M.M.S. and V.A.I. plot are in full swing here, the control of air operations at the moment must be personally supervised by the A.O.C. and S.A.S.O. If we were committed to full scale air operations tomorrow the present organisation would break down after a few days.\"\n\n16. It is considered that the A.C.H. must be brought up to war establishment as a matter of priority. Until the controllers of the type set out in my letter 9/1/AIR (5a) are able to run the detailed operations, then the main tasks of the Air Staff namely, organising and ensuring the preparedness of operational squadrons for war, will be seriously hampered.\"\n\n22. In conclusion it is pointed out that the whole of the Air Force and Naval personnel are at present crowded on to the top floor of the building and operating under extreme difficulty. The A.C.H. is not completed nor properly manned and therefore can only operate in a most sketchy manner. It would appear that it will not reach full efficiency until one month hence.\"\n\n23. Within one month Northern Area local receiving station will be completed and occupied. W/T and L/T will be in a 24-hour operational basis with all R.A.A.F. base stations under Northern Area command, namely, Darwin, Port Moresby, Townsville and Archerfield. Similarly, it will be linked with Air Board.\"\n\n24. No reasonable estimate can be given as to the opening date of the W/T circuits to the island A.O.B.,s. This is solely dependent upon:-"
