MASS OF CHRISTIAN BURIAL: Wednesday, February 28th at 11am at St. John Vianney Catholic Church, 5801 Oak Hills Drive. Interment, Calvary Cemetery.\n\nTo view live broadcasts of the Vigil Service and Mass, please visit www.heafeyheafey.com and click the “Live Cast” button at the top of the home page.\n\nDiane was born on July 14, 1948 to Edward & Marian Sempek. She was the 6th of 7 children. She grew up in a house full of a lot of people and a lot of love.\n\nDiane grew up in south Omaha and attended Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic school from kindergarten through 8th grade. She grew up alongside Tom Widtfeldt, who she would eventually marry. Diane attended Notre Dame High School. After high school, she married Tom and they had 2 children, Eric & Jill. Diane was a stay-at-home mom until Jill started junior high school. She spent a lot of years working hard to raise good kids and ensuring lots of incredible memories were made for them. Tom & Diane didn’t have a surplus of much of anything, but their kids never knew it. They never went without and they always knew they were loved.\n\nThere are many words to describe Diane: generous, kind, smart, caring, patient and considerate, to name a few. Her smile was pure and her laugh was infectious. She truly was a fun person and to know her was to love her.\n\nDiane was many things: daughter, sister, wife, mom, and friend. Her favorite title, though, was Grammy… and she was the best there ever was. She loved her grandchildren so very much. Before she retired, she put her 40 hours a week in by working 10-hour days, Monday through Thursday. This allowed her to have 3-day weekends and spend that time with her grandkids. She was a constant at baseball games, football games, and dance competitions. She was everyone’s Grammy and she loved it."
