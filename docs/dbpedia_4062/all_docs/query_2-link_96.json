        "text": "3. GULF OF ADEN: Bulk carrier (STELLA MARIS) hijacked 20 Jul 08 at 0430 local\n\ntime/0011 UTC while underway in position 13:16N-050:02E, approximately 87NM northwest of\n\nCaluula, Somalia. The vessel was enroute Suez when UKMTO Dubai was alerted via\n\nINMARSAT that pirates were onboard, repeated three times before the line went dead. No\n\nreturned calls were answered. The ships operators were alerted and at the same time a SSAS\n\nmessage was received by the operators and forwarded to UKMTO. According to Puntland\n\npresidential advisor Bile Mohamoud Qabowsade, there were 38 heavily armed pirates that\n\nstormed the ship while sailing in international waters. Hared Ise Umar, the District\n\nCommissioner of Caluula, stated that the hijackers sailed the vessel close to Caluula and\n\nindicated he expected the vessel to sail to Eyl (Operator, UKMTO, IMB, AFP, LM:\n\nhornafrik.com).\n\n.\n\n4. GULF OF ADEN: Container ship reported aggressive skiffs 18 Jul 08 at 0720 UTC while\n\nsteaming in position 12:47.5N-051:02E, approximately 48NM north of Caluula, Somalia. Two,\n\nsix meter yellow fiberglass crafts with 5-6 heavily armed men chased the vessel. The vessel was\n\ntraveling at 25knts when it was overtaken by pirates on the port side. The master estimated the\n\nspeed of the pirates at approximately 30knts. The vessel took evasive maneuvers, raised the\n\nalarm, and the crew prepared fire hoses. Suspected pirates moved away. No weapons were\n\nreleased and the vessel continued its voyage to Singapore (Operator, UKMTO, IMB).\n\nIn response to pirate attacks, the U.S. has stepped up its patrols to deter them and sometimes intervened to rescue hostages and ships. It also has increased its intelligence-sharing in the area, says Navy Lt. Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the 5th Fleet in Bahrain, which patrols Middle Eastern and African waters.\n\nThe U.S. is \"very concerned about the increasing number of acts of piracy and armed robbery\" off the Somali coast, he says. Somalia's weak government has admitted it can't control its territorial waters, and Nigeria is fending off a rebel group.\n\nA U.N. Security Council resolution, pushed by the U.S. and passed June 2, allows the U.S. and its coalition allies to intervene by \"all necessary means\" for the next six months to stop piracy off the Somali coast. Coalition ships have since scared off pirates in at least two attacks, says the London-based International Maritime Bureau."
