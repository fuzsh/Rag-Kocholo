From the time of Greece when Aristotle wrote about rhetoric and Socrates exchanged views with the sophists, to Cicero’s view of oratory, advice about communication practice embodies a long history. The continuing technological revolution extends the practice of communication beyond its origins in public discourse to mass-mediated forms, demonstrating the continued vitality of the discipline. Communication departments in universities historically contained elements of speech audiology and pathology, theater, advertising, mass communication, film, journalism, public relations, and library sciences. Some departments were affiliated with educational programs due to the need to certify teachers as qualified to teach public speaking, theater, and forensics. However, over the past century, many departments have been restructured or reconfigured with regard to content and methodology— and tension now exists between the study of communication as a practical discipline with a focus on the development of personal and professional skills, and the study of communication as an abstract discipline remains an element of ongoing discussion among communication scholars. Some university communication departments with a large focus on media may teach interviewing, script writing, operation of video recording/editing equipment, as well as writing copy for newspapers, blogs, or advertisements. Understanding technological tools related to web design and layout may also be an important element of this focus. At the same time, in the same department, other scholars may focus on critical, rhetorical, and social science approaches or work to create applications in p ­ ursuit of social justice.\n\nEach area of focus generates the need for the development of appropriate tools of analysis. The result has been a process whereby many divergent and different elements exist within the same department, eventually resulting in the need for separate and more depth of study, which in turn required some elements to separate from the main department. Fifty years ago, for example, departments such as Speech Communication and Theatre (SCaT) combined elements. However, due to the distinct interests and applications, most combined departments have now separated; SCaT, for example, has separated into a Communication department and a Theatre department. Even when separate theater programs exist, some departments may still include oral interpretation of literature or considerations of text performance, resulting in overlap among departments. The development of communication departments and the boundaries of inclusion and exclusion reflect individual institutional development as well as perceptions of the appropriateness of particular disciplinary boundaries. Regardless of the elements and areas of study included in communication departments, the fundamental core tenet involves an examination of how humans exchange messages to manage relationships and obtain information. While the introduction and improvement in technology changes certain practices of communication, the motivations and processes of communicating with other persons still remain much the same.\n\nResearch in Communication Any volume dealing with research in the discipline of communication needs to consider the boundaries of what most communication programs teach and research. Most communication research\n\nxxxv\n\nxxxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\ninvolves efforts to improve the understanding of communication practices in order to provide a basis for improving the content of what is taught in the courses. Research involves the generation of information and understanding of elements of communication to improve practice. Ultimately, the goal of research in communication generates a means of understanding the process of message sending and receiving. The challenge for the communication scholar becomes the selection of a communication situation or artifact combined with an appropriate methodology (a tool or means) to provide a basis for making claims. The scholar’s goal involves employing a tool that permits him or her to make claims based on the observed communication. The following sections consider the general issues of (a) what to study, (b) how to organize thinking about communication, (c) how to study communication, and (d) how to make methodological choices. What to Study?\n\nDefining the boundaries of what a scholar in communication studies often becomes difficult. One position is that a person “cannot not communicate,” which means that all human actions, behaviors, and artifacts provide legitimate grounds for calling that communication. A more restrictive view has communication involving the use of some type of symbol system with intended or ascribed meaning. Such a view, while more restrictive, is very common in the field of communication studies. Several of the entries in this encyclopedia provide a brief overview of the content areas involved in the study of communication. One of the best places to find out about the scope of communication scholarship involves examining the various divisions and interest groups of established communication organizations (National Communication Association, International Communication Association, World Communication Association, Central States Communication Association, Eastern States Communication Association, Southern States Communication Association, Western Communication Association). The range of topics and titles provides a means of evaluating the interests and orientations of the membership. The academy, as well as any discipline, is made up of many different communities that share an interest in some type of content and/or\n\nmethod. Part of establishing a professional identity is the voluntary affiliation with members of the same community. Several of the entries in this encyclopedia describe professional organizations and the structure of the profession. These entries provide an understanding of the options that exist for scholars and often provide a website to permit contact (as does Appendix B: Resource Guide). Professional organizations typically organize conventions and publish journals. How to Organize Thinking About Communication\n\nThe definition of a theory is often a set of statements that organizes relationships among conceptual elements. A theory specifies what elements are important and begins to define the world in terms of what a scholar should pay attention to when understanding the process of communication. A study and theory of communication may be very specific; for example, a scholar may spend his or her entire career studying the effect of violence in television on children. The theoretical tools that address this issue are less likely to explain how a person diagnosed with a disease seeks emotional social support from family members. Both questions represent important issues, but seeking understanding probably represents a fundamental theoretical position that might share little in common. The decision of which methods to employ for any investigation requires an understanding of how to define the situation. A theory, particularly a good theory, articulates which elements are important considerations in representing the situation. Each theory should articulate which elements of the situation (variables) play an important role in understanding the communication process under scrutiny. How to Study Communication\n\nThe entire variety of methods used to study humanity are available to the communication scholar. The range of approaches involves critical, rhetorical, quantitative, and qualitative approaches. Some scholars focus on political and social movements and advocate and require the scholar to become part of social activism. Other scholars operate as traditional scientists and use ­instruments\n\nIntroduction xxxvii\n\nto record physiological changes as well as to track the potential for the contribution of genetic elements to communication practices. At the same time, other scholars use artistic approaches such as performance art. The goal of the scholar is understanding public policy evaluation, social change, or simply an exhibition of critical understanding and representation of culture. The methods represented in this encyclopedia are not exhaustive but instead should be interpreted as indicative. Often a single entry in this encyclopedia about an element of a particular method could be studied or examined as the main topic in a number of textbooks. Many of the entries could be topics for further in-depth study with a variety of resources. The encyclopedia entries are intended to provide a definition and short description of various methods to assist the reader in determining whether or not the tool may be appropriate for use in his or her research. Other entries elaborate on a specific term or concept in order to increase the reader’s understanding of it with regard to communication studies. Often, when considering research methodologies and making a decision regarding data analysis, one needs to understand what kinds of options exist. Thus, part of understanding a method involves understanding what is required to employ the method. Every method establishes the elements that are necessary to collect data (information) when undertaking the technique. For example, a Markov analysis requires that the format of the data involve measurements over multiple time periods. How to Make Methodological Choices\n\nScholars are expected and often required to generate original scholarship, not only to earn a doctoral degree but also ultimately in review for tenure and promotion. Each scholar is required to choose a content area as well as a method of collecting and analyzing data. Entries in this encyclopedia address a variety of methods for collecting and analyzing data. A scholar’s choice of a content area indicates some level of personal preference and interest. For example, suppose a scholar wishes to study communication issues related to how family members communicate with each other. This topic indicates an important area for study with a number of\n\nimportant implications and considerations. But providing a focus of study does not mandate or require the use of any particular methodology. Scholars can examine communication issues related to family using critical, quantitative, qualitative, and rhetorical methods. All the various methods could be employed to generate useful understanding of family communication. The decision of method requires an examination of the nature of the claim or conclusion the scholar wants to provide. A methodology provides a systematic set of approaches designed to guide the scholar in the search for information and the means to evaluate the results of that search. Each method involves a set of procedures and assumptions designed to rigorously test or evaluate the conclusions reached by the scholar. Scientific methods often involve reporting observations and typically generate descriptions of discovery. The scientist seeks to test whether a particular set of descriptions (theoretical statements) maintain accuracy when compared to the observed or empirical world. The tools of quantitative scientists involve statistical procedures that are capable of objective replication. Essentially, if conducted correctly, the results of any investigation would not depend on which scientist conducted the analysis. The process of science emphasizes the role of the process rather than the expertise or knowledge of a particular scientist. More humanistic methods involve the description of creation. Often the scholarly position is described as the development of a perspective. The goal of many scholarly efforts is the development of a theoretical position that generates an understanding of how a message becomes capable of interpretation. Humanistic methods, like rhetoric, do not require or expect that two individuals working with the same artifact necessarily generate the same conclusion.\n\nThe Rationale for This Encyclopedia Communication, as an academic discipline, incorporates a wide-ranging set of content as well as methods. Studying communication involves the examination of a process of human interaction that continues to evolve with technology and ­develop­ment of organizations and groups. Attempts at understanding the process of human interaction\n\nxxxviii Introduction\n\nrequire the inclusion of information about language, culture, history, human sociology, and psychology. The successful line of research provides an interesting set of perspectives on the process of development, maintenance, organizing, and dissolution of personal and organizational relationships. The study of methodology represents a constantly emerging area of definition and application. The methodology, whether critical, rhetorical, qualitative, or quantitative (or some combination), continues to change. While elements, like the calculation of Pearson correlation coefficient, have remained the same for over 100 years, the understanding of that calculation and the implications continue to receive attention. The boundaries of the discipline remain difficult to define, given the ubiquitous nature of communication combined with the overwhelming variety of communication. The continuation of scholarly pursuits in what amounts to a vital area of understanding promises further development of this area. Rather than viewing the chaos and lack of clarity as something generating difficulty, the variability and openness of the system provides opportunity and innovation. Communication scholars study the process of human interaction, something that dates back to Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and Socrates. The arguments made in the rhetoric or with sophists represented the method of rationalism whereby the great philosophers relied on rational argument and experience to draw conclusions. While current scholarship would represent the arguments as rational and incorporate experience, the application of most methodologies requires more than a great thinker simply outlining ideas. Much like communication between persons represents a dynamic process, the academic study and the methods reflect that same dynamic process. This encyclopedia provides some insight and understanding of the possible content and methods of such investigations and a first step to understanding many of those approaches.\n\nOrganizing the Encyclopedia The encyclopedia is arranged alphabetically and includes entries from “Agenda Setting” to “Media Diffusion” to “Z-score.” To guide readers in understanding communication research and communication research methods, the Reader’s Guide organizes entries into five categories—“Creating and\n\nConducting Research”; “Designing the Empirical Inquiry”; “Qualitatively Examining Information”; “Statistically Analyzing Data”; and “Understanding the Scope of Communication Research”—each of which is further organized into more specific subcategories. For example, “Designing the Empirical Inquiry” includes entries arranged in the following subcategories: Content Analysis, Internet Inquiry, Measurement, Research Subjects/Participants, Sampling, and Survey Research. In general, the encyclopedia includes content that addresses the topics or areas of research that interest communication scholars, the methods communication scholars employ, and the professional structure and practice of communication scholars. Each entry provides important information necessary for using and understanding research in communication. Entries in this encyclopedia that discuss topics or areas of communication research provide an overview of what defines that area of research. The entries also describe some of the enduring research questions or theories employed in each area and comment on the nature of methodologies and data collection procedures used. The design of the entries involves an answer to the questions “What does X area study?” and “How do the scholars conduct scholarship in this area?” The first step in scholarship is an important question, “What do you want to know?” Understanding the nature of the claim a scholar wants to make (e.g., empirical, ethical, advisory) provides the basis for the investigation. After one defines the central question of what knowledge or understanding is sought, the next step is methodological. Methodological concerns deal with the acquisition and analysis of information using some structured system to justify a claim. Some scholarly communities seek basic knowledge (see, e.g., the entry “Organizational Communication”), whereas other scholarly communities seek social change (see “Activism and Social Justice”). These entries provide understanding of the various communities that make up the discipline. Understanding what topics scholars in communication studies examine and what theories scholars employ provides a basis for choosing a particular methodology. Scholarly communities establish common means of working toward generating claims. Therefore, several entries in the encyclopedia provide the underlying information\n\nIntroduction\n\nnecessary to ultimately understand how to select a particular method by supplying information about the scope of the communities. The methods usually employed by communications scholars fall into three key areas: (a) rhetorical or critical, (b) qualitative, and (c) quantitative. Each method provides a means of assembling information used to make an evaluation that leads to a claim. Entries in this encyclopedia examine the central issues for each method and the procedures involved in the various programs of assembling and evaluating information using the particular method. Rhetorical or critical approaches to scholarship involve the application of a perspective or theory to the particulars of discourse or artifact. The encyclopedia is organized by articulating entries that examine many of the major approaches to this form of scholarship (e.g., Aristotelian, Burkean, psychotherapeutic, feminist, historical, dramatist). Each approach provides a different perspective on the basis of the communication encounter that structures and provides meaning. These entries provide an examination of the basis of each of the methods or approaches to employing that method. Qualitative scholarship typically employs methods dealing with the application of critical discourse or language-based approaches. The encyclopedia considers each of the various elements or approaches and the necessary elements for its successful application. Often critical methods employ the perspective of a particular identity (e.g., race, ethnic, gender, sexual orientation) as a basis for understanding communication. The use of various language devices (e.g., metaphors, themes) provides a means for analysis. The encyclopedia contains entries that examine the various elements and approaches to qualitative methods. The encyclopedia also includes entries that examine quantitative methods both in terms of design (e.g., survey methods, experimental design, content analysis, and nonexperimental designs) and analytic devices using various statistical procedures (e.g., analysis of variance, causal models, stochastic models). The issues and approaches of sampling techniques also receive attention. The content addressing quantitative approaches provides access to the different standards and options that exist for this form of scholarship. The question of quantitative design assumptions and analysis relating to the internal validity\n\nxxxix\n\nof design, the generalization or external validity of analysis, as well as the understanding of reliability of measurement (scale or interrater reliability) each receives separate attention. The encyclopedia intends to define most of the terms used and applied in the understanding of quantitative research. Many of the terms involve technical and precise definition and application in communication scholarship, so the entries in this encyclopedia provide a means to demonstrate the techniques as applied by communication scholars. In addition, the encyclopedia provides content to inform understanding about the structure of the academic profession involving communication as well as the process of communication scholarship. Like most academic communities, the scholars in the communication discipline belong to professional organizations that support the research, teaching, and service efforts of faculty. Thus, several entries in this encyclopedia describe various professional organizations, including their scope and the publications they support, with the intention of providing a means of identifying likely sources of support for scholars. Because the practice of scholarship involves the process of creating an idea, vision, or question to guide the process of knowledge generation and distribution, a set of entries in the encyclopedia talks about the process of submitting papers to conventions, articles to journals, and book-length manuscripts to publishers. The process of writing, editing, and reviewing forms the backbone of the review process, so this encyclopedia provides a series of entries devoted to understanding how academic papers are written and eventually chosen for publication and presentation at a convention.\n\nAcknowledgments The encyclopedia represents the largest single project I have undertaken in my career.

Thus, an abstract works as a point of entry for many readers, whereby they can evaluate whether the main document is useful for their purposes. When submitting a document for publication, the abstract is usually placed at the beginning of the document, followed by a set of keywords. However, writing an abstract after completing the document is recommended for a thorough and accurate abstract. Along with the abstract, keywords need to be selected carefully as they will assist readers in finding the document via online searches. Including key information about the main document in a precise manner in the abstract is important to help readers decide whether to read or use the document. Standard components of an abstract include (1) the research focus and a problem statement, (2) method, (3) major findings or results of the study, and (4) conclusion. Each section usually contains one or two sentences. Because of the limitations on the length of an abstract, each sentence should include maximized information, using optimum wordings and expressions. In terms of the tense of an abstract, an abstract is usually written in past and present tense. In general, the method and results sections are written in past tense, whereas the conclusion section is written in present tense. In addition, writing an abstract using active voice tends to make the abstract powerful and dynamic to convey the contents. Thus, a good abstract is one that provides accurate information in a concise manner to readers. Next, this entry explains each part of an abstract in detail.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAn abstract is a brief summary of a document, such as a journal article. An executive summary is a summary of a longer document. At times, an executive summary and an abstract are used interchangeably; however, there exists differences between the two. This entry describes the standard elements of an abstract and discusses how an executive summary and abstract differ.\n\nAbstract In academia, an abstract is usually required when submitting journal articles, conference papers, book proposals, as well as when applying for research grants. The length of an abstract varies depending on the publication, but 100–250 words are standard for journals in the communication field. An abstract is not an excerpt from the main text but an original document that is self-sufficient without referring to the main text. Thus, copying from the main text is considered unacceptable, as readers will notice it once they read the main document. At the same time, including key phrases and terms that readers might look for is necessary so that the readers can easily find the article in online searches. An abstract is not an evaluation of the main text either. Rather, it is a condensed version of the main text that includes main points. The role of an abstract has become more important with the popularity of online searching, because often only the abstract is accessible to 1\n\n2 Academic Journal Structure\n\nResearch Focus and Problem Statement\n\nFirst and foremost, explaining the purpose and scope of the research is crucial in the abstract. When explaining the purpose, providing a bit of background helps readers realize the value of the document. If the document is a replication or part of a larger research project, it is important to clearly provide the information by citing the previous research and the larger research project. In addition, the approach and the theoretical framework used are important for some readers to see how the research was preceded. Research Method\n\nFor method, clarifying the data size, characteristics, and/or demographic information of the participants is important. In addition, the types of analyses and sometimes the types of tools the researchers used are important information for certain readers to decide whether they should read the main document.\n\nand an abstract. First, the purpose is different. An executive summary is commonly used in business contexts to provide a shorter version of a longer report or document for business executives who may be too busy to read the entire document, whereas an abstract is used to invite readers to use or read the main text. Second, unlike with an abstract describing research, technical terms are often not used in an executive summary because the readers may be non-experts in the field. Third, the length of an executive summary is much longer than that of an abstract. A typical executive summary is about 5–10% of the length of the main document, but usually does not exceed 10 pages. Thus, using subheadings is advised to increase readability. In general, communication journals and conference papers require authors to include an abstract, not an executive summary.

If there are several findings, one or two major findings can be highlighted. A good abstract provides readers with accurate information without using ambiguous words or phrases. If the investigation used a quantitative research method, including numerative information, such as effect size, significant level, and confidence intervals, along with the method used, is important. Conclusion\n\nWhat is the author’s conclusion based on the results? Similar to the conclusion section in the main text, the author cannot speculate or conclude something that the data did not prove. Providing accurate and precise interpretation of the data is important. In addition, the impact and implications of the research can be included in this section.\n\nExecutive Summary An executive summary is used more frequently in business contexts than in academia; thus, there are several differences between an executive summary\n\nFurther Readings American Psychological Association.

More simply, it refers to what types of research one is likely to find in particular journals. This topic is relevant not only to the student but also to the scholar seeking to publish his or her original research. In this entry, most of the principal journals in communication studies are characterized as a guide for the reader beginning with the most general publications and moving to the most specialized ones. The intent of most people who enter the profession of college or university professor is to teach. However, it does not take long for the newly minted professor to learn that progress toward higher ranks in the profession and the award of tenure depends not only on teaching ability but also on service to the college or university and the profession and, preeminently, published research. Most academic institutions have specific expec­ tations for how much published research a professor should have in particular periods and some sense of the quality of the academic journals in which they appear. These journals are similar to popular, commercial magazines, except that they are usually published by professional academic organizations and contain the texts of research articles. They also typically appear only a few times per year rather than weekly or monthly. The field of communication studies has changed dramatically since the early 1960s. At that time, there were many fewer journals in this field but also many fewer publishing scholars. Expectations were also lower, with some institutions not looking for any publication at all from their professors. Today, there are multiple publication outlets, many more practitioners, and heightened expec­ tations. Where the National Communication Association (NCA) then had only three journal publications, today it has 11. The International Communication Association (ICA) publishes five journals, and each of the four regional communication associations publishes at least one. Some subareas of communication studies, such as rhetoric and religious communication, have formed their own professional organizations and publish such journals as the Rhetoric Society Quarterly and the Journal of Communication and Religion. There are now also numerous international communication journals, such as the European Journal of Communication and the Chinese Journal of Communication. Several journals that are not\n\nstrictly communication oriented, such as the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships and Personal Relationships, nonetheless publish a large number of studies involving communication. It would appear that any scholar seeking to publish research findings today would have a relatively easy time in doing so. This is not the case, however, since the competition for publication has become more fierce. During James Donald Ragsdale’s 3-year tenure as editor of the Southern Communication Journal (volumes 77–79), submissions came in at the rate of 10 or so a month, while acceptances were about 20% of that. Acceptance for publication depends not only on the quality of the manuscript but also on the journal’s level of financial support. Publication is gratis, although in some fields, especially scientific ones such as crop science, scholars may be asked to pay for the cost of publication when a journal issue exceeds its normal page limitations. In the field of communication studies, as in other academic areas, the focus of some journals is general. The standard is the quality of research, not the subject matter or the research methodology. The ICA’s Journal of Communication is a leading example. It also publishes book reviews, which are not so often found in other journals in communication studies. The Southern Communication Journal is also a general publication that carries book reviews. Communication Quarterly, one of three journals published by the Eastern Communication Association (ECA), the Western Journal of Communication, and Communication Studies, the latter being the journal of the Central States Communication Association, are general journals. Many other journals, however, focus on specific subject areas, research methodologies, or both. Communication Monographs, for example, primarily publishes longer or monograph-length studies in the area of communication theory that utilize quantitative methodologies. ICA publishes a similar journal called Human Communication Research. NCA’s Quarterly Journal of Speech emphasizes studies in rhetorical theory and public address. The Rhetoric Society of America offers the Rhetoric Society Quarterly, and devotees of literary theorist Kenneth Burke, through the Kenneth Burke Society, produce the Kenneth Burke Journal.\n\n4 Academic Journals\n\nReturning to NCA journals, Communication Education publishes studies of instructional methodologies and techniques, and Communication Teacher features pieces on K–12 as well as college classroom activities, assessment, and original teaching methods. Other specialized publications of NCA include the online-only Review of Communication, which features cross-disciplinary studies of subareas of communication, the Journal of International and Intercultural Communication, Critical Studies in Media Communication, and the Journal of Applied Communication Research. Comparable journals published by ICA are Communication, Culture, and Critique and the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication. Outside of the publications of the international, national, and regional professional organizations in communication studies, several other organizations are responsible for journals frequently consulted by communication studies scholars. Among these are the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships and Personal Relationships, which contain research, normally empirical, relevant to the large subarea of interpersonal communication. The Journal of Family Communication publishes research on communication within families regardless of whether the methodology is quantitative or qualitative. Finally, there are a few quite specialized journals, which offer the scholar rather unique sources of information or outlets for publication. There is, for example, the Review of Communication Research. This publication is devoted entirely to pieces that are reviews of literature in areas of communication studies. The Western States Communication Association offers Communication Reports, which carries short data or text-based studies. Similarly, the ECA offers Communication Research Reports with brief empirical articles of 10 or fewer typewritten pages. The latter two publications provide outlets for research that are not yet sufficiently well developed for a longer monograph-length manuscript. ECA also publishes an annual called Qualitative Research Reports in Communication. The number and variety of journals in communication studies offer the scholar ample outlets for the publication of his or her research.

Articles appearing in such journals are typically peerreviewed by other scholars before appearing in print, so they often enjoy greater legitimacy compared to self-published manuscripts or books. Journals are usually ranked on the basis of impact factor, which measures the number of times their articles are cited in recent years. Many university departments and schools of communication thus base their hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions on candidates’ records publishing in peer-reviewed journals. This entry explains the various types of communication journals and then addresses several issues of concern.\n\nTypes of Communication Journals The major professional associations of the field (e.g., National Communication Association, or NCA; International Communication Association, or ICA) have partnered with publishers to produce a suite of communication journals, on topics such as applied communication, critical cultural studies, media and political communication, and rhetoric.\n\nAcademic Journals 5\n\nWhile NCA and ICA journals are usually ranked highly by rating agencies like Thomson Reuters (previously known as the Institute for Scientific Information, or ISI) according to impact factor (led by NCA’s Communication Monographs and ICA’s Journal of Communication), some journals produced by regional communication associations (e.g., Central States Communication Association), individual divisions of NCA or ICA, or even the ones unaffiliated with a specific association remain highly respected venues for scholarly work. In line with the ubiquity of communicative processes in general, and the history of communication studies as a field with interdisciplinary roots, communication scholars also publish in interdisciplinary, special topic-driven journals that enjoy high impact factor and researcher credibility (e.g., New Media & Society, Public Relations Review). Since the late 1990s, two important trends have surfaced. First, as journal publications gradually become expected for doctoral students even before they graduate, several journals catering exclusively or largely to graduate student research have emerged (e.g., Kaleidoscope). Many of these student-centered journals adopt the open-access online format, and are backed by credible editorial boards from well-known universities. Second, broader consumer shifts toward online rather than print formats means not only that some venerable journals plan on transitioning eventually online (most notably, ICA; its Journal of ComputerMediated Communication is already an onlineonly publication), but also that several new journals are purely online (e.g., International Journal of Communication). While there has been much consternation in academe in general about the validity and rigor of online academic journals, many of these ventures in communication studies are backed by well-known scholars and institutions, although some of them may lack impact factor ratings. Moreover, online journals typically feature more progressive copyright policies, permitting authors to reuse or distribute their work in broader forums, compared to traditional print journals.\n\nContemporary Issues Published research in academic journals often sets the benchmark for top-notch scholarship in communication—as with other scholarly fields—and\n\nhelps organize a knowledge-sharing network for scholars. This network helps categorize not just key theoretical concepts and methods but also the academics who draw from these concepts and use these methods. This might constitute a source of friction, however, given that most highly ranked journals publish functionalist and quantitative research, compared to interpretive, rhetorical, critical, and feminist perspectives. For instance, critics have averred that high-ranking journals’ standards of scientific rigor and “quality research” are often used to dismiss work emphasizing humanistic and emotive/evocative elements (e.g., studies using autoethnography, or critical discourse analysis using smaller samples). To counter these perceptions, and help encourage “nontraditional” scholarship, several new journals have been instituted (e.g., NCA’s Journal of International & Intercultural Communication, ICA’s Communication, Culture, and Critique). Editors of established journals frequently reiterate the need to publish “alternative” research, and also issue calls for special issues on niche topics to address some of these disparities. While such measures have been received favorably, ensuring adequate representation for scholars and scholarship remains an abid"
