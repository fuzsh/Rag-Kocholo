        "text": "Lifeline Reopening, SES Week 2020, COVID-19 Update and Soccer Grand Finals\n\nLocal Government Association of Queensland Conference\n\nCr Marbelli and I recently attended the Local Government Association of Queensland’s Annual General Meeting and Conference.\n\nThe agenda focused mainly on the challenges our communities face confronted with the public health and economic difficulties brought on by COVID-19 and a glimpse of the directions we may need to take in a post COVID world.\n\nThe annual conference also enables all 77 local Councils throughout Queensland to debate and establish a united position on changes required to legislation, policy or funding requirements to enable a united petition to the higher tiers of government. This year a total of 75 motions were debated dealing with matters as diverse as Local Government’s role in National decision making to Waste Management.\n\nTraffic Signal Upgrade\n\nThe Department of Transport and Main Roads will shortly undertake works to traffic signal infrastructure at the intersection of McIlwraith Street and the Bruce Highway, Ingham to improve road user safety at that location.\n\nWhen completed, right turn movements from the Bruce Highway into McIlwraith Street, in both directions of travel, will only be possible when the green turn arrow is displayed. There is currently no green arrow provision.\n\nWorks will be undertaken at night to minimise any inconvenience to road users.\n\nSES Week 2020 Regional Awards Ceremony\n\nThe SES 2020 Regional Awards were held at the Ingham Showgrounds on Saturday 17 October 2020 as part of the SES Week celebrations running between 17 and 25 October 2020.\n\nAwards were presented to the following Local Hinchinbrook volunteers for recognition of service:\n\nColin Noble – Hinchinbrook SES – 10 years MSM medal;\n\nRobert Morris – Hinchinbrook SES – 20 years MSM medal Second Clasp; and\n\nEdward Danieli - Hinchinbrook SES – 15 years MSM medal and National medal.\n\nCongratulations to our local volunteers who were officially recognised for their outstanding services to the SES. Your contribution and efforts to the welfare of our community in times of need is invaluable and much appreciated.\n\nEric Feldt\n\nMany of you may recall Dr Betty Lee launching her book ‘Right Man, Right Place, Worst Time’ at the Hinchinbrook Shire Library in October 2019. The book is about Ingham born Commander Eric Feldt who was the instigator and head of the Coastwatchers during World War Two.\n\nDr Lee has now informed that the Australian War Memorial has recently completed a publication titled Patriotism – stories from the home front of the Second World War and that this book includes a section on Commander Feldt. To view the booklet, please visit www.awm.gov.au/sites/default/files/Patriotism.pdf.\n\nLifeline Reopening at New Location\n\nBack in business! Monday 26 October 2020 saw the official reopening of the Ingham Lifeline store at its brand new premises at 79 Herbert Street Ingham.\n\nCongratulations to Lifeline on its move to a much roomier and more customer focused premises.\n\nIt is great to see the team set up and ready to go after such a long closure, especially during this time of COVID-19. The demand on Lifeline’s 24 hour crisis support hotline has seen an unprecedented increase, of 20-30 percent during the pandemic.\n\nFunds raised locally stay within the Northern Region to support the needs of locals, which means that your support and donations to Lifeline strengthens their ability to provide support to those in need.\n\nDrop in and visit the team.\n\nState Elections Reminder\n\nA reminder that the State Elections will be held this Saturday 31 October 2020, commencing at 8.00am until 6.00pm.\n\nEarly voting is available at the TYTO Precinct, 73 McIlwraith Street Ingham. The opening hours this week are:\n\nWednesday 28 October 2020 9.00am to 6.00pm;\n\nThursday 29 October 2020 9.00am to 9.00pm; and\n\nFriday 30 October 2020 9.00am to 6.00pm.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nJust a reminder that restrictions on some activities resulting from COVID-19 continue to apply and that we must remain alert to the threat the disease poses.\n\nThe restrictions include gatherings of no more than 40 in your homes. We must continue to practice the measures that have kept us in good stead to date and they include maintaining physical distancing of 1.5 metres, good and regular hand washing practices; stay at home when sick and seek early testing if you display any COVID-19 symptoms. It is also recommended to wear a mask in circumstances where social distancing is not possible.\n\nSoccer Grand Final\n\nCongratulations to the Ingham FC Reserve Grade Womens Team on fighting through to the Grand Final to be held at 1300Smiles Active Park Townsville on Friday 30 October 2020 kicking off at 8.30pm.\n\nYou have done us proud. Support the team and get down to 1300Smiles Active Park to cheer them on!\n\nNeed to print the Council Connections page? Click on the link below for the printable version."
