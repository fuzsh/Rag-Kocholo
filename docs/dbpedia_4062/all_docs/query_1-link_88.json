        "text": "Studies on learner demotivation has attracted the attention of second language (L2) researchers and scholars worldwide in recent years. In this paper, L2 demotivation is defined as external and internal influences which can lead to the diminishing motivation to study the target language. This paper further identifies and discusses significant influences in the form of teacher-and learner-related factors that affect learner demotivation. For teacher-related influences, inappropriate teaching styles and attitudes, poor teaching quality as well as teacher demotivation have been cited by several studies as key factors of learner demotivation. Learner demotivation can also be affected by learner-related influences arising mainly from intrinsic issues such as low self-esteem or poor self-worth. Suggestions for pedagogical implications include the enhancement of teachers' professional development, the use of 5Ts (Teacher, Teaching Methodology, Text, Task and Test), as well as imparting students' coping strategies for self-regulation. Finally, we suggest that future studies on demotivation could explore less commonly applied theories and research methods and expand demotivation research to include older L2 learners.\n\nAbsract: This study initially attempts to discuss motivation and demotivation in the field of second language acquisition and additionally to explore the main factors causing demotivation in learning English among university students of vocational school. Demotivation, an understudied area in SLA is a relatively new issue for researchers. In this respect, this study attempts to explore the main factors causing demotivation in learning English among vocational school students. In the search of the reasons of demotivation, a 35-item questionnaire, which was developed by Sakai and Kikuchi (2009a), was filled by 60 university students. Descriptive statistics were employed in order to identify the most and the least demotivating factors grouped into 6 main categories such as (a) Class Characteristics (b) Class Environment (c)\n\nRecent research in second language acquisition has seen a surge in interest concerning the phenomenon of students' demotivation. Using a literature review, this paper explores the concept of L2 demotivation as the combined effects of internal and external factors that diminish a learner's drive to engage with the target language. It delves into the significant influences contributing to L2 demotivation, focusing on both teachers and students' variables. Teachers' variables encompass inappropriate teaching styles, attitudes, and low teaching quality, alongside instances of teachers' demotivation, all identified as pivotal contributors to students' demotivation by numerous studies. Additionally, students' demotivation can stem from intrinsic issues such as low self-esteem or diminished self-worth. The paper concludes by suggesting pedagogical implications, such as the need for teacher training programs that emphasize motivational strategies and fostering positive attitudes towards language learning. Furthermore, it advocates for the development of learner-centered approaches that address individual learner needs and provide opportunities for autonomy and selfexpression in the language learning process, learning goals setting, task design, providing constructive feedback, inclusive classroom, cultural awareness, and leveraging technology in language learning. Lastly, the paper calls for further research into demotivation in second language learning to inform more effective pedagogical practices and interventions.\n\nMotivation plays a significant role in the rate and success of second and foreign language learning in general, and in classroom language learning in particular. This paper overviews research on motivation as a promoting determinant in second and foreign language classroom and deals with the meaning of motivation, theories of motivation and explains how teachers can generate and maintain motivation in second language classroom. Research on motivation for second language learning has shown that teachers should be aware of their actions and behaviours in classroom because it is very likely that teachers' actions can demotivate learners."
