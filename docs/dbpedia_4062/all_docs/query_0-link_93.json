When Vi was four years of age, she moved with her parents to Mora, Minn. Returning to Austin in 1928, she graduated from Austin High School and Normal Training. She taught school in Oakland, Minn. until her marriage to George Waterman on June 28, 1934. When her daughters were grown, she returned to teaching at Rural School District No. 93 near Waltham.

Also, for many years, Vi was active in the Comforcare Auxiliary serving on the Family Council and the Official Board. She was a Friendship Bible Coffee Guide through Christian Womens Club. Whether it was for family or friends, she was a good listener and faithful prayer warrior to lift their needs to the Lord.\n\nVi had a ministry of taking food to people when there was sickness or death in a family. When her children were young, they remember Vi giving food to their friends who were underprivileged or to bums who would come to her back door from the railroad tracks. No one was ever turned away.\n\nVi is survived by her three daughters, Viola Mae Moyer of Albert Lea, Minn., Joann (Wayne) Brimner of Saskatoon, SK, Canada, Beverly (Larry) Lau of Forestburg, Texas; eight grandchildren; 16 great-grandchildren; seven great-great-grandchildren; many nieces, nephews and friends.\n\nViola is preceded in death by her husband George; parents Roy and Mae Wood; son-in-law Dalis; grandson Bradley; sisters and brothers-in-law, Dorothy and Merlyn Franck, Lucille and Ted Kilgore, Ruth Klouse; brothers and sisters-in-law, Kenneth and Vivian Wood, Willard and Louise Wood, Richard and Violet Wood.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 1:30 p.m. on Friday, March 30 at Crane Community Chapel with Pastor Dale Christiansen officiating.

Holmes\n\nA sadness was cast over our city Sunday when word went abroad that Warren C. Holmes had been stricken with paralysis. The gloom deepened today when the sad tidings of his death which occurred at 11:30 a.m. was announced.\n\nIt will be some time before we shall fully realize that this genial spirit, this progressive business man, this true friend of old and young, rich and poor, has left us. It is safe to say that not a man, woman or child who has ever come within the radius of his genial spirit, but was cheered and made happier. Here was a man who took fortune's buffet and reward with equal cheer -- rejoicing when things were coming his way and bidding them be gone with an all conquering smile when they treated him despitefully. His humor was infectious, breaking over and gleaming through the mock seriousness of his face.\n\nHe will be missed among our businessmen where he took a high place for progressive work and an upright character. He will be missed by hosts of friends who trusted and enjoyed his friendship. He will be missed by the children whose friend he ever was.\n\nWarren C. Holmes was born in North Hero Island, Vermont, October 21, 1854, which made him not quite fifty years of age at the time of his death. When a small boy he removed with his parents to St. Lawrence County, New York State and later to Minnesota, settling in Lansing where most of his boyhood was spent. He learned telegraphy and became an operator at Weaver, Minnesota and later at Gary, S. Dakota. At the latter place he also invested in a sheep ranch which he exchanged later for a stock of hardware in Sioux Falls. This he removed to Austin nine years ago last fall, opening a hardware store opposite the Court House. He carried the business but one year alone, going in with Thomas Revord of the firm of Revord & Johnson. They were located at the corner of Bridge and Main Street until they removed to their present location.\n\nHe was married at Weaver, Minnesota to Miss Emma Hopkins in 1873. One son, Roy, was born to them, who survives his father and resides at Austin.\n\nMr. Holmes, though of rugged appearance, was never very strong even as a boy. A year ago last June while enjoying an outing at lake Osakis he was stricken with bright's disease and since that time has suffered a great deal. While able to attend to business occasionally, most of his time since then has been given over to the recovery of his health. He was taken to Chicago where he underwent a critical operation. He returned somewhat improved and had encouragement that he might recover. For several weeks he's been at his country home east of Austin, trying to gain strength and rest. A number of days last week he was able to be at the store and even as late as Saturday assured his friends that he was feeling unusually well. Saturday evening his sight troubled him which was doubtless caused by hemorrhage of the brain, or of that part of the brain controlling the vision.\n\nEarly Sunday morning he was stricken with paralysis and remained in an unconscious condition until the time of his death at noon today.\n\nMr. Holmes leaves besides his wife and son, two brothers, Dr. Bayard, of Chicago and Watson M. of Hoosic Falls, New York, and three step sisters, among them Mrs. F. A. Ticknor of this city.\n\n[ Austin Herald, Mon. 8-01-1904, page 2, col. 2 ]\n\nHolmes, Warren C.\n\nHOLMES.\n\nAt his summer cottage at Holmes Spring Farm, just east of this city, Monday noon, August 1, 1904, of paralysis. Warren C. Holmes, aged 49 years. He has been in failing health since June of last year from the effects of Bright's disease, but of late has seemed better. He was in the store Saturday and was apparently feeling cheerful. Sunday morning in attempting to get up he was stricken with paralysis and was unconscious until death.\n\nWarren C. Holmes was the son of Hector A. and Olive A. (Williamson) Holmes and was born at North Hero, Grand Isle County, Vermont, October 21, 1854. His great-grandfather, Thomas Holmes, came from England in 1776. Early in 1861 he went with his folks to Lawrenceville, New York, where they lived on a farm until June 1865, when they moved to Lansing village in this county. Here Warren lived several years and learned telegraphy under Lew Foote. He was stationed at Weaver, near Winona, as operator and later was at Owatonna a short time when he moved to Gary, South Dakota, and was there over 16 years, mostly in charge of the Northwestern station there. He has also a big sheep ranch near Gary, which he exchanged for a stock of hardware in Sioux Falls. About ten years ago he moved this stock to Austin and opened a store. Subsequently he bought out Chris Johnson's interest in the hardware business of Revord & Holmes. Here he has since resided and retained his business interests.\n\nHe was married on October 30, 1873, to Miss Emma C. Hopkins of Weaver, Minnesota. The widow and one son, Royal Stuart, now of Austin, survive. Two brothers also are living, Dr. Bayard Taylor Holmes of Chicago and Watson M. Holmes of Hoosic Falls, N.Y. The father died October 22, 1902.\n\nDeceased was one of the prominent business men of Austin. In his personal relations he was genial and kindhearted, considerate of the needs and feelings of others, and was trusted and esteemed by all who knew him. He took a great interest in the advancement of this city and showed his public interest in many ways. In the home, in Austin social circles and in the business realm he will be greatly missed.\n\nIt seems to us as if he had just reached the height of his usefulness and opportunity for enjoyment of life when he was called to go. How true it is with all that no one knoweth the day or the hour of departure.\n\nFuneral services will be held at the residence, St. Paul street and Oakland avenue, Thursday afternoon at 2:00 o'clock. Interment at Oakwood.\n\n[ Mower County Transcript, Wed., 8-03-1904, page 2. ]\n\n©2012 MNGenWeb\n\nRoy F. Maas\n\n17 APR 1947 -- 18 APR 1969\n\nLYLE SOLDIER KILLED\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) Roy F. Maas of Lyle, Minnesota has been killed in Vietnam action, the Defense Department said Tuesday.\n\nHe was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Paul F. Maas.\n\n[Winona Daily News. April 23, 1969]\n\nBelieves Brother Died\n\nFor Worthy Viet Cause\n\nCEDAR FALLS - To the Editor: I'm writing this in memory of my fallen brother (SP-5 Roy Francis Maas of Lyle, Minn.). I had another brother who was sent over and came back to us. And now I and all of Roy's relatives and friends mourn the loss of him.\n\nWhen my first brother (SP-4 Lyle Peter Maas, now of Ft. Hood, Tex.) came back I asked Lyle if he honestly believed we, the U. S. A., should be over there helping the South Vietnamese. He told me yes. because if we don't help, the Viet Cong would move in and just murder anyone and everyone that didn't go along with them. Also, it's better to fight over there than to be fighting in our own country as that's where it would come, in time. Then we will have trouble as we would have the war damage to look at.\n\nMy brother loved his country and gave his life for its freedom. If some of these draft dodgers would love their country as they say they do, they would help fight for their country's freedom in hope that they won't lose their life, too. I would hate to find out that my brother and all the young men have died for nothing.\n\nRoy wrote to one of his classmates on the 11th of April (he was killed on the 18th). In the letter he said that he had been made tank commander (his commander was killed earlier). He also said that he was up for a silver star. We don't know if he received it as the casket was marked non-viewable. He didn't tell my folks all of the danger he was in as he didn't want to worry them.\n\nI'm very proud of my brother even if he didn't win a silver star. The escort the Army sent with the body thinks he may be sent to Vietnam for his second time. He is married and has a boy in Kansas. If he is sent I hope for his safe return and a safe return for everyone else who is there fighting for freedom.\n\nMRS.
