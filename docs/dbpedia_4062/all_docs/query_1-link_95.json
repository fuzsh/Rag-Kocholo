This shift was accompanied by dramatic changes in nearly all aspects of society and the economy.\n\nFactories came into being capable of producing goods on a mass scale. Trade flourished, a money economy developed and a city-dwelling, educated, increasingly self-aware upper class emerged.\n\n12:54 am pdt\n\nGerman Chancellor is Polish- Poland is pleased\n\nIt was revealed this week that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's grandfather came from Poland and that her original maiden name was Kazmierczak, not the Germanized Kasner.

Some of the most iconic movie stars of all time, Louise Brooks, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Asta Nielsen, once padded around the studios in Weissensee, Woltorsdorf and Babelsberg.\n\nHere is where Walter Ruttmann directed \"Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis\" - based on Dziga Vertov's theory of \"Kino-Pravda\" (\"film truth\") that reality can best be represented through cinematic \"artificialities.\" In semi-documentary style, the silent film with a musical score portrays the life of a city....\n\n7:39 pm pdt\n\nBerlin challenges its 'anti' vibe\n\nForeign arrivals to the dynamic German capital may not always find themselves welcomed with open arms.

Weekend detritus, overloaded prams and sometimes cranky motorists are all a part of the mix. But on one morning recently, while bathed in self-congratulatory thoughts for biking in the winter, I passed a piece of graffiti that caught my eye - but not for the right reasons.\n\nOn the wall of a popular bar and café, someone had scrawled an arrow pointing up to a bay window with \"insert grenade\" written in shaky letters underneath. While it's not necessarily a good idea to read too much into graffiti, it seems that the message being left was, \"new arrivals, you're not welcome.\"\n\n7:38 pm pdt\n\nMonday, March 11, 2013\n\nInterior minister: We need populism\n\nFacing election this year, German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich seems to have gone off-piste over immigration, warning that populist measures are necessary to avoid the threat of fascism, comments Hannah Cleaver.Germany will veto Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen passport-free zone if the two countries push their membership at an EU meeting this week, Friedrich warned on Sunday.\n\n\"The expansion of the Schengen zone is only accepted by our citizens if the basic requirements are ensured. That is currently not the case,\" he said, matter-of-factly.\n\nBut some may have heard faint echoes of 1960s British racist Enoch Powell when Friedrich last week said, \"We are the country which has until now been able to keep far-right parties out of the national parliament. But that will only remain the case if we continue to take the worries of the people seriously, and the problems are solved.\"...\n\n12:01 pm pdt\n\nHitler and the Nazi regime continue to fascinate the public\n\nA novel about Hitler coming back from the dead in modern Berlin is a runaway German bestseller. But opinion is split as to whether the latest comic take on the Führer is politically acceptable - or even vaguely funny.\n\nHowever people may feel about the book itself, the cover of Timur Vermes' \"Er ist wieder da\" (\"He's Back\") is a real eye-catcher: a dark, abstract side-parted hairdo with an abbreviated moustache printed on a plain white background. There's no mistaking the book's subject matter.\n\nThe first-person narrator is the Führer himself, and the story begins with Hitler waking up at the site of his former air-raid shelter in Berlin. The year is 2011, and in a democratic Germany, the former master race is more obsessed with technological gadgets and mass entertainment than with world domination or annihilating undesirables....\n\n11:59 am pdt\n\nVoting in Weimar & National Socialist Germany\n\nNote: This article requires critical thought when reading... The NSDAP won 41% of the Vote in elections where there were over 15 Paries on the Ballot, this is truly remarkable. This article attempts to diminish this major accomplishment.\n\nIn March 1933, Germans voted for a new parliament - their last free election before all but the Nazi party was banned. Such extraordinary measures of terror preceded the election that there was little \"free\" about it.\n\nIn February 1933, Germany found itself in the midst of a parliamentary election campaign. By the time voters went to the ballots one month later, on March 5, 1933, one single issue was on their minds.\n\nThe burning of the Reichstag, home to the parliament, was alleged to have been carried out by communists in an attempted coup. Chancellor Adolf Hitler and other National Socialist leaders latched on to the \"coup attempt\" in order to stoke fears of a communist revolution amongst the German populace. Thereafter, Hitler and his allies unleashed an unprecedented wave of terror throughout the country.\n\nState of emergency\n\nSince the burning of the Reichstag on February 27, 1933, Germany was officially in a state of emergency. Heavily armed security forces patrolled public buildings. In trains, police officers regularly strode by, searching for \"suspicious\" persons. On the streets, \"brown shirt\" officers of the Sturmabteilung (SA), the paramilitary wing of the Nazi party, were on the lookout for any opponents of National Socialism....\n\n11:57 am pdt\n\nHungary passes constitutional changes\n\nHungary’s ruling conservative party has pushed through controversial changes to the constitution, despite warnings from the EU. Opponents say the changes will greatly limit the powers of the constitutional court.\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling right-wing Fidesz party, which has a two-thirds majority in parliament, approved a controversial amendment Monday afternoon.\n\nCritics say the vote, known as the \"fourth amendment,\" will limit the power of the constitutional court and increase government controls over the judiciary and higher education.\n\nOpponents claim the changes are part of a campaign by Orban's conservative party to undercut government opposition.\n\nHours before the vote, the European Commission warned Hungary to live up to democratic norms after President Jose Manuel Barroso spoke directly with Orban last week....\n\n11:54 am pdt\n\nGerman party says 'no' to the euro, 'yes' to the EU\n\nOpponents of the euro in Germany have founded a new party in favor of abolishing Europe's common currency. But critics question whether the rather academic group can pack the populist punch it needs to enter parliament.\n\n\"The Alternative for Germany\" - Germany's new party opposing the eurozone - is unlikely to impress Angela Merkel. The German chancellor takes pride in her policy aimed at saving Europe's monetary union. \"The end of the euro would also be the end of the European Union,\" she has said - justification in her view for why the monetary union must be sustained....\n\n11:52 am pdt\n\nHungary says YES to Nationalism-NO to EU\n\nHungarian President János Áder arrived in Berlin on Monday for what might look merely like a standard bilateral meeting between two EU leaders. But the relationship between the European Union and Hungary is anything but normal these days. Budapest, after all, bid farewell on Monday to many of the values that define the 27-member club.\n\nPrime Minster Viktor Orbán, like Áder a member of the conservative Fidesz party, has expanded his power dramatically. While the head of state was in Berlin, the prime minister moved ahead with a highly controversial package of amendments to the country's constitution. The amendments weaken the country's constitutional court, the last defender of Hungary's constitutional state, and they limit the independence of the entire judiciary branch. ...\n\n11:50 am pdt\n\nLuftwafe pilot SAVED American Bomber and Crew\n\n........Stigler was standing near his fighter on a German airbase when he heard a bomber's engine.

He climbed behind the sputtering bomber, squinted into his gun sight and placed his hand on the trigger. He was about to fire when he hesitated. Stigler was baffled. No one in the bomber fired at him.\n\nHe looked closer at the tail gunner. He was still, his white fleece collar soaked with blood. Stigler craned his neck to examine the rest of the bomber.

The true religion of the left is Cultural Marxism. The Mayor, on her own, without support and consensus from the other four City Councilmember and in opposition from a vast majority of the Porterville Community declared June as \"Gay Pride\" Month in the City of Porterville. Hundreds of Christian Porterville citizens crowded City Hall and opposed and move taken in the name of their City and condemned the Mayor.\n\nSee the public reaction in a video clip here:\n\nhttp://www.recorderonline.com/articles/mayor-57267-proclamation-read.html\n\nCoincidentally this was also done in the City of Visalia and both the Visalia and Porterville Proclamations were written by a small, vocal militant homosexual minority committed to reversing thousands of years of Western Christian Civilization. This small militant homosexual organization is reinforced from out of town support such as San Francisco and other large \"Big City Homosexual Ghettos\" where the Queer Rainbow Flag takes precedence over The American and State Flags.\n\nHomosexuals have become a State within a State, bent on the destruction of traditional America and traditional Western Christian values. Homosexuals even go so far as to often invoke \"Queer Nation\".\n\nThe most troubling aspect of the \"Gay Agenda\" has been its rapid rise to \"Protected Class Status\" and it being afforded unfounded and unjustified legal protection on equal footing to minorities such as \"African-Americans\", \"Native Americans\", \"Asian-Americans\", et al. How did a new Class develop based solely on deviate sexual activity and most importantly why has this been allowed to happen and what new Class will develop next based on deviate sexual activity? Homosexuals always attempt to fuse their \"Gay Agenda\" with other causes or issues or historical events. Homosexuals have attempted to compare their \"plight\" to the \"American Negro Civil Rights Movement\", which has been strongly rebuffed by the Black Community who voted strongly in favor of Proposition 8 in 2008. Homosexuals have also attempted to invoke the \"Holocaust\", which has also resulted in rejection by some Orthodox and Conservative Jewish Rabbis, even though Homosexuals were interned in Concentration Camps, the Homosexual cause has been supported by many liberal and Marxist Jews. Mayor Gurrola's \"Gay Pride Proclamation\" was another example of fraudulently fusing the \"Gay Agenda\" with another issue. Mayor Gurrola's \"Gay Pride\" Proclamation was cloaked with a lot of \"anti-bully\" language; anti-bullying has been widely discussed in the media lately, locally, and nationally. It was a poor attempt at \"bait and switch\" The Mayor started out reading what many thought sounded like a \"anti-bully\" effort in local high schools, but then at the end, as the Homosexuals and the Gay Agenda always does, the switch came, the Mayor declared the month of June \"Gay Pride Month\". Thus the entire \"Proclamation\" was an intellectually dishonest as is the entire \"Gay Agenda\". The Homosexual's success in convincing nearly half of the public that they are a \"Class\" is the result of two primary elements, heavy handed political pressure by liberals and Cultural Marxists AND Madison Avenue marketing designed to tug on the heart strings while the violin plays that soft music in hops that the public ignores logic, reason, morality, and thousands of years of Western Christian Values and Social Norms.\n\nThe fundamental aspect of the Homosexual argument that they are entitled to special Class Status akin to other groups who are afforded such status based on Race is based solely on the Homosexual sexual act. The American Psychiatric Association classified \"Homosexuality\" as a mental disorder until 1973; the American Psychology Association classified it as a Mental Disorder until 1975. Interestingly, the World Health Organization classified Homosexuality as a Mental Disorder until 1990. All of these Organizations DE-classified Homosexuality as a Mental Health Disorder on the basis of political pressure and NOT based on scientific studies which all the piers of their respective Organizations accepted.\n\nWhat we have today with regard to the argument of Homosexuals being a special class is a matter of social politics imposed on society and at horrific consequences. In all cases, the Psychiatric and Psychology Associations and the World Health Organization cited \"stigma\" as one of their primary concerns when declassifying homosexuality as a mental illness. This is both scientifically and morally bankrupt as today our society still debates the \"stigma\" of mental illness, yet we have NOT declassified schizophrenia or other mental illness based on \"stigma\". It was only the great liberal tidal wave coming out of the late 1960's and with it new liberal Psychiatrists and Psychologists who entered the respective Associations and the World Health Organization coupled with political pressure from politicians who threatened to cut off various funding sources and Madison Ave. marketing that resulted in \"homosexuality\" being declassified as a mental illness and patients becoming a protected Class. In reality the patients now run the institutions.\n\nToday, Homosexuals, like many others with mental disorders demand special accommodations. The world spends trillions on AIDS, based on homosexuals demanding the world accommodate their unhealthy and unnatural sexual acts. Today, sexually confused individuals, men and women alike demand to the use of the opposite sex restrooms then cry foul when parents take action to protect their children from what they suspect are sexual deviants and predators. Today, Homosexuals have strong ties with child sex (pedophilia) advocacy Organizations such as NMBLA - National Man-Boy Love Association. Few if any so called LGBT Organizations denounce NMBLA because these same LGBT Organizations are cross pollinated with NMBLA and view pedophilia as just another \"sexual orientation\". In fact some in the LGBT Community have called these pedophiles an \"unprotected Class or Orientation\". The LGBT Community are often the strongest organized opposition to Child Protection Laws such as Mag en's Law and other anti-Pedophile Laws designed to keep sex offenders away from Schools, Parks and other locations where our child gather. The LGBT Political Action Committee long supported the Speaker of the New York Assembly who blocked the enactment of Megan's Law in New York State. The \"LGBT Community\" is often the most vocal supporters in advocating for lower age of consent laws, i.e. more liberal laws for child to engage in sex with adults, one such proposal was proposed to lower the age to 14. The LGBT Community has been at the forefront to prevent families from seeking counseling for their own children who may be struggling during the trying pre-teen and teenage years. LGBT activists often engage in custodial interference, using cult-like tactics and sexual liberation enticements, during these trying times and divide parents and children and destroy families. Homosexuals have gone so far as to attack devout Christians with vexatious and frivolous law suits, one such suit was so frivolous and was based on two militant homosexuals demanding a devout Christian provide them baked goods, the two homosexuals refused the age old business tradition of business owners having the \"right to refuse service to anyone\". The Homosexuals have been at the forefront of the modern war on the Church, Catholic, Protestant, and Mormon. Interestingly, only Islam has remained firm in its theology that its liturgy is not an \"evolving document\" and will not accommodate moral perversion. Piers Morgan recently echoed the homosexual view point when he said \"the Bible should be revised\", Morgan, like homosexuals demand men should amend God's Word and Laws to accommodate moral perversion and mental illness. All other faiths have begun to crack under the heavy handed political pressure or based on political terms such as \"tolerance\" or good intentions, which the road to hell is paved with, and reach out for some sort of dialog with or accommodation with Homosexuals. Of course it has been the militant \"Gay Agenda\" that has been at the forefront to destroy the institution of Marriage. Homosexuals did not just begin this effort in recent times; militant homosexuals began their assault on marriage in the mid 1960's. It was homosexual liberals and feminist lesbians who first advanced the concept of \"no-fault divorce\", from that point on the institution of marriage began its steady decline to its in excess of 50% rate we see today.\n\nHomosexuals and the \"Gay Agenda\" have proved that they do not want dialog or accommodation; they want absolute domination of their agenda triumphant and the demise of Western Christian Civilization. There can be no accommodation with that which seeks to destroy Christian Values.\n\nHomosexuals have been successful through artificial means. Their status as a Class is was obtained through artificial and Orwellian means. When they lose at the ballot box they seek solace in the court of a homosexual Judge or via mid night legislative actions out of reach of the electorate. When you strip away the fraud, the reality is Homosexuality is a cousin to more dangerous sexual based mental illnesses such as pedophilia, bestiality, necrophilia, et al. The next logical progression, based on the granting of special class protections to Homosexuals is that these other sexual based mental illnesses be granted the same class designation and rights as homosexuals. Don't laugh; in Europe today, there is a legal effort underway to grant people the right to marry their pets, yes, marriages between humans and dogs, cats and other animal species. The logic that is being applied in the European Courts by these \"Animal Lovers\" is the same that homosexuals used, first in Europe, where they achieved special Class Status first before they achieved it in the United States. Homosexuals maintain their special and artificial and fraudulently obtained Special Class Status by way enormous political pressure. They have a lot of leftist benefactors on the left in Congress. They also maintain it by using \"Hate speech and intellectually dishonest labels, i.e. they call anyone who opposes their mental illness a \"hater\" or a \"homophobe\", incidentally, Mayor Gurrola could NOT even pronounce the Orwellian term \"homophobia\" during the reading of her \"Gay Pride\" Proclamation which was written by the local extremist Homosexual group.\n\nWhen Homosexuals are faced with public health statistics that clearly demonstrate as a result of their mental illness that they are 8 times more promiscuous and have 10 times more sex partners than normal heterosexuals, they cover their ears and all but shout \"don't confuse me with the facts\", denial is a classic symptom of mental illness. Homosexuals refuse to acknowledge the public health ramifications of their sex acts; Homosexuals fought the closing of Gay Bath Houses during the early AIDS epidemic, thus placing their sexual gratification over judgment, another clear sign of mental illness. Homosexuals demands that all social norms and institutions be changed and or modified to accommodation the single act they say justify them as a \"Class\", their abnormal sex act is itself a red flag for mental illness. Would we as a society be so quick to change the Social Contract and accommodate a similar demand made by a serial killer, because he/she engages in consistent conduct consistently and began at an early age, thus he is a \"Class\" and thus the action is not deviant or anti-social? The homosexual says it is not about sex, but if not, then what? They counter it is about \"love\", if that is the case then why do they \"love\" so many? Compulsive disorders are another sign of mental illness.\n\nThe time has come for our Society to cease accepting the Big Lie that has been imposed by Orwellian and political pressure that says homosexuals are a Class of people. We need to push back and defend our Christian values. We need to demand that homosexuals be viewed as what they truly are mentally ill persons who need help and we need to cease enabling the mentally ill in destroying themselves and the rest of OUR Society.\n\nFinally, we need to stand firm that any public official who acts contrary to our values MUST be removed from office. Virginia Gurrola must be removed from office as does any official who does not support her removal.\n\nIMMIGRATION- LOS ANGELES, A CASE STUDY\n\nCongress continues to push for continued \"immigration reform\", translation, the legalization of 8 to 12 million illegal aliens, yes, illegal aliens. This at the expense of immigrants who followed the rules and have been waiting years to immigrate legally, like some many have throughout our history.\n\nEvery day we are festooned with \"happy talk\" and calls for \"compassion\", yet no regard for the realities of immigration ever makes its way into mainstream media, shall we give it a try, taking Los Angeles as a test case:\n\nAccording to a compilation of data from none other than the liberal Los Angeles Times:\n\n40% of all workers in Los Angeles County are working for cash and not paying taxes, because they are predominantly illegal aliens working without a green card.\n\n95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.\n\n75% of people on the most-wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.\n\nOver 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.\n\nUpwards of 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals here illegally.\n\nWell over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.\n\nThe FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.\n\nNearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.\n\n21 radio stations in Los Angeles are Spanish speaking.\n\nIn Los Angeles County 5.1 million people speak English, 3.9 million speak Spanish out of a population of just over 10 million.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, public policy is based on inverted logic and is geared in favor of the \"illegal alien\" as some sort of victim rather than a law breaker.\n\nLess than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 30% are on some form of public assistance.\n\nOver 70% of the United States' annual population growth (and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York ) results from immigration.\n\n29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.\n\nThe time has come for a return to the Immigration Policies pre-1965 before we lose what is left of the First World United States, both culturally and economically. There is NO fundamental right to U.S. Citizenship, which has become meaningless as new \"immigrants\" take the U.S. benefits but maintain their foreign identity.\n\nDavid \"Piers\" Irving\n\nFebruary 15, 2013\n\nDAVID IRVING NO LONGER DESERVES OUR SUPPORT\n\nBy: Rodney Martin, Editor/Director\n\nWorld View Foundations\n\nWVFOUNDATIONS.ORG\n\nIrving intensifies his anti-Second Amendment statements\n\nDefends the serial Pedophile Jimmy Seville's \"reputation\"\n\nDavid Irving has done some excellent research and authored some excellent books, IN THE PAST; the world would not know the true travesty of Dresden, if it were not for David Irving. Irving's early work based on original sources gave us our first clear picture inside Adolf Hitler's inter-circle. However, recently, Mr. Irving has come to a fork in the road and taken the wrong path.\n\nMr. Irving comes to the United States, where he enjoys the full benefits of our First Amendment, something he cannot do in his home Country, the U.K, in order to earn a decent living selling his books and giving lectures, lectures he cannot give in many other Nations that have barred his entry. Mr. Irving is presently staying in Florida while writing a new biography of Heinrich Himmler which may well stipulate to some portion of the traditional holocaust narrative.\n\nIn one of his recent prior \"Radicals Diary\" entries, his online Journal, he joined fellow British Agent Provocateur in denouncing our Second Amendment. Irving went so far as to infer that single women that own firearms for self-protections are \"sluts\". Irving's piggish position on women is not all that shocking given his infatuation for his young assistants and his posting of their photos in provocative attire and poses on his web site in the spirit of Victoria's Secret advertisements, thus appealing to the lessor impulses.\n\nI previously wrote about these issues regarding Irving in my commentary, \"Can we give David Irving a Pass while we Detest Piers Morgan\". Irving's strong statements against our Second Amendment, at a time when out fundamental Rights are under attract by Obama and his Judeo-Marxists by a man like Irving whose primary support in the USA now come from Pro Second Amendment proponents and White Nationalists is truly shocking, if not an outright betrayal. Irving has also sold his books at none other than Gun Shows, yet he denies this in his new Radicals Diary entry, this calls Irving's character into further question given that many have provided first-hand accounts of purchasing books from Irving at Gun Shows.\n\nIrving's recent anti Second Amendment statements were NOT a momentary lapse in judgment. In fact, Irving has today, posted a new version of his \"Radicals Diary\", posted on his web site today http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/index.html. In this new version Irving reacts to negative feedback to his prior comments. It is clear that David Irving is as anti-Second Amendment as Piers Morgan and Barrack Obama. David Irving makes vicious statements and insults toward those who own firearms and takes the \"internationalist\" viewpoint that Americans should disarm based on the negative views other Nations have of the United States, which is an anti-Nationalist position. This is alarming. Irving's complete statements regarding the Second Amendment form his current \"Radicals Diary\" is posted below.\n\nAdditionally and just as shocking, Irving, in the same edition of his \"Radicals Diary\" defends the repulsive serial pedophile Jimmy Seville. Irving struggles in his current Radical's Diary to stand up for serial pedophile Seville's reputation. This is actually more disgusting than Irving's hypocrisy, his attack on our Second Amendment, while cashing in on our First Amendment and his insulting of supporters of the Second Amendment a \"mindless haters\", \"gun worshipers\", etc. Irving has been willing to take the money of OUR people; we now see how he really feels about US as he suns himself in his comfortable Florida surroundings.\n\nDavid Irving NO longer deserves our support. We should no longer buy his books, send him donations nor attend his lectures. Leave him to the likes of Piers Morgan, Jimmy Seville and other like-minded people who we now know he sympathizes with.\n\nFrom David Irving's Radicals Diary-Posted February 15, 2013\n\nNote, Irving has NOT changed his Date Stamp from 2012 to 2013 on his Radicals Diary, thus his current entries are listed as 2012.\n\nhttp://www.fpp.co.uk/docs/Irving/RadDi/2013/150213.html\n\nSaturday, January 19, 2012\n\nEton, UK.\n\nMORE hatemail over guns and my OpEd about it in the last Radicals Diary.\n\nI reply to one: \"If only you could see the way the whole world now looks at the United States! It ain't pretty. I have said my piece about your country's stupid gun-worship. History will say the same, I expect.\"\n\nAnother anonymous American ladels out more mindless hate:\n\nAmerica is the only English speaking country you are allowed to visit due to our First Amendment. The First Amendment is held up because of the Second Amendment. You are attacking the very basis of the freedom you enjoy when you visit us. Using your daughter's death, who was not killed by firearms in the first place, as a prop, is disgusting. Now the Vatican joined the Jews, Piers Morgan and David Irving in attempting to undermine our Constitution. Stay out of America.\n\nThere is a certain sameness about these writers. \"Stay out of America\". How does he know how Josephine died, God rest her soul?\n\n4:51 p.m I reply to one:\n\nPlease, please look at yourselves through the eyes of the outside world. Sand Hook was a disgusting scandal, and would never have happened if that crazy woman and her son had had no guns. Six guns including machine guns. What on earth did she need them for? I am not going to be intimidated into thinking differently. We do not have the sickness; the gun-worshippers in the United States do.\n\nAnother gun-worshipper hurls hate at me:\n\nLooks like the anti-gun comments have done you in. Maybe you should apologize to the American people for supporting the gun grabbers. The pro-gun people who believe in freedom of speech and the right to bear arms were your main supporters. Remember those Gun Shows you used to attend? I know because I know them and they will not give you a thin dime again without a apology.\n\nFeel free to return to your third-world-overrun UK hellhole which is ten years ahead of the USA. We can fight while the gunless White Britain's [sic] will be murdered in the street by their Jew ridden \"Diversity\" government and criminals. Great future for you over their [sic] when they enslave your children and ban your books.\n\nA quick check shows he has never contributed. He spends his money on guns and bullets, not Real History.\n\nAt 9:07 p.m I send him my now standard reply:\n\nIf only you could see the way the whole world now looks at the United States! It ain't pretty. I have said my piece about your country's stupid gun-worship. History will say the same, I expect.\n\nI have zero sympathy, and nothing in common with, people who find phoney \"Second Amendment\" excuses for the mad woman who \"legally\" kept six hand-guns and machine guns which killed twenty innocent infants in Connecticut.\n\nIrving sympathizes with the serial pedophile Jimmy Seville........\n\nThursday, January 10, 2012\n\nTHE BBC News programmes are dripping with self-flagellation over the Jimmy Saville case. It makes me rather uneasy, in a probably unpopular way. I do not and did not ever like Saville: he seemed over-rich, overweening, over-oozy with his programmes. He died four years ago, and much adulation surrounded this needlessly famous entertainer (and his desire to be buried at an angle, so that he could cast his gaze out across the North Sea).\n\nThen it began to come out that he was the subject of allegations of paedophilia, which the BBC had for various reasons covered up. I have no reason to believe he was not guilty of the general allegations; but I am concerned about the posthumous hounding, this easy, cheap and undangerous witch hunt, as allegation is mounted upon allegation, piled high, as the sensation and publicity-seeking \"victims\" now come forward to point their podgy fingers.\n\nIn my eyes the victim now is Saville himself, dead, his reputation not just tarnished, but ruined, with no chance of repair. This is not the British way of justice, or if it now is, it should not be. By all means, pursue, hound and disgrace the BBC and its nasty producers for tolerating this insufferable man, paying him a fortune, and their climate of corruption and concealment. But de mortuis nil nisi bonum: speak no ill of the dead, and somebody must belatedly stand up for that principle.\n\nCAN WE GIVE DAVID IRVING A PASS BUT DETEST PIERS MORGAN?\n\nRodney Martin, World View Foundations\n\nBritish CNN Talking Head Piers Morgan has made quite the name for himself of late telling Americans that they \"embarrass their Nation\" and calling for BOTH the U.S. Constitution to be revised in favor of gun control and for the revision of the Bible in favor of \"Gay Rights\".\n\nWhile Morgan has been vilified, David Irving has also endorsed Gun Control. Irving wrote the following on his online \"Radical's Diary\",\n\nDavid Irving, \"Radical's Diary\":\n\n\"THERE HAS been a horrible shooting incident in Newtown, Connecticut, a peaceful New England community. Adam Lanza, 20, took some of his mother's five handguns and automatic rifles, shot her dead, and then went to the Sandy Point school where she taught and shot dead twenty children aged 5 to 8 and their head teacher and the school psychiatrist (sic) in an hour-long rampage from nine-thirty yesterday morning.\n\nHe was a disturbed, i.e. schizophrenic, child, as we learn during the day. In the evening I see President Obama manfully holding back tears, of the evidently real kind that one looks for in vain in mothers on TV news programmes begging \"the killer of their child\" to come forward (when they have done it themselves).\n\nIn fact Obama is as guilty as every predecessor and leading politician in this country, who has failed to address the gun control issue. Even now they are still tiptoeing around the central problem: gun proliferation.\n\nIn any occupied country, guns were the first things the occupiers took real control of, thereby halting all killings (other than their own). Eisenhower issued Order No.1 in 1945 making gun possession in occupied Germany a capital offence. In Britain after the Dunblane massacre handguns were outlawed overnight.\n\nThe mighty USA (with its great ally in the Middle East), which still kills other nations' children by the tens of thousand in the most wanton manner, now using unmanned drones as well, is powerless to control a situation where a single sluttish mum feels at home owning five guns of her own: meanwhile, the multi-millions of the mighty Gun Lobby wash around the gunwales of the Capitol building in Washington DC. Guns don't kill people, in this case: the lobbyists, single mums, and their wretched mindless children do.\n\nIt will take a really tough president, oblivious to the yelping of the gun industry, to get a handle on this one. Not in my lifetime, probably. Outlawing all the corrupt cash lobbies in Washington would be a good start. Until then, hecatombs of children and their olders and stupiders will have to die\"\n\nI for one intend to hold Irving to the same standard as I hold Morgan, a British Elitist snob, who comes to America to take advantage of our 1st Amendment, while calling for an end of our 2nd Amendment, while he often tucks himself away in safe surroundings at night with the company of much younger female company. Irving inferring single women who own firearms for protection are \"sluts\" is truly ironic given his obsession for his \"Assistants\".\n\nA hypocrite is a hypocrite whether it is a Morgan or an Irving, BOTH deserve the vilification and boycott of White Nationalists.\n\nGUNS ARE NOT THE ISSUE LIBERAL EGALITARIAN POLICIES ARE WHAT WAS REALLY CAUSED THE NEWTOWN AND OTHER GUN TRAGEDIES\n\nStop the deflection guns and address the real issue\n\nBy Rodney Martin\n\nPerhaps by the time you read this, Barack Obama will have issued the Executive Order, his Vice President says is permissible, which will formally restrict all law abiding American's 2nd Amendments Rights. We all know the words enshrined in the 2nd Amendment and we have, by now heard every Liberal-Marxist shrill exploit the tragedy at Newtown, as they argue that the 2nd Amendment is \"only\" for hunting\" and no one needs an AR-15, AK-47 or any other \"mean\" looking weapon or any magazine which holds more than, say five rounds. Of course we know they are wrong, the Founders enshrined the 2nd Amendment to ensure that that the people are the ultimate check and balance on a Government that becomes tyrannical and ignores the Constitution and its people, something that has long ago happened in the United States. Of course Marxist-Liberals really do know the real reason for the 2nd Amendment and their desire to \"salami slice the people's rights into oblivion\", a term first coined by Lenin, is so they can ultimately enact all of their objectives, most of which they dare not speak openly of, until AFTER they take care of that problematic 2nd Amendment.\n\nThe fact is NO political Party or figure should use deaths or any tragedy to push a political Agenda, either pro or con, yet that is what is happening rather than addressing the real human issue of Mental Health.\n\nThe great failure of today's publicity seeking \"Gun Rights Advocates\" is their wiliness to fall into the debate traps of the likes of \"King Piers Morgan\", a Brit who is willing to tell us how to be an American, \"Pistol Packing Momma Diane Feinstein\", who seeks to disarm us, while keeping her gun in her purse, \"Sideshow Joe Biden\" a prime candidate for a strait-jacket, and \" Commissar Barak Hussein Obama\" who is on a mission to remake America into a Marxist Third World Nation.\n\nThus far, all of the \"Gun Rights Advocates\" who have appeared in the media have allowed the tragedy of Newtown to focus the debate solely on inamment objects- \"guns\", i.e. the debate that is currently ongoing is what guns and what clips will be restricted and why do we need these \"mean looking semi-automatic weapons. Not a single \"Gun Rights Advocate\" has given the proper reply to \"Sir Piers\" or any other Liberal-Marxist, the simple answer is, \"because the Constitution says I can have one\".\n\nThe real debate should be on the failure of Liberal egalitarian policies that led directly to Newtown. Liberals never admit nor allow a discussion to occur that may lead to their having to admit that their policies are wrong, and in the case of Newtown, liberal policies have proven to be dead wrong.\n\nThe tragedy of Newtown is NOT a result of guns, but rather a result of the failure to properly enforce existing gun laws and to properly address mental health issues in the United States. Specifically, for years, especially since 1964, Liberals have banged the egalitarian drum and enacted polices to \"mainstream\" everyone, including criminals, sex offenders, the criminally insane. A prime example of this is the liberals' success in changing the term \"illegal alien' to \"undocumented worker\" thus transforming a criminal into a victim requiring immediate government intervention. The man who murdered the children at Newtown was criminally insane. Liberal egalitarian Policies and Judges today have legislated people like him and even sex offenders as essentially victims. Liberal policies and Judges have struck down past laws that provided for involuntary commitment and provided families and empowered families with far more tools to institutionalize mentally ill family members before they became a danger to themselves and others. After all, don't families see the danger signs first? But Liberals have waged a war on families since the early 1960's with a dogma that families are to be replaced with the State, as is the case in Cuba, North Korea and other Utopias that have proven to be so successful.\n\nIn 1957, there were 500,000 involuntary commitments in the United States, mass shootings were unheard of. Family members, who are the first to recognize the signs when loved ones need help, were able to sign sworn statements and work with their medical/Psychiatric professionals and thus prevent what we have seen at Newtown, Ct, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Co and Tucson, AZ. Individuals could not be released unless Psychiatric Professionals cleared them; in most cases it required more than one. However, in the mid 1960's Marxist- Liberals began chipping away at this system and by the early 1980's, with the help of Marxist-Liberal Judges, had established their \"new\" system whereby Families became all but powerless and irrelevant to the committal process and a Mentally Ill person could simply talk their way through an Interview Process with a State Social Worker, NOT a Psychiatric Professional, who need not consult with family and in most cases may last 2 to 3 minutes or a Judicial Hearing where their \"rights\" took precedence over the Public's Safety and ultimately other people's Right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\n\nIn an even greater example of public policy madness that exacerbates this problem Marxist-Liberals have gone out of their way to legalize drugs, via the \"salami-slicer\" method, first under guise of \"medicinal use\" of gate way drugs, then more recently attempts at all out legalization. No regard is given for the consequences, and no restrictions have been proposed for the mentally ill, Washington State and Colorado recently legalized marijuana without regard to mentally ill persons. Can you imagine the ramifications, no need to imagine, we see it every day, of mentally ill persons in denial who use everything from marijuana to methamphetamines to cocaine illegally. Now imagine if all of it was \"decriminalized\" as most Liberals desire and some Republicans are more than willing to accommodate. Again more family destruction via official policy making.\n\nLiberal-Marxist Dogma took and still takes the egalitarian position that a mentally ill or unbalanced person in denial, emphasis on denial, was and is no different than any other sane person and should be treated as such and thus should be allowed to remain in the greater populace, walking among us, even if they refuse to seek help. Society has paid a tremendous price for this very flawed egalitarian position by Liberals as have a great many families. In fact Jared Loughner's parents made at least two documented attempts to get him mental health care, they were turned away, James Holmes college psychiatrist was so concerned by his conduct that she had him banned from the college campus, and in the case of the adult shooter in Newtown, his mother was so afraid of him that she warned visitors to her home to \"not turn their backs to him, not even when they went to the bathroom\", she further ran into the bureaucratic nightmare that is today's policies to obtain involuntary committal of family members. Under the old system, all would have or could have immediately been involuntarily committed BEFORE they carried out their respective mass shootings.\n\nLiberals are not solely to blame for this current state of Mental Health affairs in the United States. So called Conservatives who often call themselves \"Christians\", have done very little to stop this trend of Liberal Policies, but not out of any philosophical disagreement. Conservatives have done nothing out of a more twisted motive, financial. Conservatives viewed Mental Health as a disposable budgetary item and were very eager to end what they referred to as \"out dated\" Programs for people they really cared very little about. This shortsightedness resulted in millions of mentally ill people being put into the general population, in most cases on the streets, of the United States overnight under the administration of Ronald Reagan. So called Conservatives who championed fiscal restraint choose to utilize the use of the criminal justice system to address mental health issues, which on average costs $7 more for every $1 spent on Mental Health Prevention Programs. The budgetary rationale in the end saved nothing and cost more.\n\nOf greater concern which requires real Leadership, was and still today is the \"stigma\" in \"Low Information\" American Society which is unfairly attached to anyone who willingly seeks treatment for \"mental Illness\". A person who recognizes they have a mental illness and willingly seeks help is vastly different from the criminally insane, yet our immature and \"Low Information\" American Society makes little distinction. When a person has Cancer, we sympathize and encourage treatment, as we do with AIDS and other chronic disease. ? It should be the same for those who seek treatment for mental illness. In fact we have TV Specials for these causes, when was the last time anyone saw a \"Mental illness Awareness& Fund Drive\", on live TV with all the \"Stars\" manning the phones? Where is the \"Jerry Lewis of Mental Illness\"? If someone stepped up, he/she would surely be crazy as the whispers would go.\n\nAfter his 1996 loss to Bill Clinton, former Senator Bob Dole made TV Commercials promoting new medications to address the very serious condition of \"Erectile Dysfunction\", something at Bob Dole's age should not be a priority. One can hardly find an Elder Statesman taking such a stand for Mental Health, and when someone does come forth they are more often mocked. In fact in 1972 a Democrat Vice Presidential Nominee/sitting U.S. Senator from Missouri (Tom Eagleton) was forced to withdraw as a candidate for having the courage to admit he sought treatment for his Mental Health issues, so much for Democrats practicing the Political Correctness they want everyone else to live by.\n\nIn all of his \"engagements\" with various \"Gun Rights Advocates\", Sir Piers Morgan recites the same playbook and questions, he asks the respective \"Gun Rights Advocate\" what gun was used in Aurora Colorado, what gun was used in the Newtown, etc., etc., knowing full well the answer will be Assault weapon or semi-automatic weapons. Piers Morgan is attempting to limit the debate to a common issue, the type of Gun, what has been lost, is the question, \"what type of person carried out each of the mass shootings\" the answer is a criminally insane person that fixated on killing people, and most likely going to do so, whether they had access to a semi-automatic weapon or not. Under the system of Mental Health committal that Liberal ended, it would have been far easier for family to involuntarily commit all of these criminally insane shooters before they murdered anyone.\n\nThe time has come for our society to cease having artificial debates whose only objective is the furtherance of political objectives at the expense of the public good. The current \"Gun Control\" Debate will have no effect on crime, Chicago, has strict gun control, yet it has on average 5 to 8 gun murders per week and rape and assaults are beyond measure and Detroit is worse than Chicago and has equally restrictive gun controls. Looking at a national model, Mexico bans both Guns and Ammunition and it is a battle ground and people live in fear of Drug Cartels. I for one will never live like that.\n\nThe current \"Gun Control Debate\" and any Marxist inspired policy that comes from it will not address the very serious Mental Health issues we have in the United States. That is the real problem that must be addressed and BOTH political parties must admit they have done a serious injustice to people and enact new policies that strengthen families, provide resources, empower Mental Health Professionals, ceases using the criminal justice system for Mental Health issues, and once and for all remove the stigma that our Low Information and superficial Society places on people who have the courage to seek help.\n\nSadly, as usual in the United States today, the people will lose as \"Politicians\" and \"Special Interests\", and \"Celebrities\" continue to parade their self-importance in the ongoing \"Gun Control Debate\".\n\nThe United States already went over the \"The Cliff\"\n\nBy: Rodney Martin\n\nAs I write this column, we are days away from what \"politicians\" and \"pundits\" are calling the \"Fiscal Cliff\", that is on January 1, 2013, a series of spending cuts and tax increases will automatically be implemented that will have devastating impacts on working class Americans. Translation, everyday \"Tax-Paying\" Americans will have to pay for the political prostitution of BOTH Republicans and Democrats who have sold out their respective Oaths of Office and the public interest in favor of Special Interests. For years politicians have said one thing at election time, then gone to Washington D.C and showed every Lobbyist and Special Interest their pockets in exchange for favors, special tax breaks, and special legislation. The American Voter is not without fault, as they have reelected their hometown favorite while often crying, \"throw the bums out\". Change begins at home, if we all voted out our incumbents, we would indeed have change.\n\nThe result of this corrupt American political system, has been one designed specifically to prevent change and the end of the once strong American Middle Class, the end of American Manufacturing, the end of single income families, the end of home ownership, the creation of institutional poverty and the creation of government dependence and creation of a Third World America and an America where half of the American populace pay no taxes but receive government assistance while the other half is required to carry the entire financial responsibility of the Nation. This is commonly known as redistribution of wealth which is the real class warfare.\n\nThe United States has long gone over the \"Fiscal and Social Cliff\". January 1, 2013 will merely be the wakeup call if and when the cuts and tax increases are implemented, and i.e. the bill will have to start being paid. No longer will the fiscal irresponsibility by the treasonous politicians, all of whom have been elected and re-elected by the American people, be able to be hidden from any American who pays taxes, i.e. the 49% who pays. The 51% who pays nothing and receives government assistance will see no real impact and will no doubt continue to cry out for more \"Social Justice\". The Democrats in the House and Senate, as well as the President have made it clear that Entitlements are not \"on the Table\" for Budget reductions, and the Republicans will never discuss the extremely bloated Defense Budget nor will they cut their welfare Programs that benefit Corporations, such as subsidies and Tax Breaks for Exxon-Mobile.\n\nWith unemployment still truly in the double digits, when those who are underemployed and those who have ceased searching for work is factored, there remains a critical need to address immigration, yet BOTH Democrats and Republicans maintain the need to increase Third World immigration, both for separate political reasons, the Democrats for cheap votes and the Republicans for cheap corporate labor. The result has been the displacement of American labor, the reduction of living wages, and the importation of all Third World cultural degradation. One need only see the social ills and the degrading the public school system or tour an Emergency Room after 5PM. Third World Immigration, codified by the 1965 Immigration Act of 1965 hasted the Fiscal Cliff as Third World immigrants over-burdened Federal and State Social Programs and have led to collapse the American Health Care and Education Systems and overloaded the Criminal Justice Systems. Third World Immigrants were never required to fully assimilate as prior generations of European Immigrants. Third World Immigrants brought with them, in many cases a socialist-leftist philosophy, and America decided to embrace the culture of the immigrant rather than the immigrant having to become an American. In many cases, America has ceased becoming a Nation and transformed into a Co-op, whereby many Nationalities come to take advantage of benefits and laws not readily available in their own Nation. In fact, the United States has so cheapened itself, that it is the only Nation that one can purchase citizenship for $400.00 or be a Dual Citizen and serve in the U.S. Congress.\n\nIn such desprite fiscal times, any rational Nation would be having serious discussions as to what is really and truly needed to solve the Nation's ills regardless of politics. The United States has never had such a discussion. In times of excessive unemployment and underemployment and the destruction of the Middle Class, no rational Nation whose leaders truly represent the Nation's interests would seek to expand immigration, yet our President, via unconstitutional Executive Order essentially provided a venue for 12 million illegal aliens to stay in the United States, some States, such as California provide in-State College Tuition to illegal aliens, while charging out of state tuition to American Citizens, and also provide Drivers Licenses to illegal Aliens. Meanwhile Republicans continue to demand more workers from Nations such as India, implying that Americans are just too dumb, what they really mean is that an East Indian will take a High Tech job for less. Such Corporations should be double taxed for each foreign worker, Corporations such as Apple and Microsoft.\n\nIn time of fiscal crisis, why should a Nation have an outdated and punitive Income Tax System that requires half the population carry the financial burden while allowing the other half to pay nothing and receive benefits? Every person in the Nation should pay something, and thus be vested in the Nation. The current \"Fiscal Cliff\" discussion should be generating an intellectual discussion regarding ending the Income Tax and replacing it with a Consumption Tax on all sales except food and medicine. Under this System, everyone, citizen or not, in the Nation would pay something, and for those who want class warfare, the rich would indeed pay more because they spend more, the poor pay less, because they spend less. The current Income Tax System is inherently unfair and un-American as it nationalizes every American's income. The current Income Tax System tell each American how much of their own money they get to keep and unleashes a draconian Soviet style enforcement System that the Founding Fathers would have rebelled against, in fact the current tactics employed by the IRS make George III look like a Choir Boy.\n\nUnder the current Income Tax System, every dollar taken in by the income Tax System only accounts for about half the Nation's budget, the remaining half is paid via loans, Treasury Bills, more often than not by Communist China. Why should we have to borrow from the Communist Chinese because we have a unfair and punitive Tax System that allows half the populace to not pay anything?\n\nThe United States has long ago gone over the Cliff in terms of BOTH Fiscal and Social Policy. What the politicians in Washington are really worried about is that they have run out of smoke & mirrors to hide the real effects from the American people. Come January 1, 2013, every taxpaying American will experience first-hand, the political Sodom & Gomorra that has been Washington D.C. for years as millions of Americans are forced to pay hundreds and thousands more and taxes for freebees which they received no benefit. Maybe then we will some real American spirit, but I will not hold my breath. After all. There is a Pay Day Loan shack on every corner now.\n\nEditor's Note: This Column was written on December 28, 2012.\n\nIS THE \"NORTH AMERICAN NEW RIGHT\"\n\nREALLY RIGHT?\n\nRodney Martin, Director\n\nWorld View Foundations\n\nSeptember 20, 2012\n\nThere is an ongoing discussion within White Nationalist and Revisionist circles regarding a new Cabal which identifies itself as the \"North American New Right\". For some, who identify as this \"North American New Right\", this is an attempt to create a \"Big Tent\" and cast away the so called boogie-men and stereotypes of the past, i.e., neo Nazis, Revisionists, et. al. The \"North American New Right\" self-identifies themselves as intellectuals, and are indeed well spoken, professional, highly educated, and their writings are well presented, even when they regurgitate or usurp the Greats who they seek to \"step over\".\n\nThe fundamental problem and flaw with this so called \"North American New Right\" is it is in reality a rebranded \"New Left\" when its layers are peeled away and its positions, what few that can be found, are revealed. In fact this \"North American New Right\" has failed to propose anything as comprehensive of a Worldview such as National Socialism, which the \"North American New Right\" criticizes as totalitarian and having engaged in genocide. However unlike the \"North American New Right\", National Socialism and even Fascism to a lesser extent was a broad based Worldview in terms of culture, arts, science, health and education.\n\nThe current state of America's and Europe's destruction has come primarily from the halls of academia and intellectuals, and those who have engaged in \"meaningful research and publishing that have damaged the traditional culture and social norms of our society. Interestingly, \"the North American New Right\" sees little to no value in historical Revisionism which seeks to right these wrongs and has resulted in tremendous sacrifices by many writers, publishers, speakers, and researchers.\n\nThe combination of leftist-academia and political libertarianism which calls for absolute freedom to do what one wants when one wants, and in some cases, to whom one wants, which is essentially anarchy, is the basis of what this \"North American New Right\" really is. It is NOT Nationalism, and is definitely not racial Nationalism. A vast majority of the \"North American New Right's\" academic Commissars are indeed leftist-Libertarians when one really reads and listens to what they say and what they write and look into their historical emphasis areas. This is further affirmed by many of the \" North American New Right's \"positions on issues, ones that can be found or they have written about, that are in absolute conflict with fundamental precepts of fundamental Nationalism.\n\nFor insistence, the concepts of anarchy and homosexuality are in absolute conflict with Nationalism and have historically been used as primary weapons by Jews in their assault on White Western Christian Society. Likewise, the \"North American New Right's\" anti-Christian slant and embracing and promotion of leftist thinkers are very telling. Beyond this however, is the \"North American New Right's\" stipulation to traditional historical falsehoods (Jewish) which have been used for decades to harm and subjugate our people, and especially our children, especially the artificial Jewish Holocaust tale, and the slander of Adolf Hitler and to a lesser extent Benito Mussolini and equating \"genocide\" with these two Nationalist leaders. These actions leave it completely lacking in credibility as a Nationalist philosophical organization.\n\nOne of the most telling examples that demonstrate this new so called \"North American New Right\" is in fact really leftist, comes from a December, 2010 Essay written by Greg Johnson, PhD, who is one of the Commissars of the \"North American New Right\", in 2010, Dr. Johnson wrote:\n\n\"There is nothing absurd about the idea of a racially conscious left\"....., Dr. Johnson went on to write,\n\nWest Coast White Nationalists tend to be more strongly concerned with environmental preservation, healthy and sustainable lifestyles, and combating animal cruelty than White Nationalists in other parts of the US. If Savitri Devi were alive today, she would be smuggling stray cats into an organic gardening commune in Berkeley.\n\nWest Coast White Nationalists tend to be more critical of the workings of unrestrained global capitalism. We are pro-labor, protectionist, pro-zoning, and pro-small business.\n\nWest Coast White Nationalists tend to be more non-Christian and to be more honest about it than other White Nationalists. I know atheists, agnostics, neo-pagans, New Agers, and even some who have made extensive study and practice of Eastern philosophies and religions. Religious pluralism and tolerance would definitely be features of a West Coast White Republic.\n\nWest Coast White Nationalists tend to be more tolerant of homosexuals, bisexuals, \"androphiles,\" and \"none of the aboves\" who put their racial identity first.\n\nWest Coast White Nationalists tend to be more tolerant of drugs like marijuana and psychedelics.\n\nWest Coast White Nationalists are far less hung up on sub-racial distinctions and Old World feuds than White Nationalists in the East and South. We tend to think of ourselves as whites first and foremost.\n\nA critical read of Dr. Johnson's 2010 Essay is clear, Dr. Johnson is a typical Wine & Cheese San Francisco Liberal, we all know these types of liberals, who espouse the positions that Dr. Johnson speaks of in his 2010 Essay, but at the same time lives in Gated Communities so as to stay away from the \"icky Blacks & Browns\", but they are equally contemptuous of working class Whites and moderately educated Whites and especially White Christians. Likewise there are \"uppity Homosexuals\" who share these same positions and are equally Leftist/Libertarian. Politically, there is no difference between those Liberals, and many Libertarians and what Dr. Johnson and the \"North American New Right\" advocates, however they and Dr. Johnson and his \"New Right\" are NOT true Nationalists, regardless of how many Devi books he sells.\n\nDr. Johnson's statements in his 2010 Essay regarding tolerance or embracing of homosexuals, drugs, anti-Christianity, and his schizophrenic statement regarding Race all embrace or stipulate to tools and ideals used by the Jew and their Marxist minions of political correctness for decades, these are positions of the secular humanist which itself is a Judeo-Marxist tenant. One also sees trace elements of San Francisco Socialist Trade Unionism in Dr. Johnson's Essay, which is leftist as well.\n\nOf course Dr. Johnson's interpretation of Devi is incorrect as well. Today Devi would be far more concerned with the current decline of Western Civilization than cats at Berkley. Dr. Johnson seems to forget her work in the Post-War Germany for which she was jailed.\n\nThe basis of Nationalism should be based on the 14 Words, regardless of whether one agrees with all of the tactics and history of their author. For those who are conscience of our heritage and who are raising children, my wife and I are raising 5, there is little time for artificial intellectual \"circle jerks\". White families need an intellectually honest and viable response to the onslaught that has overwhelmed them since 1955. White families need an aggressive proactive voice that will address the historical injustices as well as the hijacking of our religion and institutions. This cannot be done by way of stipulation, conformity and retreat. One can go one and on about how effective Jews have used \"tolerance\" for issues such as and drugs, homosexuality and the successful perversion of true Christianity, especially in corrupting White women and children.\n\nWhen one looks at sheer demographics, it is not hard to understand that our plight is dire and thus the 14 Words must be a primary objective of any Nationalist Organization. Unfortunately, the 14 Words is not the basis of the \"North American New Right\", they have \"stepped over\" them. Additionally, the \"North American New Right\" as also chosen to \"step over\" Revisionism as well, and thus stipulate to the hijacking of our history and culture, one need only look to post 1945 Germany to realize the folly of that. One must seriously look at all the true Nationalist elements that the \"North American New Right\" has \"stepped over\" or reject in favor of a \"Big Tent\" whose roots stem from or advocate \"tolerance\" for Anarchy, Homosexuality, Marijuana, Psychedelics, anti-Christianity, anti-Revisionism.\n\nThe fundamental difference between real Nationalism or National Socialism, which I consider the only true Nationalism based on its success, and the so called \"North American New Right\" is real Nationalism, such as National Socialism is not for everyone. \"The North American New Right\" is making an attempt to be all things to all people which is a judeo-liberal principal and contrary to Nationalism, in fact it is quasi-egalitarian. Additionally, the \"North American New Right\" totally excludes the millions of every day working and poor Whites, the blue collar working poor Whites who are most victimized by the evils of multi-culturalism, integration, and race-mixing, a topic which is not addressed by the \"North American New Right\". The National Socialists, who have been \"stepped over\" by the \"North American New Right\", grew and their success was because of these very people, NOT leftist intellectuals. The National Socialists were successful not because they called for conformity to the decadence of the times, as the \"North American New Right\" does today, but because they called for a return to the sanity of traditional cultural normalcy and attacked those who sought to distort and pollute the traditional culture. This is NOT lost on the \"North American New Right\", they reject this because they are really truly Left.\n\nInterestingly, in his 2010 Essay, Dr. Johnson also wrote, \"White Nationalism will never triumph if it remains confined to the political right\", so one must ask, why he now advocates for an organization called, \"North American New Right\"? Does New Right really mean New Left? Dr. Johnson concluded his 2010 Essay by saying, \"But White Nationalism is the stuff of dreams anyway. So with that caveat, I think there is reason to believe that, if a racially conscious left arises again, it will be on the West Coast.\" In Dr. Johnson's more recent Essay's he has essentially proposed a new Plutocracy to replace to current one. This is a distinction absent a difference. I will say I do agree that White Nationalism should not be confined to the \"Right\", but that is where I part from Dr. Johnson, I believe both the Left and the Right should be jettisoned.\n\nBased on his writings and spoken words, it is logical to conclude that Dr. Johnson has never been a supporter of White Nationalism in its true form, and is not now, and his and the \"North American New Right's\" true philosophical bent is Leftist/Liberalism/Libertarian. When one looks at all of the Commissars and Comrades in the \"North American New Right\" one finds one thinking about the Trojans pondering that horse with its belly loaded with enemy troops. White Nationalists must not make the mistake of the Trojans open our gates to the Trojan Horse, the stakes are too high at this juncture in history.\n\nADL-JEWISH HYPOCRISY\n\nWHAT IS HYPOCRISY?\n\n\"ADL prints flyer's OPPOSING Jewish race-mixing and say openly that race-mixing is for WHITES. This is not only hypocrisy, but reveals their true goals and mission...\"\n\nWhat is Hypocrisy? A good example is when Jews promote miscegenation or in many cases essentially call for it mandated for Whites, especially with regard to white women submitting to black men, but then cal for absolute protection of Jewish identity and in fact the ADL prints flyer's OPPOSING Jewish race-mixing and say openly that race-mixing is for WHITES only.\n\nThis is not only hypocrisy, but reveals their true goals and mission.\n\nGone are the days when Jewish Marxist Organizations like the ADL operates in the shadows, their agenda is now open and they freely state publicly they goals and objectives. We must now confront this Agenda which threatens our children's future and the future of Western Civilization.\n\nJews in Los Angeles hold seminars at UCLA to discuss their success in reshaping the \"racial makeup of California\", Jews in Israel issue statements of concern regarding Israeli Jews engaging in relationship with American Jews because of concerns over racial purity and we now see the ADL openly say that race-mixing is for Whites and printing flyers extolling the evils of race mixing, BUT only for Jews.\n\nThe message is clear, the Jew wants all other racial groups to end, they wish to see confusion and no identity, save for Jews, thus they will dominate the confused unidentified result.\n\nThe time has come for Whites to reject the age old game book employed by the Jew and their stooges and fellow Marxist Fellow Travelers. When we are told \"there is no such thing as race\", we should reply clearly and concisely, \"tell that to the Jews\". When we are told, \"race is not important\", we should reply firmly, then it should not be important to the Jews. When we are called racists, we should stand firmly and reply, then so are the Jews and use all of these examples.\n\nThe Jews are racialists, it is time we reject the double standard and be prod racialists too. The Jews aggressively work on behalf of their interests, we MUST do so as well. The Jews attack our culture, social norms, religion, institutions, damage our children and attempt to instill a fraudulent sense of history and collective guilt, this must be confronted.\n\nWe must expose the Jew as he \"crys out in pain as he strikes us\".\n\nIT'S THE CULTURE STUPID\n\nBy: Rodney Martin\n\nAs the Presidential silly season heats up, all the talk has centered on the \"economy\", or \"getting \"Americans back to work\", or \"job creation\". All of this talk is essentially a Trojan Horse designed to distract Americans from the real issue.\n\nIt's the culture stupid.\n\nWhile this may sound incredible, it is true, all that ails the United States economically is easy to fix. The real cancer on the American soul is America's cultural decline.\n\nSince 1965 and the passing of the Immigration Act of 1965, and other so called ‘Great Society\" legislation, the United States has been on a fast track to Marxist decadent cultural social norms.\n\nPrior to 1965, immigration was strictly regulated and based on the National interest and American Citizenship had meaning. After 1965 and especially today, U.S. citizenship is relatively meaningless. Peoples from all over the world make it a point to enter the United States for the sole purpose to give birth, so as to secure \"dual-citizenship\" and thus secure American \"benefits\", they then either promptly return to the Nation where their hearts are, obtain Temporary-AKA Permanent VISAs, or simply stay illegally, absent fear of deportation thanks to Mr. Obama's recent Immigration Decree whereby Illegal Aliens need not fear deportation for being in the United States illegally. In fact the United States is the only Nation on the Globe with such a liberal \"birth-right\" citizenship which grants automatic citizenship by birth, even if the mother or father are not citizens.\n\nNinety percent of all immigration since the passing of the 1965 Immigration Act has come from the Third World; this has had an incredible negative impact on the Culture and Social Norms of the United States which is responsible for the economic, social, and cultural quagmire the United States presently finds itself in. One need only look at crime statistic to quantify this as well.\n\nIn 1965, BOTH Democrats and Republicans made the conscience decision to change the United States via immigration policy. The Democrats sought cheap votes and Republicans, dominated by its corporatist establishment wing, sought cheap labor. As a result of the Immigration Act of 1965, both Democrats and Corporatist Republicans received what they wanted and the United States lost.\n\nConcurrent with the passing of the Immigration Act of 1965, Congress passed a plethora of then President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society Programs, thus creating a modern Welfare State that dwarfed the New Deal. Unlike the New Deal in the 1930's, not a single 1960's Liberal Great Society Program was or has been struck down by the \"Nine Ole Swine\" of the Supreme Court. Programs such as AFDC, Food Stamps, Medicare, and Medicaid came into existence within a year of 1965. For the existing 1965 U.S. population these programs were designed as anti-poverty measures and specifically designed as short-term assistance until families could \"get back on their feet\". To the world, especially the Third World, these Great Society Programs became an incentive to take advantage of the new very liberal Immigration Act of 1965 which encouraged Third World Immigration on a grand scale, both legally and illegally. These programs gave Third World Immigrants the Marxists welfare State of their homeland AND the lifestyle of the United States, of course they brought their cultural and social norms with them.\n\nThe results have been catastrophic. Today, while 2 million \"new arrivals\" are approved each year legally there are 20 million illegal aliens in the United States and 800,000 to 1 million enter illegally each year. Liberals like to call these illegal aliens \"undocumented\", thus attempting to infer they are actually citizens without papers.\n\nThe fact remains they are illegal, entered the United States illegally and by all legal, ethical and moral standards should be removed. A Nation without borders is not a Nation at all. U.S. prisons and Jails are filled with illegal Aliens who have committed heinous crimes, often repeat offenders. Today, American taxpayers have been forced via U.S. Supreme Court rulings to pay for the education of children of illegal aliens and pay for their healthcare, even when many Americans themselves have none, thus illegal aliens are entitled to services for which they do not pay. Today, it is common to see children cross the U.S. Mexico border, from Mexico, to attend schools in the United States, bussed of course at taxpayer expense to and from the border. Today, it is not uncommon for small border Communities, such as San Luis, AZ, to have more people with rented post office boxes in order to receive government checks, than the actual population of the City.\n\nThe Immigration Act of 1965 imported millions of new people into the United States for political and \"business\" purposes, but failed to take into account the long term National and Cultural interests. The Congress in 1965 was only concerned with cheap labor and cheap votes, as they are today. What the Congress in 1965 and 2012 fail to and refuse to acknowledge is that Third World Immigration brings with it Social and Cultural Norms that are not consistent with the traditional Cultural and Social Norms of the United States. For the hundred years prior to the 1965 Immigration Act, Immigrants were required to become Americans, i.e. Immigrants came to America to become \"Americans\", had to learn, speak and understand English, as well as the laws, values, customs and social norms of the United States. This ended with the 1965 Act. Today, Aliens come to use America, refuse to adapt to American values and social norms and more often than not, walk out of the \"citizenship ceremony\" not knowing a word of English, thus not knowing the commercial language not only of their \"new\" Country, but also the world. Many of our new \"citizens\" come from Third World Nation were Marxism is the predominate philosophy and thus their belief in \"government solution\" and generational dependency on \"social justice programs\".\n\nWork is not the ultimate social program in the Third World as it was in the United States prior to 1965.\n\nToday, 49% of the American population receives some form of payment from the federal or state government; that same percentage pays no taxes. Correlate these alarming figures with the change in America's population as a result of the 1965 Immigration Act and thus the demand for a \"path to citizenship for the 20 million illegals\" and the clever use of language such as \"the Dream Act\", or \"Comprehensive Immigration Reform\". Third World Immigrants are actively working on behalf of the interests of their own.\n\nThanks to the Immigration Act of 1965, Immigration and U.S. Citizenship are meaningless and thanks to the Immigration Act of 1965, the United States imported millions of Third World Aliens that did not and do not share American values and cultural norms. Thanks to the Immigration Act of 1965, the United States is on the verge of financial ruin as it stresses to fund social welfare programs for an ever increasing population of people culturally dependent on such programs. We have the liberals as the champions of Marxist political correctness and multiculturalism and the corporatist Republican establishment to thank for this.\n\nCompounding the immigration issue has been the narrative hammered into the heads of our children and the weak minded via liberal elements in public schools, the entertainment industry, pundits, and academics. These elements saw an opportunity in the 1960's and pounced. Liberal elements proved to be both aggressive and effective and traditional conservatives proved to be both passive and incompetent. Liberal elements, beginning in the 1960's advanced a counter culture agenda designed to end the traditional family, replace work with welfare, normalize homosexuality, and instill a sense of generational guilt in favor of mandatory Marxist multiculturalism in the minds of Americans of White-Anglo-Saxon decent. This would become evident as liberal elements began to rewrite American public school textbooks.\n\nTraditional conservative elements remained largely silent and ineffective while liberal elements took control of American schools and transformed them into multicultural indoctrination centers where Che Quevara is respected, George Washington is hardly mentioned, save for a rebuke for being a slave owner, miscegenation is encouraged and most recently, patriotic songs are forbidden out of fear of \"offending other cultures\". Likewise, the entertainment industry went in to hyper mode in churning out movies that are the polar opposite of James Cagney's patriotic \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\".\n\nThe entertainment industry, which once, produced films championing American exceptionalism and American pride, changed focus and since 1965, has produced films designed to showcase a collective and generational guilt associated with being an American. The entertainment industry has gone to the extreme in distorting and outright fabrication with regard to history in order to promote a Marxist multicultural narrative. The news media likewise has acted as the entertainment industry's kissing cousin in the destruction of American Culture. The news media, has, since the days of FDR, been not only left, but socialist to communist in its leanings. The news media has failed to report on news stories that would embarrass its darlings and gone to the extreme to destroy those it felt threatened the leftist-Marxist agenda, i.e. Joseph McCarty and Richard Nixon. Anyone who dare expound \"unconventional\" ideas is branded as an \"extremist\" by the elitist news media, while they report glowing on \"new progressive ideas and concepts\". The elite news media is and has been the front line troops used in the war on American Culture. Fear of the media has been traditional conservatives' main weakness. One need only look at how so called \"conservatives\" in Washington react to the elite media to understand this.\n\nSince 1965, traditional conservatives have ceded the education of our children, our healthcare, our Nationhood, and above all, thought to the liberal elements. How many times during a conversation with a fellow conservative does a traditional conservative look over his/her shoulder to see who they might offend if they finish that sentence/thought? This is wrong and proof that the thought police are at work, in each and every one of our heads. Liberal elements have, since 1965, transformed the United States from the Constitutional Republic as established by the founding fathers into George Orwell's Animal Farm, where \"some are more equal than others\".\n\nThe cultural decline since 1965 is shocking:\n\nToday, unlike 1965, as a result of liberal elements, supporting traditional family values is equivalent to being \"intolerant\" or a \"hater\", while homosexuality is encouraged and protected.\n\nToday, unlike 1965, public schools may circumvent parents and take underage girls to the local Planned Parenthood abortion mill; this is called \"progressive\".\n\nToday, unlike 1965, traditional marriage is taxed, mocked and discounted while homosexual marriage is praised, encouraged and protected. Today, when voters vote to protect traditional marriage, a homosexual Judge voids their vote.\n\nToday, unlike 1965, the traditional family has virtually been wiped out; motherhood is discouraged in favor of meaningless \"jobs\" leaving children to be raised in day care. Corporatist Republicans are to blame for this as well.\n\nToday, unlike in 1965, many \"American\" Cities, Towns, and Communities have no Independence Day Celebration, but do have very elaborate celebrations to commemorate holidays of foreign lands.\n\nToday, unlike 1965, government business is conducted in a variety of languages and official documents are printed in languages other than English.\n\nToday, unlike 1965, teachers may tell their students they may refrain from the Pledge of Allegiance out of respect for other cultures.\n\nToday, students are taught in some schools (Tucson, Az) that the United States stole the western United States from Mexico and it rightfully should be returned or taken, this is otherwise known as sedition. Interestingly, many, if not most of these students receive welfare payments from the U.S. Government.\n\nToday, unlike 1965, a majority of couples are not married and a majority of children do NOT live with a married mother and father.\n\nToday, unlike 1965, there are an astounding number of children having children, out of wedlock births and young women with multiple children by different fathers.\n\nThe economic woes American faces today are minor when one considers the cultural disaster. The economic issues are relatively easy to fix. The Cultural issues are far harder and will take REAL leadership. The Cultural crisis we face requires moral leadership and requires a leader unafraid of the screams and shouts by Marxist and homosexual elites.\n\nThe cultural crisis must be solved by strong moral Christians who are unafraid to tell people that they cannot do what feels good, that American is not Sodom & Gomorra and that there is a difference between humans and animals, animals do what feels good regardless of the consequences, Humans do not, liberals have indoctrinated a generation of Americans into thinking that there should be no consequences for acting like and thinking like animals.\n\nFinally, those who have created and continue to perpetuate the cultural decline must be confronted and exposed for what they are, decedent Marxists who are anti-Christian and anti-American, andante-Family. These elements must be expelled from our Society. Traditional Christian Conservatives can no longer afford to have timid souls and trembling spirits and be fearful of being called names for standing up for what is right, decent and moral. It's time to stand up proudly and be a \"Social Conservative\" and in the words of Barry Goldwater in 1964,\"I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue\".\n\nYES- THE \"GAY\" AGENDA DOES EXIST AND IT IS DANGEROUS\n\nBy: Rodney Martin\n\nDuring the debate regarding Proposition 8 in California, many supporters of Prop 8 stated that their opposition to \"Gay Marriage\" was based on the so called \"Gay Agenda\" and its assault on the Traditional Family and Family Values. Advocates who sought to preserve traditional marriage warned that \"marriage equality\" as homosexual extremists call for, is merely a first step to a much larger \"Gay Agenda\" that calls for indoctrination at public schools, special legal status for the perverted in the midst of society, a retooling of adoption and basic family law precepts, and the eventual destruction of the traditional family unit.\n\nGay Leaders have denied these charges, but the facts prove otherwise.\n\nCalifornia Voters voted to amend the State Constitution in order to protect traditional marriage as it has been established and practiced for time and eternity by every culture on the globe.\n\nOf course when the Gay Extremists lost at the ballot box, they ran to a then closeted homosexual Judge, who ruled that the voters dare not disallow his sexual perversion.\n\nThe case is on its way to the Nine Ole Swine on the Supreme Court, where Chief Justice Roberts will not disappoint and will no doubt craft a more creative ruling than he did with Obama Care in favor of the destruction of traditional marriage. After all as an associate at of Hogan & Hartson As part of the firm's pro bono work, Roberts worked behind the scenes for gay rights advocates, reviewing filings and preparing arguments for the Supreme Court case Romer vs. Evans in (1996).\n\nDespite their denials, homosexual extremists and zealots do in fact have a \"Gay Agenda\", one need only look to Sacramento and Democrat Senator Mark Leno's whose sole focus is to churn out legislation to assure that the \"Gay Agenda is codified into law and is force fed, and now with the Supreme Court's recent decision, Leno may propose a Tax if California Citizens do not comply with pro-homosexual initiatives.\n\nFor example, Leno proposed, and it was passed and signed by Governor Brown, requiring Homosexual \"achievement\" be taught in all California public schools. This type of revolting indoctrination has but one objective and flies in the face of local control of schools by local school boards.\n\nNow Senator Leno has proposed legislation that allows children to have more than 2 parents. The purpose of this bill is to allow warped individuals who leave traditional relationships and enter perverted same sex relationships to transfer or share parentage with their latest sheet warmer by decree. The effect of Leno's legislation is to say who or what one sleeps with can be a parent, welcome to Sodom & Gomorra.\n\nSenator Leno's legislation demonstrates that the \"Gay Agenda\" exists, that it is dangerous, and that it is all about perversion. It's time for Christians to stand up and be equally outspoken and active in opposing the evil that seeks to attack our Nation, children and our families.\n\nCONGRESS MUST REVIEW JOHN ROBERTS COMPETENCY\n\nBy Rodney Martin\n\nConservatives embraced John Roberts when George Bush nominated him to replace the late William Rehnquist as Chief Justice, a move in obvious haste and not given much thought, very much in keeping with many Bush decisions.\n\nI am an orthodox Christian Conservative, I never embraced Roberts. One need only look at Roberts's background to understand his siding with the liberals. Roberts entered private law practice in 1986, just 19 years before his appointment as Chief Justice, a very shallow record for a candidate for Chief Justice, as an associate at of Hogan & Hartson As part of the firm's pro bono work, Roberts worked behind the scenes for gay rights advocates, reviewing filings and preparing arguments for the Supreme Court case Romer Vs. Evans in (1996), which Gays describe as \"the Gay movement's most important legal victory.\"\n\nIn fact, some 3 months before Roberts infamous Ruling, a friend of mine who is a local attorney was visiting me at my home, as usual we discussed issues, and I told him that the Court would uphold ObamaCare and that Roberts would be America's Judas who would officially transition America to a Soviet style Central Government System. My friend disagreed but Roberts of course did not disappoint.\n\nWhy do I make such a seemingly harsh statement, as \"Roberts officially transitioned America to a Soviet style Central Government\", because it is true, that is the ramification of the ruling he penned along with his new Comrades on the Marxist Left among the nine ole Swine on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe much broader authority Roberts transferred to the Central Government; something so far has not soaked into the minds of Americans whose retentions are two minutes or less and remains outraged by the healthcare ramifications but should strike outrage into every American much greater than the ObamaCare issue.\n\nChief Justice Roberts granted to the Central Government in Washington the ability to tax choice and the authority to tax citizens if they do not purchase what the Central Government wants it to purchase.\n\nYesterday it was healthcare, what will it be tomorrow?\n\nFor instance, we know the Central Government has imposed Renewable Energy Mandates on Utility Companies, i.e. they must obtain up to 33% of their energy from Renewable sources, now under the Roberts Ruling, and the Central Government can extend this mandate to individual citizens, i.e. citizens must install Solar Panels so as to offset their electrical use by a certain percentage or face a tax, Then of course we all know the Central Government wants to reduce air pollution and increase fuel efficiency, thus the Central Government, via John Roberts decision, can mandate that every American must own a hybrid car or face a tax.\n\nThere are no limits, based on John Roberts's decision, after all, John Roberts decision said, that the Central Government can tax anything, even if it is something that it cannot regulate and even if the citizen chooses not to do something, i.e. taxes can now be used as a penalty.\n\nOf course the IRS is the ultimate KGB who will enforce these \"taxes\" to assure the citizens compliance with what the Washington Central Government mandates. The taxes will be added to your Income Tax Return and of course citizens will be required to furnish an incredible amount of new data to assure \"accuracy\" and \"reporting\", non-compliance will result in those audits, nonpayment will result in levies and liens and worse.\n\nIt is not hard to understand the celebrations by the throngs of those who celebrated the Roberts Ruling, those celebrations represent the entitlement mentality in America which has resulted from a retooling of American Culture beginning in 1965, those who embrace entitlement are among the 50% in America who pay nothing into America and are the same 50% who receive some form of benefit and believe others should pay for their lifestyles and choices, no matter how unhealthy, immoral and decadent. John Roberts has now delivered the rest of America into their hands by handing them the most powerful weapon in the arsenal of government, the Tax Code and the use of Tax to force compliance.\n\nThis is the legacy of John Roberts, an appointment by a \"Republican\", not a Conservative.\n\nWhat is the solution? Mitt Romeny, who enacted the first ObamaCare is making empty promises to \"repeal & Replace\" absent specifics, something he cannot do without 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nWhat should be done is Impeachment. House Republicans in the 1990's impeached Bill Clinton for a lot less than what John Roberts did.\n\nLikewise the House held, for the first time, the Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder in criminal Contempt.\n\nThe catch is these actions, under guise of \"accountability\" have been by Republican Houses vs. Democrat office holders, and Roberts is a Republican, or say he says. It's time for the Republicans in the House to place the interest of the Nation and the future of our Republic above a simplistic Party label.\n\nThere is credible evidence that John Roberts has serious competency issues and should not hold the office. Roberts has serious neurological (mental) issues and has history of seizures, http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/health/01seizure.html?_r=1 Congress has a fiduciary responsibility to assure that his mental faculties are fully in order. The drugs that Roberts's may take have serious side effects, including, drowsiness, irritability, mental slowing and forgetfulness. Roberts's rationale and judgment and flipping at the last minute raise serious mental competency issues which Congress should investigate. Roberts is serving a lifetime appointment, we can ill afford to many more of his irrational decisions which embrace interesting social experiments that have long failed the test of history.\n\nAt the same time Congress must convene impeachment proceeds vs. Elena Kagan for hearing the ObamaCare Case. As Obama's Solicitor General, Kagen rendered legal Memos/Opinions as to how the ObamaCare could be defended in court. This placed her in a conflict of interest and at minimum the appearance of a Conflict of Interest. This again brings us back to John Roberts, as Chief Justice Roberts should have insisted that Kagen recuse herself, Congress must ask why he did not.\n\nThe Cause of the Second Civil War in the Uni"
