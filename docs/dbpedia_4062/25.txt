After Pearl harbour was bombed in 1941 the war in the Pacific gained momentum; Japanese troops began to move relentlessly south, towards Australia. Determined to provide an information network along the vulnerable coastlines of Northern Australia and the islands to the north, the Australian Navy developed the Coast Watching Organisation.
