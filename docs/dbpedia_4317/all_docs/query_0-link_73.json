        "text": "After agonizing about writing a âbest ofâ blog and publishing it before January 1, I decided to take a pause and enjoy the holidays. So here I look back on my 2023 in the rear view mirror but with memories still pretty fresh.\n\nRegular readers of this blog likely already know of my oft shared opinion of the superfluous nature of âbest ofâ lists and of my acquiescence in producing such on an annual basis. I certainly donât think of this as a meaningless exercise and I think the process has grown on me. It is a chance to achieve a perspective which would be missed by simply plowing on ahead with the usual flow of reviews and articles. But drawing down that 12 month perspective is an opportunity to evaluate those months, to see where weâve been and to hopefully get a smidgen of insight into where I/we are likely headed.\n\nMy Facebook friends will recognize the representative meme at the head of this article which is one of the more cloying aspects of âAIâ, whatever that is. So indulge me for a moment to look at this seemingly new intrusion into the reality we thought we knew. So, what is âAIâ and what will it do to us? Ultimately Iâm not the one to answer that question but Iâd like to throw some ideas to add to the speculation.\n\nFirst, the choices a composer makes, like the choices of a painter, a writer, etc. are the stuff of the mystery of creation itself. Why âA majorâ, or why that tuning, or scale, or rhythm, or orchestration, etc? So along comes the notion of removing, or at least distancing, the artist from their creative product. That notion started not with famed proponent John Cage but rather with Johannes Chrysostymous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in his K. 516f musical dice game. Voila! Algorithmic composition (actually fairly common practice in the classical era). An early manifestation of âAIâ? Perhaps.\n\nLejaren Hiller (1924-1994) was the first composer to employ electronic data processing in a musical work in his Fourth String Quartet subtitled âIliac Suiteâ in 1957. There followed similar experiments with various iterations of electronic creations at music centers worldwide including The University of Illinois at Champaign, Columbia-Princeton, Stanford, The University of California Berkeley and San Diego, The San Francisco Tape Music Center (later subsumed into the Mills College Center for Contemporary Music, IRCAM in Paris, Israel Electronic Music Studio, and counterparts in the Nordic countries, Germany, Belgium, etc. Proto âAIâ?\n\nWhile historically interesting I raise this issue to say that, as far as I can tell, âAIâ has not made this writerâs greatest hits list but it is interesting and maybe even useful. With that, my concern for the subject officially goes to the back burner for a later time.\n\n2023 has been a year of great personal changes for the writer of this blog. A job change, a geographical relocation, and many things unrelated to this blog characterized a busy year for New Music Buff. So here in a sort of holiday tradition I present my âBest of 2023â from my little listenerâs corner of the world. For the sake of simplicity I present a more or less chronological exposition of my sonic adventures. (N.B. Not one portion of this article made use of âAIâ).\n\nI begin with not with my 20 most read posts, a practice that characterized previous iterations of this annual exercise. Instead I am providing my top 20 favorite releases that were reviewed in 2023. Please note a couple of caveats. First, I receive a lot of review requests, more than I can even listen to, much less give a reasonably intelligent review. Albums that Iâve not reviewed should not be assumed to be bad or insignificant and my reviews are personal observations. I really only review albums that interest me anyway. Second, this article is only one reviewerâs opinion and not intended to be definitive or to supersede anyone elseâs opinions. Third, this is not the end of my attention to music that was released in 2023. Some releases require more time to give a fair listen and a respectful review. There are more to come in 2024.\n\nFirst a few stats: 2023 saw the publication of some 45 blog posts on New Music Buff, earning me 9693 views for the year. I rarely get comments on my posts (though I welcome and invite comments both positive and negative). Not bad, I think, for the overall less appreciated musical styles that fuel my desire to write about.\n\nNow, in chronological order (of publication) are my personal favorites as a listener:\n\nBinaural Beats in the Tudor Rainforest started my new year with a bang. Reviewing this disc required me to take a closer look at the astounding work of David Tudor and his unique contributions to new music. This important release is a recording of a work which, by its own concept cannot receive a âdefinitiveâ performance. But this recording comes mighty close, involving âbinauralâ recording utilizing a mobile set of binaural microphones which are worn by the recordist. In addition this recording involved a collaboration with Pauline Oliveros and a group called, âComposers Inside Electronicsâ. The recording was done during Oliverosâ tenure at UCSD. Rainforest IV is so called because it is the fourth iteration of the instructions that form the original concepts of Tudorâs composition, âRainforestâ. It is an immersive sonic experience heard on headphones but actually not bad even heard on stereo speakers. A rich and wonderful release.\n\nFrom a 1960s electroacoustic to a budding 21st Century composer Kotoka Suzuki released on the reliably interesting and even visionary Starkland label. Next Gen Electroacoustic: Kotoka Suzuki will introduce the listener to this rising star who doubtless will produce more of her compelling compositions.\n\nIgor Levit is a fine concert pianist whose albums are effectively redefining the way we, as listeners, perceive the western classical oeuvre. Igor Levit: Defining Tristan does for the various musical pieces inspired by the Tristan legend what Levit did for the concept of the great keyboard variations in which he selected Beethovenâs âDiabelli Variationsâ and Frederic Rzewskiâs âEl Pueblo Unido Variationsâ to join his recording of the Bach âGoldberg Variationsâ in a 3 disc package placing these three large sets of variations as emblematic of the genre in three different centuries (18th, 19th, and 20th). Levit, by his recorded output, is providing a valuable perspective which may influence repertory choices for years to come.\n\nLevitâs traversal of the Tristan legend here ranges from the second recording of Hans Werner Henzeâs too seldom heard âTristan Preludesâ back to works by Wagner (of course) and Liszt. He even slips in his wonderful solo piano transcription of the Adagio of Mahlerâs unfinished 10th Symphony into the mix. This is a very compelling Tristan anthology by a deservedly still rising star.\n\nThis Cantaloupe release by Bang on a Can composer and master clarinetist Evan Ziporyn is both masterful and great fun. Evan Ziporyn: Bang on a Pop consists of transcriptions of âpopâ songs for multiple clarinets all played by Ziporyn via his very effective multi-track recordings. The album is very personal and pretty much cliche free with these engaging and insightful transcriptions. It is an homage to the songwriters as well as a showcase for Ziporyn both as composer and as performer.\n\nThe Young Personâs Guide to Ben Johnston is an ideal way to introduce listeners to the wonderful world of the late Ben Johnstonâs music. Johnston, a student and colleague of Harry Partch shows his compositional skills utilizing non-traditional western tunings in these representative works. Johnston here does for some quasi pop tunes what Evan Ziporyn did with his clarinetist perspective for the tunes on Pop Matters. But Johnstonâs pretty, accessible work belies fascinating complexities that donât actually sound complex to the listener. This disc contains Johnstonâs last completed work, âAshokan Farewellâ (which Johnston took to be a public domain folk tune but is in fact a piece written by Jay Ungar). It is paired with the 4th String Quartet (a set of ingenious variations on âAmazing Graceâ) from 1982 and the 9th String Quartet of 1997. Profound, lovely to listen to, and a great homage.\n\nThis DVD is a major addition to the discography of Charles Amirkhanianâs sound poetry as fine sampling of one aspect of Carol Lawâs (Amirkhanianâs life partner) complementary visual art. These collaborations are also important contributions to the visual and performative aspect of these collaborative works. Amirkhanian has been a fine curator and promoter of the work of others but he has rather seldom stepped into the spotlight himself. This quirky genre got some fabulous exposure at the 7 day Other Minds 23 festival in 2018 in which Amirkhanianâs work was presented in the (surprisingly varied) context of sound poetry of the amazing international collection of artists who were hosted at those events. This DVD should be in the collection of anyone interested in new music sound poetry and performance art. It is both entertaining and mind bending featuring a juxtaposition of images and sound reviewed in greater detail in the post âDyadic Dreamsâ. But words cannot do justice to these works. You really have to see them.\n\nReaders of this blog know my fondness for the Chicago based label Cedille and their promotion of Chicago based musicians. This disc stands out in this groupâs embrace of non-traditional composers alongside more traditional works. The inclusion of works by DJ composer Jlin and the academy based genre defying duo Flutronics alongside composers like Danny Elfman and Philip Glass demonstrate the wide ranging repertoire of Third Coast Percussion. Much more information can be found in Perspectives: Spectacular World Premiere Recordings from Third Coast Percussion on my blog. This one reimagines the percussion ensemble.\n\nThis disc is a good example of why listeners and collectors should pay attention to the Neuma record label. Philip Blackburn, who had been the very successful curator of Innova records, took over the defunct Neuma label which was founded with the intention of promoting largely electroacoustic music though not exclusively.\n\nAgnese Toniuttiâs New Music Vision is actually a review of two discs by this rising star, a dedicated new music pianist that needs to be on your radar. The other Neuma disc contains Toniuttiâs traversal of John Cageâs reluctant masterpiece, âSonatas and Interludes for prepared pianoâ.\n\nThe disc pictured here is Toniuttiâs vision beyond the Cage work. This one focuses on mostly living composers Lucia Dlugoszewski, Tan Dun, Philip Corner, and Toniuttiâs herself. Basically, if Toniutti plays it, you should probably at least give a listen.\n\n2023 saw the completion of Bay Area pianist Sarah Cahillâs epic survey of piano music by female composers. Cahill is another (predominantly) new music focused pianist about whom I would also assert that, if she plays it, you should probably give at least one listen.\n\nThe End of the Beginning: Sarah Cahillâs âThe Future is Femaleâ Trilogy Completed will tell you all you need to know about this trilogy which encompasses about 300 years of music history and sheds light on some fascinating and substantial music written by women. Most of the works on this trilogy of albums are, in fact, world premieres but, fear not, even the pieces which are not premieres are likely not in your collection. This is a brilliant selection of music that effectively throws down the gauntlet to challenge other artists to explore this repertory. This trilogy is a true landmark and a joy to the ears.\n\nThis third volume in the wonderful Catalyst Quartetâs survey of another unjustly neglected group of composers focuses on the music of three black Americans of the twentieth century. Catalyzing Blackness, Volume Three: The Catalyst Quartet plays 20th Century music by Black Americans was nominated (but didnât win) for a Grammy Award and, happily, Iâm told that more volumes are in preparation. Again, this music is a pleasant revelation that does for black composers what Sarah Cahill has done for women composers (N.B. The first volume by the Catalyst Quartet focused on the black female composer Florence Price). And hereâs hoping that Coleridge Taylor Perkinson, George Walker and William Grant Still will become household names in the concert hall.\n\nSon of Partch, Carrying on a Tradition is a really wonderful disc which, though I reviewed it in exceedingly positive terms, provoked a strongly negative reaction from the artist. The reaction apparently also provoked enough interest to have made this review one of my most read of 2023.\n\nBut, aside from the unfortunate negative reaction, I still maintain that this is a fine release worthy of attention from anyone who likes new music, microtonality, and the music of Harry Partch. Cris Forster is a composer, theoretician, and instrument builder clearly descended from the Partch tradition. His work deserves attention and this disc is a very satisfying experience.\n\nSteven Schick is a master percussionist and conductor. This release is the first volume of his personal choices of solo percussion repertoire. Solo Percussion Manifesto Volume I: Steven Schickâs âA Hard Rainâ is a manifesto of sorts and does for solo percussion music what Sarah Cahill has done for women composers and the Catalyst Quartet is doing for black composers. There are not many recordings of solo percussion music and Maestro Schick essentially presents his favorite works in definitive performances on a label produced by Bang on a Can cellist Maya Beiser. The second volume is in my review queue and, if this first volume is any indication, it will be a landmark survey.\n\nRising Star Seth Parker Woodsâ âDifficult Graceâ is a Classic in the Making. Hereâs another Grammy nominee that did not win but, this second album by this fine American new music cellist is a winner in my book (er, blog). This is actually the audio of what was developed as a staged performance but the music speaks for itself. Keep an eye/ear out for this rising star who, even now, is storming the new music cello scene in invigorating ways.\n\nA Reason to Listen: Roger Reynoldsâ Latest, âFor a Reasonâ,new recordings on Neuma Records. Here we see Neuma following its original electroacoustic mission with this remarkable set in celebration of Roger Reynoldsâs 90th year. This is a lavish 2 CD box set with a beautiful booklet and lucid liner notes. It is a worthy production which showcases recent works by this prolific and important American composer.\n\nReaders of this blog likely are aware of my interest in music that is suppressed and/or neglected so this disc grabbed my attention immediately. Israel does a great job of funding the arts and this can be seen in the proliferation of truly fine performers nurtured by that funding. Less well known are the composers who have flourished in the art healthy politics of this country. Some 50 years of history are represented here. This is but a sampling, albeit finely curated, of several generations of composers displaying a plurality of styles with substantial results. This entertaining disc will whet the appetites of intelligent and curious listeners and, hopefully, bring about more recognition of the world class composers who deserve an audience.\n\nSo, finally, went my 2023.\n\nThere are many ways to debut on the world stage and there are many ways to represent political activism. Violist NoÃ©mie Chemali has chosen, as her important first impression in her recorded debut, a selection of music from young composers whose heritage includes political oppression. The albums profits are promised to MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders. These works are not directly political, rather they are a carefully curated selection of new works produced by composers who, in varying degrees, have experiences of dealing with or having friends and family whose lives are negatively impacted by political conflicts and oppression. This is gorgeous music by emerging talents.\n\nThe good news is that these wonderfully creative artists persevere in creating great art and it is the celebration of that creative drive that lies at the heart of this fine release. While the pieces here variously reference tunings, rhythms, and melodies representative of their individual ethnic heritages, they are not confrontational. Rather the music here stands as evidence of the beauty of artistic invention which stands defiantly in contrast to the cruelty of oppression and warfare. That gentle activism casts a kinder and gentler image of people more commonly represented in the media as terrorists (actually a numerical minority) in a culture with ancient roots and a powerful artistic soul (the better descriptor of the actual majority).\n\nLinks to the composersâ web sites can be accessed by clicking the names of said composers.\n\nThe albumâs contents are as follows:\n\nWajdi Abou Diab (1991- )\n\n1. âThe Morabaâ Danceâ (2020)\n\nThis, the composerâs Opus 13C, is based on an Arabic rhythm called âAl Mourabaâ. It is for solo viola and is cast in the unusual meter of 13/4, using an Arabic scale. The music imitates traditional music which ostensibly enticed horses to dance in times past.\n\nSami Seif (1998- )\n\n2. âLaâib an-nard / The Dice Playerâ (2019)\n\nThis musical impression of a poem of the same name by Mahmoud Darwish. It is, in the composerâs description, a meditation on the random elements that affect our lives. It is scored for viola, cello, and double bass.\n\nLayale Chaker (1990- )\n\n3. Cadenza from âThe Brown Textsâ; movement one (2017-2020)\n\n4. Cadenza from âThe Brown Textsâ;movement two\n\nThe term âcadenzaâ derives from the word âcadenceâ and it generally refers to the improvisations (by the soloist) in a concerto. The notion of a solo cadenza does not appear, as far as this listenerâs encounters, until the mid to late twentieth century. Pendereckiâs Cadenza for Viola is the only example that immediately comes to mind. Though that work is sometimes performed separate from the viola concerto from which it derives, its origin is in the classical/romantic tradition of a virtuoso work that displays the skills of the soloist. As with the previous work, this one is a musical rendition of originally poetic ideas, those of the late Nadia Tueni. And, unlike any other cadenza Iâve known, it is cast in two separate movements. The piece is a fine showcase for Ms. Chemaliâs technical and interpretive skills.\n\nNoemie Chemali:\n\n5. âKadishatâ (2021)\n\nDelightfully, Ms. Chemali has chosen to include one of her own compositions. She describes this as a set of variations on the ancient Aramaic Trisagion âQadishat alohoâ, a tune which has been firmly ensconced in the composer/performerâs consciousness from having heard it since her childhood. One could characterize it as one of the greatest hits of the Eastern Orthodox Church and one of its most deeply felt pieces. Chemali casts this work for violin, viola, and cello. This writer is reminded of another fine example of the incorporation of sacred hymns into the classical music tradition, that of Carolyn Shawâs fine âIn Manus Tuasâ which mines that composerâs memory of hearing a sacred chant. Both works reflect the composerâs internal process of hearing and attempt to convey that spiritual experience to the listener.\n\nMary Kouyoumdjian (1983- ):\n\n6. âThe Revolt of the Starsâ (2018/2020)\n\nThis piece, another musical expression of a literary work, namely, the Armenian fable that provides the title for this work which is cast for cello, voice, and electronics. It is presented here in a transcription for viola by the soloist. The fable deals with the strength in numbers that rise up against those in positions of power. It is a delightful work with dark implications.\n\nSaad Haddad (1992- ):\n\n7. âDohreeâ (movements 1&2)\n\n8. âDohreeâ (movement 3)\n\nThis work, scored for viola, harp, and flute is cleverly written in three movements which, in turn, each give a solo to each of the musicians who are, in turn, accompanied by the others in the group. âDohreeâ is an Arabic word which translates as âmy turnâ.\n\nSix pieces over eight tracks with chamber groups ranging from solo viola to viola with electronics (in the Kouyoumdjian work) and small chamber groupings in the others. All in all a fine and engaging selection of music that bear witness to the beauty and creativity of people living with oppression. This music reflects the human experience that can get erased by merely identifying ethnicity.\n\nIn addition to Ms. Chemali this recording includes the following musicians: Shaleah Feinstein, violin; Raffi Boden, violoncello; Kebra-Seyoun Charles, double bass; Lauren Scanio, flute; Deanna Cirielli, harp. They really do honor to the spirit of this music and this album is beautifully recorded as well.\n\nKouyoumdjian was the only composer known to this reviewer prior to hearing this album but she is apparently in very good company here and listeners would do well to make note of these rising stars. We will doubtless hear from them again. Hereâs hoping.\n\nThis is the artistâs biography as it appears on her website (linked above):\n\nFrench-Lebanese-American violist NoÃ©mie Chemali received her Bachelorâs degree from McGill Universityâs Schulich School of Music, her Artist Diploma from the Robert McDuffie Center for Strings at Mercer University, and her Masterâs Degree from The Juilliard School. Her principal teachers include Becca Albers, Hsin-Yun Huang, and Carol Rodland.\n\nDuring her time at Juilliard, she made her Carnegie Weill Hall solo debut in the UN Chamber Music Societyâs Arabic Language Day concert and collaborated with dancers of the New York City Ballet. During her time at the McDuffie Center for Strings, she performed alongside faculty members of the Cavani and Ehnes String Quartets. In 2019, she also performed in âA Night of Georgia Music,â a tour the American South with violinist Robert McDuffie, guitarist Mike Mills of the band R.E.M., and pianist Chuck Leavell of the Allman Brothers Band/Rolling Stones. Some performance highlights from McGill include playing a concert with clarinetist David Krakauer in a program of Klezmer music, being selected to perform a chamber work by John Rea in a concert presented by the SociÃ©tÃ© de musique contemporaine du QuÃ©bec (SMCQ) alongside Schulich faculty and students, and participating in the 2018 Musical Chairs Chamber Music Festival, where she collaborated with students from the Mozarteum (Austria) and the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music (Singapore).\n\nNoemie has spent her summers at music festivals such as The Music Academy of the West, Sarasota Music Festival, Orford Musique, The Lunenburg Academy of Music Performance (LAMP), Scotia Festival of Music, Manhattan in the Mountains, and Green Mountain music festivals. While Ms. Chemali was a fellow at the Music Academy of the West, she played under the baton of esteemed conductors Larry Rachleff, StÃ©phane DenÃ¨ve, Gustavo Dudamel, and James Conlon. While at Sarasota Music Festival, she served as principal violist of the festival orchestra under the baton of Jeffrey Kahane and performed in a faculty concert as a member of a quintet with bassoonist Frank Morelli. She has, throughout the years, participated in various masterclasses with artists such as Joseph Silverstein, Ida Kavafian, Cynthia Phelps, Karen Dreyfus, Richard OâNeill, James Dunham, Jutta Puchhammer and the Pacifica String Quartet.\n\nPassionate about diversifying musical audiences, she co-founded the Hildegard Project, which aims to bring music written by women composers to womenâs shelters in the greater Montreal area and was invited to speak about her work at the Classical Evolution/Revolution Conference in Santa Barbara, CA. Most recently, she founded Music@Daybreak, an interdisciplinary performance and research project which features performances at homeless shelters in collaboration with the Sociology department at Mercer University.\n\nNoÃ©mie is the recipient of a Juilliard Career Grant, George J. Jakob Global Enrichment Grant, Gluck Community Engagement Fellowship, Juilliard Entrepreneurship Grant, Barenboim-Said Foundation (USA) Grant, and a Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Creative Engagement Grant. In January 2024, she will be releasing Opus 961, her debut album of music written by contemporary Lebanese composers.\n\nHer website includes some YouTube videos reflecting the artistâs fascinating choices of repertory. Along with fervent activism, she demonstrates a pretty unique take on what she chooses to play. Her biography evidences an eclectic group of collaborators and influences that will likely characterize her career.\n\nThis is quite an impressive first impression from an artist who greets us at the beginnings of what this reviewer believes will be a long and interesting career representing a new generation of musicians with a unique and (hopefully more effective) approach to the ills of our age. Great art inspires, if not action, at least hope. And we desperately need hope. Thanks for that Ms. Chemali.\n\nEvery solo artist, regardless of what instrument they play seeks to define themselves. Generally that means setting limits. Some set limits by specializing in an era (baroque, classical, etc.). Some specialize in working with electronics, some with jazz, some with experimental music, some with standard recital repertoire, etc. Seth Parker Woods (1984- ) seems almost unaware of such limits. He plays what he chooses. And, oh, what choices. From standard classics to the leading edge of musical creativity woods is poised at the beginning of a very promising career.\n\nThis album is in fact the musical portions of what was produced as a staged presentation with Woods playing, singing, talking. No doubt something is lost without the staging but Woodsâ asserts himself with great clarity on the sonic aspect alone. Think of this as a sort of cast album, though it is more than just a souvenir. It is Woodsâ second album and it has this writer enthralled at where he may go next. You will be too.\n\nI feel privileged to have known this artist via digital media and to have watched with increasing interest his development as a true rising star in the new music world. I only recently acquired his first album via bandcamp. It was released âacross the pondâ when he was completing his Ph.D. at the University of Huddersfield.\n\nBorn in Houston, his father, a jazz and gospel singer, Woods was exposed to a great deal of music. He rehearsed in a home studio and somehow came to a fascination and deep appreciation for a wide variety of repertory.\n\nHis affiliations continue to be wide ranging from Peter Gabriel to George Lewis. He has appeared on many recordings but this is only the second disc dedicated entirely to Woods as performer and the first such solo efforts on a US label. Woods is apparently able and willing to tackle music of all eras and genres including the wildly experimental, like his âIce Celloâ homage to Charlotte Moorman and the theatrical, which brings to the the album at hand.\n\nFour of the seven works presented are world premieres. And, despite this being a sort of âcast albumâ which lacks the visuals, this is a major release that presents a characteristic variety of musical choices and is a fine calling card for the artist. This is one classy production.\n\nHe begins with the title track, âDifficult Graceâ by Chicago based composer Frederic Gifford (1972- ). It is a setting of poetry by Dudley Randall subjected to some Cageian mesostic like manipulation. This first track tells us we are dealing with modern music and sort of sets the tone of this project. This is a complex work in concept (lucidly described in the composerâs notes) and involves projections of the texts onto the performer as well as electronics which, by careful use of both the sounds and the spoken text (spoken by the cellist) which then contributes to the musical structure. Photographs in the booklet show some of the striking visual design for this project.\n\nWoods follows with what is to this listener a stunningly beautiful piece, âCalvary Ostinatoâ (1973) by the late, sadly neglected Coleridge Taylor Perkinson (1932-2004), a black American composer (actually represented admirably in a fine earlier Cedille release CDR 90000 087). The Ostinato is one movement from Perkinsonâs âLamentations: Black/Folk Song Suite For Solo Celloâ (1973). Woodsâ performance is available on YouTube. Itâs truly enthralling. One gets the feeling that Woods really gets inside the music he performs and that deep feel for the music is delightfully obvious in this track, the second oldest work on the disc and one that is for the solo cello sans electronics or vocals but using a dazzling variety of extended instrumental techniques, none involving a bow.\n\nThen we hear Monty Adkinsâ (y. 1972- ) âWinter Tendrilsâ (2019) written for cellist who, in addition to playing his instrument, is asked to use his voice and work with electronics, albeit in a different manner than the title track. Adkins worked closely with Woods on the creation of this work. The work essentially an impressionistic piece with clever use of counterpoint to depict fresh fallen snow on the branches of a tree.\n\nNathalie Joachim (1983- ), a Haitian-American vocalist, flautist, and composer, is represented by two works. The first, âThe Race 1915â (2019), a work that contributes to the Chicago centered Cedille label by its use of historical quotations from The Defender, a major and influential black newspaper in Chicago. Woods is again asked to use his vocal skills in this work which celebrates efforts to undo social inequalities.\n\nThe multitalented Joachim lends her vocal skills to Woodsâ performance in Joachimâs second piece on the album, âDam Men Yoâ (2017). The title is Haitian Creole for âthey are my ladiesâ. It is a sort of black feminist peaen celebrating the strength of the women with whom the composer was raised in her native Haiti. (NB: Haiti is the site of the only successful slave revolt in history, a fact that continues to be reflected in their turbulent politics).\n\nIn between those two pieces we get to hear perhaps the best known composer in this mix, Alvin Singleton (1940- ). Singleton is represented by âArgoru IIâ (1970) for solo cello (the Argoru series is a set of pieces for solo instruments akin to Luciano Berioâs âSequenzaâ series). The title is from the Twi language (spoken in Ghana) and translates as âto playâ. It is a virtuosic piece employing extended instrumental techniques which Woods accomplishes with almost supernatural ease. He does honor to this living elder statesman of American music.\n\nAnd here we are back in Chicago now with Maestro Woodsâ performance of a work by Chicago born composer Ted Hearne (1982- ), a name which did make it to this writerâs musical radar but one whose work I have just begun to explore. But this is a fine example of one of the reasons for my admiration for Woodsâ scope of musical interest. I think he is one of those artists to whom I will turn to look for good new music. His instincts for repertory choices are amazing.\n\nThis is perhaps the most unusual entry on this disc as well as one that, if any controversy is forthcoming, it will likely originate with this set of songs to poetry by Keri Alabi. A casual listen to some of Hearneâs music on YouTube suggests a sort of post minimalist ethic but this last work is not discernibly minimal. Like the music that preceded it, this cycle is overtly about politics and equality.\n\nHearneâs little 6 movement song cycle is a combination of poetry, electronics, cello (of course), and the voice of said cellist. Hearneâs expletive title, âfree fuckedâ, is apparently very much in line with the composerâs assertive and playfully humorous style.\n\nWe return in these tracks to the avant garde and complex with which the album opened. Again we have a multitasking role for the cellist demanding his vocal participation and working in a distinctly electroacoustic genre. Hearne lends his voice to the final track of this unusual work.\n\nWhile political themes and references abound in this release it is as much about black politics and civil rights as well as feminist, gender, and global equality issues. But ultimately this recording is a landmark in the career of this fine young musician who works fearlessly with a variety of composers, poets, designers, political activists, progressive ideas, and new music in general.\n\nCedille is one of my top favorite new music record labels and has been since they first started in 1987. Their releases (not limited to new music) are consistently well recorded and produced but producer James Ginsburg really pulls out all the stops on this one. From concept to recording, from lucid liner notes to gorgeous package design this has all the marks of a classic and collectible release. I mean, the music is great, but the whole package is something youâll want to own. Thatâs right, Iâm calling for âcollectorâs itemâ status here. Now is the time to get your copy.\n\nAaron Jay Myersâ third album grabbed my attention immediately and didnât let go til the album ended. Working un-self consciously in a stunning plurality of styles (this guy clearly paid attention to his 20th century music history classes) he has produced some mighty substantial works. His ability to integrate a wide variety of techniques and styles into his artistic persona is simply astounding. His references to other composersâ works, rather than sounding derivative, evoke nostalgic homage, at least in this listeners ears. Indeed there seem to be more references per square inch than in a Thomas Pynchon novel. And the fact that he shares this writerâs passion for Star Trek, Deep Space Nine only endeared him more to me (more on that later).\n\nHis very listenable music seemingly embraces the whole of the twentieth century stylistically and his very judicious use of extended techniques for pretty much all instruments including voice demonstrate a firm understanding of where those techniques best serve his artistic vision. Fortunately he has managed to find performers who both meet his technical demands and have a real grasp of his musical vision. This Neuma release is truly something special.\n\nThere are six works divided among the thirteen tracks. These chamber works were written between 2011 and 2021. None require more than ten minutes or so of your time and left this listener satisfied with the music and optimistic for the future of classical music in general.\n\nâSave One Life, You Save the World Entireâ (2017) for the unusual combination of flute and baritone saxophone opens this album with a surprisingly engaging work. It sounds like a challenge for the musicians who handle those challenges seamlessly and engage the listener in this rather brief essay.\n\nWhen I listen to âLate Night Banterâ (2011 rev. 2015) now, I do so in bare feet (it knocks my socks off). This piece for ten musicians with a conductor is a finely crafted piece that grabbed this listenerâs attention by that craftsmanship but also by what seem to be a plethora of sonic references to 20th century music. The style of Stravinsky, an homage to Luciano Berio, etc. These brief references evoked emotional responses which led me to recall similar emotions I had attached to the apparent (at least to me) object of said reference. Even minimalist references occur matter of factly. Such efforts can sound derivative or at least imitative but not so in this piece. Rather it had the quality of a tour of the twentieth century in respectful jogs of memory. But even if you donât get the references, this is a substantial and entertaining work. The evanescence of those references had me questioning whether they were actually there or just my mental figment. (I guess Iâll just have to listen again). Either way I was thrillingly engaged.\n\nâYou Get On My Nerves, And I Donât Like Your Hatâ (2020) is the Deep Space Nine reference mentioned at the beginning of this review. If you havenât seen this series I highly recommend it. And so, apparently, does Aaron Michael Myers. This work for vocal quartet (SATB) takes its title from a witty utterance by Captain Sisko (my fave Star Trek Captain). Of course you donât have to know Star Trek lore to appreciate this work, but it helps. It is a challenging work for four unaccompanied soloists which reflects the composerâs sense of humor as well as his connection to pop culture.\n\nâLichens IIIâ (2018) is scored for soprano voice but the singer also does the work of a percussionist. In addition to the vocal challenges the singer is asked to perform on âbody percussionâ, the various sounds one can make by percussing (pounding) on oneâs body. It is more commonly an idiom of folk and blues but soloist Stephanie Lamprea handles both the singing and the percussing as though it is her everyday practice accomplished with ease.\n\nClairsentience (2016) is another wind instrument duo, this time for clarinet and alto saxophone, a similarly unusual choice of instruments. This one is about twice the duration of that first piece and every bit as engaging as well as challenging.\n\nThe last track is a marvel of multitasking. Other than Aaron Trant (who does a fine job) on drums, all of the parts (three electric guitars, and bass) are handled by the composer. âPerception Stains Realityâ (2002) is a tour de force consistent with the other works on this disc. Here he shows his rock/pop sensibilities, clearly as essential a part of his artistic endeavors as his âclassicalâ training.\n\nMyers is one to put on your hot list. He is certainly on mine. If you can hear a performance of his work, whether live or recorded, you would do well to check it out.\n\nThis is the third volume in the Catalyst Quartetâs wonderful and insightful survey of neglected works by black composers. The first focused on music by the black English composer Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1875-1912), the second on music of late nineteenth to mid-twentieth century American composer Florence Price (1887-1953). The present disc focuses on the works of three men whose musical careers were entirely in the twentieth century: William Grant Still (1895-1978), George Walker (1922-2018), and Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson (1932-2004).\n\nWilliam Grant Still is roughly contemporary with Aaron Copland (1900-1990). Copland has often been called the âDean of American Composersâ and Still has been called the âDean of Afro-American Composersâ. Such honorifics, while well intended, do nothing to describe the true depth and significance of either of these composers.\n\nSimilarly their best known works, Coplandâs âAppalachian Springâ (1944), and Stillâs âAfro-American Symphonyâ (1930) are fine pieces of music but cannot represent the whole of their respective authorsâ outputs. Both produced quite a bit of music and went through stylistic changes as their artistic sensibilities evolved. Coplandâs oeuvre is pretty well documented, allowing listeners to grasp its entirety while Stillâs work has not enjoyed the same distinction. That is changing, slowly, and that is reason to celebrate.\n\nStill is represented here by his âLyric Quartetteâ (published in 1960 but likely written 1939-1945). These three movements for string quartet are intended to represent a plantation, the mountains of Peru, and a pioneer settlement, respectively. This appears to be the first commercial recording of the work, a set of vignettes (Still never wrote a string quartet as such) seemingly published as an afterthought after looking back over his files. Thatâs not to denigrate the music. It is finely crafted and reflects a composer closer to the folk eclecticism of his contemporaries William L. Dawson (1899-1980) whose use of folk idioms resembles that of Aaron Copland (1900-1990) and Virgil Thomson (1896-1989), two white contemporaries (rather than his later more post romantic style). These composersâ use of folk idioms and the comforting tonal harmonies, very much in vogue when the music was first written, sound rather old fashioned in their year of the Lyric Quartetteâs publication. Nonetheless, it is a vital work in understanding Still and his development as a composer. This would make for a great encore or second selection following a Haydn or Mozart Quartet.\n\nGeorge Walker was a sought after concert pianist and he forever holds the distinction of being the first Black American to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize in music (for his 1996 âLilacsâ for voice and orchestra). I learned from one of my personal favorite Chicago broadcasters that he, Bruce Duffie (WNIB host 1975-2001) played Walkerâs âLyric for Stringsâ (1946, orch. 1990) as the final sign off music at the closing of the beloved independent station (reportedly very satisfying to that terminal audience). The link provided is to a transcript of his subsequent conversation he had with Walker in 2001, worth your time to read.\n\nSo what does all this have to do with this release? Well, that, âLyric for stringsâ is actually Walkerâs orchestration for string orchestra of the second movement, âmolto adagioâ of his three movement String Quartet No.1 (1946) âLyricâ. Samuel Barber garnered a great audience with his âAdagio for Stringsâ from the molto adagio of his String Quartet (1935-36).\n\nThe outer movements (1 and 3) of Walkerâs quartet (carefully conceived and thoughtfully developed at length) frame the beautiful adagio with a passionate elaborately developed allegro and a high energy, virtuosic finale (much as in the Barber work). The quartetâs title, derived from the slow movement which was originally titled âlamentâ is dedicated to Walkerâs grandmother, a former slave. A very different perspective of America, for sure, but a truly spectacular example of string quartet writing.\n\nI wrote my review in chronological order to clarify my narrative but the actual track order is:\n\nString Quartet No. 1 âCalvaryâ Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson (1932-2004)\n\nAllegro\n\nAdagio\n\nAllegro vivace\n\nLyric Quartet William Grant Still (1895-1978)\n\nThe Sentimental One\n\nThe Quiet One\n\nThe Jovial One\n\nString Quartet No. 1 âLyricâ George Walker (1922-2018)\n\nAllegro\n\nMolto adagio\n\nAllegro con fuoco\n\nSo String Quartet No. 1 âCalvaryâ (1956) by Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson is leaving the most recent for last. This work, shares with the other two itâs having been written fairly early in the composerâs career (he was about 24 when he wrote this piece, Still was in his 40s and Walker about 24 when they wrote their respective quartets). So Catalyst adheres to these important but early utterances from these three important artists. And for clarity the name permutations we encounter here comprise: Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) is the English poet, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875-1912) is the black English composer honorifically named after that poet, and Coleridge Taylor Perkinson (1932-2004) the black American composer honorifically named in honor of said English composer.\n\nThis is another outstanding but neglected American composer who happens to be black. This fine string quartet is defined by its serious tone and elaborate development in a passionate romantic tonal idiom. Of course the composer shares his prominent jazz (Perkins was nothing if not eclectic) influences in rhythms and harmonic structure. Based loosely on the hymn, âCalvaryâ from which it takes its name, it was actually premiered in Carnegie Hall as part of a memorial for composer and baritone Harry T. Burleigh (1866-1949). The opening allegro is a searching and unsettling matter followed by a calming slow movement characterized by an incessant pizzicato repeating figure. The finale, a touch more hopeful sounds almost improvisatory at times much in the manner of some jazz forms. Truly another outstanding example of good string quartet writing. This is powerful music!\n\nThese recordings are both beautifully done and, arguably, definitive in their interpretation of these delightful and essential additions to the quartet literature. The Catalyst does a fine and honorable job in their ongoing mission to reclaim forgotten gems such as these for present and future listeners. Thank you for that. Please keep working on this body of work lest it be lost to history.\n\nLet me start with a positive image from a brief photography trip which I managed this year. It was one of the highlights of what has been a difficult year for many of us. Weather, politics, COVID, itinerant employment issues, financial, and personal difficulties were an encumbrance but now stand in relief to the many positive aspects of 2022.\n\nFirst, let me say that nothing musical fell into the category of âworst ofâ so fear not, what follows is essentially my âbest ofâ from 2022. In my head I blame the aforementioned encumbrances for delays and sheer lack of production on my part. Whether that is the ultimate truth does not matter really so here, for better or worse, is my celebration of the positive experiences enumerated in this music blog in 2022.\n\nMy first post for the year struck a sad note. It was my personal tribute to a composer, A Belated Fan Letter: Homage to George Crumb described George Crumb, who had been one of my âgateway drugsâ, so to speak, which helped put me on the exciting roads of new music upon with I continue to travel with great joy. Recordings of his complete works are still being released on the visionary Bridge Records.\n\nCarolyn Shawâs striking and much performed âIn Manus Tuasâ (on solo viola as well as solo cello) was originally written for Collins. Her selections on this album, including that Shaw work, suggest to this writer/listener that she has both vision and an encyclopedic knowledge of music, especially that written for her instrument. She will be among the major shapers of this repertoire via her vision as well as her interpretive talents. And Sono Luminusâ superb sonics certainly helps make this a great release.\n\nI have followed the work of Sarah Cahill since her first solo CD (music of Ravel). Like Collins, she has been an artist who, by her intelligent selection of repertoire, serves as a guide to listeners (and musicians) as well. She has championed many composers as a pianist and as a broadcaster on her weekly KALW broadcasts. Her curation of concerts throughout the Bay Area, such as her solstice concerts at Oaklandâs Chapel of the Chimes, have showcased a large variety of creative performers.\n\nAs she focuses her lens on women composers (neglected is implied) she embraces a stunning range of styles from the baroque era to the present and it seems as though she can play anything she chooses well. She is also collaborative with an amazing ability to discern the substance in the works she chooses to play. And she has discovered (or rescued?) much music from obscurity via scholarship and intelligent collaboration. Canât wait for the next release. She is consistently interesting and relevant.\n\nThis album was sent to me by a friend. I knew the Ligeti pieces but heard them with new ears in this release and I was amazed by the Kodaly works too. Marcus Creed may not be as well known in the U.S. as he is across the pond but he should be.\n\nThis album was kindly sent to me for review by John Schneider of Microfest records. Read the review. Listen to this album. And watch for more from Chris Votek, another rising star in 2022.\n\nDan Lippel is one of the founders of the fabulous new music label, New Focus Recordings. Here he is acoustic, electric, conventional, and experimental but always interesting. Keep his name on your radar.\n\nThis is a gorgeously designed, very collectible art object. It is a beautiful hard cover, full color book which also contains a CD of a recording (from acetate masters) which had languished in the archives of the Eastman/Rochester Music School where Harry Partch gave this lucid lecture/performance in 1942. Mr. Schneider, who sent me the Votek release as well, fronts an ensemble called PARTCH which, in addition to performing Harry Partch âs work, is recording Partchâs complete works for David and Becky Starobinâs Bridge label. This one is both eye and ear candy to my ears.\n\nRescuing those acetate masters from obscurity is a major find that rises in significance (in the musical sense) almost to the level of the archeological discovery of Tutâs Tomb. Schneider is a musician, a composer, a radio broadcaster, and an archivist and now a sonic archeologist I suppose. He also sports a collection of authentic copies of Partchâs curious instruments which were built to play the microtonal scales required. Partch is a major American composer whose work is now gaining its rightful place among the best of American classical music.\n\nI first discovered Mr. Susmanâs work when I was asked to review a performance of another composerâs work. I heard one of his works played by the remarkable San Jose Chamber Orchestra on that same concert. Here we have another multi volume release of these lovely and significant piano works. The remarkable pianist (mentioned often in these pages) has contracted to record all 4 books of this sort of âWell Tempered Clavierâ type gesture which effectively provides much insight to this composer. Nicolas Horvath, known for marathon concerts performing (and subsequently recording) all of Philip Glassâ piano music, among others. (Weâre talking 15 hours or so. There is also a 35 hour live rendition of Erik Satieâs âVexationsâ on you tube.) Who better to record these? The remaining three volumes are due some time this year. Who better to take on this post minimalist set of pieces? Canât wait for the next volume.\n\nYolanda Kondonassis is about as household a name that you can find among harpists. These five minute (more or less) pieces are a significant addition to the solo harp repertoire. They are forward looking works for her instrument. Very interesting work, excellently performed.\n\nI remain in awe at the curatorial and historically aware work of this truly fine pianist. Greenberg helped me grasp the historical context of the Second Viennese School in a new way with his earlier release âBook of the Hanging Gardensâ. In that release he played all the Debussy Preludes along with Schoenbergâs pre twelve tone song cycle, Webernâs Variations, and the Berg Sonata which helped this listener to better grasp the historical context of this music. This small collection of works written for him reflects a collaborative and visionary ethic akin to that of Sarah Cahillâs. Keep an ear out for this guy.\n\nI have received some good natured teasing about the fact that this, one of my longer reviews, is of a 15 minute piece of music. But this act of musical archeology by the bay areaâs Kate Stenberg (who is a regular collaborator with Sarah Cahill BTW) has made the first recording of this little work. Itâs Webernian duration belies a style very much in character with this beloved composerâs other work. My review was as much about the music and the recording as it was about the dedication of Stenberg to new music. This release is from Other Minds, another shining example of advocacy of new music and collaboration among composers and performers. Get it. Listen to it. And donât miss a chance to hear Stenberg live performances or to hear anything Harrison has written.\n\nThe Chicago based Cedille label is one of my favorite classical music labels. Producer James Ginsburg has a golden ear and Cedille is the finest Chicago based classical label since the justly fabled Mercury records. All their releases deserve attention but this two disc set of little known works for String Trio written between the world wars is a feast of substantive, if slightly conservative, voices. This one is a great listen and, trust me, none of this music is in your collection.\n\nWhile circumstances conspired to limit my attendance to only one of the three days of OM 26, I would be loathe to leave this world class music festival off my âbest ofâ list. My first published blog of 2023 was of the 30th anniversary celebration which showcased Marc-Andre Hamelinâs stunning reading of Charles Ivesâ massive Concord Sonata. Anything OM does deserves your attention but the roughly annual festival continues to present composers and performers from around the world. Not to be missed.\n\nAnother exciting release of Cahillâs visionary series. Like the previous volume (and the aforementioned Cedille release) the consumer will suffer no unnecessary duplications if the music herein. Fascinating and expertly done. This set (the third volume due this year) is a testament to Cahillâs encyclopedic knowledge of piano music as well as her collaborative nature and, of course, her skills as a pianist.\n\nIâm cheating a bit here since I wasnât able to complete my review until 2023 but this Starkland disc was released in 2022 and definitely earns its place in my âbest ofâ list. This rising star is another one to watch. Starkland, run by the dynamic Tom Steenland is one of those labels that reliably finds interesting and substantive new music. This one is no exception. It goes a long way to alleviating my skepticism of the electroacoustic genre.\n\nAnd, in order to be fair I must cheat equitably. Charles Amirkhanian kindly sent me this exciting and excellent DVD of his collaboration with his partner in life and in artistic crimes, Carol Law. My more extensive review will appear shortly but this was a major release in 2022. Amirkhanian spends far less time promoting and performing his own unique compositions so this is an especially welcome release.\n\nLast but not least of my best of 2022 is this wonderful Neuma release which, when I began my research to write a cogent and informed review, left me stunned at how little I actually knew about composer David Tudor and the astounding dimensions of this unusual piece that evolves with every performance. After gathering a whole ton of data I finally decided that I could not write a comprehensive review without more research so I settled on a tasteful (I hope) summary with the expectation that I will write a larger piece on Tudor and his work. The review will be out very shortly. This is an amazing and significant release.\n\nHappy 2023 to all my readers and thanks to those who kept reading my blog during more fallow times. I have many blogs currently in preparation that I look forward to sharing in the months to come. Peace, health, and music to all.\n\nThe fanciful subtitle of this release, âThe Danceâ is a follow up to the first volume titled, âIn Natureâ (a third volume titled, âAt Playâ is due out in March, 2023). These vague titles are fanciful and more connotative than specific. They seem to reflect the nature of the project and the nature of Sarah Cahillâs style of conceptualizing what must be an overwhelming undertaking, Beginning with the simple concept of female composers (the term âneglectedâ would be redundant here) Cahill has produced a sweeping survey ranging from the baroque era (the earliest piece so far in this anthology is from 1687) to the present and her survey seems to know few geographical boundaries in this representative survey of keyboard music. Of course we are talking about basically the paradigm of western classical music but non-western influences are of course included via the composersâ individual talents. Many of these works were presented in Cahillâs fine YouTube series which can give listeners further clues to the pianistâs varied interests.\n\nThe cover art (which I had described as âdrabâ in the first review) now seems to aptly reflect the struggle for equality and now nicely represents this project in an iconic way with the same monochrome cover photo on each of the three volumes and a primary color panel with the disc title. Green for Volume I, Yellow for Volume II (Iâm guessing âredâ for Vol III?). This survey is shaping up to be an influential as well as hugely entertaining anthology.\n\nWhat struck this listener is Cahillâs facility with both technique and interpretation of a mighty diverse set of pieces. Known primarily for her work with music written after 1950, she demonstrates in these recordings an impressive command of baroque, classical, romantic, and modern idioms. I have never heard her play Bach but I wouldnât miss an opportunity to hear her do the Goldberg Variations.\n\nThis was particularly striking in her reading of the keyboard suite that opens this release. This is apparently not the first recording of Elisabeth JACQUET DE LA GUERREâs (1665-1729) Suite no. 1 in d minor (the complete suites for harpsichord were recorded by harpsichordist Carol Cerasi in 1998) but Cahill seems to channel the spirits of the pioneering efforts of Wanda Landowska and Rosalyn Tureck whose abilities to play harpsichord music effectively on the modern piano helped set the standard for this practice in the twentieth century and beyond. This late French baroque suite is a thoroughly engaging way to draw the listener in. With echoes of Bach and Couperin this virtually unknown composer is seriously engaging and substantive. This recording includes five (of nine) movements of the suite. One hopes to hear more of this womanâs music and Cahill is very much up to the task of providing a definitive performance.\n\nWith the next track we hear the music of Clara SCHUMANN (1819-1896), better known as the wife of Robert Schumann (1810-1856). Clara was in fact a highly accomplished virtuoso and composer whose works are only now getting the recognition they deserve. The piece chosen here is her Variations on a Theme of Robert Schumann Op. 20. These seven variations were a gift for her husband on his 43rd birthday in 1853. Sadly it was to be the last birthday he would celebrate with his family. Robert Schumann was infamously institutionalized in 1854 and died in 1856. The work has all the splendor of high romanticism with the virtuosity associated with the great composer/pianists (Brahms, Schumann, Liszt, Rubinstein, et al). And, as with the previous piece, Cahill seems very at home in her reading of this wonderful set of variations.\n\nGermaine TAILLEFERE (1892-1983) is next up with her three movement partita of 1957. The title âPartitaâ suggests a connection with the baroque suite which opens this collection. The connection is one of form, not harmony or melody. The three movements here are âPerpetuum Mobileâ, âNotturnoâ, and âAllegramenteâ. Taillefere, who is perhaps best known for her lively Harp Concertino of 1927, was the only female member of Franceâs celebrated âLes Sixâ (the other members were, Louis Durey, Georges Auric, Arthur Honneger, Darius Milhaud, and Francis Poulenc). This largely neoclassical group of composers developed their styles in the shadow of Debussy and Ravel. Cahillâs first album was a fine reading of Ravelâs piano music and she is very much in her element with this delightful three movement work which echoes Ravel to some degree,\n\nZenobia POWELL PERRY (1908-2004) is the first composer in this collection to be born in the twentieth century. She was a black composer/conductor/pianist and teacher. Her work appeared before in this blog in coverage of her opera âTarawa Houseâ which was given a revival in Modesto, CA in 2014. Her âRhapsodyâ (1960) is in a sort of Neo-romantic style with some challenging virtuosity required. This is a fine introduction to her work which deserves serious reassessment and more performances. Musicologist Jeannie Gayle Pool continues to publish, preserve, and advocate for this neglected American artist. Pool maintains the website for this composer and is a useful, informative site,\n\nMadeleine DRING (1923-1977), a British composer/pianist, a new name to this writer, is characterized by her use of popular and jazz idioms. Cahill here plays two (of five) movements of her âColor Suiteâ (1963). This whets the listenerâs appetite for more of this interesting composer whose work was well known during her career but whose star has dimmed since her passing. Dring is one of many women composers of that era whose work, though influential, has not been incorporated into the repertory of contemporary classical musicians.\n\nBetsy JOLAS (1926- ), a French born American composer whose career has included work as a composer, pianist, and teacher. No stranger to the Bay Area, Jolas taught at UC Berkeley and Mills College as well as Harvard and Yale. The listener accessible nature of her music belies the innovation and complexities it contains. Though she has been recognized throughout her career her work is due for a new reckoning. Her brief âTango Siâ (1984) is entertaining and sufficiently compelling to spark interest in her work going forward.\n\nElena KATS-CHERNIN (1957- ) hails from Uzbekistan and migrated to Australia where she studied at the New South Wales Conservatorium and subsequently with Helmut Lachenmann in Germany. Kats-Chernin has been a prolific composer and is now perhaps mid-career and, happily, pretty well known. âPeggyâs Ragâ (1996) is one of a set of several rags written between 1995 and 1999. This work is dedicated to Australian composer Peggy Glanville-Hicks (1912-1990), another artist, another female composer deserving of a revival.\n\nMeredith MONK (1942- ) has long been one of this reviewerâs favorite âdowntownâ composers whose initial musical ventures were first heard in her New York SOHO loft. She, along with other rising stars, including Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Phill Klein, Rhys Chatham, etc., are now the historically recognized mavericks whoâs creative ideas formed in contrast to the power elite of the âuptownâ composers heard commonly at Lincoln Center.\n\nMonk was initially trained as a dancer and that has been evident in most of her output. But she is perhaps best known for her exploration of extended vocal techniques (which she also teaches). It is fitting that her âSt. Petersburg Waltzâ (1997) is included in this dance themed installment of music by women composers. Despite being an âeast coastâ composer initially, Monk has achieved international recognition and has a particularly large following in the Bay Area. No surprise then that our pianist guide in this journey has a long standing familiarity with Monkâs work. Cahill demonstrates her grasp of Monkâs minimalist inflected style most admirably and, as in the preceding tracks, leaves the listener wanting more.\n\nGabriela ORTIZ (1964) is a Mexican composer. Born in Mexico, trained in England, and now teaching in Mexico. Her light shines brightly even in the glare of the heavily politicized immigration issues that dominate the media and is another in a long line of world class composers from that underrated country. Ortiz, in addition to her academic appointments, has produced a large number of works in multiple formats from piano and chamber music, to orchestral, dance, and opera. Her work draws in part on the folk music traditions she absorbed in her childhood and she has amassed a significant number of international commissions and recordings.\n\nOrtiz is also an accomplished pianist and the work chosen here is âPreludio y Estudio No. 3â³(2011), one of four two part compositions. Cahillâs brief but useful notes provide the listener with her personal insights to the underlying complexities that drive this music. The incorporation of folk and non-classical elements has been embraced by composers for hundreds of years and Ortiz succeeds in incorporating such elements into her personal style,. As with all of these works, Cahill produces interpretations that, if not absolutely definitive (there are always detractors) stand as a challenge to subsequent interpreters, a necessary element in such a grand project.\n\nThis volume ends with the most recently composed work by the youngest composer of the lot, Theresa WONG (1976- ). Wong, a graduate of Mills College, is cherished performer in the Bay Area and beyond, As both composer and performer she has maintained an active schedule and has produced a great deal of music documented in a large and growing discography. Her collaborations have included many of the established Bay Area artistic royalty (including Ms. Cahill, of course).\n\nâShe Dances Naked Under the Palm Treesâ (2019) is a composition for which the backstory (provided in Cahillâs notes) is particularly useful for the listener. It is the incorporation of extramusical ideas and musical. quotation that drive the drama here to some extent.. The music certainly stands on its own but the addition of the technical insights will send the listener back for repeated hearings and the music will guide the listener to seek more of the work of this wonderful artist whose star continues to rise.\n\nThe last disc in this landmark anthology (due next year) will ultimately contain only a portion of the approximately 70 pieces which Cahill has chosen. Like her previous anthology (of politically influenced music) âA Sweeter Musicâ released in 2013, the limitations of time and money prevent a more complete vision of said anthologist but there is more than enough to provoke further interest by listeners and artists and isnât that the point?\n\nWere it not for the wishes of some of my valued readers I would not produce such a list. It has no more validity other than, âThese are my personal choicesâ. But there is some joy to be had in contemplating these past 12 months as I have lived them on this blog. So here goes.\n\nFirst I have to tell everyone that March, 2022 will mark the 10th anniversary of this blog, a venture which has been a rich and exciting one. Future blogs will soon include, in addition to album/concert reviews, some articles on subjects which I hope will be of interest to the select group of people who read this material and who share my interest in this music (which I know can be anywhere from difficult to repulsive to many ears). But I have deduced that my readers are my community, a community of kindred spirits freed from the boundaries of geography, a number rather larger than I had imagined was possible and one that Iâve come to cherish. Bravo to all of you out there.\n\nCOVID 19 has reduced the number of live performances worldwide and I have not attended a live performance since early 2020. But, happily, musicians have continued to produce some amazing work, some of which gets sent to me, and a portion of that gets to be subjected to the analytic scrutiny of my blog.\n\nMy lack of attention to any music should never be construed as deprecatory, rather it is simply a matter of limited time to listen. So if I have provided a modicum of understanding or even just alerted someone to something new I am pleased and if ever I have offended, I apologize. All this is my personal celebration of art which has enhanced my spirit and which I want to share with others. Look what Ive found!!!\n\nSo, to the task at hand (the âbest ofâ part):\n\nThe formula Iâve developed to generate this âfavorites retrospectiveâ has been to utilize WordPressâ useful statistics and look at the top viewed posts. From these most visited (and presumably most read) articles I produce a list of ten or so of my greatest hits from there. Please note that there are posts which have had and continue to have a fairly large readership from previous years and theyâre not necessarily the ones I might have expected but the stats demand their inclusion here.\n\nFollowing that I then toss in a few which are my personal faves (please read them) to produce what I hope is a reasonably cogent and readable list. Following my own description of my guiding principles I endeavor to present the perspective of person whose day job and energies are spent in decidedly non-musical efforts but whose interest and passion for new music drives this blog where I share those interests.\n\nAs a largely self taught writer (and sometime composer) I qualify my opinions as being those of an educated listener whose allegiances are to what I perceive as pleasing and artistically ideal based on my personal perception of the composerâs/performerâs intent. I am not a voting member for the Grammys and I receive no compensation for favorable reviews. I have the hope/belief that my blogs will ultimately garner a few more listens or performances of art that I hope brings my readers at least some of the joy I feel.\n\nNew Music Buffâs Best of 2021\n\nAs of this writing I have published 37 blog posts in 2021. COVID, job and personal stressors have resulted in my failing to post at all in December, 2020, January, June, and July of 2021. And only one post in February, 2021. Surprisingly I have managed to get just over 9300 views so far this year (a little more views than last year actually) and it is my plan to publish 4-5 blogs per month going forward into my tenth year.\n\nNot surprisingly, most of my readers are from the United States but Iâm pleased to say that Iâve had hits from 192 countries at last count. Thanks to all my readers, apologies to the many countries who didnât make the cut this year (youâre all welcome to try again in 2022). So, following the United States here are the subsequent top 25 countries who have viewed the blog:\n\nCanada, United Kingdom, Germany, China, France, Netherlands, Spain, Australia, Ireland, India, Italy, Turkey, Nigeria, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Poland, Philippines, Ghana, Norway.\n\nTop Ten Most Read of 2021\n\nThe following are the most seen articles of 2021. Some of these are articles whose popularity surprise me as they were written some time ago and are not necessarily, in my opinion, my best work. But readership is readership and I am grateful for that.\n\nTop article, Linda Twine, a Musician You Should Know. Twine is a musician and composer who has worked for some years in New York theater. I chose to profile her and I guess she is well liked because this article from 2018 is one of my top performers. Kudos, Ms. Twine.\n\nNext up is, The Three Black Countertenors, an article suggested by my friend Bill Doggett whose website is a must visit for anyone interested in black classical musicians. This one, from 2014, continues to find readers. It is about the first time three black countertenors appeared on the same stage. Countertenors are themselves a vocal minority when considered in the company of sopranos, baritones, tenors, contraltos, and basses. Being black adds another level of minority in the world of operatic voices so this was indeed historic.\n\nArt and the Reclamation of History is the first of the articles written this year to make the top ten most read. It is about a fabulous album and I hope more people read about it. This Detroit based reed quintet is doing something truly innovative. You really need to hear this.\n\nNumber four is another from this past year, Kinga Augustyn Tackles the Moderns. This album, kindly sent to me by the artist is worth your time if you like modern music. This young Polish/American violinist has both technique and vision. She is definitely an artist to watch.\n\nNumber five is a truly fabulous album from Cedille records, David Schrader Plays Sowerby and Ferko. This double CD just fires on all cylinders, a fine artist, excellent recording, interesting and engaging repertoire, amazing photography, excellent liner notes, and love for all things Chicago. This one is a major classic release.\n\nThe Jack Quartet Plays Cenk Ergun was a pleasant surprise to this blogger. The Jack Quartet has chosen wisely in deciding to release this recording of new string quartet music by this young Turkish composer of serious substance. Iâm glad that many folks read it.\n\nNumber seven on this years hit list among my readers is another album sent directly to me by the artist, one whose work I had reviewed before.\n\nCatherineâs Oboe: Catherine Leeâs New Solo Album, âAlone Togetherâ is among the best of the COVID lockdown inspired releases that flooded the market this year. It is also one of the finest examples of the emerging latest generation of âwest coastâ composers. Dr. Lee is a master of the oboe and related instruments and she has been nurtured on the artistic ideas/styles that seem to be endemic among composers on the west coast of the United States. She deserves to be heard.\n\nNumber Eight is an article from 2014, Classical Protest Music: Hans Werner Henzeâs âEssay on Pigsâ (Versuch uber Schweine). This 1968 noisy modernist setting of leftist political poetry combines incredible extended vocal techniques with the dissonant modernism of Hans Werner Henzeâs work of that era. Also of note is that his use of a Hammond Organ and electric bass guitar was allegedly inspired by his having heard the Rolling Stones. Itâs a classic but warn anyone within earshot lest they be terrified.\n\nâDreams of a New Dayâ, a Landmark Recording Project from Cedille is a virtual manifesto/survey of art song by black composers. Liverman is an amazing singer and the recording by my favorite Chicago record company is pure beauty. This 2021 release ranks ninth among my most read blogs from the past 12 months.\n\nAs it happens there is a three way tie for the number ten spot:\n\nBlack Composers Since 1964: Primous Fountain is one of a short series of articles I wrote in 2014. I used the date 1964, 50 years prior to the date of the blog post, because it was the year of the passing of the (still controversial) voting rights act. As a result of this and a few related articles I have found myself on occasion categorized as a sort of de facto expert on black music and musicians. I am no expert there but I have personally discovered a lot of really amazing music by black composers which is way too little known and deserves an audience.\n\nI am pleased to tell you that this too little known composer (and fellow Chicagoan) is being recognized by no less than Michael Tilson Thomas who will conduct an entire program of his works in Miami next year. If my blog has helped in any way then I am pleased but the real honors go, of course, to Mr. Fountain and Mr. Thomas (who first conducted this composerâs music many years ago). Stay tuned.\n\nMy âcomeback blogâ, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Blogger was written to sort of reintroduce myself to the blogosphere and provide some background (excuses?) for my absence. I guess it was a decent read.\n\nAnd the third contender for my tenth most read of 2021 is, Kenneth Gaburo, the Avant-Garde in the Summer of Love. This is among the first volley of releases on the revived Neuma label with Philip Blackburn at the helm. Blackburnâs instincts guided Innova records to release many wonderful recordings of music rarely on the radar of larger record companies and this first volley was a harbinger of even more wonderful releases to come. Just do a Neuma search and see what I mean.\n\nThe Ones That Didnât Make the Top Ten\n\nI would be negligent and boringly formulaic to simply report on these top ten. This is not a democratic blog after all, lol. So here are my choices for the ones that many of my dear readers may have missed and should definitely check out. It is anything but objective. They are, in no particular order:\n\nSolo Artist Pamela Z releases âa secret codeâ. This is another Neuma release, one of a truly original and interesting artist who pretty much defies categories but the territory she explores will amaze you.\n\nLou Harrison: Concerto for Piano with Javanese Gamelan, a very special performance of an underappreciated masterpiece is just unabashedly excellent. It is a recording of a 2017 performance (in honor of the composerâs 100th birthday anniversary) in Cleveland by performers who have had a close relationship with this major American composer. I love the music. I love the performers. Itâs a digital only release but you can get a download of the album and the fine liner notes from Bandcamp.\n\nFixing a Hole to Keep the Music Playing: Starkland brings back Guy Klucevsekâs âCitrus, My Loveâ is also a digital only release, also available on Bandcamp of an album long out of print but essential to the oeuvre of Guy Klucevsek. Like Philip Blackburn, Tom Steenland (who heads Starkland records) is a musical visionary who has released some of my personal favorite albums. If Tom (or Philip) likes it I will at least give it a listen.\n\nDennis Weijers: Skill and Nostalgia in an Auspicious Debut Album is a sort of personal discovery for me. This reworking of Philip Glassâ âGlassworksâ and Steve Reichâs âVariations for Winds, Strings, and Keyboardsâ scored for solo accordion and electronics pretty much knocked me over as soon as I heard it. Read the blog to see why but you have to hear this. This is NOT your granddaddyâs accordion.\n\nVision, Virtuosity, and Interpretive Skill: Igor Levitâs âOn DSCHâ is an album I just canât stop listening to. I raved about his earlier set of piano variations by Bach, Beethoven, and the late Frederic Rzewski and I look forward to this manâs musical vision as he expands the concert repertoire with works you probably havenât heard or at least havenât heard much. You owe it to yourself to watch this artist.\n\nBlack Artists Matter: The Resurrection of the Harlem Arts Festival, 1969 is one of the relatively few times when I write about so called âpopâ music. It is wholly unconscionable that these filmed performances from 1969 (many of which predated Woodstock) languished for 50 years in the filmmakerâs basement and were nearly lost. One of the recurring themes in this blog is the lament over unjustly neglected music and this is a glaring example. I was delighted to see that the filmmaker Questlove received an award at the Sundance Festival for his work on this essential documentary of American music.\n\nLess âflashyâ but sublimely beautiful is Modern Tuning Scholarship, Authentic Bach Performance: Daniel Lippelâs âAufs Lautenwerkâ. This is a masterpiece of scholarship and a gorgeous recording on a specially made Well-Tempered Guitar played with serious passion and interpretive genius by a man who is essential to the productions of New Focus recordings as well as being a fine musician himself. Read the review or the liner notes for details but just listen. This is another one that I canât stop listening to.\n\nUnheard Hovhaness, this Sahan Arzruni album really rocked my geeky world. Arzruni, a frequent collaborator with Hovhaness turns in definitive performances of these previously unheard gems from the late American composer. A gorgeous physical production and a lucid recording make this another disc that lives on my âfrequently playedâ shelf.\n\nOnly the Lonely, Frank Horvatâs âMusic for Self Isolationâ is yet another release from this emerging Canadian composer. This is one of my favorite COVID Isolation albums, a unique response to this pandemic from an eminently listenable and endlessly creative composer.\n\nNew Music from Faroese Master Sunleif Rasmussen with soloist Michala Petri is an album of world premieres by this master composer from the Faroe Islands. It is also a tribute to the enduring artistry of Michala Petri. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting both of these artists some years ago in San Francisco and anything they do will demand my attention, theyâre that good.\n\nThe Bewitched in Berlin, Kenneth Gaburo does Harry Partch for your head (phones). This is another âsaveâ by Philip Blackburn. This performance in Berlin of Harry Partchâs âThe Bewitchedâ is a binaural recording of a very fine performance directed by Kenneth Gaburo. If youâre a Partch fan this is a must have.\n\nLast but not least, as they say, Robert Moran: Points of Departure is another triumph of Philip Blackburnâs curation on Neuma records. I have personally been a fan of Moranâs music since I first heard his work at the Chicago iteration of New Music America in 1982. Blackburnâs service to this composerâs work can be likened to similar service done by David Starobin at Bridge Records (who have embarked on complete works projects with several contemporary composers) and Tom Steenlandâs work with Guy Klucevsek and Tod Dockstader at Starkland records. Blackburn had previously released the out of print Argo recordings of Moranâs work and now, at Neuma has released this and a few other new recordings of this major American composerâs work.\n\nMy apologies to the albums Iâve reviewed which didnât make it to this yearâs end blog but I have to draw a line somewhere. Peace, health, and music. And thank you for reading.\n\nI donât recall when I first heard Guy Klucevsek but I think it was the early 90s. I grew up hearing a great deal of accordions in polka bands at weddings throughout my childhood. This instrument had, pretty much since its beginnings in the early 19th century, been associated primarily with folk bands and not at all with classical music. I donât think one can find an accordion used in a classical orchestra before Tchaikovskyâs 1822 Second Orchestral Suite and only sparingly after that. So when I discovered this New York musician via his releases on the Starkland label, Transylvanian Software (1999) and Free Range Accordion (2000) and the CRI disc Manhattan Cascade (1992). I was curious to see what this musician would do with this traditionally âlow browâ folk instrument.\n\nI had come to trust the Starkland label (which began in 1991) as one whose releases were usually very much to my taste and I was not disappointed to hear Klucevsekâs playing of pieces written by him and other composers for this instrument. Unlike Pauline Oliveros who did much to expand the very nature of the instrument itself, Klucevsek retained, and sometimes parodied, the humble folk/pop origins and reputation of the instrument while still pursuing its possibilities in the New York downtown experimental music scene where he worked with people like Laurie Anderson, Bang On a Can, Brave Combo, Anthony Braxton, Anthony Coleman, Dave Douglas, Bill Frisell, Rahim al Haj, Robin Holcomb, Kepa Junkera, the Kronos Quartet, Natalie Merchant, Present Music, RelÃ¢che, Zeitgeist, and John Zorn among many others. Klucevsek expanded the role of the accordion in his own way.\n\nKlucevsek later put together a commissioning project called, âPolka from the Fringeâ (1992), a project which echoes the 1981 âWaltz Projectâ by Robert Moran and presages another accordionist William Schimmelâs âThe Tango Projectâ of 2006. All of these commissioning projects utilized dance forms common in the 20th century as a âstepping offâ place for a new musical piece. And it was Starkland which rescued the fascinating two disc release of Polka from the Fringe (2013) from over two decades languishing in âout of printâ status. These projects are significant in that they invite composers to get out of their comfort zone and demonstrate their take on the given dance form. Like Klucevsekâs earlier releases this Polka collection is a veritable Whoâs Who of working composers of the era much as the Variations (1819) project of Anton Diabelli collected some 51 composersâ works based on Diabelliâs waltz-like theme (Beethovenâs gargantuan set of variations was published as volume 1 and the other 50 variations in volume 2 which included composers like Schubert and Liszt).\n\nSo here comes Starkland to the rescue again in this (languished for some 25 years after only having been available for two years) very personal recording which displays Klucevsekâs substantial compositional chops as well as his knowledge and use of extended instrumental techniques for his instrument. It presents pieces written for a dance performances and shows a very different side of Klucevsek, one which shows more of his substance as a composer alongside his virtuosic skills on his instrument. In this digital only release there is an option to include (for a mere $3.00 more on the Bandcamp site) a series of 13 videos featuring Guy Klucevsek talking about the music on this album and his various musical interests. A gorgeous 10 page booklet providing further detail including the original liner notes with updates is included in all purchases. The album will also be available on Spotify, You Tube, and other streaming services but the videos are only available on Bandcamp.\n\nListeners may find this new release has some in common with Starklandâs previous Klucevsek release from Starkland, âTeetering on the Verge of Normalcyâ (2016) which features some similar compositional diversity in a disc entirely of Klucevsekâs works. The line from Citrus, My Love to Teetering on the Edge of Normalcy seems to be a logical succession in Klucevsekâs compositional development. In addition to his accordion studies Klucevsek studied composition in Pittsburgh but it was the influence of Morton Subotnick with whom he studied in his independent post graduate work at the California Institute of the Arts that exposed this east coast artist to some of the splendors of the west coast encountering artists like Terry Riley and Pauline Oliveros. Indeed Klucevsek can be said to be âbi-coastalâ in his compositional endeavors. And though this is a âtongue in cheekâ characterization it does speak to the roots of Klucevsekâs diversity in style.\n\nThere are 12 tracks on âCitrus, My Loveâ representing 3 separate works: the three movement, âPassage Northâ (1990), the single movement, âPatience and Thymeâ (1991), and the eponymous, âCitrus, My Loveâ (1990) in 8 movements. The production of this album is by none other than Bobby Previte, another valued east coast musician and colleague. The notes have been updated under the guidance of Tom Steenland with input from Klucevsek who, understandably, expresses great joy in having this album available again.\n\nThe first three tracks are dedicated to a single work, âPassage Northâ (1990) written for accordion and string trio consisting of Mary Rowell, violin/viola, Erik Friedlander, cello, and Jonathan Storck, double bass. They are dubbed âThe Bantam Orchestraâ. This Copland-esque work was commissioned by Angela Caponigro Dance Ensemble. The second movement is for string trio alone and is dedicated to the memory of Aaron Copland who died in 1990.\n\nPatience and Thyme (1991) according to the composer âis a love note to my wife, Jan.â He composed the work while in residence at the Yellow Springs Institute in Pennsylvania, which coincided with his 22nd wedding anniversary. It is scored for piano and string trio, no accordion. Compositionally it seems at home between the larger pieces.\n\nCitrus, My Love was commissioned by Stuart Pimsler for the dance of the same name. It is in 8 scenes and is scored for Klucevsekâs accordion accompanied by his personally chosen Bantam Orchestra. Klucevsek describes the music on this album as representing his transition from hard core minimalism to a more melody driven style and this is the missing link, the âholeâ to which I referred in the Beatles metaphor in the title of this review.\n\nFor those who already appreciate Klucevsekâs work this album is a must have. To those who have not gotten to know this unique talent this is a good place to start.\n\nFor those seeking to get more deeply into Klucevsekâs work (a worthwhile endeavor) and to provide a perspective on the range of this artistâs work Iâm appending a discography (shamelessly lifted and updated from the Free Reed Journal) :\n\nSOLOIST/LEADER\n\nScenes from a Mirage (Review)\n\nWho Stole the Polka?

All of these are new names to this writer and, most likely, to the majority of listeners. That is what makes this disc such an exciting prospect. This post WW2 generation of composers are writing music from the perspective of their generations, one which is qualitatively different than that of previous generations but all owe a debt to the man who is arguably Armeniaâs first truly modern composer, Tigran Mansurian (1939- ) whose brave integration of modern trends in western music distinguish him from previous generations of classical composers whose focus was either nationalistic (as Copland was to American music) or traditional religious music for the Armenian Orthodox Christian rites. Mansurian, in addition to embracing European modernism also returned to embrace the traditional religious compositions of Komitas. Spirituality is a frequent and revered aspect of Armenian classical music.\n\nOne must, of course, acknowledge the âelephant in the roomâ issue of the Armenian genocide of 1915 (only now in 2021 finally acknowledged by the United States) as a factor in some degree in the artistic output of this small nation. There are no obvious references as such in the compositions recorded here but the selection of texts which either inspire or are literally set to be sung are notably somber whether hat be the Latin title of the first work on the disc, Artur Avanesovâs âQuasi Harema Marisâ taken from the Book of Job or the beautiful but lonely poetry of Vahan Tekayan set in Artashes Katalyanâs âTekayan Triptychâ. Horrors such as this affect generations after all.\n\nIt was Maestro Movses Pogossian who kindly sent me a review copy of this album. He played a large role in the conceptualization and production of this album. He also plays violin on the first track. The Armenian born Pogossian, a world renowned violinist, is also the head of the Armenian Music Program at UCLAâs Herb Alpert School of Music. He is also the artistic director of the Dilijan Chamber Music Series and artistic director of the VEM Ensemble, a group of graduate musicians in residence at UCLA. His involvement is yet another reason to get this disc. It is clearly a project close to his heart and one upon which he has invested a great deal of artistic energy.\n\nThis album was recorded in May, 2019 and released in 2020 where it ran up against the pandemic shutdowns which affected performing musicians and temporarily stifled this reviewer as well. So here is my very appreciative review perhaps a year later than intended.\n\nThere are 18 tracks containing pieces by five Armenian composers, all of whom took part in this production.\n\nThe first track contains a piece for piano quintet in one movement (Movses Pogossian and Ji Eun Hwang, violins; Morgan OâShaughnessey, viola; Niall Ferguson, cello; and the composer Artur Avanesov at the piano). âQuasi Harena Marisâ (2016) takes its Latin name from the Biblical Book of Job. The title in English reads, âLike the Sand of the Seaâ. It is a metaphor spoken by Job as he compares his grief to the sand of the sea sinking in its heaviness. The piece is described by the composer as a set of variations. Microtonal gestures evoke a choir interacting in a sort of call and response strategy with the piano. This is a powerful piece sometimes meditative, sometimes declamatory, but always evoking pain and sadness such as that described by the Biblical Job. While embracing modernism in his compositional methods Avanesov embraces spirituality as well.\n\nThe second track contains another single movement work, Novelette (2010) by Ashot Zohrabyan. It is scored for piano quartet (Varty Manouelian, violin; Scott St. John, viola; Antonio Lysy, cello; and Artur Avanesov once again at the piano. This work seems to have much in common with the first in that it embraces modernist techniques with spiritual references to suggest longing and separation. It is another powerful expression which engages the listener with clever invention while evoking a post apocalyptic sadness.\n\nNow we move from quintet through quartet and on to, of course, trio. This work, also in a single movement, is scored for piano trio (Varty Manouelian, violin; Charles Tyler, cello; and Artur Avanesov on piano. Michel Petrossianâs, âA Fiery Flame, a Flaming Fireâ (2017), the title a contrasting of two different translations of the biblical event in which the Angel of God appears to Moses in a burning bush. The composer describes this piece as an investigation of identity (his own being variously of âArmenian by birth, Russian by education, and French by cultureâ). It is also an homage to Mr. Pogossian. More kinetic and varied than the previous two pieces, this tour de force nonetheless also knows pain.\n\nTracks 4-6 contain the âTekeyan Triptychâ by Artashes Kartalyan showcases the poetry of Vahan Tekeyan in an English translation by Vatsche Barsoumian. The UCLA VEM Ensemble (Danielle Segen, mezzo-soprano; Ji Eun Hwang and Aiko Richter, violins; Morgan OâShaughnessey, viola; and Jason Pegis, cello). This is a beautifully lyric setting of some mighty somber poetry which is very much in keeping with the tone of this recording. The VEM Ensemble handles this lyricism with ease and professionalism.\n\nWe now move on to music for something other than strings and piano, namely the âSuite for Saxophone and Percussionâ (2015) by Ashot Kartalyan. This five movement suite puts this writer in the mind of similar works by American composer Alan Hovhaness, the composer whose immersion in Armenian culture introduced many (this writer included) to the splendors of Armenian art music. This piece uses instrumental choices similar to Hovhaness and utilizes contrapuntal writing as well. but one cannot miss the jazz inflections doubtless gleaned from Kartalyanâs exposure to the work of his jazz musician father. This suite is also a more animated piece providing relief from the intense and somber music on the first half of the disc.\n\nThe final seven tracks are given to a selection from a series of works by the hard working pianist/composer who performed in the first three works on the disc. And it is here that we can solve the mystery of the title of the album as well. These brief works seem to be etudes, experimental compositional efforts which doubtless become material in some way for later works. The third piece presented here is titled âModulation Necklaceâ. This selection comes from what the composers says are some seventy similar works under the title âFeux Folletsâ (frenzied flames in English). They are said to have no singe unifying aspect but it appears that these are an insight to some of the composerâs compositional methods. They provide a calm and curiously speculative little journey which leaves the listener wanting more.\n\nThis is a delightful disc made with serious scholarship and dedication which introduces audiences to the splendors of contemporary Armenian art music. One hopes that this well lead to more and larger works being recorded.\n\nLike many innovative young artists in New York City in the early 60s Meredith Monk had to train musicians to work with her unusual vocal methods. Her first album, Key (1971), was the first time her vocal art began to be dispersed outside the intimate, neo-bohemian loft space where the album was recorded. After graduating from Sarah Lawrence College in 1964 Monk moved to Manhattan where she and many other young, creative experimental musicians populated what became known as the âdowntown sceneâ or SOHO. Many musicians worked with her over the years including composer/cellist Robert Een, Pianist Anthony De Mare both of whom incorporated their extended vocal techniques learned in the loft of the master herself.\n\nBang on a Can was formed from a very similar aesthetic (that of providing an alternative to the âuptown sceneâ which generally refers to the âestablishmentâ or âmainstreamâ of classical music epitomized by Julliard and Lincoln Center. Founded in 1987, Bang on a Can and their subsequent touring group, Bang on a Can All Stars (begun in 1992) can be said to be another generationâs effort to achieve what Monk and the many musicians who followed such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, LaMonte Young, among many others whose musical vision stood in contrast to the established uptown, more academic leanings.\n\nIt was Bang on a Canâs transcription of Brian Enoâs famous studio produced album (no live musicians), âMusic for Airportsâ that demonstrated their ability to revision some of the work of their forebears and bring it into the concert hall. This is pretty much what we see here in this loving collaboration/tribute to one of New Yorkâs finest composer/performers from the early downtown/SOHO era.\n\nMonk began her artistic life as a dancer and dance/choreography remains an essential part of her artistic vision. 2014-2015 marks the 50th anniversary of Meredith Monk as a performer. ââMâEMâO-RâY â-G-Aâ-MEââ (2020) is a wonderful production which sits somewhere between a âgreatest hitsâ record and that of another generationâs reverent celebration of a unique artist. Bang on a Can shares the duties of transcription and performing with Monk and her ensemble. Most of Monkâs work involves (generally) one to five musicians (playing minimalist style music) onstage but here we see an expansion into a larger ensemble not unlike her collaborations which resulted in one of her largest works, the masterful âAtlasâ (1993) produced by the Houston Opera. (Would that a new recording of Atlas may eventually come from such a collaboration).\n\nSo what we have here is a combination of transcription, performance, but most importantly a respectful sharing out of a mutual educational experience between Monkâs ensemble and that of BOC. There are nine tracks comprising nine distinct compositions from Monkâs oeuvre. BOC composers provided transcriptions of âSpaceshipâ (Michael Gordon), âMemory Songâ (Julia Wolfe), âDownfallâ (Ken Thomson), âTotentanzâ and âDouble Fiestaâ (David Lang). The other tracks appear in transcriptions by members of Monkâs ensemble: âGamemasterâs Songâ and âMigrationâ (Monk"
