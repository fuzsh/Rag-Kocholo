        "text": "Oded Tzúr, saxophone\n\nNitai Hershkovits, piano\n\nPetros Klampanis, bass,\n\nCyrano Almeida, drums\n\nNew York saxophonist Oded Tzúr has ushered in a new era for his instrument by giving it a whole new voice — one that is described by The Guardian as a \"unique tenor sax whisper”. Often recalled by the artist as a 10-year leap of faith, this complete reimagining of the instrument has established him as a torchbearer of Spiritual Jazz. His music is more than a conversation, states the New York City Jazz Record: “It is an interactive prayer\".\n\nMy Prophet, Tzúr's 5th album as a leader, anoints music as the epicenter of a spiritual discipline: a prophet that tells us not about the future, but about who we really are. Through a myth-like suite of five movements, the bandleader tells the story of an all-powerful deity, experiencing everything from sobering murmurs to cathartic, unabashed ecstasy.\n\nAccompanied by his long-time colleagues Nitai Hershkovits on piano and Petros Klampanis on bass, and joined by the newest member of the band — Brazilian drummer Cyrano Almeida, this is Tzúr’s most accomplished work to date. While remaining a seamless continuation of his previous meditations on ECM Records, My Prophet is as wild and daring as it is centered and focused, and promises to uplift the listener to new heights."
