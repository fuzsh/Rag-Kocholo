Georges Méliès, 1902, France, 13 mins.\n\nIn Georges Méliès’ pioneering visual effects-laden science-fiction short, a party embarking on an exploratory mission to the moon encounter mysterious creatures.\n\nCops, Dir. Buster Keaton, 1922, USA, 18 mins.\n\nAfter being rebuffed by his sweetheart for not being a savvy businessman, a young man stumbles across a wad of cash that just might be what he needs to prove himself. However, a series of incidents begin to snowball into something quite out of his control.\n\nThis very special free performance is co-presented with ACMI. Arrive early to grab a deckchair or bring your own chair or picnic rug.\n\nWe’ll also be shouting you gelato from our friends at Cups n Cones. Serving delicious house-made artisan gelato and sorbets, there will be a selection of nine flavours to suit everyone (6 dairy, 3 non-dairy). Available from 7.30pm-9.30pm or until exhausted (limit 1 per person).\n\nPerformed by\n\nPhillip Johnston (saxophone)\n\nDaryl Pratt (vibraphone)\n\nAlister Spence (piano)\n\nLloyd Swanton (bass)\n\nJames Greening (trombone)\n\nPaul Cutlan (baritone sax)\n\nNic Cecire (drums)\n\nAbout Phillip Johnston\n\nA saxophonist, composer and arranger of both jazz and new music, Phillip Johnston has been a significant figure in the underground music scene of New York’s Downtown since the beginning of the 1980s, before moving to Sydney in 2005. As a band leader (Microscopic Septet, Fast ‘N’ Bulbous, The Coolerators), duo performer (Joel Forrester, Guy Klucevsek, Peter Dasent), composer of music for film (Music of Chance, Noise, Faithful), silent film (Faust, Page of Madness, The Adventures of Prince Achmed), and multimedia (Wordless! with Art Spiegelman), he has established a unique voice in contemporary music.\n\nThe Merry Frolics of Méliès was premiered at New York’s Lincoln Center in 1997, and subsequently has been performed across the US, Europe and the USA. His book on contemporary scores for silent film, Silent Films/Loud Music (Bloomsbury) was published in 2021."
