        "text": "PRISM Quartet Institute (PQI) is an innovative program through which the PRISM Quartet partners with cultural and educational organizations worldwide to share knowledge the group has accumulated in our 39 years together—all for the benefit of aspiring artists. PQI is offering seminars, interactive workshops, and classes under five separate tracks: Teaching and Pedagogy; Business and Entrepreneurship; Recording and Technology; Composition; and Mentorship.\n\nWith lead support from The Presser Foundation, PRISM Quartet created PQI, in part, as a response to the pandemic, which separated Quartet members from one another and from our audiences. But this initiative is also deeply connected to the ensemble’s educational mission: to foster a new generation of artists, and through their work, the public’s appreciation of contemporary music.\n\nFor information about hosting PQI, please reach out to Executive Director Matthew Levy at matt@prismquartet.com.\n\nTeaching and Pedagogy\n\nMasterclasses\n\nPRISM Quartet member provide personalized instruction in a public forum for saxophone soloists.

The presentation also examines strategies to ensure the longevity of an ensemble.\n\nStarting Your Own Record Label: From Concept to Album\n\nThe PRISM Quartet self-produces recordings for its own label, XAS Records, distributed worldwide by Naxos of America.

PRISM provides feedback, from use of notation to content and development of musical ideas.\n\nComposition for Kids\n\nElementary school kids work with PRISM over multiple sessions to transcribe a collection of saxophone sounds into written symbols, and use those symbols to create graphic scores of their own music compositions. Students team up with the Quartet to develop performances of their works.\n\nUnlocking Your Inner Composer\n\nAdults and teens work with PRISM Quartet member over multiple sessions to create their own works for solo saxophone or saxophone quartet.\n\nMentorship\n\nPRISM Quartet Institute has partnered with host organizations— community arts schools, after school programs, HBCUs, and more— throughout the country to serve constituents from diverse backgrounds and walks of life. In addition to group sessions, we work one-on-one with constituents to deepen PQI’s impact. PQI’s Mentorship Program serves aspiring artists by connecting them as mentees to individual PRISM Quartet members who provide career and professional development guidance. The program prioritizes artists who are underrepresented in the chamber music field or the nonprofit arts sector—whose opportunities have been limited by race or ethnicity, class, geography, or disability. This service, provided at no cost to mentees, enables PRISM to address historic inequities in the music sector that persist today."
