The band draws on inspiration from music made in the 1920s and '30s, re-imagining works by the likes of Jelly Roll Morton, and Johnston also adds his own voice to the mix with some original writing too.\n\nSaxophonist Phillip Johnston has long been interested in the more traditional styles of jazz, and has explored the music of the '20s and '30s alongside a myriad of bands like The Microscopic Septet. Originally from the States, Johnston has been based in Australia for nearly 20 years, and has collaborated with many major players in our local scene."
