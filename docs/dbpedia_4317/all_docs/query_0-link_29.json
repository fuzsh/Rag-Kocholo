        "text": "published on 2014-03-02T08:26:58Z\n\n7 piece band that indiscriminately blend elements of wildly varying styles. Edema Ruh are deeply entrenched in the Folk Tradition, while mashing Balkan, Celtic, Gypsy, Latin and Caribbean and American styles with the can-do attitude of Free Jazz, and the intensity of Metal. They create a sound that is difficult to describe, but certain to intrigue, excite, and have every able body in the room dancing wildly.\n\nGenre\n\nJazz"
