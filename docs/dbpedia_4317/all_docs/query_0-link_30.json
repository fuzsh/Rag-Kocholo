        "text": "According to experts, the most difficult string quartet ever written is Ben Johnston’s Quartet No. 7. It was composed in 1984 but went unperformed for decades. Musicians who knew the score, with the ingenious palindromic structure of one movement and variations teeming with over a thousand microscopically distinct pitches, considered it well-nigh unplayable.\n\nNow the work is available on a CD that the Kepler Quartet released hard on the heels of the composer’s 90th birthday in March. The album, which also contains Mr. Johnston’s sixth and eighth quartets and a short piece for voice and strings called “Quietness,” marks the completion of one of the most ambitious and single-minded recording projects in American music. The Kepler players — the violinists Sharan Leventhal and Eric Segnitz, the violist Brek Renzelman and the cellist Karl Lavine — dedicated the better part of the past 14 years to learning and recording all of Mr. Johnston’s 10 quartets. The sixth alone took them a year and a half to master."
