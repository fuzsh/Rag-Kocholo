        "text": "A New York City native and graduate of the Eastman School of Music, Curtis Stewart has performed as a soloist with the National Repertory Orchestra, in Lincoln Center, and Carnegie Hall. He has made chamber music appearances at Zankel Hall, and the Rochester International Jazz Festival, holding his audiences “spellbound” with his“warm, clear sound…sparkling rhythmic energy” and “prodigious technique,” (New Amsterdam Times, SoundWordSight) An avid teacher, he currently teaches at the Laguardia Highschool for Music & Art and Performing Arts. Curtis’ eclectic background has led him to concerts in many different realms of music from MTV specials with Wyclef Jean, to stints at the Kennedy center with the Jimmy Heath Big Band. His ensembles “PUBLIQuartet,” and “The Mighty Third Rail” perform frequently at many of New York’s illustrious venues including the Carnegie Hall, Symphony Space, Merkin Hall, the Cornelia Street Cafe, BAM Cafe, Lincoln Center, Nuyorican Poet’s Cafe, and the Stone. Curtis has worked with today’s prominent musicians including Henry Threadgill, Dick Oatts, Jason Lindner, Edmar Casteneda, Linda Oh, Chris Dingman, Dave Liebman, Matt Wilson, among many others. A supporter and practitioner of many styles of music, Curtis is excited to continue expanding and blending all the elements of his stylistic and expressive range, developing a unique and relevant voice in New York’s boundless music scene.\n\nJannina Norpoth made her debut as a soloist with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra at age 14. Since then she has built a career as an innovative collaborative artist, performer, arranger and educator. She has performed internationally, including appearances on the Lincoln Center “Great Performers” Series, Mostly Mozart Festival, Women of the World Festival at The Apollo Theater, The Ecstatic Music Festival, VH1’s Save the Music, and SNL. She has been featured alongside acclaimed musicians James Carter, Nadia Sirota, Regina Carter, Marcus Belgrave, Jay - Z, Beyoncé, Pharell, Stevie Wonder, Anita Baker, My Brightest Diamond and many others.\n\nMs. Norpoth is a sought after arranger in the classical and non-classical worlds. Praised by Strad Magazine for her ability to write a transcription “so natural sounding that it could have been the composer's original version”, recent commissions include an adaptation of Scott Joplin’s “Treemonisha” form the Volcano Theatre Company in Toronto and Dvorak’s “American Suite” for Trinity Wall Street’s “12th Night Festival”. Ms. Norpoth has arranged/recorded strings for grammy-winning producers Jerry \"Wonda\" Duplessis and Bryce Goggin and for artists Keyshia Cole, Keri Hilson, Black Dahlia Murder, Akron Family, John Legend, and her own ensembles PUBLIQuartet and HOLLANDS.\n\nMs. Norpoth performs and writes in folk/rock duo HOLLANDS. Praised for their multi-faceted sound, HOLLANDS was profiled by BBC as \"pulsing indie pop that really puts a spring in your step ... mixing fun, folk, rock and elements of classical.\" In 2016 HOLLANDS, PUBLIQuartet and artist Amy Khoshbin created The Scheherazade Project (TSP), a multimedia song cycle inspired by the stories of One Thousands and One Nights. TSP was awarded a Sphinx MPower grant for it’s creation and premiered as part of the NYC Electro-Acoustic Music Festival and The New York Philharmonic’s Biennial Celebration, with support from MAC Cosmetics and DPA Microphones.\n\nWhen Nick Revel is not touring as founding violist of the multi-GRAMMY™ Nominated PUBLIQuartet, he is composing, producing, and performing original solo pieces, audio engineering ensembles of various shapes and sizes, and teaching students of all ages. His recent compositions have won the Red Jasper Award Shortlist, the Catalyst Quartet's CQ Minute competition, fivebyfive's 2020 call for original scores, and placement on top podcasts like Doug Fearn's My Take on Music Recording. These works appear on his newest album, Dream Collider, (Sapphire Records) available on all major platforms. He has served as artistic and executive director of the Norwalk Youth Chamber Ensembles, co-creator of the New York String Studio, and on the board of the Seabury Academy of Music and the Arts in Norwalk, CT.\n\nCellist Hamilton Berry's eclectic taste has led him to pursue a variety of performing, arranging, and composing projects in the New York area and beyond. A member of PUBLIQuartet, Orchestra of St. Luke’s, Toomai String Quintet, Founders, and The Con Brio Ensemble, Hamilton has also performed with Ensemble Connect, Decoda, NOVUS NY, and A Far Cry, and has collaborated with artists including Vampire Weekend, Rostam, Bjork, Debbie Harry, FUN., Léa Freire, Hiromi, Magos Herrera, Diane Monroe, and Becca Stevens. He is Assistant Program Director of the Musicambia program at Sing Sing Correctional Facility, where he teaches string students.\n\nA Nashville native, Hamilton has played at the Montreal Jazz, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Olympic, and Yellow Barn music festivals. In 2009 he received his Master of Music from the Juilliard School, where he studied with Timothy Eddy; his previous teachers include Felix Wang, Grace Bahng, and Anne Williams. During his fellowship with Ensemble Connect - a program of Carnegie Hall, Juilliard, and the Weill Music Institute in partnership with the New York City Department of Education - Hamilton was a visiting teaching artist at IS61 on Staten Island."
