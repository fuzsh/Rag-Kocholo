Phillip Johnston (soprano sax), Peter Farrar (alto sax), Tim Clarkson (tenor sax), Jim Loughnan (baritone sax), Peter Dasent (piano), Tim Rollinson (guitar / banjo), James Greening (trombone), Nic Ceciro (drums).\n\nLabel: CD, Earshift Music EAR081.\n\nwww.earshift.com\n\nReviewed by: Ian Muldoon\n\n“For those familiar with the “Jazz Age” Phillip Johnston has produced, arranged and led an octet of some of Australia’s best to remind us of an incredibly rich period in the evolution of the music. His affectionate and enjoyable homage to the greats is a welcome respite to the earnest compositions of much modern music in this genre.”\n\nCD, Earshift Music EAR081.\n\nwww.earshift.com\n\nPhillip Johnston asserts in the notes to document I Cakewalked With A Zombie (Earshift Music) 2023 that the “1920s and 1930s were one of the greatest periods of American music”. He’s too modest. That period, and the 1950s in American music, are now considered by some, and increasingly year by year, by more and more artists, as artistic goldmines and a revolution in Western music, arising in parallel with the rise of democracy and other freedoms. Specifically, Duke Ellington is widely accepted as worthy of inclusion alongside Gershwin, Stravinsky and Varese.\n\nIn our home at age 10 years I encountered Edward Kennedy Ellington and Tishomingo Blues (Williams) recorded in 1928. Another was two sides of a 12” 78 rpm acetate 1929 record of Tiger Rag (Edwards/LaRocca/Henry Ragas/Tony Sbarbaro/Larry Shields) which featured a toe-curlingly brilliant clarinet in Bb solo by Barney Bigard. Part 1 was transcribed by Will R. Anderson in 2010. That the composition is shared by all members of the 1918 (White) Original Dixieland Jazz Band suggests its genesis was an improvised session captured on record. These popular tunes led me to Ellington’s own works – The Mooche, Black and Tan Fantasy, Black Beauty amongst the hundreds he composed.\n\nA significant element of this music was its rhythmic genius. Musicians and critics have noted that Louis Armstrong made a single note swing and gave preeminence in the music to the soloist. Where Johnston connects this music to cartoons my family connected it to Beethoven, Chopin, and Mozart, that is, “serious” music. Yet, as Johnston notes, jazz was used as soundtracks for cartoons of the day including Don Redman whose band backed Betty Boop shorts. Apart from the French especially and the rise of post-modernism, jazz was artistically marginalised as “funny” music, entertainment music just as the African American was depicted in the media of the day – such as Stepin Fetchit (stereo typical lazy black) and “Satchmo” Armstrong with his brilliant music overlayed with racist images of his features – as, let’s spell it out, jokes – backing a Betty Boop short I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead, (You Rascal You) (Theard).\n\nFats Waller, Clifford Curzon, and Eileen Joyce were other pianists celebrated in our home. Ellington stopped using the word “jazz” in 1943 because it delimited the richness of all the best Western music. Even so, extant musical “experts” and academics seem blind to the significance of rhythm and its importance to Ellington’s greatness which some would argue was at its peak over period of the 20s, 30s and 40s. The influence of Debussy and other “classical” artists on Ellington was after that of Will Vodery. Vodery, an African American, was responsible for the arrangements of the Show Boat (Hammerstein) versions of 1928, 1932, and 1936 (film) and the orchestrations of Gershwin’s one act Opera a la African American. According to Ellington, his chromatic convictions, tones normally extra-diatonic, altered the harmonic nature of his music for the better because of Vodery. It was later that he was influenced by Debussy or Valery. But it was sophisticated rhythms that underpinned all. Ellington never wrote the drum parts. Awful Sad is the single track composed by Ellington featured in the programme by Phillip Johnston.\n\nThe jazz of Jelly Roll Morton, which features on three of 15 tunes on Johnston’s programme, was known more for its polyphony than for the individual expression of its horns which included cornet, trombone and clarinet. Johnston’s horns are all reeds, soprano – Johnston; alto – Peter Farrar; baritone – Jim Loughnan; and tenor sax – Tim Clarkson. This last was not a jazz stand out until McKinney’s Cotton Pickers featured tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins. Morton also used a bass where Johnston has the great James Greening on sousaphone (tuba), an instrument used in marching bands where bass is of course impractical. Polyphonic improvisation was the basis on which aficionados, known as the Mouldy Figges, labelled such music “classic jazz”. The English poet Philip Larkin, an anti-modernist, was an eminent spokesman for that movement. The 1940s and 1950s were high points for this “revivalist” movement which considered swing music and bebop music squawking balderdash not far from noise. Apart from Eddie Condon, revivalist bands tended to flounder on the rocks of rhythm, where they are clunky parodies of the originals.\n\nJohnston is no Mouldy Figge and has a wide cross-genre interest in this music, as well as the blues and film music. His homage to the greats of the period is a welcome respite to the current period of experimentation and the multitudes on MTV and a reminder of the astonishing richness of the 20s and 30s when hundreds and hundreds of clubs engaged musicians to entertain patrons. In the programme of I Cakewalked With A Zombie, polyphonic improvisation is well demonstrated on the lively Grandpa’s Spells (Morton) which is noteworthy for some fine work by Tim Rollinson on guitar and banjo. In A Mist (Beiderbecke), though somewhat over-arranged, has a well placed baritone saxophone solo by Jim Loughnan. Lil Hardin’s Jazz Lips is also tight. Awful Sad (Ellington), a “fox-trot” at 4/4 at allegro, was recorded by Ellington in 1928; it opens with muted trumpet over reed harmony and closes with open trumpet over reeds. Johnston’s version at the same tempo has the soprano sax take the trumpet part quite effectively, followed by tenor, alto, guitar, and a lovely effort by Greening on sousaphone. The group never strays very far from what is a catchy melody. Piano opens My What An Ugly Baby (Johnston), a ragtime piece with a snatch of drumming on the bells reminiscent of the time. Zuzilla Strut (Johnston) features the soprano sax and piano and repeated chugging choruses of the theme. The most delightful piece is an original, Damp Rag (Johnston), which has a loose swing feel, a change of tempo and a fine banjo solo by Rollinson. It’s a melodically rich piece with a giddy feel. Potato Head Blues (Armstrong) has the energy and toe tapping exhilaration of music of the time introduced by Greening’s sousaphone and Loughnan’s baritone sax. It ends with reed harmony. Greening also opens the bluesy Keep Your Lamps Trimmed and Burning (Traditional). Loughnan’s fine baritone sax solo is backed by Greening with punctuation provided by piano. The banjo solo backed by sousaphone also works a treat. This piece is a terrific outing for the whole band.\n\nFor those familiar with the “Jazz Age” it’s a welcome reminder of an incredibly rich period in the evolution of the music."
