        "text": "Tomorrow’s New Quartet is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the most exciting jazz bands emerging from the British scene. Taking inspiration from Chick Corea’s ‘Return To Forever’ and Keith Jarrett’s ‘European Quartet’, Tomorrow’s New Quartet has been thrilling audiences all over the country with its engaging brand of modern jazz. Led by drummer /composer Rod Oughton, the band released its debut album ‘All Together, Now!’ on the Ubuntu Music label in 2022. Following a successful launch tour, which culminated in a sold-out show at Pizza Express Dean Street, the album was named ‘Editor’s Choice’ by Jazzwise Magazine, and dubbed ‘very fresh’ by Jumoké Fashola on BBC Radio 3. The band features several young heavyweights from the next generation of British jazz, namely Helena Kay on Sax, Deschanel Gordon on piano and Flo Moore on electric bass."
