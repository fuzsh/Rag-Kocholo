        "text": "Category:Jazz\n\nArtist(s): The Coolerators. Phillip Johnston (composer/saxophones), Alister Spence (organ), Lloyd Swanton (bass) and Nic Cecire (drums)\n\nLabel: Asynchronous Records,2018. Recorded and mixed at Rancom St Studios October/November 2017\n\nReviewed by: Gavin Franklin\n\n“The Coolerators obviously love their work and have had a great deal of fun.”\n\nThe individual members of this band have impressive reputations in the Australian jazz community. Alister Spence (Clarion Fracture Zone, Wanderlust and his own Trio), Lloyd Swanton (The Necks and The catholics) and Nic Cecire (The Whitlams, The catholics) have enjoyed careers on their various instruments and in multiple ensembles that stretch back over decades. Their leader in the Coolerators is the composer/saxophonist Phillip Johnston. He has assembled this band to play a bunch of his pieces that sound like they would be fun to play. They are jaunty tunes with an appearance of simplicity that I suspect is a bit deceptive.\n\nThe ‘composed’ portion of the second track, the tune titled What Is Real?, is a repeating ostinato that sets the mode for the improvisation that follows. By the time the band has finished with it, the result is more than its simple parts lead one to expect. The photograph of the band on the CD cover is a give-away; it suggests that they enjoy one another’s company. This sense of fun pervades the entire album.\n\nJohnston has written a good deal of music for silent films or with programmatic associations. (I recently reviewed an album of his titled The Adventures of Prince Achmed which contained music to accompany an animation film that was made in 1926). Little surprise then that the compositions on Diggin’ Bones have a ‘visual’ element, although I cannot entirely say why. The artwork used on the CD cover is a reproduction of images dating from the 1860s that depict scenes in Hell. The result is that one approaches the experience of listening to the album with a slightly eerie feeling. After listening to all the tracks, I did not emerge with a sense of dread or depression. The pervading mood is that of a party.\n\nDiggin’ Bones, the title track, has a Klezmer flavour with a repeating figure played on soprano saxophone over an accompanying riff performed on the organ. There is an extended central section in which these two instruments improvise around the mode that was established in the initial section. The bass and drums maintain the steady pulse while organ and saxophone improvise. Finally, the original insistent soprano sax figure returns to take us out. There are no rattling skeletons in this music, but the Latin rhythm feels good.\n\nKeyboardist Alister Spence plays organ on this album and the sounds of the instrument, along with those of soprano and alto saxes, are central to every track. Alto sax features on the fourth track (Temporary Blindness) in which Lloyd Swanton on the bass also takes a turn to play (arco) the main melody, before Spence butts in with a suitably soulful organ solo, in which he uses some classic techniques of that genre of organ playing. It sets the stage for the ensuing alto sax solo and ‘out chorus’. The title of this tune does not appear to bear any direct association with the musical content; it’s all part of the general good time.\n\nThe only track not credited to Johnston is the sixth, titled The Revenant. The title suggests someone who has returned, possibly from the dead and I thought it probably referred to the confronting film of that name that was released several years ago. Instead, it is a song by American folksinger Michael Hurley and bears scant resemblance to the music from the film. Certainly, the minor mode of the piece gives the tune a mystic, questing quality that is suited to the connotations of its title. The improvised solo in this track is played by the bass. The instrument’s timbre conveys a sombre feeling and I could not imagine another instrument in this ensemble having the same weight.\n\nMy overall impression of this album is that it has been made by a group of friends enjoying playing some tunes that one of them has written. They achieve their objective and produce some very listenable music in the process.\n\nVIEW AND LISTEN"
