        "text": "Aphorism Quartet\n\nMichael Beck (p), Domenic Landolf (ts, bcl), Jorge Rossy (vib, dr), Arne Huber (b)\n\nPress\n\nReviews:\n\nChromophilia\n\nAnyone who knows Michael Beck, Domenic Landolf and Jorge Rossy knows about some similarities in their characters: modesty and restraint, for example, or the careful choice and effectiveness of their words. They don’t put themselves in the spotlight unnecessarily. In words and music they say what they have to say, and their aesthetic articulation is clear and authentic at every moment. Musically they share a lot of common ground; they are not looking for flashy effects or for newisms for their own sake. Rather, with „Chromophilia“ the trio continues, consistent with what they started with their first record „Aphorism“, that which is common to the three musicians and is also stated in that album’s title.\n\nChromophilia could perhaps be translated as “peculiarities of coloring“; it is a chamber-music Jazz with strong contrasts and a sometimes spartan and dry, but always relaxed and dynamic reduction to the essential: timbres, light and shadow. Here, Beck, Landolf and Rossy complement each other perfectly; they play in the same spirit and in common purpose. Everyone in the trio is able to shine as a soloist as well as in accompanying the others, and the putative simplicity grows in interplay, a well-dosed to and fro towards varied, tonally finely-balanced sound images.\n\nThe melodies and rhythms the trio combines are reminiscent of brush- or pencil strokes by Cezanne, hinting at creating and opening spaces or geometric bodies but never fully divulging everything. That which inhabits its spaces remains the secret of this art, and it is precisely what the trio doesn’t adorn to the fullest that evokes joy and tension from music and the fantasies it triggers.\n\nIt is characteristic of this bass- and drum-less trio that each of the three musicians is rhythmically inspired and therefore the bass and drums are never really missing. Multi-instrumentalist Jorge Rossy, a world-acclaimed drummer and an accomplished pianist, sets beautiful accents on Vibes and Marimba in solo parts as well in accompaniment and with his timing just as Domenic Landolf does on tenor saxophone and, most notably with the dark timbre of his bass clarinet and the well balanced use of its large range of registers. On the piano, Michael Beck provides not only the warm primer for this music, but he also, with his particular color palette, his chiaroscuro and his concise solos, creates tasteful contrasts, enhancing the impact of the other instruments.\n\nThe music of this trio makes do without any bombast and is almost in its entirety very lyrical, sometimes quite dreamy, flowing and swinging. The album contains compositions by all three musicians as well as «The Newcomer“, a song by Mercedes Rossy. Mercedes, Jorge’s sister, was an accomplished pianist and composer who sadly passed away in 1995. Like on Aphorism, we also find a composition by Kurt Weill: «Alabama Song“, here in an adaptation by Domenic Landolf. This tune has been interpreted by pop musicians, most notably the Doors, whose 1967 cover version became world-famous.\n\nChromophilia: 15 titles, simple and unpretentious but for that very reason both enthralling and mysterious\n\nTom Gsteiger / Landbote\n\nContact\n\nwww.michaelbeck.ch"
