        "text": "Saturday / February 15, 2020 / 6 p.m.\n\nWilliams Center for the Arts\n\nA Benefit Concert for March Elementary School\n\nJeff “Tain” Watts is a seven-time Grammy Award winner and a Guggenheim Fellow. Rightly hailed as jazz royalty, this drummer and percussionist spent his formative years playing with Wynton and Branford Marsalis. Watts now commands equal attention as a composer and band leader, expertly stewarding the considerable talents of the award-winning musicians who round out his Quartet: Gregoire Manet (harmonica), Yunior Terry (bass), and Paul Bollenbach (guitar).\n\nTickets: $25–$100\n\nAll proceeds from the concert will benefit Friends of March, a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization dedicated to raising funds to enhance Francis Andrew March Elementary School on College Hill in Easton. Ticket prices are pay-what-you-can-afford.\n\nLearn more about the evening on the Friends of March website."
