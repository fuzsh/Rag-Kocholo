        "text": "Focusing on the music and influence of jazz iconoclast, Thelonius Monk, veteran jazz composer & instrumentalists, Phillip Johnston & Peter Dasent have teamed up to present 'Playing ith Monk'. This jazz duo of piano and saxophone performs a unique repertoire drawn from iconic compositions of Monk, both the well-known and the obscure, as well as original tunes, both new and old, from the two composersâ catalogues that are inspired orÂ influenced by Monkâs work.Â The music is swinging, bluesy and spiky, as Monk would have liked it - be sure to be at the Blue Mountains' debut of this duo's latest duo.\n\n'PLAYING WITH MONK' w/ PHILLIP JOHNSTON & PETER DASENTÂ // Saturday, 11 June 2022 // Doors 6:00 pm // Tickets: $94.50 ea incl. 2-Course Meal\n\nLocation:Â Pigeon Lane @Â GalleryONE88, Katoomba. 186-188 Katoomba St, Katoomba\n\nTicket price includes a 2-course meal // This is a seated performance // BYO alcohol // COVID-Safe Event.Â We recommend that you visit our good friends at Leura Cellars en route to GalleryONE88, who provide an exquisite selection of wines, beer, and spirits, including locally brewed beersÂ from 'Mountain Culture' and ciders from 'Hillbilly'.\n\nPlease read the event information on this page very carefully, as information about COVID-19 restrictions, menu and 'Terms & Conditions',Â will be provided below.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/ PLAYING WITH MONKÂ /\n\n'Playing With Monk' is a jazz duo of piano and saxophone, focused on the music and influence of jazz iconoclast Thelonious Monk. This new project for the two veteran composer/instrumentalists consists of a unique repertoire drawn from the iconic compositions of Thelonious Monk, both the well-known and the obscure, as well as original tunes both new and old from the two composersâ catalogues that are inspired/influenced by Monkâs work. The music is swinging, bluesy and spiky, as Monk would have liked it.\n\nYou may know New Zealand Ã©migrÃ© Peter Dasent from his film music compositions (including Peter Jacksonâs Heavenly Creatures and Meet The Feebles), his long tenure as music director/on-screen pianist for ABCâs long-running âPlay Schoolâ, his Eastside radio show âOne Size Fits Allâ, or his recordings of the music of Nino Rota or with his longstanding band The Umbrellas. https://www.peterdasent.com\n\nYou may know native New Yorker Phillip Johnston from his film scoring career (Paul Mazurskyâs Faithful, Henry Beanâs Noise, Philip Haasâs The Music of Chance), his numerous festival appearances (Sydney Film Festival, Melbourne Festival, MONA FOMA, Sydney Vivid), his silent film scores, his 20 recordings as a leader, or his local bands The Coolerators, The Greasy Chicken Orchestra or SNAP Sax Quartet. https://phillipjohnston.com/\n\nThey are co-leaders of the early jazz repertory band The Greasy Chicken Orchestra, who are in their 7th year of regular performances at Sydneyâs Foundry 616. Johnstonâs New York band The Microscopic Septetâs 2010 recording Friday The 13th: The Micros Play Monk (Cuneiform) was given 4 stars, made an Editorâs Pick and called âa love letter to Monkâ by Downbeat Magazine.\n\nThis new duo is the latest in a long history of collaboration between Dasent and Johnston on new and inventive projects that combine originality and a deep love of the breadth of jazz history.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/ THE PIGEON LANEÂ EXPERIENCE /\n\nWhilst many events promise a 'speakeasy' experience, no other venue in the Blue Mountains does it quite likeÂ 'Pigeon Lane', Gallery ONE88's live music quarter. Why you ask? Well, you won't find the entrance to this space on Katoomba's main drag . . . you need to take a stroll down Katoomba's 'Art Street', aka Beverly Place, and with so much visual candy on display, you won't quite know where you're going. Walking past the ever-changing tapestry of street art, rated as one of the 'Top 10 Things to Do in Katoomba' according to TripAdvisor, you need to find aÂ green doorÂ at the rear of the gallery. Don't expect a big neon sign or a grand entryway though -Â it helps to bring someone who has been here before and keep your eyes peeled. Once you cross the threshold, you will pass through a peculiarÂ ticketing booth, a quirkyÂ corner bar (although the venue doesn't yet have a liquor licence - so it's BYO) and enter Pigeon Lane proper.\n\nJust like the eclectic underground venues of Paris or New York, this space has antique chandeliers, timber floors and exposed brick,Â a small stage framed with red velvet curtains, individual tables, and plenty of artwork and vintage curiositiesÂ everywhere to pique your roving interest. The acoustics in this space are divine and the vibe casual, which is the perfect storm for bringing out engaging and emotiveÂ performances out of every musician that graces this stage. With the likes of Steve Kilbey (The Church), Jak Housden (The Whitlams),Â Eugene 'Hideaway' Bridges, Lloyd Swanton (The Necks),Â Sandy Evans (10 Part Invention), Paul Cutlan, Gary Daley, Trish Delaney-Brown (The Idea of North), George Washingmachine,Â James Greening and many more having played in this room, the quality of music is second to none. You won't want to miss a show here as there aren't many rooms like this.Â\n\n>>> To find Pigeon Lane, walk down Beverly Place in Katoomba, aka Art Street,Â and look for the Green Door at the back of GalleryONE88 (don't worry,Â you'll find us ð). There's some parking in the lane and you can dropÂ your passengers off at the door if you're feeling chivalrous. Find a map here.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/ COVID-19 CONTINGENCIES /\n\nPigeon Lane & GalleryONE88 are both 'COVID-Safe' spaces and have contingencies in place in the event COVID-19 restrictions are increased. This meansÂ that this event is going ahead unless NSW Health prevents this sort of activity from taking place, or ALL performers are unable to attend. And not to worry, in the case of the event being cancelled, every patron will get a full refund without needing to ask. We know that many events have given their patrons a credit when an event has been postponed - we won't do that, so you've got no reason not to book ð.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/ THE MEAL /\n\nVictor Peralta is both a celebrated artist and an executive cook, who will be curating a dining experience like no other. Featuring two majestic and generousÂ courses, meals will be delivered to your table by alternate drop (one option for you and the other option for your partner)Â between sets. Dessert, tea, and coffee will also be available to purchase on the night.\n\n- Please Note: Menu to be updated closer to event -\n\n- Entrees -\n\nPlatter of Mixed Pinchos: A traditional dish from the North of Spain closely resembling 'Tapas', 'Pinchos' areÂ usually eaten in bars or taverns as a small snack while hanging out with friends or relatives. Thus, they have a strong socializing component and in the Basque country and Navarre, they are usually regarded as a cornerstone of local culture and society; or\n\nPotato Gnocchi in House Pesto SauceÂ (Vegetarian): This gnocchi is served lightly tossed in our house-made fresh basil & pine nut pesto sauce, and sprinkled with shavings of matured parmesan.\n\n- Mains -\n\nMega Meat Balls: Prime beef and spicy chorizo baked slow in a secret ONE88 herb and spiced tomato au jus until tender and mouth-watering. Served alongside al dente pastaÂ and sprinkled with shavings of matured parmesan; or\n\nRed Lentil & Cauliflower DahlÂ (Vegetarian): This curry is perfect for those nights where warmth and just a little spice is needed. Served alongside jasmine rice and naan bread.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/ REFRESHMENTS & LICENSING /\n\nPigeon Lane is currentlyÂ BYO only, however, has a dedicated cafe during the day and has an extensive range of non-alcoholic beverages, as well as fresh espresso coffee from Blue Mountains Coffee Roasters. If you're in the mood for a little dessert, Pigeon Lane has also got you covered!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/ THE SCHEDULE /\n\nDate: Saturday, 11 June 2022.\n\nVenue: Pigeon Lane @Â GalleryONE88, 186-188 Katoomba St. Katoomba\n\nDoors Open:Â 6:00 pm\n\nFirst Course Served:Â 6:30 pm\n\nFirst Set:Â 7:00-7:45 pm\n\nSecond Course & Intermission:Â 7:45 - 8:45 pm\n\nSecond Set:Â 8:45-9:30 pm\n\nTickets: $94.50 per person includingÂ a 2-course meal\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIN CASE OF COVID-19Â RESTRICTIONS CHANGES:\n\nIn the case of restrictions increasing, Pigeon Lane already has a contingency plan based on the 4-square-metre rule, and the show will go ahead upstairs in GalleryONE88.\n\nIn the case of restrictions increasing beyond theÂ 4-square-metre rule, the show would likely be cancelled and each attendee would receive a full refund. Every effort will be taken to proceedÂ with the show, however, and each attendee will be contacted with options.Â\n\nIn short:Â there is no risk in booking event tickets withÂ Music in the Mountains. We're in this for the long haul and are optimistic about the future of live music!\n\nTERMS, CONDITIONS & CANCELLATIONS:"
