        "text": "\"The music of Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Paul Simon, James Brown, Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton and The Rolling Stones all has a similar tone running throughout. It’s no coincidence that saxophonist David Sanborn has played with all of them.\"\n\n– NPR\n\nUniversally known as one of the most iconic saxophonists of the current age, David Sanborn is a jazz musician at heart, but has transcended genres and musical boundaries throughout his entire career. Sanborn has released 24 albums, won six Grammy Awards, and has had eight gold albums and one platinum.\n\nRolling Stone says, ‘”Among the great saxophonists of the past four decades, David Sanborn has earned an identity all his own. He’s jazz, he’s funk, he’s soul, he’s pop, he’s blues, he’s rock. Most remarkably, he excels in each of these genres with a voice that is forceful and tender, sensuous and subtle.”\n\nBand Members:\n\nGeoffrey Keezer, keyboards\n\nBilly Kilson, drums\n\nBob DeBoo, bass\n\nJoin us for dinner before or during the show.
