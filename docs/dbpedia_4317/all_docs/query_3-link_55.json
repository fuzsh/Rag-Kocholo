Along with his wife Françoise Mouly, he founded RAW, the acclaimed avant-garde comics magazine that first serialized his Holocaust narrative Maus, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1992.

In 2011, he won the Grand Prix at the Angoulême International Comics Festival, marking only the third time an American has received the honor.\n\nA saxophonist and composer of jazz and new music, Phillip Johnston has been a significant figure in the underground music scene of New York’s downtown since the beginning of the 1980s.

He currently performs in Australia with Phillip Johnston and the Coolerators  among others.
