        "text": "Chris Phillips is widely known as one of the best vocalists in the area. He has been a staple of the local music scene for many years, performing hard rock with 21 Guns, showcasing his softer side as part of an acoustic duo with Mark Beauchemin, and running a successful DJ / Karaoke business for decades. With The Manatees, Chris gets to truly show off his range - moving effortlessly between soulful renditions of Spinners classics, crooning with spot-on covers of Chris Stapleton hits, and rocking out to the likes of ZZ Top and The Who.\n\nTim has been a Manatee for more than half his life. He has brought an array of technical advances in sound and special effects over the years, as well as a unique blend of rock, blues, and jazz-influenced guitar techniques. He is not only renowned for his explosive electric guitar solos, he is also a founding partner of Ambient Sound, Inc., and has lent his technical expertise to artists ranging from national touring acts to local bands.\n\nSteve attended the University of Rhode Island where he first joined \"What's Up, Bach?\", a reggae-based original band. Through the years, his interest in classic, jam-based and progressive rock helped solidify his musicianship. He formed Sunshine Smokey and the Rhythm Juice, and later The Continentals before having the privilege to play with Erik Narwhal and the Manatees.\n\nMike is truly a local drumming legend. He first learned to play drums at age five, making a drum kit out of containers and coffee tins. He worked hard trying to copy the moves of his idols, Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, and his father Mike Stamp Sr. Some of the bands and musicians he has played with are James Montgomery, Professor Harp, Young Neil and the Vipers and Erik Narwhal and the Manatees."
