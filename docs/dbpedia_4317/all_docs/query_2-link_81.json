        "text": "Charles Campbell, an Anderson, Indiana, native, earned a doctorate in philology from the University of Strassburg in 1905, spent a year at Harvard upon his return, and, in 1906, was appointed instructor of German at Indiana University. Campbell was promoted to assistant professor in 1908, but his true passion was music.\n\nIn 1907, he arranged for a recital of the Schellschmidt Quartet of Indianapolis, the proceeds of which established a music fund “to lead ultimately to the equipment of a school of music in the university.” In 1909, he offered a series of non-credit lectures on the history of music. He conducted The Mikado at Bloomington's Harris Grand Theater in 1909 and the operetta Robin Hood in 1910.\n\nEarly course offerings included Orchestra, Chorus, and the History and Development of Music, and early enrollment jumped from 214 the first year of operation to 281 the second year.\n\nBarzille Merrill was a professional violinist, conductor, and composer. When he accepted the position as head of the IU Department of Music in 1919, he also accepted the challenge of creating a sophisticated music school in rural Indiana.\n\nHe came into it with a vision: he viewed the school not only as a “solace for the soul” and place of learning, but as a business that required advertising. After some extremely successful ad campaigns, overcrowding became a problem. Merrill campaigned for a new music building, which was dedicated in 1937 and renamed Merrill Hall in 1989.\n\n1937\n\nMusic Building (now Merrill Hall) dedicated\n\nThough Dean Merrill oversaw the remodeling of the school’s resident music building, Mitchell Hall, enough problems remained (noise carried from performance rooms to classrooms, the building was too hot in the summer, etc.) that a new building became a necessity. Merrill secured a grant and convinced the university to help with the remainder of the cost.\n\nThe new Music Building (which comprised three levels and a full basement) was constructed using local limestone, decorated with the names of great composers, and incorporated elaborate soundproofing. The top floor was partitioned into 48 practice rooms. Other floors contained studios, classrooms, a large rehearsal room, the Music Library, a “radio and recording room,” a music museum, and Recital Hall, where the first concert was given on January 15, 1937.\n\n1938\n\nBarzille Merrill retires\n\nRobert L. Sanders appointed dean\n\nAt 32 years old, Robert Sanders remains the school’s youngest-ever dean. The charismatic organist, conductor, and composer had no administrative experience prior to his appointment at IU, but his proven performance abilities and people skills gave him an edge over the other candidates.\n\nFirst on his agenda after becoming dean was expanding the faculty, next was a review and appraisal of the school’s condition and position. Through his efforts, the school gained membership in the National Association of Schools of Music the same year and built the Hall of Music (now the Indiana University Auditorium).\n\nMetropolitan Opera Company visits IU for the first time, performs Aida\n\nOnce the auditorium was completed, comptroller Ward Biddle began campaigning for the Met to perform at IU during its spring tour. Biddle and Lee Norvelle, head of speech and drama in the English Department, arranged for the Met to perform Aida.\n\nThe April 13 performance drew spectators from as far away as Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Louisville. After the performance, Edward Johnson, general manager of the Met, said, “The Metropolitan likes Indiana University—and Bloomington. So, we are not saying ‘goodbye,’ but only aurevoir . . . When we again leave New York, Indiana University need only beckon.”\n\n1946\n\nMet returns in April—and again for the next 15 years, presenting two operas each visit\n\n1947\n\nRobert Sanders resigns as dean June 30 (resigns from school in August 1948)\n\nWilfred C. Bain appointed dean July 1\n\nWilfred Bain came to IU with impressive credentials; as head of the music department at North Texas, he had expanded faculty, increased enrollment, and added three choirs, a symphony orchestra, concert band, string sinfonietta, and harp ensemble. When he arrived at IU, Bain dove in with the same energy and drive he had exhibited at North Texas and Houghton (where he was also head of the music department).\n\nFrom the start, the charismatic leader had a clear vision—and the power to make others see it and believe it. One of his goals was to ensure that music students received a comprehensive, well-rounded education that included a broad base of knowledge of traditional liberal studies (arts, sciences, and humanities) and trained students to think critically. He also shifted focus to orchestral performance and production of opera.\n\nNumber of music majors reaches 296\n\nMadrigal Dinners established\n\n1948\n\nSpring Festival inaugurates IU Auditorium organ and includes first fully staged opera of the Bain era, The Tales of Hoffman, with Hans Busch as stage director\n\nSchool supplies chorus for Chicago performances of Verdi’s Requiem\n\nBerkshire Quartet becomes resident quartet\n\nEast Hall opened\n\n1949\n\nFirst performance of Wagner’s Parsifal (repeated annually through 1969)\n\n1950\n\nNew Republic review of Parsifal brings production to national attention\n\nSinging Hoosiers formed\n\nThe Beaux Arts Trio, founded by pianist and faculty member Menahem Pressler, violinist Daniel Guilet, and cellist Bernard Greenhouse, debuted at the prestigious 1955 Berkshire Music Festival, today known as the Tanglewood Festival.\n\nThe trio evolved since its early roots: Guilet was replaced by Isidore Cohen in 1969, who, in turn, was replaced by Ida Kavafian in 1992. Greenhouse was replaced by Peter Wiley in 1987. The last iteration of the trio (it disbanded in June 2008) consisted of Pressler, violinist Daniel Hope, and cellist Antonio Meneses.\n\nThe group of highly acclaimed musicians—seen as one of chamber music’s most powerful collaborations—played a major and ongoing role in programs of significant cultural and educational centers throughout North America, with annual concert series at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, Celebrity Series of Boston, and Library of Congress.\n\nAfter East Hall burned down in 1968 (much to the delight of Dean Bain, who had been campaigning for a new performance space), the Musical Arts Center (MAC) was completed in 1972 at a cost of $11.2 million. Key gifts came from Mr. and Mrs. Krannert and Elsie Sweeney; Hoagy Carmichael underwrote the building’s foyer, which bears his name; and Herman B Wells and the Bains each donated $25,000 or more.\n\nThe first performance in the space (known among students as “Fort Bain” or “Salle de Bain”) was a January 29, 1972, staging of Don Giovanni, but the building wasn’t dedicated until April, providing time for Bain to contact music critics from across the country. A Dedication Week Festival (April 15-21) included the opera Hercules, two performances by the Philharmonic Orchestra, two carillon recitals, and two pieces by faculty members.\n\nAfter the performances, John Ardoin of The Dallas Morning News wrote “a small town tucked away in a corner of Indiana now boasts one of the major performing arts facilities to be found in the United States.”\n\nCharles H. Webb appointed dean July 1\n\nIn 1964, Charles Webb, an accomplished pianist, organist, and choral director, was appointed assistant dean. Prior to that appointment, he was assistant to the dean of music at Southern Methodist University and had spent two years in the Air Force as a personnel services officer.\n\nWhen Webb took control of the School of Music in 1973, he made changes in Bain’s opera policies. First, Webb changed Bain’s policy of casting faculty members in key opera roles in favor of casting only student performers. Next was a move away from staging all of the operas in English.\n\nThrough his stature as a performer, Webb won the respect of the performance faculty, from whom he frequently sought opinions. He was also known as a great listener; Webb understood the need for faculty to express themselves and be excited about their jobs and personal performance opportunities. In addition, he sought to turn the School of Music into an internationally known program.\n\n1974\n\nAndrew Porter first visits the school to review Busoni’s Doktor Faust. In 1980, he declares IU Opera Theater “just about the most serious and consistently satisfying of all American opera companies” in The New Yorker.\n\n1975\n\nChange survey ranks School of Music first in the nation\n\nOpera Theater stages first non-English production, Rigoletto, and presents The World on the Moon at Kennedy Center’s Haydnfest\n\n1978\n\nSchool of Music Council created\n\n1979\n\nChronicle of Higher Education survey ranks the school’s faculty the nation’s best\n\nMusic Practice Building opened\n\n1980\n\nEarly Music (now Historical Performance) Institute established\n\nIn 1979, Dean Webb recruited Thomas Binkley—a major figure in early music, who was teaching at Stanford at the time—as professor of music. A lutenist, Binkley had studied in Munich, where he founded the Studio der fruhen Musik, a quartet that made many successful recordings and had several world tours over the next 18 years. Within a year of his arrival at IU, Binkley became founding director of the Early Music Institute.\n\n1981 School’s New York City performance series inaugurated with five events, including full-scale opera production in the Metropolitan Opera House\n\nIn November 1978, Dean Webb began working toward the establishment of a performance series in New York, at the suggestion of several people at a meeting of the National Endowment for the Arts. The IU Foundation offered guidance on fundraising and agreed to underwrite expenses not covered by ticket sales and donations.\n\nThe elements finally came together in 1981, and the school kicked off the performance series with Bohuslav Martinů’s The GreekPassion at the Metropolitan Opera House, an orchestral concert at Avery Fisher Hall, chamber music at Carnegie Recital Hall, and concerts by the Chamber Choir and New Music Ensemble at the Abraham Goodman House.\n\nThe performances were met with acclaim from New York reviewers. “Several times during the three (events) . . . I had to remind myself that these were student forces, not professional groups,” wrote Nicholas Kenyon of The New Yorker. “Whatever could be done for The Greek Passion, the Opera Theater did with assured professional skill and respect for the material . . . The orchestra played impressively . . . The large cast performed with ease and security,” wrote Peter G. Davis in The New York Times.\n\n1983\n\nMusic from Indiana achieves national syndication on American Public Radio\n\nIn 1980, the School of Music launched a weekly radio chamber music series produced by WFIU. In its first year, the series featured faculty and student performers and was broadcast on six Indiana stations. By 1982 (and through 1984), Music from Indiana had achieved national syndication on American Public Radio, and in 1983, the number of stations carrying the program had jumped to 54.\n\n1988Two school orchestras in residence at summer music festivals in France, while another orchestra presents Leonard Bernstein’s Mass at Tanglewood as part of Boston Symphony’s celebration of his seventieth birthday\n\n1989\n\nPhilharmonic Orchestra participates in opening festivities of the Bastille Opera House\n\nGuitar Department founded by Ernesto Bitetti\n\n1990\n\nOpera Theater presents John Eaton’s The Cry of Clytaemnestra at Moscow State Conservatory\n\n1992\n\nSchool revives Bernstein’s 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue at the Kennedy Center\n\n1994\n\nU.S. News & World Report survey ranks school’s Master of Music program first in nation (alongside Eastman and Juilliard)\n\n1995\n\nBess Meshulam Simon Music Library and Recital Center open\n\nIndiana entrepreneur Melvin Simon, owner of Simon Property Group and the Indiana Pacers, and his wife, Bren, give $2.1 million dollars in honor of his first wife, Bess, who died of cancer in 1977.\n\n1996\n\nThe William and Gayle Cook Music Library opens in the Simon Music Center in January, a state-of-the-art facility designed to combine new technologies with access to traditional materials in support of all levels of music research and study.\n\nIU Variations Digital Music Library system established in partnership with IBM in April\n\n1997 Charles Webb retires June 30\n\n\"As we look back on 100 years of a strong commitment to the highest possible level of learning, for all who entrust their educational advancement to the IU Jacobs School of Music, let us now look forward to a second century of our pledge of hard work, high goals, and inspiration for all who study and learn in this great educational institution.
