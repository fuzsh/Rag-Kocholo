        "text": "Post by mattbbtalk on\n\nFirst I want to say that I think Bruce is a brilliant musician and songwriter.\n\nBruce had a successful career before he joined the Beach Boys. This weekend I listened to Sunflower, Surf's Up, Carl and the Passions, and Holland. One thing I noticed was that though Bruce's songs are nice, they do not seem to fit on a BB album. In fact, they do not seem to fit on any Rock and Roll album. I started to wonder if Bruce could have had a career writing songs for singers in the Easy Listening genre and be successful? We know that he was very successful with I write the songs. The songs on Sunflower written by Bruce sound like they could have been hits for the Carpenters. Disney Girls does as well. But they do not fit on a BB album in my opinion.\n\nDid Bruce settle? Did being part of the Beach Boys stunt his musical career? Again, I do not mean any disrespect to Bruce. I just wonder if joining the Beach Boys was good for him from a musical point of view. His songs on BB albums all sound like solo songs. He sings most of them if not all, and he did not collaborate very much with members of the band. Maybe he could have written more songs and albums if he was not in the band.\n\nI noticed when I listened to CATP and Holland that I was not missing hearing a Bruce song on the albums. Blondie and Ricky's songs fit in better than his songs in my opinion.\n\nI would like to know your thoughts on these questions. Did the Beach Boys stifle Bruce? Did he settle? Did he hurt the Beach Boys at all?\n\nThanks to all who tuned in to our review of Sunflower tonight. It was so much fun!!\n\nPost by ian on\n\nI think Bruce, once he returned to the BBs in 1978, made his decision and I assume he is fine with it. It’s about motivation and personally I get it. It’s fair to ask why he has put out very few compositions since then but he may be content to make music at home and not care about whether it is out there in the world of commerce-sort of like Brian in the early 70s (according to Bruce he’d go over to Brian’s and he’d play some amazing songs on the piano and then not record them). Not at all to compare myself but having written two books I am always asked what is next but I have no burning desire to put out more and maybe Bruce is the same. He just enjoys traveling with The Beach Boys and singing harmony and no longer has greater ambitions-having satisfied them in the 1970s\n\nPost by drbeachboy (Dirk) on\n\nI think Bruce, once he returned to the BBs in 1978, made his decision and I assume he is fine with it.

If Bruce really had great aspirations, he had his chance in the 70’s when he left the band, but he chose to return in late 1978 and has remained some 40 plus years later. I think he’s quite happy being a Beach Boy.\n\nPost by Autotune on\n\nSelf-defined as the schlockmeister of saccharine, it’s obvious that Bruce set foot in the So. Cal. rock scene long before the BBs formed. That he evolved into a songwriter with ambitions of contributing to the Great American Songbook is obvious also, and the extent to which such ambitions collided with his being a member of the Beach Boys is not entirely clear —but can be hinted at.\n\nI think he realized that the family structure of the group was hermetic to a high degree and he tried, for as long as he could, to take full advantage of the notion that at best all he could aspire to be was a glorified journeyman. That he set one foot inside and one foot outside the confines of the BBs is probably the result of his realization that he’d never be fully embraced by the group. He took some blame, but probably realized he had no option.\n\nHe had to do his full cycle before rejoining in the late 70s. And I suspect that his Grammy had a lot to do with fulfilling his expectations of succeeding as a respectable songwriter. After lifting the award and putting out a solo record, he was able to resume his BB membership.\n\nPost by nater on\n\nCommon thoughts I hear in the BBs world go like this...\n\n\"How could Bruce write and produce dozens and dozens of songs in the 50's and 60's, and write so little after returning to the band?\"\n\n\"How could Bruce be such a gifted keyboardist, to not utilize his skills on stage?\"\n\nEtc, etc....\n\nI think it's those are very interesting questions to ponder. But many people ask those questions with a hint of negativity, like they're criticizing Bruce. (Not that I think that was the intention of the thread.)\n\nI think to say Bruce \"gave up\" or \"settled\" is to say that his job is easy, which it definitely isn't. Bruce sings some of the hardest and highest parts of the harmony stack every night. He adds so much authenticity to the vocal blend of Mike's band. Don't believe me? Check out the 2017 shows he missed. Without Bruce, the current BBs touring band starts to sound much more like Mike & friends, than the BBs. He adds that secret sauce of authenticity. I think Brian's band, harmonically, sounded like Brian & friends, until Al and Blondie joined- adding a similar \"secret sauce\" kind of authenticity to the blend.\n\nAnd while I don't think this has been brought up yet, I feel the need to address--- NO, Bruce's keyboard is not unplugged. He plays the main piano on GV, Darlin, Be True, the DX7 sliding sound on Hawaii, and his signature \"FM\" sound as a musical blanket throughout the show. Is he usually super prominent? No. But his \"keyboard is always on, not a prop\" and that's a quote told to me by Scott Totten. (I will attach examples of Bruce's playing at the end of my post.)\n\nBruce's studio contributions have varied since him rejoining. He obviously was MVP in the LA-KTSA era, producing those albums, which I actually enjoy a lot and think he did a good job on. For BB85, Still Cruisin', S&S & TWGMTR, and all of Mike's BMG solo albums, he fashioned himself as pretty much solely a harmony singer (with the exception of SBILA on 85) I think his vocals are important to all of those albums--- especially S&S, where he's all over the place harmony wise. SIP is the only album since KTSA where he took more of an active role, playing keyboards and assisting in the production, being excited by and pushing for the utilization of recording on a DAW setup.\n\nAnd nowadays, he's writing and producing with Skrillex. Also backstage at a very recent BBs concert, Bruce told me about another *very popular* modern artist that he has been writing songs for, that unfortunately I can't say the name of on here. But rest assured, there is more Bruce Johnston music in the pipeline. From what he has told me, he is still very active in the studio.\n\nExamples of Bruce's keyboard playing with M&B band...\n\nHawaii (Listen for the DX7 sliding chords in the choruses)\n\nGood Vibrations (Tack Piano while Tim plays organ/theremin)\n\nDarlin (Piano while Tim plays the Horns)\n\nPost by mattbbtalk on\n\nCommon thoughts I hear in the BBs world go like this...\n\n\"How could Bruce write and produce dozens and dozens of songs in the 50's and 60's, and write so little after returning to the band?\"\n\n\"How could Bruce be such a gifted keyboardist, to not utilize his skills on stage?\"\n\nEtc, etc....\n\nI think it's those are very interesting questions to ponder.

(Not that I think that was the intention of the thread.)\n\nI think to say Bruce \"gave up\" or \"settled\" is to say that his job is easy, which it definitely isn't. Bruce sings some of the hardest and highest parts of the harmony stack every night. He adds so much authenticity to the vocal blend of Mike's band. Don't believe me? Check out the 2017 shows he missed. Without Bruce, the current BBs touring band starts to sound much more like Mike & friends, than the BBs. He adds that secret sauce of authenticity. I think Brian's band, harmonically, sounded like Brian & friends, until Al and Blondie joined- adding a similar \"secret sauce\" kind of authenticity to the blend.\n\nAnd while I don't think this has been brought up yet, I feel the need to address--- NO, Bruce's keyboard is not unplugged. He plays the main piano on GV, Darlin, Be True, the DX7 sliding sound on Hawaii, and his signature \"FM\" sound as a musical blanket throughout the show. Is he usually super prominent? No. But his \"keyboard is always on, not a prop\" and that's a quote told to me by Scott Totten. (I will attach examples of Bruce's playing at the end of my post.)\n\nBruce's studio contributions have varied since him rejoining. He obviously was MVP in the LA-KTSA era, producing those albums, which I actually enjoy a lot and think he did a good job on. For BB85, Still Cruisin', S&S & TWGMTR, and all of Mike's BMG solo albums, he fashioned himself as pretty much solely a harmony singer (with the exception of SBILA on 85) I think his vocals are important to all of those albums--- especially S&S, where he's all over the place harmony wise. SIP is the only album since KTSA where he took more of an active role, playing keyboards and assisting in the production, being excited by and pushing for the utilization of recording on a DAW setup.\n\nAnd nowadays, he's writing and producing with Skrillex. Also backstage at a very recent BBs concert, Bruce told me about another *very popular* modern artist that he has been writing songs for, that unfortunately I can't say the name of on here. But rest assured, there is more Bruce Johnston music in the pipeline. From what he has told me, he is still very active in the studio.\n\nExamples of Bruce's keyboard playing with M&B band...\n\nHawaii (Listen for the DX7 sliding chords in the choruses)\n\nGood Vibrations (Tack Piano while Tim plays organ/theremin)\n\nDarlin (Piano while Tim plays the Horns)\n\nThanks for your response. I love Bruce. I think he is a brilliant musician and songwriter. I just wonder if his talents could have been better utilized if he did not stay with the Beach Boys. Love all the clips you sent!\n\nPost by mattbbtalk on\n\nSelf-defined as the schlockmeister of saccharine, it’s obvious that Bruce set foot in the So. Cal. rock scene long before the BBs formed. That he evolved into a songwriter with ambitions of contributing to the Great American Songbook is obvious also, and the extent to which such ambitions collided with his being a member of the Beach Boys is not entirely clear —but can be hinted at.\n\nI think he realized that the family structure of the group was hermetic to a high degree and he tried, for as long as he could, to take full advantage of the notion that at best all he could aspire to be was a glorified journeyman. That he set one foot inside and one foot outside the confines of the BBs is probably the result of his realization that he’d never be fully embraced by the group. He took some blame, but probably realized he had no option.\n\nHe had to do his full cycle before rejoining in the late 70s. And I suspect that his Grammy had a lot to do with fulfilling his expectations of succeeding as a respectable songwriter. After lifting the award and putting out a solo record, he was able to resume his BB membership.\n\nI have read a few different things that says The BB tried to get Bruce out of the band. If it is true, I wonder if it was for personal reasons or because of music differences. Again, I admire Bruce. This thread was not at all meant to bash him.\n\nPost by mattbbtalk on\n\nI think Bruce, once he returned to the BBs in 1978, made his decision and I assume he is fine with it. It’s about motivation and personally I get it. It’s fair to ask why he has put out very few compositions since then but he may be content to make music at home and not care about whether it is out there in the world of commerce-sort of like Brian in the early 70s (according to Bruce he’d go over to Brian’s and he’d play some amazing songs on the piano and then not record them). Not at all to compare myself but having written two books I am always asked what is next but I have no burning desire to put out more and maybe Bruce is the same. He just enjoys traveling with The Beach Boys and singing harmony and no longer has greater ambitions-having satisfied them in the 1970s\n\nFair enough!\n\nPost by boogieboarder on\n\nSelf-defined as the schlockmeister of saccharine, it’s obvious that Bruce set foot in the So.

This thread was not at all meant to bash him.\n\nI've decided to edit my post to remove my negative opinion of Bruce's songs in The Beach Boys. After hearing Sunflower and Surf's Up again this week, I find his melodies aren't bad at all - they are sticking in my brain. When you start having band members other than Brian Wilson contribute to Beach Boys albums, the songs are going to sound different. You wouldn't want or expect them to just try to copy Brian's style. The whole idea is to be true to themselves.\n\nPost by filledeplage on\n\nI think Bruce has been an important member of the group and I personally disagree that Blondie's and Ricky's songs fit better. Their 2 on CATP are complete anomalies, and Disney Girls and Deirdre both fit the group better imo.\n\nBruce's voice also fit well with the harmonies and it seems like there wasn't too much kerfuffle when he was audible on California Girls and God Only Knows.\n\nYes, he probably did settle to some extent and has been content to create at home without needing to release stuff for the public. The group needed him the late 70s though and he has played an important role just by being there.\n\nHis work is not so far from some of the Pet Sounds stuff - just placed on Sunflower. I’m Waiting For The Day?

So much changes as you age. If you watch Bruce live circa '70-'71, the guy is carrying a lot of water with the live band. He is doing integral stuff on the bass and organ. After '78 his onstage contributions are so minor that the question has been asked if his keyboard is plugged in (and I found the samples above fascinating, thanks for that, as I'd been making similar discoveries of hidden Bruce onstage contributions...but the fact is they've pretty peripheral to the band).\n\nI think a young Bruce had a lot to prove, and he would have been very bored in his current role. The older Bruce has a very pleasant, easy and lucrative day job that he has retired to after being a producer, writer and industry workhouse for many years. Ten years ago I did not understand how he'd be satisfied with that. Having made similar adjustments to my own thinking, it makes perfect sense to me now.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI think Bruce has been an important member of the group and I personally disagree that Blondie's and Ricky's songs fit better.

A&M signed him around 1970. In '71 he delivered a fantastic album called WINGS. He composed the music and Paul Williams wrote the lyrics. It was an ambitious record. It's worth checking out.\n\nPost by filledeplage on\n\nI think this is a fascinating question Matt and it makes me think I ought to do a whole show about it myself some day, because there's so many dimensions here to ponder.\n\nI'll just limit myself to one comment on it that's easiest for me to personally grab on to.

In a symphony setting - yes, 100% very impressive on that big grand piano. The Paris show in 1969 is a good example. Later 70s, the stage seemed much “busier” with other support musicians. Mostly, a matter of the venue set up. College shows in the 70s - no grand piano generally and the conventional lineup. It is kinda interesting and I was blessed to see a lot of those variations in venues.\n\nPost by andrewhickey on\n\nI don't think Bruce \"settled\" any more than any of the other BBs. Bruce was never the most prolific songwriter in the world -- he wrote a fair amount in the early sixties, but much of that was straightforward pastiche, not anything that seems like it was particularly inspired or important to him.\n\nI get the impression that Bruce doesn't particularly care about being a lead singer or a songwriter, but that he likes being a part of a collaborative process, whether that's in the studio doing production or harmony singing or playing a piano part, or singing harmony and playing keyboards on stage. Oddly for someone who had a reputation for having a ton of ambition and hustle when he was young, that ambition doesn't ever seem to have been for his own work per se, as much as having the ambition to be part of a \"winning team\".\n\nI don't think his songs stick out any more than any of the other members' as not fitting the group's style, either -- and I think his contributions to the group have a better hit-rate than most of the other group members'. Of the seven songs he's contributed to the group's albums (eight if you count co-writing \"Somewhere Near Japan\"), I'd say \"Disney Girls\" is an absolute classic, \"She Believes in Love Again\" is one of the best things on a not-great album, and only \"Endless Harmony\" is an outright dud.\n\nPost by nater on\n\nI totally agree that Bruce seems way more happy in the team member role, than the star.\n\nWhile I think his solo albums are great, he was never pushing them as hard as he would for the music he collaborated on with others.\n\nBruce's real strengths lie in being an amazing team member. Giving a song or two to what would be an otherwise still amazing album. Singing harmony. Playing \"rhythm keyboards\" or \"comping\" (in a jazz terminology, not recording) on the keys instead of playing the solos. He has all the skills and chops to be front and center. He proves it with his leads and amazing moments of instrumental virtuosity through the years. But he's a team player.\n\nI think it's definitely another great point that Bruce as a young man had a lot to prove. He wanted to produce, arrange, compose, conduct, perform--- And boy, did he do all those things impeccably over the years - both for for different artists and himself. Here's a list, to the best of my memory, for those who've lost track...\n\nThe Gamblers (playing on what many call the first Surf record, 'MoonDawg' to be covered by the BBs), Phil Spector (early HS years, as well as various instrumental contributions through the years), The Rip Chords, The Catalinas, The Beach Boys, Paul Revere & The Raiders, The Byrds (Ghost-production and playing as admitted in a recent interview promoting Hollywood Eden), Elton John, Pink Floyd, Peter Noone, America, Dick Dale, David Cassidy, Captain & Tennille, Roger McGuinn, Curt Boettcher, Jan & Dean, The Hot Doggers, Jeff Foskett, and has even had Frank Sinatra sing his song.\n\nBruce has fit more into one career than most could fit into a hundred. He almost seems omnipresent during the Rock and Roll era, playing and producing so many greats.\n\nAfter proving all this, I think the BBs provided both a comfortable and FUN outlet for Bruce. It keeps him young. He loves the music. He gets to sing and play keyboard regularly to keep his chops up. But he doesn't have to sing lead after lead, or have the stress of playing the solos or the counter melodies precisely note for note. He can just provide a musical cushion to the band, and round things out. It sounds much easier than it is. If Bruce was absent the band would sound weaker, but he isn't flashy at all, and is very pretty reserved with his keyboard playing, graciously letting the work of Timmy B to shine. Young Bruce had to prove he was the best keyboardist in the room. Old Bruce is happy to let the \"young, new\" talent shine, while he provides the bed for them to solo upon. His pre-78 keyboard playing always let you knew he was there and was pretty flashy. Since he rejoining, his keyboard serves the same purpose as Brian's piano did on a lot of the early Surf hits- buried beneath the guitars and drums, but enriching the harmony and adding energy.\n\nFor those who enjoy the samples---\n\nHere is an example of what a DX7 FM Piano (or clone) sounds AT 0:30\n\nNow watch these clips, at the moments I time stamp and listen closely...\n\nIn this performance of Do It Again, there is obviously no \"FM\" sound before Bruce arrives at his keyboard, and it isn't audible until you visably see him adjust the volume and begin playing at around 1:25, after \"place to gooo\" you can hear a DX7 stick out in the mix , playing this little blues lick, momentarily.\n\nDisney Girls\n\nX-Mas medley\n\nOnce you know what Bruce's keyboard sounds like- what to listen for in the mix- it becomes easier to pick him out."
