        "text": "The Needless Kiss – Transparent Quartet (Koch Jazz)\n\nBuy The Needless Kiss on CD Baby\n\nâThe Needless Kiss, the latest recording by Johnstonâs Transparent Quartet, is full of nineteen-fifties formalism (West Coast cool, Modern Jazz Quartet subtlety), which Johnston gleefully personalizes with sharp phrasings and free jazz tangents. Itâs all held together by Johnstonâs fine alto-saxophone work and superb soprano-saxophone playing, and by a drummerless unit that makes imaginative use of vibes, piano, baritone saxophone, and bass.â\n\nâSteve Futterman, The New Yorker.\n\nThe Merry Frolics of Satan – The Transparent Quartet (Koch/Asynchronous)\n\nBuy The Merry Frolics of Satan on CD Baby\n\n“Saxist Johnston is a conceptualist with a sense of humor and history. Here, he and the Transparent Quartet present spirited music for short films by silent-cinema pioneer Georges Melies. Jazz wriggles in, as do cabaret, klezmer, avant garde, and pop stylings evocative of the early 20th century, sounding fresh on the brink of the 21st.”\n\n– Josef Woodard, Entertainment Weekly\n\nPage of MadnessÂ – The Transparent Quartet (Asynchronous)\n\nBuy Page of Madness on CD Baby\n\n“…an engaging and absorbing piece of chamber jazz composition/improvisation by a highly skilled band.” – Mark Corroto, All About Jazz. (USA)\n\n“…one of the richest forms of written jazz, plucked from the air by the musicians with great intelligence and immense emotional power. “ – NoÃ«l Tachet, Improjazz (FRANCE)\n\n“…really excellent.” – Beppe Colli, Clouds and Clocks. (ITALY)\n\n“…like a clown gone bad…” -Dave Mandl, The Wire (UK)"
