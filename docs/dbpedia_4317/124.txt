âThe Needless Kiss, the latest recording by Johnstonâs Transparent Quartet, is full of nineteen-fifties formalism (West Coast cool, Modern Jazz Quartet subtlety), which Johnston gleefully personalizes with sharp phrasings and free jazz tangents. Itâs all held together by Johnstonâs fine alto-saxophone work and superb soprano-saxophone playing, and by a drummerless unit that makes imaginative use of vibes, piano, baritone saxophone, and bass.â

âSteve Futterman, The New Yorker.

“Saxist Johnston is a conceptualist with a sense of humor and history. Here, he and the Transparent Quartet present spirited music for short films by silent-cinema pioneer Georges Melies. Jazz wriggles in, as do cabaret, klezmer, avant garde, and pop stylings evocative of the early 20th century, sounding fresh on the brink of the 21st.”

– Josef Woodard, Entertainment Weekly
