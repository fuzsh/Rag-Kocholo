        "text": "Longtime collaborators Curren$y and Wiz Khalifa are a few days away from a new “2009” album.\n\nCurren$y releases a lot of music; this past year alone, he had seven projects — each varying in length — hit the streets. That said, a lot of people know him best from his many collaborations with megastar Wiz Khalifa. Together, they’ve teamed up several times in the last decade, putting out classic tracks like “Huey Newton” and “Rooftops.”\n\nIn recent years, they’ve featured one another on their solo projects — including a song off Khalifa’s Rolling Papers 2 album in 2018 — but they really started making waves as a duo in 2009 with their How Fly mixtape*. Not only did they compliment each other well musically but the Cheech & Chong-inspired artwork for How Fly made the project even more memorable.\n\nTen years later, Curren$y and Wiz are on the verge of their third joint project and first combined studio album — How Fly was a mixtape and Live in Concert (circa 2013) was an EP.\n\nThe album, titled 2009, is an obvious nod to the year How Fly dropped and is set for February 8th release.\n\nOn Tuesday, Curren$y confirmed the release date and also revealed the tracklist for 2009 in an Instagram post. Per Spitta’s post, 2009 features 14 songs, more memorable artwork and features from Ty Dolla Sign and Problem.\n\nSo, the album is right around the corner, which is awesome, but it’s even cooler that fans will have a chance to hear it live. That’s right, Currensy and Wiz Khalifa are hitting the road for a 22-city tour that kicks off on Friday — same day as album release — in Seattle, Washington."
