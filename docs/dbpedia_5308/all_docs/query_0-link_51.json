        "text": "Laid-back, smoked-out New Orleans rapper Curren$y's got plenty of buds: the musical kind, and the other kind. Last night at Metro, he brought out both. Taking the stage with a bag of Harold's in hand, the one they call Spitta touted the advantages of the Jet Life he's always talking about, rhyming nice and easy about taking things nice and easy. But the mellow mood at Metro was broken when Curren$y brought out a few friends: Chicagoan Mikey Rocks of the Cool Kids, Gary speedball Freddie Gibbs, and slim Pittsburgh MC Wiz Khalifa. Sure, Wiz and Curren$y go way back, but no one was expecting the wildly popular \"Black & Yellow\" rapper to make an appearance in Chicago. For the surprise, the crowd went unsurprisingly nuts. Curren$y and company later took the party to Lumen, where they stayed until the wee hours. Gotta keep the party going when your buds are in town.\n\nThe Owly: Shining a spotlight on last night's defining moment. Think we're off the mark?
