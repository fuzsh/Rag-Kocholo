        "text": "Old buddies Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y just dropped off \"Uber Driver\" and announced an upcoming project titled #2009, the year when they released their first joint mixtape How Fly? Wiz has come a long way since then, now one of the industry's biggest rap stars, and Curren$y has kept it underground, though continuing to add prestige to his name with each release.\n\nBoth rappers have been criticized for their one-dimensional content, but it's a dimension you can't understand unless you're smoking the type of paper planes Wiz and Spitta always have on standby. Once the marijuana's ignited, these two can channel a chemistry that inspires endless creativity. Years have passed, and both men have gone different directions in their individual careers, though as soon as they pair up, and light up, it's back to day one. A lot's changed, but one thing's always gonna stay the same... *lighter flick*\n\nWe've put together a history of Wiz & Spitta collabs. Let us know your favorites, and tell us what you're looking forward to on #2009.\n\ncover\n\nHow Fly (2009)\n\nA History Of Wiz Khalifa X Curren$y Collabs\n\nWiz and Curren$y first linked up in 2009 to put out their How Fly joint mixtape. The pair hot-boxed the studio and emerged with a tape that's still beloved by Wiz and Spitta die-hards alike. Wiz, the more animated of the two, supplied the catchy hooks, Spitta ever-reliable with his slick New Orleans monotone--over lush production that'll have you sinking into the couch. There's endless play on the double meaning of being \"elevated\", and the two will continue to whizz around on paper planes on their future collabs.\n\n\"Friendly\" would also appear on Wiz' next album Deal or No Deal, released later that year.\n\n\"Glass House\" (feat. Big K.R.I.T.)\n\nA History Of Wiz Khalifa X Curren$y Collabs\n\nKush & Orange Juice (2010)\n\nWiz' 2010 Kush & Orange Juice is one of his most successful tapes to this day. \"Glass House\" is a sure highlight, on which Wiz and Spitta still stay above the clouds, but bring some shit-talking energy to the table (that's the Vitamin C). There's a classic scratched-up mixtape hook from Mississipp's Big K.R.I.T., a fixture in any good stoner playlist.\n\n\"Scaling the Building\"\n\nA History Of Wiz Khalifa X Curren$y Collabs\n\n24 Hour Karate School (2010)\n\nWhen producer Ski Beatz, who had just finished producing Curren$y's Pilot Talk II, came out with his debut album, 24 Hour Karate School, he called upon Wiz & Spitta Andretti to lend their charisma to \"Scaling the Building\". Curren$y takes over and shows he can drop a mean hook on a track, too. \"Scaling the Building\" is a gem that underground heads will be sure to enjoy.\n\n\"Huey Newton\"\n\nA History Of Wiz Khalifa X Curren$y Collabs\n\nThe Chronic (2010)\n\nThis obvious sample of Toto's \"Africa\" is a high point of Wiz' pop sensibilities that have, at times, gotten the best of him. A little poppier than he's comfortable with, Spitta takes a back seat and lets Wiz show off the chops that will earn him crossover success.\n\n\"Rooftops\"\n\nA History Of Wiz Khalifa X Curren$y Collabs\n\nRolling Papers (2011)\n\nRolling Papers was Wiz' first album after signing with Atlantic, and it was a huge, unprecedented success. Looking back, it's surprising \"Rooftops\" appeared on the same album as \"Black and Yellow\", Wiz' first #1 single. Curren$y is one of the few features on the album, and \"Rooftops\" shows how the duo has evolved over the past couple years. They're more serious, more experienced--more jaded, too--but they're still close friends and collaborators.\n\n\"OG\" (with Snoop Dogg)\n\nA History Of Wiz Khalifa X Curren$y Collabs\n\nMac & Devin Go to High School (soundtrack) (2012)\n\n\"OG\" is off the soundtrack to \"Mac & Devin Go to High School\", a straight-to-DVD movie starring Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg, as high school students, and also featuring cameos from Andy Milonakis and Mystikal. Despite the 4.5/10 rating on imdb, this has gotta be essential viewing. The soundtrack's worth checking out, anyway.\n\nstoned immaculate\n\nA History Of Wiz Khalifa X Curren$y Collabs\n\nThe Stoned Immaculate (2012)\n\nNext came Curren$y's first major label release The Stoned Immaculate. The album performed surprisingly well, hitting #8 on the charts. Spitta invites Wiz to rap on two tracks , \"Jet Life\" and \"No Squares\", the latter of which is definitely the most aggressive cut we've heard from the pair.\n\nLive In Concert (2013)\n\nA History Of Wiz Khalifa X Curren$y Collabs\n\nAfter How Fly, Wiz and Spitta didn't release a full project together until Live In Concert in 2013. The album marks a break in the careers of both, who each had started to work with more trendsetting producers while foregoing the organic influence of their early work. Live In Concert is all about having fun, and that means adding some sumptuous instrumentals--flutes, keys, even harps--and keeping the subject matter natural (and heavily faded). It's not a live album, but it's a show specially curated by two old friends who can still out-smoke the competition.\n\n\"House in the Hills\"\n\nA History Of Wiz Khalifa X Curren$y Collabs\n\nBlacc Hollywood (2014)\n\nBlacc Hollywood debuted at #1 and earned Wiz his first Grammy nod for \"We Dem Boyz\". Produced by I.D. Labs and Sledgren, \"House in the Hills\" has Wiz chasing pop success while delivering some of the most sentimental content of his career. Curren$y hasn't achieved nearly the same level of stardom, but his verse here shows that he is, truly, \"one of them under-celebrated greats\".\n\nuber\n\nA History Of Wiz Khalifa X Curren$y Collabs\n\nWiz and Spitta just hit us with their latest track, \"Uber Driver\", and it looks like they have another collaborative project on the way. Not much has changed since the old days, though they might be puffin' on a different strain--Wiz' personal \"KK\" strain, that is. We're not sure if it's a mixtape or album, but their upcoming project is titled #2009, which suggests they're bringing us back to when it all started."
