        "text": "Who doesn’t love Wiz and Spitta? Now they won’t be the first ones to be lauded for being complex lyricists. But guess what, that’s ok. They may not wow you with lyrically-dense bars, but they are both able to meticulously string together hypnotic records. Individually, they earned their respective fans because of their relentless work ethic and penchant for making smooth tunes. Given their similarities, when they join forces, it's often a stellar performance. They slyly comb through whatever record they’re on and deliver a low-key (or laidback) banger. While everyone revels at the sight of Jay and Ye or Wayne and Drake, Wiz and Spitta swim under the radar, which is exactly where they want to be. After reviewing Fabolous vs. Lloyd Banks last week, this week, we decided to pit Wiz against Curren$y, as we await the anticipated #2009 project. Let’s get to it.\n\nWiz Khalifa & Curren$y - “Car Service”\n\nWho Had The Better Verse: Wiz Khalifa Vs. Curren$y\n\nWhen these two pair up, magic ensues. How Fly was something beautiful. In 2009, both men were fairly young and were trying to find their footing, musically. They both were oozing with potential and gleamed gracefully throughout the tape. Khalifa’s verse was dope. Lines like “Oh behave I’m young, rich, famous/Grinding, keep my pockets on Schwarzenegger” and “These fuckin blogs, they love a star and I’m flashin’/Life just like a movie, no casting” were some of the best lines delivered by the Pittsburgh rapper. Don’t fret Curren$y fans. He had some dope lines of his own like, “Shine from above these land lovers, I’m a chandelier” and “The closest that you lames ever came to the planes was a Palm Pilot,” earned him bonus points. “Car Service” was an all around banger. This was a tough, but the point will get to Wiz.\n\nWinner: Wiz\n\nYour Vote:\n\nWiz Khalifa & Curren$y – “Rollin’ Up”\n\nWho Had The Better Verse: Wiz Khalifa Vs. Curren$y\n\nAnother dope cut off How Fly, “Rollin’ Up.” The duo continued showing their supremacy on the tape, even with their outro “Rollin’ Up.” The soulful-sampled record captures Wiz and Curren$y at their best. Aside from being reserved to hook duties, Spitta had the first verse and crushed it. The Hi-Tek-produced beat was a perfect marriage for Spitta. “Bitches pitch it, like pitchers/but I’m smart not a wild swinger, careful at what I’m hittin.’” Wiz finished the song admirably. He pretentiously rapped about being in Vegas smashing millionaire hoes, in addition to holding the team down. “Because I’m on the level you can’t be in/and I flick the middle finger to fake friends.” You gotta love a team player.\n\nWinner: Curren$y\n\nYour Vote:\n\nWiz Khalifa & Curren$y – “S.D.L.”\n\nWho Had The Better Verse: Wiz Khalifa Vs. Curren$y\n\nThis time, Wiz returned the favor and bodied “S.D.L.” He flipped the record entirely and turned it into a record of his own. Curren$y’s verse was almost forgettable. The perpetual weed talk can get tiring after a while, but when you have Wiz crooning and rapping like this, it's overlooked. “She don’t cook well, but she gave me sweet brain/Make a rapper turn singer like T-Pain,” Wiz rapped. “Can’t wait to see what’s in the future but I drive slow,” he also said. With a very successful career thus far, we're pretty sure Wiz has no issues at all with the future. Point, Khalifa.\n\nWinner: Wiz Khalifa\n\nYour Vote:\n\nCurren$y & Wiz Khalifa – “How Fly”\n\nWho Had The Better Verse: Wiz Khalifa Vs. Curren$y\n\nFor the weed aficionados (likely anyone who listens to these two), this is the track for you (well, every track is for YOU really). With Curren$y and Wiz both high off life, they let off rounds on “How Fly.” “Sneaker collector, I bring em’ out kid/Kicks all over the crib, roundhouses,” said Curren$y in regards to his epic kick game. Khallifa took a different approach and spoke about his versatility in nabbing foreign chicks. “Pull up in car service, fly private when I leave/I’m chillin’ with two pretty women who speakin’ Japanese, n*gga please.” Wiz has never had issues with his flow, case in point, and his delivery was definitely smoother on this beat in contrast to Spitta.\n\nWinner: Wiz Khalifa\n\nYour Vote:\n\nWiz Khalifa Featuring Curren$y & Big K.R.I.T. – “Glass House”\n\nWho Had The Better Verse: Wiz Khalifa Vs. Curren$y\n\nIn 2010, Khalifa dropped his opus Kush & Orange Juice, which garnered critical acclaim. Wiz was at his apex and didn’t struggle in terms of delivering bangers. “Glass House” proved to be another top-notch record on the mixtape. With K.R.I.T. living comfortably on the hook, Khalifa glided seamlessly. “Get it twisted because you see me on your computer screen/Thinking cuz you got wireless you get high as us/Bitches leaving they lame n*ggas to ride with us/Planes over everything in the fly we trust.” Nobody can get higher than Khalifa when he's in his zone, especially with how he performed on “Glass House.”\n\nWinner: Wiz Khalifa\n\nYour Vote:\n\nWiz Khalifa Featuring Curren$y & Big Sean - “Proceed”\n\nWho Had The Better Verse: Wiz Khalifa Vs. Curren$y\n\nImagine if these guys really dropped a mixtape? The trio of Sean, Wiz, and Curren$y teased us with several tracks a couple of years ago and they all were fire. Wiz feasted on this Cardo beat. He was up at bat first and didn’t disappoint one bit. Once again, when Wiz ruminates about life, he’s really dope. “Rollin’ the papers so they get high with me/If I decided to give this up one day, they gon’ retire me/Enjoy the money and the fame and the power with me,” rapped Wiz. Spitta was up second. Andretti was straight flowing on the track, with ease. “Car smelling like a pound when I pull up at the Avalon/Don’t know what you yappin’ for, stacking dough/Catalogue my closet, my belts, my watches/Cell phone in my pocket/my blackberry biotches,” said Spitta. Smooth.\n\nWinner: Curren$y\n\nYour Vote:\n\nWiz Khalifa Featuring Curren$y – \"Rooftops\"\n\nWho Had The Better Verse: Wiz Khalifa Vs. Curren$y\n\nLet’s venture back to Wiz’s debut album with Atlantic Records, Rolling Papers. While many appeared perturbed by the idea of Wiz segueing into mainstream, he managed to have a few quality bangers on Rolling Papers. “Rooftops” was one of them. Both men delivered great performances. \"Let a bitch give me brain, call it home work/N*gga try hatin’ on em’ but it don’t work.\" Curren$y countered pretty smoothly, as he is warrant to do. \"Just made a million, got another million on my schedule/The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless,\" boasted Spitta. Despite it being Wiz's song, Curren$y’s verse had more luster.\n\nWinner: Curren$y\n\nYour Vote:\n\nCurren$y Featuring Wiz Khalifa & Rick Ross – \"Choosin'\"\n\nWho Had The Better Verse: Wiz Khalifa Vs. Curren$y\n\nSpitta Andretti gave this Lex Luger beat a test drive and owned the beat. \"Choosin'\" came into fruition back in 2013, when Spitta released his mixtape New Jet City. He tapped Wiz and Ross for this joyride, giving fans quite the unexpected treat. Ultimately though, Spitta left both rappers in the dust. He straight up morphed into Dom Torretto from \"Fast and the Furious\" and never looked back. \"Spitta, where you goin’, finna meet the money/I come through in that bread truck, everybody hungry/I be tryna keep it low, but the streets be talkin,\" rapped Spitta. Winner is Curren$y.\n\nWinner: Curren$y\n\nYour Vote:\n\nWiz Khalifa & Curren$y – “Landing”\n\nWho Had The Better Verse: Wiz Khalifa Vs. Curren$y\n\nAfter putting together a dope project with How Fly, Wiz and Curren$y teamed up again for their EP Live in Concert. No hook was necessary here as both rappers decided to just flow. Spitta came with a solid verse, which mentioned having motion sensors at his house and having a lucky lady read his horoscope during breakfast. Wiz, on the other hand, ventured back to classic movie, \"The Bronx Tale,\" for this dope line, “These n*gga lacking positive influences so I’m sonning these n*gga/You n*gga more Calgero, I’m more Sunny than n*gga.” He also managed to have time to squeeze in a line about holding down his mama with a nice crib. “That’s why I got a couple of cribs and everyone of em’ owned/Shoulda had my Ferrari by now, but I had to give my mama a home.” Kudos Wiz.\n\nWinner: Wiz Khalifa\n\nYour Vote:\n\nWiz Khalifa Featuring Curren$y – “House in the Hills”\n\nWho Had The Better Verse: Wiz Khalifa Vs. Curren$y\n\nDespite Blacc Hollywood being a party-laden album, Wiz did have several gems, especially in the form of “House in the Hills.” Wiz took an introspective approach on the record and rapped about realizing his dreams and muting all of his detractors. Despite his public persona being tainted by his failed relationships and drug usage, he valiantly explained why he in fact is still a role model. “They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us, then sell straight to the public/You young, black, then you thuggin’/What they don’t talk about is the that came from nothin’.” When Wiz raps like this, his candor is undeniable. His entire verse was imbued with real life truth. Real rap is always good to hear.\n\nWinner: Wiz Khalifa"
