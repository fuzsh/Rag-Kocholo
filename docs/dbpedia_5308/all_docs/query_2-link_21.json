The new mixtape #2009 is yet to have an official release date but we've first heard the refreshing first single \"Uber Driver.\" Well today we get \"Weed Nap\" which is produced by ID Labs and Frank Dukes and features sayitaintone. ID Labs and Frank provide a mellowed out background for both rappers to trade verses with sayitaintone providing an auto-tuned chorus. This song is being passed out as a free download ahead of the #2009 mixtape coming out next month. Enjoy!\n\nWiz Khalifa & Curren$y - Weed Nap feat. Sayitainttone (prod. By ID Labs And Frank Dukes) | Free Download"
