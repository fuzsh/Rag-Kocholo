Well they are coming out with a mixtape soon, and have been leaking a few of the track off it. First I'm featuring Dot Dot Dot, it's got a real mellow chilled out feel, as you'd expect with these 3. The beat is real sick, and all 3 rappers deliver. Also included is Weed Brownies and Flowers. Check them out, chill, and enjoy!\n\nUpdate: We've never seen the mixtape, these are the only tracks\n\nWiz Khalifa, Curren$y, & Big Sean – Dot Dot Dot | Direct Download\n\nWiz Khalifa, Curren$y, & Big Sean – Weed Brownies | Direct Download"
