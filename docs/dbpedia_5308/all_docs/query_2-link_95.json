        "text": "Wiz Khalifa & Curren$y Live Preview: 2/19, House of Blues, Chicago\n\nWiz Khalifa\n\nBY JORDAN MAINZER\n\nThere’s something about New Orleans rapper Curren$y that used to bring out the best in Wiz Khalifa. Right around the time the weed aficionado was making it big, he released How Fly, a collaborative mixtape with Curren$y that was better than it had any right to be. That was 2009, right before the latter would break out with his Pilot Talk albums and establish himself as one of the hottest in the game; Wiz Khalifa, on the other hand, gained popularity but never much critical acclaim. The duo released a Live in Concert EP in 2013, but didn’t offer a proper follow-up to their first major mixtape until earlier this month.\n\nNamed after the year in which How Fly was released, 2009 is about what you’d expect it to be considering where the respective rappers are now. Khalifa is fresh off of one of the most overcooked records of his career, Rolling Papers 2, and on 2009, he offers mostly cheese. Curren$y, in contrast, is in top form, having just taken part in Fetti, his excellent collaboration with Freddie Gibbs and The Alchemist from late last year. His Southern drawl fits over the trap beats of a song like “10 Piece”: “I don’t watch soccer, but I like the jerseys / They look good with my jewelry on / And my butter brown skin tone,” he beams. (In general, the production fits him, especially the skronking funk of “From the Start”.) His penchant for clever alliteration is exemplified on “Find A Way” (“I only fuck with professionals / Sniper scopes and silencers stuck inside of leather sectionals”). His storytelling ability shines on “No Clout Chasin”.\n\nAs for Khalifa? He delivers lines like “This is the life, bitches and Nikes,” pronouncing “Nikes” incorrectly to rhyme with “life,” and sleeps through platitudes like, “No pain, no gain,” trying to cash in a check from an inevitable commercial from Under Armour or something. He’s more tolerable over generically hard or propulsive beats (“Getting Loose”, “Forever Ball”), the exceptions being the 80′s thump of “First or Last”, where his flow is better than it’s been in years, and the haze of “Stoned Gentlemen”, which you just wish was saved for Earl Sweatshirt alone. Ultimately, though, the album–and tonight’s show at House of Blues–is worth listening to for Curren$y. He gets the album’s last big laugh on the penultimate “Bottle Poppers”: “We smokin’ like three hundred dollar joints basically at this point / I don’t know if you ever had a three hundred dollar joint / You hangin’ ‘round the wrong folks.” Words of wisdom if I ever heard them."
