        "text": "Warner Music Group unveiled a dynamic new structure for its Recorded Music operations, designed to strengthen services to artists at every stage of their careers, create more direct channels between local expertise and global opportunities, and position the company for long-term growth. As part of this reorganization, Max Lousada, CEO, Recorded Music, has decided to step down at the end of the fiscal year (September 30), after eight highly successful years in the role, and 20 years at WMG. Lousada will remain as an advisor through January 31.\n\nAt the same time, Julie Greenwaldhas begun a leadership transition, which will see her take on a new role as Chairman, Atlantic Music Group, reporting to Robert Kyncl, WMG CEO. Effective October 1, Elliot Grainge, 10K Projects Founder & CEO, will become CEO of Atlantic Music Group, reporting to Kyncl. Continuing the tradition of independently minded entrepreneurs joining WMG, Grainge became part of the global senior management team last year, after the company acquired a majority stake in his trailblazing label.\n\nEffective October 1, the new, flatter structure will elevate creative regional leadership, supported by global services, delivering maximum impact for artists on the world stage. WMG's Recorded Music regional and divisional leaders will report directly to Kyncl. In the new structure, WMG will neither have the roles of CEO, Recorded Music nor President, International, Recorded Music.\n\nEurope, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) - will be overseen by seasoned exec Simon Robson. The UK & Ireland group will now be part of European operations. Latin America (LATAM) - including WM Latina, will continue to be run by Alejandro Duque, who has made a big impact on the region since joining WMG in 2021.\n\nAt the same time, Warner Music Group is strengthening its central global operations in order to create new opportunities for artists and drive additional revenue across distribution (via ADA), Global Catalog, Marketing, and WMX (including merchandising and Direct To Fan). As a result, effective October 1, the respective heads of those divisions will report to Kyncl. Max Lousada: Among the many artists that have flourished during Lousada's leadership are superstars such as Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, Dua Lipa, Coldplay, David Guetta, Megan Thee Stallion, Myke Towers, and Diljit Dosanjh.\n\nThroughout his tenure, WMG's recorded music operation strengthened its global footprint, expanding into major markets such as India and the Middle East, and carrying out high-profile acquisitions such as 10K Projects, 300 Entertainment, and Spinnin' Records. Prior to becoming CEO of Recorded Music in 2017, Lousada served as Chairman & CEO of Warner Music UK, where he oversaw the integration of Parlophone Records. Lousada previously headed up Atlantic Records UK for nine years, during which time he built an award-winning team and a strong roster of artists including Paolo Nutini, James Blunt, Rudimental, Plan B, Marina and the Diamonds, and Damien Rice.\n\nIn 2002, he joined Mushroom Records as Head of A&R, signing ambient dance act Zero 7 and overseeing releases from acts such as Muse, Ash, Garbage, and DJ Paul Oakenfold. In 2000, he became the European Managing Director for the New York-based hip-hop label Rawkus Records, working with artists such as Mos Def, Talib Kweli and Pharoahe Monch. Lousada began his music industry career straight out of college, founding his own distribution company, In A Silent Way.\n\nIn 2018, Lousada was introduced by Dua Lipa when he accepted Music Week's prestigious Strat Award, which recognizes industry icons and innovators. Julie Greenwald: Since joining Atlantic 20 years ago, Greenwald has been integral to the success of top artists such as Cardi B, Brandi Carlile, Kelly Clarkson, Coldplay, Jack Harlow, Lil Uzi Vert, Lizzo, Charli XCX, Kehlani, Bruno Mars, Janelle Monáe, Panic! at the Disco, Charlie Puth, Ed Sheeran, Tiësto, Rob Thomas, Twenty One Pilots, and Wiz Khalifa, among many others, as well as award-winning projects such as Barbie the Album and the Original Broadway Cast Recordings of Hamilton and Dear Evan Hansen.\n\nUnder her leadership, Atlantic Music Group has grown to encompass music brands such as 300, ATCO, Big Beat, DTA, Elektra, Fueled By Ramen, Low Country Sound, Public Consumption, and Roadrunner. In 2021, she played a pivotal role in the acquisition of 300 Entertainment, bringing artists such as Gunna, Young Thug, and Megan Thee Stallion. In 2020, she helped to architect a new phase of WMG's partnership with Artist Partner Group, originally formed in 2012.\n\nIn 2018, Greenwald oversaw the re-launch of Elektra as a stand-alone label in the US. Prior to Atlantic, she was president of The Island Def Jam Music Group. She began her career at Rush Management and then Def Jam working with Jay Z, Method Man, DMX, and many others.\n\nGreenwald has been chosen five times as Billboard's Women in Music Executive of the Year ? more than any other person. Elliot Grainge: Grainge joined WMG last year, after the company acquired a majority stake in his trailblazing label, 10K Projects.\n\n10K Projects has discovered and developed new superstars and fast-rising names, including alt-pop sensation Artemas, rap stars Ice Spice, Trippie Redd, and 6ix9ine, No.1 Christian artist Forrest Frank, pop duo Surfaces, as well as exciting talent like Aitch, YTB Fatt, and COIN. Grainge was also behind the signing of XXXTENTACION in 2016. In just seven years, 10K Projects' team of expert digital marketers has been behind countless commercial and cultural hits, including over 30 platinum-certified singles.\n\nIn 2022, Grainge struck a deal to bring Homemade Projects into the fold, which encompasses a record label, influencer management, and merchandise operation."
