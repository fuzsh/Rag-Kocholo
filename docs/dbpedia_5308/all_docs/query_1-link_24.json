        "text": "It's a streamlined, continuously moving visual for Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y's \"Garage Talk\" video, a single from their joint project 2009. In the animated, CJ Wallis-directed video, the rappers steadily move from one panel to the next as they flow from left to right, revealing a new scene. They each take turns rapping their verses as the animated scenes change from bars, sports stadiums, recording studios, low riders, and shopping for gold chains...and you know Wiz kept the cloud billowing the entire time.\n\nWiz and Curren$y have known each other since, you guessed it, 2009 after they met on MySpace. They've collaborated on projects together ever since then and recently they caught up with Complex to talk about the development of their working relationship. \"Well look, we was broke at the same time,\" Curren$y said. \"Well not broke, but compared to how shit is now we was broke! That’s a struggle, and whoever you struggle with, that’s a bond that’s different. We were both dealing with some s**t that’s unspeakable: 'I’m not doing good, s**t's not working out.' So we both had that going on and we didn’t have to talk about it much, we just got ourselves out that situation.\""
