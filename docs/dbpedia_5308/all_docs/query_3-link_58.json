Then, the unthinkable (not really): Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y deliver a new project titled 2009, ten years after the former’s original release. It’s like Christmas right now.\n\n2009 sees 14 tracks, with additional assistance from Ty Dolla $ign and Problem; production comes courtesy of Harry Fraud, Sledgren, Cardo and more (basically, the usual suspects that helped make past classics). Add in their tour of the same name, it’s looking to be a productive year for these two collaborators.\n\nCheck out 2009 below.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nWiz Khalifa Recruits Trippie Redd & Preme for “Alright”\n\nNEW ALBUM WEDNESDAY: Curren$y, Freddie Gibbs & Alchemist, Westside Gunn & BlocBoy JB\n\nRelated\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Albums/Mixtapes\n\nEditor Picks"
