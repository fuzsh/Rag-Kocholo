        "text": "Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y’s long-awaited joint project finally arrived Friday (Feb. 8). 2009 drops nearly 10 years after the pair of weed lovers united for How Fly. The 14-track effort is packed with nostalgia and features only two vocal assists, courtesy of Problem and Ty Dolla $ign.\n\nKhalifa sounds more inspired than ever, exuding the youthful exuberance packed into his braggadocios rhymes that we fell in love with just about a decade ago, when the Pittsburgh native begin ascending through the mixtape ranks.\n\n“Always left hella game on the table for anyone to witness/ Trips to Vegas, we don’t need a ticket/ Blow presidential smoke and our drinks are expensive/ Our wins are extensive/ Penthouse, wonderful view, I live how a prince live/ But back when we started, wasn’t a way to predict this/ Stuck to the script, made our own movie,” Wiz fittingly raps putting his career in perspective to close out the project on the Harry Fraud-produced “Forever Ball.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe Jetlife and Taylor Gang connection picks up where it left off, boasting a certain rapport that could only be built by organic experiences, rather than label manufacturing. Wiz and Curren$y kick off their 2009 Tour tonight (Feb. 8) in Seattle.\n\nTake a dive into the 40-minute 2009 below."
