        "text": "Although 10-years late, Curren$y and Wiz Khalifa finally released their long-awaited follow-up to 2009's How Fly. Aptly titled 2009, the two weed enthusiasts linked up to recreate the special chemistry they captured 10 years ago. As you could imagine, the two rappers deliver straight stoner anthems on the project. Now, the rappers link up for the music video for their track, \"The Life.\"\n\nWiz Khalifa and Curren$y are back with a brand new visual off of 2009. The rapper's latest visual for \"The Life\" is exactly what you'd imagine. Curren$y and Wiz Khalifa celebrate the hustle while popping bottles surrounded by gorgeous women and of course, smoking big spliffs. The visual seems to have been done while on tour. The footage cuts between shots of Spitta and Wiz on their tour bus and the two turning up at a hotel.\n\nWiz Khalifa and Curren$y are currently on tour supporting their latest joint effort. The \"2009\" tour kicked off in Seattle, WA on Feb. 9th and it's expected to conclude on March 4th in San Antonio, TX. Keep your eyes peeled for more new music and visuals from Spitta and Wiz."
