        "text": "As far as Live Nation is concerned, Tuesday (May 5) was \"National Concert Day.\" The entertainment company held a concert for Cinco de Mayo and Taylor Gang chief Wiz Khalifa was present for the festivities. MTV got a chance to catch up with Wiz, who shared details on his upcoming collab with Curren$y, #2009.\n\n\"We're still putting our ideas together, just making it a full project,\" said Wiz. \"We're such friends and we're such stoners, we kind of just want to give it out. But we are in the music business so... we're figuring out the best way to package it and put it together. But, the music is there. We always gon be recording and putting stuff out. We're just putting the plan together, really. I wanna have the best plan of action so it comes off correctly.\"\n\nIt's only been two years since Khalifa and Spitta dropped Live in Concert. Since then, we've gotten a couple of tracks off the forthcoming project, including \"Weed Naps\" with SAYITAINTTONE and \"Uber Driver.\"\n\nWiz also touched on his recent track with PartyNextDoor, which is tentatively titled \"Hurricane.\" The \"Good For Us\" rapper says the track kind of just happened one day when PND visited Pittsburgh. Rather than go to a strip club, the two decided to hit the studio and a dope song came out if it.\n\nCheck out the interview above."
