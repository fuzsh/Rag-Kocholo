        "text": "Dame Dash has shared his disappointment about the decisions rappers like Stalley and Curren$y made about their careers after he advised them to stay independent.\n\nIn a recent chat with Math Hoffa, shared by Dash’s Nu America Network, the always outspoken mogul warned off that their proximity to each other might lead to some life-changing offers coming Hoffa’s way. But he didn’t necessarily mean that to be a good thing.\n\n“If they see you with me, they gon’ come offer you $5 million,” Dash said. “That’s what happened with Wiz Khalifa, Curren$y, Stalley, [Big] K.R.I.T. They were all with me first, and then they took the deal. I ain’t mad at none of ’em. A lot of ’em did it behind my back, cuz they were ashamed.\n\n“Where you think Stalley – the most independent grumpy in the world. He’s the one that was like, ‘Yo, Imma be the most independent, da da da da da… and then he took that deal. And I was like, ‘You were just saying you were gonna be independent.’ And I remember I seen him in the airport five, six years later, [asked] was it worth it? ‘Nah.’ Curren$y broke my heart, he did that one behind my back.”\n\nDame Dash’s commentary was edited to include an old clip of a conversation he had with a young Wiz Khalifa, though the other rappers mentioned may have also been in the room.\n\nThe video likely dates back to Dash’s days helming his post-Roc-A-Fella media company DD172. Launched in early 2010, the imprint was his anti-establishment push into everything from visual arts to fashion and of course music.\n\nUnder its music arm BluRoc, DD172 famously entered into hazy partnerships with the likes of Mos Def, Jay Electronica and Curren$y. And while the relationship between Spitta and his fellow XXL Freshman alums is well known to fans, it might take a little digging for most to draw the connection between each of the other artists and Dame Dash.\n\nPer HipHopWired, Stalley’s 2011 mixtape Lincoln Way Nights (Intelligent TrunkMusic) was sponsored in part by DD172. In a 2020 chat with Complex, Big K.R.I.T. recounted meeting Dame Dash for the first time while working with Creative Control and Ski Beats; but seemed to relegate the interaction to some good advice shared during just that conversation. And according to a 2022 interview with Cabbages, Dash counts a full Wiz Khalifa album among the projects he’s worked on that may never see the light of day.\n\nThe one relationship mentioned in the Harlem mogul’s recent interview which is easiest to verify also happens to be the one with a documented bad history.\n\nIn March 2012, Curren$y filed a lawsuit seeking $1.5 million in damages from Dash, claiming that the DD172/BluRoc boss released two albums without his consent. Curren$y signed with Warner Bros. in 2011 after trying to negotiate a deal with the mogul. The rapper had released two projects with Dash before signing the Warner Bros. deal.\n\nDash lost his lawyer in the proceedings and Curren$y filed for default judgement, which he was granted. In 2014, the rapper went back to court demanding $2.9 million in damages and an additional $95,000 in legal fees."
