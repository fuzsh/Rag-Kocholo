        "text": "Live in Concert produced a slew of Jazz-infused songs, but one stands above the rest.\n\nWiz Khalifa and Curren$y have always blended their styles well. Starting in 2009 with How Fly, the two MC’s have produced singles and projects together ever since. Often rhyming over soul-sample based instrumentals, they’ve improved their collective sound over the years. To date, aside from How Fly, I think Wiz and Curren$y’s best collaboration (on a project) was their EP in 2013, Live in Concert.\n\nLive in Concert has more of a Jazz feel and sound than most of their collaborations. But they stay true to their style of rhyming over sample-based instrumentals. “Landing” is a good example of what they were trying to accomplish with this project. The duo trade bars over a sample from jazz-singer Bobbi Humphrey’s “The Trip.” A real bonus to this song: By songs end, the beat plays out with no vocals for about a minute. The ending of “Landing” is one of of my favorite parts because it feels like a jazz solo.\n\nThe music and video below is presented here for the purpose of scholarship.\n\nWiz Khalifa & Curren$y – “Landing”"
