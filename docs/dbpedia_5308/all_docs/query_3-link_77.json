        "text": "While the song describes a brand/way of life, Curren$y eschewed the literal for the “Jet Life” music video. Instead, he and guest star Wiz Khalifa (sans track producer Big K.R.I.T.) spend the video recording in the studio and rolling around Beverly Hills in a red Ferrari, with Khalifa spitting rhymes while hanging out the passenger window. We’re no experts, but renting a Ferrari for a whole day has to be nearly as expensive as renting a parked jet for 20-30 minutes. Either way, watch their vehicular mean-muggin’ in all its luxurious glory below.\n\nCurren$y’s latest album, The Stoned Immaculate, is out now via Warner Bros."
