        "text": "Rappers can't seem to stop talking about Uber these days. Curren$y is no different. Today, Spitta and Wiz Khalifa drop a new single, \"Uber Driver.\"\n\nThe NOLA native and Khalifa take their time on the laid back beats by Sledgren. The two MCs have had enough, rhyming about their eventful nights before calling an Uber to take the party back to the crib. \"Uber Driver\" is reminiscent of the long-time friends earlier rhymes, which we will be hearing more of pretty soon.\n\nAndretti and Wiz have been teasing a collaborative project they call 2009. There's no word on a release date for the joint venture, so \"Uber Driver\" will have to do for now. In the meantime, Wiz is also working on a collab with Ty Dolla $ign, Talk About It in the Morning. Spitta is gearing up to drop Pilot Talk 3 on Saturday (April 4), which fans can only own by purchasing his $100 album package. Curren$y's also currently on tour, wrapping up at the The Regent Theatre in L.A. on April 25."
