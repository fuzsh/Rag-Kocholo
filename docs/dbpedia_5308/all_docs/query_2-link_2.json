        "text": "Back in 2009, Wiz Khalifa & Curren$y teamed up for the How Fly mixtape. As a follow up in 2015, they announced the 2009 project but it never manifested into an official release. Today however, the two have finally dropped the 14 track project to much delight of their fans. Featuring their staples beats from the likes of Harry Fraud & Cardo amongst others, itâ€™s nostalgic to see 2009 finally released. Wiz & Spitta are set to being their collab tour tonight in Seattle, WA. Give 2009 a listen below:"
