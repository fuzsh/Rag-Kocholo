        "text": "Southern Indian rapper and performer Hanumankind has taken the internet by storm with bold new single, “Big Dawgs,” which this week debuts on Billboard Hot 100 charts (#57 and climbing). The Def Jam India/Capitol Records artist first dropped the song and video last month and to date has recorded over 21 million views on Youtube with over 700K streams daily in the U.S.\n\n“Big Dawgs” is currently charting in 34 countries Spotify Daily Top Song chart including Global #17 (+2) and #28 in the U.S. The song is currently #1 on multiple Spotify’s Viral chart including Global, USA, India, UK, Germany and Australia.\n\nThe song started garnering heat as the internet got hold of the blockbuster music video which stars Hanumankind backdropped against the Well of Death — a popular carnival attraction in Southern India. Directed by up-and-coming filmmaker Bijoy Shetty in India, the video has garnered incredible reception globally. Watch the incredible video below or via LINK HERE.\n\nA Rolling Stone India Future of Music artist, Hanumankind has been cosigned early by the likes of Project Pat (who he references in the track), Bun B and The Game for his authentic flow and rhyme work. The track continues to climb various charts having already conquered top spots in countries like India, UAE, Australia, Singapore, Germany, Malaysia and more. Hanumankind is the electric jolt that the bourgeoning independent music scene in India has been waiting for.\n\nAbout Hanumankind, rise of “Big Dawgs”:\n\nHailing from the Southern Indian state of Kerala, Hanumankind is one of India’s most exciting additions to the burgeoning independent music industry. He broke onto the scene with a string of EPs and singles that immediately grabbed attention — showcasing unmatchable lyrical prowess while delivering infectious hip hop with visually striking music videos. The energy matched his live shows where he quickly began to sell out club shows, performing at festival weekenders and even delivering an electrifying Boiler Room set in Banglore last year. He went on to sign with Def Jam India in 2023 and became one of Rolling Stone India’s “Future of Music” artists this year. Closing in on the momentum, Hanumankind delivered his most bold single yet this Summer, titled “Big Dawgs.” The song came with an equally daring music video directed by filmmaker Bijoy Shetty where Hanumankind revives the adrenaline-fueled allure of the Well of Death — an iconic attraction at Indian carnivals. Bijoy's direction captures the vibrant energy of the art form, blending Indian cultural elements with modern hip-hop flair. The song and video quickly grabbed the internet’s attention and catapulted Hanumankind as one of the most talked about artists online. Already garnering a reputation for his high-octane live performances and boundary-pushing music, Hanumankind is only just getting started.\n\nAbout The Well of Death & Symbolism:\n\nThe Well of Death, a once-popular attraction at regional Indian carnivals, involves motorcycles and cars riding at high speeds inside a large, barrel-like cylinder. The roar of engines fills the air as riders defy gravity, performing dangerous stunts on vertical walls. The crowd watches in awe, captivated by the thrilling display. This dangerous yet mesmerizing art form echoes the daring nature of many street performances in India, such as tightrope walking, snake charming, and knife throwing. All of which seem to be activities that Hanumankind brushes off his shoulders with a wry smile, knowing full well that he’s done and seen colder feats, in this case, while literally on top of a gravity-defying Maruti 800."
