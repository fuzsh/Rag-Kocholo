        "text": "Fans’ curiosity continues to grow as Wiz Khalifa released five new tracks via his Twitter account featuring Curren$y and Big Sean: “O.T.T.R.,” “Weed Brownies,” “Dot Dot Dot,” and “Flowers,” produced by Big Jerm, and “Proceed,” produced by Cardo.\n\nIn an interview with MTV, Wiz Khalifa spoke on the tracks, without confirming any plans to release a joint project with his counterparts.\n\n“It’s always fun to be in the position where we could make music that sells to people, videos that people enjoy, and still just drop free music that we feel like is just good stuff,” explained Wiz.\n\n“And at the end of the day, we weren’t hearing anything like what we make and I felt like it was time for that,” he continued. “Me and Spitta, we talk all of the time, and it was just a thing where he called me and he was like, ‘Yo, we need to do something,’ and I was like, ‘Yeah, we should do something. We should do this,’ and he was like, ‘Perfect.'”\n\n“We wanted to do something new, add that new element, and it ended up being real fun,” he added, referring to Big Sean.\n\n“It’s definitely not How Fly 2, but we’ll see what comes of it.”\n\nWatch the interview below:"
