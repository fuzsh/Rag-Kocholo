        "text": "Wiz Khalifa told concertgoers back in December at the inaugural NYC BAPE Heads show that fans can expect his 2009 joint album with Curren$y to finally arrive in 2019. To go along with the elusive project, the Live in Concert rappers announced on Wednesday (Jan. 9) that they’ll embark on a 22-date trek across North America.\n\nThe 2009 Tour is set to begin in Seattle on Feb. 8 and run for just over a month into the start of March. Shows on tap will feature stops in San Francisco, Portland, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, Houston and Dallas, before wrapping up in San Antonio.\n\nTickets are slated to go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. local time over at Live Nation. Khalifa also stated on Instagram that a run of 2009 limited-edition merchandise will be released soon as well. The Pittsburgh native recently reconnected with the Jet Life CEO on Christmas Eve for “KhalifAndretti.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nCheck out all of the tour dates below."
