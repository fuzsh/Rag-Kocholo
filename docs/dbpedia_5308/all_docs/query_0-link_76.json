        "text": "Gass apologized for his comment in a since-deleted Instagram post, calling it “highly inappropriate” and a “dangerous and terrible mistake.\"\n\nThe road goes on for Tenacious D.\n\nWhile attending the Los Angeles premiere of Borderlands on Tuesday, Jack Black confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that the comedy rock duo isn’t over after abruptly canceling their Australia and New Zealand tour last month due to bandmate Kyle Gass’ controversial remark about the Donald Trump assassination attempt.\n\n“We had to take a break, but I love the D and everybody takes a break sometime,” Black explained. “Yeah, we’ll be back.”\n\nThe actor also revealed that he was wearing a Pick of Destiny necklace — the legendary guitar pick once owned by the Devil in the band’s 2006 film, Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny — underneath his shirt while on the red carpet.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nRelated: Amber Rose, model and Wiz Khalifa's ex-wife, supports Donald Trump in RNC speech: 'This is where I belong'\n\nTenacious D was performing at the very first stop of their Tenacious D and the Spicy Meatball Tour in Sydney last month when Gass was presented with a birthday cake onstage and told to make a wish. Moments before blowing out the candles, he joked, \"Don't miss Trump next time.”\n\nWhile his comment drew laughter from the audience in attendance, it didn't go over nearly as well online. United Australia Party senator Ralph Babet even went so far as to issue a media release demanding that the duo be “immediately removed from the country.\"\n\nGass later apologized for the remark, calling it “highly inappropriate” and a “dangerous and terrible mistake” in a since-deleted Instagram post.\n\nHe added, “I don’t condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone. What happened was a tragedy, and I’m incredibly sorry for my severe lack of judgment. I profoundly apologize to those I’ve let down and truly regret any pain I’ve caused.”\n\nRelated: The View hosts react to Donald Trump shooting: Real threat 'wasn’t a drag queen, it wasn’t an immigrant'\n\nIn his own Instagram post, Black claimed that he was “blindsided” by Gass’ comment at the concert and cancelled their tour and all creative projects moving forward.\n\n“I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form,” he wrote. “After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold. I am grateful to the fans for their support and understanding.”\n\nFormed in 1994 by Black and Gass, Tenacious D has gone on to release four studio albums: 2001's Tenacious D, 2006's The Pick of Destiny, 2012's Rize of the Fenix, and 2018's Post-Apocalypto."
