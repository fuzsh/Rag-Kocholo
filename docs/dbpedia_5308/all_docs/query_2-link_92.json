        "text": "Grammy-nominated Oakland-bred MC, Guap has teamed up with award-winning artist Wiz Khalifa and rapper and songwriter Curren$y for a boastful, yet smooth and lyrically nimble new single and Paul Middleton-directed video entitled “Pose”.\n\n“It was awesome to team up with Guap,” shares Wiz. “We all had a great time making the track.”\n\nThe Drew Banga-produced glider is the next single leading up to his new EP GUAP, due out on July 8th. “I grew tired of hearing the same thing over and over, sonically.” he shared of the collaboration. “I found myself doing too much and not enough of it for myself. With this name shed, it’s time to be me again. It’s time to just be cool again. So I rounded up the ‘Kings of Cool,’ “GUAP, Wiz & Curren$y. Who is cooler than us?”\n\nThe new single follows his last release, “Black Iverson,” which debuted in a unique collaborative format with COLORSxSTUDIOS who teamed up with NBA 2K for a special collaboration that introduced it in an exclusive curated COLORS soundtrack update and NBA 2K in-game performance.\n\nCheck out the “Pose” music video from Guap, Wiz Khlaifa, and Curren$y below:"
