        "text": "A couple of years ago, weed-rap all-stars and frequent collaborators Curren$y and Wiz Khalifa joined forces for a joint mixtape (see what I did there?) called How Fly. It remains one of the best things either of them has ever done. In the past few days, the two rappers have released two more collaborations to the internet, both of which also feature Kanye West's young, chirpy-voiced Detroit protégé Big Sean. Listen to [\"O.T.T.R\"](http://nahright.com/news/2011/07/18/wiz-khalifacurreny-big-sean-o-t-t-r/ \"\"O.T.T.R.\"\" ) and [\"Flowers\"](http://nahright.com/news/2011/07/19/wiz-khalifa-curreny-big-sean-flowers-prod-by-big-jerm/ \"\"Flowers\"\" ) at Nah Right.These tracks could be rumblings of bigger things to come. In a recent radio interview, Big Sean alluded to a mixtape he'd been working on with \"two other guys in hip-hop that are just killing it right now,\" claiming that it would be out within the next few weeks."
