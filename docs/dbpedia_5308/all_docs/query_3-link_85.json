        "text": "Ahead of the curve. While hindsight is often considered to be 20/20, Wiz Khalifa refuses to get stuck behind the eight ball and looks to the future on “Prequel,” a cautious collaboration with Curren$y from the Taylor Gang leader’s brand new mixtape Cabin Fever 3, which itself precedes his upcoming fourth album Rolling Papers 2.\n\nHoping to avoid getting caught up in the moment, the two marijuana enthusiasts can already foresee a day filled with mass consumption, and decide to plan accordingly. “We ain’t gotta roll them up because they’re pre-rolled,” insists Wiz after preparing his joints well in advance. It’s a method of operation that could potentially lead to some wasteful behavior, but you know what they say: better safe than sorry."
