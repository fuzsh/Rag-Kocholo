He was featured in Lil Wayne's \"Grown Man\" on Tha Carter II. While still at Young Money, Currensy created Fly Society with skateboarder Terry Kennedy, first as a clothing company, then expanding to release music. He released the song, \"Where da Cash At\" as the lead single for his Young Money debut, Music To Fly To, in 2006. In 2007, another mixtape was released entitled Life at 30,000 Feet.

Currensy demanded that Dash immediately stop releasing his music for profit, and pay $1.5 million in damages.[38] On October 6, 2015, Currensy was awarded $3 million in settlement stemming from the 2012 lawsuit against Dash for releasing material of his music without his consent.[39]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Currensy discography\n\nSee also: 504 Boyz discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nThis Ain't No Mixtape (2009)\n\nJet Files (2009)\n\nPilot Talk (2010)\n\nPilot Talk II (2010)\n\nWeekend at Burnie's (2011)\n\nThe Stoned Immaculate (2012)\n\nPilot Talk III (2015)[40]\n\nCanal Street Confidential (2015)\n\nBack at Burnie's (2019)[41]\n\nCollection Agency (2021)\n\nStill Stoned on Ocean (2021)[42]\n\nPilot Talk IV (2021)[43]\n\nCollaboration albums\n\nHow Fly (with Wiz Khalifa) (2009)\n\nCovert Coup (with The Alchemist) (2011)\n\nJet World Order (with Jet Life) (2011)\n\nMuscle Car Chronicles (with Sean O'Connell) (2012)\n\nJet World Order 2 (with Jet Life) (2012)\n\nLive in Concert (with Wiz Khalifa) (2013)\n\nThe Carrollton Heist (with The Alchemist) (2016)\n\nFetti (with Freddie Gibbs & The Alchemist) (2018)\n\n2009 (with Wiz Khalifa) (2019)[44]\n\nGran Turismo (with Statik Selektah) (2019)\n\nPheno Grigio (with Berner) (2019)\n\nPlan of Attack (with Trademark da Skydiver & Young Roddy) (2019)\n\nPrestige Worldwide (with Smoke DZA) (2019)\n\nThe Tonite Show with Curren$y (with DJ Fresh) (2020)\n\nSpring Clean (with Fuse) (2020)\n\nThe OutRunners (with Harry Fraud) (2020)\n\nThe Director's Cut (with Harry Fraud) (2020)\n\nBonus Footage (with Harry Fraud) (2020)[45]\n\nWelcome to Jet Life Recordings (with Jet Life) (2021)[46]\n\nWelcome to Jet Life Recordings 2 (with Jet Life) (2021)[47]\n\nHighest in Charge (with Trauma Tone) (2021)[48]\n\nMatching Rolexes (with Kino Beats) (2021)[49]\n\nRegatta (with Harry Fraud) (2021)[50]\n\nContinuance (with The Alchemist) (2022)[51]\n\nSpring Clean 2 (with Fuse) (2022)[52]\n\nVices (with Harry Fraud) (2023)\n\nHighway 600 (with Trauma Tone) (2023)\n\nHighway 600 (Deluxe) (with Trauma Tone) (2024)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
