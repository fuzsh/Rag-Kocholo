        "text": "Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y have made tons of records together — a clear sign that friendship comes first before business. In March, fans were excited to hear that the duo was teaming up again for a new mixtape, #2009, but haven’t gotten a proper update since their announcement. So what’s been up with it?\n\n“We’re still putting the ideas together and just making it a full project,” Wiz told MTV News earlier this week. “Because we’re such friends and we’re such stoners, we kind of just wanna give it out. But, then, you know, we are in the music business, so, we’re figuring out the best way to package it and put it together.”\n\nYoung Khalifa and Spitta’s track record starts with their 2009 breakout mixtape, How Fly. From that tape, fans of their weed raps wanted another cohesive project, which resulted in their 2012 EP, Live in Concert. Recent collaborations like “House in the Hills” (off Blacc Hollywood) and “The 560 SL” (off Pilot Talk III) have only fueled the fire for more from these two.\n\n\"The music is there, and we always gonna be recording and putting stuff out, so we’re just putting the plan together, really. I wanna have the best plan of action so it comes off correctly,\" he said.\n\nSo far, the pair has teased #2009 with cuts like “Uber Driver” and “Weed Nap.” Hopefully, fans can expect it out soon because their chemistry in undeniable.\n\nBET.com is your #1 source for Black celebrity news, photos, exclusive videos and all the latest in the world of hip hop and R&B music.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our newsletter.\n\n(Photos from left: Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Revolt TV, Steve Rogers Photography/Getty Images for SXSW)\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
