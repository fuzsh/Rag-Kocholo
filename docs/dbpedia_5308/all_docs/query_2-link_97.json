        "text": "New Orleans native rapper Curren$y recently released his fifth album of this year titled Matching Rolexes, which is a collaborative LP with Kino Beats. The album is an 11-track project with songs about the finer things in life. Curren$y raps about his cars, jewelry, partying, relationships, and his life in New Orleans. The album gives us his typical New Orleans-influenced sound, with some slow, melodic beats and some harder production tracks.\n\nMatching Rolexes by Curren$y\n\nMatching Rolexes captures Curren$y’s typical sound, with his southern Louisiana influences and style. He uses instruments and sounds from New Orleans culture to bring unique and authentic production into his tracks. The album includes many harmonic tracks, along with some harder beats and lyrics.\n\nDeJ Loaf, Valee, Kino Beats, and BLU are all features on Matching Rolexes. The album takes us through Curren$y’s lifestyle: one of partying, girls, luxury items, and the “fast life.” He raps about his experiences growing up in New Orleans and how he has evolved over the years with his growing career. Curren$y stays authentic to his individual sound on Matching Rolexes, and we are excited to see what he has to offer to the game next. Which based on his track record, will likely be soon.\n\nAbout Curren$y\n\nCurren$y started as a member of No Limit Records signees 504 Boyz in the early 2000s. He struggled with different labels before he started his own, Jet Life Records. Curren$y has collaborated with many high-profile artists including Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, Freddie Gibbs, and many others. Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y put out their album 2009 in 2019, which revisited the chemistry of the two artists’ decade-old How Fly project. Curren$y has six studio albums and many other releases over the years. His 2012 release, The Stoned Immaculate, was one of his most successful albums and was on the top charts.\n\nIn 2016, Curren$y put out over a dozen mixtapes. Some of the collaborative efforts included The Alchemist (The Carrollton Heist), Purps (Bourbon Street Secrets), and Sledgren (Revolver). His self-releases were continued in 2017, with the Jetlanta EP and The Marina (Jet Life) EP in 2018. Curren$y released two more collaborative projects with Statik Selektah and Berner.\n\nStream Matching Rolexes by Curren$y\n\nMore EDM, Hip-Hop, and Music Content\n\nBABY KEEM RELEASES NEW STAR-STUDDED ALBUM ‘THE MELODIC BLUE’ FEATURING KENDRICK LAMAR, TRAVIS SCOTT, AND DON TOLIVER\n\nDOJA CAT RELEASES ‘PLANET DOJA’ NFT COLLECTION WITH CHANCE TO WIN VIP EXPERIENCE WITH MEET-AND-GREET\n\nINSOMNIAC’S FIRST LOST IN DREAMS FESTIVAL TURNED LAS VEGAS INTO A MELODIC DREAMSCAPE FEAT SEVEN LIONS, ELEPHANTE, DABIN, AND MORE\n\nGOLDRUSH MUSIC FESTIVAL BRINGS EDM TO THE OLD WEST WITH PERFORMANCES FROM ILLENIUM, DIPLO, NGHTMRE, AND MORE\n\n10 ATLANTA RAPPERS YOU SHOULD BE SUPPORTING IN 2021\n\nFOR MORE CANNABIS NEWS, FOLLOW RESPECT MY REGION ON FACEBOOK & TWITTER."
