        "text": "If you think of a music album bearing the Gran Turismo name, it’s likely there’s only one that springs to mind. The Cardigans’ Gran Turismo, including the Gran Turismo 2 title track My Favourite Game, is legend.\n\nWell, it’s about to get some interesting company. Rap artists Curren$y and Statik Selektah (Shante Franklin and Patrick Baril) have released their own Gran Turismo, and it has something of a different flavor.\n\nComing in at nearly 28 minutes long, the 10-track album features a number of collaborations with big names and newcomers alike. Tracks include “Clear”, with New York’s Jadakiss, and “Nothin New” featuring Wiz Khalifa, while Jim Jones and YBN Cordae also make appearances. Please don’t ask what that’s an abbreviation of.\n\nWe’re not entirely sure what the music actually has to do with Gran Turismo. Curren$y and Statik Selektah both make references to cars in their previous body of work, but it is a curiously specific title.\n\nNevertheless, we do have to give some serious credit to that cover art. Created by Canadian director and long-time Curren$y collaborator CJ Wallis, it’s an impressive homage to the game series. The back cover features an adapted version of the Gran Turismo 2 menu screen, with a GT6 course-maker version of the Jet Life Recordings logo.\n\nYou can listen to the entire album below. It probably goes without saying, but do be careful of listening to it around young and sensitive ears…\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5IetU5BFMGQ\n\nSee more articles on music.\n\nGran Turismo 7 Online Time Trial: Clio Blue Sky\n\nA new Gran Turismo 7 Online Time Trial is now available for hot-lap enthusiasts, in a jam-packed schedule of time trials that sees five events available in total.\n\nMercedes-AMG Launches Multiplatform “Virtual Championship”, Starting Today\n\nMercedes-AMG has become the latest car manufacturer to fully embrace esports with a brand new series on three different platforms, beginning today.\n\nGran Turismo World Series 2024 Nations Cup Exhibition Season Begins This Weekend\n\nWith the Gran Turismo World Series live event action from Prague now in the record books, Polyphony Digital has announced a short Exhibition Season for online racers to fill the time until the upcoming Tokyo event.\n\nGran Turismo 7 Daily Races: Hell or High Water\n\nPlayers will find a new set of Gran Turismo 7 Daily Races are now available, featuring one of the longest races we’ve ever seen in Sport Mode.\n\nGran Turismo World Series Prague: Ferrari and Gallo Win After Late Dramas\n\nPrague’s first ever Gran Turismo World Series live event brought some of the closest ever finishes in the history of the series, and leaves the two championships finely poised heading into the end of the season.\n\nGran Turismo World Series Tokyo Tickets Are Now On Sale\n\nHot on the heels of confirming that Amsterdam will host the 2024 Gran Turismo World Final, Polyphony Digital has also announced that tickets for the Tokyo live event are now on sale.\n\nGran Turismo World Series 2024 Final Will Be in Amsterdam, December 6-8\n\nThe location for the 2024 Gran Turismo World Series World Finals has been confirmed, with the series returning to Amsterdam for the season-ending event.\n\nWatch Live: 2024 Gran Turismo World Series Round 2 – Prague\n\nThe Gran Turismo World Series moves into its European round later today, as a second entirely new city (and country) prepares to host the second round of the championship.\n\nGran Turismo 7 Weekly Challenges: The One and Only\n\nAs midnight is passing on Thursday evenings around the world, Gran Turismo 7 players are finding a new set of Weekly Challenges is becoming available to them."
