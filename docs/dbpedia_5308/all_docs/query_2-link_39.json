        "text": "4/20 is over, but that might not be the case for Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y. The duo released their own celebratory material yesterday and now they’ve got a brand new collaboration in the form of “Change.”\n\nSmooth as usual, Sebastian’s father rhymes about rolling joints and getting hella high while Spitta raps about “cooking audio dope.” Ricky P’s production allows both MCs to also celebrate the fact that they “never change.”\n\nYesterday, Khalifa released “Two Blunts” with Game and Lorine Chia as well as “You,” featuring Liam Payne and Juicy J. Meanwhile Curren$y unleashed his Purps-produced mixtape Bourbon Street Secrets.\n\nListen to them team up on “Never Change” below."
