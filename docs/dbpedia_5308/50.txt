Currensy and Wiz Khalifa's 2009 project might be on the way after all. The two weed connoisseurs announced the collaboration last year, but it has been on the backburner ever since. The record could be popping back up though as Currensy has recently been using 2009 as a hashtag on social media. His latest move saw him release a track with Wiz called "Situations" featuring that tag on SoundCloud.

It is not clear if this song was recorded back in 2009 or if it was made during the sessions for the aforementioned project. Spitta did hype up some cutting room floor tracks on Twitter, so it is likely from those recordings. Wiz Khalifa takes on a leading role here as he handles the hook and opening verse. Currensy still gets to a chance to shine as he glides over the smooth production.

"And I ain't came at a bitch neck yet, nigga/You just nervous, worried, pressed, stressed/I'm laid, stretched out, leg room, first class Taylor Gang jet/Niggas talking shit, I'd rather count up/Gossiping another's shit is so childish/Keep that from round us/No squares in the Pentagon/By silent alarm, you have alerted the don/Now war already on/You crawling on the floor tryna get to your phone, nigga/This desert storm, we outside your home, nigga/In the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs/2009, a lot of y'all styles was born," Currensy raps.

This may be a simple case of Currensy letting fans hear some records from a shelved project. But considering the quality of this record, hopefully 2009 is still in the plans. If not, Spitta has plenty of more material on the way. The New Orleans rapper also announced a new solo tape titled Weed and Instrumentals 2.
