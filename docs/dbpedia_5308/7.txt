Wiz Khalifa has been celebrating 4/20 appropriately, dropping new music with Juicy J, The Game, and now Curren$y. The stoner-rap duo has shared “Change”, a laid-back ode to consistency. Wiz makes multiple references to '09 in the song, so it’s unclear whether this is a newly recorded collaboration or a loosie from the How Fly sessions. Listen to “Change” below.
