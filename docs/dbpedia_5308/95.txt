Stream Wiz Khalifa & Currensy Surface To Air

Wiz Khaflia and Curren$y’s joint tape, How Fly, has hit all streaming services. Not only is the shift convenient in today’s age of instant accessibility,

but it also signals a sign of change to come; before long, perhaps your favorite tape will surface on your platform of choice. In the meantime, How Fly is the integral companion to any smoke session,

as both Wiz and Curren$y likely bonded, Step-Brothers-esque, over a shared admiration for the greenleaf. Selecting a song to highlight proved difficult,

as the tape has yielded a variety of fan favorites across the board, yet something about “Surface To Air” felt right for today’s showing.
