Both Curren$y and Wiz Khalifa‘s work ethic is to be applauded. It appears they take no days off from the intense workings of the industry and continuously share music with their captivated audience. When the two get together for music, it’s a collaboration beautiful to the ears of their fans. Their latest track “Situations” is another one for the books.

“Situations” by Wiz and Curren$y comes from their joint effort of #2009, a collaborative body of work that was supposed to be out last year. They released the track “Uber Driver,” and that was it. But now it looks like we have some action.

Curren$y’s verse is recognizable as he did it in a freestyle during a tour stop last year. Wiz handles the Usher-influenced hook, and then begins to rip his verse with a cadence like no other. Curren$y is laid-back as we expect, mellowing out the mood.

Wiz is currently prepping us for his Rolling Paper 2 album, while Curren$y recently announced his Weed & Instrumentals 2 project. Expect to hear more from these two as the summer months close out on us.
