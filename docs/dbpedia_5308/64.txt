Wiz Khalifa and Currensy are going on the road together. After recently confirming that their collaboration album 2009 is coming in 2019, the two rappers now decided to follow that up with a joint tour across the United States.

The 2009 Tour, which will visit 22 cities in the US, will kick off in Seattle on February 8th and is scheduled to wrap up on March 9th in San Antonio. In the meantime, Wiz Khalifa and Currensy will also visit San Francisco, Portland, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, Houston and Dallas among other cities.

You can check out the full list of dates for the tour below.

2009 won’t be the first album Wiz Khalifa and Currensy will release together. They previously released an EP titled Live in Concert in 2013. The EP ended up receiving mixed reviews from the critics, who described it as “predictable” but “enjoyable” album. It also didn’t have much success at the chart, peaking at No.30 on the US Billboard 200.

The duo’s most recent collaboration was on the song “KhalifAndretti” which was featured Currensy’s 2018’s mixtape Weed & Instrumentals 3.
