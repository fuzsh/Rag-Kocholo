        "text": "One unexpected consequence of my going on my international travels, quite a few years ago now, was that I almost at once became much less particular in my choice of reading matter. This was pre-owning-a-Kindle and there was a very real case of beggars not being choosers when it came to English language books. This obviously had its downsides, as I occasionally found myself reading anthologies by Jeffrey Archer, bonkers works of anti-semitic pseudo-science, and the occasional later David Eddings novel – but on the other hand it’s virtually a certainty that I would never have read Middlemarch, Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Don Quixote, or The Moonstone under any other circumstances.\n\nIn some ways, though, the discovery I am most grateful for was when I came across a paperback copy of (if memory serves) Volume Two of the Collected Short Stories of Somerset Maugham. He is not much read these days, no doubt because many of his stories are essentially concerned with the dying days of Empire, an institution he is not particularly critical of, but – and, as usual, to my surprise – Somerset Maugham turned out to be a fantastic writer of enormous gifts – killer twists, memorable lines, good jokes, this man had all the tools at his disposal. (One consequence of his having become somewhat obscure is that I’ve been able to pass some of his best lines off as my own without anyone noticing so far. You may call it plagiarism, I call it bringing his work, uncredited, to a new audience.)\n\nSo I’ve always got an eye out for a Somerset Maugham movie I haven’t seen before, and I don’t mean Seven. Once again, these have become somewhat thin on the ground, so it was a pleasant surprise a while back when one of the high-numbers archive channels showed John Byrum’s 1984 film The Razor’s Edge, based on the novel of the same name. Somerset Maugham presented this as an account of true events, with himself appearing in the novel as a minor character (a fairly common device for him) – but he’s been cut out of the movie.\n\nThe movie opens in the Illinois countryside, with wholesome scenes of folk at some sort of town fair; one of the reasons they are there is because they are about to send off an ambulance they are sponsoring to France – the First World War is in progress but the United States has not decided to join in yet. Crewing the ambulance are two well-off young men from a good background – Grey (James Keach), the son of a successful stockbroker, and his good friend Larry (Bill Murray).\n\nAll their goodbyes said, the pair go off to France where they join a group of other volunteers and quickly discover the realities of war, witnessing and narrowly avoiding death on several occasions, including that of close comrades. When it’s all over they go back to the States – but while Grey is happy to take up a job working for his pa, Larry wants something more out of life. This rather concerns his fiancee Isabel (Catherine Hicks, these days perhaps best remembered as the Kirk-fancying cetecean biologist in Star Trek IV), but her snobbish uncle (Denholm Elliott) suggests Larry get it all out of his system by spending a couple of years in Paris.\n\nTime passes and when Isabel eventually visits Larry she is shocked to find him mixing with the lower orders and working as a fish packer. He informs her doesn’t want to follow the path everyone has got mapped out for him, feeling there must be something more to life than this. Offended, she breaks off the engagement.\n\nThe film then intercuts between the various events in the lives of Isabel, Grey, and people in their set – marriages, tragedies, the impact of the Wall Street Crash, and so on – and Larry’s journey of self-discovery. A chance conversation with a peculiarly well-read coal miner (Peter Vaughan) sends him off to India in search of the wisdom contained in the Upanishads, while from there he goes to (what looks very much like) Tibet, where he ends up studying in a monastery. He eventually has some sort of spiritual revelation, and tells the chief lama that it’s easy to be a holy man on top of a mountain. The lama ripostes that trying to stay on the path of virtue amidst all the distractions of the world is like walking a razor’s edge. But back to Paris he decides to go, to discover what has happened to all his friends.\n\nSo, yes, this is a slightly weird film in some respects, which is not unconnected to the fact that these days it’s very obscure. It’s hard not to conclude that this is a part of that whole wave of classic adaptations set around the 1920s which appeared in the wake of Chariots of Fire and Brideshead Revisited, and it certainly looks the part – this is a lavish production, filmed in Europe and Asia, clearly aiming to be a stirring epic of war, peace, love, and spiritual awakening.\n\nAnd it doesn’t really work. Possibly for viewers at the time, and more probably for viewers today, this is because right at the heart of the film is Bill Murray, not someone you’d naturally associate with literary costume drama, and certainly not costume drama with an existential, spiritual angle to it. Murray co-wrote the script as well as starring and apparently felt a strong connection to the story – but somehow that never really comes across on screen. Possibly he’s just not a good enough actor for a role as challenging as this – he’s very good as the standard Bill Murray character, who’s usually somewhat cynical and semi-detached from what’s going on around him, cocking an eyebrow and making an ironic comment on whatever’s happening – but that character is all wrong for someone undergoing a sincere personal crisis and looking for serious answers. Murray can’t bring that character to life on screen and as a result the film has a void at its centre. Even a scene where he delivers a speech to the body of a comrade who’s just died – a comrade played by Murray’s own brother, and a speech apparently written with Murray’s recently-deceased friend John Belushi in mind – you never get a sense of real emotion being involved.\n\nThis is a problem that none of the other praiseworthy things about the film – the cinematography, Jack Nitzsche’s stirring score, some fine performances from the supporting cast – can really do enough to salvage. There’s one single moment when Isabel implores Larry to come back to America, get a comfortable job, and settle down, and he replies that there must be more to life than this, and he wants to find out what it is – and suddenly Larry feels like a real person who you can empathise with and invest in. But this doesn’t last, and for much of what follows Larry moves rather cryptically through the film, his feelings and motivations a mystery. As a result much of the final act of the film doesn’t feel like it has an actual plot, just a succession of slightly disjointed scenes, with moments that are presented as clearly being of great importance having little real impact.\n\nI wish I liked it more, but it’s not quite odd enough to avoid feeling overlong (seeing Murray on screen with such unlikely co-stars as Elliott and Vaughan – Caroline John apparently played Vaughan’s wife, but her scenes seem to have been cut – has a certain amusement value, but this soon wears off). Too much of the time it feels stilted and emotionally constipated, lacking in wit and a genuine feel for its characters. None of these are things you could ever really say about Somerset Maugham’s own writing. Possibly the most significant thing about this film is that, in order to get it made, Murray agreed a deal with Columbia where they would finance The Razor’s Edge if he would agree to star in something called Ghostbusters. I don’t know who got the best of that deal, but I know which of those two films I’m more likely to watch again.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAs long-term readers (seek help) will have guessed, that title means it’s time for a look at another one of Amicus’ signature anthology films, on this occasion The Vault of Horror, from 1973. On directorial duty this time is Roy Ward Baker, a veteran of the horror genre. If nothing else this film proves that a good director and a distinguished cast can still find themselves absolutely screwed if the script is no good, and scripting this time round is Milton ‘Check the Gyroscope’ Subotsky, moving spirit behind Amicus and not-very-good writer. Whether the fact that all the stories this time around are adapted from American horror comics just compounds the problem, I don’t know, but there’s certainly something wrong somewhere.\n\nThe film opens with shots of boats on the Thames, new modern tower blocks, and so on (this is entirely fraudulent and actively misleading) before we go inside one of the towers where some men are getting into a lift. They are the usual mixture of veteran stars who are perhaps now struggling a bit (Terry-Thomas, Curt Jurgens), fairly fresh new up and comers (Michael Craig, Tom Baker), and one guy who seems to have wandered in off the street (Raymond Massey – well, maybe this is a bit harsh, but he’s less of a well-known face than the others). The lift develops a mind of its own and takes them down to a mysterious sub-basement where couches and drinks await them. The lift seeming to be broken, they settle down to wait for help in comfort, and – as you would – start telling each other about their recurring nightmares.\n\nUp first is Massey, in whose dream he pays a detective to find his sister, who has run away. He then murders the detective to avoid paying him, which really just establishes how moronic most of the script is this time, and goes off to find her. She is living in an unnamed small town which has been plagued by a series of murders, the victims’ bodies being found totally drained of blood. If anyone but Milton Subotsky was writing the script, you might expect this to be setting up a clever twist of some sort, but it isn’t. The town is infested with vampires who have even opened their own restaurant, serving very rare steak, black pudding, fried blood clots, and so on. Nothing exciting or especially interesting happens. Playing Massey’s sister is Massey’s sister (Anna of that ilk), but that’s the most engaging thing about this story, and it isn’t that engaging.\n\nHopes of something more rewarding arrive with the next story, in which Terry-Thomas’ rich, obsessively tidy bachelor decides to get married to Glynis Johns. Needless to say he has great difficulty in adapting to having someone else in the house who isn’t as meticulous as him, and the marital stress-o-meter is soon rising. It all leads up to a sort of grand guignol sort of ending with a reasonable sight gag about Terry-Thomas’ famous teeth. The same problem pertains here as in the first film, which is that the characters are so cartoonishly written – real people just don’t behave this way – that two experienced and able actors can’t do anything to lift the script.\n\nJurgens’ segment is on next: he plays a professional stage magician on holiday in India looking for material for his act. Nothing suitable crosses his path until he comes across a girl charming a rope out of its basket like a snake, which he gets very excited about. Unfortunately, the girl refuses to sell the secret, so he lures her back to his hotel room and murders her, taking rope and basket for himself. Even more unfortunately, the rope turns out to have high moral standards, and in a moment which is up there in the anthology-horror annals alongside Fluff Freeman trying to prune a carnivorous vine, John Standing being attacked by a piano, and Michael Jayston going to bed with a tree, Curt Jurgens ends up having a fight with a magic rope. It’s an improvement on the first two segments if nothing else.\n\nCraig gets his moment in the fourth segment, as a struggling writer – ‘there’s no money in horror,’ he grumbles, the most self-aware moment of the script – who comes up with a preposterous scheme to fake his own death for the insurance money. This is a stupid scheme in a film full of people behaving like idiots, and needless to say it ends badly for him and his accomplice (the great Edward Judd is sorely underused). Notable for an appearance by Arthur Mullard as a gravedigger and what looks like an attempted in-joke where two actors famous for playing medical students on TV play medical students here. Like most of the bits in the film, though, it doesn’t outstay its welcome.\n\nI may well be biased, but for me the final story is the one that makes Vault of Horror possibly worth watching. Tom Baker plays an artist on a Gauguin-esque sabbatical (but in Haiti, not Tahiti) who learns that three wealthy men back in London have conspired to swindle him out of the profits from his paintings. Off he goes to the local houngan to get himself voodoo-ed up in pursuit of a suitably poetic justice. Well, if nothing else it makes a bit more sense than some of the previous stories, Baker bringing a strikingly baleful presence to his role, despite being given some shocking costumes, Denholm Elliott plays his chief tormentor, and the gimmick with the voodoo paintings means it works visually too, even some of the story logic is a bit wobbly.\n\nAnd then we’re back in the basement for the final reveal, which is that – brace yourself! – they weren’t dreams, but confused memories of how they all died. A bit like in Dr Terror’s House of Horrors, written by one Milton Subotsky, and Tales from the Crypt, written by… oh, you guessed. Well, why change a winning formula, or at least a formula. There is some confusion over whether or not a scene was filmed where the characters shuffle off back to heir graves as skull-faced revenants – photos of this exist, but no-one’s ever found the footage, which doesn’t appear in any of the versions currently in circulation (the one currently popping up on British TV is the expurgated one with some of the gorier moments replaced by still images).\n\nThen again, as you have doubtless figured out, much of Vault of Horror is dimwitted and confused, not least in its metaphysics – Jurgens, in his closing speech to camera, reveals that they are here, cursed, doomed to relive their terrible deeds. Well, all right, there are two bona fide murderers in the main cast, plus someone who’s clearly capable of murder for his own selfish ends… but one of them’s an insurance swindler, which isn’t quite in the same league, and the terrible crime of the final man is being a bit of a neat freak.\n\nThis is, self-evidently, comic-book horror, lifted to a quite unwarranted extent by the star quality of several of its cast members. It’s the weakest of all the various Amicus portmanteau horror films, and towards the bottom of the pile of Amicus productions generally. It has a sort of schlocky campness that some may find appealing, but even so, most people are likely to be laughing at it, not with it.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nIf you want to watch a horror movie that isn’t remotely frightening or disturbing and instead draws most of its appeal from an all-pervading sense of familiarity, you could do a lot worse than something like Amicus’ 1971 film The House That Dripped Blood, directed by Peter Duffell. The title is a bit of a misnomer as this is such an innocuous horror film that it doesn’t feature any gore at all – but that’s Amicus for you, their films often feel like they’re only a step or two away from being full-blown family entertainment.\n\nThis is (yet) another Amicus portmanteau horror film in the same vein as Vault of Horror or From Beyond the Grave, but perhaps its closest cousins are Torture Garden and Asylum, as all three were scripted by Robert Bloch. The linking device this time around is a spooky house in the English countryside, which a police detective (John Bennett) arrives at just as the credits come to an end. It seems that a famous film star who recently leased the house has mysteriously vanished – but this is just one of many unsolved cases concerning the place, as the local copper and the leasing agent, a Mr A Stoker (the film acknowledges the reference) are happy to explain…\n\nThe first tale concerns a horror writer named Hillyer (Denholm Elliot) and his wife (Joanna Dunham), who look the house over – she is not keen, but he is positively inspired by the place and soon gets to work on an unpromising-sounding novel about a mad strangler named Dominick, claiming that the character has become so real to him that it’s almost as if he can see him about the place… Sure enough, Hillyer is soon actually seeing Dominick about the place, and is appropriately disturbed when it seems he is invisible to Mrs Hillyer. (Dominick is played by Tom Adams.)\n\nYou get the idea of what this one is about quite quickly, I think, and I did find myself wondering when they were going to get to the actual climax. However, it’s not quite as straightforward as it possibly sounds – the problem is that there’s a sort of double-twist ending which hasn’t been built up enough to be remotely convincing. The effect is quite like a very long joke with a terrible punchline. Set against that you have Denholm Elliott, who is always supremely watchable, and some fairly decent direction. But not a great start to the film.\n\nNext up comes another story about spooky waxworks, as the cursed house is taken over by a retired broker named Grayson (a particularly distinguished-looking Peter Cushing). Is it possible to describe the sense of comfort and reassurance one feels when Peter Cushing comes on screen for the first time in this kind of film? Probably not; you either know what I mean or you don’t. Anyway, Grayson seems to be quite a lonely man, for reasons which become apparent when he visits the local waxwork museum (southern England is covered with them, as any fule kno): one of the female figures brings on flashbacks of a woman he was once desperately in love with.\n\nHis friend (played by Joss Ackland) comes to visit and it turns out he was also besotted with the same woman, causing the two friends to almost fall out – but she is dead now. This doesn’t really seem to be going anywhere much, apart from Cushing having nightmares about the wax museum and its contents, but then Ackland goes off to the museum himself and never returns. It all wraps up with a revelation which is confusing, more than anything else, and mainly serves to set up a sight-gag which is only just acceptable. It’s all a bit unworthy of Cushing’s talent, to be honest.\n\nOf course, when you hired Peter Cushing for a horror movie, it meant you got the chance to employ Christopher Lee at half price (not really, I think, although it does often feel like that) and the Lord of Misrule duly pops up in the next segment, in ‘doomed stoicism’ mode. He plays Reid, a widowed father who moves into the house and hires a woman named Ann (played by Nyree Dawn Porter) to home-school his sweet young daughter. Ann is bit perturbed when she discovers that Reid’s daughter isn’t permitted friends or toys and basically seems to be being kept as a prisoner. As they apparently didn’t have Social Services back in 1971, Ann organises a sort of intervention of her own, little suspecting that Reid may in fact be acting for the best of reasons…\n\nYes, it’s another eerie devil-child story, which is solid enough I suppose but still lacks a certain oomph in the visual department – something horrible does happen, but off-screen and the viewer is left to imagine it for themself. Lee was clearly impressed by the experience, later describing Duffell as one of the country’s most under-rated film directors. Personally I found it a bit glum and stodgy, but it’s still a step up from the Cushing segment and probably the Elliott one, too.\n\nSomething a bit different rounds out the movie, and to be honest this is the segment that makes the film. Finally we come to the case of the disappearing film star which Inspector John Bennett is supposedly investigating. He is Paul Henderson, played – somewhat unexpectedly – by Jon Pertwee. Mr Pertwee is so closely associated, these days, with his role as TV’s Dr Who (not a fan) and Worzel Gummidge (prefer the new version – yes, I know, it’s hard to credit, isn’t it?) that it’s easy to forget he was a massive star on the radio and made quite a few films in the 1950s and 1960s. Henderson was the last person to rent the house, and has had it decorated in a typically understated manner, complete with a large framed portrait of himself. (That said, is it really so unusual to have a framed picture of Jon Pertwee in your house? Mine (signed by the great man, of course) is on the wall between the TV and the DVD rack.)\n\nAnyway, Henderson is a prolific horror movie actor who has quite a high opinion of himself and doesn’t suffer fools gladly – Christopher Lee apparently found Mr Pertwee’s performance very familiar but couldn’t quite figure out why, which makes it all the more cherishable that it was apparently based on Lee himself. Henderson prefers the more old fashioned and authentic horror films himself, like the original Dracula – ‘with Bela Lugosi, of course, not this new fellow.’ In search of a good costume for his new movie, he goes to the shop of one Von Hartmann (Geoffrey Bayldon, who himself nearly played TV’s Dr Who on at least one occasion), who sells him a rather magnificent cloak.\n\nUnfortunately, wearing the cloak has an unexpected effect on Henderson, for when the clock strikes twelve he finds himself sprouting fangs and floating around ethereally. A scene where he is required to nibble upon the neck of his co-star (Ingrid Pitt, making one of her final film appearances prior to a long break from the big screen) does not go well. The clothes make the man – but it looks like the cloak makes the vampire, too…\n\nBy all accounts Lee, Cushing and Pitt were all on board before Duffell joined the production, but Mr Pertwee was apparently hired by the director in line with his vision for the film – which was as a comedy-horror production. This section is genuinely funny and rather more entertaining than the rest of the film, despite apparently being recut on the orders of the producer who wanted a ‘straight’ horror movie. Producers, eh, what do they know? Jon Pertwee’s bit is, I think, what The House That Dripped Blood owes whatever reputation it has to – that and a memorable title, of course, which one can hear echoes of in the Hammer House of Horror episode The House That Bled To Death and (ironically) the BBC documentary The Studio That Dripped Blood, which is nothing to do with Amicus, strictly speaking. Worth watching, even if you do make heavy use of the fast forward button through the first three-quarters of the film.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nYou have to admire the nerve shown by the producers of Mystery and Imagination in doing adaptations of Frankenstein and Dracula in the same year, especially when the year in question was 1968. If that wasn’t quite the point of peak Hammer Horror, it was certainly thereabouts: the company released Dracula Has Risen From the Grave that year, while it was also the off-year between Frankenstein Created Woman and Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed. Beyond the marquee value of the names of these two most well-known Gothic novels, one wonders if there was any further motivation for doing them – some puritanical impulse to strip them of their Hammer trappings and restore them to their place as Classic Literature, perhaps?\n\nThere have been a fearful number of Frankensteins and a dreadful number of Draculas down the years, so the same question applies to the Mystery version of Dracula as to their Frankenstein – how to justify it? What makes it a worthwhile addition to the canon? Doing it as a largely studio-bound, black-and-white video-taped production also brings with it a set of additional challenges. Perhaps because of this, this hardly qualifies as an attempt at doing the novel faithfully – but there is a certain fidelity to Stoker, as we shall see.\n\nThe play (directed by Patrick Dromgoole) opens in an asylum somewhere in the Whitby area, where a mysterious inmate (the actor Corin Redgrave in a fright wig) is pleading for water from the attendants. But this is just a ruse, and the madman breaks free from his straitjacket and crashes a party being held upstairs by the proprietor, Dr Seward (James Maxwell). Present are local grande dame Mrs Weston (Joan Hickson) and her strikingly nubile daughter Lucy (Susan George). Less nubile and more noble is another guest, an exiled Eastern European aristocrat who has recently arrived in the area – Count Dracula!\n\nDracula is played by Denholm Elliott, who would normally seem to be cast against type, were it not that Dracula here is to some extent written against type. Eloquent, bearded, and occasionally wearing dark glasses, such is Elliott’s charisma that his sway over weaker-willed locals seems entirely understandable. The madman is packed off to his cell and Dracula continues to charm his hosts, especially Lucy. Seward remains somewhat sceptical about this new figure on the local scene.\n\nHowever, the mystery of the lunatic deepens with the appearance of Mina Harker (Suzanne Neve), whose husband Jonathan has disappeared while on a business trip to Transylvania to visit Castle Dracula. Seward has called in his old mentor Doctor Van Helsing (Bernard Archard) to consult, and it transpires that the madman in the asylum is indeed Harker, left unhinged by his experiences abroad (there is a brief, filmed flashback to the goings-on at the castle, and very evocative it is too). But why does Harker call Dracula ‘Master’? Why does Dracula profess not to know who the inmate is? And could it all have anything to do with Lucy suddenly coming down with a bad case of anaemia?\n\nAs you can perhaps surmise, Charles Graham’s adaptation performs brisk, reasonable surgery on the sprawling source novel, limiting the setting almost entirely to Whitby and the time period to a few nights. (You do miss the London scenes a bit, to say nothing of Transylvania, but the budget is clearly demandingly limited.) The roles of Renfield and Harker are combined, which makes a certain sense as Harker rarely gets anything interesting to do, while Quincey and Arthur are dropped from the story entirely; I have to confess I didn’t miss them at all.\n\nSo it’s a cut-down Dracula but still a surprisingly effective one. What we are left with is a potent brew of graveyards, sex, and outraged Victorian sensibilities, so you could certainly argue that the essentials of the story have certainly survived. This could never have been as lavishly lurid as one of the Christopher Lee movies Hammer were doing at the time, but then for all their definite pleasures those films are so often a kind of schlock pantomime. Bereft of eye-catching production values, this version of Dracula is obliged to dig down into the text and actually engage with it in order to work.\n\nBut does it succeed? It is certainly a strikingly different version of this much-told fable. Elliott is certainly a very distinctive Dracula, employing his legendary scene-stealing abilities to full effect. You can imagine Christopher Lee grinding his fake teeth in fury as Dracula is actually given dialogue drawn from Stoker’s novel to deliver, which Elliott does with predictable aplomb. Whether the decision to give him rat-like incisor teeth rather than the traditional canine fangs is justified is probably a question of personal taste; the way that Dracula summons up his mesmeric powers by basically just screwing up his eyes and squinting at people is the only real element of Elliott’s performance which definitely feels a bit dud.\n\nYou would expect him to have a formidable opponent in the form of Bernard Archard: an actor capable of being mesmeric himself, given the right script and direction. Here, though, Van Helsing’s fake beard is the least of his problems. Rather than the smooth, unflappable savant that Peter Cushing invariably played, Archard’s Van Helsing is a bit rough around the edges and eminently flappable. The play decides to stick with Van Helsing being Dutch, but the good doctor’s battle against the undead is nothing compared to Archard’s struggle to get the accent right. We end up with another one of those vocal Grand Tours: Van Helsing may start off coming from Amsterdam, but at various points in the play he seems to be a native of Pontypool before finally settling on being from somewhere near Karachi. But on the whole Archard is quite acceptable despite this.\n\nThe play is mostly well-performed, anyway, especially by Susan George and Suzanne Neve. It is they in particular who make you realise just how bland and inappropriately bloodless most of the sex in the Hammer Dracula movies feels: the women tend to do a lot of limp sighing before quietly yielding to Christopher Lee. Here, there is a genuine erotic charge to the scenes between Dracula and his victims: in this sense at least, the play is a lot more explicit about the nature of the metaphor, for all that it contains no nudity and relatively little gore. The women are given real agency, too: Lucy is clearly dead keen on having a fling with their new neighbour, while Mina likewise seems almost to be an active participant, consciously choosing to become undead.\n\nIt all builds up to a final semi-twist in the tale – I say semi-twist because it is so understated, or perhaps just slightly fluffed by the script and direction, that it’s not entirely clear whether this is an intentional thing or not. It’s certainly not enough to spoil one of the better adaptations of Dracula that I have seen. Most attempts just take the premise and ditch as much of the plot as they feel they can get away with, but this one does seem to be making a genuine effort. It keeps enough of the traditional trappings to be recognisable and familiar, but isn’t afraid to try new and different things – even when being new and different means going back to the original book. A worthwhile piece of vampirology.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nWell, now, here’s a slightly odd coincidence – just the other day I was writing about the film career of the Hungarian-British director Peter Sasdy, and (in a couple of quite separate venues) about horror films with the disjointed, compelling logic of a bad dream. And then last night I stuck on a random DVD, solely for pleasure, and it turned out to be a bad-dream horror story directed by Peter Sasdy. Either my subconscious mind is rather more on the ball than its conscious equivalent, or a cry of ‘Whoo, spooky!’ is justified.\n\nThe tale in question was an episode of Hammer House of Horror, a 1980 anthology series which was very nearly the final gasp of the original incarnation of the legendary British production company. I would never argue that this is either a great TV show or a real example of what makes real Hammer horror movies so special – the TV budget means that the episodes are all set in contemporary times, making it feel somewhat more like an Amicus production, while the desire to sell the show to a US network means the horror and exploitation elements are too often watered down – but quite a few of the famous Hammer names are involved in various capacities, such as Sasdy in this instance.\n\nThis episode is entitled Rude Awakening, written by Gerald Savory, and its particular Amicus resemblance is somewhat heightened by the fact it stars that legend amongst British character actors, Denholm Elliott (he had previously played a hack horror writer in The House that Dripped Blood and one of the victims of Tom Baker’s voodoo paintbrush in Vault of Horror, both for Amicus). This is, as far as I’m aware, the only conjunction of Hammer and Denholm Elliott, but the result is one of the series’ more striking episodes.\n\nElliott plays Norman Shenley, a middle-aged provincial estate-agent whom the actor invests with all the understated seediness he often brought to this kind of part – although calling it understated may be stretching a point, as virtually the first thing we see Norman do is start letching over and groping his secretary, Lolly (Lucy Gutteridge). Norman is having an affair with Lolly, of course, although there is the slight problem that his wife (Pat Heywood) refuses to grant him the divorce he so desperately wants.\n\nAnyway: a man named Rayburn (James Laurenson) appears, claiming to be the executor of a will with a large country house to be disposed of. He would quite like Norman to take a look at the place in his professional capacity, and our man cheerfully agrees. His enthusiasm is only slightly dented when the manor turns out to be a half-decrepit, cobweb-festooned old pile, complete with spooky doors that open seemingly by themselves and wall-to-wall suits of armour. But then a disembodied voice berates Norman for the murder of his wife, and the armour creaks into life to exact retribution on the hapless estate agent…\n\nWho wakes up in a panic, rather annoying his wife in the process. It was all just a bad dream, apparently – but so realistic! Norman can’t get over it, talking to his wife about, and Lolly when he goes in to the office. He’s so obsessed with his odd nocturnal experience that Lolly suggests he drive out to see if the country house really exists. Discovering that he still has the map given to him by Rayburn in his pocket (somehow!), Norman finds the house is not there, but a phone box is. He almost dies when the box threatens to combust around him, spying a tramp who resembles Rayburn while doing so, but then enjoys a somewhat torrid interlude with Lolly (still in the phone box)…\n\nOnly to wake up yet again, back in bed with his unimpressed missus. One of the bricks you could throw at Rude Awakening is that the structure of the story becomes rather predictable as the episode progresses – Norman wakes up from his latest nightmare, restarts the day in question, only for events to go off at some odd tangent or other, normally resulting in him meeting an outlandish sticky end. The sticky ends get progressively more outlandish in the course of the episode – never mind being assaulted by animated suits of armour, Norman finds himself executed by undead domestic staff, almost killed when the building he’s in is demolished around him, and (most surreal of all) waking up midway through brain surgery to find himself dead on the operating table.\n\nAll good fun, if you like weird, not-especially-horrific horror, but the problem is really that it builds the viewer’s expectations of something really spectacularly surreal at the climax of the episode, and unfortunately it just doesn’t happen. The conclusion is reasonably clever, though, as is the way the script combines several different story types – Rude Awakening goes for, and pretty much achieves the triple by including elements of a recurring nightmare story, a precognitive dream story, and a can’t-tell-dream-from-reality story. It’s clear from early on that something fishy is afoot – Norman doesn’t seem at all surprised to find a dream artefact in his pocket while he’s supposedly awake, to say nothing of the fact that he doesn’t notice Lolly appearing in a different provocative guise in each new iteration of the story – but the resolution, when it comes, is relatively understated. It may be that it is in fact supposed to be blackly comic – after so many fake demises, Norman ends up assuming he’s asleep, which proves to be a serious mistake – but the script is not quite sharp enough for the results to be particularly amusing.\n\nThat said, there is, of course, a masterly performance from Denholm Elliott to enjoy, which is the episode’s main treat. Ineffectual and/or seedy men were really his speciality, usually in a supporting capacity, and he is, it almost goes without saying, on fine form here. He keeps you watching even after it’s become quite clear how the episode’s going to function, even if not where it’s going. And Sasdy has fun with the more surreal elements of the story, which are quite different from the stuff of the relatively grounded feature films he made for Hammer. Rude Awakening probably counts as only a minor item on the CV of both men, but it brings a certain style of surreal British horror to the small screen reasonably effectively.\n\nRead Full Post »"
