        "text": "Upstairs, Downstairs Season Three abandons the idea of keeping the series within the reign of Edward VII and jumps forward two years to cover the pre-war period 1912-14. A higher budget than before is evident with a greater use of location shooting.\n\nA few cast changes are apparent. Rachel Gurney expressed a desire to move on from the series, afraid of being typecast. She did however agree to guest star in the first episode so that a suitable plot could be written for Lady Marjorie's leaving. Frail middle-class secretary Hazel is introduced as the new mistress of the house.\n\nNicola Pagett had walked out on the show after the previous season following a disagreement about her non-appearance in a proposed (but never made) cinema feature film based on the series (which would have seen Sarah having an affair with Lady Marjorie's brother, Hugo). Her character, Elizabeth, is mentioned as having moved to America. A new character â Richard's ward, Georgina Worsley â is introduced later in the season in order to maintain the correct balance of ages within the programme.\n\nThe run of episodes is more consistent than the previous seasons â there being fewer high and low points. One of the best segments is A Change of Scene, the \"downstairs\" thread of which finds Hudson indulging in much soul-searching as to whether his loyalty to the Bellamys outweighs his desire to accept a satisfying new job that he has been offered at a large country house. Also enjoyable is Goodwill to All Men which sees Daisy, a new maid, and Georgina planning an ill-fated Christmas visit to Daisy's estranged family in the East End of London. Rose's Pigeon sees the return to Eaton Place of Alfred the footman from the first series, this time on the run after killing his homosexual lover.\n\nDesirous of Change sees Richard Bellamy falling in love with a gold-digging French countess. It is a somewhat strange episode which, by the third part, is even taking on overtones of a trouser-dropping Brian Rix farce!\n\nThis season won an Emmy, and the corresponding Golden Globe, for Outstanding Drama Series. Jean Marsh picked up an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. As if these weren't enough, Angela Baddeley was also nominated for the Outstanding Continuing Performance by a Supporting Actress Emmy! Back in its home country, Season Three won the BAFTA for Best Drama Series."
