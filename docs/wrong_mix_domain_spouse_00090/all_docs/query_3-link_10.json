It is part of the series of Edgar Wallace Mysteries films made at Merton Park Studios.\n\nVince Howard and John Bell are prison cellmates awaiting their release. When Bell is found with a knife his release is delayed by three months. He asks Howard to visit his wife Mary, who is blind. Once out of jail, Howard discovers that his own wife has left him. He starts to live with Mary. Knowing that Bell has money stashed away from a robbery, on his release Howard offers to drive him to get the stolen cash. Howard kills him and he returns with the money to Mary, who drugs him and makes to run off with her friend Michael Forrest. Howard recovers from the dope and kills Forest and then Mary.\n\nJeremy Kemp as Vince Howard\n\nBernard Archard as Michael Forrest\n\nRosemary Leach as Mary Bell\n\nPhilip Locke as John Bell\n\nElizabeth Begley as Mrs Holden\n\nJean Marsh as Grace\n\nRonald Leigh-Hunt as prison governor\n\nMike Pratt as Harry\n\nHarry Longhurst as Peters\n\nAlec Bregonzi as garage proprietor\n\nKeith Smith as ticket collector\n\nEdward Dentith as prison officer\n\nVictor Charrington as chief prison officer\n\nKine Weekly wrote: \"This is a somewhat far-fetched story of double dealing and one which, in the first few reels at least, strikes some as preposterous. However, it has the Wallace surprises to bring it back on a saner level and the result is holding, and sometimes violent melodrama. ... Like all the pictures in this series it pours a pint into a half pint measure and this restriction of footage, while keeping the interest vibrantly alive, is an example of what may be achieved as opposed to the so often overlong film. Jeremy Kemp is good as a man whose morals obviously deteriorate at the thought of money while Bernard Archard is a disarming schemer, Rosemary Leach too, is quite convincing as the blind wife with deep laid plans for a future on her unfortunate husband's ill-gotten gains. Philip Locke, though a crook, is the one character to win a modicum of audience sympathy.\"[2]"
