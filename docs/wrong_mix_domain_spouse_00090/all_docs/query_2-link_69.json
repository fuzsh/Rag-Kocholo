        "text": "15 Celebs Who've Opened Up About What Their First Dates Were Like With Other Famous People\n\nJohn Krasinski thought there was no chance he was going to get a second date with Emily Blunt, so for their first date he decided to do something random and wild: they went to a shooting range.\n\n1. First, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively's first date was a double date, and they weren't even dating each other. Ryan explained they had remained friends after filming Green Lantern and talked frequently, then one day they were both heading to Boston and ended up taking the train together. This all led to their first date, which they recreated on their 10th anniversary.\n\n2. Sarah Hyland revealed her first date with now-husband Wells Adams was at her house, and he made her shrimp tacos. Sarah said their first date came right after a kidney transplant, so she was quarantined at home and couldn't go out, so Wells came to her. \"He had cooked for me, and I never had a man cook for me before, so it was really special,\" Sarah said.\n\n3. Viola Davis recalled her now-husband Julius Tennon showed off his \"Texas hospitality\" on their first date. He took her to a restaurant in Santa Monica and then drove her home. She said, \"He drove me to the front curb and he shook my hand. He said I was beautiful and that he'd had such a beautiful time. And he stayed there until I got to the door of my apartment. He was such a gentleman.\"\n\n4. Jimmy Fallon hilariously had no idea he was even on a first date with Nicole Kidman until Nicole told him it was actually a date in 2015. Jimmy thought it was a casual hang because Nicole was interested in casting him in Bewitched, but Nicole revealed she liked him. \"After about an hour and a half, I thought, He has NO interest...this is SO embarrassing.\"\n\nYou can watch the full moment with Jimmy and Nicole below:\n\n5. Sophie Turner once said that before her first meeting with Joe Jonas, she thought, \"He's gonna be such a dick.\" She actually invited all of her guy friends to go with her on their first date because she was \"still worried that he could be a catfish\" after he had asked her out by sliding into her DMs. Sophie also recalled that on their first date, Joe told her he's often told that he looks like young George Clooney, and Sophie called him out on it.\n\n6. John Krasinski brought Emily Blunt \"to a gun range\" for their first date, after they previously met when they were both out to dinner with other people. John said they both had never been and he was \"so sure\" there was no way Emily would ever want to go out with him again that he just thought why not do this random, wild date idea? They left pretty quickly and ended up just having pizza at his apartment.\n\n7. Hilarie Burton Morgan said she had \"never dated an actor\" before she was introduced to her now-husband, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, on a blind date, which was set up by Jensen and Danneel Ackles. On their first date, Hilarie revealed on her book tour for Grimoire Girl that they hung out at a bar and she didn't think it would go any further. Soon after, Jeffrey asked Hilarie to come to New Mexico with him, where he was filming a new project.\n\n8. In his memoir, Spare, Prince Harry talked about his first date with Meghan Markle recalling that he was 30 minutes late to meet her. \"Red-cheeked, puffing, sweaty, half an hour late, I ran into the restaurant, into the quiet room, and found her sitting at a small area on a low velvet sofa in front of a low coffee table,\" he wrote. \"I'd seen so many photos of her from fashion shoots and TV sets, all glam and glossy, but here she was, in the flesh, no frills, no filterâ€¦ and even more beautiful. Heart-attack beautiful.\"\n\n9. After Priyanka Chopra turned down Nick Jonas several times, they reconnected at the 2017 Met Gala and she eventually agreed to go on a date with him. She said he invited her to go see Beauty and the Beast at the Hollywood Bowl with a few of his friends, and she brought a friend, too.\n\n10. Kelsea Ballerini recently shared a video she took for a friend before going on her first date with Chase Stokes. She showed off her outfit and said they were \"going to the sushi place\" and that she'd call her friend tomorrow \"with the full update.\" Kelsea also adorably pumped herself up in the video, saying, \"You just go and you eat food and you talk about things that you do. OK.\"\n\nYou can watch the full TikTok below:\n\n@kelseaballerini\n\nhappy weekend heres a video i sent to my best friend before my first date with chase ðŸ¥¹ðŸ˜­ #howdoidothis #rollingupthewelcomemat\n\nâ™¬ How Do I Do This - Kelsea Ballerini\n\nKelsea Ballerini / TikTok / Via tiktok.com\n\n11. Dylan Sprouse met his now-wife, Barbara Palvin, at a party, and after they both left, she followed him on Instagram so he slid into her DMs. Then, six months went by before Barbara responded and she ended up flying to China, where he was working, for their first official date.\n\n12. Pete Davidson revealed his first date with Ariana Grande was after the 2018 Met Gala, and he didn't even think it was a date. He said he went over to her apartment in sweatpants and a T-shirt, while she was \"coming from the Met [Gala].\"\n\n13. Lauren Miller Rogen recounted that for her first date with now-husband Seth Rogen, they went and played mini golf \"and then got in a major car accident on the freeway.\" She elaborated, saying, \"A 16-year-old had stolen his dad's car and hit us. He drove off and we spun across three lanes of traffic.\"\n\n14. David Beckham met his now-wife Victoria Beckham when she attended one of his soccer matches in London. Eventually, Victoria wrote her number down on her train ticket and gave it to David so they could continue talking, and he said he still has the train ticket today. They went on their first date to a small restaurant, and Victoria shared a photo of her passing by it in 2013.\n\n15. And finally, Jodie Turner-Smith revealed that she and Joshua Jackson \"had a one-night stand\" after they first met at a party. \"First of all, I saw him before he saw me and when I saw him, I was like, 'I want that,'\" she joked. In 2021, Joshua talked about their first date, saying, \"It was sealed with a kiss that night and then we didn't leave each other's sides for, well, three years now.\"\n\nShare This Article"
