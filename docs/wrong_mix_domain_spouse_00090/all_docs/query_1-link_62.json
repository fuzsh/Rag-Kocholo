        "text": "A Walk in the Park: Day Five\n\nWe've finally arrived at the Central Plaza! I'm glad we're here, because this is one of my favorite areas of Disneyland.\n\nIf I could have worked all my shifts at the Information Board, I certainly would have!\n\nWhat can one say?\n\nThere are often service vehicles on Main Street when the Park is closed; I'm happy to have avoided that here.\n\nKevin Yee liked this second photo enough to use it on the cover of the preview edition of Mouse Trap.\n\nWell, the Park's going to open soon, so what better place to leave you? If you move off quietly, you may be able to avoid attracting Security's attention. So go off to explore your favorite corner of Disneyland before Guests arrive, but remember--I never saw you!\n\nThesaurus Statistics\n\nThis probably requires a small bit of explanation...\n\nTotal number of terms: Every term in the thesaurus (obviously). This includes 20,432 dates (e.g., 2008-07-27). Since these have relationships and notes just like other terms, I have no problem including them in the count.\n\nNon-postable terms: These are what is known as the lead-in vocabulary. Disneyland Omnibus would lead one to the postable term Omnibus.\n\nTop terms: A key part of the thesaurus is the hierarchy, and this is the number of terms at the top. Now, with the structure I'm using it shouldn't be as high as it is. I'd like to have only 10-15 top terms. A large number of the top terms, then, are terms I've picked up while going through sources that I still need to fit into the conceptual structure.\n\nOrphan terms: These are a subset of the top terms that don't have relations to other terms. This number should be 0.\n\nSubject categories: This is another means of classification outside of the hierarchy. For instance, for people and organizations in the thesaurus I have a \"Role\" classification. The Roles include Atmosphere Talent, Cast Member, lessee personnel, and Retlaw personnel.\n\nHierarchical relationships: Hierarchy is used for structure and to facilitate searching. Fantasy on Parade has broader terms events, promotions, and programs by names (a term which then functions something like an authority list) and parades.\n\nEquivalence relationships: The Omnibus example above is an equivalent relationship--where I've defined that one term can be used for two terms. This needn't be confined to nomenclature issues. If I wanted lower specificity, I could have Omnibus (along with Fire Engine, Horseless Carriage (Red), etc.) point to Main Street Vehicles. But with this project I've been much more inclined to address distinctions than to lump things together.\n\nAssociative relationships: These types of relations call attention to other terms that might be of interest. In the Library of Congress Subject Headings, these are just RT--related terms. While I do denote some relations this way, I've also defined a fair number of more specific relationships. For example, Dominguez, Ron PFMD [performed as/in] Davy Crockett (walk-around character). Fantasia Gardens PRED [had predecessor] Motor Boat Cruise. (In time I might get more specific and create a Motor Boat Cruise Dock term.)\n\nA Walk in the Park: Day One\n\nFor the next several days we'll be taking a leisurely stroll through pre-opening Disneyland--and I do mean leisurely! It's going to take us five days to get from the parade gate next to \"it's a small world\" down to the Central Plaza (though the actual walk only took me seven minutes). Alas, I do not have dozens of pictures to show, but they should provide a different look at the Park to those of you who have never been Cast Members. The photos were all taken on September 3, 2002.\n\nWe're not getting too far out of the gate today...\n\n\"it's a small world\" is here under renovation, as the Park undid the Disneyland Paris-induced changes from the early 1990s. Not only did they restore the white facade, but also reverted to using the original music tracks recorded for the New York World's Fair. The music had been replaced with the John Debney-scored tracks recorded for Disneyland Paris, because the quality of the mono mixes--used at Disneyland since 1966--didn't measure up. Work on a never-released box set of New York World's Fair music unearthed the original recordings, permitting their return to Disneyland.\n\nIt looks like it's going to be a warm day--the sun's already beating down well before any Guests have arrived! I just checked, and it did get up to about 90 degrees that day.\n\nYou can see that off-season work has started, with the Matterhorn Bobsleds closed for refurbishment.\n\nTomorrow we venture off the parade route to enter the heart of Fantasyland!\n\nResearch Update\n\nGenerally, you can assume that a lack of posts means that I'm engaged in work on the Disneyland Compendium. (Well, that or my master's thesis--it doesn't appear to be writing itself!) The past couple of weeks I have focused on publications: Disneyland Line, Disneyland Holiday-Vacationland, Disney News-Disney Magazine, Backstage Disneyland, Disneylander, Cast Member Reference Guides, guidemaps and souvenir guidebooks, mainly. I've created a spreadsheet to track what I have immediately available to me (either a hard copy or a digital original or surrogate) and feel I now have a much better grasp of that. I still don't completely know what I'm missing because lists of these publications mostly don't exist! This work doesn't include the thousands and thousands of newspaper articles and advertisements, either. (Yes, I realize it's a bit... obsessive.)\n\nI have a hair under 800 Disneyland Lines now (thanks to Kevin Yee sending me a couple hundred in the mail last week). From about twenty issues I've pulled out information for more than a thousand terms! There are some excellent articles in the Line about how the Park works, and I'm very excited to sift through it all.\n\nKevin and I still plan to have the first part of the Compendium available in about two years. Right now I'm thinking that might just be a print encyclopedia, but we haven't ruled anything out. Heck, we won't even be doing any writing for at least another year. I'll still be spending untold hours collecting the documents, making contacts, and building the thesaurus. If I disappear for brief spells, you can just think of the time you would have spent reading the blog as deferred to the publication!\n\nFred Burri, Disneyland Yodeler\n\nIt's yodeling day here at Disneyland Nomenclature. I am quite a fan of yodeling, perhaps because it's tied to two places that I love--the Alps and the American West. Cowboy songs often feature yodeling; in Disneyland's Frontierland, you can hear a bit of this in the \"Pecos Bill\" recording done by Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers. Of course, you can also find recordings of yodeling in the Matterhorn Bobsleds queue and at the Village Haus restaurant. But in the golden days of yore, you used to be able to hear live yodeling at Disneyland!\n\nWhen Walt brought the Matterhorn to Disneyland, he brought in some other elements to lend authenticity to the experience. There were the well-known mountain climbers (and the Sierra Club members, first to scale the mountain for its televised debut), the Tyrolean Band, and... Disneyland's very own yodeler, Fred Burri, who uniquely entertanied Guests for about eighteen years.\n\nI don't have too much to say about him right now. I found a blog post about Fred that mentions an album he recorded: Fred Burri, Disneyland Yodler with Alphorn and Swiss-Accordion, Swiss Folkmusic and Yodeling. It wasn't recorded at or by Disneyland, but if anybody has a copy, I'd love to listen!\n\nAlso, you'll really have to forgive my tardiness in passing this information along (I've had this post as a draft for about a month!), but Fred is performing this week in Portland, Oregon, at the Swissfest 2008. If you're in the area, that starts tomorrow!\n\n1,000+ Disneyland Cast Members and Lessee Personnel\n\nI present you today with a list. Well, two lists. One aspect of the thesaurus of the Compendium project is gathering information on the people who have worked at the Park, either employed directly by Disney or working for a lessee (especially in the early days). The lists below are far from comprehensive or even systematic, but merely represent what I've gleaned from the sources I've examined so far. For almost all of these I have more information than just a name--often at least a department or work location. Some of the Cast Members originally worked as lessee personnel, and undoubtedly in greater numbers than these lists indicate. But, one has to start somewhere! I'll start with the lessee personnel, since that's the shorter list. Below that you can find my hopelessly partial list of Disneyland Cast Members. The following lists do not include personnel who worked for Retlaw, the Disneyland Hotel under the Wrather Corporation, or contractor personnel.\n\nLessee Personnel\n\nAllen, W.

Well, test yourself! Courtesy of the July 14, 1977 Disneyland Line, I present \"a quiz of some facts that may have fallen by the wayside during the last [five] decades.\" (No cheating, Todd.)\n\n1. Holidayland was;\n\nA. An RV Park\n\nB. A motel in Fullerton\n\nC. A movie starring Bing Crosby\n\nD. A picnic and recreation area adjacent to the Park\n\n2. Who was Professor Keller?\n\nA. The first instructor at the Disney University\n\nB. A gunfighter in Frontierland\n\nC. Star of \"The Absent Minded Professor\"\n\nD. A lion tamer who performed on Main St.\n\n3. The Red Wagon Inn was;\n\nA. Opposite of the Red Wagon Outt\n\nB. A new Mattel toy\n\nC. A movie starring Fess Parker\n\nD. Predecessor of the Plaza Inn\n\n4. The Thimbledrome was;\n\nA. A sewing bee\n\nB. A Tomorrowland location where model airplanes and boats were demonstrated\n\nC. A sports arena in Frontierland\n\nD. A movie theatre in Adventureland\n\n5. Lilliputian Land was;\n\nA. A small country east of France\n\nB. A typo\n\nC. A proposed but never built land for the Park\n\nD. What you say after someone sneezes\n\n6. The star of the Golden Horseshoe when it opened was;\n\nA. Hoagey Carmichael\n\nB. Rex The Wonder Toad\n\nC. Wally Boag\n\nD. Humphrey Bogart\n\n7. The Mickey Mouse Club Headquarters was located;\n\nA. On Tom Sawyer's Island\n\nB. In The Opera House\n\nC. In Central First Aid\n\nD. In San Juan Capistrano\n\n8.

[early release]\n\nB. In 1956\n\nC. As a distress signal\n\nD. In 1958\n\nAnswers later! Interestingly, this article includes the photo Daveland posted of the employee cafeteria in the back of the Red Wagon Inn, but reveals slightly more of the photo:\n\nUPDATE: And the answers are: 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, 4-B, 5-C, 6-C, 7-B, 8-C, 9-A, 10-B. Yes Tim, you win! Some of those were pretty tough. Who knew this \"Wally Boag\" character was the star of the Golden Horseshoe?!\n\nDeteriorating Remnants of Disneyland's Past\n\nVintageDisneylandTickets asked about a companion photo (to my Small Update post) showing the rotting Gullywhumper keel boat.\n\nIt doesn't look so bad from the river level, because you can't see all the water inside! You can, however, make out plant growth just below the shutters. I took a few dozen photos of the former Cascade Peak area (does it have a name now? Cascade Knoll? Non-Cascade Non-Peak?) on June 28; below are a selection.\n\nThis would be a classic view of the waterfalls. I never saw the Mine Train pass by here, but I can well imagine all the activity on a busy summer day at this crook of the river--a busy island, keel boats, canoes, the Mark Twain and the Columbia, the water animation of the peak, and the mine trains filled with Guests! I think some of the most interesting parts of the Park are where Guests experience attractions while also seeing other Guests getting a different experience. Tomorrowland's \"A World on the Move\" design perhaps expressed this best, but you could also see this in Fantasyland near Alice in Wonderland (the Alice attraction itself, the Matterhorn Bobsleds, the Mad Tea Party, the Storybook Land Canal Boats, and the Skyway) and on Main Street, U.S.A., with the train and Main Street Vehicles. The everything-but-the-kitchen sink rendering of the Indiana Jones attraction that incorporated the Jungle Cruise, the Disneyland Railroad, and several Indy attractions would have been spectacular.\n\nIn this photo you can see two closed attractions and one operating one!\n\nThe engine has seen better days.\n\nThe coupling has seen better days.\n\nThe ore cars have seen better days.\n\nThe track has... oh, you get the idea!"
