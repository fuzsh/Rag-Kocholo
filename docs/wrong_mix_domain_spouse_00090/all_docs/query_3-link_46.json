        "text": "Doctor Who has long been my favorite show, but until recently rewatchings of old episodes have been few and far between. This has changed in the last couple of years as I have been using birthday and Christmas money to buy some of the old episodes, usually enjoying them with one or two of my nerdier daughters. This year, though, my wife and I bought a year of Britbox for each other as a gift, which gives me access to nearly all of classic Who.\n\nContinue reading The Invisible Enemy [Classic Doctor Who]\n\nLately, I’ve been going through some other movies and shows and finding where there are actors or creative talent that they have in common with Doctor Who.\n\nAlso recently, I finished going through all the “Emma Peel” episodes of the 1960s TV show The Avengers and blogging about each one (starting here), including noting when its guest cast were also people who made appearances in Doctor Who.

Indeed, when Blake’s 7 hit the United States in the 1980’s, it was really the Doctor Who crowd who formed the fanbase.\n\n(Daily Doctor Who #119)\n\nContinue reading Blake’s 7–the Doctor Who Connections (Part 2–the Actors)"
