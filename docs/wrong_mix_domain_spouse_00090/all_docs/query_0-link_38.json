She needed emergency brain surgery twice in the first 24 hours; her life hung in the balance. Then she entered that near lifeless state - coma. For weeks after the operations a dedicated hospital team, her mother, her relatives, school friends, and even the pop star Shakin' Stevens, strove to break through and penetrate the silent, dark world which enclosed her. Coma is not a medical form of the Sleeping Beauty fairytale. When the victim recovers consciousness there is no magic ending, only a long - and sometimes painful -\n\nProgress towards a full place back in the life so nearly lost. For Connie, and her devoted mother, the journey starts on the street where she was knocked down, continues in hospital and will go on for most of her life.\n\nResearch PENNY HALLOWES Film editor CHRIS MASON Director ALEX MCCALL\n\nProducer DESMOND WILCOX BBC Scotland\n\n*CEEFAX SUBTITLES\n\nContributors\n\nUnknown :\n\nDesmond Wilcox\n\nUnknown :\n\nConnie [text removed]\n\nEditor :\n\nChris Mason\n\nDirector :\n\nAlex McCall\n\nProducer :\n\nDesmond Wilcox"
