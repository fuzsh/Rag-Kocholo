        "text": "Cause Celebre (Oct 1977) Glynis Johns - Her Majesty's Theatre London\n\nCause Célèbre or A Woman of Principle is a 1975 radio play by the English author Terence Rattigan. It was inspired by the trial of Alma Rattenbury and her teenage lover in 1935 for the murder of her third husband Francis Rattenbury and first broadcast on the BBC on 27 October 1975. Rattigan was then commissioned to rewrite it into a stage play ready to be produced in Autumn 1976, but his terminal cancer and casting problems meant he was only able to start work in January 1977, alongside Robin Midgely. This stage version premiered on 4 July 1977 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London. A 1987 television version of the stage play starred Helen Mirren as Alma. The stage play itself was revived at the Old Vic from March to June 2011 to mark Rattigan's centenary, with Alma played by Anne-Marie Duff and Edith Davenport by Niamh Cusack. A new production of the radio play was aired again by BBC Radio 4 on 25 June 2011 directed by Thea Sharrock with original music by Adrian Johnston and featuring the Old Vic cast: Cause Celebre (Oct 1977) Glynis Johns, Lee Montague, Helen Lindsay, Bernard Archard, Patrick Barr - Her Majesty's Theatre London.\n\nCause Celebre (Play) Glynis Johns, Lee Montague, Helen Lindsay, Bernard Archard, Patrick Barr - Her Majesty's Theatre London\n\nB&W Program / Playbill Date Oct 1977\n\nRun: Jul 04, 1977 - ?\n\nSize 215 x 135 mm Pages 25 Great info on Show and Cast\n\nCondition:Used Good 7/10\n\n(Please Note scans are low res for fast loading)"
