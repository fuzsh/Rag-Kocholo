The childhood home of Beyoncé caught fire early Christmas morning, leaving the pop star’s old house wrapped in flames well into the second story.

Officials told ABC 13 that the fire was reported around 2 am, but was quickly put out once fire teams arrived. “They did a great job,” District Chief Justin Barnes told ABC 13. “I’m going to say in less than 10 minutes, we had a really good grip on this fire.”

While the Knowles family moved out years ago, the home is still considered a landmark in Houston’s Third Ward. Beyoncé has consistently paid homage to her time in Houston, peppering dozens of references to the city in multiple songs. In 2017, following the devastation of Hurricane Harvey in Texas, the superstar pledged the help of her philanthropic arm, BeyGOOD. She also visited with Hurricane Harvey evacuees and helped distribute food at her hometown church.

“This today is a celebration of survival,” she said at the time. “Y’all are my family. Houston is my home. I thank God that y’all are safe, that your children are safe. The things that really matter are your health and your children, and your family and your life.”
