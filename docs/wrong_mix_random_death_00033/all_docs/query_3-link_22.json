        "text": "Beyoncé’s childhood home in Houston caught fire early on Christmas morning, though the family living there escaped safely.\n\nThe fire was reported at about 2am on Monday. The local fire department arrived on the scene of the two-story brick house within three to five minutes, the Houston Chronicle reported.\n\n“We had it contained in about 10 minutes,” Justin Barnes, a Houston fire department district chief, told the newspaper.\n\nBeyoncé Knowles’s family bought the home on the 2400 block of Rosedale in 1982, and Beyoncé lived there until she was five years old. She was seen taking photos of the property when she was in her home town for her Renaissance World Tour.\n\nThe home in the historic Riverside Terrace neighborhood was built in 1946. In February, Beyoncé won her 32nd Grammy award, making her the most awarded artist in Grammys history.\n\nA message sent to Beyoncé’s publicist was not immediately returned late on Monday.\n\nThe cause of the blaze was under investigation."
