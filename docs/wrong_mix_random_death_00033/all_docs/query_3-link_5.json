        "text": "HOUSTON – Once upon a time, on Sept. 4, 1981, there was a baby girl born in Third Ward to two hardworking parents.\n\nAs that baby girl grew up, she was growing into a music sensation, traveling across the city of Houston alongside her friends and family while singing to anyone and everyone who would listen.\n\nSEE ALSO: Cowboy Carter is HERE!🤠 Beyoncé drops 26-song track list with features from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson\n\nFrom there, the queen of music herself, THEE Beyoncé was created.\n\nBeyoncé Knowles-Carter got her start right in our backyard but many don’t know the details of her upbringing.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn 1990, Beyoncé was a student in Houston Independent School District and was enrolled in Parker Elementary School.\n\nShe later attended Welch Middle School of Fine Arts program, alongside her cousin and groupmate, Kelly Rowland, and then the High School for the Performing and Elsik High School in Alief.\n\nBeyoncé debatably got her first true start at her mother’s Headliners Salon in Third Ward. She has said time and time again that she forced her mother’s clients to listen to her and her friends while they were being styled.\n\nSEE ALSO: Beyoncé's BeyGOOD Foundation to give $250K in scholarships to aspiring cosmetologists in Houston following Cécred launch\n\nOver in Third Ward, the famous soul food restaurant, ‘This Is It’ has pictures of Beyoncé and her friends, along with their signatures. The folks over there said that the eatery was one of her FAVORITE places to stop while the girls were out on tour.\n\nThe original members of Destiny’s Child, Beyoncé, LaTavia Roberson, Kelly Rowland, and LeToya Luckett, were part of a KPRC 2 special when Texas became the first state to adopt the ‘Baby Moses’ law. The segment, broadcast on December 21, 1999, reports on a public education campaign about the new law led by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee and publicly supported by Destiny’s Child.\n\nDestiny’s Child also made two appearances at the shuttered stadium during the Rodeo season in 2001 and 2002. The 2001 show was filmed for a pay-per-view TV event, which meant the crowd got to sit through multiple renditions of songs to get different camera angles.\n\nBeyoncé's name came from her mother’s maiden last name. Tina Knowles, affectionately known as Mama Tina, was born Celestine Beyoncé.\n\n“My name was Celestine Beyoncé, which at that time was not a cool thing to have that weird name,” she told the L.A. Times. “I wanted my name to be Linda Smith.”\n\nAs the youngest of seven children, Mama Tina said she and her brother Skip were the only members of her family to have the “Beyoncé” spelling.\n\n“Why is my brother’s name spelled B-E-Y-I-N-C-E?” Tina recalled asking her mother."
