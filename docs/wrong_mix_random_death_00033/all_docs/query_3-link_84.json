She wrote a song called Bootylicious about three years ago, and now the word is in the dictionary. \"It's silly really, and to be honest, I hate the word,\" she says.\n\nFramework:\n\nShe's 22 years old, 5ft 7in, brown-eyed and brown-haired, and she's still not satisfied that her stomach is small enough. \"It's always been on the big side,\" she says, \"but everyone says I worry too much.\"\n\nShe has long, muscular legs but is tall, thin and very curvy and hopes to stay that way by looking after her body. Because the group wear so much make-up when performing, which can clog the pores, they use astringent to get it all off. \"Don't go to sleep with even a little make-up on your face,\" she advises.\n\nExercise:\n\nSwimming, roller-skating, jogging and aerobics - these are her favourite activities. \"But I also try to run for 30 minutes at least once a day, no matter where I am,\" she says. \"I value exercise highly and do it religiously - I do as many sit-ups a night as I can, and spend 45 minutes of cardio work each day.\n\nDiet:\n\n\"I can't cook, apart from spaghetti, that is.\" Her favourite food is fried chicken, but she only allows herself that as a special treat. \"I say no, no to carbohydrates and eat protein and vegetables. I also drink lots of water.\" She prefers Pepsi to alcohol. \"I've tasted alcohol, but don't drink,\" she says. \"I wouldn't start to drink as I might want to do it all the time.\"\n\nLove life:\n\nShe is currently linked with rap star Jay-Z, although she recently said that, in spite of the rumours that the two will marry, she \"has no immediate plans to walk town the aisle and has no idea who her ideal man is.\"\n\nBefore that she was briefly with singer and producer Pharrell Williams.\n\nThey first met when he produced her track Work It Out.\n\n\"I am attracted to cute guys who are level-headed and have a spiritual side,\" she says. \"There's no such thing as a `perfect man' because everyone has weaknesses, but for me it's someone who will show me things I can't see myself - someone who will make me to be attracted to him from the moment he enters a room.\""
