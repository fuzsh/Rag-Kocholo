        "text": "Amelia Robinson is the Columbus Dispatch's opinion editor.\n\nThis column is about Beyoncé, First, humor me while I talk about my niece.\n\nMy niece is a smart young woman. My niece sometimes doesn't know what she is talking about.\n\nTwo things can be right at the same time.\n\nMy niece I and I got into a spirited debate while singing karaoke at her parents' Cleveland house over the holidays. The topic was Luke Combs' version of Tracy Chapman's Fast Car vs. Tracy Chapman's version of the song she blessed the world with back in 1988.\n\nFact: My niece is a smart young woman who does not know what she is talking about when it comes to Fast Car.\n\nShe wrongly thinks Combs' version is superior to Chapman’s, something I think he would disagree with vehemently.\n\nAs I — a smart not that old or young woman — told her, Combs' Fast Car is very good, but come on, it is not Tracy Campman's Fast Car good.\n\nNo one can ever Fast Car better than Tracy Chapman can Fast Car.\n\nHere's a good thing. Tracy Chapman, Luke Combs drove me to tears with 'Fast Car' Grammys duet.\n\nFull stop. Period. Get your life together. Cleveland native Tracy Chapman is Cleveland native Tracy Chapman.\n\n\"A lot of Black people like country music, too,\" my niece retorted as if it were a revelation.\n\nIt definitely 1,000% is not.\n\nOf course, Beyoncé can make a country album\n\nThis isn't Texas it's Columbus, Ohio, but country is among the many genres of music we listen to here. I have a particular affinity to old and pop country. I am talking Dolly, Willie, Johnny, Patsy, Kenny, Conway, and my girl Reba.\n\nMy Garth Brooks' \"The Hits\" CD helped get me through my studies at Ohio University. Years later, Martina McBride laughed when I asked her \"Where would you be if you weren't here with me?\" when I interviewed her way back in 2014.\n\n\"Probably drinking a beer somewhere,\" the icon told me.\n\nAmericans are not as foreign to other Americans as Americans have been led to believe. Black musicians helped shape country music and many of us like country music artists as much as any other American.\n\nIt is no wonder that Beyoncé Knowles-Carter does. She's from the Lone Star State just like George Strait, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and my girl Tanya Tucker.\n\nBeyoncé is as trademark American as George Strait, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and my girl Tanya Tucker.\n\nShe hails from Houston just about an hour southwest of Saratoga, Texas, the birthplace of George Jones who many consider one of the greatest country singers of all time.\n\nDiversity is buried. As an Asian American, I don't look like the country music artists I love\n\nAll this being true, it is weird that anyone is questioning why my girl Beyoncé would put out two country singles, \"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"16 Carriages,\" and announced a full \"Act II\" album.\n\nEven more bizarrely, some country stations that have banned her songs, illogically justified the decision.\n\nIt is far stranger that Keith Urban from New Zealand and Shania Twain from Windsor, Canada, are country stars.\n\nRooted partly in Appalachian ballads, the blues and other musical traditions, country music is as American as it comes and draws from the diversity of this nation.\n\nAs Josephine Chu pointed out in a 2021 USA TODAY column, Native Hawaiians brought the steel guitar to the mainland. The banjo was brought to America by West African slaves.\n\nPerhaps some people just can’t stand Bey. Perhaps some of the backlash against her hit country song is yet another example of American racism making people say and do ridiculous things.\n\n\"I requested 'Texas Hold ‘Em' at my local country radio station (KYKC) and after requesting, I received an email from the radio station stating 'We do not play Beyoncé on KYKC as we are a country music station,'\" the user wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nOf course, Dolly loves Bey\n\nQueen Bey can sing country if she wants - she is country. Listen to her accent. She is from Texas, y'all.\n\n(Apologies to Texans. This born and bred Ohioan typed \"y'all\" only to make a point. I know it is your thing. I ain't Texas.)\n\nForget Taylor Swift. Is Biden using Beyoncé to destroy country music by making it good?\n\nHard to stop iconic talent from being iconic and talented. Artists stretch themselves, often breaking down barriers in the process. It is a good thing for us all.\n\nLord knows the world couldn't stop Queen Dolly Parton from putting out a rock album or, for that matter, jump into the world of pop and leaving her mark on Hollywood.\n\nIt is awesome that Dolly and other country music artists have congratulated Beyoncé, one of the most decorated entertainers in modern history, for her latest milestone: becoming the first black woman to secure the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of Beyoncé and very excited that she's done a country album,\" Dolly wrote. \"So, congratulations on your Billboard Hot Country number one single,\" Parton wrote Thursday on her social media accounts, once again proving why so many Americans love her.\n\nMy niece, an unabashed member of the Beyoncé Beehive who would prefer the world call herself Aryoncé, and I may never agree on who sang Fast Car best — I am 1,000% right — but I know we both are looking forward to Bey's country album.\n\nThis ain't Texas, but who knows, maybe one day she will take a place among my favorite country artists. Dolly, Willie, Johnny, Patsy, Kenny, Conway, my girl Reba and Beyoncé?\n\nWe shall see, but I wouldn't bet against Texas on this one.\n\nAmelia Robinson is the Columbus Dispatch's opinion editor. She likes country but is far from Texas."
