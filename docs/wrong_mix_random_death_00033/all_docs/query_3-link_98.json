        "text": "There's a bittersweet quality to Beyoncé's 'Texas Hold 'Em' lyrics.\n\nGiddy up, hive! Beyoncé has officially invited us to a \"real-life hoedown\". What do her 'Texas Hold 'Em' lyrics mean though?\n\nOn Sunday (Feb 11), Beyoncé sent fans into meltdown with another iconic surprise drop. Following months of rumours, she finally revealed that Act II is a country album and it comes out on March 29th. On top of that, she also released two songs from the project. '16 Carriages' is a stirring ballad about her life and career and 'Texas Hold 'Em' is a country banger.\n\nREAD MORE: Beyoncé Cowboy Carter tracklist: All the collaborations and feature theories\n\nIn 'Texas Hold 'Em', Beyoncé gives us her own unique spin on a hoedown jam, playing into many country tropes. What is the song about though? Below is a full breakdown of Beyoncé's 'Texas Hold 'Em' lyrics and what they mean.\n\nWhat does 'Texas Hold 'Em' mean?\n\nYou don't have to be a poker fan to know that 'Texas Hold 'Em' is a popular variant of the card game. In the song, Beyoncé encourages her \"boy\" to \"lay [his] cards down\" and \"slow dance\" with her. She's literally and metaphorically asking him to stop playing, let his guard down and join her on the dance floor.\n\nHowever, the title is also a nod to Beyoncé's own roots. The star was famously born and raised in Houston, Texas and a key part of country music is paying homage to your hometown.\n\nBacked by authentic country production, the song is then overflowing with classic country references, dance directions and call and response lyrics. In the song, Beyoncé sings about a \"dive bar\", \"a real-life hoedown\" and \"rugged whiskey\". She also sings about country attire, ending the song with the refrain: \"Take it to the floor now / Hoops, spurs, boots.\"\n\nIt's not all dancing and smiles though. In the first verse, Beyoncé alludes to hardships and using dance as an escape. She sings: \"There's a tornado / In my city / Hit the basement / That shit ain't pretty.\" In the second verse she adds: \"All of the problems / Just feel dramatic / And now we're runnin' to the first bar that we find.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The personal meaning behind Beyoncé's 16 Carriages lyrics explained\n\nSimilar to a lot of Renaissance, there's also a sense of yearning for a life that Beyoncé isn't able to lead because of her fame. In the pre-chorus, Beyoncé appears to imagine a reality in which she could just go to a dive bar with JAY-Z. She sings: \"We headed to the dive bar we always thought was nice / Then spin me in the middle, boy, I can't read your mind.\"\n\nIn the same way Beyoncé created her own club experience with Renaissance, she's now harking back to her country roots, and creating her own hoedown experience with Act II. And just like Renaissance did with dance music, she's reclaiming country music and reminding people that Black people invented the genre.\n\nAlongside Beyoncé's vocals, 'Texas Hold 'Em' features banjo and viola playing by Rhiannon Giddens. Rhiannon is a Black American musician who continually uses her work to remind people of country music's true origins.\n\nSo, 'Texas Hold 'Em' is a bop but there's also a lot of weight to it.
