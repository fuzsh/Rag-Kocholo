        "text": "Astrologists have suggested for a long time, to some degree, people born within certain dates or cycles of a month, share characteristics and/or similarities in personalities. Achiever’s of Color seeks to explore some of these theories by listing achievers born on the same day, however not necessarily the same year. Achiever’s also gives you a short profile of the achievers born on the same day, their accomplishments, background and beliefs. Some of these achievers you may have heard of, and some you will be introduced to for the first time, yet they are achievers who have made contributions to people of color and/or the world. This characterization of Virgo and other months of the year can be found in “Soul Vibrations: Astrology for African Americans,” by George Davis and Gilda Matthews.The signs of Virgo (said to be the critic) and Libra (the sign of balance) govern the month of September. We will identify September Virgo’s in this article. Virgo’s are perfectionist, making sure things are right. They may not do everything right themselves, and they may not be the neatest person in the house, but conflict comes into play whenever things are not as Virgo thinks they should be. Who are some famous Virgo perfectionists; Michael Jackson, born on August 29, and Tae Bo founder, Billy Blanks, born September 1.Virgo is the sign of the judge, and a good example of this is found in the life of Constance Baker Motley, born September 14, Joseph W. Hatchett, born September 17, appointed judge by former President Jimmy Carter, in 1979, and William Benson Bryant, born September 18, appointed judge in 1965, by President Lyndon B. Johnson. There are many athletically inclined individuals born in September under the sign of Virgo that you will read in the upcoming attached pages. Virgo’s are said to be fighters for racial justice, for which the lives of Roy Wilkins (Aug. 30), Maxine Waters (Aug. 31), Alfreda Duster (Sept. 3), Charles Hamilton Houston (Sept. 3), Charles Evers (Sept. 11), Ramona Edlin (Sept. 4), Israel Tribble (Sept. 4), Tavis Smiley (Sept. 13), Iyanla Vanzant (Sept. 13), Tyler Perry ( Sept. 13), Ruby Bridges (Sept. 8), Sojourner Truth (Sept. 19), and Richard Wright (Sept. 4 or 8), to name a few. Some Virgo’s were leaders who set the pace for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).This list is incomplete, but you will find information on achievers such as: Florence Kelley, Crispus Attucks Wright, Rev. Dr. Thomas Harris, Bishop Cornelius Henderson, Anne Moody, Bill Pinkney, Claude McKay, Nancy Prince Gardner, Henry Louis Gates, Claude Barnett, Andrew “Rube” Foster, and Mary M. Talbert Burnett, who were all born during the month of September, under the astrological sign of the Virgo. Virgo’s are said to be methodical, discriminating, and orderly. They see their main role in the scheme of things, to improve and perfect what has already been created. “I Analyze,” are their key words. Virgo’s have a very practical down-to-earth approach to life, yet very materialistic. Virgo is a twin sign like Gemini. They argue, but are dedicated to serving others. If things are seriously wrong, Virgo’s are the severest critics in the world; just listen to the comments of Tavis Smiley, Iyanla Van Zant, or even the films of Tyler Perry (the three of them share September 13 as their date of birth) Virgo’s are also gifted with a fine sense for music, which is certainly represented in the life of Michael Jackson, Brandford Marsalis, Otis Redding, Jose Feliciano, Julian Cannonball Adderley, B. B. King, K-Ci of Jodeci, Joe Simon, Macy Gray, Debbie Winans, Beyonce Knowles, Terry Ellis, Foxy Brown, CeCe Peniston, Charles “Buddy” Bolden, and Latimore, just to name a few.\n\nRemember, as you read about these achievers of color and their contributions, those born in September, under the Virgo sign, they are said to be the most deeply intellectual sign of the zodiac. They bring intellect to bear on every situation. Despite all these fine attributes, Virgo’s sometime wish they were born under a less demanding star sign. They do not view life through rose-colored glasses. They see life the way it is.\n\nKeep in mind, as you explore the lives of some of these individuals, they may not represent a perfect life; one to be modeled after. This article recognizes these individuals as achievers of color and not role models of color. However, something can be learned from their mistakes as well as their accomplishments; what to do and what not to do. Enjoy.\n\nBelow you’ll read about people born under the demanding sign of Virgo, in the month of September.\n\nSome of the sources from which information has been obtained from are listed after the achievers information.

Being multi-talented, Delsarte merged his sense of rhythm and drama with his visual awareness. Writing for The Atlantic Journal-Constitution, art critic Catherine Fox wrote, “Delsarte, a consummate craftsman, uses watercolor, pastel, and acrylic to make handsome, richly developed, and layered works that feature women dancing, moving in graceful arabesques accompanied by musicians of various sorts. There is no denying the beauty of the Morris Brown College professor’s paintings and works on paper. He orchestrates watercolor washes, pastel lines, passages of pattern, and realistic figures with aplomb.” Louis Delsarte was a figurative artist whose work reflected a departure from the realist style that was predominant among many of the African-American artists during the first half of the twentieth century. His multi-layered works have been described as illusionistic and myth-like, often crossing over into the world of abstraction.

Freelon, born September, 2, 1895, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, (died in 1960), becomes an educator and artist, a pioneer impressionist, the first African-American to hold such a distinguished position here or anywhere in the U.S. According to Paschall, Freelon believed that everyone could benefit from the study of art and he committed himself to the idea that teachers of art appreciation should be practicing artists. While Freelon chose not to follow the artistic path of other African-Americans of his day, he became very aware of the artistic renaissance centered in New York’s Harlem and exhibited his paintings with these artists. In 1935, Freelon produced a work strongly condemning racial oppression for the NAACP-sponsored exhibit called Barbecue – American Style on the injustice of lynching. Freelon disagreed with Alain Locke, a leader in the Harlem Renaissance, who believed that Black artists should look exclusively to Africa for inspiration.

On his way to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Nathaniel “Tiny” Archibald learned all about rising from desperate surroundings to extraordinary heights. It was an education that started early in life and served him well through a 14-year playing career that led him from the lowly Cincinnati Royals to an NBA Championship with the Boston Celtics. “Tiny” is the only player to lead the NBA in points and assists in the same season, during his career period in basketball. In an era when the game threatened to become the exclusive domain of gargantuan players, the 6-foot-1 Archibald proved that there would always be room for a speedy, smart, and creative small man. Archibald was raised in the South Bronx’s Patterson housing projects, one of America’s toughest ravaged ghettos. Archibald used his deftness with a basketball to steer clear of the drugs and violence that claimed many of his contemporaries. Fate, fortitude, and inspiration from unlikely places helped him persevere to become the pride of Patterson. Archibald-who was nicknamed after his father, “Tiny”-grew up in a two-bedroom apartment, the oldest of seven children. At age 14 Archibald effectively became head of the household when Big Tiny abandoned his wife and their children. Living in an environment that destroyed many close to him, Archibald easily could have succumbed to the temptations of the street. “It’s interesting,” Archibald, told Sport magazine in 1980, “how guys who are into drugs are always looking to get other guys involved, as if they want company when they go under. Me? I was always into basketball.” But basketball hardly seemed the natural course for the young Archibald. True, he had decent skills. But he was a small, painfully shy kid who lacked confidence on the court. He failed to make the basketball team his sophomore year at DeWitt Clinton High School and nearly dropped out of school. For 1972-1973 the Royals packed up and moved to Kansas City-Omaha, where they became the Kings. It was as a King that Archibald assumed his place among NBA royalty. He was a star with a big paycheck, a fancy car, and a happy family. Not a man to forget his roots, Archibald continued to be a presence in the troubled neighborhoods of New York, helping to run community programs and homeless shelters and counseling kids on the street. Before retiring at the end of the 1983-84 seasons, Archibald became the only player ever to lead the league in both scoring and assists in a season. The then, New York City Mayor, David Dinkins, honored Archibald for his work with the city’s youth in 1993.

She is also a former member of the Aural Exciters. Gardner became one of the leading lights of West End Records, a New York label that released some of the finest and most influential disco during the late 1970s and early ‘80s. At a very young age, Gardner knew that she wanted to act and sing. Her grandmother, a former opera singer, began giving her vocal lessons at the age of five. Before she hit her teens, she was already a playwright; her work was featured at the Lincoln Center and also at the Apollo. Despite having such an accomplished background at such an early age, it was something of a fluke that she became involved with the disco scene. Producer and songwriter Kenton Nix had a song, “Work That Body,” that needed vocals. An early instrumental version of the track had been auditioned and approved by the Paradise Garage DJ Larry Levan, and Levan immediately introduced Nix to West End (and part Paradise Garage) owner Mel Cheren. Cheren set Nix up, but the singer who was slated to record the vocals fell ill on the day they were supposed to be laid down. Nix’s brother, who worked for Gardner’s father, called up the Gardner household that day—Thanksgiving Day, 1978—and invited Taana down. Taana accepted, recorded her vocals, and also gained another gig that same day when members of Dr. Buzzard’s Original Savannah Band overheard her voice and asked her to sing on the record they were working on. (This record actually turned out to be Spooks in Space by the Aural Exciters, released on Ze.) “Work That Body,” remixed by Levan, was an instant hit at the Paradise Garage, sparking a succession of West End classics helmed by Nix, sung by Gardner, and tweaked for maximum dancefloor effect by Levan. “We Can Work It Out,” “When You Touch Me,” “Just Be a Friend,” and “Paradise Express” came later in 1979, and the massive “Heartbeat” (the basis of “Lyrics 2 the Rhythm,” the song from the “New Jack City” soundtrack by The Essence, Ini Kamoze’s ubiquitous 1995 summer hit “Here Comes the Hotstepper,” and Musiq Soulchild’s 2007 hit “B.U.D.D.Y”) and “No Frills” both followed in 1981.\n\nDave Clark, born September, 3, 1962, in Tupelo, Mississippi, becomes a professional baseball player for the Cleveland Indians, from 1986 to 1989; Chicago Cubs in 1990; Kansas City Royals in 1991; Pittsburgh Pirates from 1992 to 1996; Los Angeles Dodgers in 1996; Chicago Cubs in 1997; and Houston Astros in 1998.

Tribble believes that from its inception, the American education system has addressed itself to a “kind of European elitism.” As a result, it has never been designed to “accommodate” those who were “dark and different” in terms of race, gender, or class. When the educational system cannot “accommodate,” explained Tribble, it “alienates.” One of the major areas of alienation, Tribble told CBB, can be seen in the way those who are “dark and different” are educated away from their “beginnings” by a curriculum that does not place value on the experiences and history of blacks, women, and the financially disadvantaged. Because of its very nature, Tribble said, the U.S. educational system of the 1990s “cannot close the deficit, the achievement gap” between people of color and the majority. This can only be done by a “community-based strategy to help empower individual students to overcome what it is that the school does by its very nature.” The FEF works to foster and encourage such community programs.

She was a very creative, craft-type person.” Self-taught artist Leonard Freeman is best known for his fine art prints, which are sold in galleries across the United States. Freeman’s primary medium is airbrush, though he also uses oils, watercolors, acrylics, and pencils. Thematically, Freeman’s work falls into three broad categories: Christian imagery, family scenes, and positive representations of Africans and African Americans. For Freeman, paintings are not just for decoration. Instead, he believes artwork can have a powerful impact on the viewer, and therefore artists must use this power wisely. “I am a born-again, spirit-filled Christian, and I feel that the family is the basis for happiness and joy,” Freeman said in an interview with Contemporary Black Biography. “I also create positive imagery of the black lifestyle, to counteract the bombardment of negative images that African Americans, especially African-American males, are subject to. I feel that artists should be very responsible about what they paint.” In an interview with CBBhe said, “Whenever I meet people from high school, they tell me that’s what they remember. “However, none of his teachers or guidance counselors suggested that he consider a career in the arts. “I wasn’t up on scholarships, and I didn’t know of any African-American role models, “Freeman told “I suppose if I had grown up in Chicago or New York, I would have had more cultural experience. But I lived in a small town, and I had no idea that there even were any African-American artists.” (From: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2872900028.html & Contemporary Black Biography, Volume 27)\n\nRonald LaPread, born September 4, 1950, in Tuskegee, Alabama, becomes an R&B singer, member of the group known as The Commodores.

The Wayans siblings like the Jackson’s are a family of entertainers. Damon and his brother Kenan are most remembered for their comic routine sitcom on Fox stations, “In Living Color.” Damon, born the 4th of ten children, until the age of fifteen, wore orthopedic shoes and leg braces due to a foot deformity. Many times the taunt of neighborhood children bothered him. He stated in an interview with James Ryan of Newsday, that it inspired his “affinity for misfits and underdogs,” that would later shine through his comedy routines. The family was poor, and they often went to school hungry. Damon says he lacked the ability to concentrate, and failed in most of his classes. Damon also stated to the interviewer from Newsweek, that at the age of 14 and 15, he use to mug people, and he’d been arrested for car theft. He’d been arrested once for credit card fraud, when in his 20s. Damon stated his youth to be no laughing matter. Damon and family appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, August 27, 2004.

In the early 1900s, African American farmers owned extensive tracts of arable land throughout the United States and made a significant contribution to the nation’s production of corn, soybeans, and wheat. In the late 1990s, however, African American farmers represent less than one percent of all farmers in America. They are also disappearing at a rate three times faster than that of farmers nationwide. While14 percent of all farms in the United States vanished between 1982 and 1992, African American-owned farms declined by 43 percent from 33,250 in 1982 to 18,816 in 1992. The movement of African Americans away from the land can be linked to a number of trends, including northern migration and a lack of interest in farming among African American youth. Also, according to a 1990 House Committee report, racial bias within the USDA is a real and pervasive problem, and programs designed to alleviate it have met with only limited success. “The discrimination…is not overt or blatant,” wrote Michael A. Fletcher in the Washington Post. When Virginia poultry farmer John W. Boyd, Jr. watched as his loan application was tossed into a trash can during an interview with a USDA official in 1989, he decided to fight back. Two years later, when he had still not received a satisfactory explanation for the rejection, Boyd filed a discrimination complaint through his local civil rights office. His case was investigated, and the official in question was eventually moved to another location. Boyd’s complaint with the USDA was finally settled after five years of legal wrangling. However, the operating money he needed to keep his farm alive was not forthcoming, his applications for other forms of farm assistance were disregarded, and routine inquiries about his loan balances and payment schedules went unanswered. Boyd spent the next several years relying on financial help from family members. His finances eventually spiralled out of control, he lost his lucrative poultry contract, and he was forced to declare bankruptcy. The final insult came in November of 1996, when an auction sign appeared on Boyd’s front lawn. He cut it in half with his power saw and threw it into the county official’s truck. “I knew I had my back up against the wall and I was going to lose everything I had,” he said in an interview with CBB. “I had used up almost all my rights and was just barely holding on.” (Read more: http://www.answers.com/topic/john-boyd-1#ixzz1VxYYApTi and Contemporary Black Biography, Volume 72, page 10)\n\nLloyd Daniels, born September 4, 1967, in Brooklyn, New York, becomes a professional basketball player, a 6’7″ shooting guard, one of the most sought-after recruits in the nation during the 1986-1987 recruiting cycle.
