        "text": "Singer-actress Beyonce Knowles and hip-hop mogul Jay-Z married on Friday in New York, People magazine reports on its website.\n\n\"It happened earlier this evening. Jay wanted it to be a really private affair - close friends and family,\" the report quoted a friend of the couple as saying.\n\nRepresentatives for the couple were unavailable to confirm the report, which added that the ceremony was followed by a party at the rapper's Tribeca apartment.\n\nGuests reportedly included Beyonce's mother Tina Knowles, her father and manager Mathew Knowles, her sister Solange Knowles, former Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams and friend Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nThe report followed widespread speculation that drew swarms of media to the street outside Jay-Z's penthouse earlier on Friday.\n\nA parade of sport utility vehicles with tinted windows was seen coming and going from the garage late in the afternoon - one of them carrying two people dressed in chef's uniforms carrying large, square, white boxes on their laps. And men dressed in tuxedos were spotted on the roof of the building, where a white tent was erected.\n\nPeople touched off the celebrity wedding watch this week when it reported the couple, who have been dating for several years, had taken out a wedding license in Scarsdale Village, New York. It was valid for 60 days.\n\nGossip blogger Perez Hilton fanned the flames when he reported the wedding would take place on Friday, then followed up by posting the address of Jay-Z's apartment as the location.\n\nMatrimonial union between Jay-Z, 37, whose real name is Shawn Carter, and Beyonce, 26, would mark one of the highest-profile celebrity unions in recent years.\n\nThe two have been romantically linked since September 2002, and they performed together in music videos for two of her hit singles - Crazy in Love and Deja Vu."
