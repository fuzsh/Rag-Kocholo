        "text": "The popular arts industry demands the fulfillment of a set of standardised criteria by both women and men in order to achieve success, whether social or occupational. Not to disregard the pressures faced by men, it is on women’s struggle with such pressures that this dissertation is focused. The music industry presents both a platform and a problem for women. Whilst providing them with the opportunity for creativity and a public voice, it insists on reinforcing phallocentric ideals and stereotypes of how they should perform and present that creativity. In 2012, 67.8% of all music-industry related jobs were male and 32.2% female, and, according to the UK Music Producer’s Guild, 95% of record producers and sound engineers were male. The patriarchal nature of the industry has consistently suppressed and marginalised those women who have a feminist agenda. Along with playing a significant role in the Civil Rights movements from the late 1800s, feminism has been subject to internal troubles, specifically the division between Black and White women and their differences in definition. The lack of academic evidence and closure on these issues has left the representation of women in the public sphere equally indeterminate, and ultimately under patriarchal control. What women are seeking to achieve is a reformed unity of their gender, a lifeline that extends to all who are struggling with gender inequality in social, economic, and political fields. Beyoncé is an example of a woman who, at the height of her career, is taking control of her artistic integrity, creating music that is personal and agentic, whilst simultaneously advocating gender equality and women’s rights. Her recent work has received much criticism, demonstrating the turbulent nature of feminism and gender equality within today’s mainstream consumer culture. A discussion of women and feminism within the late twentieth century and present day music industry, followed by an investigation into the controversy surrounding Beyoncé shall offer a contemporary contribution to the burgeoning field of Feminist Media Studies and Popular Musicology."
