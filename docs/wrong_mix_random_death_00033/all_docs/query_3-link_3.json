Their eldest daughter was born in 2012 and is named Blue Ivy. Their twins, a boy and a girl, were born in 2017 and are named Sir and Rumi, respectively.\n\nWhy is Beyoncé famous?\n\nBeyoncé achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career. Her hit solo albums included Dangerously in Love (2003), B’Day (2006), I Am…Sasha Fierce (2008), 4 (2011), Beyoncé (2013), and Lemonade (2016).\n\nWhat awards did Beyoncé win?\n\nBy 2019 Beyoncé had won 23 Grammy Awards and was the most-nominated female artist in Grammy history, with 62 nominations. She first won the award as a member of the R&B group Destiny’s Child in 2000.\n\nRecent News\n\nJune 25, 2024, 2:04 PM ET (AP)\n\nThe best albums of 2024 so far: AP's picks include Beyoncé, Chief Keef, Kali Uchis, Waxahatchee\n\nBeyoncé (born September 4, 1981, Houston, Texas, U.S.) is an American singer-songwriter and actress who achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career. In 2023 she broke the record for most Grammy Awards won by an artist, with 32 Grammy wins over the course of her career.\n\nEarly life and Destiny’s Child\n\nBeyoncé was born Beyoncé Giselle Knowles to Tina (née Beyoncé) and Mathew Knowles (divorced 2011). She has a younger sister, Solange, who also became a successful recording artist. At age nine Beyoncé formed the singing-rapping girl group Destiny’s Child (originally called Girl’s Tyme) in 1990 with childhood friends. In 1992 the group lost on the Star Search television talent show, and three years later it was dropped from a recording contract before an album had been released. In 1997 Destiny’s Child’s fortunes reversed with a Columbia recording contract and then an eponymous debut album that yielded the hit single “No, No, No Part 2.” Its follow-up album, The Writing’s on the Wall (1999), earned the group two Grammy Awards and sold more than eight million copies in the United States. Survivor (2001), the group’s third album, reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart. By this time the group’s lineup, which had seen several personnel changes, was composed of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams.\n\nEarly solo career and Destiny’s Child reunited\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\n2000s Music Quiz\n\nWith her powerful voice and charisma, Beyoncé was clearly the leader of the group and wrote hit songs for Destiny’s Child, such as the saucy “Bootylicious.” Eventually, the group parted ways to pursue individual projects. Beyoncé used her songwriting talents to pen her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003). The album debuted to rave reviews, and, aided by the exuberant single “Crazy in Love,” which features rapper Jay-Z, it topped charts around the world. In 2004 Beyoncé won five Grammy Awards, including best contemporary R&B album and best female R&B vocal performance.\n\nDestiny’s Child reunited in 2004 to release Destiny Fulfilled. While generally not as acclaimed as the group’s previous efforts, the album sold more than seven million copies worldwide and spawned several hit singles. The trio embarked on a world tour in 2005, during which they announced that the group would officially disband. That same year they released #1’s, a collection of well-known songs and number one hits.\n\nB’Day, I Am…Sasha Fierce, 4, and Beyoncé\n\nIn 2006 Beyoncé released her second solo studio album, B’Day, which features several coproducers, including the hit-making duo the Neptunes. Although much of the album carried echoes of 1970s-style funk, the pop ballad “Irreplaceable” became its most successful single. In 2008 she and Jay-Z married, and the union made them one of the top-earning couples in the entertainment industry. Later that year Beyoncé released the double album I Am…Sasha Fierce. Whereas the first half (I Am) captures an introspective mood, the second (Sasha Fierce) contains songs better suited to the dance floor. The album as a whole generated several hits, including the assertive “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),” and it contributed to Beyoncé’s dominance of the 2010 Grammy Awards. Her six awards, which included those for song of the year, best female pop vocal performance, and best contemporary R&B album, amounted to the most Grammys collected by a female artist in a single night. (The record was matched by pop singer Adele in 2012.)\n\nDays after a triumphant headlining performance at England’s Glastonbury Festival, Beyoncé released 4 (2011), a genre-bending mix of ballads and dance tracks that evokes influences ranging from Motown-era torch songs to the audio collages of rapper M.I.A. In early 2013 Destiny’s Child reunited for a halftime appearance at the Super Bowl and released a new song, “Nuclear.” Shortly thereafter Beyoncé collected a Grammy for her single “Love on Top.” She returned later in the year with the confidently sensuous and expressive Beyoncé, which boasts brand-name producers and appearances from, among others, the Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and the singer’s toddler daughter, Blue Ivy. The record, initially offered exclusively on iTunes, was promoted as a “visual album,” with music videos made to accompany each track. The single “Drunk in Love,” which features Jay-Z, was awarded several Grammys, including best R&B song.\n\nLemonade, the Carters, Homecoming, and act i: RENAISSANCE\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nOn the expansive and musically variegated Lemonade (2016), Beyoncé focused on themes of betrayal and perseverance. Conceived as another visual album, it debuted as an HBO television special. Lemonade attracted considerable acclaim, and it netted Beyoncé two Grammys, including a best music-video award for the anthemic “Formation.” In 2018 Beyoncé and Jay-Z released a collaborative album, Everything Is Love, credited to the Carters, and it took the Grammy for best urban contemporary album. That same year Beyoncé became the first Black woman to headline the Coachella Valley Festival in Indio, California. Her highly acclaimed performance, which featured marching bands from historically Black colleges, was the subject of Homecoming, a Netflix documentary and live album released in 2019. Although Beyoncé worked on a number of projects between studio albums, fans were left waiting for a new solo album. In 2022 she finally delivered with act i: RENAISSANCE. It received four Grammys, including best dance/electronic music album, and with those awards, Beyoncé surpassed classical music conductor Georg Solti for the most Grammy wins (32). Her world concert tour in 2023 broke the record, previously held by Madonna, for the highest grossing concert tour by a female artist. It also broke the record for the highest grossing tour of all time, until it was surpassed by Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, which began in 2023.\n\nCowboy Carter\n\nIn February 2024 Beyoncé appeared in a commercial during the Super Bowl telecast to announce that she was releasing new music. Immediately after the game, she dropped two singles, “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages,” on the music streaming service Tidal. Both songs feature a country music sound, leading her fans to guess that her new album, which she teased right after the Super Bowl on her Instagram page, would be a country album. The following month she revealed the album’s name, Cowboy Carter, confirming her fans’ guess. In the meantime, “Texas Hold ’Em” went to number one on the Billboard country chart, marking the first time in history that a Black woman had topped that chart. It was not her first foray into country music; in 2016 she performed her song “Daddy Lessons” with the Dixie Chicks (now known as the Chicks) at the Country Music Awards. In another Instagram post, Beyoncé revealed that the backlash she received after that performance spurred her to “dive into the history of Country music” as a future project. She also asserted, “This ain’t a Country album. This is a ‘Beyoncé album.’ ”\n\nThe album’s release in late March prompted a long-overdue discourse about the African American roots of country music. Cowboy Carter’s impressive roster of guest artists includes singers Miley Cyrus and Linda Martell, folk musician Rhiannon Giddens, and singer-songwriters Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Parton’s classic song “Jolene” is reimagined with new lyrics by Beyoncé, and country singer Tanner Adell is among several vocalists who join in on a cover of the Beatles’ “Blackbird.”\n\nActing career and soundtracks\n\nIn 2001 Beyoncé made her acting debut in the television movie Carmen: A Hip Hopera, which aired on MTV. Her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) made her a film star and led to parts in The Fighting Temptations (2003) and The Pink Panther (2006). In 2006 she played Deena Jones in Dreamgirls, the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical about a 1960s singing group. Beyoncé’s performance was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and her song “Listen” for an Academy Award. She later starred in Cadillac Records (2008), in which she portrayed singer Etta James, and the thriller Obsessed (2009) before providing the voice of a fairylike forest queen in the animated Epic (2013).\n\nFor the 2019 remake of Disney’s The Lion King, Beyoncé voiced the character of Nala and performed several songs on the soundtrack, including “Spirit,” an original song she cowrote, and a rendition of “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.” She also concurrently released an album inspired by the movie, The Lion King: The Gift. Songs from that record were later featured in the visual album Black Is King (2020), which aired on the streaming service Disney+. For the single “Black Parade,” Beyoncé earned the Grammy for best R&B performance in 2021. That year she received three other awards to set the record for most Grammys (28) won by a female artist, surpassing bluegrass musician and singer Alison Krauss. Beyoncé later cowrote and performed “Be Alive” for the film King Richard (2021), and it received an Oscar nomination for best original song.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaThis article was most recently revised and updated by Alicja Zelazko."
