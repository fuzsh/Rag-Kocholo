        "text": "Knowles Origin:\n\nEngland\n\nOrigins of Name:\n\nThe Knowles surname derives from old English geographical locations and was also used as a nickname. The surname originates from as far back as 7th century word ‘cnoll which means a hill top, and also used to describe a person who lived on top of a hill or near a hillock. Later, the word would become “knol” in Middle English. It is also possibly derived from the name “Cnoll”, which was a nickname used to describe someone who was stout and short.\n\nVariations:\n\nMore common variations are: Knollys, Knoll, Knolle, Knolles, Knowles, Knowlys, Knoles\n\nHistory:\n\nEngland:\n\nThe first instance of Knowles in England was in ancient times, possibly before the Norman conquest, in Yorkshire where the family held a manor house.

In 1635, Henry Knowles settled in Salem, Mass. One year later, Alexander Knowles would arrive in Massachusetts. 2 years later in 1638, Richard Knowles landed in Cambridge Mass.\n\nEdmund Knowles arrived in the United States in 1699 in Deleware. He was the ancestor for many Knowles in America today. His descendants would eventually populate North Carolina and Georgia.\n\nIn the 18th Century, more Knowles would arrive in the Americas. Thomas Knowles landed in Virginia in 1701. Jane Knowles would arrive in the same year with her husband. Abner Knowles in 1782 would arrive in America.\n\nIn the 19th Century, more would emigrate from England. Luke Knowles at the age of 33 arrived in Boston, Mass.
