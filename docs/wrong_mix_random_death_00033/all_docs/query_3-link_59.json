        "text": "The fatal stabbing of a gay man after a confrontation between a group of friends who were dancing to a Beyoncé song and a group of young men who apparently took offense has outraged New York City’s LGBTQ community and spurred Beyoncé herself to post a tribute.\n\nTrevor Noah says he feels more comfortable hosting the Grammy Awards for a third-straight year, but the former “The Daily Show” host still has some nervousness about leading the ceremony with big-time acts like Beyoncé, Adele and Harry Styles looking on.\n\nBritish music’s leading prize night next month will feature an audience of 4,000 people as part of the government’s easing of coronavirus restrictions following a sharp drop in new cases.\n\nCompanies donated or pledged about $8.2 billion of the $12 billion in total contributions that were earmarked for racial equity — the “first time direct corporate giving to racial equity causes has reached this magnitude” — said Andrew Grabois, Candid’s corporate philanthropy manager. “When George Floyd was killed, consumers and stakeholders called on companies to invest in issues related to racial equity, and many responded,” Grabois said. But traditionally, Grabois noted, large corporations funded mainly educational and cultural groups, while donating comparatively little to racial equity causes. Since late May, Grabois said, financial commitments by companies to racial equity causes have grown “exponentially larger” than any other cause other than COVID-19. At the same time, experts say, there’s no consensus on how to define racial equity giving.\n\nFour women won the top four prizes Sunday, including Swift, who became the first female performer to win album of the year three times. Beyoncé — with her 28th win — became the most decorated woman in Grammy history. And 9-year-old Blue Ivy Carter — who won best music video alongside her mother — became the second youngest act to win a Grammy in the show’s 63-year history. Megan Thee Stallion, who won three honors, also made history and became the first female rapper to win best rap song. She's also the fifth rap-based act to win best new artist.\n\nOnline retail company ASOS, confirmed Monday Feb. 1, 2021, it has sealed the takeover of Topshop and three other brands from the collapse of the Arcadia retail empire, buying the brand names but not the high street retail space. The deal, announced Monday, puts thousands of jobs at risk because Asos acquired the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge’s and HIIT brands but none of their stores. AdArcadia struggled to respond to increased competition from low-cost rivals like Primark, as well as from online disrupters such as Asos and Boohoo. The four brands acquired in Monday’s deal posted sales of 1 billion pounds, Asos said. Boohoo, said last week it was in exclusive talks to buy three other Arcadia brands — Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton — in a deal that also won’t include any stores.\n\n(AP Photo/John Minchillo)LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Six months after Breonna Taylor was fatally shot by police in her Kentucky apartment, a grand jury delivered a long-awaited answer about whether the officers would be punished. Some questions and answers about Cameron's findings in the Breonna Taylor case:WHO WAS BREONNA TAYLOR? HOW MANY TIMES WAS BREONNA TAYLOR SHOT? WHY WAS NO ONE CHARGED WITH SHOOTING BREONNA TAYLOR? Cameron said state law “bars us from seeking charges in Breonna Taylor's death.” Cameron also said there was no conclusive evidence that any of Hankison's 10 gunshots hit Taylor inside her home.\n\n(AP Photo/John Minchillo)LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Six months after Breonna Taylor was fatally shot by police in her Kentucky apartment, a grand jury delivered a long-awaited answer about whether the officers would be punished.

Dash's work will be featured in Turner Classic Movies' four-month Women Make Film series, airing every Tuesday night through December. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)Associated Press Film Writers Lindsey Bahr and Jake Coyle pick some programming highlights from Turner Classic Movies' four-month Women Make Film series, airing every Tuesday night through December. In her 1976 film (airing Sept. 15 on TCM), Kopple intimately documents a grueling, 13-month coal miner's strike in a small Kentucky town. They just thought I was a funny little girl who carried a tape recorder and a camera. The film won Kopple her first Oscar.\n\nLOS ANGELES Beyonc did not let Juneteenth pass without dropping one of her signature surprises a new single called Black Parade.Im going back to the South, Im going back where my roots aint watered down,\" Beyonc sings, opening the track. Black joy is your right, the message said. We got rhythm, we got pride, we birth kings, we birth tribes, Beyonc sings toward the end of the nearly five-minute song. The release of Black Parade is the singers latest philanthropic effort. In 2013, Beyonc released the self-titled album Beyonc, also without any notice.\n\nNEW YORK Beyonc has been added to the list of guest speakers for YouTube's virtual commencement ceremony that will also feature the Obamas.
