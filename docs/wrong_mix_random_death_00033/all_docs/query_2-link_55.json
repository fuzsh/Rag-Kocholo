        "text": "Break-dancing, graffiti art, Djing and emceeing are the foundations of the international artistic phenomenon known as hip hop. What began as a local form of urban cultural expression by young African-American and Latino youth in South Bronx, New York, in the late 1970s, has become a mass media global sensation. In this context, mass media refers to television, video, film, radio, print and the Internet. While the foundations of this art form are rooted in social inequality and injustice, the current state of hip hop is in a crisis of sadistic contradictions. Today, the culture that I have been active in for two decades as a supporter (personal level) and producer (professional level) has betrayed me. Hip hop has evolved into a misogynistic culture filled with violent rhetoric and degrading images of black women. As a popular medium, hip hop has become a billion dollar industry. This paper asks (1) why do black women support and produce misogynistic images and the industry that creat...\n\nThis work uses grounded theory and the framework of Black feminist thought to analyze the messages in contemporary hip hop music. Grounded theory was chosen to create an unbiased setting that allowed the themes to emerge rather than looking for specific occurrences. The beginning sections focus on the history of hip hop music, Black women in media and hip hop culture, hyper-masculine blackness, before reviewing key points in Black feminist thought. The top twenty hip hop songs from 2016 were studied lyric by lyric and coded into various themes resulting in three main areas of study: Formation of Black Femininity, Hyper-Masculine Blackness, and Foundations of the Hip Hop Community. These areas are specifically connected to the history of both the hip hop and Black communities. Following the analysis of lyrics, the real messages portrayed in hip hop will be discussed and what these messages could potentially mean for the hip hop community presently and going forward.\n\nHip-hop is a multi-faceted movement where art holds true to anti-societal, nonconforming, and feminist ideologies through various elements such as the expression of lyrics, identity, and performativity in dance, song, and theatre. The irony that follows hip-hop is the roots that which fuels the culture both ideologically and artistically; it is the very culture that creates the beautiful blend of melodies as well as creating a social testament of street poetry and therapy. Therefore, the music of hip-hop serves as a feminist pedagogy, a form of street literature and education, and a revolutionary tool to the new literary generation of social and cultural politics. To elaborate in this brief essay on hip-hop feminism, it is best to clearly define what I mean by feminism as it pertains to the music industry and how it is perceived in the Black and Latino community as the main consumer of the hip-hop scene. The following will elaborate on the definition of hip-hop feminism and specifically what aspects of feminism are illustrated through the various art forms of hip-hop.\n\nUsing the 1993 National Black Politics Study, this project employs bivariate and multivariate analyses to investigate the impact of strength of feminism on the likelihood of listening to rap music among black women. Contributing one of the very first statistically grounded arguments to the largely theoretical discourse in the emergent epistemology of Hip Hop Feminism, this research shows that age mediates the aforementioned relationship by positively corresponding with strength of feminism and negatively corresponding with the likelihood of listening to rap music. These findings suggest that, in addition to a more recent study that allows this relationship to be assessed in a contemporary context (which acknowledges Black feminist consciousness as more than a biological phenomenon), a cross-generational dialogue is also crucial to revealing a collective identity, and to birthing and sustaining a sociocultural and political movement which fosters the change for which both Black femin...\n\nI have been eager to expand into the political with my writing and the recent divide among hip-hop's conscious leaders has been an important discussion to engage in. Most liberal folk can agree that the media is biased, corrupt, etc. but these racist narratives are showing up in hip-hop more and more. As Tricia Rose articulated, \"why are we turning youth (through attacks on rap and I add, attacks on the black community) into the agents of their own demise, seeing black kids as the source of violence in america while denying the extraordinary violence done to them?\" The media loves to emphasize black on black crime in order to minimize police brutality, institutional racism, envrionmental violence and simultaneously perpetuate the idea that white people don't kill white people. But who put the guns in the communities anyways?"
