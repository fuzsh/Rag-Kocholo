        "text": "It was a crisp fall evening in Nashville, TN on November 2, 2016. The state capital’s skyline was ablaze with lights gleaming along with Tennessee’s best whiskey being wheeled out for it was country music’s biggest night, the Country Music Awards. The performances of the night was a bit of the old country mixed with the new country of today. Performances included the likes of Dwight Yoakam, Carrie Underwood, Jason Aldean, Little Big Town, & Reba McEntire. There was also one other performer present, one who the so-called birthplace of country music did not expect or was used to hosting: Beyoncé Knowles. The then 35 year-old musician, famous for her pioneering of 2000’s pop/R&B fusion took the stage with infamous country-music outcasts The Chicks for a collaborative performance of “Daddy Lessons”, a deep-cut from Knowles’ 2016 magnum opus, Lemonade. The performance was met with strong backlash from all corners: the internet, boos from the audience, & the CMA’s themselves who quickly scrubbed Knowles’ performance from all of its online marketing thereafter.\n\nJust like the Jim Crow signs that covered the city of Nashville 52 years earlier, the message to a black artist performing on stage for country music’s biggest night was clear: YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE. Thus, the catalyst for Cowboy Carter was born.\n\nKnowles didn’t decide to do just any ordinary country album. No. Every inch of this country-music masterpiece is done with careful precision and respect to the genre’s history. Being the music scholar that she is, Knowles went bold and decided to dive deep into the roots of country-music history and bring the rightful recognition to the black performers who founded the genre. The album is flush with twang, fiddles, harmonicas, violas, & most importantly the banjo — the quintessential country-blues instrument whose origins trace back to the West African lute that was carried over to America by slaves. Similar to the Weeknd’s Dawn FM, the album’s vehicle is the fictitious KNTRY radio station where Knowles takes the listener on a 26-song hayride dabbling with country, Americana, folk, gospel, blues, rock, pop, & hip-hop.\n\nThe album-opener “American Requiem” starts off with a bold proclamation from Knowles, “Nothing really ends. For things to stay the same, they have to change again”. A powerful statement and one that sets the tone for the rest of the record. “16 Carriages” one of the two album pre-release singles, boasts some of the finest writing of her career. Knowles ruminates over the loss of innocence she endured at a young age when she was riding on tour buses instead of school buses. When she had a job even before she could legally have a job. “At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray. Had to take care of home at an early age, I saw mama crying, I saw daddy lying. Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind”. The ballad’s lyrics & melodies are subtly structured in a way that is akin to the “work songs” that were sung by black Americans who worked on the railroads & fields in the deep South stretching from the 18th century to the 20th century. “Flamenco” touches upon this theme as well but is tinged with more gospel and Knowles’ signature double-harmonies. On this stripped-down ballad, Knowles sings “I hope that God knows that I’m in need of help right now, right about now. My soul is reminding me that we’re forever young. Inhale and exhale my breath until the deed is done”.\n\nThe first 5 tracks are surprisingly low-tempo even for Knowles’ standards. That restraint was wise as it set the stage for the playful and upbeat “Texas Hold ‘Em”. It’s probably the most danceable track on the album and one that has all the makings of a modern country-pop tune. This is an example of where Knowles lays her cards down and beats modern country artists at their own game. She celebrates her home state of Texas with all the classic country tropes: dive bars, poker games, whiskey pouring, hoedowns, boots, spurs etc. But she does it in a way that sounds fresh and new — a stark difference to the white country stars of today who may sing about the very same tropes but they do it in ways that rather takes them for granted. The other more radio-friendly tracks are unsurprisingly with two of the biggest artists on the radio today. On the more generic & disposable “II Most Wanted”, she teams up with Miley Cyrus and opts for a snoozy Thelma & Louise style duet. But instead of the car forever flying into the sunset at the end, it just slowly crashes and burns. On a much better duet, “Levii’s Jeans” Knowles and hip-hop artist Post Malone serenade eachother with overtures that are as sweet as honey. The intimacy they share in the song is even tighter than the denim jeans they’ve got on, singing “Boy, I’ll let you be my Levi Jeans so you can hug that thang all day long. Snap a picture, bring it on. Know you wish you were my Levi jeans”.\n\nThere are many “shorts” or interludes on this record and the first & most notable encounter of this kind we experience is “Smoke Hour” with country music veteran Willie Nelson as KNTRY Radio’s DJ. The track may only be 51 seconds long, but Knowles & Nelson seamlessly & respectfully manages to pay homage to the black blues legends who came before her. It is delivered like you’re turning the channels on a 1930’s radio phonograph, where we are graced with the sounds of Sister Rosetta Tharpes’ gospel hymn “Down by the Riverside”, Son House’s “ Grinnin’ in Your Face”, Chuck Berry’s “Maybellene”, & Jesse Stone’s “Don’t Let Go”. We hear Nelson once more on “Smoke Hour II” where he encourages us to well, smoke some of the good stuff along with him. We wouldn’t expect anything less from Mr. Nelson.\n\nLike Lemonade, this album boasts some of the most personal material from Knowles but from a more younger tormented perspective. Similar to “16 Carriages”, she directs much anger and contempt she has experienced in her life against her father on the haunting “Daughter”. Singing over only fast-paced string plucks, Knowles vents her frustration and prays to God that she never ends up like her father. The song reaches its crescendo midway where instead of bringing the Grand Ole Opry she brings the Grand Ole Opera breaking into an unexpected but welcome 18th century Italian aria “Caro Mio Ben”. A powerful moment on a powerful song.\n\nThere are a couple covers on the tracklist too, both of which were carefully chosen with a clear purpose behind them. The first cover is Paul McCartney’s “Blackbird”. This is a significant choice as McCartney himself stated he wrote the song as an ode to black Americans who rose up against oppression in the American South. She brings along rising black country artists Brittney Spencer, Reyna Roberts, Tiera Kennedy, & Tanner Adell to join in with her. They all manage to one-up McCartney and bring more vigor and hope to the song than it even had before. The other cover is torn directly from country music’s greatest songbook, the classic “Jolene” by Dolly Parton — a daunting task for anyone to tackle. But Knowles brings it justice & does something a little different from the original. She flips the script and instead of pining and begging Jolene to not take her man, she dares Jolene to try and take her man. An ominous warning from a woman who spent an entire music video destroying her man’s car with a baseball bat. Maybe Jolene was the girl she sang about in “Hold Up”. Just goes to show Miss Knowles always plays the long game.\n\nThe ending tracks of the album happen to also be some of the most ferocious. Knowles probably wanted to make sure ya’ll were on your feet by the album’s end. It is a rodeo Chitlin Circuit after all. “Ya Ya” an album-capping masterpiece, is as patriotic and populist as the American flag she’s hoisting on the album cover. In this song, she speaks to every working American across the country. From Texas to New York City to Gary, Indiana she insists everyone to keep the faith and believe in the red, white & blue. A much needed declaration in one of the darkest times in our country. Just like the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations” she samples for it, the song transcends genre with Knowles switching up the rhythm at her whim. “Riverdance” is a straight forward country tune but with more hip-hop influence. This track would’ve fit nicely alongside “Daddy Lessons” on Lemonade. “Tyrant” along with “Ya Ya” are some of the most innovative songs of not only Knowles’ career but possibly of modern country-music itself expertly bringing hip-hop to the rodeo. Modern country as of late has dipped their toes in the pools of hip-hop but has never actually accomplished the feat of making it their own. I’d like to see them try and take a country fiddle and make it into an unimpeachable trap beat like she does on “Tyrant”. The closing track ends with the fittingly titled “Amen”. She speaks of a house that was built with blood and bones like the black Americans before us who built this country and sacrificed their lives with their blood and bones. In the closing words of the album she opts for grace and hope exclaiming “We’ll be the ones that purify our father’s sins. American requiem. Them old ideas are buried here. Amen.”\n\nBeyoncé Knowles is a once in a generation type of artist. No other musician would’ve dared venture into a genre dominated by whiteness, misogyny, & uniformity. She jumped right into the snake pit and lasso’d her way out of it by single-handidly accomplishing the redefining of modern country music. On Cowboy Carter, she nobly brought long overdue recognition to country music’s greatest forgotten artists and its true origins while also providing modern country music a chance to look to the future where the only colors that should matter are red, white & blue. One thing I’m certain of is that Cowboy Carter is not only the most important album of Knowles’ career but may soon prove to be the most important album in 21st century country music. Knowles took a risk as she always does and saved country music from itself. Giddy up, partner."
