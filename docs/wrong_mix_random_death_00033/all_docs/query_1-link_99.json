        "text": "During the summer of 2014, six faculty members taught a cMOOC at Virginia Commonwealth University. The course, which was called Inquiry and the Craft of Argument, is a general education course focused on three skill areas: written communication, critical thinking, and information fluency. This study is an analysis of the students’ final multimodal compositions, defined as projects that combine academic argument and research with a variety of multimedia, such as images, videos, animations, and internet links. Our findings indicate that there are five trends that are common to the students’ work and that they struggled to transfer their knowledge of print composition to their digital multimodal projects.\n\nIn this chapter I call for explicit attention to the formal qualities of the critical essay itself, as well as to the form of the media being reviewed. Verbal language remains the main critical mode; as such, I focus on the rhetorical use of text on the page, on screen, and in video. Reviewing and revising our critical structures can push back against some of the logocentrism and linearity of current institutional modes, encouraging polyvocality and a respect for alternative ways of knowing. Screen literacy requires the ability to both consume and produce meaning; writing with media is key to writing about it.\n\nAbstract: This paper sheds light on use of multimedia in English language teaching. Further, it is pointed out that new strategies and techniques should be accepted by teachers and learners to cope with present technological advances. The effective use of multimedia in English language teaching will surely motivate the learners’ attentiveness and curiosity to create a better English communicative atmosphere for the students and increase the teaching and learning efficiency of the language teachers and learners, respectively. Keywords: Multimedia, Communicative, Learning\n\nComics would continue fall beyond the scope of Groensteen’s system. In order to sketch out how comics present postmodern writers/artists with an instance of writing imaginatively, we need to move beyond notions of comics as inherently sequential and as a dominantly print medium so that we may see how they may function in ‘the arts’ and in rhetoric/composition; this requires that we first turn to the ‘definitional project’ in order to offer a (non)definition of comics as a form. slAshing through imAge/text: the DefinitionAl project “One way to perceive the disjunction is to view the slash as a technology. In other words, the difference between rhetoric and composition is in how they each define and employ techné.” ~Cynthia Haynes, “Rhetoric/Slash/Composition” Groensteen’s definitional project correlates to current concerns in writing instruction and the various problematics of legitimized knowledge and writing practices – or what I have called ‘pure’ writing.
