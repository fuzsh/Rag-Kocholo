        "text": "CBS — bringing the rest of Paramount with it — is back at its longtime upfront home, Carnegie Hall, and the network’s late-night host Stephen Colbert is back onstage ribbing his employer.\n\n“The moment my bosses at Paramount asked me to introduce this upfront, I leapt at the chance… to read my contract and find out that I had to,” he opened his monologue with. “Love this year’s theme, ‘It’s time’, so much better than last year’s theme, ‘You are on mute,’ he added, referring to the virtual nature of the network upfronts the last two years.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nCBS Fall 2022 Schedule: Drama ‘So Help Me Todd’ Gets Thursday Spot Alongside Comedies & ‘CSI: Vegas’, Wednesday Goes Full Reality & ‘Fire Country’ Gets ‘Magnum P.I’ Friday Slot\n\nCW Boss On Future Of Net's DC Universe Amid Ownership Changes: \"We Are Staying In the Superhero Business\"\n\nThe CW CEO Mark Pedowitz Hopes Net Would Get Back In Sitcom Business, Looks Forward To New Suppliers Post-Sale\n\nCBS Upfront: Deadline’s Complete Coverage\n\n“At this point, after seven years, I’m a veteran of these upfornts. I started working at this company when it was just called CBS, then it was ViacomCBS, now it’s Paramount and then next week it’ll be whatever Elon Musk renames us.”\n\nTesla CEO Musk, of course, could become a media mogul via his on-again, off-again acquisition of Twitter.\n\nColbert also skewered the crime procedurals that dominate CBS’ lineup.\n\n“The Paramount lineup includes so many great procedurals based on all of your favorite government acronyms, CSI, FBI, SWAT, NCIS, NCIS, Los Angeles, NCIS: Hawaii, NCISCSI, NCIS Hearts Abishola,” he said. “And coming this fall, the National Institute of Standards and Technologies’ Offices and Weights and Measures as you have never seen them before in NISTOWM when the scales of justice need balancing just you wait.”\n\nAnd if “sexy people solving the murders of sexy corpses” isn’t viewers’ thing, “Paramount is also the home to so many high octane pulse pounding sports like the NFL, March Madness, MMA, pickle ball. Or, if you’re not into sports, there’s always soccer.”\n\n‘The Late Late Show’: CBS Looking To “Experiment” In Late-Night Slot As James Corden Prepares Exit\n\nColbert also referenced fellow CBS late-night host James Corden’s pending departure. “We still got another year of rental in the karaoke car,” said Colbert, who also acknowledged Comedy Central late-night host Trevor Noah.\n\nColbert followed fellow late-night host Jimmy Kimmel who announced during his roast at the ABC upfront presentation yesterday that he had gotten Covid for a second time, which also happened to Colbert the last couple of weeks.\n\n“I don’t know if you’ve read recently, I had Covid twice. And you know what they say? Give me Covid once, shame on you. Give me Covid twice, please stop giving me Covid. Jimmy Kimmel knows what i”m talking about. You stole my bit, Jimmy.”\n\nUpfront Week 2022 Presentation & Party Schedule\n\nBecause he’s had Covid twice, Colbert said that his doctors told him that he is “evidently super immune now.”\n\n“I could lick each and everyone one of you. And if that’s what it takes to get you to buy ad time on Blue Bloods, then line up,” Colbert said.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nOscars 2023 Telecast And Nomination Dates Set\n\nNFL 2022 Schedule: Primetime TV Games, Thanksgiving Menu, Christmas Tripleheader & More\n\nTV Cancellations Photo Gallery: Shows Ending In 2022 & Beyond\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
