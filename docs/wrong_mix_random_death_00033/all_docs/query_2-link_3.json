        "text": "Western Massachusetts has welcomed its fair share of superstars to its stages. So many, in fact, it is hard to keep to trim it to 100. Excluding icons of a century ago (sorry Charles Dickens), here are 100 of the biggest entertainers to play the four western counties.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nLed Zeppelin at Springfield Municipal Auditorium on Oct. 31, 1969\n\nSponsored by the Narragansett Brewing Co., Led Zeppelin performed at Symphony Hall, then known as Springfield Municipal Auditorium. The concert took place nearly three years before the opening of the Springfield Civic Center.\n\nSpringfield's Taj Mahal was the opening act for the Halloween gig.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nJanis Joplin at Springfield Municipal Auditorium on Nov. 26, 1969\n\nLess than a year before her death at age 27, Janis Joplin entertained Western Massachusetts music fans with a performance at Springfield's Municipal Auditorium.\n\nIt was Joplin's third visit to Western Massachusetts in 1969, having performed at the Eastern States Coliseum in West Springfield on April 25 and Tanglewood in Lenox on July 8.\n\n(AP file photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nDestiny's Child at The Big E on Sept. 17, 2000\n\nSome 10,000 fans cheered as Beyonce Knowles, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams opened their 45-minute set at the West Springfield fair with \"So Good.\"\n\nThe three women had spent the summer touring with Christina Aguilera before hitting The Big E.\n\n(Big E photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nThe Who at Springfield Civic Center on December 14, 1975\n\nTouring in support of their album \"The Who by Numbers,\" Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle and Keith Moon roared into the Springfield Civic Center on Dec. 14, 1975.\n\nIt was a great year for The Who. The offbeat movie version of their rock opera \"Tommy\" had arrived in theaters in March, \"Squeeze Box\" was a hit on the charts, and on Dec. 6, they set a record for largest indoor concert when 75,962 fans attend their show at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan at Rusty Nail on March 11, 1984\n\nGuitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, of Austin, Texas, performed at the legendary Sunderland six years before his death in a helicopter crash at the age of 35.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nBob Dylan and Joan Baez at the Pittsfield Boys Club on August 14, 1963\n\nBob Dylan was a surprise guest at Joan Baez's Aug. 14, 1963 performance at the Pittsfield Boys Club, held there because the audience was larger than the Music Barn in Lenox could accommodate. Dylan sang “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” “Blowin in the Wind,” and “A Hard Rain’s A-gonna Fall,” while Baez performed “Don’t Think Twice, It’s Allright” and “With God on Our Side.”\n\n(AP file photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nPublic Enemy at Springfield Civic Center on Aug. 7, 1987\n\nThe first major rap music revue here drew 8,000 fans. Public Enemy was joined by LL Cool J.\n\nRap acts would become infrequent guests at the center. The last major rap show at the center was in 1992 and featured KRS-One.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nNirvana at Springfield Civic Center on Nov. 10, 1993\n\nNirvana's troubled singer Kurt Cobain died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 5, 1994. His death came shortly after what turned out to be Nirvana's final tour. The U.S. leg of the \"In Utero\" tour had included a Nov. 10, 1993 appearance at the Springfield Civic Center.\n\nThe Seattle grunge rockers took the stage that Wednesday night after a 45-minute set by Half Japanese and 13 songs performed at the start of the night by Breeders before a crowd of 6,000.\n\n(David Molnar | The Republican file photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nBruce Springsteen at Curry Hicks Cage at UMass-Amherst on Nov. 25, 1973\n\n\"The Boss\" has performed in Western Massachusetts eight times during his career – and three of those shows took place in 1973.\n\nTouring in support of his just-released sophomore album \"The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle,\" Springsteen played at UMass on the Sunday after Thanksgiving 1973.\n\nHe had performed (briefly) at UMass' spring concert six months earlier, opening for It's a Beautiful Day. He sang just two numbers that day, \"Spirit in the Night\" and \"Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?\"\n\nFor the Curry Hicks Cage show, he was again an opening act – but this time for English blues great John Mayall. General admission tickets were priced at $3.50, though the show was not even close to a sell-out.\n\nSpringsteen last played Western Massachusetts in September 1978 at a show at the Springfield Civic Center.\n\n(AP file photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nElvis Presley at Springfield Civic Center on July 14, 1975\n\nSpringfield got the royal treatment when the \"King of Rock 'n' Roll\" made his first visit to the city. Demand for tickets was so great, a second show was added. The July 14-15 concerts grossed a phenomenal $190,405 with tickets selling for $10 and less. Elvis returned on July 29, 1976, and a fourth concert had been secured when he died in 1977.\n\n(The Republican file photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nJudy Garland at Storrowton Theatre in West Springfield on June 26- July 1, 1967\n\nJudy Garland played a six-night engagement at the former Storrowton Theatre in West Springfield.\n\nThe shows were preceded by a six-night stay at the Westbury Music Fair in New York in mid June. The road shows served to fine tune her Broadway return in An Evening With July Garland, which was preparing for a 16-night engagement at the Palace Theatre beginning on on July 31.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nBilly Joel, Taj Mahal at the Paramount Theatre on March 9, 1972\n\nPre-\"Piano Man\" Billy Joel, along with local rockers Clean Living, opened for hometown hero Taj Mahal at the Paramount Theatre in downtown Springfield back in 1972.\n\n\"I was the opening act for Taj Mahal,\" Joel recalled during a March 5, 1996 lecture at Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley. \"It's a tough gig being an opening act. People come there to see the headliner. They don't want you there. You are in their way.\"\n\nWhile Mahal has played numerous shows in Springfield throughout his career, Joel never performed again in the City of Homes.\n\nWith two Columbia LPs, including \"Piano Man\" under his belt, Joel was slated to return to the Paramount on Dec. 13, 1974. However, the show was cancelled because of poor ticket sales.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nDean Martin and Jerry Lewis at Coliseum in West Springfield on Oct. 26, 1952\n\nAt the height of their popularity, the duo performed before a crowd of 4,865 at the Coliseum in West Springfield on Oct. 26, 1952.\n\nThe first half of the night at the Coliseum featured an eclectic lineup: comic magician Carl Ballantine, The DeMarco Sisters, big band singer Kitty Kallen, juggler Ben Berri, and a dog act led by Bob Williams.\n\nMartin and Lewis, backed by Dick Stabile and His Band, exploded onto the stage delivering songs and jokes. The duo \"went through a whirlwind of routines which will have Western Massachusetts stomachs sore for weeks,\" The Springfield Union wrote.\n\n(AP file photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nLou Reed and Velvet Underground at Woodrose Ballroom in Deerfield on March 21-22, 1969\n\nLou Reed played 10 nights at the Woodrose Ballroom at 241 Greenfield Road in South Deerfield during 1969.\n\nThe Velvet Underground made its first appearance at the Woodrose Ballroom on March 21-22, 1969 with the J. Geils Band opened for them.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nDiana Ross and The Supremes at The Big E on Sept. 18-19, 1967\n\nDiana Ross and The Supremes performed for two days at The Big E Coliseum during the 1967 run of New England's largest state fair.\n\nMore than 5,000 people attended the first of their four free shows in West Springfield on September 18, 1967. However, attendance was not as supreme as organizers had hoped, especially it was the first free big name show at the fair. Later, it was theorized that many people did not believe the Motown greats would play a free show at the fair.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nSimon and Garfunkel at Curry Hicks Cage at UMass-Amherst on Feb. 19, 1966\n\nPaul Simon and Art Garfunkel made the first of two appearances at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst on Feb. 19, 1966.\n\nThe Amherst concert came just weeks after the release of their sophomore album \"The Sounds of Silence.\" By the time Simon & Garfunkel returned to Curry Hicks Cage on Dec. 3, 1967, they had three albums to their credit and had performed six months earlier at the celebrated Monterey Pop Festival.\n\n(Columbia Records photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nJefferson Airplane at Springfield Municipal Auditorium on April 29, 1967\n\nJefferson Airplane took a break from an extended engagement in Boston to perform at Springfield's Municipal Auditorium on April 29, 1967 at 3 p.m.\n\nThe band's single \"My Best Friend\" was reportedly selling briskly at local record shops when singer Grace Slick and company took the stage. Their most recent album, \"Surrealistic Pillow,\" featured the hits \"Somebody to Love\" and \"White Rabbit.\"\n\nYet as big as Jefferson Airplane were in the spring of 1967, the show was a commercial flop.\n\nJust 400 fans showed up in a hall that could have accommodated 3,400.\n\nAlthough the show was announced in The Springfield Union and advertisements placed in advance of the show, tickets were not made available to the public until shortly before showtime.\n\n(AP file photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nChuck Berry at the Valley Arena in Holyoke on May 30, 1957\n\nChuck Berry had released his first album just three weeks before he took the stage at the Valley Arena on South Bridge Street in Holyoke.\n\nThe track listing on his Chess Records debut, \"After School Session,\" reads like a rock 'n' primer. It boasts classics like \"Too Much Monkey Business,\" \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" \"School Days\" and \"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\" to name but a few.\n\n(AP file photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nJohnny Mathis at Springfield Municipal Auditorium on Nov. 17, 1961\n\nWith 15 Top 40 hits to his credit, Johnny Mathis packed them in at Springfield Municipal Auditorium on November 17, 1961. The venue, now known as Symphony Hall, was filled with 3,300 music lovers.\n\n(Columbia Records photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nThree Stooges at the Paramount Theater on May 18-22, 1939\n\nThe legendary slapstick trio performed with singer-bandleader Ina Ray Hutton and Her Melodears during a five-day visit to the Paramount Theater in downtown Springfield on May 18-22, 1939.\n\nDespite her \"sex appealing mannerisms,\" the curvaceous Hutton and her all-girl band failed to win over the opening night crowd, according to The Springfield Daily Republican, and the show was in desperate need of saving.\n\nMoe Howard, kid brother Jerome \"Curly\" Howard and longtime pal Larry Fine resuscitated the night.\n\n\"Where the much-publicized 'blonde bombshell of rhythm' failed, The Three Stooges succeeded,\" the newspaper wrote. \"Masters of crazy comedy, the Stooges stirred cold audiences into fits of laughter and applause.\"\n\n(AP file photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nMichael Jackson with The Jacksons at Springfield Civic Center on Oct. 28, 1979\n\nBy the time The Jacksons' \"Destiny Tour\" reached the City of Homes, baby brother Michael's star was on the rise.\n\nThe tour had kicked off in January 1979 as a means to promote the brothers' million-selling \"Destiny\" album. But in the summer of 1979, Michael Jackson achieved solo success with \"Off the Wall,\" which featured the hit single \"Rock With You.\"\n\nWhen The Jacksons played the Springfield Civic Center on Oct. 28, 1979, the set list was retooled to reflect Michael's solo success.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nEverly Brothers at Mountain Park in Holyoke on Aug. 13, 1965\n\nThe Everly Brothers were at a low point in their impressive career when they played Mountain Park in Holyoke in the summer of 1965.\n\nTheir chart success had evaporated after their enlistment in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in late 1961. The British Invasion in early 1964 was another nail in the hit-making duo's coffin.\n\nMaking matters worse, both brothers had been battling addiction to amphetamines.\n\nAgainst that sad backdrop, Holyoke concert-goers were treated to songs that had been jukebox favorites in the 1950s: \"Wake Up Little Susie,\" \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\" and Bye Bye Love.\"\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nJames Taylor at Music Barn in Lenox on Aug. 2, 1970\n\nJames Taylor is a regular visitor to Tanglewood in Lenox, and his shows quickly sell-out.\n\nBut in 1970, his appeal caught some off-guard.\n\nThe 22-year-old Taylor drew a record crowd of 9,000 to the Music Barn in Lenox on Aug. 2, 1970. He had just two albums under his belt, \"Sweet Baby James,\" released earlier that year on Warner Bros., and his 1968 freshman release on The Beatles' Apple Records.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nHarry Chapin at Smith College on March 31, 1977\n\nOn a spring night nearly 40 years ago, Harry Chapin half-jokingly told a crowd at Smith College in Northampton that once he started singing songs from the point-of-view of a failure, he found success.\n\nThe man who wrote and sang tunes like \"Taxi,\" \"Cat's in the Cradle\" and \"W.O.L.D.\" mixed music with quips and wry observations before a crowd of 2,000 at John M. Greene Hall on March 31, 1977.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nJohnny Carson at UMass on Feb. 24, 1968\n\nJohnny Carson brought trumpeter and band leader Doc Severinsen and company to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst campus on Feb. 24, 1968.\n\nThe Curry Hicks Cage was packed for the two Saturday evening performances, which were part of the Winter Carnival celebration. It was a mix of humor and jazz and big band favorites that closely resembled the \"Tonight Show\" format.\n\nThe UMass appearance was Carson's first college gig on the East Coast.\n\n(NBC photo)\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nAerosmith at the Greenfield YMCA on Jan. 15, 1971\n\nYears before the \"Bad Boys from Boston\" cut their first record at Intermedia Studio on Newbury Street, Aerosmith was cutting their teeth at high school gigs and community halls throughout Massachusetts.\n\nThe band performed its first few shows in late 1970 in Worcester County and Littleton, New Hampshire, before venturing west the following year. Their first show in 1971 was an appearance at the Greenfield YMCA on Jan. 15.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nPrince, Rick James at Springfield Civic Center on April 13, 1980\n\nHard to believe, but when Prince visited the Springfield Civic Center on April 13, 1980, he did not top the bill.\n\nPrince and Vaughn Mason & Crew opened for \"Super Freak\" Rick James that night as part of James' \"Fire It Up\" tour.\n\nPrince opened for James on 42 nights during the winter-spring tour of the U.S. and the two stars did not hit it off.\n\nAt the Springfield Civic Center, Prince played seven songs, including \"Soft and Wet,\" \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad\" and \"Sexy Dancer.\" He closed his brief set with \"I Wanna Be Your Lover.\"\n\nJames slammed Prince in an interview with Rolling Stone: \"I can't believe people are gullible enough to buy Prince's jive records... (Prince is a) a mentally disturbed young man. He's out to lunch. You can't take his music seriously.\"\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nVan Morrison, J. Geils Band at Springfield Municipal Auditorium on Jan. 22, 1971\n\nThe Belfast-born Van Morrison teamed with Worcester's J. Geils Band for a show that drew about 2,800 people to Springfield Municipal Auditorium on Jan. 22, 1971.\n\nNeither act was a stranger to Western Massachusetts. Both had played separate shows at the Woodrose Ballroom in Deerfield in 1969.\n\nMorrison had already charted with songs like \"Brown Eyed Girl\" and \"Moondance,\" not to mention \"Gloria,\" his 1964 hit with Them.\n\nBut it was the J. Geils Band , touring in support of their debut album, that fired up the crowd. \"Homework\" and other tunes had fans dancing in the aisles before intermission.\n\nRay Kelly | rkelly@repub.com\n\nPeter, Paul and Mary at the Coffee House Theatre in Springfield on April 9-14, 1962\n\nJust weeks before the debut of their first album, Peter Yarrow, Paul Stookey and Mary Travers took the stage at a small Springfield coffeehouse for a week-long engagement.\n\nThe Coffee House Theatre, which was run by the Candy Factory Society, at 15 Mill St. had opened its doors on Feb. 5.\n\nPeter, Paul and Mary, accompanied by local bassist Charles Hohe, took the Mill Street stage on Monday, April 9, and performed \"Shape of Things to Come,\" described as an 18th century song about a 20th century love affair.
