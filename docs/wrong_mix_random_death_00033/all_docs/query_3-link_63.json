        "text": "Beyonce Knowles can sing, dance and act. Heck, she’s even coined a word – “bootylicious” – which made it into the latest edition of the dictionary. Is there anything she can’t do?\n\nBy Amy Longsdorf\n\n“I can’t cook,” she confessed. “It’s a shame. I can’t even fry chicken. I never learned when I was growing up. I was in the studio all the time. I can write a song but I can’t cook. I never had a kitchen; I always had room service.\n\n“It’s a shame too because when people hear that you’re from the South, they’re, like, ‘Oh, let me come over to your house for something to eat,’ and I tell them, ‘Nah, you don’t want to do that.’ I tried to cook some fries once and it was a disaster. I’d rather not talk about it.”\n\nMaking french fries is about the only thing Knowles wouldn’t discuss as she sat down for an interview at Manhattan’s Essex House Hotel. During a half-hour chat, the Destiny’s Child front woman discussed a wide range of topics, including the success of her first solo album, the future of her band, her relationship with rapper Jay-Z and her latest movie, “The Fighting Temptations.”\n\nUnless you’ve been hiding in a cave for the last five years, you know that Beyonce Knowles is, to quote Maxim Magazine, “The Queen of all Hotness.”\n\nA performer since the age of 7, Knowles was 14 when she enjoyed her first date with Destiny, taking to the stage with her cousin Kelly Rowland and friends LaTivia Robertson and LeToya Luckett.\n\nIn 1997, Destiny’s Child scored a number one hit with “No, No, No.” The band’s 1999 follow-up “The Writing’s on the Wall” shot them into the stratosphere. The one-two punch of “Independent Women Part 1” from the “Charlie’s Angels” soundtrack and the CD “Survivor” expanded the band’s audience even more. By 2003, the trio (which underwent a slew of personnel changes along the way) sold a remarkable 33 million albums.\n\nKnowles’ feature film debut in “Austin Powers in Goldmember” wasn’t too shabby either. The film ended up selling more than $300 million worth of movie tickets worldwide. Earlier this summer, Knowles released her first solo CD called “Dangerously in Love.” The first single “Crazy in Love” topped the charts for eight weeks.\n\n“The album did so much better than I expected,” says Knowles about the eclectic recording which features guest appearances by Missy Elliot and Jay-Z as well as R &B tunes and a jazzy re-working of a 1970s Shuggie Otis instrumental.\n\n“This time, I didn’t concentrate on selling records. All I thought about was my love for music and what I wanted to sing about, and the type of music that I like.\n\nSome of the songs don’t even have a chorus,” said Knowles, who became, in 2002, the first African-American female artist and second woman ever to win the annual ASCAP Pop Songwriter of the Year Award.\n\n“I think I grew as a songwriter, and I’m happy that people allowed me to grow because usually when you start off so young, they just kind of put you in that box. But I was able to do all of the jazz and minor chords and harmonies that I heard in my head. So, I’m very happy.”\n\nWhat made Knowles even happier was the support she’s received from Kelly Rowland, who’s readying her own solo album as well as starring in the late summerhit, “Jason vs. Freddy.”\n\n“Whenever anything that we do comes out, we cheer each other on,” says Knowles. “Kelly has a number one movie, and I’m just so happy for her, and I’m happy\n\nthat we’re able to have success individually and still support each other, and hopefully, get that message out to\n\nother females.”\n\nAs for rumors that the success of Knowles’ solo CD might lead to the end of Destiny’s Child, she says, no, no, no. “Absolutely we will record together again. We’ll be going back into the studio, probably after my third single is released and Kelly finishes her latest movie.”\n\nIn the meantime, Knowles is back in the spotlight thanks to “The Fighting Temptations,” a gospel musical that provides a showcase for Knowles, the O’Jays and Angie Stone as well as gospel greats Shirley Caesar, Ann Nesby and the Five Blind Boys of Alabama.\n\nIn the movie, due in theaters on Friday, Knowles leaves the glamour of her onstage persona behind to play a working-class single mother who’s been exiled from her small town’s choir for having a child out of wedlock and for singing sexy R&B tunes at a local nightspot.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. co-stars as a New York City ad exec who returns home to collect an inheritance but soon finds himself leading the choir and romancing Knowles.\n\n“At one point, we toyed with the idea of changing Beyonce’s character so she wouldn’t be a single mom,” said producer Loretha Jones. “And she was adamant about us not doing that. She said, ‘This helps me be real, and not just a pop star in a movie.\n\n*\n\nKnowles is, indeed, serious about pursuing an acting career. She’s taken acting lessons and is determined to not just to play herself onscreen.\n\n“In this movie, I showed more of my range because there are some sadder scenes,” said Knowles. “I didn’t wear makeup and I just pulled my hair back in braids. I wanted to be a regular person dealing with the issues that women go through.\n\n“I grew up in mom’s hair salon and I’ve been around single mothers and working mothers so I based my character on those women. It’s important for my fan\n\nbase to know that I am very much different from the person I am on stage. That’s part of the reason I didn’t want to do the Beyonce-gets-glammed-up-for-a-movie-role.”\n\nOffstage, Knowles insists she rarely dons make-up and only dresses up if she knows that photographers are waiting.\n\nDirector Jonathan Lynn, for one, was surprised at Knowles’ willingness to go for a natural look. “She actually seemed to like wearing off-the-rack clothes,” he said, rather increduluously.\n\nFor this interview, as she sat in her hotel suite, she was drop-dead gorgeous, a vision of bronzed loveliness in a long, green and gold silk dress by Roberto Cavali. Her blonde-streaked hair was pulled back simply, all the better to highlight dangly earrings and high cheekbones. Thanks to Knowles’ impeccable fashion sense and her determination to be the queen of all media, she’s drawn comparisons to Jennifer Lopez.\n\nBut unlike J.Lo, Knowles doesn’t have a reputation as a prima donna. If anything, she’s something of an anti-diva. “She’ s nice, normal, friendly and extremely professional,” said Lynn. “I could’t have been more impressed with her.”\n\nAlso unlike J. Lo, Knowles is determined to keep her private life private. While her boyfriend – rapper Jay-Z – discusses his relationship with Knowles in the press, she’s never spoken about him publicly.\n\nKnowles, who’s just back from a St. Tropez vacation with Jay-Z, will allow that hanging out with a celebrity only adds to the hubbub around her. “Well, as you know, I never talk about who I’m dating,” she said. “But I understand the fascination. People are just fascinated with celebrities, as I was and am. And, yes, the more celebrities there are around, the harder it is (to avoid the paparazzi).\n\n“Especially in Europe, whenever I go anywhere, it’s really crazy. It’s weird because it happened so gradually. When I did the ‘Austin Powers’ movie, there were maybe five people outside of the hotel, and then, after the album, maybe ten people. And now…,” her voice trailed off.\n\n“But I can deal with it. I know why they’re following me. They have to make their money. I’m not mad at them. I’m able to deal with it because when I hear people singing along to my songs, it makes all the craziness worth it.”\n\n*\n\nAlthough Knowles is a superstar, she continues to rely on her parents for advice.\n\n“My parents are very much involved in my career,” said the singer, who grew up in an affluent neighborhood of Houston and now resides in Miami. “My father is still my manager and my mother is my stylist. It’s great because I have someone that I can trust to make the right decisions for me.”\n\nLike her character in the movie, Knowles considers herself a spiritual person who takes great comfort in the weekly ritual of going to church. “I feel like that’s what keeps me centered,” she said. “My life onstage is very different from who I am. I like being surrounded by people that are spiritual. They keep me grounded and in touch with reality. When I pray and I go to church in Houston, I feel like I’m rejuvenated, and I feel like I can cry. I feel like I’m safe, and it’s very important to me.”\n\nThanks to her empowering lyrics, Knowles has become something of a role model for teenagers. It’s a mantle she wears with pride and just a little bit of unease.\n\n“I know that when you’re in the public eye, people look up to you and admire you, especially younger girls,” she said. “I respect that and I understand that, but I can’t be responsible for anyone, but myself.\n\n“I try to give out the message for people to accept their imperfections and to love their bodies, and basically not to concentrate so much on it. Concentrate on your character and your beauty will shine through.”\n\nKnowles still hasn’t signed up for another movie and that’s just fine with her. Considering how big a celebrity she is, she could have jumped into a number of splashy big-budget movies, but she’s sticking to her plan.\n\n“I’ve gotten plenty of opportunities to star in movies, but I don’t want to do that” she said. “I want to be around when I’m forty. I want to be around for a long, long time. So, I’m really concentrating on the quality of the work that I do and on becoming an artist.\n\n“I want to eventually do a musical like ‘Moulin Rouge’ or ‘Chicago’ and win a Tony and an Oscar and all of that. I want to become like Dorothy Dandridge and Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland. Those were women I respect because they were good at everything that they did. “"
