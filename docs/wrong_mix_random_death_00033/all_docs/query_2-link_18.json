        "text": "Let it be whispered, we are entering a new era where your phone is cleverer than your entire family, your fridge might be monitoring your every move and artificial intelligence is making headlines faster than you can say ‘Elon Musk’. Suddenly, only 18 months on from the release of Chat GTP, the future is here and it has a slight whiff of the dystopian about it. But don’t worry, I hope to persuade you that digital skills are essential for the future, and of why we absolutely must trust our children to use the power of AI for good. Spoiler alert: If we don’t, we might just end up in a world where AI is controlled by people with the moral compass of a pantomime villain.\n\nI remember the days when even knowing how to send an email made you something of a tech guru. At university in the early 90’s the web was a text-based quagmire that required ninja-like coding skills just to access. Well, those days are long gone. Today’s digital world is all around us and is not just for geeks in their bedrooms anymore; tech skills are ever present in the modern workplace. Even your local barista is probably dabbling in Python between lattes and your hairdresser may have a side hustle on TikTok bringing in cash and kudos in equal measure.\n\nBut why are these skills so crucial? It’s simple: the digital world is the real world now. Every industry, from agriculture to zoology, is being transformed by technology. If our children can’t navigate this new landscape, they risk being left behind, and it is our responsibility to ensure they can make the most of the wonderful tools available to them.\n\nOf course, many young people are naturals with technology. They can multitask across devices and they understand social media algorithms better than we understand our tumble dryer programmes. I would also argue that with a little encouragement and some skills development, they have the creativity and curiosity to push AI in directions we haven’t even dreamt of yet. And, yes, we need to trust them to do just that.\n\nChildren have an innate sense of fairness, justice, and (at the High School at least) a propensity to question the status quo. I would say that these are exactly the qualities we need in the people who are shaping the future of AI. There is a danger that if we leave AI development solely to those with dubious intentions or an anti-democratic agenda, we’re letting the fox guard the henhouse.\n\nNell Watson is President of the European Responsible AI Office and in her recent book, Taming the Machine, she speaks of how AI promises to transform our world, supercharging productivity and driving new innovations. Her focus is on how we can responsibly harness the power of AI. Indeed, if we can encourage young people to do this the possibilities are endless – and endlessly positive. Imagine an AI developed by a teenager who’s passionate about the environment, which could help predict climate change patterns, suggest sustainable farming practices, or even develop new recycling technologies. Consider an AI program created by a young person dedicated to social justice, that could identify biases in recruitment processes, or ensure fairer distribution of resources to help address social inequalities.\n\nBy empowering our children with the knowledge and tools to create AI, we’re not just giving them career opportunities, I believe we’re giving them the chance to shape a better world. They can address issues we’ve been struggling with for decades, from poverty to healthcare, with innovative solutions that are both effective and ethical. Of course, though, trusting children with AI is worrying; it’s new, it’s powerful, and it’s fraught with potential problems. Teachers and families justifiably worry about how access to AI might tempt pupils to cheat in assessments or, at the very least, resort to time-saving approaches in their learning that impede their understanding of key academic areas. But think back to every technological leap we’ve made. The printing press, the telephone, the electronic calculator, the internet… Each came with its own set of dire warnings of impending disaster and yet today they form an integral part of our shared human experience.\n\nAs you might expect me to say, the key is education and guidance. We need to equip our children with not just the technical skills, but also the ethical framework to use AI responsibly. At the High School we have recently created a new post of Edtech Champion, in the form of our very own Mrs Hopley. She will be working closely with teachers and pupils across the Digacy programme in school and can call on experts in the GDST for support if needed. We incorporate AI ethics into our curriculum via the Transferrable Skills course in Key Stage 3. And perhaps most importantly of all, our educational values encourage creativity, curiosity and critical thinking, and we promote a culture of transparency and learning from our mistakes.\n\nThe future is digital, and we would be well advised to embrace it, and to trust the next generation to steer us in the right direction. By teaching our children to master digital skills and AI, we’re ensuring that the power of technology is used for good – and that it remains a tool for democracy and equality, not a weapon for control and division.\n\nReferences\n\nWatson, N (2024), Taming the Machine: Ethically Harness the Power of AI, Kogan Page\n\nMr Rickman\n\nDeputy Head Academic\n\nI said it last year, and I will say it again…. I love Sports Day! Huge thanks, as always, must go to our dedicated Sports faculty, and in particular to Mrs Littlewood who is the brains behind the operation for the Sports Day itself. I love sports day because of what it represents. A coming together of our community as a whole, pupils, teachers and parents all celebrating, all having fun and all getting stuck in. I love the house system that represents family, and encourages pupils to take part as a cog in a bigger machine, recognising that they play an important role no matter what they are doing. And I love seeing the looks on their faces when they support each other, congratulating their peers on their successes and commiserating with them when things don’t go quite to plan. My personal challenge this year was adding up the scores on the results desk. All I will say is thank goodness that my companion was a mathematician, and I’ll move swiftly on!\n\nFollowing the fantastic success of our Sports Day last week, I was inspired to have a look at what is coming up for us over the summer in relation to sports. We are lucky that pupils at the High School value sport and are very enthusiastic about getting involved, trying new things and developing their competitive spirit. Whilst many sporting opportunities tail off a little during the summer holidays, many others are just getting started and this year in particular is a rather exciting one!\n\nThe summer of 2024 promises to be an exhilarating season for sports enthusiasts around the globe. From the iconic Wimbledon Championships in the UK to the highly anticipated Olympic Games in Paris, the season will be filled with thrilling competitions, record-breaking performances, and unforgettable moments. Special mention here to all those pupils who broke school or personal records last Friday! What an achievement for you all! So let’s have a look at what is coming up over the months ahead of us:\n\n2024 Olympic Games – Paris Let’s start with the big one. Arguably the biggest global sporting event, taking place once every 4 years, the Olympics represents a global phenomenon, where the global sporting community comes together to celebrate the wonders of sports and the individuals who train so hard to be the best in the world. The 2024 Summer Olympics, taking place from July 26 to August 11, will be hosted in Paris, France. This prestigious event will bring together over 10,000 athletes from more than 200 countries, competing in 33 sports across 50 disciplines. The Paris Olympics will introduce new sports such as breakdancing, surfing, and skateboarding, reflecting the evolving landscape of global sport. The event is, as it is every time, expected to be a showcase of human strength, agility, and determination, inspiring millions worldwide. I very much hope that our pupils will be watching, taking inspiration and considering what they might do to take part in more sporting activities in their future. It is never too late to try something new and with such a range of sports on offer these days, most people will find something they enjoy.\n\nWimbledon Championships One of the oldest and most prestigious tennis tournaments (and my personal favourite annual event in the sporting calendar!), the Wimbledon Championships, will take place from June 24 to July 14, 2024. Held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London, Wimbledon is renowned for its rich traditions, including its grass courts, strict dress code, and the consumption of Pimms, strawberries and cream by spectators.\n\nThis year, our NHS tennis players and fans will surely be eagerly watching to see if Katie Boulter, the British number one, will take to the courts again to challenge her international counterparts. Or perhaps we will see the return of last year’s wild cards, Harriet Dart or Jodie Burrage. We have certainly had our own success with tennis over the last 12 months, with our Senior School team winning the overall GDST Tennis Trophy last season. This was a huge achievement as the competition was strong, but out of the family of schools, none could match Northampton High School!\n\nUEFA Euro 2024 Football fans around the world are eagerly awaiting UEFA Euro 2024, set to be hosted by Germany from June 14 to July 14. The tournament will feature 24 national teams competing across 10 cities, including Berlin, Munich, and Frankfurt. This edition of the Euros promises intense rivalries, thrilling matches, and the emergence of new footballing talents.\n\nOf course, we will have to wait a little longer for the Women’s tournament, taking place in 2025, but the qualifying matches kick off (pardon the pun!) this summer. I know our girls are eager to see if the Lionesses can retain their title from 2022 as the defending champions. Will they bring football home once more?\n\nThe Ashes 2024 Cricket enthusiasts will be treated to the historic Ashes series between England and Australia, beginning in June 2024. This bi-annual Test series, steeped in over a century of tradition, is one of the most fiercely contested rivalries in cricket. Matches will be held at iconic venues such as Lord’s, The Oval, and Old Trafford, with both teams vying for the prestigious urn. The Ashes not only capture the imagination of cricket fans in the UK and Australia but also draw attention from a global audience. The series will feature some of the world’s best cricketers, promising dramatic twists and unforgettable moments.\n\nOur own cricketers at the High school have been going from strength to strength over the last few years and the sport is generally becoming much more popular amongst women and girls across the UK.\n\nBritish Grand Prix Those of you who live south of Towcester will be familiar with the annual disruption to the A43 which forces commuters and those of the school run to venture into the rural heart of the Northamptonshire country lanes! As always, this year the Silverstone Circuit will host the British Grand Prix on July 7, 2024, as part of the Formula 1 World Championship. Known for its high-speed straights and challenging corners, Silverstone is a favourite among drivers and fans alike. British drivers like Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris will look to shine on home soil, adding to the excitement.\n\nThe British Grand Prix is a highlight of the UK sporting calendar but perhaps still most often associated as a male dominated sport. Motor racing generally has not seen large numbers of female competitors, but with notable exceptions like Abbie Eaton, most recently known for her involvement with The Grand Tour and the Smallest Cog, will more women be inspired to get involved? For the 2024 grand prix, a number of the race teams have announced female drivers. Look out for them on the circuit this year!\n\nAt Northampton High School, we recognise the value of sport for our pupils. Engaging in sports provides numerous physical health benefits for young people. Regular physical activity helps in developing strong muscles and bones, improving cardiovascular health, and maintaining a healthy weight. It also promotes better sleep patterns and reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Moreover, participation in sports can boost mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. The release of endorphins during physical activity creates a sense of well-being and happiness. This holistic approach to health underscores the importance of sports in the lives of young people.\n\nSports offer a valuable platform for young people to develop essential social skills. Team sports, in particular, teach the importance of collaboration, communication, and teamwork. Young athletes learn to work together towards a common goal, support their teammates, and build trust. These experiences foster a sense of belonging and camaraderie, which are crucial for social development. As part of our wider work within the Pastoral team, we are huge advocates of sport because we see the benefits it brings to the social lives of our pupils, and ultimately, the happiness that this can provide them with. Additionally, sports encourage leadership skills. Captains and team leaders learn to motivate their peers, make strategic decisions, and handle pressure. These skills are transferable to other areas of life, including higher education and professional environments, where employers are specifically seeking individuals who can inspire and lead a team to achieve highly in the workplace.\n\nParticipation in sports has also been linked to improved academic performance. The discipline, time management, and goal-setting skills learned through sports can translate into better study habits and academic achievements. Physical activity has also been shown to enhance cognitive function, leading to better concentration, memory, and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, sports can provide young people with opportunities for scholarships and educational advancement. Many universities and colleges offer athletic scholarships, enabling talented athletes to pursue higher education while continuing to excel in their chosen sports. And perhaps most importantly, sports can force us out of our comfort zone, teaching us resilience when things get tough. All of our pupils will need resilience at some point in their academic careers as challenges are posed at every level.\n\nSo, the summer of 2024 promises to be a spectacular season for sports, with global events like the Olympics, Wimbledon, and Euro 2024 capturing the world’s attention. I hope our pupils will be inspired by the teams and individuals that they might witness over the coming months, and recognise the values of dedication and perseverance that are displayed by the athletes themselves. Many of our girls, I am sure, will recognise those attributes in their own commitment to sports and be proud to be a part of the global sporting community. At Northampton High School, the ethos towards sports reflects a commitment to developing well-rounded, resilient, and socially responsible individuals. By offering a diverse range of sporting opportunities and fostering an inclusive environment, the school ensures that every student can enjoy and benefit from physical activity. As we look forward to a summer of thrilling sporting action, we are reminded of the profound impact that sports can have on the lives of young people, both on and off the field. Beyond that, of course, we look to the new academic year and the wide range of clubs and sporting opportunities open to all members of our community. I hope you have a wonderful summer when it comes and I very much hope the rain will stay away long enough for you and your families to engage in sports over the holiday.\n\nMiss Kneen\n\nDeputy Head Pastoral\n\nSo says Cicero, better known as a great Roman lawyer, statesman and letterwriter than a horticulturalist. His famous saying asks us to reflect on a need for balance, between the busy world outside, and the internal world of reflection. Cicero uses his garden both as a retreat from politics and as a sanctuary to reflect on the nature of ‘nature’ itself. However, the link between learning and nature goes deeper – our external environment can shape and influence our internal psychology. Without a calming natural oasis, are we capable of great leaps of intellect?\n\nFar from being a sanctuary, nature today is more often a cause for concern for both old and young but most especially the young, with over 75% describing the future as ‘frightening’ because of the effect of climate change. From the forest fires in Europe and record breaking monthly temperatures in the UK to the ubiquity of micro-plastics, air pollution or the endangerment of remote islands (or even cities here in the UK) from rising sea levels, Mother Nature affects us all.\n\nBut how best can we look after her, and can we help ourselves at the same time?\n\nOne of the best and easiest ways is by looking after the green spaces around us, and in so doing, we look after our wellbeing. Whether it be a local park, a garden, a roof top terrace, balcony, windowsill or yard, ‘green exercise’ – as gardening and other forms of exercise outside have become known – can contribute to an increase in physical and mental wellbeing. As little as five minutes can make a difference, and mowing, digging, planting and pruning can all count towards the 30 minutes of ‘moderate’ exercise recommended daily by the UK government (equivalent to the same duration of yoga or even badminton!). In 2021, the RHS released research that revealed those who garden every day have wellbeing scores 6.6% higher and stress levels 4.2% lower than people who don’t garden at all. Green exercise can benefit mental as well as physical health: given that “up to 20% of people visit their GPs for what is primarily a social rather than a health problem”, the creation of pioneering social prescribing schemes at places like RHS Bridgewater can help people who need connection to improve mental health, rather than just focusing on medication alone.\n\nThe conclusion? Get outside, and get involved!\n\nAll of this is good news for us, as we are incredibly lucky that our school site encompasses so much green space and opportunity for the student body to interact with the environment around us. For learning, quiet times with friends, fun, games, outdoor lessons, (a short cut to lunch?), the Cripps, Derngate and Towerfield quads offer a more formal garden environment, enriched with herbaceous planting, shrubs, herbs and seasonal flowers, as well as the greenhouse, fountain, arbour, benches and areas of wildflower meadow in ‘No Mow May.’ The Creative Arts Faculty in our Senior School are soon to add a new growing space for edibles via their greenhouse. Bird feeders help the birds through winter, and our Eco Team were able to supply new feeders to replace our old ones last year; we have many nest boxes around the site, and our students enjoy contributing to the RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch annual surveys. Staff are encouraged to take a Wildlife Wander to enrich their wellbeing, and we encourage citizen science in other areas, too, like the annual Butterfly conservation surveys in the summer months.\n\nOur Wildlife Gardening Club have won awards, learning not just Level 1 but also Level 2 in the RHS School garden campaign for their attempts to grow a range of fruit and vegetables (peas, beans and wildflowers very successfully, but marigolds and radishes less so!) Their activities have also helped the school garner the Woodland Trust’s Bronze, Silver and Gold awards, for finding out about carbon reduction in school, climate change, recycling, making decorations from foraged materials and learning more about trees and folklore traditions. This year, we’ve focused on improving mental health in the garden, and have trialled mindfulness in the courtyard, forest bathing and more art activities, such as Shakespeare’s flowers, acting A Midsummer Night’s Dream, making garden clay sculptures and cane toppers to personalise our spaces; cherry blossom viewing and matcha tea was a personal highlight! The Wildlife Trust have awarded us their ‘Wildlife Gardening Award’ for the habitat provision we have in school, commitment to homes for bees, bugs and birds, recycling materials, providing green corridors and walls, and composting what we can. Many thanks to past and current students in Yr 5, 6, 7, 9 and, especially, Elisha and Rishika in Yr 12 for helping to lead the club this year.\n\nPerhaps next we should focus on greening the inside space, too, as research has found that having house plants in office spaces can improve productivity by up to 15%, and the scent of rosemary has indeed been proven to increase memory (great for GCSE students before exams!)\n\nSo, is NHS an oasis of calm in which students can pose rigorous academic questions whilst also taking the time to reflect and nurture their own development?\n\nWe are proud to say that our school is “a calm, happy and purposeful place in which to learn” where “pupils apply themselves readily to acquiring new skills and are willing to take risks in their learning.”\n\nWhat more can we do? I am sure our students will tell us, and lead the way.\n\nHere are their top 10 tips of things you can do for nature, wildlife and yourself:\n\nReduce, reuse and recycle (check if you’re not sure, and don’t buy if you won’t use)\n\nConserve water (make a rain garden? Use grey water?)\n\nBuy local (think food miles, and carbon footprint)\n\nTake a minute everyday just to breathe and listen (appreciate what you’ve got!)\n\nLook after a houseplant\n\nPut up a bird feeder, or make your own\n\nThrow a wildflower seed bomb (or make your own)\n\nGrow some herbs on a windowsill\n\nTake a walk once a week, and list the things you see, hear and touch\n\nEveryone can do something for nature – you just have to start!\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://horticulture.co.uk/houseplants/statistics/\n\nhttps://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_409094_en.html\n\nhttps://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/health-and-wellbeing/articles/Lockdown-lowdown\n\nhttps://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/health-and-wellbeing/articles/social-prescribing\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/uk-adults-houseplants-poll-gen-z-b1885308.html\n\nhttps://www.itv.com/news/london/2022-12-02/ellas-law-clean-air-bill-passes-in-the-lords-and-heads-to-the-commons\n\nhttps://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/health-and-wellbeing/articles/why-gardening-makes-us-feel-better\n\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-for-people-of-three-different-weights\n\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-21/young-the-garden/4437806\n\nBarton, J., & Pretty, J. (2010). What is the best dose of nature and green exercise for improving mental health? A multi-study analysis. Environmental Science and Technology, 44, 3947–395\n\nMrs Peto\n\nTeacher of Latin\n\nThe vexed question of homework and its impact on learning and family life\n\nHomework is an age-old educational practice that has been a subject of serious debate for decades – not just among academics but also between parents and (recalcitrant) children. And, to an extent, might not the children be right? The simple fact that homework has always been a facet of school life does not mean it has intrinsic value. Still, something seems to tell us that continuing the learning from school into the evenings and weekends must have benefits, surely? ‘Well it was good enough for me…’\n\nIn recent years, academic research has shed more light on the nuanced benefits of homework and how it can be effectively utilised to bolster a pupil’s learning journey. It has also, however, pointed out the negative effects of unnecessary and time-consuming work given seemingly simply as a Pavlovian response to the lesson bell ringing. In the words of educationalist Kieran Larkin OBE, ‘what should schools and students do to make homework worthwhile? It’s not about the length of time spent on it. It’s about using the time spent on it for a reason.’\n\nAt the High School we refer to work beyond the classroom as ‘prep’. This might be used in some schools simply as a traditional synonym for homework, however, it is much more than that for us. Many parents and guardians may not be aware that the word only relatively recently came back into use at the school, following the findings of a working party led by our School Consultant Teacher, Debbie Hill.\n\nMrs Hill’s remit in school, as well as in the wider GDST, is to support evidence-engaged practices in teaching and learning. Her support meant that we had access to the most pertinent research around the issue, and three surveys were also carried out by the working party. The primary outcome of the consultation was the creation of an acronym: ‘prep’.\n\nThe acronym consists of four elements that we considered to be important in making the most of any work to be completed outside the classroom. These are expressed as verbs, placing the emphasis on action rather than passivity, and teachers are encouraged to think about which element they are focusing on when setting work. Some even offer a menu with suggested tasks under each heading:\n\nP – prepare. Homework should help pupils get ready for the next stage of their learning in school. For example, pre-reading, watching a ‘flipped classroom’ video, where the teacher has explained a concept in advance, or simply learning something important for a lesson, such as some vocabulary.\n\nR – reflect. Studying outside of the classroom should be an opportunity to engage higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), such as asking wider questions about the topic, analysing different perspectives and synthesising ideas; all important elements of reflection.\n\nE – explore. Sometimes the best learning takes place when we least expect it to, for example, when reading about one topic opens doors to new areas of interest, or if when challenged with a problem to solve, pupils learn how to find answers for themselves.\n\nP – practise. One of the most useful processes for embedding learning comes through repetition. This is most helpful when preparing for assessments but should not be restricted to rote learning; inventive approaches including the use of technology can make working in this way a joy.\n\nThus, prep is not merely a means to extend the school day; rather, it becomes a crucial tool for reinforcing and internalising concepts learned in the classroom. When managed well, prep fosters a deeper understanding of subject matter by providing opportunities for independent practice and application of knowledge.\n\nThe effectiveness of prep clearly hinges on its quality and its alignment with specific learning objectives. Not all prep is created equal and our responsibility as teachers is to curate assignments that complement classroom work and cater to pupils’ individual needs, while offering them an appropriate level of challenge. Indeed, homework assignments focusing on problem-solving and HOTS have been shown to yield the most significant academic gains. In addition, by challenging pupils to think analytically and creatively, we cultivate a growth mindset and prepare them for the complexities of real-world scenarios.\n\nOf course, we also see prep as a way of encouraging a closer connection between school and homelife, ideally involving parents and guardians. Research in the Journal of Learning for Development found a positive correlation between parental engagement in prep activities and pupils’ academic achievement: when parents actively support their children with homework, they reinforce the importance of learning and create an environment for academic success.\n\nHowever, we need to strike a balance and ensure that homework doesn’t become a source of undue stress or conflict within the family. Prep should be purposeful, relevant, and scaffolded to support progress. For example, a mathematics teacher might offer a mix of drills, practical applications and reflective exercises to reinforce mathematical concepts and enhance problem-solving skills. Also teachers will often adapt assignments or offer a choice of activities to cater to the varied learning styles and aptitudes of their pupils, promoting inclusivity and academic success on a personal level.\n\nWe make it clear that pupils are not expected to spend endless hours drafting and revising their prep to make it perfect. In a fast-moving world, pupils not only need to work efficiently and with purpose, but they also need to be selective about where they place their energy. We advise younger pupils to spend the allotted amount of time on their prep and then to stop, informing the teacher if needed. This gives useful information to a teacher, even if the work is not completed, and can help us to reflect on the level and complexity of the work set in future.\n\nI would add to this that prep is for pupils and not parents – homework is certainly not worthwhile if it is effectively somebody else’s work. There is a fine line between supporting young people as they learn and taking the work on for yourself, as the famous line goes, ‘you know you’re a parent when you dread homework as much as your children’!\n\nIn older age groups too, prep should not become a burden. Where GCSE pupils find they have excessive work to do at home, we can advise on the number of subjects to be taken. There is no correct number of GCSEs and reducing from 10 to 9, for example, can provide precious space in the school day to allow for deeper learning in core subjects.\n\nTo support our approach in prep we embrace technology in the form of Google Classroom, both as a repository for resources and to facilitate the collection of work. As teachers have become more adept in using this technology, we have learnt to support pupils better. For example, use of the Kami app allows teachers to develop sophisticated past-paper sets for exams. Pupils can ‘write’ on the screen using a stylus, so this does not impact negatively on preparation for the real examinations. However, it means that teachers can offer feedback quickly and more insightfully. Use of the Mote app for this also allows teachers to create oral ‘feedback loops’ which encourage dialogue to improve outcomes.\n\nOf course, as a formative assessment tool, prep also allows teachers to gauge pupils’ understanding of key concepts, identify areas of difficulty, and tailor lessons accordingly. Likewise, pupils can use prep as an opportunity for self-assessment, reflecting on their learning progress and seeking clarification when needed. By fostering a culture of feedback and reflection, prep becomes a collaborative endeavour that empowers pupils to take ownership of their learning.\n\nSo the adults are perhaps right after all. When used thoughtfully, prep plays a vital role in the educational landscape. Research highlights its potential to reinforce learning, foster critical thinking skills and promote closer links between school and home. However, to realise these benefits, our responsibility is to design homework tasks that are appropriate in length and complexity, engaging, and most of all, aligned with our guiding principle of learning without limits.\n\nLarkin K (2013), Quoted in The Independent, 24 April 2013\n\nCahit E and Metin K (2020), A Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Parental Involvement on Students’ Academic Achievement, Journal of Learning for Development, Vol. 7, No. 3, pp. 367-383\n\nMr Rickman\n\nDeputy Head Academic\n\nLying is a universal human behaviour, and children are no exception. From innocent fibs about finishing their vegetables to more serious deceptions about their weekend whereabouts, children often resort to lying for various reasons. Now, I am not suggesting for one moment that all children are intentionally deceptive individuals, or that they are maliciously trying to pull the wool over our eyes. Lying is, in fact, a fairly normal part of the development phase in adolescents and, as a behaviour, it can reoccur at different phases of childhood. It is a fascinating element of human behaviour and cognitive development and one that, if better understood, can help us to navigate the real issues that children face, which might otherwise be lost under the guise of something else.\n\nUnderstanding Childhood Deception:\n\nTo understand why children lie, it’s crucial to examine the underlying motives driving their deceptive behaviour. While the reasons may vary from one child to another, several common factors contribute to the prevalence of lying among children.\n\nFear of Punishment: One of the primary reasons children lie to their parents is the fear of punishment. When faced with the prospect of being reprimanded or disciplined for their actions, children may resort to lying as a means of avoiding consequences. For example, a child who accidentally breaks a valuable item may deny their involvement out of fear of facing parental anger or punishment. When I was 5 I got into a lot of trouble for inscribing my name into a wooden chest that my parents kept vinyl records in, with a biro. I am told, although I don’t remember, that at the time I tried to blame my brother for this act of vandalism. What I did not appreciate, at the tender age of 5, was that my 2 year old brother did not have the dexterity to hold a pen properly let alone correctly spell my name. In fact he called my Betty until he was at least 4 as he struggled to pronounce a hard ‘ck’ sound of ‘Rebecca’ or ‘Becky’. I was, of course, found out!\n\nDesire for Approval: Children crave acceptance and validation from their parents, and lying may sometimes be a misguided attempt to seek approval. Whether it’s exaggerating their achievements or fabricating stories to impress their parents, children may resort to lying in pursuit of parental praise and attention. In the same way, children may lie, or perhaps exaggerate the truth, in order to gain a more sympathetic ear from their parents when they have suffered pain in some way, either physically or emotionally.\n\nProtection of Privacy: As children grow older and assert their independence, they may begin to value their privacy and autonomy much more. Lying about their activities or whereabouts may be a way for children to maintain a sense of privacy and control over their lives, particularly in adolescence when the desire for autonomy is heightened as part of the detachment process. As children become teenagers, they begin to subconsciously detach from their parents, in readiness for independence. In doing so, they often experience a deep desire to maintain elements of secrecy about themselves. They may well experience embarrassment when certain elements of their lives are exposed and will go to some lengths to prevent this happening. This presents a tricky path for parents to tread as they must walk the fine line of allowing their child time and space to develop in this way, but must also do what is necessary to keep them safe. The line itself is so fine, that it is almost impossible to avoid stepping too far one way or the other. In most circumstances, to play it safe, parents will trespass too far over the boundaries of privacy, as the alternative could have much more serious and significant consequences.\n\nAvoidance of Shame or Embarrassment: Children, like adults, experience emotions such as shame and embarrassment, which they may seek to avoid by lying. For instance, a child who feels ashamed of a poor performance at school may fabricate stories about their academic achievements to preserve their self-esteem and avoid feelings of inadequacy. Alternatively, they may design excuses which might explain away a poor result and remove their responsibility in the situation. Equally, shame felt over getting into trouble for poor behaviour may be a cause for children to be economic with the truth. Embarrassment can also cause a sense of anger, which often causes children to seek someone to blame and may lead to a deception in order to shift blame and focus to another individual. Children may feel shame or embarrassment for something they have done and so lie or exaggerate to cover it up. A classic example of this is exaggerating how much something has hurt them, perhaps when they fall over, in order to offer a reasonable explanation for their tears.\n\nExperimentation and Exploration: Lying can also be a natural part of childhood experimentation and exploration. As children navigate the complexities of social interactions and relationships, they may test the boundaries of honesty to see how others react. This experimentation with truth-telling versus lying is a normal aspect of cognitive and social development. It often happens during early childhood and can result in some pretty hilarious conversations with toddlers. My nephew recently told his pre-school supervisor that he is in charge at home and his family take all their instructions from him! Lies of this nature are often very creative and may include elements of absolute fantasy.\n\nLying by omission: This is incredibly common in children, teenagers and adults. As humans we often struggle to admit wrongdoing or admit that we make mistakes. As such, in school scenarios, where a fall out has occurred, it is rarely one sided and even more rarely, clear cut. Children will often talk to their parents about an incident in school where they have fallen out with a friend, or perhaps with a teacher. The story is often told in favour of the story teller in that instance, and rarely includes the full truth of the part that they have played. For example, a child comes home and tells their parents that their teacher was horrible to them today and shouted at them in front of all their friends because the teacher, ‘hates [me]!’. They omit the part about them talking consistently in the lesson and disrupting others, they omit the part where they were late because they decided the end of break was the correct time to fill up their water bottle, and they omit the fact that they did not complete the classwork to a satisfactory standard or complete their prep from the week before. They are upset that they were called out on their behaviour and embarrassed that their peers witnessed this. The result may be a version of the truth but is not the full story.\n\nThe Normality of Lying in Child Development:\n\nWhile lying is often perceived as morally wrong, it is important to recognise that it is a normative behaviour in child development. Research in developmental psychology suggests that lying serves adaptive functions and plays a crucial role in children’s socioemotional development.\n\nAccording to Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, children progress through distinct stages of moral reasoning, with lying emerging as a natural consequence of cognitive growth. In the early stages of development, children operate under a strict adherence to rules and authority figures, leading to a black-and-white view of morality. Children will often view a lie as a crime, and can be brutally honest in their communications. As children mature and develop a more nuanced understanding of social norms and moral principles, they begin to recognize the complexities of honesty and deception. Piaget recognised the significance of lying more generally for children’s moral development, identifying it as a significant issue if it is not addressed with children at an early enough stage, but also that it does form a normal part of the development process.\n\nFurthermore, studies in neuroscience have shed light on the brain mechanisms underlying deceptive behaviour in children. Studies have shown that areas of the brain associated with cognitive control and inhibitory processes are activated when children engage in deception. These findings suggest that lying requires cognitive effort and involves the deliberate suppression of truthful responses. In essence, it requires creativity, and a level of social understanding where they can recognise that different opinions might be a play, and therefore they are able to offer an alternative to the truth that might be believed.\n\nMoreover, research has demonstrated that lying can be a marker of cognitive development and social intelligence in children. In a study published in the journal Child Development (Peterson, et al, 1983), researchers found that children who were more adept at lying demonstrated higher levels of theory of mind—the ability to understand others’ thoughts, beliefs, and intentions. This suggests that lying may serve as a proxy measure of children’s social cognitive abilities and their understanding of others’ perspectives.\n\nThe Lies we tell:\n\nIt is also important to recognise that adults also tell lies. We do so for a number of reasons and a number of the lies we tell are directed at children. Why do we do this? There are several reasons for adult deception, and we see evidence of this in the media almost daily, but two of the most legitimate reasons for lying to children specifically might well be to protect and to create a sense of fun and wonder for our little ones.\n\nFor example, when considering protection, we might over exaggerate the dangers of something to ensure we put our children off doing it. Telling a child that if they steal biscuits out of the tin, the cookie monster will come and take them away. This is, of course, a lie but it might be viewed as serving a greater purpose in teaching the child about the rights and wrongs of ‘taking without asking’.\n\nSimilarly, we might lie to protect a child’s feelings. When your 6 year old comes home from school with a less than flattering family portrait that they have spent all afternoon working on in their art lesson, do you berate them for insulting the size of your head or giving you a purple bulbous nose? Of course not! That masterpiece is going straight on the fridge! Adult to adult, we behave similarly. The age old question of, ‘Does this dress make me look thinner?’ needs answering with tact and care. Answering, ‘It’s not a magic dress darling!’ probably won’t win you any brownie points with your significant other and could lead to an uncomfortable silence for the rest of the evening.\n\nIn terms of creating a sense of fun or wonder, do we even need to talk about Father Christmas, the Tooth Fairy and the Easter bunny? You probably get my point well enough without further need for elaboration. If you are reading this aloud in the presence of small children, apologies for any subsequent uncomfortable questions coming your way!\n\nSo, the phenomenon of childhood lying is multifaceted, influenced by a range of psychological, social, and cognitive factors. From fear of punishment to the desire for approval, children may resort to lying for various reasons, particularly in interactions with their parents. However, it is essential to recognize that lying is a normal aspect of child development, serving adaptive functions and reflecting children’s growing understanding of social norms and moral principles. By understanding the underlying motives driving childhood deception and the developmental significance of lying, parents, caregivers and educators can foster open communication and cultivate honesty in their children. Understanding some of the reasons behind childhood deceptive behaviours can also help parents to navigate the school years more effectively, supporting where needed and recognising that what is said is not always the full story. If we can unpick this with children and teens, we can start to help them to resolve the real issues that may be at the source of the lie and improve their overall wellbeing as a result. I am not suggesting for one second that we should not believe children when they tell us something is wrong. This in itself would be fundamentally unhelpful, and even potentially harmful, to the situation. However we should recognise that there could be more to the story.\n\nMiss Kneen\n\nDeputy Head Pastoral\n\nThis year, Science Week has the theme of Time. I googled the word ‘time’ and there are so many different uses of the word, from ‘once upon a time’ to ‘time management’ and many philosophical concepts in between. I settled on a theme of ‘once upon a time’ for my whole school assembly and shared with the young audience my personal timeline that led me to this current moment.\n\nAlong the way I shared the choices I have made and the consequences, both good and bad that those choices had, but all came good in the end. Looking back at the timeline whilst writing the assembly made me think about all the good memories in my school days, both primary and secondary and how important it is to make the most of the time you have in school, taking all the opportunities on offer.\n\nOn Tuesday, I had the privilege of delivering a Science Week assembly to the Junior School, which is one of my favourite assemblies as the pupils are all so keen and focussed on your every word. The STEM Ambassadors in Junior School helped with the assembly, and we taught the girls how to make an egg float, tie dye some milk and stab a potato with a plastic straw – all practical experiments they can do at home in a short period of time. It has also been an absolute pleasure to spend time with Years 3 to 6 in my lab in Senior School this week, concocting Harry Potter science spells. The girls’ expressions of awe and wonder at interacting with chemistry were a joy to behold.\n\nSo far it is only Tuesday in my week and we have put time in a line, shared a timeline, thought about good times, made the most of time in school and used a short amount of time to show some awesome experiments. Many uses of the word time and many uses of time itself.\n\nOn Tuesday I had the pleasure to take some Year 13 students on their final trip with Northampton High, and we ventured to Cadbury World. How is STEM related to Cadbury World, I hear you ask? Well, everywhere: In the manufacturing process, in the factory’s health and safety, in the psychology of the advertising and in the physics of the machinery needed to make a million Creme Eggs. We were also treated to an interactive timeline of the development of the Cadbury factory and the movement to fair wages and a 5-day working week. Some of the girls were surprised this had not always been the case, and that ‘in the olden days’ you worked all day, every day. Who knows where the Year 13’s timelines will take them after their time at Northampton High?\n\nThere have been mini science experiments in the Junior School foyer on a daily basis, which have captivated parents and girls alike. Lots of challenging questions being asked about how long a boat can float and how we can make a Skittles colour wheel just from water and the brightly coloured sweets.\n\nWe concluded Science Week with talks led by students past and present. Alexa Dykes – who left 4 years ago – gave the Reach Lecture on her time at the High School and her lasting message to the current students was to reach for your goals and even if you do not make it at the first attempt, to keep trying and use your time here wisely, seeking support, taking the trips, participating in the clubs and preparing yourself for future challenges. On Friday morning, Senior School was treated to a student-led assembly on #Women in STEM and their pathways for the future, and how time management and having a good time fits into their plans.\n\nIn summary, we have ventured down the rabbit hole of time and had a wonderful time exploring! We have investigated, trialled, explained and discovered many uses and meanings of time. I hope your daughter will be able to tell you about some of the Science Week-related experiences we have shared.\n\nMrs Hodgetts-Tate\n\nHead of Science Faculty\n\nAs part of the wider support for the 25 schools in the GDST, the Trust has specialist teams offering training and advice on areas as diverse as health and safety and educational trips and visits. As you might expect, I work closely with the Innovation and Learning team directed by Dr Kevin Stannard, whose work (including ‘Why (and how) girls thrive in girls-only schools’) may be known to some of you already.\n\nYou might consider this part of the GDST to be the ‘academic’ directorate, which would be correct, as they do maintain the overview of educational provision and achievement across our schools. However, the choice of words in the title ‘innovation and learning’, to me, speaks volumes about the priorities and values of the team working under Dr Stannard.\n\nThis week I attended a conference of other academic deputy heads and colleagues with responsibility for innovation and educational technology (edtech). There were two areas of focus; developments in public examinations incorporating digital technology, and artificial intelligence (AI) in schools, but with a focus on assessment specifically. We were joined by speakers from the main examination boards as well as experts from the wider assessment sector.\n\nYou may have read that a number of exam boards are trialling digital assessments currently, with the AQA board initially planning to introduce a limited number of modern language GCSEs using on-screen technology in the next academic year. AQA has also developed an adaptive assessment for Maths that can help teachers save time when diagnosing learning gaps from earlier years. The OCR board too has come on board with this concept and has plans in place to make its Computer Science qualifications available online from 2025. Interestingly, though, some of these developments appear to have been pushed back by at least a year as the boards seek Ofqual approval for the changes.\n\nThe case for on-screen assessments has perhaps become clearer since the pandemic, but moves towards this as a principle go back many years, with exam boards initially setting up working parties in the 2000s. The benefits of the approach have been widely understood in the world of work and there are effective digital assessments taking place in many areas of professional life already. The technology is tried and tested in this respect. However, concerns about the viability of running digital assessments still prevail within the education sector.\n\nThis is in spite of the positive views students have of the potential for digital assessments to improve their experience of testing. AQA has conducted research specifically into this, leading to a report which points to 68% of students agreeing that increasing digital learning and assessment would be a beneficial move. Young people mention reasons such as this being truer to the digital world they are growing up in, the reduced risk of examiner bias based on handwriting ability, improvements in accessibility for SEND pupils and, tellingly, the environmental benefits of reducing paper use and avoiding the mass transportation of exams.\n\nThe role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also a hot topic in the world of assessment, as it is in many other areas of education. Currently exam boards put a huge amount of time and energy into the production of examinations for the range of subjects offered, and also place a high premium on the security and integrity of these papers. This is because the production of the papers is enormously time consuming and costly on a human resources level. However, AI can effectively create multiple versions of exams with minimal time and resources expended, so this becomes less of an issue and papers can be replaced as needed. We see this already in place in many areas, with the driving theory test, for example, existing in ever-changing versions so that it cannot effectively be rote learned.\n\nA further benefit of this approach is that exams can be administered in a more adaptive manner. Students do not need to take the paper at exactly the same time and the logistics of finding suitable spaces and resources to be provided simultaneously is less of an issue. Notably, SEND pupils can be given assessments that not only match their learning styles but operate in a way that supports their personal needs more effectively too.\n\nWhile most examinations will still be paper based for the next few years at least, there is no doubt that a change will come. Ofqual has very reasonable demands of the assessment authorities to ensure that pupils are not put at a disadvantage and that the validity of examinations is not undermined by any changes. They are certainly not rushing into this. However, while this approach is understandable and honourable, it is equally important not to underestimate the value that a change could offer to many students. Our world will only become more digitally focused and young people will not thank us for holding them back.\n\nMr Rickman\n\nDeputy Head Academic\n\nhttps://www.schoolbus.co.uk/news/featured-article/digital-exams-to-be-rolled-out-for-some-subjects-from-2026-says-aqa/9872\n\nhttps://www.twinkl.co.uk/news/largest-exam-board-announces-move-to-digital-assessment-in-some-subjects\n\nhttps://filestore.aqa.org.uk/content/about-us/education-policy/AQA-DIGITAL-EXAMS-IN-ENGLAND-REPORT.PDF\n\nhttps://www.aqa.org.uk/news/personalised-maths-test-to-transform-support-for-struggling-students\n\nhttps://blog.rmresults.com/digital-assessment-v-traditional-assessment\n\nInternational Women’s Day 2024\n\nOn this International Women’s Day, I would like to put the spotlight on female role models in a slightly different way. It is undeniably vital for young women to have positive female role models for a multitude of reasons, spanning personal development, societal progress, and the cultivation of a diverse and inclusive culture. First and foremost, positive female role models provide young women with tangible examples of success and achievement. These role models showcase that women can excel in various fields, from academia and business to sports and the arts. By seeing other women break barriers and reach new heights, young women are encouraged to aspire to greatness themselves, fostering ambition and self-confidence. Each year, pupils will recommend women who they look up to. Beyoncé Knowles, Michele Obama and Olivia Coleman being some of the most popular.\n\nPositive female role models contribute to the creation of a more diverse and inclusive culture. By showcasing the richness and diversity of women’s experiences, these role models celebrate the unique talents, perspectives, and contributions of women from all backgrounds. This diversity not only enriches our collective understanding but also fosters empathy, understanding, and solidarity across communities. Dr. Lee’s recent assembly, where she highlighted the remarkable journey of Mercedes Gleitze, serves as a poignant reminder of the profound impact that positive female role models can have on young women.\n\nMercedes Gleitze’s story is one of perseverance, resilience, and triumph over failure. Born into a relatively modest background, daughter of a teacher and a baker, Mercedes did not have the privilege of huge wealth or social status. However, what she lacked in material resources, she made up for with sheer grit and determination. Despite facing numerous obstacles along the way, she remained steadfast in her pursuit of achieving her goals. Her unwavering resolve propelled her to achieve remarkable feats in swimming, setting multiple records in the sport of endurance and long distance swimming, and after 8 attempts, successfully swam the British channel on October 7, 1927. She became the first woman to complete this challenge and completed several other noteworthy swims, subsequently to this, including swimming the Straits of Gibraltar, the Northern channel (between Ireland and Scotland), conquered many other international bodies of water, and became the first person to swim to Robben Island and back to Cape Town.\n\nWhat makes Mercedes’ story so compelling is that she defied the odds stacked against her. When her trainer warned her about the cold sea and extreme fatigue, stating it was a challenge even for the strongest men, Mercedes responded, ‘Well, thank God I’m a woman’. She refused to be bound by societal norms or limitations, forging her own path to success and refused to give up after setbacks and failed attempts. When faced with claims that her success in the English Channel had been a hoax and her integrity was questioned, she remained determined to prove to the disbelievers that she was the real deal. Her journey serves as a beacon of hope for young women everywhere, showing them that greatness knows no boundaries and can overcome hurdles or barriers placed in their way. Regardless of background or circumstance, anyone can achieve their dreams with perseverance and determination.\n\nGleidze’s story is certainly one to remember, however, in a world where the media often glorifies celebrities and public figures, it is sometimes easy to overlook the everyday heroes, the women in our lives who quietly inspire us with their resilience, determination, and kindness. These unsung heroines, our mothers, grandmothers, aunts, sisters, cousins, teachers, coaches and friends, play a vital role in shaping our identities and aspirations. Their stories of triumph over adversity resonate deeply with us, providing a source of motivation and empowerment.\n\nMiss Robinson’s initiative to encourage students to reflect on positive female role models in their own lives is a commendable one. It prompts us to look beyond the glitz and glamour of celebrity culture and recognise the unsung heroines who shape our daily lives. These women may not grace the covers of magazines or command millions of followers on social media, but their impact is immeasurable. They are the ones who quietly inspire us with their strength, compassion, and resilience.\n\nIn solidarity with this initiative, I would like to share my own example of a positive female role model: my friend, Laura Cooper-Wortley. I am blessed to have a number of inspiring females in my life, from whom I could choose. However, I have chosen Laura because, as well as being genuinely inspirational, she is significantly younger than me, a fact that often means we are less likely to recognise someone as a role model.\n\nLaura has worked in a number of roles for a variety of companies in the time that I have known her, but she has always worked. Her expertise is in the health care sector, and perhaps that is an indication of the type of person that she is. Alongside working in an industry that is challenging and requires long hours, over the last few years, Laura has been completing a history degree in her spare time. In addition, she has planned her own wedding (and the majority of mine!) and navigated the ups and downs of buying and renovating a house in the village where she grew up. She is the proud owner of two of the bounciest dogs you are ever likely to encounter, and they take up a good deal of her time. Last year she decided that this was not sufficient and took up golf, dedicating many hours to practise and quickly becoming proficient enough to keep pace with her husband who has been playing for the last 25 years!\n\nAs if this combination of achievements were not enough of a demonstration of resilience and pushing for more, in 2022 Laura recognised a significant need in her local area and set up a registered charity to tackle period poverty. This venture has grown rapidly and her charity, A bag for Flo, now serves communities across Daventry, Northampton and Towcester, with the possibility of it moving to neighbouring counties in the coming months. It has developed to include maternity products for new mums and this is a current area for expansion. If you would like to know more about ‘A bag for Flo’, or would be interested in supporting them in any way, please follow this link to find out more – https://www.abagforflo.com/.\n\nOn top of all of this, Laura also deals with her own health concerns, successfully managing an auto-immune disease that periodically forces her to drop everything and simply be for days at a time. How she manages to keep so many balls in the air at one time and manage her health and still have time for cups of tea, trips to the garden centre and dinners at the driving range with friends, I will never know. One thing I do know, however, is that she is an inspiration for me and many others and she is a fantastic role model for women in a huge number of different ways.\n\nSo whoever they may be, family member, friend or celebrity, positive female role models serve as mentors and guides, offering valuable advice, support, and encouragement to young women navigating their own paths. These role models provide invaluable insight and guidance, helping young women overcome challenges and make informed decisions about their futures. Beyond individual growth, positive female role models play a crucial role in driving societal progress. By challenging stereotypes and defying traditional gender roles, these role models pave the way for greater gender equality and inclusivity. Their presence in leadership positions and influential roles sends a powerful message about the capabilities and contributions of women, inspiring broader societal change and breaking down barriers for future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, the importance of positive female role models cannot be overstated. They serve as beacons of hope and inspiration, guiding young women through life’s challenges and empowering them to realise their full potential. While celebrities may capture the spotlight, it is the everyday heroines, the women in our own lives, who truly make a difference. I look forward to seeing who our pupils choose to recognise as their own positive female role models over the coming weeks. So, let us celebrate their contributions and honour their legacies by striving to be positive role models ourselves. Together, we can create a world where every young woman feels empowered and supported to achieve her dreams.\n\nMiss Kneen\n\nDeputy Head Pastoral\n\nLast week was Children’s Mental Health Week (5-11 February 2024) and the theme this year was ‘My Voice Matters’. The event is run and organised by the children’s mental health charity Place2Be, and the theme focuses on encouraging children and young people to feel confident that they can express themselves.\n\nThe charity says that allowing young people to speak up has a positive impact on wellbeing and that children who feel that their voices are heard are more connected to their communities, which can raise their self-esteem. Demonstrating to young people that their views and experiences matter improves their sense of belonging and helps them feel like valued members of the school community. It promotes feelings of empowerment and agency and is a vital way to understand and meet the needs of pupils. It also means that wellbeing initiatives are more likely to become part of the fabric of school life.\n\nIn practice, achieving this requires more than handing out surveys designed by adults once a term. It also means going further than just asking the ‘usual suspects’ for their opinions. Rather, there are many ways for all children’s and young people’s voices to be heard when they feel they need to express something. Taking a whole school approach and championing a culture of openness and dialogue around mental health and wellbeing is the foundation to creating an environment in which children are empowered to speak. The opportunities at Northampton High for inviting and hearing pupil voice are numerous and woven through every aspect of the school.\n\nFirstly, and fundamentally, the ethos of the school supports the importance of pupil voice, as pupils are known as individuals, are personally supported in their educational and pastoral journey through school, and every pupil has the opportunity to be heard, on any topic, every day.\n\nWe have a structured, sustainable approach: Meaningful pupil voice initiative is more than just a one-off event or meeting; it’s a sustainable process that’s integrated into the school’s culture. This requires a structured approach, with clearly defined processes and regular opportunities for students to express their thoughts and ideas.\n\nOur school is organisationally structured in a way to provide dedicated and focused support to pupils – from the class teacher and form tutor structures to the Heads of Year roles, from the Wellbeing Practitioner, Mrs Giordano (fondly known as Mrs G) to the School Nurse, Mrs Dunkley, and Nurse Assistant, Mrs Brown, there are adults in school with expertise to support the mental health and wellbeing of all students. Throughout Children’s Mental Health Week, the team delivered assemblies, drop in sessions, visits from The Lowdown, a local mental health charity providing free and confidential support services for 11-25 year olds in Northamptonshire; there have been lunchtime ‘walk and talk’ mentoring sessions, opportunities to express feelings of wellbeing via an anonymous sticky note collage, and much more.\n\nInclusivity is key and is at the heart of meaningful pupil voice. Every student, regardless of background, should have equal opportunities to be involved and express their views.\n\nPupils’ views and insights are invited and considered in a plethora of ways in the day to day of school life. Just a few examples are as follows: Learning Ambassadors take on research and feed back their findings on the curriculum and the teaching and learning practice in the classroom. School Council members meet fortnightly, representing their classes and forms to discuss issues students are facing, ably led by a member of the Student Senior Leadership Team (SSLT). Eco Team members from across the age groups discuss sustainability initiatives and look to make a difference on the immediate and wider environment. The School Lunch Committee discusses menu choices and food preferences. A new student group of ‘Undivided Champions’ has been established this academic year, comprising representatives from every form group in the Senior School to discuss issues and themes around diversity and inclusion, again led by a dedicated member of the SSLT.\n\nThe first meeting of the Undivided Champions last week was inspiring. Students introduced themselves, and then quickly opened up to explore and discuss diversity and inclusion-related issues close to their hearts – expressing a desire to learn more about neurodiversity, an enthusiasm to build on the annual Cultures Day in the summer, raising stress management around exams and academic validation, requesting a permanent venue for prayer and quiet contemplation – just some of the themes voiced. Rich insights into the topics that matter to them as individuals and to their peers.\n\nBy keeping student voice at the heart of the school community, we not only keep pupil wellbeing central to life in school, we contribute to:\n\nan improved sense of belonging and community in the school\n\nan improved sense of identity for students\n\ndeveloping students’ confidence and self-esteem\n\nproviding a safe space for students to share lived experiences, and\n\nidentifying issues or specific students who are having difficulties and who may need further support\n\nWhy is creating a sense of belonging important? Research shows ‘a sense of belonging’ is important for pupils’ learning, wellbeing and behaviour. Pupils who have a ‘sense of belonging’ in schools tend to be happier, more confident and perform better academically according to research by UCL Institute of Education (IOE).\n\nIt is associated with academic success and motivation. There is much research to back this up; research indicates a sense of belonging is positively associated with academic success and motivation (Freeman, Anderman and Jensen 2007). Students who feel they belong are more likely to see the value of required work and have higher self-belief in their chances to succeed on their course (Verschelden 2017). Becker and Luthar (2002) found this is especially important for the performance of adolescents coming from ethnic minority and lower socioeconomic backgrounds. It affects students’ wellbeing: Empirical studies have linked perceptions of school and belonging to positive psychological outcomes, including positive emotions, feelings of self-worth and social acceptance (Pittman and Richmond 2007, Wilson et al. 2015). More broadly, Maslow (1968) found that proper, adequate and timely satisfaction of the need for belonging leads to physical, emotional, behavioural and mental wellbeing.\n\nBelonging is the sense of being somewhere you can be confident that you will fit in and feel safe in who you are. Strategies to create a sense of belonging in school can be shown to be linked to: increased student motivation, improved academic achievement; reductions in student absenteeism; increased staff wellbeing and motivation and other positive social outcomes including health and wellbeing. The study also concludes that where schools are places of belonging, the benefits are far reaching for staff, as well as students.\n\nIn UCL’s IOE research, “The emphasis is on relationships. Interventions are purposeful. The aim is to create a sense of place, belonging and agency. We found that intentional whole-school practice can help create a climate of welcome and belonging in school for all.”\n\nFor the past four years, we have gathered insights from students in Year 5 to Year 13 in the ‘Undivided Student Survey’ which asks pupils about their views on the school in six distinct areas:\n\n‘Me’ – about belonging, respect around the culture, faith and background of the pupil;\n\n2. ‘My peers’ – about belonging to peer groups and having someone to spend time with;\n\n3. Teachers and staff – positive role models, approaching teachers for help, adapting lessons to pupils with different learning styles;\n\n4. ‘My school’ – equality of backgrounds and beliefs, value and opportunity for pupil voice and actions from pupil voice;\n\n5. Making a difference – supporting diversity and inclusion in the school community; 6. ‘Your experience’ – understanding of the personal impact of school’s culture and the student experience\n\nThis year’s survey was concluded this week (12 February), and we aimed to reach (or exceed) the 75% response rate of 2023’s survey. Last year’s results were heartening, and reflected the importance we, as a school, place on developing and maintaining an inclusive and equitable community, with pupil voice at its heart. The highest scoring questions in 2023 were,\n\n‘I feel accepted at my school’\n\n‘When I think about the students at my school, they come from a variety of backgrounds’\n\nI feel that my culture faith and background are respected in school’\n\n‘I feel that my culture, faith and beliefs are valued equally in my school’\n\n‘Pupils come up with creative ideas and solutions to problems’\n\nThis year’s results will be shared with us next month, and we look forward to hearing the outcomes. Every pupil at Northampton High has a voice and is heard; pupil voice is central to our pupils’ wellbeing and sense of belonging, and sits at the core of our school ethos, our practice and our actions.\n\nSources:\n\nETS Student Undivided Survey findings, 2023\n\nEvery Voice Matters, Confidence through competence, Imogen Barber, 6 February 2024\n\nWhat (actually) is Meaningful Pupil Voice?
