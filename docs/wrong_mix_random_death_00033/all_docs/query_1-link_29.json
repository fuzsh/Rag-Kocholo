        "text": "“Island Life”\n\nThis week we thought we should focus on the “Island Life” publication project. The deadline is the end of June so time to get down to some serious work! We had a really positive session last week with some great stuff produced and also some writing with real potential but which cried out for more work. So let’s keep this momentum going and produce the best writing on the theme of island life that we can.\n\nSpencer is off this week but when he comes back will be available for one to one discussions and support so let him know if you would like to have a chat about your work. For example, if you have an idea but are not sure if it is suitable. Rebecca is also offering support with things like getting writing typed up in a suitable format or other technical issues\n\nWriters from the group will have five pages for your contributions. If writing prose this is about 300 words to the page. This could be one longer piece or two or more shorter ones. Poetry can be one poem per page or longer poems could take more than one. Don’t worry though, everyone does not have to produce five poems or a 1500 word story, these are upper limits dictated by space.\n\nAlso, if you have some unpublished work that you think fits the bill you are welcome to submit it so long as it is your own work and has not been previously published.\n\nIsland Life is a working title and theme but it can be interpreted broadly. What would be great, though, is writing that highlights elements of life on the islands which is less often seen in print. See if you can bring something new to the complex and many stranded weave of life on Lewis and beyond\n\nSome advice from Peter Urpeth:\n\nThink about what you are going to write about on the theme of Island Life – it can be poetry, fiction, nonfiction – Put some one line ideas on paper in a list, think about them, try each and see how it goes.\n\nIf you’re stuck, write about your life here, the things that you like and dislike about it, how this place has changed you for better or worse Why you stayed, why you came here. What would you change about island life if you could? Write down two or three memories of living here. Return to them, add to them.\n\nAnd some prompts from Peter’s Exercises\n\nTen memories of silence. Ten colours of the island\n\nNote, this need not be ten, it might be one or six…\n\nWrite a letter to a place in the islands that mattered to you. Write as though this place was a person, be honest, frank open.\n\nWrite a farewell letter to a place you loved.\n\nTell me about a body of water – be specific – can be a cup of tea or the Atlantic ocean\n\nTell me about a favourite café, coffee shop or restaurant\n\nGo for a slow walk – this isn’t about exercise – go somewhere familiar you see almost every day. Tell me what you didn’t see.\n\nHow and/or when do you feel invisible?\n\nWhere did your family come from, when?\n\nTell me about arriving, or tell me about leaving – that time you can’t forget.\n\nNorman MacCaig in Scalpay\n\nWe have looked at Norman MacCaig before, focusing on the poems that he is perhaps best known for which celebrate his love of Assynt. But more recently I came across a duet of poems about his Outer Hebridean relatives which I really liked and thought might interest our writers.\n\nAunt Julia\n\nAunt Julia spoke Gaelic\n\nvery loud and very fast.\n\nI could not answer her —\n\nI could not understand her.\n\nShe wore men’s boots\n\nwhen she wore any.\n\n— I can see her strong foot,\n\nstained with peat,\n\npaddling with the treadle of the spinningwheel\n\nwhile her right hand drew yarn\n\nmarvellously out of the air.\n\nHers was the only house\n\nwhere I’ve lain at night\n\nin the absolute darkness\n\nof a box bed, listening to\n\ncrickets being friendly.\n\nShe was buckets\n\nand water flouncing into them.\n\nShe was winds pouring wetly\n\nround house-ends.\n\nShe was brown eggs, black skirts\n\nand a keeper of threepennybits\n\nin a teapot.\n\nAunt Julia spoke Gaelic\n\nvery loud and very fast.\n\nBy the time I had learned\n\na little, she lay\n\nsilenced in the absolute black\n\nof a sandy grave\n\nat Luskentyre. But I hear her still, welcoming me\n\nwith a seagull’s voice\n\nacross a hundred yards\n\nof peatscrapes and lazybeds\n\nand getting angry, getting angry\n\nwith so many questions\n\nunanswered.\n\nAnna Gibson on ‘Aunt Julia’ (https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/aunt-julia/)\n\n‘The poem that I have selected is MacCaig’s ‘Aunt Julia’, which reflects upon his relationship with his Gaelic-speaking aunt on the Isle of Harris.\n\nNorman MacCaig was born in Edinburgh on the 14th November 1910, and divided the rest of his life between Edinburgh and Assynt, an area just north of Ullapool. He read classics at the University of Edinburgh, and was appointed a fellowship in creative writing at the same university in 1967. In 1970 he became a reader in poetry at the University of Stirling. Norman MacCaig had deep familial links to the Isle of Harris in the Outer Hebrides which is where his mother was from. Like his Aunt (and unlike MacCaig) she could also speak Gaelic.’\n\nUncle Roderick\n\nHis drifter swung in the night\n\nfrom a mile of nets\n\nbetween the Shiants and Harris.\n\nMy boy’s eyes watched\n\nthe lights of the fishing fleet – fireflies\n\non the green field of the sea.\n\nIn the foc’sle he gave me a bowl\n\nof tea, black, strong and bitter,\n\nand a biscuit you hammered\n\nin bits like a plate.\n\nThe fiery curtain came up\n\nfrom the blackness, comma’d with corpses.\n\nRound Rhu nan Cuideagan\n\nhe steered for home, a boy’s god\n\nin seaboots he dropped\n\nhis oilskins where he stood.\n\nHe was strong as the red bull.\n\nHe moved like a dancer.\n\nHe was a cran of songs.\n\nBasking Shark\n\nTo stub an oar on a rock where none should be,\n\nTo have it rise with a slounge out of the sea\n\nIs a thing that happened once (too often) to me.\n\nBut not too often – though enough. I count as gain\n\nThat once I met, on a sea tin-tacked with rain,\n\nThat roomsized monster with a matchbox brain.\n\nHe displaced more than water. He shoggled me\n\nCenturies back – this decadent townee\n\nShook on a wrong branch of his family tree.\n\nSwish up the dirt and, when it settles, a spring\n\nIs all the clearer. I saw me, in one fling,\n\nEmerging from the slime of everything.\n\nSo who’s the monster? The thought made me grow pale\n\nFor twenty seconds while, sail after sail,\n\nThe tall fin slid away and then the tail.\n\nDetective Fiction\n\nWhile we were discussing the most sold and published books last week we noticed that one book that crashed a top ten dominated by fantasy was an Agatha Christie title.\n\nDetective stories are huge business, not just in the book world. A very select few fantasy authors sell huge amounts but far more detective fiction writers make a living and far, far more detective stories get adapted for TV. There a currently few to no fantasy series on Freeview (there were a few dying offspring of Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings on pay for view channels, don’t know if there still are). But detectives dominate the airwaves: at any one time you can see Hercule Poirot, Vera, DCI Banks, those detectives in Shetland, that one from Murder in Paradise in Cornwall, Midsomer Murders is still going strong although that part of the countryside must be pretty thinly populated these days, there is a new Rebus on the way and there have been at least four Maigrets on recently (Bruno Cremer, Rupert Davis, Michael Gambon and Rowan Atkinson)…\n\nAs I mentioned last week, it is not a genre I like, so the few I watch (Maigret, Inspector Montalbano) and the even fewer I read (Raymond Chandler) tend to be those where the whodunnit factor is overshadowed by other things, character in the case of Maigret, utterly brilliant writing in the case of Chandler. Sunny views of Sicily for Montalbano.\n\nBut I have lots of respect for what has become an abidingly popular genre. So, where did it come from?\n\nAs always with these questions there are lots of competing candidates,. As usual with these questions the answer is that like most good things: the seaside, scrabble, baseball, the free-indirect narrative voice… it was invented by Jane Austen.\n\nWell, OK, maybe not invented. The first detective stories actually precede Austen, coming in One thousand and one nights. (complex to date but first translated into English in the early 1700s. contains several of the earliest detective stories, anticipating modern detective fiction.\n\n‘The oldest known example of a detective story was “The Three Apples”, one of the tales narrated by Scheherazade in the One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights). In this story, a fisherman discovers a heavy, locked chest along the Tigris river, which he then sells to the Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid. When Harun breaks open the chest, he discovers the body of a young woman who has been cut into pieces. Harun then orders his vizier, Ja’far ibn Yahya, to solve the crime and to find the murderer within three days, or be executed if he fails in his assignment. Suspense is generated through multiple plot twists that occur as the story progressed. With these characteristics this may be considered an archetype for detective fiction. It anticipates the use of reverse chronology in modern detective fiction, where the story begins with a crime before presenting a gradual reconstruction of the past.’ Wikipedia\n\nThe first modern detective story is generally agreed to be Edgar Allen Poe’s, The Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841) This story has a recognisable detective, the eccentric and brilliant C. Auguste Dupin, and in many ways set the template for detective fiction to follow. Wilkie Collins developed the idea Arthur Conan Doyle took this ball and ran with it adding texture from his experiences of working for brilliant surgeon, Joseph Bell in Edinburgh. While Sherlock Holmes is often thought of as the foundation of detective fiction Conan Doyle gave full credit to Poe saying: “Each [of Poe’s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed … Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?”\n\nSo far the story has not covered women writers but that is for reasons of space not because women were not writing them. Louisa May Alcott of Little Women fame published a detective thriller, V.V., or Plots and Counterplots in 1865 which had parody of The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\n\nBut women really came to prominence, indeed predominance, in the 20th century “Golden Age” of detective fiction (20s and 30s) with Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Josephine Tey, Margery Allingham, and Ngaio Marsh. And although there are plenty of successful male writers in the genre women have dominated ever since with names like PD James and Ruth Rendell to the fore. More recently Scottish detective fiction writers have become prominent with writers such as Val MacDiarmid, Ian Rankin, Louise Welsh and Denise Mina.\n\nI realise that this is a very brief scamper through the subject with a tendency to be little more than lists of names but that is because it is such a huge genre with multiple subgenres and has been so popular, in books, films TV and plays (Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap has been running in St Martin’s Theatre since 1952 with only a pause for covid lockdowns).\n\nSo I think we need fans of detective fiction to tell us about why they enjoy it and who their favourite writers are and why?\n\nBest Selling Fantasy\n\nIt recently occurred to me to wonder what the best selling/most published books of all time were.\n\nAs usual with lists, the various and in some cases innumerable sources of the internet don’t entirely agree, but this list from James Clear is fairly representative, except that they omit religious books like The Bible and Quran and The Thoughts of Chairman Mao. This is not because they doubt that these works are amongst the very highest sellers but because such vast numbers of them are printed and given away that any realistic estimate of how many are read is impossible. The other thing that is not usual is the putting of Don Quixote in first place. Those caveats aside, here is his top ten:\n\n#1 – Don Quixote (500 million copies sold) by Miguel de Cervantes\n\n#2 – A Tale of Two Cities (200 million copies sold) by Charles Dickens\n\n#3 – The Lord of the Rings (150 million copies sold) by J.R.R. Tolkien\n\n#4 – The Little Prince (142 million copies sold) by Antoine de Saint-Exupery\n\n#5 – Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (107 million copies sold) by J.K. Rowling\n\n#6 – And Then There Were None (100 million copies sold) by Agatha Christie\n\n#7 – The Dream of the Red Chamber (100 million copies sold) by Cao Xueqin\n\n#8 – The Hobbit (100 million copies sold) by J.R.R. Tolkien\n\n#9 – She: A History of Adventure (100 million copies sold) by H. Rider Haggard\n\n#10 – The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (85 million copies sold) by C.S. Lewis\n\nThe thing that strikes me most is the dominance of Fantasy. This seems amazing to me because I was a devotee in my teens and, in the early seventies, it was an almost moribund genre. The Lord of the Rings had undergone a revival of popularity with the hippy/alternative society and the Narnia books, like The Hobbit, were insulated from the sneers of the literati by being children’s literature as well as fantasy, but as to the rest…\n\nActually, I think I might struggle to convince you younger people quite how thin on the ground it was because, looking at this list, it seems so incredible. Outside of children’s books and LOTR there was very little in publication. Mervyn Peake’s Gormenghast trilogy and Michael Moorcock’s single handed revival of the Sword and Sorcery sub-genre were pretty much it. And Moorcock knew and was mentored by Peake and Tolkien and Lewis were friends and fellow members of The Inklings at Oxford.\n\nhttps://catch23writinggroup.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4setnc15bt781.webp\n\nThis proved to be the nadir, however because Ballantyne Books, under the editorship of Lin Carter began republishing old fantasy novels that had gone out of print. These early fantasy books, dating from the late 19th and early 20th Century were extremely varied . E.R. Eddison’s The Worm Ouroboros (1922) was not much like Jurgen (1919) by James Branch Cabell and neither were very similar to Hope M[rrlees Lud-in-th-Mist. (1926) Quite different again were Robert E Howard’s Conan the Barbarian stories of the thirties.\n\nThese, along with other Howard characters were the original Sword and Sorcery stories, the subgenre that Michael Moorcock was reviving with books like The Mad God’s Amulet.\n\nHoward had not gone out of fashion so completely as writers like Branch Cabell and Lord Dunsany, perhaps because he had published mostly in pulp fiction magazines. Many of the early fantasy writers were pretty Highbrow (one was William Morris of Art and Crafts movement fame and Hope Mirrlees was a friend of Virginia Woolf and T.S Eliot and a pioneer of modernist poetry). Fantasy had stopped being popular but pulp endured through the fifties and sixties with hard boiled crime and increasingly popular science fiction.\n\nAnd then there were comics. Comics had used stories with fantasy elements like Tarzan, and of course, superheroes are not exactly realist stories, but in 1970 Marvel comics licensed Conan and created Conan the Barbarian.\n\nAlthough I read many of the early fantasy books I came to Conan mostly through the comics. There was a UK larger format black and white edition which is what I remember most.\n\nIt is easy to sneer at Conan, the preposterously muscled super warrior but this would be to underestimate the stories which thunder along with verve and wit. While Tolkien plundered Nordic and Celtic mythology, Howard pioneered the technique of stealing from history (and pre-history) to flesh out his fantasy world and make it richer and more interesting. As far as I am aware, no one did this to a comparable degree until George R R Martin’s Game of Thrones (1996) but while Martin mostly draws from Wars of the Roses England to enrich his fantasy world, Howard plundered ancient history from everywhere. Some of the locations can be identified readily enough, Khitai is clearly based on China for example, others like Conan’s native Cimmeria, are much less well known.\n\nAnyway, perhaps a bit dated and much more Pulp Fiction oriented than most early fantasy work they are still fun if you fancy a bit of blood and thunder adventure, by Crom!\n\nPeter Urpeth\n\nOn Friday April 19th Peter Urpeth took a very well attended group. Peter made use of his “singing bowl” and exercises derived from Natalie Goldberg’s influential book, Writing Down the Bones (https://nataliegoldberg.com/books/writing-down-the-bones/) to guide our writers through Zen inspired, meditative writing practice, which was much appreciated and enjoyed by all.\n\nHaving been off on Annual Leave I have missed a couple of week’s blog updates and last week Peter did another session for the publication project, so I will just add our writers’ contributions under this post and hope to get back into the swing properly next week! Spencer\n\nMemoirs\n\nRather a short blogpost this week as, last Friday, we used an article from the website of the Scottish Book Trust on memoir writing by Lynsey May which has practical suggestions. I will put a brief extract from the piece and a link to the whole article on the Scottish Book Club website.\n\nMemoir: As short memoir pieces are one of the options for our proposed “Island Life” publication, I thought we might take a look at an article on the subject from the Scottish Book Trust website.\n\nHow to start writing memoir\n\nIf you’ve always wanted to try your hand at writing memoir, give our guide to getting started a go\n\nEveryone has a story to tell. From massive life events to small, quiet moments that might make someone else smile or sigh, you’re sure to have a whole treasure trove of material right there for the taking – so how do you get those memories and experiences down on the page? Discover advice for how to write a memoir, even if you’ve never tried before. https://www.scottishbooktrust.com/articles/how-to-start-writing-memoir\n\nSo what exactly is a memoir? Obviously, it is writing about stuff that actually happened, generally that actually happened to the writer. On the one hand it blurs into autobiography, on the other, into autobiographical fiction. If it is based on actual events, does that mean the writer has an obligation to be as accurate as possible?\n\nI am going to say no to that, though the question is certainly up for discussion. I think the obligation, at least for the sort of memoir we are considering for the book, is to write as good a story as possible.\n\nMany memoirs have elements of invention. Dialogue, for example, can be great for making the story flow and enriching characters, but who can remember exactly who said what to whom in a conversation twenty years (or even twenty days) ago? This is not a new issue. Thucydides (c460-c400 BCE) made strong claims of accuracy for his History of the Peloponnesian War which includes the famous “Melian Dialogue. “ Thucydides was not present at this debate and this is generally regarded as a dramatisation.\n\nSome writers have got flack for this. Polish journalist, Ryzard Kapucsinski and British author Bruce Chatwin have both been criticised for making stuff up in books that seem to give the impression of being non-fiction. https://www.ft.com/content/c6b7231e-9880-4e37-b2b1-98ea9ca38fe2\n\nMarcel Proust, on the other hand, is understood to have woven fictional and non fictional elements together in In Search of Lost Time and the same goes for Jack Kerouac’s, On the Road.https://donostiabookclub.blogspot.com/2017/06/jack-kerouacs-on-road-fiction-or.html\n\nJM Coetzee blends the real and the fictional in most unusual ways, for example, his Summertime seems to be about him, but is from the point of view of a fictional biographer and various people who knew him, being written after his death. https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/06/jm-coetzee-summertime\n\nCoetzee plays with veracity and the boundary between fiction and memoir in new and inventive ways, but that boundary has always been extremely porous. Which is why I say that, with the caveat that we need to be careful with depictions of real and identifiable people, the important thing is good storytelling rather than accuracy.\n\nIan Stephen and Liz Lochhead\n\nThe Writers Group ended March with a Scottish poetry emphasis. I was on leave for the week of the 22nd so missed Ian Stephen’s session but the feedback from our writers was very positive and it generated lots of excellent work, so thanks again, Ian.\n\nOn the 29th we took a long overdue look at the work of ex Scottish Makar, Liz Lochhead.\n\n“For 25 years, Lochhead has been the distinctive female voice of Scotland. Gallus, inquisitive, accusing and playful. Angry and tender by turns’ – this description is of limited truth. Her voice is not always that of a woman, or always that of a Scot. Following her friend Edwin Morgan, first as Poet Laureate of Glasgow (2005) and then as Scots Makar (2011-16), she strove to be confined by neither her gender nor her nationality,” (The Scotsman, quoted by the Scottish Poetry Library) https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poet/liz-lochhead/\n\nWe focussed on her vivid and poignant poem, Favourite Place, which evokes a familiar and much loved journey through the Highlands to her caravan near Mallaig. But it was written three months after the death of her beloved husband, Tom Logan and her grief transforms the poem from joyous to devastating.\n\n‘While she never intended writing about her grief, she was asked by the Scottish Book Trust to pen a poem about her favourite place.\n\n“I decided to write the truth about my real favourite place – Tom’s and I’s caravan. A lot of people say the poem Favourite Place makes them cry.\n\n“I do not write things to make people cry, I try to write the truth. I much more often make people laugh.\n\n“I probably wouldn’t have persevered if it hadn’t been my job. But I am pleased that poem has meant a lot to a lot of people because they experienced the same thing.”’ https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/liz-lochhead/\n\nYou can read it and listen to Liz reading it by following this link: https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/favourite-place/\n\nWomen of the Hebrides\n\nFriday 8th March was International Women’s’ Day and so a perfect opportunity to launch Women of the Hebrides, a celebration of the achievements of Hebridean women by Dr Joni Buchanan and published by Acair.\n\nWe weren’t able to get hold of a copy until Friday morning so we are a bit limited as to what we can say about it other than it looks very interesting. However, Joni Buchanan has previously written a scholarly book about the Lewis land struggles of the early 20th Century.\n\n“The Isle of Lewis, to the present day, retains a substantial rural population for one reason above all others. It is that, at crucial points in the island’s history, its people were prepared to resist the power of landlordism and insist on the right to remain on the land which they occupied.\n\n“The book is unashamedly from the crofters’ point of view. The alternative to resistance would have been even greater emigration, even larger tracts of land under under the unproductive ownership of a few individuals and even greater weakening of the Gaelic language and culture. The heroes – Na Gaisgeach – who resisted all of that deserve to be remembered and honoured”\n\nThis is an excerpt from a larger piece published in the Herald:\n\nTHE years after the First World War produced in Lewis the classic conflict in which the mighty Lord Leverhulme and his plans for industrialisation were pitted against the quite different aspirations of crofters. History has generally been written from the vantage point of Leverhulme and those men of commerce who supported his plans.\n\nThis treatment of events has scarcely done justice to the courage or vision of his crofter adversaries, to the historical circumstances which underlay their determination, or to the arrogant intransigence of Leverhulme who was deeply committed to the destruction of crofting tenure throughout the island of Lewis. https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12039355.joni-buchanan-in-an-extract-from-her-book-examines-the-bitter-battle-over-crofters-rights-to-their-lands-raiders-of-the-lost-land/\n\nThere is also a video story on the An Lanntair site where Joni Buchanan tells the story of a remarkable Uig woman, Christina Mackay, who was responsible for the rescue of the crew of a Danish boat wrecked at Mangersta.\n\nIan Stephen at the Library and at the Writers Group\n\nLocal storyteller, poet and novelist Ian Stephen is in conversation with John Randall at the Stornoway Library on Tuesday 19th of March\n\nAnd don’t forget that Ian will be taking the Writers Group on Friday 22nd.\n\nIan is also going to be taking the Writing Group on Friday 22nd of March, with the focus on an inherited oral story, not to be missed (12.30 at Catch 23)\n\nhttps://www.ianstephen.co.uk/index.html\n\nBilly Collins\n\nBilly Collins (b 1941, New York) is a popular and critically acclaimed American poet who was the US Poet Laureate from 2001 to 2003. He is very rare in being a serious poet whose work is infused with humour.\n\nFrom an interview by George Plimpton in the Paris Review (2001):\n\n‘His last three collections of poems have broken sales records for poetry. A well-known voice on National Public Radio, his public readings, perhaps better described as performances, are invariably put on before packed audiences.\n\nHis work is identified largely by its humor, which he speaks of as being “a door into the serious”—a comment echoed by John Updike’s sentiment: “Billy Collins writes lovely poems . . . limpid, gently startling, more serious than they seem, they describe all the worlds that are and were and some others besides.”’\n\nhttps://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/482/the-art-of-poetry-no-83-billy-collins\n\nHis most recently published collection is Musical Tables, which consists of over 125 short poems.\n\nBilly Collins has long been free with advice so here is a little: “”When I was a younger poet I would do what Frost said you can’t do, which is fret a poem into being … and I gave up on that a long time ago. If a poem isn’t working, if it doesn’t feel right, I just let it go and get on with the next thing, which could be writing another poem or making more toast.” National Public Radio\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2016/12/14/504716937/billy-collins-on-how-to-become-a-poet-and-why-poetry-can-be-a-game\n\nCherry Blossom and Haikus\n\nWe are fast approaching early Spring which has especial importance in Japan as cherry blossom time.\n\nErina Takeda of the Smithsonian Institution explains:\n\n‘Cherry blossoms are a symbolic flower of the spring, a time of renewal, and the fleeting nature of life. Their life is very short. After their beauty peaks around two weeks, the blossoms start to fall.\n\nDuring this season in Japan, people like to have cherry blossom parties with colleagues, friends, and family. A cherry blossom makes people merry. They enjoy eating, drinking, and barbecuing underneath the cherry blossoms. We call this custom hanami. Hanami literally means “watching blossoms,” and the tradition can be traced back at least a thousand years. We bring cooked meals, alcohol, snacks, and sweets, like a potluck party. Schools and offices hold welcome parties during hanami, a chance for people to bond and meet new friends.\n\nEven at night, viewing spots are crowded with people enjoying the blossoms in a beautiful, romantic atmosphere. Couples go at night to enjoy the special mood created by cherry blossoms. Hanami at night is called yozakura.’ https://festival.si.edu/blog/2014/significance-of-sakura-cherry-blossom-traditions-in-japan/\n\nHaikus\n\nWe have looked at haikus before but we thought we would have a recap to encourage writers to have a go at cherry blossom and Spring related poems.\n\nThe rules as normally stated for a haiku are that it should consist of 17 syllables in the order:\n\nThe Poetry Foundation describes it thus:\n\n‘A Japanese verse form most often composed, in English versions, of three unrhymed lines of five, seven, and five syllables. A haiku often features an image, or a pair of images, meant to depict the essence of a specific moment in time. ’ https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/haiku-or-hokku\n\nHowever, this strict arrangement does not have to be followed. Japanese differs from English in ways that make exact equivalence misleading:\n\n‘Despite its formal history, the haiku’s composition has expanded somewhat over time. This is due in part to the differences between the Japanese language and Western languages. In its original Japanese form, the haiku is often divided into 17 mora (a Japanese unit of syllable weight) and arranged in a single vertical line. However, in English there is no exact equivalent to the mora unit. As a result, in English and other languages, haikus are most frequently adapted into three lines of verse, usually unrhymed, composed of five, seven, and five syllables, adding up to seventeen syllables total. However, many American poets, such as Jack Kerouac, began to gradually depart from this traditional syllable and line count, in favor of depicting images as succinctly as possible.’ https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/haiku-or-hokku\n\nSo if you would like to keep to the strict: five, seven, five formula then do so. It can be interesting and fruitful to confine your writing to rigid forms. But, if you prefer to simply depict images or feelings succinctly and not worry too much about the syllable count and arrangement, that is perfectly OK too.\n\nHere is a Sakura haiku by Matsuo Bashō, (1644 –1694) the most famous haiku writer and the person who popularised them as a stand-alone form.\n\n(hana ni yoeri / haori kite katana / sasu onna)\n\ndrunk by cherry blossoms\n\na lady wearing a haori coat\n\nand a sword\n\n(Translation by Gabi Greve)\n\n‘This haiku seems to depict the freedom, fun and sometimes mayhem that occurs during the short but sweet cherry blossom season. Boozy hanami picnics are an old tradition and this haiku is believed to refer to cherry blossom viewing in Ueno Park in the early Edo Period. At that time, women didn’t wear haori coats, nor did they use swords. It follows that this scene encapsulated in a haiku is there to show that anything is possible when the cherry blossoms bloom. Whether a drunk lady was cosplaying or bravely wearing what she always wanted to wear, we will never know.’ https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/cherry-blossom-haiku/\n\nI should point out that Nick thought this interpretation was incorrect and the writer had misinterpreted drunk by cherry blossoms to mean “in the presence of cherry blossoms, the lady was drunk” while he thought the haiku meant that it was the overwhelming sensation of the cherry blossom that had made her drunk. The translation certainly allows the line to be read either way.\n\nThe Ten (Eleven) Best Books of the Century So Far\n\nListicle is a word for an article which mostly consists of a list. Often these are also ratings: The top ten air fryers, or 100 best poems about mice. Listicles are particularly popular on newspaper, magazine or blog sites with comments below as the literary and artistic ones never fail to provoke the wrath of the readers and stir up a debate: “I can’t believe you left out William McGonagall from the five best Scottish poets list…” etc\n\nThere is another reason that they are so popular which is that some journalists are lazy sods and if you Google “Top ten Christmas songs,” say, you will see the same songs pop up again and again. OK there are a limited number of Christmas songs and far fewer that are perennially popular, but when you see the same songs, films, novels etc coming up again and again in the same order then you know that a spot of listicle larceny has been going on.\n\nSpeaking of which, I have nicked the following list of the best books of the twenty first century from The Greatest Books Website https://thegreatestbooks.org/authors/6822I&nbsp; Or possibly from the Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/best-books-of-the-21st-century\n\nAlthough I have not read all of these authors, I have read some and, given that this is subjective and not really possible to rank, this seems like a fair selection. By which I mean, of course, that it accords fairly well with my own taste. The text from the article is in quotation marks…\n\n1 Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel “The novel is a historical fiction set in the 1500s, during the reign of King Henry VIII. The story is told from the perspective of Thomas Cromwell, a man of humble beginnings who rises to become the King’s chief minister.”\n\nThough I would not put it at the top this, the first of a trilogy, is very good. I just ground to a halt on the last one which, apart from being huger even than the first two has the problem of… history.\n\n2 Gilead by Marilynne Robinson “… a series of reflections written by an elderly dying pastor in 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, as a letter to his young son. The protagonist, John Ames, shares his family history, personal thoughts, and the struggles of his life, including the tension with his namesake and godson who returns to their small town. The book explores themes of faith, regret, and the beauty of existence, providing a profound meditation on life and death.”\n\nRobinson has had a strange career. Her first novel Housekeeping came out in 1980 to great acclaim but then she did not publish any fiction until Gilead in 2004 this was followed by Home, followed by Lila and Jack in fairly quick succession. I have only read the first two so far but they seem to tell the same, or at least overlapping stories from different viewpoints. It is extremely subtle and beautiful writing that needs close attention, not because it is difficult to read, it is not, but because it is easy to miss subtle points and, perhaps, misinterpret what is happening. It is as good a demonstration of unreliable narrators as you will find.\n\n3. Secondhand Time, The Last of the Soviets, by Svetlana Alexievich “is a compilation of personal narratives from individuals who lived through the transformation of the Soviet Union to modern Russia.”\n\n4. Never Let Me Go, by Kazuo Ishiguro “The haunting tale of three friends, who grow up together at a seemingly idyllic English boarding school.”\n\n5 Austerlitz by W. G. Sebald “The novel follows the story of Jacques Austerlitz, an architectural historian who was brought to England on a Kindertransport from Czechoslovakia during World War II.”\n\n6 The Amber Spyglass by Philip Pullman “The final instalment in a fantasy trilogy, this novel follows the young protagonists as they continue their journey through parallel universes.”\n\n7 Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates “The book is a profound work that explores the concept of race in America through the lens of the author’s personal experiences.”\n\n8 Autumn by Ali Smith ” is a post-Brexit novel revolving around the deep and complex friendship between an old man, Daniel, and a young woman, Elisabeth..”\n\nI have yet to read anything by Scottish writer, Ali Smith but she is jostling with at the top of my “to read” list with Margaret Atwood. I hear good things, has anyone read her?\n\n9 Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell “This novel is a unique blend of six different stories, each set in a different time and place, spanning from the 19th century South Pacific to a post-apocalyptic future”\n\n10 Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie “The novel is set in Nigeria during the Biafran War, exploring the impact of the conflict on the lives of its characters.”\n\n11 My Brilliant Friend by Elena Ferrante “This novel tells the story of two friends, Elena and Lila, growing up in a poor neighborhood in Naples, Italy in the 1950s. Their intense, complicated friendship is marked by competition, mutual respect, and deep affection. As they navigate the challenges of adolescence, including family drama, academic struggles, and romantic entanglements, their bond is tested and transformed. The narrative explores themes of female friendship, social class, education, and the struggle for personal autonomy in a patriarchal society.”\n\nI was going to just look at the top ten (of 100) but could not leave out Elena Ferrante who was my big discovery for 2023. We talked about the mysterious Ferrante who completely shuns fame and writes under a pen name recently.\n\nSomething notable about this list is that the top four and seven out of the eleven are written by women. This might indicate an agenda on the part of the writer but, from what I have read of these (four of the women and two of the men) it seems a justified selection.\n\nI would have put Susannah Clarke on the list, though I am not sure who I would bump off to make way for her.\n\nHow about you? What are your favourite books of this millennium so far? They don’t have to be novels, poetry and non-fiction count too.\n\nThe Shipping Forecast\n\nIs the Shipping Forecast literature? I know I often start these handouts asking if something is literature or not, but it seems to be a particularly interesting question in this case. We will come back to that. At any rate it seems to me that it is unarguable that it is writing and that thus there might be something we can learn from it. And it is certainly the case that it has inspired literature, from poetry to parody.\n\nThe Shipping Forecast began in 1867. Following a disastrous storm Robert Fitzroy, founder of the fledgling Meteorological Office, began issuing regular storm warnings (originally signalled by displays of drums and cones at principal ports that could be seen by shipping). This was the first regular weather forecast in the world. It developed and improved over time, and transferred to radio in 1924.\n\nOne of the things that makes the Shipping Forecast unique is the brevity and precision of its language. Ernest Hemingway is often cited as the exemplar of concision in prose writing. He learned his trade in newspapers and made a virtue out of making his reader read between the lines. But he was not the first to put a high value on minimalism. One of the many things that is rarely noticed or appreciated about Jane Austen is the lack of descriptive prose in her books. The fact that her work has been adapted so frequently obscures the fact that most of her characters are barely described physically at all.\n\nCompared to the Shipping Forecast, however, both Hemingway and Austen seem verbose. Even haikus, surely the most compressed and concise form of poetry, need to use a certain number of syllables to conform to the form. The Shipping Forecast never wastes a word.\n\nOK, you say, but that is because it is not literary language but scientific, albeit scientific (meteorological) information aimed at non-expert sailors as well as professional skippers. But scientific papers are never as compressed and can be very wordy indeed.\n\nThere is, of course, no mystery about this. Novels and scientific papers have no need to be this brief and, fiction and poetry may actively wish to avoid being too precise to allow for complex and opaque meaning. The Shipping Forecast is designed to convey important, often life or death, information in conditions that may be far from ideal. The skipper of a trawler in a roaring gale may have trouble hearing the important information. The yacht radio batteries might be giving out. The Shipping Forecast covers a huge area and even in its super-concise form takes several minutes.\n\nThis concision is achieved in various ways. Firstly, the usual context is stripped out because, if you know the format of the forecast, you don’t need to be told that “moderate or good” refers to visibility or that “fair” describes weather. To take an example from last Saturday:\n\nRockall, Malin, Hebrides, Bailey:\n\nWest or South-West five to seven, occasionally Gale 8\n\nSqually showers, rain later\n\nGood, occasionally moderate\n\nOn the BBC Website it said “Gale Warning!” but the radio forecast omits this. It tells you that the wind speed is going to be “occasionally Gale 8” so it is redundant, and there is no room for such fripperies.\n\nAnother difference is that on the website, Rockall, Malin, Hebrides and Bailey each have their own little forecast, but as they are the same for these adjoining sea areas, they are put together on the radio, avoiding repetition.\n\nAdjectives are a large part of the forecast but they are not used in their usual way. Words like “poor” “good,” “fair,” “moderate” are usually vague and often involve value judgements. But in the Shipping Forecast these words are honed to precise meanings, and of course, involve no subjective judgements at all. For example “Poor” means “Visibility between 1,000 metres and 2 nautical miles. “Later” that vaguest of temporal terms in ordinary usage means “Expected more than 12 hours from time of issue.”\n\nThese precise, objective values for each term helps with the brevity of the forecast. You don’t need to modify them (“Rather quickly” means a pressure system is moving at 15 to 20 knots so is really a precise term in itself, rather than a modified “quickly”).\n\nSo the language is used significantly differently from the way these terms are normally employed. But on the other hand they do retain some of their more day to day meaning. You don’t need to know the precise Met Office meaning of “very poor” to be warned that visibility is going to be dodgy and that it might be an idea to put off your first voyage through the Sound of Harris until the mist has lifted.\n\nWhat makes the Shipping Forecast even more unique is that it is not anchored to this extreme functionality alone and is beloved and influential way beyond the practical needs of mariners.\n\n“We aren’t trawlermen; we don’t need this information, so why don’t we switch off? ‘Fair Isle, Faroes, South-East Iceland.’ There is something about the rhythm and accidental beauty of the words as they’re carefully intoned in the best formal BBC tradition – a weatherman’s haiku.”\n\n(Kate Green and Tim Richardson Countrylife https://www.countrylife.co.uk/out-and-about/theatre-film-music/150-years-of-the-shipping-forecast-164334 )\n\nAnd it has inspired poetry and lyrics, from Seamus Heaney’s The Shipping Forecast and Carol Anne Duffey’s Prayer to songs from Radiohead and Blur.\n\nBut is it poetry in itself? There is a tradition of “found poetry” but this is generally taken to mean re-ordering lines of existing writing such as articles. No cutting and pasting has gone on here. It is as it was intended to be. However, it is not only what it was intended to be. A transformation has occurred albeit not one of form, but one of meaning and purpose. The Shipping Forecast was never intended to be an aural comfort blanket for listeners in Northampton, nor an incantation conjuring visions of wild and remote seas and shores for the sleepless of Stirling.\n\nI think that the Shipping Forecast is literature, art as well as science. It is a strange and unusual sort of art though, on the one hand it is an accidental art form, created with no idea of artistic or literary merit. For another, it is an ongoing, ever changing, continuous piece. The form changes little over time but the weather never stops changing.\n\nAre there any other examples of very long term dynamic art? No doubt there are many but the only one that I can think of is Jem Finer’s Longplayer, which is a project to play a musical composition over 1000 years. Finer, founder member of the Pogues and co -writer of Fairy Tale of New York, launched this piece at the turn of this millennium and so far it has been playing for 24 years watched over by the Longplayer Trust.\n\nObviously, the differences to the Shipping Forecast are more apparent than the similarities. Longplayer is musical and wordless and is created as art rather than accidentally becoming so. Longplayer is unbroken while the forecast is episodic. However, both unfold variations of a limited number of basic elements over extremely long time periods. Longplayer is designed to so without repetition. I guess it is possible that the shipping forecast might repeat exactly the same words, in exactly the same order, but it seems unlikely.\n\nAnyway, it is the best I can do for a comparison. And there is one more link. Longplayer is located in Bow Creek Lighthouse at Trinity Buoy Wharfe on the Thames.\n\nIf the connection with Longplayer is a bit tenuous The Shipping Forecast has much more direct links to musicians, artists and writers including, of course, Stornoway poet and storyteller Ian Stephen.\n\n‘Ian Stephen served for 15 years in the Coastguard before becoming a full-time poetry, prose and drama writer in 1995.\n\nDuring his time in the Coastguard control room, he was inevitably an avid Shipping Forecast listener. This doubtlessly inspired one of his earlier poetry works, Malin, Hebrides, Minches, with photos by Sam Maynard (Dangaroo Press, Denmark, 1983). The book was named after the local sea area featured in the Shipping Forecast.’\n\nhttps://www.welovestornoway.com/index.php/articles/31930-shipping-forecast-celebrates-100-years-on-air\n\nPen Names\n\nPen names, nom de plumes, pseudonyms… writers have published under assumed names for centuries, and for a wide variety of reasons.\n\nIt is frequently asserted that women in the 19th Century had trouble getting published and so the Bronte sisters used the pseudonyms Currer, Acton and Ellis Bell, and Mary Evans published her work under the name George Eliot. But this is not really supported by evidence. Jane Austen, Fanny Burney and Maria Edgeworth were best selling authors earlier and Elizabeth Gaskell’s first novel was published a year after Jane Eyre. Austen did publish anonymously but under the name “A Lady” so it was clearly more a concern to be anonymous rather than a concern to disguise her gender.\n\nIn fact, according to Eleanor Dumbill:\n\n“Women dominated the literary marketplace as both readers and writers for the majority of the 19th century. Of the 15 most prolific authors of the period 11 were women, according to the At the Circulating Library. The need to project modern gender imbalances that exist in publishing today onto 19th-century authors is understandable but anachronistic.” https://www.literaturecambridge.co.uk/news/pseudonyms\n\nIt is true that the Bronte sisters were discouraged from writing by Robert Southey (then poet laureate) on account of their gender, so it may have been a consideration for them but: “Writers who opted to use pen names tended to choose ones that aligned with their own genders. In fact, in the 1860s and 70s men were more likely to use female pseudonyms than vice versa. William Clark Russell, for example, published several novels under the name Eliza Rhyl Davies.” (Eleanor Dumbill)\n\nThe identity of Mary Evans, who (unlike the reclusive Austen or remote Brontes) was active in the literary society of her day, was known by the time her second book was published and yet she continued to use the pen name George Eliot, seemingly preferring a distinct authorial identity.\n\nThe reasons for writing under a nom de plume are myriad. Sometimes it is of necessity. David Cornwell had to publish under an assumed name as he was still working for MI5 when he published Call for the Dead, the first novel by “John Le Le Carré ” and the service had strict rules. James Herriot came into being because James Alfred Wight was practicing as a vet and the rules of the Royal Vetinary Association then demanded a pseudonym be used to prevent advertising. As he was a retiring man who found the fame associated with All Creatures Great and Small a trial this was undoubtedly advantageous. And his clients didn’t care, he once said that: “If a farmer calls me with a sick animal, he couldn’t care less if I were George Bernard Shaw,”\n\nPolitics sometimes compels pen names too. Too big a subject to really get into here but a mention must go to Daniel Defoe who penned numerous pamphlets viewed as subversive and who used many pen names in an attempt to avoid prosecution. He was not entirely successful in this, spending time in Newgate Prison and having to endure the pillory. Defoe (or Foe as he was originally named ) must hold the record for nom de plumes. He is known to have employed 198 different pseudonyms!\n\nAnother reason for wanting to use a nom de plume is when writers want to be judged by their work, and not by their name. Sometimes this might be as a personal challenge. Stephen King published works under the name Bachman, partly because he wanted to release more books than the publisher thought one author should, but also because he wanted to see if his success was more due to luck than talent.\n\nJ.K. Rowling (who was first published as “J.K. rather than Joanne as she was advised that her target audience would be reluctant to read books written by a woman) published stories under the name Robert Galbraith after the massive success of Harry Potter. “Yes, I really wanted to go back to the beginning of a writing career in this new genre, to work without hype or expectation and to receive totally unvarnished feedback. I wanted it to be just about the writing.” https://robert-galbraith.com/about/\n\nThis idea is exemplified by Elena Ferrante. This best selling Italian author of My Brilliant Friend told her publishers right at the start that: “Once I knew that the completed book would make its way in the world without me, once I knew that nothing of the concrete, physical me would ever appear beside the volume—as if the book were a little dog and I were its master—it made me see something new about writing. I felt as though I had released the words from myself.”\n\nAs her success and fame grew, however, so did the speculation about who “Elena Ferrante” really was, resulting in intrusive investigative journalism and a philological study that ended up suggesting that Ferrante is a man. The is something she has categorically rejected: telling Vanity Fair in 2015 that questions about her gender are rooted in a presumed “weakness” of female writers.\n\nWhich brings us back to the gender issue. One of the most popular science fiction writers of the last century was James Tiptree Junior. This was understood to be a pen name and, though not on the same scale as Elena Ferrante, speculation was rife. Because many of Tiptree’s stories had a strong feminist element it was suggested that they might be a woman. Tiptree corresponded with feminist writers Joanna Russ and Ursula K. Le Guin as a feminist man, however and Robert Silverberg dismissed the idea out of hand. “It has been suggested that Tiptree is female, a theory that I find absurd, for there is to me something ineluctably masculine about Tiptree’s writing. I don’t think the novels of Jane Austen could have been written by a man nor the stories of Ernest Hemingway by a woman, and in the same way I believe the author of the James Tiptree stories is male.”\n\nYou can probably guess the rest. James Tiptree Junior turned out to be Alice Sheldon.\n\nTam o’ Shanter\n\nBurns night had rolled around once more. We have looked at various things Burnsy over the years, from his philosophic examinations of the minutiae of life in poems like To a Mouse and To a Louse, to the many versions of Auld Lang’s Syne in different languages. One thing we have never focussed on is his long narrative poem, Tam o’ Shanter. This is the tale of a bit of a waster, reluctant to ride home after a night drinking, who comes across a riotous witches celebration and nearly pays with his life.\n\n‘Tam o’ Shanter is a wonderful, epic poem in which Burns paints a vivid picture of the drinking classes in the old Scotch town of Ayr in the late 18th century. It is populated by several unforgettable characters including of course Tam himself, his bosom pal, Souter (Cobbler) Johnnie and his own long suffering wife Kate, “Gathering her brows like gathering storm, nursing her wrath to keep it warm”. We are also introduced to Kirkton Jean, the ghostly, “winsome wench”, Cutty Sark and let’s not forget his gallant horse, Maggie.\n\nThe tale includes humour, pathos, horror, social comment and in my opinion some of the most beautiful lines that Burns ever penned. For example, “But pleasures are like poppies spread, You seize the flower, its bloom is shed; Or like the snow falls in the river, A moment white–then melts for ever”.’ Alexandria Burns Club http://www.robertburns.org.uk/Assets/Poems_Songs/tamoshanter.htm\n\nSomething struck me when I was reading about this and the phrase “mock heroic” was used of it. It certainly is mock heroic. The story is one of close escape from deadly peril in the best heroic tradition but Tam is no Hercules or Galahad, rather, he is a bit of a drunken waster. The thought then occurred to me that there was something reminiscent in it of Steinbeck at his less serious: Cannery Row and, especially, Tortilla Flat in which a bunch of alcoholic Hispanic guys play out a sort of parody of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in Monterey, California.\n\nWell, I have found no evidence of a tip of the hat from Steinbeck to Tam o’ Shanter although he does seem to have admired the poet. And then I remembered that one of Steinbeck’s greatest novels is ‘Of Mice and Men’ which is of course from a line in To A Mouse: “The best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men Gang aft agley.” If he was keen enough on Burns to use his words for the title of one of his major works then it does seem entirely possible that Tam O Shanter ‘s mock heroic drunken stupidity might have inspired the mock heroic drunken stupidity of Danny in Tortilla Flat.\n\nYou heard it here first!\n\nTam O ‘Shanter\n\nby Robert Burns\n\nWhen chapman billies leave the street,\n\nAnd drouthy neebors neebors meet,\n\nAs market-days are wearing late,\n\nAnd folk begin to tak the gate;\n\nWhile we sit bousin, at the nappy,\n\nAnd gettin fou and unco happy,\n\nWe think na on the lang Scots miles,\n\nThe mosses, waters, slaps, and stiles,\n\nThat lie between us and our hame,\n\nWhare sits our sulky, sullen dame,\n\nGathering her brows like gathering storm,\n\nNursing her wrath to keep it warm.\n\nThis truth fand honest Tam o’ Shanter,\n\nAs he frae Ayr ae night did canter:\n\n(Auld Ayr, wham ne’er a town surpasses,\n\nFor honest men and bonie lasses.)\n\nO Tam!

How many is something that the many authorities of the internet fail to agree on. The thing that is most important, and that I want to emphasise, is that native English speakers use and understand these figures of speech all the time without the least need to know what the names for them are.\n\nI hope that it will be interesting and instructive to look at some of the figures of speech that are less well known than similes and metaphors, but it really doesn’t matter to your writing if you cannot remember the difference between litotes and oxymorons.\n\nHyperbole is exaggeration for the sake of emphasis. ‘I am freezing’ for when you are a bit cold.\n\nI used to live in a shared house and whenever I said, ‘I’m starving’ One of my housemates used to give me a lecture about how I wasn’t starving and that there were children in Africa… to which the only response was: ‘It’s hyperbole, Kathy, a perfectly legitimate figure of speech in English. I thought you were supposed to be a teacher!’\n\nPersonification is a figure of speech used a lot by writers. It is ascribing human feelings or characteristics to nonhuman things. ‘The wind howled mournfully.’ It is used a lot by writers. Although effective it is best used with care.\n\n‘I wandered lonely as a cloud…’ is, of course, a simile but it also employs personification.\n\nLitotes is… no hang on, I have forgotten again. I’ll have to go and check. Right! Litotes is using a negative to express a positive: ‘You’re not wrong.’\n\nOxymoron. An oxymoron is a contradiction in terms – though not a meaningless one. For example: ‘grow smaller.’ Some oxymorons are so familiar that we might not spot them ‘Climb down,’ ‘only choice,’ and even change from phrases into words: ‘Bittersweet.’\n\nMetonymy is when you refer to something by one of its attributes. Suits, for business people, for example, or The press, for newspapers.\n\nEuphemism is when you want to avoid saying something directly and substitute something less blunt. Euphemisms are thus abundant in descriptions of sexual acts ant toilet use. Actually ‘toilet’ is a euphemism itself, or at least started out as one. ‘Going to see a man about a dog’ or ‘to powder my nose.’ When we did this at school I proposed ‘falling down the stairs at the police station,’ which my teacher would not allow, although it was popular at the time as an explanation for why a defendant was so battered. I suppose it could be argued that it was less a euphemism than a lie.\n\nJanelle Monáe\n\nJanelle Monáe as Mary Jackson in the 2016 film Hidden Figures\n\nFigures of Speech is a bit of a dry subject so here is something more fun. I have a long term love of R&B (the modern sort not the pre-rock and roll rhythm and blues), from TLC through and Beyonce to Janelle Monáe . Is she R&B? Well, she doesn’t fit neatly into anyone’s boxes, and has described herself as a “funkstress” but there is a strand of that in her music. Beyonce is is too well known. The trouble with TLC and Monáe is that (apart from TLC’s blander hits like No Scrubs and Waterfalls) their songs tend to be sexually explicit with a great deal of swearing and routine use of the N word. Having given it some thought I would like to play Float by Janelle Monáe as I think it is a) great and b) not quite as rude as some of her stuff such as Pynk.\n\nIt does involve swearing and use of the N word though, so be warned\n\nAlasdair Gray\n\nSomething very strange is happening in Hollywood; the film Poor Things has started the award season by winning 2 Golden Globes. This is remarkable because of the bizarre fantasy premise of the film, which might be seen as a twisted version of Frankenstein, but more so because of all Scottish Writers, it is hard to think of one less naturally suited to mainstream Hollywood Success than Alasdair Gray, writer of the novel on which the film is based.\n\nAlasdair Gray (1934-2019) is, without doubt, one of the greatest of Scottish writers. He wrote novels, poetry and plays but was also a highly regarded artist, with a particular interest in murals. And he was very much a one off. His masterpiece and first novel, Lanark, has been compared to Kafka and Orwell, to which I would add Flan O’Brian’s The Third Policeman as one viable reading is that Lanark’s experiences in ‘Unthank’ and ‘The Institute’ are his Hell.\n\nYou can see why, the comparison with Kafka seems particularly apt, (Gray acknowledged him as an inspiration) and yet Lanark is very much an original.\n\nThe setting of Lanark flips between the seemingly semi-autobiographical story of a boy growing up in a real-life Glasgow and Lanark’s experiences in ‘Unthank’ a sort of dark (literally, it is never daylight) fantasy version of Glasgow which eventually is eaten by a ‘mouth in the earth.’ If that sounds strange it is not the half of it. There are acknowledgments of plagiarism in chapters that don’t exist. The epilogue is ‘too important to go at the end,’ etc. Really, it is a book that defies a neat summary. Like Gray himself, it is a one off.\n\nGray’s brilliance and the acclaim that he achieved in literary and artistic circles, did not translate to wealth or even mainstream success, which makes the furore about Poor Things bittersweet.\n\nIt is hard to know what he would have made of it. Gray was a committed socialist and nationalist. There has been some controversy about the fact that the story has been relocated from Glasgow to London. Given the importance of Glasgow in his work and his Scottish nationalism, it is hard to imagine that he would be delighted by that. The realistic Victorian setting has been changed to a steampunk fantasia amongst other changes. But I hope, at least, that he would be pleased that some elements of his startlingly original imagination have, at long last, gained a mass audience.\n\nHappy New Year 2024\n\nLately it occurs to me, what a long strange trip it’s been, sang the Grateful Dead, and that is how things feel to me this January. 2024? How the Hell did that happen?\n\nAnyway, just before Christmas, having dodged it for nearly four year, the dreaded Covid finally cornered me. This meant that I missed Magaidh Smith’s storytelling session which was disappointing. I don’t really have material for a post after being off sick, but I wanted to showcase this poem that Cathy Macleod sent in. It was really great to hear from Cathy and I look forward to reconnecting with everybody soon.\n\nI REBEL.\n\nAgainst all illegal wars\n\nAll wars.\n\nMass murders\n\nOf slaughter of innocents\n\nOf men, women and stiff little children.\n\nBlanket bombed with no warning.\n\nWhen moments before their grubby little fingers\n\nPlayed with daisies, fragile friendly flower chains caressing their necks.\n\nNow broken and bloodied\n\nAnd\n\nDead\n\nAgainst all this\n\nI rebel.\n\nAgainst austerity, measured out like slow but steady, freezing, seeping fog.\n\nBlaming the poor, the misplaced, the disabled, the addict and the voice hearers.\n\nWhile coiffing on champagne lunches and five course dinners, riding rough shod in their limousines over people who believe their taxes are keeping us afloat.\n\nWhen all the while it is not the money nor the vote\n\nIts bankers, law makers, life takers pushing the lie.\n\nHiding in their tax havens, watching us die.\n\nI do cry.\n\nYet Against all this\n\nI rebel.\n\nAgainst the looks and the whispers\n\nThe giggles and the titters\n\nAs I walk down the street\n\nAnd Mr Spence and Lizzie McKay\n\nAre dumbfounded by my apparent devil may cate appearance after the state I was in only last month.\n\nWhen I stood in the village square on the monument\n\nAnd screeched and preached like a banshee\n\nAgainst injustice\n\nWearing my torn red silk kaftan.\n\nBarefoot\n\nClutching a bunch of weeds in my fist\n\nRipped from the roadside\n\nBleeding.\n\nSpurred on by talks I’d had with Aldous and Jim\n\nOf a Brave New World where we had to Break On Through To The Other Side like Riders On The Storm.\n\nAnd of course, yet again, the police arrived.\n\nAlways polite, always in control\n\nThey take me\n\nBack in time and space\n\nTo hospital\n\nInto asylum\n\nTo the quiet of the lawn, the grace of the French windows, the cleanliness of the bed linen, the calm of the\n\nattic bedroom with the bluebell wallpaper.\n\nI am injected, I am dosed\n\nI am shot through the brain with electricity\n\nI do try\n\nYet against all this\n\nI rebel.\n\nI used to carve anarchy signs into antique wooden tables\n\nWhere the talk flowed and the beer spilled\n\nI used to march, united, to protest\n\nI used to go insane\n\nYet now here I am\n\nIn my own safe home\n\nOlder, wiser, happier, content.\n\nMany years down the line\n\nYet the war rages on\n\nThe poor are still scapegoats\n\nThe governments lie and kill indiscriminately\n\nThe children are still dying\n\nAnd the daisies are running out of space.\n\nAgainst it all\n\nI tried to stand\n\nBut I will not sacrifice my family, my friends or my life for that.\n\nAgainst that\n\nFor that\n\nI will always\n\nCalmly, quietly and constructively\n\nRebel. Xx\n\nCathy Macleod\n\nMargaret Atwood\n\nThis week we looked at the work of Canadian writer, Margaret Atwood. The handout looked at a couple of her poems but did not cover her novels as this was done in the group by Mike, who gave an excellent introduction to her fiction.\n\nMargaret Atwood was a very well known and successful writer before the 2017 TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale (1985) took her fame to another level. Although she will probably always be associated with dystopian fantasy, her writing is extremely wide ranging both in form and subject.\n\n“Since 1961, she has published eighteen books of poetry, eighteen novels, eleven books of non-fiction, nine collections of short fiction, eight children’s books, two graphic novels, and a number of small press editions of both poetry and fiction. “\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wikiMargaret_Atwood#Works\n\nShe first achieved acclaim as a poet and has since written: novels, short stories, non-fiction and children’s literature. She is one of only four writers to have won two Booker Prizes (for The Blind Assassin, 2000 and The Testaments, 2019).\n\n“Atwood was born in November 1939, just after the start of the second world war. Her upbringing was unconventional. Her father, Carl Edmund Atwood, was an entomologist, and her mother, Margaret Dorothy Killam, was a former dietician and nutritionist. They were from Nova Scotia, “a province from which they felt themselves in exile all their lives”. They met when “my father saw her sliding down a banister at Normal School [teacher-training college] and decided there and then that she was the girl he would marry”.”\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/26/fiction.margaretatwood\n\nAtwood did not attend school regularly until she was 12 and was taught to read by her elder brother. Much of her childhood was spent in the woods of Quebec. Although her scientist parents were nonplussed by their daughter’s determination to be a writer they were supportive.\n\nFigures of Speech: Metaphors and Similes\n\nOK, time for a some more “nuts and bolts.” Moving on from punctuation (f you would like to do colons and semi colons or speech marks/inverted commas let me know and we can go back for them) let’s take a look at figures of speech.\n\nFirst of all, let me make this very clear, you do not have to know all the names for figures of speech to be able to use them. In fact, I will go further; you do not have to know the names of any figures of speech to be able to use them.\n\nNative speakers use figures of speech all the time and though we may have heard of similes and metaphors, and may even remember what they are from school, very few people know what most of them are called, and nor do we need to.\n\nBut not needing to know the names does not mean that the subject is without interest. And knowing more about figures of speech may help us to use them better in our writing.\n\nSo, what exactly is a figure of speech? There are innumerable definitions online. I thought this one from Literary Terms was fairly clear.\n\nA figure of speech is a word or phrase using figurative language—language that has other meaning than its normal definition. In other words, figures of speeches rely on implied or suggested meaning, rather than a dictionary definition. We express and develop them through hundreds of different rhetorical techniques, from specific types like metaphors and similes, to more general forms like sarcasm and slang.\n\nOften the definitions split figures of speech into “tropes,” and “themes” but let’s not worry about that. I will just mention that as well as what I had understood to be figures of speech: metaphors, similes etc, things like assonance and alliteration, which concern arranging words according to their sounds, are also considered to be figures of speech.\n\nHow many figures of speech are there in English? It depends on the definition being used but it is a lot. Professor Robert DiYanni says more than 250, using the definition “expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense.”\n\nGrammarly gives examples of twenty, which seems plenty. In fact it seems to me to be more than we need to bother with. If you are desperate to learn what synecdoche is it is easy enough to look up online\n\nThe most often cited figures of speech are metaphors and similes. Both compare something to something else but similes make this explicit with words like, like or as, while metaphors just describe the second thing as if it were the first thing.\n\nBoth are very old and common in many languages, long predating English.\n\n‘They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts’ is from the Old Testament (Judges 6:5) The “like” makes this a simile and not a metaphor.\n\n‘The rosy fingered dawn’ is an often-repeated metaphor from Homer. As well as a metaphor it is a stock description and occurs multiple times in The Iliad alongside ‘the long-haired Achaeans’ and the ‘wine dark sea.’\n\nOnly the first, however, is unequivocally a metaphor. Presumably the Greeks (aka Achaeans) did have long hair so this is a literal description. The wine dark sea is a complicated one. The sea isn’t wine so there is a metaphorical element but why is it always dark? Some have argued that the Ancient Greeks did not perceive blue and this is used in evidence… but we are straying from the point.\n\nSkip forward a couple of millennium and Middle English is thinking about becoming modern English. In Piers Ploughman (circa 1380), Robert Langland uses the simile, “as dead as a doornail.”\n\nA few weeks ago we looked at George Orwell’s influential article, Politics and the English Language. One of the things he rails against is hackneyed expressions and clichés and one of his golden rules for writing is:\n\nNever use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.\n\nNow it seems to me that this needs quite a big caveat. Shakespeare used the expression as dead as a doornail too (he is sometimes erroneously given credit for coining it). It seems to me that if it was first used before 1380 and was still in circulation around 1600 it would be a terrible shame to ban it as a cliché.\n\nAlso, Orwell makes it clear that he is not talking about literary writing. One obvious situation in which you might want to use clichés and hackneyed expressions is in dialogue. You may well be advised to avoid them in the main narrative but want to have a character who uses language oddly or badly.\n\nAlternatively, we might like to subvert a cliché by giving it a twist: Easy as pie could be easy as pi (which for non-mathematicians would not be easy at all). This would contravene the Steven King/Elmore Leonard school of writing advice which says, keep it simple. It risks drawing attention to the writing (and thus taking it away from the story). But there are times, such as in comic writing, where you might want to do this.\n\nHowever, I would suggest that it is a good idea to stop and think, if you find yourself using an already familiar expression. Ask yourself why you are using it and consider whether it would be better to coin an original expression.\n\nBTW, is “coin” in that last line a metaphor or a literal description of inventing, or a new figure of speech?\n\nElizabeth Bishop\n\nFaclan is on at An Lanntair even as we speak. It used to be described as a literary festival but this year it is called a book festival. Anyway, they have some great stuff (on Saturday there is an appearance by Douglas Stuart, writer of the Booker Prize winning Shuggie Bain)\n\nAnyway, I thought we should take this year’s Faclan topic Lost.\n\nLost turns out to be one of those tricky topics to google because if you put in “lost literature” or “lost poetry” you get lots of stuff about works of literature that have been lost, like the Ernest Hemingway manuscripts that were stolen from a train, rather than poems or books that deal with the theme of lost or losing\n\nHowever, I did eventually find a poem that I really liked by a poet who is new to me despite being eminent enough to have won a Pullitzer Prize, One Art by Elizabeth Bishop.\n\n“Elizabeth Bishop was born on February 8, 1911, in Worcester, Massachusetts. When she was less than a year old, her father died, and shortly thereafter, her mother was committed to an asylum. Bishop was first sent to live with her maternal grandparents in Nova Scotia and later lived with paternal relatives in Worcester and South Boston. She earned a bachelor’s degree from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1934.\n\nBishop was independently wealthy, and from 1935 to 1937 she spent time traveling to France, Spain, North Africa, Ireland, and Italy and then settled in Key West, Florida, for four years. Her poetry is filled with descriptions of her travels and the scenery that surrounded her, as with the Florida poems in her first book of verse, North & South (Houghton Mifflin), published in 1946.”\n\nhttps://poets.org/poet/elizabeth-bishop Academy of American Poets\n\n“In 1951 She’d meant to travel on through South America. But, stopping in Rio to see a couple of women she had met in New York, she discovered one of them to be the love of her life. Maria Carlota Costellat de Macedo Soares, known as Lota, was a wealthy landowner, an art collector, and a woman of such inordinate confidence and strength that she was directing the construction of a sleek new glass-and-steel house for herself in the mountains outside Rio. She had no doubt that she could heal the troubled poet who had turned up at her door, and she soon added a gleaming studio for Bishop behind the house—“way up in the air,” Bishop noted with pleasure, as she settled in.” Claudia Roth Pierpont, The New Yorker (2017)\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/elizabeth-bishops-art-of-losing\n\nFrom a wealthy family, educated at Vassar, falling in love with a very rich woman… If this all sounds a bit gilded it is worth remembering there was another side to her life than privilege. The loss of her parents so early was tragic but she also survived sexual and physical abuse from an uncle and never felt able to be open about her relationship with women.\n\nOne Art\n\nThe art of losing isn’t hard to master;\n\nSo many things seem filled with the intent\n\nTo be lost that their loss is no disaster.\n\nLose something every day. Accept the fluster\n\nof lost door keys, the hour badly spent,\n\nThe art of losing isn’t hard to master.\n\nThen practice losing farther, losing faster:\n\nplaces, and names, and where it was you meant\n\nto travel. None of these will bring disaster.\n\nI lost my mother’s watch. And look!

It’s evident\n\nthe art of losing’s not too hard to master\n\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\n\nElizabeth Bishop\n\nWriting Workshop with Mariem Omari\n\nAnother minimalist post this week as last Friday we went to the lovely Westside community space at Grinneabhat for an all day writing workshop delivered by playwright Mariem Omari.\n\nMariam took us through various techniques and exercises, particularly aimed at writing about real life characters and enabling people to tell their own stories, using her own experience in writing works like One Mississippi.\n\nhttps://www.grinneabhat.com/\n\nThe Tins\n\nThis exercise was suggested by Hilary who had done it back when the writing group collaborated with Art Angel in Dundee in sessions led by Scottish poet John Glenday. You can check out his poetry here: https://www.johnglenday.com/\n\nOriginality in Literature\n\nWe have discussed before the fact that originality in art, and literature in particular, has come to be seen as important relatively recently. According to Gisela Gonzalez Perez, it was the Romantic movement of the later 18th Century that really cemented this idea:\n\n“Nowadays, originality is seen as the greatest and most central of literary virtues. However, it only arose as a literary virtue during the Romantic period, comprising inventio (practical skill of an artisan) and creatio (associated with artistry and the exaltation of the individual author and his/her original input). Before that era, getting ‘inspiration’ from previous texts was very common, and also we can find the same plots over and over throughout literary history. In fact, according to Roland Barthes, ‘all texts are made from traces of already existing texts. They are but a fabric woven with allusions and references’. But that won´t make non-connoisseurs feel less cheated when they find out that worldwide celebrated authors ‘borrowed’ from previous writers or the extent to which Shakespeare himself drew from prior works by chroniclers and other playwrights.” Gisela Perez Gonzalez https://giselamusgrove.com/?s=originality\n\nWhat got me thinking about this again was that I happened upon a James Stewart film recently The Shop Around the Corner (1940). The story is adapted from the 1937 Hungarian play Parfumerie by Miklós László and is, perhaps surprisingly, not transplanted to the US but set in the Budapest of the original. Stewart is a clerk in a successful leather goods shop who has an antagonistic relationship with a new, female employee. At the same time the two are conducting a romance via letter, after Stewart answered a newspaper ad.\n\nWhat struck me quite quickly was that the plot was a version of that or the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan romantic comedy You’ve Got Mail. (1998) In that Hanks’ character is the head of a voracious bookshop business about to open a branch around the corner from Ryan’s little independent bookshop, inevitably putting it out of business. Hanks and Ryan are conducting a romance via email, a fairly new idea when the film came out, not realising that they are falling in love with ‘the enemy.’ In fact, though I never realised it, director and co-screenwriter Nora Ephron explicitly acknowledges this plot borrowing. Meg Ryan’s bookstore is called “The Shop Around the Corner.”\n\nThere are, of course, untold thousands of screen adaptations of earlier plays or books, some direct and clear with the same title, some disguised but acknowledged and some not acknowledged at all. It is far from easy to distinguish when a storyline Is so ubiquitous that it really constitutes a genre such as the whodunnit, and when the similarities are such that an explicit acknowledgement ought to be made.\n\nIn poetry something similar applies., although plot is rarely important in modern poetry.\n\nThe thing that hath been it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall b done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Ecclesiastes 1:9\n\nShakespeare, that inveterate borrower of plot, also borrowed this line from the Bible for Sonnet 59\n\nIf there be nothing new, but that which is\n\nHath been before, how are our brains beguiled,\n\nWhich, laboring for invention, bear amiss\n\nThe second burden of a former child.\n\nO, that record could with a backward look,\n\nEven of five hundred courses of the sun,\n\nShow me your image in some antique book,\n\nSince mind at first in character was done,\n\nThat I might see what the old world could say\n\nTo this composèd wonder of your frame;\n\nWhether we are mended, or whe’er better they,\n\nOr whether revolution be the same.\n\nO, sure I am the wits of former days\n\nTo subjects worse have given admiring praise.\n\nNeither the Bible nor Shakespeare are referring to originality in art but a perceived cyclical nature of history. Ecclesiastes is talking about the futility of seeking meaning in new things and ideas. Shakespeare is also making a flattering suggestion that his lover might be more worthy of praise than beauties of legend. But the line has been used in our sense innumerable times since.\n\nSo, if we cannot hope to come up with entirely original stories, characters, perhaps even poetic insights, should we despair as writers?\n\nAbsolutely not. Apart from recourse to nature as prescribed by Wordsworth and co (but still a fertile source of ideas for poets in particular) the many creative writing blogs and courses on the internet seem to be uncharacteristically at one in saying that instead of setting out to look for an original plot we should find our authentic voice and applying that voice to a well worn theme will transform it into something new.\n\n“Let’s face it: most plots have already been done. In fact, the same plots have been done over and over so many times that we as readers have divided them into genres– and every year, thousands upon thousands of people all around the world pick up one of these same genres and read them again.\n\nIt can be demoralizing to spend years working on a story only to see something similar released, whether on TV, or in book form or even game form, but do not let it discourage you. Someone may have written a plot similar to the one that you wrote, but has anyone ever done it the way that you are going to?\n\nWrite your story. You may be surprised at how different it ends up being, even if the concept is similar.”\n\nhttps://medium.com/@write-class/how-to-stop-worrying-about-originality-in-storytelling-9933a3426bc9 R. James Blackburn\n\nThis is an interesting idea and I have to say that the most worrying thing about it is the ubiquity of it as a recommendation. Call me an old cynic, all right, all right, I am an old cynic, but to see such agreement online worries me a bit.* But we all have a resource that can make our work different to what has gone before and that it our lives and lived experience.\n\nI don’t mean just memoires, though that is a valid type of literature. Memories and experiences, people that we encounter along the way, can all be drawn on to make fiction different and vivid. If all stories are versions of other stories it is at least as true that all our life experiences are unique. I am currently reading Elena Ferrante’s My Brilliant Friend which follows two girls growing up in post war Naples. The author is famously anonymous (Ferrante is a pen name) but I would be astonished if much of it is not drawn from her life.\n\n*I think this is worth further discussion. Are all possible storylines really already used? Is ‘finding our authentic” voice really what writers need to do? All writers? Where else can we look for originality?\n\nI found the picture above online (see link). This is Barking Vicarage which, in the lates sixties/early seventies, was the home of a friend of my sister, the vicar’s son. He had the whole top floor and gave me my first ever driving lesson in the grounds.\n\nThis is obviously not going to have much meaning for most people but I put it in as an example of what a great resource the internet can be for rediscovering things from your own life which might be used to flavour stories or poems. The Facebook Group: Stornoway Now and Then, for example, is a good source for people who grew up in Stornoway. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1025657710790236/\n\nPrompts:\n\nMy brilliant friend\n\nMy idiotic friend\n\nMy strange friend\n\nThe Beach at night\n\nThose who leave and those who stay\n\nMy favourite shop\n\nApostrophes\n\nIf the comma is the devil’s tadpole then the apostrophe is the flying tadpole.\n\nApostrophes have two main uses. One is to indicate a missing letter or letters in a word or phrase. A contraction such as wasn’t for was not, for example, or ‘neath, for underneath. Alternatively it is used to indicate possession. There are other uses but they are minor and unusual.\n\nThe apostrophe stands in contrast the comma. As we saw, the comma can be quite a tricky little blighter to sprinkle correctly in sentences but it doesn’t really have the reputation of being difficult that, perhaps, it should.\n\nThe apostrophe is the other way round. It tends to be thought as more difficult but is, in fact, relatively straightforward. Why is this?\n\nIn part, I suspect, it is the work of that feared division of the grammar Nazis, the punctuation police. Nothing, not a split infinitive (which, as we will see, is perfectly permissible in English) nor turning a noun into a verb enrages the pedantic soul more than a misplaced apostrophe. This is so much so that there is now a term, ‘the grocer’s apostrophe’ for the most popular apostrophic error.\n\nThe grocer’s apostrophe (sometimes ‘the greengrocer’s apostrophe’) is when a possessive apostrophe is put where it is not required, usually in a plural. A greengrocer might write Apple’s for example, unaware that the apples in question don’t possess anything and that the s simply informs the reader that a plurality of apples are for sale.\n\nThe grocer’s apostrophe sends grammar Nazis into paroxysms of mouth frothing rage. But while this is always amusing it is unnecessary. After all, if you see a market stall with ‘apple’s for sale,’ sign, you are unlikely to be confused about what it is these apples could possibly posses (a healthy sheen? a delicious taste? The texture of cardboard?) You will simply assume that there is more than one of them. As the function of English is communication and no miscommunication has occurred it hardly seems worth jumping up and down with steam coming out of your ears. If, however, you are writing for publication or marking it important to avoid it.\n\nThe possessive apostrophe is used to indicate possession but that might be broader than is at first obvious. For example, inanimate objects can posses things, as we saw with the apple’s delicious taste. October’s gales, fear’s deadly embrace, time’s arrow… even abstract nouns can possess, and require an apostrophe.\n\nStill, possessive apostrophes are pretty straightforward except… It does get a bit more complex when the noun already ends with an s and with plurals.\n\nSingular nouns with s endings move the apostrophe beyond the last letter, or we add an extra s:\n\n‘Dicken’s book, Hard Times’ is wrong, his name is Dickens not Dicken. So it becomes Dickens’ book or Dickens’s.\n\nWhich is correct? It’s a style question. If writing for publication check the style guide.\n\nThis freedom only applies to singular words that end in s.\n\nMany plurals are formed by adding an s and if that needs a possessive apostrophe you just add it to the end: the starlings’ murmuration.\n\nThere is one big exception to the usual rule about possessive apostrophes and that is with possessive pronouns: its, our, their etc. In the case of its it might seem odd that it doesn’t take an apostrophe in the case of: The river meandered its way.’ But bear in mind the other main use of apostrophes. It’s is a contraction. It’s short for it is.\n\nTo quote Grammarly: “Most writers don’t have trouble with the possessive pronouns my, mine, his, her, and our. It’s your, yours, hers, its, ours, their, and theirs that tend to cause the confusion. The relative possessive pronoun whose is also frequently the victim of apostrophe abuse. Note that none of these forms use an apostrophe.”\n\nThe second main use of the apostrophe is to signify missing letters. We have seen the contraction it’s for it is. Wasn’t for was not, can’t for cannot are other common examples. Sometimes it is just a part of a word that is missing, ‘cause for because, for example. You will no doubt have noticed that this tends very much to be informal language and when letters are missing from the front of a word, often slang, dialect or archaic. The main exception is o’clock, which stands for of the clock which sounds odd and outdated.\n\nWe are talking about English so, of course, there are obscure exceptions. If you want to check them out Grammarly is as thorough as usual: https://www.grammarly.com/blog/apostrophe/#:~:text=Using%20an%20unnecessary%20apostrophe%20to,do%20not%20make%20nouns%20plural.\n\nOtherwise, here are the main things to remember:\n\nApostrophes are used to indicate possession or missing letters. They are not normally used to make a plural (even of bananas).\n\nPossessive apostrophes go before a possessive s which is added to the word, except when the word ends in s already.\n\nSingular words that end in s can move the apostrophe beyond the last letter: Dickens’ fame or can add a second s: Dickens’s parrot. This is a style choice which means it might be a rule for some publishers. Otherwise just decide and stick to whichever you choose, at least in the same document.\n\nPlural words, just move the apostrophe beyond the s: the long ships’ reign of terror.\n\nNight Mail\n\nNight Mail is a classic British documentary featuring Benjamin Britten‘s music with W H Auden’s poetry.\n\nFrom the British Library Website:\n\n‘In 1935, the General Post Office Film Unit decided to produce a documentary to present the new 24-hour postal service between England and Scotland. In July of that year Benjamin Britten met poet W H Auden (1907–73), and their seven year collaboration resulted in stage plays, song settings and films. Their relationship during that time developed from friendship through love to eventual acrimony.\n\nThe resulting documentary, Night Mail, is recognised today as a classic of its genre, having been produced with a highly artistic treatment of its subject: a postal train which makes its journey during the night while in one of its carriages staff sorts out the mail for delivery the next day.\n\nThe music features in only 4 of the total 24 minutes of the film and is condensed to the end sequence. It alternates between a heavy rhythmic style underlying the syllabic character of the verse reading, and a pastoral style reflecting on the nature and significance of the postal mail.\n\nIn this scene, the realistic and factual narration and overall tone of the film is transfigured into an artistic and poetic realm where Auden’s lines are carried forward by Britten’s music. The orchestra and the poem are synchronised with the main protagonist of the film, the postal train. The skillful coordination of sound, music, text and image makes it a significant episode in film history.’ The British Library https://www.bl.uk/works/night-mail\n\n‘Thanks to the classic film which featured it – and for which it was specially written – ‘Night Mail’ remains one of Auden’s best-known poems.’ Dr Oliver Tearle, Interesting Literature\n\nThe Night Mail W.

Auden\n\nThis is the night mail crossing the Border,\n\nBringing the cheque and the postal order,\n\nLetters for the rich, letters for the poor,\n\nThe shop at the corner, the girl next door.\n\nPulling up Beattock, a steady climb:\n\nThe gradient’s against her, but she’s on time.\n\nPast cotton-grass and moorland boulder\n\nShovelling white steam over her shoulder,\n\nSnorting noisily as she passes\n\nSilent miles of wind-bent grasses.\n\nBirds turn their heads as she approaches,\n\nStare from bushes at her blank-faced coaches.\n\nSheep-dogs cannot turn her course;\n\nThey slumber on with paws across.\n\nIn the farm she passes no one wakes,\n\nBut a jug in a bedroom gently shakes.\n\nDawn freshens, Her climb is done.\n\nDown towards Glasgow she descends,\n\nTowards the steam tugs yelping down a glade of cranes\n\nTowards the fields of apparatus, the furnaces\n\nSet on the dark plain like gigantic chessmen.\n\nAll Scotland waits for her:\n\nIn dark glens, beside pale-green lochs\n\nMen long for news.\n\nLetters of thanks, letters from banks,\n\nLetters of joy from girl and boy,\n\nReceipted bills and invitations\n\nTo inspect new stock or to visit relations,\n\nAnd applications for situations,\n\nAnd timid lovers’ declarations,\n\nAnd gossip, gossip from all the nations,\n\nNews circumstantial, news financial,\n\nLetters with holiday snaps to enlarge in,\n\nLetters with faces scrawled on the margin,\n\nLetters from uncles, cousins, and aunts,\n\nLetters to Scotland from the South of France,\n\nLetters of condolence to Highlands and Lowlands\n\nWritten on paper of every hue,\n\nThe pink, the violet, the white and the blue,\n\nThe chatty, the catty, the boring, the adoring,\n\nThe cold and official and the heart’s outpouring,\n\nClever, stupid, short and long,\n\nThe typed and the printed and the spelt all wrong.\n\nThousands are still asleep,\n\nDreaming of terrifying monsters\n\nOr of friendly tea beside the band in Cranston’s or Crawford’s:\n\nAsleep in working Glasgow, asleep in well-set Edinburgh,\n\nAsleep in granite Aberdeen,\n\nThey continue their dreams,\n\nBut shall wake soon and hope for letters,\n\nAnd none will hear the postman’s knock\n\nWithout a quickening of the heart,\n\nFor who can bear to feel himself forgotten?\n\nLoss\n\nby Rebecca Mahoney\n\nAs I started to research the theme of loss I felt a bit overwhelmed by the breadth of the topic and the sheer volume of literature written on the themes of loss. So I decided to start by looking at some traditional and modern poems on the theme of loss.\n\nThe famous WH Auden p"
