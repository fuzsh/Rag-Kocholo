        "text": "By Josh Herwitt //\n\nDIIV with Lightning Bolt, untitled (halo) //\n\nThe Wiltern – Los Angeles\n\nJune 29th, 2024 //\n\nFor nearly 15 years it’s no secret the music industry has moved farther away from the guitar-driven rock that prevailed through much of the 90’s and early 2000’s. Some have even gone as far to now say “rock is dead,” and while we can point out some of our own experiences from recent memory — including one here — to counter that claim, there have only been a handful of new bands since 2010 that accurately fit the description and have hooked me enough to catch them live.\n\nAustralian sextet King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard are one of those acts, and their three-hour marathon at the iconic Hollywood Bowl last summer (read our show review here) was one of our favorite shows in 2023 (see our picks here).\n\nEnglish bass-and-drums duo Royal Blood are another, and their bone-rattling concert at The Wiltern in November (read our show review here) was also a highlight for us last year.\n\nOf course we can’t forget about Houston psych-funk-rock trio Khruangbin, which have continued their ascent with sold-out gigs at some of America’s biggest music venues and events. In fact, we still think about their 2022 appearance on Day 2 of Primavera Sound LA (read our festival review here).\n\nAnd then there’s “American indie-groove band” Goose, who gave us a chance to finally watch them in the flesh several months ago when they made their Santa Barbara Bowl debut and a compelling case why they have been one of the hottest (jam) bands lately (read our show review here).\n\nObviously there are supergroups and/or side projects like The Smile, boygenius and The New Basement Tapes as well, while others might argue that bands such as Greta Van Fleet, Hockey Dad, Turnstile, Wet Leg and Viagra Boys have carried the torch forward for the genre (note: IDLES were not mentioned here because they formed back in 2009 along with Alabama Shakes, Atoms for Peace, Broken Bells, Dawes, The Dead Weather, How to Destroy Angels, Rival Sons, Them Crooked Vultures and Wild Nothing).\n\nBut standing among some of the best to arrive on the scene in roughly the last decade and a half are DIIV, which began as a solo endeavor for Zachary Cole Smith (lead vocals, guitar) after previous stints as a guitarist in the psych-rock outfit Soft Black and drummer/guitarist for indie rockers Beach Fossils while he was living in Brooklyn.\n\nSmith has relocated to LA since DIIV’s formation, but the group’s sound has remained fairly consistent — dreamy, hazy vocals float on top of gritty, fuzzed-out guitars as they collide with punchy rhythms that immediately evoke comparisons to Modest Mouse, Silversun Pickups, Slowdive and even Explosions in the Sky when we listen. That’s not to say DIIV’s shoegaze-laden soundscapes don’t have their own feel and vibe, though. They very much have their own identity, as Smith’s catchy riffs often pull you in at the start and build up to moments of pure sonic bliss like on “Taker” or “Acheron” that stands as the longest track in the DIIV catalog at more than seven minutes.\n\nFour albums in following the May release of Frog in Boiling Water on Fantasy Records, and the quartet that was a five-piece in the early 2010’s and currently includes Smith’s childhood friend Andrew Bailey (guitar), Colin Caulfield (bass, keyboards, guitar, vocals) and Ben Newman (drums) are no doubt a well-established unit at this point. The 10-track LP anchored by lead single “Brown Paper Bag” has already garnered critical acclaim from quite a few media outlets and fits in nicely with the rest of DIIV’s material, showcasing Smith’s continued growth and evolution as a singer-songwriter. And although we can’t say his overall range behind the microphone has transformed dramatically dating back to 2012’s full-length debut Oshin, Smith does come across more forceful in his delivery on DIIV’s latest studio effort.\n\nWrapping up the first leg of a 33-date North American tour last Saturday at The Wiltern with Rhode Island noise-rock duo Lightning Bolt and LA’s untitled (halo) providing support, Smith and company delivered plenty of highs from “Doused” to “Blankenship” and yet left us yearning to hear others like “Dopamine” off 2016’s Is the Is Are and “Skin Game” from 2019’s Deceiver. The fact that neither of those are being played was somewhat surprising — even if they aren’t among their Top 5 songs on Spotify — and yet encouraging considering how well we thought their 90-minute performance in LA flowed from one song to the next. DIIV haven’t been mixing up their setlists each night they take the stage, instead sticking to a very similar script so far for their 2024 dates across Europe and the U.S. While that’s something we eventually hope to see from them after another album cycle, the next six months will mark an important stretch for DIIV with their tour schedule extending all the way through December and taking them back to the UK where a couple of sold-out gigs with Irish post-punk band Fontaines D.C. — another one of the rare major post-2010 rock acts to emerge — in London await.\n\nThe impending doom and gloom that Smith’s lyrics have been known to address since DIIV’s inception in 2011 don’t exactly anoint them as champions of hope and optimism at a time of great uncertainty and political tension here at home. Frog confronts the “overwhelmingly banal collapse of society under end-stage capitalism,” and with another U.S. presidential election looming that stars a former president and convicted felon, there’s a real cause for concern with the stakes higher than ever. The video interludes — one to advertise DIIV merch, another to introduce their sophomore single on Frog entitled “”Soul-net” and finally a satirical promo for ExxonMobil at the beginning of the encore — sprinkled in throughout the show reminded us of that dark reality, but as Bailey told Zane Lowe during a recent interview for Apple Music: “The message isn’t ‘the world is screwed and there’s nothing we can do.’ It’s more pointing out the fact that the world is screwed and heading toward demise … how do we accept that reality and still turn it into something positive?”\n\nSmith, for one, has faced his own demons and past struggles with substance abuse that we don’t need to get into but has courageously come out on the other side all while continuing to push the boundaries sonically with every DIIV release. Frog, after all, was the first time the band worked democratically with writing credits going to all four members, challenging them individually and testing the strength of their collective bond in ultimately representing “a mesmeric testament to enduring.” For us fans, it’s just one sign of another great band in the making.\n\nSetlist:\n\nIn Amber\n\nLike Before You Were Born\n\nBrown Paper Bag\n\nUnder the Sun\n\n(Druun Pt.

Is it their penchant for improvisation, their long-running songs or their loyal, dedicated fans?\n\nFrom the Grateful Dead and The Allman Brothers to Phish, Widespread Panic and many more, a lot of folks I come into contact with either love ’em or hate ’em. Regardless of where you stand on the matter though, the reality is that they have been part of the music ecosystem dating back to the early 60’s and continue to be more than six decades later.\n\nWith that in mind, there should be little debate to assert that Phish have stood squarely at the top of the jam-band mountain for the past 30-plus years. The Burlington foursome that formed in the early 80’s at the University of Vermont has taken the torch from the Dead and in their own way kept that fire burning bright, building a unique community of diehards often known for traveling far distances to see them rock out at least three hours each night.\n\nBut there’s a new kid on the block now, and even though they might call themselves an “American indie-groove band from Connecticut,” it’s no secret that Goose like to “jam” when they step onstage. Phish’s music, after all, has always been rooted in grooves, and in that regard, it feels like the five-piece named after an Anatidae waterfowl rather than an aquatic animal is certainly paying homage to Trey Anastasio, Jon Fishman, Mike Gordon and Page McConnell with that sort of description for their sonic creations.\n\nFor those following closely, the million-dollar question — figuratively and literally — in the jam scene of late has been if Goose are next in line to eventually succeed the almighty Phish. The two groups have already formed a friendly bond, with Anastasio sitting in with Goose last year for the second of two sold-out gigs at Radio City Music Hall that featured a more unexpected cameo appearance by Father John Misty, too.\n\nYet, it was less than six months after those shows in NYC that Rick Mitarotonda (guitar, vocals), Trevor Weeks (bass, poetry), Ben Atkind (drums), Peter Anspach (keyboards, guitar, vocals) and Jeff Arevalo (percussion, drums, vocals) were touring with Anastasio and his solo project on an eight-date run that offered them even more exposure to Phish’s fan (or should we say “phan”) base.\n\nEvery member of Goose, similar to Phish, is an excellent musician. Mitarotonda’s virtuosity and emotive solos are assuredly reminiscent of Anastasio’s at times, and you wouldn’t know that Anspach, a guitarist first and foremost, only started playing keyboards when he signed on as the fourth member of Goose in 2017. The formal training that Mitarotonda, Atkind and Arevalo each received while they were at Berklee College of Music in Boston is quite evident when you watch them perform, but for a band showcasing as much musicianship as Goose, their vocal capabilities are equally impressive. It’s something Mitarotonda has worked very hard at according to Anspach, whom he shares the role of lead vocalist with, and what could ultimately help separate Goose from the pack when you consider that singing hasn’t always been a priority for some musicians in the jam world.\n\nOf course, Goose’s pursuit to not only be an outstanding outfit in the live space but also one that takes the album-making process just as seriously is another side to the quintet that’s refreshing and can’t be overlooked. After 2016’s Moon Cabin sans Anspach and subsequently 2021’s Shenanigans Nite Club, they made such clear when they hired an outside producer for the first time, and their decision to elect D. James Goodwin, who has worked with Bob Weir as well as established indie acts like Kevin Morby and Whitney, proved to be a good (no pun intended) choice for the release of Dripfield in 2022. Goose have made songwriting a priority early on in their ascent, but a smart marketing strategy that saw them gross more than $100,000 during the COVID-19 pandemic by livestreaming eight concerts from a barn in their home state has propelled them rather quickly into the mainstream. In fact, few jam bands have earned the opportunity to perform on late-night television like Goose have.\n\nYou could tell by the turnout Goose received at their Santa Barbara Bowl debut — a day before making an inaugural appearance at Ohana Fest and a day after headlining The Wiltern in LA for the first time — they have come a long way in less than a decade. Though the 4,562-seat amphitheater wasn’t sold out, it was mostly full from the GA floor up to the A, B and C sections, a promising sign for any young band on the rise, with chants of “Gooooose” ringing out as the sun set over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nLike any top-notch jam band, Goose craft a unique setlist every time they take the stage with an arsenal of covers at the ready and this outing would be no different. Much of the first set was carried by live cuts of material that has yet to be officially laid down in a recording studio, but Bruce Hornsby & the Range’s “The Way It Is” and Echo & the Bunnymen’s “The Killing Moon” that kicked off the evening’s second set provided everyone at the Bowl with a couple of familiar reference points. Nevertheless, the accessibility and hooks that Dripfield offers listeners are what sets Goose apart from other jam-oriented artists, and as its tracks — “Arrow” and “Hot Tea” plus “So Ready” (an alternate version of “Slow Ready” featuring some auto-tune from Mitarotonda) were what we were treated to in this case — take on their own size and shape under the bright lights, they’re destined to fill a room no matter how big or small it is. So with a European tour lined up next month and a couple of more arena performances before 2023 concludes, there’s no telling how high these guys will be flying by this time next year.\n\nSetlist:\n\nSet 1\n\nEarthling or Alien?\n\nMr. Action\n\nTime to Flee (with “Honeybee” teases)\n\nThe Way It Is (Bruce Hornsby & the Range cover)\n\nSeekers on the Ridge pt.

For many artists and bands, this year marked the first since 2019 that they had the opportunity to step onstage — and that was a victory in and of itself.\n\nWhile we aren’t completely out of the woods yet considering the coronavirus is still very much a part of our lives, there’s no signs of us returning to those dark and dire days of 2020. The shows simply must go on, and we are all better for it whether you’re a musician or just a fan.\n\nNow as we turn to 2023 with cautious optimism, it’s time for us to share our annual “Best of” lists as we have done since this blog first began (see our 2021 picks here). We’ll be quick to admit we didn’t catch every show or hear all of the albums released in the past 12 months, but looking back on the year that was can not only be fun but also challenging with so much great music to consider.\n\nSo, without further ado, Showbams presents The Bam Team’s five favorite shows, albums and songs from 2022.\n\nListen to The Bam Team’s favorite songs of 2022:\n\nJosh Herwitt // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2022\n\n1. My Morning Jacket at Red Rocks Amphitheatre – Morrison, CO – August 26th-27th\n\n2022 will go down as easily one of my favorite years for live music. So many of the artists and bands I love toured after being forced to sit on the sidelines for at least two years, and as I look back on all of the shows I was fortunate enough to witness, it would be a shame to not mention the ones that aren’t already included here, whether it was Eddie Vedder, Baroness, Royal Blood, Interpol and The Shins at Just Like Heaven, Jack White (two nights), The Kills, Puscifer on my big day, Fleet Foxes, Big Gigantic Telefon Tel Aviv, Moderat, Khruangbin and Arctic Monkeys — plus Lorde — at the debut of Primavera Sound LA, The Mars Volta, Bonobo, Foals, Modest Mouse performing The Lonesome Crowded West from start to finish to celebrate the LP’s 25th anniversary or The Smile closing out their North America tour. But this year’s No. 1 spot once again goes to My Morning Jacket, which have become my top live band over the last decade among some very stiff competition (see the rest of the bands listed below to get a better idea). With back-to-back dates in SoCal at the Santa Barbara Bowl and Hollywood Forever (read our review here) serving as a preview for what would come the following week, the Louisville-bred rockers left no stone unturned in their return to Red Rocks. If there was ever an act to catch — not once but twice — at the legendary amphitheater after visiting it more than a dozen times in my life so far, this was the one for me and MMJ proved it over two sold-out gigs with no repeats as always.\n\n2. The War on Drugs at Shrine Auditorium – Los Angeles, CA – February 26th\n\n3. Pearl Jam at The Forum – Inglewood, CA – May 6th\n\n4. Tool at Viejas Arena – San Diego, CA – January 19th\n\n5. Nine Inch Nails at Santa Barbara Bowl – Santa Barbara, CA – September 13th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2022\n\n1. The Smile – A Light for Attracting Attention\n\nIt wasn’t until last year during a surprise performance for the concert video “Live at Worthy Farm” when we first learned of the latest side project from Radiohead members Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood with Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner. But after putting out six singles off their debut LP that came out back in May, it was clear the three-piece wasn’t messing around. Across all 13 tracks on A Light for Attracting Attention, it’s safe to say there isn’t one worth skipping, reaffirming why Yorke remains one of the best songwriters out there in the last 30 years. And with him and Greenwood switching off between guitar, bass and synthesizer among a bevy of other instrumentation including vocoder, piano and harp, their talents are as palpable as they have ever been before. After all, hearing Yorke croon “Don’t mess with me” toward the beginning of “The Smoke” is an edict — literal or not — many would have a tough time disputing at this point.\n\n2. Kendrick Lamar – Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers\n\n3. Jack White – Fear of the Dawn\n\n4. My Morning Jacket – MMJ Live Vol. 2: Chicago 2021\n\n5. Bonobo – Fragments\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2022\n\n1. The Mars Volta – “Graveyard Love”\n\nFor fans of The Mars Volta, it has been a long wait since Omar Rodríguez-López and Cedric Bixler-Zavala hit the studio to record new material. Even with the project’s two constant members on good terms these days, it took more than a decade before anything would enter our earholes. But despite many of the prog-rock tendencies it demonstrated on earlier albums dating all the way back to 2003’s seminal De-Loused in the Comatorium, the duo’s seventh studio effort delves unexpectedly into new sonic territory. With a pop aesthetic running through it that surprisingly sees no song surpass the five-minute mark, The Mars Volta will undoubtedly be looked at as a departure from the days of “Cygnus…Vismund Cygnus” and “Cassandra Gemini” when Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala were captivating At the Drive-In fans as well as new listeners. Nevertheless, its second single “Graveyard Love” stands tall as some of their best work to date and reminds us that these guys haven’t lost what made them so uniquely special.\n\n2. The Smile – “Thin Thing”\n\n3. Jack White – “Eosophobia”\n\n4. Interpol – “Toni”\n\n5. Moderat – “EASY PREY”\n\nAndrew Pohl // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2022\n\n1. Yard Act at Rickshaw Stop – San Francisco, CA – April 21st\n\nFunny story about this show … I had been hearing a lot of buzz about Yard Act, and I had only listened to one song played a few times on KEXP, which I really dug. I had been on the Rickshaw Stop’s email list, and the venue ran a contest for free tickets. I happened to win so I took a chance and opted to see Yard Act’s show that same week. Wanting to familiarize myself with their material more, I immediately dove head first into their album and was totally hooked, so I felt really good about this turn of events. I hadn’t been to a gig at Rickshaw Stop in many years and was eager to visit again, so it felt great to be back in a packed room again for an intimate evening of punk rock. The opening act Buzzed Light Beer fell a bit flat in my humble opinion, but once Yard Act took the stage, the room started buzzing with life. Lead singer James Smith’s command of the crowd is very nonchalant, but he also knows he has you hanging on every word. The set was fun and well-executed, and the UK quartet was clearly on its “A” game after a lengthy run of shows and in between weekend performances at Coachella. Much to the chagrin of those in attendance, Smith kept referring to the audience as “San Diego” (LOL), though he did tell us that he had some mushrooms the night before, so … you know. To round things out, Smith offered to do a magic trick during the last song of Yard Act’s set before their encore and coaxed fans to hand over any loose bills they had, which he pocketed and took backstage. As it turns out, he actually gifted the money to the bar staff, which I felt was a nice touch and very much on-brand.\n\n2. THE FEST 20 – Gainesville, FL – October 28th–30th\n\n3. Coheed & Cambria at Greek Theatre Berkeley – Berkeley, CA – August 14th\n\n4. Bauhaus at The Masonic – San Francisco, CA – May 22nd\n\n5. The Velvet Teen at Arlene Francis Center – Santa Rosa, CA – June 17th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2022\n\n1. Pilot to Gunner – Hail Hallucinator\n\nBrooklyn indie rockers Pilot to Gunner hadn’t put out an album for a decade, and to be honest, I hadn’t really paid much attention to them prior to Hail Hallucinator. The name was always out there and I had friends who were really into them, but I never got around to checking out their music for one reason or another. And not unlike many other bands that came before them (i.e. Seaweed, Far, The Murder City Devils), I am bummed that I was so late to the party. They are absolutely fantastic, and this record was easily my most listened-to during 2022. From start to finish, the 10-track LP hit all the marks for me in terms of stellar songwriting, original-sounding guitar work that still feels familiar and vocals carrying the torch of the early 2000’s indie/emo revival sound ala Hey Mercedes and Jimmy Eat World all while not completely aping either group. “Drop the Sun”, “We’re Blasting to Masses”, “Total Rager” and “Escape Season” are among its best tracks, but I simply love all of them from beginning to end.\n\n2. Thee Sacred Souls – Thee Sacred Souls\n\n3. Yard Act – The Overload\n\n4. Soul Glo – Diaspora Problems\n\n5. High Vis – Blending\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2022\n\n1. 3rd Secret – “I Choose Me”\n\nThe supergroup 3rd Secret surprised the music world when their debut self-titled LP arrived in mid-April. Comprised of members from Nirvana, Soundgarden, Hater and Giants in the Trees, the album is a tour de force brought to you by grunge and alt-rock royalty. Its lead single “I Choose Me” turns things up and right out of the gate you can’t help but feel a little washed over with nostalgia from guitarist Kim Thayil’s signature riffage in addition to the thundering cadence courtesy of bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Matt Cameron. What makes the song — and the album — stand out to me, however, is the work of co-vocalists Jillian Raye and Jennifer Johnson. The pair deliver gorgeous singing atop the otherwise gritty instrumentation, harkening back to what made so many 90’s albums awesome with a beautiful balance of dark and light. I kept coming back to this song a lot throughout the year, and it made me really reflect on just how incredible the music that came out of the Pacific Northwest was when I was growing up. To hear this collection of musicians conjuring up those aural ghosts through a contemporary filter was not only refreshing, but also something that I was really looking for in 2022.\n\n2.

PUP at The Fonda Theatre – Los Angeles, CA – April 21st\n\nTwo years and one full length after this show was originally supposed to occur, LA finally got to see PUP perform on their “Thank Fucking God” tour. Worth the wait would be a major understatement here as the Canadian punks transported us back to pre-pandemic times like nothing had ever happened — we were touching, we were screaming, we were moshing again! The night had such an innocent air to it. Despite the delay, 2019’s Morbid Stuff felt fresher than ever (and it still does).\n\n2. Yaya Bey at Cafe Erzulie – Brooklyn, NY – June 16th\n\n3.

Lando Chill – if im being honest\n\nThe multi-hyphenate who’s based out of LA quietly dropped this mixtape early in the year, and it stood strong in my top spot from the start.

Steve Lacy – “Bad Habit”\n\nAn earworm for the ages! This impossibly catchy tune took over TikTok and catapulted Mr. Lacy into the spotlight that he was born to occupy, whether he was ready for it or not. The cherry on top of his banner year was the singer-songwriter’s old iPhone (aka his instrument) landing on display in the Smithsonian.\n\n2. Lando Chill – “guess”\n\n3. Leggy – “Lipstick on the Mic”\n\n4. Pusha T – “Brambleton”\n\n5. Channel Tres – “Acid in My Blood”\n\nBy Josh Herwitt //\n\nMy Morning Jacket //\n\nSanta Barbara Bowl & Hollywood Forever Cemetery – Santa Barbara & Los Angeles\n\nAugust 16th & 17th, 2022 //\n\nWhen My Morning Jacket made the “deeply painful” decision to cancel their three-night New Year’s run at the Mission Ballroom in Denver last year with the COVID-19 pandemic still wreaking havoc thanks to the rise of the omicron variant, it was a gut punch for the Louisville rockers and their most diehard fans, many of whom were traveling from out of state to see them.\n\nBut more than six weeks later, the five-piece would announce its 2022 tour encompassing 33 dates with most of the venues booked, not surprisingly, being at outdoor amphitheaters and/or open spaces with a lawn. Keeping everyone’s safety in mind has always been the band’s priority first and foremost, and with the spring and summer bringing us the warmest months of the year, there was no way MMJ were going to further risk experiencing any cancellations during what we’ve dubbed as “outdoor concert season.”\n\nAnd yet even with all the precautions that had been taken by everyone, it still wasn’t enough to prevent more COVID misfortune when frontman Jim James tested positive in June, just a day before the band’s two hometown shows — its first in six years — were scheduled to take place. While the news had MMJ fans once again feeling bummed about the state of live music after the last two-plus years, James (lead vocals, guitar) and his bandmates in Tom Blankenship (bass), Patrick Hallahan (drums, percussion), Bo Koster (keyboards, percussion, backing vocals) and Carl Broemel (guitar, pedal steel guitar, saxophone, backing vocals) have certainly put that behind them now after taking more than a month off from touring during July and part of August.\n\nBelieve it or not, MMJ in many ways sound better than they ever have after witnessing two of their three performances in California, starting with a return to the Santa Barbara Bowl last Tuesday only 11 months after their last visit (read our show review here) and continuing the following night in LA among the many celebrities now deceased — even “Toto” from the “Wizard of Oz” — at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nJames, for one, has always sounded great at the mic and with a guitar in his hands, but he’s also never looked more at ease onstage despite his recent bout with the virus, shedding the big pair of sunglasses he once donned (as you can see here) for the naked eye — a clear sign that MMJ’s primary songwriter isn’t hiding from us if he ever was trying to previously.\n\nArriving in Santa Barbara two days after making a stop at Frost Amphitheater on the campus of Stanford University, the clock hit 7:30 p.m. and MMJ went to work, diving straight into their self-titled LP that came out last October with “Never in the Real World”. James and company didn’t wait long at all to turn up the volume, however, with “Lay Low” subsequently sending the crowd into a frenzy early on. The six-minute track off 2005’s seminal Z has always been a personal favorite of mine to hear live and would quickly set the tone for the rest of the evening.\n\nFor a band that has always put an emphasis on mixing up its setlists and will rarely perform songs in the same order though, it was a couple of cuts on its debut album The Tennessee Fire that were surprising to hear midway through its standard 2 1/2-hour set. In fact, it was the first time this year — and just the fifth over the last five years — that MMJ have played “I Will Be There When You Die” while the acoustic “If All Else Fails” has been heard on solely a handful of occasions so far in 2022.\n\nWhile other highlights in Santa Barbara included an extended version of “Steam Engine” with Broemel trading his axe for the sax at one point and just the third time “I Never Could Get Enough” has made it onto a setlist, it was the Hollywood show that grabbed more of the MMJ fanbase’s attention. Of course, the heightened interest around it was somewhat understandable considering that it’s not every day you get to catch a concert inside a cemetery, let alone one where rock icons like Johnny Ramone and Chris Cornell are buried, but the setting was, at most, half the story on The Fairbanks Lawn as day eventually turned to night.\n\nBreathing life into “What a Wonderful Man” and James’ own “State of the Art (A.E.I.O.U.)” for only the second time this year and first since the jam-adjacent group’s three-day “One Big Holiday” destination event back in March, we had hoped that MMJ would be setting up for a special finish down the stretch and that’s exactly what they gifted us with a 17-minute “Dondante” that conjured up some major disco vibes. With the Z finale serving as one of several tunes MMJ has been known to stretch out when they perform live, it felt rather fitting to hear what James wrote after the passing of his late bandmate Aaron Todovich while being surrounded by a bunch of tombstones.\n\nEven though MMJ had more music lined up for us before hitting the road for New Mexico, that was all many of us needed to hear to be satisfied. After waiting almost a decade for another “Dondante” in LA since their epic, three-night run at The Wiltern, everything else that ensued — from the one-two punch of “Wasted” and “Dancefloors” to a more abbreviated encore featuring “Wordless Chorus” and “Touch Me I’m Going to Scream Pt. 2” that ended things on a spooky note — was gravy. After all, this is an act that has always kept its fans on their toes, and as MMJ gear up this weekend for their most significant shows of the tour with two sold-out nights at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, there’s no telling what’s in store when James steps into what he has coined “the birth canal of the universe.” Call it whatever you want Mr. James because either way, we’ll be there for it when the lights go down and the first note is struck.\n\nSANTA BARBARA BOWL\n\nSetlist:\n\nNever in the Real World\n\nLay Low\n\nCompound Fracture\n\nLeast Expected\n\nMahgeetah\n\nFeel You\n\nVictory Dance\n\nGideon\n\nHoldin On to Black Metal\n\nI Will Be There When You Die\n\nIf All Else Fails\n\nTropics (Erase Traces)\n\nSpring (Among the Living)\n\nSteam Engine\n\nI Never Could Get Enough\n\nTouch Me I’m Going to Scream Pt. 1\n\nLove Love Love\n\nComplex\n\nOne Big Holiday\n\nEncore:\n\nIn Color\n\nCircuital\n\nTouch Me I’m Going to Scream Pt. 2\n\nWordless Chorus\n\nHOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY\n\nSetlist:\n\nFeel You\n\nWhat a Wonderful Man\n\nOff the Record\n\nI Will Sing You Songs\n\nVictory Dance\n\nEvil Urges\n\nGolden (dedicated to “Toto” from “The Wizard of Oz”)\n\nI’m Amazed\n\nSpring (Among the Living)\n\nComplex\n\nOne Big Holiday\n\nState of the Art (A.E.I.O.U.)

While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage across the world after almost two years, 2021 did prove to be a little better than its predecessor on the calendar and a big reason for that was undoubtedly the return of live music during the second half of this year. For so many of us after being locked down at home, just having the chance to attend a concert or festival in person again provided some sense of normalcy to our everyday lives.\n\nBut as we look forward to hopefully better days in 2022, it’s time for us to unveil our annual “Best of” lists like we have done since this blog first began (see our 2020 picks here). No, we didn’t have time to catch every show or hear all of the albums released in the last 365 days, but forcing ourselves to make difficult decisions can be a fun exercise that helps us reflect on the year in music before turning the page.\n\nSo, without further ado, Showbams presents The Bam Team’s five favorite shows, albums and songs from 2021.\n\nListen to The Bam Team’s favorite songs of 2021:\n\nJosh Herwitt // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2021\n\n1. My Morning Jacket at Santa Barbara Bowl – Santa Barbara, CA – September 23rd\n\nAlmost six years had passed since the last time Jim James and company performed at one of Southern California’s best music venues, but after surviving 18 months without witnessing any live music, the wait for MMJ’s return to the stage felt even longer. Fortunately for us, the Louisville-bred quintet brought its A game to kick off a string of West Coast dates and powered through a collection of 23 songs at the Santa Barbara Bowl that included the emotive “In Color” off the band’s new self-titled album as well as “Where to Begin” from the “Elizabethtown” soundtrack. MMJ have earned a reputation over the years as one of the best live acts still out there, and they certainly validated that claim with a 2.5-hour performance that made the 90-mile drive from LA on a weeknight totally worth it.\n\n2.

The War on Drugs – I Don’t Live Here Anymore\n\nWhat can we say about Adam Granduciel that hasn’t already been said? After composing and producing The War on Drugs’ best material during his previous two trips into the studio with the latter effort winning a Grammy, we knew it would be tough for the Philadelphia native to match that same level of excellence attained in 2014 and 2017 with Lost in the Dream and A Deeper Understanding. And though I Don’t Live Here Anymore doesn’t quite get there, it marks another LP from Granduciel and his cohorts that you can listen straight through from start to finish without skipping a track. Because in an era when our attention spans have been shrunk thanks in large part to technology, that’s something we should all applaud.\n\n2. Modest Mouse – The Golden Casket\n\n3. DARKSIDE – Spiral\n\n4. My Morning Jacket – My Morning Jacket\n\n5. Royal Blood – Typhoons\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2021\n\n1. Royal Blood – “Boilermaker”\n\nThe English alt-rock duo comprised of lead singer/bassist Mike Kerr and drummer Ben Thatcher shared “Boilermaker” in the lead-up to releasing its third full length this year, and the promotional single certainly stands out from the pack as one of the best songs on Typhoons. Produced by Queens of the Stone Age leader Josh Homme, it opens with Kerr’s fuzzed-out riff and quickly builds into a head-banging anthem over the course of three and a half minutes. If you haven’t heard it before, just make sure to also check out the badass music video that’s directed by and stars Liam Lynch. Enjoy!\n\n2. My Morning Jacket – “In Color”\n\n3. Modest Mouse – “Walking and Running”\n\n4. The War on Drugs – “I Don’t Wanna Wait”\n\n5. Bonobo – “Rosewood”\n\nFavorite remix: Four Tet – “Never Come Back” (Caribou)\n\nAndrew Pohl // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2021\n\n1. Kowloon Walled City at The Golden Bull – Oakland, CA – November 30th\n\nRegardless of the fact that I didn’t go to many shows this year, this would have likely been my No. 1 even if I went to more. I had only recently been turned on to Kowloon Walled City, but I was immediately drawn to their heavy sound and they proved to replicate that sonic fury live. The Golden Bull is a nice, intimate setting for live music, and the fact that KWC were able to dial in such a balanced sound at a small club made a huge difference given how BIG they sound on their studio albums. Everyone was fixated on the band throughout its entire set, and I barely noticed anyone looking at a phone — one of the modern-day signs of a great show.\n\n2. Quicksand at Great American Music Hall – San Francisco, CA – October 15th\n\n3. Bad Religion & Alkaline Trio at The Masonic – San Francisco, CA – November 24th\n\n4. The Slackers & The Aggrolites at Cornerstone Berkeley – Berkeley, CA – December 9th\n\n5. Lagwagon with Red City Radio & Decent Criminal at Bottom of the Hill – San Francisco, CA – November 4th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2021\n\n1. Quicksand – Distant Populations\n\nDuring a turbulent time like what we’ve all been collectively experiencing since last year, I think this album resonated with me so much because Quicksand has always been such a solid standby. Distant Populations is heavy in all of the right ways without being abrasive while also effectively showcasing Walter Schreifels’ dynamic song-crafting abilities. Quicksand aren’t necessarily breaking the mold here, but they’re a band that had already set the bar high with their earlier albums and this LP is an excellent continuation of their contribution to the hardcore scene.\n\n2. Turnstile – Glow On\n\n3. IDLES – Crawler\n\n4. Kowloon Walled City – Piecework\n\n5. Snail Mail – Valentine\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2021\n\n1. IDLES – “The Wheel”\n\nI love how IDLES have the ability to take a song about a heavy subject like chemical dependency and turn it into an absolutely infectious banger. “The Wheel” is a perfect example of this, leaving you drawn in and tapping your foot while giving you something to ponder. The way that it can make you feel equal parts uplifted and uncomfortable is part of the appeal to me, and this was easily one of my most played songs of the year.\n\n2. Decent Criminal – “Reap”\n\n3. The Dirty Nil – “Doom Boy”\n\n4. Kills Birds – “Rabbit”\n\n5. Snail Mail – “Valentine”\n\nRochelle Shipman // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2021\n\n1. Adam Schatz at The Gold Room – Los Angeles, CA – November 18th\n\nThe Landlady frontman actually served as the opener on this night, but armed with little more than his saxophone, keyboards and loops, it’s safe to say Schatz stole the entire show. Fresh off a tour playing with Japanese Breakfast, he stepped onstage and quite literally let loose. It was the most refreshing, freeform, organic set full of wit and wonder, offering a sharp reminder why we need to protect the live music space (and to buy the killer album Landlady put out this year, too).\n\n2. Foxx Bodies with Suzie True & Lando Chill at Resident DTLA – Los Angeles, CA – November 7th\n\n3. Islands at Lodge Room – Los Angeles, CA – September 9th\n\n4. Spoon at Teragram Ballroom – Los Angeles, CA – September 28th\n\n5. Armand Hammer & The Alchemist at Echoplex – Los Angeles, CA – September 19th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2021\n\n1. Foxx Bodies – Vixen\n\nThe raw emotions that come through Foxx Bodies’ debut on indie label Kill Rock Stars grabbed me by the ankles and knocked me off my feet the first time I heard it. For an album that explores everything from mental illness, sexual abuse, eating disorders, gender fluidity and beyond, it’s equally shocking how upbeat and uplifting it comes off. It’s part empowering riot grrrl and part rollicking surf punk, full confessional. Trigger warning: it will change your life.\n\n2. Olivia Rodrigo – Sour\n\n3. Tyler, the Creator – Call Me If You Get Lost\n\n4. Backxwash – I LIE HERE BURIED WITH MY RINGS AND MY DRESSES\n\n5. Noga Erez – KIDS\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2021\n\n1. Hiatus Kaiyote – “Red Room”\n\nThis song is the antithesis to 2021. It’s so warm and beautiful, so intimate as though it was conceived in a world where social distancing doesn’t even exist. Nai Palm’s soft, raspy vocals envelop you, and the uncharacteristically subtle sounds (for Hiatus Kaiyote) deliver perhaps the most consistent semblance of peace felt this year.\n\n2. Olivia Rodrigo – “Brutal”\n\n3. Foxx Bodies – “BPD”\n\n4. Yaya Bey – “fxck it then”\n\n5. Little Simz feat. Cleo Sol – “Woman”\n\nFavorite remix: Kari Faux feat. J.I.D – “While God Was Sleepin’… (Remix)”\n\nUm, that’s it? Another year in the rear-view mirror? Where the hell did the last 12 months go? Time sure does seem to fly when there’s so much good new music out there to enjoy.\n\nWith that said, it’s once again time for us to share our annual “Best of” lists like we have done the past few years (see our 2018 picks here). From new emerging artists to reunion tours to the return of rock ‘n’ roll, this year had a little bit of everything for both the casual and passionate music fan. And even if you didn’t have the time to listen to every album that came out (neither did we), that’s why we’re here: to help point you in the right direction whenever you do finally get the chance to dig in.\n\nSo, without further ado, Showbams presents The Bam Team’s five favorite shows, albums and songs from 2019.\n\nSee our favorite performances from 2019 here.\n\nListen to The Bam Team’s favorite songs of 2019:\n\nJosh Herwitt // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2019\n\n1. Tool at Staples Center – Los Angeles, CA – October 20th & 21st\n\nUnlike the delay on Tool’s fifth album Fear Inoculum, I thankfully didn’t have to wait 13 years to see my favorite band perform live. It was only a couple of years ago when I caught the boys at The Gorge, earning top honors as my favorite show in 2017, and subsequently a week later at Glen Helen Amphitheater for an all-day affair with Primus, Clutch, Fantômas, Melvins and The Crystal Method. Perhaps my tastes haven’t changed all that much since then, but even in a year that saw me attend half as many concerts as I usually do, Tool are still finding new and innovative ways to enhance their live show. Whether it’s tinkering with their stage production to incorporate a see-through curtain at times or adding surround sound throughout the arena, a Tool performance has evolved into a spiritual, meditative and almost out-of-body experience over the last decade. It’s no wonder why scoring tickets remains a trial of good fortune.\n\n2. The Raconteurs at Santa Barbara Bowl – Santa Barbara, CA – July 27th\n\n3. The Chemical Brothers at Shrine Expo Hall – Los Angeles, CA – May 15th\n\n4. Jim James & The Claypool Lennon Delirium at The Wiltern – Los Angeles, CA – July 3rd\n\n5. FOALS at Shrine Expo Hall – Los Angeles, CA – March 24th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2019\n\n1. Tool – Fear Inoculum\n\nWhen a three-time Grammy-winning band takes more than a decade to release its next album, it’s only natural for expectations to go through the roof. And I’ll be the first to admit that there was a small seed of doubt in my mind when it came to just how epic Tool’s latest sonic voyage in the studio could and would be. But upon first listen, any uncertainty I had about the merits of Fear Inoculum was quickly dispelled. The title track lures you in from the onset, building to a higher place as Maynard James Keenan (vocals) and company — Adam Jones (guitar), Justin Chancellor (bass) and Danny Carey (drums, percussion) — take listeners on an 80-minute rite of passage that holds up as some of the quartet’s best material in its entire catalog. I just hope they got at least one more LP in them, even if it takes another 13 years to make.\n\n2. The Raconteurs – Help Us Stranger\n\n3. FOALS – Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1\n\n4. The Chemical Brothers – No Geography\n\n5. Black Pumas – Black Pumas\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2019\n\n1. Tool – “Descending”\n\nIf you’re still reading, you’ve probably gotten the hint by now that I’m a big fan of Tool. After all, it only seemed fitting that my top song in 2019 should also come from my No. 1 album of the year by my favorite band over the last two decades. I have seen Tool perform a shortened version of “Descending” several times since 2014, before it ever had an official title, so when Fear Inoculum arrived back in August, there was no track I anticipated hearing more. In fact, at more than 13 minutes long, it’s one that requires your full, undivided attention, which can be a significant amount of time to dedicate in a world of three-minute pop songs and endless distractions now. But for prog-rock enthusiasts like myself who are more than willing to take the ride, “Descending” delivers a total rush of blood to the head that ultimately leads to pure unadulterated euphoria.\n\n2. Bon Iver – “Hey, Ma”\n\n3. Hot Chip – “Hungry Child”\n\n4. FOALS – “On the Luna”\n\n5. Karen O and Danger Mouse – “Turn the Light”\n\nKevin Quandt // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2019\n\n1. Stereolab at Primavera Sound – Barcelona, Spain – June 1st\n\nPrimavera Sound has always had a knack for booking reunions (i.e. Pulp, The Avalanches and Pavement) to its “musical mecca” on the Balearic Sea. 2019’s iteration featured the first proper show in nearly a decade from the anti-capitalist art-pop darlings Stereolab. “Come and Play in the Milky Night” on 1999’s Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night would open the evening to the international consortium of aging music nerds who undoubtedly knew that they were about to be treated to a “best of” set from the English-French outfit. Better yet, their politically themed lyrical content seemed more relevant in 2019 than it was around the time of their creation a quarter-century ago.\n\n2. Mike Dillon’s New Orleans Punk Rock Percussion Consortium at The Music Box Village – New Orleans, LA – April 26th\n\n3. BLACK MIDI at Rickshaw Stop – San Francisco, CA – November 21st\n\n4. Amen Dunes at August Hall – San Francisco, CA – January 10th\n\n5. Ween at Desert Daze – Perris, CA – October 12th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2019\n\n1. Cate Le Bon – Reward\n\nWhat a banner year for the Welsh artist as she created her most highly acclaimed LP to date. Le Bon has truly honed her craft over the last decade as she has collaborated with a laundry list of indie-music royalty before writing the whimsical and austere Reward that employs an array of fresh sounds swirling around her haunting, pixie vocals. 2020 will see Cate jump on tour alongside Kurt Vile in a solo capacity, but we can’t wait to see what she produces next.\n\n2. Wand – Laughing Matter\n\n3. (Sandy) Alex G – House of Sugar\n\n4. The Murder Capital – When I Have Fears\n\n5. Omni – Networker\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2019\n\n1. FOALS – “Sunday”\n\nAs FOALS teeter on the edge of being rock’s next big headliner, the British group semi-quietly unleashed a pair of albums entitled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1 and Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2. While their style continues to hover around math, dance and indie rock, they dig into a deeper realm of sonic atmosphere as frontman Yannis Philippakis questions, even laments, the state of our current times. “Sunday” tends to borrow a tad from the grandiose nature of their fellow Brits in Coldplay before dropping into a four-on-the-floor section that was rather well-received during their March stop at the Fox Theater in Oakland.\n\n2. Crumb – “Ghostride”\n\n3. Vampire Weekend – “Sunflower” feat. Steve Lacy\n\n4. Oh Sees – “Henchlock”\n\n5. Allah-Las – “In the Air”\n\nRochelle Shipman // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2019\n\n1. slowthai at Lodge Room – Los Angeles, CA – September 4th\n\nShortly after releasing his debut album Nothing Great About Britain in May, Tyron Frampton played a few intimate U.S. shows several months later. My guess is that those were probably the last ones he’ll do if the UK rapper out of Northampton continues to rise and deliver, just like he did for much of 2019. Part Johnny Knoxville-type grime smart ass, part brilliant gritty-crust punk, slowthai shook the roof off LA’s Lodge Room, which turned out to be a warm-up show before he returned to play Camp Flog Gnaw in November. Frampton certainly came to please, setting the energy level at 11 and even performing his rowdy hit “Doorman” twice in the set. He could’ve run through it 15 times and the crowd would’ve left just as satisfied.\n\n2. Little Simz at The Echo – Los Angeles, CA – June 13th\n\n3. Taking Back Sunday at Hollywood Palladium – Los Angeles, CA – April 11th\n\n4. Night Moves at The Echo – Los Angeles, CA – September 21st\n\n5. Usher at Smokin Grooves Fest – Long Beach, CA – June 15th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2019\n\n1. Little Simz – GREY Area\n\nThe production. The flow. The bars. The BALLS. Little Simz absolutely brings it on GREY Area, leaving no space for second-guessing, sexist bullshit or honestly anyone else at all. This latest studio album from the British emcee is all her, and you can feel it with every breath she takes. We should all be so lucky to come into our confidence the way that she did on this record, but most of all, we should just be grateful “Simbi” trusts us to keep her deepest secrets — and that they sound so, so good.\n\n2. slowthai – Nothing Great About Britain\n\n3. Shura – forevher\n\n4. Ari Lennox – Shea Butter Baby\n\n5. White Reaper – You Deserve Love\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2019\n\n1. slowthai – “Doorman” (with Mura Masa)\n\nThis song technically dropped in 2018, but its spotlight was shone even wider with slowthai releasing his debut LP this year. The Mura Masa-assisted cut pulses with adrenaline, carries the air of a movie soundtrack in only three minutes and has a beat that will take you all the way to the moon and back. In the words of Lizzo, it’s a whole damn meal!\n\n2. Kari Faux – “Latch Key”\n\n3. Billie Eilish – “bury a friend”\n\n4. Little Simz – “Venom”\n\n5. Smino – “Trina”\n\nAndrew Pohl // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2019\n\n1. IDLES – Fillmore – San Francisco, CA – October 10th\n\nAfter putting out one of my favorite albums from 2018 and missing their show earlier this year, I was thrilled to finally catch IDLES live. To say that these English punk rockers put on a good performance would be a true understatement. They had the energy of an out-of-control freight train but were able to contain it while proving to be an incredibly fun act to see live. Frontman Joe Talbot engaged with the audience in a very authentic way, talking and singing to fans, not just at them. There were crowd-surfing guitarists, mosh pits and sing-a-longs … it was wild.\n\n2. Punk Rock Bowling 2019 – Las Vegas, NV – May 23rd-27th\n\n3. Judas Priest at The Warfield – San Francisco, CA – June 24th\n\n4. Van’s Warped Tour 2019 at Shoreline Amphitheater – Mountain View, CA – July 20th-21st\n\n5. ITCHY-O at Cornerstone – Berkeley, CA – November 23rd\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2019\n\n1. Tool – Fear Inoculum\n\nWell, after all of the waiting and speculation, Tool have done it again, in a really big way. Fear Inoculum is everything that I was hoping it would be, and then some. HUGE-sounding drums, guitars and bass wrap your head in a warm prog blanket while Maynard does what he always has so well. It takes the best parts of their previous albums and combines them to showcase a band that has clearly not missed a step in the 13 years since 10,000 Days.\n\n2. Bad Religion – Age of Unreason\n\n3. Brittany Howard – Jaime\n\n4. Catbite – Catbite\n\n5. Plague Vendor – By Night\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2019\n\n1. The Hammerbombs – “I Hate Cars”\n\nThe Hammerbombs are an undersung Bay Area pop-punk group that have written some of the catchiest and fun songs I have heard from the East Bay scene in a long time. Their 2019 release Goodbye, Dreamboat made my top 10, and this track is the hands-down standout on an album chock-full of toe-tappers. It’s a heartfelt song written by singer and bassist Jen Louie, who has a knack for crafting some really fantastic tunes. The chorus is saccharine sweet, and you can’t help but sing along.\n\n2. Lizzo – “Juice”\n\n3. Bad Religion – “Do The Paranoid Style”\n\n4. Ceremony – “In The Spirit World Now”\n\n5. Lagwagon – “Surviving California”\n\nWe have to be honest: 2018 was kind of a weird year for music. Sure, there were some major highlights — many of them listed below, in fact — but we also saw a serious changing of the guard. The decline of mainstream rock and the continued rise of hip-hop, R&B and pop was more noticeable than ever, from this year’s Coachella lineup to the cancellation of FYF Fest, making us wonder what the next twist or turn will be for the industry now that the demand for EDM has started to cool off following its boom circa 2012. That said, we still listened to a lot of new albums and caught plenty of concerts over the last 12 months, and it’s once again time for us to share our annual “Best of” lists, much like we have done over the past several years (see our 2017 picks here).\n\nSo, without further ado, Showbams presents The Bam Team’s five favorite shows, albums and songs from 2018.\n\nSee our favorite performances from 2018 here.\n\nListen to The Bam Team’s favorite songs of 2018:\n\nJosh Herwitt // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2018\n\n1. Queens of the Stone Age at The Forum – Inglewood, CA – February 17th\n\nJust more than two months after his infamous assault on a photographer at The Forum for KROQ’s Almost Acoustic Christmas, Queens of the Stone Age leader Josh Homme made his return to the LA arena for a proper, sold-out affair with UK rock duo Royal Blood delivering what proved to be a headbanging opening set. From there, it only got better as Homme and the boys dazzled with a headlining performance that even included Villains producer Mark Ronson sitting in for most of the five-song encore and the band’s live debut of its “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” cover. You can bet Elton John, whom Homme actually collaborated with during the writing and recording of QOTSA’s sixth album …Like Clockwork, would have been proud. I always know when I’ve seen a good rock ‘n’ roll show because my neck will be sore the following day, but after this one, it was sore for the next three days. Ouch.\n\n2. Nine Inch Nails at Hollywood Palladium – Los Angeles, CA – December 12th, 14th-15th\n\n3. Jamiroquai at Coachella, Weekend 1 – Indio, CA – April 13th\n\n4. David Byrne at Santa Barbara Bowl – Santa Barbara, CA – August 24th\n\n5. Foo Fighters/Nirvana reunion at Cal Jam 18 – San Bernadino, CA – October 6th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2018\n\n1. Jungle – For Ever\n\nUnlike previous years, picking a favorite album in 2018 wasn’t quite as easy for me. I’ll admit that I didn’t hear every one that was released this year, but I listened to a lot of them. So, call me boring and short-sighted if you like, but nothing totally knocked my socks off. After much deliberation, it was Jungle’s sophomore LP For Ever that stood the test of time for me (no pun intended). The English soul collective’s follow-up to its 2014 self-titled debut doesn’t veer off in a completely different direction from what came before, but it still moves the sonic needle forward enough. After two full lengths, Jungle have shown a knack for writing catchy, dance-fueled tunes that transport you to a different time and place — even if it’s only for a three- or four-minute stretch.\n\n2. Khruangbin – Con Todo El Mundo\n\n3. Arctic Monkeys – Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino\n\n4. Kamasi Washington – Heaven and Earth\n\n5. Big Red Machine – Big Red Machine\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2018\n\n1. Nine Inch Nails – “Over and Out”\n\nWhen I first listened to Bad Witch, I immediately knew this one was my favorite track on the album. But hearing it performed live on the final night of NIN’s “Cold and Black and Infinite” North American tour sealed it for top honors in 2018. Layering a brooding, yet funky bass line on top of a glitchy, experimental beat, Trent Reznor shows that he isn’t just playing it safe and merely saving his creativity for scoring films with bandmate and longtime collaborator Atticus Ross. You can tell Reznor had his late friend David Bowie in mind when he wrote the song too as he conjures up an even deeper baritone from behind the microphone than the one we have come to know over the last 30 years.\n\n2. Childish Gambino – “This Is America”\n\n3. Jungle – “Heavy, California”\n\n4. Wild Nothing – “Partners in Motion”\n\n5. The Raconteurs – “Now That You’re Gone”\n\nMolly Kish // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2018\n\n1. David Byrne at Fox Theater Oakland – Oakland, CA – August 16th\n\nIn support of his seventh solo album American Utopia, musical virtuoso David Byrne hit the road for one of this year’s most creative and ambitious tours. Over more than 150 dates that spanned the entire globe, the 66-year-old delivered Broadway-caliber performances with a traveling 11-piece band that served as a traveling retrospective of his solo and collaborative work. Meanwhile, the tour also doubled as a platform for him to deliver his “Reasons to Be Cheerful” manifestos on civic engagement, climate/energy, culture, economics, education, health, science/technology and urban transportation. He partnered with HeadCount while encouraging audiences every night to engage in public discourse through social media and their own personal stories on his website. And as a result, Byrne elevated the concert-going experience into more of an interactive, performance-art space that his fans became a living, breathing part of.\n\n2. Young Fathers at The Independent – San Francisco, CA – November 10th\n\n3. Erykah Badu & Thundercat at The Armory – San Francisco, CA – February 14th\n\n4. Beck at The Independent – San Francisco, CA – August 8th\n\n5. LCD Soundsystem with TV on the Radio at Greek Theatre Berkeley – Berkeley, CA – April 27th-28th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2018\n\n1. Richard Russell – Everything Is Recorded by Richard Russell\n\nA multi-artist project released as the debut album of XL Recordings founder Richard Russell, Everything Is Recorded is collaborative effort representing the ties between past and present sounds currently shaping the framework of hip-hop, funk and soul. Featuring collaborations with Sampha, Kamasi Washington, Syd, Damon Albarn, Peter Gabriel, Ibeyi, Obongjayar and more, the album also plays as the soundtrack to a 30-minute film, which documents the time each spent in the studio during its conception and is interspliced with archival footage of Gil Scott-Heron and Curtis Mayfield. With its underlying themes of loss and isolation, Everything Is Recorded effectively communicates Russell’s emotional journey as he battles a debilitating autoimmune disease in hope of finding salvation through the shared experience of creating a beautifully mastered piece of art.\n\n2. George Fitzgerald – All That Must Be\n\n3. Pusha T – DAYTONA\n\n4. Robyn – Honey\n\n5. Khruangbin – Con Todo El Mundo\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2018\n\n1. Childish Gambino – “This Is America”\n\nIf any song embodied the insanity and collective discontent of 2018, it was definitely Childish Gambino’s epic single “This Is America”. The juxtaposition of an a cappella choir leading into Donald Glover’s soft crooning over island beats and drum samples before staunchly diverting to a menacing base line reminiscent of 90’s gangster rap — as well as the hortative delivery of degrading lyrics about the current state of violence and American ideals — is near-perfect. Of course, the provocative music video that accompanied the track’s surprise release during his “Saturday Night Live” debut was incredible. The song, lyrics, video and marketing campaign could not have been a more flawless “slice of life” reflection of modern American society and justifiably has boomeranged into probably the most important moment of Childish Gambino’s career so far.\n\n2. The Presets – “Downtown Shutdown”\n\n3. Jon Hopkins – “Everything Connected”\n\n4. Jungle – “Casio”\n\n5. Parquet Courts – “Wide Awake”\n\nKevin Quandt // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2018\n\n1. David Byrne at Jazzfest – New Orleans, LA – April 29th\n\nYou know what they say: the first time is always the best. With David Byrne’s 2018 “American Utopia Tour” being universally acclaimed as one of the most enigmatic live shows of the year, it’s not surprising to see it top other “Best of” lists. Byrne and his merry band of “unplugged” pranksters created a feast for the eyes and ears, and his daytime set on the Gentilly Stage did not disappoint at all. While his Fox Theater Oakland shows were more intimate and featured some more dynamic lighting features, his performance at Jazzfest back in April was the most memorable for NOLA revelers.\n\n2. Jamiroquai at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium – San Francisco, CA – April 17th\n\n3. Polo & Pan at The Independent – San Francisco, CA – June 20th\n\n4. Nine Inch Nails at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium – San Francisco, CA – December 4th\n\n5. Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever at Primavera Sound – Barcelona, Spain – June 2nd\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2018\n\n1. Khruangbin – Con Todo El Mundo\n\nWhat a banner year for this Texas trio! Khruangbin have been on a steady rise the past few years as they turn on the masses to their infectious amalgamation of psychedelic soul, Thai surf rock and subtle funk. Having cemented their reputation as beasts in a live setting, Con Todo El Mundo proved their knack for penning tunes of equal strength with its emotive first single “Friday Morning” serving as a clear standout. “Evan Finds the Third Room” has also become a fan favorite, and the accompanying music video only lends to its growing charm. The sky’s the limit for Laura, Mark and DJ, so grab your ticket to fly.\n\n2. Hookworms – Microshift\n\n3. Amen Dunes – Freedom\n\n4. Shame – Songs of Praise\n\n5. Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks – Sparkle Hard\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2018\n\n1. Jonathan Wilson – “Trafalgar Square”\n\nLA producer-turned-frontman Jonathan Wilson churned out one helluva album opener for his third solo LP Rare Birds, as this six-plus-minute romp has all the right pieces for true liftoff. A proper intro leads into a riff so heavy that it’ll break your mama’s back. Top-notch production is key to this track, as Wilson is a wiz behind the boards. As you cruise down the 405 with this whopper blaring, you’d be hard-pressed not to nod along. Extra points for those of you with a 1970’s convertible, too.\n\n2. Tom Misch – “Water Baby” feat.

The Smashing Pumpkins at Oracle Arena – Oakland, CA – August 27th\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins are the quintessential 90’s arena-rock band, and they fully lived up to that billing at Oracle Arena for their Bay Area stop over the summer. I’ve seen them several times over the years, and although this time it was pegged as a “reunion tour” (minus D’Arcy, sigh), you never know what you’re going to get from them. Billy Corgan led the band through over three hours’ worth of material with some killer stage production to go with it. The show was definitely a marathon, but totally worth being there for. It came to light later that Corgan was also fighting off a bad case of food poisoning, but it didn’t show. It was great to see James Iha and Jimmy Chamberlain back onstage, too — the way it should be.\n\n2. Nine Inch Nails at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium – San Francisco, CA – December 3rd\n\n3. Against Me! & Turbonegro at UC Theatre – Berkeley, CA – May 25th\n\n4. Alkaline Trio at The Warfield – San Francisco, CA – October 6th\n\n5. Back To The Beach Festival – Huntington Beach, CA – April 28th-29th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2018\n\n1. Shame – Songs of Praise\n\nThis album hit me like a ton of bricks in the best way. I had heard a ton of hype around Songs of Praise before giving it a first listen, and usually I am a healthy skeptic, but good Lord, does this record rip. It has a dark flavor and carries with it a lot of angst, and you can’t help but get caught up in the hooks that Shame offer. These five lads from South London simply killed it.\n\n2. IDLES – Joy as an Act of Resistance\n\n3. Kamasi Washington – Heaven and Earth\n\n4. Hot Snakes – Jericho Sirens\n\n5. Snail Mail – Lush\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2018\n\n1. Shame – “Concrete”\n\nConjuring up the ghost of Joy Division’s Ian Curtis without sounding like a complete poser is challenging for newer post-punk bands it seems — except for Shame’s Charlie Steen. Paired with some brilliant instrumentation, I just couldn’t stop listening to “Concrete” when I first heard it. I must have listened to the track a solid 10 times in a row on the first go. This song has an infectious quality to it and is a straight-up ripper.\n\n2. The Soft White Sixties – “I Still Love You, San Francisco”\n\n3. Hot Snakes – “Six Wave Hold-Down”\n\n4. IDLES – “Colossus”\n\n5. The Sword – “Come and Gone”\n\nPhotos courtesy of Jack White // Written by Josh Herwitt //\n\nJack White with William Tyler //\n\nSanta Barbara Bowl – Santa Barbara, CA\n\nAugust 19th, 2018 //\n\nIn case you haven’t heard, Jack White isn’t the biggest fan of technology. Well, at least when it comes to some modern technological advancements.\n\nSure, White has been a self-proclaimed fan of Tesla for quite a while now. He was one of the first Model S owners in Nashville, which the Detroit native has called home since 2006, and just a couple weeks ago visited the company’s factory in Fremont, Calif., where he played a private show for its employees.\n\nBut the former White Stripes leader, whose old-timey passions for vinyl records, baseball and furniture upholstery are well-documented, doesn’t view mobile technology in nearly the same way. In fact, he never really has.\n\nWhite first started to make his disdain for cell phones publicly known in 2014. At the time, he didn’t even own one himself (and he still doesn’t from what he told Rolling Stone in March for the magazine’s cover story). That same year, on the day he gave us his sophomore solo album Lazaretto, I caught White’s show at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles. It was there that one of his stagehands stepped to the mic minutes before the performance and politely requested that we refrain from using our cell phones, and while most of the sold-out crowd seemed to oblige, there were some who still couldn’t help themselves.\n\nPics or it didn’t happen, right?\n\nSince then, our lives have only become more centered around our Instagram feeds, and for as cynical as it sounds, it’s probably only going to get worse from here on out.\n\nIt’s why White announced before kicking off a world tour this year in support of his third LP Boarding House Reach that all of his non-festival dates would be phone-free. But what does that actually mean?\n\nAdopting the same methods that stand-up comedians Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle have employed for their own gigs, White partnered with Yondr, a San Francisco-based company that creates mobile phone pouches with a proprietary lock. Upon entering the venue, your phone is placed in one of their pouches and then locked. If you need to use your phone for any reason during the show, the pouch can be unlocked at one of several designated areas inside the venue. Think of them as smoking sections but for phones. That’s how powerful, and simultaneously obnoxious, smartphones have become for fans and musicians such as White, who has said that he relies on human connection and fan interaction to help guide him through his always-unplanned setlists. For the 12-time Grammy winner, the myriad of distractions that an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy offers is not only disruptive, but it’s also a major obstacle in trying to hold a person’s attention for any extended period of time. And, quite honestly, I can’t blame White for implementing the ban. If we could control our own impulses, then he simply wouldn’t have to do it for us.\n\nIt hasn’t exactly hurt him either. You can say what you want about his cell-phone policy, but White has sold out the majority of his U.S. dates over the past four months while headlining many of the country’s most popular music festivals, including Shaky Knees, Boston Calling, Governors Ball, Lollapalooza and Arroyo Seco Weekend (read our review here) this summer.\n\nSo, on a warm, mid-August night in Southern California, White paid his first official visit to Santa Barbara. The White Stripes, somewhat surprisingly, didn’t make it to the coastal city during their 15 years together, so White’s show at the always-stunning Santa Barbara Bowl seemed well overdue for one of rock’s last remaining guitar heroes. The amphitheater at a capacity of 4,562 stacks up as one of our favorite places in all of California to see live music (read our First Times review here), even with the shows running on a tight schedule due to some strict curfew laws until 10 p.m. That’s not necessarily a bad thing for those of us who live in LA, considering that the drive back is often no more than 90 minutes at that time of night. But with White’s sold-out show in Santa Barbara falling on a Sunday evening, those who showed up made it clear that they weren’t ready for the weekend to end.\n\nBoarding House Reach has drawn its fair share of critics, and I couldn’t necessarily disagree with many of the album reviews that I read when it was released in March. It’s undoubtedly White’s weakest studio effort to date — and I admit that as a big fan — but that’s not to say I don’t commend him for trying something new or different. Plus, I’ve come to realize that the more experimental songs like “Corporation”, “Respect Commander” and “Ice Station Zebra” play much better live than they do on the record.\n\nYet, for as eclectic and wide-ranging as White’s output has been over two decades, it’s the unpredictable nature of his live shows that makes them so intriguing to see. This time, we were treated to a rare cover of The Stooges’ “T.V. Eye” from their 1970 album Fun House, as well as a number of fan favorites, from set closer “Ball and Biscuit” to an eight-song encore that featured “Icky Thump” (with some amusing “Icky Trump” messaging), “Steady, as She Goes” (with a snippet of Richard Berry’s 1955 song “Louie Louie”), and of course, what has easily become the biggest stadium anthem in the world, “Seven Nation Army”. And though the show didn’t conclude without a few hiccups during some of White’s improvised playing between songs, he hasn’t lost his unique ability to surprise an audience — whether it means bringing out his mother in Detroit to perform “Hotel Yorba” with him or covering Pearl Jam’s “Daughter” in Seattle — at any given moment, especially when we all aren’t staring down at our phones.\n\nSetlist:\n\nOver and Over and Over\n\nCorporation\n\nDead Leaves and the Dirty Ground (The White Stripes song)\n\nMissing Pieces\n\nLazaretto\n\nHotel Yorba (The White Stripes song)\n\nWhy Walk a Dog?\n\nCannon (The White Stripes song)\n\nBroken Boy Soldier (The Raconteurs song)\n\nRespect Commander\n\nDo (The White Stripes song)\n\nT.V.

Well, while we’re still wondering where the past 12 months have went, 2016 proved to be bittersweet for the entire music community. With David Bowie, Glenn Frey, Paul Kanter, Phife Dawg, Merle Haggard, Prince, Leonard Cohen, Sharon Jones and most recently George Michael all leaving us too soon, it’s been a rough ride to say the least. But amid all the heartbreak, we experienced plenty of amazing moments in music from January to December, and now it’s time for us to once again unveil our annual “Best of” lists just like we did in 2015.\n\nSo, without further ado, Showbams presents The Bam Team’s five favorite shows, albums and songs from 2016.\n\nThe 25 Best Live Music Acts of 2016\n\nListen to The Bam Team’s favorite songs of 2016:\n\nJosh Herwitt // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2016\n\n1. LCD Soundsystem at Coachella Music and Arts Festival, Weekend 1 – Indio, CA – April 8th\n\nWhen reports started swirling around this time last year that LCD Soundsystem would reunite to headline Coachella a few months later, it was a chance to relive that one time I saw them on the same polo fields six years earlier — the only time I was lucky enough to see James Murphy and company in action before they called it quits way too early. And while band reunions at Coachella are starting to feel like a gimmick these days, LCD had already played a couple of warm-up shows back home in New York by the time they stepped foot on the main stage for their highly anticipated headlining set at the Empire Polo Club. They didn’t perform any new material like some fans may have hoped they would, but rather a setlist laced with hits that also included their live debut of David Bowie’s “Heroes” as well as a nod to fellow headliner Guns N’ Roses. And as the final words to “All My Friends” left Murphy’s mouth that night, I walked away still buzzing from what I had just witnessed.\n\n2. Radiohead at Shrine Auditorium – Los Angeles, CA – August 8th\n\n3. Jim James at Orpheum Theatre – Los Angeles, CA – December 9th\n\n4. Temple of the Dog at The Forum – Inglewood, CA – November 14th\n\n5. Pretty Lights (Live) at Santa Barbara Bowl – Santa Barbara, CA – November 10th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2016\n\n1. Moderat – III\n\nWith so many excellent albums being released each year, picking a favorite is never an easy task — but this year felt even more difficult than usual. And although I’ll admit I didn’t have time to hear every LP that dropped in 2016, it was hard not to choose Moderat’s latest studio effort after much thought and consideration. Time after time, I found myself coming back to III after countless listens. From the record’s opening track “Eating Hooks” to its initial single “Reminder”, the Berlin trio seems to get better and better with each release. As difficult as it can be to describe Moderat’s music, there’s something about the way Sascha Ring’s emotive vocals pair perfectly with the supergroup’s haunting melodies that makes III‘s repeatability incredibly strong. I guess the third time really is the charm for these three gents.\n\n2. Jim James – Eternally Even\n\n3. Anderson .Paak – Malibu\n\n4. Radiohead – A Moon Shaped Pool\n\n5. Kendrick Lamar – untitled unmastered\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2016\n\n1. Jim James – “Here in Spirit”\n\nMy Morning Jacket frontman Jim James often receives praise for his unique singing style, but the Louisville native’s songwriting chops remain equally impressive. On his sophomore solo album Eternally Even, James takes a more political stance than what he devised for his 2013 debut Regions of Light and Sound of God. What results is some of James’ most poignant and inspiring material to date, including the soulfully psychedelic cut “Here in Spirit” that bats third in the LP’s nine-track lineup. With lines like “No compromise / But willing to sacrifice / Believe what you want / Go on and be who you are / Go out and get what you want” to open the song, James empowers his listeners to not sit on the sidelines and instead, speak up for what they believe in. He might not be able to solve the world’s problems, but “Yim Yames” knows how to make you think about the issues that matter.\n\n2. Moderat – “Reminder”\n\n3. Glass Animals – “Youth”\n\n4. Tycho – “Division”\n\n5. Run the Jewels – “Legend Has It”\n\nMolly Kish // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2016\n\n1. Brainfeeder at Fox Theater Oakland – Oakland, CA – September 15th\n\nThis showcase featuring artists from Flying Lotus’ label, including himself, was an experience to behold. No matter who you went to see on this night, eyes were opened and brains were fed — so to speak — thanks to the sonic diversions that continue to make Brainfeeder one of the most important players in shaping the future of music.\n\n2. Danny Brown at The Regency Ballroom – San Francisco, CA – October 11th\n\n3. James Blake at Fox Theater Oakland – Oakland, CA – October 17th\n\n4. Erykah Badu at The Warfield – San Francisco, CA – November 15th\n\n5. Black Madonna at Public Works SF – San Francisco, CA – November 18th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2016\n\n1. Anderson .Paak – Malibu\n\nElevating the current state of hip-hop by ultimately bringing it back to its jazz roots, Malibu finally brought Anderson .Paak the credit he sorely deserved. The 16-track album boasts an intricately curated, eclectic roster of recording, production and songwriting talent. Easily the most important sophomore full-length release of the year, Malibu opened a brand-new door to a musical stratosphere that .Paak was born to commandeer.\n\n2. Kendrick Lamar – untitled unmastered\n\n3. Kanye West – The Life of Pablo\n\n4. The Avalanches – Wildflower\n\n5. A Tribe Called Quest – We Got It From Here… Thank You 4 Your Service\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2016\n\n1. Solange – “Cranes in the Sky”\n\nAnother career-skyrocketing release of 2016 that was introduced to the world through this single, “Cranes in the Sky” helped bring attention to “the younger Knowles sister” as a force to be reckoned with. Amidst a track list of powerful ballads and political anthems, this song delivers a personal testimony of introspection that humanizes Solange in a way most artists are too afraid to convey. The track, which was delivered through a series of avant-garde music videos, shook the world of modern soul and R&B with one of 2016’s most influential power moves.\n\n2. Chance the Rapper – “All Night”\n\n3. Blood Orange – “Best to You”\n\n4. Kaytranada – “LITE SPOTS”\n\n5. Flume – “Never Be Like You” feat. Kai\n\nJoseph Gray // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2016\n\n1. Kanye West at The Forum – Inglewood, CA – November 1st\n\nPrior to its bizarre, abrupt ending that included a long-winded tirade critical of Beyoncé and some outspoken support for President-elect Donald Trump, Kanye West’s “Saint Pablo Tour” was a once-in-a-lifetime party. Seriously. In LA, the show featured a floating, illuminated and spaceship-like stage that traveled back and forth — while raging youngsters moshed below — to give everybody a great view of their favorite contradiction and/or superhero, who was later hospitalized due to a reported “psychiatric emergency.” With the elevated platform, a smiling and dancing West manned through his conflicts, happiness and faith, reminding us of why he provides the unmistakable feel-good vibes that only he can bring.\n\n2. Young Thug at The Fonda Theatre – Los Angeles, CA – May 16th\n\n3. Isaiah Rashad at Echoplex – Los Angeles, CA – November 14th\n\n4. Jhene Aiko at Avalon Hollywood – Los Angeles, CA – November 21st\n\n5. YG at The Wiltern – Los Angeles, CA – November 29th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2016\n\n1. Anderson .Paak – Malibu\n\nThe unearthed gem on rap legend Dr. Dre’s long-awaited Compton opus a year prior, Southern California rapper, singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist (he really does it all) Anderson .Paak kicked open the door to his fully-formed world of warm, unbridled expressiveness and raspy soul with Malibu. Brilliantly combining funk and jazz-filled triumphs (“Come Down”) and hip-hop’s reflective grit (“The Season/Carry Me”) with distinct and sprawling elegance (“Room in Here”), .Paak unquestionably put his mark on 2016. A detailed dot (just like the one in .Paak’s moniker), you better not forget it because Malibu proved that you have to pay attention to everything his name is attached to.\n\n2. A Tribe Called Quest – We Got It From Here… Thank You 4 Your Service\n\n3. Young Thug – Jeffery\n\n4. NxWorries – Yes Lawd!\n\n5. Kanye West – The Life of Pablo\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2016\n\n1. A Tribe Called Quest – “We the People…”\n\nIn a year drenched in political prejudices and panic for many citizens in the U.S., Q-Tip roared through the darkness over the funkiest of synths: “We don’t believe you ’cause we the people / Are still here in the rear / Yo, we don’t need you.” A message that echoed even louder after the presidential election, one of the standouts tracks from their celebrated final LP We Got It From Here… Thank You 4 Your Service invigorates a culture seemingly under attack more than ever.\n\n2. Anderson .Paak – “Come Down”\n\n3. Kanye West – “Real Friends”\n\n4. Anderson .Paak – “Room in Here” feat. The Game & Sonyae Elise\n\n5. Kendrick Lamar – “untitled 07 | 2014 – 2016”\n\nBrett Ruffenach // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2016\n\n1. Kanye West at T-Mobile Arena – Las Vegas, NV – October 29th\n\nIn some ways, there’s an unspoken hierarchy to the live-concert experience. The structure is simple — the closer you are to the front of the stage, the better your experience is, the bigger the fan that you are. Only the “rail riders” are the truest fans. In my experience seeing Kanye West’s “Saint Pablo Tour” in Las Vegas — a performance that ended up being one of his last uninterrupted shows prior to a breakdown and a subsequent cancellation of several future dates — he not only completely destroyed the hierarchy, he reinvented what a concert can be. Under a floodlight-filled sky, he spent 90 minutes on a floating stage playing a nonstop show that brought out a level of hype in the crowd I’m not sure I’ve ever seen before. On the floor, underneath the stage, you are instantly a part of the performance. As the stage moved back and forth across the arena, West captured a sense of connection with fans, making it nearly impossible to not scream every damn word to every damn song. It was an emotional roller coaster filled with adrenaline (“Black Skinhead”, “Father Stretch My Hands”), joy (“Waves”, “Fade”), swagger (“Can’t Tell Me Nothing”, “Heartless”) and some transcendent moments so intense during reworked songs like “Only One” and “Ultralight Beam” that many in the crowd (myself included) couldn’t help but be brought to tears. I’ve never seen a concert like this one and will probably never see something like it again. But for those 90 minutes as I jumped and sang with my brothers and friends, there was no world outside of Kanye’s floating stage. It’s a memory that I will cherish for the rest of my life as Kanye proved to us there is no hip-hop artist in the world doing what he’s doing.\n\n2. LCD Soundsystem at Coachella Music and Arts Festival, Weekend 1 – Indio, CA – April 8th\n\n3. Beyoncé at Levi’s Stadium – Santa Clara, CA – May 16th\n\n4. Tame Impala at Greek Theatre Berkeley – Berkeley, CA – September 3rd\n\n5. Air at Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival – San Francisco, CA – August 6th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2016\n\n1. The Avalanches – Wildflower\n\nI really enjoy albums that can be experienced as one cohesive piece. Twelve years in the making, The Avalanches’ Wildflower is best experienced in one listen from start to finish. Using a near-plethora of samples from both ends of the musical spectrum, the Australian plunderphonics pioneers wove together a soundscape that’s not only textured and groovy, but also just plain old fun. From “Because I’m Me” and “Frankie Sanatra” to “Subways” and “If I Was a Folkstar”, the feel and experience of listening to Wildflower simply fills me with joy. After a year like 2016, it’s something we all needed.\n\n2. Radiohead – A Moon Shaped Pool\n\n3. Beyoncé – Lemonade\n\n4. Anderson .Paak – Malibu\n\n5. The Range – Potential\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2016\n\n1. Radiohead – “Present Tense”\n\nIn a serene moment watching Thom Yorke and Co. play a live rendition of “Present Tense” at Outside Lands, I first thought to myself that this may be one of Radiohead’s best tracks. Ever. Their stripped-down rendition featuring Johnny Greenwood solidified that thought. “Present Tense” seems to capture all of the things I find most appealing about Radiohead: complex and beautiful chord progressions, subtle and complimentary percussion, and melancholy lyrics and ambient sounds creating a sense of space that no other band I know is capable of producing in a studio or on a stage. It’s an introspective song that blooms into a plea for a return to what was once had with “in you I’m lost …” That melody gives me goosebumps every time.\n\n2. Blood Orange – “Best to You”\n\n3. Brian Eno – “Fickle Sun (iii) I’m Set Free”\n\n4. Hundred Waters feat. Chance the Rapper – “Show Me Love”\n\n5. DJ Shadow feat. Run the Jewels – “Nobody Speak”\n\nRochelle Shipman // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2016\n\n1. Anderson .Paak & the Free Nationals at South by Southwest – Austin, TX – March 18th\n\nAnderson .Paak played 13 shows in three or four days at SXSW this year. The Pandora show was one of his last ones, so he and his bandmates had their set down to blind perfection and played their hearts out to 150 new fans as the sun went down. Austin was falling in love with .Paak right in front of his eyes, electrifying his performance and even bringing him down into the audience to crowd surf. When he wasn’t behind the drums, he spent the rest of the show dancing on the monitors in between the barrier and the stage, seemingly as close to is fansh as possible. He was just grateful to be there, and it spilled from every ounce of his body. I’m going to be completely honest: I went to SXSW this year to see .Paak because I knew once he played it, tickets to his shows would be impossible to get. Six months later, $30 tickets to his show in San Francisco at The Fillmore resold for upwards of $400. If you didn’t have another way to get into that show or rent to pay, it was worth it. The energy that comes out of .Paak while he’s performing is charming, infectious and unmatched. He splits his time roaming every inch of the stage and behind his drum set, often singing and rapping without missing a beat. At .Paak’s December show at the Hollywood Palladium in LA, Stevie Wonder came out not to sing, but to tell the crowd what a big fan he is. So basically, Stevie Wonder dropped by. OK, Anderson … we see you.\n\n2. Conor Oberst at The Cathedral Sanctuary at Immanuel Presbyterian Church – Los Angeles, CA – December 17th\n\n3. Chance the Rapper at Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival – San Francisco, CA – August 7th\n\n4. Islands at Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever Cemetery – Los Angeles, CA – June 9th\n\n5. Animal Collective at Scala – London, UK – September 8th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2016\n\n1. Anderson .Paak – Malibu\n\nAnderson .Paak has put out a lot of material, even before he was Anderson .Paak and went by Breezy Lovejoy. There are gems sprinkled throughout his early releases, but his latest studio album has a funky backbone that lets .Paak explore aspects of his range that he never shared before. It resulted in a rhythmic, emotional journey that’s flirty, genre-defiant and fun as fuck. Malibu nearly ruined music for me because nothing else is it.\n\n2. Vince Staples – Prima Donna\n\n3. Conor Oberst – Ruminations\n\n4. Gallant – Ology\n\n5. Noname – Telefone\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2016\n\n1. Childish Gambino – “Redbone”\n\nI like Childish Gambino. I’ve always liked Childish Gambino. But the first time I heard his song “Redbone”, every hair on my body stood up and started grooving. It happened the second time and the third time, and even the 643rd time. And this dude is singing about peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool Aid, but because of how he’s singing about it, it’s somehow OK. I made a playlist with only this song on it 20 times over and it was still too short.\n\n2. Anderson .Paak – “The Waters”\n\n3. Sonder – “Too Fast”\n\n4. Danny Brown – “Really Doe” feat. Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul & Earl Sweatshirt\n\n5. Mac Miller – “Dang!” feat. Anderson .Paak\n\nAndrew Pohl // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2016\n\n1. The Cure at Shoreline Amphitheater – Mountain View, CA – May 26th\n\nI saw a ton of amazing shows this year, but seeing The Cure for the first time on my birthday topped them all. For more than three hours I got to catch Robert Smith and company churn out hit after hit, and hanging out with some of my best mates only added to the splendor. A setlist that spanned their entire career on a beautiful evening was just what I needed for my 38th trip around the sun.\n\n2. Tool at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium – San Francisco, CA – January 7th\n\n3. At the Drive-In at The Warfield – San Francisco, CA – June 4th\n\n4.

A Tribe Called Quest – We Got It From Here… Thank You 4 Your Service\n\nThis is the album that we needed, and it was delivered at the right time, in the right way. For a year that had taken so much away from the music world, ATCQ surprised everyone with an LP that delivered a vibrant, thoughtful and politically charged gift to the masses. No guys, thank YOU for your service (RIP Phife Dawg).\n\n2. Mitski – Puberty 2\n\n3. David Bowie – Black Star\n\n4. Mall Walk – Funny Papers\n\n5. Tycho – Epoch\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2016\n\n1. David Bowie – “Lazarus”\n\nOh, Bowie … even on the eve of your own passing, you knew how to pull out all of the stops and push your art to the limit. A true showman and artist to the end, this song encapsulates all that is raw, beautiful and bizarre about our beloved Ziggy Stardust. Its somber tone is met with a sexy, sinister groove, which leaves you with a sense of unease and is honestly perfect in my opinion. Thank you, sir. RIP.\n\n2. Bob Moses – “Tearing Me Up”\n\n3. Savages – “Evil”\n\n4. Zack de la Rocha – “digging for windows”\n\n5. Deep Sea Diver – “Secrets”\n\nBy Josh Herwitt //\n\nPretty Lights (Live) with Big Wild, Chris Karns //\n\nSanta Barbara Bowl – Santa Barbara, CA\n\nNovember 10th, 2016 //\n\nAmid the myriad of tragedies that the music industry has endured in 2016, one of the major talking points has been the future of electronic dance music. EDM, as the kids like to call it these days, experienced a meteoric rise just a few years ago as laptops replaced turntables and guitars, transforming DJs into music’s newest and biggest rock stars with multimillion-dollar residencies in Las Vegas and headlining slots at music festivals all around the world.\n\nBut in the last eight months, the genre’s sustainability has started to be called into question, with several media outlets predicting that the EDM boom will soon come crashing down. One well-known music website, for instance, published an in-depth look at EDM’s demise back in April, already declaring it a thing of the past with a title like “Popping the Drop: A Timeline of How EDM’s Bubble Burst.” Soon after, LA Weekly followed suit, continuing the conversation with their own piece on why an industry worth $6.9 billion only a year ago has fallen so fast. Of course, it should also be noted that Forbes was the first to tap into the subject, exploring how the proliferation of EDM festivals in the U.S. hasn’t always equaled massive payouts for some concert promoters.\n\nStill, for a culture born out of the UK’s underground rave scene, it shouldn’t be too surprising to hear that the EDM business has reached its ceiling. From simply a spectators’ point of view, watching someone entertain an audience with a computer and a mixer can only be engaging for so long, even if the song selection and stage production are superb (it can also depend on if any mind-altering substances were ingested at the time). That’s not to say dance music can’t or won’t survive. As oversaturated as the market is right now, there will always be a thirst for music that can make you move — it’s more that the genre will continue to evolve in new and different ways. And if there’s one electronic artist whom others should look to for inspiration, it’s unquestionably Pretty Lights.\n\nPraised by legendary record producer Rick Rubin as “the face and voice of the new American electronic music scene,” Derek Vincent Smith started out making music under his Pink Floyd-inspired moniker with his close friend and frequent collaborator Michal Menert more than a decade ago. But unlike so many of his contemporaries, the Colorado native was carving his own path in his early 20’s. Influenced by hip-hop groups from the Beastie Boys and A Tribe Called Quest to Wu-Tang Clan and The Roots, Smith got his big break opening for jam bands like Sound Tribe Sector 9 (STS9), The Disco Biscuits and Widespread Panic at their late-night, after-party shows. Employing a colorful patchwork of hip-hop breakbeats and soul samples to build the foundation for his tracks, Smith’s process as well as his music in many ways felt like an extension of the classic trip-hop that DJ Shadow pioneered in 1996 with his seminal debut LP Endtroducing….. and RJD2 (read our interview with him here) later furthered on his initial studio album Deadringer.\n\nPretty Lights’ rise to stardom didn’t happen overnight. Releasing his music for free on his own record label Pretty Lights Music, it took years for Smith to build the worldwide following that he has today. Yet, what has always made him more than just merely a “DJ” or a “producer” is his propensity for incorporating live instrumentation into his live performances. By the time he began touring in 2007, he had enlisted drummer Cory Eberhard to join him for a run that would eventually include important U.S. festival appearances at Coachella and Ultra in 2010. Smith would go on to replace Eberhard with Adam Deitch, and while Deitch’s commitment to his other projects (Break Science, Lettuce) has curtailed his involvement in more recent years, he served as a key ingredient during the recording sessions for 2013’s A Color Map of the Sun, which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Dance/Electronica Album.\n\nSince then, Smith has made a conscious effort to bring other talented musicians into the fray. Touring with a live band for the first time in 2013 — something that few other EDM artists have done to this day — he quickly changed the way electronic music can be experienced live. Fast forward to last Thursday, and we were once again treated to an electrifying Pretty Lights show that was more than just Smith behind a pair of Macbook Pros and two Akai MPD32s. Making his debut at the majestic Santa Barbara Bowl, he once again showed why he isn’t your typical EDM act. With Chris Karns and Big Wild providing support, Smith hit the stage at 8 p.m. with his bandmates — Karns, Borham Lee, Brandon Butler and Alvin Ford, Jr. — and put on a show that dazzled both sonically and visually. What was most impressive, though, was seeing how much of the performance was improvised, as the band transitioned from one jam to another while dropping in a number of remixes here and there. And as I looked on from my seat in the stands, I couldn’t help but think about how much the show reminded me of all the times I’ve seen STS9 perform live. It only seemed fitting considering that the livetronia band helped give Smith his start back in the day, and with the “EDM bubble” about to burst (that is, if it hasn’t already), it’s hopefully an approach more electronic artists will gravitate toward in the future.\n\nSetlist:\n\nStill Night Jam\n\nMaybe Tomorrow\n\nTime Remix\n\nOne Day They’ll Know > ODESZA Remix > Break Science Remix\n\nLet The World Hurry By\n\nSo Much In The Dark\n\nMore Important Than Michael Jordan\n\nBombay Bump\n\nTotal Fascination > Jam\n\nUnderstand Me Now > Jam\n\nCold Feeling > Jam > Remix\n\nThere Is a Light\n\nJam\n\nWhere I’m Trying to Go tease\n\nMore Important Than Michael Jordan tease\n\nI Can See It In Your Face > Jam\n\nHigh School Art Class\n\nAh, where did 2015 go? It felt like we were just ringing in a new year a couple months ago. But with another year in the rear-view mirror, it’s time to once again doll out our annual “Best of” lists. Much like we did in 2014, we heard a lot of music this year, whether it was at a show or at a festival, at work, on the bus or in our cars. From established headliners who continue to amaze us to emerging artists who rekindled our excitement for new music, our collective lives were filled with one musical memory after another over the past 12 months.\n\nSo, without further ado, Showbams presents The Bam Team’s five favorite shows, albums and songs from 2015.\n\nThe 25 Best Live Music Acts of 2015\n\nListen to The Bam Team’s favorite songs of 2015:\n\nJosh Herwitt // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2015\n\n1. Jack White at Coachella Music and Arts Festival, Weekend 1 – Indio, CA – April 11th\n\nThere’s a reason why Mr. White was named our No. 1 live music act of 2014 around this time last year, and it’s not because he’s simply a guitar god. The Detroit native and former White Stripe is much more than that now, as he has proven with the kind of clever, genre-swirling songwriting that permeates his two solo albums Blunderbuss and Lazaretto. But witnessing White perform live almost feels like a musical right of passage in and of itself, reminding us that while inventive, mainstream rock ‘n’ roll may be harder to come by these days, it’s still far from dead. On this warm, spring night in the California desert, he imparted on us that “music is sacred” — not just with his words in between songs, but also with every ferverous note that he struck on his fret board. From the moment White appeared on the festival’s main stage, his 20-song, headlining set was bold and powerful, even if it would serve as one of his last shows for a while.\n\n2. My Morning Jacket at Santa Barbara Bowl – Santa Barbara, CA – October 11th\n\n3. Modest Mouse at Hollywood Forever – Los Angeles, CA – August 21st\n\n4. Tycho at Lightning in a Bottle – Bradley, CA – May 24th\n\n5. The War on Drugs at Coachella Music and Arts Festival, Weekend 1 – Indio, CA – April 10th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2015\n\n1. My Morning Jacket – The Waterfall\n\nWhen My Morning Jacket announced that they would be releasing a new studio LP in May after nearly a four-year layoff, their longest between albums since forming in the late 90’s, I wasn’t sure if they could top what they had devised on 2011’s Circuital. But these Louisville rockers, rather, did just that, putting together a flawless record that opens with the inspiring “Believe (Nobody Knows)” and concludes with the gloomy, yet poignant “Only Memories Remain”. In between it all, frontman Jim James continues to build off his 2013 solo album, showing what a thoughtful songwriter he has become — knowing when to step on the gas pedal and when to ease off of it. With an already impressive catalog highlighted by 2005’s Z, it’s hard to definitively say that The Waterfall has taken over the throne as MMJ’s best album now, but there’s no doubt it belongs in the conversation.\n\n2. Father John Misty – I Love You, Honeybear\n\n3. Silversun Pickups – Better Nature\n\n4. Jamie xx – In Colour\n\n5. Tame Impala – Currents\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2015\n\n1. My Morning Jacket – “Tropics (Erase Traces)”\n\nIt’s only fitting that my favorite album of the year also boasts my favorite song of the year. The penultimate track on My Morning Jacket’s The Waterfall is an absolute rocker that gradually builds from the opening, Led Zeppelin-esque guitar lick before peaking midway through for a chilling finish. There might not be a better example in MMJ’s catalog that demonstrates how well Jim James and Carl Broemel play off each other, and if the two guitarists haven’t already, then they’ve certainly cemented themselves as one of rock’s best one-two punches by now.\n\n2. The Weeknd – “The Hills”\n\n3. Modest Mouse – “The Ground Walks, With Time in a Box”\n\n4. Battles – “The Yabba”\n\n5. Tame Impala – “The Less I Know the Better”\n\nMolly Kish // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2015\n\n1. Jamie xx at Bimbo’s 365 Club – San Francisco, CA – July 31st\n\nWhereas those familiar with his early XL Records mixtapes were satiated by his intermingling of Gil Scott-Heron and Idris Muhammad samples between hits, Jamie xx’s newfound, post-In Colour fans experienced equally breathtaking moments with the crowd hitting peak energy levels during the chorus of “Loud Places” amidst the glow of a warped-speed, neon-green strobe light. Another notable moment included the near-religious choral drop of “Gosh” that escalated the packed house to spiritual levels of enthusi"
