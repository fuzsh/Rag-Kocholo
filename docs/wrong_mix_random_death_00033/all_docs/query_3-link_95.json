        "text": "What’s it like living in Los Angeles after growing up in the Bay Area?\n\nI moved to L.A. when I was about 17. I had already left the house. I left the house at 14, and by the time I was almost 18 it was the appropriate time for me to situate in a new place. L.A. and the Bay are like cousins. Do we have differences? Absolutely, things that are fundamental to us, but when you leave California, you can really see that we're just like a big family.\n\nHad you been dreaming of L.A. as a place where you could pursue art? Were you already set on that goal?\n\nIt was the closest place that a young, very broke person could go and work in music. I'm sure there were other places with musical homes, musical cities, but if all I had to do was get on a $15 bus and go find someone to stay with in L.A., I was gonna do it for sure.\n\nThat’s the same ambition that I feel drives this new record, which is just so dense and full of surprises. That includes the lovely retro radio intro to \"GrooveTheory,\" where you move from this ‘60s pop feel to the present. That’s such a smart way to foreground your evolution.\n\nI think the second that we made that song and then turned it into [\"GrooveTheory\"], I was like, This feels like it encompasses where I'm headed, this whole new sound.\n\nOnce that radio dials in and it comes in with R&B elements, it's producing where I'm headed, but also remembering that my core hasn't changed. Especially the energy of what I'm saying in the song, like, \"I'm kind of crazy,\" it's introducing this energy difference on this album. I feel like that's the biggest change, and that's what's so prevalent in this whole rollout. Energetically, I'm on a whole different type of time.\n\nYou can sense it. 'Crash' feels really rooted in self-expression and personal growth, and when you listen to it as a whole, it really does seem like an evolution story. Beyond just the genre and style, how do you feel the way that you've expressed your true self has shifted over the years?\n\nThank you! That's been the feedback I've gotten from pretty much everyone who's listened, and I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't this. I have realized the public's understanding of me and the general consensus for so long, and I also realized how multi-faceted I am to people.\n\nPeople get really confused when I express all the sides of my personality. They’re either, like, \"Okay, she makes really sweet love songs,\" or \"We've seen you be political, we've seen you come out, we've seen you be a family member.\" And then there's a lot of people who are, like, \"I feel like she's f—ing crazy. I've seen her in multiple relationships. I've seen her be angry. I've seen her get online and cuss people out.\"\n\nI want this next batch of music to feel like the most fiery parts of me. I want it to feel like the most present and energetic parts of me. I don't want anything to feel somber. I don't want anything to feel reminiscent. I think a lot of my albums in the past have been me looking back, and sitting in that feeling and detailing it. I just wanted [this album] to feel right here, right now, which is why the title came about. A crash isn't anything from the past. It isn't the anxiety of what's about to happen. It's the height of the moment. It's right now.\n\nThat’s unfortunately a story you hear too often about artists of color — that essentialization, where you can only be seen as one thing. R&B often gets hit with those same issues. Throughout your career you’ve stood up to those expectations, and \"Better Not\" on this album is such a good example of that. It’s a left turn, a stylistic contrast and an open conversation with the listener. You cleverly fuse that intentionality with a voice that’s stronger than ever.\n\nIn the past, I have had moments where I would make the song and [start recording], and there would be so many versions of each song on different microphones, recorded in different places.\n\n\"Let me try vocal production. Let me try to go back and work with this version again.\" I went back and did vocal production with Oak Felder, who did all the vocal production on SweetSexySavage. When I come back to some of my favorite vocal production moments, it was moments like \"Distraction\" or \"Advice\" or \"Escape\" — songs on my very first album — and I wanted to get that feeling again. Where it's lush where it needs to be, but also that I really mean what I'm saying.\n\nThat started with the approach in the songwriting. Once I had the songs and I had to go back and deliver them, I had enough time to listen and listen, to learn the songs and identify with them. We would make music all day and then go out, and we would be in this sprinter van on the way to going out, and, like, bang, the songs we just made, the energy was just different. It allowed me to be present in a different way where my voice is able to show up like that.\n\nLearn more: R&B Isn't Dead: Listen To 51 Songs By Summer Walker, Josh Levi & More Artists Who Are Pushing The Genre Forward\n\nWhich again ties perfectly to crashing into the present. As someone from South Africa, I love that the other guests that you included represent different cultural viewpoints. You worked with Young Miko from Puerto Rico, Omah Lay from Nigeria. Having that musical dialogue is so powerful.\n\nWe had so many conversations about how America's in the backseat often when it comes to music. We have our moments, and it's fantastic, like Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter. There's a culture that is super American, that is Black, that historically needs to be dived into. It needs to be shown that we do have something here.\n\nSo many people that don't speak Spanish bang Bad Bunny all day. Amapiano’s taking over; Tyla’s going up. It's really not here. So that wasn't a conscious choice. It's just what we've all been listening to, what we've been loving.\n\nRead more: 11 Women Pushing Amapiano To Global Heights: Uncle Waffles, Nkosazana Daughter, & More\n\nSpeaking of guests, I wanted to ask about your daughter, whose voice is on \"Deep.\" Was she just in the studio and you got her singing?\n\nSo those vocals on that, that’s actually my little sister and my goddaughter. And [my daughter] was in the room and she started singing along. She has perfect pitch; she's always freestyling or singing or making something up.\n\nI was like, \"You want to just go sing on it?\" What's on there is her first take. Literally. She did it the first time, all the way through, perfectly. I was like, \"Well, that's it, guys. I can retire.\"\n\nThat track is so lush. It feels so alive. Were you working with a full band?\n\n[Producer] Jack Rochon, who I did a lot of the music with, he just is a freaking genius music whiz. Honestly, he's one of the most humble people that I know, and deserves credit for how amazing a lot of this album is.\n\nTalking about touchstones, there's a Prince energy to the title track. Did you have any new inspirations or influences for this record?\n\nThank you! My main focus for this album came from going on tour for my last one and making such a pretty, sweet, intimate album, and then playing some of the biggest venues of my career. At some point I had to rearrange the setlist to add in a lot of the album before that one, because it was just more energy on the stage. By week two of tour, the setlist had completely changed. I knew that I was playing venues on this next tour that I've dreamt about, places that I can't fathom that I'm playing, like Barclays Center.\n\nI do a lot of things for, like, my inner child, and this is such a move for my inner child. Like, You're about to go play Barclays. Do you want to look back and say, ‘I rocked out and played Barclays’? I'm a person who headbangs on stage. I stage dive. I wanted to create an album that would ring through a venue like that. I want people to be engaged again. I'm not looking for the lighters and the somber, holding each other — which will occur regardless, because it's a me show.\n\nBut I really wanted people to be in their bodies, and their heart’s exploding and the ground’s shaking. So that's what we accomplished. I wanted to have fun. This album is so fun to me. It’s a place of fire in my heart.\n\nIt took me a second to get the word play on \"Eight.\" I loved the track, and then suddenly I was like, 'Oh… I knew there was something raunchy going on here.'\n\n[*Laughs.*] \"Eight\" was super fun, and shoutout to the boys that I did it with, because they made it everything for me.\n\nI didn't come up with the wordplay. My boys did. Like, \"This is how you talk!\" I was like, \"It is! This is perfect.\" Once I got in to fix things, add things, add my own spin, and finish writing, my favorite part was that it sounds like a Brandy song. She's my favorite.\n\nI also wanted to ask about the Nina Sky sample on \"After Hours.\"\n\nThat was mine. I was like, \"What can we flip that when it comes on, my generation loses their mind?\" And for me, every single time that Nina Sky comes on in the club, everybody's like \"Woo!\" And then you see how many songs were made from that same sample, and they're all songs that make us lose our minds.\n\nI went into the room with the producers, and I was like, \"So, I want to flip this, but I want you to make it to where it doesn't become one of those where the whole thing is just a sample.\"\n\nSimilarly, \"Lose My Wife\" balances breeziness with high emotional stakes. Is finding a balance like that just natural for someone so capable of juxtaposition?\n\nThe second that we established that [the record] felt like Vegas, I knew what components were missing from the energy of how I feel the second my car crosses the line into the city of Las Vegas. I knew I was missing that feeling of the next morning when you realize you went on this high and you come down. I wanted to create these scenarios that weren't necessarily applicable to me, but captured that emotion. I've been there before, and I want people to be like, Damn, I've been there before. I know this feeling.\n\nI recorded that song at 4 in the morning with a sinus infection. The second that we finished it, everybody was like, \"You can never re-sing that. Don't try to make another version, you're not gonna be able to sound like that again.\" All the chatter in the background of that song is really everybody who was in the studio that stayed up to just hang out. We had the tequila out, it was perfect. That was probably one of my favorite moments of making the album.\n\nI released \"Buckle Bunny\" on the Buckle Bunny EP in July 2023. I actually teased it on social media first. Almost nine months before that, I had gone super viral with it. It was doing incredibly well, so my plans were to release it in January or February of last year. But, I ended up signing a record deal in December of 2022. There were plans for it at that time, but the timeline kept getting pushed back. It turned into a fight to get that song back into my hands, which was what prompted me to go independent. Eventually, I was able to work with my label, shake hands, and mutually part ways.\n\nI started this year as an independent artist with this song that everybody loves. It's become a huge part of my brand, but it's really my life story. People might think it's a dumb song that was easy to write, but I was called a \"buckle bunny.\" As a teenager growing up between Los Angeles and Star Valley, Wyoming, I was into glam country, and \"Buckle Bunny\" is the pinnacle of that.\n\n\"Buckle Bunny\" was my first single that charted. I felt like I finally had broken through that invisible box that Nashville put me in as a country musician. It was me saying, I'm not going to follow any rules. I'm going to be as true to myself as possible.\n\nWe, as Black women, have been fighting our whole lives. We've been fighting for space. I'm purposely trying to bring softness into the picture, allowing women who listen to my music to know that it's okay to feel that way. We don't always have to have our walls up.\n\n\"Buckle Bunny\" is aggressively confident, but I think that's the door to softness. You have to be self-assured to let your walls down. My newest single, \"Whiskey Blues,\" is my next step into that. I have another song on my social media, \"Snakeskin,\" that people want me to release. \"Buckle Bunny\" is like the girl who protects those softer moments.\n\nIn a way, I look at all of this as a relationship between Tanner Adell, the artist, and Tanner, the person. For me, Tanner Adell is the buckle bunny. Then, you have Tanner, who's on the inside, writing all of these songs.\n\nServing A Bold Fashion Statement On Her First Major Red Carpet\n\nI wore Bantu knots! I've always loved Bantu knots in all styles, the really small ones and the larger ones. There were ideas about whether I should do a certain number of them that was significant to me in some way.\n\nI work very closely with Bill Wackermann, who was the CEO of Wilhemina Models. He does a lot of styling and has a close relationship with my manager. So, my manager was like, \"You would love him!\" At the time, I was trying to hone in on what myself is. What's the message I'm trying to convey through my fashion, hair, and beauty?\n\nBill sat down with me, and I told him I wanted Natalia Fedner to do my dress, which is that stretchy chain metal dress. Originally, I thought I would do my long blonde hair, but Bill was the one who told me, \"This is your first major red carpet as an invited artist. Think about what you want your hair to say.\" As a Black woman, our hair tells 1,000 stories with whatever it is, and the lightbulb went off in my head.\n\nI knew I wanted my hair to say everything I needed to say without having to say anything at all. I also knew there would be a lot of people who didn't know the significance behind it or just thought it was some extreme hairstyle.\n\nI've looked very deeply into my heritage. It turns out I have a bit of Bantu heritage in my DNA. I thought that was so cool because I do love the knots so much.\n\nThe CMT Awards were a big thing at my school, Utah Valley University. Everyone would get together in the dorms and watch the show. It's crazy that a couple years ago, I was watching it, and I'm here now. I feel very respected and loved. People I've looked up to would come up to me, and I was like, \"I'm a huge fan.\" And they're like, \"No! I listened to you.\"\n\nI got to meet Gayle King, who I absolutely love. I remember watching her from afar while she was doing \"CBS Mornings.\" She saw me from across the room, and I kid you not, in the middle of her interview, she started walking towards me. She was like, \"I just want to tell you that you're so beautiful. The Bantu knots are stunning.\" That was my favorite moment of the night.\n\nI also had the chance to see Tiera Kennedy. She's so sweet. We got matching blackbird tattoos before that. Being on the red carpet for the first time, it was comforting to see a familiar face. It really reinforces that idea that I belong here.\n\nBeing A Part Of COWBOY CARTER\n\nSo, I'm adopted. I have four siblings. We're all biracial, but our adoptive parents are both white. Obviously, my dad is a white man with five Black children. My parents always wanted me to understand that I am a Black woman, and he was very educational when it came to music. He taught me about the Black female power players and the buzz in the industry. But The Beatles were his favorite. So, when I finally told them the news, my dad immediately got choked up. He told me that \"Blackbird\" was one of his favorite Beatles songs.\n\nMy dad isn't the best with words when it comes to expressing his emotions, especially in front of people. He's a quiet, reserved dude. So, he eventually texts me, sending me screenshots about the meaning behind \"Blackbird.\" The reason why it was his favorite song was because he had Black girls, and he told me, \"This is special. This is not a burden to carry, but it might be a bit of weight on your shoulders. Keep your head up high and walk knowing that this is why he wrote this song.\"\n\nI can remember going to a recital as a kid and being so nervous, but my dad was so confident and excited about my abilities. Was that strategic? Was it quiet strength? Maybe. It feels like this song has been a part of my whole life. So, to be on it, on such a massive album, feels very divine.\n\nThe whole process was a surprise. It took a few weeks to set in. But I always knew I would work with [Beyoncé], and I always said it's a matter of \"when,\" not if.\n\nOn the day of the Super Bowl, I saw that black-and-white picture of her, and I thought it looked a lot like a photoshoot that I took the week before. Let me make a tweet, just to put it out there. I don't know — she's magical! She has her way of knowing everything that's going on all the time.\n\nI think that tweet has almost 10 million views. It was fun to go back to that tweet to see the people who were supporting me. And also getting to say \"I told you\" to the people who didn't. It kicked off a Renaissance — pun intended.\n\nPerforming At Her First Stagecoach Music Festival\n\nI have bad social anxiety, and I get nervous in front of crowds and people. So, festivals were never something that interested me, but Stagecoach was always one I felt like I could go to. And I was not disappointed.\n\nI had the first slot of the day, which is a s—ty slot for anyone, but you have to pay your dues in country music. It's how you build your cred with these festivals, to show you're a hard worker and will perform like you're at a sold-out show in Madison Square Garden. And I did.\n\nMentally, I prepared for no one. I told myself it was okay if nobody came, and I'll perform like I always do. I'll figure out where the camera is and perform it for the jumbotron, so if no one comes to the pit, the people watching the livestream will have a great show.\n\nWell, I didn't have an empty pit! People showed the f— up and out. I heard people in line thought they were going to miss it because the gates opened late. Within the first 10 minutes, the VIP pit was half-filled with people screaming and running in their sweet little cowboy boots and hats. That never happens at Stagecoach or Coachella, but it's a testament to the relationship I built within my listeners. It was eye-opening for me. I don't think I'm ever going to play to a dead crowd again.\n\nBefore, Levi's reached out and said I was the first artist they wanted to collaborate with for Stagecoach. So, they custom-made my outfit. I told them I have these ribbons, inspired by my mom, who was a rodeo queen. I also told them if they can't incorporate them, I probably won't do it. But they loved it! And it was special because it came back to my mom. She was a winner, so when I wear the ribbons, I'm also a winner.\n\nMy mom has competed in over 1,000 competitions and probably places in half of those. In Wyoming, we had a big wall, covered in those IQHA (International Quarter Horse Association) ribbons. She gave me a strong sense of competition.\n\nMaking Her Debut On Daytime TV"
