The music moguls have not yet publicly confirmed they became man and wife on April 4 in New York, but Scarsdale, N.Y., Town Clerk Donna Conkling received their signed marriage license in the mail Friday afternoon, People.com reported. The date listed for the wedding was April 4 – the date media witnessed a flurry of A-list activity around Jay-Z’s Manhattan apartment. While the couple’s license was filed late – it is supposed to be done within five days of the “I dos” – Conkling said she’s sure the newlyweds will get the customary penalty waiver.\n\nOriginally Published: April 23, 2008 at 12:00 a.m."
