However, she elaborated on the festivities and her gratitude in the visual, which features Knowles standing on a breezy beach in Malibu in a fur coat and red lipstick.

"This is 'turn up' Tina, coming to you, on my birthday in my favorite place in the world, Malibu Beach. And I have had the time of my life with all of my beautiful friends from Texas and my friends from California. Not all of them because a couple of them couldn't be here," she began the video.

Knowles continued: "This has been a spiritual weekend, and just about the empowerment of kickass women. Just tough, beautiful women filled with love. And I feel so loved. I had a little anxiety about turning 70, you know? But I'm so blessed to be here, and I'm so blessed to have the life that I have and the people that I have around me. All the love."

She then casually dropped the news that she received a very rare concert of sorts.

"I just got spoiled to death this weekend. I even got serenaded by Destiny's Child. How amazing is that?" she remarked. "So I just want to thank everyone who sent me flowers, everyone that told me a happy birthday. I got so many well wishes. I've got so many bonus children ‚Äî beautiful bonus children ‚Äî and I just feel so blessed. I love you guys. I love you so much."

Knowles' birthday isn't the first time the iconic R&B outfit has reunited lately.

Last week, former band member LeToya Luckett shared a sweet photo on Instagram of the girl group‚Äôs reunion when Beyonc√© brought her Renaissance World Tour to her hometown of Houston in September. The R&B singer, 42, also opened up about how much the moment meant to her in the caption.
