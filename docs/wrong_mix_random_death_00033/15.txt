Western Massachusetts has welcomed its fair share of superstars to its stages. So many, in fact, it is hard to keep to trim it to 100. Excluding icons of a century ago (sorry Charles Dickens), here are 100 of the biggest entertainers to play the four western counties.

The Who at Springfield Civic Center on December 14, 1975

Touring in support of their album "The Who by Numbers," Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle and Keith Moon roared into the Springfield Civic Center on Dec. 14, 1975.

It was a great year for The Who. The offbeat movie version of their rock opera "Tommy" had arrived in theaters in March, "Squeeze Box" was a hit on the charts, and on Dec. 6, they set a record for largest indoor concert when 75,962 fans attend their show at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan.

Bob Dylan and Joan Baez at the Pittsfield Boys Club on August 14, 1963

Bob Dylan was a surprise guest at Joan Baez's Aug. 14, 1963 performance at the Pittsfield Boys Club, held there because the audience was larger than the Music Barn in Lenox could accommodate. Dylan sang “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” “Blowin in the Wind,” and “A Hard Rain’s A-gonna Fall,” while Baez performed “Don’t Think Twice, It’s Allright” and “With God on Our Side.”

Nirvana's troubled singer Kurt Cobain died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 5, 1994. His death came shortly after what turned out to be Nirvana's final tour. The U.S. leg of the "In Utero" tour had included a Nov. 10, 1993 appearance at the Springfield Civic Center.

The Seattle grunge rockers took the stage that Wednesday night after a 45-minute set by Half Japanese and 13 songs performed at the start of the night by Breeders before a crowd of 6,000.

Bruce Springsteen at Curry Hicks Cage at UMass-Amherst on Nov. 25, 1973

"The Boss" has performed in Western Massachusetts eight times during his career – and three of those shows took place in 1973.

Touring in support of his just-released sophomore album "The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle," Springsteen played at UMass on the Sunday after Thanksgiving 1973.

He had performed (briefly) at UMass' spring concert six months earlier, opening for It's a Beautiful Day. He sang just two numbers that day, "Spirit in the Night" and "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?"

For the Curry Hicks Cage show, he was again an opening act – but this time for English blues great John Mayall. General admission tickets were priced at $3.50, though the show was not even close to a sell-out.

Springsteen last played Western Massachusetts in September 1978 at a show at the Springfield Civic Center.

Elvis Presley at Springfield Civic Center on July 14, 1975

Springfield got the royal treatment when the "King of Rock 'n' Roll" made his first visit to the city. Demand for tickets was so great, a second show was added. The July 14-15 concerts grossed a phenomenal $190,405 with tickets selling for $10 and less. Elvis returned on July 29, 1976, and a fourth concert had been secured when he died in 1977.

Judy Garland played a six-night engagement at the former Storrowton Theatre in West Springfield.

The shows were preceded by a six-night stay at the Westbury Music Fair in New York in mid June. The road shows served to fine tune her Broadway return in An Evening With July Garland, which was preparing for a 16-night engagement at the Palace Theatre beginning on on July 31.

Billy Joel, Taj Mahal at the Paramount Theatre on March 9, 1972

Pre-"Piano Man" Billy Joel, along with local rockers Clean Living, opened for hometown hero Taj Mahal at the Paramount Theatre in downtown Springfield back in 1972.

"I was the opening act for Taj Mahal," Joel recalled during a March 5, 1996 lecture at Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley. "It's a tough gig being an opening act. People come there to see the headliner. They don't want you there. You are in their way."

While Mahal has played numerous shows in Springfield throughout his career, Joel never performed again in the City of Homes.

With two Columbia LPs, including "Piano Man" under his belt, Joel was slated to return to the Paramount on Dec. 13, 1974. However, the show was cancelled because of poor ticket sales.

Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis at Coliseum in West Springfield on Oct. 26, 1952

At the height of their popularity, the duo performed before a crowd of 4,865 at the Coliseum in West Springfield on Oct. 26, 1952.

The first half of the night at the Coliseum featured an eclectic lineup: comic magician Carl Ballantine, The DeMarco Sisters, big band singer Kitty Kallen, juggler Ben Berri, and a dog act led by Bob Williams.

Martin and Lewis, backed by Dick Stabile and His Band, exploded onto the stage delivering songs and jokes. The duo "went through a whirlwind of routines which will have Western Massachusetts stomachs sore for weeks," The Springfield Union wrote.

Diana Ross and The Supremes at The Big E on Sept. 18-19, 1967

Diana Ross and The Supremes performed for two days at The Big E Coliseum during the 1967 run of New England's largest state fair.

More than 5,000 people attended the first of their four free shows in West Springfield on September 18, 1967. However, attendance was not as supreme as organizers had hoped, especially it was the first free big name show at the fair. Later, it was theorized that many people did not believe the Motown greats would play a free show at the fair.

Simon and Garfunkel at Curry Hicks Cage at UMass-Amherst on Feb. 19, 1966

Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel made the first of two appearances at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst on Feb. 19, 1966.

The Amherst concert came just weeks after the release of their sophomore album "The Sounds of Silence." By the time Simon & Garfunkel returned to Curry Hicks Cage on Dec. 3, 1967, they had three albums to their credit and had performed six months earlier at the celebrated Monterey Pop Festival.

Jefferson Airplane at Springfield Municipal Auditorium on April 29, 1967

Jefferson Airplane took a break from an extended engagement in Boston to perform at Springfield's Municipal Auditorium on April 29, 1967 at 3 p.m.

The band's single "My Best Friend" was reportedly selling briskly at local record shops when singer Grace Slick and company took the stage. Their most recent album, "Surrealistic Pillow," featured the hits "Somebody to Love" and "White Rabbit."

Yet as big as Jefferson Airplane were in the spring of 1967, the show was a commercial flop.

Just 400 fans showed up in a hall that could have accommodated 3,400.

Although the show was announced in The Springfield Union and advertisements placed in advance of the show, tickets were not made available to the public until shortly before showtime.

Chuck Berry at the Valley Arena in Holyoke on May 30, 1957

Chuck Berry had released his first album just three weeks before he took the stage at the Valley Arena on South Bridge Street in Holyoke.

The track listing on his Chess Records debut, "After School Session," reads like a rock 'n' primer. It boasts classics like "Too Much Monkey Business," "Roll Over Beethoven," "School Days" and "Brown Eyed Handsome Man" to name but a few.

Three Stooges at the Paramount Theater on May 18-22, 1939

The legendary slapstick trio performed with singer-bandleader Ina Ray Hutton and Her Melodears during a five-day visit to the Paramount Theater in downtown Springfield on May 18-22, 1939.

Despite her "sex appealing mannerisms," the curvaceous Hutton and her all-girl band failed to win over the opening night crowd, according to The Springfield Daily Republican, and the show was in desperate need of saving.

Moe Howard, kid brother Jerome "Curly" Howard and longtime pal Larry Fine resuscitated the night.

"Where the much-publicized 'blonde bombshell of rhythm' failed, The Three Stooges succeeded," the newspaper wrote. "Masters of crazy comedy, the Stooges stirred cold audiences into fits of laughter and applause."

Michael Jackson with The Jacksons at Springfield Civic Center on Oct. 28, 1979

By the time The Jacksons' "Destiny Tour" reached the City of Homes, baby brother Michael's star was on the rise.

The tour had kicked off in January 1979 as a means to promote the brothers' million-selling "Destiny" album. But in the summer of 1979, Michael Jackson achieved solo success with "Off the Wall," which featured the hit single "Rock With You."

When The Jacksons played the Springfield Civic Center on Oct. 28, 1979, the set list was retooled to reflect Michael's solo success.

Everly Brothers at Mountain Park in Holyoke on Aug. 13, 1965

The Everly Brothers were at a low point in their impressive career when they played Mountain Park in Holyoke in the summer of 1965.

Their chart success had evaporated after their enlistment in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in late 1961. The British Invasion in early 1964 was another nail in the hit-making duo's coffin.

Making matters worse, both brothers had been battling addiction to amphetamines.

Against that sad backdrop, Holyoke concert-goers were treated to songs that had been jukebox favorites in the 1950s: "Wake Up Little Susie," "All I Have to Do Is Dream" and Bye Bye Love."

James Taylor at Music Barn in Lenox on Aug. 2, 1970

James Taylor is a regular visitor to Tanglewood in Lenox, and his shows quickly sell-out.

But in 1970, his appeal caught some off-guard.

The 22-year-old Taylor drew a record crowd of 9,000 to the Music Barn in Lenox on Aug. 2, 1970. He had just two albums under his belt, "Sweet Baby James," released earlier that year on Warner Bros., and his 1968 freshman release on The Beatles' Apple Records.

Harry Chapin at Smith College on March 31, 1977

On a spring night nearly 40 years ago, Harry Chapin half-jokingly told a crowd at Smith College in Northampton that once he started singing songs from the point-of-view of a failure, he found success.

The man who wrote and sang tunes like "Taxi," "Cat's in the Cradle" and "W.O.L.D." mixed music with quips and wry observations before a crowd of 2,000 at John M. Greene Hall on March 31, 1977.

Johnny Carson at UMass on Feb. 24, 1968

Johnny Carson brought trumpeter and band leader Doc Severinsen and company to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst campus on Feb. 24, 1968.

The Curry Hicks Cage was packed for the two Saturday evening performances, which were part of the Winter Carnival celebration. It was a mix of humor and jazz and big band favorites that closely resembled the "Tonight Show" format.

The UMass appearance was Carson's first college gig on the East Coast.

Aerosmith at the Greenfield YMCA on Jan. 15, 1971

Years before the "Bad Boys from Boston" cut their first record at Intermedia Studio on Newbury Street, Aerosmith was cutting their teeth at high school gigs and community halls throughout Massachusetts.

The band performed its first few shows in late 1970 in Worcester County and Littleton, New Hampshire, before venturing west the following year. Their first show in 1971 was an appearance at the Greenfield YMCA on Jan. 15.

Prince, Rick James at Springfield Civic Center on April 13, 1980

Hard to believe, but when Prince visited the Springfield Civic Center on April 13, 1980, he did not top the bill.

Prince and Vaughn Mason & Crew opened for "Super Freak" Rick James that night as part of James' "Fire It Up" tour.

Prince opened for James on 42 nights during the winter-spring tour of the U.S. and the two stars did not hit it off.

At the Springfield Civic Center, Prince played seven songs, including "Soft and Wet," "Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad" and "Sexy Dancer." He closed his brief set with "I Wanna Be Your Lover."

James slammed Prince in an interview with Rolling Stone: "I can't believe people are gullible enough to buy Prince's jive records... (Prince is a) a mentally disturbed young man. He's out to lunch. You can't take his music seriously."

Van Morrison, J. Geils Band at Springfield Municipal Auditorium on Jan. 22, 1971

The Belfast-born Van Morrison teamed with Worcester's J. Geils Band for a show that drew about 2,800 people to Springfield Municipal Auditorium on Jan. 22, 1971.

Neither act was a stranger to Western Massachusetts. Both had played separate shows at the Woodrose Ballroom in Deerfield in 1969.

Morrison had already charted with songs like "Brown Eyed Girl" and "Moondance," not to mention "Gloria," his 1964 hit with Them.

But it was the J. Geils Band , touring in support of their debut album, that fired up the crowd. "Homework" and other tunes had fans dancing in the aisles before intermission.

Peter, Paul and Mary at the Coffee House Theatre in Springfield on April 9-14, 1962

Just weeks before the debut of their first album, Peter Yarrow, Paul Stookey and Mary Travers took the stage at a small Springfield coffeehouse for a week-long engagement.

The Coffee House Theatre, which was run by the Candy Factory Society, at 15 Mill St. had opened its doors on Feb. 5.

Peter, Paul and Mary, accompanied by local bassist Charles Hohe, took the Mill Street stage on Monday, April 9, and performed "Shape of Things to Come," described as an 18th century song about a 20th century love affair. They likely played songs from their upcoming Warner Brothers album, which contained the hits "Lemon Tree" and "If I Had a Hammer."

The Police, The Go-Go's at Springfield Civic Center on Jan. 20, 1982

Two of New Wave's top acts easily sold out the Springfield Civic Center on Jan. 20, 1982.

Touring in support of their three-month old "Ghost In The Machine" album, The Police arrived in the City of Homes and brought relative newcomers The Go-Go's along. The Springfield stop was sandwiched between shows at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Long Island and Madison Square Garden in New York.

The all-female band kicked off the night with radio-friendly tracks from their debut album "Beauty and the Beat" - "We Got the Beat" and "Our Lips Are Sealed."

The Police took the stage after a taped "Voices In My Head" and tore into "Message in a Bottle."

Bob Marley at the Lenox Music Inn on June 18, 1978

A night after playing Madison Square Garden, Bob Marley and the Wailers left the big city behind for an outdoor gig in the Berkshires.

Overcast skies cleared in time for the spirited mid-afternoon performance, which began appropriately enough with "Sun is Shining."

The show is legendary among Marley fans for its unusual length.

Unlike the 15-song set he had had played less than 24 hours earlier in New York City, Marley treated fans in Lenox to 22 songs, including "I Shot The Sheriff," "One Love / People Get Ready" and "Positive Vibration."

David Bowie at Springfield Civic Center on March 21, 1976

A little more than 12 hours after an arrest on drug charges in New York, David Bowie was performing before 6,752 fans in the City of Homes.

The concert began with a showing of the 1928 surrealist film "Un Chien Andqalou" ("Mad Dog") before the music got underway. Over the course of the next 90 minutes, Bowie, dressed as a dapper man-about-town, treated fans to hits like "Fame," "Changes" and "Life On Mars."

Green Day at Springfield Civic Center on Nov. 13, 1995

Before they were American Idiots or Rock and Roll Hall of Famers, Green Day was rocking arenas big and small, including a stop at the Springfield Civic Center on Nov. 13, 1995.

The trio arrived in the City of Homes the night after a gig in Long Island and treated local fans to a brief, but powerful 50-minute show. The 17 songs performed were culled the Grammy Award winning album "Dookie" and the more recent "Insomniac."

Van Cliburn at Springfield Municipal Auditorium on April 13, 1966

Arguably the finest classical pianist of the 20th century, Van Cliburn gave the first of three concerts at Springfield Municipal Auditorium on April 13, 1966.

The Junior League Concert Series and the Concert Association of Great Springfield banded together to bring the 31-year-old Cliburn to the city – eight years after the Louisiana native won over the Soviet Union at the International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition in Moscow.

He became a Cold War hero in the U.S. and a frequent performer in Russia. TIME magazine described him as "Horowitz, Liberace and Presley all rolled into one."

Eddie Murphy at Springfield Civic Center, April 18, 1985

With "Beverly Hills Cop" and "48 Hours" under his belt, Murphy was hot - so hot, that he was paid $50,000 for a 75-minute show.

In a curse-filled monologue, the 24-year-old comic took shots at Michael Jackson, Bill Cosby, the handicapped and health-food devotees before a crowd of 7,500.

Bob Newhart at John Greene Hall, April 22, 1961

There was no one bigger in comedy than Newhart in the spring of 1961.

The funnyman had been signed to star in his own NBC variety show by the time he reached the campus of Smith College in Northampton. And his Grammy Award winning "The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart" had already made his history as the first comedy album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard charts.

Frank Sinatra at Tanglewood on Aug. ]31, 1994

The Chairman of the Board gave his penultimate New England performance in Lenox. He was in fine voice that evening and performed 15 songs beginning with "Come Fly With Me" and ending with the crowd pleasing "(Theme from) New York, New York."

A standout was the sad saloon tune "One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)."

Robin Williams at Springfield Civic Center on May 7, 1986

Arguably, the finest night of comedy ever staged at the center. Williams was pumped up beyond belief, running through a seemingly improvised 90-minute routine at breakneck speed. He focused on race relations, childbirth and drugs, but also took on some of the world leaders of the day: "Colonel Khadafy - doesn't it sound like he should have a chain of terrorist chicken stores?"

Olivia Newton John at Springfield Symphony Hall on Nov. 14, 2004

Performing with the Springfield Symphony Orchestra, highlights included her 1981 hit "Physical," a poignant, subtle account of Arthur Hamilton's "Cry Me A River" (in tribute to Julie London, for whom the song provided her only charted hit), and sweet, forthright reminiscences of what one might call her country-western phase, 1973's "Let Me Be There" (her first Grammy-winner), "Please Mr., Please," and "If You Love Me."

Bob Hope at Springfield Civic Center on Sept. 22, 1972

Even though the Springfield Civic Center opened on Sept. 5 with the Ice Capades, the ski-nosed comedian was host of the official opening night gala. Backed by the beautfiul Goldiggers, Hope fired off rounds of one-liners, while anti-war protesters outside the arena held up signs demanding that President Nixon "Bring the Planes Home Now."

The Highwaymen – Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and Johnny Cash – four legends together on stage.

Sure they have played solo shows over the year in Western Massachusetts, but that Friday night in Amherst was magical. The country supergroup played 36 songs during a two-hour set, including "Folsom Prison Blues," "Sunday Morning Coming Down," "Will the Wolf Survive?" and "Always On My Mind."

KISS at Springfield Civic Center on April 6, 1986

The legendary night that KISS almost blew up the Civic Center. Well not really. The pyrotechnics, thousands of stage lights, mountains of amplifiers and speakers proved to be too much for the arena and knocked the power out, seconds after the first song of the night, “Detroit Rock City.” The concert almost was canceled but went on after a 65-minute delay.
