Universal Entertainment filed a trademark for “Shadow Hearts” on April 27 in Japan, which was made public on May 11.

Shadow Hearts is a role-playing game series that began with the release of the original Shadow Hearts for PlayStation 2 on November 6, 2003. Two additional games followed—Shadow Hearts: Covenant for PlayStation 2 on February 19, 2004, and Shadow Hearts: From the New World for PlayStation 2 on July 28, 2005.

Back in March 2021, a Universal Entertainment representative told Gematsu there were no plans for a Shadow Hearts “remake, sequel, or the introduction of game machines using its characters or stories” at the time. However, with things such as Sony Interactive Entertainment‘s renewed PlayStation Plus service featuring a catalog of classic PlayStation titles including PlayStation 2, it is possible those plans have since changed.
