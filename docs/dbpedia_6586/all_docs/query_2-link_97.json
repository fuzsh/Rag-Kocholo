        "text": "This guide will explain the best Shadowheart Companion Build in Baldur’s Gate 3, the Cleric Class, and the Life Domain subclass, for the optimal setup.\n\nThis build page has been updated for the patch 6 version of Baldur’s Gate 3.\n\nShadowheart Companion Introduction\n\nShadowheart is a High Half-Elf Cleric who serves Shar as a Trickery Domain. This means that she is a powerful spellcaster who is also proficient in stealth and deception. Also, Shadowheart is a complex and well-developed character. She is a devout follower of Shar, but she is also struggling with her own doubts and fears. She is an asset to any party, but she can also be a challenging companion.\n\nCompanions in Baldur’s Gate 3 are a group of non-player characters (NPCs) who join the player’s party and accompany them throughout their journey in the game. These companions are essential characters that offer various benefits, such as providing additional combat support, contributing to the story, and offering different perspectives on the events unfolding in the game world.\n\nCompanions can be avoided entirely, die, be romanced, and have their own sprawling background. In this build guide for Shadowheart, we will explore her character and how to make a powerful Cleric Build with her. We also suggest using the Respec or Reroll feature to change Shadowheart’s default subclass to a much more powerful one. This will be explained later.\n\nShadowheart Features & Mechanics\n\nThe following list presents all the essential Shadowheart Companion Mechanics and Features in Baldur’s Gate 3:\n\nClass: Cleric\n\nRace: High Half-Elf\n\nBackground: Urchin\n\nSubclass: Default Trickery, Reroll to Life Domain\n\nBase Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Religion, Insight\n\nBest Build: Cleric, Life Domain, Heavy Armor\n\nOrigin Character: Yes\n\nRomance: Yes\n\nLocation: On the beach next to the Abandoned Ruins, Act 1\n\nYour companion can be respecced or rerolled early in the game. This means you can change their class, subclass, ability score, and more. The only feature that cannot be adjusted is their race and story. We suggest using Withers at Camp after he’s unlocked to optimize the build.\n\nHow to Find and Recruit Shadowheart\n\nTo unlock Shadowheart in Baldur’s Gate 3, you need to follow these steps:\n\nDuring the prologue, free Shadowheart from a tadpole pod.\n\nFind the Eldritch Rune near Shadowheart’s pod and free her.\n\nOnce freed, Shadowheart will join you until the completion of the prologue.\n\nIf you are unable to free her, at least make the effort to speak with her and try.\n\nPost prologue, find Shadowheart on the beach near Abandoned Ruins.\n\nAsk her to join, and she will join your party.\n\nYou can easily swap companions in and out by speaking to them in your camp. Even if you don’t intend to use all the companions, it’s wise to unlock them and have your camp full if needed.\n\nCleric Spell Mechanics\n\nCantrips: are like spells, but you can cast them infinitely, and they don’t take your spell slots.\n\nSpell Slots: At each level, you gain access to more usage of spells and high-tier spells but only have a finite number of spells until a long rest.\n\nLearn Spells: Unlike Wizard, you get opportunities at leveling up to unlearn and learn new spells.\n\nConcentration: is a spell mechanic that requires you to maintain concentration otherwise, the spell effect ends.\n\nRecommended Subclass\n\nThe Best Subclass for Shadowheart build is Life Clerics because it provides the best overall healing and group utility for a support class. The Life Subclass has Heavy Armour Proficiency, Disciple of Life, and Domain Spells. Additionally, Shadowheart defaults to Trickery, which is similar to this build and can be modified. Also, you want to respec her in your camp with the NPC Withers for 100g at the beginning of the game to get the most out of her as a companion.\n\nHere are all the Baldur’s Gate 3 Cleric Subclasses:\n\nKnowledge Domain: Dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and skilled in history, religion, and the arcana.\n\nLife Domain: They are skilled in the use of healing spells, and they can also use their divine power to restore hit points to their allies\n\nLight Domain: Skilled in radiant damage and more offensive Cleric subclass.\n\nNature Domain: Skilled in the use of nature’s spells, and they can also use their divine power to control the weather and animals.\n\nTempest Domain: Skilled in the use of lightning and thunder damage spells, and they can also use their divine power to control the weather and create powerful storms\n\nTrickery Domain: Skilled in the use of illusion and enchantment spells, and they can also use their divine power to create illusions and disguise themselves\n\nWar Domain: Skilled in the use of weapons and armor, and they can also use their divine power to enhance their martial prowess.\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 Life Cleric Features & Progression\n\nThe Life Cleric subclass unlocks the following features and spells:\n\nDisciple of Life (Level 1): Your devotion empowers your healing Spells. When casting a healing spell, the target regains additional Hit Points equal to 2 + Spell’s level.\n\nHeavy Armour Proficiency (Level 1)\n\nDomain Spells (Level 1): Bless and Cure Wounds\n\nChannel Divinity Action (Level 2): Preserve Life\n\nDomain Spells (Level 3): Aid and Lessor Restoration\n\nDomain Spells (Level 5): Revivify and Beacon of Hope\n\nBlessed Healer (Level 6): Regain 2 + Spell Level hit points when casting a healing spell on another creature.\n\nDomain Spells (Level 7): Guardian of Faith and Death Ward\n\nDivine Strike: Life (Level 8): Once per turn deal 1d8 Radiant in addition to your weapon’s weapon damage when you make a melee attack.\n\nDomain Spells (Level 9): Greater Restoration and Mass Cure Wounds\n\nShadowheart Race\n\nSahdowheart by default is a High Half-Elf. A touch of the Feywild remains in half-elves with this bloodline, and even those untrained in magic possess a hint of wild power. Here are the following bonuses:\n\n+2 and +1 to any ability score of your choosing.\n\nFey Ancestry: Advantage on saving throws when an enemy attempts to charm you, and prevents you from being put to sleep by potions, scrolls, and spells.\n\nDarkvision: see up to 12m in dark locations.\n\nExtra Cantrip: Firebolt which can do decent damage and blow up oil or grease to cause fire explosions.\n\nRecommended Skills for Shadowheart Build\n\nMedicine and Persuasion are the best skills for Baldur’s Gate 3: Best Shadowheart Companion Build because they complement your class abilities and enhance your effectiveness in various situations. In Baldur’s Gate 3, skills represent the abilities and proficiencies of your character that allow them to perform various actions and interact with the game world. Skills are associated with specific attributes and are used to determine the success or effectiveness of certain actions or abilities. They can be edited during character creation or with companions, during respec or reroll screen.\n\nHere are the skills for Shadowheart in Baldur’s Gate 3:\n\nMedicine is a Wisdom Skill\n\nPersuasionis a Charisma Skill\n\nShadowheart Ability Score\n\nHere’s the best ability score for the Baldur’s Gate 3: Best Shadowheart Companion Build:\n\nThe most important ability score for the Baldur’s Gate 3: Best Shadowheart Companion Build is Wisdom followed by Constitution and Dexterity. It’s important to land on even numbers and get at least 16 in Wisdom for optimal spell casting. In Baldur’s Gate 3, ability scores are the six core stats that determine a character’s capabilities. You can adjust for the optimal setup in character creation or reroll with Withers in your Camp.\n\nCleric Spell Slots\n\nHere is a list of the Clerics’ Spell Slots as they progress:\n\nShadowheart Level Progression\n\nIn Baldur’s Gate 3, ability scores are the six core stats that determine a character’s capabilities. For companions, the game automatically distributes them without the ability to change. Keep in mind, change your default ability score in your camp via the NPC Withers for 100 gold.\n\nLevel 1\n\nAt Level One, you will unlock three cantrips and pick three prepared spells. Cantrips are reusable and don’t require a spell slot resource. Prepared spells can be swapped in and out before combat, so make sure to use the loadout at the end of the level for a helpful guide.\n\nREMEMBER that companions, will come default with their preferred class and subclass. If you can, unlock Withers as early as level 2 just after the prologue, and respec Shadowheart skills, ability score, and subclass. Feel free to swap in and out spells with Shadowheart Cleric after you’ve learned them. Each subclass unlocks “always prepared” spells. If it’s confusing, look at our suggested prepared spell list at the bottom of every level. Always-prepared spells will still consume a spell slot when you cast them, but will not require a spellbook slot allowing for more flexibility.\n\nCantrip Selection\n\nSacred Flame: Conjure a flame-like radiance that deals 1d8 Radiant. This Cantrip acts with a very low damage range ability that can be used without a spell slow.\n\nGuidance: Bestow guidance upon an ally. They gain a +1d4 bonus to Ability Checks. This spell is critical during dialogue checks and is very useful outside of combat.\n\nThaumaturgy: Gain Advantage on Intimidation and Performance Checks. This is another helpful noncombat-related cantrip.\n\nSpell Selection\n\nGuiding Bolt: 4d6 Radiant damage that grants Advantage on the next Attack Roll against the target. This is very high damage early and helpful because of the Advantage component. Consider this your main offensive spell.\n\nHealing Word: 1d4 Heal a creature you can see up to 18m away with a bonus action. Since this is a bonus action heal, you can combine it with an action-based heal like Cure Wounds or others to do two heals in one turn.\n\nInflict Wounds: 3d10 damage necrotic. Used in melee range for good damage.\n\nBless: Up to 3 creatures gain a +1d4 bonus to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws. This spell requires concentration which can be broken, but it can be but it can be pre-cast before combat with a long 10-turn duration. This drastically helps melee build land attacks like a Fighter and Barbarian.\n\nCure Wounds: 1d8 heal requiring you to touch a creature to heal it. Melee-based heal that isn’t that powerful but at early levels it can be combined with Healing Word for two heals in one turn.\n\nShield of Faith: Use a bonus action to grant 2 AC to a character. Useful because this spell requires bonus action, not an action to provide protection.\n\nSubclass Feature\n\nDisciple of Life: Your devotion empowers your healing Spells. When casting a healing spell, the target regains additional Hit Points equal to 2 + Spell’s level.\n\nShadowheart Gameplay\n\nGameplay at this level is using Guiding Bolt for damage entirely. You can combine Healing Word and Cure Wounds for two heals in one turn. You can also use Shield of Faith or Bless as a buff that requires concentration but not both. Remember, you will be dreadfully low on spell slots at this level, so use a lot of Fire Bolt cantrips with Shadowheart for damage without consuming a spell slot. As you progress in level, this isn’t an issue but can be hard to manage at a lower level. Also constantly look for resting supplies and barrels and crates so you can rest frequently until higher levels.\n\nHow I play Shadowheart at this level is using Shield of Faith a lot of the time outside of combat on a “squishy” ally. Someone who has a low Armour Class and seems to die or take aggro. This will help that character avoid damage. Next, I start my turn with a buff like Blessed if I’m not using Shield of Faith. Both require concentration, and most likely you will have one concentration spell active at all times as a buff or debuff. Then you fire off Guiding Bolt at range, Fire Bolt for cantrip with low spell slots, or Sacred Flame when you don’t have a direct line of sight.\n\nFor healing, you have an action-based heal, Cure Wounds, and bonus action heal, Healing Word. You will get two improved versions of these spells later in the game so get familiar with them. Early on, there won’t be much damage or buffs needing to be applied. At levels 4, 5, 7, and 9 expect big spikes in power. You get summons, better spells, feats, and so forth that dramatically increase your utility.\n\nShadowheart Weakness\n\nThe biggest issue you need to be aware of with the Cleric is lack of initiative due to lower Dexterity and movement speed. Lower initiative means you go later in the combat round. This leaves you vulnerable to stuns, which in our gear section I suggest items that can help mitigate these problems. For lackluster speed and movement, the Misty Step spell is your best friend. You can get an Amulet that provides free use of Misty Step once per short rest. Also, be on the lookout at traders for scrolls of this and stock up. Generally, you use Misty Step once per combat round either to jump into healing range or jump out when pressured.\n\nLastly, you have a lack of bonus action utility and we do not advise you to multiclass her. You want to use your bonus action later for Spiritual Weapon, Misty Step, and Healing Word (heal spell). You also want to consider any spell or spell scroll that allows you to cast a spell as a bonus action like Shield. Moreover, consider using Elixirs which last until a long rest. You can use fire resistance early which helps in certain situations and later Elixir of Universal Resistance which makes you near god-like.\n\nEarly Priorities\n\nShadowheart should be pretty survivable if you picked the Life subclass and heavy armour with one hand and shield. Within a few hours of gameplay, go North and look for two Vendors in the Hollowed City. They will sell a +1 Scale or Chain Mail armour. This can get your AC to 17 or 18 depending straight away. Throw on Shield of Faith, and you can reach 20 AC within a few hours becoming VERY tanky. Here’s your goal at this level and what to work towards:\n\nUpgrade armor to heavy +1\n\nUpgrading shield to uncommon\n\nThis should get you to 17 or 18 AC\n\nStocking up on scrolls of Misty Step\n\nStock up on camping supplies for a long rest\n\nBuy every crafting material from vendors\n\nAcquire Amulet of Misty Step\n\nLook below for our gear suggestions, but this will help you out dramatically during your playthrough and make it much more enjoyable. Don’t sleep on the vendors in Act 1 BG3, they sell a lot of good items very early which can help you get to Act 2, then you can do the same thing all over again. The best-in-slot items will come from quest turn-ins and puzzles, but the alternatives are good as well. Shadowheart gameplay is, buff, damage, react and heal when health is low. Enjoy the rest of the build and suggestions, it’s a fun one!\n\nSpell Loadout at level 1: Healing Word, Cure Wounds, Inflict Wounds, Guiding Bolt, and Shield of Faith.\n\nLevel 2\n\nAt level two your spells will largely stay the same. You will have prepared spells and can pick up to 5 to learn and swap out outside of combat the ones you’ve already learned. Next, you will get granted Turn Undead and Preserve Life via your subclass and we recommend you take the spell Command.\n\nSpell Selection\n\nCommand: Command a creature to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon 18m requiring concentration. This is a powerful area-based crowd-control effect that can force weapons to drop. Use this early in the game when overwhelmed with enemies.\n\nSubclass Features\n\nTurn Undead: Inflicts Turned. Present your holy symbol and pray. Each undead that can see or hear you is forced to flee from you.\n\nPreserve Life: Evoke a healing energy that restores (3*Cleric Level) hit points to allied creatures. Does not affect undead and constructs.\n\nThe gameplay stays the same for the most part at this level. The addition of Preserve Life gives you a massive area-based healing that requires charges. While this healing uses an action, it’s extraordinarily strong because the healing gets more powerful the higher levels you become. Moreover, it doesn’t use a spell slot and should be your primary area-based healing spell early and even late. Turn Undead can be handy in specific fights. The Command spell is a great addition for crowd control, use it to drop opponents’ weapons or put them in prone.\n\nSpell Loadout at level 2: Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Healing Word, Command, Inflict Wounds\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel three you will unlock two level 2 spells and an additional level 1 spell. Will take Spiritual Weapon for our level two spell slot. Will also get two free spells from Life Domain.\n\nSpell Selection\n\nSpiritual Weapon: Summon a spiritual weapon that can attack enemies nearby. This is amazing because you can use bonus action AND it doesn’t cost concentration. Recommend spear form, each form has a different attack that can debuff the enemy.\n\nSubclass Feature\n\nAid: Bolster your allies with toughness and resolve to heal and increase their hit point maximum.\n\nLesser Restoration: Cure a creature from disease, poison, paralysis, or blindness.\n\nGameplay at this level changes a bit considering how Spiritual Weapon works. Since this is a bonus action, you can use it in conjunction with an action in the same turn. Also, this can be pre-cast before combat along with Bless if you know an encounter is about to unfold. This spell also doesn’t cost concentration and it soaks up damage and does a bit as well, making it powerful at this stage of the game. Consider Inflict Wounds your flex spell which can be dropped for something else (Sanctuary) if you do not use it.\n\nSpell Loadout at level 3: Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Healing Word, Command, Inflict Wounds, Spiritual Weapon\n\nLevel 4\n\nAt level four, the Cleric gets one cantrip, one more prepared spell, and a feat or ability improvement. We suggest you increase your ability score Wisdom by 2. Our goal is to increase the effectiveness of our healing so take the Ability Improvement feat and put two ability points into Wisdom. We will select Warding Bond for our spell and Blade Ward for our cantrip.\n\nCantrip Selection\n\nBlade Ward: Take only half of the damage from Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing attacks. This is a decent cantrip when expecting incoming melee damage.\n\nSpell Selection\n\nWarding Bond: The target gains +1 on AC, +1 on saving throws, and resistance to all damage, but the caster shares damage. This is helpful because it lasts until a long rest and can be pre-cast outside of combat.\n\nGameplay at this level doesn’t change much, you can use Warding Bond for a buff and expect more damage and healing with a higher ability score. Sanctuary and Hold Person are two alternative options at this level. Sanctuary makes a target un-targetable though it can take area-based damage. Hold Person is another powerful stun that can lock a target in place. This is helpful for humanoid boss fights or annoying Githyanki.\n\nSpell Loadout at level 4: Healing Word, Inflict Wounds, Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Command, Spiritual Weapon, Warding Bond.\n\nLevel 5\n\nAt level five, the Life Cleric gets two free spells via your subclass and you get to pick a level 3 spell. The best healing option here is Mass Healing Word because it’s massive AOE healing and requires a bonus Action rather than an action.\n\nSubclass Spells\n\nRevivify: Revive a companion. They return to life with 1 hit point. Can be used to revive Ally which I almost always throw a potion rather than this spell because they return with more HP.\n\nBeacon of Hope: Your allies will regain the maximum hit points possible when healed. They also gain Advantage on Wisdom Saving Throws and Death Saving Throws. Used as our concentration spell when you expect heavy damage and you won’t be doing anything but healing each turn.\n\nSpell Selection\n\nMass Healing Word: heal for 1d4+3 up to 6 creatures. Using a bonus action his is a very powerful wide area-based heal that can be combined with an action in the same turn.\n\nAt this level, Mass Healing Word is an upgraded version of Healing Word. You can now do an area-based heal of 6 creatures with a bonus action. Additionally, you can drop another level 2 spell and pick up Glyph of Warding if you want more offensive pressure. Animate Dead is helpful if you like allies fighting alongside you, however, it can go against Shadowheart’s lore background.\n\nSpell Loadout at level 5: Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Healing Word, Command, Inflict Wounds, Spiritual Weapon, Warding Bond, Hold Person, Mass Healing Word, Glyph of Warding.\n\nLevel 6\n\nAt level six for a Life Cleric, you gain another level 3 spell, another Channel Divinity Charge, and a Blessed Healer Passive. Here is the recommendation for the Baldur’s Gate 3: Best Shadowheart Companion Build:\n\nClass Features:\n\nChannel Divinity Charges: either Preserved Life or Turn Undead. Preserved Life is preferred because it’s a powerful 9m are based heal. At this level you have two.\n\nBlessed Healer: When you cast a healing spell of Level 1 or higher on another creature, you regain hit points equal to 2+ the spell’s level. Healing others essentially heals you.\n\nSpells Selection\n\nGlyph of Warding: Inscribe a circle of arcane glyphs on the ground that trigger a magical effect when stepped on by an enemy. This spell is useful because you can proc elemental effects and do massive area damage.\n\nGameplay at this level is summoning Spiritual Weapon with bonus action on the first turn. Usually casting Bless on the team before combat or first turn. Then use Guiding Bolt or Glyph of Warding for damage. Mass Healing Word and another heal Preserved Life for big healing.\n\nEnding Act 1\n\nAt this level, you should be close to transitioning out of Act 1. Make sure to check vendors and stock up on camp and alchemy supplies. Moreover, look over the best Act 1 items, and don’t forget the legendary weapon Blood of Lathander. While this quest can be tedious and annoying, it’s one of the best weapons for Shadowheart and can be used the entire game. Lastly, make sure to complete the Underdark and Grymforge if you can. The heavy Adamantine Armour is incredible and can last you until Act 3.\n\nSpell Loadout at level 6: Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Healing Word, Command, Inflict Wounds, Spiritual Weapon, Warding Bond, Hold Person, Mass Healing Word, Glyph of Warding\n\nLevel 7\n\nAt level 7, the Life Cleric gains one level 4 spell slot, and two subclass-specific spells, Death Ward and Guardian of Faith.\n\nSubclass Spells\n\nDeath Ward: When the target drops to 0 hp for the first time, it automatically returns to 1 hp. This is essentially a Relentless Endurance Half-Orc racial feature mimic. It’s very handy to use on difficult boss fights where you assume someone on your team will get one shot on turn one.\n\nGuardian of Faith: Hostile creatures within a 10-ft radius of the created guardian must succeed on a Dex. save or take 20 radiant damage. This summonses a created guardian which cannot move but deals damage in a 10ft radius. Every time it does damage, it takes damage. The nice thing about this spell is it can be used in conjunction with a Spiritual Weapon. One is an action, one a bonus action and BOTH do not require concentration. So, on turn one, you can drop down Guardian in the middle of the action along with Spiritual Weapon.\n\nSpells Selection\n\nFreedom of Movement: The Target’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, spells or water. A beneficial spell for movement in or outside of combat.\n\nGameplay at Midgame\n\nNear the middle of the game, you can utilize main summoning abilities, especially on turn one. Your first turn is generally the most important if you can cast both summonses on turn one using an action and a bonus action (Guardian of Faith and Spiritual Weapon). From here, you go into priority mode emphasizing healing and buffs with Bless.\n\nIf everyone is high on health, use Glyph of Warding for area damage and Guiding Bolt for a single target. If you feel you lack crowd control (CC) swap out Freedom of Movement for Banishment which is a great single-target CC. You can also use scrolls for crowd control to avoid using spell slots or different prepared spells. Remember the Cleric class and Shadowheart can swap in and out spells outside of combat. Don’t be afraid to experiment and deviate from our spell suggestions if you are don’t feel one is useful.\n\nSpell Loadout at level 7: Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Healing Word, Command, Inflict Wounds, Spiritual Weapon, Warding Bond, Hold Person, Mass Healing Word, Glyph of Warding, Freedom of Movement\n\nLevel 8\n\nAt level 8 the Life Cleric gets Divine Strike, an additional level 4 spell slot, and a feat. Here’s what we suggest at this level.\n\nFeat War Caster\n\nWar Caster: You gain Advantage on Saving Throws to maintain Concentration on a spell. You can also use a reaction to cast Shocking Grasp at a target moving out of melee range. So, War Caster helps dramatically maintain concentration which is almost always active for our build. We will use the level 12 feat to push our Wisdom to 18, but after testing this was more helpful at level 8.\n\nSpells Selection\n\nRemove Curse: Touch a creature or object to remove all Curses and Hexes affecting it. This is a niche spell in this slot, Banishment is a good substitute if you find it lacking.\n\nSubclass Feature\n\nDivine Strike: Strike a foe with your weapon as it becomes wreathed in gleaming radiance. This weapon damage action isn’t our priority since we are a support build and Guiding Bolt fills out single-target needs.\n\nGameplay: Not many changes at this level as you won’t be using Divine Strike, but expect better luck maintaining concentration which will be helpful to keeping important spells active while taking pressure.\n\nSpell Loadout at level 8: Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Healing Word, Command, Inflict Wounds, Spiritual Weapon, Warding Bond, Hold Person, Mass Healing Word, Glyph of Warding, Freedom of Movement, Remove Curse\n\nLevel 9\n\nAt level 9, the Cleric gets two free spells, Mass Cure Wounds, Great Restoration, 1 level 4 spell slot, 1 level 5 spell slot, and an additional prepared spell bringing the total to 13. I also have some thoughts on multi-classing the cleric at this level. Here are our recommendations:\n\nSpells Selection\n\nInsect Plague: 4d10 piercing damage Locust attack everyone within range, make the area Difficult Terrain, and impose Disadvantage on Perception Checks. This requires concentration but this spell does great damage in a massive area and hinders movement though requires concentration.\n\nFlame Strike: 10-60 damage Make a pillar of divine fire roar down from the heavens like the wrath of affronted angels. On Save: Targets still take half damage. Doesn’t require concentration and a harder-hitting area-based spell than Glyph of Warding.\n\nSubclass Features\n\nMass Cure Wounds: Up to 6 creatures regain 3d8+Spell Ability modifier\n\nGreater Restoration: End one condition (charmed or petrified), one curse, any ability scores or hp reduction, or one exhaustion level.\n\nGameplay: at this level, you have much better area-based healing and damage. You now have two high-level spells that can be used with or without concentration and even better healing making this level a big leap in power.\n\nMulti-Class Options\n\nAt level 9, the Cleric can decide to multi-class. This has some pros and cons and I’ve found it better to fully level the Life Cleric so you can reach level 6 spells. Here’s a brief breakdown of options:\n\nFighter (two levels): The fighter with two levels has Action Surge. This gives you an additional action once per fight and recharges on short rest. The Clerics main issue is lacking multiple actions, and this helps to solve that. You do lose out on level 6 spells and another feat but it’s an option.\n\nRogue (four levels): The Thief and Rogue combination is a powerful way to increase Shadowheart’s mobility and bonus action. With Fast Hands, you gain an additional bonus action alongside cunning actions. These allow Dash, Hide, and Disengaged to be used with a bonus action rather than an action. However, you will sacrifice some spells in the end-game that might make it not worth considering, but Thief Rogue is an option.\n\nCleric Level 12: this is the way I prefer because you get access to level 5 and 6 spells and another feat pushing our Wisdom to 20 with War Caster. Something about summoning a Cambion and Spiritual Weapon on turn one makes it so fun and very effective.\n\nLevel 9 Cleric Prepared Spells: Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Healing Word, Command, Inflict Wounds, Spiritual Weapon, Warding Bond, Hold Person, Mass Healing Word, Glyph of Warding, Freedom of Movement, Insect Plague, Flame Strike\n\nLevel 10\n\nAt level 10, the Life Cleric gets a subclass feature Divine Intervention, one cantrip, another spell slot, and another prepared spell.\n\nSubclass Feature\n\nDivine Intervention: You can cast Divine Intervention to invoke your God’s aid. Once used, this can never be used again. You have a couple of options with this one-time-only spell, but the obvious one is a damage spell. It’s a massive area and huge damage. I suggest saving this for the last boss or something you just cannot complete.\n\nCantrip\n\nLight: Infuse an object with an aura of light. This is an occasionally used utility spell.\n\nSpell Selection\n\nPlanar Binding: Target an otherworldly creature and attach its consciousness to your own. It will follow and fight for you as an ally. Provides decent crowd control if the percentage is high enough, over 60%.\n\nDivine Intervention\n\nYou should save Divine Intervention for the final fight of the game where damage is critical to complete the story. However, you can ‘cheese’ this spell and hire a hireling. With a Hireling, you can respec to Life Cleric and cast one of the versions which gives you a free legendary mace. You can then equip Shadowheart with it and dismiss the companion. This is extremely cheesy, but helpful if you lack gear from Act 1.\n\nLevel 10 Cleric Prepared Spells: Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Healing Word, Command, Inflict Wounds, Spiritual Weapon, Warding Bond, Hold Person, Mass Healing Word, Glyph of Warding, Freedom of Movement, Insect Plague, Flame Strike, Planar Binding\n\nLevel 11\n\nAt Level 11, you get access to the final Level 6 spell slot.\n\nSpell Selection (drop Planar Binding)\n\nPlanar Ally: Summon a deva, djinn, or cambion to help the caster until a long rest.\n\nHeal: heal for 70 damage, heal a target’s wounds, and remove Blindness and any diseases.\n\nCleric Prepared Spells: Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Healing Word, Command, Inflict Wounds, Spiritual Weapon, Warding Bond, Hold Person, Mass Healing Word, Glyph of Warding, Freedom of Movement, Insect Plague, Flame Strike, Planar Ally, Heal\n\nPlanar Ally\n\nWe prefer using my 6 spells for Planar Ally after a long rest. It comes with so much health and doesn’t require concentration. Additionally, it provides damage, distraction and it just looks cool! You want to cast this spell after every long rest because the ally will follow you and not interfere in dialogue. Moreover, it can do serious damage and provide a distraction for enemies. Remember, you will only get 1 level 6 spell slot unless you have the Legendary Staff found early in Act 3. Quarterstaff and Shields can be combined so consider this an option.\n\nLevel 12\n\nCongratulations on reaching the maximum level of 12 with Shadowheart! At this level the Life Cleric, we get one spell and one more feat. Here are the recommended final choices for the Baldur’s Gate 3: Best Shadowheart Companion Build:\n\nFeat: +2 ability improvement to 20 Wisdom. Some items can get you to 22 but this is easy and helps with healing, damage, and success chance.\n\nSpell Selection: Heroes’ Feast: Produce a feast for 12 guests that cures diseases, immunizes to poison, and increases hp by 2d10 for 24 hours. This spell helps with status effects and increasing health. I prefer Planar Ally, but this has some good utility.\n\nShadowheart Final Level\n\nGameplay: At max level, you should feel very powerful. Using multiple summons, powerful single target, and area-based healing along with great damage. The Life Cleric surprisingly has a ton of damage and you can burst your team up with one turn using action and bonus action combination.\n\nLevel 12 Cleric Prepared Spells: Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith, Healing Word, Command, Inflict Wounds, Spiritual Weapon, Warding Bond, Hold Person, Mass Healing Word, Glyph of Warding, Freedom of Movement, Insect Plague, Flame Strike, Planar Ally, Heal, Hero’s Feast\n\nRecommended Weapons and Armor\n\nIn Games like Baldur’s Gate 3, you’ll explore the world, loot chests and your enemies’ dead bodies, and complete quests, and all those activities can reward you with useful items, potions, armor, weapons, scrolls, and much more.
