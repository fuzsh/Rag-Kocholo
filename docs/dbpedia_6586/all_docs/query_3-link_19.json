        "text": "This review was originally posted to Twitter on September 28, 2019.\n\nInitial release: July 28, 2005 (Japan)\n\nPlatform: PlayStation 2\n\nDeveloper: Nautilus\n\nJust when you thought Shadow Hearts couldn’t get any wackier, Nautilus pushed out one more title to bank on Shadow Hearts Covenant’s massive popularity. But whereas Covenant was a classic of the platform, Shadow Hearts: From the New World is a bit of a step down.\n\nThat’s not to say it’s a bad game; it represents a further refinement of the combat system, for starters, and it presents a truly eclectic, even zany, cast of characters. But it’s that zaniness that’s the problem, tilting the balance too far in the other direction from the original. It’s definitely not intended to be an official threequel, either; though it’s meant to tie up some loose ends left behind from Covenant, it’s still officially a spinoff, moving the action away from the traditional Eurasian setting into the Americas (North and South.) With the setting change comes all new locations and characters, though recurring character Roger Bacon is back, as is Lenny from Covenant, serving as the decent person he’s always been under the surface. One of Covenant’s Magimel brothers is back as well, running a traveling shop with his “friend.”\n\nThat being said, the core cast is as all American (well, with some exceptions) as you can get. Aside from Johnny Garland, the protagonist, a 16 year old boy suffering from amnesia after an accident (ugh) who runs a detective agency in late 1920s New York City, you also get: …Frank, a middle aged white ninja who trained at a secret ninja village in Brazil (okay…); Shania, a Native American princess with the same fusion power as Yuri from the main games; Natan, who’s at least more talkative than the usual strong-and-silent Native American stereotye, Madame Mao, a Chicago crime underboss and Hollywood actress who happens to be a giant talking cat who knows drunken fist (yeah…); Ricardo, a mariachi whose guitar transforms into guns, rocket launchers and flamethrowers; and Hilda, a vampire whose powers change with her weight.\n\nSo yeah, it’s that kind of game.\n\nAll of these characters correspond in some way to the cast of Covenant; Frank for example is the obvious Joachim stand-in, relying mostly on raw physical power and even getting new weapons by just picking up random objects.\n\nThe basic plot is that fifteen years after the events of Covenant (the good ending being supposedly confirmed as canon), a certain major event that occurred at the midway point continues to have far-reaching effects across the world, breeding monsters in dark corners. Johnny Garland, sick of rescuing disappeared cats, takes on a job from a strange professor from Arkham University (heh) to find a guy who owes him bail money. Things inevitably go pearshaped, at which point Shania and Natan make their entrance. Meanwhile, a mysterious mute woman with eerie powers rescues a dangerous red-haired criminal on the run from the NYPD. Known only as Lady and Killer, they cut a swath of terror across the United States and South America, aided by Gilbert, Johnny’s mysterious original client. The rest of the game is the crew tracking down Lady and Killer, who Gilbert is trying to manipulate for his own ends. As to what those ends are, that’s revealed halfway through the game, when the plot has a time-skip (in true Shadow Hearts fashion) and South America opens up.\n\nEverything that made Shadow Hearts: Covenant great is still here. The Judgment Ring returns, and it’s just as customizable as before. While the way distributing magic is set up has been changed, you can still assign just about any magic to any character. Combos return as well. Combat has been tweaked slightly with the addition of “stocks.” Stocks work like a limit break bar that fills up as characters take damage or give it, and can be filled twice. Depending on stock levels, characters can do combos, double moves, or even both simultaneously. However, enemies also have stock bars, and a boss pulling off a double move can be devastating. Both you and the enemy can perform attacks that reduce each other’s stock, adding another strategic layer to the already rather freewheeling combat system.\n\nThe magic system has been tweaked as well. Gone is the old crest system; in its place are a set number of “stellar charts” using symbols of the Zodiac, each having a number of nodes that you can place spells into — and a node’s level determines how high a spell’s level can be. It’s somewhat more limiting than the old crest magic system, but if you’ve got the money to spend, Gerard’s “friend” will upgrade nodes for you for a price, able to raise its level, change its type, reduce its mana cost or increase its power. In a sense, it’s a less-awful, less-expensive version of the original game’s “acupuncture” system, and as nodes also level up by themselves over time, you don’t need to spend more than necessary to use new, more powerful spells, allowing you a bit of wiggle room.\n\nSo where does this game go wrong where Covenant didn’t? it’s simple. The main issue is that things start to fall apart in the second half. The dungeons stop being interesting, the plot leans much harder into the magical indigenous stuff, and the combat gets more annoying. While the series’ horror elements are back in full force for this game, with horrifying monster designs on par with the original game or even Koudelka, the writing is overall sillier and much less coherent. The story’s progression feels pretty random in general. It also plays much faster and looser with historical figures; Al Capone was never as friendly (nor handsome) as the real person (and he certainly wasn’t frenemies with Elliot Ness.) Howard Philips Lovecraft was a xenophobic shut-in, not a college professor who ran a monster arena on the side. Ultimately the game feels like a mishmash of ideas that Nautilus just couldn’t quite tie together; it’s like the idea of having a game set in the Americas was more important than the execution. And while there’s always been deliberate anachronisms, they’re out of control here.\n\nShadow Hearts has always been weird going back to Koudelka, but From the New World embraces the weirdness whole-heartedly, which incidentally makes it feel much more dated than Covenant despite running on the same engine, the same hardware, and coming out only a couple years later. This is probably why most Shadow Hearts fans name Covenant as their favorite in spite of the mechanical improvements that New World offers; jRPGs live and die on good stories, and while New World is not a bad game by any stretch, its story just doesn’t reach the heights that Covenant does.\n\nFinal thoughts: in spite of everything, this is still a great game, and a fine denouement to the outstandingly brilliant Covenant. But it’s ultimately never going to be anything more than a spinoff; hope springs eternal for a proper Shadow Hearts 3. In the mean time, we’re probably just going to have to content ourselves with Penny Blood, whenever that actually comes out.\n\n-june❤"
