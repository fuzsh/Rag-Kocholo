It's seems to me like a game deserving to be part of the series.\n\nYeah, the game definitely holds its own as part of the series. I was a little sad that there weren't some more direct connections to the other two games but the story is still decent. And of course, the gameplay is awesome as always. Though there aren't as many fusions in this game, they've done a wonderful job of making each one look extremely unique. And the sequences for those fusions are just beautiful. I'm actually in my 24th hour of playing and am completely addicted so yay!"
