        "text": "Disclaimer: the following post will have spoilers concerning the video games for the PS2 called Shadow Hearts and Shadow Hearts 2: Covenant. I will try to limit them, but be aware that they will exist.\n\nDear Reader,\n\nI’ve done a few posts about video games. My progression through them, reviews, etc., but this one in particular has a special place in my heart. It rises above the others, even though there have been many games I have loved since I first played it. It still is a perfect example of incredible storytelling, and as I learn more about video games as a creative medium, I find that these two games are an excellent example of ART, or as close as video games have been able to come to it. There has been many a discussion as of late about games and their artistic value (and goodness a whole lot of drama and danger to accompany it). Video games continue to struggle to become a true artform, such as literature and film, and as it navigates closer to that goal, there are pieces here and there in video games that contribute toward that journey. The more I learn about these bits and pieces when they are brought to the surface by analysts, the more I realize that the video games of Shadow Hearts and Shadow Hearts 2: Covenant (henceforth to be referenced as SH and SH2 for abbreviation and clarification purposes) may have just achieved that goal that video games still struggle to reach. I would argue that Shadow Hearts and its sequel, as a unified whole and one conclusive story (as they are direct sequels of each other), may be the first “literary” video game. The first video game that comes the closest to achieving the lofty position of true art.\n\nThat’s a pretty bold claim, I know.\n\nArt, as a generic term, can have a multitude of meanings. There are requirements that make a thing (movie, book, etc.) a piece of “art”, that can make it “literary.” Many video games have one aspect to them that raises them above just entertainment, fewer have two or three. There are “artsy” games. There are games that make you think. There are games that move you, that have elements of high literature and creativity, that have engaging stories and gameplay, push boundaries of what’s expected in a game, what topics to discuss and how they’re discussed. But even rarer is it to find a game that incorporates all of these things.\n\nDefining the setting of SH and SH2 is an integral part, because I feel that the setting contributes a great deal to the story, the mood, the artistic and thematic value of the game. In a way, the world plays as much of a role in the games as the characters do. The events and locations are as much characters as the characters themselves. And I say that because, to this day, my brothers and I still will shout “PRAGUE!” whenever we mention it, thinking immediately of the image the game portrays of the city and how the city itself becomes a character in the first game (even if it ultimately is a completely inaccurate representation of the city itself). There is as much affection for the locations as there is for the characters. But, of course, setting is more than just location. It’s era. It’s the world in which the story takes place. For these games, the “world” is our own, just a slightly alternative version.\n\nThe year is 1913, the first World War looms in the horizon. The Japanese military are present in Manchuria and Shanghai. The first half of the first game takes place in China, bouncing from town to town, dodging the Japanese military. The second half takes place in Europe: Prague, London, Rouen, France, and Bistrița, Romania (referred to as “Bistriz” the German spelling of the city). While character clothing is not era specific in most cases, the world of the game is solid. You can see the inevitable fracturing of the world on the horizon. Some places are modern, some places old and forgotten. And while the history of the world is not a big player in the games, the subtlety of its presence affects the actions of the characters and the events. That aside, the game takes liberties with the history (it is a fiction after all) and makes it alternative by adding, well, monsters. Demons and creatures of the dark sciences, mystical science and biological science, concentrate in areas where the energy of the place has been befouled in some way. There are no real monsters lurking on the streets of Shanghai or London, but in the dark, bleak orphanage where terrible experiments are happening, monsters thrive. Magic isn’t a tangible thing that can be accessed by everyone, but it does exist in some form. The exorcist… is, well, a real, honest to God exorcist. The Chinese adept uses Chinese mysticism and science and kung fu to enhance his magical energies. Psychics are a real thing. Vampires exist. Specters hide in paintings and then warp the space around you. But none of these things are so common place that the average person is aware of them all the time. Alchemy, sorcery and science, all combine into a steampunk-with-magic universe set in our own real world 1913. Ghosts stand outside haunting the streets of Prague because they lost their way. After the massacre of a Chinese village by the Japanese, the animals of the town, now starving, ate the humans and became humanoid and monstrous, needing more human flesh to feed upon. The locations are small, the world not open, the traveling too simple and basic, but despite this, the places feel alive, real, authentic. Prague is perhaps a handful of frames of one single street, and yet all that happens in that one stretch of street impresses itself upon you, and the image is still one I can pull up in my mind, years afterward, with ease. Bistriz is actually not the city at all, but the farmlands on the outskirts of it, and still the creepy mist of the dangers lurking there linger. It’s so simple and yet very well crafted and the details, though small, are significant.\n\nI should mention that the game could be called a “horror fantasy” (in fact, I’m sure somewhere it is labeled that). The monsters are certainly horrific. There’s a Lovecraftian edge to the designs of the world and demons, to even an existential horror of what is truly God. So there’s your setting. A unique blend of horror, history and real-world fantasy that makes it wholly it’s own thing. West and East meet in this creative mishmash of a world that is both eerily familiar and terrifyingly foreign.\n\nWhile the setting has an almost character-like role in the game, the characters themselves are what truly push this game beyond just a fun video game and into something of a more literary nature. Extra Credits discusses race, sexual diversity, and female characters in several different videos. In the course of these discussions and analyses, they discuss how the development of the character, their creation and their story as told through the medium, and how others react to them, inform us. We bring with us our conceptions of race, sexuality and gender, but how the game uses our baggage about these subjects shows us a game well crafted in story and character—or so badly crafted we become upset on how it’s handled or done. I will not say SH or SH2 is a perfect game in any aspect of diversity, but it pushed boundaries well ahead of its time, boundaries that got, inevitably, pushed too far when it changed hands (Shadow Hearts: From the New World (the “third” game) is exactly what you should NEVER EVER DO with gender, sexual or racial diversity. It took a great concept and destroyed it with stereotypes).\n\nShadow Hearts is not racially diverse, sexually diverse or even has a whole lot of women. But what it does have, it does well. Like, really well. And it takes steps down a path that video games even since have barely trodded. Shadow Hearts is a mostly white cast. A Swedish exorcist, a French Spy, a Romanian vampire, a London street rat. But it also has a Chinese adept and a half Japanese half Russian. Fascinatingly, it’s the mixed race character that is your MAIN character. There are two women, while the rest are men, however, it is the exorcist and the spy that are the female characters. The French spy is in actuality the game version of Mata Hari, inaccurate to the real person, but a reference to her regardless. In SH2, the racial diversity is slightly increased with more characters of varying ethnicity, though still mainly European and Asian: an Italian fortuneteller, a German soldier, a Russian princess, a Japanese bodyguard, a Romanian vampire wrestler turned vigilante (no, I’m not kidding), a (possibly?) French puppeteer, and, well, a wolf. The main protagonist of the first game, the mixed Russian-Japanese character returns as the main protagonist in the second game as well.\n\nBeyond the main cast, the secondary characters become more and more diverse (including a black USAn and an Indian wrestler), but really, where the game pushes the most boundaries for its time is in the sexual diversity. SH features one minor homosexual character who is an acupuncturist. His purpose in the game is to increase your compatibility and skill with your weapon through acupuncture and while the game doesn’t ever hide the fact that he’s gay, it is not as overt or over the top as it becomes in SH2. He’s not flamboyant, he’s not young, he’s not in the closet. And he’s Chinese. He just is. It’s done, well, perfectly, and he is just awesome, you love him. There’s general gender fluidity in the game, such as the heavy implication that the vampire is bisexual and when the Chinese adept is not ashamed to admit that the main character’s father made his heart flutter almost two decades previous. It also jokes about preconceived notions of sexuality. Depending on which characters is getting an acupuncture, the women are casual, the bisexual vampire is curious, and the men panic, even though it’s just acupuncture. In SH2, however, the developers upped the ante of sexual diversity, and pushed dangerously close into stereotype. The Romanian vampire wrestler is overtly gay, but not in a way where he is hitting on other men or is a drag queen or anything like that. He’s just… very clearly gay. His entire character is an exercise in turning stereotypes on its head. He looks like he belongs in the WWE, but is a vampire, and is gay. He’s Romanian with blond dreadlocks. And his vigilante mask, which doubles as his wrestling mask, is a sparkly, purple butterfly. And he’s completely confident in it. Yet, the game does not make it a centralized thing. He just is. The game is not about his gayness or the acceptance of his homosexuality. It is barely even discussed. What is discussed is that he’s the older brother to the bisexual vampire from the first game. Yes, we have a family of vampires in this game which tag along.\n\nDespite the walking the very fine edge of comedy and insult to the homosexual community, the game… somehow manages to stay right on that edge with this central character. There is love and acceptance for not just this main character that is homosexual, but for the other homosexuals in the game that have minor roles: a pair of twin French dressmakers and the Indian wrestler who trained the vampire, not to mention a guest appearance by the Chinese acupuncturist. It takes this gay comedy to a dangerously insulting and stereotypical level with the French dressmakers (they are much more stereotypically flamboyant, and it’s cringe-worthy), but also in a side quest. However, at the completion of said side quest, the sting is lessened by having the Russian princess become a fan girl in the process. No, I’m not joking. The pubescent princess becomes THE advocate and main supporter for all of the gay characters in the game, not just poking at the affection many female game and anime fans have for gay love, but also commenting on how it is the youngest generation that paves the way for the future acceptance of these varying sexual identities. And yes, it’s the girl who does it. The women (and the vampires) are the most accepting when it comes to every homosexual character in the games. And that brings me to the women.\n\nWhen one thinks of an exorcist, our first image may be the film. But inevitably, our mind imagines a priest, a man of the cloth, as it were, or even someone like Constantine. Fiction and history assigns this occupation, generally, to men. Our exorcist from SH is, essentially, classified under your standard “white mage” stereotype, which means, yes, she’s a she. She’s your healer, the main female protagonist, the main female love interest, etc. She has the pale features usually designated to such characters too. But that is almost exclusively where the similarities end. Yes, there are characteristics in those traits that are inherent to the character, but really her growth as a person is so vibrant, her personality so honest, that the player forgets that she’s supposed to be our stereotypical white mage. And the first thing the game does to undercut this is… well, she beats the hell out of crap with a big book.\n\nNo, again, I’m not kidding. Of course, I’m also talking about a physical attack, rather than a magical one. But she doesn’t zap stuff with a wand or a staff or even out of the pages of a book. She closes it, takes it in both hands, and beats the tar out of an enemy with a big ass book. Nothing I have ever played has made my jaw drop in amazement than the first time I physically attacked with her character. I laughed myself stupid and immediately she was ingrained into my heart. She beats up bad guys with a Bible. Just soak that in. It’s a level of realism that was wholly unexpected in a horror historical fantasy. She’s a lady exorcist, her equippable weapons are books (the Bible, tomes of magic and sorcery, ancient texts), and when she’s out of MP she bashes baddies with her big book. It’s so unexpectedly logical, one wonders how no one else though this before 2001.\n\nBook beatings aside, however, she pushes the boundaries of the main-love-interest-white-mage stereotype in other ways. She gets obviously annoyed, and has to force herself to exercise patience. She has the occasional stealth sarcasm that she dishes out. She’s an educated, intelligent Swedish woman. She’s polite, but straightforward. She doesn’t quite fit into any of the typical RPG white mage lady stereotypes. And a bloody exorcist. She’s not a priestess or miko, not blessed by a god, or just a student of white magic. She’s more than just healing magic. This is a woman who exorcises demons for a living. She uses her job to fund expenses in the second half of the game.\n\nAnd then, as the story progresses, decides to become romantically involved in a man who CAN BECOME A DEMON AT WILL.\n\nAcceptance is a recurring theme throughout the games. Accepting the eccentricities of others, accepting pain and loss, accepting friendship. And if anyone embodies that theme, it is this character. Her very existence is an exploration of the status quo as we know it. She is the daughter of what the game calls a “priest.” He works for the Vatican. From all accounts, he’s a priest (according to the English translation), but we know, in our real life universe, that priests don’t really get married, have kids, or go around being every day exorcists and teaching their kids to be exorcists too. Part of the alternative universe of this game? Most likely. But also an interesting comment on priesthood, family and women in religion as well, and without ever even discussing it. Another interesting aspect of her character is that she is the focus of the first half of SH. Her powers are sought after by both the Japanese military and a Chinese sorcerer. In the second half, she is your main character for a portion (while your original main character is MIA) and she sacrifices her own soul for the sake of the “hero.” While unsurprising from that kind of character, it is surprising to see the crushing consequences of such an action as the game progresses.\n\nHowever in SH2, she is a central part of the storyline, even though she is deceased. Even though she isn’t present, her spirit lingers throughout the entire game as a visceral presence, without ever actually being present. She is the reason one bad guy does what he does, she is part of the justification for another doing what he does, and she is the sole reason the main character, Yuri Hyuga (Urumof Hyuga in Japanese) even takes one step forward in any direction, ever.\n\nThis image and event doesn’t exist, nor does it occur in the second game, but it is a very accurate representation of the Yuri’s mental state and his actions throughout the course of the entire game. She is always there. She is always present, by his side, hovering behind him, with him, supporting him. All his actions are dictated by her ethereal presence, by their love. It is a powerful story and it is never overt or over explained. It is always there and you can feel it. Always feel it through the choices he makes. From sitting at a bar with an old friend discussing the past, to saving a life because it is what she would do, what she would want, what she would expect from him. From doing everything to bring her back to casting aside demons with sheer willpower alone when they threaten her. Her presence never goes away. She is a force for good and acceptance and peace in a way that most white mage character stereotypes only dream of being, and she does it without effort. She is a good woman. She is a strong woman. She is a broken woman who is unafraid to heal a broken man. She is a heroine and she is a damsel. She is a force for love, all aspects of it. From the darkest side to the purest. In all honesty, white mage characters want to be Alice Elliot when they grow up. Honestly, I could go on forever about how amazing she is, so I had better move on.\n\nThe other woman from the first game, our Mata Hari, the French spy, is comic relief (one of the first examples of a woman being the central comedian in a piece), a commentary on emotions of supporting characters, and the very image of a strong, confident, powerful woman. She loves explosives, she wears fishnets and a short skirt, she uses a gun and is a crack shot, she’s the “older” woman, and she suffers unrequited love (though you have to go out of your way to find it in the first game and second game). Her special attacks are comedic spy silliness, pure Bond camp, but she has a 1913 version of a spy cellphone, bombs and missile launchers she can call in. She uses a bazooka and even has James Bond level gadgetry. I mean. What. Where has anyone ever seen a full-fledged female spy making use of things BEYOND her sexuality, and in a fun way? She is the Sean Connery James Bond as a woman and without all sex. She gripes about being called “ma’am” instead of “miss,” but she refers to the main character as “sonny boy” (I can only imagine that the Japanese version must be “boyo” or “danshi”). She has no qualms about using her sexuality, but it is not her main focus as it usually is for women spies in film and video games and even her real world counterpart; it is not her only tool. She can build bombs and she loves to use them. She works stealth missions. She is independent, single and confident in her powers as a woman. And, as a playable character, she is well-balanced and extremely useful. She is not a white mage, not a melee fighter. She is ranged and support, but she is very, very good at it. The game is honest about her skill set, taking into account that… well, she IS a spy. As such she adds to the world building by implying that she knows more about the looming war than is willing to let on. She adds vibrancy to the group, comedy and history to the game, and has emotions that are shown through the dialogue and her actions. She makes only a brief appearance in the second game (again, only if you go out of your way to find her), and is very self-reflective about herself and her choices after the events of the first game.\n\nBut Margarete G. Zelle, our Mata Hari, pushes another boundary. Again, not only is there a woman with the occupation usually associated with men, but she is not even doing that job in the way many associate for women. She is a completely different kind of woman than the white mage, and yet, as a woman, she is a realistic representation. She has a sense of humor, she doesn’t hesitate to shoot a man dead, she doesn’t mind blowing up a whole building to rout the Japanese military, but she makes sure there are no innocent bystanders when she does so. She knows how to fly an airplane, knows how to get information, cracks jokes, threatens, and can be vulnerable. She respects her enemies and cares for her friends. She’s dedicated to her mission, but isn’t so blindly so that she won’t take advantage of a better scenario in order to complete it, even if she has to go off the rails to do so. She’s a spy. And she is amazing.\n\nAs far as NPC (non-player characters) go, the first game sports two women of depth and one of shadow. Briefly, the “shadow” female NPC is the main character’s Russian mother. We know next to nothing about her (except that she’s Russian and her name is Anne, according to English translations), but it is her attempt to protect her son and her death that forges the main character into the man he is at the beginning of the game. Her actions and death are a silent presence we can see in the main character and his actions, so while not a main character with any kind of growth, I felt like her presence was memorable, and apparently the creators agreed because her character is a focus of the second game. Also of note: Anne is a Russian woman, married to Japanese man, a military man. Yuri, their son, is twenty-three in 1913, which means he was born in 1890. Four years later, the Sino-Japanese War will be in full swing (which may explain why Jinpachiro (Ben in the English version of SH only) Hyuga moves his family to China. A high ranking military official married to a Russian woman would’ve probably raised questions. And the fact that he married her, despite the strain between the countries leading up to the war, adds another entire layer of depth to these off-screen characters as well as to our main protagonist.\n\nOf the actual NPCs, one is the psychic mother of the London street rat. She, it turns out, was the main character of the game that predates SH, a game entitled Koudelka for the original Playstation, where Koudelka Iasant is a gypsy psychic investigating a strange occurrence in Wales. In 1898, fifteen years before the events of Shadow Hearts, which, perfectly enough, is the same year when the events of the SH main character’s childhood, the ones that shape him concerning his mother, occurs. Excluding the “final” installment of the “series,” the continuity of SH, SH2 and its predecessor Koudelka is bloody spot on. Her character is fleshed out in her own game, and of course, fifteen years later with a son, her character becomes all the more real. She is the voice in Yuri Hyuga’s head and drives him forward. It also says a great deal about the writers and creators of these games that it was Koudelka who was the main character and the title character of her own game previously. In the era in which her game was forged, a female lead was a rare sight, highlighted by only a buxom tomb raider or an 8-bit classic. It gives us an idea of how these writers pushed boundaries with gender roles in games even from the original PlayStation 4-disc days. Especially since the game Koudelka was much more a horror historical puzzle fantasy, and not the kind of game, in anyway, that one would associate with an adult female lead.\n\nThe other female NPC is a reoccurring antagonist who is part of the Japanese military trying to hunt down our white mage. Historically, Japan is not known for being very forward when it comes to women’s rights, partially due to Chinese influence and later partially due to Western influence. The world of the game, already altered with demons and vampires and priest’s with children and real exorcists and psychics, takes another step in a surprisingly forward concept with a woman as a lieutenant colonel in the Japanese military. She is Japanese, the daughter of a general, was the son he never had, and while one could argue that the world sets that up so it’s not uncommon, one would be incorrect. It becomes increasingly clear that her position is hers because she fought for it. People accuse her of using her father’s prestige to secure her position, and she concedes, grudgingly, that her father did help. Her character is, however, very straightforward on how she didn’t want that help and consistently wants to be valued on her own merit. Other officers both treat her with respect and with disdain, because of her skill and because of her sex. Her character changes from the single-minded goal of proving her worth, because it just isn’t easy for a woman in this world, to doing what is right and paying the price for it. Her hair is short, she wears a pant suit, she is a bitch and a hard ass, and a woman desperately wanting her father to be proud of her. Her presence affects all the characters, NPC and PC alike, and she is valued by the characters, as antagonist and then as an ally. To a degree her presence in the game is a commentary on women’s roles, women’s rights, and a woman’s strength of character, opinion, belief and value. She doesn’t have a huge role in the grand scheme of the game, but her presence is so powerful that it informs the second game and the events that occur.\n\nIn the second game, the women in the party is increased by one, but sadly, they don’t get the kind of development and attention to their own growth of character, that the first game dished out with skilled ease. They are more present, and, as stated previously, the absent women, to a degree, have more development and presence and power in the plot as characters than the ones that are actually present. However, there interesting aspects to each of these women, so while there are flaws in their presentation, the pieces that make them are solid. The two deceased women from SH move the plot of SH2 forward. It is their loss that propels our protagonist and our antagonists toward their choices. A deceased girl begins the chain of events in SH2, and her presence as a ghost lingers almost as a representation of the two invisible ghosts that haunt the game. That is one of the most interesting aspects of this story: though dead, these two women continue to exist in the story of these lives.\n\nOf the main female playable characters, we have the German soldier (yes, another female military official), the Russian princess (the game plays on the myth that Anastasia Romanov escaped the revolution and the massacre of the royal family and that is our princess, so another actual historical figure even if she’s nothing like the real one), and the Italian fortuneteller, whose existence, generally, seems to be merely for the purpose of having a dark-skinned cast member and one other main female (though there are aspects of her that, if analyzed, put other things into stark relief). So, let’s start with our German soldier. SH2 takes place on the eve of the Seminal Tragedy. It takes place within a few months of the bad ending of SH, and German forces are already scouting, attacking, and investigating. Our German soldier is out to prove herself because she only has a position in the military because of her family’s noble standing in Munich (familiar?), and quickly finds herself torn between duty, what is right, her own past, her affection for the main character and her future. She is descended from a long line of Bavarian nobility, is a lieutenant in the German Imperial Army, head of the garrison at Luxemborg (authentically an impossible position for a woman of this era), and tasked with capturing a small French city. Again we see here in this game how the writers casually place a woman in a position, without ever questioning, though it is implied that it was her dedication and nobility that allowed her this placement. She has incredible martial skill with her rapiers, she is a fencer, and very early on she questions authority and the validity of the military’s intent. She is more an amalgamation of characters from the previous game, but with a personal character arc that is wholly different.\n\nShe is in love with someone who is in love with someone else. She is our main female protagonist in SH2, not our healer (unlike the previous game), but a warrior, a soldier. And, on some level, she is intended to be the new love interest. If you have never played SH, and played dozens of other J-RPGs, it is easy to believe that she’s the token love interest. But the game and the writers know better, and willingly allow those who have not played SH to fall into this illusion (just like, in a way, she falls into the illusion herself). Even she believes, on some level, that the main character would eventually get over his deceased love and fall in love with her. But it never happens. That is never her destiny. This is one of the few games (if only game), that is story-based, where the female and male protagonist look like they’re supposed to fall in love with each other, but don’t. Yuri is not over the death of Alice. He still loves her, and as the game progresses it becomes clear that he will love only her. Our German soldier, Karin, has to go through the character process of dealing with unrequited love. Of caring deeply for a man who will never love her, and coming to accept it. Again, that theme of acceptance appears. Now while this concept of unrequited love was touched on briefly via Margarete in SH, it is out in the open and on the forefront for SH2. Her pain, her sadness, her affection, her acceptance that she will love him regardless… It is all out in the open for the player to see and to experience. The game does not hold back in that regard. So while her character parts may not be a wholly new and boundary pushing concept (at least not one the creators of SH haven’t done before), her experience and how we experience it with her is a new experience.\n\nExtra Credits has an entire episode about the aspects of love in games that are explored and unexplored. They discuss how exploring these other aspects of relationships, beyond characters meet and fall in love, are part of developing video games past only entertainment and towards an actual form of art. While SH had your typical meet-and-fall-in-love romance, Alice’s sacrifice for Yuri’s soul, transforms the dynamic of the relationships. This is why I say that both games, together (not one or the other), is an example of a “literary” work. You have the high of falling in love, but now you have to deal with the crushing loss. Yuri struggles in the second game with the loss of Alice, even going so far as to attempt to bring her back from the dead. One of the characters, also dealing with the loss of a loved one, goes a different route and his path leads even further toward self-destruction. Karin has to deal with unrequited love, because Yuri still loves Alice. There is pain. There are repercussions to what the loss has done mentally to the characters it affects. It’s not a superficial loss like many other games, where the main character loses a loved one, but the game is designed for them to fall in love with someone new and move on, because the meet-and-fall-in-love is the real goal of the gaming experience. Shadow Hearts does not shy away from tackling this aspect of relationships. And it’s not solely in the men who lost their loves. Gepetto (the French puppeteer – yes, the game has odd humor) has lost his daughter, Cornelia, to illness. He copes with her loss, with his wife’s loss in a different manner than the younger men. Blanca (the wolf) has lost the young girl who saved his life. One of the NPCs, whom you meet in the second half of the game, a retired Japanese general, also battles with the loss of a daughter.\n\nAnd these are not the only relationships explored. There is the gay relationship, an on-again-and-off-again relationship between the Indian wrestler and your Romanian vampire, the former being the one who introduced the latter to both this aspect of his sexuality and wrestling. There is familial love. Yuri is reunited with his aunt and meets his cousin, whose father is also deceased. His mother’s love, his father’s loss, also come back to the forefront. There is puppy love and adoration. There is a comment on love that can be bought.\n\nAnd that brings me right back toward the women. Like we had Mata Hari in SH, in SH2 we have Anastasia Romanov. As the game progresses, it becomes clear how it finagles her mythical survival from assassination. She’s older than she’s supposed to be, but the game is allowed its moderately inaccurate history on the count of being a historical horror fantasy fiction. She’s not your stereotypical “dainty” princess, she’s more along the lines of the “bratty” princess. And yet, despite her brattish, rich girl tendencies and actions, her end goals are what has been common among the women in this game. She inquisitive, independent, confident and outgoing. She’s determined and fierce. She will protect her little brother and her country. When she loves, she loves with all her heart, and is the one who changes the tone of a scene concerning gay romance entirely. Her acceptance and enthusiasm for the love has the other characters also accept it. Her best friend becomes the giant gay vampire wrestler. The game, ultimately, implies that she escapes her historical fate, by moving to Japan and falling in love with a Japanese man (namely Yuri’s cousin Kurando), and echoes Yuri’s parents. But Anastasia, like Karin, present an interesting dilemma with SH2: while SH broke boundaries when it came to the women, SH2 just used what worked in the first one again. Not really a bad thing, because you can’t go wrong with strong, independent women, regardless of age, but it takes a little bit away from their turning stereotype on its head. Anastasia only goes so far as an undercut, because both “delicate princess” and “bratty princess” exist as stereotypes. Karin’s military background and placement existed in the previous game within the character of Lieutenant Colonel Kawashima. In effect, Anastasia and Karin are remixes of the women, NPC and PC, of SH.\n\nBut then there’s Lucia. There is more subtext than actual text concerning this character. There is surface, and then there is the iceberg lurking beneath the waters of its shallow presentation. She is a dancer and fortuneteller in Florence, Italy, dark-skinned and exotic, with a “mistress” named Carla. Even though the game never expressly says it, the implications are overt. Carla is a madam of a brothel and Lucia one of her prostitutes. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Lucia has been in the brothel since she was a young girl and was taught to cater to men. The game identifies her as “not very bright,” but her vapid personality and tinkling laugh is only a tool. The commentary may not be so blatantly said, but it still hits a player with its clarity. Her job is to please men. She is vapid because that’s what men want in their women. I say this isn’t an inadvertent context because the game subverts its own description of her. She is the only character in the game with TWO special abilities: aromatherapy and using the tarot cards. Why is the not-so-bright, dark-skinned, dark-haired, woman of color the only one with more skills than the rest of the PCs? The one that is obviously a member of the sex trade? The game says so little but the subtext speaks volumes. Her interaction with the men versus the women, even how Carla talks to her and about her, her interaction with an NPC who has been a “customer” before, a man who happens to be part of the British military… The game even implies that Carla knows what is coming on the horizon (World War I) and is using Lucia as a spy. The disappointing part is that all this subtext goes nowhere. It just is. In a way, that is a powerful enough statement. Despite all this altered history, horror and fantasy, there is a level of reality in Lucia’s character. She is no Karin who got her position in the military because of her nobility. She is no Anastasia, princess of Russia. Lucia is the hard reality of a woman, particularly a woman of color, in the world. It’s a bracing slap of reality in this dark comedy.\n\nSpeaking of people of color, the game is notably lax in that aspect, and yet, though few, they still break down barriers. Koudelka sported a main character that is a Welsh psychic gypsy woman. Her history is a rough one, like Lucia’s, bracing and realistic and harsh. That’s practically unheard of for a game from the 90s. Shadow Hearts has a Russian-Japanese mixed race main character and a Chinese adept as another PC. SH2 has that same mixed race main character, Yuri/Uru, and Lucia, our dark-skinned lady Italian (who may or may not actually be Italian) as our PCs, but then also has Lenny Curtis and the Great Gama. Lenny Curtis is an antagonist, but is also our token black man. But here’s where it gets interesting: even though he IS essentially a stereotype, there are things they included to turn that stereotype around. He is the head of assassin squad, not one of the grunt men. And it’s an actual assassin squad, not just a “gang.” He is praised for his dedication to his organization. He’s determined and capable, though the game describes him as not the brightest. He also wields a giant khanjar, an Arabic weapon, implying that this USAn is well-traveled. He is more of a “bad” bad guy stereotype than a token black man stereotype. The Great Gama is the Indian wrestler I mentioned previously. Yes, the gay one. The one that’s actually based on a real life human. The side quest… 100 rounds of fighting wrestlers up a tower (though you only do approximately forty actual battles, perhaps a reference to his practice routine of grappling with forty of his fellow wrestlers in the court). The Great Gama is the one who teaches the Romanian vampire how to wrestle. The real life Great Gama was the World Heavyweight Champion in 1910, four years before the events of this game. While awesome on so many levels, the game undercuts his impact with stereotype (namely his clothing, but they kept his epic mustache), and with terrible Indian food jokes. Borderline racist Indian food jokes. But then undermines their own stereotype as well as our own concept of hyper masculinity by making him homosexual. Or bisexual. The Great Gama, historically, had two wives. As previously mentioned, the game walks a fine line between being insulting and being celebratory. The comedy can get dangerously cringe-worthy (at times outrightly so like the curry jokes), but then pulls back with some amazing twist (like a Russian princess becoming a massive fan of a romance between two beefy wrestlers).\n\nThe real question ends up being how much of it is by design and how much is accidental, and does it even matter? When it comes to art forms, in music, literature, sculpture, painting, film, the intention of the creator eventually dissolves in the wake of how the people interpret that piece of art. Does it matter if the movie was only created in order to sell toys when it becomes a film beloved by an entire generation of people because of the meaning they took from it? Does the statue built by a commercial company to advertise have less value because of its origins despite the fact that people have found meaning and value in its existence? Sometimes a piece of art becomes greater than itself, greater than its creator, and its meanings and message, whether intentional or not, become more valuable than any intention. Did the creators of Koudelka, Shadow Hearts and Shadow Hearts 2: Covenant set out to make a series of games that when combined form, what I believe, to be the closest thing the video game industry has to a literary piece? Probably not. They just wanted to make a good game, a fun game, and had good ideas. The product of those good ideas, however, when combined created something dangerously close to art. There are flaws, goodness are there flaws, but no piece of art is perfect. But I do believe it is the game that comes the closest. I think it very nearly is.\n\nWhen it comes to “art” and games, however, another aspect has to be analyzed. It’s more than just story and character. Story and character are essential, but like in film and literature, having a good story and a good character isn’t enough to make it art. The writing needs to be good. The visuals, the design, the craft itself is of vital importance. So how does SH and SH2 measure up in that regard? It excels in some aspects and fails miserably in others. A comparison is needed—and a story.\n\nIt was the Christmas of 2001, and we had only recently, finally, acquired the PlayStation 2, the prime console of its era and generation. My brothers got a handful of games with their Best Buy gift cards, but I wanted at least two games. I played JRPGs exclusively at the time and was most definitely getting Final Fantasy X, as IX had been my favorite of the Final Fantasy series to date at that time. But I needed another game, another RPG. My brother, at the time, was subscribed to PlayStation Magazine and I scoured its pages looking for recommendations for a game that I could play, that I would enjoy. One female reviewer, one of the only ones they had on staff at the time, had posted a review for this game called Shadow Hearts, released at around the same time as FFX, and gave it a solid 9/10 review—it’s only detriment being poor cinematic graphics. Decision made, I picked it up for Christmas along with the latest installment of Final Fantasy. Because we, my brothers and I, knew that we would love the FF game (as we had all the others), we decided to wait on it and try out this new game that we knew little about. But as days turned into weeks and FFX remained untouched, our attention completely absorbed by SH, we started to feel a little guilty. So we forcibly pulled ourselves away from Shadow Hearts to play some FFX. It didn’t take long for us to realize that the only way FFX was superior was with the graphics. And probably the voice acting—sort of.\n\nSH had more dynamic gameplay. It was new, it was interesting, it was fun and intuitive. It was very, very different, and challenging. For a standard RPG, that’s impressive. FFX had great gameplay as well, but it wasn’t much different than stuff we’d seen in other FF games. It was old hat, a remix of what we were used to. FFX had incredible cinematics with amazing graphics, and a lot of them, almost too many. SH… did not. Not even a little. The cinematic scenes almost entirely avoided advanced graphics, mostly 2D art with voice overs (which ultimately worked with the theme and tone of the game), and the only ones with full-fledged 3D graphics were terribly rendered. The cutscenes of SH focused heavily on paintings, photography and film of the early 1900s, moving pictures, sounds. It created a mood, played into the horror theme, made it feel “real” with its stylized photography and film presentation. It was also a creative way to circumvent the lack of advanced 3D rendering. So while FFX was beautiful to look at, SH had an aesthetic. By SH2, the graphics quandary was nonexistent, the graphics were up to standards by the time the second game came out, but SH2 maintained the aesthetic and the theme.\n\nThe voice acting of FFX was well done if disconcerting in an era where that much voice acting in a game was uncommon and “cutting edge,” but the amount of cutscenes bogged down the play time of the game. Or at least it felt like it at the time. Today, it would probably be minimalist in comparison to other games within its own genre. The voice acting in SH… was wonderfully terrible. Some of it was amazing. Other parts were so horrifyingly bad that it was hilariously fabulous. One memorable moment was the telling of a local ghost story by an old lady, visually told through haunting images, photography and film, and sounds, but with such terribly grating voice acting that you couldn’t help but giggle at it and cringe. And despite it, you were fascinated by the tale being told and now recall the cutscene with both fondness and shocking clarity. Here it is, you curious souls, for your viewing pleasure: The Tale of Li Li\n\nReally. It’s terrible. Honestly, it’s so fabulously bad. But it’s glorious in its awfulness. I would give anything to hear it in Japanese.\n\nBut what all this ultimately amounts to is that Shadow Hearts was inferior to Final Fantasy X in graphics and rendering. The former found clever ways of skirting around that obvious flaw and then made up for it in aesthetic, presentation, theme, mood, character, gameplay and story. The second game found itself on par with others of its time in graphic quality, but suffered in areas such as character and presentation. SH2 improved upon SH’s gameplay, making the “Judgment Ring” system much more engaging and interesting and dynamic. The theme and mood remained mostly in tact, but SH had a darkness to its comedy. SH2 took the comedy players of the first game loved and built on it, but to the detriment of its aesthetic and mood and, to a degree, its message and subtext. There was a balance to the dark comedic and the serious themes in SH. It was a lightning in a bottle combination that took small miraculous elements that ended up just working perfectly in tandem. The attempt to recreate it in SH2… did not do as well. It feels forced, the comedy at times falling flat or getting uncomfortably close to stereotype and insult, the darkness lightened despite the deeply serious themes it tries to tackle. Despite itself, however, SH2 handles those serious themes with integrity, with respect, and it always presents the characters involved in those moments (for the most part) with an authenticity rarely seen in video games.\n\nShadow Hearts, by itself, is not a game, despite the boundaries it pushes, the themes and messages it explores, the richness of its characters and story, that can qualify to “literary” or “artistic” standards. Shadow Hearts 2: Covenant, equally, doesn’t measure up on its own. So why do I believe that both of them together, and not including their spiritual prequel Koudelka, make a video game that does reach frustratingly close to that standard?\n\nEvery piece of art does not just convey a message, present a human story, invoke emotions, and excel in its craft. What brings a piece of art to the level of exceptional is when it does something more. Something new, something so uniquely different that when its truth is revealed to you, the viewer, the reader, the audience, are left thinking about it afterward. It changes not only your relationship to the content, but how you look at the medium, at what the medium can do. What takes SH and SH2 to that precipice, what takes everything I’ve already talked about and pushes it just a bit further, the closest any video game (I believe) has come to the coveted title of “Art,” is what the games do in relation to each other.\n\nThey are not just direct sequels. They are more than just a part one and a part two. SH and SH2 are, in fact, one game.\n\nShadow Hearts begins with Yuri/Uru Hyuga compelled by a voice in his head to board a train and rescue a woman being held by the Japanese military. When Alice Elliot and Yuri Hyuga meet, their fates are irrevocably tied together. If you play the game through, without cheats, without a twitchy completionist attitude, just to play, Alice dies for Yuri. She dies for him, her soul consumed, and the hero of this story wakes at the end of the credits beside a beloved who fell asleep and didn’t awake. SH2 opens with Yuri having buried Alice near her mother’s home, wrapped in his coat, and living a wanderer’s life in Europe, helping people as he sees them, because that’s what she would want. As the story progresses, Yuri is given an injury that threatens to dissolve his memories, his personality, his soul, leaving him a husk. Part of the story is trying to find a cure, part of the story is helping people, and then a significant part of it is trying to bring Alice back from the dead and coming to terms with either the desire to just accept losing those memories and being free of the pain, or keep those memories, despite the pain of them. Most of SH2 is about dealing with loss. In some form. You, as the player, choose Yuri’s fate for him. You either decide to consign yourself to an existence as a vegetable, or you fight to keep those memories. At the end, the “good ending” and the “bad ending” are choices left up to the player, not events you can manipulate. (Conversely, the good/bad endings in SH depend on the player unlocking the correct sidequests. I.e. not a choice, but agency.) Yuri enters the graveyard of his soul. The ghost of the little girl from the beginning of SH2 (the one I mentioned kind of is a facsimile of the unseen but present ghosts from SH), Jeanne, asks you what makes you truly happy. You have these two choices: Say to her your true happiness is when you can be yourself or say to her your true happiness is when you can live peacefully.\n\nThe main character’s true happiness. True to yourself: keep your memories, despite their pain, continue to fight. Live peacefully: let the pain go, forget, and just exist.\n\nIf you choose the latter, Yuri Hyuga lives through his ordeal, but comes out of it without memories, without personality, an empty shell of who he was, a vegetable going through the motions of life without identity.\n\nIf you choose the former, Yuri Hyuga awakens in a field, the sound of a train off in the distance. He gets a splitting headache as a voice in his head tells him that he needs to be on that train. He has to rescue a woman.\n\nNow there are a few interpretations of that ending, considering Japanese games and their penchant for being inconclusive. But the main two takeaways are that either A) he’s dead and his version of “Heaven” is reliving the moment/journey where he met Alice or B) that since the final battle occurred against a god of Time and that what the god was trying to do was undo the world so he could go back in time, it is feasible that Yuri actually was transported back to that moment in time. Regardless of which interpretation you prefer, both do the same thing.\n\nThe player is being told that the continuation of this game is to play the first one again.\n\nSH has two endings, so does SH2. A “good” ending and a “bad” ending. In SH: good is Alice lives, bad is Alice dies. In SH2: good is Yuri gets to do it again (whether imagined or not), bad is Yuri becomes a vegetable. If you played SH and got the good ending, you have completed a good game. If you played SH and got the bad ending, SH2 is the continuation of that story. Then the player decides if she wants to do SH again and try to get that good ending, or if she wants to just end it “peacefully.” The story line of both games combined creates a time loop. Whether real for the character or not, it creates this situation for the player. After playing a game about loss and heartache, SH2 gives you the potential to choose the option to have a second chance. To fix the mistakes of the past. To play SH again and save Alice. The official timeline of this game is: SH bad ending, SH2 good ending, SH good ending.\n\nThis is why SH and SH2, individually, isn’t enough. It’s not the complete story. Together they create a game that is unique not just in its characters, story, aesthetic, themes, but also in its structure. If you never played Shadow Hearts and only played SH2, the designers tell you to go back and play the first one. If you played SH and got the bad ending and never played SH2, you don’t have the whole story. This concept, especially from a pair of games released in 2001 and 2004 respectively, is what takes these games so very close to that high brow “Art” concept. This alone, obviously, doesn’t do it. But this, combined with its innovation, its pushing of boundaries, its exploration, its design, complete the package. It does more than most video games do now, let alone what video games did in the early 2000s. And perhaps since then there have been other games that have done much of these things, in one shape or form. I do not, sadly, have the luxury or time or money to play every video game produced. But I find it unlikely that all of these elements were replicated in any other game. As of almost three years ago, Extra Credits hadn’t found any games that even incorporated the exploration of love/romance that SH and SH2 explore.\n\nNow, on a personal level, I believe SH and SH2, combined, do qualify as Art. That they are “literary.” But realistically, understanding the standards, I know that they don’t. Certainly not individually. Even together there are so many little flaws that take away that potential prestige. Not just in the graphics of SH, but at least one glaring story-based loophole in SH2 that wasn’t well constructed in the storyline. In retrospect, the context of that loophole adds a new layer of character development and motivations that enrich the story, but ultimately doesn’t really jive with the rest of the plot. But both games together do get so very, very close. Understand too, that I’m not talking about Art at a literary standard or on a film standard. I’m talking about ART as it should be for video games. Literature is not the same as film. Film is not the same as sculpture. Video games are their own medium and should be evaluated within that medium.\n\nShadow Hearts and Shadow Hearts 2: Covenant are engaging well-crafted games with their own set of unique flaws. They have a dynamic and innovative battle system, a powerful story, great characters that pushed the envelope on gender and sexuality and even a little bit on race for the time in which they came out. The setting impresses upon the player a sense of impeding doom and immediacy, the world is expertly crafted even when it is small. The games are compelling, have their own flavor, broach themes with candor but without any heavy-handedness. But together they become richer, more complete. They use their medium to tell their story, to make the games worth playing again. The combined stories make the characters fuller, make them matter more. The player experiences consequence and second chances.\n\nWe want more from our games. I believe Shadow Hearts and Shadow Hearts 2: Covenant gave us more, and we just forgot that they accomplished something that video games today are still trying to replicate. I believe the game developers of today need to go back and take a look at these games and learn from their successes and their failures. Shadow Hearts and Shadow Hearts 2: Covenant, even together, may not ultimately qualify as “Art.” However, studying these games, analyzing what was done well and expanding upon it, correcting their flaws, will allow the games of the future to learn and grow, and potentially, at last, be considered another form of artistic expression."
