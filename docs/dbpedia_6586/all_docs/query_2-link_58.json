        "text": "The game was one of my favorites as a kid. I ended up giving it away as a gift and then it went way up in price. I managed to snag a copy last year and got around to playing it this week right before my summer classes started.\n\nBefore I get to my pros and cons, I just have to say that the atmosphere is FANTASTIC. The game isn't \"scary,\" but there's genuinely unsettling moments/music tracks/environments that really managed to immerse me. There also isn't much in the way of gore, thankfully, though the opening cinematic in particular is something I find to be kinda disturbing (....and ugly, lol).\n\nThat said, I wanted to list out the pros and cons from my experience.\n\nPROS:\n\nA charming cast of characters, even if the only ones with real development are Alice and Yuri.\n\nAgain, incredible atmosphere\n\nA good soundtrack (save for one track in particular)\n\nThe Judgement Ring makes the somewhat basic battle system pretty fun\n\nLOTS of pretty cool optional content\n\nStory was really interesting and it used real-life locations and people in a cool and fun way.\n\nThe game doesn't overstay its welcome. It's a very nice 15-25 hour adventure.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe battle theme for Asia is fucking horrendous\n\nThe game is a little fugly tbh\n\nThe game takes a little while to get going. I personally thought the game was \"alright\" until I was nearing the end of the Asia section. But that might be because of the battle theme, which I absolutely hated\n\nThe voice acting is some of the worst I've heard\n\nThe game hasn't aged well in some regards. Get ready to hear these phrases: \"Orenous, orenous, ORENOUS!\" \"Yeah, I could use some help here.\" etc. etc. over and over and over and over again. A lot of battle animations are a little too long. It was definitely made during the era where JRPG devs thought people really wanted to watch the same long animation a billion times with no way of shortening it.\n\nSo, overall, I really enjoyed my time with it. I'd love to recommend it but you'd have to be someone that's okay with some aspects that haven't aged well.\n\nI can't wait to re-experience Covenant for the first time in like 7+ years sometime later this year.\n\nI'll be ending my post with this scene, which is probably my favorite \"End of Prologue\" scene in a game thus far.\n\nLove the series so much and miss it dearly. Said it before but I consider it an alternate universe timeline Final Fantasy that split off after FFIX with Koudelka.\n\nI mean I might go along with this too lol. Shadow Hearts 1 is unique and ambitious just like any FF, and Shadow Hearts 2 is not only unique and ambitious, but also really polished (minus the subtitles literally almost never matching the actual spoken lines) and high-budget. There's a scene in Shadow Hearts 2 near the end of Disc 1 that honestly still wows me to this day due to its length/scope/visuals/etc.\n\nAnd I guess Shadow Hearts 3 is kinda like what Bravely Default is to FF, except its budget wasn't that much smaller than 2's.\n\nThis is one of those relatively rare times most JRPG diehards go in hard on something and I just don't feel it. I had to force myself to finish the game. It wasn't even that long ago -- 2016, I think? -- and it was at a friend's behest that I play. He watched my progress eagerly. I felt bad when he began to realize I wasn't into it.\n\nI mean I don't exactly blame you because the game has aged, and you have to be willing to put up with some of its aged design. I myself considered dropping it during the first \"half\" (more like third) of the game, but I thought it became exponentially better once you leave Asia.\n\nAlso, the optional quests you can do are some of the best content of that nature in JRPGs, in that they all end with big deal character moments. I'm actually gobsmacked they left that stuff optional. Like, the letter from Qiuhua is super important for the sequel even:\n\nWhile Margarete's confession is just great, etc.\n\nI dunno if I agree with that either lol. The dungeons in that game are a nightmare because they abandoned pre-rendered backgrounds and went nuts building them out of 3D blocks.\n\nOh yeah I remember some dungeons being annoying but AGAIN overall I consider it to be way better (though I still love SH)\n\nAlso what the FUCK at that video clip\n\nI can't believe that's optional!!! I missed that\n\nI didn't bother with Margarete's sidequest cuz after being forced to keep Alice in my party for what felt like an eternity, Margarete was under leveled and I kept her in the sidelines for the rest of the game :-("
