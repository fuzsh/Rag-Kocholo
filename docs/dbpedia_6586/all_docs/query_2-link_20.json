But every time the seriesâ€™ December anniversary rolls around (this year is the 11th anniversary), I reminisce about everything it offered role-playing game fans: intriguing, outside-the-box characters, a fun twist on history and its figures, humorous dialogue, and a timing-based battle system that shook things up.",

        "text": "HarryMasonHerpderp4274d ago (Edited 4274d ago )\n\nI actually thought the first Shadow Hearts was the best because it was more dark and creepy than Covenant.\n\nCovenant was still an awesome game.\n\nDidn't like \"a new world\" though because it just dropped all of the creepyness for comedy really.\n\nAnyone play Koudelka? that was a bad ass horror RPG and apparently part of the Shadow Hearts series.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watc...\n\nAM_Thorn1092d ago\n\nJet Set Radio was actually on the original list of 10.\n\nhttps://www.heypoorplayer.c...\n\nA lot of the others were too recent to meet the date cut off I set, I was really looking for series that had been gone awhile.\n\nParasite Eve had The Third Birthday release 11 years ago.\n\nThe most recent Strider game was only 7 years ago.\n\nDevil Survivor 2 was only 9 years ago.\n\nOnimusha Soul released in 2012. I considered not counting mobile games but I was looking for series that publishers aren't even trying to get anything out of.\n\nSiren is close but the last installment was 13 years ago. Honestly was never into the series though so likely wouldn't have made it regardless. Definitely know it has its fans though.\n\nFear Effect Sedna stunk but was a new game and was only 3 years ago.\n\nMega Man X I kind of counted as part of the larger Mega Man series, though even if I didn't the new mobile game would probably have kept it off the list.\n\nLots of great choices there though. I'd love to see a new installment of most of them."
