        "text": "As someone who is pretty new to playing RPGs, perhaps the system whose catalog of RPGs interests me the most is the PS2, and over the summer I took the plunge and began to explore this massive library of JRPGs. Shadow Hearts was the first game I played and once it was all said and done not only was I incredibly impressed, but I also couldn't help but feel that this is a JRPG series that doesn't get the praise it deserves. The series has perhaps one of the strongest battle systems I've seen in a JRPG yet and has a story that will leave you in tears by the end.\n\nShadow Hearts, and it's sequel Shadow Hearts covenant, follow the story of Yuri Hyuga who crosses path with Alice and is lead to learn of her significance and powers. Perhaps one of the strongest points of the original Shadow Hearts is it's horror roots. The game's atmosphere is just fantastic, and the designs of the enemies are amazing as well. Unfortunately survival horror RPGs are a rare sight, but this is a game where the execution is just brilliant. Perhaps the closest thing I can compare it to would be Parasite Eve but even then the two aren't exactly identical.\n\nShadow Hearts is a turn based RPG, but with a twist and that twist is the judgement ring. The way Shadow Heart's combat basically works is anything you do in the game depends on you hitting areas of the judgement ring as a small white needle goes around the judgement ring. This makes combat fully dependent on your performance with the judgement ring. Hitting the red areas means you'll do more damage than usual while not hitting an area either means not being able to cast a spell or your character only being able to attack once or twice depending on your performance. Another very interesting aspect of the Shadow Hearts games is the fact that the main protagonist Yuri is a harmonixer who can fuse into monsters with specific elemental attributes. This adds another layer of depth to combat as enemies can be weak to specific elemental damage so using a fusion monster with that element will do you wonders in combat.\n\nWhile these elements all add to an enjoyable combat system where they all shine is in Shadow Hearts covenant. Covenant adds a very interesting additional layer to all that was introduced in the original Shadow Hearts and that's the addition of spacing and character movement playing a factor in combat. Characters and enemies alike now have to move around a combat field when attacking and magic spells can now do AoE damage which are incredibly powerful if used on enemies who are clumped together. While the combat in the original game is fun, the combat in covenant is outright amazing and is easily one of my favorite combat systems in an RPG thus far. Another great change was the addition of combos. Party members can now tackle an enemy together and cause damage back to back and it just is fantastic. There are many many other changes made in Covenant but these two were perhaps the biggest changes and the end result is a combat system that is just a blast.\n\nAnother fantastic aspect of these games is the soundtrack. The soundtrack for both SH1 and covenant are simply fantastic. From combat themes, to town themes the music for this series is just fantastic.\n\nThis series is just fantastic and I had an amazing time experiencing them for the first time, and I would encourage everyone here to do so as well. The combat system in the series is just simply fantastic and the story is just amazing.\n\nSorry for necro bumping this, but I'm currently making my way through the first one and really enjoying it.\n\nThe game has a great atmosphere and I like the characters so far, only annoyance I would say is having missable areas in it. I just finished the asian section of it and found out that there was a sidequest in a new area that I won't be able to do. I was actually trying to go do Kowloon just before the final fight with Dehui but the soldiers kept fucking blocking the exits of the tower, it was really frustrating.\n\nAt least there's nothing super important that I missed there aside from maybe that mind's eye item. Would have liked to see that little cutscene though.\n\nI went hunting for Koudelka too but the Shadow Hearts games are already super expensive, Koudelka is pretty much extortion wish it was on PSN so that I could play it and get some context for the story but oh well. Maybe one day.\n\nSorry for necro bumping this, but I'm currently making my way through the first one and really enjoying it.\n\nThe game has a great atmosphere and I like the characters so far, only annoyance I would say is having missable areas in it.

I sold Koudelka for $70 or so a couple years backs, the game isn't very good. It's difficult, grating, and unforgiving. It doesn't tie especially well to the SH series either. It's more an interesting/obtuse game that reminds me of Unlimited Saga. The latter being more playable, actually. Definitely a game that could use a remaster but I'm not sure that would help all that much."
