        "text": "Shadow Hearts shows developer Sacnoth learning from some of its mistakes, but not quite enough of them. Like Sacnoth's first game, the PlayStation adventure Koudelka, it is a very fine concept when viewed from long range -- there aren't many RPGs out there that blend Eastern and Western mysticism in a supernatural horror adventure set in western China at the turn of the 20th century. Also like Koudelka, it has some moments of visual excellence, thanks in large part to its unusual setting and character design. And unlike Koudelka, the load times are nothing to moan about.\n\nUnfortunately, Shadow Hearts is a slow-moving RPG, and not a very pretty one either, which is enough to toll its death knell in the face of the kind of competition that's hitting the market right now. Even second-line games like Jade Cocoon and Grandia II outshine it in with better looks and more engaging gameplay, to say nothing of Final Fantasy X. Its story and setting are certainly novel, but what that means is that I'd rather be reading this as a book or watching it as a film instead of having to slog through it as a game. Shadow Hearts' oddity may earn it some devoted fans, as tends to happen with most RPGs, but most gamers should take a pass, in favor of the many more attractive choices hitting the market right about now.\n\nGameplay\n\nTo create the cornerstone of its battle system, and indeed a few other aspects of the game, Shadow Hearts resurrects a concept I wish I would have only had to deal with once. That once was in Legend of Dragoon, whose Parappa-esque button-tapping twitch battle system drove me nearly mad with frustration. It's just fine if tapping a button on time happens to give you a little extra advantage (a la the Gunblade in Final Fantasy VIII), but making that the difference between landing a blow and missing cleanly is another matter entirely.\n\nTo give it credit, Shadow Hearts' Judgment Ring (the fundamental mechanism for hitting opponents, casting spells, and performing several other tasks) gives you a fair amount of leeway when you're trying to execute an action. The ring is divided up into active and empty sections, usually three of each, and an arm swings around at a constant rate. To hit, you have to tap the X button while the arm is in the active sections -- hit all three and you land three attacks, cast the spell, use the item, or what-have you. In addition, there's a bonus feature that grants you extra damage or otherwise more satisfactory results if you tap the button during a narrow red zone at the outer edge of each active section. That's a blessing and a curse, because while it's easy enough to score a regular attack if you're paying attention, getting greedy will lead to frequent misses.\n\nIn the end, though, the system's tedium outweighs its more positive qualities. Unless the designers are willing to create a full-blown action combat system, a la Namco's Tales games, the difference between success or failure in RPG battles should be strategy, creativity, and dedication, not your ability to tap buttons on time for hours on end. Even more unfortunately, not a great deal lies beyond the Judgment Ring as far as battle strategy. Each character has a few pedestrian spells and special attacks, but nothing too exciting, and main character Yuri Hyuga's Fusion transformation ability merely brings to mind the Dragoon Transformation from the Legend thereof. It's handy to trot out his were-forms in a boss battle now and again, but rarely are they necessary elsewhere, nor are they all that visually impressive.\n\nYuri's Fusion ability is also tied to one of the game's other nagging annoyances, the Graveyard. This is a small area to which you must periodically return, so as to fight a few mundane battles -- it's all wrapped up in plot elements dealing with Yuri's relationship to his father, ridding his soul of Malice (yes, proper noun), and so on. It would be fine if anything interesting happened in the Graveyard, but that's a rare occurrence. For the most part, you simply go there, fight a monster or two, occasionally receive a new Fusion form, and return to the real world, having had to drop out of the main flow of the story for no particularly good reason.\n\nRandomness has its place in RPGs -- heck, the entire genre has its roots in the pimply geek equivalent of craps -- but Shadow Hearts has rather too much of it for my taste, and too repetitive an implementation thereof. On the one hand, Legend of Dragoon had less forgiving button-tapping than Shadow Hearts, but on the other hand, it was kind enough to confine the Parappa flashbacks to combat. Unless there's some sort of sadistic ulterior motive here, and the continuous rotations of the Judgment Ring are planting nefarious post-hypnotic suggestions in my brain, it was a poor idea on the developers' part.\n\nGraphics\n\nSacnoth is sticking with the tried and true as far as visual design, eschewing the trend towards 3D RPG worlds in favor of the PlayStation standard of pre-rendered backgrounds and realtime characters. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with that scheme -- Final Fantasy X sticks with pre-rendered worlds for a good deal of the time -- but the refinement of these backgrounds doesn't reflect the advancements in artistry that we've come to expect in this generation. Quite honestly, the PlayStation could handle Shadow Hearts' field map sequences without breaking a digital sweat. The level of detail is low, enough that you can pick out the pixel edges in gradations of color, and objects that should stand out instead fade into a blurry morass. The 3D characters have sharp, high-res edges, but the textures that cover them are distinctly behind the curve.\n\nWhen battle begins, Shadow Hearts looks a little sharper, but it still can't hold a candle to the modeling and animation in a Grandia or a Final Fantasy. Even towering boss monsters don't look very good at all -- their movements are stiff, their models angular, and their textures dull. There's not a great deal to speak of in the special effects department, either. The highest end of attacks manage to impress, especially with all the weird religious imagery that tends to get mixed in (Japan still can't kick its habit of Cabala abuse, it looks like), but they're still drawn with very sharp, broad strokes, instead of the many shadings of detail that are becoming the standard.\n\nIn concept, Shadow Hearts has an interesting artistic style, blending Chinese symbology with influences from all over the West and viewing the lot through a quaint sort of late-Victorian filter. Unfortunately, the technical end of things isn't up to the challenge of bringing the concepts to life, and the potential richness of detail is lost.\n\nSound\n\nGood sound has very little to do with relative technical limitations, though, and in this aspect Shadow Hearts does do quite well, even if it feels like Yasunori Mitsuda is taking a bit of a breather here between more serious projects. At times, the soundtrack fades into the background with very light, ambient sounds, but most often the music carries scenes, with instrumentation that's frequently very appropriate to the period and setting. Some of the Celtic influence from Koudelka hangs on, especially when vocals are involved, but that sticks out mainly because the soundtrack usually suits scenes so well. There's a wide variety of very deep bass sounds, as always a good bet for creating and preserving tension, and plenty of different instruments to add higher accents over that.\n\nAs for the voice acting, well, it's...very odd. Most, if not all, of the Japanese dialogue has been replaced with English, and while this works in many situations, it's horribly painful in others. I suppose the Sea Mother's discourse would have hurt in any language, but that just means a poor decision was made in allowing spoken dialogue to accompany it at all (and no, I won't explain this -- the memory is too painful). Meanwhile, I'm quite unable to explain some of the little quips that accompany special attacks. Some are in English, some are in Japanese, and at least one is made up of both. They sound fine in either language, but consistency probably should have been a goal in this category."
