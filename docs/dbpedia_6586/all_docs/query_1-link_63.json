        "text": "Post by personman on\n\nIts one of the.... two jrpgs series I can stand.\n\nThe first, like others have said, has a lot of charm (if just for the fact it looks like a really nice ps1 game) but is horrendously clunky. Its the only one that takes its self really seriously as well but its not too annoying about it. It tends to look at history and simply observe it at a distance than try to weave it's events into it's rather off the wall plot. Admittedly though my memory of history wanes to take that last point with a grain of salt. Back when I bought it the asking price was same as a new 360 game and as much as I enjoyed playing through it I wouldn't say it was worth the money. I say check it out if you can find it cheap.\n\nThe second is a nice improvement over the first but I feel it gets a little too much praise. The main campaign tends to drag on a little too long and it annoyed the hell out of me that next to none of the characters were developed save for the two leads and gameplay wise they were all nearly identical and only meant for the roles you decided to build them for. (as far as I remember character specific abilities were worthless) Plot gets really dumb along the way too and even though it doesn't take itself too seriously it still goes to the point of eye rolling. But these are minor and personal grievances and its a plenty solid game. I'd just recommend restraint once you figure out how to do chains because once you do there is nothing stopping you from obliterating everything. Alot of the bosses and enemies really didn't require much strategy to begin with either.\n\nThe third I feel every fan of jrpgs should check. The combat got refined to a good deal and the games pretty challenging. You'll hear a lot of fans belittle the game for rather petty reasons, mostly the departure in atmosphere and the cast. Really they're just fine and the plot thankfully doesn't take itself as seriously as the last two and in the end just becomes more enjoyable. I will admit I have a little bias towards the game as far as the creative directions goes. Mostly for the fact you visit Arizona, I just get giddy when I go to my home state in a video game. Plus I love historic America.\n\nOne major weakness of the series is its dungeon design, like wrywad stated. It becomes pretty clear that they were far more concerned with making really atmospheric hallways rather than intriguing puzzles or layouts... and at times not even that much. I feel the combat usually made up for it though.\n\nI'd say there's better (Wild Arms is still far and above my favorite) but if you can find them for a decent price go for it.\n\nPost by wyrdwad on\n\nAnd really the battle system isn't more tedious than any other PS2-era RPG.\n\nI think the thing that makes it unappealing to me is its meta-ness. Most RPG battle systems have gimmicks, but they're explained -- FF7's materia is a central part of its storyline, for example, and SMT's press turn system makes logical sense (hit an enemy with its weakness, and it takes longer for that enemy to recover; feed an enemy's strength, and the attack backfires, or the enemy gets energized).\n\nIn Shadow Hearts, however, there is absolutely NO reasonable explanation for the \"judgment ring.\" Swing your sword and... try to hit a button when a clock hand is lined up with a shaded section on a circle?... or you miss?! I know they gave the judgment ring its own MASCOT in order to make this combat system fit in with the game's story a LITTLE better... but that still fails to explain WHY every single action you do in the whole bloody game is accompanied by a spinning disc mini-game!\n\nIt just... bothers me. On a deep level that makes the entire game very un-fun to play. And if the dungeons were cool to explore, I MIGHT be willing to overlook it... but they're not. The dungeons are repetitive and boring.\n\nBut again... I seem to be in the minority here. You may very well like it a lot better -- it seems most people do. I just... can't stand battle systems with absolutely no basis in logic or reason.\n\n-Tom"
