        "text": "A new trademark has been filed by Universal Entertainment in Japan for the PlayStation 2 RPG series Shadow Hearts, potentially suggesting at least one of the three titles could be part of PS Plus Premium's launch lineup. Spotted by Gematsu, it's a possible indicator of the types of games we can expect to play come the end of June on the service. The trademark joins the Syphon Filter series in recent renewals, potentially hinting at what's to come for subscribers.\n\nThe Shadow Hearts series is a trilogy of titles: the original game was released for PS2 in 2003 and received two sequels in Covenant and From the New World in the following years. Developed by the Japanese team Sacnoth (later renamed Nautilus), Shadow Hearts is set \"from the late 1890s to the 1920s, following different casts of characters caught in supernatural mysteries. The setting combines alternate history and cosmic horror, with real-world figures making appearances, and each title has multiple endings.\" All three entries were fairly well-received by critics upon their launch.\n\nShadow Hearts now joins the Syphon Filter games, Mr. Driller, Ridge Racer 2, Tekken 2, Worms Armageddon, and Worms World Party as potential inclusions in PS Plus Premium. And with the revamped service launching in just a few weeks across Asian territories, Sony must surely be planning to lift the lid on the full lineup sooner rather than later. For more information, check out our All PS Plus Games guide.\n\nWould you be interested in replaying the Shadow Hearts series via PS Plus Premium or experiencing them for the first time? Let us know in the comments below."
