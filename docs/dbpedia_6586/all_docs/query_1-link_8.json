        "text": "I'm in the mood for a good RPG and I've read/heard lots of good things about the second Shadow Hearts game. While I prefer to play series in order, I notice that the first SH is pretty expensive in most places...so can I jump right into Covenant with no worries? Any advice is greatly appreciated!\n\nPS I put in a bid on ebay for Covenant + guide that in an auction that's still 2 days away from closing. If anyone here is looking to sell, please PM me (I promise I'll search the CAG trade forums later, for those who think I'm not aware of that function).\n\nThey do a lot of catching you up, and honestly, I forgot most of SH1 by the time I got to Covenant, but I think the experience of having them retell you 20 hours of the first game in a few fragmented cut scenes and cute little drawings has to be decidedly different, any way you cut it.\n\nI recommend playing the first one first.\n\nYou can go further back even, there is an rpg for ps1 called koudelka. Its a good rpg, i played through it in what, 10-12 hours maybe? It just makes things tie in well since you have more background information.\n\nAs for Shadow Hearts 1, i dont think you should play it just to enjoy covenant, but play it because its so enjoyable on its own too.\n\nDo you need to play Shadow Hearts to enjoy Covenant? No. Do you need to play Shadow Hearts to FULLY enjoy Covenant. Definitely. Alot of Covenant is Yuri's relationship with Alice, which is told in the first game. You lose a lot of that by not playing Shadow Hearts.\n\nI suffered through both Koudelka and Shadow Hearts just so I could dive into Covenant. I'm stubborn like that.\n\nI beat Koudelka in one sitting, which I don't recommend. It had its moments, but more often than not it felt carelessly thrown together. I felt the same way about the first Shadow Hearts.\n\nAfter playing Covenant, I don't think it's totally necessary to play either of its predecessors. If it's more a question of the games being good as opposed to understanding the entire Shadow Hearts universe, I'd say pass.\n\nThe story won't be a problem but the difficulty might bother you... Covenant was much easier than its predecessor.\n\nBut no, you don't have to... honestly, Covenant didn't do much to expand up the story in SH even though it was a direct sequel.\n\n[quote name='Vinny']The story won't be a problem but the difficulty might bother you... Covenant was much easier than its predecessor.[/quote]\n\nI thought both games were a bit on the easy side, insofar as I never felt the need to level grind.\n\nyou will appreciate covenant so much more if the play SH first.\n\nhowever it is very good on its own. SH doesnt take very long to beat, like 25 hours or so, i would recomend playing it first\n\nI would definitely suggest playing #1 Chac. It's a great game IMO. And Covenant ties in nicely explaining something you NEVER expect for the most part. I'd give you the clinical term for what happens at the end of 2 but then in the process I'd ruin the surprise.\n\n[quote name='Rei no Otaku']Do you need to play Shadow Hearts to enjoy Covenant?

Plus, I personally feel the original was a slightly better game since it had a more focused story than SH:C did.\n\nI really don't understand how anyone could love one & hate the other, since they're such similar games, but to each his own...\n\n[quote name='Sarang01']I would definitely suggest playing #1 Chac.

One of the endings for Covenant will make A LOT more sense if you've played Shadow Hearts. In fact without knowledge of SH, I don't see how you could understand it.\n\nSH1 is brilliant from start to finish. The final boss battle is the stuff of legend, IMO. It was a 40 minute boss battle for me. Fabulous.\n\nI've started Covenant and am about 8 hrs in, but it isn't grabbing me like the first one did. I can't put my finger on it...I've taken a break from it to fire up DQVIII...\n\nDon't hate, but I've had a very lucky week. First I found Ikaruga at my local WalMart for under $15, then I was in my local EB (about 200 yards from the WalMart) today and they had a perfect used copy of Shadow Hearts, plus Rez and Nocturne. I ordinarily hate buying more than 1 game at a time (esp. RPGs), but I found a use for my buy 2-get 1 Game Informer coupon!\n\nNocturne: $44.99 (-10%)\n\nRez: 39.99 (-10%)\n\nShadow Hearts: Free\n\nTotal: $76.48 in EB store credit!\n\n[quote name='Chacrana']I'm considering getting into the Shadow Hearts series myself... how does the series compare to other PS2 RPGs in terms of overall quality?[/quote]\n\nthe storyline of the series is excellent, and very different from anything else out their. gameplay is a good change of pace with the judgement ring system\n\nthe first SH isnt that wonderful gameplay wise, but the story is great\n\nCovenant is excellent in both ways"
