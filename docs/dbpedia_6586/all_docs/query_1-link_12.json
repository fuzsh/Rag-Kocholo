        "text": "I own all six of these games and am trying to decide which of the two series to play next. I plan on eventually playing both, but for the time being I am torn between the two.\n\nYes, I know XS2 is supposed to be terrible.. and I know SH2 is supposed to be amazing! I'm really looking for everyone opinions of the two series as a whole.\n\nFor what it's worth, I have played about two thirds of XS1 when it came out and mostly dug it, but never got around to finishing it. I've played maybe 5 minutes of Shadow Hearts 1 when it first came out, but only at my friends.\n\nXenogears is one of my fave games. Also Yasunori Mitsuda, who does some music for both of those series, is one of my fave composers.\n\nYuri Hyuga (SH) is one of the best protagonists, ever. Go with SH. Even the third one, which isn't nearly as good as the first two, has some pretty good gameplay tweaks and is still really fun.\n\nI do like the XS series and played through all three in a row about a year ago, but SH2 is my third favorite game of all time after Persona 4 and Xenoblade. Actually you should just play Xenoblade instead of Xenosaga.\n\nI really adore the Xenosaga trilogy. I will easily admit that XS1 and XS2 can be a bit flawed (as Xenogears is as well), but the entire journey through is oh so worth it. I feel like it really does justice to the Xeno name by the time you get to XS3. I don't think XS2 is even close to as bad as people say, but I probably would think differently if I payed 50~ dollars for it. It makes some bad design decisions, but the story bits are all still fantastic and improved over XS1.\n\nI love Xenoblade too, but I do think it plays it way too safe story-wise in comparison to the rest.\n\nAs far as Shadow Hearts go, I've only played the first one unfortunately. I very much enjoyed it though, I really aught to hunt down the rest as well.\n\nDon't have any experience with the Shadow Heart series but man, was I disappointed with Xenosaga. First game was totally in love with, enjoyed the characters, cutscenes felt epic was so ready for the next one. When 2 came around I think it was the same time MGS 3 came out so I spent my time on that, when I eventually started playing 2 they totally switched up the character designs and the story felt super rushed. Since I already invested so much time with the series I bought the third one when that was released, and to this day its still sitting on my shelf wrapped up. That series had so much potential reading up on the behind the scenes going on with its production and the end of that console generation made me forget about that series until now.\n\n@I_Stay_Puft said:\n\nDon't have any experience with the Shadow Heart series but man, was I disappointed with Xenosaga.

Episode 3 is by far the most enjoyable of the bunch.\n\nI've never had the chance to play any Shadow Hearts games, unless you count the unofficial SH precursor Koudelka as part of the series.\n\nXenosaga shall always remain the biggest heartbreak for me in gaming. As a huge fan of Xenogears, I wanted this to be great, but it just wasn't. The lack of continuity and the interactive movie style of Ep.1 practically rendered the would be six-part series stillborn. When the writers for the original Xenogears left in the middle of the production of Ep.II, you knew things were really turning to shit.\n\nEp.III did manage to redeem the series somewhat, but Shion's melodrama alone brought the game down, IMO. Oh, and cutting the blood out of the game to avoid risking an \"M\" rating was so chickenshit. Scenes that were meant to be emotionally charged wound up drawing snickering from me, especially the infamous hospital scene."
