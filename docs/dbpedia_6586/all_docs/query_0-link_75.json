        "text": "I haven't played Koudelka.\n\nShadow Hearts 1 is very interesting with a great atmosphere for the most part. The battle system is slow and outdated though, and characters are ridiculously unbalanced, with a lot of useless ones. It's worth a playthrough.\n\nShadow Hearts 2 is a direct sequel, taking place only a few months after the original. You really should play SH1 first, for the story. In fact, just reading about SH2 on a forum is liable to spoil SH1. The battle system is much better, though it is not very difficult. It loses quite a bit of the atmosphere and is a lot more humorous. Still, it is generally regarded as the best in the series.\n\nShadow Hearts 3 loses almost all connection to the previous games. It still has 2's battle system, but the characters are dull and...well, I didn't beat it, so I can't comment too much further. It seemed to get sillier, which was quite an achievement after SH2.\n\nI'm playing it now and it's a pretty cool game.\n\nThen again, any game should look good after an utter trainwreck like Valkyrie Profile 2.\n\nThat was one of my biggest disappointments. The trailers looked awesome, the battle system looked awesome, but holy shit, what the hell happened? The soul of VP got gutted (Can you believe they removed the Einherjar death scenes?) and the difficulty jumped every second to extreme levels.\n\nWarning: I'm a gigantic storyfag when it comes to JRPGs. If you don't care much about the story, characters, and writing of them, then yeah, SH2 and SH3 are pretty good games. The third one in particular is probably the best of the series mechanically.\n\nShadow Hearts 1 is one of my favourite JRPGs, it has really good atmosphere and a great setting, as well as a unique battle system, a pretty good plot and good writing all around. Its prequel, Koudelka, for the PS1, is also a great game, though it has somewhat terrible English voice acting and a decent battle-system that becomes rather repetitive due to the high encounter rate.\n\nAnd I'm sure this will be a unpopular opinion, but I hated Shadow Hearts 2. While it definitely looks, sounds, and plays better than the first, its plot and overall writing is straight up fanfiction trash. Needlessly retconning the original's plot, trying desperately to make its new characters seem more important than they need to be, has a pretty boring cast that all pretty much disappear into the background after they join, it completely ruins SH1's pretty good balance of horror and comedy by going completely overboard with the comedy, and is overall just a complete fucking mess.\n\nShadow Heart 3: From the New World somewhat continues SH2's tradition of looking and playing better than its predecessor but also has a pretty crappy story. Unlike the second, this one had the sense to use a new cast of characters like Shadow Hearts 1 did after Koudelka, so it only has loose ties to its predecessors and thus no need for incredibly stupid retcons. Its plot starts out interesting and has potential but is poorly paced and structured, and its cast suffers the same problem as SH2's did in that after a party member joins the group they mostly become mute and wander around in the background. It also pretty much gives up on the whole horror atmosphere of the first three games.\n\nNeedlessly retconning the original's plot\n\nHow so? It's been awhile since I played it, but I don't recall any retcons.\n\nUnless, of course, you got the Good Ending in Shadows Hearts 1.\n\nHaven't played it since it was originally released but the two I remember off the top of my head:\n\nSimon being a misunderstood bro who was just trying to defeat an even greater evil (Rasputin), even though Roger Bacon explains in pretty great detail why Simon was doing what he was doing in SH1. And the most retarded one of all is making Karen Yuri's mum, even though her nationality and element were completely different from what SH1's bio of Yuri's mum says about her.\n\nEDIT: Also:\n\nAlice dying made no sense since whether or not she died was based on how Yuri dealt with his whole graveyard thingy towards the end and if she lived you got Yuri's greatest form, which SH2 later shows he did get.\n\nI've seen people bring that up before but if I remember correctly:\n\nThey only really use those papers to pass a check point and afterward, Karen gives them back to Anne. Plus, there's really no reason for her to continue lying about it after being thrown back in time and meeting Yuri's father, and regardless she was still German, so there's no reason why she'd name her son a mostly Russian name, though I guess you could blame that one on the whole time paradox crap. EDIT: Actually, scratch that bit about his name. Just remembered that his name in the Japanese version is some really weird name, that I think is actually Japanese.\n\nI also really didn't like\n\nthe use of Kato, particularly making him a bad ass mage that rivaled the likes of Simon and Roger, two guys who had perfected their craft after being alive for centuries. His inclusion (I mean, I know he's a large part of the plot, but I thought Nicolai and Rasputin were interesting and good enough antagonists to carry the plot) as well as the whole Simon and Karen stuff all felt like the writer going \"See!? Do I know my Shadow Hearts lore or what? I'm such a big fan!\", making the game's plot ultimately feel like something you'd read on FanFiction.net.\n\nThere was a director's cut released after the US version, which had added story scenes and other stuff. I wonder if the new content would've changed my opinion of the game at all.\n\nAnd I'm sure this will be a unpopular opinion, but I hated Shadow Hearts 2.\n\nI actually share this opinion. Shadow Hearts 2 definitely looks miles better (the first one looks like it belongs on the original Playstation) and clearly had a bigger budget, more polish, nicer assets, and just about everything else you'd want in a sequel. But it lost what made Shadow Hearts special, which was the atmosphere. The horror aspects from the first game all but vanish in the second. The plot turns into a (comparatively) light-hearted anime adventure, complete with wacky comedy sidequests. It goes from unique to just another JRPG (though with a great setting), and it losses its charm.\n\nI love the SH main character, he's a mix of Devil May Cry and Hokuto no Ken.\n\nBut wtf is this?\n\nKeep that FF shit out of my SH.\n\nJohnny isn't too bad, he's not really whinny or angsty like most teenage JRPG protagonists, he's a paranormal detective, and his backstory is actually somewhat interesting and cool. Plus, the other main character, who gets as much and sometimes even more screen time, is this chick:\n\nStraight shota action ftw\n\nThe problem is nearly every other character. A gigantic humanoid-ish fat talking cat who wants to be a movie star, a 50 year old American ninja, a magical girl vampire, and a Mexican dude with a guitar that doubles as a rocket launcher and machine gun. Which probably wouldn't've been a bad cast had they actually had any, you know, development or story arcs.\n\nAnd I'm sure this will be a unpopular opinion, but I hated Shadow Hearts 2.\n\nI actually share this opinion.

It goes from unique to just another JRPG (though with a great setting), and it losses its charm.\n\nI actually remember reading that it originally was a PSX game but midway through development the PS2 came out, so they decided to just port it over and finish it on that. And, yeah, they completely wrecked the atmosphere. SH1 certiainly had its humour but it never really went to 'vampire in a butterfly mask thinking he's a super-hero and battling half-naked men for new special moves' levels of wacky that SH2 did.\n\nStill, it sucked that Sacnoth was disbanded. SH2 and SH3 are still pretty good JRPGs, just kinda shitty sequels to a game I really loved. Though, I do believe a lot of the people who worked on Sacnoth went to work for feelplus, one of the studios that co-developed Lost Odyssey, though I don't think they've done much outside of that game.\n\nA PRO Walkthrough of the saga would be:\n\n1) Koudelka -\n\nwithout her there would be no way to stop Albert Simon and raise the Float and Alice would be far less powerful\n\n2) Shadow Hearts 1\n\nFail the 4 quest mask let Alice die do not obtain Dark Seraphim , you'll know why when the time comes\n\n3) Shadow Hearts 2\n\nget Dark Seraphim finish all sidequests, obtain everything and grab the Good ending.\n\nMOAR SPOILERISH\n\nAt the end of the game you go back in time right before you met Alice the first time.\n\nExpecially spoilering\n\n4)\n\nReplay Shadow Hearts 1 and this time tear a new one to the 4 masks, get Dark Seraphim (now he \"knows\" how to obtain it cause he went back in time) and save Alice. During the game pay extra attention to Anne Hyuga cause you know she is really Karin, like Covenant Karin. aAfter they kick Susano-O ass in Covenant somehow ends back in time and has Yuri.\n\nNothing like Biocock Infinite amirite?\n\nEdit: what you don't believe me?\n\nhere's proof:\n\nGeee I wonder who is this girl...and the spunky kid? and where is this? Japan?"
