        "meta_description": "One of the best perks of my job is going into a videogame assignment with one expectation of what it is I'm about to play, only to walk away with an entirely different (and overly positive) one. In the case of Nautilus and Midway's latest RPG sequel, Shadow Hearts: Covenant, that's exactly what happened -- as I've been completely and totally blindsided by how good it is. Going in, I knew that it would at least be pretty decent, as I was a fan of the original game's unique battle system and thought that the character designs and music were pretty good (I never did agree with the review that we posted for it, but alas, that was before my time). What I walked away with after playing the sequel extensively, however, was something so far beyond \"decent\" it isn't even funny. I had just experienced one of the best role-playing games of the year.\r\n\r\nNow unlike the mainline Final Fantasy sequels, Shadow Hearts is a direct continuation of the storyline established in the first game. Taking place two years after the events of the original and not too long after the start of World War I, our chronicle begins in a dramatic fashion with the return of familiar face. Set within the eerie deserted village of Domremy in Northern France, a cautious unit of Elite German soldiers are quickly and brutally wiped out by giant winged demon in the town church. Of course, the number one reason that the Imperial Army hasn't taken this village yet is because of this demon -- which is, as you might have guessed, the paranormal badass Yuri from the previous game. There is one survivor, though, a young female lieutenant known as Karin Koenig, and she's left unharmed by the protective Yuri because of her resemblance to someone he once knew (one guess as to who that is!). After debriefing her superiors in Germany of the situation, the game begins and it sends Karin and her new ally (an exorcist named Nicholai) on a quest to take the town.",
