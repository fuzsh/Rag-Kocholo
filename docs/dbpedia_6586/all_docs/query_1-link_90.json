        "text": "Like I know From The New World has an uninteresting story and really desperate sexualization but like\n\nHow did it not sell well\n\nthis trailer is so fucking good\n\nFor me, it just got too wacky/tropey. I liked the first one well enough, but I couldn't get far into the second because of the aforementioned changes.\n\nWhat makes the original stand out was how unique it was (and is) for the genre. The sequels felt like they were moving toward \"just another JRPG\", which is not what drew me in originally.\n\nLike I know From The New World has an uninteresting story and really desperate sexualization but like\n\nHow did it not sell well\n\nthis trailer is so fucking good\n\nI think that the way Xseed marketed it had something to do with that. I remember them focusing more on the quirky humor, which was a mainstay of the series, and even more prominent in FtNW, but not necessarily what drew people to play the games.\n\nAs someone who enjoyed the darker elements of the other Shadow Hearts games and Koudelka I found it a big turn off anyway. Then again, I didn't think FtNW was that good of a game.\n\nI'd sacrifice my first born for a proper Shadow Hearts 3.\n\nI remember buying the first game on sale for like $20 at Wal-Mart so I had something to play on my PS2 after Final Fantasy X. The odd mixture of horror and humor really struck a chord with me and I bought Covenant as soon as it released. While FtNW isn't as good as either of them, the improvements to the combat system are not to be overlooked.\n\nAlso, iirc Covenant and From the New World both sold well enough to be positively called out by their Japanese and English distributors. The series dying was more due to company reorganisation (Aruze (now Universal Entertainment Corporation) became entirely a pachinko, pachislot and slot machine outfit - the folks from Nautilus went to Feelplus).\n\nWow I hate life\n\nI loved this game. I loved a M-rated jrpg.\n\nIs it the only one?\n\nNope, Final Fantasy Type-0 is also rated M\n\nand the Drakengard games if those count in your eyes\n\nYou know like how most JRPG first town/village is the peaceful, beginner friendly area. Shadow Heart's first one is a town occupied with cannibal cultists. That's when I realize this game is gold. Covenant then went on to be my favorite JRPG on PS2, and even the third game is fun on its own right. FTNW did lose a lot of horror element and character is not as good but the gameplay is fantastic.\n\nStill looking forward to playing it someday, it looks like a wild ride.\n\nSad that it seems like these games will never get ports, let alone remasters. :(\n\nYeah I made the mistake of looking up the series' Wikipedia entry and this series is 10000000000% screwed. I mean, I'm not surprised at all but it would've been nice to have a sliver of hope. Nautilus became like 17 different (defunct) companies lol\n\nHave never played any of them, but I've always had Shadow Hearts Covenant in my sights. I'll move it up the ladder of my backlog.\n\nHonestly I can't imagine anyone disliking Shadow Hearts Covenant\n\nthe original SH, ok, it's pretty dated nowadays (though I started loving it around 40% in). From The New World, the lighthearted vibe might not be your thing.\n\nBut Covenant?\n\nI mean I haven't played it in years but the only flaws I can remember is that there was one useless party member, the game overused a town and dungeon theme a lot, and some of the dungeons were badly designed mazes.\n\nSo I'd say dive in!!\n\nI think I stopped playing Shadow Hearts in London when you meet the orphan kid. I really enjoyed the game but I felt like it got less interesting when you left asia and went to europe instead. Despite being made by people from Asia, JRPGs very rarely take place in Asia or Asian inspired worlds and it kind of sucks because it's a place I'd love to explore more in video games.\n\nI think I stopped playing Shadow Hearts in London when you meet the orphan kid.

Despite being made by people from Asia, JRPGs very rarely take place in Asia or Asian inspired worlds and it kind of sucks because it's a place I'd love to explore more in video games.\n\nInteresting since I COMPLETELY disagree. I couldn't wait to get out of Asia tbh\n\nHave never played any of them, but I've always had Shadow Hearts Covenant in my sights. I'll move it up the ladder of my backlog.\n\nYou'd probably find a lot to like about Koudelka, judging by your appreciation for some other PS1 JRPGs. Can be a pain to track down though - I snagged my copy years before the Covid price hikes.\n\nI started playing this and was enjoying it, then my ex girlfriend took over while I was playing and continued playing further than where I was at (she'd play for hours while I was at work). I lost interest because she'd then want me to watch her play and I had no idea what was going on with the story since I'd miss big chunks while I was working. Might pick it back up someday and just start over completely. Might not be able to though due to associating the game with memories of my ex.\n\nOk it's genuinely sad how Shadow Hearts Covenant is better than From The New World in almost every single way\n\nCovenant has its flaws, for sure (some of the dungeons are HORRIBLE, subtitles are annoyingly inaccurate, some instances of lazy/bad/typical writing, some useless characters like Lucia, some bad voice acting), but it's so much better than FTNW.\n\nFTNW's first half was pretty enjoyable but the story was practically non-existent. I've never seen a less compelling pair of antagonists in any game. The only thing that kept me going in the 2nd half was the gameplay. I'm really not sure what they were thinking with making the story and characters so uninteresting for this game.\n\nLike I know From The New World has an uninteresting story and really desperate sexualization but like\n\nHow did it not sell well\n\nthis trailer is so fucking good\n\nWords cannot describe how insulting Shadow Hearts 3 is.\n\nThe locations aren't as fun or interesting.\n\nThe antagonist is stupid.\n\nThe sexualization is turned up to infinity, complete with racist exoticization of indigenous people.\n\nThe homophobia is turned up to 11.\n\nThe only redeeming factors are the weeb ninja fighting with a cactus, taking down al capone with a talking cat-man, and curvy hilda, who can 1 shot the last boss with an infinity key and mind's eye if you've practiced her wheel.\n\nNew World isn't bad but the downgrade from Yuri to whoever the fuck that kid was was massive.\n\nShadow Hearts 1: Quirky little game with an interesting but rough and simplistic battle system, hit or miss horror elements and boring leveling systems. But the plot is pretty damn interesting.\n\nShadow Hearts 2: One of the best JRPGs ever made, and a total package of excellent combat, fantastic story and characters, great music, enjoyable character progression, etc etc.\n\nShadow Hearts 3: Bad story and joke characters, an even better battle system, and occasionally good music.\n\nI replayed SH Covenant last year during the first month of lockdown and it holds up. Just really incredible game.\n\nWords cannot describe how insulting Shadow Hearts 3 is.\n\nThe locations aren't as fun or interesting.\n\nThe antagonist is stupid.\n\nThe sexualization is turned up to infinity, complete with racist exoticization of indigenous people.\n\nThe homophobia is turned up to 11.\n\nThe only redeeming factors are the weeb ninja fighting with a cactus, taking down al capone with a talking cat-man, and curvy hilda, who can 1 shot the last boss with an infinity key and mind's eye if you've practiced her wheel.\n\nYeah, having just replayed the entire trilogy, FTNW is quite disappointing. I think the first half has some interesting vignettes and locations, but it doesn't rectify the fact that the story and characters are so uninteresting. Shania's personality is literally just \"I've got to kill that woman.\" Lady is a mute force of nature, and Killer has no backstory. I'm just not sure why they decided to not care about having an interesting story at all?\n\nAlso, it's a tad weird that Shadow Hearts Covenant's CG cutscenes have much better lighting and more polished models. There's many instances where I was able to notice hair clipping through Shania's (horrible-looking) ears, for example lol\n\nI loved all forms of Hilda, though. Fav character by a mile."
