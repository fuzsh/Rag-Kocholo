        "text": "Hey guys. So I'm currently running HEN on my HFW PS3\n\nand I can play PS2 and PS3 backups perfectly however..\n\nI'm having an issue with Shadow Hearts Covenant.\n\nThe game comes packaged with 2 Discs, the second disc is the second half of the game. I've tried making a PKG of disc 1 and a PKG of disc 2 but upon starting the pkg of disc 2 it asks me to \"place disc 1 in the disk tray\"\n\nI've tried what someone mentioned which was to \"place the save data/memory card of disc 1 into the disc 2 folder\" and that didn't work.\n\nIs there any way at all to get this working on a HFW PS3?\n\nPS3 FW: 4.84 (CECH-3002B)\n\nRunning HAN + HENâ€‹\n\nYes but you need to convert to .psv format so it depends on what extension the save you downloaded is. I have done it before but it can be done the ways just depend if it's .cbr or .PSU they way to convert is different. There are tons of guides to do this. A really easy way is to load up the save with PCSX2 then convert whatever type of save you have to .psv\n\nI found a PSV save file right here (the first one) will that be alright? Also where do I place the PSV file and does it go in both disc 1 and disc 2?\n\nSo I tried all that you mentioned and for some reason \"ShadowHearts II\" shows up in my USB under Memory Card Utility so I copied it to an Internal PS2 memory card and made it my Slot 1..\n\nHowever I then checked my \"Saved Data Utility (PS2)\" and my usb doesn't show any files within it and my USB saved data is nowhere within it although my console made its own Saved Data out of the pkg files I made which are in \"Saved Data Utility (PS2)\" but upon booting Shadow Hearts 2 and going to load it says there is no saved data present in either slot 1 or 2?\n\nIm thinking I messed up somehow cause the game (pkg) itself is called Shadow Hearts 2 - Covenant [Disc1of2] and Shadow Hearts 2 - Covenant [Disc2of2] respectively... And the save file that I have on the USB is just named \"ShadowHearts II\"\n\nI've attached some pictures anyway but yeah, the only save data that is Virtual Memory PS3 that I could find online is from that Game FAQs link and I can't seem to find any other saves unless you manage to have one? The save I used is a North America save so I'm not sure if that's right for the pkg I'm using or not.. But I've got no other option.\n\nso after reading your guide\n\nif i've got this correctly is this right?\n\n1. go to dev_hdd0/savedata/vmc and change the file extension to .MCR\n\n2. download the .MCR file to the pc and open it using MemcardRex\n\n3. place the .MCR file in dev_hdd0/game/SLUS21041/USRDIR/SAVEDATA\n\n4. rename the .MCR file \"SLUS21041\" and change the extension back to .VM1\n\ni've probably messed up somewhere there but i just need to make sure i'm doing it right..\n\nand then for Disc 2 i'd basically do the exact same thing except it'd be for \"SLUS21044\" which is the SLUS for Disc 2.\n\nwould i just copy and paste the SLUS21041.vm1 into the SLUS21044 folder and rename it \"SLUS21044.vm1\"?"
