        "text": "The introduction of Sony's new console, the sequel to the great Playstation, brings with it some of the finest names in RPGing - Final Fantasy, Breath of Fire, and Suikoden. To the common RPGer these series have become household names, and already Final Fantasy X, a beautiful game enjoying superb reviews and hype, has graced the PS2. Yet another, more shadowy and \"underground\" game has also emerged - an RPG produced by Sacnoth and published here in the states by Midway, Shadow Hearts. This amazing game easily holds its own against Final Fantasy X, yet sadly, only a relative few have heard of it. But its lack of attention and media hype does not change the fact that it is an extraordinary game that rarely fails to please.\n\nGraphics (9.5/10): Many have complained of Shadow Hearts's graphics, arguing that they fail to hold up to Final Fantasy X's stunning visuals. To be certain, Shadow Hearts probably does not make much use of the Playstation 2's awesome graphical capabilities; the backgrounds are pre-rendered and the character graphics, compared to Final Fantasy X's, are somewhat lacking. Yet even Shadow Hearts's weak point is not very weak. The backgrounds, though they are \"only\" 2D, still manage to create beautiful, colorful environments. Areas in the game may not look that realistic, yet they undeniably feel very real. Locations visited in Shadow Hearts range from dark, drab caves to bright and cheery cities - cities that tend to reflect the game's finest examples of area design. Shanghai, for instance, feels very much like a wide-open, active town, with its vibrant, lively colors. Likewise, Rouen, a center of mystery and intrigue in the storyline, has a darker, more enigmatic design to it, as the only light in the town comes from the lonely street lamps. So while the area backgrounds may not live up to the standards set by Final Fantasy X, they remain exquisite examples of excellent design that only serve to help the plotline flow more clearly.\n\nThe character graphics themselves serve as an interesting highlight of the game. While some characters seem, at first, to bear ordinary designs, the majority has been created with a great blend of colors that truly make them stick out in the player's mind. Perhaps the best thing about the character graphics is how well they suit those who they were written for. Yuri Hyuga, for example, just looks like a dark, brooding young enigma. Some of the in-battle character graphics will be very striking. Most enemies break away from the generic forms in most RPGs and appear instead as mutated, fearsome demons. They will certainly serve as a bit of a shock to those used to battling \"generic\" enemy types, but they also make battles far more memorable. All in all, Sacnoth has done quite a nice job with graphics, considering the amazing work of the \"competition\". The visuals may not look as pretty as Final Fantasy X's, but they do the storyline and gameplay far more good.\n\nSound (10/10): Without a doubt, music is one of Shadow Hearts's high points. The soundtrack represents a joint effort by Yoshitaka Hirota and Yasunori Mitsuda that produces amazing results. Like the graphics, the soundtrack does an extraordinary job of aiding in the telling of Shadow Hearts's story. The first half of the game, set in China, contains music with clear Asian influence and instruments. Songs that play whenever the main villain comes on screen give off an archaic, mysterious feel that parallels the focus on \"ancient Taoist magic\" as a theme. Likewise, songs that play in cities like Shanghai and Fengtian give them a very lively feel. But the battle themes stand out the most. The \"normal battle\" music combines a steady instrumental pace with background chanting effects, giving off a Gothic and slightly chaotic feel. If you're a fan of music in video games, Shadow Hearts is definitely for you.\n\nGameplay (10/10): Shadow Hearts brings a very original battle system to the face of the RPGing. Whenever a character wants to take an action in battle - be it casting a spell, physically attacking an enemy, or using an item - the player must first conquer the \"Judgment Ring\". The Judgement Ring is an innovative, but complicated, invention that will either irritate or entertain you to no end. Basically, after you choose an action for your character, a large circle appears on the screen, with one to three highlighted triangles drawn out from its center. A radius \"sweeps\" clockwise from one end of the circle to the other, and for the character to successfully attack, cast magic, or use an item, the player must \"stop\" the indicator on each of the triangles as it sweeps through the Ring. Hit the triangle and your character succeeds in performing his action. Miss, and you've just forfeited the character's turn. It's complicated to explain, but it's easy to get used to. If you have quick reflexes, you should have no problems with the Ring. Again, it's a system you'll either love or hate. Personally, I got into it pretty easy and I loved it.\n\nOther than the Judgment Ring, however, the gameplay uses fairly traditional elements. Each character has a subset of spells that can be used, and they learn more spells by gaining levels. This goes for every playable character except for Yuri, whose abilities involve a slightly more complex process. At save points, Yuri can travel alone to the \"Graveyard\", a world within himself where his inner conflicts - and the souls of monsters he has killed - haunt him. Here, Yuri can take on certain demonic monsters to acquire \"Fusion Souls\". These Souls allow Yuri to transform into fearsome demons that enhance his battle power significantly. Again, it sounds complex, but the system is easy to get used to and its originality provides for great fun.\n\nI feel obliged to mention the game's presentation here, because it is very much well done. In most RPGs, the menu system is just \"there\" - it exists so you can save your game, equip and upgrade your characters, and change some settings if you want to. Shadow Hearts' system menu goes above and beyond so well that it absolutely necessitates mention. In addition to providing the generic functions, Shadow Hearts' menu also includes an in-depth library of monsters and characters, much in the style of Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre. A \"score report\" is also included that keeps track of, among other things, how many miles your characters have traveled; how many battles you've fought, won, and ran from; and your accuracy with the Judgment Ring. There is even a \"FAQ\" section of the menu that guides you along with gameplay questions.\n\nOverall, your reflexes, patience, and taste will ultimately determine how much you like the gameplay, but most who turn on the game with an open mind, not expecting a breezy battling system like in the Final Fantasy and Suikoden series, will find it most rewarding. And the professional feel of the system menu will only help you enjoy the game more.\n\nStory (10/10): I save the storyline for last because it is absolutely Shadow Hearts' greatest feature. The plot is deep and intriguing, combining historical and horror/Gothic elements to make a storyline set in Earth circa 1913 AD. By \"Earth\", I mean the game takes place in real locations in a real time in history - the player will travel from China and Hong Kong to Eastern Europe and Britain, in a year struck by tensions as history built up to the First World War. Much of the first half of the game involves characters from the Japanese army, who find themselves in surprisingly interesting conflicts. And the writers did not miss a chance to comment on the horrors of the First World War, which breaks out months after the game's final battle, in an ironic twist to the ending that I dare not spoil. Telling a fictional story in a real setting makes for a very original feature, seen in very few RPGs, and Sacnoth has even been clever enough to base a few characters off of real historical figures.\n\nThe storyline itself follows the quest of Yuri Hyuga, a young Russian-Japanese man who bears the hidden talents of a \"Harmonixer\" - a man who can transform into demons by using ancient magic. He has a chance encounter with the beautiful young Alice Elliott, daughter of a brutally murdered priest, who is being sought after by two evil men, Dehuai and Roger Bacon. Dehuai and Bacon each seem to have their own intentions as they seek out ancient spells that would bring great chaos to the world. And as the RPG plot must go, it is Yuri's job to save the world. Although the basis of the plot is somewhat generic, its execution creates a storyline that is deep and original. While chasing after Roger Bacon (who has one of the most memorable RPG villain names ever), Yuri undergoes deep psychological conflicts as he fights his inner weaknesses and the bizarre Four Masks.\n\nThe characters are another high point of Shadow Hearts, as they are all very lifelike, rich, and memorable. Yuri and Alice are easily among the most well-developed characters in any RPG I've played; their conflicts with both others and their inner selves make for a pair of very intriguing heroes. Likewise, the mysterious Roger Bacon becomes more and more interesting as more is revealed about him. And the other characters are not minor players, either - they also face conflicts and crises that make them just as memorable. I find, however, that the best part of the character development comes in the form of interactions among characters. No player of Shadow Hearts will be likely to forget Yuri and Zhuzhen's immature arguments, Keith's laid-back attitude, Margarete's feisty personality, or the love that awkwardly blooms between Yuri and Alice.\n\nAn amazing story has been written for this game. It brings great characters into great settings to undergo great conflicts; in short, the plot has easily achieved greatness. The inclusion of historical elements makes Shadow Hearts all the more appealing, and its storyline will not disappoint. Its dark, Gothic feel, combined with its deep characters, conflicts, and historical elements, makes for a tale that easily rises above the tide, almost making Final Fantasy X's look shallow. Anyone who is even remotely attracted to a strong plot in an RPG should not pass this game up."
