        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nSpinnerweb\n\n100%PlayStation 2\n\n34h 2m Progress\n\nThis is one of those magnificent games that gets everything right. The combat system, along with Valkyria Chronicles and Grandia III, is one of the best I've seen in a JRPG, and I play a lot of JRPGs so I should know. It constantly keeps you involved. While the original Shadow Hearts' combat system was essentially the same, it was more about reflexes; this game's combat is more about timing. With the addition of a combo system and a proper combat arena, it also ups the high-risk/high-reward mentality even further, and makes it more strategic. Choosing whether to go for massive damage at the risk of wasting four characters' turns, which attacks to use relative to where the enemies were at the time - all this makes for incredibly fun battles that show turn-based combat doesn't have to be just 'mash X to win.'\n\nThe story is a very lengthy, cutscene-filled extravaganza with lots of things to do and places to visit. There were a few moments where I was just in awe of how much love and money was poured into making this game happen because it's not like it had Square Enix money behind it or anything.\n\nI love stories like these in video games, because they truly feel like the kind of stories only a video game can contain; it's too long for a movie, too involved for an anime or show, too visual for a book. If it ever did get adapted, it would have required several entries to convey the story that you get here in one game. Hell, even the game needed two discs that are packed full to bursting.\n\nThe main cast is largely new characters, but because several characters return from the first game, you do have to play that one first because 1. it's awesome and 2. it's the only way to actually get this story. The new characters were extremely likeable and felt just as much the hero's 'family' as those in the first. I love that this series isn't afraid to shy away from good emotional storytelling instead of going for wishy-washy nonsense as well. There's humour, sadness, acceptance, fulfilment. I care for characters so much more when they can bleed, when they carry on even when some things are final, and yet there's always hope in the end.\n\nThe music was superb, because MY MAN Yasunori Mitsuda worked on it. The overworld music was so peaceful, while battle music was intense and badass. Since the game cuts back on the horror elements of the first, there was much less trickery with dissonance this time around... except when a character goes berserk. But in keeping with the game's aesthetic and presentation, it was great and reached ever greater heights alongside the story.\n\nThe graphics were a marked step up from the first, with few pre-rendered elements this time around. They have that wonderful mid-2000s PS2 game look which always makes me happy. The monster designs were very inspired this time around as well, and I liked how characters and areas from the original game were 'revisited' to make them look even better.\n\nThis is one of the best JRPGs on the PS2. This series is incredible. The next game will be the last one, and as much as I feel this series deserved far more success than it had (it did okay, but it was no Final Fantasy), so far I think it's good that way. The stories this series tells, it's much better to let them end beautifully than to drag them on. Covenant ends the original story and From The New World, as far as I know, is a new story. Which is all right. I couldn't have asked for more. 10/10!\n\nShareCompleted\n\nExhuminator\n\n80%PlayStation 2\n\n41h 59m Played\n\n\"Shadow Hearts: Covenant\" is a JRPG developed by Nautilus, and published by Midway in 2004 (in the USA anyway). \"Covenant\" is actually part three of the \"Shadow Hearts\" series. It continues a narrative that began in \"Koudelka\", evolved through \"Shadow Hearts\" and then reached climax in \"Shadow Hearts: Covenant\". \"Covenant\" boasts a greatly increased budget compared to its fore-bearers, doing its best to poise as a grandiose JRPG. Noticeable alterations to the original series' concept are evident, apparently catering to target demographic expectations of its genre.\n\n+A highly polished obvious labor of love.\n\n+Complex game mechanics offer tactical interactivity.\n\n+Dungeons offer continuous variety.\n\n+Marvelous enemy monster concepts.\n\n+Extremely impressive set designs.\n\n-This game's difficulty is a total cakewalk.\n\n-\"Shadow Hearts: Covenant\"'s plot is far weaker than \"Shadow Hearts\"'s or \"Koudelka\"'s plots were.\n\n-A goofy sense of humor is too often at odds with otherwise dark themes.\n\n-Copious sidequests require a walkthrough to even known they exist.\n\n-Completion time is at least ten hours longer than it needed to be.\n\n\"Covenant\" tried to keep what worked from \"Koudelka\" and \"Shadow Hearts\", while attempting to placate to typical JRPG expectations. There are many examples of this, but Yuri (the protagonist) is a key point of my contention. In the original \"Shadow Hearts\", Yuri was a total badass. He was fearless, courageous, sometimes evil, and above all else never doubted his own convictions. In \"Covenant\" Yuri has been watered down into an angry emo teenager, who too often falls victim to melodramatic self-doubt, and constantly allows himself to be manipulated by others around him. This character (assassination) change was put into place in tandem with a huge dollop of silly humor that permeates large portions of \"Covenant\". Often \"Covenant\" attempts to amuse its player with whimsy antics and surreal characters, apparently in an attempt to keep the overall experience from being too serious. Unfortunately these attempts at humor are hugely detrimental to the developer's attempts at otherwise pathos-addled cutscenes. It would take far more talented writers than this game had, to be able to pull off the kind of silly humor they chose, while also having the player take the game's plot seriously. This is doubly aggravating considering the original \"Koudelka\" and \"Shadow Hearts\" had great plots and solid writing.\n\nPutting the questionable writing aside, the rest of \"Covenant\" is mostly strong above average stuff. The graphics are wonderful, the OST is rather good (though often repetitive), party members are concept-original and highly varied, and there are subsystems on top of subsystems - combat complexity is certainly here if you want it. There are copious sidequests and secrets to find, and a fair amount of collectables as well. It is obvious that Nautilus really cared a LOT about \"Covenant\", and they went the extra mile polishing it. It's easy to be impressed with much of what is on display here. Most JRPG fans would likely enjoy \"Covenant\" quite a bit, and this game's reviews prove that fact.\n\nUnfortunately for this JRPG fan, I can't give \"Covenant\" a completely glowing score. Too often this game's outrageous sense of humor fell flat for me, and ultimately its writing was amateur hour. Far too often I sat though long, boring, drawn out dialogues that completely failed to engage me. This lack of engagement carried with it a severe dearth of difficulty. That is to say that \"Shadow Hearts: Covenant\" is extremely easy to beat. Now when you've got a game that lasts over forty hours with a tepid plot and unchallenging battles... well, that's not exactly prime JRPG material in my opinion. However the impressive graphics, fantastic CGI cutscenes, varied dungeon designs, beautiful backdrops, crazy monsters, and other small parts added up enough to keep me interested till the end. And after the ending cutscene, I was very glad I'd beaten \"Shadow Hearts\" before \"Covenant\", because of the way \"Covenant\"'s ending tied so well into the original \"Shadow Hearts\"'s beginning - a rare moment of excellent writing in \"Covenant\"'s case.\n\nThere are a considerable amount of JRPGs on PS2. Most of them are mediocre, some are terrible. The original \"Shadow Hearts\" is top shelf material. Its sequel \"Covenant\" is simply not as good as its predecessor. However, \"Covenant\" is still noticeably above average, and I daresay quite a bit better than most JRPGs on PS2. While I wish \"Covenant\" had been as dark, scary, serious, and challenging as its predecessor; I still walked away from \"Covenant\" fairly entertained nonetheless. After all, it's not every day you get to beat up demons as a dirty old incestuous pedophiliac marionettist.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nquain\n\n80%PlayStation 2\n\n34h 38m Played\n\n(I played this on an early edition PS3. There is a bug with the backwards compatability where running can cause the game to freeze for 10-15 seconds. It occurs fairly often and can be irritating, but did not make the game unplayable/unenjoyable. Might just be luck/superstition, but definitely felt like making small movements with the joystick caused these freezes -- if I was pushing all the way in one direction it occurred less often.)\n\nA solid JRPG with a bit of heart that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the archetype and has played through the staples.\n\nGameplay - Fairly standard fare turn-based combat. The one wrinkle is the combat wheel, wherein whenever you execute an action a wheel fires up with 1 - 5 hit zones. The wheel will spin and you have to hit an input on every hit zone; missing a zone ends the spin and only executes the number of attacks you hit. It's an interesting mechanic that you can adjust to make more or less difficult (with increased difficulty generally meaning more damage). It can get a tiny bit tedious, but I didn't feel that way until the very end of the game, so it plays pretty well for what seems like it would be a burden.\n\nThe game has flexible magic in the form of crests that most characters can use and many of the characters also have unique mechanics, but they ultimately just amount to 'magic' with a different name.\n\nStory - Enjoyable and funny characters and intereactions. Overall plot starts off stronger than it ends -- by the end of Disc 2 I was more or less disinterested because it's obvious where it was going and the execution was nothing special.\n\nGraphics - Strong for a PS2 title. Most locales look very good and character models are well detailed. Nothing about them will turn you off -- except the women. Most of the main female characters, playable and otherwise, tend to be scantily/stupidly clad. Just a warning to google a few screenshots if that's something that bothers you."
