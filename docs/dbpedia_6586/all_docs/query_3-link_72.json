        "text": "There are a lot of great JRPG series out there in the past that deserve a lot of love, and I think Shadow Hearts franchise is one of them. This series lived and died with the Playstation 2, and to this day, to my knowledge, has not seen a single game inspired by this amazing RPG series which is a damn shame.\n\nShadow Hearts and its sequel(s) are quite unique as far as JRPG goes. While majority of JRPG's are set in entirely fantasy/sci-fi world, Shadow Hearts games take place in alternate history of our real world, mostly set in not so distant past around World War 1. That said, you would be exploring places across the globe during those time period, and all the while experiencing a unique, darker twist to the world, and the story that was told. The games decidedly took elements of survival horror genre with regards to the atmosphere and story-telling, which was fascinating and rarely done in the genre. The gameplay in these games are also quite fun, featuring a system that test player's timing and reflex with the judgement ring. The story was brilliant IMO especially how the game connects the first game and the sequel, actually has good sense of humor so it's not completely dark and tense. The characters are interesting and likeable (Yuri is one of the best JRPG protag), and the music in the first two games was done by Yasunori Mitsuda of Chrono and Xenogears fame, they were amazing.\n\nAlas, all good things come to an end, but I'm hoping for a miracle that we might see a new game or a spiritual successor of some sort to this franchise.\n\nThe third game was a major snoozefest though, couldn't get into that at all. But yeah the first 2 games are fairly unique games. 2 lost some of the atmosphere, but overall I thought it was the best in the series.\n\nFrom the New World definitely is a step back in terms of everything aside from the gameplay. It was the strongest there in that aspect, but unfortunately they ditched a lot of the elements that made the first two so good. IMO still a pretty solid game for what it is.\n\nThis is really makes me sad, I love the first 2 games (FtNW doesn't exist). Machida talking about making a new game did make me pretty happy but it's probably going to be a spiritual successor and not a actual sequel.\n\nThanks\n\nhttps://gematsu.com/2016/01/shadow-hearts-creator-working-new-video-game\n\nA bit off-topic: he is not the creator of SH, he wasn't even involved with SH1 as far as I'm aware. If anything Itakura or even Kikuta are more of a ''creator of Shadow Hearts'' than him. Not to discredit his accomplishments with SH2 of course.\n\nThanks Sesha :)\n\nI was at a board game one night and I kept saying Shadow Hearts instead of the game we were playing (Shadow Hunters) it lead me to explaining to a friend afterwards what that series was. I mostly described II and he thought I was making it up.\n\nFrom the new world was a let down. Mostly because I thought Koudelka would be in it. However, that game had the best vampire of that whole series.\n\nThis is really makes me sad, I love the first 2 games (FtNW doesn't exist).

Itakura and Machida are the same person.\n\nThis is really makes me sad, I love the first 2 games (FtNW doesn't exist).

If anything Itakura or even Kikuta are more of a ''creator of Shadow Hearts'' than him. Not to discredit his accomplishments with SH2 of course.\n\nHe might be working on a new game, but what he's answering to the question about kickstarting a new game doesn't give me the impression that his new work will be SH-like at all. It doesn't sound like he thinks there's much of a market for a new SH-like RPG.\n\n\"I guess that there are people interested in an RPG with features from Shadow Hearts, but I also feel that they are a minority compared to fans of other RPGs in general. On a personal level, obviously the presence of such fans is indeed precious. Should I get the chance to, one day I would like to create something able to answer their expectations, and I would definitely throw all of myself into it.\"\n\nGrandia\n\nShadow Hearts\n\nGrowlanser\n\nValkyrie Profile (The latest teaser might be something)\n\nWe hurtin', fam.\n\nAdding to that:\n\nSuikoden\n\nBreath of Fire\n\nWild Arms\n\nOh wow you just blew my mind, every time I seen him he always been referred to with his new name. Thanks for this, disregard by previous post haha.\n\nFor whatever reason he goes by Machida now. If you look at the credits under both names it all adds up."
