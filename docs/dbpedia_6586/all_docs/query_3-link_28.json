        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nEltheKvothe\n\n100%PlayStation 2\n\n30h Played\n\nThe darkest fairy tale I've ever experienced in video game form.\n\n**Gameplay 7/10**: While the game boasts an innovative and unique combat system with the Judgement Ring, it has yet to reach its full potential. The sequel introduces more quality of life improvements to this system, including enhanced visual quality, more customization options, and an overall superior experience. This isn't to say the system in this game isn't fantastic—it’s just not flawless.\n\n**Story 10/10**: An incredible journey spanning two continents, set in an alternate universe where historical events are intertwined with fiction and mythology, creating a plot rich with mystery and the occult.\n\n**Visuals/Atmosphere 8/10**: Despite the graphics occasionally resembling PS1 games and the cutscenes being almost atrocious (possibly the worst I've seen on the PS2), the atmosphere and haunting backgrounds elevate this game significantly. The ambiance is top-notch, eerie, and captivating (the Blue Castle background might be my favorite setting in any game I've ever played).\n\n**Characters 8/10**: For me, the main characters of the game are Yuri, Alice, and Halley. These characters are well-crafted, deeply developed, and thoroughly fleshed out. The rest of the cast served more as comic relief without significant character development. For instance, I felt like I knew nothing about Margarette or Zhuzhen. I wish the rest of the cast had been better developed, especially given the game's relatively short length.\n\n**Music 9/10**: The OST is largely memorable and perfectly complements the game's atmosphere, adding a sense of mystery and darkness. Unfortunately, a few tracks (mostly town themes) broke my immersion.\n\n**Voice Acting 5/10**: The voice acting is borderline bad, but tolerable. Voice acting wasn't a major focus in the West during the PS2 era, so this is understandable. Would I prefer the game without voice acting? I'm not sure, but I would like to try the Japanese voice acting in my next playthrough.\n\n**UI 10/10**: While not typically a major concern, I found the menus and index in this game to be exceptional. I read every description of every item and enemy, and it was truly engaging.\n\nOverall, this is realistically an 8.5/10 game. So, why am I giving it a 10? Because I have never played anything like it. While the sequel surpasses the first game in almost every aspect, improving significantly on all fronts, it loses some of the atmosphere that defined Shadow Hearts and Koudelka. It takes a more humorous approach, which I also enjoy, but the first game’s haunting tone resonates more with me.\n\nUltimately, I've decided to give a 10/10 to any game that compels me to start a second playthrough immediately, and this is one of those rare games.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nCindaarR\n\n90%PlayStation 2\n\n26h Played\n\nUnusual game combining horror and turn based RPG. Shadow Hearts, second to only Final Fantasy in my favourite RPG series list, is sadly one of the most cult following games of cult following games having both very traditional JRPG elements and horror aspects, its about as niche as you get and on top of everything it came out a week before FF10 came out meaning it never stood a chance to get the recognition it deserved. I wasn't sure at first when my sister gave me her copy to play but after trying it I soon fell in love with its grim tale and genius combat system.\n\nIf there's one thing people do know about Shadow Hearts its the Judgement Ring battle system that combines turn based combat with a dose of rhythm game timing, now I am not too much of a rhythm game enjoyer but when you have something as perfect as the ring system you'll soon become a believer in its genius, it hits the sweet spot of rewarding risk reward and ease of use, like most video game mechanics its hard to describe in words but its just one of those things that once you try it'll click for you. The rest of the RPG system is pretty traditional with arbitrary stat/skill upgrades when levelling up and the usual equipment slots, its lacking some of the customisation options for sure but you do get access to some interesting accessories later on that spice things up like there's one that makes the ring invisible but doubles your ATK power so there's some thinking outside the box.\n\nI always love it when games combine history with fantasy and that is something that the Shadow Hearts game do very well, you go from doing Taoism rituals in Shanghai to exorcisms in eastern Europe to battling against inquisition witch hunters, there's rarely a boring local that you'll visit. The cast of characters is just as colourful as the places you visit with people from extremely different walks of life making up your party and who doesn't like having a gallant vampire guy doing doing anime sword swings for his attacks? The horror aspect is done well with a steady supply of creepy imagery that walks the line of being unsettling but not too vulgar and you'll often be exclaiming \"what am I looking at?\" when fighting the Lovecraftian like monsters.\n\nOK, as you may have gathered, there isn't too much I don't like about this game but I have to admit that this an ugly game with graphics that were dated at the time (see; FF10 coming out a week later for proof), the special effects are probably the worst offenders with basic particle effects very commonly repeated for magic but just different colours. Also this is probably the record holder for recoloured enemies being used so brace yourself for fifty shades of kappa. The VA is pretty bad but thankfully there's not much of it but when it hits, it hits hard, looking at you Sea Mother...slurp...slurp...splat.\n\nOverall story is your standard \"party of heroes trying to stop the world being destroyed\" that we've all seen hundreds of times but I think having the game set in the real world does add that extra level of gravitas to it and its told pretty well with character motivations being explained. The Koudelka stuff does feel a little tacked on, I didn't feel like I missing out by not knowing about it so there's no need to play it to enjoy this. Some of the themes are kind of just thrown out there now and again like the anti war stuff making some of the story a little unfocused at times but like I said overall the story is engaging and any game that has the cojones to kill off characters gets a pass from me.\n\nThe first game in the Shadow Hearts series and yes its rough around the edges but what progenitor in a series isn't? Love the characters, love the setting, love the dark themes and love the combat but I'm going to reluctantly give this a 9/10 for the above mentioned graphics and unbalanced combat that's too easy but when Penny Blood arrives you can bet I'm playing that straight away for another dose of Shadow Hearts inspired goodness.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nMrsonicisawesome\n\n80%PlayStation 2\n\n24h 20m Played\n\nI loved the combat system with the wheel and liked how they used it in a way where it can be manipulated in battle and even used for things such as buying and selling items for higher prices. The story always had a creepy vibe to it with what situations you got into, locations you went, and enemies you fought.\n\nMy biggest problem would be that the Fusion mechanic probably could have been done a little better as I didn't find too many battles where I would switch to different forms from the one I started out on because it costed too much SP. The writing is actually pretty entertaining and has a lot of great moments, it can get a little confusing with how certain lines are written but it's nothing major.\n\nThe music was very different and most all of the tracks were pleasing to listen to and had nice beats to them. The characters were all pretty interesting and likeable although I do think some members could have got a little more development. It was also pretty challenging and one thing I loved and wished it did more was split up the group and essentially force you to use every member of the party. This made the game feel fresh every time this happened because it's as if they're pushing you to get better at using everyone instead of sticking to the same characters.\n\nIt was a very enjoyable game and I'm excited to see how they'll evolve the combat system in future games.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nSpinnerweb\n\n100%PlayStation 2\n\n21h 22m Progress\n\nShadow Hearts deserves more than just a cult following. It's a wonderfully stylized gothic JRPG.\n\nThe pre-rendered cutscenes had an inspired mix of styles and narration. Even if the plot didn't stray far from the usual JRPG formula of 'beat the villain who wants world domination and kill God,' it was so well-told and the adventures along the way meant nothing felt tired or unoriginal. The soundtrack is excellent, using organs, bells, vocals, Chinese instruments I can't remember the name of, and even some hard rock. What really impressed me is how well they used dissonance for the creepy tracks. Yasunori Mitsuda worked on this, so it was guaranteed to be good.\n\nThe unique battle system ensures that you're constantly involved and can't play through it on monkey-brain mode. It rewards good reflexes, something I haven't seen in many turn-based JRPGs, and I would alternatively cheer inwardly when I got Perfects, or cringe when my turn got wasted because I pressed the button a millisecond too late. There's a lot of customizability to the battle system with the items and equipment you get too.\n\nOverall, this is one of the most fun JRPGs I've played in a while. The story and characters are cool, the dark gothic style is right up my alley, and the battle system is one of the best I've seen in a turn-based JRPG."
