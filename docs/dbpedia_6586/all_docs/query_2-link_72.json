        "text": "Kickstarter ongoing for spiritual successors to the Shadow Hearts and Wild Arms series\n\nA quick search didn't reveal that such a thread was already on the forum, so I figured I'd make one to let people know about this.\n\nA kickstarter is currently ongoing (22 days left) for teams made up of people that made the Shadow Hearts and Wild Arms series to fund their new games - Penny Blood as the spiritual successor to the Shadow Hearts series and Armed Fantasia as the spiritual successor to the Wild Arms series.\n\nKickstarter link:\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublekickstarter/armed-fantasia-and-penny-blood/description\n\nQ&A:\n\nQ: How does it all work?\n\nA: From what I've understood, the total funds you see gathered directly contribute to the common goals for both games, displayed in the middle on the list of stretch goals.\n\nFor example, \"both games funded\" and \"console versions\" for both games have been cleared already.\n\nWhile goals for individual games are displayed (AF on the left and PB on the left). backers don't have direct insight into how much money goes to the team for each individual game aside from seeing if the goals have been met.\n\nE.g. if one game gets more funds than the other one, its own goals will be met faster, but we don't see that openly, given the kickstarter's structure.\n\nThey have 2 separate teams for each game, they're just funding both in one kickstarter.\n\nQ: So I'm expected to back both games?\n\nA: No, you don't have to.\n\nThere are plenty of backing tiers for AF, PB, or both games.\n\nYou can also pick between physical copies of the games or digital ones - said choice also applies to their artbooks and soundtracks.\n\nSome rewards are physical only, given their nature. E.g. a keychain is a physical item.\n\nQ: Em, why are the default pledge amounts listed in yen?\n\nA: Might be because the developers are Japanese, but you'll see the equivalent amount in the currency you go for.\n\nE.g. the Combo Digital Deal for both games says \"¥11,000\" and it equates to about 79€ and you get digital copies of both games on the platform of your choosing.\n\nQ: So I can pick on what platform I want the game(s) on?\n\nA: Yup. According to the people behind the kickstarter, you'll get an email a few months after the kickstarter is over to specify what copy (or copies) you want.\n\nQ: Do they have an estimate on when the games will be made and on what platform?\n\nA: Sometime in 2025 for now. They'll let the backers know if that changes.\n\nThey plan on plenty of platforms, including Steam and GOG on PC and console versions have been met as a stretch goal.\n\nQ: Do they have any promotional material?\n\nA: Yup, it's listed on the top of the \"Campaign\" tab.\n\nFor descriptions of each game on the kickstarter, scroll down past the stretch goals.\n\n(The goals were moved on top, so they're more visible and not buried under the long game presentations.)\n\nCurrently, the trailers for both games and the joined kickstarter are on their youtube channels, for example.\n\nQ: Where can I get more information?\n\nA: I'd recommend checking the FAQ section on the kickstarter itself.\n\nHopefully, that covers the basic information people might want to know or the parts that weren't immediately obvious are clearer now.\n\nI don't work with either team, I'm just a backer and a fan of the Shadow Hearts series that wants Penny Blood to be as awesome as the trailer suggests and I wish Armed Fantasia all the best too. :)"
