        "text": "This is by far the lightest of the three Shadow Heart games being that it contains a lot of humor. Nearly all of the dark edge and Gothic look from the previous installments is gone replaced by Amazon ninjas and giant cats. The judgment ring is back and as good as ever. However, this time there are add ons to the battles I did not care for called double attacks. The problem with these is that the enemy is more efficient at using them than you are and this just makes the game a bit harder than I like my role playing games to be. It also makes the enemy turns longer too, which I always hate the enemy turn to take forever. Still, it did not detract from the game all that much. The story is okay too, just not as good as the other two. Johnny Garland is a boy detective living with somebody you will recognize from the previous game. He is waiting for a big case and gets it from a creepy man named Gilbert and boy does it turn out to be a big case as he must team up with a wild assortment of characters to track down a mysterious person only called lady and her accomplice Killer. During the way you will also meet an old friend and visit many locales. However, later in the game to many of these locales end up being old temples so you just don't have all the cool locations of the first two games. Yuri is also gone and is no where to be seen and that is a shame, I kept hoping for some type of appearance. So all in all a good entry, it is just after the spectacle that was part two, this one just is not very spectacular."
