I would tell you, but i do better than that and in a lazy way, a link to the site.\n\nhttp://www.shadowheartscovenant.com/\n\nAlso, can you tell me any news on the uk release date of shadow hearts: from the new world. Because midway don't publish shadow hearts anymore and wondering if any other company picked it up[/url]\n\nShadow Hearts 2: Convenant is one of those games that the gamefaq users overhype to extreme levels. I did enjoy the game but it's certainly not deserving of being 'godly'. If your looking for a better RPG, I suggest trying out Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga. It will be released next month here.\n\nBut having said that, I do have Shadow Hearts 3: From The New World on my RPG pile to play with Grandia 3, Dragon Quest VIII, Front Mission 4, Xenosaga 1 & 2 etc.\n\nI enjoyed the humour of the Shadow Heart games but I actually liked the more serious tone of the first game and that the characters were better. My favourite characters seem to be the type that get no character development whatsoever like: SH1 - Margaret, SH2 - Lucia, SH3 - ???\n\nFor a release on Shadow Hearts 3.. I haven't heard anything. It's published by Xseed in the US who also brought over Wild Arms 4. It seems unlikely, but hopefully a publisher like Ghostlight or 505 Gamestreet will pick it up.\n\n________\n\nPt Platform\n\nneptune2venus said:\n\nShadow Hearts 2: Convenant is one of those games that the gamefaq users overhype to extreme levels.

Yep, it is, but i'm really disapointed that theres no word on a european release date. They have to, they released the first and second. so why can this, it be too wrong, uk should have it, you know.\n\nI know this is a bit late, but i recently completed shadow hearts: covenant. And i was really shocked with the good ending, it feel like there won't be a proper sequel with yuri again. looked at the bad ending on youtube and it nowhere as groundbreaking and heartbreaking as the good ending. It feel likes yuri won't be in the shadow hearts series anymore, someone prove me wrong, please. Yuri is one of my most favorite characters and i hope shadow hearts 3 will come out with yuri in this time"
