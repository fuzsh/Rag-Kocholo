During 1934 - 1947, Welles was a big star in radio, a major medium at that time in the United States. This made Welles one of America's best known performers. Welles used his radio earnings to support his critically praised work in the New York theater. He also leveraged his radio stardom to launch a career in motion pictures. This opportunity to work in the movies was fairly common for radio stars of the day, although Welles' achievements in film went further than any other radio personality. Welles directed 7 films from 1940-1947, all financed by Hollywood studios. Welles is astonishingly prolific in these years, in radio, theater and film.\n\nAll of this changes abruptly mid-1947. Welles leaves America for Europe, and his career will never be the same again. Welles mainly stops working in radio drama, which is a dying medium from this point on, one that soon ceases to exist in the United States. He does far less theater work, as well. In 1949, after a number of commercial European film projects fall through, Welles starts filming his self-financed production of Othello. From this point forward, much of Welles' creative work will be self-financed, based on his income as a movie actor.\n\nThere will be exceptions to this, especially during a period of temporary commercial success in 1954-1957, when Welles will film:\n\nMr. Arkadin and Touch of Evil for commercial producers.\n\nA series of television projects including Orson Welles' Sketch Book, Around the World with Orson Welles and The Fountain of Youth.\n\nA self-financed film, Moby Dick - Rehearsed.\n\nAside from this interlude, Welles will have no real basis of public or commercial support for most of his non-acting work from 1947 on. He will be viewed as a has-been by most of the world - or maybe as a never-was. While French film critics will view Orson Welles as a giant of the film medium, American reviewers will largely slam his work.\n\nWelles and Culture\n\nOrson Welles spent a considerable part of his stage, radio and film careers, dramatizing major works of world literature. Despite this, he garnered little support after 1945 from guardians or promoters of culture or cultural education.\n\nWelles released three Shakespeare films, that were largely dismissed in their eras. Their reception contrasts with Laurence Olivier's Hamlet, which won Oscars, and which was treated as a major cultural event.\n\nSimilarly, Welles' adaptation of Isak Dinesen, The Immortal Story, hardly made a critical ripple. But a later film version of Dinesen, Out of Africa, was showered with Oscars and acclaim.\n\nWelles received and receives almost no recognition from professors who teach literature, or the humanities. While Welles was the major American interpreter of Shakespeare of his era, his adaptations of Shakespeare and other literary authors are treated by non-film professors of the humanities as not being of the slightest interest or value. One can compare the all out efforts made by the academy to promote Existentialism, Deconstructionism and Lacan, to the complete indifference shown to Welles.\n\nThe Voodoo Macbeth\n\nThe Voodoo Macbeth (1936) is a stage play directed by Orson Welles, a famous, much acclaimed version of Macbeth with an all-black cast. The play's finale was filmed as part of the WPA documentary We Work Again (1937). It is unclear if Welles had anything to do with directing the film version. But it does preserve an excerpt from Welles' stage production. It is the first of Welles' great Shakespeare productions to survive.\n\nEven at this early date, the set shows favorite Orson Welles motifs:\n\nA staircase, and a landing on top.\n\nAn arched doorway (under the landing).\n\nWhat look like trunks of palm trees on the painted backdrop. (This Is Orson Welles says \"Birnam wood\" consisted of palms and banana trees, in this Haiti-set version.)\n\nThe people assemble at the finale: an early example of this key Welles subject.\n\nThe finale is quite cut from Shakespeare's text. But it includes Macbeth's remarks about the Sun. This is an early example of the Sun imagery that runs through Welles.\n\nMacduff carries a trumpet: one of the black musicians in Welles.\n\nMacduff's costume is full of parallel lines. These include nested triangles along the front of his tunic.\n\nToo Much Johnson\n\nToo Much Johnson (1938) is a silent film comedy Orson Welles created to accompany a stage play. It is available free on-line here.\n\nSociety\n\nToo Much Johnson seems directly linked as a historical film about earlier America to Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons.\n\nThe suffragettes and the crowd cheering them, are an early example in Welles of people assembling for political purposes.\n\nThe suffragettes are very Gibson Girl-ish. They are consistent with Welles' portraits of a vanished era in WASP upper middle class life. But they don't look anything like the real-life suffragettes in this landmark newsreel, part of the TREASURES DVD series.\n\nThis is an early film with that favorite Welles setting Latin America.\n\nWelles Subjects\n\nWelles loves scenes of staircases, landings and balconies. The many New York city shots of fire escapes and roofs are spectacular examples. The ship and its various decks, with a ladder connecting them, are also instances. The dockside scenes anticipate Mr. Arkadin.\n\nA sign near the water says \"Private\" and \"Keep Out\". It anticipates the \"No Trespassing\" sign that opens and closes Citizen Kane.\n\nThe roof chimneys emitting smoke (during the chase in New York) anticipate the finale of Citizen Kane.\n\nThe palms will return at Xanadu in the newsreel in Citizen Kane. Palms run through Welles films.\n\nThe bed shakes with wild lovemaking. It links beds with sex. This gives new meaning to shots of disassembled beds in other Welles films: the finale with Kane's possessions in Citizen Kane, the opening at Tamiroff's in Mr. Arkadin. Such shots suggest a tragic end to sexuality.\n\nWe see that favorite Welles subject, the Sun, during some spectacular shots at sea.\n\nVehicles\n\nWelles liked carriages, drawn by horses. A woman and a trunk ride in an open carriage, at the dock. It especially resembles the one in The Immortal Story.\n\nThis is contrasted with an early motorcar, which also arrives at the docks. Early automobiles are a major subject in The Magnificent Ambersons. Here in Too Much Johnson, horse-drawn carriages and early autos appear in the same shot. It is like a pendant to The Magnificent Ambersons, a visual embodiment of the Ambersons theme of autos vs horse-drawn vehicles.\n\nThe hero is also in a horse-drawn food wagon, during the earlier encounter at the warehouse district.\n\nThe Maze\n\nThe hero and villain chase each other through the stacked boxes and baskets in the warehouse district. The stacks form a maze.\n\nThe shots anticipate the Mirror Maze at the finale of The Lady From Shanghai. This also has characters pursuing each other through the maze.\n\nEventually the stacks are overturned, and the maze is disintegrated, in some visually spectacular shots. This anticipates the way the mirrors are shattered at the end of The Lady From Shanghai.\n\nI predict that this scene will become almost as well known as the finale of The Lady From Shanghai.\n\nThe Ladder\n\nThe ladder carried by the hero anticipates the long objects carried by men in other Welles, such as the logs for the raft in It's All True.\n\nBoth the ladder the hero carries, and the horse the hero rides, are phallic symbols. Such symbols are perhaps appropriate for comedy.\n\nThe hero whirls the ladder around while on the roof, in some spectacular shots. This is an example of the rotary motion in Welles films.\n\nHow did Joseph Cotten keep his balance during these tricky scenes? He must have the poise and balance of a cat.\n\nRepeated Rhythms\n\nWelles films are full of scenes in which a repeated action forms a rhythmic pulse. Such scenes play a major role in Too Much Johnson:\n\nA man puts his hat off and on repeatedly while packing.\n\nCharacters keep crossing the alley at greater distances. This sequence will one day be seen as one of the classic Welles shots, I predict.\n\nThe villain takes off mens' hats. This is also turned into a striking piece of filmmaking, intercut with shots from above making complex compositions.\n\nThe chase past posts, with hero and villain repeatedly encountering a series of short posts past which they have to dodge.\n\nSaluting repeatedly.\n\nClimbing twin fire escapes in parallel. Also a classic scene. The two men's motions are closely synchronized, to strong rhythmic effect.\n\nComposition: Fanning vertical lines\n\nA shot showing palm trees, is one of Welles' compositions involving vertical lines jutting at angles.\n\nAnother shot shows boxes pilled high on a dock. The stacks too form vertical lines, although not quite at jutting angles to each other.\n\nComposition: Signs\n\nThe suffragettes carry signs, and wear banners. This is an early example of Welles' approach of creating compositions out of signs, posters or banners.\n\nThere are also big signs on some of the New York City warehouses in the chase scenes.\n\nSigns are also prominent on the dock.\n\nComposition: Architecture\n\nThe windows under the roof gables are arched. Welles likes arched doorways. While these are windows, not doors, characters do move through them, like doorways, onto the roof.\n\nThe peaked roofs Welles like are common in the New York chase scenes.\n\nCostumes and Geometry\n\nThe thimble-shaped helmets worn by the Keystone Kop-style police, will get echoed in shape by the hats worn by the Brazilian fishermen in It's All True, and by the tall first derby tried on in opening of The Magnificent Ambersons. This shape is unusual and distinctive. It seems nearly unique to Orson Welles; I haven't noticed it much in other filmmakers.\n\nThe hero in the Cuba finale is an early Welles man in a white suit.\n\nWilliam Gillette\n\nThe original play Too Much Johnson (1894) was written by William Gillette, adapted from a French farce.\n\nI've seen and disliked two films made from Gillette's most famous play Sherlock Holmes (1899). These are the silent film Sherlock Holmes (Albert Parker, 1922) with John Barrymore, and a \"filmed stage play\" version Sherlock Holmes (Peter H. Hunt, 1981) with Frank Langella. While the original Holmes stories by Doyle seem fresh and terrific today, Gillette's's play seems like a creaking relic of the Victorian era.\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nArtistic Creation\n\nCitizen Kane is filled with backstage looks at the creation of several types of artworks or communication systems:\n\nThe newsreel. This is a film-within-the film.\n\nThe opera. This is both a musical work, and a full-scale stage creation. It reminds us that Welles was a theater director as well as a filmmaker.\n\nThe newspaper.\n\nA photograph of the newspaper staff.\n\nThe review of the opera.\n\nA political campaign, complete with speeches and newspaper headlines and coverage.\n\nA zoo, built in the newsreel.\n\nWe also get looks at some finished projects in the arts and communication. We don't see these being created. So they are simpler, more straightforward in their presentation. But they otherwise seem like addendums to the above list:\n\nThe financier's testimony to a Congressional committee.\n\nThe financier's memoirs.\n\nThe speech to the crowd in Times Square.\n\nThe newsreel is like a miniature version of Citizen Kane as a whole. Both are film biographies of Kane. The scenes of the newsmen discussing the making of the newsreel, likely paralleled the creation of Citizen Kane itself.\n\nSome artworks, such as Citizen Kane, include material that discusses the creation of art works. Literary theorist Alastair Fowler talks about post-modern literature in which creation of an artwork is itself a subject of the book. He dubs this \"poioumenon\". (Its plural is poioumena. It seems to be pronounced pwee-OU-meh-non, rather like \"phenomenon\"). Citizen Kane is perhaps an ancestor of this sort of post-modernism.\n\nIn Citizen Kane, the look at the newsreel creation, symbolically gives insight to the making of Citizen Kane itself. In both Citizen Kane and many post-modernist books, the creation of the work itself is a subject. This gives Citizen Kane and such books a self-reflexive quality.\n\nA Western?: Mining and Capitalism\n\nThe scenes at the mother's boarding house take place in the rural West pre-1900. Technically this makes Citizen Kane a Western. But it has very little \"Western\" feel, even in this boarding house scene. One Western touch: the triangle-shaped bell on the porch, a common feature used to summon cowhands in Westerns.\n\nAs far as I know, Orson Welles never made any other Westerns, as a director or writer. As an actor he starred in a film set in the modern-day West Man in the Shadow (Jack Arnold, 1957), and narrated a Canadian TV series Tales of the Klondike (1981). Twenty years later in This Is Orson Welles, Welles complained to Peter Bogdanovich about having to appear in a Western like Man in the Shadow. In Filming The Trial (1981), Welles tells USC students that he had only learned to like watching Westerns in recent years.\n\nThe emphasis on gold mining in the Western part of Citizen Kane perhaps finds an echo in some later full scale Westerns centered on mining. These later works are a closely connected series, but their links to Citizen Kane are distant. Like Citizen Kane, they explore both mining and capitalism. Also like Citizen Kane, they de-emphasize most traditional components of the Western, such as cowboys and horses, to concentrate instead on mining and its business implications:\n\nSilver River (Raoul Walsh, 1948). Belle Le Grand (Allan Dwan, 1951).\n\nThe pilot of the Maverick TV show, War of the Silver Kings (Budd Boetticher, 1957).\n\nCompositions\n\nThe dissolves in Citizen Kane are beautifully designed to make geometric patterns, during the moment of superimposition. For example, when the opera singers appear simultaneously with the newspaper headlines, they are grouped around the rectilinear lines formed by the newspaper column. So are the opera audiences. The huge circular lights are also set so they blend seamlessly into the compositions.\n\nThe newspaper columns show Welles' interest in repeating vertical lines. One thinks of the hotel windows at the ledge finale of Journey Into Fear, or the arches on the downtown Venice buildings in Touch of Evil. Also the mirrors at the end of The Lady From Shanghai, although these are much narrower vertical panes, and much closer together.\n\nThere are also vertical lines in the scene where Bernstein is interviewed by the reporter. The windows make strong verticals.\n\nArchitecture\n\nSome of the shots of the baroque architecture of Xanadu at the beginning remind one of the baroque basilica in Sergei Eisenstein's Qué viva Mexico! (1932).\n\nThe grillwork gates recur in other Welles films.\n\nThe model house in the snowball has a peaked roof. Peaked roofs recur in Welles films.\n\nMirrors\n\nCitizen Kane is notable for its complex mirror shots:\n\nThe curving mirror at the start, showing the nurse.\n\nA reflection in the newspaper window.\n\nBernstein reflected in his shiny desk top, while being interviewed.\n\nBest of all, the hall of mirrors.\n\nEverett Sloane runs into a mirror the Citizen Kane Trailer.\n\nCitizen Kane is often viewed as a stylistic precursor in film noir, both for its dazzling visual style, and its flashback structure. Mirrors and staircases are everywhere in film noir, and they are prominent in Citizen Kane too.\n\nOther kinds of multiple images of people occur in Citizen Kane, without involving mirrors. The political speech has the real Kane, in front of a giant campaign picture.\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons (1942) is considered by many Welles admirers to be his greatest film. I disagree. It is often visually creative, especially in elaborately compositions staged inside the Amberson mansion, and on the city streets. Its visual style makes the film very much worth watching. But otherwise, the film has many limitations.\n\nRealism\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons is the Welles work closest to ideals of Realism. It is based on a well-known Realist novel, by Booth Tarkington. Unlike the baroque Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons uses a straightforward linear approach to narration that is grounded in the Realist Novel. Many people in the arts view Realism as the highest goal of fiction, both in print and on film. If one thinks the approach of Realist Fiction is artistically superior to everything else, one will like The Magnificent Ambersons better than Welles' other work.\n\nMany, many people today who specialize in literature and film regard Realism as the ultimate. A vast network of academics, writing training programs, and critics centers on Realism. The idea that less realistic works might be better than anything realistic is anathema to them.\n\nIn my judgement Orson Welles' best film, among those publicly released so far, is The Immortal Story. It is less Realistic than The Magnificent Ambersons, but a much better film. The idea that The Immortal Story or The Story of Samba are better than a Realistic work like The Magnificent Ambersons is hard for many people in our culture to grasp. The Magnificent Ambersons is also much inferior to the wildly creative Citizen Kane.\n\nThe Cut Scenes\n\nTo be fair on the subject of The Magnificent Ambersons and Realism, the existing version of The Magnificent Ambersons has been drastically cut. The continuity and dialogue of Welles' original version survives, and is available in the book This Is Orson Welles by Welles, Peter Bogdanovich and Jonathan Rosenbaum. It makes fascinating reading. Everyone who watches The Magnificent Ambersons should read this. It makes for an incomparably better artistic experience.\n\nThe cut scenes mainly deal with two interlocking topics:\n\nThe careers and business dealings of the Amberson family members.\n\nThe development of the city of Indianapolis, its industry, pollution, smoke and grime, and its changing real estate.\n\nThe business investments of the Ambersons and the development of Indianapolis are interlinked.\n\nRealistic fiction often shows society and how it functions, including business and industry. This topic was well-developed in the original version of The Magnificent Ambersons.\n\nThe Major's dying speech about the Sun is also an important casualty of the cuts. This is a memorably poetic monologue. It comes right out of the original novel The Magnificent Ambersons (end of Chapter 30), with some tiny modifications.\n\nGender: \"Normalcy\" and Bigotry\n\nThe villain of The Magnificent Ambersons is the spoiled young heir George. George has been ruined by his upbringing by his doting mother.\n\nWe see George as a boy. He has long hair and wears a skirt! He is essentially dressed like a little girl. This is the Psychological Root of all of George's troubles. He has not been raised to have proper male gender. George will spend the rest of his life and The Magnificent Ambersons ruining his mother's life, his own life, the Morgan family, and everyone else he meets.\n\nGeorge will destroy all these people's chances to get married: the highest good. He is the implacable enemy of heterosexual fulfillment.\n\nGeorge is not the only villain in American cinema to be raised as a little girl. On can argue he is less villainous in fact than the Nazi spy and saboteur in Saboteur (Alfred Hitchcock, 1942) and the serial killer in While the City Sleeps (Fritz Lang, 1956). All of these men's childhood gender issues allegedly caused them to grow up into villains. Welles, Hitchcock and Lang are all great filmmakers. But their treatment of people with non-standard gender is just plain wrong. It expresses bigotry towards a minority. It tells lies about what this minority can accomplish. In real life, many people in the LGBTQ community make major contributions to society.\n\nGeorge violates gender norms in other ways:\n\nHe tells Lucy he wishes she had gone to a man's college, like him.\n\nGeorge imitates Aunt Fanny's high-pitched voice, with startling accuracy.\n\nGeorge has trouble steering his sleigh, and has an accident, spilling himself and Lucy. Vehicles are often phallic symbols, and driving them is often a symbol of sexual potency. George fails to succeed with this.\n\nThe original Welles version of The Magnificent Ambersons has George expelled from college, failing to graduate because he got in trouble with the faculty. Symbolically, this is George failing to enter the world of adult manhood, being rejected by adult men.\n\nGeorge absolutely refuses to take up any profession. All he wants to do is spend large sums of his family's money, and sail a yacht. This too marks him off from traditional American male roles.\n\nGeorge abandons his girlfriend Lucy, to whisk his mother away to Europe. This is seen as a failure of heterosexuality on his part.\n\nWelles' original version has a finale with Eugene telling about George and Lucy's reconciliation. This happens off-screen: we do not see it. Jonathan Rosenbaum's commentary in This Is Orson Welles talks insightfully about this finale as an off-trail, avant-garde ending that violates Hollywood tradition. One can also point out that a consequence of this scene is that we do not actually see George behaving in a heterosexual manner. A traditional Hollywood ending would have shown George proposing to Lucy at the end, behaving as a heterosexual hero. Welles refuses to do this. One suspects Welles thought this would undermine the portrait of George as anti-heterosexual built up during the film.\n\nAunt Fanny and Marriage\n\nAunt Fanny is a portrait of an unhappy \"old maid\". She is seen as having her life ruined, because she has been cheated out of romance, marriage and children. This is a common view in its era.\n\nBut it ignores the fact that in real life, many people are happier if they are not involved with heterosexual marriage. Some people prefer to be single. Others are part of the LGBTQ world, and want nothing to do with heterosexual marriage. There are indeed people like Aunt Fanny in real life, people who want heterosexual marriage but are unhappy because they failed to get it. But The Magnificent Ambersons gives no perspective, that real life also includes people who want no part of this institution.\n\nA Bad Boy\n\nGeorge Amberson gets involved with some appealing activities in his early stages. A deleted scene has him hanging out with other young men at a club, the Friends Of The Ace. These are a bunch of very young men, maybe late teenagers, who want to be Bad Boys. These guys are satisfyingly dressed as sports and low life wanna-be's, in soft caps and tie-less jackets. They are a bunch of innocents who want to think of themselves as Bad Boys. George hanging out with them recalls Prince Hal hanging out with Falstaff and his friends in Chimes at Midnight.\n\nThe club has the old pirate symbol on its door, a skull and cross bones, like Marlon Brando's motorcycle club in The Wild One (1954). Welles would later play pirate Long John Silver in the film Treasure Island (1972).\n\nGeorge can go right from this to a fancy ball. He looks splendid in white tie and tails, the ultimate dressed-up look for men. George is clearly enjoying all this swagger.\n\nAt the ball, George expresses a wish that his mother had not invited the young men from a club he used to head. It is unclear if this is the Friends Of The Ace. In any case, his disdain shows a lack of loyalty to his friends. Later, these young men will undergo another transformation, as they pay tribute at the funeral of George's father. These young men seem dignified and decent.\n\nGeorge's early scenes show him having potential. He has a youthful energy and rebelliousness that could be used to build a life. George is far from being any sort of role model, with his anti-work attitude. But his brio might have been turned in a socially useful direction.\n\nUnfortunately, he will later go off the rails with his mother, ruining everyone's lives.\n\nAutomobile Factory\n\nThere is a long take tracking shot in an automobile factory. As a piece of cinema, this is interesting.\n\nWe see a relatively small group of workers at the factory. Much of what they are doing seems more like craftsmanship than assembly line mass production. Their work resembles the personal craftsmanship that runs through other Welles movies.\n\nRunning through The Magnificent Ambersons is the rise of Eugene Morgan's company, Morgan Motors. At the start, we see Eugene with a barely functioning - but still successful - early horseless carriage. Near the end (in a deleted scene) we see Eugene in his office, with the company's sign outside his window. This recalls the rise of Kane's newspaper in the first half of Citizen Kane.\n\nThe factory in The Magnificent Ambersons is much smaller and simpler than those in real life. It's a Hollywood set, and as best I can tell, none too accurate. See three films showing real factories:\n\nTo get a better idea of what Henry Ford's pioneering auto factories were like, see the outstanding documentary 10 Buildings That Changed America (Dan Protess, 2013).\n\nA film widely available for free on the Internet Westinghouse Works, 1904 (Billy Bitzer, 1904); the section Panorama View, Street Car Motor Room is especially good.\n\nChronicle of a Summer (Jean Rouch, Edgar Morin, 1961), which has a brief section in a French factory: see the chapter \"Angelo's Day\" on the DVD.\n\nA modern day narrative film shot in real factories is The Ryan White Story (John Herzfeld, 1989), which takes place in Indiana, just like The Magnificent Ambersons.\n\nUnfortunately, many Americans today have rarely if ever been inside a factory, and know little about them. This is especially true of critics. I am not a blue collar worker either, but I did three computer projects in automotive factories in the 1980's, one in Anderson, Indiana, and the other two in Michigan, in Hamtramck and Livonia. One suspects this makes me one of the few critics who have both written on Welles and worked in an Indiana factory.\n\nMirrors\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons continues Welles' interest in complex mirror shots:\n\nJoseph Cotten uses are large mirror backed by a small mirror to try on clothes. This is an unusual combination. It leads to odd rhythmic effects, as he appears and disappears from the various mirrors.\n\nA half-dressed woman trying on clothes uses two mirrors set at right angles. Such a combination at right angles will return in The Immortal Story. The two mirrors in The Magnificent Ambersons are not as close together as those in The Immortal Story, and do not produce the complex effects seen so memorably in The Immortal Story.\n\nThere is a mirror at the barbershop.\n\nA mirror is in the bathroom.\n\nAnother mirror is at the ball.\n\nGeorge is reflected in a window, as he watches Eugene leave the house.\n\nA remarkable long take follows George and Lucy down a town street. As they pass by shops, the shop windows reflect the buildings across the street.\n\nThe cut scenes were full of characters reflected in mirrors.\n\nThe sleigh scene has the characters reflected in water on the ground.\n\nThe Movie Theater\n\nDavid Bordwell has a fascinating discussion of the movie theater, and the posters it displays. With more here.\n\nThe Bijou movie theater includes some favorite Welles geometric shapes:\n\nThe ticket booth is one of Welles' polyhedral glass containers with a woman inside (the cashier).\n\nThe lights outside are spheres.\n\nThe Bijou sign on the wall is a tall narrow hexagon.\n\nIt build compositions out of posters and signs.\n\nThe man on the movie poster of The Bugler of Battery B is another Welles \"man carrying a big long object\".\n\nTim Holt passes in front of movie poster showing father Jack Holt. This is related to Welles shots of \"multiple images of a person\". Such shots can show a person in front of images of either himself or other people.\n\nJourney Into Fear\n\nGenre: Spy films - and film noir\n\nJourney Into Fear (1943) is right at the beginning of the film noir era. Its brilliant visual style certainly anticipates some film noir features, such as extreme camera angles, overhead shots, and scenes of night and rain. It is not clear that it is a \"real\" film noir, like the huge numbers Hollywood made in 1944- 1951. Instead, it perhaps seems like a film on the road to the evolution of noir.\n\nFor one thing, it is a spy movie, not a crime thriller. Spy movies became fairly common in the early days of World War II, both in England and the United States. They form an early alternative tradition, one that probably played an influencing role on the rise of film noir. Like many spy movies, Journey Into Fear is set abroad. Also like many spy films, it involves a chase over a great swath of territory, unlike many film noirs, which often take place within a single US city.\n\nIt is not clear if there is \"alienation and obsession\" here, Alain Silver's key identifying characteristics of noir. The hero and the other characters are involved in the fight against Nazis. They are normal people, not people struggling with an emotional obsession. There is paranoia here: Nazi murderers are lurking around every corner. And the way one Nazi villain plays the same record over and over certainly has qualities of obsession. It also shows Welles' constant attempts to experiment with unusual sound.\n\nPolitics\n\nParts of the finale of this film take place after the characters have crossed over into Soviet territory. As far as I can tell, these scenes are ideologically neutral. They neither endorse nor condemn Communism. Welles always said that he was a Roosevelt Democrat, and I have never seen any evidence that his politics was ever radical or supportive of the extreme left. He seems to have been a consistent liberal Democrat throughout his career.\n\nMagic\n\nI liked the magician character, played by the delightful character actor Hans Conried. Welles was a gifted magician himself, who toured with his magic act on stage. So a magician character is probably dear to Welles' heart.\n\nIt's All True\n\nA Travel Documentary\n\nIt's All True (1942) is an unfinished film, shot by Orson Welles in Brazil. Much of the footage was edited into a restored version in 1993, which is widely available.\n\nIt's All True is a kind of film Welles will return to throughout his career. It is a documentary set in a fascinating foreign country, showing both the life of that country, and cultural events. These documentaries mix staged footage with actualities. They usually show activities Welles likes, and of which he strongly approves. Welles' personal attitude comes through emphatically.\n\nFour Men On a Raft: Politics\n\nThe bulk of It's All True recreates a real-life political protest. Four Men On a Raft shows the remarkable voyage of four fisherman down the coast of Brazil. The daring voyage was staged as a politic protest. It asked the government to extend retirement benefits to fishermen, who were not previously covered. Such benefits were just beginning in the United States: Social Security had just been signed into law in 1935, and still didn't cover many classes of workers, to whom it would later be extended.\n\nThe protest recalls Kane's newspaper crusading for the working man in Citizen Kane. It differs in that this protest is by working people themselves, rather than a plutocrat like Kane. Kane is told off by Jeb, that he is not going to like it when the \"working man\" organizes himself and forms labor unions and struggles for himself. So Four Men On a Raft goes beyond what is shown in Kane, and shows the contemporary world where workers stand up for themselves.\n\nThe finale of the raft journey shows other boats joining the raft when it arrives in Rio. These are full of sailors waving congratulations. This recalls Citizen Kane:\n\nIt is an assembly of ordinary people, like the big rally seen in the newsreel at the start of Citizen Kane. Earlier, the procession after the funeral in Four Men On a Raft was another such assembly.\n\nThe waving shows working men expressing an opinion, like the stage hands dismissing the heroine's opera singing in Citizen Kane.\n\nFour Men On a Raft: Motion\n\nAt the journey's end, the raft is raised up by cords, then turned around in air. It is a striking, joyous looking motion. It forms a celebratory end to the journey.\n\nThe Story of Samba: Color\n\nA segment of It's All True is in color: The Story of Samba shows the spectacular Carnival in Rio.\n\nOverall, most of the Carnival scenes are organized around the three Primary Colors: red, yellow and blue. This is an extremely popular color scheme, in both painting and film. Some shots include all three colors. Others include just two of the three.\n\nSome shots include a straightforward yellow. But the \"yellow\" in many shots is a metallic gold. Gold is popular in Carnival floats and costumes shown in The Story of Samba.\n\nSome shots have a bright, traditional blue. In other shots, we get a very light pale blue, almost white.\n\nSome shots are organized around a mixture of red and gold. This is a favorite Welles color scheme, that will return in later pictures.\n\nA memorable shot focuses on a young man in a shiny gold shirt.\n\nA few shots differ from the red-yellow-blue approach, by including people dressed in green.\n\nThe Story of Samba: Imagery\n\nSeveral parade floats evoke different regions of the Ancient World:\n\nAssyrian winged animals. A statue of a mythological winged animal is in Vienna.\n\nA dragon: perhaps Chinese.\n\nElaborate Greek columns, with complex ornamentation on top. A building with Greek columns is shown in Vienna.\n\nWelles in general did not seem to have too much interest in the Ancient World, or anything older than Shakespeare and Cervantes. Kane collects some old statues.\n\nA spectacular parade float shows the Sun. This recalls the memorable speech about the Sun, by the Major in The Magnificent Ambersons. A wheel spins behind the sun, creating a complex effect mixing a moving and fixed image. This involves the rotary motion that occasionally appears in Welles.\n\nSome traditional types of 19th Century military uniforms get spoofed in the Carnival. They are turned into brilliantly-colored exaggerations.\n\nA shot tends to show a group of people in related costumes. Then a second shot will show a different group of related costumes. And so on. The variety of spectacular costumes anticipates the opening of The Warriors (Walter Hill, 1979).\n\nA group of men are dressed as primitive tribesmen. They carry bows and arrows, anticipating the archers in the battle in Chimes at Midnight. Many of the parade groups mix men and women. This group seems mainly male, however.\n\nThe Story of Samba: Geometry\n\nOne of the parade floats contains a giant globe. It is one of several objects in Welles films shaped like a sphere. The black-and-white footage of the Rio Carnival has both a mirror-covered sphere, and a glitter-covered sphere on a parade float.\n\nWheels of some of the parade floats are painted in spectacular ways. One is a design full of peacock feathers, echoing Welles' interest in birds.\n\nArchitecture\n\nRio is shown in a spectacular panning shot, that slowly sweeps over much of the city. This is in the last stage of the raft journey.\n\nA Carnival shot has a fascinating Art Deco skyscraper in the background, with the word \"Mundo\" on top. This is one of Welles' shots showing building facades.\n\nThe Stranger\n\nThe Stranger (1946) is a film noir crime thriller, about the hunt for a Nazi war criminal.\n\nSocial Commentary\n\nThe Stranger is important as one of the first films to discuss the Holocaust.\n\nAt the end, we have a Welles tradition: a mass assembly of \"plain and ordinary people\", as they are called in the film. The democratic political values they represent are contrasted to those of the Nazi villain.\n\nThe drug store owner makes his customers serve themselves. It's a subject of humor, suggesting he is too lazy to get out of his chair. But it also symbolizes democracy, with everyone equal and waiting on themselves.\n\nRelationship to The Magnificent Ambersons\n\nThe Stranger has features that recall The Magnificent Ambersons. Both have:\n\nA small American town or city representing traditional American values and way of life.\n\nGroups of townspeople.\n\nCharacters walking along the town streets.\n\nAn upper crust family prominent in the town.\n\nA young man from the upper crust family as a major character.\n\nThe young man's male friends, a group of teens: dressed as low-lifes or \"sports\" in a club in The Magnificent Ambersons, upper crust athletes from a prep school in matching sweat shirts and pants in The Stranger.\n\nA party at the lead family's home with the townspeople as guest.\n\nA discussion of serious political issues at the dinner table: the influence of the auto in The Magnificent Ambersons, democratic ideas in various countries in The Stranger.\n\nSelf service by customers, with democratic undertones: pushing the streetcar in The Magnificent Ambersons, getting coffee at the drug store counter in The Stranger.\n\nAn attempted romantic relationship involving a woman from the family, that gets engulfed in failure.\n\nAndrogyny: little George Amberson in long hair and skirt in The Magnificent Ambersons, the angel statue could be male or female in The Stranger, as dialog points out.\n\nOutdoor scenes, including woods.\n\nSnow.\n\nSweet foods the characters eat.\n\nMachinery, and characters expert on these machines: the clock in The Stranger, the horseless carriage in The Magnificent Ambersons.\n\nPublic or mass transportation: a bus in The Stranger, the street car in The Magnificent Ambersons.\n\nBad characters who repent at the end: the Nazi in The Stranger, young George Amberson in a deleted scene in The Magnificent Ambersons.\n\nArchitecture\n\nWelles films often have elaborate staircases filled with balconies and landings. In The Stranger, the church has this form. It has a staircase, ladder, a choir loft, and higher lofts leading to the bell tower.\n\nThe docks at the start have multiple levels. Soon, we see ramps leading out of them.\n\nTwo locales have balconies, but without stairs shown on screen:\n\nThe gymnasium with its high mezzanine.\n\nThe house with its second story porch, where the heroine goes late in the film.\n\nRichard Long is posed on a stairway in the background of a shot. This interior room is all on one level, and we do not see very high up the stairway.\n\nMirrors\n\nThe Stranger continues Welles' interest in mirror shots:\n\nA villain being photographed is reflected in the camera lens: one of Welles' bravura images. This is also one of Welles' scenes of a work of art being created, in this case a photograph.\n\nThere are two mirrors in the drug store, one behind the owner's chair, one behind the lunch counter. These mirrors are simple and straightforward, but they do enhance the visual style of the pharmacy scenes\n\nWhen the three men look out of the doctor's window, we also see trees reflected in the window, superimposed on the three men.\n\nThe Lady From Shanghai\n\nRelationship to Touch of Evil\n\nMuch of the imagery in The Lady From Shanghai anticipates Welles' later film, Touch of Evil (1958). The earlier film is usually simpler; the ideas are developed in more complex style in the later film.\n\nBoth films are crime dramas, with California settings and location photography. Many early scenes in Lady take place in Central America and Mexico; these anticipate the border town that dominates the whole of the later film. The heroine is attacked by a group of young toughs here, in the opening New York sequence; more elaborate attacks occur in the later film. Men keep intruding themselves on the relationship between O'Hara and Hayworth here; more complex intrusions will occur in Touch of Evil.\n\nBoth films open with pedestrians walking by a slowly moving vehicle; the pace of the pedestrians and vehicle are counterpointed. Welles seemed to find the balance between the two kinds of movement interesting. The counterpoint is more elaborate in Touch of Evil. There is also the scene in Mr. Arkadin, where the hero and heroine dodge carts on a Spanish road - a similar handcart also shows up in the start of Touch of Evil. Later, in The Immortal Story, the sailor will run along side the slowly moving horse-drawn carriage carrying Mr. Clay. But, rather than counterpoint, the movement is completely synchronized: the hero keeps his hand on the carriage as it moves along.\n\nAfter the cab ride, O'Hara and Rita Hayworth walk along to the garage, in a long take sequence. This too reminds one of another male-female couple, Heston and Janet Leigh, in their long take walk at the start of Touch of Evil.\n\nOne kind of shot in Lady is the long take, in which people arrive and depart, entering and leaving the shot. Shots like this include the scene in which Grisby's body shows up on a stretcher; and the scene where Bannister and his wife are discussing the case before the trial. This kind of shot is used extensively in Touch of Evil. In Lady, the entrance is often used for shock value. For example, O'Hara thinks Grisby is alive; the sudden pulling of his corpse into the shot is terrible, shocking news for him. The staging, with its entrance, underscores the disruption of O'Hara's world. The entrance soon after of the lawyer Bannister suggests further problems for O'Hara: he is the most powerful figure in the film, and the one most likely to be O'Hara's antagonist. So his sudden arrival suggests a further wrenching of O'Hara's life.\n\nWelles weaves his camera through pillared walkways in the Mexico scenes. These too recall the complex opening shot of Touch of Evil, which uses the arched covered sidewalks of the town.\n\nThe large beach fire anticipates the scene of the burning car in Touch of Evil.\n\nAnother kind of shot: the dock scenes, which emphasize the vertical patterns formed by the docks. The patterns are hugely complex, and are further elaborated by the camera movement through them. These shots, too, recall those of the opening of Touch of Evil.\n\nAfter the fake killing, when O'Hara lets off his gun, the docks are still a setting, but they are photographed in a very different way.\n\nSailing\n\nThe yacht scenes and the beach picnic recall Welles' earlier It's All True (1942). In both films, scenes of boats in the water make complex, visually interesting compositions. The scenes near the rocky island, with people going ashore in small boats, anticipate the island scenes in Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura (1959-1960).\n\nWelles liked to set mystery films aboard ship: see the middle sequence of Journey Into Fear, and The Deep. There are also sailor heroes in The Immortal Story and Mr. Arkadin, which opens on the harbor in Naples, and which contains some boat scenes.\n\nSettings\n\nMuch of The Lady From Shanghai takes place at entertainment sites. These include:\n\nThe Central Park horse cab ride,\n\nThe yacht,\n\nThe picnic,\n\nThe Aquarium,\n\nThe dock side dance hall,\n\nThe Peking Opera\n\nThe Amusement Park.\n\nMany of these entertainments are fairly exotic. None of the lead characters seem to be having much fun, however; the sparkling settings contrast with the morose central characters, obsessed with their problems. Park scenes will later be central to F for Fake.\n\nThe brief scene in which O'Hara waits in the kitchen recalls the kitchen scenes in The Magnificent Ambersons. Both kitchens are quite elaborate and imposing.\n\nThe curving ramp at the parking garage at the beginning anticipates the ramps down which the characters slide in the fun house at the end.\n\nThe Aquarium\n\nThe Aquarium visit is one of Welles' visually elaborate set pieces. It recalls the zoo in Citizen Kane.\n\nSome of the shots look like process work, with the characters filmed in front of movie screens showing fish. The process work is good, and normally I do not emphasize or feel concerned about whether I am watching process work in a movie, or not. But Welles has apparently done something unusual with the process shots in The Lady From Shanghai. It looks as if films of small tropical fish have been shot, then blown up to enormous size. The fish behind the hero and heroine look like giant sea creatures, far bigger than such fish get in real life. The effect recalls the even bigger parade floats of a dragon and other creatures in It's All True.\n\nChinatown\n\nThe Chinatown exteriors show Welles' skill with cityscapes and architecture. Welles has photographed some of his favorite kinds of buildings:\n\nA view through the window of a Chinese language newspaper. The word \"HERALD\" is visible in reverse in the window. A page from the paper is pasted on the window.\n\nA pharmacy.\n\nA sign advertising \"Almond Cookies\": Welles likes deserts.\n\nA street light, seen from a high angle is one of the polyhedral glass containers seen in Welles films. It is part of a striking composition.\n\nReflection\n\nA beautiful composition shows both the hero and a pagoda reflected in a shop window near Chinatown.\n\nThe judge and his chess game are reflected in a window.\n\nThe glass-covered book case in the judge's office briefly reflects. This effect is subtle and not emphasized.\n\nPlot Construction: Adultery leads to Crime\n\nFrank Krutnik has linked The Lady From Shanghai to a series of film noirs centered around adultery, a series which began with Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity. See Krutnik's book In a Lonely Street: Film Noir, Genre, Masculinity (1991). I would like to comment on this classification. On the level of plot this is very true. The plots of Double Indemnity school movies fall into three parts:\n\nFirst the hero gets lured into an adulterous affair, against his better judgment.\n\nThen he gets involved in a scheme involving a perfect murder.\n\nFinally, the scheme unravels, and the hero has to struggle with persecution from the law, detectives and crooks, all stemming from his involvement in the crime.\n\nThese similarities in plot do not necessarily extend to style or thematic elements.\n\nThe Last Shots\n\nThe hero leaves the fun house, through a set of revolving bars. This is the kind of rotary motion Welles likes.\n\nThe last shot is a wonderful long take. It shows the deserted amusement park. The numerous signs help form the compositions.\n\nKing Lear\n\nKing Lear (1953) is a TV version of Shakespeare's play, with Welles acting in the title role. It was staged by famed British director Peter Brook, not by Welles. Welles is magnificent, and so are several of the other performers. Everyone should see this version of a great play with great acting.\n\nWelles Imagery: Geometry\n\nWelles didn't direct this film. And it is hard to see signs of imagery or techniques that appear in Welles-directed films.\n\nThe \"hovel\" where the characters take refuge in a storm is a windmill, in this version. The interior is full of giant wheels. This perhaps reflects Welles' interest in rotary motion. It is easy to imagine Welles suggesting such a setting to Brook. But it could just be a coincidence. Many famous films have mill settings: Vampyr (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1932), Foreign Correspondent (Alfred Hitchcock, 1940).\n\nCornwall's costume is full of triangles: a favorite Welles geometric figure. Handsome Scott Forbes looks spectacular in his costume. Forbes would soon be appearing in the TV series The Adventures of Jim Bowie (1956-1958). The finale of one of the best Bowie episodes The Beggar of New Orleans (Lewis R. Foster, 1957) has a Welles-like feel. Maybe Foster and/or Forbes were studying Welles.\n\nWelles Imagery: Drama\n\nThe scene of King Lear reveling with his knights anticipates those of Falstaff reveling with his followers at the inn in Chimes at Midnight. All of these scenes come right out of Shakespeare. But they also have a Wellesian feel. These scenes are full of both earthiness and male bonding.\n\nCordelia at the end becomes one of the kidnapped women in Welles.\n\nAccording to Simon Callow's notes for the DVD booklet, Welles nixed making an entrance in King Lear with two dogs: Brook's original plan. This makes a contrast with Welles' own films: a dog is prominent in The Stranger, and dogs also show up in Too Much Johnson, F for Fake. Callow humorously suggests that Welles didn't want to be upstaged by dogs. This is possible - but Welles also might have been frightened by having unpredictable animals in a live TV broadcast.\n\nPaganism\n\nKing Lear takes place in Ancient Britain in pagan times, before the introduction of Christianity. The dialogue of Shakespeare's play is full of references to the Roman gods. And unlike many Shakespeare plays in contemporary settings, there are few if any Christian references. All of this is part of Shakespeare's original play, and it is preserved in this film version.\n\nWelles' own films repeatedly refer to Christianity, and regularly have sympathetic references to Jews. But they only rarely discuss paganism:\n\nThe main reference to pagan religion in a Welles-directed film is very negative: in The Stranger, Nazis are linked to pagan rituals, and condemned.\n\nThe Greek myth of Narcissus is referred to in The Fountain of Youth, also somewhat negatively.\n\nThe world of King Lear is horrific, full of evil people running evil governments. Paganism is not shown to be the cause of this evil in King Lear. But it does indeed coexist with the worst sort of abuse.\n\nModernism\n\nKing Lear is full of dialogue by mad or eccentric characters. Much of this does not make literal sense. It anticipates modern poetry. At times watching King Lear, one is forcibly reminded of Allen Ginsberg's Howl (1955).\n\nWelles was rarely associated with literary modernism, or modernist poetry. However, in this same year 1953, he also made a record of Walt Whitman's poem Song of Myself. Welles had links to Kafka and Brecht.\n\nMr. Arkadin\n\nEric Ambler\n\nMr. Arkadin (1955) is a mystery thriller. Its plot is somewhat reminiscent of Eric Ambler's prose mystery thriller, The Mask of Dimitrios (1939) (also known as A Coffin for Dimitrios). Ambler was a famous spy novelist, and this was his best known book. Welles starred in the film version of Ambler's Journey Into Fear (1940), and most certainly would be familiar with his work. Welles and Ambler also shared a left-wing political orientation.\n\nLinks to Citizen Kane\n\nMr. Arkadin bears many resemblances to Citizen Kane:\n\nBoth investigate the life and past of a powerful millionaire, played by Orson Welles.\n\nA mystery is investigated: the meaning of Rosebud in Citizen Kane, the origin of Arkadin.\n\nThe sinister millionaire supported the fascists in the 1930's.\n\nThe millionaire lives in a huge castle.\n\nBoth have the hero torn between romancing a woman from a powerful family for her connections (the President's niece in Citizen Kane) or money (Arkadin's daughter), and a lower class, common acting, penniless but sincere nightclub singer.\n\nBlack musicians perform.\n\nSnow is a motif.\n\nCrates are the background of visually spectacular scenes.\n\nA night club phone booth has glass windows and door.\n\nRich adults have frivolous parties in which they behave in a silly manner.\n\nA disassembled bed frame is seen.\n\nPalms are a motif, as in other Welles films.\n\nMirror shots and reflection images are common.\n\nA building with smoke going up from a chimney is among the last shots of both films. It suggests a life in ruins. In Mr. Arkadin , this is in the background as the heroine drives away from the airport.\n\nThe Hero\n\nGuy Van Stratten (Robert Arden) is a wonderfully sleazy character. He is a sort of low life hustler, of a kind purely confined to the early and middle 1950's. He recalls Ralph Meeker's characterization of Mike Hammer in Kiss Me Deadly (Robert Aldrich, 1955). Both men are all dressed up in flashy, dressy, but somehow vulgar looking clothes. They seem like working class men's idea of cool. There is a sense of pathos in both men. They are working class types, out to try to get a little bit from a world dominated by rich monsters like Arkadin.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe arcade by the phone booth in Mexico is full of repeated arches. It recalls the store front arcades Welles would soon use in Touch of Evil, which also represent Mexico. Such arches run through The Immortal Story, and the bullfight episode of Around the World with Orson Welles.\n\nThe Christmas scenes seem almost like a parody of the party in The Magnificent Ambersons. We see the same high ceilinged rooms, the same decorations on every pillar and door frame, the same crowd of merry-making guests.\n\nThere are two spiral staircases.\n\nThe airport control tower is a polyhedral glass room. It shape anticipates the (much smaller) glass container holding Senta Berger in the magic act in Vienna. The Mr. Arkadin control tower also contains a woman, Raina.\n\nAn airport building contains that Welles favorite, a peaked roof.\n\nAnother airport building, in the finale, is in Art Deco style. Art Deco is not that common in Orson Welles. The building is striking geometric, including curves.\n\nCamera Movement\n\nThe Christmas party has the camera repeatedly moving back and forth between two rooms. The camera moves in both directions. In some ways, this is a path / reverse path series of movements, with the camera both moving on a path between the two rooms, then reversing itself to go back along the same path, but in a reverse direction.\n\nCostumes\n\nThe penitentes are a Spanish tradition that go back hundreds of years. I recently saw a painting by the great Dutch artist Gerard Ter Borch, Procession With Flagellants (circa 1636-1640), based on a trip the artist made to Spain as a teenager. The subjects wear the same conical hooded costumes as in Welles' film. Borch's subjects were apparently members of a sect known as The Brotherhood of the Cross.\n\nThe party with the Goya masks shows Welles' deep interest in painting. They recall the Day of the Dead masks worn in Sergei Eisenstein's Qué viva Mexico! (1932), a major influence on Welles' work. The flagellants in Eisenstein's film also anticipate Welles.\n\nThe necklace worn by Katina Paxinou is echoed by the blinds of the windows behind her. The two look almost exactly the same, and it is sort of a visual pun.\n\nAround the World with Orson Welles\n\nAround the World with Orson Welles (1955) is a series of 26-minute TV documentaries, made for British television. The episodes survive, and have been collected and released on DVD.\n\nWelles compared the series to home movies. This is a bit misleading. There are travelogue sections shot silent, edited together with narration by Welles - segments that do resemble in form the average person's vacation films of the era. But there are also extensive synch sound interviews with people Welles meets in his travels. These parts are a bit like a talk show, although they are generally set on locations where the person lives, rather than in a studio. In general, Welles resists \"voice of authority\" narration here, and tries to disguise his comments as elements of conversation with another character. Welles will also frequently show the camera, microphone, and the camera crews filming. It is part of the spectacle.\n\nSt.-Germain-des-Près: Personal Craftsmanship\n\nThe best of the series is the one dealing with an intellectual neighborhood of Paris, St.-Germain-des-Près. This features a long interview with Raymond Duncan, an eccentric American artist who was a long time resident. Duncan has a philosophy of doing everything for yourself, and is a craftsman who makes everything from his own printing press and type fonts, to the clothes he wears. It is hard not to compare this to Welles himself, and his do-it-yourself movies. And while Duncan's clothes are extremely unusual, Welles would spend much of his later years in costumes such as long capes and floppy bow ties, that were also both \"artistic\" and unique. Duncan's other major personal philosophy, never to imitate others or be a conformist, but always to stretch out in one's own direction, could also serve as a credo for Welles. So we are getting a philosophical statement of Welles' own life and beliefs here, as well. Duncan is an articulate man with a rich, resonant voice and a love of Shakespeare, also like Welles himself.\n\nDuncan's authenticity serves as the direct opposite of all the swindlers and forgers to come in F for Fake (1973). He is an artist who represents the antithesis of these painters who use their skills to deceive. Both Welles documentaries have an artist at their center, both take place at least partly in France, both make philosophical statements about authenticity, both include Welles' on-screen presence, both show celebrated French historical buildings and landmarks, both have real intelligentsia filmed, both show scenes of evening life and the French having after hours fun, both show French trains in stations from the outside. Picasso's drawings of bullfighters are discussed in a later episode of Around the World with Orson Welles; a story about Picasso is dramatized in F for Fake.\n\nThere is a party atmosphere to this film. Everyone from Art Buchwald's secretary to people on the street look as if they are enjoying being filmed.\n\nThe other episodes are not quite as good. Perhaps this simply reflects my own prejudices: films about artists such as St.-Germain-des-Près have always fascinated me. Plus it is hard to resist a portrait of Paris and its intellectual life.\n\nThe episode has \"intertitles\" in the form of brief statements being typed on a reporter's typewriter. These newspaper scenes recall Citizen Kane. They also give a silent movie feel to the episode.\n\nSt.-Germain-des-Près: The Pan up the newspaper building\n\nThe pan up the newspaper building, the real Herald-Tribune in Paris, is a \"Welles shot\": a moving camera work that creates a series of compositions-in-motion, based on the complex architecture of the building. In a small, much shorter way, it anticipates the famed moving camera opening of Touch of Evil, to be made the next year. Welles first pans upward, then executes a complex lateral turn. The opening camera movement in Touch of Evil also involves shifts of direction, also in 90 degree turns.\n\nSound poetry, Music, Dancing and Sports Movements\n\nIn St.-Germain-des-Près, Welles will have sound-poets give demos of \"letterisme\", a sound-based art movement of the era. In the later episode, Pays Basque II (La Pelote basque), we will hear the unique long-distance cries of Basque pigeon-netters, and the musical score-keeping announcements during games of pelote. This interest in unique forms of vocal expression perhaps derives from Welles' background in radio.\n\nWelles also includes much about music and dancing in both films. Both films celebrate cultures where intricate dance steps play a major role in ordinary people's entertainment.\n\nMadrid Bullfight and Pays Basque II (La Pelote basque) focus mainly on sports: bullfighting and pelote. Both sports emphasize physical dexterity, and complex movements of the whole body. In this they resemble the dancing that plays a role in both St.-Germain-des-Près and Pays Basque II.\n\nThese two sports episodes are the closest in the series to conventional travelogues or documentaries. Both are quite absorbing to watch, and both have a great deal of visual style. Neither quite reaches the level of St.-Germain-des-Près, but both make gripping viewing.\n\nMadrid Bullfight: Personal Craftsmanship\n\nThere is much less focus in Welles on actually fighting bulls, than in most films about bullfighting. Instead, Welles depicts the whole surrounding world of the bullfight, from the ranches where the bulls breed, to the architectural details of the arena. The bullfighters are seen not so much as killers, as representatives of a skilled, ancient tradition. This links them to Raymond Duncan, and to Welles himself. Such personal craftsmanship is part of Welles' ideal. Welles is deeply a man of the theater, a 2500 year old skilled profession, and has a \"neighborhood grocery store\" vision of himself.\n\nOne bullfighter's skill as a horseman is emphasized, in a dynamically filmed demonstration. This recalls Welles' character's skill with driving the carriage in The Lady From Shanghai.\n\nThe spectacular, Hispanic costumes worn by the matadors, even outside of the ring practicing their horsemanship, add glamour to the proceedings. One also thinks of Brazilian hero of It's All True and the Mexican policeman hero of Touch of Evil. Welles is definitely in touch with the tradition of the Latin Hero that was so important to films from Valentino onward.\n\nMadrid Bullfight has a brief autobiographical moment, in which it is revealed that Welles himself had been a picador in Spain during his youth. There will be a longer autobiographical sequence, in Welles' later documentary, F for Fake.\n\nMadrid Bullfight: Architecture\n\nThe arcades that are a Welles trademark show up in the bullring, in the title credits. There are two stories of corridors, with Welles' beloved rounded arches topping pillars at the top. The exterior of the bullring is also full of arched doorways, which form much of the background of the mid-section of the episode. Later, at the farm, we will see bulls driven through a rounded arch into a pen. At the bullring, there is a spectacular view of the cars and pedestrians outside the ring, shot through a scalloped arch. There are similar series of arches in the bullring of Sergei Eisenstein's Qué viva Mexico! (1932), which probably influenced this film.\n\nAn overhead shots of the bullpens is one of the most striking in this film - which is all deeply architectural. These bullpens are made up out of the regular, repeated units that recall the San Francisco docks in The Lady From Shanghai and the opening shot arcades in Touch of Evil. Like the docks, and unlike the arcades, the bullpens are mainly rectilinear. Even here, there are some unique narrow doors with arched tops, wide enough for humans but not bulls. Welles uses his trademark somewhat overhead angle to give us a broad, detailed view of the architecture.\n\nBefore the bullfight, Welles shows public spectators at galleries, watching bulls in a pen below. The galleries run above the pen, which forms a central courtyard below. This recalls the galleried courtyards in the Tamiroff episode of Mr. Arkadin. Welles loves such multi-storied structures. There are also multistoried arcades on the facade of the church that runs through Pays Basque II (La Pelote basque).\n\nCircular forms play a role as well. We see crowds gathering on curving outdoor staircases near the bullring. And the circular wall of the ring itself is frequently seen in shots.\n\nThe Tynans introduce the film standing in front of a wall filled with posters. There are also the notices all over the inside and exterior of Duncan's studio in St.-Germain-des-Près. This anticipates all the Chinese banners and signs that are so important to the compositions in The Immortal Story.\n\nChelsea Pensioners\n\nChelsea Pensioners and Pays Basque I (The Basque Countries) concentrate on interviews with ordinary people. The interviews, with Welles asking them about their lives, recall a bit the framework story of Citizen Kane. These interviews tend to the dull side in terms of content. And there is not much visual interest in such interviews, either. These inoffensive episodes constitute the low point of the series. By contrast, the 11-year-old in Pays Basque II (La Pelote basque) is a natural, offering terrific color commentary throughout.\n\nChelsea Pensioners deals with retirees in London. Welles presents them as examples of \"independent\" life, like Duncan in the other film. A call for Americans to resist conformity is issued in many of these episodes. While the series was shown on British TV, the audience addressed philosophically throughout seems to be modern day Americans. Perhaps Welles hoped to sell the show to American TV networks. Welles would move back to the US in October 1955, shortly after completing these films.\n\nThe opening of Chelsea Pensioners is shot right across from the stage door of a famed London musical hall, the Hawley Empire. Welles had shot Moby Dick - Rehearsed (1955) there, and he mentions that he had shot \"a movie\" in this celebrated venue.\n\nThe Basque episodes\n\nFor obscure reasons, Welles has the same opening and closing sequences in the two Basque episodes, Pays Basque I (The Basque Countries) and Pays Basque II (La Pelote basque). The shared sequences are very good. Aside from this, part I is mainly a series of interviews, and not very interesting, whereas part II is a beautifully filmed documentary about life, sports and dance in the region.\n\nBoth Basque episodes end with the same sequence: a festival with a metallic bull shooting off fireworks, recalling a similar artificial-bull-with-fireworks in Sergei Eisenstein's Qué viva Mexico! (1932). These sequences recall the Chinatown processions near the end of The Lady From Shanghai.\n\nBorders. The Basque episodes open right on the border of France and Spain. Later, there is a sequence of the border being opened to celebrate the holiday of Pentecost. This recalls the border elements of Journey Into Fear and Touch of Evil. The footbridge that links the two sides anticipates the bridge finale of Touch of Evil. In both films, the bridges are full of pedestrians.\n\nStorytelling. Welles' brief discussion of storytelling at the end, invoking Basque traditions, anticipates in a small way the subject matter of The Immortal Story.\n\nChildhood. Pays Basque II (La Pelote basque) contains the most explicit look at childhood in Welles' cinema. The 11-year old hero is depicted as having an ideal existence, getting to take part in traditional sports, music and travel. This echoes the re-creation of traditional US Midwestern lifestyles and amusements that opens The Magnificent Ambersons. It also recalls the earliest scenes of Kane's life. The boy here is privileged over Welles, sitting above him in trees or on walls, and giving Welles the inside scoop on Basque traditions. Welles here reflects other 1950's movies, especially Westerns, which often included boy characters with whom youthful viewers could identify.\n\nThe Fountain of Youth\n\nA TV Pilot\n\nThe Fountain of Youth (filmed 1956, broadcast 1958) is a half-hour TV pilot, for a series that was never produced. The comedy-drama includes science fiction elements, along with much sophisticated comedy.\n\nThe Fountain of Youth is based a short story by John Collier, \"Youth from Vienna\". At the end, narrator Welles announces next week's show in the proposed series, \"Green Thoughts\", based on another short story by Collier, about an orchid. Unfortunately, neither \"Green Thoughts\" nor any other episodes were actually filmed.\n\nAn Experimental Film: Mixing Stills and Moving Images\n\nThe Fountain of Youth uses experimental filming techniques. It mixes still photographs of the actors and drama, with conventional moving images.\n\nBreakdown (Alfred Hitchcock, made for TV, 1955) was filmed as a prologue with motion, and a main film entirely as a series of still photographs. Breakdown is a grim suspense thriller, while The Fountain of Youth is a giddy comedy. The way that The Fountain of Youth moves back-and-forth between stills and moving images, without any apparent rhyme or reason other than the director's whim, helps create the giddy, anything goes feeling of the film. By contrast, the strict use of pure stills in most of Breakdown likely underscores its solemn nature.\n\nBoth films anticipate La Jetée (Chris Marker, 1962), which is mainly filmed with stills, together"
