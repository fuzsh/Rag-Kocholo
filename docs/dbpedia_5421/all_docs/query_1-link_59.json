        "text": "Pictures at a Revolution\n\nBy Mark Harris,\n\nFrom my list on 1960s Hollywood.\n\nBy Jon Lewis Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have been teaching and writing about post-WWII American film for over thirty years now, with a particular passion for (behind the scenes) Hollywood history. Road Trip to Nowhere follows up on a new sort of movie industry history I introduced in my 2017 book on 1950s Los Angeles, Hard-Boiled Hollywood. Both books focus on actors, writers, producers, and directors who don’t quite make it—aspirants and would-be players kicked to the side of the road, so to speak, and others who for reasons we may or may not understand just walked away from the modern American dream life of stardom and celebrity.\n\nJon's book list on 1960s Hollywood\n\nWhy did Jon love this book?\n\nHarris focuses on Oscar night 1968 as four of the five films nominated for Best Picture evinced Hollywood’s reluctant affirmation of the American counterculture. These “pictures at a revolution,” as he terms them—Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, and the Oscar winnerIn the Heat of the Night—signaled a necessary industry re-think, away from bloated old-Hollywood blockbusters (like Dr. Dolittle, the fifth nominee) and towards something more politically savvy and more hip. Harris does well to chronicle the backstage/behind-the-scenes histories of all five of these films.\n\nBy Mark Harris,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Pictures at a Revolution as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“Pictures at a Revolution is probably one of the best books I've ever read in my life.” —Quentin Tarantino\n\nThe New York Times bestseller that follows the making of five films at a pivotal time in Hollywood history\n\nIn the mid-1960s, westerns, war movies, and blockbuster musicals like Mary Poppins swept the box office. The Hollywood studio system was astonishingly lucrative for the few who dominated the business. That is, until the tastes of American moviegoers radically- and unexpectedly-changed. By the Oscar ceremonies of 1968, a cultural revolution had hit Hollywood with the force of a tsunami, and films like…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Devil's Candy\n\nBy Julie Salamon,\n\nFrom my list on behind the scenes in Hollywood.\n\nBy Ben Fritz Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve spent most of my 20-year career as a professional journalist covering the entertainment industry, and I find it endlessly fascinating. As is probably true for you if you’re reading this, I love movies and TV shows. As a curious person, I always want to know why. Why did this movie get made at this time with these people? If you want to know the answer, you’ve got to understand the business. Hollywood is such an interesting business, full of big personalities trying to manage corporate pressure and creative egos and to balance their need to make a profit with their desire to make great art.\n\nBen's book list on behind the scenes in Hollywood\n\nWhy did Ben love this book?\n\nThe perfect companion to Final Cut from a radically different perspective. Salamon is a journalist who was given extraordinary access by director Brian De Palma during the making of The Bonfire of the Vanities, which, like Heaven’s Gate, turned out to be an infamous flop.\n\nSalamon was on set constantly and shows just how difficult it was for De Palma to manage a massive production and try to keep his vision intact; the difficulty of managing stars like Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, and Melanie Griffith; and the pressure studios put on filmmakers as budgets escalate and the desperation to release a hit skyrockets.\n\nBy Julie Salamon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Devil's Candy as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen Brian De Palma agreed to allow Julie Salamon unlimited access to the film production of Tom Wolfe's best-selling book The Bonfire of the Vanities , both director and journalist must have felt like they were on to something big. How could it lose? But instead Salamon got a front-row seat at the Hollywood disaster of the decade. She shadowed the film from its early stages through the last of the eviscerating reviews, and met everyone from the actors to the technicians to the studio executives. They'd all signed on for a blockbuster, but there was a sense of impending…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Big Goodbye\n\nBy Sam Wasson,\n\nFrom my list on Hollywood history.\n\nBy Reid Mitenbuler Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nNot only am I fascinated by old Hollywood history, I’m also interested in the creative processes that produce great art. Everyone approaches their craft a little differently, and it’s always illuminating to discover how different people do what they do. In my own work, I like to explore how creative people come to their Eureka! moments, and hope that I’ll be able to learn something from their experiences.\n\nReid's book list on Hollywood history\n\nWhy did Reid love this book?\n\nSam Wasson is simply a good writer, crafting tight narratives that help this book read like a novel. The best part of this book is its examination of the creative process: in order for Chinatown to get made the way it did, a million (maybe two million) things needed to align in just the right way. The movie easily could have failed, but Wasson shows how the contributions of its many collaborators saved it.\n\nBy Sam Wasson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Big Goodbye as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSight & Sound's #1 Film Book of 2020\n\nChinatown is the Holy Grail of 1970s cinema. Its ending is the most notorious in American film and its closing line of dialogue the most haunting. Here for the first time is the incredible true story of its making. In Sam Wasson's telling, it becomes the defining story of its most colorful characters. Here is Jack Nicholson at the height of his powers, embarking on his great, doomed love affair with Anjelica Huston. Here is director Roman Polanski, both predator and prey, haunted by the savage murder of his wife, returning to…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Jaws Log\n\nBy Carl Gottlieb,\n\nFrom my list on what Hollywood is really like.\n\nBy Carleton Eastlake Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nHaving been a Hollywood writer for thirty years, and now written a novel that although satirical still accurately describes the creation of a TV series, I’ve long been amazed at how many Hollywood stories – including films made in Hollywood – offer fantasies that have even less to do with the reality of love and work in film and television than Game of Thrones does with the real Middle Ages. I’ve written fantasy myself, but for people fascinated by Hollywood, or who want to work in film and TV, there’s a reason too to read books that capture the reality, especially when like the books listed here, they do so astonishingly well.\n\nCarleton's book list on what Hollywood is really like\n\nWhy did Carleton love this book?\n\nIn my book club I’m known as Second Carl, since Carl Gottlieb has been a member far longer than I. In fact, I was still a lawyer in Washington, D.C. secretly dreaming about Hollywood but never suspecting I’d someday myself work on a Spielberg TV series, when I read this short, fast, now revered account of the filming of Spielberg’s breakout film. It proved to be a deeply accurate and comprehensive description – and warning – about what life and work on location and in Hollywood itself would be like. It’s also so engagingly readable and relevant, a Broadway musical based on the book is in tryouts as I write these words.\n\nBy Carl Gottlieb,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Jaws Log as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWinner of 3 Oscars [registered] and the highest grossing film of its time, \"Jaws\" was a phenomenon, and this is the only book on how 26-year-old Steven Spielberg transformed Peter Benchley's best-selling novel into the classic film it became. Hired by Spielberg as a screenwriter to work with him on the set while the movie was being made, Carl Gottlieb, and actor and writer, was there throughout the production that starred Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss. After filming was over, with Spielberg's cooperation, Gottlieb chronicled the extraordinary year-long adventure in \"The Jaws Log\", which was first published in…\n\nPreview\n\nThe World Remade\n\nBy G.J. Meyer,\n\nFrom my list on war and collective memory.\n\nBy Elliot Y. Neaman Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a Professor of modern European history at the University of San Francisco. I have written or co-edited three major books and many articles and reviews, as well as serving as a correspondent for a German newspaper. My areas of expertise are intellectual, political, military, and cultural history. I also work on the history of espionage and served as a consultant to the CIA on my last book about student radicals in Germany.\n\nElliot's book list on war and collective memory\n\nWhy did Elliot love this book?\n\nI was riveted by this revisionist history of how America got into World War I and changed American society and politics. He shows how much of American collective memory about why WWI was fought, and the perception of Germany in America was fashioned, to a large extent, by British propaganda. He also shows why Germany had no choice but to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare, which eventually brought the United States into the war.\n\nHad the British modified the naval blockade on Germany, which starved the German population in a horrific manner, the United States might never have become involved. But Great Britain was determined to make sure Germany would never again pose a threat to its colonial overseas empire. President Wilson at first understood that American neutrality was the means by which he could have brokered peace, but British and French recalcitrance, and eventually the deaths of relatively few…\n\nBy G.J. Meyer,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The World Remade as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA bracing, indispensable account of America’s epoch-defining involvement in the Great War, rich with fresh insights into the key issues, events, and personalities of the period\n\nAfter years of bitter debate, the United States declared war on Imperial Germany on April 6, 1917, plunging the country into the savage European conflict that would redraw the map of the continent—and the globe. The World Remade is an engrossing chronicle of America’s pivotal, still controversial intervention into World War I, encompassing the tumultuous politics and towering historical figures that defined the era and forged the future. When it declared war, the United…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Prize\n\nBy Daniel Yergin,\n\nFrom my list on challenge what you thought you knew about history.\n\nBy Timothy C. Winegard Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a New York Times bestselling author of six books, including The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator. My works have been published globally in more than fifteen languages. I hold a PhD from the University of Oxford, served as an officer in the Canadian and British Armies, and have appeared in numerous documentaries, television programs, and podcasts. I am an associate professor of history (and, as a true Canadian, head coach of the hockey team) at Colorado Mesa University.\n\nTimothy's book list on challenge what you thought you knew about history\n\nWhy did Timothy love this book?\n\nThere are a handful of books that, upon finishing, I remark with absolute admiration, “I wish I would have written that.” This is one of these select, extraordinary books. Yergin presents an eye-opening, at times uncomfortably shocking, journey through petroleum geopolitics, challenging conventional notions about historical events, the modern world order, and how it came to pass.\n\nBy Daniel Yergin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Prize as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWritten by the author of \"Shattered Peace\" and \"Energy Future\", this book brings to life the tycoons, wildcatters, monopolists, regulators, presidents, generals and sheiks whose struggle for oil has shaken the world economy, dictated the outcome of wars, transformed the destiny of Britain and the world and profoundly changed all our lives. Beginning with the first oil well of the 1850s and continuing up to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, it is a story of greed, gumption nad ingenuity, all in pursuit of \"the prize\" - worldwide economic, military and political mastery through the control of oil. The book includes…\n\nPreview\n\nThe War Poems Of Wilfred Owen\n\nBy Wilfred Owen, Jon Stallworthy (editor),\n\nFrom my list on futility of War since Helen of Troy.\n\nBy Jacqueline Jeynes Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nThe greatest influence on my interest in the theme of war is, of course, my father. Only later, when I became involved with the FEPOW groups, I heard the real stories of what happened to them as individuals, as well as the poor treatment of families back home in Britain. My book is based on their stories. However, this interest also spread to other areas as I read about the history of war while studying literature and, later, the work of various official War Artists. In all of it, the despair and hopelessness comes through, definitely not any sense of the ‘glory’.\n\nJacqueline's book list on futility of War since Helen of Troy\n\nWhy did Jacqueline love this book?\n\nAs part of my English Literature studies, I was instantly taken by the desperation and reality of life for these very young men fighting in the trenches during WWI.\n\nEven if poetry is not your preferred style, for anyone interested in military history, Owen’s poems describe the stark fear and appalling conditions for the soldiers and the clear incompetence of those in charge.\n\nThey are hauntingly vivid in his descriptions of their existence and, of course, the inhumanity of war. It is particularly sad that he died as hostilities ended.\n\nBy Wilfred Owen, Jon Stallworthy (editor),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The War Poems Of Wilfred Owen as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'Orpheus, the pagan saint of poets, went through hell and came back singing. In twentieth-century mythology, the singer wears a steel helmet and makes his descent \"down some profound dull tunnel\" in the stinking mud of the Western Front. For most readers of English poetry, the face under that helmet is that of Wilfred Owen.' Professor Jon Stallworthy, from his Introduction.\n\nWhen Wilfred Owen was killed in the days before the Armistice in 1918, he left behind a shattering, truthful and indelible record of a soldier's experience of the First World War. His greatest war poetry has been collected, edited…\n\nPreview\n\nNo Man's Land\n\nBy John Toland,\n\nFrom my list on World War I and America's role in it.\n\nBy Stephen L. Harris Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nReading my great uncle’s war letters home to Kansas City and seeing his artwork—he was a magazine illustrator in civilian life and then editor of the 27th Empire Division’s magazine, Gas Attack—I knew, as a writer, I had to put his story down on paper. What his National Guard regiment did, the 107th, simply blew me away. From writing about what the 107th endured in the Great War, I was carried away to tackle the all-black 369th Regiment, famously known as Harlem’s Hell Fighters. I then had to tell the story of New York City’s most famous regiment, the Fighting 69th. My trilogy of New York’s National Guard in the war is now done.\n\nStephen's book list on World War I and America's role in it\n\nWhy did Stephen love this book?\n\nPulitzer-Prize winning author Toland, in a riveting style, gives us a detailed account of what it was like on the Western Front in 1918 for the British and French armies, their leaders and their soldiers, but more importantly for America, its crucial role and for its men, from President Wilson and General Pershing down to the mud-splattered private on the frontlines. He also delves into the Russia Revolution. When you finish this book, you get a full understanding of the war and what it was like during that last year.\n\nBy John Toland,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked No Man's Land as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom freezing infantrymen huddled in bloodied trenches on the front lines to intricate political maneuvering and tense strategy sessions in European capitals, noted historian John Toland tells of the unforgettable final year of the First World War. As 1918 opened, the Allies and Central Powers remained locked in a desperate, bloody stalemate, despite the deaths of millions of soldiers over the previous three and a half years. The arrival of the Americans \"over there\" by the middle of the year turned the tide of war, resulting in an Allied victory in November. In these pages participants on both sides, from…\n\nPreview\n\nCharlotte Sometimes\n\nBy Penelope Farmer,\n\nWhy did Carole love this book?\n\nI love time travel stories. Stories where protagonists swap lives with other people are so much about acculturation and “passing.” Dislocation, confusion, etc. aside, the main issue is to not be found out. In the story, Charlotte is not always herself. Sometimes she’s in a boarding school in the fifties and sometimes she’s back in time at the same boarding school in the First World War. So we’re dealing with a borrowed life here. The life that Charlotte sometimes borrows belongs to Clare. Charlotte has very little in common with Clare. And even less knowledge of how establishments like this worked back in the day. Some quick learning and imitative skills are needed if she is not to be caught. For instance, she has to deduce what others expect and require of her. But she also has to not lose herself in all this pretense.\n\nWhen I came to the…\n\nBy Penelope Farmer,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Charlotte Sometimes as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 11, 12, 13, and 14.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIt is Charlotte's first night at boarding school, and as she's settling down to sleep, she sees the corner of the new building from her window.\n\nBut when she wakes up, instead of the building there is a huge, dark cedar tree, and the girl in the next bed is not the girl who slept there last night.\n\nSomehow, Charlotte has slipped back forty years to 1918 and has swapped places with a girl called Clare.\n\nCharlotte and Clare swap places ever night until one day Charlotte becomes trapped in 1918 and must find a way to return to her…\n\nPreview"
