        "meta_description": "Early film theorist Ricciotto Canudo equated cinema with music because of the Seventh Art’s inherent plasticity; in the 21st century, plasticity extends to the soundtrack. In this article, I explore the fusion of cinema with the musical genre of opera. By considering that film is a performative medium, beyond the actors’ agency, I confirm music’s importance in it as part of the structure and style of opera. Unlike Franco Zeffirelli’s adaptation of Verdi’s opera Otello, Orson Welles’s adaptation of William Shakespeare’s play conforms to Jacques Aumont’s concept of “operatic film” in that it engenders a coexistence of the verbal and the non-verbal, balancing drama and music with a performative intention. However, this film is so musicalized and operatically rendered, especially through its soundtrack, that it exceeds Aumont’s intention and becomes what I call a “cinematic opera”: a film that is operatic in its artificial and ritualistic nature as well as in its well-woven soundtrack of music, sound effects and voice working together in a common musicalized pattern.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n4Pushing the argument further, I wish to correlate cinema with opera. My aim is to gather how an operatic film can fulfill Canudo’s desired prophecy of a superior musical film, one which is “an abstraction, like the written Tragedy, like the Drama one reads” […], “one work which is an absolute spiritualization: an absolute Art” (65). However, I will not focus on cinematic adaptations of pre-existing operas, a transmedial process consisting of “repeated mediation of equivalent sensory configurations by another technical medium” (Elleström, Media Transformation 14). I will turn toward the phenomenon of “media combination” (Rajewsky 55) but not to realize how cinema and opera interact and interfere with one another, for contrary to Rajewsky’s and Elleström’s view I am not interested in the borders of the arts but in the exact opposite: their fusion or symbiosis. I aim to explain how a film can be considered an opera through its melodramatic stylization and soundtrack, being composed like an opera without really being one.\n\n1. Opera and cinema in between action and feeling\n\n5Opera emerged, in 17th century Italy, from the combination of a story contained in the libretto and of music ingrained in the musical score. This duality charges it with artistic alterity that makes it – literally – non-theatre, yet performative, and non-music, yet orchestral and lyrical. Opera is, then, a benign chimera much revered as high culture, but not necessarily understood for its versatility. Jacques Aumont, however, claims that music takes the upper hand in this mixture of action and pure emotion. Opera was born, he writes, as “musical drama” (154). It is “impure”, but by conveying feelings and emotions through action it escapes the strictly verbal and is closer to music than anything else, which endows it with a redemptive power (154). The same had been stated by the composer Salieri in 1786 – “Prima la musica e poi le parole” (“First the music and then the words”) – claiming an artistic hierarchy in which music came first even though chronologically it was the last (Carter).\n\n6According to Tim Carter, defining a work of opera is a problematic affair, due to the many subvarieties of the genre. The entry “opera” in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians contains 69 subdivisions, with expressions in different languages, subgenres (opera seria and opéra comique), and other nuances, not to mention a strong relationship with theatre (musical theatre), and drama (melodramma, the Italian expression par excellence, or drame lyrique and tragédie en musique, the French equivalents) (Carter 3). According to the New Grove Dictionary, the common denominator of all types of opera is “a drama in which the actors sing throughout” (3). However, not all operas are entirely sung, such as Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute, 1791), which immediately invalidates this definition. A small change such as “a drama in which the actors sing some or all of their parts” is not good enough, because musicals match this definition, and they are not operas either (Carter 3).\n\n[…] anything analyzed deeply enough will turn out to be musical. Of course, this is profoundly true of motion pictures. The pictures have movement; movies move and there’s movement from one picture to another. There’s a rhythmic structuring to that, there’s counterpoint, harmony, and dissonance. A film is never right until it’s right musically. And this moviola, this filmmaker’s tool, it’s a kind of musical instrument. It’s here that other filmmaking instruments are tuned and finally orchestrated.\n\n13Welles had full control over the editing of Othello, just like for Citizen Kane, despite the chaotic and distressing production that lasted three years. For that reason, Othello is considered by André Bazin “as one of Welles’s most characteristic and personal” films (74, my translation). Welles himself considers the editing room the only place where the director is potentially a true artist (Bazin 75) and, fittingly, he draws a musical metaphor: “As far as I am concerned, the celluloid strip is played like a musical score and that execution is determined by the editing just like a conductor will interpret a musical excerpt in rubato, another one will play it very drily and academically, a third one very romantically, etc.” (Bazin 75–76, my translation).\n\n14Shakespeare’s character and poetry are very well integrated into the visual rhythm of Welles’s film (Jorgens 122); its graphic power “stand[s] comparison with Shakespeare’s poetic images, in which the visual imagery compensates for the inevitable loss of complexity of dramatic voltage” (Jorgens 146). The sound is equally expressive, despite the poor-quality equipment used during the shooting and the originally faulty post-synchronization. This lack was compensated by the creative use of music and sound effects. For example, several instruments were used with clearly semantic purposes, rendering the atmosphere even more claustrophobic and menacing: sharp piano keys, exotic instruments such as a spinetta and a harmonium, forty mandolins played at an increasingly faster pace in the murder scene of Roderigo, several choruses throughout the film, louder sounds in the scenes set in Cyprus. All in all, the soundtrack is raw but filled with “specific performances, textures, and tonalities” (Rosenbaum 172). Additionally, Francesco Lavagnino’s musical score and Welles’s sound effects permeate the entire film, contrary to what usually happens in the classical Hollywood movie tradition in which the score is secondary to the dialogue and the music is simply made to mask technical imperfections and punctuate the narrative (even when anticipating actions or providing ironic commentary).\n\n15There is no doubt in Welles’s mind that his film Othello is musical. It rightly is, but – using his own famous boutade of Vérités et mensonges (F for Fake, 1973) against him – could it be art (in this case, opera)? To this question Welles himself provides no answer, but the answer could nonetheless be affirmative. I argue that Orson Welles’s Othello is indeed operatic to the point of becoming an opera film as Aumont conceives of it and that it goes actually further than that to become a full-fledged cinematic opera.\n\n16In what follows I will analyse the film, using Welles’s original version, not the European version from which Criterium produced its DVD. My choice is simple: although both versions can be construed as cinematic operas, Welles’s original version is a fuller operatic experience. True, the remastered film has cleaner and more audible dialogues and the technical sound quality is much improved, but that emphasis on the dialogue track, following the Hollywood credo, has reduced the importance of the music and its sensorial impact, as well as the importance and the audibility of most of the sound effects and of the ambient sound. Thus, the better-quality version of the film is devoid of the rich polyphonic textural and semiotic import the soundtrack has in Welles’s original version, in which the low-quality dialogue, by fusing with the rest of the soundtrack, is more musical and hence, in my view, “operatic”.\n\n17My analysis will proceed in two stages, although in practice the two aspects that they refer to are deeply interconnected in the film. I will operate this division for clarity’s sake. The first stage concerns the film’s style and structure while the second pertains to the musicalization of the drama. My reason is simple: despite maintaining the full title of Shakespeare’s play, Welles’s film is operatic because it is foremost a stylistic audio-visual work with a specific semantic purpose; yet it is also a musical work. Although the main actors do not sing, singing does exist in the several choruses that are featured throughout the film and the protagonists’ voices are textured, often velvety. The use of music and effects is not consonant with mere punctuation or narrative illustration as in the Hollywood paradigm; music and effects in Welles’s Othello work as an operatic musical score conveying as much, if not more, meaning than Shakespeare’s dialogue itself.\n\n2. Othello as Cinematic Opera: Stylization and Structure\n\n19Joseph McBride is deeply critical of Welles’s adaptation on the basis that it removes the psychological subtleties of Othello’s mounting jealousy, which is reduced to matter of fact, and dismisses Iago’s intrigues. “[W]ith [Iago’s] deliberations scanted”, he says, “the film teeters wildly into unrestrained grand opera […]. Othello presents a mere spectacle of frenzy and disintegration, fascinating as spectacle but alienating as drama” (McBride 123). He considers Welles’s performance to be “anesthetized”, devoid of tragic greatness. Yet, Welles himself, in conversation with Peter Bogdanovich, admits that he was attempting “tragedy within the design of melodrama”, which is why his Othello was a “morally diseased” character, compelled by his own nature, a villain (Bogdanovich 235), contrary to the Aristotelian notion of tragedy, according to which the hero’s downfall is the result of a flaw that prompts human error.\n\n22In any event, the operatic world is artificial, requiring from the audience a “suspension of disbelief”. The plots “usually stretch our sense of reality beyond all reasonable limits” (Schrœder 237). All situational incongruities and emotional excesses must momentarily be dismissed as such for the sake, and throughout the duration, of the spectacle. Like the Italian operas of the 19th century, Welles’s Othello is fuelled by questions of honour and loyalty (Desdemona’s, Iago’s, Cassio’s) on the one hand, and betrayal and revenge (Iago’s and Othello’s), on the other. “Honesty” is the key word, whose meaning gets contaminated and played with to the point of utter reversal. Desdemona’s “honesty (i.e., sexual purity) is questioned, but Iago’s, a self-serving predator, never is (Othello refers to him often as “Honest Iago”). The seed of the drama is, therefore, a lack of correct perception, a very cinematic theme, and – in its reflexivity – a very operatic one too. According to Schroeder, the medium of opera itself suspends reality (236), because we do not go about singing and dancing in our everyday life.\n\n23Welles’s mise-en-scène in Othello is extremely stylized, with image and sound working together as absolute equals. The film cannot be decoded through the image and dialogues alone; the solution lies in the full soundtrack that acts as a structural pattern as it does in opera. The film starts with the equivalent of an overture, a “distinct, self-contained, introductory musical entity”, preceding the opening credits (Melvin 404). It is a musical statement on an aesthetic as well as thematic level, the “overblown” quality of its musicality serving to “install a heightened sense of melodrama from the outset” (Melvin 407), presenting Othello and Desdemona as a tragic couple.\n\n24A black screen opens laterally in an optical effect akin to that of a theatre curtain parting. It reveals the upside-down face of Othello in close-up, his black skin gleaming under a key light projector. The cinematic chiaroscuro, present from the start and used throughout the film, not only spells mystery and foul play; it also respects the semantic contrast of black and white contained in the play. Indeed, the cultural and ethnic difference between the Moor Othello and his pale-skinned and blonde Venetian wife Desdemona is matched by their own moral disposition and actions as the story develops: while Othello’s soul grows increasingly darker Desdemona professes her fair heart even more. However, in the film, this opposition is Manichean and thus operatic, reinforcing the black-and-white cinematography which invades the screen and relates to much more than just Othello’s and Desdemona’s moral values as it happens in the play.\n\n3. Othello’s Musicality: Opera as Soundtrack\n\n27The story itself begins with the main credits, which take place only after the opening sequence. We see the full title of Shakespeare’s play on canonically old paper – a cinematic stereotype of period films – followed by a written description of Othello’s and Desdemona’s falling in love. Non-synchronously with it, we hear Welles’s own voice-over repeating the same information as a non-diegetic narrator, much like an operatic prologue (sometimes used to explain the work’s context and setting). In the remastered European version of the film, Welles voices the credits in a Sacha Guitry-like manner over realistic images of shots taken in the Venetian canals. In the musicalized version that interests me here, the operatic supersedes the poetic, so much so that the reference to the play, edited in by way of dissolves resembling musical transitions, is mellower than the hard cuts of the European version. It also adds a high-culture status different from the almost neo-realistic style of the European opening credits.\n\n28During the credits and for the duration of the voice-over, the spectators see Desdemona eloping at night to marry Othello in a solitary church ceremony attended only by the inconspicuous Iago and his human marionette Roderigo, both spying from afar. The subsequent wedding night and ensuing festivities take place in Cyprus, after an ellipsis during which the Moor defeats the enemies of the Venetians, the Turks. Othello and Desdemona’s nuptials provide the dramatic reason for much merriment and the resulting diegetic music, used mostly as ambient sound so as not to slow down the film’s rhythm and, consequently, unbalance the duality of image and sound. Mandolins and flutes figure prominently in this part of the film, as did other Venetian instruments when the action was set there, at the beginning of the story. Often the direct source of this music is not seen, operating together with natural elements. Budgetary constraints during the long production of the film led to the sound being added later in post-production, thus avoiding hiring musicians during the shooting period. A notable exception is the melodramatic (i.e., both sensational and musical) sequence set in the Turkish baths. It is filled with perfidious action, as Iago convinces Roderigo to murder Cassio and then kills the said Roderigo in order to silence him. The sequence is also famous for its stunning photography, which highlights the steam and the running water in a chiaroscuro setting; and the fast-paced editing, together with almost orgiastic mandolins sounding in the sequence’s grand finale, which amounts to a musical and dramaturgical climax (conveying Iago’s sadism towards Roderigo). The music in this sequence begins as diegetic, with two players seen fingering their instruments, and ends in an extradiegetic crescendo of forty mandolins combined as one to reinforce the intensity of the drama and the perfidy of the action. Such excessive music is a commentary, no longer on the characters but rather on the moral nature of the Cyprian microcosm, rendered even more claustrophobic and malign.\n\n29The music is overall quite ritualistic. The military trumpets sounding on the citadel’s ramparts and the bells tolling a little everywhere bring together State and Church in a Catholic context, contrary to the exotic and profane instruments of the festivities. They work not only as signals (heard in the foreground) but as symbols as well, not always aligned with the corresponding image (Flueckiger 161). The musical score is not continuous, but its impact is reinforced with musical leitmotifs used in the same way Wagner employed them. In Othello, these musical leitmotifs have the psychic and emotional import of opera, but with the short length found in film scores. They are short but effective. For instance, the sharp piano keys from the initial sequence and the dissonant beats we hear when Othello’s ship returns from defeating the Turks relate to the Moor and represent him. They stand for authority – to which the quadruple-meter majesty contributes – but equally menace (as they are rather loud). Inversely, a choir of female voices works as Desdemona’s leitmotif, conveying her candour and purity of heart. These two leitmotifs are semantic counterparts of each other, as the play (and the film) lays down the dichotomies black/white, male/female, false/true.\n\n30These leitmotifs change over time, depending on the events and emotions both characters face (as per Bribitzer-Stul 8, and Link 180). They produce an emotional association in the audience while allowing for new music-dramatical contexts in a vaster musical structure (Bribitzer-Stul 10). For instance, when Othello arrives in Cyprus to reunite with Desdemona, a female choir is heard over her image because Othello sees her as pure. Later, already poisoned against her by Iago, in a scene in which he is outdoors on the ramparts, overlooking Desdemona with her maid, he lists his wife’s qualities and a mix of his and Desdemona’s respective leitmotifs can be heard, signifying that her purity has been tainted by Othello’s ruminations. Othello’s leitmotif changes as he is more and more contaminated by Iago’s perfidy. Both protagonists’ leitmotifs keep on interacting like this in hybrid combinations until Othello decides to strangle Desdemona. Fifteen minutes before the end of the film, Desdemona retires to her bed and Othello lurks outside her quarters, seen in a looming shadow on the wall. The sharp ominous piano keys of the opening sequence sound again followed by the essentially female choir we have come to associate with Desdemona, but now with some male voices added in. The two leitmotifs then separate, foretelling that the Moor will soon separate his wife from the living. On the other hand, Iago’s leitmotif – the dissonance we hear when we first see him in the iron cage – stands for his duplicity and treachery. It is deployed in more tenuous variations throughout the film when he is seen plotting with Roderigo or insinuating to Othello that Desdemona is physically intimate with Cassio. Iago’s leitmotif is as winding as the metaphorical serpent that he is. Thus Othello’s, Desdemona’s and Iago’s leitmotifs are also metaphorical evocations of the characters they represent. Iago is pure Evil, Desdemona is pure Good (hence her more melodic leitmotif constituted by singing); Othello, as pure Force, is easily manipulated by the former to annihilate the latter. Indeed, after Othello strangles Desdemona, he covers her face with a white silk cloth and Desdemona’s leitmotif chorus is heard, followed by the dissonant chords associated with Iago in a very long shot that shows the iron cage hanging in the distance. Evil has triumphed over Good.\n\n31Non-diegetic music is often used in Othello and serves as short musical interludes when clearly separating scenes. Although that is also one of the functions of a musical score in the Hollywood cinematic tradition, here music begins a scene and is then complemented by the sound effects or ceases altogether, not necessarily giving way to the dialogues. In fact, in Welles’s Othello the classical sound hierarchy is clearly challenged: dialogues are not placed in the forefront, effects at the end, and the music in the middle. Notwithstanding the importance of the film’s music as music, in Othello’s soundtrack all sounds are woven together, and it is from this embroidery that the film derives its true musical nature.\n\n32Thus, in Othello sounds and voices are “musicalized” as much as the music itself, all being sources of musicality as argued by Kulezic-Wilson (The Musicality 4). “The performative dimension is obviously an important factor that can lend a musical quality to spoken language” in this film as in others (Kulezic-Wilson, The Musicality 6). Contrary to what some critics have claimed, the voices in the film are not boringly amorphous but rather deliberately kept at a low pitch to better blend with the other sounds. In the already-mentioned scene when he is reunited with Desdemona in Cyprus, Othello’s already suave voice is made even more musical by the sounds of the wind blowing and the sea crashing in the background. Roderigo’s voice is slightly high-pitched because he is portrayed as a rather effeminate nobleman, in clear contrast to Othello, who is weakened in the play but not to the point of emasculation. Welles’s profoundly charismatic voice is naturally melodic; in Othello he makes it vibrate even more by using a lower pitch than usual. So proficient and seductive is his voice that it is a credible medium to convey his deeds to Desdemona. This is what ultimately made him win her love, as Othello himself explains to the Venice senators at the outset of the film. The scene of this report marks the first time the audience clearly sees the protagonist’s face, in a profile close-up, immediately granting the Moor an iconic status. All music and sounds – which thus far had been uninterrupted – stop at that point. Othello’s voice is the instrument to which this scene is anchored, and it alone suffices. However, even Micheál MacLiammóir’s voice playing Iago is somewhat grainy; his timbre is different from Welles’s playing Othello, but he too is using a low pitch. So, although here Othello and Iago are not vocalizing as a tenor and a baritone respectively, as happens in Zeffirelli’s film adaptation of Verdi’s opera, they are nonetheless using singsong voices. Jack J. Jorgens perceives this underplaying as a very apt choice on the director’s part:\n\nWelles expresses Othello’s character not through acting, but through sound effects, movement, and setting. Unlike Olivier, Welles cuts the scenes of bravado, avoids the big gestures and continual use of his magnificent voice” (Jorgens 155, the emphasis is mine).\n\n33Overall the film has little action, except for Cassio’s drunken scene, the duel in the underground reservoir, Roderigo’s murder in the Turkish baths, and Desdemona’s and Othello’s deaths. Due to its theatrical source, the film is loaded with dialogue. Conversations such as those between Iago and Roderigo or Iago and Othello, in which insinuations are made and lies told (relating to supposedly past events committed by Desdemona, Cassio, or both) should be considered opera recitatives. No visual equivalent is provided in Welles’s film for these narratives which occur, for the most part, with a sound effects background composed of wind and/or other natural elements. Since the accompaniment is kept to a minimum, they may fall under the category of recitativo secco. Iago’s claim that he heard Cassio dreaming of Desdemona and indiscreetly revealing their alleged passionate affair while sleeping is an action that never took place, but as it is believed by Othello it advances the plot. In contradistinction, one would expect the arias (that is, the monologues) to be more flamboyant, as is the case in opera, but Welles confounds our expectations and for a good reason. Michal Grover-Friedlander asserts that in Zeffirelli’s Otello, the tenor Placido Domingo in the title role shouts rather than sings during his first rendition (the “Esultate”). At that point, the commentator claims, Othello’s voice “is an operatic voice without melody, a voice somewhere between melody and noise, an extension of musical representations of noise, which recurs in [Verdi’s] opera” (64). Welles’s strategy for his film is the very opposite of Zeffirelli’s in that here the noises are made into music; the acting may be downplayed but all sounds are musicalized, including the voice. Thus, what could be more flamboyant than making the voice shine above the rest, as is the original intention in opera arias? Othello’s abbreviated monologue “It is the cause”, delivered before he goes to his marital chambers to kill Desdemona, works in the film as an inverted aria. The Moor is expressing his darkest feelings about his relationship with his beloved, and no other sound is heard besides his voice. The same happens shortly after with the monologue “Put out the light!”\n\n34This monophonic texture of the Wellesian arias is made even more unforgettable because of what lies in between them. In the above-mentioned example of Othello preparing himself to kill Desdemona the two monologues or operatic arias of maximum dramatic importance are separated by a chorus that stops abruptly as the Moor opens the curtains in Desdemona’s lodgings. It also contrasts with other solos which do have background noises as a sort of homophonic variation on the traditional musical accompaniment. For example, Othello’s monologue “Farewell!”, which he voices before receiving the Venetian ambassadors that visit Cyprus, is pronounced over a background effects track composed mostly of wind blowing and sea waves crashing. The same happens in the film’s most visually stunning scene, the dialogue between Othello and Iago in which the latter finally convinces the Moor of his wife’s betrayal. This duo is the only scene in the whole film that has a long tracking shot, in contrast to the fast-cutting pace of the rest of the opus, but the soundtrack is that of nature’s musical reinforcement and loud sounds, just like the waves crashing below.\n\n35Indeed, the sound effects, unusually loud for Hollywood standards, are part of both the structural and musical patterns, operating as fertile semantic elements. For example, the cries of seagulls are integrated into the natural embroidery of the soundtrack, but they become symbols of decadence as well. When Iago and Cassio talk about Bianca, seagulls fill the shore and the sky as Othello believes Cassio is speaking rudely about Desdemona instead. The sexual connotation of the scene is evident. Soon after, Othello falls to the ground stricken with an epileptic seizure. The first thing he sees when he recovers consciousness is a seagull flying over, then the ramparts filled with people, perceived upside down as he is lying on the ground. After blinking, he sees a whole flock of seagulls. These images are psychologically produced and so is the soundtrack at this point. Later, on what is to be her deathbed, Desdemona waits for Othello to come to her, fearing his anger. The loud metal sound of a gate clanking as he penetrates a large antechamber, his footsteps on the stone floor resonating in the hall, together with a non-diegetic anguished chorus that stops suddenly at a very high pitch – almost shrill – disclose her state of mind to us."
