        "text": "Unconventional approach\n\nAccording to Welles, Othello was originally set to be an opera film, a suggestion that came from the film's original producer. The idea was inspired by Giuseppe Verdi's Otello, an opera based on Shakespeare's masterpiece.\n\nHowever, when the producer saw that Welles was skirting the operatic concept in favour of a more cinematic approach, he refused to stay involved with the project.\n\nDespite the budgeting nightmare that the Italian's exit created, Welles persisted.\n\nHe sought a French production company, having already selected Victorine Studios in Southern France for shooting indoor scenes, while Venice and Essaouira stood tall in outdoor scenes.\n\nMany critics and historians speculated that a cash-strapped Welles chose Essaouira to save money, having been abandoned by one producer after another. Faced with few alternatives, Welles relied on his own private production company.\n\nDuring that time (1948-1951), Morocco was a filmmaker's haven, free of bureaucratic complications and expensive filming contract requirements.\n\nWelles quickly obtained the necessary permits, only to face another issue: once the project kicked off, there was a glaring lack of commitment and punctuality in the costume design department, due to depleted funds.\n\nThat failed to deter the then-36-year-old director.\n\nWithin the bustling environment of Essaouira, then known as Mogador, Welles sought the help of local artisans and craftsmen. They weaved costumes from jute, fashioned shields from sardine boxes, and contributed to the peculiarity and vibrancy of many scenes by joining the cast as soldiers and other extras.\n\nOthello's Moroccan origins\n\nHowever, there was more to Welles choosing Essaouira than just money.\n\nFirst, there was a spatial alignment between the city and the film's scenario, which unfolds between Venice and Cyprus.\n\nBut more importantly, there was a historical and anthropological reason behind choosing Essaouira as a key setting: the character of Othello himself, who has roots in North Africa, particularly Morocco, as evidenced by his dark skin and renowned title of Moor.\n\nIndeed, the titular protagonist of Shakespeare's 1622 play was a popular Moroccan leader serving as a Venetian general. His grace, strength and military prowess charmed Desdemona, the daughter of a nobleman in town.\n\nThe Senate entrusted Othello with leading an army to fight the Turks in Cyprus, but soon the story turned tragic when his jealous flag bearer, Iago, told him of Desdemona's adultery with Cassio, Othello's trusted aide.\n\nThe unfounded accusation led to Othello murdering his wife and ultimately taking his own life.\n\nMost of the plot and characters of Shakespeare's play are originally based on a tale found in Italian writer Giraldi Cinthio's 1565 book, Hecatommithi. There, Othello is called 'Il Moro', a common description of North Africans, particularly Moroccans, during that period.\n\nThus, despite deviating from the original character's name, Shakespeare did preserve his Moroccan origin. Some even suggest that Shakespeare drew inspiration for Othello from Abd al-Wahid bin Masoud, the Moroccan ambassador to Queen Elizabeth I at the time.\n\nWelles as Othello\n\nWelles' movie picks up where Shakespeare's play left off: a solemn funeral for Othello and Desdemona. The haunting opening scene is masterfully shot against the backdrop of Essaouira's port castle, which represents the island of Cyprus.\n\nThe ominous castle on the rocky shores of the sea forewarns the audience of dark, complex, and tragic events to come.\n\nWhat makes this cinematic offering even more unique is that Welles himself portrayed Othello, with a performance as impressive as it is compelling.\n\nWelles did whatever he needed to do to match his character's Moroccan-ness, even in terms of skin colour; perhaps the black-and-white cinematography also helped veil the actor's naturally fair and blonde appearance.\n\nAll of Welles' efforts paid off in the end.\n\nThe film won big at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952, where Welles chose to dedicate his award to Essaouira, acknowledging it as not just a logistical choice, but a natural homage to Othello's intrinsic Moroccan identity."
