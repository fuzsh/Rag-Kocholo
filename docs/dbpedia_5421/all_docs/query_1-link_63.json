        "text": "#852117 by scubaanders\n\nWhen I was in the middle of renovating my daughters newly bought apartment, painting, putting up wallpapers, laying a new hardwood floor and upgrading the electric wiring an interesting ad showed up on our equivalent to Craigslist.A 1984 Gpz1100 mostly original, but only running on starter fluid and the guy was asking a thousand bucks, and this time it was close, in the suburbs of Stockholm.We let the guy roast for a few days and then Bobby, a Honda restro modding buddy of mine went to look at the bike.Bobby told the guy that we will end his misery and cater for the poor bike but a thousand US was to much for a non runner.So with a solid, mostly original bike with a box of original parts was ours for a staggering 800 USD. Unfortunately Bobby decided that this bike was to sweet, so he wanted to be a part of it so I had to agree to shared custody.So for the first time we are considering a original restore (except for the exhaust), but only the future will decide, first we need to get the DFI sorted and then bike running.\n\nBrgds Anders\n\nGpz750R1 1982\n\nGpz750A1 1983\n\nGpz1100A2 1984\n\nFZ750 1985\n\nGpz900R -91\n\nPlease Log in or Create an account to join the conversation.\n\n#852124 by kzstreetfighter71\n\nSubscribed as i will be getting my teeth into one or two of these in the months to come and any and all tips will be taken on board.\n\n06 Gsf 1200 bandit, 08 Triumph tiger 1010\n\n05 Yam xv1700 , 02 Hon shadow 1100\n\n1975 Z1 (currently working on)\n\n1977 Z1000 ( running and in storage)\n\n1978 Z1000 (currently working on)\n\n1978 Z1r \"skinny tank\" (currently working on)\n\n1978 Z1r \"fat tank (gathering parts)\n\n1979 z1000st (currently working on)\n\nPlease Log in or Create an account to join the conversation.\n\n#852184 by woodyvale\n\nI've just spent the last few years restoring one of these.

For the price we paid, she was definitively worth it. Now she will have to sit until the end of august beginning of September until we have time to sink our teeth in to her.\n\nBrgds Anders\n\nGpz750R1 1982\n\nGpz750A1 1983\n\nGpz1100A2 1984\n\nFZ750 1985\n\nGpz900R -91\n\nPlease Log in or Create an account to join the conversation.\n\n#853854 by scubaanders\n\nSo it was time to get started.\n\nI emptied the tank from the old stale fuel and much to my delight I found that the tank was spanking clean inside, no varnish or grit just clean metal.\n\nRinsed the tank out with ethanol and blow dried it in order to prepare it for paint later. Bobby hates it when I give him fuel smelling tanks to paint.\n\nNext up the DFI.\n\nWith a newly recharged battery sporting a healthy 12.3V I was good to go. The bike fires on Starter spray (Ether) so it turns over and the ignition is alive.\n\nFuel pump test.\n\nThe PO had replaced the original fuel pump with some no name replacement pump, but the original pump was in the box of parts we got with the bike. Took the fuel filter and pump of the bike, the filter and some of the fuel hoses were in pretty bad shape and went in the bin, the replacement pump looks brand new and I don’t think they ever got the bike running with that pump.\n\nFished the original pump out of the parts box and cleaned it up. Hooked up both pumps and they both runs and pumps fuel, didn’t test to what pressure but both pulls 0.4 A while running which sound ok.\n\nFuel pump power supply test. Looked up 10-26 in the FSM which says positive lead to the pump shall:\n\ngive Battery voltage for 5 sec when the ignition is turned on, Check.\n\nPositive lead to the pump shall give Battery voltage while starter button is pressed, Check.\n\nPositive lead to the pump shall give Battery voltage while pin #18 or pin #8 on the control unit is grounded in order to mimic the engine running, Check.\n\nWith good spirits I hooked up the original fuel pump and turned on the ignition. Nothing!\n\nThe pump stays silent regardless, it doesn’t run for the 5sec or when starter button is pushed.\n\nI suspected dirty connectors so I pulled all connectors apart and cleaned all connector blades as they felt oily, like they had been soaked in WD40 or CRC 556. Also removed the fuel pump relay and cleaned the connector there as well.\n\nStill not a sound from the fuel pump.\n\nStarted to suspect that even though the voltage on the connectors, maybe the ground was bad, so I earthed the pump strait to the negative terminal on the battery.\n\nStill not a sound from the pump.\n\nSo we are losing the juice somewhere on the way to the pump as it doesn’t turn it over.\n\nNext time I will take a step back and run through all the tests to try to figure out what is wrong.\n\nIdeas and experiences are welcome.\n\n(^o^)\n\n//Anders\n\nGpz750R1 1982\n\nGpz750A1 1983\n\nGpz1100A2 1984\n\nFZ750 1985\n\nGpz900R -91\n\nPlease Log in or Create an account to join the conversation.\n\n#853877 by Highway Magician\n\nReplied by Highway Magician on topic Who can resist a non runner?

If you look closely at the connectors, one set is made to lock together. The other set isn't.\n\nIf you need a fuel pump relay, this is the correct replacement:\n\nFUEL PUMP RELAY\n\n11 Prong Dual Relay\n\nMade By : Bosch\n\nMade In : GermanyPart #: 0332514120 / 0332514102 / 0332514103 / 0332514106 VOLKSWAGEN 1974 412 1.8L\n\n75-78 Type1 Bug\n\n1974 Campmobile\n\n75-79 Super Beetle\n\n1974 Transporter 1.8L\n\n75-78 Transporter\n\n1979 Transporter Excluding California\n\n80-81 Vanagon Excluding Caliifornia\n\n82-83 Vanagon 2.0L Excluding California\n\nMotorcycle builder since 1973.

I would take care of that (lightly scrape with\n\na razorblade or use fine sandpaper, etc.), or just replace it.\n\nI would clean the DFI computer and connectors, and try it again..\n\nIt's possible that the DFI computer is bad. Is it still mounted in the three rubber mounts?\n\nVibration will eventually catch-up with electronic devices. Those mounts are about $15\n\neach, and I recently bought them for my '82 GPZ1100. A lot of money but they were\n\nmissing, and they are necessary items.\n\nMotorcycle builder since 1973. Master Tech.

I would put the battery on a charger.\n\nCan you open the fuel pump relay cover without damaging it?\n\nIf you are able to open it, you may see corrosion, etc. inside, and know if it needs to be replaced.\n\nI bought a fuel pump relay on ebay but the seller is sold out right now.\n\nMotorcycle builder since 1973.
