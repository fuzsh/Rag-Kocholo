        "text": "“When I turned 30, I knew my life was at a crossroads. It was either over, or I was going to restart.”\n\n– Glenn Beck [9:10]\n\nThe goal of my blog and podcast is to push you outside of your comfort zone and force you to question assumptions.\n\nThis is why I invite divergent thinkers and world-class performers who often disagree. I might interview Tony Robbins and then Matt Mullenweg. Or I might have a long chat with Sam Harris, PhD, and later invite a seemingly opposite guest like…\n\nGlenn Beck.\n\nThis interview is a wild ride, and it happened — oddly enough — thanks to a late-night sauna session. I was catching up with an old friend, who is mixed-race, a Brown University grad, and liberal in almost every sense of the word. I casually asked him, “If you could pick one person to be on the podcast, who would it be?”\n\n“Glenn Beck,” he answered without a moment’s hesitation. “His story is FASCINATING.”\n\nHe described how Glenn hit rock bottom and restarted his life in his 30’s, well past the point most people think it possible. Fast forward to 2014, Forbes named him to their annual Celebrity 100 Power List and pegged his earnings at $90 million for that year. This placed him ahead of people like Mark Burnett, Jimmy Fallon, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will Smith. Glenn’s platforms — including radio, tv, digital (TheBlaze.com), publishing, etc. — get somewhere between 30 and 50 million unique visitors per month.\n\nThis interview is neither a “gotcha” interview nor a softball interview. I ask some tough questions (e.g. “If you were reborn as a disabled gay woman in a poor family, what political system would you want in place?”), but my primary goal is to pull out routines, habits, books, etc. that you can use. This show is about actionable insight, not argument for argument’s sake.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a story of entrepreneurship, and whether you love Glenn, hate Glenn, or have never heard his name, there is a lot to learn from him.\n\nAfter listening to this (no tirades before, please), I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments!\n\nYou can find the transcript of this episode here.

Here is Peter and my experimental “conversation.” We delve into his principles of entrepreneurship, building massive companies, value creation, and competition, among other things (stream below or right-click here to download):\n\nEp 28: Peter Thiel, Billionaire Investor and Company Creator on Investing, Business, and Life\n\nThis podcast is brought to you by 99Designs, the world’s largest marketplace of graphic designers.
