        "text": "Absolutely thrilled to be a part of this conversation on ‘Life in the Future: How government and private sectors will collaborate in tomorrow's cities’ As our cities evolve, the fusion of public and private sectors is becoming a driving force behind the creation of smarter, more sustainable urban environments. Innovative collaborations are redefining the way we think about infrastructure, services, and the very fabric of urban life. It’s not just about technology; it’s about creating a seamless, integrated experience that meets the needs of all citizens. By leveraging the strengths of both public and private entities, we can design cities that are more connected, resilient, and responsive to the challenges of the future. Looking forward to sharing how these concepts are being realized in the Middle East, where ambition meets innovation. Don’t miss this insightful conversation!

This partnership will help solutions by stc’s clients make their mark as they reinvent business and drive customer experience excellence in the region of Saudi Arabia. frog’s proven strength in shaping bold innovation and orchestrating customer-centricity will truly deliver on solutions by stc’s ambitions and drive transformative value for clients. Let’s get ready to build experiences that disrupt the status quo, win hearts, and realize a regenerative future!\n\nCongratulations to all the #bima100 winners that we announced last night. Such an impressive bunch! Thanks to the BIMA central team for organising such a great event: Matt Sullivan Jan Carlyle @john ajayi Jess Hall (FCCA)Giorgia Andreano Chioma Abiaka Lara Parry And thanks to all our members for making me feel so welcome as President. As I said last night, I see my role as channelling all your amazing passion and energy so we can collectively make the greatest impact to our industry and the world!\n\nTo think, when I first experienced the magic of Alula 40 years ago, that I would end up being part of the team introducing this incredible place to the rest of the world. Well done to the RCU marketing team and partners for this captivating campaign. Well done Abeer M. AlAkel Ahmed Daoud Waleed Aldayel Lawrence Eta\n\nI can't wait to continue the work that Simon, Mary and Matt started last year. The £44bn UK digital creative industry is a key player in our economy. I'm excited to help BIMA become the catalyst for the industry to reach its full potential. I’ve always been a huge fan and supporter of BIMA and all the great work it has done over the last 40 years. I look forward to working with current and potential members to create and implement a new vision for BIMA to be ready for the next 40 years and beyond.\n\nI’ve been involved in quite a few attempts to use gaming as a marketing vehicle. Platforms like Roblox finally give brands the chance to reach large numbers of players if we get the games and the promotional support right. Which I hope we did on this one, as the gameplay is great and the objective worthy. Props to the team that smashed this out of the dessert."
