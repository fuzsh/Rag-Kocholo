I commend you for your efforts in trying to alleviate the prejudice and hate in our country. There is much need for such endeavor. —Congressman J. W. Trimble, Letter to Orson Welles, April 1, 1946 The above letter from Congressman Trimble to Orson Welles is one of thirty similar letters from United States congresspersons located in the “Orson Welles MSS Correspondences” (hereafter called “the Welles Correspondences”) of Indiana University’s Lilly Library. The letters, dated from April 1 to April 24, 1946, acknowledge or thank Welles for sending the recipient a copy of Arthur Miller’s novel Focus, which is largely about the experience and festering of antisemitism in America. They pose an interesting provocation to Welles scholars who have made increased use of telegrams, letters, and public speeches to provide a more holistic sense of how Welles participated in public life beyond his much-discussed creative efforts in cinema, radio, and theater. As such, the Welles Correspondences reveal much about the progressive political discourses of social equality in which Welles participated. PROGRESSIVISM AND THE STRUGGLES AGAINST RACISM AND ANTISEMITISM Welles’s Correspondences in 1946 JAMES N. GILMORE Orson Welles in Focus 132 This chapter focuses on several examples of Welles engaging—as wellasthewayshewasengagedby—Jewishcommunities,humanitarian groups,andsociopoliticalissuesofequalityinthepost-WorldWarIImoment of 1946. The decision to concentrate on the year 1946 is in no way arbitrary:in1945–46,WellesdirectedthefilmTheStranger,wroteanewspaper column for the New York Post, delivered a regular fifteen-minute radiobroadcastforABC,andstagedaversionofJulesVerne’s Around the World in 80 Days with songs by Cole Porter, in addition to appearing at a variety of events for political associations. This was, putting it simply, a very busy year in Welles’s life, wherein his work traversed, seemingly, as many media forms as possible, positioning him as a preeminent public intellectual of the immediate postwar period. Situating antisemitism as a crucial but often unacknowledged part of Welles’s broader political interest in civil rights and social equality, this chapter examines his support for Jewish refugees immediately following World War II as well as his responses to antisemitic discourse in America. Additionally, it argues that in order to understand how Welles approached the task of analyzing and critiquing social injustice, his critique must be traced across his work in a number of different forms of media and communication. Welles’s Correspondences provide an important supplement to existing studies that emphasize the relationships and consistencies across hispublicworks.Forexample,Welles’sprivatecorrespondencescanhelp to bolster the ties between, say, his work in radio and his public speeches through tracing how certain social groups approached him, and how he, in return, dialogued with their representatives. The letters sent to Welles during this period reveal some of the ways in which demographics valued his voice (often quite literally, as many progressive groups asked Welles for speeches at rallies, or voice-over work in educational films). The Welles Correspondences expand information about Welles’s robust and diverse political activities, housing fan (and hate) mail along with conversations both personal and professional. His progressive ideology —emphasizing civil rights, racial tolerance, and social equality— helped him become a symbol for smaller grassroots groups attempting tocombatlocalracialandculturaldiscrimination.TheCorrespondences [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-15 15:40 GMT) Struggles against Racism and Antisemitism 133 provide an underutilized means to assess how ideologically progressive individualsandgroupswithsympatheticsocialgoalsapproachedWelles. These letters, in other words, provide a way to assess how Welles’s public voice was received. In a different context, Eric Smoodin has suggested that audience letters reveal “a more significant understanding of at least one small part of a much larger history of reading, listening, watching, and responding .”1 Emphasizing the act of responding through letter writing highlights Welles’s place in American society through asking questions such as: How did Welles discuss and represent the specific conditions of the American political and cultural landscape in which he worked, and how did that work matter to the publics who engaged him? How did letter writing lead to or supplement other forms of civic engagement, such as fundraising, forums, and educational films? In answering these questions, I take Jonathan Rosenbaum’s contention quite seriously that “most ambitious Welles studies have been unresponsive to the wider aspects of culture . . . that Welles himself was engaged with throughout his life,” and see it as a call to action for a more sociocultural analysis of Welles and the..."
