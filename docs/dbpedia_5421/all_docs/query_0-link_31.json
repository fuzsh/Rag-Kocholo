        "text": "The following is a college paper for UC Berkeley Film Studies course: History of Film II\n\nOriginally submitted on May 7, 2004\n\n___________________________________\n\nDeeply Focused: The Cinematography of Citizen Kane\n\nIt is widely noted that it was cinematographer Gregg Toland who first contacted Orson Welles about shooting Citizen Kane (1941).[1] The collaboration lasted only six months[2] but the film they created has endured for more than six decades. Much has been written on Toland’s contributions to the film. What is important to the film scholar is how Toland’s cinematography contributes to the theoretical and historical discourse surrounding the film. The cinematography affects our understanding of Citizen Kane by providing a stable framework for theoretical and historical discussions. This essay will examine one theoretical framework, realism, and connect it to Toland’s work to reveal the complexities and impact cinematography has to the discourse surrounding Citizen Kane.\n\nIn 1940 when production on Citizen Kane began, Gregg Toland was considered one of Hollywood’s best cinematographers.[3] Yet, according to Toland, what drew him to the film was Welles’ insistence that the story be told most effectively and (if needed) without Hollywood conventions.[4] Most importantly, the Hollywood convention of assigning cinematographers to a film only days before shooting began was obliterated when Toland was brought onto the film almost one month before shooting commenced.[5] We can see that from the very beginning of production, Citizen Kane was created in an atmosphere of innovation and defiance.\n\nAccording to Pauline Kael, “Welles and Toland do brilliantly with a camera everything Hollywood has always said you couldn’t do.”[6] This includes shooting into lights, into the dark, and into ceilings. What results is something new and fresh that defied Hollywood’s insistence “to provide films which used patterns of proven success to create a product.”[7] This is important because it is Citizen Kane’s perceived deviance that has contributed to its endurance and is at the center of many theoretical and historical discourses surrounding the film\n\nOne of the most widely discussed theories surrounding Citizen Kane is that of cinematic realism. At the center of the film’s realism is deep-focus and long-take cinematography. According to Toland, the deep-focus and long-take styles were developed from Welles’ insistence for realism. Welles wanted the audience to be unaware of the cinematic apparatus by creating scenes that would flow together imperceptibly without the need for inter-cutting.[8]\n\nDeep-focus is a cinematography technique that approximates the vision of the human eye. Specific technological innovations in the late 1930’s such as faster film emulsions, coated lenses, and quieter brighter lamps all contributed to the advent of deep-focus cinematography.[9] To film theorist André Bazin, deep-focus cinematography, with dramatic juxtapositions composed within the frame, allows the spectator to work out the relationships and emotional implications of the shot.[10] The spectator’s eye and mind create the kind of connections normally produced through montage.\n\nCitizen Kane was not Toland’s first experience with deep-focus photography. The technique was sparingly used in the three films he shot prior to Citizen Kane: Wuthering Heights (1939, his first Academy Award win), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), and The Long Voyage Home (1940, a film that shares another element with Kane that I will return to later).[11]\n\nWhat is important, however, for this essay is how Toland’s deep-focus cinematography affects our understanding of Citizen Kane. The answer, unlike Toland’s images, is not so clear. Acknowledging Toland’s contribution to the deep-focus technique is important because it informs us to the impact the images have on our own lives. By approximating the vision of the human eye, Toland trains the viewer to scan the image for clues to the implications of the composition. In a subtle but effective way, I believe Toland implicitly encourages us to do the same in our own lives. Citizen Kane, therefore, becomes a signifier to our own experience.\n\nToland’s deep-focus cinematography informs the viewer to human experience in another way. To this viewer, the deep-focus technique is very reminiscent of the style of photojournalism. Photojournalists often employ wide-angle lenses to capture as much image as possible to place the viewer in the context of the scene. What results is a deep-focus style approximate to that of Citizen Kane. As a former CBS videojournalist, I too adopted a style of deep-focus videography. I was not a student of journalism, however, but my goal was to give my viewer the sense that they were where I was. The Kane viewer is further reminded of the human experience through the use of deep-focus associated with the photojournalist.\n\nDeep-focus cinematography provides another form of expression for the cinematographer. This expression comes from the connotative meanings of images. Images can be coded through lighting, movement, angle, distance, and color. These codes are cultural and subjective and can be harder to pin down than the denotative meaning of images.\n\nThe shot of Kane, through Thatcher’s memoirs, signing his properties over to the bank, typify Toland and Welles’ knowledge and use of the connotative meanings of images. Kane walks to the back of the room as Mr. Bernstein reads aloud the terms of the bank’s ownership of Kane’s property. As Kane walks, he diminishes in size so that he is standing underneath three giant windows that at the beginning of the shot appear to be smaller. In the deep-focus composition Bernstein occupies right side of the frame in a close-up, Thatcher occupies the left side in a medium shot, and Kane between the two in an extreme long shot. Here the denotative meaning of the image, Kane diminishing, connotes Kane’s loss of power and stature, etc.\n\nHere we can see that Toland and Welles were well informed to the artistic theories that define the connotative meanings of imagery. This shot is also reminiscent of Kane’s mother signing him over to Thatcher. In this shot, a young Kane is framed in a window with his father to one side and his mother and Thatcher to the other. Again we see the connotative meanings of imagery interacting with there denotative functions. Kane separates his mother and father, the mother being aligned with Thatcher. Mrs. Kane, in the foreground of the frame, occupies most of the image, which connotes her power. What is important for this essay is that Toland and Welles, though not documented, seem to be aware of the connotative power of images. The use of deep-focus cinematography exploits the full coded potential of imagery.\n\nDeep-focus photography informs another important discourse surrounding Citizen Kane. Many texts have been written on the subjective camera employed by Toland and Welles. Arguments are made that the deep-focus style, approximating the vision of the human eye, works to support the narrative logic of the camera, thus the spectator, as viewing Kane through the eyes of the subjective narrator.\n\nA careful analysis of any of the flashback sequences, I believe, debunks this theory as the deep-focus camera as subjective. In many of the sequences the camera views events that the current narrator is not present to see. One example is Jed Leland’s flashback. When Susan Alexander is performing at the opera, the camera, in one of the film’s most famous shots, floats up to the catwalks to reveal two stagehands as one pinches his nose to express his opinion of her performance. While this shot certainly expresses Leland’s feelings for Susan’s singing, there is no indication that Leland can see the two stagehands.\n\nThe result is that deep-focus cinematography places the camera and the spectator in a position of privilege. We see things that none of the characters can see. The camera, thus the viewer, becomes nearly omniscient, selectively not subjectively viewing the story. To this end, the deep-focus photography is not realist. If deep-focus, the technique employed for realism, contributes to a hyper-real or unreal aesthetic, how are our understandings of Toland’s contributions affected? To this viewer, my understanding becomes deeper. I can infer that Toland’s contributions extended far beyond Welles and Toland’s stated intentions. Their collaboration produces a filmic discourse that is far more complex and engaging than the simplicity that realism implies. It is not the only non-realist moment in Leland’s flashback.\n\nLeland narrates the story of Kane and Susan’s first meeting, as told to him by Kane, to reporter Thompson. Essentially we get a story (Kane’s) inside a story (Leland’s) inside a story (the film). As Laura Mulvey accurately points out, when Kane and Susan are inside her (Susan’s) apartment, the film completely switches stylistic methods.[12] The cinematography switches from deep-focus to soft-focus and the editing switches from long-take to classical shot-reverse-shot structure. The result is a sequence that takes on added significance.\n\nIn Citizen Kane, deep-focus and long-take cinematography is the norm. When that deep-focus and the long-take style is replaced by soft-focus and montage, the latter becomes the dominant by deviating from the norm and takes on increased importance.[13] What is suggested is that Kane and Susan’s meeting is far more important than just a sexual relationship. Kane and Susan’s relationship is what ends Kane’s political career and is the beginning of his fall from power and rise to grandiose isolation. It may in fact be the key, the “Rosebud,” that Thompson is searching for.\n\nThis small moment of the film exemplifies the impact of Toland’s cinematography on the film. The unconventional, deep-focus cinematography makes it the dominant, the deviant from the norms of Hollywood films. Citizen Kane’s importance, therefore, is derived from its status as different.\n\nGregg Toland and Orson Welles collaborated to create a film marked by its deep-focus style. Toland’s contributions have been the subject of many discussions since Welles chose to share his title card with the cinematographer. A rare honor for any cinematographer, but not Toland’s first (John Ford shared his card with Toland for The Long Voyage Home).[14] When examining Toland’s contributions we learn of a complex system of technology, innovation, art, and business. We can infer that the film would not be the same without Toland’s work. With a careful analysis of Toland’s contributions we can begin to understand exactly what makes Citizen Kane an enduring classic. As for Toland’s impact on all filmmaking, Welles said it best, “Toland was the best director of photography who ever existed. There has never been anyone else in his class.”[15]\n\nBibliography:\n\nCarringer, Robert L. The Making of Citizen Kane.
