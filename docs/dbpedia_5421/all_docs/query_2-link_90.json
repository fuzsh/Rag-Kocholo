        "text": "As ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews (&cet.)\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nSaboteur (1942) Although several of Alfred Hitchcock’s British movies (The Man Who Knew Too Much, The 39 Steps, Secret Agent, Sabotage, The Lady Vanishes) had glanced off the growing international tensions of the 1930s, and the 1940 Foreign Correspondent anticipated Britain and America’s involvement in what would later be called the Second World War, Saboteur was the first of his pictures to deal expressly with the war itself. (Lifeboat would follow, two years later.) Despite its overall air suggesting Office of War Information-directed propaganda and (as a result) occasionally stilted dialogue, Saboteur is a tight, entertaining thriller but from which, unfortunately, its maker borrowed too much from his earlier work, particularly The 39 Steps. The picture is predicated on the Wrong Man scenario: Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), a defense factory employee, is accused of murdering his best friend in an act of explosive industrial sabotage at an airplane factory and is forced underground to prove his innocence and catch the killer. Borrowings from The 39 Steps include the hero’s being handcuffed for much of the action; the suave villain (Otto Kruger) who reveals his complicity to Kane the way Godfrey Tearle tips Robert Donat off, both men convinced they are safe to do so; and the presence in the narrative of a blond woman (Madeline Carroll there, Priscilla Lane here) with whom against her will the innocent man becomes involved and who first tries to betray him to the authorities before joining his cause. There’s also in each picture a sequence set in a crowded theater (the Palladium in The 39 Steps, Radio City Music Hall in Saboteur) and in which gunshots factor. The terrifying Statue of Liberty climax in Saboteur, however, owes nothing to any of Hitchcock’s previous work, even if the villain’s fall is unconvincing by dint of the actor (Norman Lloyd) holding one arm out stiffly as he plummets to his death. In the main, though, the sequence is good Hitchcock. Bad Hitchcock is exemplified by the mistimed explosion at the battleship, depicted largely by the camera raising the shocked faces of the spectators, as if to suggest without showing it that they are being flung into the air. It’s one of those terrible, entirely unpersuasive ideas that permeate the director’s filmography and that you wish someone, perhaps his wife Alma, had talked him out of.\n\nThe picture was cleverly written (Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and Dorothy Parker were the credited scenarists), beautifully shot by Joseph A. Valentine, and Cummings is better than you might expect as the hero. There is a charming sequence in the wagon of a community of circus freaks in which Pedro de Cordoba as the living skeleton and Anita Sharp-Bolster as the bearded lady give lovely performances, and Lane provides an engaging account of the emotionally mercurial young woman. Although his character virtually defines the phrase “too good to be true,” Vaughan Glazer as her blind uncle is an annealing presence and his forest cottage a serene refuge from the chase — he, and it, are a bit like enchanted figures in a fairy-tale who assist the besieged children fleeing the witch on their trail. As the wily titular character, Lloyd gives what I have always regarded as a very strange performance; he either underplays or overplays his reactions, and he reads lines not as if he was unaccustomed to speaking English but unaccustomed to speaking at all. Even the way he walks is odd. Many people love Lloyd in the picture, however, so take my reaction to him as a minority opinion.\n\nBrother, Can You Spare a Dime? (1975) Philippe Mora’s Depression documentary, sans narration but bursting with clips from period newsreels and Hollywood movies, in which Mora posits James Cagney as America’s representative figure, and Franklin Roosevelt as Everyman’s (and -woman’s) personal savior. The FDR hagiography is more than a little thick (the picture all but canonizes him as Saint Franklin) but I will admit that nowhere else have I seen sound footage of Giuseppe Zangara, his attempted assassin, or a striking shot of a naked Gary Cooper emerging from his swimming pool. The more familiar moments, such as the young Orson Welles looking spooked at his press conference the morning after the “War of the Worlds” radio broadcast and Walt Disney being given one large Academy Award and seven little ones by a gushing Shirley Temple for Snow White, are always a pleasure to see again, as are the numerous excerpts from Cagney’s pictures and the clips from King Kong, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, Citizen Kane, The Roaring Twenties, Wild Boys of the Road (that excruciating moment when the train runs over young Edwin Phillips’ legs), the young Fayard and Harold Nicholas dancing up a storm, and Walter Huston in the little-seen or remembered Capra-directed American Madness. There is also an except from a statement by the actress Betty Compson that is the last word in narcissistic ballyhoo, at least before the TikTok age. The music, as may be imagined of a documentary about the 1930s, is rich and varied and includes recordings and appearances by Paul Robeson, Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, The Andrews (but, alas, not the far superior Boswell) Sisters, Benny Goodman and, especially, Cab Calloway singing “Smokey Joe” while demonstrating the fluid moves the Fleischer brothers immortalized in their Betty Boop cartoons — and Michael Jackson later imitate. Some effective clips, such as Joan Blondell singing (in Etta Moten’s voice) the searing, “Brother”-derived “Remember My Forgotten Man” in Gold Diggers of 1933, might have been made more potent by better juxtaposition with the otherwise effectual newsreel footage of Douglas MacArthur leading the brutal destruction of the 1932 “Bonus Army” camp, a betrayal on top of a betrayal and one of the darker marks against Herbert Hoover’s administration. (Those armed thugs were so blood-thirsty you’d almost think they’d been trained, as our current police squads are, by the IDF.) That Warner Bros. permitted a number as frankly left-wing as “Remember My Forgotten Man,” and as implicitly critical of Hoover, even after his term in office was over, in one of its otherwise escapist musical extravaganzas, is illustrative: No other movie studio would have gone near it; the Warners reveled in it. There’s also a telling bit of film showing Cecil B. DeMille barking at his cast and crew that I imagine, to him, showed his command but to anyone else depicted a megalomaniac and professional martinet.\n\nWhile the Hollywood film clips are enjoyable, the most pointed bits involve the social and political history of the Depression: Of Eleanor Roosevelt speaking; Huey Long addressing Congress (and getting laughs Jack Benny might have envied); half-dead looking boys and girls in the dance marathons whose desperation was immortalized by Horace McCoy in They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?; a minister who admits to a camera interviewer that he has just voted Socialist; the many talking heads clearly either reciting memorized texts or reading from cue cards; Bessie Smith’s voice heard singing over newsreel film of floods*; apocalyptic views of the Dust Bowl accompanied by a recording of “Nobody Knows You When You’re Down and Out”; the faces of poor children, and of black Americans in the streets, looking painfully bewildered by what has happened to them; John Dillinger’s body in the morgue and, after his killing, his articulate father John Wilson Dillinger; Humphrey Bogart in the 1937 Black Legion joining a fictionalized edition of the Ku Klux Klan, and surreptitious film of the actual Klan in action; young hepcats Jitterbugging; the New York premiere of Citizen Kane; brief glimpses of Winston Churchill, sanctimoniously asking, “Aren’t we all going through hard times?” (as if you ever missed a meal, Winnie); Roosevelt’s doomed 1940 rival, whose name always makes me think of the Gremlin in the Bob Clampett-directed Bugs Bunny short Falling Hare shouting, “It ain’t Wendell Wilkie!”; paid thugs putting down food strikes (sound familiar?); and newsreel bits from the first and second match between the German symbol of Aryan supremacy Max Schmeling and the “Brown Bomber” Joe Louis. Their initial meeting, in 1936, was a humiliating defeat not merely for black America but for the nation as a whole. At their second, in 1938, Louis felt “the whole damned country was depending on me.” His victory gave everyone, white and black, but especially black, a reason to feel hopeful. While I personally deplore the blood-sport of boxing, sometimes a symbol transcends its origins, and Louis’ symbology had enormous power for positive national allusion.\n\nIn 1975, the footage in Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? of that self-righteous, puffed-up little bantam cock J, Edgar Hoover droning about his agency’s “conduct, intelligence and integrity” drew derision, especially from the young, many of whom had been betrayed in their own social, civil and antiwar movements by FBI spies posing as fellow-travelers.† Today these images would presumably be blown away by gales of knowing laughter… except perhaps from Democrats, who would doubtless fall into fainting swoons at the sight of one of their current heroes.\n\nLifeboat (1944) The second Hitchcock war-time thriller. Like the 1948 Rope it’s an experiment, but unlike that artificial, set-bound (and rather poorly acted) fiasco the limitations the filmmaker put on himself here don’t make the experiment a trial to sit through. Set, aside from some briefs views of ships either in distress or in a threatening position, in the lifeboat of an Allied craft bombed by a German submarine — which was itself destroyed in turn — the movie takes the time to give its characters weight and personality and relationships to one another. (Naturally, the black stevedore played by Canada Lee has fewer dimensions than the Caucasian characters, and tends more to stereotype, in this case of the subservient, conventionally Christian, doormat. And this is all the actor who played Bigger Thomas in Native Son under Orson Welles’ direction in New York could hope for in Hollywood.†) The story was written by John Steinbeck, whom in the wake of the success of John Ford and Nunnally Johnson’s adaptation of The Grapes of Wrath Fox was eager to exploit in its publicity. Unfortunately for Darryl Zanuck, Steinbeck loathed the completed movie and criticized it publicly and that, coupled with hostile press which, idiotically, argued that the picture glorified and ennobled the Nazi Superman played by Walter Slezak, made Lifeboat a flop in its time.\n\nConfining your action to a small boat on the high seas is an arresting notion, although the tank at 20th Century-Fox was a poor substitute for location work, and I’m afraid there’s never a moment in Lifeboat during which you are not aware of how essentially phony it all is. What matters, and what keeps the enterprise afloat in a dramatic sense are the relationships of the survivors huddled on that small skiff to each other and their interdependence for survival, and while they are largely by-the-numbers “types,” the often incisive and even witty screenplay by Jo Swerling, in which Ben Hecht also had an uncredited hand (he reportedly re-worked the ending) and whose strengths are emphasized, at one extreme by the soignée reporter played by Tallulah Bankhead and the wily industrialist portrayed by Henry Hull and, on the other, by Hume Cronyn’s telegraph operator, William Bendix as the gravely wounded prole, and the sadder-but-wiser girl played by Mary Anderson. The German U-Boat survivor they take in, and who is entirely and complacently convinced of his own Übermenschen status, is well played by Walter Slezak but in conception so silkily rotten it’s astounding that some of the picture’s commentators thought his character was being upheld by Hitchcock as a model. John Hodiak’s Red-leaning laborer, who spars with Bankhead before (naturally) they recognize their animal attraction to each other, is poised midway between flesh-and-blood and convenient social stereotype, although it seems to me that his natural snarling hostility toward the capitalist Hull is entirely and intelligently justified, and he hardly represented the “slurs against organized labor” Steinbeck perceived in him. Nor is Lee’s character the “stock comedy Negro” Steinbeck accused him of being, although he is embarrassingly servile and all-too-conventionally pious. Bankhead, essentially playing a variation on the public’s perception of her (and which she exploited ruthlessly for years afterward) comes off best, in part because she has the best lines but also because her character is slowly stripped of everything she values: Her camera, her documentary footage of the ship’s sinking, her typewriter, her fur and, eventually, the jeweled bracelet that represents to her how far she’s come from her proletarian beginnings, and what she’s had to pay for that ascension. It’s a neat (if perhaps a shade too neat) device and ultimately renders her more than a comic technical contrivance. The savagery of the climax, however justifiable, is disturbing, and was meant to disturb, although I suspect the Zionist Hecht disposed of Slezak’s Nazi with a certain amount of joy.\n\nI close with this anecdote concerning Lifeboat‘s lack of a musical score aside from the opening and closing credit sequences: Hitchcock thought the idea of a more conventional score in a picture about people stranded at sea risible, asking, “Where would the orchestra come from?” to which his composer, Hugo Friedhofer, astutely replied, “Where would the cameras come from?” Hitchcock sounded like one of those producers of early talkies who insisted there could be no music except in performance because otherwise the audience would wonder where the musicians were hiding. You’d think by 1944 someone as accomplished as Hitchcock would know better; more, you’d think such ideas would have long since been laughed out of existence.\n\nRascal (1969) Another Disney literary adaptation that, like the 1964 Those Calloways, suffers greatly by comparison with its source. Sterling North’s somewhat fictionalized Rascal: A Memoir of a Better Era is a book necessarily filled with the quiet pleasures of an early 20th century Wisconsin boyhood and which holds the sort of charm and enchantment of the best stories about children and animals. Someone at Disney — possibly the producer, James Algar — decided that North’s gentle story needed a dose of slapstick, overly-sentimental plot complications and even the presence of a friendly/meddling minister with a lisp-producing overbite getting quietly sloshed on fermented juice. Since Algar wrote another, much more effective and enjoyable, Disney adaptation (of Sheila Burnford’s The Incredible Journey) which eschewed such unnecessary interpolations, I can’t imagine why anyone thought material as good as North’s needed them. I don’t mind so much that Sterling’s age was raised since he’s played by the engaging Bill Mumy (he’s 11 in the book and Mumy was 14 when the movie was filmed) but little else that was changed is an improvement on the original. I very much appreciated Walter Pidgeon’s voice, narrating as the older North, and the lovely cinematography by William E. Snyder, and the art direction (John B. Mansbridge), set decoration (Emile Kuri and Frank R. McKelvy) and period costumes (Rosemary O’Dell) seem to me just about perfect as evocations of their time and place. Still, it’s telling to me that I recalled a mere three moments from Rascal, which I first saw on its initial release, and only one of those came from Sterling North’s book.\n\nSkin Deep (1989) It’s too bad John Ritter made such a success on television, especially in that smarmy 1970s sitcom of his, that it robbed him of a certain level of movie stardom, particularly in high comedy and slapstick, at both of which he was a master. (Surely Ritter was a greater comedian than, say, Chevy Chase, whose career went on well beyond anyone’s ability to comprehend how it happened, or why.) Oddly, very few makers of comedy saw how good he was. Peter Bogdanovich, who considered Ritter for Sonny in The Last Picture Show and would like to have cast him as one of the two leads in his Nickelodeon, used him in a smaller role in that and later gave him larger ones in They All Laughed and his very funny adaptation of the Michael Frayn stage farce Noises Off; he saw Ritter’s potential in movies early on, but almost no one else did. Ritter, with his verbal abilities and his insouciant brilliance at vigorous physical humor, seemed a natural for Blake Edwards, and this late-’80s sex-comedy is a good vehicle for what both did so well. In addition to his intelligence as a writer of dialogue, Edwards’ gifts as a framer of action are on view (the beautiful color photography is by Isidore Mankofsky) and there is a sequence involving glow-in-the-dark condoms, achieved through a combination of black screen and imaginative animation, that is riotously funny.\n\nRitter’s character, the writer Zach Hutton, is spiritual cousin to Dudley Moore’s in Edwards’ “10” and Burt Reynolds’ in the writer-director’s American version of the Truffaut Man Who Loved Women: Men who in these post-“MeToo” times, would doubtless be considered unforgivably “rapey” but who genuinely like and admire women even as they’re hopeful of bedding them. (When women are honest they often admit to similar feelings about the men to whom they are attracted, but just making that observation probably puts me beyond the pale.) We may regard Zach as compulsive, perhaps even priapistic, and still find him charming and witty, as we wait for the inevitable change to take place in the final reel. Like Ritter vis-à-vis Dudley Moore, Vincent Gardenia’s barkeep calls to mind Brian Dennehy’s “10” coeval at the resort hotel, serving as father-confessor, unpaid advisor and verbal sparring-partner, and his dialogues with Ritter remind the viewer of both how witty Blake Edwards could be, and how appealing Gardenia was. Alyson Reed is enormously engaging as Zach’s ex-wife (neither of them can live either with our without the other), Nina Foch has a fine late-career role as Reed’s mother and Michael Kidd is terribly funny as Zach’s half-cynical, half-confused psychiatrist, but as played by Bo Foxworth the role of Reed’s allegedly heterosexual college-age son is no more convincing than he’d have been had Matt Lattanzi or Jake Gyllenhaal been cast in it.\n\nOur Relations (1936) Last month in my remarks about The Bohemian Girl I observed that too many of Laurel and Hardy’s features make the team the victims of overly-deliberate pace. Then, lo and behold! I encountered this pearl of a comedy, which I had somehow never seen before. Although the opening third, in which two sets of identical Stans and Ollies (and the wives of one pair) are set up, is leisurely, once the action begins it doesn’t slow down for a moment, except to allow us to savor an especially funny bit or exchange of clever dialogue. The director, Harry Lachman, keeps up a screwball pace and the screenplay by Felix Adler and Richard Connell is filled with wonderful situations and some gloriously dizzy verbal humor. Perhaps the picture’s having been based on a short story (“The Money Box,” by William Wymark Jacobs, adapted by Jack Jevne and Charley Rogers) made a difference, or maybe it was Stan’s position as the official producer. I don’t know, but whatever it was, after seeing it I revised my contention that Way Out West and Sons of the Desert are the team’s best features and have added Our Relations to that short-list. Nearly everything about it works, from the long-lost-brothers/mistaken-identity plot, the crisp black-and-white cinematography by Rudolph Maté and Bert Jordan’s kinetic editing to the terrific supporting cast. This includes Alan Hale (Sr.) as a surly innkeeper, Sidney Toler (the future Charlie Chan) as the sailor set of Laurel and Hardys’ dyspeptic Navy Captain, Daphne Pollard as the landlubber Ollie’s easily-insulted wife, Betty Healy as Stan’s equally touchy helpmeet, Arthur Housman as a drunk (naturally), Iris Adrian and Lona Andre as a pair of mooching good-time girls and, supremely, James Finlayson as the sailor team’s nemesis. Although the Laurel and Hardy characters are essentially the same regardless of which twins they represent (Laurel is “Stan” and “Alf,” Hardy “Ollie” and “Bert”) their way with a comic line, a situation or a physical gag remains peerless, and there’s an equally hair-raising and uproarious sequence at the climax involving two sets of feet encased in pairs of concrete shoes careening wildly over a seaside dock that is (to 1936) the team’s funniest sequence since the pie-fight in The Battle of the Century.\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis (1944) is, I think, my favorite American movie about a happy family, and it seems more miraculous every time I see it. This portrait of the upper-middle-class Smiths from the summer of 1903 to the spring of 1904 and the opening of the St. Louis Exposition is intelligent, charming, wistful, engaging, poignant, expressive (and, during the Hallowe’en sequence, Expressionist), often very funny, and captures both the pains and pleasures of adolescence and as well the quotidian experience of a settled world poised delicately between the relative gentility of the 19th century and the coming hurly-burly of the 20th.\n\nThe Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! (1966) This adaptation by William Rose of the satirical Nathaniel Benchley novel The Off-Islanders is not only still surprisingly funny but also unsettlingly relevant, what with both Democrats and Republicans ratcheting up the seemingly unstoppable, Hillary Clinton-generated hysteria about the largest holder of nuclear weapons and Biden, Blinken and Sullivan — as unfunny a trio of stooges as ever fronted an American presidential administration — and NATO deliberately goading Vladimir Putin to a point where we are, for the first time since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, on the brink of apocalypse… and over the goddamned Ukraine. The Russians of Benchley’s 1961 satire are more thuggish generally than those in the movie (the junior officer played by Alan Arkin in the picture, for example, in the novel allows his crew to beat up a well-meaning islander he believes has led them on a wild-goose-chase) although Benchley makes clear near the end that the captain of the submarine accidentally stranded on a Massachusetts island sandbar is bluffing when he threatens to blow up the town, something his movie counterpart (Theodore Bikel) appears not only able but willing to do. Although many of the islanders in the novel are as silly as those in the movie, you get a strong feeling that the author is even more distrustful of the inadvertent invaders. The movie, made by good-hearted ’60s liberals, divides the insanity more equitably, and with a certain respect for the parameters of satire: Arkin’s Rozanov and Brian Keith’s sardonic police captain are the sanest characters in the movie, voices of reason between two opposing sets of lunatics, with the playwright portrayed by Carl Reiner (an invention of the screenwriter) and the young Russian sailor played by John Phillip Law reasonably close behind them in common sense. Nearly everyone else on both sides is certifiably nuts.\n\nRose, co-author with his wife Tania of the appalling It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, is in much better form here, although, perhaps inevitably, he borrows from himself, as when Reiner is reduced to pedaling a girl’s bicycle, like Jonathan Winters in Mad World. (Winters is here as well, as a blustery police deputy, but he’s no funnier in The Russians Are Coming… than he was in the previous movie. His particular genius as a comedian seems to have been too special for the movies, where he was always let down by the material.) The screenplay is half-Benchley, half-Rose, with some of the least apposite aspects of the former left out but some of the worst of the latter left in, like the heart-tugging finale with little Johnny Whitaker hanging, absurdly, from a church bell tower. Still, great swaths of the movie are hilariously funny, especially when the two male stars are on screen. Arkin gets to engage that patented shtick of his in which, like Gene Wilder later, his patience snaps and he not only shouts but raises his voice into his throat, and there’s a moment in an automobile where the despairing, disbelieving look he gives one of his fellow sailors kept me laughing for the next 10 minutes. Reiner meanwhile has a riotous series of scenes with Tessie O’Shea in which they are roped together and trying to escape their confinement which should be ranked among the funniest continuing gags in any sound comedy.\n\nNorman Jewison, who directed, keeps the pace spritely, at least until the last third when it sags a bit, and the picture has a wonderful cast of farceurs including Doro Merande, Parker Fennelly, Richard Schaal, Michael J. Pollard, Cliff Norton and the indispensable Paul Ford in the sort of (if this is not an oxymoron) pipsqueak-blowhard role he made his specialty. Ben Blue, as a drunken ersatz Paul Revere, has a series of scenes chasing his recalcitrant nag that get funnier and funnier but Eva Marie Saint is largely wasted as Reiner’s wife and their son, played by young Sheldon Golumb, is so obnoxious you cheer when Reiner instructs Saint to “feel free to hit him.” Joseph F. Biroc’s widescreen color photography is glorious, but aside from the performers the best thing about The Russians Are Coming… is the music by Johnny Mandel which constitutes one of the rare movie scores that is funny (or at any rate, witty) on its own without trying to sound funny, as when during Pablo Ferro’s clever main titles he juxtaposes a drum-and-fife rendition of “Yankee Doodle Dandy” with a Russian chorus lustily singing “Polyushko Pole” and “The Volga Boatmen Song.” Mandel later accompanies the sailors who’ve gone ashore to look for a boat to tow their sub off the sand with another amusing choral arrangement, this time of a Russian-language version of “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary.” This melodic joke caused one of the two literalist idiots on the Kino Lober Blu-ray commentary track to wonder why the sailors in the scene are singing it. Well, what can be expected of people who claim It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World is the greatest movie ever made?§\n\nInterestingly, Nathaniel Benchley, the son of Robert, was the father of another writer, one who also wrote a bestselling book about the invasion of an island off the East Coast. Unlike The Off-Islanders, however, Peter’s novel Jaws was only unintentionally funny.\n\nSpeedy (1928) Although Harold Lloyd is often spoken of in the same breath as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton I have to admit that up to now I have never seen one of his pictures, short or feature-length. It’s too early in my admittedly overdue exposure to Lloyd’s comedy to make any such assessment, and while I enjoyed Speedy enormously it isn’t nearly as funny as, say, The Gold Rush or The Navigator. Interestingly, there were two silent pictures in that last year before the talkies took over to stage long sequences at Coney Island; in Paul Fejös’ Lonesome, most of the action takes place there. Lloyd and company spend less time at the famous amusement park, but the time spent, as Spencer Tracey observes of Katharine Hepburn’s form in Pat and Mike, is cherce. Speedy also offers, in its Coney Island sequence, the first instance of a character in an American movie giving the finger, which Lloyd does to his own fun-house mirror reflection.\n\nThe character of Harold “Speedy” Swift is, I gather, the basic, bespectacled “go-getter” type Lloyd portrayed in his features, who is as assured of himself as Keaton is uncertain, and Lloyd is immensely appealing. In Speedy he’s a poor, baseball-obsessed ne’er-do-well flitting insouciantly from one job to another and who is forced by circumstance to operate the horse-drawn trolley the grandfather (Bob Woodruff) of his intended (Ann Christy) runs and which is a ruthless capitalist’s object of interest. The center of the picture, and its funniest stretch, is Speedy’s attempt to succeed as a taxi-cab driver, bedeviled by customers and cops alike. The build-up of circumstances and wildly funny sight-gags is so good, and so perfectly sustained, I wished the rest of the picture had measured up to it. The Criterion edition of Speedy contains a beautiful restoration of Walter Lundin’s excellent cinematography and features as well a lively score by the prodigious Carl Davis.\n\nThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938) Elsewhere in these digital pages I wrote about something once called the children’s matinee. During the summer of either 1969 or 1970 (I forget which) this David O. Selznick adaptation of the Mark Twain novel was one of the weekly entertainments on offer at the Mt. Vernon (Ohio) Theatre. I was pleasantly surprised, seeing it again in the restored Kino edition, at how much of it has stayed with me, and how many set-pieces I anticipated 50-plus years on. Chief among these is the sequence in the caverns, extraordinarily designed by William Cameron Menzies, spookily shot by James Won Howe and affectingly directed by Norman Taurog. (Menzies’ work here got him the job of production designer on Gone with the Wind.) For an early Technicolor job, this Tom Sawyer is a visual treat, although not nearly as remarkable-looking as Selznick’s GWTW would be a year later. The screenplay by John V.A. Weaver is a good one, retaining much of what makes Twain’s book so beloved of, as they used to say, children of all ages and leaving out very little of consequence and the art direction by Lyle R. Wheeler, the costumes by Walter Plunkett and the set decoration by Casey Roberts together place you absolutely in 1940s Missouri. (I realize that what I just wrote contradicts my usual cavils against literary adaptation, but the loss of Twain’s voice in a movie of Tom Sawyer is not as grievous as the elimination of Huck’s narration, and his observations, in corresponding film editions of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.)\n\nTommy Kelly, the choice for Tom after a Selznick-ballyhooed “nationwide search” not unlike the one he mounted for Scarlett O’Hara, gives a convincing performance, and looks the part, right down to his curly hair (it’s himself Twain was writing about with Tom) but someone apparently instructed him to mug self-consciously, and it’s an annoying affection that mars his otherwise rather good portrayal. Jackie Moran makes a fine Huckleberry Finn, Walter Brennan a likeable Muff Potter, David Holt a thoroughly despicable Sid Sawyer, Mickey Rentschler a pleasant Joe Harper and Philip Hurlic an adorable Little Jim. Although she is perhaps too stern an Aunt Polly, there is much in May Robson’s performance to treasure, not least the moment with the bark note when she realizes Tom has been telling her the truth. I know I am courting censure here (so what else is new?) by invoking Injun Joe, whose very name has doubtless been scrubbed from or sanitized in current print editions of Tom Sawyer, but Victor Jory’s performance — indeed, his very look — was the stuff of my pre-pubescent nightmares, never forgotten.\n\nI have read some critical objections to the physical humor in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer but the gags seem to me entirely of a piece with the story and the characters, especially as so many of them involve Tom getting his little revenges on the obsequious, toadying Sid. The last such event in the movie may not come directly out of Twain but it satisfies its audience completely. At least it satisfies me. I like to think it might also have made Sam Clemens chuckle.\n\n*I first saw this footage as a fifth grader, in an educational movie about the 1930s, and the wet, forlorn faces of abandoned dogs and cats has haunted me ever since.\n\n†Another name ruined for me by pop culture, this time Lily Tomlin’s telephone operator Ernestine, who once had a memorable voice encounter with the man she referred to as “Jedgar.”\n\n‡There was worse to come: Blacklisted for his social activism, Lee was scheduled to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and died, at 45, before he could testify.\n\n§This pair of movie “experts” likewise ignorantly claim that the name of Paul Ford’s character, Fendall Hawkins, “is a William Rose name.” It isn’t; it’s Benchley’s. The name, like the character, comes right out of the book.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews (&cet.)\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) I began the new year on a hopeful note, watching the excellent 4K UHD edition of what in 1977 was the single most entrancing movie I’d ever seen and which still exerts a beautiful spell over me.\n\nI would like to think my other hopes for 2024 will not be betrayed, but short of worldwide revolution I suspect they will. As Tom Woods once noted (Woods’ Law #3): “No matter who you vote for, you always wind up getting John McCain.”\n\nFrom Here to Eternity (1953) James Jones’ enormous (860 pages) 1951 novel, beautifully adapted by Daniel Taradash and directed with sensitivity and grace by the splendid Fred Zinnemann. Set in and around Pearl Harbor in the months leading up to the Japanese attack and, essentially, ending on it, the picture is (presumably like its source) remarkably and unusually adult in erotic/romantic content* and, to use a word I normally avoid due to its extreme overuse, powerful in its imagery. Example: The famous love scene on the shore between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, kissing passionately as the waves break over them. That Kerr’s character is a married woman and her affair with Lancaster’s career soldier illicit (her husband, his commanding officer, is a serially unfaithful pig) added to the heat the sequence generated, yet few seem to remember how bitterly the scene ends, with Lancaster humiliating Kerr and impugning her virtue.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity, even more than A Place in the Sun, showcases Montgomery Clift’s gifts as an actor although his character is, at least to me, inexplicable: A young man planning on a career as a soldier who claims to love the Army yet who makes a habit of rebelling against his superior officers. Still, Prewitt is perhaps the Clift character who displays the greatest range of emotions, from the riant to the deeply sorrowful, and I defy you to remain unmoved when, with tears streaming down his cheeks, he plays “Taps” in honor of his murdered friend. As that friend, Private Maggio, Frank Sinatra is superb. Forget the Mario Puzo version of his casting†; Sinatra knew the role reflected his image of himself, and he gave himself over to it entirely, perhaps reminding those who know such things that a great ballad singer is also, perforce, a great actor. Lancaster too gives a fine account of the First Sergeant with no desire for promotion and the central women — Kerr and Donna Reed — are equally fine, Kerr even producing a more than creditable American accent and Reed giving a performance no one expected her capable of, including Zinnemann, who had accepted her casting with reservations.\n\nAlthough the movie pushed at the edges of the Production Code in regard to sexual relations there was some inevitable bowdlerization: Thus, the brothel Reed’s character works in was changed to a dance-hall, yet I doubt many people who saw the picture in 1953 had any difficulty figuring out that the girl was a whore. In exchange for being permitted to shoot at Schofield Barracks, however, the filmmakers had to compromise on some of Jones’ harsher material, especially in the matter of Maggio’s “treatment” at the hands of the sadistic stockade commander “Fatso” Judson (Ernest Borgnine). In the event, Zinnemann’s being made to eschew depicting the violence against Maggio may be in the movie’s favor, since we’re forced to imagine what’s been done to him, making his death scene after he escapes all the more poignant; Fatso’s own violent death is depicted aslant, making us wonder at the outcome of his fight with Prewitt until the latter emerges from the shadows. Taradash’s screenplay is marked by its intelligence, and the black-and-white cinematography, the work of Burnett Guffey, is exemplary. The head of Columbia, the monstrous Harry Cohn, initially insisted on color but Zinnemann prevailed, and the movie benefits from this, the monochrome images shimmering on the screen. (Among other pictures, Guffey, who had been in movies since 1928, later shot Bonnie and Clyde. That should give you an idea of how good he was.) The fine supporting cast includes Philip Ober as Kerr’s philandering martinet of a husband, Mickey Shaughnessy, Jack Warden, Merle Travis as a blues-singing Private, Claude Akins as one of the bullies who tries to break Clift and, in an uncredited role, the future screenwriter Alvin Sargent, who endures a shocking death by Japanese tracer-fire.\n\nThere was, by the way, a hilarious spoof of From Here to Eternity on “Your Show of Shows,” in which the Lancaster and Clift characters were more or less combined, as were Kerr’s and Young’s. The beach scene was brilliantly parodied, with Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca getting periodically doused with what are pretty obviously buckets of water thrown at them from unseen stagehands. It gets funnier and funnier. It even got to Coca, who seldom cracked on camera but who pretty much loses it here, turning her head and burying her face on Caesar’s shoulder to hide her hysteria from the audience.\n\nCarefree (1938) The seventh teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is the slightest of their RKO musicals, the first to lose money, and the one with the least dancing. Another of those pictures whose complicated screenwriting credits betray a certain amount of panic (the script was by Allan Scott and Ernest Pagano from an “original idea” by Marian Ainslee and Guy Endore, its “story and adaptation” by the redoubtable Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde, credited that same year with Bringing Up Baby) the picture casts Astaire as a dancing psychoanalyst trying to break through Rogers’ resistance to marrying Ralph Bellamy (it takes a shrink to figure that out?) and in the process falling for her himself. There are some good lines and funny situations, as when Ginger, a radio singer, wrecks her own live show under hypnosis, but there are also items that make you squirm, such as the way, again having been hypnotized, she hunts Astaire down with a shotgun, repeatedly proclaiming that “men like him should be shot down like dogs.” Fun-nee!\n\nAdding to the troubles are an ill-conceived dream sequence set to one of Irving Berlin’s less interesting tunes, which by its conception demanded to be filmed in color but which RKO refused to do, making a hash of a song Berlin pointedly called “I Used to Be Color Blind.” (It also contains a slow-motion dance, a device I resist on principle, and a prolonged kiss between Fred and Ginger, which is just plain objectionable.) There’s an extended New Dance Sensation called “The Yam,” whose melody Berlin later adapted for his war-time anthem “Any Bonds Today?” and which illustrates that a certain degree of democratization in the Astaire and Rogers universe is unwelcome; instead of those gleaming, absurd but oddly endearing white Art Deco sets complete with extras in evening dress that were the series’ mainstay from Flying Down to Rio through Swing Time we’re in a woodsy country club with patrons joining in the dance, and who wants that? Fortunately, Fred and Ginger get a good Berlin ballad (“Change Partners”) and subsequent dance routine in which he uses his big, expressive hands in an attempt to re-hypnotize her. Even better, Astaire has a jaw-dropping bit, set to a wordless tune (“Since They Turned ‘Loch Lomond’ into Swing”) in which he rhythmically hits one golf ball after another, sending every one of them soaring in perfect arcs, the entire routine performed in long, sustained camera shots. Was there nothing the man couldn’t do?\n\nLove Among the Ruins (1975) This charming, witty period comedy by James Costigan, although admired, was, somewhat surprisingly, not a ratings success. (I was watching the filmed version of George Furth’s play Twigs starring Carol Burnett that night, and I remember that deciding which to see between these two nearly engendered the 14-year-old’s equivalent of a nervous breakdown.) Despite its low viewer rating, the picture won multiple Emmys, losing only in the “Outstanding Special” category, to a TV-movie starring Judd Hirsch called “The Law,” which seems to have vanished into obscurity. I don’t know whether its author originally intended it as a play — Costigan proposed it as a 1960s television project for Lunt and Fontanne, who apparently objected to being likened to ruins and withdrew — but it feels like a stage comedy, with few scenes occurring on the London streets and most set in drawing rooms, the Old Bailey or the Inns of Court and the action rising as it might in a boulevard comedy. In any case, the dialogue sparkles with graceful aperçus, in a fashion that recalls the stage plays of Wilde and Coward and S.N. Behrman, and the stars, Laurence Olivier and Katharine Hepburn, parry and thrust with their lines like the expert verbal and dramatic fencers they were.\n\nOlivier was so often touted, in those years, as The World’s Greatest Actor, and accepted in that designation by people who had never seen him, that it was perhaps easy to forget what a superb comedian he was (although his performance opposite Michael Caine in the 1972 two-hander Sleuth should have reminded audiences of that). He’s especially funny in outrage, to which Hepburn’s maddening character repeatedly drives him; when he opens his eyes wide or screws up his face in disbelief as his voice rises to a sort of half-strangled masculine screech and his words pile up in a heated rush, he’s one of the premiere screen comedians of his age and weight. Hepburn’s role is perhaps less showy, but because we know what she refuses to reveal, until the climax anyway, her characterization becomes fascinating, an onion that resolutely refuses to be peeled. There are two wonderful supporting turns, by Colin Blakely as Olivier’s courtroom rival and Richard Pearson as Hepburn’s solicitor, and the director, Hepburn’s old friend and crony George Cukor, keeps the pace and the performances clicking along brightly. Douglas Slocombe’s photography, like John Barry’s delightful score, is exactly what is required, although you will undoubtedly notice how assiduously he protected the aging Hepburn, who seems shot not just through gauze but gauze, Vaseline and perhaps lace curtains as well.\n\nMissing (1982) The exceptional adaptation by Costa-Gavras and Donald E. Stewart of Thomas Hauser’s book on the political arrest, torture and murder of a young American in Chile for the crime of told told too much, superbly acted by Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek. The talented cast also includes Melanie Mayron, John Shea (as Charles “Charlie” Horman, the murdered man), Charles Cioffi as a creepy Naval Captain, David Clennon, Richard Venture (as the thinly-disguised Ambassador Nathanial Davis), Joe Regalbuto (as another murdered American), Keith Szarabajka and Janice Rule, as a reporter helpful to both the victim and his survivors… imagine.\n\nThe Cameraman (1928) A very funny Buster Keaton feature, his last under a new contract with MGM in which he had any level of autonomy. Although the picture was popular, the studio was determined to clamp down on Keaton’s independence; he later called his signing with Metro “the worst mistake of my life.” Buster, who also produced, stars as a New York City tintype portrait photographer who realizes (in 1928!) that the motion-picture camera is making his profession obsolete. Some of the movie’s brightest moments have little or nothing to do with the plot, such as Keaton’s impromptu pantomime of a baseball game, his riding on the outside of an omnibus and his experience at a communal swimming pool, although I don’t find the sequence in which he has to share a tiny dressing space with an overbearing Edward Brophy funny because I am constitutionally incapable of laughing at bullies, or at the trouble they cause their victims. (Maybe that’s why I’ve always been uneasy about Donald Duck?) Edward Sedgwick was the director, and the story is credited to Clyde Bruckman and Lew Lipton, but on a Keaton picture that doesn’t mean much. (The story was his and, I assume, most of the gags.) Marceline Day is charming as Buster’s inamorata, and the simian “Josephine” is wonderful as the monkey he inadvertently picks up while filming a violent tong war in an otherwise remarkably non-stereotyped Chinatown.\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) A nearly perfect Disney feature, at the time the most modern full-length cartoon the studio had ever released and among the six or seven best hand-drawn movies Walt’s animators produced in his lifetime.\n\nThe Third Man (1949) In the interviews that make up their book This is Orson Welles, Welles defined Harry Lime as a great “star part,” comparing it to a 1913 stage play called Mr. Wu in which Wu (whom Welles claimed he once played in the theatre) is discussed by the other characters for an entire act. Just before intermission a figure enters and intones, “I am Mr. Wu…”, leading the audience, buzzing between the acts, to marvel at that wonderful actor who plays Mr. Wu! Harry is discussed by everyone in The Third Man for over 50 minutes before Welles’ famous entrance in the dark of the Vienna night, supposedly revealed by a single light from a window across the street — it must have been the Luxor Lamp of post-war lightbulbs — during which he smiles wryly at getting caught, seemingly abashed by his own irresistible theatricality. Graham Greene’s divided-city mystery/thriller, his most famous “entertainment,” was wonderfully (if somewhat floridly) directed by Carol Reed and contained more memorable moments in its 104 minutes than any comparable popular movie since Casablanca, another romantic melodrama set in a turbulent time and place.\n\nHow to Murder Your Wife (1965) George Axelrod’s black comedy of misogyny divided a lot of opinion in 1965 and it’s impossible to imagine anyone making it today, or even thinking about doing so, even if it does wind up by endorsing marriage and women equally. Jack Lemmon plays the confirmed bachelor unexpectedly wed, after a drunken debauch, to the former inhabitant of a bachelor-party cake (Virna Lisi) who cannot speak a word of English. Although Lemmon responds all too enthusiastically to the more sybaritic aspects of marital life, the whole business quickly palls and he begins to fantasize a way out, at least for his successful spy comic-strip star Brash Brannigan, whom he has also married off. The picture is broad and, when Lemmon is put on trial for murder at the climax, just plain silly (no one thinks to look for Lisi’s body?) It’s also, despite the odds, very funny. Richard Quine directed with good pace, Harry Stradling’s color cinematography is mouth-watering, and in his infectious musical score Neal Hefti develops at least six distinct, complete melodies. Eddie Mayehoff gives his standard hilarious characterization as Lemmon’s lawyer, Claire Trevor is surprisingly arch as his wife, and Terry-Thomas is a wonder as Lemmon’s butler. Among the comedians in the rich supporting cast: Sidney Blackmer, Jack Albertson (“Brrrrtt! Right up the wall!”), Max Showalter, Alan Hewitt, Mary Wickes, Howard Wendell and Khigh Dhiegh. Actually, I don’t think the movie is misogynist as much as it is anti-marriage, or at any rate, anti-wife. Does that make it any less offensive to women? Probably not, but it still makes me laugh.\n\nThe Yakuza (1974) An interesting exercise in East-West tensions refracted through the traditional Japanese yakuza gangland thriller. The picture suffers from too much exposition, badly handled both by the writers (Paul Schrader and Robert Towne,‡ from a story by Leonard Schrader) and the director (Sydney Pollack), and Pollack’s refusal to use English subtitles renders long dialogue sequences featuring Ken Takakura utterly incomprehensible to a non-Japanese speaker. (To see what you’re missing, turn on the Blu-ray’s subtitle feature.) Yet it’s fascinating to watch, particularly with Robert Mitchum in the American lead. Mitchum plays a man in love with Japan, whose post-war experience during the American occupation — which of course has never ended — left him bereft of the love of his life when he crossed her brother (Takakura). It’s a stylish movie, beautifully shot in widescreen by Kozo Okazaki, which despite my reservations about Pollack as a filmmaker I must admit he was highly skilled in framing.§ Dave Grusin provided a fine, atmospheric musical score and the cast contains riches: Takakura, at once stoic and almost shockingly adept with a sword; Herb Edelman as Mitchum’s old pal, an American who put down roots in Tokyo; Keiko Kishi as Mitchum’s great love; and Brian Keith as his employer, who is not as trustworthy a crook as he wishes his compatriots to believe. As Mitchum’s bodyguard, Richard Jordan gives the sort of total performance that causes you to wonder how a young man that handsome, and that accomplished, never became an important actor in American movies. James Shigeta, who improved every picture he was in just by showing up, plays Takakura’s sage, and quietly dangerous, older brother. What stays with you about The Yakuza is its expression of psychic pain; nearly every character in it is in some kind of agony, and they keep visiting it on each other without meaning to, which in turn makes that pain equally unbearable to the one who causes it.\n\nThe Dark Horse (1932) A very amusing political satire, something American movies used to turn out on a regular basis but which the toxic partisanship of modern life has rendered entirely off-limits. (You can still write a satire, but if it doesn’t target Republicans, leftists or the non-aligned, good luck getting it produced.) Warren William plays what we would now call a political consultant, a fast-talking con artist who is let loose on a corrupt gubernatorial campaign and catapults a complete nonentity into the governor’s mansion. My revealing the ending will in no way mitigate your enjoyment of this sharp, cynical exercise which features the young Bette Davis as Williams’ inamorata, Vivienne Osborne as an ex-wife with the soul of an adding machine, Frank McHugh as an eager political operative and the genial Guy Kibbee as the unlikely candidate, of whom William memorably observes, “He’s the dumbest human being I ever saw. Every time he opens his mouth he subtracts from the sum total of human knowledge.”\n\nThat line sounds like the work of Wilson Mizner, who wrote the screenplay with Joseph Jackson. Wilson and his brother Addison were the subject of an aborted Irving Berlin musical in the 1950s and, many decades later, emerged on the stage in Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman’s later project, which went under several titles over a number of years (Wise Guys, Gold!, Bounce and, finally, Road Show). The director of The Dark Horse, Alfred E. Green, began in pictures in 1916, eventually guiding Colleen Moore in eight of her vehicles including Sally (1925), Irene and Ella Cinders (both 1926). He also made three with George Arliss including Disraeli (1929) and The Green Goddess (1930); the somewhat notorious Baby Face (1933) starring Barbara Stanwyck; Dangerous (1935), which won Davis an apology Oscar; the Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland musical Thoroughbreds Don’t Cry (1937); and The Gracie Allen Murder Case (1939), a Philo Vance vehicle also starring Warren William. His work on The Dark Horse is fast and clean, and the sharp black-and-white cinematography was by Sam Polito. For those interested in trivia, the Blackfoot Chief who gives Kibbee a ceremonial headdress is played by Jim Thorpe.\n\nThanks once again to my perspicacious friend Eliot M. Camarena for the recommendation!\n\n*I understand that Jones’ editors or publisher demanded he remove some homosexual content from the original manuscript of his novel, which his heirs returned to a recent edition. Not having read the novel I have no idea what this may entail, although the author was allegedly (i.e., according to a Wikipedia entry) open about his own sexual experiences in that area.\n\n†The truth of Sinatra’s casting was less dramatic, but nearly as grubby: he was pestering his wife Ava Gardner on the African location of John Ford’s Mogambo, and to get him out of her hair (and to allow her to philander in peace) she allegedly insisted that Cohn use him as Maggio.\n\n‡If Towne is present, can Edward Taylor be far behind?\n\n§On the Yakuza commentary Pollack says he gave up shooting in widescreen, which he loved, once he realized how badly his pictures were being cropped, and panned-and-scanned, for home video. He wasn’t alone.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe Dark Crystal (1982) This Jim Henson/Franz Oz collaboration was visually impressive and dramatically anemic in 1982, and the passage of four decades has not diminished the former nor improved the latter. Its David Odell screenplay (from a screen story by Henson) is an oleo of warmed-over Tolkein crossed with Henson’s old ”Land of Gorch” sketches for “Saturday Night.” The picture is short on both humor and wonder, although the puppetry is, as usual for Henson, beautifully designed and managed. It’s essentially Elves vs. Orcs for control of the future, with the Orcs represented by vulture-like creatures called Skeksis, and the outcome is never in doubt. Since there is no suspense, and the characters are defined more by what species they are than by what they say or do, there’s little to occupy either mind or heart. (The most interesting characters are the astronomer Aughra, whose voice was provided by Billie Whitelaw, and the Skeksis Chamberlain skekSil, voiced by Barry Dennen.) It’s certainly worth seeing once, for the puppet designs and for Oswald Morris’ richly textured photography. The recent 4K UHD edition is sumptuous-looking.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee (1935) After their brief duet on “The Carioca” in Flying Down to Rio set up a public clamor for more, a re-teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers by RKO was inevitable. Their first starring vehicle was an adaptation of Astaire’s last Broadway success (The Gay Divorce, a title apparently taboo under the Production Code) and in the blinkered tradition of Hollywood studio lunacy the entire Cole Porter stage score was tossed with the exception of “Night and Day,” its biggest hit. Although the movie isn’t as buoyant as the team’s best work it’s a lively picture, funny, absurd and engaging. It also sets the template for the Astaire-Rogers series: Initial dislike of Fred by Ginger (or like followed by misunderstanding leading to dislike, or some other variation on the theme), cast of wacky supporting actors (such as Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Erik Rhodes, the wisecracking Helen Broderick or, here, the charming Alice Brady), screwball complications, a romantic dance and, if we’re lucky, a challenge. I’m one of those oddballs — Pauline Kael was another — who prefer the non-romantic Fred & Ginger routines to their more celebrated ballroom turns, except (as in Follow the Fleet and Swing Time) when the duets are dramatic. Many think the essence of Astaire and Rogers are items like “Cheek to Cheek” and, here, “Night and Day,” and they’re marvelous expressions of romance but they don’t, at least for me, carry the absolute joy of “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” “Let Yourself Go” and “Pick Yourself Up”… the latter pair of which, juxtaposed that way, sound like an answer in one of those ironic double-feature puzzles. Dances like those sum up the appeal of Astaire and Rogers as a team far more than the formal love-duets; although they, like the ballroom dances, were thoroughly worked out, they feel spontaneous in a way the romantic dances never can. You get a sense, despite the sweat, of the joy of performance in “Isn’t it a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain?),” for example, and despite Astaire’s displeasure at being part of a team again after his sister Adele broke up the act, of the pleasure each performer took in the other.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee was directed by Mark Sandrich, who guided Astaire and Rogers in more pictures than anyone else, and his crisp style is as much a part of the team’s work as those white Art Deco sets and the loopy plots, usually cobbled by Allan Scott or Dwight Taylor. (This one was written by by George Marion Jr., Dorothy Yost and Edward Kaufman, but the original stage book was by Taylor.) David Abel’s beautiful cinematography, evident here, was on display in five of the nine pictures Astaire and Rogers made together at RKO as well as Holiday Inn, also directed by Sandrich. In this initial offering, the producers (or producer, since Pardo S. Berman was credited) hadn’t yet grasped that Astaire and Rogers were what people wanted to see, not elaborate musical numbers with a cast of thousands, so we get “The Continental” for 17 exhausting minutes, only a few of which are given over to Ginger and Fred. Worse, the creators assigned an entirely extraneous number to Edward Everett Horton(!) and a young Betty Grable, “Let’s K-nock K-nees,” which when I see it always makes me think of Arlene Croce’s riposte in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book: “Must we?” The “Night and Day” dance, on the other hand, based on the stage version choreographed by Fred, is one of the duets people who love the team remember best, and it’s beautifully worked out. The picture ends with another of Fred’s cleverly conceived dances from the stage show, in which he and Rogers sail over the sofas and chairs of his hotel suite, and it’s so casually charming it makes you grin in deep appreciation.\n\nA personal note: I first saw The Gay Divocee at a summer afternoon library screening about 40 years ago. Seated behind my friend and me were a pair of elderly Jewish women, complete with Molly Picon accents. When the picture began with nightclub patrons, including Fred, playing with little legless dolls through which their forefingers were inserted to make them “dance,” one of the women cooed happily to her companion, “Cute!… is that cute?”\n\nI can never see this movie without recalling the pleasure my friend and I got from that, at that moment and for years afterward in the remembering.\n\nTwilight’s Last Gleaming (1977) A very effective nuclear-nightmare thriller directed by Robert Aldrich which did not find much love when it was released but which deserves a far wider audience. Based by Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch on a good early ’70s novel by the reliable Walter Wager the story, about a band of escaped convicts led by a former Army general who take over a missile launching site, while far-fetched, is taut and tidy and builds nicely to its unexpected conclusion. Burt Lancaster is the general (of course) and his gang includes the always-wonderful Paul Winfield and a typically weaselly Burt Young. On the government side are the unmatchable Melvyn Douglas as the Secretary of Defense, Joseph Cotten as the Secretary of State, Richard Widmark as a duplicitous Air Force general, the excellent Gerald S. O’Loughlin as the White House chief of staff, and Charles Durning as the president. The part was offered to Henry Fonda, who passed, and Durning not only delivers a superb performance, but the role turns out to be the great one of the picture.\n\nCohen and Huebsch cannily upped the ante for Lancaster, making what in Wager is merely a bid for money and freedom far more selfless and democratically sound (the general becomes a kind of Ellsberg figure), making the climax both shocking and inevitable. Aldrich, whose direction seems to me ideal for a movie of this kind, makes extensive use of split-screen throughout the picture, feeling that “you couldn’t tell that story in less than three hours without them.” There are times when the split-screens feel excessive, although it’s possible they would seem less so on a big theater screen. Yet they’re brilliantly manipulated overall, and even when the dialogue in one panel overlaps with that in another, you never miss who is speaking or what is being said; as with Howard Hawks’ overlapping dialogue, nothing of importance is lost. The movie’s crystalline cinematography is by Robert B. Hauser, the kinetic editing is by Michael Luciano, William Martin and Maury Winetrobe and Jerry Goldsmith provided a brief but very effective musical score. The terrific supporting cast includes Richard Jaeckel, William Marshall, Leif Erickson, Charles Aidman, Charles McGraw, John Ratzenberger and, in too brief a role, Roscoe Lee Browne.\n\nRoberta (1935) Such were the vagaries of the 1930s Hollywood studio system that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, fresh from their triumph in The Gay Divorcee, were cast as supporting characters in this adaptation of the Jerome Kern/Otto Harbach stage musical. One doesn’t mind so much that their over-the-title co-star is the charming Irene Dunne; that Randolph Scott is given equal weight is practically an offense against God and Mammon. His performance in this, and in the subsequent Follow the Fleet (see below) leave one to marvel that he ever had an important career, or that he may have been the love of Cary Grant’s young life. I hope at least he was good in bed, because he certainly stinks up this movie.\n\nWhen Fred and Ginger are on screen, or Helen Westley as Dunne’s eponymous dress-designing aunt, or Dunne herself is singing “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” Roberta is first-rate entertainment. So let’s concentrate on those strengths, shall we, and forget if we can Scott’s performance and the number of times he says something is “swell”? Fred plays a bandleader, and gets a lively number (“Let’s Begin”) with his musicians, notably Candy Candido, with whom he does a kind of genderfuck bit avant la lettre. Ginger is Fred’s American former girlfriend, passing herself off as a Polish countess (I’m not kidding) in Paris. Although Astaire and Rogers do one of their ballroom specialties, to “Lovely to Look At” and “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” their two other numbers are a lot more fun: The satirical “I Won’t Dance” and “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” one of those joyous episodes of thoroughly worked-out yet seemingly impromptu hoofing that were, even more than their signature romantic duets, their peculiar specialty. On the debit side, Dunne has to perform “Yesterdays,” featuring one of Harbach’s worst sets of lyrics. No singer, not even one as lyrical as Irene Dunne, can be expected to triumph with lyrics like,\n\nYesterdays\n\nDays I knew as happy sweet\n\nSequestered days […]\n\nThen gay youth was mine\n\nAnd truth was mine\n\nJoyous free and flaming life\n\nForsooth was mine\n\nWho in the 1930s talked like that, let alone sang? That last bit is so convoluted and linguistically passé it occasioned one of Billie Holiday’s few recorded lyric flubs.\n\nWilliam A. Seiter, most of whose pictures were mediocrities, directed with intelligence and a certain gracefulness of style that does what it can to make the material seem more interesting than it is. Alan Scott was one of the three credited screenwriters, and the author of the movie’s “additional dialogue” was the same Glenn Tryon who starred in the 1926 silent comedy 45 Minutes from Hollywood, with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in brief cameos, and who would go on to star in two movies (Lonesome and Broadway) for the expressionistic Hungarian director Paul Fejos before drifting into screenwriting and direction.\n\nBetty Boop: The Essential Collection, Volume I – IV (1930 – 1938) These four Blu-Rays from the sadly now defunct Olive Films represent both the best of the series produced by Max Fleischer and directed by his brother Dave, and the worst. The Fleischers weren’t entirely to blame for the decline of the Betty Boop cartoons; once the Production Code went into full force, Betty was made less sexy and more respectable, and it killed her character: Her innocent sexuality was what made her so appealing; without that she had no real reason for being. External pressures to one side, there is absolutely no excuse for items like the 1937 Betty and Grampy short Zula Hula with its astonishingly crude and insensitive African caricatures. The Fleischers have been criticized for things like turning Louis Armstrong into a cartoon cannibal chasing Bimbo and Koko the Clown in I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead, You Rascal You (1932) but the natives in Zula Hula are offensive beyond my ability to comprehend the why of them. You could almost forgive that if the damn thing was funny, but none of the later Boops is amusing in the slightest. It was as if, having been robbed of the slight, daring whiff of salaciousness that clung to Betty’s character, the Fleischers didn’t know what the hell to do with her. The animation in the shorts continued to be exceptional, but what good is that if you aren’t laughing?\n\nFortunately the discs contain all the great Betty Boop cartoons from the early ’30s, when the Fleischers’ invention, sense of humor and casual surrealism were in their glory. (Speaking of stereotypes: There are several “pansy” gags in the Bettys; when a Frankenstein monster threatens her in Betty Boop’s Penthouse and she hits him with plant spray he turns first into a ballet dancer and then into a literal pansy.) One of the visual aspects of the Boop shorts I like best are the thick, Art Nouveau lines around the characters; it gives them a distinctive look that can’t be mistaken for the product of any other studio. The Fleischers were enamored of the Rotoscope technique Max had developed and used it, I think, excessively. This is nowhere better illustrated than in the 1938 Thrills and Chills, in which when Betty skates on the ice she becomes weirdly elongated, and it’s obvious her head and body have been drawn over those of a live model… and the business just goes on and on, as if Dave was so in love with the process he just couldn’t stop Rotoscoping.\n\nJust as Disney and Ub Iwerks were the products of their Midwestern upbringings, the Fleischers were New York to their core. That’s reflected not only in the daring sexiness of the shorts but in their soundtracks, which not only tend to the jazzy; several times they employ jazz and swing musicians, especially Cab Calloway, who is in three Betty Boop cartoons, cleverly Rotoscoped. In the bizarre Minnie the Moocher (1932) he appears as a walrus with a bobtail; in the fantastic The Old Man of the Mountain (1933) he’s the eponymous villain; and in what may be the single best entry in the series, the 1933 Snow-White, the Wicked Queen in her witch guise transforms Koko into a ghost with long human legs who dances to “Saint James Infirmary” via Calloway’s hip vocal and trademark sliding movements. Other disc highlights: The wildly surrealistic Bimbo’s Initiation (1931) satirizing fraternity rites; the clever Stop That Noise (1935); the two-strip Technicolor Poor Cinderella (1934) featuring Max’s beloved 3D effects, achieved through the use of small motorized sets against which the animated drawings were superimposed; the charming Parade of the Wooden Soldiers (1934); the melodrama spoof She Wronged Him Right (1934); and Betty Boop’s Bizzy Bee (1932) in which she runs a diner whose sole menu item seems to be hotcakes.\n\nSunset (1988) An amiable pastiche written and directed by Blake Edwards (based on unpublished manuscript by Rod Amateau) set in late-1920s Hollywood and teaming Wyatt Earp and Tom Mix to investigate a murder mystery involving studio power, gangsters and the fabled corrupt Los Angeles law enforcement James Ellroy has built a career on. That Earp is played by James Garner and Mix by Bruce Willis, on the cusp of his Die Hard stardom, is a good indication of the charm factor attending this slight but most enjoyable fantasia from one of the last great American purveyors of pleasure at the movies.\n\nGarner had played Earp 20 years earlier, in the post-OK Corral The Hour of the Gun, and it was bitter portraiture, grim and obsessive. The Earp of Sunset is more mellow if no less tough and determined and Garner gives the sort of relaxed, intensely likable performance that had become his personal metier, nicely matched by Willis’ laconic good humor. The autumnal cinematography was the work of Anthony B. Richmond, Henry Mancini provided a tuneful, engaging musical score, and the rich supporting cast includes Mariel Hemingway, Kathleen Quinlan, the director’s daughter Jennifer Edwards, Richard Bradford, M. Emmet Walsh, Joe Dallesandro, Dann Florek, Dermot Mulroney, the wonderful Patricia Hodge as the wronged woman in the case and Malcolm McDowell as her shady, dangerous husband. A truly sick character, McDowell’s is perhaps the ultimate creative expression of the difference between a beloved public clown and his dark private persona. Edwards, who had directed Peter Sellers in six pictures, had been around Hollywood for decades and who suffered throughout his life his own periods of debilitating depression — not for nothing was he known by his friends as “Blackie” — knew that comedy produces more than its share of unusually disturbed individuals.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Earp really did serve as a technical advisor in Hollywood, for Mix and others.\n\nThe Last Picture Show (1971) Criterion’s new 4K UHD edition of Peter Bogdanovich’s 1992 Director’s Cut convinces me that this rich evocation by the filmmaker and Larry McMurtry of the latter’s early novel depicting adolescence in a blighted 1950s Texas town is not only among the finest of all American movies of the 1970s but quite possibly Bogdanovich’s best work.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941) John Huston’s debut as a screenwriter-director and the second important step in Humphrey Bogart’s ascendancy to stardom following High Sierra retains its status as one of the most perfect entertainments of the studio era. The “Warner 100” 4K UHD edition brings out of the rich quality of Arthur Edeson’s already sumptuous lighting.\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) Another old favorite revisited in its recent 4K UHD restoration. Last year’s 4K Cinderella unaccountably destroyed the beauty of Marc Davis’ miraculous rendering of its heroine’s fairy-dust transformation before the ball. This version of Snow White on the other hand is mouth-watering, the movie’s already remarkable look burnished and enhanced by the process.\n\nTexasville (1990; Black-and-White Director’s Cut) Included on the new Criterion edition of The Last Picture Show, this warm-hearted sequel is presented in the form its director envisioned; In black-and-white, and lengthened by nearly 30 minutes, deepening the relationships and bringing out more of its comic values.\n\nTop Hat (1935) No one should be forced to choose a single Astaire-Rogers musical, and I am always torn between this one and Swing Time. Top Hat is probably the better movie: it’s swifter, more sparkling, lays some nice emphasis on those two incomparable sissies Eric Blore and Edward Everett Horton, and boasts a perfect Irving Berlin score including a title song that elegantly sums up the appeal of Fred Astaire, whom Graham Greene once called the human equivalent of Mickey Mouse. That isn’t the insult it seems; in the early ‘30s Mickey was not yet the figure of dull respectability he became; he was rambunctious, elastic, mischievous, even slightly cruel — just like Fred.\n\nPerhaps inspired by their “Let Yourself Go” duet in Follow the Fleet Astaire and Rogers also get a challenge-dance here to “Isn’t This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain?)” that is not only among their half-dozen or so best routines, it’s also a rapturous expression of the sheer joy of performance. If these two didn’t fall in love after a number like that, one of them would have to be frigid and the other gay. After the requisite complications, masquerades and misunderstandings, the pair performs Berlin’s lilting, sensuous “Cheek to Cheek” in a Venice ballroom and featuring Ginger’s feathered dress which, although it drove her partner to distraction, proved that she understood what looked best on her when she danced with him; and another of those new dance sensations, “The Piccolino,” led off by Ginger’s charming verse and chorus. This brings me to a side-note: However wonderful a performer Fred Astaire was — and aside from his status as the finest dancer the movies have ever known he was also one of the American songbook’s great stylists — compare the way he listens to Ginger singing with the way in which she takes in his vocalizations: He smiles a lot but looks faintly glazed; she hangs on every word whether she’s facing him or not, and always seems to be hearing them for the first time. She not only (in the cartoonist Bob Thaves’ memorable phrase) “did everything Fred did, backwards and in heels”; at times she also acted him off the screen.\n\nAll of the members of the RKO Astaire-Rogers machine were involved here: The producer Pando S. Berman; the director Mark Sandrich (he made five of their pictures, and his style is modest but elegant and his pacing is nearly always perfect); the screenwriters Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor; the cinematographer David Abel, whose polished black-and-white photography is what we think of when we remember the Astaire-Rogers pictures, along with those gloriously anachronistic all-white Art Deco sets designed by Carroll Clark but erroneously attributed the wonderfully-named Van Nest Polglase (Venice never looked so clean); the choreography was by Fred with Hermes Pan; the musical direction and orchestrations were by Hal Bourne; and the cast includes Erik Rhodes as a silly, English-mangling Italian co-respondent, Horton as Fred’s manager, the vermouth-dry Helen Broderick as his wife and Blore as his butler Bates, who feuds with him throughout and whose machinations resolve the plot. The main titles, incidentally, are fairly unique for their time, with first Fred’s feet and legs dancing into the frame and appearing above his name, and then Ginger’s. It’s a marvelously stylish gesture, almost a shorthand, one that hints at the spirited revelry to come.\n\nProduced on a relatively lavish Depression-era budget of $609,000, Top Hat brought in $3.2 million at the box-office, and became the most profitable RKO release of the decade.\n\nFollow the Fleet (1936) Adhering to the pattern set by Roberta in 1935 (and why would you want to?) RKO once again made Astaire and Rogers more or less subservient to Randolph Scott. As if that wasn’t bad enough the men play sailors, and Astaire’s idea of expressing his working-class bona fides is to constantly be chewing gum.\n\nWell, at least Irving Berlin wrote the songs. Ginger gets the sexy “Let Yourself Go,” which she and Fred then dance to, in an “impromptu” ballroom contest exhibition. It’s one of their most joyous numbers, performed by both of them with a rubber-legged, loose-limbed panache that makes you smile broadly throughout. Most of Fred’s numbers are done with his Navy band (“We Saw The Sea,” “I’d Rather Lead A Band,” “I’m Putting All My Eggs in One Basket”) but Harriet Hilliard, the future Mrs. Ozzie Nelson (and mother of Ricky) has a splendid solo in “Get Thee Behind Me, Satan.” I know I’m in the minority in believing this to be one of Berlin’s finest ballads, but it is in any case beautifully framed by the director Mark Sandrich and his cinematographer David Abel, and at least partially redeems the horrible “Why, without your glasses you’re beautiful!” old-maid cliché Hilliard is forced to endure before she sings. (Berlin originally wrote the song, interestingly, for Rogers to perform in Top Hat. Obviously, he thought well of it.) What makes Follow the Fleet special, however, and secures it a place in movie musical history (or at least, in Astaire-Rogers iconography) is the “Let’s Face the Music and Dance” number. It was the most dramatic entry in the series until “Never Gonna Dance” in Swing Time displaced it a year later, and its seriousness of intent — it begins with Fred and Ginger in a gambling den, separately losing their bankrolls and contemplating suicide — is almost shocking in the context of so light an entertainment, and the dance between them is so charged with unstated emotionalism it’s hair-raising.\n\nThe screenplay was credited to Allan and Scott Dwight Taylor with “Additional Dialogue,” as they used to say, by Lew Lipton. At least in this one Randolph Scott doesn’t say “Swell!” every other line. Sharp eyes will spot Betty Grable as a trio singer, Lucille Ball in a small role and Humphrey Bogart as a sailor. The Hubert Osbourne 1922 play Shore Leave, on which Follow the Fleet was based, incidentally, had a long afterlife: It was also the source for the 1927 Vincent Youmans musical Hit the Deck, itself filmed by MGM in 1955.\n\nTouch of Evil (1958) Kino’s 4K UHD edition of the dark, unsettling Orson Welles thriller reminds us that this skewed police procedural is one of the key pictures, both in Welles’ filmography, and of the decade in which it was made.\n\nThe Trial (1962) Orson Welles‘ adaptation of the Kafka novel has always been the movie of his I like least… or was, anyway, before I saw his television film of the Isek Dinesen The Immortal Story, which I like even less. I feel in this a bit like the filmmaker’s disciple Peter Bogdanovich, whom Welles never tired of twitting by referring to The Trial as “that picture you hate.” It’s difficult to say exactly what it is about it that leaves me cold; it’s one of those movies that works in nearly every individual scene yet never comes together for me in a fully satisfying manner. In the early ’80s I heard an academic posit on “All Things Considered” that Dr. Strangelove could not be considered an entirely successful satire because there isn’t a single sane character in it, but Candide is brilliant satire and no one could consider its eponymous hero remotely sane until the end. Still, there is no one in Welles’ version of The Trial with whom we can entirely identify, and perhaps that’s the problem. The confusion of Anthony Perkins’ Josef K. about what is happening to him is palpable (Perkins is very good) but, at least as the writer-director of this movie envisions him, K. is snide and ambitious and guilty of indeterminate social crimes that distance him from us as surely as he distances himself from his insurance company employees by occupying an elevated office from which to conspicuously lord it over them.\n\nWelles was famously forced to improvise his sets for The Trial when the funding fell through, filming the picture in the then largely abandoned Gare d’Orsay, which has since become the Musée d’Orsay, and the riveted walls give the images an otherworldly quality that adds measurably to the picture’s feeling of an endless nightmare. The new 4K UHD Criterion print restores it to something I assume approximates its original pictorial brilliance, light and shadow beautifully in balance. (The richly textured cinematography was by Edmond Richard.) In addition to Perkins, Welles gets marvelous performances from Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Elsa Martinelli, Suzanne Flon, Akim Tamiroff, Madeleine Robinson, William Chappell and himself as the satanic Advocate, smoke cigar rising from his head like something emerging from the vents of Hell.\n\nFor the record, I admit I liked The Trial a little better this time. Perhaps in another 10 years and another five screenings I’ll come to consider it one of Welles’ best… but I doubt it.\n\nCopyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nFollowing a remarkable writing/directing debut (Targets, 1967/1968)* which very few people saw Peter Bogdanovich, on the advice of his then-wife Polly Platt and working with the author, adapted Larry McMurtry’s 1966 novel, one of the best brief “coming of age” books by a modern American writer. Shooting on location in Archer City, Texas (McMurtry’s hometown, called Thalia in his book and Anarene in the movie), in black-and-white, with a cast of actors who might be familiar but were certainly not (or not yet) stars, and on a modest $1.3 million budget, Bogdanovich delivered a small masterpiece detailing the dreariness, and the extreme anomie, of a small, windswept Texas town in the early 1950s that can, of course, stand as emblematic of any community, then or now, in which hope dies pretty much at birth, and the only things that hold people — especially young people — together are drink, meaningless sex, and the tiny incidental pleasure of the movies they see that in no way reflect their own lives or experience.\n\nThere is scarcely a character in The Last Picture Show who is not either seeking sex, having it off with someone else’s spouse, or who has not done so in the past, sometimes from lust or even genuine love but (for the adults anyway) largely out of sheer boredom. The only exceptions that come to mind are Eileen Brennan’s Genevieve, the mother-figure toiling as a waitress due to her off-screen husband’s illness, and the smiling, mute and backwards boy Billy (Sam Bottoms) — and even he is initiated, in a disastrous encounter with a nasty fat whore (Helena Humann), courtesy of a few teenagers looking for something, anything, to do on a Saturday night. (We are at least spared the sequence in the novel in which the boys take turns humping a poor blind heifer, although in the movie they consider it.) I don’t wish to seem critical of these people for their erotic obsessions: Half the characters in the movie, after all, are adolescent, and thus naturally preoccupied with sex; anyone who says otherwise about his or her own teenage years is either lying, a Pentecostal, or both. But there appears to be, in Anarene/Archer City, no other activity that can engage them, aside perhaps from billiards or high school athletics. And it’s telling that the only book we see in the movie is a well-thumbed paperback of I, the Jury being surreptitiously passed from one masculine hand to another in a high school classroom. Perhaps the Coach (Bill Thurman) is right when he complains that the boys on his basketball team might be better shooters if they practiced more and jacked off less.\n\nIt is the Coach’s request that Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) drive his wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) to her physician that sets The Last Picture Show’s most important chain of events in motion, and it is there too that the screenwriters make a curious omission. In the novel, Coach Popper is known for bedding certain of his players on out-of-town trips in which he contrives to get his current favorite to share his hotel room, and it is known as well that he has only the most perfunctory conjugal relations with his wife. Yet McMurtry and Bogdanovich elide over this detail in their movie; thus when Ruth, weeping, says to Sonny, “You really don’t know, do you?” she seems to be referring, not to his ignorance of her husband’s furtive sexuality, but to a general naïveté in the boy’s personality. Since Genevieve warns Sonny, “One thing I know for sure. A person can’t sneeze in this town without somebody offering them a handkerchief,” we can be sure that in Anarene the Coach’s “secret” is clandestine only in his own guilty brain. It seems accepted, the way the teenagers in Alan Bennett’s The History Boys accept their literature master’s expected groping of their groins when he takes them home on his motorcycle — with a shrug and, maybe, a curious, virginal thrill.\n\nIt’s been several years since I read The Last Picture Show, so I no longer recall whether the Coach acts as a kind of procurer, sending Sonny to Ruth in the hope that he’ll satisfy her, but it wouldn’t surprise me. In any case, the relationship between Sonny and Ruth is, along with the lingering love Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) feels for a girl he once romanced, the movie’s heart, and it is to the point that it is in no way sentimentalized. Their first sexual congress is, on Sonny’s part, oddly tentative and, on Ruth’s, so emotional her tearful gratitude is quietly agonizing. Even at the picture’s climax, when with white-hot fury she confronts Sonny with his caddish selfishness, she is pathetically incapable of not needing him. As Bottoms sits at her kitchen table, devastated by a death he might have prevented and by his guilt over that and his treatment of Ruth, she holds his hand to her face, beaming tearfully. It’s a shattering moment, filmed by Bogdanovich with his customary grace and measure and his laudable avoidance of the overly emphatic.\n\nIt became fashionable to knock Bogdanovich in the 1970s, for — in the eyes of his (possibly envious?) former fellow critics, anyway — making nothing but hommages to his favorite filmmakers. Ford and Hawks were the two most often cited, but had those reviewers been paying attention they might have noticed that if there was a true referent in Bogdanovich’s work it was Orson Welles. Not the Welles of busy tracking sequences and kinetic editing but the man who made The Magnificent Ambersons and Othello: The Welles who pulled off extensive scenes without an edit while not calling your attention to his having done so, and whose concerns were more with the small and revealing moments between people, and with limning their loneliness and loss of innocence — their, to borrow from Thoreau, quiet desperation — than in dazzling your eyes, although only a fool would fail to note that he did that as well. As with the idea of a young man’s falling into a bass viol during a drunken serenade having, ultimately, tragic repercussions in Ambersons, the memory of a man and a young married woman carrying on a long-ago affair, the girl lacking the courage to break with convention or her own need for security becomes heartbreaking by the end of The Last Picture Show.\n\nIf Bogdanovich took from Welles (or Ford, or Hawks) any particular stylistic or pictorial cues, it was those Old Masters’ penchants for long sequences played in full before a static camera lens. It is, pace Martin (“Look at Me!”) Scorsese, the richest and most assured form of motion picture photography, requiring, as Welles told Bogdanovich, “much more confidence from the director, and a great more skill, and presence, from the actors,” to pull off. Bogdanovich was defeated in this technique only once during The Last Picture Show, and crucially, when due to the clouds overhead and to Timothy Bottoms’ forgetting his lines at a crucial moment he was forced to make what looks like an extraneous cut to the foreground near the end of the otherwise beautifully sustained dialogue between Sonny and Sam the Lion as the latter reminisces about his one great love affair.\n\nBogdanovich’s director of photography on The Last Picture Show was the excellent Robert Surtees, whose career stretched back decades and who was responsible for the look of a number of superbly shot movies: The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), Ford’s lush Mogambo (1953), the exquisitely mounted Oklahoma! (1955), Ben-Hur (1959), the phenomenally successful The Graduate (1967), the gorgeous Sweet Charity (1969) for Bob Fosse, William Wyler’s criminally under-seen and underrated The Liberation of L.B. Jones (1970), The Cowboys (1972), the almost profligately-entertaining The Sting (1973) and the ballet-world soap opera The Turning Point (1977). The look of the movie is almost more Depression-era Texas than the headiness of post-War, oil-boom 1951: If there were tumbleweeds in Anarene, they’d be blowing down the un-paved streets. But that, it seems to me, is the point; Anarene is one of those places in America, if you have any sense or push, you run from as soon as you can.\n\nA woman friend once referred to Cybill Shepherd’s Jacy Farrow in the picture as a girl “who gives bitches a bad name.” Yet even she is explicable, if perhaps the furthest thing from admirable. Jacy is that emptiest of small-town miracles, the wealthy beauty with no brains and nowhere (and no one) on whom to truly focus her desires, which are in any case so vague and diffused they are only a nagging overall sense of futility she can neither name nor dismiss, much less escape from. In her first acting role, at 21, the former model is not only strikingly lovely but remarkably assured. You can see, observing Shepherd, why her director fell in love with her. And even when Jacy is cavalierly playing with people’s lives, she’s almost impossible to hate, even if you’d rather she was more like her unhappy mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn), who at least has developed some poise — although we suspect she’s always had it, and by the end proves it — and a clear vision of what she cannot change, regardless of how much she drinks or how many lovers she takes on to ameliorate her essential loneliness. “Everything gets old,” she warns Jacy, “if you do it often enough.”\n\nI see I have scarcely begun to limn the beauty of Bogdanovich’s great ensemble cast, which includes the always-splendid Jeff Bridges as Duane, Sonny’s best friend and Jacy’s doomed squire; Timothy Bottoms’ gentle, if callow, Sonny; his younger brother Sam’s sweet, docile Billy who loves as, in my experience anyway, only a retarded individual can, and cannot be made to hate even when he’s the unwitting butt of misguided adolescent cruelty; Eileen Brennan’s warm, sad and maternal Genevieve; Leachman’s achingly needy Ruth; and Johnson’s simple, understated Sam the Lion. Sam was a role Welles badly wanted — he knew it would win the actor who played it an Academy Award — but Bogdanovich was correct in going for Johnson, who was vaguely familiar, mostly to Western movie aficionados, and that an actor (and a personality) as famous as Welles would have over-balanced the part, and the movie. The director was also convinced that Ruth Popper was a certain Oscar-winner, and both he and Welles were right, as Johnson and Leachman took home the Supporting Actor and Actress trophies in early 1972. For Leachman it was the role in toto, and the raw vulnerability with which she plays it. For Johnson, I suspect, it was that long monologue about the perfect love of his past that did it.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that although she praised the movie Pauline Kael (whose spurious essay “Raising Kane” Bogdanovich would blast the following year in Esquire) also found Bogdanovich’s rise as a filmmaker troubling and wrote that “even Nixon could like The Last Picture Show.” This is as bone-headed a view as those of critics a couple of years later who thought American Graffiti an exercise in nostalgia; the young people in George Lucas’ picture are no less desperate than the kids in Bogdanovich and McMurtry’s. If you have axes to grind, or see only what you want to, you miss the big picture. Speaking of which, The Last Picture Show does hold a certain nostalgic reference for me, as I first saw it in the mid-1980s when it was the final booking at a beloved local art-house just before, like Sam’s Anarene movie theater in the picture, it closed its doors for good, to become a McDonald’s. But McMurtry and Bogdanovich differ on that ultimate offering: In Bogdanovich’s movie it’s the 1948 Red River, clearly a special booking (and by a woman who confesses she doesn’t know how to run the place.) In McMurtry’s novel, it’s a standard 1951 “B” oater, one presumably chosen months in advance.\n\nI suppose the director couldn’t resist making an affirmative statement in the picture he chose to run clips from. But I prefer McMurtry’s solution: It’s just another undistinguished movie, for a town that probably doesn’t merit anything better, and wouldn’t know the difference anyway.\n\nText copyright 2019, 2023 by Scott Ross\n\n*Bogdanovich also, under the pseudonym Derek Thomas, directed 10 minutes’ worth of inserts (and wrote and recorded new narration) for something called Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women (1968) for Roger Corman, who subsequently gave him the opportunity to make Targets.\n\nSee also: https://scottross79.wordpress.com/2020/06/14/canvas-sky-and-muslin-tree-paper-moon-1973/\n\nPost-Script, November 2023 After I stopped reviewing for print publication I also fell out of the habit of taking notes while watching movies, particularly those I’ve seen before. Viewing the new Criterion 4K UHD edition of The Last Picture Show, however (which also includes the lengthier, black-and-white director’s cut of Texasville) I wondered if perhaps I should revise my thinking on this. I didn’t misrepresent the movie in 2019, but I certainly missed a lot — not while viewing, necessarily, but while remembering it as I wrote about it. How often do we see a movie so rich in character and incident we forget parts of it, even temporarily? Still, I can’t think how I failed to note the (admittedly fast and indistinct) insert of Coach Popper’s hand grabbing at the ass of one of his young players (Frank Marshall, Bogdanovich’s factotum on several pictures and later an extremely successful producer) as he trots off the court, and the grin the boy flashes at the man as he runs out. As a Welles partisan and devotee of The Magnificent Ambersons I’m also surprised that I did not comment on the visual quote by Bogdanovich of that picture’s “townspeople-as-chorus” when the preacher’s pious son is arrested for attempting to molest a little girl, or how in the final scene between Ruth and Sonny the Johnny Standley comedy record “It’s in the Book,” heard in the background, approximates what Welles originally intended for the last scene of his movie, when the conversation between Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorhead was (before the sequence was cut by RKO) counterpointed by a period recording of Moran and Mack’s “Two Black Crows.” Bogdanovich was nothing if not an apt pupil.\n\nAmong the other items I neglected to mention: The way Sonny looks at Eileen Brennan’s Genevieve from her feet up, an early indication not merely of his high-school-boy horniness but of his appreciation for older women and, similarly, how when he looks out the window of his classroom he is confronted with the sight of a dog mating with a bitch on the front lawn; Lois giving her sometime lover Abilene (Clu Gulager) the finger as she stares angrily at him from her car; how Jacey’s jealousy of Ruth’s affair with Sonny motivates her sudden attraction to him, which precipitates his unintentionally cruel abandoning of his middle-aged lover, as well as the long glare of loathing Genevieve gives her when she comes to the pool hall; and the way the picture essentially encompasses a single year, from the autumn of 1951 to the fall of ’52.\n\nI also noticed this time around that in every scene he’s in, the young Lloyd Catlett wears a little bandana around his neck. I wonder if that’s where Bogdanovich acquired the habit?\n\nAnent my criticism, above, about the filmmaker’s choice of Red River for the final offering at the Anarene movie-house, I stand by it (especially since I loathe the sequence he excerpted) even though Bogdanovich says in the commentary on the “Special Edition” cut that his intention was to contrast the Old West of American myth with what it had become. I still think he was mistaken. But as to my calling the movie “a small masterpiece,” I could not have been more wrong; The Last Picture Show, especially seen with the 7 or 8 minutes Bogdanovich added back to it (and which enrich the picture considerably) is a major masterpiece, one of the greatest American movies of a great American movie era. Indeed, I think it is probably Peter Bogdanovich’s finest picture. I only wish he had lived to see Criterion’s beautiful rendering of it.\n\nPost-Post-Script, December 2023 I forgot (damn it) in November to make note of what seems to me the single flaw in The Last Picture Show. It’s probably a matter of continuity, although I can’t see a gap between sequences, so perhaps it’s more a question of logical storytelling lapse. As explicating this error involves revealing an important event in the movie, one which will spoil the complete experience of The Last Picture Show for anyone who hasn’t seen it, I would urge you to ignore this post-script until you have seen it. This is one of those odd moments in an otherwise nearly perfect movie that bugs me every time I watch it, but which I tend to forget afterward, largely, I think, because the final scene is so emotionally overwhelming it wipes the flaw away in its tide of human feeling. When Sonny, grieving over the accidental death of Billy on the street as he was sweeping it, comes to Ruth and she excoriates him in her kitchen for his treatment of her, she brutally yet understandably lets him know she has no sympathy for his mute despair:\n\nI guess just because your friend got killed, you want me to forget what you did an’ make it all right. I’m not sorry for you! You’d’ve left Billy, too, just like you left me. I bet you left him plenty ‘a nights, whenever Jacey whistled. I wouldn’t treat a dog that way!\n\nThe lines are perfect, but since they are uttered mere minutes after Billy’s death, one has to ask: How does Ruth know the boy has died? She admits to Sonny that she’s become a recluse since he began to ignore her in favor of Jacey, and she’s stuck in her cheerless house on the outskirts of town, so again: How could she possibly know about an event that had only just occurred, especially since Sonny is so shell-shocked by what’s happened he’s incapable of speech? As the last scenes in the movie were filmed by Bogdanovich more or less as written in the final draft screenplay by McMurtry and himself, I suspect the pair realized there was no way to explain this time-lapse, and merely left it in, perhaps hoping that viewers would be so caught up in the emotions these scenes churn up they wouldn’t notice it, or would, like me, forget.\n\nIt’s not a fatal flaw by any means — The Last Picture Show is a masterpiece anyway — but I felt compelled to mention it.\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted text for links and fuller reviews.\n\nThe Great Race (1965) I ended my movie year in 2022 with one old favorite and began the new year with another.
