        "text": "(1945) Fifteen-minute radio editorials, news, and political commentary. Sponsored by Lear Radios. ABC.\n\nDuring World War II, Welles often expressed his policital and social views on the air, supporting the Democratic Party or the war-effort in general. From January to June 1945, the New York Post syndicated a regular editorial column by Welles that combined Hollywood gossip and policital content. As the Hollywood content lost out to policital commentary, the Post dropped the column. Orson Welles Commentaries are a continuation of this effort, again combining Hollywood and Broadway news and opinion with Welles's liberal policital views.\n\nThe most famous episodes address the case of Isaac Woodard, Jr., a decorated African-American solider badly beaten and blinded by police in South Carolina. Welles drew attention to the injustice over a series of weeks, bringing it to national attention and naming the officer responsible for the assault."
