        "text": "Orson Welles is revered as one of the most innovative, creative and talented individuals in American history.\n\nFrom the iconic Citizen Kane to his acclaimed radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds, Welles influenced every corner of the arts during his life, and today marks the 100th anniversary of his birth.\n\n**\"We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone.\n\nOnly through love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we're not alone\" **\n\n**\n\n** Welles was born in Wisconsin on the 6th of May, 1915. After initially studying music, and then dabbling with art, Orson Welles enrolled at an expensive private school in Illinois, and it was here that he discovered his passion for acting. Welles began to experiment with and test the limitations of artistic forms, producing his first radio play - an adaptation of a Sherlock Holmes story - before his 16th birthday.\n\n\"I prefer people who rock the boat to people who jump out\"\n\nAfter turning down a scholarship to Harvard University, Welles decided to travel to Europe. When walking into Dublin's Gate Theatre, he brashly claimed to be a Broadway Star and landed his first professional stage role at 16 years old. Throughout his adolescence, Welles saw Africa, London and New York, writing, creating and performing as he travelled the globe. In bustling Manhattan, at the age of 19, the young actor eloped with a glamourous Chicagoan socialite named Virginia Nicolson, and this marked the start of Welles' lifelong love affair with the fairer sex.\n\n\"If there hadn't been women we'd still be squatting in a cave eating raw meat, because we made civilization in order to impress our girlfriends\"\n\nWelles was married three times during his life. His most famous wife, the actress and dancer Rita Hayworth, was his second. Welles and Hayworth shared three tumultuous years together in the Forties, and their marriage ultimately crumbled as Welles felt caged by conventional relationships. His continuous pursuit of freedom also called time on his third marriage, to Italian aristocrat Paola Mori. Whilst married to Mori, Welles entertained a Croatian mistress who went by the name of Oja Kodar, and she remained his girlfriend until his death.\n\n\"Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn\"\n\nWelles was not considered conventionally handsome or stylish.\n\nIndeed, he famously hated his own nose so much that he took to wearing a prosthetic one in many of his on-screen performances.\n\nHowever, despite these mostly self-appointed shortcomings, Welles was described by biographer Peter Noble as \"a magnificent figure of a man\", and could be argued as a pioneer of several modern fashions. Among them was being the first to pair a T-shirt with a blazer, and a champion of nautical stripes, Welles established his unique and inimitable style by dressing to look interesting, rather than fashionable.\n\n\"There are three intolerable things in life - cold coffee, lukewarm champagne, and overexcited women\"\n\n**\n\n** Said to balloon later in life due to his excessive consumption of calorific foods and alcohol, Welles became ill, his obesity exacerbating existing medical maladies. After a life that contained many \"overexcited women\" and much champagne, the actor was found dead from a heart attack on 2 November 1985. Welles once observed, \"if you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story\". Yet with many projects left up in the air - from a television adaptation of Don Quixote to an elaborate musical stageshow of Around the World in Eighty Days - Welles' death felt like a premature end to his story.\n\n\"I don't think any word can explain a man's life\"\n\nSo said Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist of Welles' most famous work, Citizen Kane. And when chronicling a life of love affairs, worldwide success, and artistic innovation, to describe the life of Orson Welles in a singular word indeed seems impossible. But today, as we celebrate the centenary of his birth, the one word that undeniably encapsulates the life and legacy of this American icon is enduring."
