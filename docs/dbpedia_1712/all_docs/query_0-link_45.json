        "text": "Jay-Z – The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000)\n\nReleased: 31 October 2000\n\nOn Halloween in the Year 2000, Jay-Z and Rocafella Records collaborated to create one of the illest group albums of all-time in The Dynasty: Roc La Familia.\n\nAlthough Dynasty is jam-packed with features from acts such as Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek, Jay-Z leads the show by appearing on approximately 70% of the album’s songs.\n\nBeanie Sigel notably made a name for himself on Dynasty, challenging Hov on records such as “Where Have You Been”, “Streets is Talkin”, and “Stick 2 the Script” for best verse. Overall, Dynasty has aged well as an LP, and is still a worthy listen over 20 years after its release!\n\n★★★★–★★★★1/2: Excellent; recommended to all fans of artist or genre.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nRating Categories:\n\n★★★★★: Best in show; pinnacle release from an all-time great artist.\n\n★★★★1/2: Stellar example of genre; peak potential.\n\n★★★★: Excellent; recommended to all fans of artist or genre.\n\n★★★1/2: Very good; a few bland songs or minor flaws throughout.\n\n★★★: Good; fans of the artist will find value here.\n\n★★1/2: Average; does little to establish the artist or maintain quality.\n\n★★: Unexceptional; a few highlights but otherwise bland.\n\n★1/2: Weak; unrecommended for anyone but major fans of the style and/or artist.\n\n★: Seriously flawed; very poor work but relatively listenable.\n\n1/2: Terrible; a true embarrassment and akin to audio masochism.\n\nShare this:"
