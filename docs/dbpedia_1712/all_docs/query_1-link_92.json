        "text": "The year was 1979 and Disco was enjoying what would be its last year under the mirrorball. Everything was futuristic from the electronic synthesized dance music to polyester party outfits. Dance clubs were equipped with supersized subwoofers and light-up dance floors. Fortunately for rock, the craze was so short lived, most bands didn’t have time to undergo an identity crisis, however most bands weren’t KISS. In their early years, the group often pumped out two albums per year. Now, after releasing the solo albums of ‘78, KISS couldn’t afford to sit ‘79 out.\n\nDynasty was a sign of the times in more ways than one. Musically it wasn’t KISS meets the Phantom, unless the phantom was secretly Barry Gibb. Artistically it was a final effort to save the original lineup (…save it, save it) and had KISS continue to sell out stadiums it probably would have succeeded for at least another tour. KISS was trying to expand their horizons and prove to critics that no matter what direction Billboard turned, KISS could follow.\n\nEnter Peter Criss’s paisan Vini Poncia as producer. Peter admits to demanding that the band hire Vini or he would quit. It was a surprising turn, considering Peter’s solo album was the least successful of the four, but all the members of KISS enjoyed working with Vini, particularly Paul and Ace. Dynasty went on to ship platinum. I Was Made For Lovin’ You was among their highest charting singles and Vini would be invited back to produce Unmasked.\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of the track listing:\n\nI Was Made For Lovin’ You – KISS meets Studio 54 at 128 beats per minute. This song features a great bass line and is an instant shot of adrenaline. For long time fans of the band, it’s important to note that this is the first song Paul ever wrote with Desmond Child. Child would continue collaborate with KISS, churning out many classics over the next decade.\n\n2,000 Man – The original Rolling Stones version that appeared on Their Satanic Majesties Request was simply forgettable. Ace more than breathes life into it; he makes it his own. Vini suggested that this was Ace’s way of reaching out to old KISS fans despite the albums new direction. (Leaf and Sharp) It worked. Definitely one of the best songs on the record and any Rolling Stone fan who argues that this isn’t an improvement is just in denial.\n\nSure Know Something – Many music critics credit this deep track as proof of Paul Stanley’s writing abilities. Vini Poncia also praises Paul’s effort and describes it as one of his favorite collaborations. This song was the second single released from the album and could easily be slipped on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack without notice.\n\nDirty Livin’ – Peter’s lone entry and only performance on the album closes out the disco vibe of side one. This song is another “soundtrack” entry that would work well in films like Saturday Night Fever, Rocky, or even Flashdance.\n\nCharisma – Gene’s strongest entry on the album, this song is another “persona” song for the Demon. The reverb or echo of the lyrics and background vocals work well with the disco inspired production. Much like the opening song of side one, this opening groove on side two is a positive mood setter.\n\nMagic Touch – Paul delivers an exploratory vocal performance, but it’s ultimately wasted on this throw away track. The magic is missing from this side two slacker.\n\nHard Times – The opening riff of Hard Times is another Ace rescue effort after the lackluster previous track. This song screams to the KISS Army about the days of his youth. Brightened up a bit by production, this song is now a much grittier fan favorite of Ace’s setlist. As much criticism as Ace received about his attitude after the success of his solo album, maybe KISS would have been better off to have followed his lead during this time of transition.\n\nX-Ray Eyes – Gene mentions that he would often just sit down in the studio and force out songs. This is one of those songs. It’s not bad, but it’s not memorable either. It does compliment the works on the album.\n\nSave Your Love – A good decision to end Dynasty with another rock song from Ace. Although not as good as his other two contributions, during the Dynasty era Ace at his worst is still better than a lot of the other songs on the album."
