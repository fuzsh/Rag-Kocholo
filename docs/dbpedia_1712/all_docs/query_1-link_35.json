        "text": "A-don't choo know.....2,000 Man gotta go....\n\nThe last time I listened to this album was when we did the song by song thread on it. It's an OK album but I wouldn't miss it if I never heard it again.\n\n2,000 Man gets the vote again.....\n\nPlayed Dynasty quite a few times when we did the song by song thread. I like it a lot more now than I did when it first came out, I actually consider it a better album overall than Love Gun which means it escapes being the worse of the 70's KISS albums. What I find remarkable about Dynasty is the near non presence of Gene Simmons, he contributes one decent track and another that's a complete toss away, delusions of Hollywood no doubt dancing in his head.\n\nSure Know Something. I love all of these so it's not that I really think it's weak. I just like the other two more.\n\nI really don't know when I listened to it last. Probably the song by song thread if we're talking the whole album as an album. Otherwise, this week I've listened to several of the songs in the course of this thread. But not the whole album.\n\nThe biggest change would probably be my opinion of the Gene songs. I think I like both of them more than I did way back when.\n\nI like it more than Love Gun AND Destroyer\n\nWTF? 2,000 Man is the best song on this album. Anyone who prefers Sure No Something should be voting on their favorite ABBA song instead. I like the IWMFLY but the Ace songs are only thing that gives this album any street cred.\n\nI'm not with you on Destroyer, no way, too many alpha tracks on that record. What is it about Destroyer that you don't like?\n\nKISS had zero street cred by 1979, it's arguable that they never had any to begin with....maybe 1973-75.\n\nAnd they voted the best one of those off in the first round.\n\nGotta go with IWMFLY this time. Leave Ace alone\n\nI like SKS the best on this album but I don't own any ABBA, but being I've given up on worrying about any sort of \"street cred\" a few decades ago maybe I'll grab a Greatest Hits one of these days.\n\n-Certain production choices\n\n-While the first three are quite mighty, as well as SIOL, can’t stand Great Expectations, I’m kind of indifferent to Beth at this point, and I know this is a fan favorite, but I’m not the biggest DYLM fan."
