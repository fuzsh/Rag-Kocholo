        "text": "Shiloh Dynasty is, or was (I’ll explain) a singer-songwriter whose mystique is matched only by their incredible, incredible, incredible voice. The anonymity that Shiloh has been able to maintain while obtaining a sort of underground-star status is very admirable. But “star status” is not accurate. Shiloh has worked on music in the past, but none that ever came out. There are rumors that Shiloh committed suicide in the 2016–2017 area, and other accounts that they are completely healthy somewhere. Regardless, it seems that the person behind @ShilohDynasty was never interested in the spotlight.\n\nShiloh’s Instagram\n\nHowever, as the sampling-culture in hip-hop music caught wind of Shiloh’s iPhone-recorded mini-songs (20–30 seconds max, sometimes just one line long) and flipping them. Shiloh’s prominence and fan base grew.\n\nA compilation of Shiloh’s posts.\n\nThe first time I heard Shiloh was on XXX Tentacion’s album “17” the tone of the sample and the melodies were so beautiful and entrapping that they could be looped over and over for hours. Coincidentally, this is how Shiloh got their start. Through posting 13 songs of vine length (6 seconds) that looped well, Shiloh posted their last vine in April 2015. The songs that sampled Shiloh quickly gained traction on Instagram including Swell’s “I’m Sorry,” which has over 30 million across platforms.\n\nIf Shiloh were to make a full length album, I’d imagine that it’d be a mix of Frank Ocean, Raury, Tracy Chapman, with styles borrowing from international music and yet simultaneously unique. I think hearing that project would force people to make better music.\n\nThere is still no consensus on the fate of Shiloh Dynasty, though I personally think that they’re out there somewhere working under the radar at a coffee shop somewhere, writing and sharing the songs only with friends and family.\n\nCome back, Shiloh.\n\nPlaylists In Shiloh’s Vibe:\n\nUrban Beats\n\nRnB Nights\n\nUrban Classics\n\nJazz Meets Hip-Hop"
