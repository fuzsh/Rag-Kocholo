Each musician has their own influences, however, all turn to a single ideal: to make Heavy Metal of the best quality.\n\nDYNASTY officially appeared in March 1996. With just a few months of existence, managed to reach a level above the standards of the time.\n\nDYNASTY's proposal is to make heavy metal, based mainly on the influences of NWOBHM, however with the Latin swing, emerging the rhythms and exotic sounds, inherited from the miscegenation Brazilian, without ever forgetting the ‘heavy’ factor.\n\nThe band owns a special charisma, seeks to get involved in rich, enigmatic and controversial themes, thus being able to express their vision of the current world, without sounding massive and opinion-forming. At the among so many bands that copy each other, DYNASTY presents more effective weapons: being original, creative, daring, strong and sincere.\n\nAccustomed to living on the road, with many concerts in almost all regions of Brazil, Argentina, participating in festivals or various events. In early 2009 they left for their first tour international stage, where they performed several concerts, passing through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Chile. They were 18 concerts in 32 days, long trips and difficulties, but in the end everything went well, leaving sure of a quick return.\n\nAs with all bands, line-up changes are inevitable, with rare exceptions, with the Dynasty changes have happened several times and certainly will happen again. The band made a strategic break between October 2010 and January 2011, returning at full speed. This time was necessary for the external affairs of the band to settle in and that they could continue the process, at the end of that time the band returned to rehearsals, polishing the new compositions and reinvigorating the old ones.\n\nThe return also brought the change in the name of the band, to avoid undesirable inconveniences of copyright, was renamed “Dynasty of Metal”, but still called by fans just “Dynasty”.\n\n2016 was the year of the band's twentieth anniversary, a new work was prepared in celebration of that historic date. This work was baptized “Step by Step”, it has nine new songs, two reinterpretations orchestrated tracks from their first two albums, a cover by a great Minas Gerais metal band, in addition to three songs with Spanish versions, aiming to establish itself in the Latin American market.\n\nDuring 15 days of July 2017 the band toured Uruguay and Argentina promoting their new album.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, the band started rehearsals for the recording of the project “Back To The Past Tribute” with 16 covers of the bands that influenced us in our career and also an original song."
