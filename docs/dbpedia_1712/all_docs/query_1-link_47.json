        "text": "Some days\n\nIt′s hard to see\n\nIf I was a fool\n\nOr you a thief\n\nMade it through the maze\n\nTo found my one in a million\n\nAnd now you're just a page torn from the story I′m living\n\nAnd all I gave you is gone\n\nTumbled like it was stone\n\nThought we built a dynasty that Heaven couldn't shake\n\nThought we built a dynasty like nothing ever made\n\nThought we built a dynasty forever couldn't break up\n\nThe scar, I can′t reverse\n\nAnd the more it heals, the worse it hurts\n\nGave you every piece of me\n\nNo wonder it′s missing\n\nDon't know how to be so close to someone so distant\n\nAnd all I gave you is gone\n\nTumbled like it was stone\n\nThought we built a dynasty that Heaven couldn′t shake\n\nThought we built a dynasty like nothing ever made\n\nThought we built a dynasty forever couldn't break up\n\nIt all fell down, it all fell down\n\nIt all fell, it all fell down, it all fell down\n\nIt all fell, it all fell down, it all fell down, eh\n\nIt all fell down, it all fell down, it all fell down\n\nAnd all I gave you is gone\n\nTumbled like it was stone\n\nThought we built a dynasty that Heaven couldn′t shake\n\nThought we built a dynasty like nothing ever made\n\nThought we built a dynasty forever couldn't break up\n\nIt all fell, it all fell down, it all fell down, eh\n\nIt all fell down, it all fell down, it all fell down\n\n(And all I gave you is gone) it all fell down, it all fell down, it all fell down\n\nThought we built a dynasty forever couldn′t break up\n\nWriter(s): Joachim Rygg, Hillary Bernstein, Mario Valdes<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
