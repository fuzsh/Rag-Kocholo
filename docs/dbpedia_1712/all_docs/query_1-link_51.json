        "text": "Si Robertson, Uncle Si from the show \"Duck Dynasty,\" is testing his musical talents in his new six-song album \"Me and My Smokin Hot Honey.\"\n\n\"I don't sing,\" Robertson said at a press conference Thursday. \"I make a loud joyful noise.\"\n\nIn honor of his vow renewal ceremony with his wife, Christine, after 43 years of marriage, he and Ashley Nelson, who produced the album, decided to record the songs played at the ceremony.\n\nThe album features Kix Brooks, Robertson's daughter-in-law Marsha Robertson, the Mauldin Brothers, Zach Harris, Jessica Andrews and Nelson's husband Jay Nelson. It also includes the ballad \"His and Hers\" with Ashley Nelson's daughters Ally and Macy Jae Moore and friend Kolby Koloff from the Lifetime series \"Preachers' Daughters.\"\n\n\"We had a lot of fun doing it,\" Robertson said.\n\nChristine Robertson enjoys the album not only for the tribute, but also because her favorite country music singer, Brooks, participated.\n\n\"I called Christine and said, 'Who is yours and Dad's favorite country artist?' said Marsha Robertson. \"She said, 'Well, hands down Brooks and Dunn, but I know they're broken up, so probably Kix Brooks.'\"\n\nNelson shot Brooks an email asking him to sing with Si Robertson, sent him her song \"Can't Take the Swamp Outta the Man,\" and he was in.\n\nFans can download the album on iTunes, and also can catch him singing at 6 p.m. today with the Mauldin Brothers at Rippy's, 429 Broadway."
