        "text": "Just before the release of Taylor Swift’s 2017 Grammy Award winning album, Tom Brady was in his “Reputation era.”\n\nOn Friday viewers of Apple TV+’s “The Dynasty” will get an inside look at Brady’s 2016 season, one that started with a four-game suspension.\n\nSet to the soundtrack of Swift’s un-released “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor’s Version),” Episode 8 of the 10-part docuseries is a look back at Brady’s return to the spotlight following the Deflategate scandal.\n\n“Sort of the world’s on his case. Everybody wants to see him fail, so he goes on the revenge tour. And we always try to find music that doesn’t necessarily, it isn’t subversive, but its not the typical way you would show something,” the show’s director Matt Hamacheck said during an appearance on the Up & Adams Show.\n\nDeflategate, an investigation into the Patriots organization that revealed an alleged scheme to provide partially inflated balls for the 2015 AFC Championship game, resulted in the Patriots being stripped of two draft picks in addition to Brady’s suspension.\n\nThe saga dominated national headlines for nearly a year and a half. And while Brady maintained his innocence the entire time, the negative media attention fueled his competitive spirit.\n\n“The king is back. Here he goes. Watch him get pissed off and go,” says former Patriots wide receiver Danny Amendola in a teaser for the new episode.\n\nSwift’s yet-to-be-released track, which will appear on her re-recorded “Reputation” album, is a fitting song to accompany the retelling of the 2015 scandal. The lyrics of the bridge, which reveal contempt for those who have wronged her, reads:\n\nBrady got his, that’s for sure. The Patriots went on to win the AFC East in the 2015 season and Super Bowl LI the following year.\n\n“Don’t underestimate someone who’s got something to prove, somebody playing with a certain anger level, a certain fury, a certain need for recompense,” ESPN columnist Howard Bryant said about the legendary New England quarterback.\n\nEpisodes 7 and 8 will premiere on Apple TV+ on Friday, March 8."
