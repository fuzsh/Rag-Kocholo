It has sold over 167,000 (3/12) copies since the SoundScan� era commenced in 1991. \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" became the band's second gold single being certified on 8/16/79. The album was certified gold by the CRIA (Canada) for sales of 50,000 copies on 7/1/79. Platinum (100,000) followed on 8/1 and double-platinum (200,000) on 11/1. Additionally, \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" was certified as a gold single (5,000) on 8/1/79. In Australia the single attained platinum certification from the ARIA for sales of over 100,000 copies.\n\nPerformed Live:\n\nOnly 33% of \"Dynasty\" has been performed live: \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" and \"2,000 Man\" were the contemporary additions to the \"Return of KISS\" tour in 1979. \"Sure Know Something\" was a popular unplugged addition in 1995 and part of the KISS Symphony in Australia in 2003. Paul also dug up \"Magic Touch\" for his 2006/7 solo tours and \"Hard Times\" has been a staple in Ace's solo sets.\n\nKISS Album Focus:\n\nBy 1979 the ever-growing merchandising machine was drawing attention away from the band. The band was also fragmenting, not only due to the solo albums. The opposite had been hoped for with an artistic break from one another, allowing each member to develop individually and keeping the band from breaking up in 1978. The solo albums were not the solution to the problems with all of the members. It's often been convenient to point fingers at Ace and Peter with their growing personal abuse issues, but they weren't the only members with issues.\n\nIt should be stressed that both Paul and Gene were also enjoying the excesses that rock stardom provided, though not necessarily of the physically self-destructive sorts. Their excesses were of the sort more connected with ego, and in Gene's case it drew him into new avenues of exploration. \"Dynasty\" was something of a death knell for the band. It marked the complete collapse of the interpersonal relationships within the band. While the album is not necessarily bad, it was a completely fragmented and disjointed effort, more than earlier albums had been. One thing was clear: Ace Frehley had arrived.\n\nIn an interview prior to the release of the album, Paul suggested, \"Gene and I are writing together, which hasn't happened since the first or second KISS album... But with this LP, we're together again, and Ace is writing. The more input anyone puts into this band, the better we can be\" (Grooves, 1979). If there were any collaboration between the two then it did not surface on the album. There would be no unity on the album and in some ways the album is more like a collection of solo tracks. On the album such \"musical chairs\" was wholesale. Naturally, the lack of Peter on the majority of the album has been a topic of much debate for the two decades since the album was released. What was supposed to mark the \"Return Of KISS\" essentially resulted in the \"End Of KISS.\"\n\nThe decision to use Vini Poncia as producer on the album came about from the band wanting to smooth over the declining situation with Peter Criss. Vini had produced Peter's solo album and he had demanded that Vini produce the next KISS record (another considered choice was apparently the disco guru Giorgio Moroder!). This tactic backfired on Peter when Vini decided that his drumming was not good enough for the album. According to Gene, \"By that time Peter was our biggest liability, because he had become dependent on chemicals. Ironically, Vini decided that even though he produced Peter's record, he didn't think that Peter was good enough to drum on a KISS record. Peter was not qualified to make any judgments about material or arrangements, he said. In Vini Poncia's estimation, Peter was close to tone deaf and didn't play drums well enough\" (KISS & Makeup, p. 160).\n\nWith a slight flirtation with the disco sound the album closed the original era of KISS in a reasonable if somewhat controversial manner. While not as fiery and complete as earlier albums with much of the non-single material on the album being over-looked. While the musical components of the album may not have had the specific member expected playing them the resulting product was both solid and polished. The artwork is also considered by some to be the finest on a KISS album, not only due to similarities of the Francesco Scavullo cover photograph with the style of a certain Beatles album.\n\nWhile Gene and Paul have criticized \"Dynasty\" as being sonically sanitized, little of their assault goes directly towards producer Vini Poncia. They knew exactly what they were going to get with Vini. A contemporary review stated: \"The latest by KISS represents its first studio album as a group since 'Love Gun' in 1977. In between were a live album, a greatest hits package as well as the four solo outings. With 'Dynasty,' the kings of theatrical rock show a maturation in its music as the emphasis is on the song and melody lines instead of bombastic guitar riffs and relentless mayhem. The single, 'I Was Made For Lovin' You,' has a subtle disco beat, while the other tracks are mainstream rockers paced by the interplay of bassist Gene Simmons, guitarist Paul Stanley, drummer Peter Criss and lead guitarist Ace Frehley\" (Billboard, 6/9/79). There is a certain amount of honesty in that review.\n\n\"Dynasty\" certainly took the band where they had never been before with what would become only their second Gold-certified single, in the form of \"I Was Made For Lovin' You,\" which was released in May 1979. It is interesting to note that the single did not even manage to go top 10 in the US, only reaching #11 with 16 weeks on the charts. The single's success was greater outside of America, where in many markets it reached #1 or #2. Paul was happy enough to stay positive about the song and its roots, stating, \"It's been a huge success. It's the biggest selling single we've had in the world to date and I thought with everything going on with dancing and with disco. I didn't think that doing a full ahead disco beat would be bad if it was a good song. You know some of the early Motown stuff, The Four Tops kind of thing, those were basically the same kind of beat. I think if the music is good it really doesn't matter what kind it is, I think that bad heavy metal music is as bad as bad disco. Bad music is bad music, if it's good that's all that matters\" (3XY).\n\nAce, on the other hand, saw the song as being \"Rock Disco,\" and stressed the fact that the rest of the album was the sort of rock that fans expected from the band. OK, fine, Ace was protecting the material that he had brought to the sessions and didn't want the band to be seen as transitioning to the sound of a dying fad. It was after all just one song on the album. By 1979 many major acts were jumping on the disco bandwagon � just as the fad was starting to fade. Most notable among these were The Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart. In comparison with those two artists, at least KISS weren't guilty of attempting a complete disco album, simply restraining themselves to one song as an experimentation with the genre.\n\nInspired by his visits to the legendary Studio 54, Paul wanted to write a disco song that stayed reasonably close to the basis of KISS. I was simply a matter of him wanting to prove to himself how easy it was to do. Originally titled, \"Tonight,\" the resulting product succeeded in capturing much of the essence of the disco era and all that it was about. Paul recalled, \"What I realized was that all the songs there had the exact same amount of beats per minute. That way they could cross-fade from one song to another without stopping... I remember thinking that all the songs I was hearing there were about today. They were about now. They were about instant gratification. They were about having a great time and not worrying about the future\" (KISS Box Liners).\n\nOddly, the song ended up being one of the very last presented at the recording sessions for the album. In the process of writing the song Paul had also picked up a new songwriting partner who became increasingly important during the 1980s. That person was Desmond Child, who Paul had first worked with writing a song for Desmond's band Rouge called \"The Fight.\" Contrary to popular belief, Gene Simmons played the bass part on the song, a song he never particularly cared for. He recalled, \"I'm still not crazy about 'I Was Made for Lovin' You.' But that has nothing to do with it. I recognized that early on. He [Paul] came in one day and said, 'Look, I've got this disco song, and it goes like this.' And he started singing like the Four Seasons, one of my favorite bands, by the way. I thought, 'That doesn't sound like Kiss, but that's precisely why we should record it'\" (Rolling Stone). Casablanca gave the piece the full disco treatment and released it in the popular extended disco 12\" single format. This resulted in the track growing to 7:54.\n\nThe musical breakup of the album would be interesting. Paul Stanley played bass on two of his songs, \"Sure Know Something,\" and \"Magic Touch.\" In addition, he'd play the lead guitar and the solo on \"Sure Know Something.\" This song was released as the follow up to \"I Was Made For Lovin' You.\" While it went top 10 in Australia and Holland it was not a success elsewhere. During a short charting in the United States, it only managed to scrape to #47 on the Billboard charts (and #44 on Cashbox). Ace played bass on \"2,000 Man,\" \"Hard Times,\" and \"Save Your Love.\" This left Gene just on three tracks: \"Charisma,\" the reworking of Wicked Lester's \"Simple Type\" (Ken Sharp � Goldmine) that Gene had worked on with manager Howard Marks, \"I Was Made For Lovin' You,\" and \"X-Ray Eyes.\"\n\nTo have an album with more Ace Frehley material than that from Gene Simmons must have come as a shock for some fans, especially since it contradicts the suggestion that Ace was lazy, both musically and creatively. Ace's increased contribution was one of the results from the solo projects. With his growth as an artist and song-writer he had more confidence in his skills and material that he brought to recording sessions. Even though Gene and Paul had always been the band's primary song-writers, Ace was now in a position to make even more contributions.\n\nNot only was there an increase in the quantity of material Ace was bringing to the sessions, but there was almost an ascendancy of sorts, which was probably also helped by Gene's growing external diversions (Hollywood). However, Paul, somewhat grudgingly commented, \"Now that we're working on the new album, Ace has turned into a really good writer. He needed that incentive of having to do his own album. It's an added plus\" (Grooves, 1979). Such a comment, taken out of context, seems to suggest that Ace had suddenly found a magical formula, discounting his earlier contributions.\n\n\"2,000 Man\" had been brought to the sessions in a demo form that was recorded by the band nearly identically. In some ways it was a very appropriate tribute to the Rolling Stones, who had recorded the original version on \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\" album. Gene remembered, \"That was Ace's completely. Ace in fact came in with a demonstration tape which is commonly known as a demo. He'd already worked out the arrangements so '2,000 Man' was pretty much Ace's own concept that we loved right away. Even though we usually try to write material for albums we don't really go out of our way searching for any remakes of anything. It just seemed perfect so we didn't mind doing it. In fact it turned out quite well I thought\" (3XY). With the recording of \"2,000 Man\" \"Dynasty\" became the second album in a row to contain a cover, setting something of a trend for the future. Ace's other material on the album would stay true to the original \"rock\" roots and was very straight forward.\n\nPeter was fed up with the band by this time. He had had, at least in his own mind, a Platinum award in his hands from a successful solo outing regardless of the reality of the situation. This platinum solo outing was something of a misnomer, since it has been well documented that the solo albums, while shipping Platinum in a Casablanca-engineered publicity stunt, had not sold well and quickly found their way back to Casablanca as returns or into discount sales bins. He also wanted more of his own material on KISS albums.\n\nFor the \"Dynasty\" sessions he brought several songs including \"Dirty Livin,'\" \"Rumble,\" \"Out Of Control,\" and \"There's Nothing Better,\" which were, with the exception of the first track, not used. Both \"Out Of Control\" and \"There's Nothing Better\" were used on Peter's first post-KISS solo album. For all the inconsistencies of Peter's contributions to the band during the \"Dynasty\" era, the album marked his greatest contribution to the band in terms of the material he had demoed in preparation for the album. The songs demonstrated that Peter could create material with more edge than the songs he'd recorded for his solo album. Unfortunately, Peter's renaissance was occurring at the same time as Ace's.\n\n\"Rumble\" was a typical Stan Penridge and Peter demo with its funky vibe so different from KISS' style, almost \"Hooligan\" Part II. Vini Poncia assisted with the writing of the lyrics which were supposedly based in part on Peter's alleged gang youth. It was almost a typical \"West-Side Story\" sort of song: \"I've got a gang they call the Phantom Lords / We're the meanest suckers, you could ever know / Well it's Saturday night and the streets are dark / We're heading down to Prospect Park / Where there's gonna be... a rumble tonight.\" With subject matter such as that, there was little doubt it would be excluded from a KISS album, especially with the band's changing fan demographic. \"Hooligan\" was nice and light and fluffy.\n\nThe 1978/9 demo for \"Dirty Livin'\" was nearly identical to the version recorded by KISS for the album. Notable differences included a few minor lyrical changes and the lack of the integral background vocals. The song originally dated to 1972 and Stan and Peter's post-Chelsea band Lips. In terms of the story presented in the song there are some striking similarities to the story told in the early KISS song \"Black Diamond,\" which Peter had sung. Lyrically, this similarity is represented by the lyric, \"I make my livin' out on the streets,\" compared with \"Out on the street for a living\" from \"Black Diamond,\" plus the allusions to \"darkness.\" A couple of other lyrics in the song, \"I've gotta get away\" and \"Mainline out of China is due in tonight\" also amusingly include the titles of earlier KISS songs which Peter had sung (\"Getaway\" and \"Mainline\" respectively).\n\nWhile Peter only had one song on the album, it should be remembered that when KISS returned to Electric Lady Studios in New York in February 1979, Peter was still recovering from the effects of problems with his hands caused by his car accident in mid-1978. Furthermore, drugs were playing an even greater role in his life and there were probably some personal issues in his life that were affecting both his attitude and style. Peter only played drums on one song on the album, his composition \"Dirty Livin'.\" The rest of the drums were performed by Anton Fig.\n\nUnlike Bob Kulick's ghost guitar work for Ace Frehley, Anton was given a bit more latitude to be himself when playing. According to Anton, \"I was allowed to play my own way. I'm sure Vini Poncia, [the producer], and the band made some suggestions � but no different from any other recording situation\" (AntonFig.com). It has also been suggested that Richie Fontana may have made contributions on the album, but that appears to be nothing more than another of the many KISS urban legends.\n\n1979 was a year Peter found himself ready to tumble over the precipice into near insanity. During the filming of \"The Phantom Of The Park,\" he had met Coppertone model Debra Jensen (Svensk) who he started dating. He filed for divorce from his wife Lydia toward the end of 1978. Thirteen years his junior, Debra had been the January 1978 Playboy \"Playmate of the Month.\" A few years later it was reported that Lydia had filed for divorce from Peter and had obtained a $1 million settlement. Whatever the result the divorce proceedings were protracted. His exclusion from the recording of the album must have come as something of a shock, though how much he cared at the time can probably be illustrated best by his resulting behavior on the \"Dynasty\" tour.\n\nWith the recording of the album completed it was time to prepare to hit the road on what was hoped would be KISS' triumphant return to touring after more than a year's. The prospects for the tour were to be bigger and more extravagant than ever before, and plans had been in the works since January 1979 to create the greatest show yet seen. The KISS Army Newsletter turns the tour's birth into something of a fable: \"The meeting gets into full swing after Paul takes a piece of paper out of his pocket and announces that this is the Super Surprise he promised. The paper had a sketch of a stage on it. He explains that he had had a dream the night before, which was so powerful he awoke and started drawing this stage. After showing it to Ace, Gene, Peter, and the KISS Staff, Gene suggested that it would look even better if three more walking ramps were added. Peter suggests that his past drum platforms only rose at the end of the show, and this one should also be able to travel all around the stage while he plays his solo. Ace jumps up and explains what he wants to do on his solo\" (KAN Vol. 4, #1).\n\nAccording to C.K. Lendt, \"All the stops were pulled out to organize KISS' 1979 tour around the expanded Super KISS concept. It became like the Manhattan Project. The planning meetings ran continuously\" (KISS & Sell). While some of the brainstorming for the new stage did not result in anything, the band did have grand plans for the tour. Initially it was planned to incorporate a laser effect for Paul similar to that used in the \"Phantom\" movie. This was until Paul discovered that putting laser light sources near your eyes might not be such a good idea! Gene too, would get to fly up to the lighting trusses during his \"God Of Thunder\" bit, opening a whole new possibility for amusing jams that would continue into the next century.\n\nAce introduced an automated light-effect guitar for use during \"New York Groove,\" which he could adjust the light patterns displayed on his guitar body from the numerous control knobs. Additionally, adding to his normal smoking Les Paul solo during \"2,000 Man,\" Ace used a \"rocket launcher\" guitar to \"fire\" at specially rigged lights in the lighting truss that appeared to explode when \"hit.\" Some changes were made to Peter's drum kit with it rising like a column with the usual cat embroidered under-drop, rotating left and right so he could face all areas of the arena, and coming forward to the front of the stage. Visually, the band wanted the stage show to eclipse anything they had done previously.\n\nMost importantly, the band developed new costumes for the tour, which have been remembered as being too Disney or Las Vegas in style. They were extravagant, and mostly useless, to many who saw the transition from earlier costumes. In fact, they were completely garish, with Gene's aluminum-foil-esque Godzilla boots and cape, Peter's green fluffy football armor (complete with tail), and Ace's whatever-that-was-supposed-to-be mirror effect V-neck from Hell. Paul, naturally, stayed pretty much the same with a few new cosmetic add-ons, notably his purple top which was usually quickly discarded during shows anyway.\n\nThe costume redesign marked another change for the band who had used Larry LeGaspi, who'd designed their costumes since 1973. During 1978 the band turned to designer Pete Menefee. Pete quite literally took the band's look totally Hollywood during his two-year tenure as costume designer. Pete would be responsible for the design of the \"Dynasty\" and \"Unmasked\" costumes before Larry returned in 1981. According to C.K. Lendt, \"The costumes would be le dernier cri. They would be stupendous, ravishing, outrageous, and overwhelming, on a par with Las Vegas and Liberace, but in a rock 'n roll style\" (KISS & Sell).\n\nAs the band geared up for the release of the album their first official box set was issued in Japan on April 25. The package simply contained the four solo albums. This collectible has become one of the holy grails in KISS collecting and comes with quite a premium, even though the solo albums it contains come with no difference to the ones individually released individually. Because of its rarity, the package can be found in all sorts of states of completeness, some including or excluding the obis and posters. It seems likely that Victor simply packaged existing stocks of the four solo albums together, and thus should include the obi and poster. This release was the final item issued by Victor Industries, KISS' Japanese distributor since 1975. PolyStar took over distribution for the albums from \"Dynasty\" until the 1990s.\n\nOn May 3 Gene and Ace appeared on the Robert Klein Hour. Another guest on the show would be comedian Robin Williams. Unlike the later infamous Tom Snyder interview, even Gene got into the humorous action, joking about radioactive pimples caused by the makeup and offering his tongue's services for Bar Mitzvahs and Weddings, etc. While the interview is mainly light-weight, during the interview Gene addressed the increasing complaint about KISS representing evil using the usual \"American hero � Larger Than Life\" analogy. Ace was relaxed and talkative and made efforts at comedy: \"What has eight arms and kills women... Squid Vicious.\"\n\nGene vaguely attempted to stay serious when discussing people wanting to see a show when going to concerts. Robert wasn't about to allow the show to lack humor: \"Gene Simmons just stuck out his tongue and poked a lady's eye out in the first row... It's really amazing...\" It is during this broadcast that Klein famously asked Gene, \"Can you reach the bridge of your nose with your tongue?\" Gene responded, \"I can reach the bridge on 59th Street.\" It is only in the last minute of the interview that Gene and Ace start discussing their then forthcoming album, \"Dynasty,\" with Ace commenting, \"We have to go to the studio and finish the album.\" The only material mentioned from the album is the remake of \"2,000 Man.\"\n\nOn May 29, 1979 \"Dynasty\" was released. It attained Gold certification from the RIAA on June 6. Platinum certification followed on July 10. The album was the first studio release since \"Destroyer\" not to ship with Gold or Platinum certification. This was probably a result of retailers and Casablanca getting burned by the previous year's solo album fiasco, not to mentioned other fiscal issues affecting the country. \"Dynasty\" was the last KISS album for several years to attain Platinum certification in the United States. Billed as \"The Return Of KISS,\" the concept for marketing the album and tour envisaged by Bill Aucoin, the album was a hit and reached #9 on the US album charts.\n\nThe album also charted top-10 in many other countries where its success exceeded that attained in America. The change in musical style with \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" started to alienate some in the KISS Army who saw the band pandering to current musical styles further moving away from their rock roots. Promotional considerations resulted in the band's videos for \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" and \"Sure Know Something\" turning up on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. Both videos were directed by John Goodhue. KISS had also made extensive use of commercials to promote the tour and album.\n\nThe last few weeks of May 1979 saw the band rehearsing for the tour in Long Island. According to C.K. Lendt, \"It cost a small fortune. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in start-up costs just to bring the show into Nassau Community College and hundreds of thousands of dollars once we set up there. But money was never a concern of KISS. They didn't want to hear what this was costing\" (KISS & Sell). By June 11 the band were in Orlando for their final rehearsals and to deal with the final issues that such a gargantuan stage show caused. The massive tour required ten trucks to move the whole show from city to city.\n\nThe \"Dynasty\" tour kicked off at the Civic Center in Lakeland, Florida on June 15. The tour should have began the previous day, but the original opening night's show had been cancelled due to lack of ticket sales. The band had instead used June 14 as a final full dress rehearsal (KISS Alive Forever) for the press, and Gene appeared on lunch hour radio on local station BJ-105 to promote the show. Opening acts during the tour included New England, whom Paul had produced, Judas Priest, Pearl Harbor and The Rockets, John Cougar & The Zone, The Michael Stanley Band, and others. Another opening band would be the band Breathless, who at the time included drummer Kevin Valentine. He would have a further role to play in KISStory more than a decade later.\n\n\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" hit its high position of #11 on the Billboard singles chart on July 16. The single charted a slightly more impressive #8 on the Cashbox charts. It became KISS' second and final \"Gold\" single, being certified on August 16, 1979. Internationally, the single hit #1 in Canada, Holland, and New Zealand and reached #2 in Australia, France, Germany, and Switzerland. During the early dates of the tour the tour book offered for sale was the incredibly rare \"Return Of KISS\" version, which has a band photo on the cover with the New York skyline as the backdrop, rather than with the more familiar \"Dynasty\" album cover (which incidentally is also available in two versions). At over $1000, that tour book, in mint condition is one of the rarest pieces of memorabilia.\n\nKISS' July 7 show at the Capital Center in Largo, Maryland, was filmed by HBO for a concert broadcast later in the month. This video was finally officially released as a bonus DVD with the \"KISSology Vol. 2\" set in 2007, though the quality of that version is not quite equal to the best in fan circles. The show was early enough during the tour that the set still contained songs from each of the four solo albums. Apart from the initial inclusion of solo material such as \"New York Groove,\" \"Radioactive,\" \"Move On,\" and \"Tossin' And Turnin,'\" the band also had material from the new album to incorporate with older classic material.\n\nThe noticeable transformation in the set also included \"2,000 Man\" and \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" from the new album. Other changes affected the beginning and end of the show: \"King Of The Night Time World\" became the band's opener number (in place of \"I Stole Your Love\") and \"Rock And Roll All Nite\" become the band's final encore. Other songs performed as part of the set during the tour included \"Beth,\" \"Black Diamond,\" \"Calling Dr. Love,\" \"Christine Sixteen,\" \"Detroit Rock City,\" \"Firehouse,\" \"God Of Thunder,\" \"Let Me Go, Rock 'N Roll,\" \"Love Gun,\" \"Makin' Love,\" and \"Shout It Out Loud.\"\n\n\"Sure Know Something\" was released as the second single off the album in late August. It failed to make any impact and stalled at a disappointing #47 on the US singles charts. The single managed to go top-10 in Australia and Holland. In October the band appeared on the infamous Tom Snyder Halloween show with a visibly drunk Ace, who stole the show with his hysterical uncontrollable laughter and humor. This is much to the dismay of Gene and Paul, who cast venomous glances at both Ace and Peter and attempted, unsuccessfully, to rein in their comments. The interview was nearly a complete loss following the \"trout\" incident, with Tom describing Gene as the \"Bass\" (as in fish) player and referring to him as George!\n\nPeter, unfortunately, just looked completely wasted and miserable. He did mumble some stories during the broadcast, including those about his gun collection, which visibly made Gene grimace (and exclaim that Peter is talking about toy guns rather than worry the parents of KISS' younger fans with the reality of a legal adult interest). In comparison with the earlier Robert Klein interview of Gene and Ace, it is clear that the tour was taking a toll on the band. The state of the band would be more obvious during the band's \"Dinah! And Friends\" interview by Billy Crystal prior to the November 7 show at The Forum in Los Angeles. During this television appearance Gene and Paul tried to talk over Ace and Peter, though with only marginal success. Ace, in particular, managed to get his voice heard, but Peter would barely be heard. He would, however, get to recount his story of dressing up one of the roadies (which was actually Fritz Postlethwaite � KISS Alive Forever) in Gene's makeup and putting him behind the drums at the end of a show to (successfully) freak Gene out.\n\nThe \"Dynasty\" tour ended in Toledo, Ohio on December 16. This concert marked Peter Criss' final performance with KISS (until the \"Reunion\") and essentially closes the original era of the band. The \"Return of KISS\" tour has long been considered a failure. However, the tour was huge in scale of production and brought many challenges to the band when multiple dates in cities did not occur as anticipated. While individual shows sold well, they didn't sell well enough to justify multiple dates, even with the band having not toured properly since early 1978. The costs of touring had increased massively. With each show costing upwards of $1 million, reportedly, the margins of meat and potatoes touring had disappeared.\n\nThe stage show took 17 hours to set up and required ten semis to lug it from city to city. 45 people were needed to work the tour. In fact, the show had grown so big that the band could only do shows every other day, with sometimes more than one day off between shows. Financially, the size of the show required multiple concerts in the same city, but the band were no longer pulling the sort of numbers of fans to allow that. Stadium rock, by 1979, was dying a death, with the likes of KISS, Aerosmith, and Ted Nugent starting to fall as excesses, in all their forms, started to catch up with the bands.\n\nA week following the conclusion of the tour Peter married Debra Svensk, while the band members went their separate ways. December also saw the \"Phantom Of The Park,\" re-titled in some markets \"Attack Of The Phantoms,\" released worldwide, in some areas as a cinematic release. As a new decade was about to dawn, it was not clear what the future of KISS held.\n\nThe \"Dynasty\" tour was not a success on a human level. Peter clearly wasn't in good mental or physical shape. At some concerts he nearly had to be dragged onto stage and looked visibly miserable and distant. Some stories recount how even at this point there was the suggestion that someone else put on Peter's costume and makeup and fill in for him as his drumming became more and more erratic. Other stories recount that Peter would deliberately (and not) drag the tempo of the live performance down to a near halt and blow the performance of his beloved \"Beth.\" Peter would readily admit, \"I got told towards the end that my timing was lousy, and that was true � because at the end, my attitude was lousy, I was hooked on drugs\" (Kerrang #226).\n\nYet all of the blame cannot be solely placed on Peter. A band is more than just one member. KISS had simply reached their zenith previously, and had discovered that the first step down could be a large one. With over-exposure, record label issues, and a changing musical scene the band were no longer cutting-edge. Fans were also moving off to follow other groups. Part of this may well have been a result of the fans shrinking ages and the show becoming too much of a carnival and family affair to be taken seriously by the average teen and older fans.\n\nWith the US tour over, it was clear that there was going to be no international leg as the band members got away from each other. The tour had eaten up the band in more than one way. Not only had Peter hit rock bottom, and the relationships between the band members reached a low point, but the costs of cancelled and overly expensive show had taken their toll. KISS, it seemed, could grow no larger than the KISS of 1977/8. When asked about plans to tour outside of America, Paul had earlier in the year responded: \"We had plans to come to Australia and for economic reasons, because the show's so vast, so large we haven't been able to come but from what they tell us it looks pretty good this year so maybe around May or June you could be seeing us cause we'll be going to Japan and it really means a lot to us to come this time\" (3XY). What is clear is that an international tour was being planned.\n\nThe planned summer 1980 UK tour was initially announced in February 1980, though the dates had leaked in late January. The Wembley dates, at least, went on sale on April 17. The tour, including European dates, was cancelled in April, and while we now (think) know the internal issues affecting the band, the excuse used at the time was the album: \"Due to the extended studio time KISS need to complete the recording of their next album, 'KISS Unmasked...' The decision to postpone the tour was made by the management and the group when they realized they wouldn't have time to record the album and rehearse their show before the tour started\" (Sounds, 4/26/80). However, it was also rumored at the time that KISS were re-negotiating their contract with Casablanca and \"were unable to do their UK and European tours as planned because of this (ongoing?) label limbo situation\" (Sounds, 5/10/80).\n\nRegardless, the impact on fans was negligible; Wembley had only sold �200 worth of tickets, and only 7 Edinburgh tickets had been sold due to that show having gone on sale the day prior to cancellation and only having been advertised locally. Dates were rescheduled in May, though negotiations for concerts in Brighton and Edinburgh were not successful. There are more cancelled dates than just in the UK as dates in Germany were booked, with some getting as far as having promo posters and tickets printed. No Japanese dates were booked and it would took until November 1980 for the band to make it Down Under. There was no way it could be done internationally with the costs involved. The cancellations damaged the band's reputation in certain markets that seldom forgave artists for cancelled shows.\n\nIn terms of sales, the band had plenty to be happy about with the album's performance. Gene recalled, \"The album is close to two million, the single is over a million and I understand that worldwide it was a number one record. Belgium, Holland, Switzerland you know. Germany, Canada.\" (3XY). In the SoundScan� era the album has shifted some 157,000 copies, comparable to \"Hotter Than Hell.\"\n\nPerhaps the KISS Army Newsletter tempted fate by defining \"Dynasty\" as \"a powerful group or family that maintains its position for a long period of time\" (Vol. 4, #1) on its front cover. If nothing else the title was ironic with what followed. Such rhetoric may have been a hopeful attempt to maintain the illusion that the band was healthy in all respects and marketing hype seldom correlates with reality. Between the explosive success of \"Alive!\" in December 1975, through the end of the Dynasty Tour in December 1979, a period of just 4 years, the band had gone from nobodies to stadium sell-outs to a band struggling for its identity and fans.\n\nPeter's complaints about the band had become true with KISS being less and less about music. By 1979 KISS' retail sales reached $117 million for merchandising, albums, tours, etc., beating 1500 companies listed on the stock exchange. The merchandising rather than the music was becoming a key discussion point on television features about the band. During the summer the band's company purchased 196 acres in Cincinnati, Ohio, where they planned to build an amusement theme park. Meanwhile, the band did find time for some philanthropy and film a segment for the Jerry Lewis Telethon for Muscular Dystrophy.\n\nIn terms of collectibility, there really is not a whole lot to say about \"Dynasty.\" For the album itself, there is only one interesting issue: the original German Bellaphon issue, which was released on red vinyl (a British version of this is also available). The US and British versions of the album both came with posters, and naturally, the US version came with the ever-present merchandise order form. Several countries also reproduced the printed inner dust sleeve, notably the UK which printed theirs on heavy stock cardboard rather than the flimsy cheap paper used on the US version. Both singles were issued in most countries. Of these the Japanese regular release and promotional versions are desirable. Germany saw the release of \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" on regular black, red, rose, pink, and purple vinyl. Of these, the red version seems to be the most common and costs around $30. The others vary in rarity. This single features a picture sleeve with the unaltered logo. The US version of \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" features a slightly longer mix of \"Hard Times\" on the flip side. Just 0:03 longer than the original album version of the song, the song fades out and ends on a single drum/guitar chord/note, similar to the manner with which a band ends a song live where a fade-out isn't possible or desirable.\n\nFor \"Sure Know Something,\" the single was initially issued in Germany in a picture sleeve whose back advertised all of the albums up to \"Dynasty.\" In November, however, this single was reissued with the addition of \"Double Hit Special\" with \"Best Of Solo Albums\" added to the rear cover discography. Both are interesting, but neither is particularly rare. Some markets would release an extended disco mix of \"Dirty Livin'.\" The effect of the remix would be to take the pulsating rhythm of the original recording and make it more disco sounding, somewhat similar to the overall feel of \"I Was Made For Lovin' You.\" This remixing would provide a rearrangement of the song and would also stretch the song's length to nearly six minutes. France issued one of the most interesting singles with the picture sleeve featured on their \"Disco Rock\" release of \"I Was Made For Lovin' You.\" Additionally, they released \"Dirty Livin'\" b/w \"Sure Know Something\" (yes, the tracks were swapped around in France!), and oddly \"Magic Touch\" b/w \"Save Your Love,\" making France only one of two nations to issue three singles off the album.\n\nThe second of these countries was the UK. Initially, in June 1979, \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" was released with a picture sleeve that mimicked the boring black and white art used in Spain and Scandinavia. On August 17, 1979 \"Sure Know Something\" was released, this time with no picture sleeve. Finally, in late 1979 Pye distributed their last KISS single, the \"2,000 Man\" EP which featured both the A-sides from the previous two singles on the B-side. It also came with a picture sleeve and has become one of the more collectible singles from this album. The version of the song released on the EP would be heavily edited, resulting in the loss of nearly a minute-and-a-half of the song. From Mexico came the four-track \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" EP, which sells for around $25. One other issue from this country is not particularly clear, the promotional Ray-O-Vac (battery makers) single for that song. It may have been a one-track single or just a different cover for the above-mentioned EP."
