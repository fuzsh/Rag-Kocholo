Instead, the band released their second live album, Alive II, that same year, and each member had recorded eponymous solo albums, which were simultaneously released on September 18, 1978.\n\nBefore recording the album, the Kiss members were working separately on various demos:[7]\n\nPeter Criss recorded and submitted a four-track demo with the songs \"Out of Control\", \"Rumble\", \"Dirty Livin' \" and \"There's Nothing Better\". \"Dirty Livin' \" made it to Dynasty, while \"Rumble\" remains unreleased officially by the band but has surfaced on the internet as a bootleg.[8] The other two songs ended up on his 1980 solo album Out of Control.\n\nAce Frehley recorded and submitted a five-track demo with \"Hard Times\", \"Save Your Love\", a cover of \"2000 Man\", \"Backstage Pass\" and \"Insufficient Data\". Three of the songs are on Dynasty, while the last two remain unreleased.\n\nGene Simmons wrote and recorded a large number of demos, including five songs with members of the band Virgin, drummer Chuck Billings and guitarist Tommy Moody. Billings has identified the songs \"I Have Just Begun to Fight\", \"Reputation\" and \"Bad Bad Lovin\" as from the demo he played on, in addition to the two songs credited to Simmons on \"Dynasty\".[9]\n\nPaul Stanley wrote songs with Desmond Child: one called \"The Fight\" was released on a Desmond Child & Rouge album; and one called \"Tonight\" formed the verses of \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\", combined with a chorus written by Stanley and Vini Poncia. \"Sure Know Something\" was written after Poncia had joined the project and a recording shows how the song was developed from a basic homemade demo in the studio with the band (except Frehley) and Poncia contributing.\n\nCriss's disco influenced demo of his song \"Dirty Livin'\" (written in 1971) set the direction for the album project and Simmons and Stanley were briefly in contact with disco producer Giorgio Moroder, a friend of the band's manager Bill Aucoin before deciding on Vini Poncia.[9]\n\nRecording\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter pre-production and rehearsals were completed, Poncia (who had produced Peter Criss) decided that Criss's drumming was substandard, an opinion shared by Stanley and Simmons. Criss was hindered by injuries to his hands that he had suffered in a 1978 car accident. Kiss hired the South African-born studio drummer Anton Fig, who played on Ace Frehley, to play on the Dynasty sessions. \"On Dynasty, Peter was pretty much out of commission through drugs and alcohol, and he was not being nice to most people. I wouldn't point to it as a classic Kiss album.\"[attribution needed][10] Except for his song \"Dirty Livin'\" (a rewrite of a song of the same title demoed during his pre-Kiss days in Lips), Criss does not play drums on the album, and he did not perform on another Kiss album until he played one song on Psycho Circus in 1998. Fig was again hired to replace Criss during recording sessions for the following album, Unmasked. Eric Carr was hired as Criss's permanent replacement before the Unmasked Tour began.\n\nFrehley, who himself left the band three years later, played a bigger role than Simmons on Dynasty, singing three songs, \"Hard Times\", \"Save Your Love\" and a cover version of the Rolling Stones' song \"2000 Man\". Frehley is the only Kiss member to appear on those three songs, except for occasional backing vocals by Stanley. Although Frehley had frequently sung backing vocals and had written the Kiss classics \"Cold Gin\" and \"Parasite\", he had only previously been lead singer on his songs \"Shock Me\" on Love Gun, and \"Rocket Ride\" on the studio side of Alive II, as he lacked confidence in his ability as a lead singer.[11]\n\nStanley's \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" was one of the band's most successful singles, peaking at No. 11 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart.[12] In eleven countries around the world, it reached the No. 1 or No. 2 spot. It was the first Kiss single to have a disco remix, as a 7-minute and 54-second version was released on a 12-inch single. He also sang on \"Sure Know Something\" and \"Magic Touch\", where he also plays all guitars and bass. In contrast, Simmons sings lead vocals on only two songs: \"Charisma\" (which became a major hit in Mexico) and \"X-Ray Eyes\".\n\nArtwork\n\n[edit]\n\nThe album includes a colorful jacket cover which is a collage of photos taken from the photo session and not a group shot as it appears. The label shows a portrait of all four members instead of the usual Casablanca label. Inserts included a merchandise order form and a full-color poster.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nAll credits adapted from the original release.[13]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nKiss\n\n[edit]\n\nPaul Stanley – vocals, rhythm guitar; lead guitar on \"Sure Know Something\" and \"Magic Touch\"; bass on \"Magic Touch\"\n\nGene Simmons – vocals, bass; rhythm guitar on \"X-Ray Eyes\"\n\nAce Frehley – vocals, lead guitar; all guitars and bass on \"2,000 Man\", \"Hard Times\" and \"Save Your Love\"\n\nPeter Criss – vocals and drums on \"Dirty Livin'\"\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n[edit]\n\nAnton Fig – drums (except \"Dirty Livin'\")\n\nVini Poncia – keyboards, percussion, backing vocals\n\nTechnical personnel\n\n[edit]\n\nVini Poncia – producer\n\nJay Messina – engineer, mixing\n\nJon Mathias, Jim Galante – assistant engineers\n\nGeorge Marino – mastering\n\nFrancesco Scavullo – cover and poster photo\n\nHoward Marks Advertising Inc. – design\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nWeekly Charts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales Australia (ARIA)[31] Platinum 50,000^ Canada (Music Canada)[32] 2× Platinum 200,000^ Netherlands (NVPI)[33] Platinum 100,000^ New Zealand (RMNZ)[34] Platinum 15,000^ United States (RIAA)[35] Platinum 1,000,000^\n\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
