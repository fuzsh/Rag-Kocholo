        "text": "[Verse 1]\n\nRebekah rode up on the afternoon train\n\nIt was sunny\n\nHer saltbox house on the coast\n\nTook her mind off St. Louis\n\nBill was the heir to the Standard Oil name\n\nAnd money\n\nAnd the town said\n\n“How did a middle class divorcée do it?”\n\nThe wedding was charming\n\nIf a little gauche\n\nThere’s only so far new money goes\n\nThey picked out a home and called it “Holiday House”\n\nTheir parties were tasteful\n\nIf a little loud\n\nThe doctor had told him to settle down\n\nIt must have been her fault his heart gave out\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\nAnd the said\n\nThere goes the last great American dynasty\n\nWho knows if she never showed up what could’ve been\n\nThere goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen\n\nShe had a marvelous time ruining everything\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nRebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set\n\nForever\n\nFlew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city\n\nFilled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names\n\nAnd blew through the money on the boys and the ballet\n\nAnd losing on card game bets with Dalí\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\nAnd they said\n\nThere goes the last great American dynasty\n\nWho knows if she never showed up what could’ve been\n\nThere goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen\n\nShe had a marvelous time ruining everything\n\n[Bridge]\n\nThey say\n\nShe was seen on occasion\n\nPacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea\n\nAnd in a feud with her neighbor she stole his dog and dyed it key lime green\n\n50 years is a long time\n\nHoliday House sat quietly on that beach\n\nFree of women with madness, their men and bad habits\n\nThen it was bought by me\n\n[Chorus 2]\n\nWho knows if I never showed up what could’ve been\n\nThere goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen\n\nI had a marvelous time ruining everything"
