        "text": "What a thunderous record!\n\nOkay, so in 1979, KISS had to contend with the monster that was AC/DC’s Highway To Hell but if there is one truth to be said it is that rock certainly wasn’t dead in the late 70s despite the disco boom. KISS certainly played into the disco rhythm with Dynasty, as it’s a little more pop-driven than their preceding output, thereby making it more accessible to a broader audience, but you’ve got to be listening with disco in mind to pick up on it otherwise it comes across as a rhythmic hard rock masterpiece.\n\nDynasty has always divided fans and if nothing else it has kept the album at the forefront of the KISS back catalogue because of this divisive nature. Still, KISS were well and truly in their stride when they released Dynasty, their seventh studio album, and while others may disagree, I feel Dynasty is one of their best albums and one of the best records released in 1979.\n\nAs to the quality of the recording, mix, and mastering; it’s astonishingly good! The soundstage is wide and immersive with a warm tonality and slight boost in the low-end while remaining crystal clear across the entire sound spectrum with just enough distortion to make Dynasty really rock. While this is one album that should be in every KISS fan’s vinyl collection, the lossless Apple Digital Master, on Apple Music, is the very definition of perfect. Don’t get me wrong, I love vinyl, but when a stream sounds this good it’s difficult to look beyond it for you never quite know what you’re going to get with used or new vinyl. A double-edged sword, yes, but it’s a serious consideration that each music collector must ponder as the cost of vinyl continues its upward trajectory. It is with this in mind that streaming, when done right, can be the perfect accompaniment to your physical music collection. The trick is to download albums to your device so that it plays seamlessly and is uninterrupted by the instability of the Internet. Doing so gives you a sense of having the record; a psychological anomaly perhaps, but one that allows me to feel as if the digital collection has more permanence.\n\nI Was Made For Lovin’ You is iconic with Gene Simmons’ bass tracking rhythm, Anton Fig’s driving drum beat, Ace Frehley’s killer guitar licks, and Paul Stanley’s falsetto vocal. It’s a perfect (KISS) song and while some may point to its disco-driving groove, I class it as pure rock and roll. Admittedly, KISS didn’t help issues with the disco-style music video, but as a fan of both genres, I consider this merging to be nothing short of perfection. It was, after all, representative of the era.\n\n2,000 Man has too much of a Cheap Trick sound, particularly with regard to the vocal echo, for it to be fully KISS. Frehley does an adequate job on vocals, but I’ve never really been a fan of his vocal presentation, except perhaps on Hard Times, subsequently preferring Stanley and Simmons on lead vocals. Yes, KISS’s 2,000 Man is more rock and roll than the original Rolling Stones recording; but it was far from a stellar song from the Stones so it’s a wonder that KISS decided to cover it.\n\nSure Know Something is rhythmic gold. While I’d suggest that it isn’t Stanley’s greatest vocal performance, it sure is compelling.\n\nDirty Livin’ is the only Peter Criss song on Dynasty and what a killer tune it is. Criss’ vocal melds perfectly into the mix and is understated thereby allowing the music to take prime positions and therefore not allow the listener to be distracted by the lyrical intent. That said, it would be interesting to hear a mix with Criss’ vocal sitting atop the musical bed. Regardless, Dirty Livin’ is a great song that is worthy of inclusion here.\n\nCharisma has a killer rhythm and is, without a doubt, one of my favourite KISS songs. Simmons recorded a masterful dreamy vocal performance and those guitar licks are utterly perfect.\n\nMagic Touch is a solid rock tune but isn’t as strong as many of the other songs from Dynasty. It’s as if it’s missing something and that dip, mid-song, in tempo and drive takes the listener out of the mix somewhat. Magic Touch is akin to a highly polished demo but it just needed a little boost to make it great. It would be interesting to hear it sped up, just a little, to see if that shifts the song to a bolder, more KISS-like approach.\n\nHard Times is a far better Frehley performance than that which was heard on 2,000 Man. The gruffness, and distortion, throughout the chorus in both his vocal and the accompanying musical backing make Hard Times a killer tune and one of the best KISS songs of all time.\n\nX-Ray Eyes is a fun tune and is a perfect album track. However, you’re unlikely to seek it out on its own for it isn’t amongst Simmons’ greatest and I’d argue the tempo is a little too slow to be truly great and I would love to see an additional kick drum element placed in the mix.\n\nSave Your Love closes out Dynasty with a drilling rhythm that compels me to play the album again. Yes, as with a number of the songs on Dynasty, it may never make it to a compilation, but songs like Save Your Love are the backbone of KISS and ensure that the album is notable for more than a couple of killer tunes.\n\nFrom start to finish, Dynasty is hard rock at its very best. The firestorm of rhythm, followed by an incredible mix and lyrical styling makes this one of the greatest KISS albums of all time with memorable and engaging tunes. While we can all lament Gene Simmon’s suggestions that rock is dead, I find it hard to argue with his position when listening to classic KISS albums such as Dynasty for no musician makes hard rock music like this anymore."
