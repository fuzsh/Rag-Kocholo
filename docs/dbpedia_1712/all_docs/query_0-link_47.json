        "text": "he new Roc-A-Fella album entitled 'The Dynasty Roc La Familia 2000'is an incredible album. I kid you not when I emphatically say this is some next level stuff for Jay-Z and his crew. It is absolutely 100% off the meat rack.. Its incredible. Song after song after song knocks and it becomes apparent that Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegal and Jay Z had been holding back their dopest material until now.\n\nFor west coast headz Jay-Z has shown both growth as an artist as well as his appreciation for the love he has gotten out here, especially in the Bay.It is reflected in the music. He uses Bay Area producer Rick Rock on a couple of tracks including the very popular 'Parking Lot Pimpin' which is an authentic Bay Area saying. He also does a nice track with Snoop called 'Get Your Mind Right Mami'.\n\nOther standout joints include 'This Can't Be Life' featuring Scarface and 'Guilty To Proven Innocent' featuring R Kelly. Heads will really enjoy '1-900-Hustler' and 'You, Me, Him and Her'. The track that will really touch a nerve is the emotionally charged 'Where Have You Been'. Here Beanie Sigel rips a heart felt song about a after who has mistreated and abandoned his family."
