        "text": "1) Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions!\n\nWe appreciate this opportunity to be able to talk to you and update our fans as well as attract more!\n\n2) Can you talk about the recording process for Back to the Past?\n\nWe started the project in 2016, but we shelved it, because we needed to put out a new album of unpublished material (CD Stpe by step 2017).\n\nAt the end of the pandemic, at the beginning of 2021. We made two lists, with all the bands we wanted to pay homage to in this tribute, and then we set out to choose which songs from each band we would choose. I confess that it was very difficult to choose, I felt like a Viking choosing who would be killed. But anyway, we needed to make it happen. We started working on production, hundreds of rehearsals and how to put the songs with our Brazilian look in each one of them, after that period we went to the studio for official recordings, which took place in late 2021 and early 2022. There were many days of recording, experimentations and everything we could do better for the honorees and the fans.\n\n3) Can you talk about the tracks Long Live the King and Beat the System?\n\nExcellent question! Long live the king is a song that we always played in our shows here in Brazil and in Latin America, this song is huge, a world anthem. We recorded it for a project by the band Narnia itself, but we decided to put it on the album, we created some nuances to give this Swedish masterpiece a new look.\n\nBeat the system, was one of Petra’s songs that I heard the most in my life, even though it has a construction focused on music from the 70s/80s. We came up with a more metal atmospheric one, I sent it to Bob Hart, he said we revived the song and he liked it so much. By the way, I sent the songs in advance to all the honored bands, the feedback was all positive. Unfortunately Michael Bloodgood and Ted Krikpatrick couldn’t hear them, and we sent them to the other band members.\n\n4) Which track was the most difficult to trace?\n\nAs I said, there were about a year of rehearsals, which gave us a good knowledge of all of them. But we had some work done in the studio, mainly on the songs “Ark Of Suffering (The tempo changes of this song are absurd) , Eye of hurricane (Performing a Chris Impellitteri song and with Rob Rock’s vocals makes everything more difficult for anyone) , Psychedelic Super Jesus (It’s a complicated song, because of the tempo changes, and Dale Thompson’s slang and higher notes)\n\n5) Can you talk about the album cover and the artist involved?\n\nThe cover of the Brazilian version and the American one have the same concept, it is an elderly man entering a time tunnel and on the back cover he comes out young.\n\nThe national art was made by Rômulo Dias @rdd.artwork. The americana was developed by @ marcosvasouza, who made it complete by AI, which gave a futuristic touch to the album.\n\n6) What can fans expect next?\n\nFans are already charging us for Part II of the project, but it’s still early days, but it’s not ruled out. The project was very expensive for us, especially in a heavy economy in Brazil. The moment is to take the songs to the stage and perform them live.\n\n7) Can you teach a band history lesson?\n\n“Born from the bowels of Nova Lima, a city in Minas Gerais surrounded by lush mountains, very close to the Brazilian capital of heavy rock, Belo Horizonte. .\n\nThe band DYNASTY OF METAL officially appeared in March 1996. With just a few months of existence, it managed to reach a level above the standards of the time.\n\nDYNASTY’s proposal is to make heavy metal, based mainly on the influences of NWOBHM, but with Latin swing, emerging exotic rhythms and sounds, inherited from Brazilian miscegenation, without ever forgetting the weight factor.\n\nThe band owns a special charisma, seeks to get involved in rich, enigmatic and controversial themes, thus being able to express their vision of the current world, without sounding massive and opinion-forming. In the midst of so many bands that copy each other, DYNASTY OF METAL presents more effective weapons: being original, creative, daring, strong and sincere.\n\nAccustomed to living on the road, with many concerts in almost all regions of Brazil, Argentina, participating in festivals or various events. In early 2009 they left for their first international tour, where they performed several concerts, passing through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Chile. There were 18 concerts in 32 days, long trips and difficulties, but in the end everything was happy, with the certainty of a brief return.\n\nAs with all bands, line-up changes are inevitable, with rare exceptions, with DYNASTY OF METAL changes have happened several times and certainly will happen again.\n\nThe band made a strategic break between October 2010 and January 2011, returning at full speed. This time was necessary for the band’s external affairs to adjust and for them to be able to continue the process, at the end of that time the band returned to rehearsals, polishing the new compositions and reinvigorating the old ones.\n\nThe return also brought the change in the name of the band, to avoid undesirable copyright disorders, it was called “Dynasty of Metal”, but still called by fans only “Dynasty”.\n\n2016 was the year of the band’s twentieth anniversary, a new work was prepared in celebration of this historic date.\n\nThis work was named “Step by Step”, it has nine new songs, two orchestrated reinterpretations of their first two albums, a cover of a great Minas Gerais metal band, in addition to three songs with Spanish versions, aiming to establish itself in the market. Latin American. During 15 days of July 2017 the band toured Uruguay and Argentina promoting their new album.\n\nDuring a pandemic in 2021, the band started rehearsals for the recording of the project “Back To The Past Tribute” With 16 covers of the bands that influenced us in our career and also an unpublished authorial song.\n\n8) What do you think is the key to longevity in business?\n\nLongevity for our business is based on our proposals to always make our songs and albums with the best possible quality, deliver a product that satisfies the interest of fans, record companies, ourselves, etc.\n\n9) Any hobbies besides music?\n\nHere in Brazil, we all love soccer, in the band everyone has their favorite team, we also play amateurly with friends.\n\nI like to walk through the forests and waterfalls that exist in my city Nova Lima/MG. @bomsera (Visit)\n\n10) How to get merchandise?\n\nThe Brazilian version directly with the band nahor.andrade@gmail.com\n\nThe American on @bill_roxx_records\n\n11) Any message for your fans?\n\nWe thank all fans old, new and supporters who continue to support Christian metal bands, so that the messages reach all over the land.\n\nI would like to thank Bill Roxx for believing in this project, which is now a reality. And also to everyone who supported us during the construction of this album.\n\n—\n\nNahor Andrade\n\nHeavy Metal Is My Business"
