Life and Times of S. Carter (1999)\n\nNext\n\nThe Blueprint (2001)\n\nThe Dynasty: Roc La Familia is the fifth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z, released in 2000 on Roc-A-Fella Records. Originally a Roc-A-Fella compilation album that was to showcase the label's artists, it eventually became a Jay-Z solo album that has an abundance of Roc-A-Fella artists featuring. Rather than using big-name producers such as Swizz Beatz and Timbaland, who had featured prominently on his previous albums, Jay-Z decided to enlist more up-and-coming producers at the time, such as Just Blaze, Kanye West and Bink!, who would later achieve notable success partially as a result of this exposure. This was also the first album of Jay-Z's to not feature work by longtime collaborator DJ Premier. Given Just Blaze and Kanye West's style of utilising soul samples in their beats, the album features a smoother sound than Jay-Z's previous albums.\n\nThe album peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 with over 500,000 copies sold in its first week, and has since sold 2.3 million copies to date. Its lead single, The Neptunes-produced \"I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)\", became one of Jay-Z's most successful singles, peaking at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Dynasty received mostly positive reviews from music critics and became the 20th highest selling R&B/Hip-Hop Album of the 2000-2010 decade according to Billboard.\n\nTrack listing[]"
