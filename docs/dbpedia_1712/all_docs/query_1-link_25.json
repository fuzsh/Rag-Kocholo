        "text": "Tomorrow will mark the 30th anniversary that Kiss released Dynasty, their 7th studio album (discounting the solo albums). It was almost 2 years before Kiss released, Love Gun, their last studio album together. In that span there was a live album, compilation, 4 solo albums, a TV movie, and not to mention lots of toys, games, and other merchandise such as dolls. By the time Dynasty came out, their fan base changed. The album and the forthcoming tour drew a younger, family orientated fan base. The teenagers that liked Kiss a few years earlier have now grown up. Kiss’ change in musical direction didn’t help either. Dumping Eddie Kramer, their producer for RNR Over and Love Gun, for pop-producer Vini Poncia made them more commercial. I Was Made for Loving You, a disco-rock track, was a worldwide hit and finally got Kiss chart success in Europe and Australia. This would help them immensely as they would suffer some lean years Stateside. Dynasty would peak at # 9 on the Billboard album charts.\n\nMy review:\n\nI love this album. I felt there was sameness w/ RNR Over and Love Gun and they were great albums but very inter-changeable. This album is one of the more interesting ones in Kiss’ catalog given the band’s state of mind at the time: Peter only drummed on one song and would be gone less than a year later. Gene was busy with Cher. Paul is trying to keep it together. Ace is inspired after the success of his solo album and comes up with strong material for his 3 songs.\n\nI Was Made For Loving You: It’s no Stone’s Miss You but still it’s a really catchy disco-rock song. The extended mix found on the original 12” and on the We Are One CD single is fantastic. Great solo by Ace too.\n\n2,000 Man: Interesting pick for a cover and with Ace’s Spaceman persona he pulls it off well.\n\nSure Know Something: Interesting that it didn’t become a bigger hit as it fit the radio landscape at the time. Paul does a rare guitar solo on this. Check out the Unplugged version as it much better in stripped down form.\n\nDirty Livin’: One of my favorite Peter songs. Too bad he didn’t go this harder direction for his solo album.\n\nCharisma and X-Ray Eyes: Gene’s Dynasty songs are the weakest of the entire album. Charisma is better than X-Ray Eyes though.\n\nMagic Touch: Paul did an amazing version of this on his 2006 solo tour. Check it out on Youtube.\n\nHard Times and Save Your Love: A great pair of Ace tunes. One listen of Save Your Love and you would know that it’s Anton Fig on drums.\n\nSure Kiss totally sells out on this album but I think it's a good example of a band selling out and having it actually work musically. I think it would've been boring getting a Love Gun II.\n\nAny other fans or detractors of this album?\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nDynasty is a studio album by the American hard rock band Kiss. The album, and its subsequent tour, was billed as the \"Return of Kiss.\" The band as a full unit had not released a studio album since 1977 and had not toured since the Spring of 1978. The album would restore the band to commercial prominence, reaching # 9 on the US Billboard album chart.\n\nKiss enlisted Vini Poncia, who produced Peter Criss's solo album, to produce Dynasty. After pre-production and rehearsals were completed, Poncia decided to exclude Criss from most of the recording, judging him unable to drum well enough. Criss, by this time, had fallen deep into substance abuse and was also recovering from an automobile accident. He performed on only one song, \"Dirty Livin'.\" The rest of the drums were recorded by Anton Fig, who played drums on Ace Frehley's 1978 solo album.\n\nThe first single from the album, \"I Was Made For Lovin' You,\" marked a rather drastic stylistic departure for Kiss. It had a pronounced disco beat, and was a success at a time when disco was at its peak popularity.\n\nAfter waiting nearly three years to record lead vocals for a Kiss song (1977's \"Shock Me\"), Ace Frehley contributed three to Dynasty - \"2,000 Man,\" \"Hard Times\" and \"Save Your Love.\" \"2,000 Man,\" a cover of the 1967 Rolling Stones song, would become a concert staple for Kiss and one of Frehley's signature songs. \"Hard Times\" and \"Save Your Love\" were recorded in the same hard rock style as Frehley's solo album. This was the only Kiss album where Frehley sang as many songs as Paul Stanley and more than Gene Simmons. Simmons, one of the band's primary songwriters, sings only two. (Reportedly Simmons was not happy with the idea of doing a disco oriented record and as a result had less input on the album.)\n\nWhile \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" remains a permanent staple on the band's shows, much of the album's songs (other than \"Sure Know Something,\" and \"2000 Man\") have rarely been played live after the Dynasty tour. In 2006, Paul Stanley resurrected \"Magic Touch,\" which was played every night on the \"Live to Win\" tour.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1.\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" (Paul Stanley, Vini Poncia, Desmond Child) – 4:33 (US #11)\n\n2.\"2,000 Man\" (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards) – 4:56\n\n3.\"Sure Know Something\" (Stanley, Poncia) – 4:01 (US # 47)\n\n4.\"Dirty Livin'\" (Peter Criss, Poncia, Stan Penridge) – 4:27\n\n5.\"Charisma\" (Gene Simmons, Howard Marks) – 4:25\n\n6.\"Magic Touch\" (Stanley) – 4:42\n\n7.\"Hard Times\" (Ace Frehley) – 3:31\n\n8.\"X-Ray Eyes\" (Simmons) – 3:46\n\n9.\"Save Your Love\" (Frehley) – 4:40\n\nPersonnel\n\nGene Simmons – bass guitar, lead vocals\n\nPaul Stanley – rhythm guitar, lead vocals, lead guitar on \"Sure Know Something\n\nAce Frehley – lead guitar, lead vocals on \"2,000 Man\", \"Hard Times\" and \"Save Your Love\"\n\nPeter Criss – drums, percussion, lead vocals on \"Dirty Livin\"\n\nwith\n\nAnton Fig – drums (1-3, 5-9) (uncredited)\n\nVini Poncia – producer, keyboards and backing vocals on \"I Was Made For Lovin' You,\" backing vocals on \"Sure Know Something”\n\nVideos:\n\nKiss Dynasty (commercial)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHHbaxZkXuI\n\nI Was Made For Loving You (promo)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnqUAbGMjLI\n\nSure Know Something (promo)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_wCqV9_zgk\n\nSure Know Something (MTV Unplugged)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j3MCO8rYCI\n\nPaul Stanley- Magic Touch (solo tour)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GSTlk8Hfsk\n\nAttached Files:\n\n333a729fd7a0f5aebad60110.L.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n43.8 KB\n\nViews:\n\n0"
