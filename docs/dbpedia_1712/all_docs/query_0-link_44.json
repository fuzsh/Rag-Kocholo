        "meta_description": "I Can Tell by Dynasty, released 31 December 2021\n\n1. I Can Tell\n2. Still In Love\n\nLegendary Los Angeles R&amp;B group DYNASTY IS BACK TOGETHER and releasing their first record since 1988 on Austin Boogie Crew!\r\n\r\nReturning with five original members (Nidra Sylvers, Linda Van Horssen, Kevin Spencer, Ricky Smith, and Wardell Potts, Jr.), Dynasty is poised to continue their 40+ year legacy of disco-boogie-funk music. Regularly appearing on the US R&amp;B, US Dance, and UK charts, the band created a myriad of hits over the years:\r\n\r\n“I Don’t Want to Be a Freak”\r\n“Do Me Right”\r\n“I’ve Just Begun to Love You”\r\n“Adventures in the Land of Music”\r\n“Groove Control”\r\n“Here I Am”\r\n“Love in the Fast Lane”\r\n“Check It Out”\r\n\r\nFrom 1979-88, Dynasty was an integral part of the SOLAR (Sound of Los Angeles Records) roster, releasing six classic albums as a group and penning songs for label-mates Shalamar, The Whispers, Klymaxx, and Carrie Lucas. Dynasty’s illustrious catalog has endured in the decades since; their songs remain staples in DJ sets worldwide and have been sampled in beloved hip-hop jams like Camp Lo’s “Luchini.”\r\n\r\nNow at long last after 33 years, the group is teaming with Austin Boogie Crew to offer their comeback vinyl single! &quot;I Can Tell&quot; and &quot;Still in Love&quot; are two brand new dance-floor heaters that prove Dynasty hasn’t lost a step! This fresh, uplifting, modern record will delight longtime fans and introduce a new generation to their impeccable songwriting and timeless sound.",
