        "text": "Taylor Swift surprised the music industry and fans alike this week when she released a new album without her typical build-up, hype and fanfare.\n\n“Most of the things I had planned this summer didn’t end up happening, but there is something I hadn’t planned on that DID happen,” she wrote on Instagram. “And that thing is my 8th studio album, folklore. Surprise”\n\nPerhaps most interesting to Rhode Island readers will be her song, “The Last Great American Dynasty,” where she recounts the history of her Westerly home.\n\nThe song focuses on Rebekah Harkness, a divorcée who famously married into the Standard Oil fortune in 1947, and patron to several New York City dance companies. Swift writes:\n\nBill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money\n\nAnd the town said, \"How did a middle-class divorcée do it?\"\n\nThe wedding was charming, if a little gauche\n\nThere's only so far new money goes\n\nThey picked out a home and called it \"Holiday House\"\n\nTheir parties were tasteful, if a little loud.\n\nHoliday House is the name of Swift’s Watch Hill mansion.\n\nThe lyrics go on to highlight some of Harkness’ more famous antics, which include cleaning her pool with Dom Pérignon, dyeing a pet green, and her relationship with artist Salvador Dali.\n\nRebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever\n\nFlew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city\n\nFilled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names\n\nAnd blew through the money on the boys and the ballet\n\nAnd losing on card game bets with Dalí\n\nThe underlying tension within the lyrics focuses on Westerly’s perception of this “madwoman.”\n\nThere goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen\n\nShe had a marvelous time ruining everything\n\nHarkness certainly is hard to pin down by modern standards. “Blue Blood,” Craig Unger’s 1988 biography, details her life. Its subtitle: “The story of Rebekah Harkness and how one of the richest families in the world descended into drugs, madness, suicide, and violence.”\n\nStill, a New York Times book review wonders, “It might also have been interesting to see how a feminist writer would have assimilated the facts of Rebekah Harkness's sorry life. Might Mrs. Harkness be seen as a casualty of her own doomed and defiled expectations? Unfit for mothering, unfit for ordinary love, unfit — untrained — to be the caretaker of a great fortune, was she altogether silly or altogether bad? Was she power or pawn? And how in the world did she get that way?”\n\nAs the song concludes, it turns, juxtaposing Swift’s ownership of the house with Harkness’ — thematically linking the two “loud women” and their relationship with Westerly.\n\nFifty years is a long time\n\nHoliday House sat quietly on that beach\n\nFree of women with madness, their men and bad habits\n\nAnd then it was bought by me\n\nWho knows, if I never showed up, what could've been\n\nThere goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen\n\nI had a marvelous time ruining everything\n\nTwo notable elements where Swift has taken creative license:\n\nFirst, it was a cat that Harkness dyed green, not a dog.\n\nSecond, while Harkness may have developed a somewhat fractious relationship with the rest of Westerly, Swift clearly adores her adopted ocean oasis.\n\nDuring an appearance on the “Ellen” show last year, Swift was quick to say that Rhode Island was her favorite place in the the world to go on holiday.\n\nThe town is clearly thrilled that she’s there as well, one local said — \"I just hope that as a neighbor, she will be here for a while.”"
