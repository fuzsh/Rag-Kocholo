Arundells, the cherished residence of the UK's former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath, is set to celebrate the nation's profound maritime legacy with the annual Morning Cloud Sailing Talks 2023. This captivating event, paying homage to Sir Edward Heath's passion for sailing, will take place on Friday, 17th November at Sarum College in Salisbury.

This event pays tribute to Sir Edward Heath's significant contributions to sailing and his exceptional achievements in competitive yachting. Despite not taking up sailing until the age of 50, Sir Edward famously competed in and won international trophies, marking him as a prominent figure in the sailing community.

The Morning Cloud Sailing Talks will feature two esteemed speakers:

First, Peter Forbes, a seasoned sailor since childhood, will regale the audience with tales of his global circumnavigation aboard the storied yacht, Carango. His experiences, from learning to sail a Felucca on the River Nile aged 8, to undertaking extensive modifications on Carango, speak to a life dedicated to sailing, mirroring the passion Sir Edward had for the sea.

Following this, historian Andrew Campbell will delve into the intense 'Five days in August', a presentation on Operation Pedestal, a crucial WWII mission. His account will focus on the tanker Ohio, underscoring the incredible bravery exhibited during one of the most daring naval operations of the Second World War.

Luke Futcher, Events & Marketing Manager at Arundells, said:

"Hosting The Morning Cloud Sailing Talks reflects our commitment to preserving Sir Edward Heath's sailing legacy."

"We aim to provide an insightful experience that resonates not only with sailing enthusiasts and admirers of Sir Edward's nautical endeavours, but also those with a passion for history and captivating human interest stories."

Sir Edward Heath's sailing accomplishments, including winning the Sydney Hobart Race and the Admiral's Cup, are well-documented aspects of his multifaceted life. His dedication to sailing was profound, evidenced by his collection of Morning Cloud yachts and the triumphs they brought.

The Morning Cloud Sailing Talks 2023 promises to be a day of rich storytelling and historical reflection, all set against the backdrop of Sir Edward's remarkable life and the walls within which he once resided.

Tickets and additional information about the event are available through Arundells' official website. Attendees are encouraged to book early to ensure their place at this unique homage to one of Britain's most notable Prime Ministers and sailors.
