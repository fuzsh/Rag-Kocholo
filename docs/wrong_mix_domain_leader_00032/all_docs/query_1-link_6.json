        "text": "Edward Heath\n\n'The power of the podium is far greater than that of the prime minister.' - Edward Heath\n\nA former British prime minister and an accomplished pianist, Edward Heath was born on 9 July 1916 to a carpenter and a lady's maid. Heath's lifelong devotion to music began with piano lessons at the age of 8. He also learnt to play the organ whilst at school, and conducted the school orchestra and a local choir. By amateur standards, he became a good conductor, training the Balliol Choral Society whilst at Oxford (with an organ scholarship), and conducting the Oxford Orchestra."
