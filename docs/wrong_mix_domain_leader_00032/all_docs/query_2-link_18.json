        "text": "Sponsor\n\nGovernor General of Canada\n\nAward Details\n\nNominations can be made at any time.\n\nEstablished in 1967 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the Order of Canada is the cornerstone of the Canadian Honours System, and recognizes outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the nation. The Order recognizes people in all sectors of Canadian society. Their contributions are varied, yet they have all enriched the lives of others and made a difference to this country. They exemplify the Order’s motto: DESIDERANTES MELIOREM PATRIAM (“They desire a better country”).\n\nAll Canadians are eligible to be nominated for the Order of Canada, with the exception of federal and provincial politicians and judges while in office. Non-Canadians can be considered for “honorary” appointments if they have made a sustained and exceptional contribution to Canada. There are no posthumous appointments.\n\nCategories:"
