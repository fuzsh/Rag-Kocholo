        "text": "Some believe Ted Heath’s ruthless ambition to become Prime Minister meant that he hid what he considered was his darkest secret.\n\nWhen his political career started to take off in the 1950s, homosexuality was considered a bar to a seat in Parliament.\n\nSo Heath did everything he could to mask his desire for gay sex.\n\nBut there were Westminster insiders who believed that there was a more sinister side to his sexuality - a weakness to find boys willing to sell their bodies to wealthy professional men.\n\nOne of the strongest rumours was that Heath, while Tory MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup, preyed on vulnerable young men.\n\nThe claims were serious enough he apparently had a visit from Special Branch officers who told him that not only was it illegal to go “cottaging” but it would end his career in politics.\n\nThe damning accusation of his seedy sex interest did not emerge until 2007, two years after his death, when a fellow Tory publicly “outed” him for the first time.\n\nBrian Coleman, a member of the London Assembly who was then one of the party’s most prominent gay politicians, wrote in the a magazine article that Heath had once been warned in the 1950s by police - who were vetting him for membership of the Privy Council - to stop seeking out gay sex in public places.\n\nFriends and allies forever maintained he never wavered from his ambition to hold high office and would have never compromised his ultimate goal of entering Number 10 for mere “sins of the flesh”.\n\nThe lifelong bachelor continued to be a source of ridicule in the pages of satirical magazines, referring to him as “Sailor Ted”, a sly nod to his love of sailing and suggested homosexuality.\n\nSuch was the interest and confusion over his sexuality it was even claimed by a former Czechoslovakian spy that his country had mounted a secret homosexual blackmail plot against him.\n\nIn the 60s, a Cold War-era defector called Josef Frolik claimed Soviet spies attempted to conjure a meeting between a renowned classical musician and Heath, whereby the world class organ player would attempt to seduce the politician and leave him open to blackmail.\n\nBeside the allegation in Frolik’s memoir, however, there was no evidence of the plan actually ever being executed.\n\nAside from the constant gossip and innuendo over his rumoured sexual preferences , as Prime Minister Heath presided over some of the most turbulent years in Britain’s post war history.\n\nHis time in Downing Street - from 1970 to 1974 - was marked by widespread industrial unrest with power blackouts and much of the country reduced to a three-day working week.\n\nPerhaps his crowning achievement was to negotiate Britain’s entry into the Common Market as the EU was then known - a decision that continues to divide Conservatives 40 years on.\n\nHis time in office ended after he lost a snap general election which he had called to try to bolster his authority in the face of a second coal miners’ strike.\n\nHe never forgave Margaret Thatcher for ousting him as Tory leader, for years nursing a grudge which became known as the “incredible sulk”.\n\nHe continued on the back benches until 2001, often attending Parliament to sit in silence, muttering the odd sneer of disapproval.\n\nBorn in the July 1916, the son of a carpenter and a maid from the coastal town of Broadstairs in Kent, was seemingly never destined for greatness.\n\nBut from humble beginnings he went onto to the respected Chatham House Grammar School in Ramsgate, and in 1935 he went on to study at the prestigious Balliol College, Oxford.\n\nHe later served in the Royal Artillery during World War Two, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel after participating in the Normandy Landings.\n\nHe was awarded an MBE for services to the military in January 1946 before he embarked on one of longest political careers in British history.\n\nIn addition his 51 year political career, he was a celebrated author, a world class musician and prize-winning yachtsman.\n\nBut far from revered as a darling of the establishment, Heath’s terse manner and steadfast ambition resulted in him being a constant source of gossip and innuendo among the chattering classes.\n\nHorrified friends of Heath rallied to defend the former PM against the swirl of allegations.\n\nJeremy Norman, Heath’s close friend and partner of Derek Frost, an interior designer who helped the politician renovate his sprawling country manor Arundells in Salisbury, Wilts, said he couldn’t believe the former MP “would be into sex at all let alone young boys”.\n\nMr Norman, a prominent gay entrepreneur who founded Heaven, London’s most famous gay nightclub and continues to run a chain of gyms in Soho, has previously stated he believed Heath was a closet homosexual.\n\nHe told the Mirror: “I would find it amazing because he was such a sort of closed person and emotionally neutered really.\n\n“My view was that he, as a very intelligent man, realised he couldn’t achieve his ambition with a homosexual lifestyle at that time and he made a conscious decision to bottle up his sexuality in order to be Prime Minister.\n\n“I think the poor guy was probably never very confident sexually from the get go and probably not that highly sexed.\n\n\"He was a deeply talented man in many areas and deeply ambitious so he made pact with himself to forgo those desires.”\n\nHeath not only became renowned for his bachelor lifestyle but also his dismissive nature of women in general.\n\nHe remained distant from his family throughout his adult life but there were, however, two women from his past whom he formed close friendships with for a time.\n\nOne of them was a childhood friend, Kay Raven, who exchanged letters with Heath for several years.\n\nBut she is understood to have become tired of waiting for their relationship to become more intimate and later married an RAF officer.\n\nHeath’s passion for the arts, a world class organ player and being particularly accomplished at interior design, led him to form a friendship with female musician Moura Lympany.\n\nShe had agreed to marry him on being urged to do so by the Conservative MP Colonel Sir Tufton Beamish, but a proposal never materialised.\n\nHeath died in 2005 at the age of 89, leaving his Wiltshire manor house and its contents worth £5million to the state in order for it to be preserved as a lasting memory of his legacy.\n\nHe left £20,000 to his brother’s widow and just £2,500 to his loyal housekeeper."
