        "text": "Excerpt (page 4 only) of a Confidential Report from Mr. Geoffrey Rippon, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to the Prime Minister in London after his meeting with President Amin:\n\nAmin hoped that friendly countries would send doctors and lawyers to replace the Asians he was expelling.\n\nThree months was too long for the Asians to leave and Britain would find that they would have the same problems with them.\n\nAmin would prefer to have British people replacing the expelled Asians.\n\nWhile the British had established an administrative system (in Uganda) that was better than that in other African countries, Amin pointed out that there was still racial prejudice and antagonism in Britain, such as was found in the United States and Rhodesia.\n\nConfidential Report circulating within the Foreign & Commonwealth Office on QUESTION OF A GENERAL APPEAL TO OTHER COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE SOME OF THE UGANDAN ASIANS\n\nIt is fascinating to read the analysis of various governments attitudes and their likely response to the request to take in Asians from Uganda.\n\nUnemployment is one of their main worries and this gives us an idea of the world economic setting in which the expulsion took place.\n\nRacial imbalance and political tensions also figure often in these very frank comments and the attitude towards Asians of Indian origin gives one food for thought.\n\nBelow we give some the more interesting responses:\n\nGuyana – Inhabitants of African origin who by tradition support the present Government are already outnumbered by inhabitants of Indian descent who tend to vote for the Opposition party. Quite apart from unemployment problems the Guyana Government for political reasons would certainly not admit more Indians – as it is they are believed to fiddle the elections in order to stay in power.\n\nCeylon (now Sri Lanka) – has a large Indian community brought in by the British to work the tea estates whom Ceylon has long tried to offload (with indifferent success) on India. No question of their being agreeable to adding to their unpopular Indian community.\n\nFiji – their large Indian community already presents a major political problem. The Fiji Government could never accept more Asians.\n\nMalaysia – has a fairly large number of Indians who are not Malaysian citizens and every now and again the right of non-citizen Asians to continue to work in Malaysia blows up as a political issue. Malaysian Government would not therefore admit more Asians.\n\nAustralia – some press comment warning Australia would have to study very carefully the question of admitting some Uganda Asians. Could become a possible issue in the forthcoming election.\n\nCanada – indications are Canada might be willing to consider taking some Asians from Uganda.\n\nNew Zealand – National Council of Churches have urged NZ should take some. The Minister of Immigration is reported to have said that the situation is being studied – in case where a refugee situation has arisen, the Governments position has usually been positive and some refugees have been admitted. But the Government refused to be drawn in a subsequent PQ (parliamentary question).\n\nConfidential Letter from Mr. Anthony Acland, Foreign & Commonwealth Office, to Lord Tom Bridges of the Prime Ministers Office at 10 Downing Street, to brief the Rt. Hon. Edward Heath on efforts in various departments to follow-up offers of help from other governments. The approaches to various countries are listed in annex.\n\nCanada and Malawi are the only countries who agree to take significant numbers of Asians from Uganda.\n\nAustralia – the choice was between professional Asians and votes in the next election\n\nNew Zealand – wished to mobilise other countries to help but was not willing to be mobilised itself.\n\nSouth Africa – the British Government actually asked the Apartheid government of the day if they would help and when they agreed to recommend to Cabinet that 5,000 Asians be taken, British officials in the FCO realise it would not be politically feasible!\n\nIran – British officials have learned that His Highness the Aga Khan would be asking the Shah of Iran to accept some of his followers for settlement although, it is acknowledged, few would be UK Passport Holders.\n\nUnited Nations – British Government officials tried to persuade the Secretary General, Dr. Kurt Waldheim, to visit Uganda in person with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, His Highness Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, but they failed."
