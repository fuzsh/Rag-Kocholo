This is projected to provide approximately an additional $17 billion over 10 years in new support. The last top-up payment will be rolled into the CHT base at the end of the five years to ensure a permanent funding increase, providing certainty and sustainability to provinces and territories;\n\nWHEREAS, Working Together to Improve Health Care for Canadians includes a federal commitment of $25 billion in bilateral funding to provinces and territories over ten years focused on four shared health priorities:\n\nexpanding access to family health services, including in rural and remote areas;\n\nsupporting our health workers and reducing backlogs;\n\nimproving access to quality mental health, substance use, and addictions services; and\n\nmodernizing health systems with health data and digital tools.\n\nWHEREAS, in the area of mental health, substance use, and addictions services, Working Together to Improve Health Care for Canadians also includes a commitment by Canada and Prince Edward Island to continue to work to support collaboration on the Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities (hereinafter referred to as the \"Common Statement\", attached hereto as Annex 1), supported by the federal Budget 2017 investment of $5 billion over ten years;\n\nWHEREAS, Prince Edward Island has the primary responsibility for delivering health care services to its residents and supports diversity, equity, and the needs of underserved and/or disadvantaged populations, including, but not limited to First Nations, Inuit and Métis, official language minority communities, rural and remote communities, children, racialized communities (including Black Canadians), and LGBTIQA2S+;\n\nWHEREAS, Canada authorized the federal Ministers to enter into agreements with the provinces and territories, for the purpose of identifying activities that provinces and territories will undertake in respect of the four shared health priorities, and for funding in this Agreement associated with the federal investment for mental health, substance use, and addictions services consistent with the Common Statement (and menu of actions outlined in Annex 1);\n\nWHEREAS, the Financial Administration Act R.S.P.E.I, c- F-9 authorized the provincial Minister to enter into agreements with the Government of Canada under which Canada undertakes to provide funding toward costs incurred by the Government of Prince Edward Island associated with the federal investment for four shared health priorities, and mental health, substance use and addictions services consistent with the Common Statement; and\n\nNOW THEREFORE, this Agreement sets out the terms between Canada and Prince Edward Island as follows:\n\n1.0 Key principles and collaboration\n\nThe key principles and commitment to collaboration agreed to in Working Together to Improve Health Care for Canadians are outlined below.\n\n1.1 Canada and Prince Edward Island acknowledge that this Agreement will mutually respect each government's jurisdiction, and be underpinned by key principles, including:\n\nA shared responsibility to uphold the Canada Health Act that strengthens our public health care system;\n\nPrinciples agreed to in the Common Statement (outlined in Annex 1);\n\nReconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, recognizing their right to fair and equal access to quality and culturally safe health services free from racism and discrimination anywhere in Canada, including through seamless service delivery across jurisdictions and meaningful engagement and work with Indigenous organizations and governments; and\n\nEquity of access for under-served groups and individuals, including those in official language minority communities.\n\n1.2 Canada and Prince Edward Island acknowledge the importance of supporting health data infrastructure, data collection and public reporting, and will work together to improve the collection, sharing and use of de-identified health information, respecting federal/provincial/territorial privacy legislation, to improve transparency on results and to help manage public health emergencies, and to ensure Canadians can access their own health information and benefit from it being shared between health workers across health settings. This includes:\n\ncollecting and securely sharing high-quality, comparable information needed to improve services to Canadians, including disaggregated data on key common health indicators with the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI);\n\nadopting common interoperability standards (both technical exchange and content of data), including the Shared pan-Canadian Interoperability Roadmap (outlined in Annex 2), to improve Canadians' access to their health information in a usable digital format and support the exchange and analysis of health data within and across Canada's health systems in a way that protects Canadians' privacy and ensures the ethical use of data to improve the health and lives of people;\n\nwork to align provincial and territorial policies and legislative frameworks where necessary and appropriate to support secure patient access to health information, and stewardship of health information to support the public good, including improving care quality, patient safety, privacy protection, system governance and oversight, planning and research;\n\npromoting health information as a public good by working with federal-provincial-territorial Ministers of Health to review and confirm overarching principles, which would affirm Canadians' ability to access their health information and have it follow them across all points of care. The existing draft Health Data Charter, as outlined in the Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy would serve as the starting point for the discussion of these principles; and\n\ncollecting and sharing available public health data (e.g., vaccination data, testing data) with the Public Health Agency of Canada to support Canada's preparedness and response to public health events, building on commitments made as part of the Safe Restart Agreements.\n\n1.3 Canada and Prince Edward Island acknowledge they will work with other provinces and territories to streamline foreign credential recognition for internationally-educated health professionals, and to advance labour mobility, starting with multi-jurisdictional recognition of health professional licences.\n\n1.4 Canada and Prince Edward Island acknowledge a mutual intent to engage in a two-phased formal review process:\n\nPhase 1: This review will be done in 2026 by a joint committee of Federal, Provincial, and Territorial health and finance officials to assess results and determine next steps for bilateral agreements related to improvements to home and community care, mental health, substance use, and addiction services associated with the Common Statement and long-term care; and\n\nPhase 2: A formal five-year review of the healthcare plan outlined on February 7, 2023, recognizing the importance of long-term sustainability for provincial-territorial health systems. This review would consist of an assessment of both the bilateral agreements (herein) and the CHT investments (not included as part of this bilateral agreement). The review will be done by a joint committee of Federal, Provincial, and Territorial health and finance officials, commencing by March 31, 2027, and concluded by December 31, 2027, to consider results achieved thus far in the four shared health priority areas and will include:\n\nan assessment of progress-to-date on public reporting to Canadians using the common indicators;\n\nsharing of de-identified health information, and other health data commitments; and\n\ncurrent and forward-looking Federal, Provincial, and Territorial investments to support this plan.\n\n2.0 Objectives\n\n2.1 Canada and Prince Edward Island agree that, with financial support from Canada, Prince Edward Island will continue to build and enhance health care systems towards achieving some or all of the objectives of:\n\ntimely access to high-quality family health services, including in rural and remote areas;\n\na sustainable, efficient and resilient health workforce that provides Canadians timely access to high-quality, effective, and safe health services;\n\naccess to timely, equitable, and quality mental health, substance use, and addictions services to support Canadians' well-being; and\n\naccess to a patient's own electronic health information that is shared between the health professionals they consult to improve safety and quality of care, and which informs Canadians on how the system is working.\n\n2.2 Canada and Prince Edward Island agree that, with Budget 2017 financial support from Canada outlined in 5.2.2, Prince Edward Island will continue to work to improve access to mental health, substance use, and addictions services consistent with the Common Statement (and menu of actions outlined in Annex 1).\n\n3.0 Action plan\n\n3.1 Prince Edward Island set out in their Action Plan (attached as Annex 4) how the federal investment under this Agreement will be used, as well as details on targets and timeframes based on common headline indicators in priority areas where federal funds will be invested, as well as jurisdiction-specific indicators, for each of the initiatives.\n\n3.2 Prince Edward Island will invest federal funding as part of the 2017 commitment for mental health, substance use, and addictions services provided through this Agreement in alignment with the menu of actions listed in the Common Statement.\n\n3.3 Prince Edward Island will invest federal funding in some or all of the four shared health priority areas, without displacing existing planned spending in those areas.\n\n3.4 In developing initiatives under this Agreement, Prince Edward Island agrees to implement measures that also respond to the needs of underserved and/or disadvantaged populations, including, but not limited to First Nations, Inuit and Métis, official language minority communities, rural and remote communities, children, racialized communities (including Black Canadians), and LGBTIQA2S+.\n\n3.5 Prince Edward Island's approach to achieving objectives is set out in their three-year Action Plan (2023-24 to 2025-26), as set out in Annex 4.\n\n4.0 Term of agreement\n\n4.1 This Agreement comes into effect upon the date of the last signature of the Parties and will remain in effect until March 31, 2026 (\"the Term\"), unless terminated in accordance with section 11 of this Agreement.

The initiatives identified in this action plan build upon ongoing efforts to modernize PEI's health care system and address the challenges impacting access to, and delivery of, health care services in the province and nationally. These initiatives align with healthcare system strategic plans and the Provincial Health Plan in development.\n\n1.0 Summary of context and current healthcare system status\n\nThe new Shared Health Priorities agreement will focus on four areas: Family Health Teams; Health Workforce and Backlogs; Mental Health and Substance Use; and Modernizing Health Data Systems.\n\n1.1 How are health services currently delivered in Prince Edward Island?\n\nPEI's Health Services Act defines a range of health services that are delivered under the direction of the Minister of Health and Wellness. Overall, these services are delivered by Health PEI or the Department of Health and Wellness (the Department), or through provisions made by the Department.\n\nHealth PEI\n\nHealth PEI is responsible for the operation and delivery of publicly funded health services across the province. The principal areas for which Health PEI is responsible for the provision of service are:\n\nHospital-based Services\n\nAcute Care: Prince County Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital provide a variety of services including but not limited to emergency, in-patient medical, surgical, pediatric, physical medicine, ambulatory, rehabilitative, palliative, and cancer care. Also, acute mental health services are provided at Hillsborough Hospital (see below).\n\nCommunity Hospitals: Community Hospital O'Leary, Kings County Memorial Hospital, Souris Hospital, and Western Community Hospital provide a variety of services including emergency, acute in-patient, ambulatory, convalescent/rehabilitative, palliative, and respite care.\n\nDiagnostic Imaging\n\nLaboratory\n\nPharmacy Services\n\nMental Health and Addictions Services\n\nAcute Mental Health Services: provided at PCH, QEH, and Hillsborough Hospital (69-bed psychiatric hospital that provides specialized care, long-term treatment, and rehabilitation for individuals facing acute or enduring mental illness.)\n\nAddiction Services\n\nCommunity Mental Health\n\nPrimary Care and Community-Based Health Services\n\nPrimary Care Clinics and Programs\n\nChronic Disease Management\n\nHome Care, Palliative Care, and Geriatric Care\n\nPublic Health and Children's Developmental Services Programs\n\nProvincial Dental Health Program\n\nLong-term Care\n\nHealth PEI Long-term Care through nine public nursing facilities\n\nPrivate Nursing Home Subsidies to 10 private long-term care facilities\n\nMedical Programs\n\nIn-Province and Out-of-Province\n\nDepartment of Health and Wellness\n\nIn addition to general policy and operations, the Department ensures the provision of the following programs and services either through direct service delivery or through funding.

At-a-glance, these priorities and sub-priorities are:\n\nPriority 1 A Healthy and Sustainable Workforce\n\nCapacity, Recruitment and Retention\n\nSupporting our Workforce\n\nPartnerships and Collaboration\n\nPriority 2 Seamless Experience, Right Time, Right Place, Right Care\n\nSeamless Access to Care\n\nPerson Centred Care\n\nCoordinated Care\n\nPriority 3 Equitable Access\n\nAddressing Inequality\n\nGeographies of Interest\n\nTarget Age Groups\n\nPriority 4 Keeping our Island Healthy\n\nHealth and Wellness of All Residents\n\nChronic Disease Prevention and Management\n\nMental Health and Mental Wellness\n\nThe four health system priorities and associated sub-priorities align closely with the four Shared Health Priorities – Family Health Teams, Health Workforce and Backlogs, Mental Health and Substance Use, and Modernizing Health Data Systems. A brief overview of the alignment between Provincial health system priorities and the Shared Health Priorities follows here:\n\nFamily health teams (primary care)\n\nTimely access to safe, quality healthcare is essential to the overall health of the population. To improve seamless access to care, the Department of Health and Wellness and Health PEI are focusing on actions that define the care continuum and ensure timely access to primary care services for all PEI residents. As well, PEI's population is growing and expanding in diversity. These changes create valuable opportunities for the Island and communities across the province to build on the rich culture of PEI. Government and service providers will work with communities and underserved populations in the planning, delivery, and evaluation of initiatives to address social inequities in healthcare. Strategies to address imbalances and improve patient control and autonomy over care are instrumental to ensuring health services are person-centred.\n\nWhat we are doing:\n\nModernizing primary care in Prince Edward Island through implementation of the Primary Care Roadmap and the establishment of Patient Medical Homes and Patient Medical Neighbourhoods.\n\nContinuing to build a foundation of care that is community-based and delivered through collaborative team-based care models to provide services closest to home for as long as possible.\n\nEstablishing program and collaborative practice models to support effective and efficient care coordination by both patients and providers.\n\nExpanding mechanisms to promote communication and effective care coordination between programs across the healthcare system\n\nSupporting our partners in care to implement mechanisms to ensure patients are engaged in the planning and delivery of their care.\n\nExpanding initiatives that improve the experience for patients and families as they use and move through healthcare services.\n\nWork with underserved communities, including Indigenous, LGBTQ+, rural, and racialized communities to address barriers and gaps in social and fiscal policy at the root cause of social inequities in health.\n\nHealth workforce and backlogs\n\nA long-term plan for healthcare improvement requires a commitment to building a healthy and sustainable workforce. Core efforts to build resilience in the health workforce include building supply from domestic and international streams, expanding scopes of practice of care providers for system agility, using technology to streamline training and entry to practice, and creating healthy work environments that protect the health and wellness of our workforce. Also, Health PEI continues to address diagnostic backlogs in the health system prompted and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Investments in provincial diagnostic imaging services, patient flow and system utilization, laboratory services, and expanding teams and hours of operation will contribute to a reduction in backlogs in the near term.\n\nWhat we are doing:\n\nOptimizing workforce capacity by expanding professional and employment scopes of practice and growing the health professions regulated to work in PEI.\n\nDeveloping innovative solutions that streamline and integrate recruitment, hiring, and entry-to- practice processes for domestic and internationally trained health professionals.\n\nExpanding training options that enable people to train on the job and build a more agile workforce.\n\nEmbedding cultural safety into our healthcare system through education and quality improvements.\n\nMental health and substance use\n\nMental health is more than just the absence of mental illness and includes a strong focus on mental well-being. Investing wisely in the overall mental health system, including early intervention, treatment, and recovery, can make a significant difference to the health of the population. To that end, initiatives are underway in PEI to create programs and social policy that address multiple risk factors and ease access to mental health and substance use services.\n\nAlthough the Province of PEI does not intend to allocate Shared Health Priorities funding to this priority area in the 2023-24 to 2025-26 funding cycle, provincial and other funding (including funding through the 2017 Common Statement of Principles agreement) towards Mental Health and Substance use will continue to flow, and great strides are being made to establish a harm reduction site, establish additional mobile mental health units, and other mental health and addictions initiatives.\n\nWhat we are doing:\n\nInvesting in infrastructure and programming to strengthen care for all ages and improve access to acute, community-based, and specialized mental health and substance use services.\n\nWorking with partners to implement initiatives focused on mental health and wellness promotion, early intervention, and reducing disparities for underserved and higher-risk populations.\n\nWorking across government to coordinate and provide targeted initiatives for improved access to services for higher-risk populations.\n\nModernization of health data systems\n\nInnovative technological solutions can create meaningful change across the healthcare system, improving access to services and information for patients and providers. Advancing innovation through digital solutions like a province-wide Electronic Medical Record (EMR) solution will be a key enabler to support the health workforce and enable patients to better manage their own health through access to information.\n\nAlthough the Province of PEI does not intend to allocate Shared Health Priorities funding to this priority area in the 2023-24 to 2025-26 funding cycles, provincial and other funding towards modernizing health data systems will continue to support initiatives in this area including implementing province wide EMR, increasing access to virtual care, and other digital health initiatives.\n\nWhat we are doing:\n\nInvesting in virtual care and digital solutions to enable timely and seamless access to care.\n\nContinuing to implement the EMR and other technological and digital initiatives and platforms to improve access to care and information for patients.\n\nImplementing a digital health strategy that will guide the path forward for improved use of technology to achieve safe, quality, and efficient care.\n\nImproving the appropriate collection and use of data to address factors that impact health inequities in PEI.\n\nMaximizing advancements in technology and service delivery models to improve access and continuity of service for people living in rural areas, including establishing Island-wide access points for health cards and health program application through, for example, public libraries and Access PEI locations.\n\n2.0 How will shared health priorities funding support PEI health system priorities and initiatives?\n\nThe Department of Health and Wellness has prioritized initiatives under the Family Health Teams and Health Workforce and Backlogs areas for the first three years of Shared Health Priorities funding in alignment with the province's upcoming Provincial Health Plan. Access to primary care, ongoing health human resource shortages, recruitment and retention challenges, and health workforce burnout and well-being are critical issues in Prince Edward Island, as they are nationally and globally.\n\nAs well, funding will continue to be invested in the Mental Health and Substance Use Shared Health Priority area through the existing 2017 Common Statement of Principles (2017 CSoP). Ongoing initiatives under the Mental Health and Substance Use priority area are described in this document and align closely with the primary care initiatives under the Family Health Teams priority area. Where possible, future builds of Community Health Centres will collocate primary care and mental health to further advance collaborative mental health in primary care.\n\nInitiatives under the Family Health Teams and Health Workforce and Backlogs areas were deemed highest priority by senior leaders within the PEI healthcare system and decision-makers in the PEI Provincial Government. Public consultations have also identified these as high priority areas to focus investments on in the near-term. Several high-impact initiatives are currently underway under the identified priority areas that will benefit from the Federal funding provided through the Working Together to Improve Health Care for Canadians agreement.\n\nThe Federal funding assigned to initiatives under the Family Health Teams and Health Workforce and Backlogs priority areas builds on the provincial priorities identified in section 1.2. Shared Health Priorities funding will permit the province to accelerate and enhance the implementation of health initiatives for the benefit of PEI residents and healthcare providers. With the support of Federal funding, PEI can ensure that its Patient Medical Homes and Neighbourhoods are implemented sooner and Island- wide to help ease critical primary care access issues.\n\nA summary review of the proposed funding allocation to initiatives under the Shared Health Priorities proceeds here, followed by a high-level description of each initiative.\n\n2.1 3-year Shared Health Priorities and 2017 Common Statement Of Principles financial summary\n\nPrince Edward Island's allocation of Shared Health Priorities funding and 2017 CSoP funding combined is $31.4 million per year ($28.8M Shared Health Priorities funding plus $2.6M 2017 CSoP funding), for a three-year total of $94.2 million.\n\nTable 1 describes PEI's allocation of Shared Health Priorities and 2017 CSoP funding for the 2023-24, 2024-25, and 2025-26 fiscal years among several initiatives. The percentage of funds allocated to specific initiatives are estimates only, based on the understanding that actual amounts are subject to various internal and external factors and may require adjustments over time.\n\nTable 1. Shared Health Priorities 3-year financial summary Priorities and Initiatives Incremental investments Total 2023-24 2024-25 2025-26 Family health teams $18,441,800 $21,459,800 $21,874,800 $61,776,400 Primary Care – patient medical homes $12,861,800 $21,459,800 $21,874,800 $56,196,400 Primary Care – patient medical neighbourhoods Primary Care - primary care access clinics Supporting initiatives and programs for primary care and family health $5,580,000 $0 $0 $5,580,000 Health workforce and backlogs $10,358,200 $7,340,200 $6,925,200 $24,623,600 Recruitment – internationally educated Health professionals recruitment strategy $3,121,500 $4,735,300 $4,735,300 $12,592,100 Recruitment – retaining, recruiting, and recognizing the credentials of health care Workers Reducing backlogs in surgeries and Diagnostics $7,236,700 $2,604,900 $2,189,900 $12,031,500 Mental health and substance use (2017 CSoP) $2,600,000 $2,600,000 $2,600,000 $7,800,000 Mobile mental health $2,600,000 $2,600,000 $2,600,000 $7,800,000 Student well-being teams Grand total – all initiatives $31,400,000 $31,400,000 $31,400,000 $94,200,000\n\nThe initiatives identified for Shared Health Priorities funding align closely with Federal Government priorities and PEI's Provincial Health Plan objectives. The initiatives funded through Shared Health Priorities and 2017 CSoP funding will advance primary care objectives, address critical health human resource challenges and backlogs exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and further PEI's commitment to enhancing services provided to underserved and vulnerable populations. Further information on each of the initiatives identified in Table 1 follows in the next section.\n\n2.2 Family health teams initiatives\n\nShared Health Priorities funding will be allocated to initiatives that help ensure PEI residents have access to timely and effective primary care. The Department and Health PEI, in partnership with other government departments, health care providers, communities, and PEI residents, are implementing a multi-year Primary Care Roadmap to respond to immediate needs and transform the delivery of primary care in the province. The priority actions of this project are the establishment of Patient Medical Homes and Patient Medical Neighbourhoods.\n\nPrimary care – patient medical homes\n\nPatient Medical Homes use a collaborative team-based approach to deliver patient-centred primary care services to PEI residents. Fourteen (14) Primary Medical Homes have been launched since March 2022 and are at various stages of development. The Shared Health Priorities funding allocated to this initiative will enable the establishment of up to 30 Patient Medical Homes across the province, each of which requires significant coordination and integration of capital and IT infrastructure, human resources, and change management processes. Patient Medical Homes established across PEI will enable residents without a family doctor, including many underserved and vulnerable PEI residents, access to primary care near their place of residence, easing pressure on emergency departments and walk-in clinics.\n\nUnaffiliated PEI residents (i.e., any resident without a primary care provider) will be attached to a Patient Medical Home in their region. Patient Medical Homes will extend from tip-to-tip across PEI, providing primary care access to residents across PEI, particularly underserved people in rural areas, including PEI's two Indigenous communities, and recent immigrants and racialized PEI residents who often do not have access to a family physician.\n\nPatient Medical Home teams address the needs of the local community by assessing these needs and offering the appropriate combination of services. Team composition will be tailored depending on the geographic location, population needs, and resources available, and will include physicians, nurse practitioners, dietitians, nurses, chronic disease educators, and other health professionals who work together with patients and their families to address health care needs.\n\nMental health and substance use services are included in the Patient Medical Home model through the inclusion of social workers and mental health therapists in the primary care team, highlighting PEI's commitment to enhancing mental health services across the province.\n\nPatient Medical Homes are a core part of PEI's vision for transforming primary care health services from a current state of siloed practices and providers to a robust, team-based primary care model wherein every PEI resident and every family physician is part of a Patient Medical Home in a Patient Medical Neighbourhood.\n\nPrimary care – patient medical neighbourhoods\n\nPatient Medical Neighbourhoods are a network of providers and services outside, but within accessible distance, of a Patient Medical Home. Each Patient Medical Home coordinates and integrates access to services within the Patient Medical Neighbourhood for the care of patients.\n\nEach Patient Medical Neighbourhood will include a primary care network centred on the Patient Medical Home, with linkages to medical specialists and other community-based healthcare providers, hospitals, long-term care facilities, home care services, pharmacies, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, mental health and addictions supports and services, and community organizations and resources in the area near the central Patient Medical Home. Patient Medical Neighbourhoods are not tied to a physical location like the Patient Medical Home. Therefore, the suite of services within a Patient Medical Neighboorhood may serve multiple Patient Medical Homes. The Patient Medical Home acts as a navigational resource to ensure patients are linked with appropriate complementary providers and services in the community.\n\nThe Department and Health PEI have developed a framework for Patient Medical Neighbourhoods, and have been conducting engagement activities with government, providers, provider associations and colleges, and community partners to plan out the implementation of the first Patient Medical Neighbourhoods. Shared Health Priorities funding will enable the roll-out of the Patient Medical Neighbourhood model across all the Patient Medical Homes established in PEI. Specifically, funds assigned to Patient Medical Neighbourhoods will be used to enhance staffing, implement a PMN resource database for Patient Medical Homes and patients, establish Community Liaison staff in five health regions to help connect patients between services, and leverage technology and innovation opportunities through existing Access PEI and Public Library sites to improve patient access.\n\nPrimary care – primary care access clinics\n\nPrimary Care Access Clinics are a short-term measure to provide primary care services to people without a primary care provider. PEI residents without a primary care provider are currently provided free access to virtual care. When a virtual care visit is deemed not appropriate, patients are referred to an in-person visit at one of two Primary Care Access Clinics in PEI, located in Charlottetown and Summerside.\n\nBetween September 2022 and June 2023, there have been 3,392 patient visits to the Charlottetown Primary Care Access Clinic, and 1,310 to the Summerside Primary Care Access Clinic. Monthly clinic visits have been increasing over time, from 50 in September 2022 to 700 in June 2023. Based on these trends it is expected that visits will continue to increase, necessitating funding for both clinics during 2023-2024 while Patient Medical Homes and Neighbourhoods are being established. Shared Health Priorities funding will ensure staffing is stabilized at the Primary Care Access Clinics with the ability to expand as needed in 2023-2024. It is anticipated that Primary Care Access Clinics will be scaled back in 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 as more Patient Medical Homes are staffed and operating, and no federal funding has been assigned to the initiative in those years.\n\nSupporting initiatives and programs for primary care and family health\n\nRemaining funds will be allocated to other initiatives and programs to support primary care and chronic disease management, the establishment of Patient Medical Homes and Neighbourhoods, and family health through enhanced pharmacy and public health support. Included among these initiatives and programs are:\n\nOverhead supports:\n\nModernized agreements with private primary care clinics to ensure staffing and equipment supports are appropriate for these facilities,\n\nQuality and safety, infection control, mentorship support for new graduate nurses:\n\nEnhance continuity of care and IPAC resources in community care and other health facilities, and\n\nMentor new graduates in primary care, patient medical homes, and other facilities,\n\nPrimary care staffing and pharmacy support:\n\nIn-province physician salaries, pharmacy services including a drug access navigator and community-based pharmacy healthcare services\n\nPublic and family health support through increased dental coverage for seniors and low-income residents:\n\nEnhance continuity of care, access to care, and prevention of future health issues.\n\nOutcomes under the Patient Medical Homes and Neighbourhoods model, and interim transformation services provided through Primary Care Access Clinics, are manifold and impact patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, and population health. Team-based primary care improves the work-life of providers through improved job satisfaction, opportunity to work to full scope of practice, extending scope of practice by learning from other providers, sustainability in workload, and decreased professional isolation. Patient and caregiver experience is improved by offering patients timely access to primary care team members, primary care access closer to home, connection and access to specialty services, integration and coordination of services between providers and communities, and focused attention to other issues that impact health, such as the social determinants of health. Population health is improved by more appropriate utilization of resources, appropriate follow-up after discharge from acute care and transitions in care, and through chronic disease prevention and management programs. Finally, a robust team-based primary care model can enable cost-effective health care through reduced emergency department visits, enhanced coordination and integration of programs and services along the continuum of care, enhanced continuity of care, fewer adverse events, and improved recruitment and retention of healthcare providers.\n\n2.3 Health workforce and backlogs initiatives\n\nPEI, like many other jurisdictions in Canada and globally, is experiencing a critical shortage of healthcare workers and high worker burnout rates. Shared Health Priorities funding will be allocated to various initiatives to recruit and retain healthcare workers to promote an effective and sustainable healthcare system.\n\nInternationally educated health professionals strategic plan\n\nPEI will develop and implement a strategic plan to recruit internationally educated health professionals to the province. This plan will aim to reduce financial, socio-cultural, and professional barriers that inhibit internationally educated health professionals from immigrating to and working within their profession in PEI.\n\nAddressing health human resource issues in PEI and nationally will require strategic and coordinated efforts to recruit trained health care professionals from abroad ethically and fairly, understanding that health care professional shortages are a global phenomenon. PEI supports principles of ethical recruitment of health personnel, considering the rights, obligations and expectations of source countries, destination countries, and migrant health personnel. In the last year, PEI has embarked on health recruitment missions in Dubai, UAE, and London, England, and works closely with the PEI Office of Immigration to fill health care vacancies with skilled international talent.\n\nFunding for this initiative will support a dedicated staffing position to ensure that the province can develop an Internationally Educated Health Professionals Strategic Plan in the first year of funding. Funding in years two and three will ensure strategic plan actions can be implemented to bolster IEHP recruitment and hiring in PEI.\n\nWe need to ensure health services meet the needs of the increasingly diverse population of PEI. Ensuring procedures are in place to reduce barriers to immigration and which permit Internationally Educated Health Professionals to practice more readily in PEI will lead to multiple positive outcomes – not only easing health human resource pressures, but also reducing disparities among the healthcare workforce and meeting the language and cultural needs of patients from different ethnic backgrounds. Initiatives under this heading will include reducing impediments to credential recognition and streamlining hiring processes to get Internationally Educated Health Professionals into the field faster. Investments in the recruitment and retention of Internationally Educated Health Professionals will complement ongoing provincial initiatives to promote diversity and create welcoming work and living environments for women and gender diverse Islanders and aligns well with the Department of Health and Wellness' Health Strategy for Women and Islanders Who Are Gender Diverse 2022-2027.\n\nRetaining, recruiting, and recognizing the credentials of health care workers\n\nShared Health Priorities funding under this initiative will be allocated to Health PEI objectives that bolster recruitment, retention, and recognition of health care workers in PEI. Specific objectives include:\n\nEnhancing human resources through additional:\n\nSupports for employee health, nursing, and labour relations, and\n\nFunding for leadership and talent management.\n\nEnhancing retention of health care staff through:\n\nImproved organizational safety and compliance, and\n\nFunding for scheduling systems, operational supports, and help desk.\n\nEnhancing recruitment of health care staff through:\n\nCreation of a job guarantee program for students studying in health care fields to guarantee full-time positions upon graduation.\n\nPlanning for these initiatives is in the preliminary stages. More information on specific actions will be communicated by the Department of Health and Wellness and Health PEI as details become available.\n\nReducing backlogs in surgeries and diagnostics\n\nShared Health Priorities funding under this initiative will be allocated to Health PEI programs and services that will make headway on surgical and diagnostics backlogs that arose or were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, funding will be directed to increasing hours of operation and human resource support in diagnostic imaging, anesthesiology and radiology, CT technology and ultrasound technology, general surgery, ophthalmology, and laboratory services to increase patient throughput and reduce wait times.\n\n2.4 Mental health and substance use initiatives\n\nThe Department established a new Mental Health and Addictions division in 2021, aiming to improve access to mental health and addictions services for PEI residents by ensuring activities are coordinated across various departments and stakeholders. Considerable work has occurred since the establishment of the division to improve and enhance mental health and addictions services, including implementing actions from the Mental Health and Addictions Strategy and the Suicide Prevention Strategy, establishing the Mobile Mental Health Response Service, and initiating a Mental Health and Addictions capital redevelopment project. Some of the strides that have been made in PEI to improve access to Mental Health and Substance Use programs and resources with Common Statement of Principles funding and provincial funding include:\n\nOpening four new walk-in mental health clinics – three in western PEI and one in eastern PEI – providing coverage across the province,\n\nImplementation of Seniors Mental Health Resource teams in rural areas,\n\nImplementation of Student Well-being teams in families of schools across PEI,\n\nImproved access to gender-confirming surgical procedures and non-surgical treatments for transgender Islanders,\n\nIncreased support for the Strength Program, providing residential and day treatment programming and supports for youth aged 15-24, and their families,\n\nInvestment of $100 million in modernized mental health and addictions facilities and infrastructure,\n\nEngagement with public libraries to provide Mental Health and Gambling Support Kits to help educate individuals and support those seeking self-care,\n\nOngoing Wellness Grants to communities and organizations for wellness initiatives that promote healthy living,\n\nImplementation of an online mental health program to help PEI residents connect to mental health and substance use services,\n\nNew mental health supports for PEI farmers and fishers through the Farmers Talk Program and the Fisher Assistance Program,\n\nImplementation of a new mental health and addictions single point of access phone line,\n\nEstablishment of a new Mental Health and Addictions Research Centre at Health PEI,\n\nImplementation of the Mobile Mental Health Response Service in 2021, providing Island-wide support to individuals who may be experiencing a mental health crisis,\n\nImplementation of the Anti-Racism Microgrants funding initiatives in 2022, providing small grants to organizations and individuals in various fields to create community-led projects, workshops, and training events addressing racism,\n\nDevelopment of Awareness to Action: A Health Strategy for Women and Islanders Who Are Gender Diverse 2022-2027, which describes priority areas and actions to improve the health and well-being, including mental health and mental well-being, of women and gender diverse people at every stage of their lives,\n\nImplementation of a new online mental health support program for public safety partners including firefighters, search and rescue volunteers, paramedics, policy officers, and public safety communicators,\n\nOpening of a new Addictions Extended Care facility to support Island women recovering from substance use,\n\nImplementation of a new day program for acute mental health patients, and\n\nConstruction initiated on a dedicated Mental Health and Addictions Emergency and Short Stay Unit, the first-of-its kind in Atlantic Canada.\n\nExisting 2017 Common Statement of Principles funding earmarked for Mental Health and Substance Use initiatives will continue through the 2023-24, 2024-25, and 2025-26 fiscal years under two key initiatives: Mobile Mental Health and Student Well-being Teams. Funding to these two programs will ensure the Mobile Mental Health Response Service and Student Well-being Teams are appropriately staffed and have access to tools and resources to provide mental health and addictions services close to where people needing the services live and go to school. Mobile Mental Health and Student Well-being teams ensure that PEI residents living in rural areas, within Indigenous communities, and in underserved and vulnerable populations have access to mental health and mental wellness supports when and where needed.\n\nMobile mental health\n\nThe Mobile Mental Health Response Service provides rapid patient assessment and support to people in communities from an integrated team of specialists including healthcare professionals, police services, and emergency medical services. Mobile Mental Health units are coordinated by the Department of Health and Wellness, with operational management through Medavie Health Services – a private company that also operates PEI's emergency medical service, Island EMS.\n\nMobile Mental Health units have the tools and systems in place to ensure that if a situation changes from crisis to emergency, the appropriate supports can be dispatched safely and effectively. Mobile Mental Health units are in place to ensure mental health services are available close to where people live, and to ease pressure on emergency departments and the 911 system for mental health and addictions related issues. Funding through the 2017 CSoP will allow for a permanent staffing complement for Mobile Mental Health units through the next four years of the agreement.\n\nPEI's Mobile Mental Health Response Service has fielded almost 7,000 calls since its inception in October 2021. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of those calls have been mitigated over the phone by trained clinicians, with the remainder mitigated by field teams in the community. Continued funding will ensure this vital service continues to provide 24/7 access to trained mental health clinicians.\n\nStudent well-being teams\n\nStudent well-being teams work in PEI public schools advising, consulting, and providing direct service to children and youth who are struggling with mental, social, and physical health issues. When professionals are in schools, children have timely access to supports to help them succeed in school and throughout life. Reducing barriers like transportation brings services to students to support their well- being.\n\nStudent Well-being Teams are currently staffed and resourced to provide services Island-wide to over 21,000 students in 56 English public schools and 6 French public schools. Funding through the 2017 CSoP will allow for a permanent staffing complement for Student Well-being Teams through the next four years of the agreement.\n\n3.0 Advancement of Indigenous health priorities\n\nThe initiatives supported by Shared Health Priorities funding will have broad impacts that affect all PEI residents. However, the Department of Health and Wellness and Health PEI are committed to working with Indigenous partners across the province to contribute to positive health outcomes for members of the Abegweit First Nation, the Lennox Island First Nation, and other Indigenous organizations in PEI.\n\nThe two Mi'kmaq communities in PEI – Abegweit and Lennox Island – have their own strategic plans and priorities regarding the delivery of healthcare services in and around their communities. While there are many ways in which the strategic health plans of Abegweit and Lennox Island align with each other and with the Shared Health Priorities identified in this 3-year action plan, they are distinct and specific to each community. It will be critical for the Department of Health and Wellness and Health PEI to maintain ongoing, consistent, and meaningful discussions with both communities to determine how Shared Health Priorities initiatives and other provincial programming can better support Indigenous health. The Department of Health and Wellness has committed to establishing an Indigenous health engagement committee to continue ongoing discussions with the Abegweit and Lennox Island First Nations, ensuring PEI's two Mi'kmaq communities have a say in the way health policy is established and implemented in PEI.\n\nThese conversations and discussions have been initiated with Abegweit First Nation and Lennox Island First Nation, and further opportunities for mutually beneficial partnerships and collaboration will be explored during this 3-year action plan and beyond. The Department of Health and Wellness views the establishment of Patient Medical Homes and Patient Medical Neighbourhoods as initiatives that can have a significant impact on primary care access for people living in First Nation.\n\n4.0 Measuring and reporting on initiatives supported by Shared Health Priorities funding in 2023-24 to 2025-26\n\nIn addition to the eight common indicators developed by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) in collaboration with Federal, Provincial, and Territorial governments and other key health data partners, the province has identified nine additional indicators related to the initiatives funded through the Shared Health Priorities funding. These indicators complement but do not overlap with the eight common indicators compiled by CIHI. Tables 2 and 3 outline the provincial and national common indicators, respectively.\n\nTable 2.
