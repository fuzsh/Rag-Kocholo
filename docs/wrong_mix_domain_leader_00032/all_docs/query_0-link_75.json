        "text": "1The 1970s have often been considered in relation to other decades. Andy Beckett, though not necessarily sharing that perception himself, calls the “turbulent” 1970s “a hangover from the 1960s”, whereas others consider them as a decade of downright decline, dominated by the notion of crisis, the final decade of the post-war consensus which was shattered by Margaret Thatcher and the New Right in the 1980s. However, the 1970s were also characterised by a number of experiments, failures but also sometimes achievements, which contributed to shaping late 20th and early 21st century Britain. It is the aim of this article to establish and document to what extent this applies to the questions of immigration and integration.\n\n2Alongside the omnipresent and multifaceted notion of “crisis”, the weight of the post-war consensus was clearly felt throughout much of the decade, although various forces were already at work to undermine it.\n\n3Part one will show that the immigration legislation put in place in the 1970s reflected to a very large extent the state of public opinion since the 1960s at least and was the result of a broad cross-party consensus on the need to control immigration, despite the existence of critical, divisive episodes, such as the Ugandan refugee crisis.\n\n4Part two will turn to state intervention regarding integration and racism. As will be documented, on the one hand the 1970s saw the consolidation and the extension of the Race Relations legislation framework devised in the mid-1960s and on the other hand, the persistence of ordinary racial prejudice and the rise of violent racism.\n\n5Part three, finally, will turn to migrant groups, politics and crises. It will investigate and document the attitude of the main two parties towards immigrants, as well as the specific forms of immigrant mobilisation - whether particularist or not - that took shape in the 1970s, both inside and outside mainstream political parties and unions.\n\nImmigration: consensus and crisis\n\nA Broad Consensus on Immigration Control\n\n4 Edward HEATH, The Course of My Life, London, Hodder and Stoughton, 1998, p. 455.\n\nIt what against that volatile background that as Prime Minister I set about trying to improve the situation […] Between 1968 and 1970, my mailbag had contained many letters, largely from Conservative supporters, in support of Enoch Powell. They were frequently abusive, towards me as much as towards black people, but this only made me more resolute. There were certainly those in the party, even on the front bench, who wanted to harness racist support. Some commentators have argued that I bowed to this pressure and that, as a result, Powell helped me to win the election of 1970 just as he helped Wilson to defeat me in 1974 on the question of Europe. I totally disagree.\n\n9 SANDBROOK, op.cit., p.254.\n\n[…] Reginald Maulding told his colleagues that since assimilation was “all but impossible” for Asians, immigration ought to be limited to people ‘from a cultural background fairly akin to our own’. But Heath’s ministers were by and large, a liberal-minded lot, and certainly more tolerant than the rest of the population. They closed the door to mass immigration not because they were racist reactionaries, but because public opinion – as manifested in one poll after another - demanded it.\n\n10Almost three decades later, Heath presented the 1971 Immigration Act as a moderate piece of legislation and rejected the idea that it might be considered racist:\n\n10 HEATH, op.cit., pp.455-456.\n\nIt is true that we promised to limit immigration in our manifesto, but we did so as part of the balanced approach to the problem […] I could not have made clearer to voters that there would be no Faustian pact with Powell and that racism would get no encouragement of any kind from the Conservative Party, so long as I was its leader.\n\nThe Ugandan Asian refugee crisis and the Tory Right\n\n19 Quoted in PUZZO, op.cit., p.143.\n\nI still think that assistance with repatriation is an important service to make available to those who wish to go back. (...) I accept that the pressure created by it is quite small in relation to other social and economic pressures, which at any given moment tend to cause major flows inwards and outwards.\n\n14The present author tried to obtain information from the Home Office and significantly enough got the following reply:\n\n22 Email, 9 July 2015. Quoted in LATOUR, page number unknown yet.\n\nYour request has been handled as a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 […] I have consulted the areas of the department which would be most likely to hold the information you have requested, however my enquiries have come back negative. Therefore I have concluded that the Home Office does not hold the information which falls within scope of your request […].\n\n16The next point will discuss whether a tacit consensus existed on the question of integration too.\n\nIntegration, racism and state intervention\n\n17Given the nature of post-war immigration, the correlated issue was “race”. In his memoirs, Heath does not dodge the hostility displayed by the majority population, which, in a typically British manner, he attributes to large-scale immigration:\n\n25 Ibid.\n\nWhen I came to power, race was already a major source of conflict in Britain. Labour’s 1948 British Nationality Act had granted British citizenship to all people in Commonwealth countries past and present and it was this that facilitated immigration in the 1950s. The racial prejudice that these immigrants encountered culminated in the Notting Hill race riots of 1958. Continuing inter-racial friction eventually prompted Rab Butler to bring in the Commonwealth Immigration Act in 1962 to limit the numbers of non-white immigrants by means of an employment voucher scheme. Although discriminatory in practice, the principle behind it was to give white Britons time to adjust to new arrivals and, thereby, to give existing immigrants and their descendants more of a chance to integrate.\n\nThe consolidation of Race Relations Legislation\n\n18By 1970, the intervention of the State was already visible in the field of integration. For five years, the country had been endowed with a liberal, modern-day integration policy, thus defined by Roy Jenkins, the then Labour Home Secretary in 1966:\n\n26 Roy JENKINS, speech before the National Committee for Commonwealth Immigrants (NCCI), 1966.\n\nIntegration is perhaps a rather a loose word and I do not regard it as meaning the loss, by immigrants, of their own natural characteristics and culture. I do not think we need in this country a ‘melting pot’, which will turn everyone out in a common mould, as one of a series of carbon copies of someone’s misplaced vision of a stereotyped Englishman […] I define integration, therefore, not as a flattening process of uniformity, but cultural diversity, coupled with equality of opportunity, in an atmosphere of mutual tolerance.\n\n19Although Jenkins’ definition was rather vague, it clearly distinguished integration in Britain from both American and French-style assimilation and it welcomed the expression of cultural differences. That liberal interpretation of integration was accompanied by the completion of the race relations legislation that the Wilson governments had started framing in the mid and late 1960s (1965 and 1968 Race Relations Acts).\n\n20Edward Heath did not question the approach devised by his predecessor. In the debate to the Queen’s speech on 2 July 1970, Heath pledged to ensure:\n\n27 HEATH, op.cit., p.456.\n\n[…] justice to all those who are already in the country, whatever their race, creed or colour may be, to set the public mind at rest on this issue so that there cannot be any further justification for existing passions and so that they can be absolutely no reason for apprehension on the part of immigrants who are already settled here.\n\n14. The review of race relations undertaken in the past year has convinced the Government that if urgent action is necessary, it is even more necessary to devise policies which are coherent rather than spectacular, to set targets which are relevant and realisable rather than dramatic. The gravity of the prospect demands action, but it places a premium on carefully considered action, consistently carried through. Nothing at this juncture could be worse than bold promises without the means of implementation.\n\n30 “White Paper on Racial Discrimination” (PDF of the original document 1975) <http://filestore.nation (...)\n\n15. The Government has a special responsibility as an employer. An unequivocal statement of the Government’s equal opportunity policy has been made to all Departments covering all grades and positions in both the industrial and the non-industrial Civil Service. The policy states, with the full support of staff representatives, that there will be no discrimination against any person eligible under the nationality rules whether in recruitment, training or promotion or in any other way, on the grounds of colour, race, ethnic or national origins.\n\n32 Jack HOWARD-DRAKE, Assistant Secretary, Home Office in Playing the Race Card, BBC 2, 1999 (my trans (...)\n\n[…] [employers] were quite happy to employ coloured people but providing they were not visible. In other words, if they worked in the kitchens, that was alright, but employers felt that shoppers wouldn’t like to see coloured hands handling food over the counter. They thought that ladies wouldn’t be happy to buy their underwear from coloured girls.\n\nThe persistence of “ordinary” racial prejudice and the rise of violent racism\n\n28However the general picture of race relations in 1970s Britain was not so grim. Racial tensions existed in other countries too, in France notably, where North Africans were the primary targets of brutal racist attacks. Thus, between March and July 1971 alone, eight Algerians were killed, in Lyons, mostly. Tensions were particularly obvious in Marseilles too, where seven North Africans were killed in August 1973. Later that year, in the tense context of the Yom Kippur War, a bomb attack targeted the Algerian consulate in Marseilles, killing four people, which prompted President Pompidou to declare that France was “a deeply antiracist country”.\n\nMigrant Groups, Politics and Crises\n\nMainstream Political Parties and immigrants\n\n31After Margaret Thatcher took over as Conservative leader, the Conservative Party moved away from its one nation approach. This applied to immigration and race relations too: the Tories’ anti-immigration and assimilationist stances became increasingly clear. This was of course reinforced by Margaret Thatcher’s rhetoric of invasion, deployed during a TV interview for World In Action (Granada, 1978):\n\n44 Margaret THATCHER, TV Interview for Granada World in Action, 27 January 1978. Transcript available (...)\n\n[…] Let us try and start with a few figures as far as we know them, and I am the first to admit it is not easy to get clear figures from the Home Office about immigration, but there was a committee which looked at it and said that if we went on as we are then by the end of the century there would be four million people of the new Commonwealth or Pakistan here. Now, that is an awful lot and I think it means that people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture and, you know, the British character has done so much for democracy, for law and done so much throughout the world that if there is any fear that it might be swamped people are going to react and be rather hostile to those coming in.\n\nSpecific immigrant mobilisation inside and outside mainstream Political Parties\n\n37Technically, Grunwick may have been a failure but it was the first dispute involving chiefly non-white protagonists that received widespread support from the labour movement, both from within the Labour Party and from alternative or far-left political organisations.\n\nConclusion\n\n38As this article has endeavoured to show, the 1970s saw the gradual weakening of the post-war consensus, amidst a series of various crises, whether political, societal or cultural.\n\n40Regarding integration, despite its comparative failure, the pro-active British approach of the 1970s endeavoured to respond to racial discrimination, both in employment and housing and paved the way for the equal opportunity policies of the 1980s and 1990s. The 1976 Race Relations Act was a unique piece of legislation in Europe when it was introduced. It was well-ahead of its time and provided a framework for fighting racial discrimination and fostering equal opportunity for the next three and half decades, until it was superseded by the 2010 Equality Act.\n\n41Finally, the visible acceleration of migrant community mobilisation in the 1970s, announced the greater visibility and coordination (though not necessarily the greater success) of ethnic minority mobilisation in the 1980s (e.g. Afro-Caribbean cultural and economic demands during the urban riots of the Thatcher era; the rise of Muslim cultural demands), in the context of the shift towards multiculturalist policies in the United Kingdom.\n\n42Therefore, the perception of the 1970s as, essentially, a decade of transition and decline can and should be challenged, at least when it comes to immigration and integration."
