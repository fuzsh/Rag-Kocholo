        "text": "Washington D.C., July 16, 2021 - The United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1980s aspired to improve its nuclear weapons capability to bomb Soviet targets, including major cities, without having to depend on the United States, according to documents obtained and posted today by the National Security Archive. British officials had a variety of motives for seeking advanced modern submarine-launched ballistic missiles, from retaining their status as a nuclear power, to uncertainty about American reliability down the road, to a desire to stay ahead of their continental rivals the French, the records show.\n\nU.S. officials recognized British concerns, but they understood they could reap certain benefits in return for assisting them. Nixon suggested the British could “block for us” in the European Community and his administration as well as Jimmy Carter’s pressed for the “quid” of freer American access to the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, which to this day is a key military outpost.\n\nToday’s posting, based on declassified materials released under the Freedom of Information Act, is the second in a series on the U.S.-U.K. special nuclear relationship, which afforded London access to the advanced technology it needed to stay in the nuclear game. The records delve into internal U.S. deliberations and bilateral communications with the British, providing a more detailed picture of this most significant partnership. Several documents are published here for the first time.\n\nConcern About Future U.S. Reliability Influenced British Quest for Trident Missiles\n\nby William Burr\n\nThe recent British decision to increase their nuclear weapons stockpile—the first U.S. ally to do so in years—may involve deploying more Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) that have been central to the United Kingdom’s strategic forces. What made such an option available is that since the 1960s, the United States has provided the British with advanced nuclear technology, first Polaris SLBMs and later Trident II missiles, that supported their determination to remain a nuclear weapons state. The Trident deployments were the consequence of complex research and development efforts and prolonged U.K.-U.S. negotiations during the 1970s and 1980s, but U.S. leaders were supportive because they saw a British nuclear role as a worthwhile element of military cooperation. Yet, the British worried that they might not always be able to rely on U.S. support in a military crisis seeking a capability to strike Soviet Union targets independently, slipping through Soviet anti-ballistic missile defenses. In a document published for the first time today, one of Henry Kissinger’s aides wrote that the British wanted to be able to “assure … penetration of the Moscow ABM complex in an extreme ‘go it alone scenario’.\n\nThis is the second of two postings on the “special” U.K.-U.S. nuclear relationship that made British SLBM deployments possible. Part I documented the early years of the nuclear ties, including John F. Kennedy’s decision at the 1962 Nassau Conference to provide British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan with Polaris missiles. Part II, today’s posting, documents subsequent developments, beginning with U.S.-British negotiations during the 1970s when the Nixon administration’s inability to offer an acceptable post-Polaris replacement led the British to develop their own reentry vehicle, with U.S. aid. Nothing came without strings attached and the Nixon administration linked U.S. assistance to expanded access to Diego Garcia, British territory in the Indian Ocean. Negotiations during the Carter and Reagan administrations, however, were more successful and the British won access to U.S. MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles) technology, enabling them to pose a more lethal threat to the Soviet Union. Diego Garcia remained an element of linkage with the British in the Trident negotiations, with Washington seeking greater access to the island.\n\nSLBM technology was a major element in the Anglo-American nuclear relationship during the Cold War but so was exchange of sensitive nuclear information and materials, about which far less has been declassified. Also important was that the United Kingdom provided bases for U.S. nuclear weapons and delivery systems, from Thor Missiles to B-47 bombers and U.S. Polaris submarines and more. The British would have a “joint decision” in the use of any British-based U.S. nuclear weapons, as confirmed by the 1958 Murphy-Dean agreement (see Document 5 in Part I of this series.) During the Euromissile Crisis of the early 1980s, a new issue emerged, the control of U.S. nuclear-armed Ground Launched Cruise Missiles (GLCMs) that would be based in the United Kingdom as part of NATO’s decisions on Theater Nuclear Forces. To placate Parliamentary opponents who wanted “dual key” arrangements for the GLCMs, the Margaret Thatcher government updated Murphy-Dean in 1983 so that the “joint decision” language covered decisions to launch cruise missiles in event of war. Documents on these developments, including the 1983 agreement as released by the British, are published for the first time today.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOverview\n\nThe United Kingdom has deployed Vanguard-class submarines with Trident II nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) leased from the United States under arrangements negotiated with the Reagan administration in 1982. This arrangement has a long and complex pre-history stretching back to the Kennedy administration, which agreed to provide Polaris Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) to the United Kingdom so that it had an advanced strategic nuclear weapons capability. By the time of the Nixon administration the British were trying to update Polaris SLBMs so that they could infiltrate Soviet ABM defenses in the event of war. The difficulties of negotiations with Washington, however, led the British to develop their own nuclear reentry vehicle, Super Antelope, which Henry Kissinger characterized as “stupid” because he did not understand the technology. Nevertheless, the “special” nuclear relationship continued, and the U.S. supported Super Antelope, although its shelf-life was uncertain. By the late 1970s, however, the British wanted something better, the Trident missile with MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles) technology that would enable them to aim more warheads accurately at Soviet targets, including Moscow its ABM defenses notwithstanding. And the Carter and Reagan administrations were willing to provide MIRVed systems for British nuclear submarines because of the political and logistical advantages of cooperation.\n\nFor the British, upgrading their nuclear forces was essential to maintain their “credibility” and a capability to use them independently when “supreme national interests are at stake,” which the United States recognized in the communiqué for the December 1962 Nassau Conference. According to a British Cabinet discussion in March 1982, a strategic nuclear force under “British national control” was “essential” because “no one could foresee what might happen over the next 30-40 years to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or to the United States attitude to the defence of Europe.” Moreover, the British did not want France to be the only nuclear-armed power in Western Europe. That the British believed that a nuclear capability was central to remaining an influential power was left unsaid, although Kissinger said it privately to Nixon in 1972: \"they’ll be a nothing-country if they’re not in [the nuclear business].\"\n\nIf the British could not rely on U.S. support during a major crisis with the Soviet Union (or later, Russia), they wanted their own nuclear weapons for a capability to strike Moscow and major urban targets. A public British Defense Ministry document from July 1980 declared that a Trident force was necessary to convince Soviet leaders that, even if the United States held back from a conflict with Moscow, “the British force could still strike a blow so destructive that the penalty for aggression would have proved too high.” The decision to designate Moscow and other major Soviet cities top British targets came to be known as the “Moscow Criterion.” While targeting cities and civilian populations contravenes the Geneva Conventions, the United Kingdom has excluded nuclear weapons from its interpretation of the Conventions’ 1977 Protocol 1.\n\nToday’s posting publishes a variety of declassified U.S. and British records from the 1970s and 1980s documenting the Anglo-American dialogue on post-Polaris strategic submarine systems that eventually led to the 1982 agreement on Trident II. It was a rocky road, however, because what the U.S. was willing to offer in the early 1970s was not what the British believed best suited their interests. While the British expressed interest in acquiring MIRV technology, the Nixon administration was not responsive. It was not until the late 1970s, when the international situation was deteriorating, that the U.S. government became willing to provide MIRVs to London. The declassified record documents these and related issues, including internal British discussions on the need to update the 1958 Murphy-Dean agreement, that would be negotiated by Assistant Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and British Ambassador Oliver Wright.\n\nBackground\n\nAs noted in Part I of this series, the British continue to keep Vanguard-submarines armed with Trident II up and running. Each submarine, of a force of four, can carry 8 SLBMs and 40 warheads, although more would be possible. To support the force, the British have maintained a nuclear warhead stockpile in the range of 225 units (never officially announced). Although Whitehall committed in 2010 to reduce the stockpile to 180 by the mid-2020s, in March 2021 it dropped that commitment when the Boris Johnson government announced that it would instead raise the nuclear stockpile to 260 owing to the uncertain global environment. The detailed numbers, however, have been kept secret.\n\nThe Johnson government’s announcement was a surprise to the international community. It reversed London’s historic policy of supporting reductions in nuclear stockpile numbers, as befitting the U.K.’s role as a sponsor of the NPT, whose Article VI called for progress in nuclear disarmament. For that reason, the implications of the British decision for the next NPT review conference may be damaging. The Biden administration has made no comment on the matter, although it may have been an unwelcome development because it could give ammunition to U.S. supporters of nuclear force expansion while running against President Biden’s inclinations toward cuts. Whether the nuclear issue rose to the agenda of the recent Biden-Johnson conversations has not been disclosed, but no doubt it has been the subject of discussion between U.S. and British officials.[1]\n\nThe idea of an Anglo-American “special relationship” has been invoked for decades to convey the especially close cooperation between London and Washington in a variety of areas, not only diplomatic and intelligence and military but especially in the nuclear realm. Yet Boris Johnson dislikes the idea of a “special relationship” because, to him, it conveys a British dependence on the United States.[2] Dependence, however, is an element of the story; for example, the British nuclear deterrent involves the leasing of U.S. Trident II missiles for the submarine force and the provision of U.S. MIRV technology to better improve the odds of penetrating Soviet ABM forces and striking key urban targets in Russia. In any event, the provision of this technology during the Carter and Reagan administrations involved bargaining, with the British making concessions in other areas so that Washington would find advantages to providing expensive and sensitive technology.\n\nThe British had been interested in MIRV technology, but it was only one of the possibilities they considered after they began thinking about how to upgrade the Polaris system. But when the British expressed an interest in MIRVed Poseidon SLBMs during 1973, the Nixon administration was not forthcoming because it would have required the White House to take the matter to Congress, with which it had difficult relations even before the Watergate scandal developed. Moreover, transferring MIRV technology to the British would have complicated arms control talks with Moscow. Besides the SALT complications, Kissinger believed that it would be “bad” if the British got MIRVs because it would put them far ahead of the French, thus complicating U.S.-French relations. Thus, the U.S. was only willing to offer the reentry vehicles geared for the new Poseidon SLBM but not in their MIRVed form. Yet, “de-MIRVed” Poseidon was an unproven technology that could have been expensive to develop.\n\nThe British opted to pursue R&D for the less expensive home-grown Super Antelope reentry vehicle (latter renamed Chevaline), which would be used to improve Polaris and so enable it to penetrate Soviet ABM defenses around Moscow. With the British having just joined the European Community (EC), this was a safer choice because it would avoid debates over the “special relationship” while allowing possible nuclear collaboration with France. In any event, the U.S. continued the close nuclear relationship by agreeing to assist the British with Super Antelope, including helping to test nuclear devices at the Nevada Test Site.\n\nLater in the 1970s, during the Carter administration, circumstances for transferring the MIRV to the British became more propitious. With U.S.-Soviet relations becoming more difficult, Carter was receptive to the initial proposal made informally by British Prime Minister James Callaghan in early 1979. Reaching agreement on the timing of an announcement, however, was difficult in part because of SALT concerns, but also the need to finalize a NATO agreement on Theater Nuclear Forces (TNF). SALT II proved less of an obstacle because it did not exclude the transfer of delivery systems technology to countries that had previously received it. Moreover, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 postponed any possibility for ratifying SALT while improving the atmosphere for a decision to provide the British with Trident I, a MIRVed system. The Reagan administration took a step further by offering the British the even more powerful Trident II, which ensured that they were not stuck with an eventually obsolete Trident I, which the United States would eventually abandon.\n\nBoth the Carter and the Reagan administrations were strongly committed to the Anglo-American relationship, more for hardheaded than sentimental reasons. According to historian Suzanne Doyle, both U.S. presidents viewed the special relationship in “transactional terms”: they sought to link various foreign and military policy desiderata to the agreements to supply the MIRVed Trident. For example, Jimmy Carter’s Pentagon wanted the British to open further U.S. access to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, a military base, for contingencies in the Middle East and South Asia, while the Reagan administration required the British to slow down their departure from Belize for the sake of stability in the region. Yet, the U.S. wanted the British to get a good price so they would have more resources for conventional forces, which was to the U.S.’s advantage.\n\nCompared to the Nixon years, the internal U.S. record of the decision-making on Trident during the Carter and Reagan administrations is relatively scanty. This is owing mainly to the slowness of underfunded declassification processes at presidential libraries and the National Archives generally. Moreover, with changes in the preservation arrangements for the State Department’s central files during the 1970s, the kind of rich internal record that would show up in those files earlier in the decade is not at all matched by the material consigned to the P-reels later in the decade. Why that is the case is unclear, but perhaps less material was going into the central files compared with the records of offices and bureaus.\n\nFor the negotiations on the Trident C-4 and D-5 archival pickings are slim, especially with Presidential Libraries operating under pandemic restrictions. The Carter Library has declassified a few items, with enough available digitally to provide a general sense of the process. Under pandemic conditions, only a few items are presently available from the Reagan Library, although enough to give a perspective on U.S. thinking. Major files from there require further exploration to determine what has been released and what needs to be requested. On the British side, there is a substantial body of declassified material at their National Archives, including the web site of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation. That those records are available is a result of the British twenty-year rule, which ensures that important material (if not everything) on military policy, among other issues, becomes available for research.\n\nEditor’s note: Thanks to Matthew Jones, London School of Economics for helpful comments on this posting and for sharing documents.
