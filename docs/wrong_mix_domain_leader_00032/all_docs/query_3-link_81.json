I bought the Charge 3 and I hate taking it off. I love the notifications it sends if I havenât moved from my desk each hour, I love the fact you can challenge other friends and colleagues to weekend, or weekly challenges as well as track your own performance. Itâs got me more motivated than any exercise book, or personal trainer. The only downside I find is that itâs not 100% accurate. My resting heart rate on an ECG machine compared to my Fitbit has a difference of 10 beats per minute...thatâs a big number when youâre trying to work in fat burn mode or/and cardio. In addition, when I train with other people my steps are pretty much the same but when we e all walked a 12km walk (as weâve done consistently this week), my Fitbit comes up with almost 2km less than the others! The only time itâs accurate is if I walk with my GPS on my phone and then sync the data after my walk/run. In addition the calorie counter has very limited good options and scanning them and sending them off is too time consuming. I find Iâm using the âMy Fitnesspalâ app to monitor my food intake...please look at their app and try and make the Fitbit calorie counter more user friendly. Apologies for mentioning the bits that need âtweakingâ, but itâs constructive feedback that I feel is important. All in all I am so chuffed that I have a Fitbit as its now become a way of life for me! Thank you to the Fitbit team of developers âºï¸\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHi Jane,\n\nWe're delighted to hear that you enjoy using your Fitbit Charge 3 and love its features such as reminders to move and challenges!\n\nAs for your concern with heart rate tracking, please note that our Fitbit devices calculate steps differently from other machines. PurePulse LEDs (light-emitting diodes) on your Fitbit device reflect onto the skin to detect blood volume changes, and finely-tuned algorithms are applied to measure heart rate automatically and continuously. The heart-rate icon you see on the display tells you if you're in 1 of 3 heart-rate zones.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if you're doing an activity where your wrist is moving vigorously and non-rhythmically, the movement may prevent the sensor from finding your heart rate. If this happens, try relaxing your wrist and staying still briefly (about 10 seconds), after which you should see an accurate heart rate reading. For more on what impacts heart rate accuracy, please see: http://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1565#ImpactsAccuracy.\n\nHope you'll also like the other features your watch has to offer!\n\nBest,\n\nFitbit Support"
