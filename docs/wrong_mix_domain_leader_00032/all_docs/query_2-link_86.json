        "text": "Dr. Carroll also had the foresight to found the department’s Comprehensive Tissue Core. Over 6,000 volunteers have donated bladder, renal and prostate tissue specimens for preserved storage. Dr. Carroll and investigators currently use this resource to determine how biomarkers change over time, what activates them, and what modifiable factors might affect these changes. We have found this tissue core to be increasingly valuable resource as constantly developing advanced research technologies permit new vantages for research.\n\nPeter R. Carroll\n\nDr. Peter Carroll received his undergraduate training at the University of California, Berkeley. He attended Georgetown University School of Medicine, and during his training, earned the Cahill Award for outstanding performance in surgery, and, the Kober Award for highest record of academic performance. He graduated from Georgetown with honors.\n\nHe then came to UCSF for his general surgery training and urology residency. During this time, he earned numerous resident clinical and research awards. He went on to complete a fellowship in Urologic Oncology at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center before returning to join the faculty in the Department of Urology at UCSF in 1986.\n\nThroughout his years at UCSF, Dr. Carroll’s contributions to both his department and to the UCSF campus community, are noted for leadership, vision, and a tenacious commitment to clinical care, education, and research at the highest levels. He holds the Ken and Donna Derr-Chevron Distinguished Professorship. He has served as surgeon-in-chief of the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center from 2003 through April of 2007. In September 2006, Dr. Carroll became the Director of Strategic Planning and Clinical Services of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Associate Dean, School of Medicine. In May 2008, Dr. Carroll earned a Master’s in Public Health degree from UC Berkeley. He was awarded the 2010 Eugene Fuller Triennial Prostate Award and the Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO) Medal from the AUA and SUO, respectively.\n\nDr. Carroll has authored or co-authored over 6500 publications. He is an active member of numerous professional medical societies, including the Alpha Omega Honor Medical Society, the American College of Surgeons, and the American Association of Genitourinary Surgeons. He is now Past President of the American Board of Urology (2006-2008). He is currently principal or co-investigator on numerous scientific studies funded by the NIH.\n\nHis major professional interests are the study and management of urologic cancers, Including identifying clinical and pathologic determinants of prostate cancer recurrence, progression, and mortality; discovering novel biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnostics and prognostics; developing evidence-based guidelines for improved management of prostate cancer patients; and examining the impact of lifestyle on health-related quality of life and survivorship among men with prostate cancer. Other interests include innovative methods of urinary tract reconstruction, health services research, health policy and the impact of cancer detection and treatment on quality of life.\n\nToday’s UCSF Urology Training Program\n\nDr. Carroll has amassed a dedicated team of prominent bench scientists and brought them together with world-class clinical investigators, all of whom share a passionate commitment to translationalresearch. Under Carroll’s leadership, faculty members lead research programs in endourology, laparoscopy and urinary stone disease, male infertility and reproduction, neurourology, male erectile dysfunction, pediatric urology, trauma and reconstructive surgery, tissue regeneration, urology outcomes, incontinence, and urologic oncology.\n\nCurrently, the department has over 42 faculty members. Faculty are renowned leaders in the field for several urologic domains: urologic oncology, prostate cancer active surveillance, laparoscopic and robotic surgery, pediatric urology and hypospadias, trauma and reconstruction, erectile dysfunction and penile physiology, Peyronie’s disease, andrology, female urology, stone disease and surgery, and laparoscopic reconstructive urology.\n\nSeveral current faculty today are supported by NIH mentored clinical and basic research K-awards. Several current members of the department have obtained a Masters in Clinical Research (MAS) degree from UCSF’s prestigious Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, and others are active in the UCSF Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute and the latter’s K-scholars program, which provides a organized forum for junior-faculty with K-awards to collaborate, provide peer review, and receive mentorship to advance their academic careers and compete for NIH funding. In 2012, the department ranked among the top recipients of National Institutes of Health research funding for academic urology programs in the U.S.\n\nResidency Training. Three residents enter our six-year program each year. Our residents are culturally and gender diverse. For the last several years, one to two thirds of our incoming resident trainees are women. Until 2011, the first two years of the urology residency program were spent completing general surgery training. As of 2011, residents complete 1 year of general surgery, followed by five years of urology (four years clinical, and 1 year dedicated to research) beginning in the R2 year. Our residents rotate among three main institutions: University of California San Francisco Hospitals (Moffitt Long Hospital and Mt. Zion Comprehensive Cancer Center), San Francisco General Hospital, and the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center.\n\nUnder Dr. Carroll’s leadership, our training program’s resident rotations have been re-structured to provide our residents with more a more extended and in-depth exposure to the various subspecialties of urology represented by our faculty. We provide dedicated rotations in the subspecialties of urologic oncology, pediatric urology, urinary stone disease, female urology, erectile dysfunction and sexual medicine, reconstructive urology, male infertility, and neurourology. Our residents today begin training with the DaVinci robot beginning in the R2 year. The fifth year of the residency program continues to be dedicated to research training. Residents may spend the year in a UCSF laboratory performing basic research, or, may focus on clinical and clinical outcomes research. All residents may also complement their research training with clinical research, public health, health policy, and/or epidemiology/biostatistics coursework.\n\nThe UCSF Urology Residency training program has over many years hosted many leaders in urology as our annual John Walter Schulte Visiting Professor (Table 2). In addition to training over 240 urologic residents, The UCSF program has trained and supervised more than 174 clinical fellows. This group of scholars includes many from foreign countries: alumni represent over 25 countries, mostly in Europe, South America, Canada and the Far East. Not shown on the table provided are the hundreds of research scholars who have completed research fellowships at UCSF. The research achievements and quality work of these individuals represents a significant contribution to our department’s achievements.\n\nDuring the near century since its’ founding, and under the successive leadership of Drs. Hinman, Smith, Tanagho, and Carroll, the UCSF Department of Urology has contributed immensely to the urologic literature. Our Chairs and Faculty have always been dedicated to creating an academic environment that encourages a mastery of the foundations of urology, original thought, a humanistic spirit towards medicine and urology, and involvement in research. Over the decades, the Chairs who have led the Department have provided every possible means of support for its members to enhance the productivity of faculty, residents, and fellows. Evidence of this high quality has been reflected in the fact that every junior faculty member has become recognized nationally within a few years of completing training. As Dr. Maurice Garcia, a recent graduate of the residency program and current faculty member reminisces, “From the moment I entered the department as a junior resident, I was struck by how Dr. Carroll consistently, throughout my years of training, promotes, not only an un-flagging pursuit of achievement and distinction among my peers, but also self-development, an open-mind to new research directions, and a fulfilling personal life outside of medicine. For as long as I can remember, outside of his office window, there is a poster called “Peter’s Laws: The creed of the sociopathic obsessive compulsive” While waiting outside of his office to meet with him (usually in the early evening), I was able to read, and eventually nearly memorize all 19 “laws”. The two that most remind me of him and the example he set for us all are #11 (‘Perfection is not optional’), and #17:(‘Patience is a virtue, but persistence to the point of success is a blessing’).”\n\nThe result of the department’s productivity is clearly seen in the number of national and international awards the Department has won (see Table 4) and in its contribution to the annual meeting of the Western Section of the AUA. Over the years the UCSF program, while representing only 1 of 14 universities within the Western Section, has contributed close to 20% of the scientific program. It has also won more than its share of the competitive awards offered (Table 5). While the accolades and awards of the department’s basic research faculty and their labs are not enumerated here, their immense contribution to the productivity of the department is acknowledged with pride and gratitude.\n\n(Listed in alphabetical order)\n\nLaurence S.
