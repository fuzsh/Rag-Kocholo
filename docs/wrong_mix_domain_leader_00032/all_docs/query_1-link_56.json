        "text": "Heath History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe name Heath has a long Anglo-Saxon heritage. The name comes from when a family lived on a heath, which is an area of level, uncultivated land with poor, coarse, undrained soil and rich deposits of peat or peaty humus. The surname Heath belongs to the class of topographic surnames, which were given to people who resided near physical features such as hills, streams, churches, or types of trees.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Heath family\n\nThe surname Heath was first found in Durham where it was first listed as Atte-Hethe, Apud Hethe and Del la Hethe in the Rotuli Hundredorum of 1279. 1 The name was denoted for someone who lived on or by a heath, typically filled with heather. 2 Kirby's Quest for Somerset listed Adam atte Hethe and John atte Hethe during the reign of Edward III. 3\n\nLater in the Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379, Robert del Heth was listed. Thomas Atte-Hethe was rector of Ringstead Parva, Norfolk in 1376 and Ralph atte Heythe was rector of Rockland Tofts, Norfolk in 1398. 4\n\nRobert Heete or Robert of Woodstock (d. 1428), was an early \"canonist and civilian, presumably a native of Woodstock, Oxfordshire, became scholar of Winchester College in 1401, and in due course scholar of New College, Oxford, where he graduated M.A. and LL.B. \" 5\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Heath family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Heath research.

By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 18\n\nHeath Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. Robert Heath, aged 30 who arrived in St. Kitts (St Christopher) aboard the ship \"Amity\" in 1635 11\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Heath (post 1700) +\n\nBenjamin Heath (1704-1766), English classical scholar and bibliophile\n\nThomas Heath (1719-1773), English scientific and mathematical instrument maker\n\nSir Thomas Little Heath (1861-1940), British civil servant, mathematician, classical scholar, historian of ancient Greek mathematics, translator, and mountaineer\n\nJames Edward \"Jimmy\" Heath (1926-2020), nicknamed Little Bird, an American jazz saxophonist, composer, arranger and big band leader\n\nAir Marshall Sir Maurice Heath (1909-1998), former Chief of Staff Allied Air Forces, Central Europe\n\nRowena Dolores Heath (1926-2023), also known as Dodie Heath and sometimes as Dody Heath, an American actress of stage, film, and television\n\nMr. Scott Heath B.E.M., British recipient of the British Empire Medal on 8th June 2018, for services to LGBT community 19\n\nMrs. Lorraine Margaret Heath O.B.E.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Espere mieux\n\nMotto Translation: Hope for better.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Heath +\n\nHarrington-Heath Heritage: Ancestors and Descendants (1600-1984) of Oramel Warren Harrington and Martha C.
