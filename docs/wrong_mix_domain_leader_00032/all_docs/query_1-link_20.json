        "text": "The former Conservative premier Sir Edward Heath yesterday warmed up for his 80th birthday celebration today in characteristically candid style by giving yet another interview in which he criticised his government and his party.\n\nEurope? The pro-Europeans kept quiet out of loyalty to John Major, he told Radio 4’s World at One. “We may have been wrong, but it was out of loyalty that we did it. It may be the time has come when we have all got to shout out.”\n\nHong Kong? It was “regrettable” that we were now at loggerheads with China, after he had begun the original discussions on a smooth hand-over with Chou En-Lai in 1974. “I think mistakes have been made.”\n\nAnd so on, via the new Tory slogan, New Labour, New Danger, a throwback to the 60s and 70s up with which young voters will not put, predicted the pre-war organ scholar at Oxford whose impoverished student travels took him within a few feet of Hitler. Next time he went back it was in uniform.\n\nThe standard response of the Thatcherite right to Sir Edward’s curmudgeonly behaviour is to denounce the former prime minister (1970-74) for boorish bad manners, for being the “worst prime minister since the war” and for conducting “the longest sulk in history” since Margaret Thatcher’s leadership coup in 1975. There is a rare hatred in much of the abuse.\n\nIn fact Sir Edward’s misconduct has been mild compared with hers towards a successor who was at least her protégé. He never plotted, he never pushed the party towards a potentially fatal split, and always appealed - not always wisely - towards a more generous, internationalist spirit.\n\nBut the public Heath has never been easily lovable and all those efforts to humanise a very private man, as musician, yachtsman, even as Father of the Commons, have never quite worked. He can be famously rude, but also warm, witty in a dry way. A generous host, his stories begin disconcertingly: “So I said to Mao …” or “De Gaulle told me …”\n\nOverawed by Thatcher, history has given him scant credit as a meritocrat and moderniser, neither socialist nor monetarist, whose middle way looks more attractive to assorted liberals, leftists (Arthur Scargill became a fan) and moderate Tories than it did at the time.\n\nThe Grocer - Private Eye’s 1960s joke survives - has mellowed in old age, wisely stayed in the Commons where the action still is while other elder statesmen - that woman among them - retired to the Lords. His speeches get better. He is even writing those long-promised memoirs. He plans to call them The Last Word."
