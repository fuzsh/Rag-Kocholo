        "text": "Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of very small solid particles and liquid droplets made up of many different chemicals, including elemental carbon, organic compounds, metals, sulphates, and nitrates. These particles are small enough to remain suspended in the atmosphere for an appreciable period of time. PM is emitted directly from sources (primary PM, e.g., black carbon or soot) or formed in the atmosphere from precursor compounds that undergo chemical reactions (secondary PM). Both primary PM and secondary PM precursors have a large variety of natural and anthropogenic sources, such as wildfires, motor vehicle exhaust, and coal combustion. The health effects of PM are directly associated with the size of the particles, as smaller particles penetrate deeper into the lungs. PM2.5 is of significant concern for human health, has been extensively researched and reviewed, and is causally associated with the greatest range of health effects of any of the major (or “criteria”) air pollutants.\n\nRisk assessments published by Health Canada (2013) and the US EPA (2019) have evaluated the weight of evidence of health effects from short-term and long-term exposure to PM2.5, and their conclusions are summarized here. Evidence indicates that short-term exposure (hours to days) to ambient PM2.5 increases the risk of premature death, including all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. In addition, short-term exposure increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular and respiratory effects, including aggravation of pre-existing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), changes in cardiac and lung function, increased respiratory symptoms, and deterioration in indicators of cardiovascular health. Short-term exposure also results in increased medical interventions. For example, population-based studies show that increases in short-term PM2.5 exposure are associated with increases in emergency room visits and hospital admissions relating to respiratory and cardiovascular conditions.\n\nOverall, the evidence indicates that long-term exposure (months to years) to ambient PM2.5 increases the risk of non-accidental and cardiovascular mortality, and it may also be associated with respiratory mortality. As well, long-term PM2.5 exposure increases the risk of adverse respiratory effects, including increased respiratory symptoms and effects on lung development in children, as well as cardiovascular effects, such as health parameters relating to atherosclerosis progression. Chronic exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk of lung cancer, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified outdoor PM as carcinogenic in humans (IARC, 2016).\n\nIn addition to the extensive evidence examining respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes of PM2.5, there is emerging evidence that long-term exposure to PM2.5 may be associated with adverse effects on the nervous system, including dementia (Fu et al., 2019). Exposure to PM2.5 has also been increasingly associated with other health effects, including metabolic diseases such as diabetes (Chen et al., 2013a) and pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight (Stieb et al., 2016; Lavigne et al., 2019).\n\nPM can affect climate through direct interactions with radiation, predominantly through scattering or absorption of incoming solar radiation (sunlight). Sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, and secondary organic aerosol particulates predominantly scatter incoming solar radiation, some of which is reflected back into space; therefore, these PM species have a net cooling effect on climate (Boucher et al., 2013). Conversely, PM species that absorb incoming solar radiation, such as black carbon and certain types of organic particulates referred to as brown carbon, have a net warming effect (Bond et al., 2013). The presence of clouds influences these effects (Chand et al., 2009), and, under clear skies, so does the nature of the Earth’s underlying surface. PM over highly reflective surfaces such as snow has a stronger net warming effect than over less reflective surfaces because of the relatively larger fraction of incoming solar radiation that would have been reflected back to space without the presence of PM (Haywood & Shine, 1995). In addition, the mix of compounds within individual aerosol particles can also affect the direct radiative effects of PM. For example, absorption of solar radiation by black carbon is enhanced when PM is coated by more weakly absorbing compounds, such as sulphates (Jacobson, 2001; Liu et al., 2017).\n\nPM can also affect climate through its effects on clouds, due to its role as the “seeds” upon which water may condense in either liquid or solid form — acting as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei, respectively. Aside from the mass of particles in the atmosphere, there is also strong evidence that the number of particles influences cloud formation, with increased atmospheric particle number concentrations (total number of particles per unit volume of air) resulting in liquid water clouds with a larger number concentration of smaller cloud droplets, making the clouds more reflective and producing a cooling effect on climate (Boucher et al., 2013). However, PM–cloud interactions are subject to a large number of feedback processes that can locally modify the magnitude and direction of the radiative effects of these interactions, notably through changing precipitation production, which may alter the lifetime or spatial extent of the cloud, and changes involving ice particles in clouds (Fan et al., 2016). For these reasons, the effects of PM on clouds and climate are still uncertain (Seinfeld et al., 2016).\n\nThe Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed the global net radiative forcing from anthropogenic PM, including through both direct radiative effects and aerosol–cloud interactions, at −0.90 (5% to 95% confidence interval [CI] −1.9 to −0.1) W/m2 (i.e., a net cooling effect). This likely offsets a significant fraction of the estimated +2.83 (5% to 95% CI +2.54 to +3.12) W/m2 radiative forcing due to the change in concentration of the well-mixed GHGs (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and halocarbons) between 1750 and 2011. However, the net forcing from PM combines significant positive forcing (warming) from black carbon emitted from fossil fuel and biofuel use, and negative forcing (cooling) from sulphates, nitrates, and primary and secondary organic aerosols. The net forcing from PM mentioned above does not include additional positive forcing from black carbon deposited on snow, estimated at +0.04 W/m2, which has a two to four times larger impact on surface temperatures than CO2 per unit radiative forcing (Myhre et al., 2013; Skiles et al., 2018).\n\nDue to the short atmospheric lifetime (approximately 1 week) and highly variable spatial distribution of PM, impacts on radiation can be much larger on regional scales than the global average estimates given above. The chemical composition of PM influences the pathway and fate of incoming solar radiation as it travels through the atmosphere. Both PM that strongly scatters and PM that strongly absorbs incoming radiation reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. However, only the latter will warm the atmospheric layer where it occurs. These effects could have significant impacts on surface temperatures and rainfall by reducing the amount of energy absorbed at the surface and, in the case of absorbing PM, heating the atmosphere aloft (Ramanathan et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2012). Modelling studies have shown that, due to the response of the global wind and weather patterns, the effects of SLCFs on climate are not limited to the regions where the emissions occur and may be even larger in regions well removed from the emission sources (Shindell et al., 2015; Kasoar et al., 2016).\n\nChanges in climate can have significant effects on air quality. Studies show a strong correlation between temperature and ground-level ozone (Camalier et al., 2007). This relationship results from various factors: direct temperature effects on chemical reactions that produce ozone; increases in biogenic emissions of ozone precursors (e.g., VOC emissions from vegetation) with temperature; and the correlation of higher temperatures with meteorological conditions that are conducive to the production of ozone (Steiner et al., 2006; Schnell & Prather, 2017). While tropospheric ozone in industrial regions in some seasons is expected to increase with increasing temperatures, climate change alone is expected to result in a decrease in the global background concentration of ozone, as increases in water vapour reduce levels of ozone through increased photochemical destruction in remote locations (Wu et al., 2008a; Stevenson et al., 2013).\n\nThe direct impacts of increased temperature on PM vary by season. Warmer temperatures in winter will result in a larger fraction of certain PM components remaining in the gas phase, resulting in lower PM concentrations. However, warmer temperatures in summer will favour the increased production of sulphates and higher PM concentrations (Dawson et al., 2007). Observations across the United States suggest additional contributions to PM concentrations result from other temperature-related factors (Tai et al., 2010). In particular, increased emissions of VOCs from biogenic sources, such as trees, with increasing temperature have been shown to have a strong impact on the formation of organic components of PM (Day & Pandis, 2011)\n\nClimate change includes many complex changes beyond increasing temperature. By more rapidly warming the Arctic, climate change may lead to a greater persistence of hot and dry conditions associated with slow-moving high-pressure systems (Coumou et al., 2018). Summertime episodes of poor air quality over Southeastern Canada and the Northeastern United States are frequently associated with these large, slow-moving high-pressure systems and are brought to an end by the passage of a mid-latitude cyclone and associated cold front. Less frequent summertime mid-latitude cyclones have been observed in the recent past, negatively affecting air quality (Leibensperger et al., 2008), and less frequent mid-latitude cyclone passage has been projected under future climate scenarios in several studies (Mickley et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2008b). However, the magnitude of these specific effects on future changes in air pollution is uncertain. Tai et al. (2012) found that the changes in the frequency of mid-latitude cyclone passage had only a small impact on PM, while Horton et al. (2014), from an analysis of 15 different climate models, found relatively small increases in stagnation events, which may lead to higher pollutant concentrations for 2080 to 2099 along the west coast of North America, Northeastern United States, and Southeastern Canada.\n\nA large number of studies have used regional-scale air quality models, combined with future climate projections, to estimate future changes in tropospheric ozone and PM across North America. It should be noted that projections of future air quality depend on model projections of changes in the physical climate, and these changes are more uncertain at regional (sub-continental and smaller) scales for a variety of reasons (Deser et al., 2012; Mearns et al., 2013; Giorgi & Gutowski, 2015). Future air quality will also be affected by changes in air pollutant and precursor emissions. Many studies estimate the effects of climate change alone by making future projections using constant, present-day emissions of air pollutants. The impact of climate change alone on air quality, discussed in this section, is frequently referred to as “the climate penalty” (Wu et al., 2008b).\n\nWhile differences in modelling assumptions and scenarios make detailed comparisons difficult, some general conclusions can be drawn. Available studies generally find that, relative to current conditions, climate change will cause small increases across large parts of North America of 2 to 3 parts per billion by volume in the daytime average ozone concentration during the summer (June to August) by the middle of the century (Hogrefe et al., 2004; Nolte et al., 2008; Lam et al., 2011; Kelly et al., 2012). Isolated increases of about 5 parts per billion by volume were also found across different modelling studies. The largest increases were projected over industrialized regions, such as the Northeastern United States and adjacent regions of Southeastern Canada. These studies have also found some evidence for a larger impact of climate change on days with the highest ozone concentrations (Hogrefe et al., 2004; Nolte et al., 2008) and indications that climate change may lengthen the ozone season (Nolte et al., 2008; Trail et al., 2014).\n\nEstimates of the impact of climate change alone on PM are more uncertain, as there are fewer studies, and the physical and chemical processes affecting PM are more complex and more sensitive to changes in physical climate variables that climate models represent poorly, such as the frequency of precipitation. Tagaris et al. (2007) found decreases of 10% to 20% (1 to 2 μg/m3) in PM2.5 over central and southeastern parts of the United States by about 2050, due to higher precipitation, although only three summers were simulated. Conversely, Kelly et al. (2012) simulated 10 summers leading to 2050 and found the effects of climate change alone resulted in increases in summer PM2.5 of 0.5 to 1.0 μg/m3 over much of the Eastern United States, extending into Southwestern Ontario. Increases of 0.3 to 0.5 μg/m3 were projected over the broader region of Southern Ontario and Southern Quebec. The increases in PM2.5 resulted from the net effect of increases in sulphates and secondary organic aerosols and decreases in nitrates. These changes can be contrasted with those found by Trail et al. (2014), who projected decreases in summer PM2.5 of 1 to 2 μg/m3 for periods around 2050 across most of the Central United States to the Great Lakes, due to increased dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere because of projected changes in wind speed and precipitation. These results demonstrate the level of uncertainty in our current understanding of certain aspects of changes in physical climate and associated air quality projections, as represented by existing models. For changes in annual average PM2.5, the available studies suggest very small changes in regional average values (Tagaris et al., 2007; Lam et al., 2011; Trail et al., 2014).\n\nTwo important caveats to the preceding discussion are worth noting. First, ozone and PM precursor emissions have been reduced significantly over the recent past in the United States and Canada because of emissions controls put in place to reduce the environmental and human health impacts of air pollution (Amann et al., 2013; Stieb et al., 2015; Fann et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Air pollutant emissions are projected to decrease further over the coming decades as a result of air quality regulations, and available projections show significant net improvements in air quality can be realized in the future, accounting for the combined effects of anticipated reductions in air pollutant emissions and the negative impact of climate change (Tagaris et al., 2007; Nolte et al., 2008; Lam et al., 2011; Kelly et al., 2012; Pfister et al., 2014; Trail et al., 2014; Yahya et al., 2017). However, additional reductions in air pollution emissions would be required to counteract the effect of the climate penalty. Second, future ozone concentrations in North America will be affected by changes in the global concentration of methane (Yahya et al., 2017). Increases in the concentrations of methane result in a higher global background concentration of ozone (Stevenson et al., 2013), which affects ozone concentrations in North America, as regional-scale episodes of high ozone build on top of the global background.\n\nAnother impact of climate change on air quality is the expected increase in the length and severity of the wildfire season (Flannigan et al., 2013). Estimates of the effects of climate change on wildfire emissions of black and organic carbon aerosols suggest increases of 80% to 150% by 2050 (compared to 1997 to 2001) over the Western United States (Yue et al., 2013), with an increase in summer average PM2.5 concentrations of 20% to 60% (Val Martin et al., 2015). These projections were based on increases in the average annual area burned each year of between 25% and nearly 170%, which are comparable to estimates of the increase in area burned by mid-century for Canada (Boulanger et al., 2014). Note that the Val Martin et al. (2015) study did not include any increase in wildfires in the Eastern United States because any climate change effect was found to be negligible, while projections of wildfires in Canada show increases from coast to coast (Boulanger et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017). For more information on the impact of climate change on wildfires in Canada and the associated health impacts, see section 5.6 Climate Change and Air Pollution from Wildfires.\n\nStudies have investigated how a changing climate could influence future population health impacts of air pollution. Researchers have assessed these health impacts both regionally and globally, under various climate projection scenarios, including the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) published by the IPCC, and for multiple future time periods. Most studies have examined the influence of climate change on ozone, and some have also addressed PM2.5. Both premature mortality and morbidity outcomes have been considered. In the studies reviewed here, the authors estimated the incremental air pollution health impacts in the future due to climate change alone (i.e., the impact of a warming climate on air pollution concentrations), keeping other factors constant.\n\nMore recent studies have used the RCPs described in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (2014) and other publications (van Vuuren et al., 2011; van Vuuren & Carter, 2014) to model future climate change projections. The RCPs, identified as RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 (referring to different levels of radiative forcing in watts per square metre), represent global climate policy scenarios ranging from more stringent (RCP2.6) to less stringent (RCP8.5) in terms of GHG reductions and concentration trajectories. The RCPs also include projected policies to control air pollution. The more stringent RCP scenarios are also associated with lower air pollutant emissions globally and in Canada, given that many changes in sector activities to reduce GHG emissions (e.g., transition to cleaner energy sources) would also reduce air pollution emissions. The four RCP scenarios project average global temperature increases for 2081 to 2100 (relative to 1986 to 2005) of 1.0°C, 1.8°C, 2.2°C, and 3.7°C, respectively. The RCPs are more in-depth explorations of the impacts of potential mitigation strategies on GHG emissions and are an extension and further development of the GHG emissions-based SRES projections used in previous IPCC assessment reports (IPCC, 2014).\n\nThere are no recent published analyses from Canada using the RCP scenarios, but findings have been published for the United States and for global analyses. In a national analysis, Fann et al. (2015) estimated that summer average eight-hour daily maximum ozone concentrations would increase by about 1 to 5 ppb for parts of the United States in the near future (2030) due to climate change, under RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios. This analysis compared air quality impacts under the 2030 climate, as projected by the RCPs, with air quality impacts under climatic conditions in 2000. The ozone-related health outcomes in 2030 are presented in Table 5.1. The ranges in the projections reflect estimates of the health effects of ozone from multiple epidemiological studies. Overall, health impacts and the associated societal costs under RCP8.5 are projected to be an order of magnitude higher than under RCP6.0.\n\nMuch lower US health impacts for the year 2050 (less than 100 ozone-related premature deaths) were reported in a separate analysis of the climate penalty under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Stowell et al., 2017).\n\nClimate change impacts on both ozone and PM2.5 health effects under the RCP8.5 scenario have also been assessed globally, with estimates of 43,600 and 215,000 excess deaths annually by 2100 due to ozone and PM2.5 increases, respectively, including almost 10,000 deaths in North America. Global impacts in the near term (2030) were estimated to be almost 60,000 excess deaths annually for the two pollutants combined (Silva et al., 2017). Multiple models show an increase in PM2.5 health risks due to the climate penalty in nine of the 10 regions of the world, including North America (Park et al., 2020).\n\nSeveral investigators have applied the older SRES A1B scenario, which is roughly comparable to RCP6.0 and estimates a global temperature increase of 1.59°C in 2050, to project the air pollution health impacts of climate change. These studies estimate hundreds of ozone-related and several thousand PM2.5-related deaths annually in 2050 in the United States due to the warming climate, along with thousands of hospital visits, bronchitis incidents, and asthma attacks (Selin et al., 2009; Tagaris et al., 2009). Higher estimates of ozone and PM2.5-related deaths attributable to climate change were reported for the year 2090, with 13,000 deaths in North America and more than 100,000 deaths globally (Fang et al., 2013). A study of 50 United States cities under the SRES A2 scenario in the 2050s, which predicts a rise in average summer temperature for the Eastern United States of 1.6°C to 3.2°C, projected an increase in mortality (0.11% to 0.27%) and hospital admissions for asthma (2.1%) and COPD (0.2% to 1.6%) due to ozone increases under the future climate (Bell et al., 2007).\n\nA Canadian analysis estimated the air pollution health impacts for a hypothetical increase of 4°C in ambient temperatures for 2002, with anthropogenic air pollution emissions held at 2002 levels (Séguin, 2008). Nationally, increases in summer ozone concentrations due to the higher temperature were associated with 156 excess premature deaths and a total economic value of $750 million due to mortality and morbidity outcomes. This increased to 658 premature deaths ($3.2 billion) when increases in biogenic emissions, expected under a warmer climate, were also included. However, the same study projected, with considerable uncertainty, a net reduction in PM2.5 concentrations under the warmer climate, so that the net effect of the two pollutants under a 4°C increase was estimated to be an excess of approximately 300 premature deaths and a social cost of $1.4 billion.\n\nOverall, these studies show that climate change is expected to worsen air quality and cause considerable deaths and illnesses related to air pollution, with hundreds to thousands of excess annual deaths in North America over this century and 100,000 annual excess deaths estimated globally by 2100. Studies that examined both ozone and PM2.5 generally estimated that effects of climate change on PM2.5-related health outcomes are about an order of magnitude higher than those associated with ozone.\n\nMitigation measures to reduce GHGs and SLCFs help stabilize the climate by reducing pollutants that play a role in increasing global temperature and accelerating climate change. However, climate change mitigation strategies can also have a range of indirect health co-benefits (Markandya et al., 2018). Key among these are health co-benefits from reductions in air pollution because of the following: climate mitigation will limit the climate penalty; some climate pollutants (e.g., black carbon, ozone) contribute to air pollution either directly or as precursors; and changes in industrial and transportation activities to reduce long-lived GHG and/or SLCF emissions can also reduce co-emitted conventional air pollutants (Smith et al., 2014). For example, the widespread use of electric vehicles powered by low-carbon energy can be a strategy for GHG mitigation that could also result in improved air quality. Consequently, climate change mitigation measures represent an opportunity to integrate objectives to stabilize the climate with those to reduce air pollution health impacts, which may offset the costs of implementing the measures (Thompson et al., 2016).\n\nStudies examining air pollution health co-benefits associated with GHG mitigation strategies typically compare a policy scenario that includes strong GHG mitigation and accompanying reductions in air pollutant emissions with a scenario with limited GHG mitigation and associated higher air pollutant emissions. Economic valuation of air pollution health co-benefits allows co-benefits to be incorporated into a broader climate change framework, and the cost-effectiveness and potential optimization of various GHG mitigation measures, which can impose an economic burden on society, can be examined. Studies report monetized health co-benefits as total dollar value or as the marginal benefit per tonne of CO2 equivalent that is reduced. Both PM2.5– and ozone-related health co-benefits have been evaluated in the studies reviewed below, unless otherwise stated.\n\nIn a global analysis of GHG mitigation measures associated with RCP4.5, it was estimated that Canadian air pollution health co-benefits would range from about 4500 to 6500 avoided premature deaths annually between 2030 and 2100, relative to the reference scenario associated with the RCP projections (West et al., 2013) (Table 5.2). US co-benefits were estimated to be about an order of magnitude higher (West et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017). Globally, changes in emissions were estimated to avoid 0.5 million, 1.3 million, and 2.2 million deaths from combined exposure to ozone and PM2.5 in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. The global average monetized marginal health co-benefits were estimated to be $50 to $380 per tonne of CO2 (tCO2) (in 2005 USD), which exceed the marginal GHG abatement costs in 2030 and 2050 in this analysis, and partially offset the costs in 2100 (West et al., 2013). For the United States, the marginal value of avoided ozone- and PM2.5-related deaths was estimated to be $45 to $137/tCO2 (in 2005 USD) (Zhang et al., 2017).\n\nOther studies have evaluated the avoided air pollution deaths associated with climate mitigation pathways based on specific targets for increases in global mean surface temperature in the future compared to a reference scenario. The US air pollution heath co-benefits of reducing the climate penalty were estimated for two climate mitigation scenarios, reflecting a 2.5°C and 2.0°C increase in global mean surface temperature (Saari et al., 2019). The two mitigation scenarios reduced the combined ozone and PM2.5 health impacts by thousands and tens of thousands of deaths in 2050 and 2100, respectively, with 40% greater PM2.5 benefits by 2100, under the more stringent policy compared to the less stringent policy. In 2100, air pollution (ozone and PM2.5) risks associated with climate change were attenuated by 70% to 88% in the policy scenarios. Similarly, US health co-benefits of limiting global warming in 2100 to a 1.5°C rise was estimated to result in 11,000 and 52,000 avoided premature deaths across the United States in 2050 and 2100, respectively, compared to a reference scenario with a 6°C increase in global mean surface temperature. These health co-benefits were valued at 150 billion USD and 1.3 trillion USD (in 2005 USD), respectively, which were equivalent to a rate of $25 (95% CI $9–$42) per tonne of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) and $122 (95% CI $45–$207)/tCO2e, respectively (Garcia-Menendez et al., 2015).\n\nIn a global analysis, Vandyck et al. (2018) examined the air quality implications in 2100 of two GHG mitigation scenarios, the first based on GHG emission reductions implied by the Nationally Determined Contributions, leading to a 2.5°C to 3.2°C rise in global mean temperature by 2100, and the second a 2°C rise by 2100. Globally, avoided deaths due to air pollution in 2050 were estimated at 0.3 to 0.5 million for the Nationally Determined Contributions scenario and 0.7 to 1.5 million for the 2°C scenario, including about 20,000 to 25,000 avoided deaths in the United States. The timing of taking action can affect the magnitude of the accrued health co-benefits. For example, it was estimated that about 150 million deaths due to air pollution globally could be avoided over this century if carbon emission reductions to limit warming to 2°C are implemented sooner rather than later in the 21st century (Shindell et al., 2018).\n\nAnother global study specifically examined the potential air pollution health co-benefits of meeting the Paris Agreement temperature change targets of 1.5°C and 2°C, and compared them to the associated mitigation costs of the climate policy scenarios (Markandya et al., 2018). Globally, the economic value of the health co-benefits were estimated to outweigh the mitigation costs for all scenarios examined, with the ratio of health co-benefits to climate change mitigation costs ranging from 1.4 to 2.45. The greatest potential health co-benefits were observed for China and India, but significant co-benefits were also estimated for the European Union and the United States. Overall, climate change mitigation measures to meet the targets established in the Paris Agreement can be cost-effective under the modelled scenarios and, depending on geographical regions, when air quality associated health co-benefits are considered.\n\nOther studies have estimated thousands of avoided deaths due to ozone for North America and hundreds of thousands globally under various climate change mitigation scenarios, including those targeting methane (West et al., 2007; West et al., 2012). The latter were valued at $13 to $17/tCO2e (2005 USD) in 2030, which outweighed the costs of measures to reduce methane emissions (West et al., 2012).\n\nSome studies have examined the co-benefits of climate change mitigation strategies targeting specific SLCFs or emission sectors. The annual health co-benefits of full electrification of the vehicle fleet in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (Canada) were estimated at 260 and 330 avoided deaths, based on electricity derived from natural gas or from renewables, respectively (Gai et al., 2020). The North American health co-benefits of ambitious clean energy and clean transportation scenarios in the United States were estimated at 175,000 and 120,000 avoided deaths due to air pollution, for the 2015 to 2030 period, respectively, with additional annual benefits thereafter (Shindell et al., 2016). The majority of benefits were from PM2.5 reductions, with a smaller fraction from ozone reductions, and 3% to 4% of all benefits (thousands of avoided deaths for 2015 to 2030 period) were estimated for Canada. Near-term US benefits of the policies were valued at 250 billion USD (95% CI 140 billion to 1.05 trillion USD) annually.\n\nA global analysis of strategies to reduce methane and black carbon reported that implementation of the measures would avoid 0.7 to 4.7 million deaths per year globally, with the largest impact attributable to black carbon reductions, and a marginal benefit of 700 to 5000 USD per tonne of methane reduction (Shindell et al., 2012). Carbon policies for the United States addressing clean electricity production, on-road transportation, and an economy-wide cap-and-trade system were estimated to have air pollution health co-benefits associated with PM2.5 and ozone reductions that would offset approximately 26% to 1050% of GHG mitigation costs (Thompson et al., 2014). The marginal health co-benefits of PM2.5 reductions under the cap-and-trade scenario were estimated at $6/tCO2, which exceeded the implementation costs, and at $8/tCO2 (in 2005 USD) under the clean energy scenario, which partially offset the implementation costs (Saari et al., 2015). Marginal health co-benefits of $148/tCO2 (in 2006 USD) compared to GHG mitigation costs of $126/tCO2 under a clean energy scenario, and marginal health co-benefits of $80/tCO2 compared to costs of $15/tCO2 under the cap-and-trade scenario were reported for a subnational carbon policy in the Northeastern United States. It was noted that costs varied widely due to regional differences in energy consumption (Thompson et al., 2016).\n\nIt is important to consider all aspects of emission changes when evaluating the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation strategies. The US air pollution health co-benefits associated with electric vehicle (EV) adoption were found to vary, depending on the source mix of electricity generation (Peters et al., 2020). It was estimated that 25% of EV use powered by the current US electricity grid mix would result in 437 (95% CI 295 to 578) avoided premature deaths due to PM2.5 and 98 (95% CI 33 to 162) due to ozone reductions annually, with a total value of about 16.8 billion USD. The health co-benefits were estimated to be about twice as high for the same EV adoption rate if the fraction of emission-free energy sources in the grid mix was doubled, although the associated reduction in CO2 emissions would only increase by about 10%.\n\nOverall, studies of the potential air pollution health co-benefits associated with climate mitigation scenarios targeting maximum increases in global mean temperature of about 1.5°C to 3°C consistently indicate that substantial health benefits would be realized. Annually, the burden of disease would be reduced by up to tens of thousands of premature deaths related to PM2.5 and ozone in the United States in 2050 and 2100, and by up to 1 million to 2 million premature deaths globally. When directly compared in a study, more stringent mitigation policies confer greater co-benefits, and there is evidence that larger co-benefits will be realized if policies are implemented sooner rather than later. Air pollution health co-benefits represent a significant public health gain for individual countries and globally, and the socio-economic value can contribute to or even offset the costs of mitigation. Moreover, the joint consideration of climate change and air pollution mitigation options provides a framework to optimize the overall public health benefits and to identify potential unintended consequences, such as inadvertent risks to health. This was made evident following the promotion of diesel-fuelled vehicles in some countries because of their lower GHG emissions, which resulted in elevated emissions of air pollutants (Cames & Helmers, 2013; Haines, 2017).\n\nHealth Canada undertook an analysis of the potential air pollution health impacts in Canada due to the climate penalty and the potential health co-benefits of a specific GHG mitigation pathway for the purposes of this assessment report. In a previous study, scientists at Environment and Climate Change Canada modelled mid-century air quality in North America to examine the influence of both a warming climate and GHG emission controls (Kelly et al., 2012). Air quality estimates were made using a unified regional air-quality modelling system (AURAMS), specifically, a comprehensive Canadian system. Specifically, air pollution concentrations were modelled for the June to August period under the current climate (based on meteorological data from 1997 to 2006) and under a future climate in 2041 to 2050 (based on meteorological conditions in SRES A2). Air pollutant emissions, which were derived from the 2002 Canadian emissions inventory, were held constant between the two scenarios in order to examine the impact of changing climatic conditions alone. Biogenic emissions and the effect of temperature on those emissions were included, but wildfire emission changes associated with climate change were not addressed. In addition, the study estimated air pollutant concentrations under the same 2041 to 2050 future climate, with a 2050 emissions inventory informed by RCP6.0 (a moderate GHG mitigation scenario), which was used to scale North American air pollutant emissions from 2002 to 2050 levels (Kelly et al., 2012). RCP6.0 was chosen in part due to the high level of detail available in its accompanying emissions activity changes, allowing a more precise calculation of the air pollutant reductions associated with the GHG-emitting activity reductions. This scaling reflects both air pollutant emission reductions associated with GHG mitigation as well as assumed air pollution controls. Air pollutant concentrations for each scenario were estimated on a national grid at 45 km resolution, and effects on both ozone and PM2.5 were considered. As noted in section 5.4 Interactions Between Climate Change and Outdoor Air Pollution, effects of a changing climate on PM2.5 are more complex and less well studied than effects on ozone. Therefore, projections of changes in PM2.5 are more uncertain.\n\nFor the current analysis, the air quality output from the three scenarios modelled by Kelly et al. (2012) was used as input for Health Canada’s Air Quality Benefits Assessment Tool (AQBAT 3.0). AQBAT is a national model used to estimate the human health (mortality and morbidity outcomes) and welfare benefits or damages associated with incremental changes in ambient concentrations of air pollutants, including PM2.5 and ozone, in Canada (Health Canada, 2019). AQBAT includes concentration-response functions (CRFs), which characterize the increase in per capita risk of a given adverse health outcome per unit increase in ambient air pollutant concentration, based on published scientific studies. AQBAT estimates health impacts by combining the following parameters: the baseline risk of the adverse outcome in the population, population counts, CRFs, and the change in air pollutant concentrations between the scenarios. In addition, AQBAT provides economic valuation estimates for the health outcomes; these consider the potential social welfare consequences of the health outcomes, including medical costs, reduced workplace productivity, pain and suffering, and the effects of increased mortality risk.\n\nThe air pollutant concentration estimates from these three scenarios were used to answer the following questions.\n\nWhat would the incremental air pollution health impacts in Canada be in 2050 due to:\n\na changing climate, if air pollution precursor emissions remain unchanged (i.e., the climate penalty)?\n\nreductions in air pollution precursor emissions associated with the RCP6.0 projection, under future climate conditions?\n\na changing climate and reductions in air pollution emissions associated with the RCP6.0 projection, compared to recent climatic conditions and emissions?\n\nThe Canadian population health impacts calculated for 2050 (June to August) and the associated economic valuation estimates are presented in Tables 5.3 and 5.4.\n\nOverall, the scientific evidence shows that climate change will affect atmospheric processes and, consequently, air quality. Multiple studies estimate that hundreds to thousands of ozone-related deaths may result annually in the United States during this century as a result of a warming climate. Fewer studies have examined PM2.5 health impacts, but those that have suggest that PM2.5 health impacts will be about one order of magnitude larger than those from ozone (Tagaris et al., 2009; Fang et al., 2013; Silva et al., 2017). Only one study was identified that included an analysis of health impacts in Canada. This focused only on ozone health impacts and estimated that the climate penalty under SRES A1B would result in 45 excess annual deaths in Canada in 2050 (Selin et al., 2009). In a new analysis for Canada conducted for this national assessment report, the net summer season health impacts in 2050 due to the climate penalty are estimated to be 850 excess deaths due to air pollution (total value of impacts $2.7 billion), with approximately 70% of those due to ozone and the remainder to PM2.5, and with the vast majority of health impacts occurring in Ontario and Quebec. Note that this analysis did not include the air quality and health impacts resulting from wildfire smoke, which is discussed later in this chapter.\n\nStrategies to mitigate GHG emissions can result in significant air pollution health co-benefits, the societal value of which can, in turn, offset the costs of GHG mitigation measures. Again, studies in the scientific literature generally estimate the PM2.5 co-benefits to be about an order of magnitude larger than those from ozone reductions. The new Canadian analysis, presented above, estimates net benefits of following the RCP6.0 pathway to be about 5200 avoided deaths for the summer season for a single year in 2050, mainly in Ontario and Quebec, with a total value of benefits of $17 billion. Air pollution co-benefits are anticipated for each year following GHG emission reductions, and the cumulative benefits over decades would be expected to be much larger.\n\nAir pollution health co-benefits of climate change mitigation represent important potential near-term gains and are realized locally, where mitigation measures are implemented. The incorporation of health co-benefits into a climate change framework can provide justification for more stringent or accelerated climate change mitigation measures or incentives to implement actions on climate change (Shindell et al., 2018). Appropriate analyses could allow for the strategic selection of climate mitigation pathways in Canada that also optimally target reductions in population health impacts due to air pollution, given the health and economic burden these represent to society. It would also allow for identification of potential unintended adverse health consequences.\n\nOn average, 7000 wildfires burn about 2.5 million hectares — about half the size of Nova Scotia — every year in Canada. The area burned by wildfire in Canada has doubled since the early 1970s, and this has been attributed to human-caused climate change (Gillett et al., 2004). For example, human influences on the climate were found to be an important contributor to the severity of the 2017 wildfire season in Canada (Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019). The increase in area burned results in higher air pollution emissions from wildfires, as well as greater associated health risks to humans (Reisen et al., 2015; Matz et al., 2020). The four factors that influence wildfire emissions include area burned, fuel consumed, combustion completeness (efficiency), and emission factor, which is the amount of pollutant released, measured in grams per kilogram.\n\nThe Canadian climate is warming, and this is having profound and immediate impacts on fire activity in Canada. The reasons for increasing wildfire activity due to rising temperatures are threefold. First, warmer temperatures extend the fire season, and a longer fire season has already been observed in parts of Canada. For example, interior British Columbia, Alberta, and Northern Ontario have longer fire seasons today than in 1959 to 2000 (Albert-Green et al., 2013; Hanes et al., 2019). Second, warmer conditions result in increased lightning, and, all things being equal, more lightning will result in more fire (Romps et al., 2014). Third, warmer temperatures lead to drier fuels, unless there is a significant increase in precipitation (Flannigan et al., 2016). Almost all future climate change scenarios for Canada do not have sufficient increases in precipitation to compensate for the drying effect from warmer temperatures. Drier fuels make it is easier for fire to start, spread, and burn more intensely, which, in turn, makes the fires more difficult to control or to extinguish and results in greater air pollution emissions.\n\nWildfire activity varies temporally and spatially. For the period 1959 to 2015, the number of large fires and area burned by wildfire increased in Western Canada (Hanes et al., 2019). This trend is expected to continue, with the largest increase in wildfires and smoke projected for Western Canada through to 2050. Increasing fire activity is anticipated across all of Canada in the last half of this century (Flannigan et al., 2005; Flannigan et al., 2009).\n\nScientists are investigating whether recent increases in wildfires in Canada are a direct result of climate change. The observed increases in large wildfires are consistent with what is anticipated with climate change (Flannigan et al., 2009; Hanes et al., 2019). Recent research suggests that extreme fire risk in Western Canada during the last decade increased by 1.5 to 6 times due to human-caused climate change (Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2017). Tan et al. (2019) suggested that extreme spring fire weather in Western Canada in 2016 was very likely an outcome of human-caused climate warming, which increased the occurrence of a weather pattern associated with warmer and drier conditions. Kirchmeier-Young et al. (2019) suggested that human-caused climate change increases the area burned by a factor of seven to 11 times during extreme fire seasons, such as the 2017 fire season in British Columbia.\n\nAmiro et al. (2009) suggested a doubling of wildfire emissions in Canada by the end of this century using the Canadian Global Circulation Model. The increases were largely due to increases in area burned rather than increases in the fuel burned per unit of area (known as depth of burn). Recent research, using three global circulation models (HadGEM2, CanESM2, and CSIRO-MK3.6.0) and three RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5), however, suggested that the proportion of days in the fire seasons with the potential for significant fuel consumption (depth of burn) by wildfire will increase across Canada’s forests, more than doubling for British Columbia and the rest of the boreal forest by 2100 (Wotton et al., 2017). The doubling of fuel consumption due to depth of burn only may occur as early as the 2030s in British Columbia. Wotton et al. (2017) suggested that the proportion of days with high-intensity wildfires that are difficult to impossible to extinguish will increase by two to three times for British Columbia and the boreal forest by 2100.\n\nSmoke from wildfires can travel long distances and significantly affect communities that can be 1000 km or more from the fire. As a result, large population centres are not immune to the adverse health impacts from wildfire smoke, although they may be in an area with low wildfire risk (Matz et al., 2020). In addition, Indigenous communities, which may be in close proximity to forests, may be more affected by wildfires and the need for and effects of evacuation (see Chapter 2: Climate Change and Indigenous Peoples’ Health in Canada).\n\nGiven projected increases in wildfire activity, the potential for interactions between society and fire in Canada (such as more evacuations of communities) will increase. Overall, Canadians need to be prepared for a future with more wildfires and increased levels of wildfire air pollution due to the changing climate.\n\nWildfire emissions contain many different air pollutants, including PM, CO, NOX, methane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and VOCs, and contribute to the formation of ozone and secondary PM (Naeher et al., 2007). The health effects of some of these air pollutants are discussed in section 5.3 Health Effects of Outdoor Air Pollution. For each wildfire, the exact composition of the smoke is highly variable and determined by many factors, including type of vegetation burning (e.g., wet or green vegetation versus dead or dry vegetation), type of combustion (e.g., flaming versus smoldering conditions), and weather conditions (Adetona et al., 2016; Black et al., 2017).\n\nThe health effects of wildfire smoke are an active area of research and have been well reviewed, as they are an important global issue (Benmarhnia et al., 2013; Youssouf et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Adetona et al., 2016; Reid et al., 2016; Black et al., 2017; Cascio, 2018). These reviews considered studies conducted around the world, including in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The methods used to assess exposure to wildfire smoke varied across the individual studies and included use of land-based PM monitors, satellite imagery, air quality modelling, comparison of fire versus non-fire periods, and self-reports. Based on these reviews, epidemiological studies have identified that exposure to wildfire smoke is associated with an increase in all-cause mortality; however, more studies are required to identify which specific causes of mortality are most affected. In addition, the literature indicates a strong association between exposure to wildfire smoke and respiratory morbidity, specifically exacerbations of asthma and COPD, and increased respiratory infections. Numerous studies have reported significant increases in health care utilization, including hospital admissions, emergency room visits, physician visits, and/or medication use, for these respiratory conditions associated with an increase in wildfire smoke. For cardiovascular morbidity, including health outcomes such as myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and heart rhythm disturbances, the association with wildfire smoke remains inconclusive, due to a small number of studies indicating an effect and many studies reporting null findings. Many studies reported no association with cardiovascular diseases as a group, and the results are inconsistent among the studies evaluating specific outcomes. A small number of studies have evaluated other health effects, including birth outcomes, mental health, and diabetes, although further research is required to assess the impact of wildfire smoke on these and other health effects.\n\nStudies conducted in Canada on the health effects of wildfire smoke exposure support the conclusions of the reviews discussed above. Specifically, these studies have identified increased asthma-related physician visits (Henderson et al., 2011; McLean et al., 2015; Dodd et al., 2018a), asthma medication dispensed (Henderson et al., 2011; Elliot et al., 2013; McLean et al., 2015), and respiratory-related physician visits and hospital admissions (Henderson et al., 2011; Dodd et al., 2018a) associated with exposure to wildfire smoke. However, no associations were observed for cardiovascular-related physician visits or hospital admissions (Henderson et al., 2011; Dodd et al., 2018a).\n\nHow wildfire smoke causes health effects is not fully understood, although the evidence suggests the mechanisms may be similar to those identified for ambient PM. Studies in humans and animals exposed to wildfire or wood smoke have suggested that the health effects result from increased oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, as well as possible interaction of particulates with the autonomic nervous system and a possible reduction in immune responses (Adetona et al., 2016; Reid et al., 2016; Black et al., 2017; Cascio, 2018).\n\nHealth impact analyses have estimated the health burden of wildfires attributable to the increase in air pollutant concentrations from wildfire smoke. On a global scale for 1997 to 2006, the average annual mortality attributable to PM2.5 from landscape fire smoke was estimated at 339,000 deaths (interquartile range 260,000 to 600,000) (Johnston et al., 2012). For this study, landscape fires included forest, grass, and peat fires, and were associated with an estimated annual wildfire-PM2.5 exposure concentration of 0 to 45 µg/m3 and a population weighted average concentration of 2.1 µg/m3. The greatest impacts were noted for sub-Saharan Africa (157,000 premature deaths) and Southeast Asia (110,000 premature deaths). The importance of climatic variability on wildfire activities was also evident from the sensitivity analysis of strong La Niña and El Niño years. During the El Niño period, associated with dry conditions and greater fire activity, the estimated annual global mortality attributable to PM2.5 from landscape fire smoke was estimated at 532,000, compared to an estimate of 262,000 for the La Niña period.\n\nIn a national assessment for the continental United States, wildfire episodes in 2008 to 2012 were associated with an annual population-weighted mean wildfire-PM2.5 exposure of 0.6 to 1.1 µg/m3, depending on the wildfire activity of a given year (Fann et al., 2018). These annual wildfire-PM2.5 exposures were associated with an estimated 1500 to 2500 premature deaths from short-term exposure; 8700 to 32,000 premature deaths from long-term exposure; 3900 to 8500 respiratory hospital admissions; and 1700 to 2800 cardiovascular hospital admissions. The economic valuation over the five-year period was 63 billion USD (in 2010 USD) for the short-term premature deaths and combined hospital admissions. The long-term premature deaths had a valuation of 450 billion USD (in 2010 USD) across the five-year period. There was considerable regional variation in wildfire smoke exposure and attributable health impacts, with greater wildfire activity occurring in the western and southeastern states.\n\nThere is only limited information quantifying the health and associated monetary impacts from wildfire-related air pollution in Canada in the published literature. A 2001 fire in Chisholm, Alberta, was used as a case study to estimate the acute health impacts associated with short-term increases in PM2.5 (Rittmaster et al., 2006; Rittmaster et al., 2008). This seven-day fire burned approximately 116,000 ha and had significant impacts on the air quality of Edmonton (160 km south of Chisholm), Red Deer (125 km south of Edmonton), and the surrounding area. Health damage associated with PM2.5 concentrations above the Canada Wide Standard of 30 µg/m3, which was applicable at the time, were estimated to be $2 million to $3 million (in 1996 CAD).\n\nAs discussed in the section 5.6.1 Wildfires in Canada in a Changing Climate, wildfire activity in Canada is expected to increase under a warming climate. Currently, there is too much uncertainty to predict with sufficient accuracy where in Canada wildfires will occur by mid-century and hence to estimate the population health impacts of wildfires under potential future climates. However, it is informative to assess the current air pollution health impacts from wildfires to better understand the magnitude of this population health issue. Health Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada undertook an analysis of the Canadian air quality and human health impacts of air pollution from wildfires in recent years, the results of which are presented in this section (Matz et al., 2020).\n\nAlthough intermittent in nature, wildfire smoke is recognized as a major contributor to air quality issues in North America. To provide forecast guidance for air quality alerts that could reduce air pollution exposure and protect human health during a wildfire smoke event, Environment and Climate Change Canada developed FireWork, a comprehensive operational air quality forecast system based on near-real-time biomass-burning emissions data. This system delivers operational forecasts of modelled air pollutant concentrations from biomass burning, in particular PM2.5, on a daily basis over North America (Pavlovic et al., 2016).\n\nA multi-year retrospective analysis of FireWork wildfire-PM2.5 forecasts was conducted to estimate Canadian population exposure to PM2.5 from wildfires (Munoz-Alpizar et al., 2017). Emissions from wildfires across North America were included in the modelling, which was limited to a five-month period from May to September, for calendar years 2013 to 2018. Due to substantial changes to the modelling grid used for 2016, there is a high level of uncertainty in the model output. As such, the results for that year were excluded from further analysis.\n\nComparisons of average monthly forecasted surface PM2.5 concentrations due to wildfires for the 2013 to 2018 period showed large year-to-year variations in both the timing and the spatial locations of impacts (see Figure 5.2). Additionally, wildfires can sometimes affect the same location many times during a single season. The frequent presence of wildfire-PM2.5, especially in Western North America, has implications for regional achievement of PM2.5 air quality standards. The percent of Canadian landmass with wildfire-PM2.5 and the percent of the Canadian population affected by wildfire-PM2.5 above specified concentrations are provided in Figure 5.3. For 2013 to 2017, more than 60% of the landmass of Canada had average (May to September) wildfire-PM2.5 concentrations of 0.2 µg/m3 or more, affecting more than 90% of the population and demonstrating the widespread nature of wildfire smoke. Additionally, for 2013 to 2018, approximately 25% to 40% of the land mass of Canada had average wildfire-PM2.5 concentrations of 1 µg/m3 or more, affecting approximately 20% to 30% of the population. At the higher-threshold concentration levels, the percentages of landmass and population affected were further reduced. Since the population of Canada is not evenly distributed over the large landmass, the proximity of fire activity to population centres is a key determinant of the population affected by higher wildfire-PM2.5 levels. For example, in 2017, the wildfire activity and smoke plume affected large population centres in British Columbia, and the proportion of the population affected was greater than the proportion of the landmass. Data for the provinces and territories with wildfire-PM2.5 concentrations of 1 µg/m3 or more, affecting more than 5% of the landmass and more than 5% of the population, for 2013 to 2018, are presented in Figure 5.4. In multiple years between 2013 and 2018, about 60% to 100% of the landmass and over 80% of the population in the four Western provinces and the Northwest Territories experienced average (May to September) wildfire-PM2.5 concentrations of at least 1 µg/m3.\n\nThe usefulness of the AQHI as a tool for adaptation depends on the ability to anticipate air quality conditions. Environment and Climate Change Canada forecasts the AQHI across the country (Government of Canada, 2019a), accompanying weather forecasts in all regions except Quebec, which is the only province or territory that has not adopted the AQHI. As part of its Info-Smog Program, Quebec has an air quality index that calculates a subindex for each pollutant relative to a provincial air quality standard (Government of Canada, 2019b).\n\nHealth messages and health protection advice communicated through the AQHI distinguish between the general population and the populations that may experience increased risk (Table 5.8). People with heart and lung conditions are described as most affected by air pollution, while other populations at higher risk include those with diabetes, young children, seniors, and people who are active outdoors. Advice to reduce exposure is primarily directed at avoiding elevated exposure to air pollution by changing schedules and relocating activities (e.g., indoors or outdoors and away from traffic), while, at the same time, encouraging appropriate exercise activities. Individuals are encouraged to check the AQHI forecast and become familiar with how their health may be affected at different AQHI values (e.g., recognizing when they experience symptoms). Those who may be at increased risk are encouraged to monitor their symptoms and limit outdoor activities at higher AQHI values. In addition to the information accompanying the AQHI forecasts, some provinces, municipalities, and media outlets post AQHI guides and information on webpages and provide adaptation advice to the public. The Air Health Check awareness campaign, which ran from 2015 to 2019, disseminated additional information on factors that increase vulnerability, symptoms, and protective actions (Scout Environmental, 2019).\n\nBilateral arrangements between federal and local authorities govern local air quality alerts, also called advisories, warnings, and special air quality statements. Air quality alerts may be based upon a forecast AQHI of seven or above (high risk), or when a specific pollutant exceeds a concentration chosen by the province. The health protection messages for advisories are generally consistent with the AQHI messaging for high or very high risk. However, they may be more detailed, including advice to avoid traffic, stay inside where there is central air conditioning, have an adequate supply of medication on hand, and reduce generation of air pollutants indoors, along with messages advising personal actions to reduce pollution, such as limiting vehicle use and outdoor combustion (OMECP, 2010). The Quebec Info-Smog Program issues advisories when a pollutant reaches, or is forecast to reach, the “poor” category and makes use of similar risk reduction messages (Santé Montréal, 2017).\n\nThe AQHI does not measure the effects of odour, pollen, dust, heat, or humidity on human health. Additive health effects have been observed between heat and air pollution, leading to increases in mortality and hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (European Academies’ Science Advisory Council, 2019). However, seasonal and regional variations in heat responses, as well as other factors, have thus far precluded consideration of a combined index for heat and air quality or the incorporation of a heat indicator into the AQHI. Only minimal messaging on the combined risk of air pollution and heat is included in AQHI factsheets. When air quality and heat warnings are issued simultaneously, messages acknowledge the combined risks of the two hazards; however, integrated adaptation messaging has not been established. Some local jurisdictions have been using ad hoc combinations of content from Health Canada’s work on extreme heat and air pollution (Anderson, 2016), and there is a need to develop joint messaging.\n\nThere is no direct experimental evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of air quality forecast programs such as the AQHI in reducing population health risks. However, many studies show that health risks increase with increasing exposure to air pollution and, therefore, actions that effectively reduce exposure will reduce risk (Abelsohn & Stieb, 2011). Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of air quality advisory programs in altering behaviour (Wen et al., 2009; Spurr et al., 2014; Radisic et al., 2016). They found that individuals who were more vulnerable to air pollution (e.g., asthma sufferers) and those with more knowledge of air pollution were more likely to respond to the information provided. However, few studies have been able to address the question of whether incidence of illness decreases. A study of the impact of phone messaging of alerts to sensitive patients, with follow-up interviews on actions and symptoms, did not detect an effect on health (Mehiriz & Gosselin, 2019). Another study investigated the impact of air quality advisories in Toronto and found that the announcement of alerts was associated with a reduction of emergency department visits for asthma by 25% but could not detect an effect for any other health outcome (Chen et al., 2018).\n\nEnhancing urban green spaces can play a role as an adaptive measure to deal with climate change, while also providing potential health and social co-benefits. There has been considerable research indicating a positive association between exposure to green space and improved health outcomes, such as hypertension and cardiovascular end points (Twohig-Bennett & Jones, 2018). More recently, researchers are attempting to elucidate how green space and air pollution, two key elements of the urban environment, interact to affect health. There is emerging evidence that increased green space may attenuate the effect of air pollution (Crouse et al., 2019). For example, urban green space can provide an environment away from higher-pollution microenvironments (such as near roadways), where people can go, including to exercise. Green infrastructure, such as vegetation barriers along busy roadways, can reduce the transfer of air pollutants to nearby environments (Baldauf, 2016). Green space can also provide a cooling effect to help reduce the urban health island effect (see Chapter 3: Natural Hazards) and function as a carbon sink.\n\nWildfire smoke has become a frequent summertime feature of air quality conditions over large areas in Canada, particularly in Western Canada, with resulting attention to public health impacts and adaptation measures. Models suggest that wildfires will continue to increase in both severity and frequency due to climate change (see section 5.6 Climate Change and Air Pollution from Wildfires). Adaptation measures in response to wildfire smoke are primarily related to warning individuals and providing them with the means to reduce their exposure, particularly those who may be at increased risk of related health impacts. A qualitative study of the health impacts of the 2014 wildfires in the Northwest Territories observed a decrease in mental and emotional health among the majority of interviewees and recommended comprehensive planning and education to reduce risks in Indigenous and other communities (Dodd et al., 2018b).\n\nRecent years have seen advances in air quality modelling to incorporate wildfire smoke into air quality forecasts. Environment and Climate Change Canada developed its FireWork model as part of its operational air quality forecast system and produces twice-daily forecasts of wildfire PM2.5 for the next 48 hours. The model output is incorporated into air quality forecasts. Maps and animations of predicted smoke paths are produced, and air quality alerts are issued when necessary (Government of Canada, 2019c). The relative cohesion of a smoke plume over large distances means that wildfire episodes present particular challenges to forecasting and to the adoption of appropriate adaptive measures.\n\nCurrently, the AQHI formula is being evaluated for effectiveness in the context of wildfires. Concerns have arisen that, during smoke events, the AQHI readings do not correspond to the sensory experiences of the public in the area. An analysis was conducted with data from British Columbia, and an AQHI+ version of the index, using a formula based on one-hour PM2.5 only, was determined to have a better fit to asthma outcomes and respiratory physician visits, although not to mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. The new version is now used in British Columbia throughout the year, in conjunction with the AQHI (Yao et al., 2019). The Northwest Territories has developed a self-assessment guide for wildfire smoke and health, based on visibility (NT HSS, 2016a).\n\nExtreme ambient PM2.5 concentrations can occur, and adaptive measures that go beyond the risk reduction advice associated with the AQHI may be required. The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BC CDC) carried out an analysis of public health responses to wildfire events and identified 13 priorities for action. While all are relevant to adaptation to smoke events, three are of particular interest: developing guidance for clean air shelters that can be used during smoke events; engaging public health practitioners in wildfire emergency response; and raising public awareness of protective actions (Maguet, 2018). Evidence reviews of air filtration in institutions were conducted (Keefe, 2014), the use of clean air shelters was explored (Barn, 2014), and advice on outdoor activities and the use of protective masks was developed (BC CDC, 2014). A series of public information factsheets were developed in 2019 (BC CDC, 2019). The Manitoba Office of Disaster Management has developed guidelines for protecting community health and well-being from wildfires (Manitoba Health, 2019), as have the Northwest Territories (NT HSS, 2016b). The federal government, as well as several provinces and territories, have reports, web pages, and factsheets that advise the public on matters relating to health protection and risk reduction (OHLTC, n.d.; Saskatchewan Environment Public Health and Safety, n.d.; Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness, 2018; NT HSS, 2018; Alberta Health Services, 2019; Government of Canada, 2019d; Ministère de l’Environnement et Lutte contre les changements climatique, 2019; Yukon Health and Social Services, 2019; Health Canada, 2020).\n\nPeople with pre-existing health conditions are especially susceptible to the health impacts of poor indoor air quality (Dales et al., 2008a; To et al., 2009; Potera, 2011; Fann et al., 2016). Children have also been shown to be more susceptible to environmental pollutants (Faustman et al., 2000), and aging can lead to the deterioration of immune defences and lung function, as well as a predisposition to respiratory infections (Viegi et al., 2009).\n\nOther factors, such as an individual’s ability to adapt to or mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on their indoor environment can also influence their vulnerability to related health impacts. People who live in multi-family dwellings and/or rent their home may not be able to control temperature or humidity levels, which can influence indoor air quality by increasing pollutant emissions from building materials or enhancing the growth of mould, respectively. Renters may not be able to make modifications to their home to protect against water intrusion and infiltration of wildfire smoke (IOM, 2011; Romero-Lankao et al., 2014). In addition, those who lack financial resources or knowledge may not be able to take the necessary protective actions when faced with changes to their indoor air quality as a result of climate change (IOM, 2011). Poorly designed and poorly maintained dwellings can cause increased exposure to chemicals, moulds, and pathogens; poorly vented combustion apparatus contributes to acute and chronic disease; and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a significant health risk to adults and children (Sequel et al., 2017). Geographic location can also increase an individual’s vulnerability to health impacts, as certain areas will be more prone to extreme climate-related events such as flooding or wildfires (see Chapter 3: Natural Hazards).\n\nFirst Nations, Inuit, and Métis people may experience disproportionate health impacts from poor indoor air quality, given the existing unequal burden of illness in some Indigenous communities. For example, First Nations and Inuit children have been shown to have increased rates of severe lower respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization (Kovesi, 2012; McCuskee et al., 2014) and an increased prevalence of bronchiectasis was reported in Inuit children (Das & Kovesi, 2015). Smoking is more prevalent among Indigenous populations, with 27% of off-reserve First Nations, 26% of Métis, and 49% of Inuit people aged 12 and older smoking daily, compared to 15% of non-Indigenous people (Statistics Canada, 2015). Importantly, while high-risk behaviours, such as smoking, have adverse health impacts, their prevalence is symptomatic of “deeper social and economic issues, as well as the legacy of colonialism” (ITK, 2014).\n\nIn Canada, tuberculosis rates are four times higher among Métis people, 57 times higher among First Nations people living on reserve, 24 times higher among First Nations people living off reserve, and 284 times higher among Inuit compared to Canadian-born non-Indigenous people (PHAC, 2018; Vachon et al., 2018). In addition, heart disease has been found to be 1.5 times higher among First Nations adults living on reserve compared with the general Canadian population (Indigenous Services Canada, 2018). These existing health inequities can compound the health risks related to climate change impacts on indoor air quality.\n\nFirst Nations, Inuit, and Métis people commonly experience higher rates of poverty, overcrowding in homes, and poor housing quality (Adelson, 2005; NCCAH, 2017; Statistics Canada, 2017), which can increase the risk of health impacts from poor indoor air quality. For example, 27% of First Nations people with registered or “Treaty Indian” status and 26% of Inuit lived in a dwelling in need of major repairs in 2016 (Statistics Canada, 2017), and more than half of adults in First Nations communities reported the presence of mould or mildew in their homes (Health Canada, 2014). Similarly, the 2011 census indicated that, among Inuit, one-third of all dwellings were in need of major repairs in comparison to 14% of Métis homes and 7% for the overall Canadian population (NCCAH, 2017). Climate change impacts on indoor air quality are expected to exacerbate health risks related to poor quality and overcrowded housing.\n\nClimate change and air quality are intimately linked; a warming climate can worsen air pollution (i.e., the climate penalty), and some air pollutants, including ozone and components of PM2.5, can affect the climate and enhance warming. GHGs and air pollutants are also derived from common sources linked to fossil fuel combustion; therefore, strategies to address one may have important co-benefits of reducing emissions of the other.\n\nAir pollution is the leading environmental cause of death in Canada, contributing to an estimated 15,300 deaths annually, along with many non-fatal outcomes (Health Canada, 2021). Recent research indicates that the adverse effects of air pollution extend beyond cardiorespiratory impacts, linking exposure to varied outcomes such as diabetes, dementia, and reproductive health. Even small increases in exposure to air pollution are associated with an increased risk of adverse health impacts. The broad range of adverse health effects caused by air pollution, along with the ubiquitous and involuntary nature of air pollution exposure, highlight the importance of air quality management as a key public health issue.\n\nStudies that have quantified the climate penalty in terms of air pollution health impacts under various climate projections have focused primarily on ozone, with some addressing PM2.5 as well. Analyses undertaken for this assessment estimate hundreds of excess annual deaths due to air pollution in 2050, associated with the impact of climate change on air pollution, primarily in Ontario and Quebec, with a net social value of $2.7 billion. Similarly, studies in the United States have reported hundreds to thousands of excess annual air pollution deaths later this century associated with a warming climate.\n\nImportantly, many studies have reported the considerable potential air pollution health co-benefits of pursuing climate change mitigation strategies that target either long-lived climate pollutants (e.g., CO2) or short-lived climate forcers (e.g., black carbon or methane). Although climate benefits of near-term GHG emission reductions may only be realized in the mid- to long-term and generally occur globally, the public health benefits of the associated reductions in air pollutant emissions would be realized immediately and locally where the emission reductions are implemented. In addition, these benefits can have a large social value, which can offset a portion of the GHG mitigation costs. Incorporating air quality health co-benefits into climate change mitigation policy provides additional justification for pursuing more stringent or accelerated reduction measures to address climate change. Joint consideration of options to reduce both GHG and air pollution emissions would contribute to the strategic development of policies that optimize both and help to avoid unintended negative consequences, such as inadvertent increases in air pollution emissions from implementation of GHG mitigation strategies.\n\nWildfires have become an important source of air pollution in Canada, and increasing wildfire emissions due to climate change represent one of the most significant risks to air quality. It is expected that wildfire frequency, severity, and distribution will change under a warming climate, resulting in higher emissions, and the evidence suggests that some of the current increased wildfire activity can already be attributed to climate change. Exposure to wildfire smoke affects respiratory health, while the evidence for cardiovascular outcomes remains inconclusive. A Canadian analysis estimates 620 to 2700 annual deaths attributable to wildfire emissions during the 2013 to 2018 period, with an annual net social value ranging from $4.7 billion to $21 billion, as well as many non-fatal cardiorespiratory effects. Overall, the greatest impacts were noted in British Columbia and Alberta, although during the 2013 fire season the greatest impacts were reported in Ontario and Quebec. Although the highest air pollution concentrations are expected to occur closer to the fires, smoke plumes can spread over vast areas of the country, affecting population centres far from the sources. For example, 20% to 30% of the Canadian population was exposed to average wildfire PM2.5 concentrations of 1 μg/m3 or more during the May to September season in 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018. The current air pollution health impacts of wildfire smoke are expected to increase under climate change, making this an important public health issue.\n\nCanadians spend 90% of their time indoors, and climate change is expected to impact indoor air quality in a variety of ways. It is anticipated that climate change will include more frequent extreme weather events, which raise the risk of health effects from mould due to flooding, smoke from wildfires, and indoor air pollution from the inappropriate use of combustion sources, among other impacts. In addition, increased home airtightness associated with improved energy efficiency requires sufficient ventilation to ensure pollutants do not accumulate indoors. Conversely, under conditions of poor outdoor air pollution, impacts on indoor air quality can be mitigated through increased home airtightness and the use of air conditioning and filtration. Economic resources are typically needed to take protective measures, such as increasing home airtightness and ventilation. Thus, low-income households and socially disadvantaged communities may face challenges with implementing such measures.\n\nAmbient levels of aeroallergens, including pollen and fungal spores, have been associated with increased risk of asthma-related and allergic rhinitis-related hospital visits in Canada, as well as other adverse effects. Warming temperatures, changing weather conditions, and rising atmospheric CO2 levels result in increases in pollen counts, season length, and allergenicity, as well as changes to species distribution. Asthma affects about 3 million Canadians, including 12% to 25% of children, while approximately one-quarter of Canadians suffer from allergic rhinitis. Both of these conditions are commonly triggered by aeroallergens. The incidence and prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis are projected to increase with climate change.\n\nA key goal of air quality management in Canada is continuous improvement, through reductions in air pollutant emissions across multiple sectors (CCME, 2019). However, additional programs have been developed to address the health risks of air pollution by reducing exposure, and these programs will become increasingly important to counterbalance the expected negative impacts of climate change.\n\nThe AQHI serves as a health-protection tool designed to help Canadians make decisions to protect their health by limiting short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution. The AQHI reports current and forecast conditions daily for communities across Canada and provides specific advice related to air quality levels associated with low, moderate, high, and very high health risks, including for susceptible individuals. In addition, local authorities use air quality alerts or advisories under high-risk conditions. The AQHI does not measure effects from heat, and there is currently only limited integration of heat and air quality messages for the public in Canada. The Government of Canada also provides forecasts of wildfire PM2.5 levels for the next 48 hours, which include mapping of predicted smoke paths, and fire smoke air quality alerts are issued when necessary. The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control has implemented an alternative version of the AQHI during the wildfire season to better reflect risks during wildfire smoke events, and multiple provinces and territories have information for protecting community health from wildfire smoke.\n\nEnhancing urban green space can have multiple co-benefits for health, including direct positive health impacts as well as a role in attenuating exposure to air pollution and contributing to the reduction of the urban heat island effect.\n\nAdaptation strategies to address indoor air quality in Canada under a changing climate will require a multi-faceted risk management approach that incorporates control of indoor sources of air pollutants, adequate ventilation under increasing home airtightness, and air filtration. Flood-prevention strategies would help to mitigate mould caused by water damage, and increased use of CO detection would help to prevent deaths from CO poisoning during power outages. In addition, targeting actions to rural, geographically affected, or low-income communities can help to protect populations at higher risk.\n\nDaily aeroallergen forecasts, which can aid in reducing exposure to aeroallergens and optimization of pharmacotherapy for allergy sufferers, are currently provided in Canada by ARL through the Weather Network. Community-based adaptation strategies to reduce pollen levels could include urban greening with low-allergenicity species. A project in Quebec has shown that municipal-level partnerships may be effective in coordinating multiple control strategies to address ragweed, a common allergen species."
