        "text": "Government and Politics\n\nAndrew Rollo Captures Île Saint-Jean\n\nBrigadier-General Andrew Rollo, the 5th Lord Rollo, captured Île Saint-Jean (now Prince Edward Island) from the French at the height of the Seven Years'' War. Roughly 3,500 Acadians were swiftly repatriated to France whilst Rollo constructed Fort Amherst in honour of, and on orders from, General Jeffrey Amherst.\n\nPeople\n\nBirth of George Coles\n\nBusinessman and politician George Coles was born in Prince Edward Island. Coles was a prominent PEI businessman who specialized in many sectors, including brewing and distilling. A Father of Confederation, Coles supported union initially, but changed his mind because he believed that the terms of union extended to PEI did not address its needs.\n\nPeople\n\nBirth of John Hamilton Gray\n\nJohn Hamilton Gray was born in Charlottetown, PEI. Gray supported Confederation as premier of Prince Edward Island and host of the Charlottetown Conference in 1864. The majority of Islanders were against union, and this lack of public support (and his wife’s ill health) led to Gray’s resignation from office in 1864.\n\nPeople\n\nMcKitrick of PEI Killed\n\nSergeant Joseph McKitrick of Prince Edward Island was killed in action with the Glengarry Light Infantry at Fort Erie, Upper Canada. He is believed to be the only Islander killed in the war.\n\nPeople\n\nBirth of Thomas Heath Haviland\n\nThomas Heath Haviland, a Father of Confederation, was born in Charlottetown, PE. A long-time politician from a prominent Island family, Haviland had an impact on Prince Edward Island’s social and political spheres. He supported Confederation even when many Islanders did not. Fear of American annexation and railroad debt eventually swayed the public to Haviland’s position, and Prince Edward Island joined Confederation in 1873.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nPrince Edward Island Disenfranchises Women\n\nThe Prince Edward Island Legislature excluded women from the franchise. For a time, there were regions in British North America where some women could vote; however, just as in Prince Edward Island, statutes were passed to disqualify women in places such as the Province of Canada and Nova Scotia.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nStanislas Poirier (Perry) elected to the PEI Assembly\n\nStanislas-François Poirier (Perry) became the first Acadian elected to the House of Assembly of Prince Edward Island. Twenty years later, in 1874, he became the first Acadian Member of Parliament.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nCharlottetown Conference\n\nThe Charlottetown Conference was held in Charlottetown, PEI. At the conference Maritime union was virtually dropped, and the delegates agreed to meet a new conference in Québec to discuss a Canadian scheme for a union of all the colonies.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of Edward Whelan\n\nJournalist and politician Edward Whelan died in Charlottetown, PEI. Whelan was a reformer, using his newspaper as a platform for his views on property issues and unification. A Father of Confederation, Whelan served as an Island delegate to the Québec Conference. He was Prince Edward Island’s only pro-Confederation Liberal.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of George Coles\n\nPolitician George Coles died in Charlottetown, PEI. Known as a feisty character, Coles is said to have dueled with fellow Father of Confederation Edward Palmer, and was convicted of assault. While in the provincial government, he spent a month in custody, refusing to withdraw a statement made in the Assembly.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of William Henry Pope\n\nWilliam Henry Pope, a Father of Confederation, died in St. Eleanors, PE. A lawyer and land agent, Pope articled with Father of Confederation Edward Palmer. Pope advocated for union in and out of public office. His push for a railroad inadvertently led to Prince Edward Island’s joining Canada over bankruptcy woes.\n\nCommunication and Transportation Sports and Culture\n\nThe Marco Polo Runs Aground\n\nThe famously fast clipper Marco Polo, which had been launched 32 years earlier from Saint John, NB, ran aground on the coast of Prince Edward Island. Local residents rescued the crew. Among the spectators was a young Lucy Maud Montgomery, who would publish her first newspaper article, “The Wreck of the Marco Polo,” eight years later.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of Edward Palmer\n\nEdward Palmer, a Father of Confederation, died in Charlottetown, PE. Palmer made a name for himself in Island politics as a Conservative, disapproving of reform attempts in government and land holding. He was strongly anti-Confederation. Palmer accepted Confederation in 1873 as Prince Edward Island faced imminent financial collapse over railway construction debts.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of Andrew Archibald Macdonald\n\nAndrew Archibald Macdonald, a Father of Confederation, died in Ottawa. Macdonald followed his father and uncle into politics, where he was often embroiled in such controversial issues as land reform, separate schools and railway construction. Though not wholly supportive, Macdonald moved to accept the terms of Confederation in 1873. He was appointed lieutenant-governor of Prince Edward Island in 1884 and Senator in 1891.\n\nCommunication and Transportation\n\nPEI Allows Cars\n\nPrince Edward Island finally decided to allow cars onto all the province’s roads after dismissing them as a “fad” and restricting them for several years.\n\nResources and Environment\n\nPrince Edward Island National Park Established\n\nPrince Edward Island National Park was established. A narrow strip of coastline stretching over 40 km along the north shore of PEI, the park is a fragile seascape of red sandstone cliffs and sweeping beaches, backed by shifting sand dunes held together by the roots of slender grasses.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nFirst Nations Win Right to Vote Provincially\n\nExcept in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, Status Indians had been barred from voting provincially. Beginning with British Columbia in 1949 and ending with Quebec in 1969, First Nations peoples gradually win the right to vote in provincial elections without losing status or treaty rights.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nMilligan Becomes Premier of PEI\n\nKeith Milligan, a former silver fox fur farmer, was sworn in as premier of PEI following the resignation of Catherine Callbeck. He had been chosen leader on 5 October.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nMacLauchlan Becomes Premier\n\nLiberal candidate Wade MacLauchlan was sworn in as the 32nd premier of Prince Edward Island, taking over the province's leadership following the resignation of Robert Ghiz. MacLauchlan, who has held professorships in law and written a biography of PEI premier Alex B. Campbell, was president of the University of Prince Edward Island from 1999 to 2011."
