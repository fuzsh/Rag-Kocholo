        "text": "December 30, 2020\n\nOTTAWA—Her Excellency the Right Honourable Julie Payette, Governor General of Canada, today announced 61 new appointments to the Order of Canada. The new member list includes 1 Companion (C.C.), 13 Officers (O.C.) and 47 Members (C.M.). Recipients will be invited to accept their insignia at a ceremony to be held at a future date.\n\nAbout the Order of Canada\n\nCreated in 1967, the Order of Canada is one of our country’s highest honours. Presented by the governor general, the Order honours people whose service shapes our society; whose innovations ignite our imaginations; and whose compassion unites our communities.\n\nMore than 7 000 people from all sectors of society have been invested into the Order of Canada. Their contributions are varied, yet they have all enriched the lives of others and have taken to heart the motto of the Order: DESIDERANTES MELIOREM PATRIAM (“They desire a better country”). The striking, six-point white enamel insignia they wear symbolizes our northern heritage and our diversity, because no two snowflakes are alike.\n\nAppointments are made by the governor general on the recommendation of the Advisory Council for the Order of Canada. For more information about the Order of Canada program, visit www.gg.ca/en/honours/canadian-honours/order-canada.\n\nAbout the Chancellery of Honours\n\nBestowment of Distinctions by the governor general are the result of nominations submitted by the general public to the Chancellery of Honours. The Chancellery of Honours administers more than 30 different distinctions, which are awarded to worthy Canadians each year, notably the Order of Canada, Decorations for Bravery, Meritorious Service Decorations (Civil Division), Polar Medal and the Sovereign’s Medal for Volunteers.\n\nAll nominations from the public are researched by the Chancellery of Honours and presented to independent advisory councils and committees throughout the year. The advisory bodies consider nominations and recommend to the governor general to appoint or award.\n\nWith their keen insights and knowledge of their community, every Canadian is invited to learn about these programs and to submit a nomination for an inspiring community leader, a dedicated volunteer or an individual who is bettering their life. For more information visit www.gg.ca/en/honours.\n\nThe list of recipients, with short citations, is on the following webpage: https://www.gg.ca/en/activities/2020/governor-general-announces-61-new-appointments-order-canada.\n\n-30-\n\nMedia information:"
