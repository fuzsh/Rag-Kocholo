        "text": "Sir Edward Heath, the former Conservative prime minister who took Britain into Europe and became a symbol of moderate Tory resistance to the excesses of Thatcherism, died last night of pneumonia. He was 89.\n\nHe stood down as an MP in 2001, 27 years after being voted out of Downing Street. He lost the Tory leadership to his unlikely challenger, Margaret Thatcher, in 1975 - a year after he lost two elections in rapid succession.\n\nThe first politician of genuinely working class background to become leader of the until-then aristocratically led Conservatives (he was the son of a Broadstairs builder), Heath had been an anti-fascist Tory student at Oxford and served in tanks during the invasion of Germany in 1944-45. This record helped to ensure the patronage of Winston Churchill and a rapid rise after first being elected in 1950.\n\nSir Edward's place in history remains uncertain because of the controversial character of his four-year premiership from 1970 to 1974. He entered No 10 after voters ejected Harold Wilson's Labour government, not least over its failure to achieve trade union reform. Alongside Sir Edward's groundbreaking Industrial Relations Act, which the unions resisted passionately, and his commitment to free market economics lay a determination to take Britain into the then-European Economic Community.\n\nHe succeeded on January 1 1973. But that achievement was never wholeheartedly embraced by the public, any more than his union reforms, even though Heath had retreated from his free market reforms and had nationalised Rolls-Royce, when unemployment started rising sharply.\n\nAfter a series of brushes with an increasingly militant trade union movement he called a general election in February 1974 to establish \"who governs Britain?\" when the National Union of Miners, led by Joe Gormley, was engaged in a strike that appeared to threaten the elected government.\n\nThe strategy was mishandled and Heath lost, in part because his old enemy, Enoch Powell, urged supporters to vote Labour because it had promised a European referendum.\n\nAfter attempts to do a deal with the Liberals, he resigned and Wilson returned to No 10. Wilson's attempt to win a working majority in October 1974 delivered a majority of just three, but Heath's fate was sealed.\n\nFew took Mrs Thatcher's challenge seriously, let alone her commitment to wholesale reform of the unions and what became known as Thatcherism - privatisation at home, a militant anti-Soviet stance in the cold war and growing disdain for Europe.\n\nBut across the western world the tide was running Mrs Thatcher and Ronald Reagan's way, and Heath was dismissed as a failure who had been reduced to \"the longest sulk\" in Westminster history against the woman who outshone him.\n\nOver the years the unions and Labour politicians who had condemned Sir Edward came to realise that, compared with what came later, he had been a moderate and fundamentally sympathetic figure.\n\nBut he retained friends and influence around the world, not least in communist China, where his willingness to defend the regime, especially after the Tiananmen Square massacres of 1989. triggered controversy and criticism. He also flew to Baghdad to mediate with Saddam Hussein.\n\nSince the death of Lord Callaghan this year - at 94 the oldest man ever to have been prime minister - Sir Edward was one of the last links between between wartime military service and high public office in the 1960s and 70s.\n\nSir Edward grew up under the shadow of Hitler and took himself to Germany as a Balliol College Oxford student. In old age he would tell visitors how, at a Nuremburg rally the German dictator had passed so close that his arm brushed the future PM's sleeve.\n\nSir Edward - Ted to his friends and Grocer Heath to Private Eye - never married, and poured his emotional life into music, conducting several famous orchestras as well as the annual Broadstairs Christmas concert.\n\nBut his acquired passion was sailing and, even when busy as prime minister, he led his crew on Morning Cloud to victory in the Sydney to Hobart race."
