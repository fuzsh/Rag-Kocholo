        "text": "The controversial police investigation into allegations that Sir Edward Heath was a paedophile will be considered by the London-based child sexual abuse inquiry.\n\nThe findings of Operation Conifer, the two-year, £1.5m examination carried out by Wiltshire police, are due to be published in the coming weeks.\n\nIn advance of their release, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales has confirmed that it will include the report in its work on public figures who were at one stage allegedly associated with a ”Westminster paedophile ring”.\n\nThe IICSA has cautioned, however, that its involvement is unlikely to establish whether the allegations are true. Its involvement is expected to be limited to how law enforcement agencies responded to the claims. Victims groups have criticised the inquiry for being too ambitious in its scope and not exposing new evidence.\n\nA spokesperson for IICSA said: “In the context of the Westminster investigation, the inquiry will be interested to see and consider the outcome of Wiltshire police’s investigation into allegations against Sir Edward Heath.\n\n“The inquiry’s remit is institutional failure to protect children and the inquiry is unlikely to need to examine whether allegations of abuse made against any particular parliamentarian are true during the course of its work. Its job is to examine institutional failures in connection with allegations made, and this will include considering the adequacy and propriety of law enforcement investigations.”\n\nThe Wiltshire police investigation was launched in 2015 after Heath was named as a suspect in an investigation into historical child sexual abuse.\n\nThere are currently 13 broad strands in the inquiry, scrutinising areas of public life ranging through to the roles of local authorities, churches, the internet and migration programmes as well as that of politicians at Westminster.\n\nLast month Wiltshire police confirmed that it had briefed IICSA on its investigation and would pass on its findings to the inquiry.\n\nHeath, who led the Conservative government from 1970 to 1974, died at home in Salisbury in July 2005, aged 89.\n\nMike Veale, the chief constable of Wiltshire police, has vowed not to buckle under “unacceptable” media pressure and insisted that his investigation is not a “fishing trip” or a “witch-hunt”.\n\nA “significant number of individuals have disclosed allegations of abuse”, he said last December in a statement aimed at rebuffing media criticism and keeping the investigation on track."
