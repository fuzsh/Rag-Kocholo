Some of the alleged crimes can be corroborated with news reports or successful court prosecutions while the vast majority appear to be ‘known crimes’ that are successfully covered up.\n\nResults\n\nThe widespread organisational structures parallel the Marc Dutroux case in Belgium. It appears to be the case that compromised mental health professionals and authority representatives shield the cult. It becomes an ethical obligation for the silent majority to speak out against such criminality and demand from their government effective investigation and prosecution.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhilst an enquiry into historical allegations of institutional abuse is currently underway in the UK several cases emerged recently where satanic cults seemingly continue to be protected by the vested interests. Mental health professionals must stand up for victims and resist ill-conceived authority attempts to persecute abuse survivors and their supporters.\n\nDisclosure of interest\n\nThe author has not supplied his declaration of competing interest.\n\nType\n\nEV673\n\nInformation\n\nEuropean Psychiatry , Volume 33 , Issue S1: Abstracts of the 24th European Congress of Psychiatry , March 2016 , pp. S456\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.01.1658 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © European Psychiatric Association 2016\n\nYou have Access\n\nCited by\n\nLoading..."
