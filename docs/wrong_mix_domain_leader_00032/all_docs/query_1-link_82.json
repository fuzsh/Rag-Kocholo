        "text": "At least four police forces are investigating sex abuse allegations linked to late former British prime minister Sir Edward Heath, it has been revealed.\n\nOn a dramatic day, the late Conservative leader was named in connection with inquiries carried out by detectives in London, Kent and Jersey.\n\nOn Monday, Wiltshire Police appealed for potential victims and witnesses to come forward after the politician became the most high-profile figure embroiled in historical child sex claims.\n\nReports subsequently emerged that Sir Edward is being scrutinised as part of Operation Midland, a Scotland Yard inquiry into claims a VIP paedophile ring operated in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has not confirmed the claims. A spokesman said: “We are not giving a running commentary on Operation Midland.”\n\nOperation Whistle\n\nThe States of Jersey Police (SoJP) confirmed the former prime minister features in Operation Whistle, an inquiry into alleged historical abuse on the island.\n\nOperation Whistle was launched by police in Jersey in June as part of Operation Hydrant, a UK-wide co-ordination of sex abuse inquiries.\n\nLater, Kent Police said it had received a report on Tuesday of a sexual assault in the east of the county in the 1960s.\n\nA spokesman said: “The victim has named Sir Edward Heath in connection with the allegation. Detectives are making initial inquiries and will obtain a full account from the victim.”\n\nWiltshire Police said its officers and the NSPCC had received “a number of calls” following appeals for information.\n\nThe force said in a statement: “The investigation team will be reviewing the information and following up any lines of inquiry as a result.”\n\nA spokeswoman said they were unable to confirm how many people had made contact, and the “validity” of the calls was not known at this stage.\n\nThey have received a mixture of “intelligence” and “third party” calls, she added.\n\nSir Edward’s name was dramatically linked to paedophile claims on Monday when the police watchdog announced an inquiry into allegations that a prosecution against an individual was shelved after a threat was made to “expose” the politician.\n\nA woman who was in charge of a brothel had been due to stand trial, but said she would expose him, according to reports.\n\nThe IPCC is also looking into whether Wiltshire Police followed up a claim made against him in the 1990s.\n\nRape claim\n\nMeanwhile a man claimed he was raped at the age of 12 by the former PM.\n\nThe alleged victim, now aged in his 60s, has claimed he reported being sexually assaulted by the Conservative MP in 1961 but was branded “a liar and a fantasist”.\n\nLabour MP Tom Watson has claimed he passed information relating to two allegations of child abuse involving Sir Edward to police since 2012.\n\nThe Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation said: \"We welcome the investigation by Wiltshire Police, which we wholeheartedly believe will clear Sir Edward's name and we will co-operate fully with the police in their inquiries.\"\n\nFormer Conservative MP Brian Binley, who worked in Sir Edward's office for a period of time, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I find it very difficult to believe from the Ted Heath that I knew.\n\n“There are many unanswered questions here and I don’t think it would be right and fair to jump to conclusions about a man who served his country with dignity and with care, who was a considerable intellect, loved his music.\n\n“We must be very careful. It’s easy to smear people not around.”\n\nFamously reticent\n\nSir Edward, who led the Conservative government between 1970 and 1974, never married and was famously reticent about his private life.\n\nOne biographer concluded that he may have been a latent or repressed homosexual while another thought he was “pretty well sexless”.\n\nAway from politics he was noted for his enthusiasm for sailing and classical music. Sir Edward died at home in Salisbury aged 89 in July 2005."
