        "text": "January 1\n\n1808 The law passed by Congress in 1807 prohibiting the importation of slaves into the U.S. went into effect. The Revenue Cutter Service enforced the law on the high seas.\n\n1850 The light in the Minot's Ledge Lighthouse was first shown. This lighthouse was the first one built in the U.S. in a position directly exposed to the sweep of the open sea. It was destroyed and two keepers were killed in a great gale in April 1851.\n\n1933 Carl C. von Paulsen, a pioneering Coast Guard aviator, and his crew of four rescued a man during a gale off the coast of Florida while flying in the Coast Guard seaplane Arcturus from Air Station Miami. He and his crew were awarded a Gold Lifesaving Medal, the first Coast Guard aviators to earn the prestigious award.\n\n1937 Effective this date, the dividing point between the 6th and 7th Lighthouse Districts on the east coast of Florida was moved northward from Hillsboro Inlet to St. Lucie Inlet to place the new trans-Florida waterway (through Lake Okeechobee) under one jurisdiction.\n\n1946 The Coast Guard, which had operated as a service under the Navy since November 1, 1941, was returned to the Treasury Department, pursuant to Executive Order 9666, dated December 28, 1945.\n\n1946 The International Load Lines Convention, which had been suspended since August 9, 1941, was restored to full effectiveness by a Presidential proclamation dated December 21, 1945. The Coast Guard assumed the enforcement of the convention's requirements in the interest of safe loading.\n\n1954 The \"Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1948\", commonly known as the \"Revised International Rules of the Road\", became law. These were a result of the International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea, 1948.\n\n1958 The Coast Guard ceased listening continuously for distress calls on 2670 kilocycles. Although the countries of the world had agreed at the Atlantic City Convention of the International Telecommunication Union in 1947 to use 2182 kilocycles for international maritime mobile radiotelephone calling and distress, the Coast Guard had continued listening on the old frequency until the public had had sufficient time to change to the new one.\n\n1967 CGC Point Gammon destroyed an enemy trawler in Vietnam.\n\n1984 CGC Westwind was heavily damaged by ice in Antarctic's Weddell Sea. About 120 feet of the port-side hull was gashed when brash ice forced the ship against a 100-foot sheer ice shelf. The gash was two to three feet wide and was six feet above the water line. The crew made temporary repairs. There were no injuries.\n\n1985 CGC Citrus was rammed by the M/V Pacific Star during a boarding incident. The Pacific Star then sank after being scuttled by her crew. There were no casualties. The seven crewmen were arrested on drug charges.\n\n1999 The Aviation Machinist ratings merged with the Aviation Structural Mechanic ratings to form the Aviation Maintenance Technician rating with the designator AMT. The Aviation Electronics Technician rating became the Avionics Technician rating with the designator AVT. The Aviation Survivalman rating was renamed Aviation Survival Technician.\n\nJanuary 2\n\n1892 The British schooner H. P. Kirkham wrecked on Rose and Crown Shoal. The crew of seven was rescued after 15 hours of exposure. The lifesaving crew that rescued them was at sea in an open boat without food for 23 hours.\n\n1986 Andy Lee Howay was born in flight at 12,000 feet over Gaylord, Michigan aboard Coast Guard HU-25 CGNR 2110 out of Air Station Traverse City. He was born two months premature and weighed 3.5 pounds upon birth. Aboard the aircraft were CAPT Martin Niemeroff, USPHS and an obstetrics nurse from Munson Medical Center. Andy attended the retirement ceremony for CGNR 2110 in 2013.\n\nJanuary 3\n\n1882 The watch at Station No. 13, Second District, Massachusetts, reported at about 4 p.m., the collision of two schooners, two and a half miles east southeast of the station. Launching the surfboat, the crew proceeded to the vessels. The smaller vessel, the British schooner Dart, was boarded first. She was out from Saint John, NB and bound for New York with a cargo of lumber and a crew of four persons. The vessel was badly damaged, having her bowsprit, jib boom, and headgear carried away. The life-saving crew at once set to work. They cleared away the wreck and weighed her anchor, which had been let go in the collision. By this time, the steamer Hercules, of Philadelphia had come alongside and Dart’s master arranged for a tow to Vineyard Haven. The life-saving crew ran the hawser from the schooner to the steamer and sent them on their way. The other schooner, in the meantime, had sailed away.\n\n1944 CDR Frank Erickson received an official commendation after he piloted a Sikorsky HNS-1 helicopter that carried two cases of blood plasma lashed to the helicopter's floats from New York City to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, for the treatment of Navy crewmen of the Navy destroyer USS Turner, which had exploded and burned off New York harbor. Having performed that heroic deed in violent winds and snow that grounded all other aircraft Erickson became the first pilot in the world to fly a helicopter under such conditions. It was also the first \"lifesaving flight\" ever performed by a helicopter.\n\n2003 CGC Boutwell departed Alameda in preparation for supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. The cutter began operations in the Arabian Gulf on February 14, 2003. Prior to the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom, her crew conducted maritime interception boardings to enforce U.N. sanctions against Iraq. At the outbreak of hostilities and throughout the conflict, she operated in the strategically critical and politically sensitive Khawr Abd Allah and Shaat Al Arab Waterways, providing force protection to the massive coalition fleet, securing Iraqi oil terminals, and preventing the movement of weapons, personnel, or equipment by Saddam Hussein's regime or other guerilla or terrorist forces.\n\n2014 CGC Polar Star received a request from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority on January 3, 2014 to assist the Russian-flagged Akademik Shokalskiy and Chinese-flagged Xue Long, reportedly ice-bound in the Antarctic. The Russian and Chinese governments also requested assistance from the United States. After resupplying in Sydney, Polar Star was en route to the stranded vessels on January 4th, enduring 50 knot winds, 20 foot seas and 40 degree rolls. The Coast Guard icebreaker left its homeport of Seattle in December 2013 to support Operation Deep Freeze. The ship’s mission was to break a channel through the sea ice of McMurdo Sound to allow the resupply and refueling of the U.S. Antarctic Program’s McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott South Pole stations. Polar Star was released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority from SAR duties on January 7, 2014, following confirmation that both stricken vessels were free from the Antarctic ice due to a favorable change in wind conditions. The Coast Guard Pacific Area command center received confirmation from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority that both ships broke through the heavy ice, rendering assistance from the Polar Star no longer necessary.\n\nJanuary 4\n\n1980 Coast Guard forces narrowly averted an environmental disaster when the 300-foot barge Michelle F, with more than 2.8 million gallons of No. Six industrial fuel aboard grounded one-half mile offshore from the Brigantine Wildlife Refuge. Much of her cargo was offloaded before she was successfully refloated.\n\n2012 CGC Healy, under the command of CAPT Beverly Havlik, embarked on an Arctic domestic icebreaking mission to escort the Russian tanker vessel Renda through 800 miles of Bering Sea pack ice to deliver 1.3 million gallons of fuel to ice-bound Nome, Alaska. After 10 days of intense, close aboard ice escorting, the two vessels safely arrived on 14 January 2012 and began a successful 60-hour, over-the-ice fuel transfer while hove to in the ice 468 yards offshore of Nome.\n\nJanuary 5\n\n1883 At 1 o’clock in the afternoon the crew of the Quoddy Head Station discovered a schooner at anchor. The weather was bitter cold, with a gale from the northwest. The men got the station's boat out and pulled to the vessel. She proved to be Clara Dinsmore from Boston. There were four men on board, one of them a passenger. With her sails iced up and splitting, she was in need of assistance. The keeper took charge and got the vessel under way with the sails she had left and beat her up the bay to her destination at 6 o’clock in the evening.\n\n1975 The \"Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC)\" Showa Maru ran aground in the Straits of Malacca, eight miles from Singapore Harbor, resulting in a major oil spill. At the request of the Japanese Government, 10 Coast Guardsmen from the National Strike Force were sent to Singapore aboard a Military Airlift Command aircraft. In addition to the team, four pumping subsystems of the Coast Guard's Air Deliverable Anti-Pollution Transfer System (ADAPTS) were also airlifted to the scene. The governments of Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia concurred in the request for assistance. This incident marked the second time in a year that the Strike Force responded to the request of a foreign government for assistance, the first being a request by the Chilean government to assist after the grounding of VLCC Metula in the Strait of Magellan in August 1974.\n\nJanuary 6\n\n1934 The United States Line SS Washington came within inches of ramming the new Light Vessel No. 117 on the Nantucket Station. The liner scraped the lightship’s side, shearing off davits, a lifeboat, antennas, etc. Five months later the lightship was sunk by the White Star Line RMS Olympic when it rammed the lightship, killing seven of the lightship's crew.\n\n1973 The Coast Guard Academy at New London, Connecticut, announced that its cadets were served \"meals for the first time by female civilian employees.\" The Academy had \"recently become the first of the nation’s service schools to contract their food services to a civilian company.\" Previously, Coast Guard personnel had done the serving.\n\nJanuary 7\n\n1877 The French steamer Amerique grounded off Sea Bright, New Jersey. Saved were 189 persons, rescued by the Life-Saving Service crew. Despite their efforts, three died.\n\n1947 During Operation Highjump, Coast Guard icebreaker CGC Northwind successfully completed the first major rescue mission involving a submarine. USS Sennet (SS-408) and supply ships Yance and Merrick were stuck in ice flow at the Antarctic Circle.\n\n1982 LT Colleen A. Cain, the Coast Guard's first female HH-52 helicopter pilot, died in the line of duty when HH-52 CG-1420, on which she was co-pilot, crashed into a mountainside 50 miles east of Honolulu. The pilot, LCDR H. W. Johnson, and aircrewman AD2 D. L. Thompson, were also killed.\n\n1994 The barge Morris J. Berman, carrying a cargo of 750,000 gallons of oil, struck a reef off Puerto Rico. Coast Guard units, including the National Strike Force, responded.\n\nJanuary 8\n\n1958 The Coast Guard LORAN Station at Johnston Island began transmitting on a 24-hour basis, thus establishing a new LORAN rate in the Central Pacific. The new rate between Johnston Island and French Frigate Shoal gave a higher order of accuracy for fixing positions in the steamship lanes from Oahu, Hawaii, to Midway Island. In the past, this was impossible in some areas along this important shipping route.\n\n2015 The U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards commenced Operation Coal Shovel seasonal domestic ice breaking operations in the southern part of Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, the St. Clair and Detroit River systems, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. The mission of Operation Coal Shovel was to quickly reopen the Great Lakes maritime transportation system for the movement of commercial vessels that may become beset in the ice. The previous winter of 2013-2014 presented some of the harshest ice conditions ever recorded in the Great Lakes. At one point during March 2014, 92.5 percent of the Great Lakes were covered by ice; this was the highest percentage of ice coverage seen since 1979. Operation Coal Shovel 2013-2014 started in December 2013 and lasted for a total of 128 days.\n\nJanuary 9\n\n1844 The first published and systematic annual report of the Revenue Marine Bureau was transmitted to Congress on January 9, 1844 by the head of the Bureau, Revenue Captain Alexander Fraser, the service's first \"Commandant.\" The report noted that the Revenue Marine consisted of 15 revenue schooners varying in size from 60 to 170 tons. The cutters were stationed at Eastport, Portland, Boston, Newport, New York, Delaware Bay, Baltimore, Norfolk, Charleston, Savannah, Key West, Mobile, New Orleans, and Lake Erie. The report also noted that the number of personnel of the Revenue Marine consisted of 20 captains, 20 first lieutenants, 20 second lieutenants, 20 third lieutenants, 45 petty officers, 7 pilots, 30 stewards, 15 cooks, and 323 seamen.\n\n1945 Coast Guardsmen participated in the liberation of Luzon in the Philippines. Sixteen Coast Guard-manned vessels and seven other Navy vessels with partial Coast Guard crews took part in the offensive.\n\n1952 SS Pennsylvania broadcasted that she had sustained a 14-foot crack in her port side. A tremendous sea was running, and the wind exceeded 55 miles per hour. The master advised that the vessel was foundering and that 45 men were abandoning ship in four lifeboats 665 miles west of Cape Flattery, WA. The Coast Guard used all the facilities at its command in the area, as well as coordinating the use of U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Royal Canadian Air Force facilities in an attempt to locate and rescue the survivors of the vessel. Fifty-one aircraft from all services and 18 surface vessels participated in the search. Some of the debris was located, including one over-turned lifeboat, but no survivors were found.\n\nJanuary 10\n\n1889 RC Wolcott made the first-ever at sea seizure of both a smuggling vessel and drugs, and the arrest of its crew, after stopping the British sloop Emerald with 400 lbs of opium and 12 undocumented Chinese aliens at the entrance to Port Discovery Bay, WT.\n\n1977 CGC Cape George received a mayday broadcast from the motor tankship Chester A. Poling. The 281-foot tankship was breaking in half in high seas and sinking approximately eight miles ESE of Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts, with seven POB. CGCs Cape George, Cape Cross, Firebush, Decisive, and boats from CG Station Gloucester, Point Allerton, and Merrimack River, and aircraft from Air Station Cape Cod all responded. Cape George arrived on scene and rescued two persons stranded on the bow section. A CG HH-3F rescued the first person from the stern of the tankship and a second crewman fell off the stern while attempting to jump into the rescue basket. At this time the stern section rolled over, throwing the remaining three survivors into the frigid seas. CGC Cape Cross moved in and rescued two of the crewmen while the HH-3F rescued a third. The six survivors were taken to Gloucester Station and transferred to a local hospital.\n\nJanuary 11\n\n1755/57 Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and the \"father\" of the U.S. Coast Guard, was born on this day in either 1755 or 1757 in the town of Nevis, British West Indies.\n\n1882 At 0900 during a thick snowstorm, the schooner A .F. Ames of Rockland, Maine, was bound from Perth Amboy to Boston with a crew of seven persons. She stranded during a thick snowstorm five hundred yards east of Race Point and one mile and three-quarters west of Station No. 6, Second District. The vessel was discovered by the patrol and the life-saving crew boarded her at 0915. She was leaking and pounding heavily. The pumps were manned to keep the water down. The vessel was floated on the rising tide and made sail. She was piloted into deep water. The leak, however, was gaining rapidly. After consulting with the captain, the vessel was put on the beach. The crew was sheltered at the station until the 13th when the keeper sent them to Boston.\n\n1991 Coast Guard units responded after receiving a distress call from F/V Sea King, a 75-foot stern trawler with four persons on board that was taking on water and in danger of sinking off Peacock Spit near the mouth of the Columbia River. The Coast Guard units that responded included a prototype 47-foot MLB, two 44-foot MLBs, the 52-foot MLB CG-52314 Triumph II, and a Coast Guard helicopter. Despite valiant efforts to save the vessel, it capsized and sank. Three Coast Guardsmen who went aboard the vessel to assist were safely rescued from the water. Another, MK1 Charles Sexton, an emergency medical technician who went aboard the Sea King to assist an injured crewman, was pulled from the water but died 50 minutes after his arrival at a local hospital. MK1 Sexton was posthumously awarded the Coast Guard Medal.\n\nJanuary 12\n\n1850 The wreck of Ayrshire on occurred on Squan Beach, New Jersey on this date in 1850. All but one of the 202 persons on board were saved by a life car. This was the first recorded use of a life car in the U.S.\n\n1943 Coast Guardsmen participated in the landings at Amchitka, Alaska.\n\n1961 Two Coast Guard craft from the Cape Disappointment Lifeboat Station (LBS), CG-40564 and CG-36454, answered a call for assistance from the 38-foot crab boat Mermaid, with two crew on board, which had lost its rudder near the breakers off Peacock Spit. CG-40564 located the Mermaid and took her in tow. Due to adverse sea conditions the crew of CG-40564 requested the assistance of CG-52301 \"Triumph,\" stationed at Point Adams LBS, which took up the tow upon her arrival on scene. Heavy breakers capsized CG-40564 and battered the CG-36454, but the 36-foot motor lifeboat (MLB) stayed afloat. The crew of CG-36454 then located and rescued the crew of the CG-40564 and made for the Columbia River Lightship. The crew of the CG-36454 managed to deposit safely all on board the lightship before it too foundered. Soon thereafter, a heavy breaker hit Triumph which parted the tow line, set the Mermaid adrift, and capsized the Triumph. The crew of the Mermaid then rescued one of the six crewman on board Triumph. CG-36554 and CG-36535, also from the Point Adams LBS, then arrived on scene and CG-36535 took the Mermaid in tow. Another large breaker hit, snapping the CG-36535's tow line and sinking the Mermaid. CGC Yocona arrived on scene soon after Coast Guard aircraft UF 2G No. 1273 from Air Station Port Angeles and began searching for survivors. Other CG aircraft, including UF 2G 2131, UF 2G 1240, and HO 4S 1330, arrived and began dropping flares. Foot patrols from the life-boat stations searched the beaches as well and recovered one Coast Guard survivor. Ultimately five Coast Guard crewman, all from MLB CG-52301 Triumph, drowned, as did both of the Mermaid's crew.\n\n1963 CGC Tupelo, four Navy and one Ohio State Highway patrol helicopters, CG-44002D, three ice skiffs and crews from Marblehead Lifeboat Station, Sandusky Light Station, Lorain Lifeboat Station, and a panel truck from Toledo CG Moorings were dispatched to rescue 150 persons reported adrift on an ice floe off Reno Beach, Lake Erie, 10 miles east of Toledo, Ohio during a severe storm that had winds gusting to 40 knots. Four persons, also adrift, reached a breakwater off shore. Tupelo, using ship's boats, removed four persons from the breakwater and the panel truck crew passed a line to the ice floe and anchored it to the shore. All 150 persons were brought safely ashore without incident. The helicopters searched the surrounding area to ensure that no others were adrift. Commander Ninth Coast Guard District stated that the prompt action of all the commands and agencies involved averted a \"serious catastrophe and sent a 'Well Done' message to all participants.\"\n\n2009 CGC Boutwell departed Alameda, California, on an around-the-world cruise as part of the USS Boxer Expeditionary Strike Group.\n\n2010 A severe earthquake struck Haiti. CGCs Forward, Mohawk, and Tahoma were the first U.S. assets to arrive on scene at Port au Prince, with Forward arriving the morning of January 13, 2010 and Mohawk arriving in the afternoon. These units provided air traffic control for military aircraft, conducted damage assessments of the port, and ferried supplies and injured people with embarked boats and helicopters. Other Coast Guard assets began arriving soon thereafter to assist in the recovery efforts, including the CGC Oak and aircraft from AIRSTA Clearwater.\n\nJanuary 13\n\n1853 The ship Cornelius Grinnell grounded in a heavy surf off Squan Beach, New Jersey. A surf car was used to rescue safely all 234 persons on board.\n\n1925 Congress authorized the Coast Guard to assist in the enforcement of the Alaskan Game Law.\n\n1918 Surfmen from the Humboldt Bay Lifesaving Station rescued the 430-man crew of the Navy cruiser USS Milwaukee safely after the cruiser ran aground. Milwaukee had been attempting to pull a grounded submarine off of Samoa Beach, near Eureka, California, when she too ran aground and was a total loss.\n\n1982 Air Florida Flight 90 crashed onto the 14th Street Bridge and then into the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., during a heavy snow storm. Coast Guard units, including cutters Capstan and Madrona, divers from the Atlantic Strike Team, a helicopter from AIRSTA Elizabeth City, personnel from Curtis Bay, and reservists from Station Washington assisted in the rescue of the five surviving passengers and the recovery of the aircraft's wreckage. The plane crushed several cars on the bridge. All told seventy-four persons lost their lives.\n\nJanuary 14\n\n1886 RC Wolcott made the Revenue Marine's first drug seizure when a landing party seized 3,011 1/2 pounds of opium hidden at the Kaasan Bay Salmon Fishery, in Alaska. A detail of officers and crew from the Cutter had previously assisted Customs Inspectors with the seizure of 695 pounds of opium from vessel Idaho in Port Townsend. When a disgruntled crewman later provided intelligence about the additional opium stored at Kaasan Bay, RC Wolcott's crew ensued on a 695-mile race to beat Idaho to the concealed drugs, resulting in the RMS's first and largest-ever opium seizure. Hot on the Opium Smugglers' Trail | Naval History Magazine - October 2016 Volume 30, Number 5 (usni.org)\n\n1942 A Coast Guard aircraft, Hall PH-3 No. V-177, dropped food to a raft with six survivors of a torpedoed tanker in one of hundreds of such incidents carried out by Coast Guard aircraft during the war. This tanker had been the victim of a German U-boat attack off the coast of the United States.\n\n1985 Vice President George Bush made an official visit to Base Miami Beach to extend the thanks of the nation to those involved in Operation Hat Trick, an \"all-out\" effort to stop smugglers soon after they had left ports in Central and South America. The vice president decorated 15 Coast Guardsmen.\n\n2004 CGC Thetis rescued three shrimp fishermen from the fishing vessel Dona Nelly after they were in the water for 45 minutes after their vessel sank 15 miles off the coast of Brownsville, Texas.\n\nJanuary 15\n\n1836 A General Order from the Secretary of the Treasury prescribed that \"Blue cloth be substituted for the uniform dress of the officers of the Revenue Cutter Service, instead of grey…\" thereby ending a controversy that had brewed for years regarding the uniforms of the Service.\n\n1947 The first helicopter flight to the base \"Little America\" in Antarctica took place. The pilot was LT James A. Cornish, USCG and he carried Chief Photographer's Mate Everett Mashburn as his observer. They flew from CGC Northwind.\n\n1966 When winds of 30 to 50 knots hit the southern California coast, surface craft off the 11th Coast Guard District rendered assistance to six grounded vessels, three disabled sailboats, and three capsized vessels. They also responded to seven other distress cases. A Coast Guard helicopter played a prominent role in one of the cases by evacuating the five-man crew of the vessel Trilogy that had gone aground and broken up on Santa Cruz Island.\n\n1974 The first group of women ever enlisted as regulars in the Coast Guard began their 10-week basic training at the Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May. Thirty-two women were in the initial group and formed Recruit Company Sierra-89.\n\n1993 In response to a massive increase in the number of Haitians fleeing their country by sea that began in October 1991, President-elect William Clinton ordered the commencement of Operation Able Manner on this date in 1993. It was the largest SAR operation ever undertaken by the Coast Guard to that time. Twenty-nine cutters were initially involved, as were aircraft from 10 air stations and five US Navy vessels.\n\nJanuary 16\n\n1920 Prohibition, later called the \"noble experiment\" by President Herbert Hoover, became the law of the land on January 16, 1920, one year after the 36th state ratified the 18th Amendment to the Constitution. Enforcement of the law fell to the Department of the Treasury and the Coast Guard was charged with interdicting the flow of \"Demon Rum\" at sea before it reached American shores.\n\n1944 LT Stewart R. Graham became the first person to make a helicopter take-off and landing aboard a ship underway at sea when he piloted a Sikorsky HNS-1 off of and back on the SS Daghestan in the North Atlantic.\n\n1948 The list of nominations for appointments and promotions of Coast Guard officers transmitted to Congress by the President on this date represented the first permanent advancements of Coast Guard regular officers since the summer of 1942.\n\n1988 Coast Guard units responded to a report of a murder on board the container vessel Boxer Captain Cook. The ship's first officer reportedly murdered the captain and threw his body overboard. A boarding party from CGC Northland, offloaded onto CGC Cape York, boarded the vessel while it was underway on the high seas and captured the suspected murderer and collected evidence of the crime.\n\n1990 CGC Mellon fired a Harpoon anti-ship missile in a live-fire test, becoming the first cutter to fire the missile.\n\nJanuary 17\n\n1832 Treasury Secretary Louis McLane discontinued the practice of hiring unemployed Navy officers as senior Revenue Cutter Service officers. All vacancies from that point forward were to be filled by promotions from within the service. Secretary McLane's actions brought a tremendous boost to morale among Revenue cuttermen as they had long complained about the slow line of promotion caused by unemployed Navy officers \"grabbing up\" senior positions.\n\n1972 CGC Storis seized two Soviet fishing vessels, the 362-foot factory vessel Lamut and the 278-foot stern trawler Kolyvan, for fishing inside the 12-mile U.S. contiguous zone.\n\n1977 DOT Secretary William T. Coleman, Jr., issued licenses to LOOP, Inc., and Seadock, Inc., to own, construct, and operate deepwater ports in the Gulf of Mexico. Both ports were designed to \"handle\" supertankers.\n\n1994 Coast Guard units and family members assisted those in need after an earthquake hit Los Angeles, California.\n\nJanuary 18\n\n1884 USRC Dexter, under the command of CAPT Eric Gabrielson, came to the aid of the stricken steamer City of Columbus after it had grounded on the Devil's Bridge rock outcropping off Martha's Vineyard. The cutter maneuvered around the wreckage and launched its small boats to effect rescues. Second LT John U. Rhodes, First LT Warrington D. Roath, Third LT Charles D. Kennedy, and volunteers from the cutter's crew distinguished themselves in their rescue efforts. They worked in concert with lifeboats from the Massachusetts Humane Society's Gay Head station. All told 29 passengers and crew were saved out of 132 aboard City of Columbus. A local newspaper reported that the Dexter's \"…officers and crew, from the captain to the cabin boy, acted the part of heroes, both at the scene of the wreck and afterwards in caring for the survivors.\"\n\n1938 CGC Bibb returned to Norfolk after a 10-day post-trial run from Norfolk to the Virgin Islands and back again with the Commandant, RADM Russell R. Waesche, aboard. During the run Bibb went to the aid of the four-masted schooner Albert F. Paul, which had lost its topsails and was leaking badly. The Paul was taken in tow and Bibb proceeded under reduced speed. CGC Sebago was contacted by radio and relieved Bibb of the tow. During the cruise, \"constant communication was maintained between Bibb and Radio Station Fort Hunt, Virginia (NMH).\"\n\n1953 A Coast Guard PBM seaplane crashed off the Chinese coast near Swatow, China during takeoff after having rescued 11 survivors from a ditched U .S. Navy aircraft that had been shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft fire. A total of nine servicemen lost their lives in this second crash, including five of the Coast Guard aircrew. The survivors were later rescued by the USS Halsey Powell (DD-686). The entire Coast Guard PBM aircrew were awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal for their actions.\n\n1974 Coast Guard units rescued 61 crewmembers from the 551-foot tanker Keytrader and the 657-foot Norwegian freighter Baune after the two vessels collided on the night of January 18, 1974 in dense fog. Sixteen other crewmembers did not survive. Keytrader was carrying 18,000 tons of fuel oil. A 53-foot Coast Guard vessel assisted in fighting the ensuing fire.\n\n2003 On January 18th, CGC Walnut departed from her homeport in Honolulu, Hawaii and began her 10,000 mile transit to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This 45-day transit was completed as quickly as possible with brief stops for fuel and food along the way in Guam, Singapore, and Kuwait. The cutter deployed with an oil spill recovery system in the event the regime of Saddam Hussein committed any acts of environmental terrorism. When those threats did not materialize, the cutter then conducted maritime interception operations enforcing U.N. Security Council resolutions, participated in the search for two downed United Kingdom helicopters, and patrolled and provided assistance to captured Iraqi offshore oil terminals being secured by Coast Guard port security personnel. The cutter’s crew completely replaced 30 buoys and repaired an additional five along the 41-mile Khawr Abd Allah Waterway. This ATON mission vastly improved the navigational safety of the waterway for humanitarian aid, commercial, and military vessels sailing to the port and was a critical step to economic recovery for the people of Iraq.\n\nJanuary 19\n\n1935 Chief Warrant Gunner and Naval Aviation Pilot (CWO-GUN; NAP) Charles T. Thrun, USCG, Coast Guard Aviator Number 3, was killed when his Grumman JF-2 Duck crashed at Cape May. CWO Thrun was the first Coast Guard aviator to die in the line of duty.\n\n1937 Coast Guard units began flood relief operations in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys. These operations lasted until March 11th and resulted in the rescue of hundreds of victims and thousands of farm animals.\n\n1946 Staged jointly by the Coast Guard and the Navy, the first public demonstration of LORAN was held at Floyd Bennett Field in New York.\n\n1949 The tanker Gulfstream collided with icebreaker CGC Eastwind. The collision and resulting fire killed 13 of Eastwind's crew, nine of whom were chief petty officers.\n\n1969 CGC Absecon, while on ocean station duty, was directed to assist the sinking M/V Ocean Sprinter. Absecon launched a small boat and rescued all of the merchant vessel's crew. The five Coast Guardsmen manning the small boat received the Coast Guard Medal for their actions.\n\n1977 The Coast Guard accepted delivery of CGC Polar Sea from Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company, Seattle, Washington. Polar Sea was placed \"In Commission, Special\" on January 31, 1977 under the command of CAPT Richard Cueroni.\n\n1996 The tug Scandia and its barge, the North Cape, ran aground on the shore of Rhode Island, spilling 828,000 gallons of oil. This was the worst spill in that state's history. The Coast Guard rescued the entire crew, pumped off 1.5 million gallons of oil and conducted skimming operations.\n\nJanuary 20\n\n1914 The International Ice Patrol Convention was signed.\n\n1915 Congress passed the \"Act to Create the Coast Guard\" on this date in 1915 (38 Stat. L., 800). The act combined the Life-Saving Service and Revenue Cutter Service to form the Coast Guard. President Woodrow Wilson signed the act on January 28, 1915.\n\n1961 During his inaugural parade, President John F. Kennedy noticed that there were no African-Americans in the Coast Guard Academy cadet unit marching in the parade. He told his speechwriter, Richard Goodwin, \"That's not acceptable. Something ought to be done about it. Goodwin called Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon the next day and Dillon ordered the Academy \"to scrutinize the Academy's recruitment policy to make sure it did not discriminate against blacks.\"\n\n1984 Coast Guard units responded to a six-alarm fire along Boston's waterfront. The fire began early on the morning of January 20th on the Boston and Maine Railroad Bridge directly behind Boston Garden and North Station. The Boston Fire Department requested Coast Guard assistance and MSO Boston coordinated the response. Small boats from Station Boston responded while personnel from ATON Team Boston, Support Center Boston, Point Allerton Station, and CGCs Pendant, Chase, White Heath, Nantucket I, and Nantucket II also assisted.\n\nJanuary 21\n\n1863 Appended to Circular to Collectors, January 21, 1863: \"Sir: The question submitted by you [J. Lawrence Boggs, Collector at Perth Amboy, N.J.], whether free colored men are citizens of the United States, and competent therefore to command vessels engaged in our coasting trade, has been submitted to the Attorney General for his opinion, of which the concluding sentence is as follows: 'And now, upon the whole matter, I give it as my opinion, that the free man of color mentioned in your letter, if born in the United States, is a citizen of the United States, and, if otherwise qualified, is competent, according to acts of Congress, to be a master of a vessel engaged in the coasting trade.' You will advise the Commander of the Revenue Cutter 'Tiger' of this decision of the Attorney General, and direct him to conform to it in all future examinations of vessels engaged in the coasting trade. With great respect, Salmon P. Chase, Secretary.\"\n\n1881 The light was first shown at Tillamook Lighthouse, located 19 miles south of the Columbia River entrance.\n\n1969 CGC Point Banks, while on patrol south of Cam Rahn Bay, received a call for assistance from a nine-man South Vietnamese (ARVN) detachment trapped by two Vietcong platoons. Petty Officers Willis Goff and Larry Villareal took a 14-foot Boston whaler ashore to rescue the ARVN troops. In the face of heavy automatic weapons fire all nine men were evacuated in two trips. For their actions Goff and Villareal were each awarded the Silver Star. The citation stated, \"The nine men would have met almost certain death or capture without the assistance of the two Coast Guardsmen.\"\n\n1982 \"Streamlining\" plans were put into place when the Commandant, ADM John B. Hayes, announced in ALCOAST 002/82 his plans to consolidate some operations and streamline others to comply with President Ronald Reagan's goals of \"greater efficiency in federal spending\" and in accordance with Congressional appropriation levels. The service eliminated 35 units, including the West Coast Training Center at Alameda, and consolidated all recruit training to TRACEN Cape May.\n\n1984 The tanker Cepheus ran aground near Anchorage, Alaska, on the morning of January 21, 1984, spilling 180,000 gallons of jet fuel into Cook Inlet. MSO Anchorage and the Pacific Strike Team responded to the incident and monitored the offloading of the damaged tanker and cleared its passage out of Alaska. The light jet fuel evaporated with little environmental impact.\n\nJanuary 22\n\n1944 Coast Guardsmen participated in Operation Shingle – the landings at Anzio-Nettuno, Italy. Coast Guard units involved were USS PC-545 and LSTs 16, 326, 327, and 381.\n\n1987 The Coast Guard established the Air Interdiction Facility at Norfolk Naval Air Station. The aircrews flew two loaned Navy E-2C Hawkeye aircraft on narcotics interdiction patrols.\n\nJanuary 23\n\n1909 The schooner Roderick Dhu was discovered in distress on the bar by a Life-Saving Service patrol from the Point Bonita, California station. The schooner had been in tow by a tug, but parted hawsers when 5-1/2 miles SW of a LSS station. She hoisted a signal, and the keeper reported her condition to the Merchant's Exchange. A tug was sent out and the schooner was towed to sea. The next day she was towed into port, leaking badly, and convoyed by the USRC McCulloch.\n\nJanuary 24\n\n1968 Seifu Maru, a Japanese refrigerator vessel, reported a fire and requested clearance to enter Dutch Harbor, Alaska to combat it. They also reported that two crewmembers had been overcome by smoke and requested their evacuation for hospital treatment. Clearance was granted and CGC Citrus was ordered to proceed and assist in fighting the fire. The burning ship arrived in Dutch Harbor and advised that the fire was raging between the decks. Fire fighting parties from Citrus began assisting the crew of the Japanese vessel. Coast Guard aircraft evacuated three patients from Seifu Maru to Kodiak for hospitalization. The fire assistance rendered by Citrus in a four-day operation saved the Japanese vessel.\n\n1984 MSO Memphis responded to what appeared to be a routine grounding when three barges being towed down river by the M/V Karman P. broke away 40 miles south of Memphis. Initial reports passed to MSO Memphis by way of Group Lower Mississippi River said the tank barge APEX-3506, with one million gallons of slurry-grade number six oil had grounded with \"no damage and no pollution.\" After a boarding team arrived and found the barge sinking and having no means to lighter the cargo, they called in the Gulf Strike Team. Eventually, through the efforts of MSO Memphis, Gulf Strike Team, Atlantic Strike Team, National Strike Force Dive Team, and the Navy Superintendent of Salvage, as well as a private salvage firm, the barge's cargo was lightered and the barge itself saved.\n\nJanuary 25\n\n1799 Having existed essentially nameless for 8-1/2 years, Alexander Hamilton's \"system of cutters\" was referred to in legislation as \"Revenue Cutters.\" Some decades later, the name evolved to Revenue Cutter Service and Revenue Marine.\n\n1940 The ocean station program was formally established on this date under orders from President Franklin Roosevelt. The Coast Guard, in cooperation with the U. S. Weather Service, was given responsibility for its establishment and operation. The program was first known as the Atlantic Weather Observation Service and later by thousands of Coast Guardsmen who served after World War II as the \"Ocean Station\" (OS) program. Cutters were dispatched for 30-day patrols to transmit weather observations and serve as a SAR standby for transoceanic aircraft. The program ended in the 1970s.\n\n2004 A helicopter crew from AIRSTA Detroit helped rescue 14 people stranded on an ice floe about one mile west of Catawba Island, Ohio.\n\nJanuary 26\n\n1939 Ground was broken for the construction of an air station at Elizabeth City, North Carolina. With the support of Congressman Lindsay Warren and a favorable vote by local county and city officials regarding a bond issue, the land was secured for the new facility which was constructed by the WPA.\n\n1953 Coast Guard forces assisted civilian authorities in evacuating 191 persons from the Coxuille Valley flood area.\n\n1963 The modern Canadian Coast Guard was founded on this date. Their official motto is Saluti Primum, Auxilio Semper (Safety First, Service Always).\n\n1991 Upon receiving a request from the Saudi government, the Bush Administration determined that the Coast Guard would head an interagency team to assist the Saudi government in an oil spill assessment and plan for a clean-up operation after an intentional Iraqi oil spill.\n\n1990 Coast Guard Air Station St. Augustine, home of CGAW-1, was formally commissioned. The Navy loaned E2Cs to the Coast Guard for use in the efforts by CGAW-1 to track drug shipments by radar. One E2C, #3501, crashed during a landing at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, on August 24, 1990 and all four crewmen on board were killed. CGAW-1 was disbanded soon thereafter and the remaining E2Cs were returned to the Navy.\n\nJanuary 27\n\n1909 The schooner Nelson Y. McFarland issued a distress call after dropping anchor near the White Head, Maine, Life-Saving Service station. Although anchored against the tide, she was becalmed, yet her stern swung so close to the ledge that \"a change of wind or tide would have thrown the vessel upon the rocks. A pulling boat and crew from the station responded to the call and the men rowed to the ship's aid. After a 3-hour, pull the surfmen succeeded in towing the schooner to a safe anchorage in Seal Harbor.\"\n\n1993 Communications Station Guam received a mayday broadcast from the M/V East Wood. The ship's radio operator claimed that the vessel had been taken over by hijackers and that there were 400 people in the vessel's two main cargo holds. Another transmission claimed that 10 persons were going to be thrown overboard. The Coast Guard dispatched an HC-130 from AIRSTA Barbers Point and ordered CGC Rush to intercept. A boarding team from the Rush seized the vessel and escorted it to an Army installation on the Marshall Islands. There were 527 Chinese nationals and 10 crewmembers aboard. The Chinese nationals were repatriated to China and nine of the crewmen were sent to Indonesia. The 10th crewman was taken to Honolulu to investigate whether prosecution was possible under U.S. law.\n\nJanuary 28\n\n1885 Keeper Marcus Hanna of the Cape Elizabeth Light Station saved two men from the wrecked schooner Australia. For this rescue Hanna was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Port Hudson in 1863. He is the only person to have ever received both awards.\n\n1915 President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the \"Act to Create the Coast Guard,\" an act passed by Congress on January 20, 1915 that combined the Life-Saving Service and Revenue Cutter Service to form the Coast Guard (38 Stat. L., 800). The Coast Guard, however, still considers the date of the founding of the Revenue Cutter Service, August 4, 1790, as its official birthday, even though the Lighthouse Service, absorbed in 1939, is even older than that, dating to August 7, 1789. Under the new law the Coast Guard officially became \"part of the regular military establishment of the United States.\"\n\n1980 CGC Blackthorn sank in Tampa Bay after colliding with the tanker Capricorn. Twenty-three Coast Guard personnel were killed in the tragedy.\n\n1986 NASA's space shuttle Challenger exploded after lift-off, killing the entire crew. Coast Guard units, including the cutters Dallas, Dauntless, Harriet Lane, Bear, Tampa, Cherokee, Sweetgum, and Point Roberts conducted the initial search and rescue operations and later assisted in the recovery of much of the shuttle's wreckage. Other units included personnel from Station Port Canaveral, air stations Miami, Clearwater, and Savannah, as well as Coast Guard reservists and Auxiliarists. Dallas served as the on-scene commander for what was a joint Coast Guard, NASA, Navy, and Air Force search and recovery operation.\n\n2003 DOD submitted a request for Coast Guard forces in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Commandant, ADM Thomas Collins, approved that request and ordered the deployment of eight 110-foot patrol boats, crews, and support units. The cutters were CGCs: Wrangell, Adak, Aquidneck, Baranof, Grand Isle, Bainbridge Island, Pea Island, and Knight Island.\n\nJanuary 29\n\n1919 Ratification of the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution occurred on this date. The amendment prohibited the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. Its enforcement was authorized by the National Prohibition Enforcement Act, otherwise known as the Volstead Act that was passed on October 28, 1919. The Coast Guard was tasked with the prevention of the maritime importation of illegal alcohol. This led to the largest increase in the size and responsibilities of the service to date.\n\n1938 CGC Bibb reported for duty in connection with the U.S. Navy exercises held off Culebra, Puerto Rico.\n\n1945 The Coast Guard-manned attack cargo vessel USS Serpens exploded off Guadalcanal due to unknown causes. Only two men aboard survived. This was the single greatest Coast Guard loss of life in history.\n\n1963 CGC Casco inaugurated the expanded Ocean Station Vessel Oceanographic Program when it departed for Ocean Station Echo on this date. Casco was outfitted for oceanographic research by the addition of a laboratory space, hydrographic winch, and other instruments. As the first Coast Guard Ocean Station Vessel to be so outfitted, Casco's mission represented \"a significant step on the Coast Guard's participation in the National Oceanographic effort.\"\n\n1980 Local authorities in the Tijuana, Mexico area requested Coast Guard assistance in evacuating flood victims stranded by the rising waters of the San Miguel River. Two HH-3F helicopters from Air Station San Diego transported 180 persons to safety during the two-day operation.\n\nJanuary 30\n\n1861 Treasury Secretary John A. Dix ordered LT S. B. Caldwell, the second in command of the cutter McClelland, \"to arrest Capt. Breshwood [the cutter's commanding officer and a Confederate sympathizer] assume command of cutter and if anyone attempts to haul down the flag, shoot him on the spot.\" The message was not delivered by the telegraph office. Breshwood turned McClelland over to the State of Louisiana, where the cutter ended up in Confederate service. The northern papers reported the story though and the Secretary's order became a rallying cry in support of the Union's war effort.\n\n1942 The capsized wreck of CGC Alexander Hamilton was sunk by the Navy after U-132 torpedoed the cutter off the coast of Iceland the previous day. She was the first cutter sunk by enemy action during World War II. Twenty-six of her crew perished in the attack.\n\n1942 USS Wakefield, the former passenger liner SS Manhattan converted to a troop transport and manned by a Coast Guard crew, transported British troops to Singapore. Having disembarked the troops, she was bombed by Japanese aircraft while still tied up. Five of her Coast Guard crew were killed and nine were wounded. After temporary repairs, Wakefield evacuated 500 women and children to Bombay before the port fell to the Japanese\n\n1979 There was an explosion at the Coast Guard Marine Safety Detachment office at Ponce Playa, Port Ponce, Puerto Rico. The OVPR (Organizacion De Voluntarios Por La Revelucion Puerto Riquena) claimed responsibility. The terrorist attack caused no casualties and little damage to the facility.\n\n1982 Coast Guard 8th District units responded to the flooding of the Calcasieu River near Lake Charles, Louisiana. Up river Coast Guard boats searched daily for stranded people and domestic animals. Downriver COTP Port Arthur and Marine Safety Detachment Lake Charles wrestled with the problem of strong currents and four run-away barges that destroyed one bridge and threatened two others.\n\nJanuary 31\n\n1942 HMS Culver (ex-CGC Mendota – one of the \"Lake\" Class cutters transferred to the Royal Navy in 1941 under the Lend-Lease program) was torpedoed and sunk with only 13 survivors.\n\n1948 Mrs. Fannie M. Salter, keeper of the Turkey Point Lighthouse in upper Chesapeake Bay since 1925 and the last woman keeper of a lighthouse in the United States, retired from active service. The first woman had been hired as a lighthouse keeper 150 years before. Salter's retirement temporarily closed the tradition of women serving as keepers at lighthouses.\n\n1968 Coast Guard SPAR Chief Storekeeper Mary Ashley Rose retired \"after a career of more than 20 years of service in the Coast Guard. Chief Rose is the first enlisted woman to retire from active duty in the Coast Guard.\"\n\n1975 CGC Vigorous (WMEC-627) became the first cutter to make a seizure of a foreign-flag fishing vessel in the high seas when she seized the Italian fishing vessel Tontini Pesca Cuarto for illegally taking lobster. All of the other fishery seizures prior to this were of vessels that had violated territorial seas (TS) or Contiguous Fishing Zone (CFZ). At the time, Vigorous was under the command of CDR Paul Welling, USCG. The arresting officer was ENS S.T. Fuger, Jr., USCG.\n\n2000 Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed off the coast of California near the Channel Islands, killing all 88 on board. Coast Guard Channel Island Station crewmen responded to the tragedy.\n\n2004 The crews of a 47-foot MLB from Station Chincoteague and a rescue helicopter from Air Station Elizabeth City combined to rescue five men after their vessel began taking on water 25 miles east of Chincoteague.\n\nFebruary 1\n\n1871 Using his administrative authority, Secretary of the Treasury George S. Boutwell re-established a Revenue Marine Bureau within the Department and assigned Sumner I. Kimball as the civilian Chief. Kimball's duties included administering both the revenue cutters, which were then under the control of the local Collectors, and the life-saving stations.\n\n1938 The Lighthouse Service Radio Laboratory was moved from the shops of the lighthouse depot in Detroit, Michigan, \"to the Lazaretto Lighthouse Depot in Baltimore, Md., where a building had been constructed providing more adequately for this important branch of the work of the Service.\"\n\n1942 Enlistees after this date were restricted to enlistment in the Coast Guard Reserve. This was done to prevent having too many regulars in the service at the end of World War II.\n\n1944 Coast Guardsmen participated in the invasion of Namur Island, Kwajalein Atoll.\n\n1963 The Coast Guard's \"newest\" helicopter, the Sikorsky HH-52, performed its first rescue. On February1, 1963, the F/V Enterprize sank after colliding with ice off Hyannis, Massachusetts. The two crewman of the vessel abandoned and sought safety on the ice. After a 63-mile flight, 56 of which were over water at night, the aircraft commander, LT R. A. Johannsen, landed the HH-52A (CG-1352) on the ice and made the rescue.\n\nFebruary 2\n\n1944 Coast Guardsmen participated in the landings at Saidor, New Guinea.\n\n2014 The Coast Guard and Navy completed a joint mission in the Central and South Pacific under an agreement between the services to enforce fisheries laws and enhance regional security January 7 to February 2, 2014. The partnership supported the Oceania Maritime Security Initiative, a Secretary of Defense program, which leverages Department of Defense assets transiting the region to increase the Coast Guard's maritime domain awareness, ultimately supporting its maritime law enforcement operations in Oceania. As part of Operation Persistent Presence and in conjunction with NOAA, a Coast Guard law enforcement team embarked the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Kidd in San Diego to conduct law enforcement boardings while the vessel was in transit. The Coast Guard-Navy team, including the two embarked MH-60R helicopters from Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 78, conducted 46 external visual inspections, and 13 boardings with internal inspections of fishing vessels across two separate jurisdictional areas in the Marshall Islands and Nauru exclusive economic zones.\n\nFebruary 3\n\n1801 Treaty of peace with France was ratified on this date, thereby ending the \"Quasi-War,\" in which cutters of the Revenue Marine had rendered valiant service.\n\n1880 Date of a terrific gale on the New Jersey coast. Six vessels came ashore with 47 persons on board; all but two survived. Nineteen Life-Saving Service crewmen were awarded Gold Life-Saving Medals during the rescue of the persons aboard the wrecked George Taulane.\n\n1943 A U-boat torpedoed the transport USS Dorchester off the coast of Greenland. Two of her escorts, CGCs Comanche and Escanaba, responded. The crew of Escanaba used a new rescue technique when pulling survivors from the water. This \"retriever\" technique used swimmers clad in wet suits to swim to victims in the water and secure a line to them so they could then be hauled onto the ship. Although Escanaba saved 133 men (one later died) and Comanche saved 97, over 600 men were lost, including the famous \"Four Chaplains\" who gave up their lifejackets to those that did not have one and all four went down with the ship.\n\n1976 The Coast Guard Academy first announced the appointments of 50 cadets to enter with the Class of 1980, including three women: Cathryn Lis of Bristol, Connecticut; Susan Kollmeyer of Groton, Connecticut; & Cynthia Snead of Melbourne, Florida. The Coast Guard News Release published on February 4, 1976 regarding their announcement noted that: “Of the four largest federal service academies (Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard) the Coast Guard Academy is the first to offer an appointment to a woman.” (USCG News Release No. 7-76; 4 February 1976).\n\n1997 The 660-foot freighter Contship Houston ran aground on a coral reef 12 miles southeast of Key West in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The vessel, under Coast Guard supervision, was safely floated off the reef some 144 hours later.\n\nFebruary 4\n\n1859 The United States signed the \"Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation\" with Paraguay at Asuncion after the revenue cutter Harriet Lane, as part of a U.S. Navy expedition, forced the opening of the Paraguay and Parana Rivers.\n\n1863 Commissioned officers of the Revenue Cutter Service were to be appointed by the President by and with advice and consent of the Senate. This act contained the first statutory use of term \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Previous laws referred only to \"revenue cutters\".\n\n1881 Keeper Ida Lewis, the head keeper of the Lime Rock Lighthouse, rescued two soldiers from Fort Adams who had fallen through the ice \"at the imminent risk of Mrs. Lewis-Wilson's life.\" For her heroic actions she was awarded a Gold Lifesaving Medal. She was officially credited with saving 13 persons during her distinguished career with the U.S. Lighthouse Service \"and it is understood that the number was probably much greater.\"\n\n1982 Attorney General William Smith declared at a press conference that Operation Tiburon was \"the most successful international marijuana interdiction effort to date.\" The operation began in November 1980, and accounted for the seizure of 95 vessels. It was a combined operation that included elements of the Coast Guard, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs Service, and various state and local law enforcement agencies.\n\n1999 The 639-foot freighter New Carissa ran aground north of Coos Bay, Oregon. Coast Guard helicopter crews rescued 23 crewmembers, but the vessel remained firmly aground and attempts to refloat her failed. A unified command made up of Coast Guard and Navy personnel, as well as marine salvors, attempted to prevent a catastrophic oil spill as the ship began breaking apart. The team decided to set the oil on board the New Carissa on fire so it would burn away before being spilled and fouling the shore. It was the largest \"in situ\" burn ever tried in U.S. waters and it consumed a significant amount of the oil aboard the New Carissa. The Coast Guard's annual report for that year noted: \"While some oil did spill out of the vessel, the unified command's efforts greatly reduced the potential environmental damage to the Oregon coast.\" The ship eventually broke in two and her bow section was towed to sea and sunk by the Navy.\n\n2014 CGC Diligence returned to its homeport of Wilmington, North Carolina, after completing a 49-day patrol in the North Atlantic Ocean in support of Operation Atlantic Venture. The combined efforts of Diligence and the other Coast Guard assets involved in the operation resulted in nearly 75 vessel inspections that identified numerous violations of federal safety and fisheries regulations.\n\nFebruary 5\n\n1882 The schooner Mary L. Vankirk, bound for Philadelphian from South Creek, Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, carrying a crew of five men, encountered heavy weather. She lost sails and sprung a leak and before long she became water-logged and almost unmanageable. In this condition, it was determined to run to leeward and seek refuge in Hatteras Inlet. Matters, however, became worse and it was decided to beach the vessel. She was discovered heading for the land by the crew of Station No. 18, Sixth District (Chicamicomico, North Carolina). The surfboat was run out, but the life-saving crew returned to the station for the breeches-buoy apparatus. The latter arrived abreast of the schooner at 8:15, fifteen minutes after she struck the bar about half a mile north of the station. The schooner was so close that the keeper was able to wade out into the water and cast a heaving-line to those huddled in the rigging. As quickly as possible, the men in the rigging hauled off the whip-line. The breeches-buoy was soon rigged and went spinning out to the vessel. All five men were safely landed.\n\n1946 Four Coast Guardsmen from Willapa Harbor Lifeboat Station perished in the line of duty while searching for two crab fishermen feared lost in Williapa Bay. The men were: BMC Joseph W. Miller, USCG; MM 1/c Geloyd J. Simmons, USCG; Coxswain James R. Graves, USCG; S 1/c Howard W. Hampton, USCG.\n\n1973 The position of Senior Coast Guard Officer-Vietnam (SCGOV) was disestablished.\n\n1975 The Coast Guard commissioned the Houston-Galveston Vessel Traffic System, the third VTS to be \"implemented by the Coast Guard on a major waterway of the U.S.\"\n\nFebruary 6\n\n1893 Secretary of Treasury was authorized to define and establish anchorage grounds for vessels in harbor of Chicago and adjacent waters of Lake Michigan.\n\n1942 CGC Nike rescued 38 persons from SS China Arrow which had been torpedoed off Ocean City, Maryland.\n\n1978 Coast Guard units from the First and Third Districts responded to a severe winter storm in New England, including stations providing shelter to displaced families and Coast Guard four-wheel drive vehicles serving as ambulances while an amphibious vehicle was the only means of transportation from the mainland from Sandy Hook, New Jersey, transporting nine people to safety from flooded areas. A 682-foot tanker Global Hope went aground in Salem Sound, Massachusetts, and an HH-3F from Air Station Cape Cod arrived on scene followed by CGC Decisive which removed 28 of the 32 persons on board, with four left aboard to assist in salvage and pollution control.\n\n1990 Two Coast Guard Air Station Houston crews were the first to receive the Igor I. Sikorsky Award for Humanitarian Service. The award was presented by the Helicopter Association International at their Dallas convention. The crews were honored for their rescue of seven fishermen during Hurricane Chantal last year. They flew through driving rain, winds in excess of 65 miles per hour, thunderstorms, and squalls to rescue the men from their capsized boat.\n\n1996 Alas Nacionales Airlines Flight 301 crashed off the Dominican Republic and Coast Guard units conducted search and rescue operations.\n\n1996 Coast Guard units responded to calls of assistance due to severe flooding throughout the Pacific Northwest.\n\nFebruary 7\n\n1914 Pursuant to the Convention for Safety at Sea in London, President Woodrow Wilson directed that the Revenue Cutter Service undertake the task of manning the International Ice Patrol. Henceforth, the Revenue Cutter Service and then the Coast Guard, with brief respites during both World Wars, served in this capacity, a traditional mission still undertaken to this day.\n\n1942 Presidential order created the War Shipping Administration (WSA). The WSA assumed control over all phases of merchant marine activities, including training, which the Coast Guard had been conducting since 1938.\n\n1943 During a fierce convoy battle near Greenland, CGC Ingham rescued 33 survivors from the torpedoed troopship SS Henry Mallory, while CGC Bibb rescued 202. Bibb then rescued 33 from the torpedoed SS Kalliopi.\n\n1969 CGC Tern, commissioned on this date and stationed in New York, embodied an advanced concept in servicing aids to navigation. Her over-the-stern gantry system of handling buoys was unique. The automation and modernization of over-age, isolated lighthouses and light stations showed significant progress this year. A new, more effective version of the LAMP (Lighthouse Automation and Modernization Project) plan was promulgated in this year as well.\n\n1980 CGC Cape Horn saved all six crewmen of the F/V Hattie Rose in a dramatic night-time rescue. The Hattie Rose, a Gloucester-based 75-foot stern trawler, began taking on water in 25-foot seas and 45-knot winds, 15 miles east of Provincetown. Sea and wind conditions prevented a rescue by air and so the Cape Horn, under the command of LTJG William L. Ross, and 11 crewmen, diverted from one SAR case to go to the Hattie Rose's assistance. The F/V Paul and Dominic, standing nearby the stricken vessel, helped direct the cutter to the area. The Cape Horn's crew got a line to the men, now standing on the bow which was still afloat, and pulled four of the crew to safety aboard the cutter. The line parted, however, and the two remaining fishermen began drifting away, but two of the Cape Horn's crew, Duncan Grant and Thomas Jennings, leaped into the 35-degree water and secured a line around the two. They were all then hauled safely aboard.\n\nFebruary 8\n\n1958 A U.S. Navy P5M aircraft enroute from San Juan to Norfolk lost one engine and changed course to the island of San Salvador, British West Indies, to attempt a night ditching. AIRSTA Miami sent up a Coast Guard UF amphibian plane, later reinforced by a second amphibian. After contacting the disabled Navy plane, the pilot of the first amphibian talked the Navy pilot out of attempting to ditch without benefit of illumination and alerted the commanding officer of the Coast Guard LORAN station on San Salvador for assistance after ditching. In true Coast Guard tradition, the LORAN station's CO borrowed a truck and an 18-foot boat to assist. The commanding officer managed to be on the scene 1-1/2 miles offshore, when the Navy P5M landed with two minutes of fuel remaining. While one of the amphibians provided additional illumination, the Navy plane was guided through a dangerous reef to a mooring, using her operative port engine. There were no casualties.\n\n2007 CGC Storis was decommissioned after 64 years of service.\n\n2015 CGC Alex Haley returned to Kodiak, Alaska, following a successful 70-day deployment patrolling more than 10,800 miles throughout the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. Alex Haley, known as the “Bulldog of the Bering,” departed Kodiak on December 1, 2014 and spent 70 days conducting law enforcement and community outreach operations in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. During the deployment, Alex Haley’s crew performed 41 at sea domestic fisheries enforcement boardings and covered more than 5,000 square miles in search efforts for the sunken Korean fishing vessel 501 Oryong.\n\nFebruary 9\n\n1938 Chief Boatswain (L) John Allen Midgett, Commanding Officer of Station Chicamacomico, died in the U.S. Marine Hospital in Norfolk, VA, from injuries he sustained in an automobile accident on January 23, 1938. Chief Midgett was the hero of the 1918 Mirlo rescue for which he was awarded a Gold Lifesaving Medal.\n\n1965 A commercial DC-7 with 84 persons on board exploded in midair off Jones Beach, Long Island. Despite an extensive search by seven Coast Guard cutters, six Coast Guard aircraft, and a U.S. Navy tug, no survivors were located. Only nine bodies and various pieces of debris were located and recovered.\n\n1968 Coast Guard cutters Androscoggin, Minnetonka, and Winona, along with 82-footers and Navy assets, on patrol in Vietnamese waters, thwarted a Communist attempt to run four trawlers through the Market Time blockade off the coast of South Vietnam. The cutters sank three of the trawlers and forced the fourth to return to Hainan Island without landing her cargo. The defeat of this attempted re-supply was hailed as \"the most significant naval victory of the Vietnam campaign.\"\n\n2010 CGC Alex Haley rescued a 28-member crew from the disabled fishing vessel Hou Chun 11 900 miles southwest of Honolulu. Corpsmen aboard the cutter treated two of the crewmembers who suffered severe burns. The crew of the cutter Alex Haley sailed to Christmas Island, Kiribati, where the two burn victims were medevaced by a Coast Guard HC-130 Hercules based out of AIRSTA Barbers Point. The remaining 26 were transported ashore for transport to a vessel that returned them to Taiwan.\n\nFebruary 10\n\n1840 A House resolution was introduced to inquire into transferring the Revenue Marine to the Navy.\n\n1938 CGC Tahoe departed New Bedford, Massachusetts, to inaugurate the 1938 \"International Ice Observation Service\" (now referred to as the International Ice Patrol).\n\n1940 CGCs Bibb and Duane inaugurated the Coast Guard's participation in the nation's manned ocean station program when they took their positions on Ocean Stations No. 1 and 2 in the North Atlantic on this date. They also became the first vessels to make radio transmissions as \"weather stations.\"\n\n1992 Retired Coast Guard Chief Journalist Alex Haley, internationally noted author, crossed the bar.\n\n1995 The 689-foot tank ship Mormac Star, carrying more than 4.7 million gallons of Jet A fuel and nearly 5.7 million gallons of number 2 diesel fuel, ran aground in Sandy Hook Channel, two miles off the beaches of Sandy Hook, New Jersey, spilling 33,600 gallons. COTP New York responded. Other responding units included Stations New York and Sandy Hook, VTS New York, and the Atlantic Area Strike Team. The spill was successfully contained and the vessel salvaged.\n\nFebruary 11\n\n1973 Due to the draw-down of U.S. forces in South Vietnam the post of Senior Coast Guard Officer, Vietnam, was discontinued.\n\n2009 Miami-based LEDET 405, operating as part of Combined Task Force (CTF) 151 and conducting counter-piracy operations aboard USS Vella Gulf (CG-72) and USS Mahan (DDG-72) in the Gulf of Aden, assisted in the apprehension of 16 suspected pirates in a 24-hour period.\n\n2014 The Coast Guard awarded three firm fixed-price contracts for preliminary and contract design for the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) acquisition project. The contracts were awarded to Bollinger Shipyards Lockport LLC (Lockport, Louisiana), Eastern Shipbuilding Group Inc. (Panama City, Florida), and General Dynamics, Bath Iron Works (Bath, Maine). The OPC would fill Coast Guard and DHS offshore mission requirements and provide capabilities between the Coast Guard’s Fast Response Cutter and National Security Cutter, while replacing the aging 210-foot and 270-foot medium endurance cutters.\n\n2015 CGC Valiant returned home to Naval Station Mayport Wednesday, after completing a six-week deployment in the Florida Straits and Eastern Caribbean Sea in support of operations Southeast Watch and Unified Resolve. Valiant responded to a surge of illegal migration attempts in the Florida Straits following the U.S. government announcement to normalize relations with Cuba. The cutter humanely processed and cared for 160 Cuban migrants in a one-week period. Valiant also boarded and towed a coastal freighter following its failed attempt to deliver more than 1,000 kilograms of cocaine into Puerto Rico. Valiant’s crewmembers conducted a search of the vessel, took custody of its crew, and towed the freighter over 120 miles to Ponce, Puerto Rico, where it was transferred to Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol authorities. The freighter’s crew was turned over for prosecution in federal court. During the cutter’s logistics stop in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the crew took time to visit two orphanages that care for infants and primary school children. The crew distributed more than 200 new toys they brought with them from Mayport and spent two afternoons playing with the children.\n\nFebruary 12\n\n1802 Revenue Marine had a total of 38 commissioned officers in service: 9 captains, 10 first mates, 9 second mates and 10 third mates.\n\n1983 The 605-foot collier Marine Electric capsized and sank off Virginia during a gale. Three of the 34 crewmen on board were rescued by Coast Guard and Navy assets. This sinking and consequent loss of life contributed to the establishment of a permanent rescue swimmer program for the Coast Guard.\n\n1986 Rains began in northern California that lasted for a week, causing severe flooding. Coast Guard units participated in rescue and relief operations.\n\n1997 Three of the four crewmembers of MLB-44363 out of the Quillayute River Motor Lifeboat Station were lost in the line of duty when they responded to a distress call from the sailing vessel Gale Runner. They were BM2 David A. Bosley, MK3 Matthew E. Schlimme, and SN Clinton P. Miniken.\n\nFebruary 13\n\n1960 A Coast Guard R5D aircraft from Honolulu dropped a pump to the Japanese training vessel Toyama Maru, which had radioed that it was taking on water and was in danger of sinking off Palmyra Island. The pump controlled flooding until the arrival of CGC Bering Strait, whose crew made repairs to the Japanese vessel, using 2,500 pounds of sand and cement parachuted by a Honolulu-based SC-130B plane.\n\n1963 The Bureau of Customs requested Coast Guard assistance to search the M/V Holland Diepe in Tacoma, Washington, for narcotics. Narcotics agents had previously apprehended three Chinese crew members of the vessel in a Seattle hotel. COTP Seattle provided a search party of two officers and eight enlisted men, who were joined by 10 Customs agents. Two-man teams searched assigned areas of the vessel. A first search of seven hours uncovered a considerable quantity of raw opium. The search party then departed, as if the search were ended, but 45 minutes later they boarded the vessel once more, lined up the crew in the mess hall, and searched them and the ship again. This search, lasting three hours, uncovered more opium, both raw and prepared for smoking, a small quantity of heroin, and several opium pipes. A total of six pounds of opium was seized. WPB 82336 conducted waterside surveillance during the search.\n\n1969 The National Transportation Safety Board issued its \"Study of Recreational Boat Accidents, Boating Safety Programs, and Preventive Recommendations\".\n\n1991 During Operation Desert Storm, two HU-25A Falcon jets from Air Station Cape Cod, equipped with AIREYE technology, departed for Saudi Arabia for service with the Inter-agency oil spill assessment team. They were accompanied in flight by two C-130 aircraft from Air Station Clearwater carrying spare parts and deployment packages.\n\nFebruary 14\n\n1903 An Act of Congress (31 Stat. L., 825, 826, 827) that created the Department of Commerce and Labor provided for the transfer of the Lighthouse Service and the Steamboat Inspection Service from the Treasury Department. This allowed the Secretary of Commerce and Labor to succeed to the authority vested in the Secretary of the Treasury under the existing legislation.\n\n2016 CGC Campbell returned to its homeport at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, following a 61-day counter narcotics patrol of the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean. In the span of one month Campbell seized or disrupted a total of seven smuggling vessels carrying cocaine from South America bound for the United States. The amount of cocaine seized was estimated to be 4,800 pounds and worth more than $80 million dollars. In addition, Campbell's crew rescued eight Cuban migrants attempting to sail from Cuba to the United States in an unseaworthy vessel. Campbell deployed in support of the Joint-Interagency Task Force-South, which is in an international operation to disrupt the transportation of narcotics. In doing so, Campbell worked with air, land, and naval assets from the U.S. Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as Western Hemisphere partner agencies, to counter drug trafficking.\n\nFebruary 15\n\n1911 Congress transferred Fort Trumbull, New London, Connecticut from the War Department to the Treasury Department for the use of the Revenue Cutter Service as its cadet training school.\n\n1943 CGC Calypso removed 42 persons from a lifeboat from the torpedoed vessel SS Buarque (Brazil) east of Cape Henry.\n\n1980 The 70-foot fishing vessel Donna Catalina sank 40 miles south of Nantucket Island. After pumps lowered to the four-man crew failed to keep up with the flooding, a Coast Guard helicopter lifted the fishing vessel's crew to safety.\n\n2015 CGC Polar Star successfully rescued the Australian-flagged F/V Antarctic Chieftain which had been trapped in Antarctic ice 900 miles northeast of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, for nearly two weeks. The rescue operation spanned more than 860 miles and required Polar Star to break through 150 miles of thick Antarctic ice and navigate around icebergs that were miles wide. Antarctic Chieftain damaged three of its four propeller blades in the ice, which required Polar Star to tow the vessel through about 60 miles of ice into open water. Towing the 207-foot fishing vessel through heavy ice placed varying strain on the tow line, which broke three times during the rescue mission. Once in open water, Antarctic Chieftain was able to maneuver under its own power. The crew of F/V Janas escorted Antarctic Chieftain to Nelson, New Zealand. Polar Star reached the crew of the fishing vessel February 13 after traveling across more than 150 miles of ice. The fishermen requested assistance from Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand Tuesday evening after becoming trapped in the ice. RCC New Zealand requested CGC Polar Star, homeported in Seattle, to respond to Antarctic Chieftain’s request for assistance. Polar Star was deployed to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, as part of Operation Deep Freeze. After the successful rescue, Polar Star then continued its journey home to Seattle.\n\nFebruary 16\n\n1926 Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to \"acquire a site at New London, Connecticut, without cost to United States, and construct thereon buildings for the United States Coast Guard Academy at a total cost not to exceed $1,750,000.\"\n\nFebruary 17\n\n1934 CGCs Daphne, Hermes, Perseus, Aurora, and Calypso stood out from New York harbor, bound for their new duty station on the West Coast. They arrived safely in San Diego, California on March 21, 1934 after passing through the Panama Canal. The cutters formed and were referred to as the \"West Coast Squadron\" of the Coast Guard.\n\n1944 Coast Guardsmen participated in the invasions of Eniwetok and Engebi, Marshall Island.\n\n1956 CGC Casco saved 21 persons from a U.S. Navy seaplane that was forced to ditch 100 miles south of Bermuda. The cutter then took the disabled seaplane under tow and delivered both the survivors and the seaplane to the Naval Air Station at St. Georgia Harbor, Bermuda.\n\nFebruary 18\n\n1842 The House of Representatives passed a resolution requesting the Committee on Commerce make an inquiry into the expenditures of the Lighthouse Establishment since 1816. This was to explore the possibility of cutting down on expenses, to examine the question of reorganizing the establishment and administration, and also to ascertain whether the establishment should be placed under the Topographical Bureau of the War Department.\n\n1935 Three newly acquired Douglas RD Dolphin amphibious aircraft, CG-131, CG-132, and CG-133, took off from Clover Field, Santa Monica, California on \"the first every trans-continental flight ever undertaken by a unit of Coast Guard men and planes.\" CG-131 flew to Air Station Cape May, CG-132 flew to Air Station Biloxi, while CG-133 flew to its assigned duty station at Air Station Miami. All aircraft arrived safely. Total flight time for CG-133 totaled 25 hours and 50 minutes.\n\n1952 During a severe \"nor’easter\" off the New England coast, the T-2 tankers SS Fort Mercer and SS Pendleton each broke in half. Coast Guard vessels, aircraft, and lifeboat stations, working under severe winter conditions, rescued 70 persons from the foundering ships. Five Coast Guardsmen earned the Gold Lifesaving Medal, four earned the Silver Lifesaving Medal, and 15 earned the Coast Guard Commendation Medal.\n\n1966 Division 13 of Coast Guard Squadron One (RONONE) departed for Cat Lo.\n\n1968 Engineman First Class Robert J. Yered was awarded the Silver Star for action on February 18, 1968 while attached to Explosive Loading Detachment #1, Cat Lai, Republic of Vietnam. EN1 Yered was supervising the loading of explosives on board an ammunition ship when an enemy rocket struck a barge loaded with several tons of mortar ammunition moored alongside. His citation noted that \"without regard for his personal safety, [he] exposed himself to the enemy fusillade as he helped extinguish the fire on the burning barge…His courageous act averted destruction of the ammunition ship, and the Army Terminal.\" EN1 Yered also received the Purple Heart for injuries suffered during the incident.\n\n1979 Coast Guard HH-3F helicopter CG-1432 crashed 180 miles southeast of Cape Cod, killing four of its five occupants. The helicopter was preparing to airlift a 47 year old crewman from the Japanese fishing vessel Kaisei Maru #18.\n\nFebruary 19\n\n1845 Administrative control of the Lighthouse Establishment was transferred to Revenue Marine Bureau.\n\n1845 Metal buoys were first put into service. They were riveted iron barrels that replaced the older wooden stave construction.\n\n1862 Congress authorized revenue cutters to enforce the law outlawing the importation of Chinese \"coolie\" labor.\n\n1941 The Coast Guard Reserve was established after Congress passed the Auxiliary & Reserve Act. The Auxiliary was created from former Reserve. The legislation was introduced by Representative Gordon Canfield of New Jersey.\n\n1945 The invasion of Iwo Jima commenced. Coast Guard units that participated in this campaign included the Coast Guard-manned USS Bayfield, Callaway, 14 LSTs, and the PC-469. Three of the LSTs were struck by enemy shore fire: LST-792, LST-758, and LST-760.\n\n1988 The largest drug bust in Hawaiian waters to date took place with seizure of the Panamanian-flagged freighter Christina M 800 miles southeast of Hawaii. The units involved were the Navy fast frigate USS Ouellet with a Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment from the CGC Jarvis embarked, the CGC Mallow, and an AIRSTA Barbers Point HC-130.\n\nFebruary 20\n\n1845 President John Tyler vetoed a bill providing that no cutter be built nor purchased unless an appropriation was first made by law, on grounds that sanctity of contract of those already contracted for should not be overridden by Congress. Congress overrode his veto on March 3, 1845.\n\n1964 CGC Coos Bay rescued 11 of the crew of the foundering British freighter Ambassador in heavy seas, 1,000 miles east of Boston. Coast Guard aircraft from Air Station Argentia, Newfoundland, were first on the scene after the freighter issued an SOS on February 18th. The Coos Bay, on Ocean Station patrol 350 miles distant, steamed to the area and arrived there 24 hours later. In concert with the Norwegian freighter Fruen, they managed to get lines aboard the wallowing Ambassador in what was called one of the most dramatic rescues of the year. Demonstrating outstanding seamanship during the rescue, the cutter's commanding officer, Commander Claude W. Bailey, was awarded the Legion of Merit. Many of his crew had volunteered to enter the frigid water to assist in the rescue as well. Two were awarded the Coast Guard Medal while seven others received the Coast Guard Commendation Medal.\n\n2013 The first LRI-II was delivered by MetalCraft Marine U.S. to the Coast Guard on this date and commenced testing activities soon after. The LRI-II, which were built to be deployed on the National Security Cutter fleet, was 35 feet long with a range of over 220 nautical miles and was capable of achieving speeds in excess of 38 knots. \"The stern-launched LRI-II’s high speed and extended range significantly enhanced its host cutter’s ability to execute missions while underway, particularly in migrant interdiction and law enforcement operations where teams need to be put on scene quickly. Its ability to extend the reach of its host cutter is also critical to search and rescue operations, enabling NSC cutter crews to patrol larger search areas. The LRI-II can carry up to 15 passengers, including crew, and safely operate in seas up to 13 feet.\"\n\nFebruary 21\n\n1943 CGC Spencer received credit from the U.S. Navy for attacking and sinking the U-225 in the North Atlantic. The British Ministry of Defence has since recorded that the U-225 was actually destroyed by B-24 Liberator \"S\" of RAF No. 120 Squadron on February 15, 1943 and they have revised the official British records to reflect this change. However, the renowned German naval historian, Professor-Dr. Jurgen Rohwer, stated that Spencer \"probably\" attacked and sank the U-529 instead, although the Spencer has not received official credit for that sinking.\n\n2008 On February 20, 2008, two U.S. Air Force F-15C fighter jets from Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, collided over the Gulf of Mexico off Panama City. Coast Guard HC-144A, No. 2303, and its crew, which were diverted to the scene from a routine training flight. They located the first pilot and directed his recovery. Both F-15C pilots were eventually recovered; regrettably only one was recovered alive. This search & rescue (SAR) mission included two important “firsts” for the U.S. Coast Guard’s new HC-144A Ocean Sentry Maritime Patrol Aircraft. For the HC-144A, the incident marked its first SAR mission, and its first use as an On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) platform.\n\nFebruary 22\n\n1943 CGC Campbell under the command of CDR James A. Hirshfield and assigned to the international escort group A-3 that was escorting Convoy ON-166 through the North Atlantic, engaged numerous submarine contacts during a running battle across the sea. Campbell's attacks damaged at least two U-boats. The cutter also rescued 50 survivors from a torpedoed Norwegian freighter. Then, on February 22, 1943, as Campbell returned to the convoy after rescuing the Norwegians, it detected a radar contact closing the convoy. Campbell raced toward the target and soon made visual contact. It was the surfaced U-606, earlier disabled by a depth charge attack delivered by the Free Polish destroyer Burza. Campbell closed to ram while its gunners opened fire. The big cutter struck the U-boat with a glancing blow and one of the submarine's hydroplanes sliced open Campbell's hull, flooding the engine room. The crew dropped two depth charges as the submarine slid past, and the explosions lifted the U-boat nearly five feet. Hirshfield later noted, \"I felt sure he was ours.\" Campbell illuminated the U-boat with a spotlight and the gunners continued to fire into the submarine's conning tower and hull. Hirshfield was hit by shell fragments but remained at his station. When he realized the Germans had given up, he ordered his men to cease firing. Campbell then rescued five of the U-606's crew. Due to the collision, Campbell was towed to safety, repaired, and returned to service. CDR Hirshfield was awarded the Navy Cross for this action.\n\n1944 Coast Guardsmen participate in the invasion of Parry Island in the Marshall Islands.\n\n1966 Division 13 of Coast Guard Squadron One (RONONE) arrived at Cat Lo for service with Operation Market Time in Vietnam.\n\n2015 CGC Maui returned to her homeport in Bahrain after a prolonged period supporting the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) counter-terrorism and maritime security task force, Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150), patrolling the Gulf of Oman and the North Arabian Sea from December 2014 to February 2015. Maui was the first US Coast Guard Cutter to provide direct support of CTF-150 since 2011 and the first such ship to operate outside the Straits of Hormuz in nearly two years. Despite the challenges of the small cutter’s company, with only 21 sailors onboard, Maui was called upon to do more than what is normally expected from a ship of her size, filling a major role in the mission. The boarding team executed several boarding and approach and visit operations, and the ship’s executive team provided valuable data about the maritime traffic in and around the Gulf of Oman and North Arabian Sea, strengthening CTF-150’s understanding of the maritime picture in the area. Throughout the patrol, Maui was able to coordinate with the patrol craft, destroyers, aircraft and oilers supporting CTF-150’s mission, ensuring maximum radar coverage, vectoring ships to boarding opportunities, and coordinating logistics. At one point, Maui extended the normal endurance of a Coast Guard cutter, spending a total 13 days at sea.\n\nFebruary 23\n\n1822 Congress authorized the Revenue Cutter Service to protect the natural environment by preventing \"scoundrels\" from cutting down live oak on Florida public lands. The oak was used for naval construction.\n\n1837 Congress called for an inspection of the coast from Chesapeake Bay to the Sabine River \"with regard to the location of additional light-houses, beacons, and buoys.\" Captain Napoleon L. Coste, commanding the Revenue cutter Campbell, was dispatched. He reported that the first addition to aids to navigation on this entire coast should be at Egmont Key, Tampa Bay. A lighthouse was authorized immediately and built the next year.\n\n1877 First Lieutenant Dorr F. Tozier, USRCS assisted in saving the French bark Peabody, which had gone aground on February 23, 1877 off Horn Island in the Mississippi Sound. Tozier was awarded a Gold Medal by the President of the French Republic \"for gallant, courageous, and efficient services\" in saving the French vessel.\n\n2010 CGC Alex Haley returned to their homeport of Kodiak after an 80-day deployment to the South Pacific. While on patrol in the South Pacific the crew of the cutter was involved in the rescue of 28 survivors of a shipboard fire and the subsequent sinking of the Taiwanese fishing vessel Hou Chun 11 900 miles southwest of Honolulu February 9th. All 28 crew were rescued and delivered safely to Christmas Island, Kiribati. The cutter's expert medical team assisted two badly burned crewmen who were further medevaced by Coast Guard C-130 from Kiribati to Honolulu.\n\nFebruary 24\n\n1964 A U.S. Coast Guard ice skiff rescued 25 persons from an ice flow that had broken loose from the shore near Camp Perry, Ohio. A similar rescue took place almost simultaneously at St. Clair Shores, Michigan when another Coast Guard ice skiff and a police helicopter removed five more from an ice flow.\n\n1987 Coast Guard attorney LCDR Robert W. Bruce, Jr. became the first member of the armed forces to argue a case before the Supreme Court in uniform. He represented the Coast Guard in Solorio vs. United States.\n\n1989 Coast Guard units searched for survivors of United Airlines Flight 811 after it crashed off the coast of Hawaii. The units included a HC-130, two helicopters, and CGCs Cape Corwin, Mallow and Sassafras. No survivors were found and the units then assisted in the retrieval of debris.\n\nFebruary 25\n\n1799 Congress passed \"An act respecting quarantines and health laws\", superseding the Act passed on May 27, 1796 (1 Stat. L., 619).. The revenue cutters were again authorized to enforce quarantine laws.\n\n1799 Congress passed \"An Act for the augmentation of the Navy\" that authorized President John Adams to place the revenue cutters in the naval establishment. This was done in response to the Quasi-War with France and it had the effect of \"redefining the maritime character of the Revenue Cutter Service and making it a service with the dual character of a military establishment and of a maritime service\" (Irving King, George Washington's Coast Guard, p. 152).\n\n1825 Congress empowered the Revenue Marine to enforce state quarantine laws.\n\n1942 Wartime port security was delegated to the Coast Guard by Executive Order 9074.\n\n2001 The tugboat Swift sank after colliding with the freighter A.V. Kastner on the Elk River in the upper Chesapeake Bay. Coast Guard units from New Jersey and Philadelphia worked with state police and local rescue agencies to rescue three survivors. Two crewmen perished. The Coast Guard also conducted the marine casualty investigation.\n\nFebruary 26\n\n1793 Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury, submitted to the Senate the first official list of cutters with stations, officers' names, rank, and dates of commission.\n\n1984 Five people died, three were injured, and 22 rescued when the tanker American Eagle exploded 180 miles southeast of New Orleans. An AIRSTA New Orleans HH-3 took the three injured crewmen ashore while a British tanker watched over the crippled ship until a commercial tug could arrive. The next day the American Eagle started to break up and sink. The 24 remaining crewmen abandoned ship. Oil rig supply boats and a Coast Guard helicopter recovered 22. The other two became the subject of an HU-25 search, but the SAR case was suspended after three days.\n\nFebruary 27\n\n1925 An Act of Congress repealed the law providing a ration allowance for keepers of lighthouses and increased their salaries correspondingly. This change was not only advantageous to the light keepers, but also simplified office work.\n\n1949 Aerial ice observation flights by long-range aircraft operated from Argentia, Newfoundland. An International Ice Patrol by vessels was neither required nor established during the 1949 season and it was the first time that aircraft alone conducted the ice observation service.\n\n1953 CGC Coos Bay, on Ocean Station Echo, about half-way between Bermuda and the Azores, rescued the crew of 10 from the U.S. Navy patrol plane that was forced to ditch in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n2003 CGC Dallas was ordered to deploy overseas to support Operation Enduring Freedom and to prepare for future contingencies. She was underway on patrol when she received the order from the Atlantic Area commander to sail overseas to the Mediterranean. Dallas deployed with an HH-65B Dolphin helicopter and 7-member aircrew from Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\n2004 The Coast Guard repatriated 531 Haitian migrants to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, after they were rescued in the Windward Pass. The migrants were from 13 boats stopped since February 21, 2004. The repatriations were completed by three cutters: CGC Valiant transported 290 migrants, CGC Vigilant delivered another 241, and CGC Nantucket escorted the cutters for safety and security. The migrants were turned over to the Haitian coast guard.\n\nFebruary 28\n\n1867 As ordered by the Treasury Department, each officer of Revenue Cutter Service, while on duty, was entitled to one Navy ration per day.\n\n1871 Congress passed 16 Stat. 458 which addressed shortcomings in previous legislation regarding the inspection and certification of steamboats and their crews. This Act established the Steamboat Inspection Service (SIS) within the Department of Treasury headed by a Supervisory Inspector General answerable to the Treasury Secretary. The Act also provided SIS inspectors with greater authority over more aspects of the maritime field.\n\n1942 Certain duties of the former Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were transferred to the Coast Guard temporarily by Executive Order 9083. The transfer was made permanent on July 16, 1946. Also, the U.S. Maritime Service was transferred to the Coast Guard from the War Shipping Administration on this date.\n\n1963 With the arrival of the ferry crew on this date to accept delivery of the HC-130B CGNR 1351 at Marietta, Georgia, the Coast Guard completed its program for the procurement of 12 long range, long endurance, four engine landplanes. The aircraft were assigned to Air Station Elizabeth City and Air Detachments Argentia, San Francisco, and Barbers Point.\n\n2004 Coast Guard units responded to an explosion aboard the 570-foot Singapore-flagged tanker Bow Mariner off the coast of Chincoteague, Virginia. The Bow Mariner was carrying 6.5 million gallons of industrial ethanol when it exploded and sank. The Coast Guard rescued six survivors.\n\n2015 CGC Steadfast returned to its homeport of Astoria after a two-month Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF) deployment. Steadfast partook in multiple Coast Guard missions ranging from search and rescue, to counter-narcotics, to securing U.S. borders through enhancement of international relations, and coordination with other cutters and aircraft allowing the U.S. to stop drug trafficking before it reaches U.S. borders. While returning from patrol off the coast of Central America, Steadfast offloaded approximately 725 kilograms of cocaine in San Diego. The seized cocaine is worth an estimated wholesale value of more than $23 million. The offload is a result of a successful drug interdiction in the Eastern Pacific Ocean on January 23, 2015. While on a routine patrol, a maritime patrol aircraft working in conjunction with JIATF assets detected a suspicious go-fast vessel south of El Salvador. Using information provided by the aircrew, Steadfast was able to vector the cutter’s Over-the-Horizon boat to intercept and conduct a law enforcement boarding of the suspect vessel. Once aboard the go-fast vessel, the Coast Guard boarding team found 16 bales of contraband hidden throughout the 35-foot vessel that tested positive for cocaine. The Coast Guard took three suspected smugglers into custody. This seizure is one of many interdictions in the Eastern Pacific in recent months due to an increased presence of Coast Guard cutters in support of the Western Hemisphere Strategy. The Western Hemisphere Strategy has been implemented by the Coast Guard and various other government agencies to protect U.S. borders by stopping illicit trafficking at the source. Steadfast’s interdiction was part of Operation Martillo, which is one component in the United States government's whole-of-government approach to countering the use of the Central American littorals as transshipment routes for illicit drugs, weapons, and cash. Prior to the visit to San Diego, Steadfast participated in a North American Maritime Security Initiative (NAMSI) exercise off the coast of Ensenada, Mexico, February 21-22, 2015.\n\nFebruary 29\n\n1944 Coast Guardsmen participated in the invasion of Los Negros, Admiralty Islands.\n\n1968 In the largest naval engagement of the Vietnam War CGC Androscoggin, Point Welcome, and Point Grey combined to destroy and enemy trawler. CGC Winona, Point Grace, Point Marone, and Point Hudson combined to destroy another enemy trawler and CGC Minnetonka forced another trawler to turn back. A fourth enemy trawler was also sunk, but Coast Guard units were not involved.\n\nMarch 1\n\n1876 Nuova Ottavia, an Italian vessel, grounded near the Jones Hill North Carolina Life-Saving Station. The rescue attempt by the crew of that station resulted in the loss of seven surfmen, the first deaths in the line of duty since the service began using paid crews in 1870. Among the dead was African-American Surfman Jeremiah Munden, the first African-American surfman to die in the line of duty.\n\n1902 The first regular light stations in Alaska were established at Southeast Five Finger Island and at Sentinel Island.
