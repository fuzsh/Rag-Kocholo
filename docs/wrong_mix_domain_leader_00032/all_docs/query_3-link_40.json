        "text": "Lisa: Things to watch for in 2024 when we think about healthcare services specific to managed care and facilities, one, utilization trends. If you think about 2023, we saw an uptick in Medicare advantage utilization trends, we anticipate that those trends will carry forward into the first half of 2024. Second, GLP-1, the impact on both sides. How will this impact the commercial market? How will it impact PBMs? Third, the presidential election.\n\nLisa: GLP-1 were a big area of topic in 2023. They are currently not covered by Medicare or Medicaid. However, as we move into 2024, We'll need a legislative change for them to be covered.\n\nWe recently conducted a survey of 50 of the top 500 companies in the country, a large percentage of them are saying they're not going to cover it for weight loss, so we'll have to wait and see what happens.\n\nLisa: As we think about the medical costs and pharmacy costs in 24, we're getting back to normalization. Post covid, we had two years where people did not go to the doctor. They did not have surgical procedures done.\n\nWe had anticipated coming into 23 that we would see a higher acuity level. what we saw this year is that both cardiac procedures as well as orthopedic procedures, were higher than expected.\n\nAs we go into 2024, we expect that trend to continue within Medicare Advantage. On the commercial side, we have generally seen in line, utilization trends across the commercial population.\n\nLisa: As we think about potential legislative changes for the PBM, pharmacy benefit management business. One of the areas that they're trying to drive is more transparency in the business model. We believe any of the legislation is pretty benign to the current industry as we see it and therefore remain positive on the industry.\n\nChris: Heading into 2024, we're seeing a really exciting opportunity to revisit the pharmaceutical sector given some of the underperformance we saw in 2023. We've got investors sentiments actually pretty bearish for the group right now. And we think that's going to be a really nice opportunity for investors to look at a fairly well positioned group at record low valuations.\n\nChris: We're really excited about the innovation more broadly across the sector. If you just think about 2023, we had the first disease modifying Alzheimer's drug fully approved by the FDA. If you look at oncology market, we had new technologies, things like CAR-T, bispecific antibodies, ADCs, meaningfully improving standard of care in a number of tumor types. These are huge markets where you haven't seen innovation in the last decade or longer.\n\nChris: The GLP one category. This year has been really an exciting year. We're estimating that this will be over a hundred billion revenue opportunity for the sector by the time we go out to the early 2030s. And that would make the GLP-1s the largest therapeutic market we've ever seen. We're expecting the capacity for the GLP-1s to double in 2024, increase another 50% in 2025, and that should really alleviate the bottlenecks we have from the capacity standpoint.\n\nChris: As we think about M&A, the themes really remain growth and innovation and that should lead to further consolidation of the small and mid-cap biotech sector, particularly the higher quality names. What we're seeing is a pivot away from larger, more complex transactions that we saw in the past. And instead what the industry seems to be doing is looking at these kind of smaller assets that are easier to integrate.\n\nChris: As I think about healthcare reform, the big focus for us is going to be on drug price negotiations. This is really coming about because of the inflation reduction act, which is allowing the US government for the first time to directly negotiate drug pricing with the pharmaceutical industry. Many of these are going to make drugs more affordable for seniors, which is great. But for the drug industry specifically, we're got to really watch to see how these negotiations go. It's a big overhang for the sector. One we think is manageable, but obviously we've got to watch exactly how these negotiations play out.\n\nHealthcare Symposium\n\nVis Raghavan: A very warm welcome to this, our inaugural innovation symposium in the health care space. It's absolutely fantastic that you can all kind of join us here today.\n\nDania Chehab: There is quite a lot of innovation coming from health care. And this really permeates across all subsectors, be it cutting edge R&D in biotech, genetic sequencing, and life science tools and diagnostic-- the consumerization of health care, which we have seen accelerate over the last couple of years.\n\nJeremy Hunt: Life sciences is one that we are particularly proud of, not just because we are home to a third of the European life science startups, but because we can see the impact on ordinary families of what happens when you have a strong life science sector.\n\nChristian Wolfum: We have a growing, but also aging population. There's a strong need for more and more precise medicine. And life science companies help there a lot. The life science industry, it's an industry where you have partners from corporate, academia providers. You can really create an ecosystem of open innovation, bringing new ideas into your company, really seeing what will impact health care and the clinical practice in a couple of years from now.\n\nRose Nguyen: Over the past 5 to 10 years, there has been tremendous progress in the field in some areas that even exceeded our expectations. We believe that there is a technological revolution going on in health care and life sciences.\n\nShobi Khan: There's so much innovation going on. And I think to be in that space now, to be able to participate in those discoveries is an extraordinary opportunity.\n\nDavid Redfern: We feel very optimistic about the level of science. There's a lot of great innovation happening, a lot of great science happening. It is being accelerated by the tech revolution. And the interface of data science with biological and genetic science is hugely exciting.\n\nJuha Anjala: We support innovation in many different ways. We have always been willing to invest early in a relationship with innovators. We are a relationship-based organization that invests in our clients early, consistently, and over time.\n\nDavid Ke: I'm very excited by a number of the strong innovations that we have coming out of the health care sector. For example, whether it's the latest cutting edge science coming out of biotechnology. It's been unique and remarkable to see just the globalization within the health care industry over the past decade, whether it's European companies that want to list in the U.S., but also attract capital from Asia, or Asia companies thinking about listing in London, but also wanting to attract U.S. investors.\n\nChris Hollowood: We're incredibly lucky relative to some other industries, where clearly you need to create value for shareholders, but also you create value for so many other stakeholders. At the scientific level translating world-beating science into medicines, then at the medicine level when you see the impact on patients. And the wonderful thing is actually when you serve all three, all three have the greatest success. So there's an alignment there. So if you can't get out of bed in the morning energized by all of that, I don't know what you can."
