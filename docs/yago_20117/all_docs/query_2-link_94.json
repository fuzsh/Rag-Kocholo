        "text": "#100. Adventure's End (1937)\n\n- Director: Arthur Lubin\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.8\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 60 minutes\n\nReportedly shot in just six days—this was a period when it was not uncommon for film sets to run punishingly long daily schedules, right up to full 24-hour cycles—this movie puts Wayne out to sea as a pearl diver who signs on to a whaling vessel. One of the main reasons the script was even approved for production is that Universal had a boat on its lot, which meant production costs could be kept to a minimum.\n\n#99. California Straight Ahead! (1937)\n\n- Director: Arthur Lubin\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.8\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 67 minutes\n\nSeemingly cast against type, this film casts Wayne as a former school bus driver turned trucking company owner who puts his fleet to the test by competing with a specially outfitted train to deliver aviation parts to an ocean liner in advance of a looming labor strike. Universal produced and distributed the film—one of six Wayne made at the studio, none of them Westerns. Director Arthur Lubin also directed four other pictures on Wayne's Universal contract.\n\n#98. I Cover the War! (1937)\n\n- Director: Arthur Lubin\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.8\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 68 minutes\n\nAnother Arthur Lubin directorial effort, this international adventure sets Wayne as a hotshot newsreel cameraman sent to Africa to document tribal unrest and collect juicy footage of the rebel leadership. Along the way, he has an affair with a colonel's daughter, saves his own brother from a pack of gun-runners, and eventually saves the British Army from an armada of bloodthirsty tribesmen. In other words, a lot for 68 minutes of runtime. Writer George Waggner also wrote the Wayne vehicle \"The Sea Spoilers\" before going on to direct \"Operation Pacific\" and \"The Fighting Kentuckian,\" also with Wayne.\n\n#97. Texas Cyclone (1932)\n\n- Director: D. Ross Lederman\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.8\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 63 minutes\n\nWayne plays a supporting role in 1932's \"Texas Cyclone,\" as Steve Pickett who follows a man named Pecos Grant. After riding into a strange town, Grant ends up being confused with a presumed-dead man who had many enemies. \"Texas Cyclone\" features one of Hollywood's most iconic lines: \"This town ain't big enough to hold the two of us.\"\n\n#96. Lady from Louisiana (1941)\n\n- Director: Bernard Vorhaus\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.8\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 82 minutes\n\nOne of a slew of films Wayne made for Republic Pictures during the war years, this drama finds the Duke playing a Yankee attorney somewhat out of his depth in the Deep South. John Reynolds (Wayne) follows a case down to New Orleans, where he investigates a crime syndicate that has infiltrated the Louisiana State Lottery. Romance shortly follows when he falls for the daughter of one of the men he's there to investigate.\n\nYou may also like: All Marvel movies ranked worst to best\n\n#95. Girls Demand Excitement (1931)\n\n- Director: Seymour Felix\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.9\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 69 minutes\n\nPeter Brooks (Wayne) is a good-looking, financially strapped college man with a bone to pick about women attending the same institution as he. But when a spoiled socialite (Virginia Cherrill of \"City Lights\" fame) crosses his radar, he begins to rethink his philosophy. Wayne considered this his worst movie.\n\n#94. Conflict (1936)\n\n- Director: David Howard\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.9\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 60 minutes\n\n\"Conflict\" was based on the Jack London novel \"The Abysmal Brute.\" In the film, Wayne plays boxer Pat Glendon, who plans to throw a big fight until he experiences a last-minute change of heart. The film was made as Wayne's reputation as an actor was on the rise, but it would take three more years before he earned his place as one of Hollywood's biggest stars. The film also features longtime Wayne co-star and personal friend Ward Bond as another ring fighter.\n\n#93. Wyoming Outlaw (1939)\n\n- Director: George Sherman\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.9\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 56 minutes\n\nOne of Wayne's \"Three Mesquiteers\" films, Wayne stars as do-gooder Stony Brooke. This time the trio takes on a crooked politician who's hell-bent on seizing local ranches. Brooke and his men get involved after a teenager from one of the affected ranch families steals a steer from Brooke to feed his family.\n\n#92. A Man Betrayed (1941)\n\n- Director: John H. Auer\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.9\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 82 minutes\n\nWayne portrays Lynn Hollister, a crusading country attorney who takes on big-city corruption in this 1941 romance-drama. Hollister goes after the city's most influential politician and ends up falling in love with the crooked politician's daughter (played by Frances Dee, best known for playing Meg in George Cukor's 1933 version of \"Little Women\") along the way.\n\n#91. Dakota (1945)\n\n- Director: Joseph Kane\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.9\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 82 minutes\n\nPlaying a professional gambler named John Devlin, Wayne finds himself in the middle of a deadly dispute between local farmers and greedy landowners. This standard Western from 1945 was directed by Joseph Kane, who churned out many films every year for Republic Pictures throughout the '30s and '40s.\n\nYou may also like: Most popular movies on Max this week\n\n#90. Idol of the Crowds (1937)\n\n- Director: Arthur Lubin\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.0\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 60 minutes\n\nJust a year after the release of \"Conflict\" came the similarly premised \"Idol of the Crowds.\" Wayne plays Johnny Hanson, a hockey player trying to raise enough money to expand his chicken farm. Hanson finds himself being targeted by vicious gangsters after refusing to throw an important championship game.\n\n#89. King of the Pecos (1936)\n\n- Director: Joseph Kane\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.0\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 54 minutes\n\nAgain playing the role of a lawyer, this time Wayne's character, John Clayborn, ditches the law books for a six-shooter to avenge his parents' murder. After assembling a posse, Wayne leads his men against the rich landowner responsible, exacting revenge the Wild West way.\n\n#88. Lady for a Night (1942)\n\n- Director: Leigh Jason\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.0\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 87 minutes\n\nIn this 1942 romance, Wayne's character, casino-steamboat owner Jack Morgan, falls in love with his business partner, the wannabe socialite Jenny Blake (Joan Blondell). After Blake marries a man from the upper crust, Morgan pursues her anyway. Blake's husband ends up dead from an unintentional poisoning, after which Morgan swoops in.\n\n#87. Winds of the Wasteland (1936)\n\n- Director: Mack V. Wright\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.0\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 55 minutes\n\nIn 1936's \"Winds of the Wasteland,\" two former Pony Express riders (one played by Wayne) race against a stagecoach driver for a lucrative government subsidy. As this is no ordinary race, the unethical stagecoach driver resorts to extreme measures—including gunfire and explosives—to bamboozle his way to the top.\n\n#86. Santa Fe Stampede (1938)\n\n- Director: George Sherman\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.1\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 55 minutes\n\nFrom 1936 to 1943, Republic Pictures released 51 B-movie Westerns featuring \"The Three Mesquiteers,\" a trio of cowboys modeled after Alexandre Dumas' classic swashbucklers. Wayne would appear as one of the Mesquiteers in eight of those films, including 1938's \"Santa Fe Stampede.\" In this installment (the third to feature the trio that included Wayne), Wayne's fellow Mesquiteers work to clear his name after he is falsely accused of murder.\n\n#85. Three Faces West (1940)\n\n- Director: Bernard Vorhaus\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.1\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 79 minutes\n\nA year after becoming box office gold in 1939's \"Stagecoach,\" Wayne appeared in 1940's \"Three Faces West.\" In the film, a surgeon and his daughter flee the Nazis and end up in North Dakota, where a new problem awaits in the form of threatening Dust Bowl winds. To escape the winds, Wayne's character John Phillips leads the pair and others on a migration to Oregon. Wayne's character gets romantically entangled with the surgeon's daughter while on their journey to safety.\n\n#84. Tycoon (1947)\n\n- Director: Richard Wallace\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.1\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 128 minutes\n\nWith a title like \"Tycoon,\" one might wonder if Wayne throws on a business suit and heads to Wall Street for this 1947 flick. On the contrary, the movie sees Wayne playing a rugged engineer named Johnny Munroe who is tasked with building a railroad tunnel in South America, where he encounters danger and romance.\n\n#83. Circus World (1964)\n\n- Director: Henry Hathaway\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.1\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 135 minutes\n\n\"Circus World\" was one of six films Wayne and director Henry Hathaway worked on together over the course of their respective careers. The film is about an American circus proprietor who encounters all sorts of problems when he decides to take his Wild West Show to Europe.\n\n#82. Legend of the Lost (1957)\n\n- Director: Henry Hathaway\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.1\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 109 minutes\n\nTwo men and a beautiful lady (played by Sophia Loren) embark on a journey across the Sahara Desert in 1957's \"Legend of the Lost\" to arrive at the ruins of a lost city. Wayne was cast in the role of a French legionnaire for the film, but that didn't stop him from showing up on set in an American cowboy outfit.\n\n#81. Brannigan (1975)\n\n- Director: Douglas Hickox\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.1\n\n- Metascore: 52\n\n- Runtime: 111 minutes\n\nIn 1975's \"Brannigan,\" Wayne plays Jim Brannigan, a Chicago police lieutenant who risks his life escorting a notorious American crime boss from Britain to the United States. While not a Western per se, the film does borrow a number of thematic conventions from the Western genre. It was Wayne's late-career attempt to break into the gritty, urban cop thriller genre that was then dominating the box office with such films as \"The French Connection\" and \"Serpico.\"\n\n#80. Brown of Harvard (1926)\n\n- Director: Jack Conway\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.2\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 85 minutes\n\nHere a young Wayne (then still billed as Marion Morrison) plays just a small part. The film follows a rivalry between two Harvard athletes, both of whom have affection for a professor's daughter. Representing young Wayne's big-screen debut, he appears as a Yale football player. Four years later, Wayne would play the lead role in \"The Big Trail\" billed as John Wayne.\n\n#79. Flame of Barbary Coast (1945)\n\n- Director: Joseph Kane\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.2\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 91 minutes\n\nThe heat is on and the stakes are high in \"Flame of Barbary Coast.\" This 1945 film is about a gambler who loses everything, gains everything, and loses everything again in his pursuit of a beautiful blonde siren. Set in 1906 San Francisco, the film culminates with the historic earthquake that shattered much of the city.\n\n#78. Blood Alley (1955)\n\n- Directors: William A. Wellman, John Wayne\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.2\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 110 minutes\n\nIn 1955's \"Blood Alley,\" Wayne plays an American merchant captain who gets locked up in a Chinese prison after his ship is seized. With the help of local villagers, Wayne's character plots his escape. The film also stars film icon Lauren Bacall. While uncredited, Wayne did a significant amount of directing on the film after William Wellman was hospitalized with influenza. Robert Mitchum was originally slated for Wayne's role, but Wellman refused to work with him, forcing Wayne, whose company Batjac was in charge of the production, to take the starring role.\n\n#77. McQ (1974)\n\n- Director: John Sturges\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.2\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 111 minutes\n\nIn the spirit of films like \"Bullitt\" and \"Dirty Harry\" came 1974's \"McQ,\" in which Wayne plays a police lieutenant investigating the murder of his close friend. The movie was made when Wayne was arguably past his prime, evidenced by his memorably lackluster performance. But as some of his other 1970s films would go to show, Wayne wasn't down for the count just yet.\n\n#76. The Great K & A Train Robbery (1926)\n\n- Director: Lewis Seiler\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 53 minutes\n\nEvery actor has to start somewhere; for Wayne, that meant working as an uncredited extra in silent movies like \"The Great K & A Train Robbery.\" In the film, a man goes undercover to stop train robberies, presumably passing by a young Wayne (then Marion Morrison) at some point.\n\nYou may also like: What cars do the stars of \"Oppenheimer\" drive?\n\n#75. Central Airport (1933)\n\n- Directors: William A. Wellman, Alfred E. Green\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 72 minutes\n\nWayne stars as a co-pilot in this 1933 film that centers on two aviator brothers competing for the same girl. Wayne might have been a small-time player in this film, but later he would have an actual airport in Orange County, California, named after him.\n\n#74. A Lady Takes a Chance (1943)\n\n- Director: William A. Seiter\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 86 minutes\n\nBlending the comedy, romance, and Western genres to somewhat mediocre effect is 1943's \"A Lady Takes a Chance,\" in which a city girl falls for a handsome cowboy. Naturally, Wayne plays the cowboy whose name happens to be Duke.\n\n#73. In Old California (1942)\n\n- Director: William C. McGann\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 88 minutes\n\nSet during the California Gold Rush, a pharmacist named Tom Craig (Wayne) tries to open a chemist's shop in Sacramento, only to run afoul of a crooked local leader, played by Albert Dekker (though not his dancehall singer fiancee). The 1942 picture is one of just a few films where Wayne can be seen with a 7.5-inch Peacemaker strapped to the side of his leg. That's not to say Wayne was a stranger to Colt Peacemakers—just that they were usually a little shorter.\n\n#72. Allegheny Uprising (1939)\n\n- Director: William A. Seiter\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 81 minutes\n\nMade in the same year as \"Stagecoach,\" 1939's \"Allegheny Uprising\" takes place in pre-Revolutionary War America and features Wayne's character struggling to stop British colonialists from selling alcohol and firearms to Native American tribes. Wayne would later describe the film as an \"awful stinker,\" saying that his character was \"rather dull.\"\n\n#71. Reunion in France (1942)\n\n- Director: Jules Dassin\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 104 minutes\n\nWayne stars opposite screen legend Joan Crawford in 1942's \"Reunion in France,\" about a Frenchwoman who hides an American pilot from the Nazis during World War II. It was rumored that Crawford tried to seduce Wayne behind the scenes but was rebuffed by the married actor.\n\n#70. Cast a Giant Shadow (1966)\n\n- Director: Melville Shavelson\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 146 minutes\n\nIn 1966's \"Cast a Giant Shadow,\" Wayne stars in a supporting role alongside fellow A-list alpha males Kirk Douglas and Frank Sinatra. The film features an American Army officer helping Jewish people in Palestine form an army before the battle for statehood begins.\n\n#69. Flying Leathernecks (1951)\n\n- Director: Nicholas Ray\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n- Metascore: 75\n\n- Runtime: 102 minutes\n\nProduced by noted aviator Howard Hughes, this film follows a squadron of Marine flyers as they do battle in World War II. \"Flying Leathernecks\" was one among many World War II movies starring Wayne, although he was famously deferred from the draft on numerous occasions.\n\n#68. In Old Oklahoma (1943)\n\n- Director: Albert S. Rogell\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.4\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 102 minutes\n\nAfter playing a pharmacist in 1942's \"In Old California,\" Wayne tackled another cowboy role in 1943's \"In Old Oklahoma.\" The film sees Wayne squaring off against a greedy oilman (Albert Dekker once again) over oil lease rights on Native land. Meanwhile, a local schoolteacher (Martha Scott) becomes the object of both men's desires.\n\n#67. Pittsburgh (1942)\n\n- Director: Lewis Seiler\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.4\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 92 minutes\n\nIn 1942's \"Pittsburgh,\" a steel magnate named Charles \"Pittsburgh\" Markham sacrifices friends and loved ones in his ruthless pursuit for success, only to discover it's lonely at the top. The film reunites Wayne with Marlene Dietrich and Randolph Scott—the three had just starred together in 1942's \"The Spoilers.\"\n\n#66. The Sea Chase (1955)\n\n- Director: John Farrow\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.4\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 117 minutes\n\n1955's \"The Sea Chase\" once again plunges Wayne into the midst of World War II, this time as a German freighter captain. The film—based on a true story—follows Wayne's character as he out-maneuvers Allied warships on the open seas. Starring as the romantic lead is screen legend Lana Turner, who was so openly unhappy during the shoot she got fired by director John Farrow. The actress returned to the set only after Wayne intervened.\n\n#65. The Fighting Kentuckian (1949)\n\n- Director: George Waggner\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.4\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 100 minutes\n\nFrench settlers square off with a greedy land-grabber in 1818 Alabama. Wayne's character, John Breen, helps the French settlers get their way. The movie also stars actor Oliver Hardy of the comedic duo \"Laurel and Hardy.\" \"The Fighting Kentuckian\" marks a rare occasion where one member of the \"Laurel and Hardy\" duo appears in a film without the other. Wayne and Hardy would forge a friendship that would last until Hardy's death in 1957.\n\n#64. The Fighting Seabees (1944)\n\n- Director: Edward Ludwig\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.4\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 100 minutes\n\nAnother John Wayne film set in World War II, \"The Flying Seabees\" involves the U.S. Navy hiring a new Construction Battalion (aka a CB or SeaBee), with members who are expected to build and fight. During the shoot, active servicemen were on the set—and some had a few bones to pick with Wayne over his draft deferments.\n\n#63. The Train Robbers (1973)\n\n- Director: Burt Kennedy\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.4\n\n- Metascore: 64\n\n- Runtime: 92 minutes\n\nWayne stars as a gunslinger hired by a widow to track down stolen gold in this 1973 picture. Rife with Western genre conventions, Wayne's son, Michael, produced the film. Ann-Margret co-stars as the widow.\n\n#62. Cahill: U.S. Marshal (1973)\n\n- Director: Andrew V. McLaglen\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.4\n\n- Metascore: 61\n\n- Runtime: 103 minutes\n\nAn aging, no-nonsense U.S. Marshal encounters the ultimate dilemma when his two sons become bank robbers in \"Cahill: U.S. Marshal.\" Released in 1973, the film stars Wayne in the title role. Helping move the somewhat plodding Western along is a noteworthy score by Elmer Bernstein. Director Andrew McLaglen was a longtime member of Wayne's circle, also having directed \"Chisum\" and \"Hellfighters.\"\n\n#61. Annie Laurie (1927)\n\n- Director: John S. Robertson\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.5\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 90 minutes\n\n\"Annie Laurie\" is a silent film from 1927. If you've been paying attention, you already know that means it features a young Wayne (then known as Marion Morrison) as an extra. Nevertheless, with its story about a famous battle between two Scottish clans, the film is right up Wayne's alley.\n\nYou may also like: 10 of the best movies about the Olympics\n\n#60. Without Reservations (1946)\n\n- Director: Mervyn LeRoy\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.5\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 107 minutes\n\nWith over 150 films under his belt, it was inevitable that Wayne would appear in at least a few romantic comedies. Wayne plays a Marine named Rusty who won't stop criticizing a specific book while talking to the girl of his dreams. As it turns out, that very same girl is the book's author.\n\n#59. Wake of the Red Witch (1948)\n\n- Director: Edward Ludwig\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.5\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 106 minutes\n\n1948's \"Wake of the Red Witch\" follows the manly Captain Ralls (John Wayne), skipper of the Red Witch, as he embarks on a series of South Pacific adventures in the 1860s. Based on a novel by Garland Roark, the film has Ralls crossing paths with a ruthless rival captain, a horde of natives, and a giant octopus. Wayne's \"Angel and the Badman\" co-star Gail Russell plays Ralls' love interest.\n\n#58. Hellfighters (1968)\n\n- Director: Andrew V. McLaglen\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.5\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 121 minutes\n\n\"Hellfighters\" chronicles the lives of oil well firefighters, but digs deeper to explore the crumbling marriage of Wayne's character Chance Buckman. Wayne was still smoking in his film roles, including this one—four years after losing a lung to cancer.\n\n#57. The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965)\n\n- Directors: George Stevens, David Lean, Jean Negulesco\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.5\n\n- Metascore: Data not available\n\n- Runtime: 260 minutes\n\nWayne was just one among a number of stars to appear in \"The Greatest Story Ever Told.\" The film is about the life and times of Jesus Christ. Made for over $20 million, an exorbitant sum at the time, the film opened to negative reviews and little fanfare, making it the biggest flop of its time.

It was the second condition that caused a problem, as Republic Pictures executive Herbert Yates and Wayne were no longer on speaking terms. Wayne was thus forced to do something he probably loathed—apologize. Once the conditions were met, Ford and Wayne churned out this film about a cavalry officer who battles the Apache during the Civil War in record time.\n\n#26.

Sherman in John Ford's segment on the Civil War years.\n\n#25.

Wayne was just 41 when he played the 60-year-old Brittles.\n\n#13.

The Longest Day (1962)\n\n- Directors: Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Gerd Oswald, Bernhard Wicki, Darryl F. Zanuck\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.7\n\n- Metascore: 75\n\n- Runtime: 178 minutes\n\nIt's D-Day from both the Allied and German perspectives in 1962's \"The Longest Day.\" It took $10 million to produce the 1962 epic war film, making it the most expensive black-and-white film of its time. At age 54, Wayne portrayed Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, who was 27 years old on D-Day—which Vandervoort was none too pleased about.\n\nYou may also like: The best long movies to watch on Netflix\n\n#5. Red River (1948)\n\n- Directors: Howard Hawks, Arthur Rosson\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.8\n\n- Metascore: 96\n\n- Runtime: 133 minutes\n\nLike John Ford, director Howard Hawks was a master of the Western genre. His best efforts routinely starred John Wayne. The first important collaboration between Hawks and Wayne was this film about a man named Thomas Dunson (Wayne) whose tyrannical behavior invokes a mutiny during a cattle drive to Missouri. While it goes without saying that Wayne was no stranger to the Western genre by 1948, this film was special because it exposed a more subtle and complicated side to his cowboy persona.\n\n#4. Stagecoach (1939)\n\n- Director: John Ford\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.8\n\n- Metascore: 93\n\n- Runtime: 96 minutes\n\nDespite playing the lead role in 1930's \"The Big Trail,\" Wayne struggled to achieve major success in the years that followed. That all changed after John Ford's \"Stagecoach\" was released in 1939. In the movie, a group of people traveling by stagecoach catch word that Geronimo and his violent clan might be headed their way. Legendary filmmaker Orson Welles reportedly watched \"Stagecoach\" 40 times while making \"Citizen Kane,\" taking inspiration from its architecture. This movie was Wayne's big break; after its release, his career as an A-list movie star officially began.\n\n#3. The Searchers (1956)\n\n- Director: John Ford\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.9\n\n- Metascore: 94\n\n- Runtime: 119 minutes\n\nMore than just a John Wayne and John Ford collaboration, \"The Searchers\" is widely regarded to be the greatest Western of all time. In the film, an American Civil War veteran (played by Wayne) sets out to rescue his niece after she's kidnapped by Comanches. Wayne was so enamored with the role of Ethan Edwards that he named one of his children John Ethan Morrison, who would come to be known professionally as Ethan Wayne.\n\n#2. Rio Bravo (1959)\n\n- Director: Howard Hawks\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.0\n\n- Metascore: 93\n\n- Runtime: 141 minutes\n\nWith the help of a motley crew (including a not-exactly-against-type Dean Martin as a boozy deputy), a small-town sheriff (Wayne) keeps a powerful rancher's brother behind bars in \"Rio Bravo.\" It's just a matter of time before the rancher comes around, aided by a mob of angry men. The film is said to be a direct rebuttal to Gary Cooper's somewhat timid performance in \"High Noon,\" a 1952 film sharing a similar premise.\n\n#1. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)\n\n- Director: John Ford\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.1\n\n- Metascore: 94\n\n- Runtime: 123 minutes\n\nJust when you thought it couldn't get any better than \"The Searchers,\" here comes \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\" The film tells the story of Sen. Ransom Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart), who is celebrated in the town of Shinbone as the man who shot ruthless outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). But when Stoddard returns to the town and recounts his tale, it's revealed that Wayne's character—a gunslinger named Tom Doniphon—was the true hero all along. The film marked the first time Wayne and Stewart shared the screen, and the cast also included frequent Wayne co-stars John Carradine and Strother Martin.\n\nData reporting by Luke Hicks.\n\nYou may also like: Top box office movies last weekend\n\nRead First\n\nStacker believes in making the world’s data more accessible through storytelling.
