        "text": "He was the strong, forthright hero: authentic, stubborn, sometimes pigheaded but dedicated to justice and capable of tenderness and sacrifice; a solitary figure, called upon to defend the homestead or rescue the girl, but often exiled, in the end, from the post-frontier civilization that no longer needed his hard man’s brand of competence and courage. Whether he was a gunfighter, a cowboy or a cavalry officer, he became, for many moviegoers, the very avatar of the American frontier: the embodiment of James Fenimore Cooper’s Deerslayer, Emerson’s American Adam or what Garry Wills called fans’ sense of what “was disappearing or had disappeared” from American life.\n\nThe narrator of Walker Percy’s novel “The Moviegoer” talks about the memory of him killing “three men with a carbine as he was falling to the dusty street in ‘Stagecoach' ” as more real than memories from the narrator’s own life. Joan Didion called him the “perfect mold” into which “the inarticulate longings of a nation” were poured.\n\nJohn Wayne put it more simply: “I’ve found the character the average man wants himself, his brother or his kid to be,” he said. “It’s the same type of guy the average wife wants for her husband. Always walk with your head held high. Look everybody straight in the eye. Never double-cross a pal.” Later in his career, he would turn down roles — like that of the conniving and corrupt Willie Stark in “All the King’s Men” — that violated his belief system. “He intended to play only men,” says Scott Eyman, the author of a new biography of Wayne, who “mirrored his own beliefs, his own values, either partially or completely.”\n\nAs Mr. Eyman’s detailed and at times long-winded new book, “John Wayne,” makes very clear, the man Duke Morrison — born in 1907 with the unlikely name Marion Robert Morrison in the small town of Winterset, Iowa — was not synonymous with the John Wayne character he created on screen. “In Wayne’s own mind,” Mr. Eyman writes, “he was Duke Morrison. John Wayne was to him what the Tramp was to Charlie Chaplin — a character that overlapped his own personality, but not to the point of subsuming it.”\n\nA conscientious and tireless student, Duke started out as an extra and prop man, and spent a decade before his breakthrough role as the Ringo Kid in John Ford’s “Stagecoach” (1939), toiling away in B pictures, made in three, six or 10 days. During those years, he honed his craft and put together the pieces of a screen character — his distinctive start-and-stop phrasing; his low, slow growl of a voice; his graceful, rolling walk. It was a character that drew upon his easy charm and faith in self-reliance, but it was also modeled, he once said, on “the kind of man I’d liked to have been.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
