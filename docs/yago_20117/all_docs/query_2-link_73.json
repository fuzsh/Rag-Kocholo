        "text": "Well then now, a fine spring day it was when our car pulled into Castletown and meself and the missus got out of it.\n\nOops. Me brain is still thinking about the Irish way of talking in the 1952 movie “The Quiet Man,” starring John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara. It is among my Top 10 favorites.\n\nThat fact led “the missus” and me to visit the location where the movie was filmed. On May 19 we went to Cong, Ireland, where legendary director John Ford shot “The Quiet Man.”\n\nIt is a quiet, picturesque village with stone fences and bridges, babbling brooks and nearby fields that look much the same as they did in 1951 when the movie was made. There are also the remains of a 12th century Augustinian Abbey.\n\nIf you haven’t seen the movie, it is a mix of drama, romance and comedy. Wayne stars as Sean Thornton, a boxer who leaves America after accidentally killing an opponent in the ring. He returns to Ireland, where he was born, buys the cottage where he lived as a boy and falls in love with neighbor Mary Kate Danaher (O’Hara). Her brother Will (Victor McLaglen) becomes a nemesis, and he and Wayne eventually have a humdinger of a fistfight across wheat fields and pastures while most of the townsfolk follow them. Other stars include Ward Bond and Barry Fitzgerald.\n\nFord, whose father was born in Ireland, won the last of his record four Academy Awards for best director with “The Quiet Man.” He also won for “The Informer” (1935), “The Grapes of Wrath” (1940) and “How Green Was My Valley” (1941).\n\nHis celebrated use of on-location backgrounds was never better than in Cong, where the countryside’s beauty is exceptional.\n\nFord wanted to shoot the movie at Spiddle, where his father was born, but there were no adequate hotel accommodations nearby. So he chose Cong because of Ashford Castle Hotel, still considered by many to be the most luxurious castle hotel in Europe.\n\nThe 13th-century stone castle is a half mile downstream from Cong, and Wayne went to the village each night to drink with the locals in Ryan’s bar.\n\nCong is an island, and its name comes from the Irish word “cunga,” which means a narrow neck of land between two lakes.\n\nIn 1951, there was no electricity in Cong. But that changed quickly when Ford agreed to film there. Ford actually turned the electricity on in Cong for the first time at a ceremony at the Cong Dance Hall, according to a history written by Lisa Collins.\n\nIn a brochure that includes a map of the village and area, Collins details directions to 28 locations used in the movie. All are within 21 miles of Cong.\n\nYou can still drive to the White O’ Mornin’ Cottage, the location used as Sean Thornton’s homeplace. It is about 14 miles outside Cong. The area is beside a brook and remains picturesque, but the cottage is in ruin with only the stone fireplace and some of the walls still standing.\n\nA lady at the Quiet Man Museum told us the government bought the house and land about a month ago and plans to restore the cottage to its appearance in the movie.\n\nThe museum in Cong is a replica of the White O’ Mornin’ Cottage, including thatched roof, and has replica furnishings inside, including the giant bed Sean purchased before he married Mary Kate.\n\nWayne died before the museum opened, but the Wayne family has visited and given its approval. O’Hara, who was born in Ireland, has been to the museum and has said she loves the way the village has preserved the movie locations.\n\nO’Hara, 94, made more than 60 films, five with Wayne. She has often said “The Quiet Man” is her favorite.\n\nOur 12-day vacation in Ireland and Scotland had many highlights, but Cong was special because my wife and I enjoy “The Quiet Man” and can now relate to so many locations when we see the movie.\n\nWe rented a car and drove throughout the countryside, on the left side of the road, which took some adjustment. Many side roads were so narrow you had to stop and let oncoming buses and trucks pass.\n\nBut those adventures are for another story we’ll share down the road.\n\nDan Morris can be reached at (731) 668-1709 or by e-mail at danmorris44@charter.net."
