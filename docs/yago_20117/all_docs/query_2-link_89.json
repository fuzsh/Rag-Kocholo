        "text": "Meet John Wayne Abernathy! John Wayne has been married to Wendi Kinsey Abernathy for 27 years in 2021. They have a daughter named Lauren.\n\n“When Lauren married in December of 2020, we gained a son and now we have our first grandbaby on the way. They could not wait to have children. We are excited,” he said.\n\n“John Wayne is one of my famous cousins. He and I both grew up with the large shoes of Bradley and Wayne Abernathy to fill. John Wayne is a great man who will do anything for you. I loved sitting down with him last month for coffee and this interview.” ~Brad Abernathy\n\nQ: Please tell us about your current career. What do you love most about what you do?\n\nA: “I have been a funeral director and embalmer for 29 years in the Gainesville area. My family and I purchased Ward’s Funeral Home in May 2019. My career is so rewarding. There is a lot that goes into a funeral service, long hours to work. I always try to go the extra mile with a family. To hear everything was perfect is what I love. To help take some of the burden off of people going through hard times, is why we do what we do.”\n\nQ: What are a couple of your favorite restaurants in our community?\n\nA: “Collegiate Grill, my buddy Jeff Worley does an amazing job, Johnny’s BBQ, Longstreet Cafe & Texas Roadhouse are among my favorites. But I love them all.”\n\nQ: How long have you lived or worked in our community?\n\nA: “We have lived in the Gainesville area all my life (47 years) and I have worked here approximately 29 years.”\n\nQ: Who is the most interesting person you’ve met here in our community?\n\nA: “Bob Hamrick. For a man of his age, he is the smartest, sharpest person I know. His intelligence is off the chain.”\n\nQ: If you could travel anywhere in the world right now, where would it be and why?\n\nA: “This is an easy one for me. I love to stay local. Panama City Beach, Fla. is paradise to me!”\n\nQ: What is one of your favorite movies? TV shows?\n\nA: “’Blue Bloods,’ ‘Andy Griffith,’ ‘Everybody Loves Raymond’ and COLLEGE FOOTBALL!”\n\nQ: What advice would you give to people?\n\nA: “I have often heard, ‘a man without a vision will surely perish.’ Our motto at our funeral home is do everything with compassion, integrity and excellence.”\n\nQ: What current or former local business makes you the most nostalgic about our community?\n\nA: “The Gainesville square is amazing. When I was a kid it seemed to be a busy place, then it seemed to be alienated. And now to see it revitalized brings back a lot of great memories for me. Glad to see all the new stores and restaurants opening. We are blessed to be in a town such as Gainesville.”\n\nQ: If you could choose anyone that is alive today and not a relative; with whom would you love to have lunch? Why? And where locally would y’all meet for this lunch?\n\nA: “Donald Trump. He is an amazing person. He is a true American Patriot. He loved the USA more than people realized, and he is still fighting for us! I am sure he would love to meet Jeff Worley at the Collegiate.”\n\nQ: What is your favorite thing or something unique about our community?\n\nA: “Even though we are a big community, I feel we are still small enough to be a close community.”\n\nQ: Where do you see yourself in five to 10 years?\n\nA: “We hope and pray our funeral home is still continuing to grow as it has in the two years we have owned it. We love the people of Hall County and surrounding area, and we hope to earn their trust. Our funeral home is not money motivated, we are motivated by loving on families as Christ has taught us to love. We like to personalize each funeral service to what that person loved, so I hope in 10 years we are doing just that.”\n\nQ: What is something on your bucket list?\n\nA: “I would love to sky dive. I just haven’t got enough nerve yet, although I have got my will made out. So, I am almost there!”\n\nQ: What is your go to band when you can’t decide what to listen to?\n\nA: “Hillsong Worship”\n\nQ: In hard times we can sometimes see and recognize greatness in those around us. Hard working. Positive attitudes. Helping on the front lines. Who is one of our local shining lights today?\n\nA: “Tim Bunch. Tim does so much for our community and it is done behind the scenes. He never wants any credit for anything. He gives away a lot through his restaurants, he loves people, and is an encourager in his own way. Glad Tim is in Hall County.”\n\nQ: What is the most beautiful place you have ever been?\n\nA: “Well back to PCB, we took a family sunset cruise, and watched the sun go down and I will say it was breath taking.”\n\nQ: Favorite month? Favorite holiday? And best single day on the calendar?\n\nA: “August, my birthday and usually college football is around the corner. I love Thanksgiving, to be with family and know you are entering the holiday season. Best single day is when I married my best friend, Wendi.”\n\nQ: What would you rate a 10 out of 10?\n\nA: “I would rate homemade ice cream a 10 out of a 10!! To have fresh peach ice cream or strawberry is out of this world. Wendi made orange crush/pineapple ice cream Memorial Day and it was 20 out of 20! Man it was fantastic!”\n\nQ: Who would you want to play you in a movie about your life?\n\nA: “Michael Scott.”\n\nQ: What is one or two of your favorite smells?\n\nA: “Coconut and beach air”\n\nQ: Who inspires you to be better?\n\nA: “When my dad, Wayne Abernathy was living I would say he did. He always would instill in us to be the best we could be. Never burn a bridge and two wrongs don’t make a right.”"
