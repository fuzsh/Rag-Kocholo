        "text": "Maureen O'Hara took the film industry by storm when she left Dublin for Hollywood while still a teenager. The Irish beauty captivated many viewers with her bright green eyes and luscious red hair, which showed up so vibrantly on screen that she was dubbed the Queen of Technicolor.\n\nOver her decades-spanning career, the redhead captured the hearts of viewers and colleagues alike. The Quiet Man director John Ford was infatuated with her while actor Anthony Quinn claimed to have had an affair with her on set of Sinbad the Sailor. Both men were Irish Americans to whom O'Hara represented a romanticized Ireland.\n\nHowever, the actress denied ever having any extra-marital affairs. Over the course of her time in the limelight, O'Hara had few public relationships - three of which were marriages and none of which were with fellow actors.\n\nOnly three people know what Maureen O'Hara whispered to shocked John Wayne at the end of The Quiet Man\n\nInside Maureen O'Hara's love-hate relationship with The Quiet Man director who reportedly punched her\n\nO'Hara is perhaps best remembered for her frequent collaborations with actor John Wayne, whom she starred alongside in five different movies. Due to the numerous times she played his love interest, and the chemistry the pair shared on screen, many fans wondered if the pair's relationship continued when the cameras went down.\n\nThe truth is, it did but just not in the way that most fans had hoped. Despite a 39-year friendship in which the Queen of Technicolor and Duke starred alongside each other, went through multiple break-ups and marriages to others and even battled cancer at the same time, the pair insisted their relationship was never anything other than platonic.\n\nIn a 2000 interview with Larry King, O'Hara said: \"Everybody asks me did I have a relationship with John Wayne. No. No way.\n\n\"I used to have an old lady stop me in the street and say, 'I saw all your children today,' and they were all Duke's kids,\" she added with a smile.\n\nWhile their relationship was never romantic off-screen, the pair clearly meant a great deal to each other. They met and became friends not long after O'Hara first arrived in Hollywood in 1939, but grew much closer after they were both cast in John Ford's Western Rio Grande in 1950.\n\nThe duo would go on to film four more movies together: The Quiet Man in 1952, The Wings of Eagles in 1957, McLintock! in 1963 and Big Jake in 1971. Whether the cameras were up or down, the pair remained close friends until Wayne's death in 1979.\n\nThrough their friendship, Wayne also grew close with O'Hara's third husband, pilot Charles Blair. \"They used to play chess together all the time,\" she recalled to King with an eye roll.\n\nThe actress once described her co-star as her \"best friend - not just as man and woman, but as two human beings\". \"I knew all of his secrets and he knew all of mine,\" she said, adding that his children called her 'Auntie Maureen'.\n\nWayne's respect for her was equally evident. The leading man referred to O'Hara as \"the greatest guy I ever knew\", which she supposedly took as a great compliment. He also said it was \"impossible\" for filmmakers to make the actress \"not look beautiful\".\n\nIn 1978 - the same year Blair died in a plane crash - O'Hara was diagnosed with uterine cancer. Wayne was battling stomach cancer at the same and reportedly wept on the phone to her when she told him she had been given the all-clear.\n\nShortly before his death the following year, the actress advocated for her gravely ill friend to be given a Congressional Gold Medal. In her testimony, she said: \"I have known John Wayne for 39 years, and in those 39 years I have called him my dearest friend - my best friend.\n\n\"To the people of the world, John Wayne is not just an actor and a very fine actor. John Wayne is the United States of America.\"\n\n\"I beg you to strike a medal for Duke, to order the President to strike it. And I feel that the medal should say just one thing: 'John Wayne, American.'\" The medal was issued with the very inscription she proposed.\n\nIn the days leading up to Wayne's death, O'Hara paid him a visit and was shocked by his sickly appearance. He reportedly grew upset about the pair's \"lousy luck\" in marriages, grief, and poor health.\n\nMaureen O’Hara at the Oscars: the Irish star's Academy Awards in pictures\n\nMaureen O’Hara tells her beauty secrets in unearthed 1954 magazine interview\n\nShe stayed for three days to lift his spirits, not letting her concern show. When she put on her coat and said goodbye, the last words she heard from her best friend were \"That's a gorgeous coat, it looks beautiful on you.\""
