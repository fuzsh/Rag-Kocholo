        "text": "Pilar Pallete was born into an influential family in Peru. She also starred in a few projects, but it was her marriage to Hollywood actor John Wayne that made her famous.\n\nInterestingly, Wayne wasn’t the only man she called her husband as she was married four times with the actor being her second husband. They met at a time when they were married to other people, but that didn’t stop them from falling for each other. Below you will find all the useful information about Pilar Pallete, the Peruvian beauty who won the heart of John Wayne.\n\nBiography of Pilar Pallete, Age\n\nPilar Pallete was born in the northwest of Peru, precisely in the city of Paita, on September 3, 1928. She was born into a wealthy family, with a silver spoon. Her father was Miguel Arturo Pallete, Senator of Peru. His mother was called Carmela de Pallete and nothing is known of the siblings she grew up with. However, while there is no detailed information about her childhood and upbringing, there is no doubt that she had everything she needed back then.\n\nIt is not known how or when Pilar beganShe began to star in a Peruvian film called Sabotear en la Selva (1953). In fact, it was her only role as an actress, although she appeared in several television productions after her marriage to John Wayne.\n\nShe played an uncredited role in The Alamo in 1960, it was through this project that she met Wayne. Subsequently, she appeared as herself in the 1984 episode of Hollywood’s John Wayne Greats. Other television projects she has appeared in include John Wayne Standing Tall – TV Movie/Documentary as Herself (1989 ), biography in episode titled “John Wayne: The Worried Man” as herself (1998), biographyin the episode “John Wayne: American Legend” as herself (1998). More recently, she has continued to make guest appearances in documentaries about the legendary movie star. Some of her recent television appearances were made in The Fox Duke – short documentary as herself (2011) and The Personal Property of John Wayne as herself (2011).\n\nAfter refraining from writing John Wayne’s biography herself, Pilar Pallete later had a change of heart when she realized that those written by others didn’t do him justice, as they barely knew him as much. what. Subsequently, she collaborated with author Alex Thorleifson to co-write ‘John Wayne: My Life with the Duke’. The piece was published on October 1, 1987 by McGraw-Hill Publications.\n\nFamily – Spouse, Children\n\nFrom her rich past, Pilar Pallete is the first married to Richard Weldy, a professional big game hunter. Their marriage lasted from 1948 to 1953. Her meeting with Hollywood star John Wayne may have contributed to the downfall of her first marriage. She met Wayne while filming in the only film in which she plays a leading role. On the other hand, Wayne was looking for a good location for his project – The Alamo. Even though the attraction was there, they didn’t start a relationship immediately, as Wayne was actress Esperanza Baur’s husband, while Pallete was Weldy’s wife.\n\nEven so, the next time they met in LosAngeles, California, in 1953, they were romantically embraced. A year later and hours after his divorce from his second wife, Pilar exchanged wedding vows with Wayne in Kona, Hawaii. The event took place on November 1, 1954. A few years after their marriage, Pilar played her uncredited role in The Alamo, which Wayne also directed and starred.\n\nThe Pilar palette and John Wayne’s marriage produced three children – Aissa (in 1956), Ethan (1962) and Marisa (1966). The family lived happily ever after until the early 1970s when the couple began to break up due to Wayne’s long hours away from home. In 1973, they separated but never ended the legality until the actor died on June 11, 1979, killed by stomach cancer.\n\nPilar Pallete remained single for eleven years, and in 1984 she married Stephen Stewart. Sadly, her marriage to the City Court judge was a ‘two-week mistake’ which officially ended in 1997. She is now married to Jesse Upchurch, a travel agency executive, together since 1998."
