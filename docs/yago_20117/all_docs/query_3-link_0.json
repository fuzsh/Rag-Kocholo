        "text": "Peruvian actress; third wife of John Wayne\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is Pallete and the second or maternal family name is Alvarado.\n\nMaría del Pilar Pallete Alvarado (born 3 September 1928) is a Peruvian actress and the widow of American actor John Wayne.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nPallete was born as the daughter of a Peruvian senator in the Paita Port (northern Peru). She married and divorced professional big-game hunter Richard Weldy.[1] She met John Wayne, 21 years her senior, in Tingo María, Peru, around 1952[2] or 1953, while still married to Weldy. Wayne was in Peru scouting locations for The Alamo.[3]\n\nIn 1953, Pallete came to Los Angeles to dub a film in English, when she ran into John Wayne for the second time. A year later on November 1, 1954,[4][5] they married in Kona, Hawaii, the same day Wayne's divorce became final. Pallete retired from her motion picture career to be a wife and mother to their three children: Aissa, Ethan, and Marisa.[3]\n\nDuring the next ten years of their marriage, they traveled extensively, usually on location for John Wayne's many films. In 1965, they moved to Newport Beach, California.[3] She rented a studio inside the Fernleaf Courtyard, in Corona Del Mar, California, where she would entertain her clients[clarification needed] outdoors with coffee and finger sandwiches and found herself, one year later, with a full-time restaurant.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nPallete married Wayne in 1954, and they remained married until his death in 1979. In 1973 she moved out of their house; however, they were never legally separated or divorced. She has always made clear that they remained married until his death.[6]\n\nIn 1984, five years after Wayne's death, Pallete married Stephen Stewart, a municipal court judge. The marriage was brief, with Pallete later describing the relationship as a \"two-week mistake\".[7]\n\nIn 1998, Pallete married Jesse Upchurch, a travel company executive.\n\nIn 2023, she said that she keeps John Wayne's memory alive through painting.[8]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Alamo - unknown (uncredited) (1960)\n\nHollywood Greats - episode – \"John Wayne\" – herself (1984)\n\nJohn Wayne Standing Tall – TV movie/documentary – herself (1989)\n\nBiography - episode – \"John Wayne: The Unquiet Man\" – herself (1998)\n\nBiography - episode – \"John Wayne: American Legend\" – herself (1998)\n\nThe Duke at Fox – documentary short – herself (2011)\n\nThe Personal Property of John Wayne – herself (2011)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
