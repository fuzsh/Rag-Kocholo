Great Falls Tribune Tuesday, April 4, 1989 Marlenee considering a run against Baucus Two stories in the Washington Post in the last few days have mentioned that U.S. Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-eastern district, is thinking about challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Max Baucus in Montana's 1990 election .

Marlenee press secretary Dan DuBray, Marlenee told the Tribune Monday "indeed has been asked by a number of people in the state Republican political scene" to run against Baucus, but has yet to make a decision. DuBray said Marlenee considers the request "very flattering." The press aide said he was not able to say who had asked Marlenee to run for the Senate, or how seriously Marlenee is considering the request. Marlenee, traveling back to Washington, could not be reached. A Post story Saturday described Montana's awkward potential position of losing one of its two House seats in reapportionment following the 1990 census if the state does not gain more population. If Montana lost a seat, the story said, it could mean Democratic Rep .

Pat Williams, from the traditionally liberal western end of the state, would square off in 1992 with Marlenee, a Republican from the conservative farm country in the east. "Marlenee may forestall that possibility, though, by challenging Sen. Max Baucus in 1990," the Post said. The other Post story, on Monday, said Republican efforts to win back more seats in the Democraticcontrolled U.S. House of Representatives could be hindered by as many as 15 prominent Republican incumbents 3 dropping out to run for governor or senator positions .

Marlenee was one of the GOP members listed as "thinking about mounting Senate races against Democratic incumbents." The story said "a combination of ambition, frustration of life in the minority and a series of attractive political target has accelerated the trend" of Republican House members who may seek new posts. Sun Prairie man charged with assault A 23-year-old Sun Prairie man was being held in Cascade County Jail on $50,000 bail Monday night on charges of physically abusing his 3-year-old stepson. Kenneth Lawrence Van Gurp was charged in Justice Court Monday with felony aggravated assault. The son is in Columbus Hospital's intensive care unit after surgery. He was listed in critical condition Monday .

The child was taken by Van Gurp and his wife to Columbus Hospital on March 31 after the child stopped breathing, according to a court af- fidavit. Doctors performed resuscitation measures until he resumed breathing. The doctor who treated the boy noticed bruises on his stomach and upper and lower legs and believed the bruises were consistent with child abuse. He notified the Cascade County Sheriff's Office, which investigated and arrested Van Gurp on probable cause of aggravated assault, a felony. Van Gurp is scheduled to appear April 20 in Justice Court to face a preliminary hearing before Justice Brant Light .

Judith Basin Centennial program today STANFORD Judith Basin County will celebrate its part in Montana history with a Centennial open house at the courthouse from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday. There will be displays of historical information about the county offices and early officeholders. Students in the county have written essays about what local and family history means to them .

Those one papers eventually will be published in a book to be sold, according to Cathy Session, Judith Basin County superintendent of schools. Stanford junior high school will sing a song they wrote about the county and sang earlier for the Montana Legislature. The words were put to music by a Stanford mother, Eileen Porter. The students will sing about 3 p.m., Session said. Also at 3 p.m., Stanford's old city hall bell will be dedicated as a monument on the lawn of the Judith Basin Museum, next to the courthouse .

The bell has been immobilized so pranksters cannot ring it, Session said, but will probably be rung Nov. 8, Montana's official state birthday. Weather Great Falls Tuesday, partly cloudy with a 20 percent chance of a shower. West winds 15 to 30 mph by the afternoon. Highs 45 to 50 .

Because the bait must be accessible for long periods, it must be used in bait stations that are covered, weather -proof devices allowing only squirrels to enter .

Although effective, the bait and bait stations are so expensive that they can be used only on small acreages, Snortland said.

A year ago, 24 counties mostly in central and eastern Montana were under a rabies quarantine .

Now the number is down to nine, he said. As skunks begin to emerge from hibernation and mate, now is the time strychni eggs can do the most good, James said.

She said group members think there are too many loopholes in the state income tax now and that any sales tax would hit middle- and lower-income citizens the hardest. The group is calling for reform of the whole tax structure, she said, as well as careful examination of state programs for possible cuts. "We do support government services, but we want a return for our tax dollar," she said. Though sales-tax supporters say exempting groceries from the sales tax would make the tax less unfair to the poor, who spend a greater share of their income on such items, Farris disagreed .

She argued that such exemptions favor the wealthy more, because "The poor eat peanut butter and beans; the rich eat steak." Sletten of Eau Claire, 14 grandchildren; 13 great: grandchildren. Waller Funeral Home. Fires Sunday, 8:42 p.m. Dumpster fire, 612 6th St. S .
