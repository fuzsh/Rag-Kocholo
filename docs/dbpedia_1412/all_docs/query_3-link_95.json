        "text": "The sluggish economy has taken its toll on Roll Call’s annual survey of the 50 Richest Members of Congress — their collective net worth dropped from $2.8 billion in 2001 to $2.6 billion by the end of 2002.\n\nDeclining stock values accounted for the bulk of the dip, while real estate holdings, for the most part, were stable.\n\nAlthough some lawmakers’ net worth declined only slightly, other Members vanished from the 50 Richest altogether.\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) — who earned millions as an executive for the Seattle software firm RealNetworks during the tech boom of the 1990s — was once estimated to be worth as much as $40 million.\n\nBut after cashing in millions of dollars in stock options to help finance a 2000 Senate bid in which she knocked off incumbent Sen. Slade Gorton (R), Cantwell has struggled with personal financial woes.\n\nIn addition to the never-ending process of paying off campaign loans and debts, Cantwell watched her own fortune shrink as RealNetworks’ value plunged. The stock, which once traded as high as $78 per share in early 2000, lost more than 90 percent of its value one year later and is currently trading at about $6.50 a share.\n\nWhile she’s still in the millionaire range — Cantwell has slightly more than $2 million in assets and $260,000 in liabilities, giving her a minimum net worth of about $1.8 million — her net worth fell well below the cutoff to qualify for a spot on this year’s list.\n\nAlthough Congress easily has more than 100 millionaires, it takes more than a million bucks — at least $3 million, in fact — to qualify for a spot on this year’s list.\n\nRep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah) was also punted this year. Cannon revealed a minimum net worth of at least $6.7 million on his 2001 financial disclosure forms but disclosed only about $2.3 million in his most recent forms. His largest asset, a loan he made to investment firm Cannon Industries Inc., was valued in 2001 at between $5 million and $25 million, but he valued the loan at between $1 million and $5 million on his 2002 financial disclosure forms.\n\nLast year’s elections, meanwhile, didn’t exactly shake up the list but did initiate a few new faces — and some old ones — into the club.\n\nWith a fortune of at least $12.6 million, Rep. Chris Chocola (R-Ind.) tops the list of four freshman House Members among the 50 Richest, coming in at No. 18.\n\nFormer Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris (R), another first-termer, follows a few spots behind. She brought an $11.6 million fortune with her to the House.\n\nRep. Jeb Bradley (R-N.H.) joins the list this year with a fortune worth at least $8 million, and Clinton-White-House-aide-turned-Illinois-Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D) lands at No. 36 on this year’s survey with $6.7 million.\n\nFreshman Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.) is also new to the list, sort of. Her husband, former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), spent many years on the list, but his post-Senate employment has been a boon to the couple.\n\nWith at least a $9 million fortune, Sen. Dole ranks several notches higher than her husband ever did. She is the 30th-richest lawmaker in Congress, whereas her husband ranked 46th during his last appearance on the list in 1996.\n\nSen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) also reappears on the list after returning to Congress to claim disgraced Sen. Robert Torricelli’s (D) seat.\n\nOne of this year’s biggest movers and shakers is Rep. Charles Taylor (R-N.C.), who skyrocketed 10 notches as his assets grew from at least $14.5 million to more than $34 million. And Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.) also has reason to smile as his net worth jumped from $55 million to $71.3 million.\n\nOther Members realized more modest gains: Rep. Jane Harman (D-Calif.) climbed from No. 7 to No. 6 as her net worth increased from at least $100 million to about $116 million.\n\nPresidential contenders are well-represented in the millionaires’ club. Sen. John Kerry (Mass.) — one of three Democratic presidential hopefuls in the club — still ranks as the richest Member of Congress, with an estimated fortune of about $600 million, most of it related to his ketchup heiress wife’s substantial holdings.\n\nBut Sens. John Edwards (N.C.) and Bob Graham (Fla.), both of whom are also gunning for the rights to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., are no slouches either.\n\nEdwards, a successful trial attorney, has at least a $12.3 million fortune, and Graham is worth at least $7.1 million.\n\nThe guidelines for Roll Call’s roster, inspired by Forbes’ annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, are as follows: We begin by using disclosure forms filed with the House and Senate, estimating net worth by combining minimum assets and minimum liabilities.\n\nFor example, if a holding is valued at between $500,000 and $1 million, we assess its value at the minimum, $500,000. Assets held by spouses and dependent children are included as part of the total net worth — a factor that helps keep individuals such as Kerry and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) staples on the list.\n\nWe use disclosure forms as a reference point but combine them with information from Members’ hometown newspapers and other sources, such as the Forbes 400, to come up with a list of the wealthiest 50 Senators and House Members.\n\nAs in our previous efforts, we have done some estimating, but we present our list with a good deal of confidence that it’s as close an approximation of the true state of individual Congressional wealth as is possible to derive from publicly available data.\n\n1. Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.),\n\n$600 million\n\nCurrently campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Kerry continues his near-constant reign at the top of the list this year, with his No. 1 asset being his wife, ketchup heiress Teresa Heinz Kerry.\n\nHeinz Kerry, who was married to the late Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), inherited a family fortune reported to be more than $675 million after her husband died in an airplane accident in 1991. Four years later, Heinz Kerry found love again with Kerry, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and anti-war-protester-turned-politician.\n\nBut don’t necessarily expect the Heinz fortune to pay for Kerry’s presidential bid. Heinz Kerry has said she won’t kick any cash into Kerry’s campaign coffers unless he comes under personal attack by his political foes. Moreover, according to an Associated Press report in June, Kerry campaign advisers speaking on background said that legally the Senator cannot tap into his wife’s multimillion-dollar Heinz investment holdings, though it seems he could use half of any jointly held investments.\n\nAs in past years, Kerry — whose 2002 disclosure forms reveal a minimum net worth of at least $168 million, significantly less than his actual net worth because of the inexact nature of the forms — reports much of his wealth to be in marital trusts, Heinz family trusts and a bond fund.\n\nKerry’s wife — whom Forbes magazine ranked as the 391st richest American in 2002 with an estimated fortune of $550 million — boasts many stock holdings with estimated values of more than $1 million, including Anheuser-Busch, General Electric, PepsiCo and Wal-Mart. Throughout the year, the couple regularly bought and sold stocks, many falling into the “over $1 million” category of the financial disclosure forms.\n\n2. Rep. Amo Houghton (R-N.Y.),\n\n$475 million\n\nHoughton weathered some tough criticism from fellow Republicans when he voted against a repeal of the estate tax earlier this year — but the multimillionaire Congressman described his vote as a matter of principle, and not simple pocketbook politics.\n\n“I’ve seen this effect on other countries where there’s an establishment of a landed gentry, a privileged and titled class, and it’s not good,” Houghton told National Public Radio. “And that’s not what has made the United States what it is today.”\n\nWhen it comes to personal wealth, Houghton has endured a bit of a roller coaster in recent years.\n\nA descendant of Corning’s founders and a former employee of the company, the nine-term Representative has significant holdings in the company. Just three years ago, Houghton’s stock in Corning was doing so well that Roll Call speculated that he might qualify as Congress’ first billionaire.\n\nBut Corning’s stock took a dive in 2002, dragging Houghton’s net worth down. The value of shares in Corning — whose fiber-\n\noptics manufacturing was hurt in the telecommunications downturn — dropped from about $100 a share a couple of years ago to only $2 or so a share this time last year. The company still faces numerous hurdles as it attempts to recover, but the stock is performing better now, currently trading between $8 and $9 a share.\n\nHoughton’s disclosure forms are still among the fattest in Congress — he provides multiple attachments listing detailed transactions of his holdings through the Market Street Trust Co. — and the most difficult to decipher.\n\nComplicating matters, neither he nor his staff will discuss his wealth — they call it a personal matter — but his forms list more than $37 million in assets, most of it stocks and bonds held through trusts.\n\nMoreover, he’s still able to ride Corning’s corporate jet whenever he likes, but he does reimburse the company based on “the prevailing commercial airplane value of the trip.”\n\n3. Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.),\n\n$300 million\n\nIf Corzine’s success on Wall Street is any indication, he may be just the man the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee needs to guide it through the post-soft-\n\nmoney world of campaign finance.\n\nWhile his most recent financial disclosure forms list a minimum of more than $71 million in assets, Forbes magazine pegged his wealth at $300 million on a list of the 10 richest politicians in America published last October.\n\nCorzine — who was first elected to the Senate in 2000 and is chairing the DSCC for the 2004 campaign cycle — made his fortune as the chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Co., a global investment and securities trading firm. He’s still reaping the benefits today, even as he divests his Goldman Sachs stock.\n\nThe Senator vowed to his constituents that he would sell those investments to give the public confidence that he is not making decisions in his own self interest. His 2002 financial disclosure forms revealed sales of between $12.5 million and $43 million in Goldman Sachs stock through a blind trust last year. The trust made the sales on 10 separate occasions in January and five other times throughout the year. The largest chunk, between $5 million and $25 million worth of stock, was liquidated Nov. 21.\n\nNonetheless, the lawmaker still holds at least $50 million in Goldman Sachs in the blind trust from which he reported income greater than $5 million. He has additional accounts in the employee profit-sharing retirement income plan and the employee pension plan dating to 1976.\n\nIn addition, he holds between $5 million and $25 million in a JP Morgan money market fund, between $8 million and $37 million in various investment funds, and private bank accounts valued at between $500,000 and $1 million.\n\nCorzine might have a sports team added to his portfolio next year if all goes well in his negotiations to buy the New Jersey Nets pro-basketball team. The Associated Press reported in August that a partnership of Corzine and developer Charles Kushner that was forged by former Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) has offered to buy the team.\n\nAlthough Corzine sold his Park Avenue condo in New York City two years ago for at least $5 million, he still owns a variety of real estate in addition to a Hoboken, N.J., residence that does not have to be disclosed. The Senator’s real estate holdings include a mobile home park in Colorado worth up to half a million dollars; residential apartments in Houston worth between $500,000 and $1 million; and undeveloped land in Ouray, Colo., valued at between $5 million and $25 million.\n\nHe also has investments in Orland Park Cyclery, a bike shop in Chicago worth less than $500,000, and fractional ownership of a private aircraft valued between $1 million and $5 million.\n\n4. Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.),\n\n$250 million\n\nThe true value of Kohl’s wealth has been estimated at much higher than the minimum value of $111 million that his financial disclosure forms indicate.\n\nIn last year’s survey, Roll Call estimated Kohl’s fortune at about $300 million, whereas in Forbes’ roundup of the richest politicians, the financial magazine pegged his wealth at $250 million.\n\nThe lawmaker lists two assets of greater than $50 million — a blind trust he established in 1989 that earned between $1 million and $5 million in 2002, and stock in the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, which collected $73 million in gross receipts before expenses. While the team has had financial troubles in the past and still has one of the highest payrolls in the NBA at $57 million, it is worth much more than the $19 million Kohl paid for it in 1985.\n\nThe Senator also maintains a ranch and horse-breeding operation in Kelly, Wyo., worth between $5 million and $25 million. He reported horse sales worth $61,691 in 2002, up from the previous year’s sales of $14,355.\n\nOther assets include multiple real estate investments throughout Wisconsin valued between $2 million and $7 million and vacant land in Wyoming worth between $1.25 million and $5.5 million.\n\n5. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.),\n\n$200 million\n\nAlthough Rockefeller represents one of the poorest states in the country — he settled in the Mountain State after obtaining a Harvard University undergraduate degree and began work as an anti-poverty volunteer before heading into politics — he’s one of the richest men in the Senate.\n\nThe great-grandson of one of this country’s first billionaires, oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, the Senator has maintained a spot near the top of the 50 Richest with a stable portfolio of stocks, bonds and blind trusts totaling at least $100 million.\n\nHis biggest holdings are qualified blind trusts, estimated at between $80 million and $125 million, as well as a Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance policy of more than $1 million. Other assets include individual stocks, including shares in companies such as AOL Time Warner, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Cox Communications.\n\n6. Rep. Jane Harman (D-Calif.),\n\n$116 million\n\nHarman climbs a notch in this year’s survey thanks to $115.4 million in assets listed on her 2002 financial disclosure form — a 21 percent increase from the $95 million in assets she revealed for 2001.\n\nThis former three-term House Member who returned to the chamber in 2001 is married to Sidney Harman, founder of the Fortune 500 electronics company Harman International Industries, which manufactures high-end stereo equipment. The company paid him $1.3 million in 1999, according to the financial disclosure Harman filed during her 2000 House race — she declined to list his salary in more recent filings — and in her 2002 disclosure she listed more than $50 million worth of stock in Harman International in her husband’s name and an additional $25 million to $50 million in stock options.\n\nHarman’s husband also has significant investments in several real estate limited partnerships, valued between $1.75 million and $6.5 million, and other various investments in everything from vineyards to theatrical stage productions.\n\nThe couple’s joint assets include bank accounts in Beverly Hills and New York and several trust funds.\n\n7. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.),\n\n$100 million\n\nThis millionaire made headlines this year, spending more than $1.5 million to gather petitions to recall California Gov. Gray Davis (D), according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIssa funded much of the effort through Rescue California, a group that pays signature gatherers as much as $1.25 per signature. But $1.7 million is only a fraction of the $37 million to $110 million the lawmaker spent in 2002.\n\nIssa — who has earned millions in the car-alarm business and disclosed a minimum net worth of more than $99.6 million — also purchased property in Santa Ana and Carlsbad, Calif., listing the values for both at between $5 million and $25 million. His largest single investment for the year, however, was an S&P mutual fund worth between $25 million and $50 million.\n\nIssa has come a long way since recording “Stand back!” and “Please step away from the car” — the widely recognized commands of the popular Viper car alarm system that made him rich. But he still sits on the board of trustees of the company he founded, Directed Electronics, though he did not report any income from the alarm company last year.\n\nToday, his portfolio is full of various stocks, bonds and mutual funds. His two largest assets are a Merrill Lynch S&P 500 mutual fund and an investment in DEI LLC. DEI owns and manages several properties, including the two Carlsbad locations he purchased last year valued at between $25 million and $50 million apiece.\n\nAnother investment in Greene Properties — which rents light industrial and office space in Vista and Oceanside, Calif. — is valued at between $5 million and $25 million and earned him at least $1 million in rental income in 2002.\n\nIt was through loans from Greene Properties that Issa funded Rescue California, the committee that largely financed the effort to get a gubernatorial recall on the ballot — but according to a recent Los Angeles Times article, Greene Properties had its corporate status suspended for three months in early 2000 after Issa neglected to pay state corporation taxes for two years on the company.\n\nIssa, however, told the newspaper that the fees were paid on time and the corporate status was temporarily suspended because of a clerical error.\n\nIn addition to Directed Electronics, Issa serves on the board of directors for DEI, Greene Properties, the Issa Family Foundation and USO, as well as the board of trustees at Siena Heights University in Adrian, Mich.\n\n8. Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.),\n\n$71.3 million\n\nChafee entered the Senate as an appointed replacement for his late father in 1999 and was then elected to a full term in 2000. Before the Senate, this multimillionaire sampled various career paths while in his undergraduate years at Brown University, including construction work and a brief stint as a farrier, a hoof-care professional for horses.\n\nIn 1986, he served on the Warwick, R.I., City Council before being elected mayor.\n\nHis 2002 disclosure forms show that his largest assets are in blind trusts in the names of his wife, Stephanie, children and grandchildren that reach into the multimillion-dollar range and comprise various stocks and bonds.\n\nHis wealth is at least $16 million higher than in 2001, bumping him up one spot in this year’s survey.\n\nOther assets listed included his wife’s WeeHoose Farm in Exeter, R.I., worth more than $1 million. The couple have joint ownership of undeveloped land in Sorrento, Maine, with an estimated value between $250,000 and $500,000, as well as a Franconia, N.H., house with an estimated value between $100,000 and $250,000.\n\n9. Rep. Doug Ose (R-Calif.),\n\n$53.3 million\n\nIn his final term in Congress — Ose plans to honor a term-limits pledge and retire at the end of 2004 — the Sacramento Congressman climbs two notches, as his minimum net worth increased from $50 million to more than $53 million in 2002.\n\nOse worked on residential housing projects for his family’s business until he started his own company in 1985 specializing in the development of mini-storage facilities.\n\nIn 2000, when longtime Rep. Vic Fazio\n\n(D-Calif.) announced his retirement, Ose used $1.4 million of his own money to win the seat — but he’s still got plenty to go around. Last year, Ose disclosed his assets in significantly more detail than he ever has before.\n\nHis largest asset, Ose Properties No. 6, comprises securities and real estate located in Sacramento and is worth between $25 million and $50 million. Large stock holdings under Ose Properties No. 6 include multimillion-dollar holdings in Citigroup, Dell Computer Corp., Merck & Co. and Wal-Mart.\n\nOther Ose investment properties — including vacant land, mini-storage facilities and other holdings — are worth several million dollars more.\n\nOse’s investment in Lockerooms 2 LP, a mini-storage facility, is worth between $100,000 and $250,000, and he also lists significant stock holdings in everything from AT&T Wireless to General Electric.\n\nOse — who is the president of Sydling Court Investment Co. — also has interest in several racquet clubs in California.\n\n10. Rep. Robin Hayes (R-N.C.),\n\n$50 million\n\nAn heir to a multimillion-dollar textile fortune, Hayes was a hosiery mill owner before being elected to Congress in 1998.\n\nAttachments detailing the value of assets in trusts that he has voluntarily included in his most recent disclosure forms reveal a minimum net worth of more than $49 million. Those trusts comprise a variety of investments, including stocks, bonds and real estate. Hayes maintains that he earns only a fraction of income from the trusts, and securities and assets are held in the trust for the “benefit of future owners.”\n\nHe also owns an airplane housed in Concord, N.C., worth between $1 million and $5 million, as well as various properties throughout the Tar Heel State and Wisconsin. He lists stock in Berkshire Hathaway, Solectron, Intel and several other companies.\n\n11. (tie) Rep. Charles Taylor (R-N.C.),\n\n$35 million\n\nTaylor, a tree farmer and former bank executive, skyrocketed 10 notches in this year’s survey.\n\nWhile he disclosed a minimum of about $14.5 million in assets for 2001, his 2002 financial disclosure forms revealed a minimum net worth of at least $34.7 million.\n\nHis financial dealings have raised considerable controversy in recent years, however.\n\nIn 2000, a brouhaha erupted when tax collectors came after Taylor for $48,000 in overdue property taxes, going so far at one point as to threaten to garnish his Congressional salary if he didn’t pay up.\n\nHe has also faced ongoing scrutiny over several business ventures in Russia as well as his role as chairman of the board of Blue Ridge Savings Bank in Asheville, N.C., which was under investigation by a federal grand jury looking into questionable loans made in the early 1990s to a friend of and political contributor to the Congressman.\n\nTaylor’s largest asset is $25 million to $50 million worth of stock in the Financial Guaranty Corp. in Asheville. In December 2002, he exchanged $5 million to $25 million worth of stock in Blue Ridge Savings Bank for shares in Financial Guaranty when Blue Ridge Savings merged with the bank.\n\nHis family’s tree farm in Transylvania County, N.C., is worth between $1 million and $5 million and is held jointly. His wife, Elizabeth, has a $500,000 to $1 million investment in Southeastern Real Estate and Discount in Brevard, N.C.\n\n11. (tie) Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),\n\n$35 million\n\nFeinstein listed more than $31 million in holdings, shares and trusts in her 140-page financial disclosure form. The majority of her fortune — painstakingly recorded, documented, catalogued and organized — is in the name of her husband, Richard Blum.\n\nBlum’s holdings constitute the first dozen pages of Feinstein’s report, listing separate properties and businesses in D.C., California, Illinois, New Hampshire and the capital of the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius.\n\nFeinstein’s assets include her city of San Francisco mayoral pension, the interest from various trust funds, and stock holdings, most in Blum’s name. She also has a qualified blind trust with an estimated value between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nBlum holds between $500,000 and $1 million in both Playtex and Intuitive Surgical stocks, through Blum Capital Partners. Feinstein’s husband also owns more that $1 million in Kinetic Concepts and URS Corp. In November 2002, he increased his already sizable investment in Northwest Airlines with a purchase transaction valued at “over $1 million.”\n\nFeinstein, meanwhile, is the primary beneficiary of the Bertram Feinstein Trust, with an estimated value between $5 million and $25 million.\n\nThe couple’s shared assets include a San Francisco hotel, estimated between $5 million and $25 million, and two condominiums in Hawaii and Lake Tahoe valued at between $250,000 and $500,000 each.\n\n13. Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.),\n\n$26 million\n\nThe Illinois banking heir, who will retire from the Senate at the end of his first term in 2005, reported between $1 million and $5 million in capital gains last year from his stock in Bank of Montreal, valued between $25 million and $50 million.\n\nHis father, Gerald, founded Suburban Banking Corp. outside Chicago in 1960. When the Bank of Montreal purchased it in 1991, the transaction earned the Fitzgeralds about $40 million and provided the cash Fitzgerald needed for his first, and apparently only, Senate bid in 1998.\n\nContinuing a pattern of the past few years, Fitzgerald sold portions of the stock through the year, although at lesser values than in the past. In 2002, Fitzgerald sold between $251,000 and $515,000; in 2001, he sold as much as $13.3 million.\n\nOther assets — his minimum net worth is at least $25.9 million — include between $500,000 and $1 million in common stock invested in Southern Wisconsin Bancshares Corp. and First Bancorp of Durango, both based in Inverness, Ill.\n\nFitzgerald has not chosen to establish a blind trust, as many other wealthy lawmakers do to avoid scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest. He did, however, decline to take a seat on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and recuses himself from voting on banking legislation.\n\nBut at the end of 2002, Fitzgerald was still sitting on a mound of financial debt — nearly $2.3 million, according to his 2002 financial disclosure report — much of that still stemming from his 1998 campaign, during which he spent upwards of $17 million.\n\n14. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.),\n\n$19 million\n\nThe House Minority Leader’s minimum assets rang in at $18.9 million in 2002, up from $16 million the previous year, with the majority of her wealth based in California real estate. Her husband, Paul, holds his own real estate investments, including commercial properties in San Francisco, a Rutherford resort hotel and a shopping\n\ncenter.\n\nPelosi owes much of the length of her financial disclosure forms to her husband’s eye for investment. Large assets under his name include Piatti Restaurant Co., a restaurant operating company with an estimated value between $5 million and $25 million, and Nine Forty Five Battery, a real estate partnership estimated at between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nThe majority of the couple’s diverse stock holdings — including AT&T, Advanced Fibre Communications, Comcast, JetBlue Airways, Odyssey and Speakeasy — fall under her husband’s name.\n\nTogether, the couple own Napa Valley real estate valued between $250,000 and $500,000; a Norden town home valued between $1 million and $5 million; and an Alpine Meadows condominium apartment valued between $500,000 and $1 million.\n\nThey also own two vineyards, an eight-acre Rutherford investment estimated between $1 million and $5 million and another located on Zinfandel Lane in St. Helena, Calif., with an estimated value between $5 million and $25 million.\n\n15. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.),\n\n$18 million\n\nFrelinghuysen inherited more than just money from his ancestors. He inherited a political legacy.\n\nFive Frelinghuysens served in Congress before him, with four relatives serving in the Senate in the 1800s and his father, Peter, serving in the House for two decades last century.\n\nAfter college and a stint in the military that took him to Vietnam, Frelinghuysen followed in his forefathers’ footsteps, forging his political career by going to work for Dean Gallo (R), who first held local office and later was elected to Congress.\n\nIn 1994, Frelinghuysen succeeded his long-time boss when Gallo died.\n\nFrelinghuysen’s wealth mainly features numerous stock and bond holdings, with assets totaling more than $17 million — down slightly from the $19 million he disclosed a year prior.\n\nHis largest single holding continues to be his stock in Procter & Gamble, worth between $7 million and $27 million. He also holds large amounts of stock in several pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Merck, as well as real estate holdings in New Jersey and Massachusetts. Much of his stock is held in a blind trust.\n\n16. Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.),\n\n$16 million\n\nThe Senate Majority Leader has most of his $15 million-plus assets in blind trusts.\n\nThe former heart surgeon, whose father and brother founded HCA, the biggest for-profit U.S. hospital chain, reported between $6.5 million and $31 million in trusts that he has no control over. Like many other wealthy lawmakers, he moved stock into the trusts to prevent claims of conflicts of interest.\n\n“It really doesn’t influence the decisions I make in the United States Senate,” he told The Associated Press, adding that he has never worked for HCA or been on the company’s board.\n\nFrist also disclosed blind trusts for his wife, Karyn, and three sons who earned more than $1 million in 2001.\n\nFrist did not earn any salary besides his Senate income and is on nonacademic leave without pay from Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\n\n17. Rep. Porter Goss (R-Fla.),\n\n$14 million\n\nThe former CIA agent and newspaper publisher and current chairman of the House Intelligence Committee listed more than $13.9 million in assets on his 2002 disclosure forms — down slightly from the $15 million-plus he listed the previous year.\n\nHis largest assets are jointly held in farm land and farm-related store valued at between $1 million and $5 million, though he listed a loss of income for both produce, grazing fees and store sales.\n\nHe also owns between $1 million and $5 million worth of stock in both General Electric and Wal-Mart, undeveloped real estate on Fishers Island, N.Y., worth between $500,000 and $1 million, and numerous other stock holdings — some jointly held, some in Goss’ name only and some only in the name of his wife, Mariel.\n\n18. Rep. Chris Chocola (R-Ind.),\n\n$12.6 million\n\nThis Republican Congressman who succeeded retiring Rep. Tim Roemer (D-Ind.) is the richest House freshman. His financial disclosure forms list a minimum of nearly $12.6 million in assets, and his only liabilities are a car loan and a home equity line of credit worth between $250,000 and $500,000.\n\nHis largest single holding is $5 million to $25 million of cash and equivalents. Last year, Chocola sold his investment in CTB International Corp., a farm-equipment maker for which he once served as chairman. He recently sold his ownership to billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway for more than $5 million.\n\nThe Midwest lawmaker lists numerous other holdings in everything from farm land to numerous stocks.\n\n19. Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.),\n\n$12.3 million\n\nThis North Carolina Senator with humble beginnings was the first of his family to graduate from college. The son of a textile industry worker and a small-furniture refinishing shop owner, Edwards continued his education and earned a law degree from the University of North Carolina in 1977. With his degree, Edwards earned his fortune as a trial lawyer, representing individuals in personal injury lawsuits.\n\nEdwards, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, lists his largest asset as a qualified blind trust with an estimated value of between $5 million and $25 million. He also owns properties in Raleigh, N.C., with an estimated value between $880,000 and $1.9 million.\n\nOther assets include a variety of stock from various corporations, including ChevronTexaco, Coca-Cola, Citigroup, CVS, Dell, Duke Energy, ExxonMobil, Ford Motor, General Electric, Hilton Hotels, Wal-Mart, Walgreen Co., Verizon, PepsiCo, Intel and Johnson & Johnson.\n\n20. Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.),\n\n$12.2 million\n\nThe bulk of Lowey’s reported $12.179 million-plus fortune stems from her husband’s law firm earnings at Lowey Dannenberg Bemporad & Selinger, which (with profit sharing) were estimated between $2 million and $10 million in 2001.\n\nHer husband, Stephen, also has several stock investments estimated to be worth between $15,000 and $50,000 each, including American Express, Bed Bath & Beyond and Gillette. The couple jointly hold a variety of stocks, including Wal-Mart, Pfizer, Walgreen Co., Citigroup and The New York Times Co.\n\nOther large assets include holdings in Ingalls & Snyder value fund with an estimated value between $1 million and $5 million, and their multimillion-dollar investment in Lowey Family Investment LLC.\n\n21. Rep. Katherine Harris (R-Fla.),\n\n$11.6 million\n\nHarris, a former IBM marketing executive and vice president of a commercial real estate firm, enters the list as the second freshman Representative on the list.\n\nBefore entering Congress, she was Florida secretary of state and a member of the Florida Senate, where she served as chairwoman of the commerce and economic development committee and vice chairwoman of both the banking and insurance and government reform committees.\n\nHarris listed her net worth as more than $11.564 million.\n\nTwo of her largest assets are listed in the name of her husband, Anders: Intercon Marketing, a marine products importing and distribution company with an estimated value between $5 million and $25 million, and a home in Sarasota, Fla., valued between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nIncome from Alco USA, which imports and distributes alcohol, is also listed under her husband’s name with an estimated value between $250,000 and $500,000.\n\nIn addition to her state of Florida pension, Harris has a concentrated stock portfolio and a money market account. The value of her shares in Ben Hill Griffin Inc. is estimated between $5 million and $25 million.\n\n22. Rep. Denny Rehberg (R-Mont.),\n\n$11.2 million\n\nA family man married to his high school sweetheart, Rehberg has straddled the fence for the majority of his occupational life.\n\nBorn into a ranching family, Rehberg left the farm to intern in the Montana state Senate. He was later employed as a legislative assistant to then-Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.).\n\nAfter a brief stint in D.C., he returned to his family ranch to focus his career on cattle, instead of constituents. Today, Rehberg is serving his second term in the House, occupying Montana’s at-large seat.\n\nRehberg and his wife, Janice, maintain ownership of the Rehberg Ranch Estates LLC and Rehberg Ranch Estates Marketing, which each have an estimated value between $5 million and $25 million. The ranch’s land and livestock operation are estimated between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nHis wife holds two assets: a family ranch estimated between $100,000 and $250,000, and a family farm estimated between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nAmong his liabilities, Rehberg listed a development loan valued between $1 million and $5 million and a livestock loan with an estimated liability between $50,000 and $100,000.\n\nThe couple also hold rental property in Montana, estimated to be worth between $50,000 and $100,000.\n\n23. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.),\n\n$10.3 million\n\nMaking a comeback on the list after a brief retirement is the New Jersey Senator who can credit large portions of his wealth to the company he co-founded with boyhood friends.\n\nThe company, Automatic Data Processing, specializes in automated payroll services.\n\nLautenberg reported more than $184,959 in retirement salary along with stock in the company worth between $5 million and $25 million. His total minimum assets were $10.29 million.\n\nAs he was preparing last fall to make his last-minute bid to replace then-Sen. Robert Torricelli as the Democratic nominee on the ballot, Lautenberg established two blind trusts worth between $1 million and $5 million apiece. He also claims a previous blind trust worth between $5 million and $25 million.\n\nThe lawmaker’s other assets include a condominium worth between $500,000 and $1 million in Vail, Colo. He also has investments between $205,000 and $550,000 in the Zaro Group at Bayon, a company with commercial real estate holdings in Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, as well as Kentucky, New Jersey and Wisconsin.\n\n24. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.),\n\n$10.1 million\n\nThe champion of campaign finance reform doesn’t mind maintaining a hefty bank account — he’s a stable member of the 50 Richest list.\n\nThe former presidential hopeful’s assets stem largely from the fortune of his wife, Cindy Hensley McCain, heiress to the Hensley liquor fortune. The family also holds investments in Anheuser-Busch valued at more than $1 million; King Aviation, also valued at more than $1 million; and between $100,000 and $250,000 in Fielder’s Choice LLC, whose major asset is the Arizona Diamondbacks professional baseball team.\n\nMcCain also reported receiving a pension from the U.S. Navy of $51,057 and two other income streams he donated to charity: $278,330 in book royalties from Random House, and $42,500 from Night Hawk Limited for film rights of “Faith of My Fathers.”\n\nAdditionally, Cindy McCain and the couple’s children are listed as the beneficiaries of an irrevocable trust valued at more than $1 million.\n\n25. (tie) Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.),\n\n$10 million\n\nWhile the Senator’s famous husband didn’t earn quite as much in speaking tours in 2002 as the previous year, former President Bill Clinton still raked in more than $8 million from speeches.\n\nWith 60 speeches ranging from $35,000 to $400,000, the former president is keeping the Senator comfortably on the list and working to pay off the $1.5 million remaining in legal fees stemming from impeachment, Whitewater and other investigations.\n\nThe Senator also brought in outside income during the year in the form of book royalties from Simon & Schuster. She earned more than $1 million from the company and also donated $1,237 in royalties from “It Takes a Village” to charity. The family maintains a blind trust worth between $1 million and $5 million and also has between $1 million and $5 million in Citibank deposit accounts.\n\nThe couple’s daughter, Chelsea, who is included in the financial disclosures as a dependent, holds small shares in several telecommunications companies, including Verizon, BellSouth, AT&T, Lucent Technologies and Comcast.\n\nNot included on Clinton’s financial disclosure forms are two multimillion-dollar homes — the Clintons’ residence in Northwest Washington purchased for $2.85 million and the couple’s Chappaqua, N.Y., residence, for which they paid $1.7 million.\n\n25. (tie) Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.),\n\n$10 million\n\nAlthough media sources have in the past pegged Dayton’s worth at about $20 million, this multimillionaire heir to the Target Corp. fortune disclosed a minimum of only about $4 million in assets on his 2002 financial disclosure forms — a good chunk less than the more than $5.5 million listed on his 2001 forms.\n\nDayton held a variety of jobs over the years before landing in the Senate: investment company president, runaway youth home director, science teacher and social worker.\n\nThe divorcee used $12 million of his personal funds to defeat then-Sen. Rod Grams (R) in 2000 and had no problem handing $100,000 over to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last year to help the organization purchase a Capitol Hill town house for its new headquarters.\n\nHe bought his own digs on Capitol Hill for $1.1 million in 2001.\n\nLast year, Forbes listed the Dayton family among the 40 richest in America, with an estimated fortune of $1.5 billion from the retail industry.\n\nHis largest assets include a qualified blind trust established in 1966 by his father, Bruce Dayton, valued between $1 million and $5 million and a Wells Fargo cash account holding between $1 million and $5 million. He also listed a number of other publicly traded holdings as part of another trust established in 1936.\n\n25. (tie) Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.),\n\n$10 million\n\nIt’s near impossible to make millions in public service, so it never hurts to bring the family fortune to the job.\n\nKennedy reports a large percentage of his assets from trust funds established in 1926 and 1936 by his father, Joseph Kennedy, who reached legendary financial success in everything from bootlegging to his tenure as a 25-year-old bank president. The funds, worth between $9 million and $55 million, earned the lawmaker anywhere from $2.2 million to $13 million in income last year.\n\nKennedy also holds several trusts that he established during the 1980s and ’90s worth around $1 million or less combined.\n\nIn the past year Kennedy sold several funds worth less than $1 million and also made small investments in four IRAs.\n\nThe Senator also lists as assets undeveloped land in Lafayette, La., worth between $100,000 and $250,000 and the copyrights to two books — “In Critical Condition” and “Our Day and Generation” — which brought the Senator no more than $200 each. In all, his total minimum assets exceeded $9.9 million.\n\n25. (tie) Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.),\n\n$10 million\n\nThe Associated Press dubbed Smith the “wealthiest Senator from the Pacific Northwest last year,” with him and his wife, Sharon, reporting between $9 million and possibly as much as $34 million in assets, thanks to his family’s frozen vegetable-packing fortune.\n\nStill, it was Smith who helped turn his family’s failing business into one of the largest and most successful frozen vegetable processors in the nation. It also made the former Mormon bishop a multimillionaire and helped him finance two Senate bids — a failed attempt against Sen. Ron Wyden (D) in a 1995 special election to replace disgraced Sen. Bob Packwood (R) and a successful run in 1996.\n\nSmith is majority owner in Smith Frozen Foods Inc., a packing and processing company run by his wife, who receives an undisclosed salary and director’s fees. He lists the investment as worth between $5 million and $25 million. A sister company, Smith Food Sales Inc., which sells vegetables, is worth another $1 million to $5 million.\n\n29. Rep. Gary Miller (R-Calif.),\n\n$9.9 million\n\nMiller continues to appear on the 50 Richest thanks to his early start in real estate development after dropping out of Mount San Antonio Community College in 1970.\n\nMiller was elected to the California state Assembly in 1995 and soon after defeated then-Rep. Jay Kim (R), a victory attributed to his personal campaign financing.\n\nIn 2002, Miller revealed more than $9.9 million in assets on his financial disclosure forms, with much of his fortune stemming from real estate in Riverside, Rialto and Diamond Bar, all in California.\n\nHis stock in General Electric is estimated between $250,000 and $500,000, while his Citibank investment is estimated between $100,000 and $250,000. Miller’s other stock holdings represent a variety of companies including American Airlines, Ford Motor, Intel, AT&T Wireless, Microsoft, Target, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nDuring 2002, he reported trading numerous shares in stocks including Kraft Foods, Lockheed Martin, Duke Energy, UnitedHealth Group, Wal-Mart and Toys “R” Us.\n\nMiller also serves as president of the G. Miller Development Corp.\n\n30. Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.),\n\n$9 million\n\nDole — a freshman Senator who needs little introduction — lands on the 50 Richest thanks in large part to her husband’s post-Senate endeavors. She and Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) are the only two freshman Senators on the list.\n\nBob Dole (R), the former Senate Majority Leader from Kansas, earned more than a million dollars from nearly two-dozen speeches he gave last year as well as undisclosed fees from consulting services he provided to 11 U.S. companies and one Hungarian company.\n\nHe also did work for several law firms and earned book royalties and freelance fees for op-eds and television appearances, including his promotion of one of Pfizer’s most popular drugs, Viagra.\n\nSen. Dole, meanwhile, reported only $120,000 in salary last year for serving as a director of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in Alexandria, Va.\n\nThe couple’s assets range from a minimum $8.5 million to $33.2 million and include stock in American Express, Coca-Cola, Hewlett-Packard and Kraft Foods as well as land in Kansas and partial ownership in a condominium near Miami Beach, Fla.\n\nTheir net worth represents a considerable increase in wealth since Bob Dole left the Senate. In his last appearance on this list in 1996, he ranked 46th with about $2.7 million.\n\n31. Rep. Jeb Bradley (R-N.H.),\n\n$8 million\n\nThis freshman lawmaker, a businessman and state legislator who represents New Hampshire’s 1st district, disclosed minimum assets of more than $7.9 million on his 2002 financial disclosure forms, making him the third freshman Representative on the list.\n\nHis largest assets are several trusts containing stocks and bonds held through the Wilmington Trust Co. Collectively these trusts — four of which are in the names of dependents — are worth more than $7.6 million.\n\nOther significant assets include an account that his wife, Barbara, has with Zurcher Kantonal Bank, valued between $250,000 and $500,000, and a condo in Wolfboro, N.H., from which the couple draw rental income.\n\n32. Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-N.C.),\n\n$7.8 million\n\nThis North Carolina Representative made his fortune in the company he founded, Plastic Packaging Inc., where he served as president for 40 years before becoming a Member of Congress in 1987.\n\nHe continues to earn money from the company through stocks, his wife’s undisclosed salary, and $20,000 each year in consulting fees for ongoing services to the company. He now serves as chairman at Plastic Packaging as well as a limited partner in three other companies: Associated Apartment Investors, Oak Plantation Associations and Dyco Petroleum.\n\nBallenger estimates his stake in Plastic Packaging to be between $5 million and $25 million. His wife, Donna, holds her own stock in the company, with an estimated value between $250,000 and $500,000.\n\nThe couple jointly hold rental property estimated between $300,000 and $600,000.\n\nBallenger’s stock investments include shares in Corning, Cisco Systems, Motorola, Pfizer, Tyco, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, Anheuser-Busch, IBM and Verizon. His wife’s stocks include shares in AOL Time Warner, Duke Energy, PepsiCo, BellSouth and Citigroup.\n\n33. Rep. David Dreier (R-Calif.),\n\n$7.5 million\n\nA former college administrator who later spent four years as the marketing and government affairs director for Industrial Hydrocarbons, Dreier is sitting pretty with several solid investments.\n\nThe Rules Committee chairman and Homeland Security Committee member has a $5 million to $25 million investment in Tiffany Major Ltd. in his birthplace of Kansas City, Mo., and he owns between $1 million and $45 million worth of stock in CBS/Viacom.\n\nHe also owns between $500,000 and $1 million worth of stock in the Oklahoma Publishing Co. and between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of stock in Gaylord Entertainment Co., which operates the Grand Ole Opry and the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville as well as radio stations and hotels in Nashville and Kissimmee, Fla.\n\n34. (tie) Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.),\n\n$7.1 million\n\nGraham’s father scaled the ladder from poverty to wealth thanks to his work as a dairy farmer and real estate investor. After graduating from Harvard Law School, Graham joined his father in his lucrative real estate adventures and together they developed the town of Miami Lakes, Fla.\n\nThe presidential hopeful’s disclosure forms show his fortune to be nearly equivalent to the numbers he reported last year. While he receives small pensions from both the Florida Department of Management Services and The Graham Co. Pension Plan, the vast majority of his wealth comes from real estate, land development and golf resorts in Dade County, Fla., estimated between $5 million and $25 million.\n\nHe also receives between $500,000 and $1 million from dairy and beef cattle in central Florida and south Georgia.\n\nHis wife, Adele, frequently trades stock in companies such as Best Buy, Cardinal Health Inc., Duke Energy, Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil, General Electric, Kraft Foods, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Staples, Texas Instruments, Target and Wells Fargo.\n\n34. (tie) Rep. Tom Petri (R-Wis.),\n\n$7.1 million\n\nPetri has stocks and bonds to thank for his continued place on the 50 Richest.

His other stock holdings include American Express, AT&T Wireless, BellSouth and SBC Communications.\n\nHe is a partner in Lloyd’s Underwriting Insurance Risks in London and the director of a Wisconsin-based mutual company, Society Insurance.\n\n36. Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.),\n\n$6.7 million\n\nThis well-heeled freshman lawmaker was an adviser to former President Bill Clinton and is a proven whiz at fundraising for public and private purposes.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, Emanuel returned to Chicago as managing director of the investment banking firm Wasserstein, Perella & Co. For 2002, he reported earning more than $9 million from his former employer in deferred compensations.\n\nPrior to his work in the White House, he had money-raising practice as political director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 1988 and as Chicago Mayor Richard Daley’s (D) chief fundraiser in 1989.\n\nEmanuel’s financial portfolio is dotted with stocks and bonds. Making up a large percentage are at least $1 million in Treasury notes and between $1 million and $5 million in a federal home loan bank note.\n\nOther investments include multiple municipal bonds, between $30,000 and $100,000 in the pharmaceutical company Mylan Laboratories and between $100,000 and $250,000 in Freddie Mac.\n\nThe father of three young children also holds at least $15,000 worth of stock in Toys “R” Us and at least $50,000 in Best Buy.\n\n37. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.),\n\n$6.5 million\n\nSensenbrenner revealed a fortune of $6.5 million this year, with only $25,000 of that coming as earned income from the Sensenbrenner Family Trust, for which he is trustee.

He also reported shares in Pfizer and Kimberly Clark between $500,000 and $1 million and three holdings with individual values between $250,000 and $500,000 in Abbott Laboratories, ExxonMobil and General Electric.\n\nSensenbrenner’s portfolio also includes more modest holdings, most in the $15,000 to $50,000 range, including shares in BellSouth, DuPont and WeEnergies. Other holdings include Sears, Roebuck and Co., General Motors, Comcast and AT&T Wireless.\n\n38. (tie) Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.),\n\n$6.3 million\n\nThe former Tuscaloosa, Ala., prosecutor makes a big leap up the list this year, nearly doubling his estimated net worth.\n\nAlthough he lost thousands of dollars in some of the more notorious corporate scandals in 2001, he managed to jump from No. 47 last year by minimizing his liabilities.\n\nShelby made substantial payments on outstanding mortgages on a Tuscaloosa apartment complex he bought in 1995. While he previously owed a minimum of $5 million in liabilities, he now owes a minimum of $1 million. The complex, valued between $5 million and $25 million, is his largest asset, earning the lawmaker between $100,000 and $1 million in 2002.\n\nHis share in Tuscaloosa Title Co. is Shelby’s second largest asset, valued between $1 million and $5 million.

He also holds an IRA annuity account and a Georgia municipal bond worth between $500,000 and $1 million each.\n\nHis wife, Diane, reports stock worth more than $1 million in Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe couple also own a variety of commercial and residential rental property — from housing in Minnesota and a Nine West store in Chicago to two land holdings in Nebraska valued at more than $1 million. The property that brings in the most rent is a residential rental in Washington, D.C., on Constitution Avenue worth between $100,000 and $250,000.\n\nNelson made a few transactions, selling three CDs and purchasing a few other CDs and bonds. But he has said that he doesn’t have time to watch the stock market as some day traders do.\n\n“I’m stuck with the same stocks,” he told The Associated Press last year. “I’m the one who watches [the market] more from a distance.”\n\n40. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.),\n\n$6.1 million\n\nOriginally from North Carolina, Maloney relocated to New York in her 20s to begin life after college.

Paul Gillmor (R-Ohio),\n\n$5.7 million\n\nGillmor reappears for his third time on the 50 Richest since the early ’90s, when he was an occasional member.\n\nWhile his fluctuations on and off the list are mainly due to the finances of his fellow lawmakers, Gillmor has expanded his business enterprises since first appearing in 1990. In 1991, he listed no organizational or business positions, but he now lists directorships of Gillmor Financial Services, Old Fort Banking Co., EZ Color Inc., Bayshore Leasing, DeNovo Corp. and the Paul M. Gillmor Co., a property and real estate firm. He is also a trustee on the Paul M. & Lucy J.

Anne Northup (R-Ky.),\n\n$5.5 million\n\nNorthup can thank bikers worldwide for keeping her on the list. The former school teacher and state legislator’s wealth comes mostly from her husband’s sound system company. The firm, Radio Sound Inc., specializes in sound systems for demanding environments — like zipping down the highway on a Harley-Davidson.\n\nHis stake in the company — the sole supplier of sound-system equipment to Harley-Davidson, according to its Web site — is valued between $5 million and $25 million.\n\nIn addition to her House salary and her husband’s salary, the couple report income between $1 million and $5 million from their stock in his company.\n\nThe couple also list small investments in Citigroup, Lowes, Pfizer, Tyco and less than $1,000 in Harley-Davidson.\n\n44.
