Very few bills are ever enacted — most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law. But there are other legislative activities that we don’t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services.\n\nWe consider a bill enacted if one of the following is true: a) it is enacted itself, b) it has a companion bill in the other chamber (as identified by Congress) which was enacted, or c) if at least about half of its provisions were incorporated into bills that were enacted (as determined by an automated text analysis, applicable beginning with bills in the 110th Congress).\n\nVoting Record\n\nMissed Votes\n\nFrom Jan 1977 to Oct 1992, Marlenee missed 871 of 8,199 roll call votes, which is 10.6%. This is much worse than the median of 4.4% among the lifetime records of representatives serving in Oct 1992. The chart below reports missed votes over time.\n\nWe don’t track why legislators miss votes, but it’s often due to medical absenses, major life events, and running for higher office.\n\nShow the numbers...\n\nTime Period Votes Eligible Missed Votes Percent Percentile 1977 Jan-Mar 100 5 5.0% 52nd 1977 Apr-Jun 273 30 11.0% 72nd 1977 Jul-Sep 198 24 12.1% 78th 1977 Oct-Dec 135 27 20.0% 93rd 1978 Jan-Mar 150 5 3.3% 29th 1978 Apr-Jun 300 21 7.0% 45th 1978 Jul-Sep 308 23 7.5% 50th 1978 Oct-Oct 76 28 36.8% 95th 1979 Jan-Mar 63 4 6.3% 64th 1979 Apr-Jun 221 27 12.2% 80th 1979 Jul-Sep 198 38 19.2% 91st 1979 Oct-Dec 190 3 1.6% 9th 1980 Jan-Mar 148 24 16.2% 81st 1980 Apr-Jun 197 14 7.1% 47th 1980 Jul-Sep 192 5 2.6% 20th 1980 Oct-Dec 67 17 25.4% 84th 1981 Jan-Mar 15 0 0.0% 0th 1981 Apr-Jun 90 9 10.0% 70th 1981 Jul-Sep 106 20 18.9% 93rd 1981 Oct-Dec 142 4 2.8% 22nd 1982 Feb-Mar 48 4 8.3% 59th 1982 Apr-Jun 119 13 10.9% 81st 1982 Jul-Sep 193 25 13.0% 82nd 1982 Oct-Dec 99 10 10.1% 57th 1983 Jan-Mar 43 3 7.0% 46th 1983 Apr-Jun 182 52 28.6% 98th 1983 Jul-Sep 130 4 3.1% 43rd 1983 Oct-Nov 143 12 8.4% 67th 1984 Jan-Mar 53 9 17.0% 83rd 1984 Apr-Jun 223 27 12.1% 79th 1984 Jul-Sep 96 18 18.8% 92nd 1984 Oct-Oct 36 0 0.0% 0th 1985 Jan-Mar 36 5 13.9% 77th 1985 Apr-Jun 154 17 11.0% 86th 1985 Jul-Sep 101 0 0.0% 0th 1985 Oct-Dec 148 29 19.6% 98th 1986 Jan-Mar 61 10 16.4% 81st 1986 Apr-Jun 128 8 6.2% 72nd 1986 Jul-Sep 202 16 7.9% 78th 1986 Oct-Oct 60 5 8.3% 73rd 1987 Jan-Mar 39 4 10.3% 79th 1987 Apr-Jun 187 13 7.0% 68th 1987 Jul-Sep 95 5 5.3% 65th 1987 Oct-Dec 167 14 8.4% 66th 1988 Feb-Mar 49 7 14.3% 86th 1988 Apr-Jun 161 12 7.5% 70th 1988 Jul-Sep 152 4 2.6% 33rd 1988 Oct-Oct 89 9 10.1% 81st 1989 Jan-Mar 14 1 7.1% 55th 1989 Apr-Jun 105 15 14.3% 94th 1989 Jul-Sep 128 14 10.9% 95th 1989 Oct-Nov 121 15 12.4% 90th 1990 Jan-Mar 60 8 13.3% 90th 1990 Apr-Jun 150 12 8.0% 82nd 1990 Jul-Sep 183 9 4.9% 70th 1990 Oct-Oct 143 7 4.9% 60th 1991 Jan-Mar 62 9 14.5% 92nd 1991 Apr-Jun 139 23 16.5% 97th 1991 Jul-Sep 81 18 22.2% 95th 1991 Oct-Nov 162 21 13.0% 94th 1992 Jan-Mar 66 7 10.6% 81st 1992 Apr-Jun 185 32 17.3% 91st 1992 Jul-Sep 196 14 7.1% 72nd 1992 Oct-Oct 41 3 7.3% 60th"
