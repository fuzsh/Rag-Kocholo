        "text": "President Reagan has vetoed legislation that would protect 1.4 million acres in Montana as pristine wilderness, setting off a debate about whether his action was politically motivated.\n\nThe legislation was vetoed even though it would have also opened four million acres of protected Federal land to development.\n\nMr. Reagan acted as he did because he wanted to put only half the 1.4 million acres into permanently protected wilderness status, said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. Wilderness areas are protected from any development and permanent human use.\n\nAs a result of the President's move, the entire 5.4 million acres reverts to a protected status and will remain so until Congress acts and the President signs a new bill designating how it should be used.\n\nThe veto is consistent with the Reagan Administration's longstanding policy of encouraging economic growth by promoting private access to public lands and their resources and opposing efforts to protect public lands.\n\nIn vetoing the bill Wednesday night, the President said he acted because the measure ''would injure the economy of Montana'' by eliminating jobs and ''vast mineral development opportunities.'' He said the legislation would also have hurt the ability of the Government to obtain strategic minerals needed for the military and industry.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
