Since retiring, Debbie has been an active volunteer for MTGOP, serving as the Office Manager at MTGOP Headquarters since 2019.\n\n“I am both excited and grateful that Debbie will serve the Montana Republican Party as its next Grassroots Director,” said Chairman Don “K” Kaltschmidt. “Debbie has been a reliable volunteer and strong supporter of what our Party does, and will be a tremendous asset to MTGOP in this new capacity by managing relationships with local party committees, helping build out our volunteer efforts, and maintaining engagement throughout the 2020 cycle.”\n\n“I look forward to fulfilling this new role and am grateful for the opportunity to serve our local party committees and help fellow Republicans at the ground level,” said Debbie. “We need a strong network of people working together who support the values and beliefs outlined in our Platform to elect Republicans in Montana in 2020.”\n\nDebbie is a graduate of the University of Montana School of Law and lives in Clancy with her husband, Terry, who retired from the Montana Army National Guard and Civil Service as a Blackhawk pilot and instructor, and her 13-year-old German Wire Hair Pointer, Maddie, who is a retired pheasant hunter. Debbie enjoys spending time with family and friends, gardening, traveling, boating, and camping.\n\n###"
