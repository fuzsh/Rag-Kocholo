        "text": "Last week, former Congressman and past Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus Chairman Ron Marlenee passed away at the age of 84.\n\nServing in the United States House of Representatives from 1977-1993, Marlenee served eight terms. He was a member of the House Agriculture Committee and the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. Marlenee was an avid outdoorsman, spending his free time hunting, fishing, skiing and camping. In the sporting-conservation community, Marlenee may be most well-known for his leadership in advocating for responsible natural resource development, Second Amendment rights, and multiple use of access to public lands. Marlenee’s wife, Cindy Marlenee, was also a past board member of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation’s Board of Directors.\n\n“The Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation is saddened to hear about the passing of former Congressman, lifetime outdoorsman and friend, Ron Marlenee. We are grateful for his leadership as a past Chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus,” said Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation President Jeff Crane. “We extend our condolences to Congressman Marlenee’s family and friends during their time of mourning.”\n\nStudies conducted at both the state and federal level have found that the number of hunters and trappers have been on a generally declining trend over the past several decades. To increase recruitment, retention, and reactivation (R3) of hunters and trappers, which initiative do you think would have the greatest impact?"
