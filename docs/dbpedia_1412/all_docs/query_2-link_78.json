        "text": "Building domestic stability and global influence through innovation\n\nSept. 13, 2023, at 1 p.m. ET\n\nHow can forward-looking and flexible federal policies unlock further groundbreaking technologies in agriculture? This is the topic of the upcoming Sept. 13 Agri-Pulse Communications, Inc. webinar, “Building domestic stability and global influence through innovation.” This complimentary one-hour program will discuss how new tools and technologies, like biological fertilizers, can boost profitability and increase sustainability and efficiency.\n\n“The event will be a great forum to discuss how the United States can be the world leader in agriculture technology,” says Agri-Pulse Founder Sara Wyant, who will moderate the event. “It’s especially timely with farm bill discussions underway. Members of Congress, as well as USDA officials, are looking for innovative ways to address conservation and climate challenges.”\n\nThe webinar will take place at 1 p.m. ET and is sponsored by Pivot Bio. Speakers will address how new innovations in agriculture can support domestic stability and open a new era of global influence for U.S. agriculture.
