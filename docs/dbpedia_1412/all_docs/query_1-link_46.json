        "text": "Editor’s note: This is one of 12 profiles featuring a candidate in Montana’s Second Congressional House District primary race. The profiles are being published daily over 12 days and in alphabetical order. Each of the candidates were asked the same questions.\n\nElsie Arntzen, perhaps more than any other candidate in Montana’s Eastern U.S. House race, stakes her political future on being a Republican culture warrior.\n\nShe’s fighting “the war on woke,” which means opposing any accommodations for gender fluidity, particularly in grades K-12. Arntzen has been Montana’s superintendent of public instruction for eight years. She opposes liberalizing Title IX, the federal law defining sexual discrimination in public education for the last 50 years.\n\nJudge blocks OPI from collecting some information from charter schools trying to open\n\nAnd she opposes a more comprehensive teaching of how race has shaped the United States. Critical Race Theory, which has never been taught in Montana K-12, is nonetheless denounced by the superintendent.\n\nMore than a few arrows have been shot Arntzen’s way. For example, the American Civil Liberties Union this April sued Arntzen’s Office of Public Instruction over the state’s law requiring parental notification of any discussion concerning anything sexual or gender related in public schools. The lawsuit was not only about the intent of the law, but also what the ACLU said was a lack of guidance to schools from Arntzen about how to put the law into practice.\n\nThere have been so many reported conflicts with superintendent that Arntzen began the interview for this article by simply crediting Lee Montana newspapers for spelling her name right.\n\nUndeniably, there is a core group of voters who share Arntzen’s points of view. They have rallied at the state Capitol more than once in shows of support. Arntzen said she is confident there are enough voters supporting her to secure a win in the Eastern District House primary, which is an eight-candidate race most likely to be won in a plurality with as little was 20% to 30% of the vote.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have had little success legislating culture conformity, including in the House where more moderate members of the majority have dismissed bill amendments concerning the war on woke as being counter productive when reconciling differences with the Senate's Democratic majority.\n\nIn person primary voting starts May 6 and finishes June 4.\n\n“Most definitely, the cultural war is very much a part of everybody's vernacular. It's not just an opportunity with a rural voter or rural constituent, or anyone that might live here in Yellowstone County. I firmly believe that it's threaded not just here in Montana, but when I talked to the Representative for Wyoming, Harriet Hageman, she's got the bill to remove the Department of Education,” Arntzen said. “She comes from a very rural state, by federal standards we’re frontier. The other aspect is, this is about freedoms and when we're talking about freedoms, you know, families are right there. The overreach of government hits everybody, whether it's at, I'll just say the kitchen table, when they're trying to impose their budget, inflation, or else you know, they get hit by any social media, that there's some sort of activity that is going to reduce their freedoms.\n\n“I was just sued by the ACLU in my official job because of parental notification on sexual instruction. I firmly believe that our children are being over sexualized, and this resonates. And what's important about Elsie is that this is something I'm passionate about. This isn't just something that I took a poll on, and I'm just going to go ahead and say the words, this is something that I have lived in my official world, as well as making sure that in my own family, my grandkids that are growing up in public school, and in our communities, that the barrage of everything that parents are getting hit with. I think the number-one thing that I do stand for, and it resonates, is that government does not own our children and they are our future. And I think voters appreciate that somebody is standing up for that next generation and we're the Treasurer State. So that means our treasures are our future. Those are our kids.”\n\nThis is Arntzen’s second campaign for U.S. House. She finished fourth in 2014, when Rep. Ryan Zinke won the primary and then the general election for Montana’s at-large district.\n\nThere was speculation in 2014 that Arntzen would use her personal wealth to boost her campaign. Elsie and her husband got in on the ground floor of the video gaming era in the 1980s and have done quite well. This election cycle Arntzen has loaned her campaign $700,000, making her one of the best financed candidates, Republican or Democrat.\n\nIn between congressional campaigns, Arntzen become the first Republican elected state superintendent of public instruction in 30 years, winning the office twice. Term limits prevent the Billings native from running for OPI a third time.\n\nQ&A\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge and place of birth: 67, Billings\n\nHome: Billings\n\nOccupation: Montana State Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nFamily: Married to my high school sweetheart, with two children\n\nEducation: Bachelor’s degree in education from Montana State University Billings and a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Montana.\n\nPast employment: Teacher in Billings for 23 years.\n\nMilitary: N/A\n\nPolitical experience: Elected to four terms (eight years) as a State Representative, and one term (four years) as a State Senator. After 32 years of Democrat control, I was the first Republican elected to lead the Office of Public Instruction as State Superintendent for two terms.\n\nEndorsements: Sen. John Fuller, Rep. Jerry Schillinger, and Rep. Lee Deming.\n\nWays voters can contact you:\n\na.) Email: info@elsiearntzen.com\n\nb.) Address: PO Box 5203 Helena MT, 59604\n\nc.) Phone number: 406-647-0815\n\nd.) Web page: www.elsiearntzen.com\n\nQ. Identify two national priorities that are part of your platform, explain your position on each and tell voters how you intend to address both. If there’s an existing bill you support to advance your position, please identify it.\n\n1. Border security: Our border is in crisis and our country is being invaded. I will partner with President Trump to finish the wall. Additionally, I want to enable border patrol to have all of the resources necessary to protect our country from the invasion. Border security is not enough. The number of illegal aliens that have unlawfully entered our country under Biden is six times Montana’s total population. We need to conduct the largest mass deportation effort in the history of our country.\n\n2. Parental Rights: I will continue to protect children and women's sports. The Biden administration wants to redefine Title IX to include individuals that are transgender. I will oppose any measure which allows biological males to participate in female sports. There are only two sexes: male and female. The Biden administration has pushed critical race theory and other toxic, woke ideology to re-write American history and destiny. In Congress, I will fight for parental rights and defeat the woke agenda with the same intensity as I have as state Superintendent of Schools.\n\nQ. Name two issues unique to the Eastern District that you will have to advance because no one else in the House will be familiar enough to do so. Explain how you’ll get the job done.\n\n1. Education: The Department of Education is not given authority by our U.S. Constitution. It has become a bloated department that is overrun with bureaucrats that target the rights of our parents and does not reflect the values of Eastern Montana. I will return the power of the choice in education to parents and the individual states. America must go back to a culture of delivering a quality education to our children, as opposed to indoctrinating them. I will partner with other members to eliminate the federal Department of Education.\n\n2. Land and property rights: As the longest-standing member of Montana’s Land Board, I have fiercely protected Montanan’s voice on personal property rights. I promise to reign in the overreaching rules and regulations of the Bureau of Land Management that inhibits access to recreation, grazing, and energy development. I do not want the federal government to turn Montana into nothing more than a national park. Montanans alone should decide how to use our land, water, and natural resources.\n\nQ.A rare earth minerals miner in Montana recently suggested that to sustain a domestic supply of metals essential to all things tech—semiconductors, batteries, advanced military equipment — Congress would have to act. Otherwise, China, which supplies about 80% of the rare earth minerals imported by the U.S., will continue the dominate supply. Consider the traditional basket of trade options — tariffs, subsidies, government purchases, federal leasing, and environmental laws — and suggest a policy approach to this challenge.\n\nMined in America, Made in America:\n\nAmerica’s national security is at risk due to Biden’s crippling regulations on rare earth mineral mining. These minerals are vital to American innovation, research, and prosperity. Currently, our nation imports the majority of critical minerals from Communist China and Chinese-influenced countries. These countries are not only hostile to America, they also have no environmental standards and use child labor. America can do better if the federal government gets out of the way, reduces unnecessary regulations, increases private sector investment, and allows federal leases for mining.\n\nQ. Explain how an import tariff consequential to sales of U.S. Corn and Soybeans to China affects the price of Montana’s top export ag commodity.\n\nAmerica First, China Last:\n\nAmerica must support Montana farmers and increase access to foreign markets other than China. Communist China has taken advantage of the American trade relationship for far too long. American companies are being robbed of their intellectual property and our farmers and ranchers are being unduly punished as a result. We must stand up to Chinese aggression while also ensuring our farmers can sell their products on the world stage.\n\nA. President Joe Biden has suggested “codifying Roe,” in other words creating a national right to abortion. Explain your position on this issue.\n\nLife is Precious: It’s very simple, without the right to life, all other rights are irrelevant. I am unequivocally pro-life and will oppose any measure that is a threat to life.\n\nQ. What role would you assign yourself as a member of a slim House majority? Would you get behind policies or leaders that 90% of your party supports to advance the preferences of your caucus? Or would you use your dissent as leverage to advance positions most of your caucus didn’t support?\n\nMontanans First: I am a Christian, conservative, Constitutionalist. As a 4th generation Montanan, my role will always be to fight for the Montanans I represent. I’ve served in the state legislature, and I know how to deliver real results for Montanans while standing up for our traditional way of life.\n\nQ. Would you have certified the electors from all 50 states as a member of Congress in 2021? Explain your decision while identifying any state whose electors you would have rejected.\n\nConfidence in our election process is critical for our republic. There were legitimate concerns with election integrity throughout the 2020 election process. Primarily, there were issues with the chain of custody for many mail-in ballots, which brought the security of election results into question. Therefore, I would not have certified electors in the 2020 election in several states including Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona because these states had the most egregious concerns.\n\nEditor’s note: This is one of 12 profiles featuring a candidate in Montana’s Second Congressional House District primary race. The profiles are being published daily over 12 days and in alphabetical order. Each of the candidates were asked the same questions.\n\nKyle Austin describes his first campaign for Montana’s eastern U.S. House district as a dry run.\n\nThe Havre native was up against at-large Rep. Matt Rosendale in the 2022 Republican primary for a district that hadn’t been on the ballot in 30 years. There was no pretending that Rosendale wasn’t the clear favorite, and Republicans certainly didn’t.\n\nThe Republican National Committee broke with its rule of not endorsing candidates in contested primaries and tapped Rosendale as its choice that February, despite Austin and two other Republican candidates registering for the race.\n\nRosendale didn’t bother to participate in the primaries that were broadcast on radio and featured the other Republicans marking arguments that didn’t land with voters. Rosendale won more than 75% of the vote. Austin finished second with 12.2% of the vote.\n\nFlashforward to the 2024 Republican primary, which features eight candidates and can be determined by plurality, and Austin isn’t such a longshot. Though improbable, the smallest possible percentage of the vote that could win the race is 12.5%. Recent plurality decisions in Montana primaries, including the Democratic House Primary in 2018 and the Republican primary in 2014, suggest the winning percentage will be closer to 20% or 30%.\n\n“Two years ago, I got my foot out there and got my name a little bit into the market,” said Austin who owns Pharm406 in Billings. “But it's hard running against an incumbent. But you know, I did that on purpose. It's like hey, there's going to be a day when Rosendale's running for the Senate. Or he's going to retire, and I might as well start getting my name out there.”\n\nAustin’s campaign finances don’t register, which is to say he’s neither spent, nor raised, the minimum $5,000 at which candidates must report their finances to the Federal Election Commission. The best funded candidates in the Republican primary, current Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen, and current State Auditor Troy Downing, have amassed $799,000 or more.\n\nWhat Austin has is a semitruck and a large trailer that sports a political advertisement.\n\n“I’m getting a little traction. I got a semi that’s like a mobile billboard. And when I take that to small communities, people love it. Because they know ‘hey, if I’m going to vote for a guy, who else drives a semitruck. This is our guy. He’s definitely supporting truckers. He’s definitely supporting fossil fuel use, and mining and farming.’ So, just driving that semi sends a message really about who I am.”\n\nAustin said he grew up on his grandfather’s farm near Havre, which Austin owns but currently leases out. Once he opened his Billings pharmacy, the trips to Havre to farm became impractical. But it’s his farming background and his years in healthcare that he said will attract voters.\n\n“Who represents Montana the most? Me, being a pharmacist, I've been highly involved in the state of health care in the last 15 years I’ve been a pharmacist, but the last three years pretty heavily in Yellowstone County, providing pharmacy services and understanding health care.\n\n\"And then the other percentage of voters for me, you know, it's who's going to represent Montana as a whole. And a lot of it's like I said, agriculture, none of the other candidates out there have the agricultural background that I do. And then if they understand how I can apply my business knowledge to that, it's understanding what trade impacts have in Montana, how to market their grains, how to sell it to the world.\n\n“When people actually start educating themselves, because I don't really think the public has been engaged too much in the congressional race, once they start looking at these candidates, they're going to be like ‘well Elsie Arntzen, she's screwed up our school system. And like I said, she's crazy. And then you got Troy Downing that's kind of been asleep at the wheel and not doing his job the last four years. If you really look at what he's done, and then start looking at the other candidates and the other candidates really, I don't think they shine too much.”\n\nAustin isn’t the only farmer in the Republican primary. Ric Holden farms near Glendive.\n\n“Agriculture is a huge part of Montana, as far as our industry, our backbone. A lot of small communities depend upon it. Trade depends upon it. And so having that background and knowing what farmers go through financially, how they work with the USDA, how they make their living, basically, they need someone that represents them in Congress,” Austin said.\n\n“And if they don't have someone who understands agriculture in the House of Representatives, who drafts the farm bill, they're not going to have as strong of a voice as someone like me, that understands what needs to be in that farm bill to support our farmers and ranchers when, let's say there's drought or there's a catastrophic event, but the other thing that a lot of people don't realize is a lot of our farmers and ranchers depend upon trade and how trade impacts the economy as well and the prices and it's not only just trading across the seas, but it's to our neighbors to the north.”\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge and place of birth: 41, Hill County, Montana\n\nHome: Billings and Havre\n\nOccupation: Pharmacist and farmer\n\nEducation: Doctor of pharmacy (PharmD), University of Montana in 2008\n\nPast employment: Pharm406, Inc. and Austin’s Grain, Inc.\n\nMilitary: None\n\nPolitical experience: Montana state Representative candidate in 2008, United States Congressional Candidate 2022\n\nEndorsements: None\n\nWays voters can contact you:\n\na.)

Identify two national priorities that are part of your platform, explain your position on each and tell voters how you intend to address both. If there’s an existing bill you support to advance your position, please identify it.\n\nWithout any improvement, immigration and illegal drugs have been unresolved in our country for decades. A wall on the southern border is only a band aid, however a necessary tool for our border security. America needs to send a message to the world that illegal immigration will not be tolerated. America needs to send a message to the world that illegal drug trafficking will face consequences. And, American needs to send a message to the world that America will be stronger than ever with our national security and the safety of our country.\n\nWe can all agree our healthcare system is broken, as major insurance company’s profiteer, our country goes without true affordable quality healthcare. Insurance companies fraudulently create contracts and rogue policies that steal from the consumer, deny medical necessity, and reimburse providers below the cost of goods and services provided. Health insurance is the problem with our healthcare in the United States. To fix this problem, I propose “The United States Health Plan Corporation” (USHPC). Your health is a plan, not insurance. USHPC will adjudicate all government and private plans. USHPC will consolidate programs to be more efficient and cost effective, create live billing and transparent reimbursement, eliminate deductibles and donut holes, and create a truly affordable plan with monthly premiums and copays for services.\n\nQ. Name two issues unique to the Eastern District that you will have to advance because no one else in the House will be familiar enough to do so. Explain how you’ll get the job done.\n\nAs a Montana native, born and raised on a farm, I understand Montana’s eastern congressional district very well. Eastern Montana can easily be coined as “the middle of nowhere,” thus causing unique challenges to our Native American friends and rural farmers and ranchers. As eastern Montana’s next congressman, it is important that we have a working farm bill and focus on improving our economic infrastructure. This can be accomplished by strengthening the FSA, removing banks from the lending process, allowing our farmers and ranchers to access low interest short-term operating loans, and end government bureaucracy.\n\nMontana needs to quash the Department of Environmental Quality, quash the Department of Labor, and put an end to Motor Carrier Services harassment without probable cause. We need to allow the building of more dams and reservoirs to irrigate our crops and water our livestock. We need to build feed lots and slaughterhouses to feed our communities with local meat, we need to build our own fertilizer production facility, we need to keep families on family farms, and we need to create quality paying jobs in our rural communities.\n\nQ. A rare earth minerals miner in Montana recently suggested that to sustain a domestic supply of metals essential to all things tech—semiconductors, batteries, advanced military equipment—Congress would have to act. Otherwise, China, which supplies about 80% of the rare earth minerals imported by the U.S., will continue the dominate supply. Consider the traditional basket of trade options—tariffs, subsidies, government purchases, federal leasing, and environmental laws—and suggest a policy approach to this challenge.\n\nAs a small business owner, I understand the struggles of red tape and the high costs of doing business in our country, this is why most industry has been outsourced to foreign countries. America needs to be self-efficient and not dependable on any foreign supplier. Currently, Beijing is not only the leader in the mining of rare earth minerals, but they are also the major refiner of these minerals. These minerals are the key to the future of our country and sustaining America as a world leader.\n\nCurrently America has plenty of mines for production, however, we have no refiner capable of refining these minerals to a final product within our country. The process of refining is expensive and environmentally hazardous due to chemicals used to separate and purify the metals to a final product. Our national security and the defense of our country is at jeopardy, it is imperative we relax the environmental laws, build the mining and refining industry, create high paying jobs, purchase only American made products and impose bans on importation. As your next congressional representative, I will put America first, defend our nation, support our economy, and end the rogue bureaucracy.\n\nQ. Explain how an import tariff consequential to sales of U.S. Corn and Soybeans to China affects the price of Montana’s top export ag commodity.\n\nAs a Montana farmer, I understand the economics of world trade. Import tariffs imposed by the United States in most cases will result in retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on American products. Since agricultural commodities are America’s largest export trade, other countries will impose retaliatory tariffs to hurt the American farmer. As other countries impose tariffs, farmers have no choice but to discount the commodities to be competitive in the world market. For example, in 2018, our administration imposed a tariff on steal and aluminum imports, as a retaliatory response, foreign governments imposed a retaliatory tariff on our agricultural commodities resulting in an estimated $13.2 billion annual loss to our agricultural industry. Other tariffs can be imposed by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and all tariffs can be accumulative, causing more consequences to ag exportation. As your next congressional representative, I feel its important you have a representative who understands the ag industry, understands the impacts of foreign policy, and puts the American farmer first.\n\nQ. President Joe Biden has suggested “codifying Roe,” in other words creating a national right to abortion. Explain your position on this issue.\n\nSince overturning case law, Roe v. Wade in 2023, abortion has been left to the decision of each state individually and has also left confusion among many women and health care providers regarding what is legal and what is not legal. United States Senators have since been trying to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act to “codify Roe” into federal law leading the way for women to have the choice and freedom in making their own health choices.\n\nIn my opinion, having abortion policy decided at a national level to create transparency and unity on human rights in all 50 states is ideal. Lawmakers need to make law that is clear, transparent, and fair to all Americans regardless of race, religion, or personal beliefs. We need to instill responsibility in our society and set consequences for those who abuse the system. To help unite America once and for all, I would support pro-choice national legislation only if it was very clear on when a women can or cannot have an abortion and very clear on how that abortion occurs. We need to create an offender registry for each abortion and create very clear consequences for people who are not responsible. The legislation also needs to clearly prohibit abortion as a form of birth control.\n\nQ. What role would you assign yourself as a member of a slim House majority? Would you get behind policies or leaders that 90% of your party supports to advance the preferences of your caucus? Or would you use your dissent as leverage to advance positions most of your caucus didn’t support?\n\nTo achieve what’s in our country’s best interest, I would stand with the Republican party to ensure we have an active, functional Congress. I will work hard to end the division and create unity among all congressional representatives. It’s time we overhaul our government, it’s time we unite our government leaders, it’s time we unite Americans, and it’s time we bring back duty, honor, and country to all Americans standard beliefs. United we stand, United we can.\n\nQ. Would you have certified the electors from all 50 states as a member of Congress in 2021? Explain your decision while identifying any state whose electors you would have rejected.\n\nUnfortunately, even though I disagreed with the election of President Biden, I would have had no choice but to certify the electors in all 50 states in 2021. The Constitution of the United States clearly defines the United States Electoral College and without substantial evidence or reason, it would have been impossible to reject any electors without violating our constitutional process. America endured a major setback the last the years, however America lived, America learned, and America will rebuild to a great nation once again.\n\nEditor’s note: This is one of 12 profiles featuring a candidate in Montana’s Second Congressional House District primary race. The profiles are being published daily over 12 days and in alphabetical order. Each of the candidates were asked the same questions.\n\nKen Bogner’s journey into politics started on a U.S. military base in Iraq. He was a 9-11 generation teen who enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating from high school in Miles City.\n\nOut in the desert, on one of his two combat tours, Bogner started thinking about geopolitics and how it was that a small-town Montana kid found himself in a foreign land where people were trying to kill him.\n\nBogner was a combat engineer. He served the Iraqi border with Syria which Iraqis were trying to flee into. He built traffic control points to slow refugees and give security patrols a chance to search for smuggled weapons and contraband.\n\n“I knew I wanted to do something. I didn’t know what,” Bogner, a two-term state legislator said. “Then my younger brother was wounded in Afghanistan.” Chris Bogner, also a Marine, had been critically injured by an improvised explosive device.\n\n“And my community, Miles City, stepped up,” Ken Bogner said. “They were sending care packages, started prayer chains, donated money, mowed my parents’ yard. I just felt so proud to be from Montana and Miles City. I wanted to give something back.\n\n“And I did a legislative session as an aide. And I was asked to run for office myself, and that’s how I decided to give back. So, I ran in 2018.”\n\nBogner skips several steps in the telling of his journey. He attended Columbia University, one of the best schools in the country, and studied international relations. He then earned a master’s degree in public policy from Middlesex University, in London.\n\nDuring his six years in the Montana Senate he was also a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in the 2020 primary. His running mate was fellow state Sen. Al Olszewski. Their ticket lost to Gov. Greg Gianforte and Lt. Gov Kristin Juras.\n\nBogner’s legislative record has an international and privacy tilt. He successfully carried a law to ban purchases of Montana farmland by China and other foreign adversaries. Lawmakers also passed a Bogner bill banning the government from using facial recognition software for surveillance. His “right to try” law aims to empower patients to try alternative treatments.\n\n“I’m the only candidate with both the military service and also the legislative experience, and there seems to be a lot of people who value that, especially with some of the bills I've passed,” Bogner said. “With the bill to prohibit foreign adversaries like China for buying our land. That's been very popular for the district as well as some medical bills that push back a little bit against the pandemic policies, which people seem to be very supportive of, as well as an election integrity bill and privacy rights bills that have passed. So, that experience of passing that comprehensive legislation has been very popular along with my military service district with a lot of veterans.”\n\nBogner travels his district campaigning in a 1966 Ford truck, which people in Eastern Montana seem to appreciate.\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge and place of birth: 37, Miles City\n\nHome: Miles City\n\nOccupation: Montana State Senator/military veteran outreach coordinator\n\nEducation: Columbia University\n\nMilitary: U.S. Marine Corps, 2005-2009 (Two combat deployments to Iraq)\n\nPolitical experience: Montana State Senator, Senate President Pro-tempore (2018-current)\n\nWays voters can contact you:\n\na.)

Identify two national priorities that are part of your platform, explain your position on each and tell voters how you intend to address both. If there’s an existing bill you support to advance your position, please identify it.\n\nOn my second deployment to Iraq while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, it was our mission to assist in securing the Iraq/Syria border. Iran was sending weapons into Syria to get smuggled across the border to be used on American troops. At the same time, refugees were flooding the border to escape the war. I have the experience of what it takes to secure a border. I will take these lessons to Congress to secure the southern border, stop the invasion of illegal immigrants, and eliminate the cartel’s massive drug trafficking operations.\n\nI passed the bill to prevent the government from spying on its citizens with facial recognition technology as well as the constitutional amendment to protect against illegal search and seizure of Montanan’s electronic data. The U.S. government should not be spying on Americans, we need policies protecting against the monitoring of our personal communications, bank transactions, firearm purchases, and tracking of our location. I will bring legislation and vote to repeal the current laws that do this.\n\nQ. Name two issues unique to the Eastern District that you will have to advance because no one else in the House will be familiar enough to do so. Explain how you’ll get the job done.\n\nI passed the bill in Montana to prohibit our foreign adversaries, such as China, from buying our land here in Montana. Congress has failed to do this. You have probably seen a lot of campaign ads talking tough on China but I am the only candidate that has actually done something about foreign land ownership in our communities. I have gotten it done here in Montana and will get it passed in Congress.\n\nI also passed the election integrity bill that prevents fraud by making every precinct in Montana subject to post-election audit. Election integrity is fundamental to our Republic. Our citizens must trust our elections; they need to know they are fair and the results are accurate. In Congress, I will bring legislation that gives states the tools to protect against fraud and provide confidence to the American voters.\n\nQ. A rare earth minerals miner in Montana recently suggested that to sustain a domestic supply of metals essential to all things tech—semiconductors, batteries, advanced military equipment—Congress would have to act. Otherwise, China, which supplies about 80% of the rare earth minerals imported by the U.S., will continue the dominate supply. Consider the traditional basket of trade options—tariffs, subsidies, government purchases, federal leasing, and environmental laws—and suggest a policy approach to this challenge.\n\nThe federal government must implement policies to protect against lengthy and frivolous litigation that makes mining unsustainable because of the costs of being tied up in court. Unfortunately, this is the tactic used by those who want all mining and mineral extraction stopped; this is weakening Montana, America, and hurting our miners. It’s time for that to end.\n\nQ. Explain how an import tariff consequential to sales of U.S. Corn and Soybeans to China affects the price of Montana’s top export ag commodity.\n\nTaxes raise prices for consumers, the higher the price for consumers the lower the demand. Lower demand results in lower profit and production.\n\nQ. President Joe Biden has suggested “codifying Roe,” in other words creating a national right to abortion. Explain your position on this issue.\n\nI am pro-life. I do not support “codifying Roe” or a national right to abortion and I will continue to support positions that protect life. I believe in Federalism and that the states should determine their own laws as much as possible and not the federal government.\n\nQ. What role would you assign yourself as a member of a slim House majority? Would you get behind policies or leaders that 90% of your party supports to advance the preferences of your caucus? Or would you use your dissent as leverage to advance positions most of your caucus didn’t support?\n\nI would assign myself the role as the representative of the people of Eastern Montana. I will be accountable to the people of Eastern Montana and the people of Montana want a government that puts America first and I will support policies that do that.\n\nQ. Would you have certified the electors from all 50 states as a member of Congress in 2021? Explain your decision while identifying any state whose electors you would have rejected.\n\nStates that had pending litigation with vote margins less than what is required for an automatic recount would not have received my vote for certification.\n\nEditor’s note: This is one of 12 profiles featuring a candidate in Montana’s Second Congressional House District primary race. The profiles are being published daily over 12 days and in alphabetical order. Each of the candidates were asked the same questions.\n\nFor 30 years, Ming Cabrera traveled across Montana as a pharmaceutical rep. What he learned along the way shaped his politics, making him the Eastern U.S. House district candidate that he is.\n\nThe Huntley Project native’s focus is equal parts health care, infrastructure, and agriculture. On the campaign trail, Cabrera said he listens. What voters are telling him is that there’s work to be done in all three areas.\n\n“The biggest thing right now in the rural areas, especially in the farming communities, is the Farm Bill. We need to know where we are going with the farm bill so we can plan our communities. Farmers say ‘where are we going to go with disaster insurance, or any farm insurance? If we plant this thing, are we going to be there, or are we going to rely on subsidies for the next two years, or the government to get us through tough times?’ A lot of people are waiting on that.\n\n“The other thing people are worried about is the closure of nursing homes and provider health care. It’s really low right now.”\n\nCabrera lives in Billings where has served in local government and run unsuccessfully as a Democrat in a reliably Republican state House district in Billings Heights.\n\nMontana is the nation’s sixth oldest state. As the Billings Gazette has reported, 11 rural nursing homes closed in 2022. The lost services weren’t just in rural areas. Last year, St. John’s United closed 60 nursing home units. Staffing shortages were a problem but so was Medicaid compensation for nursing home patients, an issue that requires action from Congress. About 70% of St. John’s United nursing home residents in Yellowstone County depend on Medicaid.\n\nCabrera also has infrastructure experience on the Billings Heights Water Board. He said there are water projects across Eastern Montana that need congressional attention.\n\n“There are some issues that I’m very well versed in because I’ve been on the water board. I know what’s going on in terms of what infrastructure is needed and where we’re having troubles in regard to paying for certain things out there,” Cabrera said.\n\n“And the rural water is so important and so is, let's say up in Saco, Montana, where they're having problems with their natural gas lines right now. They're so antiquated, they're going to have to do something. And so, these are the questions that need to come before the people in Montana. These other issues (national issues) are important, but these are the ones that really affect the people, the people that I know that they're hurting daily. And that's what they want to know. They said, ‘we’re they're telling you nobody really cares about us.’ And I want to tell people, ‘I do care, because these are the issues that they need to come to me and let me know, in my office once I'm in Congress, that I can work with, and I can help them try to get grants.”\n\nPolitical party: Democrat\n\nAge and place of birth: 65, Butte\n\nHome: Billings\n\nOccupation: Small business owner, retired restaurant owner, retired hospital sales representative\n\nFamily: Married to wife Digna for nearly 40 years, two grown children\n\nMing Cabrera\n\nEducation: Bachelor's of science in biology, Creighton University, then medical school for 2.5 years before returning to Montana following a family emergency.\n\nPast employment: Restaurant owner, small business owner, hospital and pharmaceutical sales\n\nMilitary: None\n\nPolitical experience: Past Chair Yellowstone County Democrats; Past Board Member of Montana Democratic Party; Past Chair of Billings Heights Water Board; Vice- Chair and Member of Billings Heights Water Board; Past Chair of Billings Heights Task Force; 2016 Legislative Candidate State Legislature House District 44\n\nEndorsements: Many healthcare providers, educators, and community members across the district.

If there’s an existing bill you support to advance your position, please identify it.\n\n1. Affordable healthcare: I strongly support policies that prioritize affordability and excellence in Montana’s healthcare system. The closures of nursing homes, rural hospitals, and the lack of mental healthcare access across the state highlight the need for immediate action to ensure access to essential services. Coupled with expansion of Medicare prescription drug coverage, these actions will alleviate financial burdens on our elderly and at-risk populations – and on the taxpayers footing the bill for expensive and preventable emergency care.\n\nWe must also empower healthcare providers to make decisions in the best interest of their patients, and stop asking them to spend their time negotiating with bureaucrats who hold the purse strings.\n\n2. Farm bill 2025: The Farm Bill has faced many recent legislative hurdles, from insufficient votes to pass the House floor to delays in short-term extensions with no markups or legislative action. Agriculture is vital to Montana's economy, and it is imperative that our communities be able to plan their futures. Features like crop and disaster insurance, appropriations for SNAP, and farm commodity and dairy programs make inconsistent government policies an unacceptable problem. We need a solid, consistent Farm Bill, and we need it now.\n\nQ. Name two issues unique to the Eastern District that you will have to advance because no one else in the House will be familiar enough to do so. Explain how you’ll get the job done.\n\nThe Worden-Ballantine Water and Sewer District will begin construction on four new groundwater wells to meet water standards with federal, state and county directed funding. However, new distribution lines connecting the new water wells are needed. The funding for six miles of updated pipe needs to be granted through DNRC funding or another source to complete this project. Any grants or funding must be approved by the board that submits the proposal. I can make sure federal funds provide the safe water necessary for Ballantine and Worden area. My goal will be to follow through on this project for the district.\n\nThe Medicare Modernization Act has barred the U.S. government from directly negotiating with drug companies to lower prices. This has caused the federal government to pay more for Medicare drugs than for drugs purchased through other federal program such as the VA, Department of Defense, Medicaid, and private health insurers. This must be changed, and we must establish a formulary for Medicare plans. My experience working with these systems in my decades-long career in hospital sales makes me the best candidate to negotiate a better deal for Montanans on the prescription drugs we need to live, and live well.\n\nQ. A rare earth minerals miner in Montana recently suggested that to sustain a domestic supply of metals essential to all things tech —semiconductors, batteries, advanced military equipment — Congress would have to act. Otherwise, China, which supplies about 80% of the rare earth minerals imported by the U.S., will continue the dominate supply. Consider the traditional basket of trade options — tariffs, subsidies, government purchases, federal leasing, and environmental laws — and suggest a policy approach to this challenge.\n\nIt is a fact that China has most of the rare earth minerals needed to continue a domestic supply of essential metals and must be imported until our natural resources can start the process to mine what we know is available in Utah and Wyoming. Congress needs to act by loosening import tariffs for these metals. A fair deal would allow our Montana farm products such as pulse products, livestock and wheat exports to China be part of a trade agreement in the Farm Bill so we can trade our agricultural products for these essential metals lowering restrictions on a tariff trade-off.\n\nAnother possibility is for areas known to contain these valuable minerals on federal land to provide these resources, but only when they can be accessed without destruction to the environment. These new mines on federal land must abide by DEQ and DNRC regulations and strict standards; our wild spaces are too important to our culture and economy to trade for quick access to resources that can be obtained through trade relationships that will greatly benefit Montana's farmers and ranchers.\n\nQ. Explain how an import tariff consequential to sales of U.S. Corn and Soybeans to China affects the price of Montana’s top export ag commodity.\n\nMontana's agricultural communities know what happens when unreasonable tariffs restrict imported products like steel and factory goods, causing other countries to retaliate on agricultural exports. The government, and American taxpayers by extension, were forced to subsidize farm products because the restrictions resulted in both oversupply and loss of trade with foreign counterparts. Montana tried mitigate this problem by exporting our products through Canada because they had favorable pricing due to lower tariff barriers. However, the standards for Montana wheat and pulse products were graded differently under Canadian Standards resulting in costs that were not favorable to the Montana farmers. Clearly, the \"tariff wars\" have harmed our agriculture communities, and will continue to do so for as long as they stand. The Farm Bill due to be passed in 2025 has to potential to solve this problem, and will be vital to the sustainability of small farms and communities to survive and plan their crop productions.\n\nThat's why the Farm Bill is one of the most important parts of my platform; we must ensure that our farming community is well represented. As your Congressman, I will make sure the voices of our agricultural communities are heard, loud and clear.\n\nQ. President Joe Biden has suggested “codifying Roe,” in other words creating a national right to abortion. Explain your position on this issue.\n\nAs a degree holder in biology with years of experience in the medical field, my stance on reproductive rights is shaped by academic and professional knowledge as well as compassionate humanity and humility. As a medical student in the Philippines, I witnessed the devastating consequences of restrictions on reproductive freedom, where women faced life threatening situations and the loss of both maternal and fetal lives. It is not the governments' role to pry into our private medical records or to make moral decisions about woman’s healthcare. I firmly believe that women are perfectly capable of making these deeply personal decisions for themselves, and as a candidate for public office, I am committed not only to opposing any legislation that would limit a woman’s right to choose, but also to actively supporting measures that codify this fundamental right to medical privacy and reproductive freedom once and for all. Everyone deserves the autonomy to make decisions about our own bodies no matter what kind of anatomy they were born with, and it is my pledge to stand firm in ensuring that this right is protected and upheld.\n\nQ. What role would you assign yourself as a member of a slim House majority? Would you get behind policies or leaders that 90% of your party supports to advance the preferences of your caucus? Or would you use your dissent as leverage to advance positions most of your caucus didn’t support?\n\nI'm sure your readers can agree that the past several years have been frustrating, and that this has been the most unproductive Congress since the Civil War. We saw seven dissent voters prevent the passing of the vital Farm Bill while calling for continued resolutions that pushed our country to the point of not paying our bills. Frankly, Montana's voters deserve better. Congress needs to work through compromise and use the ability to talk to people across the aisle. It is rare that any member of Congress receives all they ask for without some type of give and take, but many of our current representatives simply lack the emotional maturity to understand this basic fact of life.\n\nWhile I am sure that I will dissent during moments of significant importance and will not follow the House caucus on bills that would harm Montana, I strongly believe that these moments of dissent ought to stand out as exceptions to the rule used to draw special attention to important issues. On all other days, I will respect the honor of the office I've been elected to and work cooperatively with my colleagues – as long as doing so benefits the people of Montana.\n\nQ. Would you have certified the electors from all 50 states as a member of Congress in 2021? Explain your decision\n\nAs a firm believer in questioning authority and demanding clear evidence whenever possible, I understand that it is essential to uphold skepticism and critical thinking in all aspects of life. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that despite any suspicions or doubts, no credible evidence has surfaced to suggest that anyone other than the current sitting president legitimately won the 2020 election. As a responsible citizen, I would have dutifully certified the electors from all 50 states. To refuse to do so, especially when faced with irrefutable evidence of credibility, amounts to nothing short of sacrificing our country's integrity as a democracy solely for political gain and cheap headlines. Upholding the principles of democracy, fairness, and the rule of law should always take precedence over partisan interests or personal agendas, safeguarding the foundation upon which our nation thrives.\n\nArntzen brings culture war to U.S. House race\n\nPharmacist Austin brings medicine, farm background to House primary\n\nKen Bogner cites his military and legislative background in House race\n\nEditor’s note: This is one of 12 profiles featuring a candidate in Montana’s Second Congressional House District primary race. The profiles are being published daily over 12 days and in alphabetical order. Each of the candidates were asked the same questions.\n\nJohn Driscoll had promised his wife he wouldn’t run again for Congress unless she asked him to. It wasn’t that he hadn’t been successful in his previous runs.\n\nIn 2008, the Helena man pulled a surprising upset in the Democratic primary for Montana’s at-large U.S. House seat. Driscoll not only defeated Jim Hunt but did so with only a couple hundred dollars.\n\nFour-term incumbent Republican Rep. Denny Rehberg then defeated Driscoll soundly in the general election, taking 64% of the vote. Rehberg was a well-known commodity, with folksy anecdotes that stuck with voters, like his promise to sleep on his office couch rather than get too comfortable in what these days is known as the D.C. swamp.\n\nAgain, this year Driscoll got that campaign itch after attending the Montana Democratic Party’s big to-do, the “Mansfield Metcalf Dinner.” He decided he wanted to run for Montana’s Eastern U.S. House District. The problem was, Kathy, his wife, hadn’t asked him to.\n\n“So, she gets up one morning, I say to her, ‘Hey, in case you asked me to run for office, here's what I would say.’ And she goes, ‘No, no. She was so (ticked) off at me. She says, ‘Well, where are you going to sleep?’ And I said ‘well, I’ll sleep in my office like Rehberg did.’ And she says, ‘No. Where are you going to sleep tonight?' ”\n\nKathy Driscoll tells her husband she’s voting for Democrat Ming Cabrera. Her husband, a retired Montana National Guard colonel, a three-term state legislator and former speaker of the state House, as well as a twice elected member of the Montana Public Service Commission, hasn’t won her vote.\n\nJohn Driscoll said he is concerned about the state of democracy and the chaos in the U.S. House that has made governing impossible. Montana’s eastern district representative, Republican Matt Rosendale, is a part of the problem Driscoll said. Last November, Rosendale joined seven other Republicans in ousting Republican House Speaker Rep. Kevin McCarthy, in a vote that required the hardliners to draw support from the entire Democratic caucus. Most Republicans rallied around McCarthy unsuccessfully.\n\nRosendale isn’t seeking reelection after four years in the House.\n\n“I think people like Rosendale, I started calling him Knight No. 2. Knight number one is Rep. Matt Gaetz, Knight No. 3 is Rep. George Santos. It’s the Knights of the creepy brotherhood,” Driscoll said. “Really, what those guys are about, they’re saboteurs. They are sabotaging the constitutional basis for our legislative branch.\n\n“I’m interested in trying to re-establish that whole normal way of doing business, where you can appropriate for a fiscal year and get ready for the next fiscal year, instead of having continuing resolutions. The last time we had a smooth operation was 12 years ago. I want to get back to that because I see both by their actions, what they say, what they’re doing with what’s his face from Ohio, Jordan. They’re making a joke of it.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, where he has pursued several impeachment investigations that haven’t yielded results.\n\nNormal direction from House committee chairmen should center on listening to lawmakers’ concerns and resolving conflicts before its time to vote on bills, Driscoll said, particularly the bills the comprise the federal budget. The Helena resident said he learned as a leader in the Montana Legislature in the 1970s how to resolve differences and never to force lawmakers to vote a particular way.\n\nOne point of disagreement Driscoll has with many Montana Democrats is a need for nuclear power, which Driscoll said would be a preferred alternative to fossil fuels. Montanans, who have lived with nuclear missiles on the northcentral plains for decades, should be better served by nuclear material as an energy source. He also advocates for a nuclear waste storage facility.\n\n“My thing is, I prefer a high-level waste repository, well done, much more than having 150 missiles here. I mean, North Dakota and the others can have all they want as long as they stay downwind,” Driscoll said.\n\nDriscoll is conducting a low-dollar campaign. He hasn’t raised or spent to the $5,000 threshold at which the federal government requires candidates to report finances. His expenses through March amounted to $128.55, including $20 spent on a Democrat hat (blue).\n\nJohn B Driscoll\n\nDemocrat\n\nAge and place of birth: 77, Los Angeles, California\n\nHome: 30 South Davis Street, Helena, MT 59601\n\nOccupation: Retired\n\nFamily: Wife, Kathryn, and four children and six grandchildren.\n\nEducation: Bachelor's degree Gonzaga University, Spokane; Master's degree Columbia University, New York City; MPA-Harvard University; MBA-University of Montana, Graduate School of Business.\n\nEmployment: U.S. Forest Service, forest worker; wildlands firefighter and smokejumper\n\nMilitary: Commissioned Second Lieutenant, Gonzaga ROTC, entered active duty August, 1970; Served in the 14th MI BN (CONTIC) of 18th Airborne Corps in support of the 3rd SF Group and the 82nd Airborne Division.

If there’s an existing bill you support to advance your position, please identify it.\n\nPriority 1: Resist and defeat any bill that assaults our constitutional democracy.\n\nPriority 2. Work collaboratively to get budgetary processes of Congress back to normal.\n\nQ: Name two issues unique to the Eastern District that you will have to advance because no one else in the House will be familiar enough to do so. Explain how you’ll get the job done.\n\n1. Lay the groundwork necessary for making compressed agricultural fiber panels made from Montana straw for inclusion with other carbon sequestering building materials like cross-laminated timber and mass timber for the new carbon architecture of our built environment. This effort will amount to more than individual farmers working with their Natural Resource Conservation Service districts to make the business decision of keeping carbon sequestered under the ground or supplying manufacturing facilities. This effort will include siting enough green hydrogen electrolysis facilities around Montana to fuel Class 8 gathering and delivery trucks and hydrogen-electric locomotives transporting product to building sites. Given the general shortage of affordable housing, this effort will need to include long-term leasing of federal lands for large multi-family housing complexes to be leased for limited equity dwelling units near existing communities. I’ve been working for more than three years to understand critical aspects of this affordable housing response to climate change.\n\nIssue 2: Lay the groundwork necessary for replacing coal-fired electricity generation with nuclear generated electricity. Rather than kick the high-level waste disposal can down the road as has been done so far in every nation except Finland, I am asking Montanans to open their minds to locating a high-level nuclear waste disposal facility somewhere in Montana, an area 17,000 square miles larger than the country of Finland. We have the earth sciences expertise and may be able to create a facility that will generate income and state revenue. During the 12 years I served as a Montana Public Service Commissioner and as an advisor to the Electric Power Research Institute, I was educated in aspects of the nation’s electricity grid, alternative means of electricity generation and the problems associated with nuclear power.\n\nQ. A rare earth minerals miner in Montana recently suggested that to sustain a domestic supply of metals essential to all things tech—semiconductors, batteries, advanced military equipment—Congress would have to act. Otherwise, China, which supplies about 80% of the rare earth minerals imported by the U.S., will continue the dominate supply. Consider the traditional basket of trade options—tariffs, subsidies, government purchases, federal leasing, and environmental laws—and suggest a policy approach to this challenge.\n\nThe most likely rare earth development in Montana will be in the upper Bitterroot Valley around Sheep Creek with which I am familiar. As the development advances or falters, I believe we have to plan as though it will be another Butte, Montana, which was sited in a high mountain valley in one of the most pristine areas of the Northern Rockies.\n\nWe have to learn from what happened and what is still happening in Butte and do our best to avoid another Montana place becoming a national sacrifice area. If our nation faces the challenges of climate change, the rare earth development in western Montana could become massive.\n\nI am a fifth-generation Butte person, but as importantly, I served in the Montana Legislature in the early 1970's and actively participated in the Legislative effort to prepare for the massive Fort Union coal development. We had to address a plethora of issues such as water protection, pristine air protection, land reclamation through a drought cycle, funding of schools, libraries, and roads, severance taxation and saving some of the revenue from the resource in a Constitutional Coal Tax Trust Fund.\n\nImportant questions similar to all of these will be in play during the rare earth developments. The primary institution for equipping our towns, cities, counties and state for dealing with such a development is the Montana Legislature. I’m hopeful that our state legislature will follow the Montana Constitution and create conditions for Montanans to talk to each other about their real world concerns. Having also called the Bitterroot Valley my home for 20 years after living in Butte, Billings and Miles City, I’ll be seeking opportunities in Congress I to lay the groundwork for wisely paced development.\n\nQ. Explain how an import tariff consequential to sales of U.S. corn and soybeans to China affects the price of Montana’s top export ag commodity.\n\nIt’s not yet clear which crops farmers along the lower Yellowstone River will grow now that Sidney Sugars is being auctioned. However, the majority of Montana agriculture happens in Eastern Montana and until recently the leading crops were wheat, hay, barley, sugar beets and legumes. At one time tariffs on trade might be seen as a non-violent tool of conflict between two nations like the United States and China, but that is no longer true because trade balances are a global matter. When China imposes an import tariff on corn and soybeans from the United States, it is likely to decrease demand for U.S. agricultural products, leading to a surplus of those crops on the market. As farmers of those products seek alternative markets they could go after markets previously enjoyed by Montana’s wheat exports. The forced increase in competition for these markets will lower prices for Montana wheat exports because of supply and demand.\n\nQ. President Joe Biden has suggested “codifying Roe,” in other words creating a national right to abortion. Explain your position on this issue.\n\nI would vote for codifying the standards women came to expect during the years that Roe v. Wade was effectively the law of the land. It’s not acceptable for members of a Catholic community, like myself, to impose the standards I’ve internalized on a woman who is not in that community, or facing a situation I may not understand and will certainly never face. The wonderful women in my life all deserve the personal freedom to make a choice free of government or religious interference.\n\nQ. What role would you assign yourself as a member of a slim House majority? Would you get behind policies or leaders that 90% of your party supports to advance the preferences of your caucus? Or would you use your dissent as leverage to advance positions most of your caucus didn’t support?\n\nMy experience as a legislator and as a legislative leader places a premium on listening to the arguments of my fellow legislators in conditions created by a competent leadership for open discussion. In my time as a House Majority Leader not one member of our Democrat Caucus was ever forced to support a bill. I was mentored and found that it was better to listen most of the time and some of the time to suggest ways for differing points of view to meet in a dialogue. If I’ve changed at all, it’s from being older and wiser. It’s amazing to see the range and number of issues that a group of human beings organized into a legislature can thoroughly address. In my experience there was not the same degree of influence by interest groups through campaign contributions as there is now in our U.S. Congress. I’m sure that more patience will be required to study the real reasons for a legislator’s intransigence.\n\nQ. Would you have certified the electors from all 50 states as a member of Congress in 2021? Explain your decision while identifying any state whose electors you would have rejected.\n\nI’ve always been impressed by the diligence applied by state and local election officials and have no reason to believe their counterparts in other states are not as diligent. I find it hypocritical when elected officials claim to not trust the outcome of an election for the President of the United States by votes from the same election system that chose them. I would have had no problem certifying all electors from all states in 2021.\n\nNot long after Kevin McCarthy became the first House Speaker in history to be voted out of the job, Troy Downing arrived at the Capitol to get the lay of things, in hopes of returning as Montana’s Eastern District representative in 2025.\n\nCongress was pretty chaotic. Lawmakers had ended a budget impasse in the final hours of September by agreeing to just enough funding to keep the government fully operating into early November. It took Democratic votes to keep the government funded, and those votes cost McCarthy his job as eight hardline Republicans collaborating with Democrats ousted a speaker the majority of the Republican caucus wanted to keep.\n\nIt would be another five months before the House managed to pass a bill to keep the government running for more than a few weeks at a time.\n\n“It was dangerous. I mean, I understand people were frustrated. We’re all frustrated. People were not working nice together,” Downing said. “We’ve got some big problems. I mean one of our big problems is we have just out-of-control spending. And nobody is actually sitting around the table, rolling up their sleeves, and finding solutions everybody can get behind. It’s all this fighting.\n\n“I think the problem is, you need to think of it like a football game. If you’re going into the game thinking you’re going to win with Hail Marys, you’re never going to win. You got to do two things. You got to work as a team, you know, get the ball down the field in small plays, keep going the right direction, and don’t tackle your own teammates.”\n\nThe chaos brought about by McCarthy’s ouster can be a touchy subject in Montana, in part because U.S. Rep. Matt Rosendale is one of the eight Republican who brought McCarthy down, while Western Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke voted against vacating the speakership.\n\nHardline Republicans are once again threatening to vote to oust their own speaker, but Montana’s delegation has said very little about the subject.\n\nDowning, currently Montana’s state auditor, is one of the two statewide elected officials campaigning to replace Rosendale, who isn’t seeking reelection. Auditor is bit of a misnomer that previous office holders have attempted to change to securities commissioner or insurance commissioner. The experience of regulating financial services is something Downing would like to apply in the House. He’s also a combat veteran interested in regulating the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThere are signs that Downing has favorable odds for the winning the race. He leads the 8-candidate Republican primary in fundraising with slightly less than $1 million. He also has the most donations from individual contributors, a good sign that people are buying into his campaign. Roughly 150 of his contributions involve transactions with Montanans, more than any other Republican candidate.\n\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen is the other statewide elected official in the race. Both candidates serve on the state land board, which manages revenue from Montana property. Everything ranging from livestock grazing and cabin leases to oil and gas drilling and timber harvests comes before the land board if the activity takes place on state land.\n\nBeing on the land board is the closest thing to making decisions like those made by the federal Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service. The federal government is Montana’s biggest landowner. The state’s members of Congress are always mindful of federal land policy, though there has never been a representative with state land board experience.\n\n“The really big thing is that we just need to make sure that we are diligent about requiring some bond, of some fund that’s going to make sure that any damage committed is reclaimed and dealt with. I think that’s good policy,” Downing said. “I think it’s good for Montana. I’ve always been on energy, just all of the above. Level the playing field and let the markets figure out what’s going on.\n\n“Montana, oil gas and coal are a big part of our energy reserves and it’s going to be for a long time. That’s great, but that doesn’t mean you don’t allow people to innovate. We always need to be open to innovation and let the markets decide what wins.”\n\nQ&A\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge and place of birth: 57, Indio, California\n\nHome: Helena\n\nOccupation: Montana State Auditor and Commissioner of Securities and Insurance\n\nFamily: Wife, Heather, and four adult children\n\nEducation: New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences: research scientist, instructor\n\nPast employment: Founded a technology startup that merged with Yahoo Inc. in the 1990s.

Elected statewide.\n\nWays voters can contact you:\n\na.) Email: press@troydowning.com\n\nb.) Address: PO Box 322 Helena, MT 59624\n\nc.) Phone number:\n\nd.) Web page: www.troydowning.com\n\nQ. Identify two national priorities that are part of your platform, explain your position on each and tell voters how you intend to address both. If there’s an existing bill you support to advance your position, please identify it.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to secure the southern border. Joe Biden's open border policies have allowed record numbers of unvetted illegal immigrants to cross into our country. Lethal drugs like fentanyl are pouring across the border and poisoning our communities. I have visited the border myself and have seen the crisis the Biden Administration has caused. It must end. On day one, I will support legislation, like H.R. 2, which will shut down the border. I will lead the fight to finish Trump's wall, deport illegal immigrants, and give our brave men and women in the\n\nU.S. Border Patrol the resources they need to stop the catastrophe at our southern border.\n\nI will also work with President Trump to fix our broken economy. Under President Trump, we had record-low unemployment, low inflation, and job growth. Joe Biden and radical Democrats in D.C. have ruined our economy with out-of-control wasteful spending and a war on American energy. I will fight for tax cuts for everyday Americans, will push to slash reckless spending, and push policies that will promote American energy. We will get our fiscal house in order and unleash the American economy once again.\n\nQ. Name two issues unique to the Eastern District that you will have to advance because no one else in the House will be familiar enough to do so. Explain how you’ll get the job done.\n\nBiden’s porous southern border is hurting Eastern Montana. These problems are not only in our population centers but in rural areas and tribal communities as well. We are seeing our law enforcement officers run ragged dealing with fentanyl-related crime and cartel-style gangs on our streets. None of our communities are immune to these problems.\n\nI have flown counter-drug missions near the southern border. I have visited the “boots on the ground” at the border and am best equipped to deal with the influx of bad actors.\n\nInflation and labor supply shortages are hurting our Eastern Montana agricultural communities, our natural resource communities, and small businesses.\n\nThe costs of inputs have increased dramatically. This exacerbates other issues that affect our farmers and ranchers. Our oil and gas producers are struggling to find employees. Nearly every small business is struggling with the cost of goods, rising rents, and a thin labor market.\n\nI have enjoyed success in the private sector. We need folks that have not only signed the front of a paycheck, but, who have also had to refinance, raise capital, deal with heavy-handed regulators, and built something out of nothing. We must also stop incentivizing people not to work.\n\nQ. A rare earth minerals miner in Montana recently suggested that to sustain a domestic supply of metals essential to all things tech—semiconductors, batteries, advanced military equipment—Congress would have to act. Otherwise, China, which supplies about 80% of the rare earth minerals imported by the U.S., will continue to dominate supply. Consider the traditional basket of trade options—tariffs, subsidies, government purchases, federal leasing, and environmental laws—and suggest a policy approach to this challenge.\n\nMuch like our reliance on foreign adversaries for our energy needs, our dependence on China for rare earth minerals is a threat to our national security. We must unleash American production of our natural resources, both in regards to energy and rare earth minerals. We must cut through unnecessary red tape to direct the federal government to work with the US energy industry to increase domestic production.\n\nI strongly support Rep. Rosendale's \"Restore Onshore Energy Production Act\" which passed the U.S. House last year as part of the \"Lower Energy Costs Act.\" This proposal would direct the federal government to resume lease sales for energy resource development and streamline federal permitting processes, allowing American companies to increase energy and mineral production.\n\nI also strongly support the \"HARD ROCK Act,\" legislation co-sponsored by Sen. Steve Daines. This bill would direct the federal government to expand its stockpile of critical minerals. It would also direct the federal government to work with our allies and the private sector to develop new supply chains for rare minerals. Further it would direct the government to expand domestic production of rare minerals at locations that have already been identified. I will be a leader on this issue.\n\nQ. Explain how an import tariff consequential to sales of U.S. Corn and Soybeans to China affects the price of Montana’s top export ag commodity.\n\nMontana’s farmers and producers are an important and critical sector of our state’s economy, many of whom rely on corn and soybean exports to make a living. They have long been targeted and harmed by China’s unfair trade practices. In Congress, I will do everything in my power to protect Montana agriculture and our exports of corn and soybeans. I will undertake efforts like Sen. Daines, who successfully secured lower Indian tariffs on American crop exports. We must both stand up to our adversaries while supporting American farmers and producers.\n\nQ. President Joe Biden has suggested “codifying Roe,” in other words creating a national right to abortion. Explain your position on this issue.\n\nI am unapologetically pro-life and would vote against any attempt to create a national right to abortion. The Supreme Court was correct when they pointed out that the Constitution did not afford a right to abortion, thereby putting that upon the states.\n\nJoe Biden pushing for a national right to abortion, including late-term abortions, is another example of Democrats trying to push their radical liberal views on the rest of the country. I would vote against this as well as attempts to use taxpayer money to fund abortions. I was the unplanned pregnancy of an unwed, teenage mother.\n\nI was born shortly before Roe v. Wade. It’s not clear I would have survived if I were born just a few short years later. I hope and pray my mother would have made the same decision and chosen life. I would never deny that existential right to another.\n\n6.) What role would you assign yourself as a member of a slim House majority? Would you get behind policies or leaders that 90% of your party supports to advance the preferences of your caucus? Or would you use your dissent as leverage to advance positions most of your caucus didn’t support?\n\nMy role in the House would be to fight for what is best for the people of Montana's 2nd Congressional District. That would be my guiding principle whenever I sponsor a bill or vote on one. I have always been a hard-worker and a problem solver. I will use every tool at my disposal to craft legislation that is good for the 2nd District and good for our country. If a bill is harmful to the 2nd District, I will vote against it. I am not afraid to stand up for what is best for my constituents, no matter who it upsets. I would represent and work for the people who elected me, not any special interests or party leaders.\n\n7.) Would you have certified the electors from all 50 states as a member of Congress in 2021? Explain your decision while identifying any state whose electors you would have rejected.\n\nAs the current Montana State Auditor and Commissioner of Securities and Insurance, one of my most important roles is protecting Montanans against fraud and abuse. There is no doubt that in 2020, Democrats across the country used COVID as an excuse to unilaterally change voting rules to benefit their candidates.\n\nI am proud that in Montana we have a safe and secure election system. As a U.S. Congressman, I would use my experience rooting out fraud and protecting our citizens to provide oversight over elections. I would support common sense policies, such as mandatory voter ID, that ensure it is easy.\n\nHealth care, infrastructure and farm bill are Cabrera priorities\n\nKen Bogner cites his military and legislative background in House race\n\nPharmacist Austin brings medicine, farm background to House primary\n\nArntzen brings culture war to U.S. House race\n\nEditor’s note: This is one of 12 profiles featuring a candidate in Montana’s Second Congressional House District primary race. The profiles are being published daily over 12 days and in alphabetical order. Each of the candidates were asked the same questions.\n\nInevitably when Kevin Hamm talks to Democrats about this campaign for Montana’s eastern U.S. House seat, the question about whether a gay man can win the race is raised.\n\nIt’s like asking Evel Knievel on the ramp if the jump is one school bus too many. There are four Democrats in the eastern district primary. Everyone but Hamm has, before entering the race, surveyed the field and pronounced the race unwinnable by the candidates already running.\n\nKevin Hamm never said such a thing about competitors who came before him, because Hamm was first to file.\n\n“I have had so many Democrats who have asked me, ‘Well, do you think a gay man can win?’ And I’m like, ‘yeah, I wouldn’t be in the race if I didn’t think I could win.’ It’s so weird how many allies have internalized homophobia that they’re reacting to. I’m like, ‘you all need to get rid of that.’\n\n“I think there’s some protectionism that goes into it. It’s that, ‘Oh, we don’t want to see you face that,’ but also that’s my choice, not yours. You don’t get to protect my life. And more importantly, we must give the opportunity to people of Eastern Montana to prove that they’re not racist, they’re not sexist, they’re not agist and they’re not homophobic, by putting up the best candidates who happen to incorporate those things.”\n\nThere are 13 communities in Montana that raise awareness of and affirmation for LGBTQ individuals with parades. Hamm, as president of Montana Pride, has been there for many first steps. But Montana has had LGBTQ candidates before.\n\nDenise Juneau was openly gay when she for Montana’s at large House seat in 2016, Hamm points out. She did better than most Democrats running for an office Republicans dominated for 30 years, until the state earned a second House seat.\n\nThe Democratic primary, like the eight-candidate Republican primary, will be won in plurality, which is to say the winner can have less than 50% of the vote.\n\nWhat’s a priority for many Montanans, Hamm said, is taxes and housing. Property taxes are top of mind for many because state appraisals two years ago produced sharp increases in taxable value. But it’s April, income taxes are a hot topic. Hamm turns the conversation to taxes on Social Security income, which he would like to see Congress end.\n\n“There is absolutely no reason that we are taxing Social Security payments. That happened because of Reagan. That needs to be changed. Sorry,” Hamm said. “We shouldn't be taxing Social Security, which fixes a lot of things very quickly for people on that fixed income.\n\n“The other thing that happens, and this is just one of those things that people are going to have to get over it, you pay into Social Security because that is a safety net. We’re just removing the cap, because 6% of everybody’s paycheck should go into that because we are a society. And then it’s solvent. Done. This is not hard.”\n\nWhat Hamm is referencing is the “taxable maximum” of payments to Social Security, which is currently $168,600. Employee income below this threshold is taxed at 6.2% for Social Security and matched by employers. Self-employed individuals pay 12.4%. Hamm would remove the cap. The move has its critics. The Heritage Foundation argues that removing the cap would produce record tax increases for upper income earners.\n\nHamm’s professional background is in internet services. He is IT Consultant and CEO of Auxilyum Technical Services, and was also CEO of Treasure State Internet and Telegraph for five years. Internet infrastructure is part of his platform. Fast, reliable service is something Montanans deserve, he said, but rarely have, even in town. Infrastructure problems have persisted, Hamm said, despite more than $600 million in federal funding being directed to Montana.\n\n“The biggest problem with how it's done is because the granting doesn't go to small companies, doesn't go to small towns,” Hamm said. “You're in situations where the only way to build it is to have millions of dollars sitting around so that you can start a project, because it costs $1 million dollars to lay a mile of fiber. I don't know if you know this, but we don't all live within a mile of a town. So, of course if it costs a million dollars, and you're only going to line up six people at the end of that, then there is no fiscally responsible way a corporation can go on and build that network.\n\n“However, that is why we have the government because much like roads, there is no way that individual towns can build roads that connect to other individual towns. We use the federal government for that. And that is exactly what we should be doing. It takes some creative thinking and takes a little bit of work, but it's not impossible.”\n\nThis profile has been updated to include Hamm's current position as CEO of the IT consultancy Auxilyum Technologies\n\nKevin Hamm\n\nPolitical party: Democrat\n\nAge and place of birth: 51, Denver, Colorado\n\nHome: East Helena\n\nOccupation: IT Consultant, CEO Auxilyum\n\nFamily: Single, no kids\n\nEducation: Some college, lots of technical training\n\nPast employment: Owner, Studio 19 Productions; CEO, TSI&T; Marketing, Rich’s Houston; Marketing, ATX; Finance & Marketing, Garrett Aviation; Sales & Marketing, Planet Hollywood; Sales & Marketing, Riverside Hotel – Starwood\n\nMilitary: My father was in the Army but I wasn’t allowed to serve.

Identify two national priorities that are part of your platform, explain your position on each and tell voters how you intend to address both. If there’s an existing bill you support to advance your position, please identify it.\n\n1.) Inflation/greedflation/shrinkflation — while many across Montana are fighting to put food on the table and pay the unrestrained energy bills they face, property taxes have skyrocketed. Multi-national businesses in the U.S. are recording record profits, not paying their workers fair wages, and pocketing trillions via stock buy-backs all while avoiding fair taxation. We need to reduce the wage gaps at businesses because there’s no reason that a CEO makes a thousand or more times what a front-line worker makes. We need to restrict stock buy-backs at every company that gets any subsidies — that’s just transferring wealth to the wealthiest. We need to make sure that there’s fairness in the market, because right now it’s looking a lot like there’s no competition and the people are getting screwed. I would introduce clean, simple bills that address this problem.\n\nEnergy sovereignty — the grid is overwhelmed, the climate is out of control, and the costs to continue to allow a monopoly to extract exorbitant fees from captive ratepayers are unacceptable. We need to make it so that Montana — which has over 300 days of sun per year and windswept plains and valleys from Missoula to Ekalaka — has more wind and solar generation, and more independent, local micro-generation so that Montanans continue to have reliable, reasonably priced energy well into the future.\n\n2.) Name two issues unique to the Eastern District that you will have to advance because no one else in the House will be familiar enough to do so. Explain how you’ll get the job done.\n\nCommunications — the internet is for all intents the ubiquitous tool for connecting every business to customers, and the fact that massive swaths of Montanans do not have high-speed internet is near criminal. That the FCC, USDA, NTIA and the rest of the administration have not built their application and distribution tools to work in rural and frontier communities, like those that span Montana, means we need to get in and fix how they do their jobs. In the Eastern District, not having strong internet means not having access to telehealth either. In today’s world, having high speed internet access is as essential as having heat and water in the home.\n\nManufacturing — with the announced closure of the sugar beet processing plant, and the recent closures of two lumber mills in Townsend and Livingston, we’ve lost nearly 500 good paying jobs in the district. We need to build up our manufacturing and work with agriculture, meat processors, and mining companies to be processing and producing value-added work to export. I’m one of the best at finding and growing bridges between businesses that benefit all participants, and I will work to expand our interdisciplinary thinking across Montana.\n\nQ. A rare earth minerals miner in Montana recently suggested that to sustain a domestic supply of metals essential to all things tech —semiconductors, batteries, advanced military equipment — Congress would have to act. Otherwise, China, which supplies about 80% of the rare earth minerals imported by the U.S., will continue the dominate supply. Consider the traditional basket of trade options — tariffs, subsidies, government purchases, federal leasing, and environmental laws — and suggest a policy approach to this challenge.\n\nI find it disingenuous to say that “a rare earth minerals miner” made any suggestion when it was Kendall Cotton, a Koch-funded dark money fundamentalist who would sell the Smith River to the highest bidder and not bat an eye.\n\nThat said, rare earth mineral (REM) deposits that are worth not only money being sold, but can build our economy by being refined, and put into use via manufacturing here in Montana, is absolutely a game changer, and we have to develop the smartest way to extract the REMs while also protecting our environment. And yes, while Cotton mentioned that mining processes are much improved, until they are proven it’s all just theories and guesses, and the proving grounds need to not be at the headwaters of one of our best rivers. We need to do better and protect what makes Montana special while growing our resource development.\n\nWe are a state that has created incredible technologies over the last 135 years, so with the right combination of education and investment in research, finding ways to safely mine and manage environmental impact should be an area where we lead. It’s a combination of all our historical wins.\n\nQ. Explain how an import tariff consequential to sales of U.S. corn and soybeans to China affects the price of Montana’s top export ag commodity.\n\nA tariff makes our products more expensive for the consumer but doesn’t add profits to the producer at all. It’s a tool used to favor home-grown produce and can be devastating to smaller producers as their product is left to rot instead of being sold. This is a problem for many reasons, but that’s why we have the Farm Bill that, currently, the House has failed to pass again and again because they refuse work for all Americans. Unlike some currently elected Congressmen, I’m uninterested in playing games that impact people’s lives. Fair taxation is fine, but playing games with taxes to create proxy wars using our economy is just reckless. We can and should be smarter.\n\nQ. President Joe Biden has suggested “codifying Roe,” in other words creating a national right to abortion. Explain your position on this issue.\n\nWe should have done this years ago. As with all hard-won acknowledgements of rights, there will always be regressive troglodytes that want to return to the way things were because they see someone different having equal rights and perceive that somehow as a negative impact upon themselves. They are on the wrong side of history. But the fact that we don’t enshrine our rights explicitly is why we keep having to fight the same fights we’ve already won. To be clear, abortion is healthcare. Don’t like it, don’t get one, and keep your nose (and the government) out of other people’s private lives.\n\nQ. What role would you assign yourself as a member of a slim House majority? Would you get behind policies or leaders that 90% of your party supports to advance the preferences of your caucus? Or would you use your dissent as leverage to advance positions most of your caucus didn’t support?\n\nAnyone running for election that plans to play party politics or anti-party politics is already the wrong person to vote for. I’m not going to play games. We cannot expect to waive a magic wand to fix things. This job is about representing people and the function of representative democracy is that we do our best. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but most times if we do it right, we make things incrementally better and every step in the correct direction makes us better as a whole. We do that by working together with others. It’s work that involves consideration, constant guidance, and compromise in many ways. There are very few things where a compromise won’t move the needle the way we want, and working together with people who want to work on improving all our lives is where I’ll be.\n\nQ. Would you have certified the electors from all 50 states as a member of Congress in 2021? Explain your decision while identifying any state whose electors you would have rejected.\n\nYes. If anyone, especially those who currently hold office, wouldn’t, they need to resign because they were elected in the same election and if they wouldn’t certify the presidential, they shouldn’t certify or accept their own.\n\nEditor’s note: This is one of 12 profiles featuring a candidate in Montana’s Second Congressional House District primary race. The profiles are being published daily over 12 days and in alphabetical order. Each of the candidates were asked the same questions\n\nDemocratic U.S. House candidate Steve Held offers a different take on the immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border than his Republican counterparts in Montana’s eastern district.\n\nAll of the eight Republicans in the primary have made a pilgrimage to the border. Held has too. His daughter, Rikki, has been filming a documentary at the border.\n\n“What my constituents are concerned about is the border. That's the biggest thing on people's minds. And they're worried about the border and guns and their freedoms and privacy, the Constitution. It's just basically everything. That constitution, freedom, privacy, and everything else falls below that,” Held said. “So, I went to the southern border. I was in Brownsville, Texas at the furthest most other point in Texas. I went there myself, on my own dime before work so I can't even write it off.\n\n“I went down there because I wanted to see it. It wasn't anything like what they show on TV at all. And I talked to border agents. Of course, you know, it's like talking to a politician. You got to do it privately. They don't want you to say anything. They don't want to use your name or any of that stuff. But they do need help. The guys at the border need help. And it (ticks) me off that Rosendale refuses to sign the border bill.\" Republicans got 90% of what they wanted. And when I talked about it with my Republican friends, they say they got 85%, Democrats say 90%. Whatever they got.\n\n“When you get anything in life, lean back and ride, right? We can hit the ground at any moment. You don't turn down 85 to 90% of what you want for a political agenda.”\n\nThe border bill Held is referring to is the Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan aid bill that also included $20 billion for immigration. The bill was written by Senate Republicans and Democrats in early February. The legislation was quickly abandoned by Republican lawmakers after presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested the border could wait until 2025 and the outcome of the November election.\n\nSen. Jim Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who collaborated on the bill with Independent Sen. Kirsten Sinema of Arizona, Lankford told the Tulsa World that had the bill been law in the last three months of 2023, more than 800,000 would have been turned away from the United States. Within the total, was $534 million to hire thousands of new border security agents and other hires. There was $2.5 billion in the bill for “removal flights” and short-term staging facilities to repatriate aliens back to their home countries. And $3.2 billion for increased detention space.\n\nAll three of Montana’s Republican members of Congress rejected the bill.\n\nHeld is a rancher and businessman in the community of Broadus, located in the far southeast corner of the state. He’s an actor who previously worked for the Screen Actors Guild. He might be better known for daughter Rikki Held’s role as a youth plaintiff in the lawsuit Held v. Montana, a landmark case the successfully argued that Montanans constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment includes a state government response to climate change when permitting projects.\n\nGetting a Farm Bill, one that works for Montana farmers, is a principal issue for Held. He said the farm bills too often ignore farmers and ranchers, addressing the priorities of large agribusinesses instead. He would like to see the next farm bill, which isn’t likely to advance until 2025 after the results of the November election play out.\n\nCountry of origin labeling on beef, something ranchers have fought for, but meatpackers have opposed, would be an issue Montana’s delegation should support as part of the next Farm Bill, Held said. Montanans should expect their delegation to produce laws that advance the needs of constituents.\n\n“I talked to Daines and Tester all the time before I got into this,” Held said. “You know, I was writing to them, and I said over and over again, ‘what I want to see from the two of you is both of your names on some bills. Because that's what Montana is, to me. It's Montanans working together with a unified voice to get things done for people.’ And they did a few, you know, veteran things mostly. When they did, I thanked them.”\n\nAge and place of birth: 63\n\nHome: Broadus\n\nOccupation: Rancher and businessman\n\nFamily: Married father of two\n\nEducation: American Conservatory Theater and Rocky Mountain College\n\nPast employment: Screen Actors Guild Union Member\n\nMilitary: None\n\nPolitical experience: None\n\nEndorsements: Yes\n\nWays voters can contact you:\n\na.)

Identify two national priorities that are part of your platform, explain your position on each and tell voters how you intend to address both.

Pass a farm bill that actually works for family farmers and ranchers, not just big agribusiness corporations. This should be a top priority for every member of Congress because our farmers and ranchers feed the world and should power it. Instead, we’ve gotten chaos while I see more and more of my friends and neighbors in agriculture struggle to make ends meet or go belly up. I would work with one of the only other real farmers in Congress, Sen. Jon Tester, and all of Montana’s farmers, ranchers, and agricultural organizations to make it the national priority it should be and it sure as heck will include mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) requirements for U.S. beef producers and consumers.\n\n2. Pass a ban on congressional insider stock trading to clean up the corruption in the swamp. Everyone is sick of the self-serving politician"
