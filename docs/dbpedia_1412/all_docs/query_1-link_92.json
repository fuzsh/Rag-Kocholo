        "text": "What is Denny Rehberg's Net Worth?\n\nDenny Rehberg is an American politician who has a net worth of $12 million dollars. Denny Rehberg was born in Billings, Montana, and went on to earn his B.A. in Public Administration from Washington State University. He began working in politics immediately after graduating, serving as an intern for the Montana State Senate, and then moving on to an administrative position in Washington, D.C. for U.S. Congressman Ron Marlenee. He stepped away from politics to focus on his family's farming business until the mid-80s.\n\nHe then returned to politics and served in the Montana House of Representatives from 1985 to 1991. From there, he went on to serve as Lieutenant Governor for one full term. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000. He won re-election in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. In 2012, he was defeated. He was succeeded by Steve Daines."
