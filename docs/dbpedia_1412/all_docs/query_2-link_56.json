        "text": "After initially being forced to abandon debate on the bill due to a little-enforced rule limiting committees to meetings of two hours in length after the full Senate is in session (Walsh 1986), the Foreign Relations Committee reconvened the following day and approved the bill on August 1st, 1986, 15-2, with no votes from Jesse Helms (R-NC) and Larry Pressler (R-SD). During committee debate Helms denounced the bill, saying, \"Here we go again, kicking a friend in the teeth because they don't do what we want them to do\" (CQ Almanac 1987). While other committee members had opposed many parts of the bill, they did vote to send it to the floor. Lugar was credited with getting the bill through committee \"with sheer political muscle\" (CQ Almanac 1987). Members of both parties tried to change the bill – liberal Democrats to strengthen it and some Republicans to weaken it – but Lugar marshaled the committee to keep the bill acceptable to many legislators.\n\nThe bill that came out of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, in direct contrast to the bill that passed the House of Representatives, contained targeted sanctions that would not destabilize the economy of South Africa.\n\nOn August 9th, 1986, Dole asked for, and received, unanimous consent that on August 13, the Senate proceed to consider a cloture motion on S 2701. The UCA structured the debate on S 2701.[26] Debate on S 2701 eventually began around 9am on August 14th, with a series of 47 amendments, 20 of which received roll call votes. Dole called for, and received, unanimous consent that Rule XXII would not be enforced.\n\nHaving deferred to the president the previous year – \"We argued that a premium should be placed on the American Government speaking with one voice\" – Lugar admitted that the state of South Africa had worsened, and specific sanctions by the United States would be appropriate policy. He made clear he did not intend to cripple the South African economy as he wished to avoid hurting black South Africans. Senators who backed a stronger bill didn’t buy this premise at all, with Glenn saying, \"The administration, for its part, argues we should refrain from enacting sanctions because they would hurt the blacks in South Africa. That argument makes about as much sense as saying that Abraham Lincoln should not have issued the Emancipation Proclamation because it put 4-million slaves out of work.\"\n\nSenator Clairborne Pell (D-RI) criticized the president’s policy of \"constructive engagement\", adding that it \"led white South Africa to believe we are sympathetic to their cause, while leading blacks to think that we are not supporting their struggle against apartheid.\" Senator Lowell Weicker (R-CT) echoed this, saying, \"[the] greatest pro-Communist force existent in South Africa is the policy of constructive engagement.\" Weicker almost presciently predicted the bill’s eventual outcome, calling for a bill that could receive at least 67 votes in order to override a presidential veto.\n\nOne of the major criticisms of the bill is that it was being used to promote protectionism, and more than one amendment seemed to indicate that possibility. Senator Alan Cranston (D-CA) successfully added an amendment (67 votes to 29) to ban textile imports from South Africa, which were up 139% in 1985. Although Cranston’s amendment failed in committee, it succeeded on the floor. Lugar again invoked protectionism when disagreeing with a reworked and subsequently accepted amendment by Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), which sought to ban imports of South African agriculture, exports of American petroleum products to South Africa, and end some financial maneuverability South Africa received from US institutions.\n\nSenator Malcolm Wallop (R-WY) repeated concerns of House members who questioned the bill supporters’ motivations, and called out what he saw as a double standard, focusing on South Africa and not other oppressive regimes: \"I suggest, Mr. President, that what we are looking at is middle-class, comfortable white senators playing up to the black population of America, and the liberal population of America,\" adding that other countries in Africa were worse than South Africa. As if to prove his point, Wallop added an amendment to apply the whole bill to the Soviet Union, which failed.\n\nSenator Larry Pressler (R-SD) was one of the most vocal opponents of this legislation and said sanctions would prolong apartheid, push the South African government to the right, and would cause a civil war. His successful amendment aimed to help out the US gold mining industry by forbidding the US president to sell any (because it would drop the price of gold, and South Africa’s low cost in mining compared to the US would give it a market advantage). Senator Steve Symms (R-ID), who was against the bill, worried about a ban on imports forcing the US to rely on communist countries, and won at least part of the argument when he successfully introduced an amendment which said no provisions of the act could be enforced if it led to US reliance on communist countries for coal, or critical materials. Senator Don Nickles (R-OK) introduced an amendment to protect American farmers from the brunt of the sanctions, who would be hindered under the current terms of the bill; the amendment passed 55-44.\n\nSenator Chris Dodd (D-CT) introduced an amendment to halt the purchase of goods from South Africa’s state-owned companies, but Dole criticized the amendment because the US had recently won a grain contract, precisely because South Africa had retaliated through trade against Australia for introducing sanctions (CQ Almanac 1987). Dole changed the language of his amendment to be listed as something the president could consider implementing a year after the bill’s passage.\n\nAn amendment by Jesse Helms (R-NC) caused a lengthy debate, as it raised the specter of communism in the South African struggle movement, and violent actions undertaken therein. The amendment called for the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress, another organization, to renounce terrorism or the US would support negotiations without them. Helms felt the sanctions affected only the South African government: \"In my own judgment it is tactically wrong to impose sanctions whose burden falls only on one party to the negotiations.\" Lugar supported the amendment but more liberal senators were having none of it. For example, Weicker responded, \"I rise in opposition to the amendment, principally, on the basis that it tries to equate the violence and the hurt imposed by apartheid with the activities of resistance by those to whom the hurts are being done.\" Pell added, \"it makes the US policy toward apartheid dependent really on the actions of the ANC.\" Finally, Cranston stated that \"it equates the oppressors with the oppressed.”\n\n[1]&nbsp Apartheid, translated from Afrikaans literally means “apart-ness” and was a political system designed to keep the races separate, and overwhelmingly favored white citizens.\n\n[2]&nbsp Freshman Mitch McConnell (R-KY), elected in 1984, was to play a significant part in the passage of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986.\n\n[3]&nbsp In the first session of the 99th Congress, Gray introduced HR 1460, which imposed more modest sanctions on South Africa. That bill, considered under an open rule (Hres 174), passed the House 296-129 on June 5, 1985. 56 House Republicans joined 240 House Democrats in support, while six Democrats joined 123 Republicans in opposition (Voteview 99th House rcnum 130) (Poole and Rosenthal 1997). Lugar's Senate bill, S 995, was even more limited. HR 1460 passed the Senate in lieu of S 995 on July 11, 1985, 80-12. The conference report was agreed to in the House on August 1, 1985, 380-48 (considered under Hres 251). Before the report was adopted in the Senate, Reagan imposed a number of sanctions on South Africa via an executive order. This led Senate Republicans to pull their support for the conference report, cloture on a motion to proceed to the report failed 11-88 on September 12, 1985.\n\n[4]&nbsp Cape Town is one of three capitals of South Africa, and is the location of parliament. Members of Congress more commonly refer to Pretoria as the capital, and it is where most nations have a diplomatic presence.\n\n[5]&nbsp Helen Suzman was a long-time member of the South African whites only parliament, and, at times, the only MP opposed to apartheid. She was also often the only English and female member, and Jewish, in a body dominated by protestant Afrikaans men. Her constant arguments against apartheid meant she received a good deal of criticism, and was harassed and spied on by security services. She is credited with being one of the influences on Nelson Mandela to maintain a market economy instead of radically changing the way South Africa functioned. Inkatha was a Zulu organization, now a political party in South Africa (the IFP), headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and based in the province that was then called Natal. Buthelezi was affiliated with liberation politics as a young man, but left to work in a government department that pertained to black South Africans in 1951. He was elected CEO of the Zulu Territorial Authority, a homeland set up by the South African government in the northern part of the province. Buthelezi’s position as CEO meant he was reliant on the existence of the South African government, and his supporters clashed, often violently, with anti-Apartheid organizations.\n\n[6]&nbsp For a discussion of Gray’s first session bill, HR 1460, see footnote 3.\n\n[7]&nbsp One hour and forty-five minutes was to be shared among the Democratic and Republican leadership of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with the rest equally dispersed among the leadership of the Public Works and Transportation Committee; Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee; and the Ways and Means Committee.\n\n[8]&nbsp Points of order for contravening the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which forbade consideration of legislation that reduced revenue below an agreed-upon floor, were waived, as were points of order against the bill for breaking clause 2(1)(6) of House rule XI, which requires committee reports be available for three days before consideration.\n\n[9]&nbsp Rep. Trent Lott (R-MS) pointed out the rule only allowed amendments from five different members and criticized the House for “considering a bill designed to promote human rights in South Africa under a procedure which denies the basic rights of 430 democratically elected Members of the United States House of Representatives [to offer amendments] (Congressional Record, June 18, 1986, 99th Congress, 14223).”\n\n[10]&nbsp The previous question was ordered by voice vote. 48 Republicans joined 238 Democrats in voting for the rule, while four Democrats joined 123 Republicans in opposition (Voteview 99th House rcnum 598) (Poole and Rosenthal 1997).\n\n[11]&nbsp The allotted time was spread among senior committee officials: Howard Wolpe was Chair of the Subcommittee on Africa of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Dan Siljander was its Ranking Member. Dan Rostenkowski was the Chair of Ways and Means, and Phil Crane was Ranking Member. Fernand St Germain was Chair of Banking Finance and Urban Affairs and that committee’s Ranking Member was Chalmers Wiley. Norman Mineta was Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee of the House Committee on Transportation, and Gene Snyder was its Ranking Member.\n\n[12]&nbsp The group included former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, and former Nigerian head of state Olusegun Obasanjo, who signed the letter to Senator Ted Kennedy.\n\n[13]&nbsp Notably absent was the United Kingdom, another major trading partner of South Africa.\n\n[14]&nbsp The Group Areas Act defined where South Africans were forced to live, dependent on their race, in urban settings.\n\n[15]&nbsp For example a “tricameral parliament” which allowed South Africans designated “coloured” and “Indian” to participate in a minor role, but excluded blacks (Lemon 1984).\n\n[16]&nbsp Soweto (formed from the words “South Western Townships”) was a major urban area designated for black South Africans in Johannesburg, and is where many dispossessed blacks were sent when the government forced them out of their homes.\n\n[17]&nbsp On 16 June 1976, an estimated 20,000 students protested in response to the introduction of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in schools. Many were killed in violent confrontations with police. Cover ups by the government mean that to this day we still do not know how many students died.\n\n[18]&nbsp A set of corporate codes of conduct developed by Reverend Leon Sullivan promoting social responsibility.\n\n[19]&nbsp Dellums stated that while the sanctions in Gray’s bill were a “are a step forward,” they were also \"inadequate in response to what is evolving in South Africa at the very moment (Congressional Record, June 18, 1986, 99th Congress, 14276).\"\n\n[20]&nbsp See Voteview 99th House rcnum 128 (Poole and Rosenthal 1997).\n\n[21]&nbsp Specifically, Rep. Robert Walker (R-PA) asserted that “It seems to me that what we are doing here is talking about a wishy-washy incremental approach versus an approach that is at least tough and honest (Congressional Record, June 18, 1986, 99th Congress, 14279).”\n\n[22]&nbsp For example, Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-NY) asserted he “changed my mind because of the South African raids against Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana. I changed my mind because of the re-imposition by the South African Government of the state of emergency (Congressional Record, June 18, 1986, 99th Congress, 14280).”\n\n[23]&nbsp Bonker suggested the Dellums substitute would lead to “a failure on the House floor that would send the wrong message to South Africa (Congressional Record, June 18, 1986, 99th Congress, 14278).”\n\n[24]&nbsp Specifically, the Washington Post noted that: “[Burton and Siljander], who led opposition to sanctions legislation on the House floor, said the milder sanctions measure had been certin to pass and that they hoped to kill the issue by approval of ‘the worst possible bill’ (Walsh, Edward. 1986. “House Would Require U.S. Disinvestment from South Africa,” The Washington Post, June 19).” Siljander predicted the measure would die in the Senate and CQ Almanac (1987) quoted him as saying Dellums bill was a “kiss of death.” (See also Dickenson, James R. 1986. “Dellums: Exoneration is His,” The Washington Post, June 20.) Walker (R-PA), said he preferred Dellums substitute because it would make Reagan’s inevitable veto easier to sustain (Greenberger, Robert S. 1986. “House Takes Tough Stance on South Africa,” The Wall Street Journal, June 19.) And in an op-ed, the Wall Street Journal was skeptical of the prospect of Dellum’s success, arguing it “passed by voice vote in a largely empty House. It probably has gone as far as it will go (“The House Blunderbuss,” The Wall Street Journal, June 20, 1986.)\n\n[25]&nbsp For a discussion of Lugar’s first session bill, S 995, see footnote 3.\n\n[26]&nbsp See the Congressional Record, 99th Congress, August 9, 1986, 20235-20237. The unanimous consent agreement was viewed as a compromise between conservatives who wanted quick action on legislation that would send additional aid to Nicaragua’s counterrevolutionary forces and moderates and liberals who prioritized South African sanctions. Members were pressing for action on both issues by proposing them as amendments to a debt ceiling extension (see Roberts, Steven V. 1986. “Harsh Words on Floor Between Dole and Byrd,” The New York Times, August 6; “Debt-Limit Mayhew,” The Wall Street Journal, August 7, 1986.)\n\n[27]&nbsp Necklacing was a process of putting a tire filled with gasoline around a victim’s head, and setting it alight.\n\n[28]&nbsp Voteview.com (99th House, rcnum 829): https://voteview.com/rollcall/RH0990829\n\n[29]&nbsp Lugar, Richard and Nancy Kassebaum. 1986. \"Override the President's Veto.\" The Washington Post, September 30.\n\n[30]&nbsp Reagan's popularity was above 60 percent according to Gallup for nearly all of 1986.
