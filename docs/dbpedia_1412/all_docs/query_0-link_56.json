        "text": "Special Note: This is the 650th post on this Montana blog\n\nI’d like to take March off.\n\nBefore I do that, however, I’d like to give you a taste of what I can do.\n\nLots of people like my historical writings, though my history books don’t sell that well.\n\nI have six of them on the State of Montana, and what you’re about to read will be in the seventh and final volume.\n\nI hope you’ll check these books out, especially the later volumes that deal with our more modern Montana history.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n​Jim Waltermire and the 1988 Governor’s Race\n\nThe course of Montana history was drastically altered on Friday, April 8, 1988.\n\nThat was the day Jim Waltermire’s twin-engine Cessna 310 “slammed into a field near East Helena and disintegrated,” newspapers reported two days after the event.\n\nHe’d been returning from the Lincoln Day Dinner in Glasgow and was just 4 miles from the Helena airport’s runway when it happened. Also killed in the crash was pilot James A. Morris, who was 64-years-old. Waltermire had only been 39-years-old.\n\nIt was just a month before the 1988 gubernatorial primary and things would have turned out a lot differently had Waltermire not died in that plane crash.\n\nWaltermire was the front-runner in the GOP primary that year, having announced way back in October 1987. His main platform was “advocating a sales tax and the takeover of some government services by private enterprise.”\n\nJim Waltermire, c 1984\n\nJim Waltermire had been born in Choteau to a “barn-storming crop-duster” father, though the man had left when he was about 5-years-old. His mother was a waitress and to help out Waltermire “peddled seeds, cards, and Grit newspapers door to door,” even “dug graves, fed cows and worked in a drug store at the airstrip.”\n\nHe went to MSU for a time, then UM, earning a business degree from the latter. He was active in supporting Nixon during his college years, then after feeling depressed by the national 1976 election returns and also feeling frustrated by the “no growth and liberal, big-spending attitudes of local governments” in Missoula, he decided to run for one of the Missoula county commissioner seats.\n\nHe had a bit of name-recognition from his investment firm Waltermire and Hicks, and that probably helped. He won the race in 1977 and was on his way.\n\nIn 1978 he decided to run for the western district U.S. House seat, and defeated four other GOP candidates in the primary, including the wife of news broadcaster Chet Huntley.\n\nIt wasn’t Waltermire’s year, and Pat Williams defeated him to take over the seat that Max Baucus was vacating.\n\nWaltermire came back two years later, however, and won Montana’s Secretary of State race. That was the first time a Republican had done so in 48 years. Voters approved of his performance and he got reelected in 1984.\n\nAdmirers called him a “savvy, hard-charging leader armed with a vision, a record of accomplishment and the guts to make the unpopular decisions needed to move Montana forward.”\n\nWaltermire’s foes called him “an arrogant, ruthless opportunist,” who “shamelessly” exploited the Secretary of State’s Office “for seven years to build up his name and political machinery to run for governor.”\n\nFriends admitted that Waltermire “could be brusque” but that his “perceived arrogance and aloofness masked a shyness, a sensitivity and a sense of insecurity from growing up in a financially struggling broken home.”\n\nThe public didn’t really get a chance to see the warmer side of Waltermire, friends said. Mostly they saw how uneasily he dealt with others, his lack of socializing, and of course that ambition.\n\nHe’d flirted with the idea of getting out of politics in 1986 when he got married. It was around the same time he converted to Roman Catholicism, something many said was “politically motivated.” Waltermire just said that it “changed his life,” gave him a “sense of inner peace,” and “made him care more about other people than himself.”\n\nWaltermire stayed in politics, announced his bid for the governorship in 1987, and then just like that, six months later he was lying dead in a field east of the Helena airport.\n\nNo cause was ever determined for the accident, though it’s suspected that a “severe springtime storm” may have contributed to the crash. “It was snow and sleet and fairly high winds,” officials said.\n\nThe other two candidates in the GOP gubernatorial race that year – former state representative from Havre Stan Stephens and sitting Billings representative Cal Winslow – halted their campaigns.\n\nBoth had been at the same Lincoln Day Dinner in Glasgow that Waltermire had attended. “Jim was a friend of mine,” Stephens said of Waltermire, “and he was a worthy contender for governor.”\n\nThe truth was that Waltermire was in the lead going into the GOP primary and, with the state coming off 16 years of Democrats in the governor’s office, it was almost a given that whoever the Republican candidate was, they’d be winning that office. Waltermire’s death, though tragic, was a boost to Stephens.\n\nMore than 400 people attended Waltermire’s funeral the following Wednesday. By Thursday it was back to the campaign trail.\n\n​Stan Stephens Takes the Reins\n\nStanley Graham Stephens had actually been the first of the three candidates that election year to announce, having done so on January 1, 1987…ten months before Waltermire.\n\nStephens had been born in Canada on September 16, 1929. He dropped out of Western Canada High School during his senior year, mainly because “his dad was sick, his mother was supporting the family.” His dad had Parkinson’s.\n\nTo help out, Stephens took work as a news writer and announcer at Calgary radio stations. “It was time for me simply to get out and go to work,” he said years later of the decision.\n\nStephens didn’t come to America until 1949, and he did so “in search of greater opportunities.” To find those opportunities he hired on with a “travelling farm crew that did harvesting from Texas to Montana.”\n\nWhen Stephens saw an ad from Havre radio station KOJM “looking for a writer and an announcer,” he went for an interview and got the job. The salary was $175 a month.\n\nStephens was still a resident alien when the Army drafted him for the Korean War. Writing years later, Stephens said that he “could have refused on the grounds of being a foreign citizen.” He chose not to, however, because he’d “already decided to apply for citizenship” and “felt the same obligation as any other American when called upon to serve.”\n\nHe served as a military correspondent with the Armed Forces Radio Service and Military Intelligence division from 1952-53 and at war’s end, headed back to Havre and his radio station work. He also became a U.S. citizen in 1954 when District Judge C.B. Elwell swore him in with several others.\n\nStephens continued on with his work at KOJM. He “did a little of everything – writing, selling ads, announcing sports and even won a trip to New York in 1951 as Montana’s top disk jockey.”\n\nAs half of the “Bob and Ray” comedy team that appeared on the air every morning, Stephens built up a great deal of speaking experience and knowledge of the state. By 1965 he was co-owner of the station with two other colleagues.\n\nStephens’ reporting career got a boost when he won an Edward R. Murrow award for his reporting of improprieties in the state’s worker’s comp system in 1975.\n\nShortly after that he branched-out into TV, eventually becoming the president and general manager of Havre, Glasgow, and Sidney TV stations. He also got into politics.\n\nStan Stephens, c 1996\n\nHe’d been elected to the Montana Senate in 1968, the first Republican from Hill County to earn that honor in more than 40 years. He served a single term before suffering defeat in the 1972 election, mainly due to the reapportionment of the district.\n\nWhen district lines were again redrawn in 1974, however, he won the seat back and served in it until 1987. In 1979 and 1981 he was the body’s majority leader, became its president in 1983, and when Democrats took over in 1985, became the minority leader.\n\nDemocratic legislator Chet Blaylock said that Stephens helped control “the far-right-wing nonsense that sometimes came out of the GOP House.”\n\nCoal industry lobbyist Jim Mockler called Stephens “a tenacious little devil” and that if his ideas didn’t get approved the first time around “they’ll resurface in another way later.”\n\nStephens’ political opponents in his Montana Senate races didn’t like the fact that he controlled the media stations, and claimed it gave him an edge. They charged that he allowed himself to buy a lot more ads than he allowed them, and the ads he did give them ran at odd times. Stephens refuted this, and also pointed out that the FCC “carefully monitored the station.”\n\nWhat helped Stephens most of all, however, was his “experienced radio voice, speaking ability and knowledge of the media.” Those skills helped him on the campaign trail and they led to his decision not to run for the legislature again in 1986.\n\nHe knew he wanted something more, but couldn’t decide on governor or U.S. Senate. He finally decided that he’d do better as governor, for it’d take “10-12 years in the Senate with its seniority system” before he could affect any meaningful change.\n\nSo it was the governor’s race he set his sights on. To indicate how serious he was, he sold off his interests in his radio and TV stations before announcing.\n\n​The 1988 Campaign\n\nDuring the 1988 gubernatorial campaign, Stephens highlighted how he’d succeeded as a Republican in a heavily-Democratic area, Havre, which at that time was dominated by “rail workers and other labor groups.”\n\nEven though the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation voted Democratic 90% of the time, Stephens learned some Chippewa Cree words to win them over. “They gave me an ‘E’ for effort,” he later said. What might have helped him more were memories of him “buying coffee and doughnuts for rail workers manning a picket line.”\n\nHis main issues during the campaign were less government, fewer regulations, shrinking the state workforce, and privatizing some government services. He also wanted to reduce the forty-one classifications of property taxes to just three or four.\n\nHe thought a longer school year might benefit Montana students while higher wages for university faculty would improve the situation with the university system. One reporter said the Stephens’ campaign possessed “all the excitement of a dark business suit.”\n\nThat perception changed when Stephens got an early boost in March 1988 when, “instead of delivering a closing speech” at a Billings candidate debate, he “pulled out his trumpet.”\n\nStephens had learned to play the instrument from his father. He was just 6-years-old when he took it up, but by the time he was 12 he was the principal trumpet for the Calgary Symphony Orchestra, “whose ranks were depleted by men serving in the military during World War II.”\n\nStephens “brought 700 people to their feet by belting out the state song” that night at the debate. Stephens was later voted “the most impressive candidate of the night.”\n\n“I have no desire to go to Washington,” Stephens said shortly before the June primary. “I want to be governor of the State of Montana, and I want to do that well. I don’t seek this position as a stepping stone to federal office. I am not on an ego trip.”\n\nWhen the June primary came, Stephens took it 50% to Cal Winslow’s 43%. Winslow had campaigned on his youth and the idea that he could bring business to the state, but voters didn’t buy it.\n\nThings had been very sketchy going in, however, and the results proved that. More than 6,000 people voted for Jim Waltermire, or nearly 7%, even though he’d died a month earlier. Had they voted for Winslow, Stephens might have lost.\n\nOn the Democratic side, six candidates battled it out, with former governor Tom Judge (who’d served from 1973 to 1981) coming out on top. He had 39% of the vote, with Frank Morrison coming in second at 27%.\n\nMike Greely split the more liberal vote of the Party, taking 22% of the vote and ultimately denying Frank Morrison from gaining more than the 27% he took. Morrison’s dad had been governor of Nebraska from 1961 to 1967, and though many in Montana liked his son, they felt him too liberal for the state and saw him as just another out-of-stater trying to weasel his way in.\n\nBy November voters had heard the candidates out for months and come to the decision that it was time for a new face, not an old one. Stan Stephens took the race with nearly 52% of the vote compared to Tom Judge’s 46%. Third-party candidate William Morris took nearly 2%.\n\n​Governor Stan Stephens (1989-1993)\n\nStephens might have won the election but he didn’t have an easy time of it in the governor’s office. That became clear as early as the 1989 legislative session.\n\n“I simply wish I’d inherited an administration that had a reserve and a budget that was more promising,” he said.\n\nStephens didn’t have much money to work with and stood by his pledge not to raise taxes. Even transitioning into the governor’s office had been difficult – the state had $5,000 in funds for that but it wasn’t enough and Stephens used $30,000 of his leftover campaign money to help.\n\nDespite those difficulties, Stephens managed to get through the legislature that year, and even called a special legislative session as well. The latter succeeded in dropping the business equipment tax from 16% to 9%.\n\nStephens also vetoed some spending bills, which ultimately cut the budget by $10 million. The university system saw an additional $13 million in funding, though with the stipulation that they have greater accountability as well.\n\nBy the 1991 legislative session he was ready to cut 400 state jobs while providing no increase for education funding. His total budget that year was for $1.7 billion, though that was $100 million more than the state was expecting to take in.\n\nHe also vetoed the infrastructure bill that year, saying he’d instead go with the voter initiative Big Sky Dividend program in 1992. By the close of the session, Stephens had vetoed thirty-three bills, more than the previous two governors did during their 16 years in office.\n\nAt the end of August 1991, Stephens announced that he’d be running for a second term. At the time there was a revenue shortfall of $73 million and Stephens wanted to cut spending by 8%.\n\n“Confidence, optimism, excitement is etched on the landscape as we move on,” Stephens said during his announcement. Democrats said the governor was “an out-of-touch chief executive wearing the emperor’s new clothes and viewing Montana through rose-colored glasses.”\n\nDorothy Bradley, a Bozeman representative, had already made it clear she’d be running for governor in 1992. “Never in my 16 years as a legislator have we entered into a biennium with a budget in such shambles,” she said.\n\nDorothy Bradley, 1992\n\nStephens countered this by saying that more than 21,000 new jobs had been created in his three years in office.\n\nMontana AFL-CIO head Don Judge said those were “low-paying, burger-flipping jobs.”\n\n​The Stan Stephens Scandals\n\nStephens was an incredibly weak candidate going into the 1992 Election, and it wasn’t just his poor budgeting skills. There were a lot of controversies around the Stephens administration, a stark contrast to the previous Schwinden administration.\n\nRight away upon taking office there were stories that Stephens was going to lease a limousine to drive him around, though he adamantly denied this. There was a bit of truth there, however, for the governor sold the $32,000 Lincoln Town Car a year later and downgraded to “an economy car.”\n\nAlso in January 1989, the head of the Department of Family Services resigned after “making harassing phone calls to Stephens’ opponent in the 1988 GOP primary.”\n\nThe next month Stephens got in hot water when news leaked out that an aide was compiling “psychological profiles of legislators.” A month after that Stephens’ budget director resigned after admitting he’d falsified his credentials and had also been married to two women at the same time.\n\nIn August 1989 it was revealed that the labor commissioner had “ordered some of his department’s airline tickets be bought through a Butte travel agency owned by a nephew.”\n\nIn February 1990 Stephens’ commerce director resigned after it was revealed he’d ordered the hiring of his girlfriend and that he’d also bought label pins from a company his son owned.\n\nThen in September 1990 Stephens made headlines by asking the Helena Department of Motor Vehicles to stay open late so he could renew his driver’s license.\n\n“I figured if I didn’t I would have probably have got in trouble,” the examiner of the Helena office said of her decision to accede to the governor’s wishes. “I didn’t think it was fair,” she added, and also mentioned that U.S. Senator Max Baucus had “stood in line last year for the usual 20 minutes.” Stephens had been incensed at the 45-minute wait time he’d found upon coming in after the Labor Day weekend.\n\nA month later the Highway Department director resigned after it was revealed he’d overspent the department’s budget by $20 million and twenty-nine construction projects had to be delayed because of this.\n\nIn November 1990 Stephens’ appointment to the Disaster and Emergency Services Division was suspended, and four months later, fired. Fellow workers described the man as “abrasive, overbearing, and arrogant” and that he was “prone to temper tantrums and mistreating workers.”\n\nBy mid-1991, Stephens had a 45% approval rating. More than 56% of people thought he was doing a bad job. Still, a couple months later he announced he’d be running again in 1992.\n\nIn the end it wasn’t the controversies and the opposition that took Stephens out of the running for the 1992 governor’s race, it was his health.\n\nOn January 17 Stephens stood in the Governor’s Reception Room of the State Capitol and “red-faced and shaking with anger, he blasted Democrats for what he said were personal attacks on him.”\n\nThe next day Stephens had “dizziness and brief inability to speak” before collapsing in his home. He got checked out in Helena and a further opinion in Seattle. Doctors told him he’d had a “transient ischemic attack in which part of a blood clot apparently reached a blood vessel in his brain.”\n\nStephens was 62-years-old at the time and was encouraged “to slow down and watch” his daily activity. He said that when it came to being governor, “there simply is no other job in Montana that has this kind of demand on the human body and on your mind.”\n\nAlthough making it clear that, “I’ve been advised by a number of medical authorities that I’m perfectly capable of resuming my normal duties and running for a second term,” he decided to bow out of politics.\n\nOn Friday, January 31, he made the announcement that he wouldn’t be seeking that second term after all.\n\n​That was the first the public had heard of it. The night before, however, he’d told senior aides of the decision. One of them was Denny Rehberg.\n\n​\n\nContinued in…The Phone Call That Changed Montana\n\n​Notes\n\nAnez, Bob. “Waltermire killed in crash.” Great Falls Tribune. 10 April 1988.\n\nAnez, Bob. “Stan’s first weeks: no picnic.” Independent Record. 24 February 1989.\n\nAnez, Bob. “Office open late to help out gov.” Independent Record. 14 September 1990.\n\nAnez, Bob. “Stephens budget cuts 400 jobs.” Great Falls Tribune. 28 November 1990.\n\nAnez, Bob. “Stan’s appointments: a comedy of errors?” Independent Record. 30 August 1991.\n\nJohnson, Charles S. “Stephens trumpets his cause in campaign.” Great Falls Tribune. 13 March 1988.\n\nJohnson, Charles S. “Waltermire sparked controversy, admiration.” Great Falls Tribune. 10 April 1988.\n\nJohnson, Charles S. “Stephens liberal with use of veto.” Great Falls Tribune. 9 June 1991.\n\nJohnson, Chuck. “Stephens listened to warning signs.” Great Falls Tribune. 2 February 1992.\n\nJohnson, Peter. “Stephens launches re-election campaign.” Great Falls Tribune. 29 August 1991.\n\nJohnson, Peter. “Stephens ratings at lowest level since mid-’89.” Great Falls Tribune. 23 December 1991.\n\nNewhouse, Eric. “Stan: We need a sales tax.” Great Falls Tribune. 22 May 1992.\n\nO’Connell, Sue. “State officials laud Waltermire.” Great Galls Tribune. 10 April 1988.\n\nSkidmore, Bill. “Gov bows out.” Independent Record. 31 January 1992.\n\n“Stan Stephens: Moderate Republican campaigns on ability to ‘motivate both sides.’ Independent Record. 29 May 1988.\n\n“Stephens lists accomplishments in first year.” Great Falls Tribune. 1 January 1990.\n\n“Through the Open Door, What Is It Like to Be an Immigrant in America?” The Wall Street Journal. 3 July 1990.\n\n“Schweitzer is the only Democrat that can win the election,” a commenter on Last Best News said today in regard to the upcoming special election to choose Zinke's replacement. “Wouldn't you just love having him in D.C. calling BS on all that goes on there?...Come on Brian - do the nation a great favor.”\n\nPeople got excited about that post today. They got excited about the idea of Brian Schweitzer representing them again.\n\nI don’t think they’ll see Schweitzer representing them again until this time 4 years from now, however.\n\nThat’d be when he gets his third term as governor, something few Montana individuals have done before.\n\nWe’ll take a look at those folks today, perhaps with the hopes that we may learn something.\n\nSometimes I think this is all a big pissing contest, just a way to say who was governor of Montana more than anyone else.\n\nSince everyone that’s had the honor of serving a long time as governor lived in a separate time period from everyone else that has, well…I’m not sure it matters.\n\nAnd who’s to say what motivates politicians? Some offices are seen as ideal, others not so much.\n\nSome use the governor’s office as a stepping stone, others as a way station before something else comes along.\n\nMany just view it as the best office of all, and those that serve in it the longest often seem to take that view.\n\nSo let’s look at them, and see what we can learn.\n\n​Territorial Governor Benjamin Franklin Potts (1870-1883)\n\nCurrently Benjamin Potts has the honor of serving as Montana’s governor the longest, though he was governor in the territorial days so you can always say it doesn’t count.\n\nPotts was from Ohio originally and only came to Montana because he was sent here.\n\nWhen James M. Ashley was removed from his post as territorial governor by President Ulysses S. Grant in December 1869 it was a man named Scribner that was chosen to fill his shoes.\n\nHe did so, serving as acting territorial governor for about eight months, until August 1870 when Benjamin F. Potts was appointed.\n\nBy the 1870s the people of Montana needed new leadership, and especially leaders that wouldn’t skip out or die on them, like most had done before. They got such a man in Benjamin Potts.\n\nPotts was born in Fox Township, Ohio, on January 29, 1863. His family never had much money, and Potts attended regular schools and found regular work.\n\nHe was a clerk in a dry goods store before attending Westminster College for a year in Pennsylvania until the money ran out. At that point he headed back to Ohio and taught school while also studying law at night.\n\nBy 1859 he’d passed the bar and set up his own practice. He got into politics and attended the 1860 Democratic National Convention, throwing his support behind Stephen Douglas. Things went the other way, however, and the next year the Civil War broke out.\n\nPotts was all over the place during the conflict, and was even captured following the Battle of Harpers Ferry in 1862. Sent to Camp Douglas, he was eventually swapped in a prisoner exchange.\n\nHe was promoted to lieutenant colonel a short time later and then to colonel just a couple weeks after that. It was no surprise. Potts reorganized the badly demoralized 32nd Ohio Infantry and got them ready for serious action. And they made a dent in the war effort. The Siege of Vicksburg, Champion Hill, Meridian…Potts was at them all and made major contributions.\n\nAfter his performance during the Battle of Atlanta, Division Commander Giles A. Smith officially wrote that “Colonel Potts did more, on the 22d of July, 1864, to save the good name of the Army of the Tennessee, than any other man.”\n\nBy the time hostilities had finished, Potts had been promoted to the brevet rank of major general. In January, 1866, he headed back to Ohio and picked up his law practice where he’d left off. He also had a change of political heart, and switched his allegiance to the Republicans.\n\nThat enabled him to get elected to the Ohio State Senate in 1867. He didn’t go unnoticed, and three years later in 1870 President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him governor of the Montana Territory.\n\nBenjamin Potts was one of the rare politicians to come to Montana in the 1870s that was actually able to get things done.\n\nHis bipartisan approach to governing settled things down in the territory, such as the vigilante activities that’d been going on, as well as much of the general lawlessness that was so prevalent in a far-western territory. He was able to work effectively with Montana’s representative in Washington and legislation was passed to aid the growing territory, especially in regard to the railroads.\n\nAll good things must come to an end, however, and by 1882 politics in Washington had changed. President Garfield had been assassinated the previous year and Arthur took over. John Schuyler Crosby was appointed to fill Potts’ shoes.\n\nIt started an unfortunate chain of events where Montana was back to changing territorial governors every year or two. The 1870s had seen two territorial governors and much done. The 1880s would see six and not a whole lot accomplished.\n\nPotts stepped down on January 14, 1883, having served longer than any other territorial governor or state governor of Montana, nearly fourteen years.\n\nBenjamin Potts wasn’t done with politics yet, however. He got elected to the territorial legislature after his stint as governor was finished and served until his death in Helena on June 17, 1887. He was 51 years old.\n\nFor 17 years Potts served the people of Montana. Talk about dedication.\n\n​Governor John Erickson (1925-1933)\n\nJohn Erickson is the only governor in modern times to win a third term – his first was in 1924, he got his second in 1928, and then ran for an unprecedented third in 1932, and won it.\n\nHe resigned from that third term about 4 months after winning it, and with the promise from his lieutenant governor that he’d be appointed to fill the vacant U.S. Senate seat that’d come up in early-1933.\n\nThat was the Erickson-Cooney Deal, something the governor thought would cement his political future. Instead it ruined it.\n\nJohn Edward Erickson was born in Stoughton, Wisconsin, on March 14, 1863. He graduated from Washburn University in Kansas in 1890, passed the bar the following year, and began practicing in 1892.\n\nBy 1893 he was ready for a change and headed to Choteau, becoming Teton County attorney in 1897 and then judge of the eleventh judicial district of Montana in 1905, a position he held until 1915.\n\nBy 1916 Erickson was in Kalispell practicing law, which was where he was still when the opportunity to run for governor presented itself in 1924.\n\nGovernor Joseph Dixon was coming off a terrible first term and his chances at gaining a second looked slim to none, especially considering the Anaconda Company was so opposed to him.\n\nDixon lost the race handily, 88,801 to 74,126 and faded into obscurity, the company clouding all attempts to paint him as a reformer with the state’s best interests at heart.\n\n“Montana is usually equated with Clark, Daly, Heinze, Walsh, and Wheeler,” historian K. Ross Toole wrote in 1972, but “Dixon’s name not only belongs among them, it properly belongs at the top of the list.”\n\nErickson won the race against Dixon easily to become the eighth governor of Montana and he quickly set to work. One of the reasons he was so popular was because he got so much done:\n\nThe new state income tax was passed to ensure stability and protection from mining shutdowns.\n\nFunds for rural schools were started.\n\nTaxes on gasoline were first issued.\n\nBank laws were updated.\n\nMining profits were finally taxed, something politicians in the state had been calling for since Montana had been a territory.\n\nGovernor Erickson even gave national hero Charles Lindbergh a tour of Helena, its fairgrounds and Fort Harrison when the famed pilot came through in 1927.\n\nSo popular was Erickson that the corporate press gave him the moniker, “Honest John.”\n\nErickson’s only real challenge came in 1928 when he went for his second term.\n\nRepublican Wellington Rankin had again been elected Attorney General for Montana in 1924. By 1926 he’d been appointed U.S. Attorney for the state of Montana and in 1928 he chose to step down in favor of a run for governor against “Honest” John.\n\nThe Anaconda Standard called Wellington “At His Rankest” when he ran that year. Wellington's crime? He wanted less company control in Helena.\n\nIt was a landslide, with Erickson taking 113,635 votes to Wellington Rankin’s 79,777, or 58% to 41%.\n\nErickson ran again in 1932, going for an unprecedented third term. Not all Democrats were happy about this, and Erickson faced three men in the primary.\n\nIt was clear that resistance was there, but it wasn’t unified. Erickson beat out the competition, picking up 46% to his nearest competitor’s 21%. Still, if you add all his opponents together their combined take was 54%.\n\nThat November the Democratic tide was obvious across the nation as the Depression wore on and President Hoover stood by, powerless to stop it.\n\nNovember 8 was election day and FDR took it handily with 59% of the vote compared to Hoover’s 36% in the state. Socialist candidate Norman Thomas took nearly 4%.\n\nDespite the rising swell of Democratic fervor in the rest of the nation, Montana was evenly divided on what course that state should take. A large part of this no doubt came down to Erickson’s decision to buck tradition and run for that third term.\n\nThe gubernatorial election was close but Erickson again won, defeating Frank A. Hazelbaker 104,949 votes to 101,105 votes, or 49% to 47%. The Socialists got nearly 3% and the Communist and Liberty candidate received about 1% between them.\n\nWithout the third party competition Erickson very well could have bee defeated. But he wasn’t and went on to become the only governor of the state to serve three terms. It wasn’t an enviable position to be in, as the economy was terrible and showed no signs that it would, or even could, improve.\n\nAnd then in 1933 Senator Walsh died, Erickson made a deal with his lieutenant governor to step down then get appointed to the seat, and Montana never forgave him.\n\n“The Erickson-Cooney ‘deal’ provoked widespread protest in Montana,” historian Michael Malone tells us, “sapped the popularity of both men” and “caused serious tension within the Democratic Party.”\n\nThe lingering stress of that as well as the usual stress of the office likely proved too much for Erickson’s successor, Governor Cooney, who died about a year and a half after taking office.\n\nErickson would practice law in Helena until he died in 1946 at the age of 83, largely forgotten by the Party he’d lifted up 20 years earlier.\n\n​Governor Thomas Judge (1973-1981)\n\nIt wouldn’t be until 1980 that a governor ran for a third term again, when Tom Judge decided to go for it.\n\nThomas Lee Judge was born in Helena on October 12, 1934. He got a BA in Journalism from Notre Dame and then headed off to the University of Louisville for graduate studies. He’d eventually graduate from the United States Army Adjutant General School at Indiana’s Fort Benjamin Harrison.\n\nJudge was a Second Lieutenant in the US Army and a captain in the US Army Adjutant General Corps in the US Army Reserves from 1958 to 1964.\n\nIn 1960, four years before getting out of the Army, he started up a public relations firm. He also decided to run for the Montana House of Representatives and was elected. He’d go on to serve three terms until 1967 when he switched to the Montana Senate, where he’d serve until 1969.\n\nIt was in 1969 that Judge was elected lieutenant governor, a position he’d hold until 1973. It was in 1972 that Forrest Anderson decided not to run for a second term and Judge decided to go for his seat.\n\nHe ran in 1972, beating out Republican rancher and legislator Ed Smith 172,623 votes to 146,231 votes, or 54% to 46%.\n\nJudge was too conservative a Democrat for some, but he was damn popular with the public.\n\nJudge’s main accomplishments during his two terms related to the “strong environmental laws that were enacted in Montana in the 1970s.”\n\nEnvironmental bills that Judge saw pass were the:\n\nStrip mine reclamation act\n\nThe major utility siting act\n\nThe subdivision regulation act\n\nThe stream bank protection act\n\nThe hard rock mining act\n\nThe Montana water use act\n\nThe Montana Environmental Protection Act\n\nAnd tougher clean-air and clean-water laws\n\nJudge also resided over state passage of some of the best worker’s compensation laws in the country.\n\n​He increased state spending on education by 236% during his time in office. That included doubling the university system’s budget.\n\nAlso during his time in office the Montana investment program earned $311 million.\n\nIn 1978 he also instituted a state employee hiring freeze, something that resulted in 400 fewer state employees. Because of these changes “state government was able to assume a substantial accumulation of new responsibilities without increasing the taxes.”\n\nMontanans saw $100 million in property and income tax relief under Judge’s tenure.\n\nSo it was no surprise that Montanans liked him, nor was it a surprise that Judge thought he could win a third term.\n\nSuch was not the case.\n\nHe lost in the 1980 primary to his lieutenant governor, Ted Schwinden…something we profiled in a post called Fair, Helena, Governor.\n\nIt’s true that Judge was the favorite in the primary, but Schwinden was seen as the top competitor. Schwinden ended up taking it 51% to Judge’s 42%, with the other two candidates splitting the remaining 7%.\n\nJudge would come back and try again when Schwinden’s two terms were up in 1988 and the governor made it clear he wouldn’t run for another.\n\nIt was a packed primary that year, with six men running. Judge took 39% of the vote to nearest competitor Frank Morrison’s 27%. Mike Greely took 23% and the other three candidates managed 11%, showing it was quite up in the air that year.\n\n(Frank Morrison is the dad of former State Auditor John Morrison.)\n\nIt’s not surprising that Judge came back and won like that. “For many Democrats – even those who’d previously voted him out of office – his tenure marked the high water mark of progressive politics.”\n\nJudge’s “1970s-brand liberalism was the best the Democrats had to offer in 1988,” but Montana wasn’t ready to welcome back its 18th governor as its 20th. Republican Stan Stephens got in 52% to 46%, with Libertarian William Morris taking about 2%.\n\nThat’s what many of us are afraid will happen in 2020 when Schweitzer goes for his third term.\n\nWill he defeat up-and-coming prospects in the primary only to lose in the general, like Judge did?\n\nOr will his popularity with the public, and favorable relations with the corporate press, carry him to a third term like it did for Erickson?\n\nPotts was the only one to leave the governor’s office for the legislature, and though the U.S. House is a much bigger version of that legislature, I and most others don’t see Schweitzer going for it.\n\nBut we do see him going for Bullock’s job come 2020.\n\nCould Schweitzer be governor from 2004 to 2012 and again from 2020 to 2024…maybe even 2028?\n\nIt’s possible, and if anyone can do it, he can…right?\n\nI really should be working on my Book 6 bibliography but it’s messy and I’m putting it off.\n\nSo let’s talk.\n\nThere’s not a whole lot going on in the news.\n\nI wrote that sentence a week ago, and it pretty much still holds true.\n\nLots of motorcycle crashes, some ATV deaths, boating mishaps…the typical summer fare in Montana.\n\nThere’s a new bout of forest fires going on in my area – to the south of me in Hamilton and to the northwest in Thompson Falls, I believe – but I think we expected that’d happen eventually.\n\nI will say that I didn’t encounter much road construction on the way to Helena from Missoula last week, and that was nice.\n\nYeah, I headed over to hit up the Last Chance Stampede and Rodeo and carnival and fair and all the rest of it.\n\nI should have taken my camera to get some images for you, but oh well.\n\nIt’s the usual rickety rides, high-priced and artery-clogging food, and interesting-looking people.\n\nMy 5-year-old son Paul and I got some wristbands so we could go on the rides as much as we want.\n\nWe hit up the Mardi Gras mirror house about two dozen times, went on Dizzy Dragons spinny-go-round-thing about a dozen, and even on Bubba’s Roadhouse a few times.\n\nThe latter is a fun house with moving floors and such, so I had to carry Paul through much of it. That’s why we went a few times.\n\nI took him on the mini-dragon roller coaster too, but he was screaming so much they had to stop it and let us off.\n\nI went on the Star Spinner and Kamikaze by myself and felt like I’d be sick afterward.\n\nInstead we just went back to the grandparents’ house because Paul was tired.\n\nI decided to go to the Historical Society.\n\nI actually went up to the Historical society for an hour an a half around lunch time, then an hour before closing too.\n\nI wish I could have stayed longer, but I did find time to get back the next day and get the last bit on Schwinden, the new Constitution, and the coal tax trust fund so I can finish my 6th book of the state’s history.\n\nI got some research done at the historical society on Forrest Anderson and Tom Judge too.\n\nBoth were Montana governors in the 60s and 70s.\n\nGovernor Tom Judge\n\nBoy, Tom Judge was like the rock star of progressive Democrats back in the day.\n\nWhat I find so amazing is that the guy had two terms then ran for his third but was defeated by his own lieutenant governor in the primary.\n\nWhen that lieutenant governor, Ted Schwinden, had his own two gubernatorial terms come to an end in 1988, Tom Judge came out of nowhere and won the Democratic primary.\n\nSome might remember that Frank Morrison was a big contender that year, but he only got 27% to Judge’s 39%.\n\nMy it was a packed primary in 1988, with 6 teams running for the top state offices.\n\nIt’s not surprising that Judge came back and won like that, really. “For many Democrats – even those who’d previously voted him out of office – his tenure marked the high water mark of progressive politics,” the Missoulian said in an editorial.\n\nPat Williams said Judge “was the most aggressive governor in my lifetime. He came along in the heyday of progressives and was one.”\n\n​Bob Brown called him “very approachable” and a “philosophical liberal,” but one “more open to solutions than confrontations.”\n\nJudge’s “1970s-brand liberalism was the best the Democrats had to over in 1988,” but Montana wasn’t ready to welcome back its 18th governor as its 20th. Republican Stan Stephens got in. The vote was 52% to 46% with Libertarian William Morris taking about 2%.\n\nJudge got into real estate and securities after that and spent much of his remaining years in Chandler, Arizona.\n\nIt was due to his health, and his separation from his second wife in 2003 probably didn’t help with that\n\nWho knows, maybe it gave him some peace for his last years. He died on September 8, 2006, of pulmonary fibrosis related to rheumatoid arthritis. He was 71 years old.\n\nGovernor Judge and Lt. Governor Schwinden, c 1976\n\nSomething that’s not talked about much is the bloodbath that took place in 1979-80 when Democrats weren’t sure if Judge was going to run for a third term or not.\n\n​Ted Schwinden’s Run\n\nLots of people were asking Schwinden what his plans were, and he fussed about, saying it relied on what Judge would do.\n\nThe uncertainty of the race “made it difficult for would-be endorsers to come out of the closet for fear of alienating Judge only to have Schwinden decide against a gubernatorial bid,” the IR wrote at the time.\n\nIt was also clear at the time that “pro-Schwinden forces” had been letting potential supporters “know for months that they’d like Judge to step aside and give the lieutenant governor a crack at the state’s top job.”\n\nMany thought Judge might forgo a third term as governor to challenge Representative Ron Marlenee for the eastern district U.S. House seat.\n\nSchwinden did indeed have his fans. They liked the “scrappiness” of his appearance, as opposed to the “three-piece-suit panache of Judge.”\n\nHe had his detractors as well, who labeled Schwinden as “sometimes arrogant, often aloof and as having a tendency to lecture audiences.” He’d also been known to rise “to the bait of hecklers, most recently at a session with angry truckers in Missoula.”\n\nI feel Schwinden was pretty fierce in getting his way, which meant Judge would not be winning that primary.\n\nIt was a close one in 1980, with Schwinden getting 51% to Judge’s 42%.\n\nI wish there would have been more articles in the files on that race, but sadly, there’s not much.\n\nThere’s always the state newspapers on microfilm to go through, but boy, that’s a hassle.\n\nPerhaps you remember something about those times.\n\nMaybe you don’t want to. Schwinden, at the behest of legislative Republicans, pushed through $100 million in tax cuts. For some reason Schwinden signed this, saying “the public elects the Legislature, so its actions reflect the public will.”\n\nHistorian Richard Roeder described this as “a pretty passive role of leadership.”\n\nThen there were the cuts to the university system in 1985-86.\n\nOf course, I could get into the benefits that Schwinden brought – unprecedented openness in government, a Build Montana infrastructure program that pumped hundreds of millions into the economy, the “Made in Montana” program.\n\nThat would take up a lot more text, however.\n\nMaybe you’d like to talk about some of those policies. If so, feel free to comment.\n\n​Oh, and here are some of those images from the Nelson area too that I promised you last week.\n\nRoad to Nelson from York\n\nI’m having a fun time writing my 6th book of Montana history.\n\nIt’ll cover the years 1960 to 1990 and I thought I’d go ahead and share some with you today.\n\n​Monsanto Poisons the Public with Glyphosate\n\nMonsanto first introduced glyphosate to the world in 1974 when it released its weed-killing product Roundup. By 1980 Roundup was a bestseller.\n\nGlyphosate was a “pre-engineered answer to a new world of patented GMO seed.” Prior to its use in crops it “was used as a scaling agent to clean lime and other water deposits from industrial pipes.” It’d originally been discovered in 1950 by a Swiss chemist but no one could find a use for it.\n\nThen in 1970 a Monsanto scientist discovered that it could act as a powerful herbicide. The Rockefeller Foundation began pouring money into research starting in 1972, perhaps viewing the herbicide as a way to control population. That same year World Bank head Robert McNamara said that world population control was needed.\n\nThe companies and the world monetary and governmental organizations sold glyphosate on the idea that it’d increase crop yields, thus ending hunger around the world.\n\nIn reality the compound destroyed soil microbiology. This was known when it was first sold in 1974, as farmers used it exclusively to kill all vegetation that was sprayed.\n\nBesides killing plants that grow, glyphosate also kills human gut microbes. We can trace the world’s increase in disease to the infusion of “cheap, chemical-laden foods” filling our diets.\n\nHow it works is that glyphosate inhibits CYP enzymes in the body, enzymes that are critical to our gut’s bacteria. We need this bacteria because it detoxifies xenobiotics, or foreign substances in the body.\n\nBecause we’re now eating so many glyphosate-laced foods, we don’t have enough of this beneficial bacteria in our gut to stop other toxins, toxins that ironically are now being enhanced by the glyphosate.\n\nThese toxins then take over our body’s immune system, increasing inflammation and damaging our cellular systems. Dangerous substances are allowed to break into the blood, and at that point the poison can penetrate every organ in the body as the blood-brain barrier has been crossed.\n\nIn effect, glyphosate acts as a channel for disease. “As glyphosate depletes this microbiology, they are essentially destroying the human race from the inside out – ever so silently.”\n\nIt wouldn’t be until 1996 that Monsanto developed their “Roundup-ready” line of genetically modified soybeans, corn, and cotton. Planting started in the US.\n\nPrior to that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) had only been used in tobacco plants in America. Now the food supply would be hit with the stuff. In 1974 American farmers had used 0.8 million pounds of glyphosate on their crops but by 1995 they were using 28 million pounds.\n\nGlyphosate was the most widely-used pesticide in the country, with Atrazine and metolachlor coming in next. In 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glysophate as a “probable human carcinogen.” This was based on “increased prevalence of rare liver and kidney tumors in chronic animal feeding studies.”\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, incidences of liver cancer have “more than tripled since 1980.” About 24,000 Americans die from liver cancer each year now.\n\n​In regards to kidney cancer, the American Cancer Society tells us that “for reason that are not totally clear, the rate of new kidney cancers had been rising since the 1990s.” As of this writing, more than 14,000 American die from kidney cancer each year.\n\nPeople know something is wrong with their food supply. For years people and governments have tried to get labels on their food telling them if the food has been genetically modified, such as with GMO seeds, or sprayed with GMO-seed supporting herbicides like glyphosate.\n\nThey’re blocked time and time again, however, as Monsanto and other large corporations do not want the truth to come out. If people knew that their food was poisoning them, those companies would lose money. To them, nothing is more important than money.\n\nIn 2000 the patent for glyphosate expired, meaning lots of other companies besides Monsanto could produce and market it.\n\nIn Europe glyphosate is used on up to 40% of crops. In 2015 the World Health Organization concluded that glyphosate “probably” caused cancer. It came to those conclusions after looking at a 1985 study on mice, one that had been rejected by the FDA at the time.\n\nBy 2016 1.7 billion pounds of glyphosate were being used annually.\n\n​The Waves of Corporate Consolidation\n\nAdvertising has always been a big business in America. In 1880 total advertising volume in the country was $200 million but by 1920 that’d risen to $3 billion.\n\nThe huge uptick was “fueled in part by the increased availability of consumer credit” on such items as “automobiles, radios, household appliances, and leisure time activities like spectator sports and movies.”\n\nThe rise of TV in the 1960s further boosted spending on advertising as more and more companies sought the disposable income of American consumers. It was clear that TV networks could make large corporations a lot of money. For that reasons the buyouts began.\n\nMergers had been nothing new in America, for they’d been going on in the 1890s during the robber baron days. In the 1910s and 1920s the second wave of mergers started, primarily in “banking, retailing, steel, chemicals, and food products.”\n\nThe third wave of American mergers started in the mid-1950s and went to 1969, with the peak “go-go boom of 1962-1969.” This period was defined by conglomerate-type mergers, which made up 60% of all mergers. These were primarily in the electronics and military industries.\n\nThe fourth wave of American mergers got started in the 1980s. A big spur to this was the deregulation of the airline, trucking, natural gas, and banking industries by President Carter, and the deregulation of the telephone industry by Reagan. President Reagan also took an “openly relaxed” approach to antitrust policies, another spur to big corporations to merge.\n\nIn 1984 Standard of California took over Gulf Oil for $25 billion. In 1985 Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company merged for $4.9 billion.\n\nIn 1988 there was a leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for $25 billion. Those were the two largest consolidations of the 1980s, oil and snack foods.\n\nThere were other large deals as well. In 1985 Capital Cities Communication bought ABC for $3.5 billion and General Electric bought RCA, the owner of NBC, for $6.3 billion.\n\nIn 1989 Time Inc. merged with Warner Bros. in a $14 billion deal.\n\nThere were large consolidations in the American advertising industry as well. In 1982 and 1983 alone, “eight sizable agencies were bought by larger ones.” They were big money ventures. In 1987 WPP Group acquired J. Walter Thompson Co. for $566 million.\n\n“Agency consolidations were driven by three factors,” an Ad Age report tells us, and those were:\n\n​\n\n“Banks and other lending institutions were willing to finance highly leveraged acquisitions; agencies that were bringing in huge profits had money to spend on acquisitions; and agencies were looking for ways to increase profitability.”\n\nLarger corporations saw the revenue potential that advertising agencies could bring, and by 1990 there were just about 30 independent advertising agencies left in the country, down from the 100 that existed in 1980.\n\nA large reason for the acquisitions was the changing nature of TV advertising. The networks no longer had the same power now that cable TV was encroaching on their audience.\n\nBig network viewership dropped below 60% in the early-90s. Cable TV home-shopping networks also rose up to cut into advertising’s profits.\n\nIn response, advertisers dropped the standard 30-second TV advertising spot to 15 seconds in an effort to increase the number of ads seen while also decreasing the cost. In 1986 a new TV ad record was set when “The Cosby Show” began asking for $400,000 to air a 30-second spot.\n\nThere was a stall in mergers in the early-90s due to the recession but then the fifth wave of American mergers started up around 1994. “Its pattern is eerily similar to the century-ago wave of the 1890s,” Monthly Review wrote in 2001.\n\nIn 1995 CBS was bought by Westinghouse for $5.4 billion. In 1996 Capital Cities Communication, the owner of ABC, was bought by Disney Corp. for $19 billion. That same year Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner, Inc. In 1999 Viacom bought CBS for $37 billion. In 2000 Time Warner, Inc. merged with America Online.\n\nIt was seen as a mega-deal, but by 2004 Ted Turner’s personal stake in the stock of those companies dropped from $7 billion to $2 billion as more and more people abandoned AOL to browse the web on their own.\n\nBy the late-1990s mergers and acquisitions were averaging $76 billion a deal. In 1999 worldwide merger deals reached $3.4 trillion, which was equal to 34% of all of America’s industrial buildings, plants, equipment and machinery. All in an attempt to increase consumerism.\n\nBy 2015 the American advertising industry had grown to $180 billion, the largest amount spent by any country. China comes in second with $90 billion. Most of that advertising is on TV, with $71 billion spent through that medium in the US in 2015.\n\n2016 expects to see $200 billion spent on American ads.\n\n​The Consolidation of the Banking Industry\n\nThe Securities Industry Assn. “counted 244,000 brokers and back-office staff” on Wall Street in 1986, “up from the 134,000 in 1980.” The October 1987 crash was hard on Wall Street, however, and employment “plummeted” to 209,000.\n\nBanking was an industry that merged a lot in the 1980s. At the end of 1984 there were 15,084 commercial banks, independent banks, and thrift holding companies. By the end of 2003, however, that number had fallen 48% to 7,842.\n\nThe vast majority of the decline in banks happened in the community banking sector, though it still makes up 94% of all banking. It’s also important to note that 3,097 new banking organizations opened during that time as well.\n\nDuring those years the banking industry’s assets grew from $3.3 trillion to $9.1 trillion, an increase of 70%.\n\nThose assets were not evenly distributed across the industry, as organizations with $10 billion in assets saw their numbers increase by 31% during those years while organizations with assets of less than $1 billion saw their numbers drop by 14%.\n\nBanks with assets of less than $100 million saw their numbers drop 6% so that in 2003 they only made up 2% of the entire banking industry.\n\nBy 2003 a quarter of the nation’s bank deposits were held by just three large banks – Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. In 1984 a total of 42 banks had held that many deposits.\n\nOne bank alone, Bank of America Corporation, held nearly 10% of the banking industry’s assets by 2003, which came out to $512 billion in deposits and another $870 billion in assets.\n\nThe reason for this decline in banks was due to “a growing concentration of industry assets among a few dozen extremely large financial institutions.”\n\n​Notes\n\n“American Advertising: A Brief History.” History Matters.

I will add that this history is a bit dated.\n\nThat’s a huge problem with our Montana historians – their inability to put much on the shelf for future generations to look at. Sorry, “professional” historians. Montana’s amateur historians have been showing you up for years.\n\nUnless you’ve got some letters behind your name and some fancy degrees hanging on your office wall, however, people don’t give a damn about you. That’s why we’ll take a look at what David Emmons had to say about Montana during the first few years of the Racicot Administration. We start with population.\n\nEmmons goes off of the 1990 Census for his figures, which gave a population count of 800,204 for Montana.\n\nHe mentions that by February 1993 the state had lost an additional 24,000 people from that low number, however, effectively wiping out the 12,000-person gain we’d experienced over the 1980s (786,690 was the 1980 Montana population).\n\nMontana wasn’t growing much at that time, probably because we’d done away with our natural resource jobs. He mentions that, and the accepted historiography of Montana:\n\n​\n\n“The popular version of Montana’s history was essentially written by two men. Joseph Kinsey Howard said the place was high, wide, handsome – and a colony of eastern corporations. K. Ross Toole said it was an uncommon land, a state of extremes – and the plaything of reactionary capital. There was little subtlety to either man’s analysis: from the fur traders of the nineteenth century to the coal barons of the twentieth, Montana gave up its material treasure as well as its political chastity to plunderers.” (Emmons, p 121)\n\n​\n\nThat’s the common version of history up until those two men stopped writing about the state – the 1940s and 1970s respectively, though Toole did manage a few essays before he died in August 1981. After that the state’s history and the interpretation of it was left to one man.\n\nSince 1975, Emmons writes, Michael Malone “has been fighting a lonely battle against this whining and self-pitying interpretation of Montana’s past.”\n\nMalone – who died in December 1999 – asserted that the Anaconda Company had never truly been in control of the state, and wrote such. He went against Howard’s idea that the “copper trust” had driven homegrown Fritz Augusta Heinze from the state as well as Toole’s idea that the legislatures were controlled by the Company.\n\nMalone came back “in 1985 and 1986” to tell us that the state’s history “was not uncommon” as Toole had proposed. He pointed out “that although the Company had at times been heavy-handed, so had other companies in other western states.”\n\nEmmons felt that this interpretation was the right one, for the victimization attitude that both Howard and Toole had foisted upon the state was hurting more than helping.\n\nMontanans didn’t view their plights as caused by world economic conditions that made them feel like flotsam on some giant sea, but by a local company – however international it had become – which they could see and feel firsthand. This created an “anti-corporate” attitude in the state “that severely limited its ability to adjust to changes in national and international markets.”\n\nEmmons is a firm believer in the Montana sales tax, and claims that “people raised on conspiracy theories” are the main reason it hasn’t passed, either in 1971 or 1993, though he fails to mention the push for the tax in either the 1930s or the 1950s.\n\nOur lack of a sales tax “punishes industry and business” in Montana “all in order to get even with the Company.” Emmons makes it plain that Montanans cling to this attitude because of “self-indulgence,” or “the avoidance of all responsibility by the assignment of blame to sinister outside forces.”\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​Emmons mentions UM economist Thomas Power’s idea that Montana’s extractive industry is doing it more harm than good, leaving “deep scars in the state’s collective psyche; it enfeebles the people and leaves them politically helpless.”\n\nHis answer? A consumption economy over a production economy.\n\n​\n\nHigh Montana Wages with Extraction\n\nThat didn’t sound too good to many, but what choices were there? Montana in the early-90s was not the place it had been even twenty years before.\n\nAnaconda Copper left Montana in 1977, having gone bankrupt after Chile nationalized their vast copper mining holdings there. It was a fundamental shift in Montana politics and Montana economics.\n\nButte ceased to be relevant in either, though it took decades for that realization to come about, and for many it still hasn’t.\n\nThe Company had been the driver of the state for nearly a century, both politically and economically. In terms of thought control, it had that too, for Anaconda Copper owned virtually all of the major daily newspapers. What they didn’t say was often more telling than what they did.\n\nWithout Anaconda Copper, Montana wouldn’t be what it is today, and its likely many of your neighbors wouldn’t be who they are. The Company’s effect on the state was so great because so many other industries were dependent upon their business. Emmons makes this clear when he shows us some numbers:\n\n​\n\n“In 1946 ACM produced 3.7 million ounces of silver; 30,000 ounces of gold; 1.47 million pounds of molybdenum; 1.55 million pounds of cadmium; 4,883 tons of arsenic; 15.6 million pounds of lead; 1.5 million pounds of zinc; 111,397 tons of manganese; and 742 million pounds of copper. It was the largest and most diversified copper company among the big five and probably in the world.” (Emmons, p 123)\n\n​\n\n​All of this sent Montana’s per capita income to levels 16% higher than the national average.\n\nBill Montgomery was one example. He started at the smelter in Anaconda in 1948, making $18 per day. “That’s more than four times the $4 per day his dad made starting at the foundry,” the Montana Standard wrote years later.\n\nThey were good times, and coming right after the war too. They helped the state grow. Good times don’t last in Montana, however, for it’s a state of cycles in all things.\n\nIn 1955 Butte started open-pit mining and over the years more and more workers lost their jobs to automation and the nature of mining post-WWII. Unions in Butte were powerless to stop this, as they let their political paranoia outweigh their good sense.\n\nIn 1950 the International Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers “was expelled for alleged Communist sympathies” from the Congress of Industrial Organizations, or CIO, Emmons tells us. On top of this open-pit mining reduced the need for workers and also made mining more strike-proof. “Open pits could be shut down and left untended unlike underground mines which could fill with water or face the threat of fire.”\n\nAll of this emboldened Anaconda Copper to face down strikers, something it’d been quite successful at before. “In 1912, 1914, 1917-20, 1933-34, and 1967,” Emmons tells us, “the Company faced, and faced down, genuine labor-management crises.”\n\nHe also says that “job-conscious pragmatists and ethnic exlusionists in the various miners unions” helped the Company defeat the strikers. Over time this meant that 16% higher per capita income would be going down.\n\n​\n\n​Emmons points out that 1957 was almost more important than 1959 when it came to information in the state.\n\nThe former was the year the Legislative Council formed to aid legislators in their work. Company lobbyists had done the job before then. The latter was the year the Company sold its newspapers to Lee Enterprises.\n\nChanges kept coming. The early-60s saw Montana Power let loose from Anaconda Company control. The early-70s saw the Company leave the legislature. Everyone who was a drinker knew the game was up, for Helena’s open bars came to an end.\n\n“A part of political life in Montana for almost a century, the Company’s open bars were a favorite gathering place for lobbyists and legislators,” Emmons tells us. “Their closure convinced even the most skeptical that a new age was dawning.”\n\nThat new age was clear the very next year when a constitutional convention was called. It passed “with no overt opposition by the state’s major corporations.”\n\n​\n\nAnaconda Closes Down\n\nEmmons figured that the Company “was distracted” as 1972 was also the year its Chilean mining holdings were seized by Salvador Allende. That spelled the end of the Company and after going through “receivership and reorganization” was sold to Atlantic Richfield Corporation (ARCO) in 1977.\n\nARCO made big promises to the people of Montana, including running the mines and smelters “at full bore” while “payrolls and investments would grow.”\n\nThe new company was good on its promise for two years before they changed their tune. The smelters in Anaconda and Great Falls were closed on a day that came to be known as “Black Monday” in the state.\n\nIt was September 29, 1980, and ARCO announced that both cities would lose the plants, causing “$40 million in lost annual wages and fringe benefits,” according to the Associated Press of the time.\n\nJim Marvin was president of ARCO at the time and said it was due to the company’s “inability to economically meet state and federal environmental regulations.”\n\nThe closure that day resulted in “between 1,000 and 1,200 smelter workers” losing their job, with “several hundred more” seeing layoffs over the year.\n\nThe City of Anaconda was hit hard, with 2,784 people leaving the workforce from 1970 to 1990. Bill Montgomery, who’d started at the smelter in 1948 at $18 a day, managed to hold on until 1982, “helping complete the shutdown.” After that he was laid off, “with no other positions available and three kids still in school.”\n\nMontgomery eventually got a job with a different mining company to help tear down the smelter. Retirement finally came in 1990, not in congratulation of his 42 years of service to the state, but because of a back injury.\n\nEmmons tells us that Silver Bow County saw 20,000 people leave between the end of WWII and 1990, which made up 40% of its people. Deer Lodge County, where the City of Anaconda is, lost 41% of its population, or 7,000 people.\n\n​\n\nThe Railroads Decline\n\nIn 1985 the Milwaukee Road closed, one of the state’s major railroads. “Its depots became restaurants,” Emmons tells us, “also since failed.” This had a dramatic effect on the eastern portion of the state, as Emmons notes:\n\n​\n\n“Between 1960 and 1970, thirty-nine of Montana’s fifty-six counties lost population. Most of those thirty-nine were in the wheat and cattle country in the eastern part of the state. All told, the rural farm population fell from 175,707 in 1940 to 88,460 in 1970 to under 80,000 in 1990.”\n\n​So bad were these changes that ten of Montana’s eastern counties have been considered for “deprivatization” and “inclusion in the Big Open section of the Buffalo Commons.”\n\nBy 1990 we lost our second U.S. House seat, one we’d had since 1912. Pat Williams’ win that year over Ron Marlenee proved “mostly that western Montana added a few people and eastern Montana lost a lot.”\n\nIt may have been hard for many to see these changes coming, but they should have.\n\nIt’s likely that the coal, oil and gas boom of the mid-70s blinded them, or just made them want to be blinded. That lasted five years before reaching the inevitable bust that all Montana booms experience eventually.\n\nEmmons gives us a hint of what this was like, though barely:\n\n​\n\n“The result was a classic Montana boom, followed by a classic Montana bust. The numbers are too sad to recount. Suffice it to say that for a time, there were jobs, the state and county coffers were full, roads were repaired, schools were built, the poor and marginalized of the state were treated with the dignity they deserved. (Midwestern consumers of Montana coal even paid the state the ultimate compliment” they referred to Montanans as “blue eyed Arabs.”)”\n\nIt didn’t last, however, and by 1975 “the boom began to sound choked and muffled” and by 1980 “the most attentive listener could not have discerned the trace of an echo.”\n\nEmmons tells us this same cycle was followed by the lumber and wood products industry.\n\n“By 1979, there were almost 11,000 jobs in Montana’s woods and mills,” he tell us. “By 1982, there were only slightly more than 7,100.” Sawmills decreased substantially, going from 330 in 1956 to 141 in 1981 to 80 in 1993. It was a 29% drop in lumber production between 1979 and 1982 and then another 14% drop between 1988 and 1991. Emmons expected the industry would shed another 6,500 jobs over the 1990s.\n\nFor the state this spelled disaster, and in more ways than one. Natural resources made up 24% of the state’s 1983 revenues. By 1980 that had fallen to 11%. “Some of this was owing to tax cuts designed to stimulate production,” Emmons says, and adds “the cuts did not work.”\n\nMontanans didn’t know what to do, as for decades they’d been told to work the land and all would be provided. Now that wasn’t the case, and it had a profound psychological impact that Emmons diagnoses well:\n\n“Montana historically had one simple responsibility: give up treasures. It discharged that responsibility in a variety of ways. It grew wheat, raised cattle, mined ores, cut trees, milled raw lumber, dug coal, drilled for oil and natural gas, and dammed and put turbines on its rivers. Discovering the world no longer needed what generations of Montanans had made had a far more chilling effect on the state’s collective psyche than had any alleged subservience to ACM.” (Emmons, p 128)\n\n​\n\n​Conclusion\n\nEmmons makes it clear that tourism is seen by many as the answer, and that this answer has not come.\n\n​“Tourism does not require the state’s resources be plundered; neither does it pay very well.”\n\nFor that good pay, Montana needs good employers. Alas, despite all that we have to offer in the way of natural beauty, it’s the coastal cities to the west of us that attract the top industries of today. “Montana’s quality of life is, in fact, enviable,” Emmons writes, “but there is a very short line of employers waiting to share in it.”\n\nBy 1990 Montana’s per capital income was 17% below the national average. We fell 33% over 32 years.\n\n“The state is still a long way from major markets, its tax structure is still archaic, its university system is in disarray, and too many of its citizens still evince symptoms of historically (and historian-) induced paranoia.”\n\n​\n\n“More certain is that the present generation of Montanans will have to reinvent the state and cast it in a new image. A great deal is riding on them. They can succeed only if they pay proper attention and respect to the old ways of making a Montana living as they go about the task of finding new ways.”\n\n​\n\nThe “present generation” had their time come and go in the 1990s. They did nothing.\n\nNow we look to others for the answers. They’re out their, waiting…ready. All they need is for those that came before to step aside, finally step aside.\n\nWe’ve discussed Montana celebrities on this site many times now, and in this latest post in the series I thought we could pull back the lens a bit.\n\nWhen did Montana celebrities start coming to the state, and how do locals feel about that?\n\nThe internet can only take you so far with that question, and if you want to get to the bottom of things you have to go to the archives. I did that a week ago when I visited the Montana Historical Society Research Center.\n\nOn a whim I pulled open a drawer, looking for “famous Montana people.” I got more than I could have hoped for, and today I’ll share it with you. First, though, let’s list all of the Montana celebrities that we’ve profiled so far, with links to the article they appear in:\n\nStephen Ambrose\n\nJeff Ament\n\nEd Bearss\n\nDirk Benedict\n\nBrad Bird\n\nTom Brokaw\n\nDana Carvey\n\nConnie Chung\n\nLiz Claiborne\n\nGary Cooper\n\nJohn Dahl\n\nMonte Dolack\n\nPatrick Duffy\n\nBob Dylan\n\nDwan Edwards\n\nJohn Elway\n\nAl Feldstein\n\nMel Gibson\n\nJames Grady\n\nJack Hanna\n\nJack Horner\n\nChet Huntley\n\nPhil Jackson\n\nTed Kaczynski\n\nMichael Keaton\n\nEvel Knieval\n\nDavid Letterman\n\nHuey Lewis\n\nJohn Lithgow\n\nChristopher Lloyd\n\nHowie Long\n\nMyrna Loy\n\nDavid Lynch\n\nAndi MacDowell\n\nNorman Maclean\n\nMike Mansfield\n\nJohn Mayer\n\nSteve McQueen\n\nJoe Montana\n\nBrent Musburger\n\nWayne Newton\n\nChristopher Paolini\n\nMaury Povich\n\nCharley Pride\n\nDennis Quaid\n\nMarc Racicot\n\nJeannette Rankin\n\nSteve Reeves\n\nCharlie M. Russell\n\nSteven Seagall\n\nJ.K. Simmons\n\nKiefer Sutherland\n\nTed Turner​\n\nMichelle Williams\n\n​\n\nThese are the celebrities you said you wanted to hear about, at least in the comments of those posts. I’d like to add that I never would have started writing about Montana celebrities and famous Montana people if it wasn’t for this November 2013 post called Montana, What do You Want to Read?\n\nThe only person who commented on that post was a woman named Andrya Perez, who I knew while living in China. She wanted to know about famous Montana artists, something I thought was kind of silly. Boy was I dumb! Since writing these pieces they’ve become the most popular articles on my website, each and every month. They’ve also made me hundreds of dollars in advertising income. Shows you what I know.\n\nAlright, let’s stop wasting time and get to what you came here for – famous Montana celebrities. You won’t be disappointed!\n\n​Montana Celebrities in 1982\n\nIn a December 26, 1982, Montana Standard article called “Famous folks from afar settle in Montana,” reporter Steve Shirley tells us a bit more about Montana celebrities. The tidbits are short, but highlights include:\n\nJoe Robbie, “proprietor of the Miami Dolphins pro football team,” has a ranch near Ennis.\n\nChristopher Parkening, “an internationally known classical guitarist,” had a home in Bozeman.\n\nColonel Robert Stevens had a ranch near Two Dot. He was former secretary of the Army “and his family runs J.P. Stevens, the textile firm that’s had frequent squabbles with unions in recent years (it was the villain in the film ‘Norma Rae.”)\n\nVang Pao, “the Laotion [sic] guerrilla who fought communist troops with U.S. aid during the Vietnam War, has settled on a farm in the Bitterroot Valley.”\n\nMichael Cimino, “who won an Oscar for ‘The Deer Hunter,’ has a place near Glacier National Park.\n\nActor John McIntire, known from “Wagon Train” lived in northwest Montana in “the isolated Yaak country” with his wife Jeanette Nolan, who is known from the TV show “Dirty Sally.”\n\nThe Helena IR Profiles Montana Celebrities in 1986\n\nThe Helena Independent Record had a report from the Missoulian on October 26, 1986, called “Montana Connection: Writers, actors, musicians, heroes and villains, the high and the mighty, they all had a link to the Treasure State.”\n\nIn the piece you get a lot of older celebrities, people from the early- to mid-20th century. You also get some newer folks, and here are the highlights:\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald “spent the summer of 1915 on a ranch near White Sulphur Springs, which set the stage for his short story ‘The Diamond as Big as the Ritz.’”\n\nComedian Red Skelton visited Flathead Lake a lot during World War II, “but once he bought the wrong kind of hunting license and got caught.” The comedian was “given a stiff fine and had his gun taken away.” That caused Skelton to leave the Flathead Valley “with a bad taste in his mouth,” and he never returned.\n\nEarnest Hemingway was heading up to Billings with John Dos Pasos in late-1930 for a hunting trip. They were coming from Northern Wyoming “when their car went off the road between Park City and Laurel. Hemingway’s arm was fractured and he spent two months in St. Vincent Hospital in Billings, passing time by listening to the radio, getting to know a Mexican gambler who was also a patient, and talking with a nun.” This led him to write a story called “The Gambler, the Nun and the Radio,” which was eventually changed to “Give Us A Prescription, Doctor,” when it appeared in Scribners Magazine in May 1933.\n\nHank Williams, Jr. “fell off Ajax Mountain in Big Hole Country and was in critical condition” in 1975. “He recuperated at Missoula Community Medical Center and in 1983 came back to Missoula to help dedicate a new emergency center.”\n\n​Famous Montana Celebrities in 1990\n\nThe New York Times had an article on March 21, 1990, called “Stars Stake a Piece of Big Sky Country in a Great Ranch Rush.”\n\nMap showing the locations of Montana Celebrities, 1990\n\nThe piece was written by Jim Robbins and tells of the various movie stars coming to the state. “Brook Shields has just bought a place nearby,” he says of Big Timber, “Mel Gibson has a spread to the east, and Ted Turner has two ranches to the west.”\n\nHe mentions that “the Boulder River Valley is where most of the well-off have recently settled.” He describes the place as\n\n“End-of-the-road territory, a sublime stretch of dun-colored, boulder-strewn prairie, with hayfields and a narrow two-lane road that peters out beneath the mountain ramparts of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness Area, which lies northeast of Yellowstone National Park.”\n\nThe article really does a lot of name-dropping, as you can see:\n\n“Miss Shields is a recent addition to the valley. Michael Keaton has a place here. The novelist Tom McGuane has one on the West Fork of the Boulder River. So does Dave Grusin, the musician, and Robert D. Haas, chairman of Levi Strauss & Company, and owner of the Oakland A’s. Just north of Yellowstone National Park, Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan have a house. Jeff Bridges is a neighbor. So is Peter Fonda.”\n\nThe author goes on to say that this area of Montana isn’t unique when it comes to the celebrity treatment:\n\n“In southwestern Montana celebrities have swarmed to the Bitterroot Valley. The musicians Huey Lewis and Hank Williams Jr., the investment broker Charles Schwab, the actor Christopher Lloyd and Russ Francis, formerly with the New England Patriots, are among those with spreads here.”\n\n“I call it the Aspenization of Montana,” a rancher and writer by the name of Joel Bernstein said of the changes taking place back in 1990, when Big Timber had but 1,600 residents and the one restaurant and theatre were only open on the weekend. He’s worth quoting at length:\n\n“People come here and say they’re trying to escape places like California, but they’re not. They bring the world they come from with them. Since I’ve lived here I’ve seen more fences go up. You can’t do business with a handshake anymore. You’ve lost that sense of community.”\n\nMany likely feel the same way as Bernstein. After all, there’s no way native Montanans can afford the land these movie stars are buying up, unless they left the state and made their money elsewhere. The ranches “range in size from 500 to 10,000 acres or more, at prices that range anywhere from $250 to $1,000 an acre.”\n\nMuch of the animosity that Montanans feel toward celebrities can be traced to Ted Turner.\n\nTed Turner checking his 5,000-head bison herd on his Montana ranch\n\nThe business mogul and media tycoon bought up 128,000 square acres, or 200 square miles, “a huge block of land, even by Montana standards.” The reason for this was so he could fence it off and return it to native habitat for “elk, buffalo, and other wildlife.” Robbins describes what happened next:\n\n“The foreman of the Turner ranch placed an advertisement in the local papers warning hunters off the property. ‘Turner ranches are patrolled and all violators will be prosecuted,’ the advertisement advised. ‘Know your boundaries.’\n\nSportsmen were incensed. In response, one rancher near Helena, Harvey Irby, placed an advertisement in response that read: ‘Attention. Ted Turner. You are positively the only one denied permission to hunt on my ranch!’\n\nMr. Turner, who refused to be interviewed about his Montana property, apologized for the advertisements in a letter to Mr. Irby, but the damage had been done.”\n\nTed Turner in his Montana home, 2008\n\n​USA Weekend’s 1990 Look at Montana Celebrities\n\nUSA Weekend had a great report on Montana Celebrities in their May 25-27, 1990, issue. The article was called “Montana: The last best place” and has this amazing map of celebrity homes in Montana:\n\n1990 full-page map showing Montana celebrity homes\n\nClose up of the list of Montana celebrities\n\nThe number of visitors to the main tourist attractions of Montana jumped 24% from 1985 to 1989. “About 4.7 million people travelled to this state of 806,000 residents in 1988,” USA Weekend wrote in 1990, “and there was still plenty of elbow room.”\n\nDuring that time the state had “11 of the USA’s 100 best trout streams.”\n\nAccording to the Bozeman Area Chamber of Commerce in 1990, “an average square mile of land in Montana holds 3.3 deer, 1.2 elk or antelope (depending on where you happen to be), 896 keeper-size fish and five people.”\n\nIn 1990 a “typical 2,500 square foot house on five acres goes for $100,000,” the article said.\n\n​Besides those great economic numbers, the article is a treasure-trove of Montana celebrity information. Here are some highlights:\n\nMovie stars have been coming to Chico Hot Springs, “a celebrity hangout in Paradise Valley,” since 1974 when the film Rancho Deluxe was shot nearby. That starred Sam Waterston and Jeff Bridges, and that’s where Bridges met his wife, Sue, who was a hostess there.\n\nIn Stevensville there’s the Lonesome Dove Riding, Drinking and Flying Saloon, which was owned by Russ Francis, former tight end for the San Francisco 49ers. Huey Lewis was a regular there.\n\nThe Livingston Bar and Grill “has been transformed from an old Western bar into a local hip hangout for Jeff Bridges, Michael Keaton, and Dennis and Randy Quaid.”\n\nPabol Elvira, “a leading baritone for the New York Metropolitan Opera, has a house on 100 acres near Bozeman.” He was from Puerto Rico originally and “founded a local opera company,” in his new Montana town. His wife was from there, and when he went to meet her parents he “fell in love with the place.”\n\n​Montana Celebrities in 1991\n\nThe Helena Independent Record had a great article on December 22, 1991, called “Hollywood Montana.” It lists a large map showing all the names of the celebrities around the state, and on the next page you get photos of them all, at least 40 that are profiled.\n\nList of Montana celebrities, 1991\n\nMany came as a surprise to me, and highlights include:\n\nHoyt Axton “owns a home on seven acres near Victor.”\n\nCarol Burnett, who “owns property outside Whitefish, on The Big Mountain.”\n\nLiz Claiborne “owns a home in the Swan Valley and land near Canyon Creek.”\n\nGlenn Close “owns a farmhouse outside Bozeman, and is co-owner (with a sister) of a Bozeman coffee house.”\n\nEmilio Estevez “owns a home near Whitefish.”\n\nLon Hinkle “is the touring pro for Eagle Bend of Bigfork, where he owns a home.”\n\nSteve Howe “owns property outside Kalispell.”\n\nJim Nabors “owns a home outside Whitefish, on The Big Mountain.”\n\nJack Nicklaus “owns a hunting lodge in the Noxon area and is building another near Essex.”\n\nCharlie Sheen “owns property in the Swan Valley along with basketball player Frank Brickowski, and 420 acres near, reportedly, Nirada, in Lake County.”\n\n​The Celebrity Impact on Montana Land Values in 1993\n\nA September 1993 Baltimore Sun article called “The last Best Place is the Hot Place” by Mike Bowler gets into the problems that Montana celebrities bring. Bowler says that:\n\n“In Livingston, where much of ‘A River Runs Through It’ was filmed (because the real river in Norman Maclean's novella is polluted), land values have increased from $1,500 to $6,500 an acre in 10 years. A woman in the town's largest real-estate office tells me only land speculators are happy. ‘Nothing is moving,’ she says. ‘No one can afford to sell because no one can afford to buy.’\n\nMontana celebrities will drive up land values, effectively pricing natives out of the market. They’ll tell all their friends on both coasts about it, and more will come flocking in. Trendy boutiques rise up on Montana main streets, with prices no Montanan could afford. Then they harp on the environment, something that often leads to job losses for those that were born here. On top of it they never once publicly support local candidates or run for the legislature themselves. That might go against the whole reason they came here, to just get away from it all. Rarely will they look at the problems that their arrival has brought.\n\nStill, is this really the issue? Bowler doesn’t think so, for he sees their arrival as a benefit:\n\n“But it's not those outsiders who are the big problem under the Big Sky. The movie stars (who are fun to watch and seldom seen in winter) and the newcomers do little harm and generally help the economy. Because they've moved here for a better life, they insist on good schools and municipal services. If enough of them come, perhaps Montana will regain the second congressional seat it lost in the last round of reapportionment.”\n\nMore than two decades later and that second House seat has not returned. Neither have the jobs that were lost before many of those celebrities even came. Oftentimes older Montanans want to blame their problems on those that are coming now, for this makes it easier to blame the real causes for their malaise.\n\n“No, Montana's big problem is that it has always been a resource-exporting state with little clout in Washington and other places where natural resources are regulated. First its copper, then its coal, then its timber were taken away by outsiders. And companies like Anaconda (which literally removed part of the city of Butte to get to the copper beneath) did not replace their divots when they left the state. The result is scarred land, thousands of acres of cleared forests. (One of the largest timber companies is selling out now and leaving the state.) And there's heavy pressure to open more federally owned wilderness to loggers and miners.\n\nBecause Montana is so vast, it's easy to discount any damage that might have been done. A population equivalent to Baltimore, Towson and Parkville is squeezed into a state the size of Michigan, Illinois and Indiana combined. The Bozemans of Montana, even the stripped forestland, are like tiny splotches on a wall mural. More than 6 million people visited the state last year, but precious few found their way to out-of-the-way Ekalaka, Madoc, Yaak or Belt.”\n\nNo matter how you feel about Montana celebrities, they’ll keep coming to the popular areas of the state, avoiding those “out-of-the way” spots. They’ll keep telling their friends about Montana, and more will come. I wish they’d get more active in politics and not just wile away their time here. Some do, but the vast majority do not. That’s a shame, but I doubt it’ll change anytime soon.\n\nMontana's timber industry is small, and always has been.\n\nLet's look at some real numbers concerning Montana’s timber industry, not numbers that came out of a hat.\n\nSpeaking of Montana’s timber industry in the early 20th century, or from roughly 1900 to 1940, historian Michael P. Malone had this to say in his book Montana: A History of Two Centuries:\n\n“By national standards, production was irregular and small. The slower-growing Rocky Mountain forests could not match the productive forests on the West Coat and in the South, and Montana output usually totaled only 250 to 400 million board feet per year.” (p 332)\n\nMontana’s output was only 1% of the nation’s total at that time, and the numbers make that clear.\n\nIn 1920 America produced 35 billion board feet. That was a huge increase from the 5 billion board feet that had been produced in 1850, but exactly the same as the 35 billion that was produced in 1900.\n\nThings heated up in the Roaring Twenties and production grew to 39.7 billion board feet in 1926 and then began to fall off. By 1930 it was down to 26.1 billion and in 1934 America was spitting out just 12.8 billion board feet a year.\n\nProfits didn’t follow the same trend. Numbers aren’t available for all years, but in 1926 the value of that production was $117 million, which was down from the $167 million of 1922. That fell to $110 million in 1930 and then rose to $202 million in 1932. The reduced supply was certainly driving up the price as the Depression wore on. A large part of this decline was companies shutting down, but it was also the rise of cement and steel products being used in place of wood.\n\n“Montana’s forest products industry has been neglected by historians,” Malone writes in the bibliography of his history, which was actually written with Richard B. Roeder and William L. Lang. Both Malone and Roeder worked at MSU – Malone was the president when this history was last updated in 1991 – while Lang was at the University of Washington. They touch upon forestry briefly, for just two pages in their 466-page book. Yes, it’s safe to say this area of our state has been neglected, and in more ways than one.\n\nForestry is an industry that’s hard to pin down through the decades. In 1930 there are no detailed numbers for jobs, and in fact forestry’s lumped in with other areas. By 1940 we get some good numbers, but again, there are discrepancies. Two numbers that are the same in both instances where they’re reported are agriculture, forestry and fishing – non-manufacturing, with 146 people, and lumbermen, raftsmen and woodchoppers with 712 people. Altogether that gives us anywhere from 1,187 to 1,826 people working in the forestry and wood products industry in the 1940s in Montana, a difference of 639 people.\n\nStill, forestry is an area that wasn’t a very large part of Montana’s economy. Even in 1930 it’d only been 1.38%, and that when it was combined with fishing. By 1950 there were only 838 sawmill laborers, according to the U.S. Census report for that year. Don't think that was the War, either - in 1940 there were just 914. In 1950 there were 865 lumbermen, raftsmen and wood choppers. In 1940 there were 712.\n\nMontana’s Timber Industry, 1950 to 1980\n\nBy 1950 things had improved, and by that I mean they’re not being reported twice anymore. Still, if you compare numbers in the 1950 Census to numbers in the 1940 Census, they’re still off at times. In 1950 in Montana there were 734 sawmills, planning mills & miscellaneous wood products workers. That was a jump of 98% over the 294 reported in 1940. Additionally, there were 865 lumbermen, raftsmen and woodchoppers and 839 sawmill laborers.\n\nAltogether that gives us 2,438 people in the forestry and wood products industry. Comparing percentages we see that from 1940 to 1950 the industry grew by more than 205%. Still, it didn’t employ anywhere near how many workers we like to think it did while looking back today, nor did it challenge other industries. After all, there were 3,057 waiters and waitresses in 1950. Then again, there were also 4,610 carpenters. This brings up another question, should they be counted too? After all, it’s a good bet much of the wood chopped in Montana was then used by other industries in Montana, such as carpentry. Should that figure into our calculations? For Malone I believe they do.\n\nAfter the war Montana’s timber industry took off by all accounts. There was a building boom going on as Americans got their fair share of the American Dream. Home building across the nation took off and Montana was no different. There was a huge demand in timber, and Malone makes it clear what this meant:\n\n“Montana’s forests of fir, spruce, and lodgepole and ponderosa pine, which had always been of generally marginal commercial value, began to attract more and more loggers. By 1948, there were 434 mills, most of them small, operating in the state. Employment in the wood products industry shot upward, to 5,374 in 1950 to 7,150 in 1955. The boom decreased during the late 1950s, and many of the smaller operators closed down. But by then, big-time investors had begun to develop a truly diversified wood products industry in Montana.” (p 333)\n\nI wish I could figure out where Malone’s getting that 5,374 number for the number employed in this industry. I’m not seeing that anywhere. I guess it’s what you say goes into this industry, and he must be counting the secondary jobs. When I count I get less than 2,500 souls making their living in the timber industry in Montana in 1950.\n\nMissoula got a new timber products operation in 1957, one that could help bolster the mills of Bonner. It was Waldorf Paper Products company and their decision to open a pulp mill on the city’s west side. The mill cost $6 million to put in and paid out $1.5 million a year in wages. In 1959 Hoerner Boxes, a firm located out of Iowa, obtained a quarter interest in the company and in 1960 that went up to 50%. The name was changed to Waldorf-Heorner, and this change also brought the first paper machines to the mill.\n\nThe surrounding timber operations benefited as the company stabilized the ups and downs of their operations with a steady stream of work. It was an economic success, but an environmental step back. With those jobs also came an immense amount of air pollution from the operations.\n\nBy 1969 the mill had undergone its second strike, the first lasting 11 hours the second two weeks. This resulted in pay going from $3.67 an hour to $4 an hour. “Hoerner-Waldorf’s pulp and paper enterprise brought hundreds of new jobs to the Missoula area,” Malone writes, “and helped make that city the Montana boomtown of the 1960s.”\n\nTimber in Montana in the 1960s was centered around western Montana, particularly Missoula and Libby, though Christmas tree farms grew up around the Flathead and pole cutting operations grew up around various areas of the state. The industry expanded and diversified, but it wasn’t enough to help it weather the storms to come.\n\nIn 1977 Champion International came in and bought up the mill while also paying for expansions. The total cost was $170 million. Things went south with these new owners, and in July of 1981 there was a two week strike by the United Paper Workers International and then in September work schedules were curtailed.\n\nMontana’s timber had always been considered sub-par commercially, and the boom cycle of the 1950s finally went bust in 1970. In 1968 just 1.5 million board feet were produced in the state. There were small gains in 1983-4 in Montana and the country, but that typically came with consolidations as the industry became more automated and less manpower-driven. It was the story of the mines all over again.\n\nThe Montana Timber Industry, 1980 to 2011\n\nBy 1985 Champion decided to pull out and sold the plant to Stone Container Corp. of Chicago for $457 million. Despite soaring production levels in the late-1980s, the Montana timber industry actually lost jobs. The high point for the Montana timber industry had been 1978 with 13,400 but by 1988 there were 11,130. By 1990 Wood and paper products made up 15% of western Montana’s economy, up from the 10% it had been in the early 1970s. This is what Malone says:\n\n“Perhaps more than any of Montana’s other extractive industries, it is extremely vulnerable, not only to foreign competition, particularly from British Columbia, but also to problems of supply. Environmentalists and wilderness advocates have heavily criticized clear-cutting and below-cost timber sales on National forest lands. As those groups have gained nationwide support, lumbermen have found that they are less able to secure adequate supplies of wood for their mills.” (p 334)\n\nYou can get modern Montana forestry industry numbers from “Montana Forest Products Industry: Slow to Recover,” a report put out in 2012 by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana. This is what one graph in that document looks like:\n\nIn the early 1980s Montana’s Wood Products Industry was getting below $600 million a year in total sales. That rose in the late 1980s to $900 million and then shot up to over $1.3 billion in the mid-1990s. In the early 2000s that fell off to around $1 billion a year and then rose again around 2004 to about $1.2 billion. After that a steady decline set in, one that saw sales plummet to around $314 million by 2011. Sales were down $670 million from before the recession.\n\nTimber harvests in Montana of course reacted accordingly. In the early 1980s the state was putting out just over 900 million board feet a year. By the mid-1990s that rose to over 1.2 billion board feet but then fell off to about 348 million by 2011. Those are the lowest harvest levels since 1945.\n\nIn 2011 there were 6,530 workers in the Montana forestry industry, which was down 3% from 2010 when there had been 6,743 workers. Those workers in 2011 made $256 million in wages. Still, Timber harvests are down 25% since 1989.\n\nWhat is causing this? The lack of demand is a big one. The closure of the Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. was a hit. And then there’s federal lands, which many think will help. The problem is that they supply just a quarter of the mill lumber. By the 1990s, the federal government owned 12 million of Montana’s 17.3 million acres of forestland, but that’s how people want it.\n\nSo we get back to construction starts, of which there were just 630,000 in 2011. For a time it looked like construction starts in China might help, but they want logs not lumber. So that brings us to our current situation, and it’s not really good…but for whom?\n\nFor Montana timbermen, it’s bad. But for our huge recreation and tourist industry, it’s good. We know tourism employs more, and when we get to the numbers, we’ll prove they earn more.\n\nOr did you think that’s just a load of rubbish?\n\nFine, but before you visited this site, how much did you know of the state’s timber history?\n\nConclusion\n\nSo what will happen? Montana’s wood products and timber industry will continue to remain a marginal part of the economy. It’ll continue to take very little from federal lands and it’ll continue to be an afterthought to the forest behemoths of the West Coast and the South. And the industry will never stop resenting this.\n\nThat’s fine – Montana has a whole collection of dead industries that harken back to our pioneer days, or nation-building days, and the days we now look back on in shame. Timber isn’t Montana’s future, it’s its past.\n\nMontana will become a tourist state. Nay, it already is, but what it must strive to become is a unionized tourist state. Montana isn’t California and it isn’t Florida. It’s not Idaho and it’s not Washington. When you come here you see things you won’t see anywhere else and memories are made that can’t be made anywhere else. That’s a price worth paying, and when you come to Montana, you will.\n\nWe care about our workers here, our 100,000+ strong tourism industry, the face of our tourist industry. Without the folks making beds and serving meals and guiding travelers, there’d be no tourism industry in this state. And never forget that they’re coming to see the trees still standing, not the fields where they once stood.\n\nMontana’s timber industry has a long and proud history in the state, but it’s just that, and will remain forevermore, a history."
