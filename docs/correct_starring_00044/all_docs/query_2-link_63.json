        "text": "Directed by Harrelson (Academy Award nominee for \"The Messenger,\" \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\"), performances will continue through Sept. 9.\n\nThe cast includes Marsha Stephanie Blake, Raul Casso, Brandon Coffey, David Coomber, Shamika Cotton, Shannon Garland, Chris Myers and Nick Wyman.\n\n\"During the summer of 1983, in the sweltering heat of Houston, an unlikely friendship is formed when a couple of mid-western rubes with uncertain futures meet up with a slick New Yorker on the run from his past,\" according to press notes. \"The disappearance of a WWII artifact sets off a chain of events that proves that nothing changes the present like a blast from the past. The characters that populate this hysterical, rapid-fire new comedy by real-life friends Woody Harrelson and Frankie Hyman are based on real people, though the events depicted are fiction and the names have been changed to protect the not-so-innocent.\"\n\n\"Frankie and I worked construction together in Houston in the summer of 1983,\" Harrelson said in a previous statement. \"The people we got to know that summer had a profound effect on us and we knew we had to write a play about them. The only problem was our real lives didnâ€™t have much of a plot, so we started embellishing. Now it's about seven-percent history and ninety-three-percent embroidery.\"\n\nRead the Playbill magazine feature about Harrelson and his new play. Bullet for Adolf received its world premiere last spring at the Hart House Theatre in Toronto.\n\nThe creative team includes Dane Laffrey (sets), Kristy Leigh Hall (costumes), Jen Schriever (lights), Brett Jarvis (sound), and Imaginary Media (projections).\n\nBullet for Adolf is presented by Children at Play."
