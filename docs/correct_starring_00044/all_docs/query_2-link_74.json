        "text": "I must admit, I have had a time figuring out which “angle” to take concerning this review.\n\nDo I attack it from the point of view that “2012” has caused a renewed belief and subsequent panic over human life as we know it ceasing to exist on December 12, 2012. Should I spend paragraphs disputing that view and state the fact it just is not true and that the Mayan calendar never did predict the now much touted end of the world?\n\nThe Mayan calendar, although exact in its calculations for a civilization of its time did not predict the end of the world.\n\nIn fact, the Maya themselves did not equate the date with the end of the world, and in their writings predicted events they said would take place long after it.\n\nShould I instead report what a stunning CGI visual effects movie this is and how rip-roaring fun it is to sit in your seat and feel as though you’re on the most epic thrill ride ever? That the acting is top notch and that all 2 hours and 38 minutes of it were never boring, and even, although at times frightening, fun to watch. Shall I tell you the truth of the matter which is that “2012,” a film by serial-doomsayer/director Roland Emmerich who previously assaulted Earth with aliens in “Independence Day” and global warming in “The Day After Tomorrow,” has admitted that he originally intended “2012” to be a take on every disaster movie of the past 40 years.\n\nSo, “2012” started out as an idea for a parody in the mind of Mr. Emmerich and is although at times dramatic and sincere in its delivery, a product of one man’s very creative imagination, and never intended to be taken literally.\n\n“We’re pattern-seeking primates,” says science historian Michael Shermer, founder of the Skeptics Society.\n\n“We look for patterns to connect A to B. And often A really is connected to B and B really is connected to C. The problem is we don’t have a baloney detection module in our brain to help us tell the true from the false patterns.”\n\nWhat about the real scientific angle? NASA has even found it necessary to post a notice on their site because of the amount of questions posed from concerned people the world over.\n\nNASA expert Dr. James Garvin says,\n\n“We see absolutely no scientific evidence, no sign of any doomsday gloom or anything coming in 2012. We’re well aware of the kind of threats that the movie depicts, but there’s no possibility of those happening at the time.”\n\nSince I am a Christian and have tried my best to catch the Christian aspect concerning the subject matter of this film, I must relate the very real message, and that is there will be an end to our world and to humankind as we know it because God says it is so.\n\nJesus Christ will return to call his people home before the beginning of a period of turmoil on Earth called the Tribulation. Believers will rise into the sky in a phenomenon known as the Rapture.\n\nAt an online Rapture Index, Terry James tracks world events for signs that the end is nigh. He says the site gets 13 million hits per month, a number that he expects will grow with interest about the movie “2012.”\n\nAs a Christian, he doesn’t hold with Mayan prophecy. But he says the current fascination may be serving God’s purpose.\n\n“Even in the secular world, people are sensing that something is up,” he says. “At least there is a sense out there that things are boiling in that direction, and you at least want to know what it’s about.\n\nTherefore, it plays into God’s hands, the way I look at it.”\n\nAs action movies go, “2012” delivers 100 per cent, but as a real account of what is to be, it’s a brilliant piece of fluff. If you want the real goods folks, go to your Bible. Within its pages (the complete book of Revelation as well as much of Daniel) is the true and terrifying factual accounting of where we are headed and the times of the end. The film is focused in on the ‘man saves man’ theme, when in all truth the real deal is ‘God saves man.’\n\nIn the movie “2012” main character Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a writer and divorced father of two, is thrust into the overwhelming responsibility of not only keeping his ex-wife (Amanda Peet), children and friends from harm, but finding his own life’s worth under the weight of devastating uncontrollable natural disasters.\n\nPresident Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) and his daughter Laura (Thandiwe Newton) shoulder the emotional pressure of caring for a nation of people who have little or no hope of survival. While, at the same time, it is the determined responsibility of White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) to make certain only the elite of the human race survive, at any cost.\n\nPresidential scientific adviser Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) struggles to fight for the lives of all human kind to survive, no matter how unworthy they are considered to be by a dogged and unfeeling government.\n\nWe follow all of these characters starting out in unrelated points of the story until they converge in the climactic closing scenes to mesh together and save the survivors of the human race as we know it.\n\nThe message is, for the most part, humankind does not cause the fate of the human race, but that it is a complex set of natural disasters that we cannot and never will be able to control. Global warming or the aspect of a random meteor hurtling towards Earth is never mentioned. Instead, “2012” deals with how we deal with the events, and, as human beings, how we survive them, as its focus.\n\nWhat would you do? Who would you call, what would you say to your loved ones, if, in fact, you were certain the end was near?\n\nNot wanting to post any spoilers, I will keep the basic story description at a minimum and ask you to prayerfully buy your ticket and not take it seriously, as this is a movie perhaps inspired by a frenzy of end times predictions, but never to be considered factual. I leave you to the Word of God for the facts.\n\n“2012” is rated PG-13, and I believe that to be accurate. No child under 13 should go if they are unable to distinguish between reality and movie magic. Although not much blood is shown, there are extremely real and terrifying images of cataclysmic disaster and devastation. No humans are ever shown up close being pulverized or crushed, except for a closing scene where a character’s foot is being crushed in a hydraulic wheel. As this is a disaster movie, there is no doubting millions of human beings are being killed on a massive scale—with natural disasters such as earthquakes, tidal waves and tsunamis as well as fire-breathing volcanic eruptions. The images can be overpowering at times, even for adults, so I cannot stress enough that parents use extreme caution when considering taking young children to see this film.\n\nThere are various profanities in this film—G_damn (6), misuses of “God” (about 14), “Jesus” or “Christ” (3), hell (11), sh_t (6), ass (2), f-word (1). The ‘finger’ is given to one character from another. Although no sex is shown, it is referred that one character has a mistress and that the main character is divorced and his ex-wife is living with another man. In the end, the main character reconciles with his ex-wife and the family is shown in a loving way and is re-united.\n\nThere is a definite struggle between what is right and what is wrong, as far as the way we treat one another as human beings. There is a decision that the writers want you to make within your own mind and heart. The final conclusion we are to come to—do the strong and rich survive or do we embrace all peoples of all walks of life, of all faiths, and save every last man, woman and child no matter what the cost? Are saving material things more important than the rescue of all human life? Do we, in the end, embrace every human life as apposed to rescuing only those whom we consider the intelligent elite of the species?\n\nThe character of the scientist asks the leaders of the world to consider their selfish acts in regards to their new beginning. He states, “Lets not start our future by an act of cruelty,” as the leaders of Earth in their zeal to protect only the intelligent and rich to propagate the species, are blinded to the fact they are leaving behind thousands of innocent people.\n\nI was very pleased by the fact that, although in the beginning a hint was made that Christians who foretold of apocalyptic end times prophecies were not to be taken seriously, it was evident in the end that we were right after all.\n\nI was impressed that ethics and Christian-type values were dealt with in a respectful manner in the end. The gospel of the Lord Jesus was referred to as stated that those who are saved “have nothing to fear.” Another character says “Make your peace with God first, then your soul will have its rest.” A man was shown telling another not to loose his faith. People were reported to be in desperate prayer. There were many scenes of people gathered together in prayer and in churches. The President of the United States was shown giving a final statement to his people and the world, where he recited the 23rd Psalm. He, also, was shown praying in the chapel before he went out to stand with the people of the United States and aid them in their despair. He stated he would “…stay behind and trust Jesus in prayer with the people.”\n\nAs the story deals with all peoples all over the world, it is expected that all faiths are shown, as the peoples of Earth deal with their eminent demise under many different religions. I believe it is done tastefully and no one religion is being pushed upon the audience as the best. On the other hand, being a Christian, I was very disappointed that in the end, after so many encouraging comments about God that He was not depicted as the final strength for humankind, but instead man was shown as the saver of his own soul.\n\nOne of the final scenes showed a depiction of the Sistine Chapel and a crack going down the painting by Michelangelo splitting the fingers of Adam touching that of God’s. To me, at least, it sent the message that God was not there, and I believe just the opposite, that our God is the crafter of the beginning of humankind and, also, will be there at the end of all he has created. Also, the hint was that scientific means will eventually save mankind from extinction, when it is clearly stated in Scripture that God is in control of all events and that man can and will never be in control over his destiny. These two messages clearly send a false hope to any non-believer watching this film and who takes it seriously.\n\n“2012,” also, shows that man will know the time of the end and will deal with it using his military, constructural, governmental and intellectual strength to save himself. Jesus has already told us that no man, not even the Son, knows the time or day of the end. Instead, Jesus instructs us to take note of the signs of the end and to do that which is right to save our immortal souls. Jesus did not tell us to watch the Mayan calendar, He instead reminds us to be always looking up and to Believe in the Son, John 3:16.\n\nHe tells us that as little children are, so must we be, in order to enter the Kingdom. This may sound trivial or too simplistic a concept, but if one thinks about it, children have no pre-conceived ideas about others. They see no race or age, no intelligence or power in another person, no want, as apposed to material wealth. A child sees you for who you are, and Jesus urges us to be the same, for this is where all love has its beginnings. This is where man started, and this is where he’ll end up in Heaven at the end of days.\n\nOkay, looks like I have wound up stating what needs to be said about “2012.” I have found my angle, after all. It is no matter what calendar or new world prophecy dictates, we all are to trust in His Word over the end of days and take comfort in the fact God has our times, beginnings and endings, in His benevolent Hands. Therefore, go into this film with your eyes open, your Christian knowledge intact, and your mind fixed upon the things stated as fact in The unquestionable Word of God.\n\nThere are many Scriptures about the end times signs and how we are to respond to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Word equates Christ to a groom coming for the Bride, which is symbolic of the church. As a bride awaiting the wedding day, so we should wait with great anticipation, watching for any indication that the time is near.\n\nBecause we have been given many signs, Christ fully intended for us to be alert and aware for many different reasons.\n\n“Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness” (2 Peter 3:11).\n\nWe are to be looking forward to the promise of a new heaven and Earth and not enjoying the empty material pleasures of this Earth.\n\n“Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless” (2 Peter 3:14).\n\nKnowing that the end of time draws near should also serve to remind us to live a holy life, knowing that at any moment we will meet or precious Savior, face to face.\n\nViolence: Heavy / Profanity: Heavy / Sex/Nudity: Minor"
