Staring John Cusack Chiwetel Ejiofor Amanda Peet Liam James Morgan Lily Thromas McCarthy Zlatko Buric Beatrice Rosen Oliver Platt Thandie Newton Danny Glover Woody Harrelson\n\n4. 2012 2012 is all about a disaster movie where the world will end in the year 2012 Ancient People back millions of years ago would predict that the world will end in 2012.\n\n5. The government had been given at least years of notice but they all just thought it was a joke/hoax. But when the world was coming to an end they had regret sending troops and getting people evacuated. Jackson had known that the world was going to end. But when Friends/Family asked whats going on he said: “It’s Not Just California, It’s the whole damn world.\n\n6. A hippie has his on radio show and he was going on about the world coming to an end by all the stuff that has just happened to California. Jackson had stopped the plain for fuel but mainly went to look for the hippie that had a map that showed you where the safest place would be. (Where the space ships would be)\n\n7. Volcanoes had started erupting from the ground which there were millions. The hippie had denied the offer to come with Jackson because he said that this is a significant event I want to live every second of this. So he tragically died from getting hit by the biggest lava stone.\n\n8. The Destination was CHINA. They needed a bigger plane. Some russian billionaire had a massive plane but they needed a second pilot Gordon had taken that spot. So everyone go on to the Billionaires plane. But was too selfish to let absolutely no body else (community) on the plane.\n\n9. Pictures"
