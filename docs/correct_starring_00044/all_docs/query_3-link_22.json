        "text": "The 2024 Sundance Film Festival is right around the corner and kicks off later this week. And one of the titles on our Sundance 2024: The 23 Most Anticipated Movies To Watch feature is “Suncoast.” The directorial debut of actor turned writer/director Laura Chinn, “Suncoast,” is semi-biographical and is based on the filmmaker’s personal teenage experience growing up in St. Petersburg, Florida. The film stars Nico Parker, the daughter of director and screenwriter Ol Parker, and actress Thandiwe Newton. She’s really broken out in recent years thanks to turns in “Dumbo,” “The Third Day,” “Reminiscence,” and, most recently, a stellar turn in HBO’s “The Last Of Us” series.\n\nREAD MORE: Sundance Film Festival 2024: The 23 Most Anticipated Movies To Watch\n\n“Suncoast” also co-stars Laura Linney, Ella Anderson, Daniella Taylor, Amarr, Ariel Martin, and Woody Harrelson. The film centers on a teenager (Parker) who, while caring for her brother along with her audacious mother, strikes up an unlikely friendship with an eccentric activist (Harrelson) who is protesting one of the most landmark medical cases of all time.\n\nSundance suggests it’s a mother-and-daughter story in the end. “Separately and together, a mother and daughter face a situation bigger than themselves that builds to a crescendo of deep emotional power and pathos.”\n\nThe film is produced by Jeremy Plager, p.g.a., Francesca Silvestri, p.g.a., Kevin Chinoy, p.g.a., and Oly Obst.\n\nHere’s the official synopsis:\n\nInspired by the semi-autobiographical story of a teenager (Nico Parker) who, while caring for her brother along with her audacious mother (Laura Linney), strikes up an unlikely friendship with an eccentric activist (Woody Harrelson) who is protesting one of the most landmark medical cases of all time."
