        "text": "16. WELCOME TO SARAJEVO (1997)\n\nDirector: Michael Winterbottom. Writer: Frank Cottrell Boyce based on the book by Michael Nicholson. Starring Marisa Tomei, Stephen Dillane, Emily Lloyd.\n\nThis acclaimed but little seen film features Harrelson as Jimmy Flynn a high profile American journalist covering the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country that formed after the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Harrelson is brash and egotistical as the star journalist who proclaims that no one has heard of Yugoslavia, but everyone has heard of him. The character feels his fame justifies his covering the story however he wants.\n\n15. NORTH COUNTRY (2005)\n\nDirector: Niko Caro. Writer: Michael Seitzman based on the book by Clara Bingham and Laura Leedy. Starring Charlize Theron, Frances McDormand, Sissy Spacek.\n\nHarrelson has a quieter and more low-key role than he usually plays as a lawyer helping female factor workers file sexual harassment lawsuits over the way they have been treated in a Minnesota iron mine. Theron and McDormand received Oscar nominations for the film but Harrelson is equally effective in his scenes where he is cross examining the people being sued.\n\n14. THE HUNGER GAMES (2012)\n\nDirector: Gary Ross. Writers: Gary Ross, Suzanne Collins, Billy Ray based on the book by Collins. Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson.\n\nHarrelson plays Haymitch Abernathy a man who won the hunger games twenty-five years prior to the film’s setting but whose life has degenerated into decades of alcoholism due to his unhappiness with having to participate in the games. By virtue of his win he is obligated to coach the lead characters played by Lawrence and Hutcherson. The Christian Science Monitor praised the director Gary Ross for casting Harrelson and called the choice of him for the role as “dead right.”\n\n13. THE COWBOY WAY (1994)\n\nDirector: Greg Champion. Writer: William D. Witliff. Starring Keifer Sutherland, Dylan McDermott, Marg Helgenberger.\n\nWhile the movie itself is only average Harrelson is at his most appealing and comic in this story of two Rodeo stars traveling across country to find a missing friend. The script is just minor stuff but Harrelson is quite funny and likable in the film and has some wonderful physical comedy moments especially one including an oddly placed cowboy hat while he is caught naked.\n\n12. INDECENT PROPOSAL (1993)\n\nDirector: Adrian Lyne. Writers: Amy Holden Jones based on the novel by Jack Engelhard. Starring Robert Redford, Demi Moore, Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nAdrian Lyne knew how to provoke headlines for his films and stir national debate among the media zeitgeist during this period of time. Just as his previous film “Fatal Attraction” made marital infidelity a much-discussed topic in newsrooms and editorial pages, “Indecent Proposal” did the same thing with the same topic. In this film Harrelson plays the husband of Demi Moore. They are a couple with financial difficulties who go to Las Vegas with hopes of gambling their way out of a financial hole. Their gambling hopes fail but while they are there they meet Robert Redford as a billionaire who offers the couple one million dollars to spend one night with Moore. After much debate the couple accepts the offer, but Harrelson ultimately becomes consumed with jealousy and unrest after the paid for infidelity. While Redford and Moore were more discussed in the headlines that greeted the film it is really Harrelson who carries the brunt of the film’s emotional impact as his character learns that money can’t buy happiness.\n\n11. WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017)\n\nDirector: Matt Reeves. Writers: Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves. Starring Andy Serkis, Steve Zahn, Judy Greer.\n\nCritics largely thought that Harrelson’s role as The Colonel was done as a bit of a homage to the Colonel character Marlon Brando played in “Apocalypse Now.” Harrelson plays a highly mentally unstable man who tries to force the apes off their land that they are now peacefully inhabiting. It’s a real over the top performance and Harrelson seems to be having a ball recreating Brando’s infamous work.\n\n10. THE THIN RED LINE (1998)\n\nDirector: Terrence Malick. Writer: Terrence Malick based on the book by James Jones. Starring Nick Nolte, Nicolas Cage, John Travolta.\n\nHarrelson has a key supporting role in this film by the reclusive but highly respected director Terrence Malick. After wowing audiences and critics with his early films in particular the beautiful “Days of Heaven” (released in 1978,) the director took a twenty-year break from film making. His return to the lens brought out tons of A-List actors who wanted to work with him. While newcomers filled out the main roles Malick assembled a who’s who list of actors for the supporting parts including Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, George Clooney and John Cusack. Harrelson plays a platoon leader and holds his own amongst the all-star cast.\n\n10. SUNCOAST (2024)\n\nWriter/Director: Laura Chinn. Starring Nico Parker, Laura Linney, Woody Harrelson, Daniella Taylor, Ella Anderson.\n\nAn activist in real life, Harrelson plays a different kind of protester in writer/director Laura Chinn’s Sundance favorite, “Suncoast.” Set in 2005 Florida at a hospice where Terry Schiavo, a woman in a vegetative state who may have her life support removed, “Suncoast” centers on a teen (Nico Parker) whose dying brother is at the same hospice and who strikes up a friendship with Paul (Harrelson), a grieving widower who is protesting the woman’s right to die. The conversations between the two serve as the film’s emotional centerpiece, and Harrelson’s nuanced approach to his character turns what could have been a convenient stereotype into a complicated human being.\n\n9. ZOMBIELAND (2009)\n\nDirector: Ruben Fleischer. Writers: Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Starring Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Bill Murray.\n\nHarrelson had one of his biggest box office hits in this post-apocalyptic comedic horror film where zombies have taken over the planet. While zombies have literally been done to death (so to speak) in recent film and television, “Zombieland” stands on its own as a unique take on the genre. The Chicago Tribune described Harrelson as “having a high old time as humankind’s last best hope.”\n\n8. TRIANGLE OF SADNESS (2022)\n\nDirected and written by Ruben Östlund. Starring Harris Dickinson, Charlbi Dean, Dolly de Leon, Zlatko Burić, Woody Harrelson.\n\nHarrelson took a decidedly off-beat role in writer/director Ruben Östlund’s Palme d’Or-winning satire “Triangle of Sadness” as Capt. Thomas Smith, the beleaguered skipper of a luxury yacht catering to the rich and beautiful. Ironically Capt. Smith, who serves the elite, is an avowed Marxist and regularly deals with his privileged passengers’ in a boozy haze. It is only when he has a one-on-dialogue with a Russian capitalist that the captain finds a kindred spirit, even as the yacht may be sinking. Though his role is relatively small, he runs away with every one of his scenes.\n\n6. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007)\n\nDirected by Ethan and Joel Coen. Written by Ethan and Joel Coen based on the book by Cormac McCarthy. Starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin.\n\nHarrelson had a supporting role in this 2007 film that won four Oscars (Best Picture, Best Directors, Best Adapted Screenplay and Supporting Actor for Javier Bardem.) In a large ensemble cast full of stand outs Harrelson still makes a strong impact in what was one of his most acclaimed and rewarded films at the time.\n\n5. NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994)\n\nDirected by Oliver Stone. Written by David Rutowski, David Veloz, and Oliver Stone based on the novel by Quentin Tarantino. Starring Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore, Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nEasily the most controversial film in Harrelson’s filmography is this 1994 Oliver Stone film. Released shortly after O.J. Simpson’s murder of his ex-wife Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman, the film harshly lampooned the public and media’s fascination with criminals and true crime stories. Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play a latter day “Bonnie and Clyde” who go on a murderous killing spree for which they crave public recognition and notoriety. While the film outraged many it eerily predicted the murders at Columbine High School a few years later. Those killers, like the ones in the film knew their murders would be media fodder and the Columbine assassins detailed their actions on video tape knowing that a hungry media would lap up the news, which they did.\n\n4. THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI (2017)\n\nDirected and written by Martin McDonagh. Starring Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, Lucas Hedges.\n\nHarrelson teamed again with director Martin McDonagh for this story of a mother’s obsessive campaign to bring her daughter’s murderer to justice. For his role as the Sheriff whom McDormand hounds to find the killer, Harrelson earned his third Oscar nomination this time as Best Supporting Actor. While co-star Sam Rockwell has received the lion’s share of Supporting Actor awards for the film, Harrelson’s quiet stable presence in the film is unforgettable.\n\n3. WHITE MEN CAN’T JUMP (1992)\n\nDirected and written by Ron Shelton. Starring Wesley Snipes, Rosie Perez, Alex Trebek.\n\nUnlike the title, Harrelson here played a white man who could jump. He plays a hustling basketball player who joins street games to pick up money to pay off his gambling debts. This was one of Harrelson’s early hit films as he was about to transition from his role on TV in “Cheers” to full fledged movie stardom in the coming years. Harrelson has wonderful chemistry with co-stars Wesley Snipes and Rosie Perez. (And Perez’s appearance on “Jeopardy” is just a wonderful comic moment.)\n\n2. THE MESSENGER (2009)\n\nDirected by Orin Moverman. Written by Orin Moverman and Allesandro Camon. Starring Ben Foster, Samantha Morton, Steve Buscemi.\n\nHarrelson received his second Oscar nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for this film about an alcoholic army officer whose job it is to notify families of people killed in action. The Orlando Sentinel raved about Harrelson’s work in this film saying “Harrelson gives us layers of hurt under a callous yet needy crust. It may be the best performance of his career and certainly deserves Oscar consideration.”\n\n1. THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT (1996)\n\nDirected by Milos Forman. Written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Starring Courtney Love, Edward Norton, James Cromwell.\n\nIn another controversial film Harrelson gives a tour de force performance as pornography publisher Larry Flynt who goes through various difficult periods in his life from the death of his true love (rock star Courtney Love in a surprisingly nuanced performance,) an assassination attempt that leaves him paralyzed and ultimately a free speech battle before the United States Supreme Court against right wing evangelist Jerry Falwell (which Flynt actually won.)\n\nThe film earned Harrelson his first Oscar nomination (as Best Actor) for this film but the controversy surrounding the film took its toll on Harrelson. In the years following the film’s release Harrelson drastically cut down his film output. He would later admit that he was extremely hurt by the backlash the film received from extreme feminist critics who saw the film as glorifying a man who exploits women in his magazine “Hustler.” The backlash stung him so that he retreated a bit from public life since he saw the film as an important statement about the importance of free speech. Luckily for movie lovers Harrelson eventually emerged from his self-imposed exile and a long and fruitful career continued."
