        "text": "Woody Harrelson (born July 23, 1961, Midland, Texas, U.S.) is an American actor who gained fame for his role as a dim-witted bartender on the classic sitcom Cheers and later earned respect as an accomplished and magnetic film actor.\n\nFollowing the collapse of his parents’ marriage when he was a child, Harrelson and his mother and siblings moved to Lebanon, Ohio; his father was later convicted of murder. Harrelson began acting in school plays while attending high school. After studying theatre and English at Hanover College, Indiana (B.F.A., 1983), he moved to New York City. In 1985 he became an understudy for a production of Neil Simon’s Biloxi Blues, but that same year he was cast in the role of Woody Boyd on Cheers. The good-hearted but dim-witted bartender was a popular character, and in 1989 Harrelson received an Emmy Award; he remained on the show until the end of its run in 1993. During this time he occasionally appeared in movies, including the sports comedies Wildcats (1986) and White Men Can’t Jump (1992).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nAlthough he worried about being typecast, Harrelson proved his versatility with his menacing performance in Oliver Stone’s Natural Born Killers (1994). After appearing in a few more comedies, Harrelson starred as the title pornographer in Miloš Forman’s The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), a surprise critical hit that earned Harrelson an Academy Award nomination for best actor. He had a major role in Barry Levinson’s dark political satire Wag the Dog (1997) and was part of the ensemble cast of The Thin Red Line (1998), Terrence Malick’s meditation on war. He also starred with Matthew McConaughey in Ron Howard’s EDtv (1999). In addition, in 2001 he had a recurring role on the sitcom Will & Grace.\n\nExtremely prolific, Harrelson subsequently worked in a series of minor comedies and action movies interspersed with such films as Spike Lee’s She Hate Me (2004), the feminist drama North Country (2005), Robert Altman’s A Prairie Home Companion (2006), and Joel and Ethan Coen’s No Country for Old Men (2007). He later gave an Oscar-nominated performance as an army officer tasked with delivering the news of the deaths of soldiers to their families in The Messenger (2009). He costarred in the popular horror comedy Zombieland (2009) and its 2019 sequel, and he won praise for his role as the damaged survivor Haymitch Abernathy in the Hunger Games series (2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015), which was adapted from Suzanne Collins’s popular young-adult books. He was compelling in the title role of Rob Reiner’s LBJ (2016).\n\nFor his portrayal of the sheriff in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), Harrelson received another Oscar nomination, and he later played a smuggler in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018). In the 2019 action-drama Midway, he was cast as Chester W. Nimitz. Harrelson later portrayed a serial killer in Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), which was based on a Marvel comic book series. Also in 2021 he appeared in the action thriller Kate."
