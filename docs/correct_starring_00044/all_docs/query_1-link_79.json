        "text": "With the release of The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, a new entry into the canon of dystopian movies adapted from YA-targeted novels has arrived. Though these sorts of movies aren’t currently clogging theaters, they were a full-blown film fad about a decade ago: The year 2012 brought the first of four successful Hunger Games films led by Jennifer Lawrence, which ushered in three less profitable Divergent movies starring Shailene Woodley. A trail of imitators keen to capitalize on the zeitgeist followed, including The Maze Runner series—starring Dylan O’Brien—and a whole bunch of would-be franchise makers that failed to connect with audiences, led by the likes of Lily Collins, Saoirse Ronan, and Hailee Steinfeld.\n\nAlthough none of these projects resonated with young audiences like The Hunger Games did, many of them introduced rising stars, reinvigorated the YA novel space, and offered Academy Award winners like Kate Winslet and Jeff Bridges the opportunity to play scenery-chewing supporting roles. Ahead, a ranking of postapocalyptic adolescence from worst to best, including the latest prequel.\n\n18. Ender’s Game\n\nRelease Year: 2013\n\nDirector: Gavin Hood\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Hailee Steinfeld, Asa Butterfield, Harrison Ford, Viola Davis, Ben Kingsley\n\nDirector Gavin Hood’s disastrously dull adaptation of Orson Scott Card’s beloved science fiction novel fails on just about every level. Like most of these films, Ender’s Game managed to wrangle some top-tier talent—in this instance, Harrison Ford, Viola Davis, and Ben Kingsley—but then, like too many of these films, subsequently puts them to waste. The kids, chosen ones meant to lead a war against attacking aliens (it has to be kids fighting the battles, for some reason), are all bland. And so is the action, which plays at first as meaningless school exercises and then as a confused video game. Controversial as his personal politics may be, Scott Card’s most enduring novel still deserved a better adaptation than this. Audiences largely stayed away, for good reason, and the film only barely outgrossed its $110 million budget. —Richard Lawson\n\n17. Maze Runner: The Death Cure\n\nRelease Year: 2018\n\nDirector: Wes Ball\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Dylan O’Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Will Poulter, Thomas Brodie-Sangster\n\nDylan O’Brien was injured while filming the third and final Maze Runner film, forcing production to temporarily shut down. One can’t help but feel like everyone else is limping a bit towards the franchise’s finish line too. By the trilogy’s end, O’Brien’s character Thomas and his fellow comrades are on the home stretch to finding a cure to the lethal disease (known as The Flare) ravaging the globe. The film’s events feel convoluted and dreary, a carbon copy of better final chapters that delivers answers to questions most had long forgotten about asking. —Savannah Walsh\n\n16. The Host\n\nRelease Year: 2013\n\nDirector: Andrew Niccol\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Saoirse Ronan, Jake Abel, Max Irons, Diane Kruger, William Hurt\n\nThere’s a maze. There’s running. There’s a whole glossary of dopey terms—slicer, griever, greenie—choking up this boring, programmatic tale of kids stuck in a clearing surrounded by a big, scary maze. What minor charms Wes Ball’s movie does have are owed to its spirited cast of kids—chief among them, Teen Wolf breakout star Dylan O’Brien, who manages to ground this silly film in some sense of reality. Everything else about The Maze Runner is arbitrary and pre-packaged, an assembly-line teen dystopia that never finds its footing. —R.L.\n\n14. The Divergent Series: Allegiant\n\nRelease Year: 2016\n\nDirector: Robert Schwentke\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Jeff Daniels, Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer\n\nThe third installment of this series—loosely adapted from Veronica Roth’s best-selling books about a future Chicago divided into factions based on personality—is a limp, aimless story that struggles to establish any meaningful stakes. Star Shailene Woodley is on monotone autopilot here, and not even stellar actors like Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, and Jeff Daniels, playing the new big-bad, can add much liveliness to the proceedings. A junky setup for the final film (the second half of the last book in the series—sort of), Allegiant features a howlingly awkward ending and offers few thrills on its way there. Most frustrating, though: Why do people keep trusting Miles Teller’s character, who double-crosses Tris and the gang in every movie? Stop hanging around with that guy! —R.L.\n\n13. Mortal Instruments: The City of Bones\n\nRelease Year: 2013\n\nDirector: Harald Zwart\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Lily Collins, Jamie Campbell Bower, Kevin Zegers, Lena Headey\n\nFor The 5th Wave, an adaptation of the first of three books about an alien invasion on Earth, it was Chloë Grace Moretz’s turn to play the fresh-faced but resilient heroine, who we at least get to meet as a “normal” American teen before dystopia sets in. All the usual pieces are in place—two hunky love interests (Nick Robinson and Alex Roe), a family member to protect (moppet Zackary Arthur), a villain played by an inexplicably famous actor (Liev Schreiber), and vague hints at a larger mythology. After a modest $100 million global gross, that mythology seemed unlikely to play out onscreen. —Katey Rich\n\n11. The Darkest Minds\n\nRelease Year: 2018\n\nDirector: Jennifer Yuh Nelson\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Amandla Stenberg, Harris Dickinson, Skylan Brooks, Miya Cech, Mandy Moore, Gwendoline Christie\n\nThis reimagining of Alexandra Bracken’s novel from director Jennifer Yuh Nelson, best known for the Kung Fu Panda films, was a box office flop, earning just $41 million globally on a $34 million budget. But it’s worth a revisit for its memorable futuristic visuals and some of the strongest performances in the genre. After delivering on the most heartbreaking moments of the 2012 Hunger Games as Rue, Amandla Stenberg gets top billing as 16-year-old Ruby—who flees an authoritarian camp for youth who have developed powers as a flesh-eating disease ravages the world’s children. Assists by Harris Dickinson years before his breakout performance in Triangle of Sadness and Skylan Brooks after Netflix’s The Get Down elevate this ensemble. —S.W.\n\n10. Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\n\nRelease Year: 2015\n\nDirector: Wes Ball\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Dylan O’Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Giancarlo Esposito\n\nAs frustratingly, dumbly incongruous as the first Divergent film’s most basic tenets may be—why are three of the faction names nouns (Candor, Amity, Abnegation) while the two others are adjectives (Erudite, Dauntless)?—there is enough in Neil Burger’s trundling movie to rescue it from complete oblivion. Sure, everything looks cheap and flimsy, and the film’s training narrative, as heroine Tris goes from unassuming Abnegation to Dauntless, is hard to care about. But when the right pop tune is blaring and Shailene Woodley is soaring through the air, or ogling Theo James, Divergent works well enough. Helping matters is an underused Kate Winslet as the calculating leader of Erudite, and Miles Teller, who hasn’t yet worn out his welcome. —R.L.\n\n8. The Giver\n\nRelease Year: 2014\n\nDirector: Phillip Noyce\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Brenton Thwaites, Odeya Rush, Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Taylor Swift\n\nAttempting to work in the most literary source material of the bunch results in a movie that feels loaded with unrealized potential. Starring handsome, hollow Brenton Thwaites, The Giver takes author Lois Lowry’s classic YA story about an ordered, colorless, emotionally muted future society and the brave boy who fights to restore some spirit to the place, and tries to muscle it up into another teen action extravaganza. That strategy doesn’t really work, but director Phillip Noyce still captures at least some of the resonance of Lowry’s story. And it’s a hoot to see Meryl Streep purring out villainous orders in a severe gray wig. The Giver isn’t a total disaster, but it’s inert and uninspiring. This book would have been better served as a prestige cable miniseries. Maybe it’s not too late? Eh, it probably is. —R.L.\n\n7. Ready Player One\n\nRelease Year: 2018\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Mark Rylance, Ben Mendelsohn\n\nA lot was riding on Gary Ross’s film, which had to set the tone for a blockbuster series that was to take the reins from Lionsgate/Summit Entertainment’s other big franchise, Twilight, which was nearing its end, Twilight. And, just as the first two Harry Potter movies’ biggest accomplishment was that they didn’t ruin anything, Ross sets the stage well enough for what’s to come. He cast Jennifer Lawrence, which was smart, and he gives the film the right serious and mournful tone. Some things don’t work—Katniss Everdeen’s Appalachian home in District 12 looks more like a century-old Oakie settlement than a future civilization gone to ruin—and the film detrimentally shies away from the extreme violence that is the shocking central point of Suzanne Collins’s book. But The Hunger Games works fine as an introduction, dutifully adapting the text while adding new dimensions only possible on film. —R.L.\n\n5. The Divergent Series: Insurgent\n\nRelease Year: 2015\n\nDirector: Robert Schwentke\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Theo James, Miles Teller, Kate Winslet, Octavia Spencer\n\nEschewing much of the first film’s amateurishness, Robert Schwentke’s sequel is big, and propulsive, and messy—and often captivating. The gears of future Chicago still turn with a stilted clank, but in digressing from Roth’s book—adding in more action, including bracing, well-staged hallucination sequences—Insurgent mines veins of tension and drama that the first film failed to find. (Too bad most of the air goes right back out of the series in the next film.) Joseph Trapanese’s pulsing, rousing score is a key player here, giving this robust, inventive action movie a feeling of shivery, futuristic grandeur. Oh, and there’s more Kate Winslet, plus Naomi Watts as her rival. How could that be a bad thing? —R.L.\n\n4. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1\n\nRelease Year: 2014\n\nDirector: Francis Lawrence\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman\n\nMaking a prequel to any series is complicated—just ask X-Men Origins: Wolverine or Solo: A Star Wars Story. Add the fact that Suzanne Collins’s novel makes the villainous Cornelius Snow (played by Donald Sutherland in the original trilogy) the story’s tentative hero, and doesn’t include any other established Hunger Games characters—other than Tigris (Hunter Schafer in the new film), and the odds didn’t appear to be in this movie’s favor. But marrying franchise stalwarts like director Francis Lawrence and executive producer Nina Jacobson with fresh-faced Tom Blyth as young Snow and West Side Story’s Rachel Zegler as the titular songbird Lucy Gray Baird proves to be a winning combination. The film boasts the same rich, elaborate aesthetic found in Catching Fire’s Capitol set pieces and Mockingjay’s war room scenes. Supporting turns from Viola Davis and Jason Schwartzman feel dynamic—two acclaimed performers having the time of their lives playing to the rafters. But most importantly, the film feels narratively vital, maintaining its momentum across three action-packed acts. And the original music will impress even the most skeptical of YA watchers. There are better films in this franchise, but the newest entry holds its own. —S.W.\n\n2. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\n\nRelease Year: 2013\n\nDirector: Francis Lawrence\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone\n\nFrancis Lawrence took over for Gary Ross and the Hunger Games movies found their grim groove, sending Katniss and Peeta (an ever-deepening Josh Hutcherson) into a new melee with some veteran victors from games past. Thus, we’re introduced to a slew of series MVPs, like Sam Claflin’s hunky, heroic Finnick Odair and Jena Malone’s fabulously spiky Johanna Mason. The Quarter Quell is confusingly described in Collins’s novel (vague descriptive language is a frequent problem in her books), but Lawrence craftily figures out the right geography and mechanics, building a murder dome that’s both surreal and immediate. With its fine acting, judicious pacing, and harrowing climax, Catching Fire gracefully expands the scope of the Hunger Games saga into something vast, urgent, and enveloping. —R.L.\n\n1. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2\n\nRelease Year: 2015\n\nDirector: Francis Lawrence\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman\n\nThough Catching Fire may have a more complete arc, Mockingjay Part 2 is so well made, so solemn and mature and self-possessed, that it ekes past Catching Fire to stand out as the best film in a solid series of movies—and the best of all the 2010s YA dystopias. All the younger actors have aged well into their roles by now, while the older folks, like Julianne Moore, glide through every scene with imperious ease. (You may have noticed that there are a lot of stern and stiffly haired demagogues played by great actresses on this list. In a crowded field, Moore reigns supreme.) Most important, though, is that this film burrows to the heart of Collins’s messages about war and media, communicating something basic but vital about the way that contemporary Western society receives, processes, and creates violence. As the final chapter of the tale that essentially kicked off this recent craze, Mockingjay Part 2 reminds us how the genre can be powerful—it’s an effective way to illustrate alarming political and social realities for younger audiences, while also grappling with them ourselves. —R.L."
