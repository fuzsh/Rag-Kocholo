        "text": "\"It's always nice to get a ticket to the party,\" said actor Woody Harrelson in a phone interview on Tuesday morning, just hours after he received an Oscar nomination — his third — as best supporting actor for his role in \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\"\n\nBut it's another film that will bring Harrelson to Rhode Island on Sunday, a screening of his own 2017 project \"Lost in London\" at the University of Rhode Island's Edwards Auditorium, followed by a discussion.\n\n\"Lost in London\" is Harrelson's directorial debut, and a daring one it was. It's a comedy shot in one continuous take, using a single camera, and then aired in theaters as it was being filmed on Jan. 19, 2017. It stars Harrelson, Owen Wilson and Willie Nelson as themselves.\n\nThe movie is based on the true story of a night in 2002 when Harrelson got into a fight with a cab driver, broke an ashtray, was chased by the police, and spent the night in jail.\n\n\"The story really did happen. It was a very brutal night I wanted to forget. But if I were to look at it upside down, from a different perspective, it's kind of funny. ... I definitely augmented things and tried to make it funny. There were no laughs on that night, I can tell you that. Not even half a chuckle,\" Harrelson said. \"I think of it as a love letter to my wife. She really likes it, and that makes me happy. And my daughter is in it.\"\n\nHe said he's considering releasing the movie on iTunes not far after its first anniversary, so he's going to five colleges in five days to gauge people's reaction. While seeing the movie this time around might not have the live, communal feel of watching it as it was being shot, Harrelson said \"Lost in London\" was always intended to stand alone as a film, not just a stunt.\n\nHarrelson has had an intriguing career since his breakthrough role as the lovable, dimwitted bartender Woody on the hugely popular TV sitcom \"Cheers,\" starting in 1985.\n\nSince then, the 56-year-old Harrelson has played memorable film roles, among them a basketball hustler in \"White Man Can't Jump,\" pornographic magazine publisher Larry Flynt in \"The People vs. Larry Flynt,\" a serial killer in \"Natural Born Killers,\" Captain Tony Stone in \"The Messenger\" and Haymitch Abernathy in \"The Hunger Games\" series. In 2014, he co-starred in the acclaimed first season of HBO's \"True Detective.\"\n\nHis previous Oscar nominations were for \"Larry Flynt\" and \"The Messenger.\" His latest nomination, for \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" is for for the role of Bill Willoughby, police chief in Ebbing and target of the angry messages plastered on billboards outside town by Mildred Hayes, (played by Frances McDormand), infuriated because no arrests have been made in the rape/murder of her daughter.\n\nHarrelson said he's an admirer of \"Three Billboards\" writer and director Martin McDonagh, and appeared in McDonagh's 2012 film \"Seven Psychopaths.\" Harrelson said he once turned down an offer to perform in McDonagh's play \"The Pillowman,\" and after he saw it, he vowed never to reject another offer to work with McDonagh.\n\nHe said it's nice to be nominated for the Oscar this year, but he's rooting for his fellow \"Three Billboards\" cast member, Sam Rockwell, who is nominated in the same category. (So is Rhode Island actor Richard Jenkins.) Rockwell plays a drunken, racist police officer who attempts to redeem his wasted life.\n\n\"It sounds disingenuous, but I really hope Sam wins,\" Harrelson said. \"I'll vote for Sam. He's a guy who's delivered so many amazing performances in his career, and this might be his best ever. At the beginning of the movie, you really loathe him, but by the end he's turned that around.\"\n\nWoody Harrelson will appear Sunday, Jan. 28, at URI's Edwards Auditorium, 64 Upper College Road, Kingston, at 6 pm. Tickets are $15-$20 for URI students, $25-$35 for the general public. All seats are reserved. Tickets are available at the Ryan Center Box Office or online at theryancenter.com"
