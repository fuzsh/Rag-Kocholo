        "text": "Choppy Hitchcockian suspense type film with a weird plot that is deeper and more involved than you’d expect but way too ridiculous and poorly written to take seriously.\n\nThe thing is all over the place, often relying on coincidence and over the top scenarios to forward the crazy multi-layered plot it so desperately tries to convince you is otherwise firmly grounded in reality. It’s as though the film wants the respectability of a serious suspense thriller and thinks stuffing itself full of wacky action set pieces and dumb, over the top scenarios are the perfect way to go about it. Granted most of the dumb ridiculous stuff doesn’t take place until the last half, and the first half is somewhat interesting at times, though, again, not that well written, but a decent beginning is no excuse to get even lazier with your plot.\n\nThe acting is also kind of all over the place. Emily Mortimer is fine, as is Kate Mara who is real pretty here, and gives arguably the best performance, “best” being used loosely in this case. Woody Harrelson, though, is miscast. He’s not bad, he’s just not very convincing as this supposed **SPOILERS** wimpy reserved type whose skittish nature helped reform Mortimer’s character’s “bad girl” persona into something dull and watered down. Mortimer herself never struck me as someone who used to have a “bad” side to her either, and, though she manages to pull it off for the most part, I never quite bought it completely. **END SPOILERS**\n\nOverall, not a terrible film. Entertaining at times, but too ridiculous at others, especially in some of the choices Mortimer makes near the middle and end, and the crazy coincidences/scenarios that play out with **SPOILERS** Ben Kingsley’s character. **END SPOILERS** Some of it “just plain don’t make sense,” as they say, while most of it is just stupid. The script tries to do too much in too lazy a manner, and the end result is a big, occasionally interesting but mostly idiotic mess.\n\nA smart, sprawling adaptation that actually improves on the book somewhat thanks to some clever narrative choices, a unique visual style, and a strong performance by the lead, Jennifer Lawrence, whom I still love very much despite now being ultra super-duper famous because of this film. Hey, I loved her before it was cool. The rest of you are just posers. Yep.\n\nThe film’s visual style is the most striking thing about this film. Though it’s effective, the constant shakiness takes a while to get used to, and may even induce nausea if you’re not careful. It adds a weird documentary feel to the whole thing, which is helpful in establishing the gritty, violent nature of the world at the beginning but feels slightly off as the film progresses and things become “cleaner” and more organized.\n\nI did enjoy, though, in one of the film’s many successful tweaks of the book, how Lawrence’s character’s district and its people are portrayed in the opening lottery sequence. Whereas the book **SPOILERS** makes the district feel like a small, friendly town, and the lottery a festival of sorts, the film makes no qualms about portraying the district for what it is, a concentration camp of sorts, and the lottery for what it means to its inhabitants if they step out of line, violent oppression. **END SPOILERS**\n\nThe mood is somber and the lighting cold and lifeless as citizens are constantly pushed and prodded like lambs going to slaughter, and the expression on their faces as Elizabeth Banks’ character puts on this happy, cheery show for them speaks volumes about their thoughts on the games, their district, and their government in general. Great filmmaking choices here all around. Really intelligent stuff, especially considering that very little of it is in the book, I think. Or at least not as heavily emphasized as it is here. Really smart.\n\nAnd this kind of thing is present throughout the film, which, again, was a really great filmmaking choice. I loved the contrast between the notion that those chosen to compete in the games are both prisoners and celebrities; they’re treated like royalty only as long as they do exactly what they’re told. The scene where **SPOILERS** they’re all interviewed live on television by Stanley Tucci’s character is a perfect illustration of this, **END SPOILERS** especially in the way Lawrence’s character, all primped and pretty in her expensive, specially tailored dress, is escorted to the stage by her guards, like a prisoner going to execution.\n\nIt’s a brilliant visual metaphor for the world they live in, a place where compliance is found at the end of a loaded gun. I have a feeling the filmmakers were also making a comment about celebrity in general, though what it is exactly I’m not going to get into. But it’s great nonetheless. It’s the kind of symbolism the likes of which you just don’t see in films very often. And, again, not something that the book bothers to spend all that much time on. But here, it’s front and center.\n\nI also especially enjoyed just how much the film downplays the book’s whole stupid romance element in favor of more interesting stuff, like politics and media and violence and gruesome death. And explosions! It’s especially odd considering what a large role romance plays in the book, **SPOILERS** what with helping them survive and such, **END SPOILERS** whereas here, it happens quickly, almost as an afterthought. It’s over before it even begins. And for a book written by and prominently featuring a woman, it’s a surprisingly manly film, full of blood and guts and other big “manly” things like sharp swords and knives and arrows and **SPOILERS** people being eaten by horrible wolf like monsters or stung to death by genetically enhanced wasps. Yikes. **END SPOILERS** Twilight this ain’t. Not that I’d know, of course.\n\nA few other quick things: the acting is pretty good all around. Lawrence is good, not great as the lead. Some of her dialogue is clunky, as is that of just about everyone else here, but she’s the type of actress who can speak volumes with just a look so it’s not too bad. And the guy who plays Peeta, her partner in the games, is great. Not sure who he is or where he came from, but the guy can act. Liam Hemsworth, though, who plays Gale, is just terrible. He’s stiff and dull and was probably only given the role because he’s “handsome” and his brother is Thor and Hollywood is stupid. Luckily he’s barely in the movie, but given his expanding role in the novels, things aren’t looking good.\n\nOh, and Woody Harrelson was totally miscast here as Haymitch; he’s good, don’t get me wrong, but Haymitch is supposed to be this fat pathetic loser character who’s all but given up on life. Harrelson looks too fit, too put together here. And what the hell was with the long blond hair? No, no. I think someone like Paul Giamatti or Philip Seymour Hoffman would have been better for the role.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the film. It’s not perfect: it feels really long, the editing is occasionally clunky, the acting is mediocre at times, and it has some pacing issues, especially in the last half when the film suddenly starts a mad dash to get to the end, viewer comprehension be damned. It’s obvious they were trying to cram way too much of the rest of the story into the last hour and couldn’t quite pull it off as smoothly as they had up until that point.\n\nI’d say the film, though already pretty damn long, could arguably have been even better had it been longer; maybe four hours instead of two and a half, with the first two hours devoted to introducing us to Katniss and the the crazy futuristic dictatorship she lives in, and the last two to her training and participation in the Hunger Games. But that would never happen, so we’re left with this, which is still pretty good, but glosses over a lot of really interesting story and side characters.\n\nSo, yeah, I liked it. It’s better than the book in some ways, though having read the book beforehand makes the experience even better. Strongly recommended.\n\nMuddled and poorly written/directed, but with a fine leading performance from Woody Harrelson that elevates it all somewhat, and an interesting concept that at the very least keeps you on your toes. Still, it’s not a very good movie by any means, average at best, and that’s being generous. The story is stupid at times and the characters inconsistent, and the film is shot less like someone who knows what he’s doing and more like someone who’s eager to throw every camera trick he knows into the mix in hopes that something will look cool. It doesn’t. It’s just annoying.\n\nThe performances are the strongest aspect of the film. Even though Harrelson’s character is inconsistent, it’s a credit to his acting skill that he’s able to pull it off as well as he does. Same for most of the cast really, especially Robin Wright who’s quite great in this despite her character’s weird behavior. Brie Larson, whom I love very much, is also in this and is cute as always, but, like a lot of the other characters in this film, isn’t written very believably.\n\nBut the story is just terrible. Good concept; reminded me a lot of the show “The Shield,” but without any of the great character development and intriguing plot lines that show is known for. Harrelson’s character just isn’t written very convincingly; he’s supposed to be this **SPOILERS** big violent racist unpleasant guy, but he doesn’t come off that way really. He’s not a nice guy, but he never really says or does anything that would make you think he’s the horrible person the film portrays him as being, at least not initially. And some of his actions just don’t make sense. Why does he, after being caught beating the crap out of a guy, decide the next course of action to take is to kill a man in cold blood and try to pass it off as self-defense? That whole scene made absolutely zero sense, which is especially grievous given that it becomes our protagonist’s central problem and the eventual cause of his downfall. **END SPOILERS** Bad, bad writing.\n\nRobin Wright’s character’s behavior is just as equally perplexing. What the hell was going on with her? Well acted, but huh? It all just smacks of poor writing. And the cinematography is terrible at times. There’s an entire scene that literally almost made me vomit, not because of any content reasons but because the director decided to spin the camera around in circles nonstop for 3 minutes. The trick might have been cool for 30 seconds, maybe, or to show the symbolically cyclical nature of what was going on in the scene, but no, it’s long and pointless and just made me dizzy. A first. And this was just one of several poorly shot scenes that were all style and no substance, though very little style at that.\n\nOverall, not a great movie by any means. Terribly written and directed, tedious, not particularly interesting, with only a small handful of good moments here and there. The acting is good, at least, and may be enjoyed for that. But really, it’s a mostly unpleasant watch, and not something I’d recommend."
