        "text": "Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are reuniting on a new television series for the first time since they starred in True Detective‘s first season in 2014.\n\nOn Tuesday (March 14), Apple TV+ announced a new untitled comedy series starring the dynamic duo, who will be playing themselves. Schitt’s Creek Emmy-winning writer, David West Read, created the upcoming series. He will also be executive producing alongside Harrelson and McConaughey.\n\nIt is described as “a heartfelt odd couple love story revolving around the strange and beautiful bond between Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.” Their friendship will be tested when their families attempt to live together on Matthew’s ranch in Texas. The title and release date of the series have yet to be released.\n\nRELATED: Matthew McConaughey Hasn’t Worn Deodorant For 30 Years\n\nMcConaughey, 53, has been married to his wife, Camila Alves since 2012. They share three children together: son Livingston, 10, daughter Vida, 13, and son Levi, 14. Meanwhile, Harrelson, 61, has been married to his wife, Laura Louie since 2008. They, too, share three children together: daughters Deni, 30, Zoe, 26, and Makani, 16.\n\nHarrelson and McConaughey have been friends for years and also starred together in 1998’s mockumentary, Welcome to Hollywood, 1999’s rom-com, EDtv and 2008’s Surfer, Dude. Their previous work doesn’t hold a candle to their collaboration on True Detective. The buddies regularly vacation together. They recently went on a “friendship tour.” The tour included last year’s trip to Dubrovnik to celebrate Harrelson’s birthday. During the tour, two were photographed paddle boarding together.\n\nNo word yet on what impact this may have on the reports that McConaughey was in talks to star in a new Yellowstone series amid rumors last month that Kevin Costner was leaving the popular Paramount Network series. Deadline speculated that the issue with the original Yellowstone series was due to Costner and disagreements over shooting schedules. Costner apparently only wanted to shoot for 50 days for the first part of the current season. A source also said that the actor only wanted to spend a week shooting the next batch of episodes.\n\nA Paramount Network spokesperson told Deadline at the time, “We have no news to report. Kevin Costner is a big part of Yellowstone, and we hope that’s the case for a long time to come. Matthew McConaughey is a phenomenal talent with whom we’d love to partner.”\n\nAmerica’s 50 Favorite Actors Of All Time Ranked By Positive Opinion\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
