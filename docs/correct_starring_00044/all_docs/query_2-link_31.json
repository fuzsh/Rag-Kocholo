        "text": "I have a weird thing where I’ve seen a bunch of sequels in movie theaters without seeing the originals first. I saw Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen on opening weekend for some reason. I caught a mid-day showing of The Hangover 2 when it was released a handful of years back out of sheer boredom. I saw Scary Movie 2 in theaters twice, for fuck’s sake! What is wrong with me? Well, it happened again with Now You See Me 2, except this time the movie was actually pretty good. I’ve never seen the original, but I was able to easily follow the highly cerebral storyline without a hitch. I had a lot of fun making assumptions about characters and then letting the movie fill in the blanks. I recommend it!\n\nNow You See Me 2, directed by John Chu (who also took over the GI: Joe film franchise), is the sequel of course to the 2013 film Now You See Me, which became a surprise global hit that fell nowhere on my radar. Starring, among others, Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg, the film concerns a group of magician thieves called The Horsemen, and their apparent plot to take down a corrupt insurance magnate and a black guy played by Morgan Freeman. The sequel ditches Isla Fisher (who couldn’t reprise due to pregnancy) for that girl from Mean Girls (not Lindsey Lohan) whose name I won’t bother to look up. She’s ok. Also joining the cast is a bearded, elfin, cracked-out Daniel Radcliffe, who of course played Harry Potter. Mark Ruffalo and James Franco’s little brother round out the cast.\n\nThe plot of this movie is ridiculous and incomprehensible but involves The Horseman stealing a computer chip that will allow Daniel Radcliffe to erase his digital footprint and maybe do something else quite heinous. It doesn’t really matter because this movie is pure style over substance in the best way possible. Each of the The Horsemen has a different “magic power” that they use a few times during the film. Woody Harrelson is a hypnotist, for example. Chu’s direction really puts a spotlight on the magic tricks and works well. Harrelson’s hypnosis, Franco’s card throwing, Eisenberg’s slight of hand, and Mean Girls girl’s escape acts (maybe?) are all stellar and intense.\n\nYou wouldn’t think the special effects would be a highlight in a movie like this, but damned if it doesn’t look fantastic. There’s a scene where Eisenberg uses his magician’s prowess to stop rain in the middle of the air and it looks gorgeous. The background music is also really well done. Again, Chu is well suited to this type of film. I’m also quite partial to heist films, and this very easily fits that bill. The only downsides to Chu’s direction are in the fight scenes, which are of the jump-cut, quick edit variety. Fortunately there’s not too many of them.\n\nOnce again, having never seen the original film, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect. Now You See Me 2 is a silly, hokey film but man is it fun! It’s definitely not to be taken seriously and it’s not high art, but it works very well as slick, summer escapism. The script, which is largely irrelevant in an okay way, aspires to talk about privacy in the digital age, and it’s silly but fine. It definitely works in a way that I didn’t expect it too. It helps that the actors are all game for the material, particularly Harrelson (in a surprise dual role!), Ruffalo, and Freeman, who really shines as a secondary antagonist. I kind of want to go back and watch the first movie now to compare the two. This has been a pretty shitty summer for movies, but I definitely recommend Now You See Me 2. It’s the best kind of silly, summer escapism.\n\n-Z-\n\nThere’s only one episode left in the first season of HBO’s newest show, True Detective. This police procedural series from creator/writer Nic Pizzolatto, stars Matthew McConaughey (Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey, I should say) and Woody Harrelson, and director Cary Joji Fukunaga began life after being initially green-lit in April 2012 for an eight episode, one season order. True Detective was originally intended as a one-shot affair, but it looks as if critical acclaim and strong ratings will bring us a second season, in all likelihood featuring a new cast of characters following a brand new case (probably due to its leads’ busy schedules). I have been greatly enjoying this show, and I feel it has quickly established itself as one of the best new series on television.\n\nTrue Detective is unique in that it takes place across three distinct periods of time, 1995, 2002, and 2012. In 1995, detectives Rust Cohle (McConaughey, playing an offbeat role) and Marty Hart (Harrelson, playing a no-nonsense cop/family man) take on a new case with a rather gruesome murder at its center. The two men quickly venture deeper and deeper into the murky politics of the show’s Louisiana setting, as they tangentially link a famous minister to the case as well as connect the murder to a drug ring. This is intercut with interviews of Rust and Marty taken in 2012 by two other mysterious detectives, Gilbough (Brother Mouzone of The Wire) and Papania (Miracle at St. Anna, Olympus Has Fallen). 2002 also plays an important role in the series, in that it is the year that Rust and Marty have a falling out, and their personal lives are also greatly affected by their work.\n\nThe first episode of True Detective takes a bit of time to get into, as it is a difficult affair separating the events of 2012 from the events of 1995 initially. Once the viewer becomes accustomed to the stylistic editing choices, however, the story really begins to pick up. The direction, from Cary Joji Fukunaga (2011’s Jane Eyre adaptation) is haunting and gothic, reminiscent of a 70s horror film at times. It is also atmospheric, slow, and beautiful. Fukunaga uses the distinct landscape of southern Louisiana to the benefit of the show on multiple occasions. It also helps that the writing is strong, with show-runner Nic Pizzolatto (who wrote two episodes of the first season of AMC’s The Killing) at the helm. Pizzolatto’s work could potentially fall into southern-fried camp, but never really does. There are a few soapy moments interspersed throughout True Detective, but the writing is by and large strong.\n\nThe show is buoyed by excellent performances from McConaughey and Harrelson, who I’m certain will be receiving Emmy attention next year. McConaughey’s Rust Cohle is a broken man, but plays him differently from Hugh Dancy’s Will Graham character on Hannibal, one of TV’s other best new shows (yes, I realize Hannibal is in its second season). Cohle has spent significant time working undercover with the cartels, and his character’s weariness is visible on-screen at almost all times. He’s also just off-kilter enough to make you nervous and keep you guessing at his behavior and motivation. Harrelson’s Detective Hart is the more traditional hard-edged but fairly straight-laced cop, not unlike Law and Order: SVU’s Eliot Stabler character (famously portrayed by Christopher Meloni). But Hart is, in his own way, as multi-layered and interesting as Cohle, even though the two of them are often at odds with one another.\n\nThere is only one episode left this season of True Detective, sadly. I have greatly enjoyed the first season, and I find myself wondering just how Pizzolato and Fukunaga could possibly top themselves next year when the show returns for season two. I have loved the many twists and turns the story has taken thus far, with its references to the occult and its intense moments featuring the drug trade (the fourth episode, titled Who Goes There, features one of the best action sequences on television I can ever remember). It hasn’t been a totally perfect run, but True Detective has established itself as one of the best shows on television, and its talent both on-screen and off is notable and commendable. All other police procedure television shows: you are officially on notice.\n\n-Z-"
