        "text": "By Stacy Johnson\n\nThe Earth's crust shifts 1,500 miles, the oceans rise up to meet the Himalayas and a super-volcano blows Yellowstone National Park to smithereens, forever changing the face of our nation. What would you do?\n\nFor the characters in \"2012,\" those end times would be a great opportunity to work on a marriage, be a better father or start a new relationship.\n\nDespite the amazing special effects, Roland Emmerich's (\"Independence Day,\" \"10,000 B.C.\") latest end-of-days flick is little more than an overly long excuse to show earthquakes, fires and floods in all their disastrous glory, with interpersonal relationships cobbled on for some semblance of a plot.\n\nScientists around the world notice in 2009 that a solar flare eruption is going to bombard the Earth with neutrinos, causing the core and mantle to heat up and displace the Earth's crust sometime in 2012. They busily begin covering up the knowledge to quell potential riots and start the process of building humanity's only hope, several giant \"arks\" meant to carry only the world's wealthiest people and heads of state through the end times. As you can imagine, everyone else is pretty much up a proverbial creek without a paddle.\n\nWackiness ensues for far too long as our main characters, including down-on-his-luck author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack at his face-twitching best) and geologist Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) grapple with the end of Earth and try to make their way to the arks.\n\nThe effects are obviously worth a watch, either at the theater or on Blu-Ray. Something about seeing California actually drop off into the ocean is awe-inspiring and more than a little ironic. And when you get a train and a plane almost colliding in midair, how can you go wrong?\n\nBut the 2.5-hour run time for \"2012\" kept me wishing for Earth's demise, as quickly as possible. Some judicious editing would have served the picture very well.\n\nThe acting is tolerable, with memorable performances by Woody Harrelson, who plays a nutty conspiracy theorist, and Oliver Platt, great in the slimy villain role. But every time a character gets his or her swan song, the audience is just wishing for more destruction. When Curtis and his family have their reconciliation, I was ready to see someone, anyone, fall into an abyss, any abyss.\n\nIf you are looking for mind-numbing destruction, this film is just what the geologist ordered. Anything more is a bit out of this world for \"2012.\""
