        "text": "The first trailer and poster have been released today for the anticipated family drama The Glass Castle, due for release later this summer, both of which you can view below thanks to Lionsgate!\n\nThe Glass Castle is based on the memoir by writer Jeannette Walls and is co-written and directed by the acclaimed filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton, who brought us the superb Short Term 12 back in 2012. His latest tells the story of author Wallis (played by Oscar Winner Brie Larson, who reunites with Cretton) as she reminisces about her and her siblings’ childhood with their parents and their struggles with poverty.\n\nAs an adult, Walls, now a hugely successful New York journalist, has remained distant from her family and reunites with them after many years. The film version had been mooted since 2007 and at one point fellow Oscar Winner Jennifer Lawrence (American Hustle, Passengers) was to star and produce, with Mark Ruffalo (Spotlight) and Claire Danes (Homeland) at one time or another linked to the project.\n\nAnd while the late summer release date is slightly earlier than many would suggest for awards season, it would not surprise us one bit if the film was still in the mix at the end of the year, in many categories.\n\nHere’s the synopsis:\n\nA young girl comes of age in a dysfunctional family of nonconformist nomads with a mother who’s an eccentric artist and an alcoholic father who would stir the children’s imagination with hope as a distraction to their poverty."
