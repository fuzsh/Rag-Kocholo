        "text": "SARASOTA — A week after scoring another Oscar nomination and 20 years after filming “Palmetto” in the area, Woody Harrelson returned to Sarasota on Monday to make an appearance at Ringling College of Art & Design's sound stages.\n\nThe “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” and “True Detective” actor screened scenes from his directorial debut “Lost in London,” held a question-and-answer session and even sang \"The Kelly Song” he made famous during a 1989 episode of “Cheers,\" the iconic sitcom that launched his career.\n\nMonday’s event was hosted by Studio Lab, a collaboration between Ringling College and Semkhor Productions. And in an interview with the Herald-Tribune during a media roundtable beforehand, Harrelson said he was interested by Ringling College’s own unorthodox way of making movies, incorporating students into the process.\n\n“They’re already doing it, so it’s not just a pie-in-the sky notion,” Harrelson said. “They did that thing with Kevin Smith. So I think that’s pretty cool.”\n\nThe question-and-answer session featured Harrelson showing scenes from “Lost in London,” in which he stars alongside Owen Wilson and Willie Nelson as themselves. It follows Harrelson during a night in London that increasingly goes awry and was made in an unconventional way: filmed live as it was broadcast into 500 theaters.\n\nHarrelson discussed the challenges that came with making a live movie, which entailed everything from acting in real-time to scenes with transportation that was too loud.\n\n“I respect directors so much now,” Harrelson said. “Like, my God, all the stuff they got to do. I’m a lazy guy — I mean, I’m a hard worker and I'm a good worker, but I’m like a world-class slacker.”\n\nHarrelson may be starting out at directing, but his acting career spans more than three decades. He received his third Oscar nomination recently for his performance as Willoughby in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” following Academy Award acting nominations for “The People vs. Larry Flynt” and “The Messenger.”\n\nHe also has won and been nominated for Emmys for his roles in “Cheers” and “True Detective,” and has appeared in blockbusters including “The Hunger Games,” the upcoming “Solo: A Star Wars Story” and “Zombieland,” which has a forthcoming sequel, a new draft for which Harrelson said he just read.\n\nHis lengthy filmography also includes 1998’s “Palmetto,” a neo-noir film costarring Elisabeth Shue and Gina Gershon and shot in Sarasota-area locations including Gator Club. Yet none of his subsequent blockbusters have filmed in Florida, which he attributes to the state’s lack of tax incentives.\n\n“The state’s that making the most movies and has been for a while is Georgia, and that’s because they give a good tax break,” Harrelson said.\n\n“Three Billboards” is Harrelson’s second film with director and playwright Martin McDonagh, following 2012’s “Seven Psychopaths.” And though Harrelson thinks McDonagh is a “true genius,” he said even he was taken aback by how well “Three Billboards” turned out.\n\n“It was a very good script, terrific script, but I don’t think anyone could’ve guessed it that it would turn out quite so amazing,” Harrelson said. “When I first saw it, I came across town to see him in London, and he screened it in the editing bay, he sat there next to me. I watched the whole thing and I was like, ‘This movie’s amazing!’”\n\nHarrelson said that he was initially more interested in the part played by the also Oscar-nominated Sam Rockwell, and that he would’ve turned his role down had the film not been by McDonagh.\n\n“But you know, that would’ve been a big mistake,” Harrelson said. “I turned down ‘Hunger Games’ twice. I mean, I’ve done some stupid things. I can’t believe that I’ve been lucky enough to have this career with all my bad decisions.”\n\nLISTEN: This Day in History"
