The film marked Malick's return to the director's chair after a 20 year absence from filmmaking and features an ensemble cast of dozens of recognizable faces, including many massive stars of the period reduced to mere minutes of screen time and a handful of lines of dialogue. Based on the James Jones novel of the same name, the movie is unlike any war film ever made and showcases Malick venturing deeper into his style of meandering camerawork, striking images of the natural world, and contemplative monologues delivered in voiceover (occasionally by actors we seldom see onscreen). We discuss the storied, decade-long journey of getting The Thin Red Line to screen, a process that involved Malick spending heaps of cash satisfying every one of his fleeting whims and every actor in Hollywood vying for a spot on the film's massive roster characters. Then, we discuss the film's juxtaposition of horrific war imagery with breathtaking shots of wildlife and nature - a visual contrast that enhances Malick's existential preoccupations with the nature of good and evil, darkness and light in the world. Finally, we praise Malick's working method, and how his decision to \"shoot everything\" allows his films to be born in the edit, often taking on thematic and visual nuances that were far from intentional on set, on the day. Chadd produced a new movie, Crumb Catcher, which is out in theaters TODAY 7/19/24. Check showtimes at your local Drafthouse or AMC. Follow Chadd Harbold on Twitter. ....Our theme song is \"Mirror\" by Chris Fish.\n\nOn a warm, partly cloudy night in Vidor,(ViE Dur) Texas, a newspaper boy, up early for his route, noticed that a black 1991 Mercury sedan was pitched forward in the ditch just off Interstate 10. The ditch was located between West Bolivar and the freeway access road. He immediately called the police to report the vehicle and that he was pretty sure there was a body in the front seat. When the police arrived on the scene at West Bolivar and I-10, they immediately saw that there was a body of a woman sitting behind the steering wheel of the car. Her body was upright, back against the seat, and her head was turned toward the right, slightly nestled against the headrest. Her feet were pulled back toward the seat, and she wasn't wearing a seatbelt. When officers called out, “Ma'am?” she did not respond. They checked for a pulse and found that she was dead. The woman's purse and ID were sitting upright on the car's floorboard, but the police already knew who she was. Kathy Page was the wife of Steve Page, whom Detective Ray Mosely had known for most of his life. This murder inspired the Oscar-winning movie Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which Starred Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, and Peter Dinklage.Join Jen and Cam as they discuss \"Behind the Billboards: The Murder of Kathy Page.\"If you have any information on the murder of Kathy Page, please call 1-800-252-TIPS to contact Texas Crime Stoppers, or you can submit a tip to Crime Stoppers online at crimestoppers.com.

The first film, LBJ, which was named to Hollywood's highly respected Black List in 2014, starred Woody Harrelson as LBJ. Joey's second feature, “Shock and Awe,” featured Woody Harrelson, James Marsden, Tommy Lee Jones, Jessica Biel, and Milla Jovovich. He was a member of the writing staff for the first two seasons of “The Good Fight.” He is currently the showrunner and an executive producer of Showtime's “Your Honor,” starring a favorite StoryBeat guest, Bryan Cranston. Joey's debut novel, “The Local,” a legal thriller about an East Texas patent attorney's first murder case, was published in the spring of 2022 by Doubleday, and is being developed as a series with CBS Studios and King Size Productions. I've read “The Local” and can tell you it's a brilliant, fast-paced, thoroughly entertaining legal murder mystery very much in the vein of John Grisham and Scott Turow. I highly recommend “The Local” to you and am very glad that it's being developed for TV. Who knew Intellectual Property law could be so exciting?Joey and his wife, Abby, are adapting the book “In the Blood: How Two Outsiders Solved a Centuries-Old Medical Mystery and Took on the US Army,” as a feature film with Star Thrower Entertainment. For the record, Joey and I have known one another for many years having graduated together from UCLA's famed MFA in Screenwriting program.\n\nTed Danson is dangerously delightful... don't let him try to tell you otherwise.
