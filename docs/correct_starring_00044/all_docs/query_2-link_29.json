        "text": "Jeri Jacquin\n\nCurrently streaming on Netflix from director Patrick Hughes, Bron and Sony Pictures brings the craziness belonging to THE MAN FROM TORONTO.\n\nFreddie Jackson (Kevin Hart) is a go getter with attempting to sell the world on his exercise equipment on the internet. His ideas are not getting anywhere which worries Freddie who is trying to pamper his wife Lori (Jasmine Matthews) for her birthday by renting a cabin for the weekend.\n\nDropping her off at the spa, Freddie drives to the cabin to get it set up for their romantic time. When he gets there, Freddie is met by some very dangerous people wanting him to do something despicable! Being called ‘The Man from Toronto’, he is told by Agent Lawrence (Kate Drummond) who stopped the hit that they need his help.\n\nWanting him to continue to be ‘The Man from Toronto’, they agents tell Freddie everything he needs to know and offer him incentives. Agent Santoro (Jencarlos Canela) is sent to allow Lori a day of shopping to meet Freddie later in the evening. The problem is, someone else is watching what Freddie has been up to.\n\nThe Man from Toronto (Woody Harrelson), the real one, is hot on Freddie’s trail. So close in fact that meeting up with other bad guys looks easy. Freddie is now heading to Puerto Rico and the agents have lost him! On the plane, the two men from Toronto come face to face and the Handler (Ellen Barkin) is not happy and brings in reinforcements with The Man from Miami (Pierson Fode).\n\nThe Man from Toronto, Randy, sees no other choice but to team up with Freddie and the results are stomach churning. All of this is about a weapon that needs a certain man’s voice and a thumbprint. The killer knows that he has to continue the ruse with Freddie because everyone has now seen a photo of him.\n\nBut Freddie has to get back to Lori and Randy goes along only to meet Anne (Kaley Cuoco) who gets the uptight killer to loosen up a bit. Things start to go well until The Man from Miami shows up wreaking a lot of havoc and the agents reconnect and see Freddie with Randy. Agent Davis (Ronnie Rowe) tries to get to them.\n\nThe Man from Miami has what he needs to meet with Colonel Marin (Alejandro De Hoyos) and the Handler shows up with the cash Randy wants. As all the bad guys gather together to hear the speech by the new president of Venezuela, the weapon everybody but Freddie wants is in bad hands. Worst of all, Lori has made it clear she does not know her husband anymore.\n\nThe new problem is that the Handler does not like what is happening and decides that the only thing left to do it call in all ‘The Man From…’ to send Randy and Freddie on the run!\n\nHart as Freddie is doing what he does best, crack jokes, be self-deprecating and makes it clear that his character is a jumpy as a cat on a hot tin roof. Hart has wracked up quite a few buddy films and now, opposite Harrelson, he can be sure that anyone else that wants to line up for their shot at another buddy film is going up against a pro. Even his action sequences are hilarious!\n\nHarrelson as Randy ‘The Man from Toronto’ gets to play the straight guy who has a few sensitive issues. He does not min a good fight but put him on the dance floor and he gets a bit jittery and sensitive. He is the straight man and anchor to Freddie’s constant chaos. I enjoy his performance and I think it made me laugh a bit more than Freddie.\n\nBarkin as the Handler is a woman on a mission. Her job is calling ‘The Man from…’ to do jobs that pay a lot. When Randy and Freddie screw up her plans, she is not about to forgive or forget. Nicely done!\n\nOther cast includes Lela Loren as Daniela Marin, Rob Archer as Oscar, Patrick Garrow as Brennan, Martin Roach as Marty, Jason MacDonald as Coughlin, Kyle Gatehouse as Todd, and Alejandro Ampudia as Green Guy.\n\nNetflix is the world’s leading streaming entertainment service with over 158 million paid memberships in over 190 countries. Enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films, Netflix is across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere and on any internet-connected screen. For more information, please visit www.netflix.com.\n\nTHE MAN FROM TORONTO is a buddy action comedy that does not waste any time getting the action started. Hart is go, go, go and even until the end, he is still going. He is the energizer bunny of action stars. As Freddie, he openly admits he is more afraid of wife Lori than anything Randy can bring to his life.\n\nHarrelson is the anchor to the madness as he keeps his calm when Hart’s character loses his wits. What I loved about this character the most is that what we think we know about him is not what is true. That being said, watching these two actors together is a comedy that will definetly entertain and having a big screen television will make it even more entertaining!\n\nIn the end – hitman meets deadman!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to Bluray, DVD and Digital from director Andy Serkis, in association with Marvel and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is the next adventure of VENOM: Let There Be Carnage.\n\nAt the St. Estes Home for Unwanted Children, it is 1966 and two young people have fallen in love. Cletus Kasady and Frances Barrison are teens subjected to a miserable existence in the institution. One day Frances tells Cletus that she is being taken away to someplace with people like herself and that sets in motion rage of emotions.\n\nFrances does have an unusual power in that she can manipulate sound and on her way to Ravencroft Institute, she shows what she is capable of! A struggle ensues with Officer Patrick Mulligan and Frances is injured but Mulligan believes she died.\n\nThat all happened in the past and now Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is called to speak with Cletus (Woody Harrelson) who is on death row. Symbiote Venom is thrilled to have the opportunity to get out of the house and believes eating prisoners is an okay thing. Mulligan (Stephen Graham) goes along to see if Cletus has any information about the people he is accused of hurting but gets nothing from Eddie.\n\nDuring the visit, Eddie notices something in Cletus’ cell only to discover what managed to evade police. All while learning that the love of his life, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) is engaged to Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott) which Venom is totally upset about. Going back to visit Cletus, Venom gets upset with things that he says and jumps towards the death row inmate. Cletus responds by biting Eddie and instantly feels differently.\n\nOn the way home, Venom becomes upset with Eddie and the insults start to fly, so much so that Venom literally leaves Eddie. While Cletus is being executed, something happens, and a creature destroys everything in its path. Feeling powerful, the first thing Cletus does is name his ‘other’ Carnage and rescues his love Frances (Naomie Harris).\n\nBut they both have a vendetta and revenge is going to sweep through town and Venom has to be found to make it all stop!\n\nHardy as Eddie is ever present and bounces off Venom like insane ping pong ball. It can be difficult to get the upper hand when playing alongside a symbiote, but Hardy is back and manages to get in his one liners and parental tips. It is clear that this time the show is all about Venom and Carnage so Hardy lets them take the lead and he follows along.\n\nHarrelson as Cletus a bone to pick with Eddie but gets something better in return. Getting a chance to release Carnage is a dream come true for this character who does not quite have all his beans in one basket. Harrelson does give us Cletus’ total devotion and love for Frances, just in what the medical community might call ‘unhealthy’ ways.\n\nHarris as Frances is equally devoted to Cletus and when she sees him again, he has a little something else to bring into the relationship. Graham as Mulligan has his own demons to deal with and it all has to do with Frances. The twist is another added bonus to the story.\n\nWilliams is back as Anne with a surprise for Eddie but the surprise may be on her when Venom asks a favor! Scott rides in as Dr. Dan and gets an opportunity to experience a bit of Eddie and Anne’s world before he came along.\n\nOther cast includes Sian Webber as Camille Pazzo, Scroobius Pip as Siegfried and Peggy Lu as Mrs. Chen.\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment encompasses motion picture production for television, digital content and theater releases.

Both are hostile and both want one thing, to create as much havoc as humanly possible. Vemon may have thought he was the toughest alien in town, but Carnage gives him a run for his chocolate.\n\nWe have to talk about Venom for a moment, he is so insanely crazy that it is almost like listening to a parent and a pre-teen going at it constantly. Vemon throws fits and thinks he knows everything while Eddie tries to steer him away from trouble, and it does not always work. I have to say that between Vemon and Deadpool – that would be a match I would pay serious money to see.\n\nVemon’s thought process is hilarious and it does make the film so much more enjoyable so here’s to you, you crazy fit throwing alien infection – well done!\n\nIn the end – let there be carnage!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nCurrently on 4K Ultra HD, Bluray and Digital from writer/director Roland Emmerich and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is the disaster of 2012.\n\nJackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a frustrated writer who has found himself now a chauffer driver of rich Russian Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buric). Spending the weekend with kids Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily), ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) is not surprised that he is late picking them up.\n\nThat is not the biggest worry in the world, that would come from Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who has been given bad news about the planet. Getting that bad news to Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) at the White House means telling the President Wilson (Danny Glover) as well.\n\nJackson takes the kids camping and meets Charlie (Woody Harrelson) who tries to explain that the world is about to experience its end. Believing that Charlie is a one card short of a full deck, Jackson takes it in stride. That is until a phone call from Kate after a hard earthquake brings them all home. While taking Yuri’s kids to the airport, Jackson feels the ground shake under his feet – now he is a believer.\n\nGrabbing Kate, the kids and her husband Gordon (Tom McCarthy) – they all hit the road just as everything around them is literally coming down. The one thing Jackson knows now is that getting back to Charlie to get more information is essential. Helmsely must break the news that everything he predicted is now speeding up rapidly and their plan for survival must start now.\n\nMeeting up with Yuri in Las Vegas, Jackson and his crew and the Russian and his family jump on the plane to find the arks Charlie spoke of. What they never expected was what they will find and how much harder their journey will be to survive the destruction of their world.\n\nCusak as Curtis is trying to recover from writing a book that did not do so well and a family that has moved on without him. Once the planet become erratic, the character of Curtis goes into hyper-survival mode and Cusak does what he does best – gives us a character that you can believe even with all his flaws. Peet as Kate still cares about Curtis even though he makes her nuts. Convinced that Curtis is their only hope, she stands by him and protects her children.\n\nEjiofor as Helmsley is a man who must bring the news to the President. Then a plan is put in place but even as that is happening, Helmsley knows that something is not quite right with how it is playing out. When it becomes clear, Helmsley fights for saving as man human beings as they can – no matter who they are. Platt as Anhauser is just how everyone sees a politician – a little crooked and a lot concerned for himself more than anyone else.\n\nBuric as Yuri is a rich Russian who get the tickets for his family the usual way – lots of money paid. The strange thing is I find Yuri an amusing character. McCarthy as Gordon isn’t happy with having to be saved by his wife’s ex-husband but he does his part to get the family away from danger.\n\nHarrelson as Charlie is terrific, trippy, funny, a little left of center and I absolutely loved his time on the screen.\n\nOther cast include Thandie Newton as Laura Wilson, Beatrice Rosen as Tamara, Alexandre Haussmann as Alec, Philippe Haussmann as Oleg, and Johann Urb as Sasha.\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment encompasses motion picture production for television, digital content and theater releases. The studios include Columbia Pictures, Screen Gems, TriStar Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, Stage 6 Films and Sony Picture Classics.

I mean I LOVE watching things fall apart around the human race because it also shows the best in people. Of course, you will have a few characters that you want to throw in the nearest hole in the earth but, in general, its about survival and helping those around them to survive.\n\nThere is also this amazing creativity in that survival by the characters in these films and Roland Emmerich knows how to get that into all his films. Let’s face it, he has shown us some serious disasters with the films INDEPENDENCE DAY and DAY AFTER TOMORROW. The film 2012 takes that even further because there is not a moment to take a breath but instead feeling part of the group trying to survive.\n\nThat is what makes these films so great and 2012 is stunning in scope, special effects (that you forget are special effects) and the fight for humanity against mother nature.\n\nIn the end – the end is just the beginning!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to Bluray, DVD and Digital from director Roland Emmerich and Lionsgate Home Entertainment comes the story of one of the biggest battles against Japan on MIDWAY.\n\nOn December 7, 1942, Japan surprise attacked Pearl Harbor and the one person not surprised is Lt. Commander Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who had been trying to tell anyone who would listen of an impending attack. Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) returns home to learn of the death of his friends with wife Anne (Mandy Moore) helping him to grieve.\n\nOn ship is Vice Admiral Bull Halsey (Dennis Quaid) waiting for orders to stop the Japanese. His aviation crew include Lt. Commander Wade McClusky (Luke Evans). Put in charge of a plan along with Lt. Cmdr. Layton is Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) who looks to a group of code breakers led by Commander Rochefort (Brennan Brown).\n\nThe first strike is for Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart) and his men to fly to Tokyo and carpet bomb the city. The Japanese are caught by surprise not ever believing it was possible for the United States military to strike back so quickly.\n\nLeading the Japanese fleet is Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano), Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa). Pearl Harbor isn’t their only target as the plan now includes Midway. Gathering all their forces, they are confident that no one sees them coming and victory is sure.\n\nWith so much ship loss at Pearl Harbor, the ships that are left have to come together as well as planes and pilots to make the plan work. Lt. Best and Lt. Cmdr. McClusky go to their men with confidence to let them know that they must give it their all and remember their fallen friends. As the battle for Midway approaches, Nimitz and Layton trust the information given to them by the code breakers to stay ahead of the plan, Best and McClusky fly for their lives as everyone does their part.\n\nIt is the history of taking one step at a time to win.\n\nSkrein as Best is a man who is a little dangerous in the sky, but he wants to be prepared for any eventuality. With each battle, he only wants to go home to his wife and daughter. Using every bit of his flying experience and a little bit of his grit, Skrein gives his character bravery and the will to fight. Moore as wife Anne is a lady, I’d call a spitfire. She knows that what her husband does is dangerous and holds her breath with each bit of news that all the wives can know.\n\nHarrelson as Nimitz is brought into the fight at the time of Pearl Harbor. He has to trust those around him for the information knowing that more American soldiers will die and that’s a hard job to have. Wilson as Layton tried to warn his superiors about what Japan was capable of and they didn’t listen. When given the opportunity to show what he knows and how he knows it, Wilson gives his character strength and determination to stand by Rochefort.\n\nQuaid as Halsey shows his character as a gritty leader who, like everyone else, wants to stop the Japanese fleet from destroying anything else or getting to the west coast of the United States. He may be gruff, but he knows what is necessary to win. Evans as McClusky thinks Best is a reckless pilot but since Pearl Harbor realizes that perhaps reckless, in this case, is a brave thing that is needed in the fight.\n\nKunimura, Toyokawa and Asano have the difficult roles of the Admirals (Rear and Vice) who feel strong that they can win. Pearl Harbor gives these characters a feeling of invincibility and feel Midway is the next reasonable step in their plan. What they do not expect is that the United States military forces have banned together with a plan of their own and they will stop at nothing to punish the Japanese fleet.\n\nOther cast include Alexander Ludwig as Lt. Roy Pearce, Keean Johnson as Chief Aviation Radioman James Murray, Luke Kleintank as Lt. Clarence Earle Dickinson, Brandon Sklenar as Ensign George Gay, Jake Manley as Ensign Willie West, Darren Criss as Lt. Commander Eugene Lindsey, Jake Weber as Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance, James Carpinello as Captain Brockman, Geoffrey Blake as John Ford, Greg Hovanessian as Lieutenant Arizona, David Hewlett as Admiral Kimmel, Mark Rolston as Admiral King and Nick Jonas as Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido.\n\nLionsgate is a global leader in motion picture production and distribution for theatres, television, home entertainment and more. Theatre franchises include THE HUNGER GAMES, and DIVERGENT along with JOHN WICK. Now, adding this film to its 16,000 motion picture and television titles you can see everything coming soon as well as available now at http://www.lionsgate.com.\n\nThe Bonus Materials of MIDWAY are Audio Commentary by Roland Emmerich, “Getting It Right: The Making of Midway, The Men of Midway, Roland Emmerich: Man on a Mission, Turning Point: The Legacy of Midway, Joe Rochefort: Breaking the Japanese Code, We Met at Midway: Two Survivors Remember, Optional English SDH and Spanish Subtitles for the Main Feature and Theatrical Trailer.\n\nMIDWAY is exactly, first, what you’d expect from director Roland Emmerich coming in at 127 minutes long. A Master of Special Effect and the big bangs, the battle scenes on the screen are epic (as I suspect they were in real life). Beginning with the Pearl Harbor attack until the final battle for Midway, the film gives the feeling of all the films Hollywood put out in the 50’s and 60’s that I watched growing up. My father was a Gunner’s Mate on many of Navy ships from aircraft carriers to destroyers like the Hornet, Boxer, Constellation and Kitty Hawk.\n\nSo, I watched many, many films IN HARMS WAY (1965), THE LONGEST DAY (1962), SANDS OF IWO JIMA (1949), FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953), TORA! TORA! TORA! (1973) and the list is endless. I am well versed in war films, so I expect a lot. Emmerich spends very little time depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor because it has been done so many times before. He gets in, makes it clear and moves on because the goal in the storytelling is what happened next and next and next.\n\nThe actors themselves did well with what they were given. There were a few moments where I felt nostalgic with lines being delivered in such a way that I felt I was watching a 50’s/60’s war film instead of 2019. The characters were righteously angry because, let’s face it, no one who saw, was part of and survived Pearl Harbor could ever be the same again.\n\nSkrein, Evans and the rest of the actors portraying the pilots were amazing to my way of thinking. The pilots job back then was to focus on a target and get the job done, that’s how Skrein and Evans made it look and feel which is totally successful in my eyes. Harrelson and Wilson together made a dynamic duo doing something totally different than their predecessors in the job. Harrelson gave his Nimitz portrayal an opportunity to trust when there was really nothing else left and Wilson’s portrayal of Layton jumps in as if to say, ‘we can’t do it the old ways anymore’.\n\nWhat the film lacks in dialogue it makes up for in Emmerich battles and constant action. He proves over and over again with such films as INDEPENDENCE DAY, STARGATE (both personal favorites of mine), THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and INDEPENDENCE DAY: Resurgence, and the best disaster film that is a guilty pleasure with the film 2012. He knows what is epic and MIDWAY falls into that category with ease.\n\nPrepare to revisit MIDWAY!\n\nIn the end – they awoke a sleeping giant!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nStart the new year with good laughs from director Ruben Fleischer and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and the continuation of rules to survival with ZOMBIELAND: Double Tap on Bluray and DVD.\n\nSo, a few years have gone by since we last checked in with the apocalypse survivors as Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) are taking a zombie break living in a big white house. Columbus and Wichita have settled into being a couple, Tallahassee is working on a new vehicle and Little Rock is getting itchy feet.\n\nThinking that Wichita might need something to look forward to, Columbus does his best to clear a path for their life. Spooked by his suggestion, both the girls pack up and hit the road. A month later, Columbus is heartbroken and Tallahassee is about to lose his mind with his whining so hitting up the local mall the two get more than they bargained for. Cute and fluffy Madison (Zoey Deutch) has survived in a mall and is happy to see others.\n\nSo happy that she latches onto Columbus which doesn’t work out really well when Witchita resurfaces with the news that Little Rock has taken up with a non-gun-toting-pacifist named Berkeley (Avan Jogia). On their way to Graceland perks Tallahassee up and all four jump into a vehicle to make their way to see the King – oh yea, and to get Little Rock Back.\n\nFinding a hotel, the gang (minus one and plus one) meet Nevada (Rosario Dawson), Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch). In a scuffle to end all scuffles, the gang (minus one with no plus one) heads off for a place called Babylon where Little Rock is supposed to be.\n\nWell, to make a long story short (I know, too late!), Babylon is a perfect place for Berkeley with their non-gun-pacifist-giving-post-apocalyptic-peace-a-chance. All that would be wonderful except for one thing, a new breed of zombies affectionately called T-800’s are headed toward the drum circle and the only people that know how to stop them are going to do just that!\n\nEisenberg as Columbus is sticking to his rules (well, except for Madison) and knows that since they’ve been laying low for a bit their zombie skills might be a little rusty. Once Wichita comes back the tension is full of well-deserved shade. Eisenberg doesn’t miss a Columbus step. Stone as Wichita is still a strong lady who doesn’t know what she wants relationship wise and her protective sister instincts are strong. She is just fun all the way around.\n\nBreslin as Little Rock has itchy feet because she’s tired of hanging out with people not her age. It isn’t easy and when she meets Berkeley, Little Rock sees a chance to do something different while paying homage to Cheech & Chong with a little road trip. Jogia as Berkeley reminds me of every cliché about guitar playing pacifists to the point that agreeing with Tallahassee is hilarious.\n\nSpeaking of Harrelson as Tallahassee, he has become the father figure to the group whether he likes it or not. When Little Rock runs off you can see his ‘dad’ side come out with wanting to do only one thing – end Berkeley. I love that Harrelson finally got a chance to ham it up with some Elvis impersonating.\n\nShout out to Deutch as Madison because her character is just everything, we never thought we wanted for Zombieland. She is hilarious, speaks her mind even if it doesn’t make sense, isn’t judgmental towards the situation the world finds itself in, is just the happiest survivor I think I’ve ever seen. Plus, she looks absolutely fabulous through the entire film!\n\nDawson as Nevada is a nice addition to the storyline, Wilson as Albuquerque has a truck bigger than Tallahassee’s and Middleditch as Flagstaff knows his Terminator movies and quotes. That’s all I’m saying about that because you should have all the giggles, I did with the new additions to the Zombieland universe.\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment encompasses motion picture production for television, digital content and theater releases.

Also included are The Rides of Zombieland, Rules of Making a Zombie Film, Making Babylon, New Blood and Filmmaker Commentary.\n\nFirst, what I love best about ZOMBIELAND: Double Tap is that the storyline doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel. Instead, it picks up a few years later without missing a sarcastic beat. The characters have become a little lazy behind the walls of their big ole house so adventures in zombie land are inevitable. What hasn’t changed is their idiosyncrasies, their need to not admit that they are feeling anything out of the ordinary like commitment, or the fact that they treat each other exactly as they did in 2009.\n\nThink about that for a minute, it’s been 10 years since we were introduced to ZOMBIELAND and the only one that has aged is Abigail Breslin. Harrelson, Eisenberg and Stone look fantastic and I can’t express enough how glad I am that they all came back to make this sequel. Let’s be honest, sequels don’t always work out well and it is mainly because the expectations are really high. In ZOMBIELAND: Double Tap, the only thing I expected is that the humor be at the same level as before and I wasn’t disappointed in any way.\n\nI had a fun time, enjoyed getting reacquainted with old friends and understanding that the rules that Columbus introduced us to in 2009 are what kept these characters alive. In their world all bets are off because the only thing they need to do is remember they are a family – oh and stay alive!\n\nThat’s right folks, no spoilers here because there is oh so much more to see AND what makes the arrival of the Bluray so very cool is making it a double ZOMBIELAND night and watch both films back to back. Oh yes, that is exactly what is happening in my household this weekend.\n\nIn the end – it’s their world and we just get to enjoy it.\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to theaters this week from director Ron Howard and Walt Disney Studios comes the story of a scruffy-looking-nerf-herder in SOLO: A Star Wars Story.\n\nOn Coreillia, a young Han (Alden Ehrenreich) is trying to get away from the miserable and abusive life on the planet. Wanting to bring the girl who has his heart Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke), he devises a plan that will test his piloting skills. Mere steps from the transport that will take them away, they are spotted and Qi’ra pushes Han to leave without her. Pledging that he will return for her, there is only one thing he can do to make that happen and immediately joins the Imperial Navy who give him the name Han Solo.\n\nSeveral years go by and Han still is having a difficult time. Kicked out of the Imperial Flight Academy, he ends up on Mimban fighting in a battle as an infantryman. That’s when Han notices Imperial Officer Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson) and Val (Thandie Newton) and follows him to discover that he is actually an imposter but not before Tobias has him arrested and thrown in a pit where he meets Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo).\n\nManaging to escape from prison, Han and Chewbacca make their way back to Tobias who sees potential and brings them aboard his ship. Getting help with his next job, Han learns that the leader of the Crimson Dawn, Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany), is expecting a shipment of something called coaxium and Tobias is going after it. The problem is there is someone else interested in doing the same thing which puts Tobias, Han and Chewbacca in danger.\n\nThe meeting with Vos is not something Tobias is looking forward to but Han is shocked to see Qi’ra there all grown up and Vos’ right hand woman. Feeling that their lives are in danger, it is Han who says that they can steal unprocessed coaxium from the mines on Kessel. Agreeing to the plan, Vos also sends Qi’ra with them and she locates smugger Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). In a game of poker brings them all aboard the Millennium Falcon to Kessel and once they get their bounty they have little time to get the unstable coaxium back to Vos.\n\nBut they is also the Cloud Riders led by Enftys Nest as the group learns that they are only trying to make a difference by aiding the rebellion against the Empire. When they arrive to delivery to Vos, he informs them that he knows what they’ve been doing and how he knows shocks Han and Chewbacca. Now Han must deal with the traitor, save a friend and make things right for the Cloud Riders – and he will definitely make sure all scores are settled.\n\nEhrenreich as Solo does a fine job as the young Solo. He has the look of someone who doesn’t take orders well and isn’t about to be told what to do, that’s important. He throws out the arrogant confidence and silly charm that I’d expect from Han Solo. That being said there is something not quite right – oh yes, it isn’t Harrison Ford. Look, I get that it’s hard to walk in on a role that has been made iconic by another actor, in fact I give Ehrenreich props for doing it, but I can’t make the leap in years between this young Han and the Han of 1976.\n\nClarke as Qi’ra is another character that I’m afraid will end up with its own film (gawd please don’t). Kind of broke my heart a little that Leia wasn’t Han’s first love but the more I got to know Qi’ra the less I worried about her. The chemistry between Clarke and Ehrenreich is good. Glover as Calrissian gave a charmer performance and he gave the character swagger and capes. His robot counterpart was far funnier and more interesting to watch however.\n\nHarrelson as Beckett is a smuggler who is going to go with who ever is going to pay him the most. Being a traitor seemed to come naturally to this character and Harrelson gives it his smirk and calmness that ends up being some of the trademarks found in Han. Newton as Val has a small role that works with Beckett and is the smuggler with a heart.\n\nBettany as Vos is a bad guy who doesn’t give one wit of care who knows it or what anyone else thinks of it. In fact he only answers to one person (sorry, no spoiler for you!) so how he handles situations goes easily unchecked.\n\nBig shout out to Suotamo as Chewbacca because I think this is the first film that I’ve seen him in where he’s “talked” so much! It must be said that seeing him on the Millenium Falcon was uber cool.\n\nOther cast include Phoebe Waller-Bridge as L3-37, Jon Favreau as Rio Durant, Linda Hunt as Lady Proxima, Ian Kenny as Rebolt, John Tui as Korso, and Warwick Davis as Weazel.\n\nNow that I’ve given you background lets get right to it, SOLO: A Star Wars Story is just that and nothing more – a story. There isn’t anything in this film that makes me thrilled and may answer only one question that I hadn’t thought to ask. The rest is what I call Star Wars noise and that’s about it. There were laughs, action and plenty of symbolism and nods to the original Star Wars and there isn’t anything wrong with that.\n\nI guess my problem is I wanted something more, something unexpected, something – something! It’s hard to explain it unless you can have a conversation with the 1976 version of me. I think the fact that Han is gone, Luke is gone and Leia is really gone, it is hard for me to care about this film because I never really needed to know the back story of characters. I trusted who they were from the beginning and was happy with that.\n\nNow ROGUE ONE was cool because it didn’t involve the main three characters but instead the story of how R2-D2 got the Death Star plans. That took me in a direction that was where I wanted to go, SOLO just really doesn’t do that. I mean I go for the ride but I’m happy when it’s over.\n\nThis is another difficult Star Wars review to write because I am an original die hard fan, yes I stood in line every Saturday for months to go for the ride and I didn’t need any urging. That’s what I want from anyone who dares to take on the task of making these “A Star Wars Story” film and we all know there are more on the horizon (deep sigh).\n\nI think I also feel a bit like someone is treading on my memories, on my love of the galaxy far, far away. I didn’t embrace these characters but instead wanted to offer them a cup of blue milk in a traveler cup and send them on their way.\n\nSOLO: A Star Wars Story isn’t bad, it’s filled with a lot that fans love and that is going to have to be enough.\n\nIn the end – never tell him the odds!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nThis week on Bluray/DVD and Digital from writer/director Martin McDonagh and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment is the story of a mother who isn’t giving up using THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI.\n\nMildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is a woman dealing with a lot in her life. The painful loss of a murdered daughter, ex-husband Charlie (John Hawkes) who has anger issues and chief of police William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) who she believes doesn’t care about catching her daughter’s killer.\n\nDriving home on a small stretch of road are three dilapidated billboards and Mildred gets an idea. Responsible for the billboards is Red (Caleb Jones) who takes her down payment on all three billboards with a message to the chief of police. The first to see them is deputy Dixon (Sam Rockwell) who immediately tells Willoughby.\n\nEveryone soon learns of the billboards and son Robbie (Lucas Hedges) is feeling the impact of what his mother is doing. Worried how this will all affect her chief of police husband, Anne (Abbie Cornish) is assured that it will all pass. Wanting to protect Mildred is James (Peter Dinklage) who Charlie takes a pot-shots at. Instead of it passing, things get out of hand as the insanity of Dixon and Mildred’s anger start a town war.\n\nSmall town living just got a little dicey!\n\nMcDormand as Mildred is spectacular, amazing, brilliant, moving, shocking and every bit of a woman tired of the b.s.! Feeling unheard by the police and thrown away by an abusive husband, one idea gives this character the remarkable strength to say, without a word, ‘I will be heard or else!’ Every moment McDormand is performing I am completely riveted and engrossed with anticipation as to what she would do next. The Oscars are this Sunday and with McDormand up for Best Actress I will be cheering for her every step of the way.\n\nHarrelson as Willoughby is an understanding and tolerant man. He knows that Mildred is still riddled with grief and now feels the pressure even more that he hasn’t found the killer. He is also dealing with Dixon who is making matters worse with his antics. Spending time with his wife and kids is becoming more important as his secret hasn’t been a secret for quite some time. Harrelson is endearing and is impeccable with his character humor. This is the second time in the last few months that Harrelson has impressed me as his film LBJ should also be seen!\n\nRockwell as Dixon gets to bring out the inner complete douche bag of this character. Feeling he has the right to do what ever he wants to who ever he wants because he has a badge is an embarrassment to pretty much everyone in town. Deciding he isn’t going to stop being a jerk, Dixon once again takes matters into his own hands and it’s nothing but disaster. It sure doesn’t help that Momma Dixon (Sandy Martin) is stoking the fires.\n\nHedges as Robbie is a young man who understands what his mother has been through but doesn’t agree with how she handles things. Living the same pain about his sister every day as well, he watches her actions and can’t seem to make Mildred understand that nothing good can come of it all. Jones as Red is a laid back kid who sees everything the town is about and when it comes to his door a choice has to be made.\n\nDinklage as James is a good hearted guy who seems to have a soft spot for Mildred. He wants nothing more than to protect her – oh and date her. Hawkes as Charlie thinks that he can be as abusive as possible towards Mildred and the ex in ex-husband isn’t going to stop him and is certainly is a different role for Hawkes.\n\nOther cast include Zeljko Ivanek as the Desk Sergeant, Amanda Warren as Denise, Kerry Condon as Pamela, Riya Atwood as Polly, Selah Atwood as Jane, Christopher Berry as Tony, Jerry Winsett as Geoffrey, Kathryn Newton as Angela, Samara Weaving as Penelope, Clarke Peters as Abercrombie, Malaya Drew as Gabriella, and Darrell Britt-Gibson as Jerome.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment brings award-winning global product and new entertainment to DVD, Bluray, and Digital HD.

This film has every range of human emotion possible and isn’t shy about making you feel it. A combination of the darkest of comedy mixed with jaw dropping twists and drama that is engrossing is what makes this film from start to finish.\n\nThere isn’t anything apologetic in this film and each character has a life of its own. McDormand is powerful and doesn’t skip a beat in leading the film to its chuckling conclusion. Harrelson and Rockwell are polar opposites, which is what makes their characters work and there is no surprise in what these two actors accomplish in this film.\n\nThe film does a dance with the viewer’s emotions and even sets of a shock or two but after seeing director McDonagh’s previous work such as IN BRUGES and a personal favorite SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS could anyone not expect this film from him? I met McDonagh during his press junket for SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS and I knew after speaking with him that I’d love anything he did. His sense of humor and way with characters comes out in every second of the film.\n\nWriting the screenplay with McDormand in mind for the lead role, I am equally thrilled that he did so because she rules the screen as Mildred. This is a powerful film with exceptional performances that can not and should not be missed. THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI has been nominated for seven Academy Award Nominations including Best Picture.\n\nThe Bluray/DVD include the Special Features Deleted Scenes, Crucify ‘Em: Making Of, Six Shooter – The Academy Award Winning original short film by Martin McDonagh as well as a Gallery.\n\nThis film is the reason I go to the theatre and even more so the reason I believe in having it as part of any home entertainment library.\n\nIn the end – welcome to Ebbing, Missouri!"
