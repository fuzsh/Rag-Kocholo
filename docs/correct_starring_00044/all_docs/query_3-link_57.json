The sequel also performed well, grossing $122 million globally, proving the enduring appeal of the characters and the world they inhabit. Harrelson’s return as Tallahassee was met with enthusiasm, and his performance once again balanced humor with the grit required to survive in a zombie-infested landscape.\n\n5. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)\n\nIn “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” Woody Harrelson delivered one of his most critically acclaimed performances as Chief Bill Willoughby. The film, directed by Martin McDonagh, tells the story of a grieving mother, played by Frances McDormand, who challenges the local authorities to solve her daughter’s murder by placing provocative billboards on the outskirts of town. Harrelson’s character, Chief Willoughby, is portrayed as a well-intentioned and compassionate police officer struggling with a terminal illness and the pressure of the unsolved case.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial success, grossing over $160 million worldwide against a production budget of $12 million.
