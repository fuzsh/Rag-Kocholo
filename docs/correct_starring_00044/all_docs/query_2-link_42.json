        "text": "\"Download my blog\" – Charlie Frost\n\nWhen 2012 was released in 2009, it came with a nifty built-in self-destruct mechanism. Back then there was a chance, however minuscule, that the Mayans were right and the world really was about to come to a spectacular end. However, now it is November 2013, and the Mayans are all feeling pretty stupid.\n\nAnyone watching 2012 for the first time won't experience even the tiniest twinge of foreboding. Instead, they will just think that people in 2009 were all superstitious idiots. But you've seen 2012 before. That or you've got an impressively cavalier attitude toward spoilers. Either way, you're rewatching it purely for the spectacle.\n\nSo, has 2012 been permanently hobbled by the date in its title, like Space 1999? Or can it move beyond those constraints and become a timeless piece of art, like Will Smith's millennial single Will 2K? Let's watch and find out.\n\n\"We're not making a baby in the supermarket\" – Kate Curtis\n\nReading on mobile? Click here to view behind-the-scenes video on special effects\n\nRoland Emmerich's 2012 was a commercial success because people love seeing the world be obliterated in new and exciting ways on film: tectonic plates snap and heave upwards; megawaves consume everything in their path, from the White House to Elliot Gould; lava gets squirted around so willy nilly that you'd swear you were watching a pointlessly expensive remake of the Bugsy Malone food fight. All said, the destruction is brilliant.\n\nBut if you came for the Armageddon, will you stay for the characters? Probably not. The film's characters are so woefully irredeemable human beings that you end up rooting for the volcanos. The president is a bungling Mr Bean figure, lurching haplessly from disaster to disaster. His chief of staff is a self-interested maniac. Amanda Peet is a cookie-cutter shrewish wife. There's a cruel Russian billionaire and his vapid girlfriend. And then there's John Cusack at his most regrettably John-Cusack-in-anything-other-than-Sixteen-Candles-and-maybe-Grosse-Pointe-Blank-est.\n\nIn fact, only two characters are worth giving a damn about: Woody Harrelson's raving conspiracy theorist (but only because he's only in it for about five minutes and gets to say \"download my blog\"), and Thomas McCarthy's Gordon Silberman. Poor Gordon. He's skilled and handsome and funny, and all he wants to do is work hard and keep his family together. But even though he's a much better husband, father and person (and he's a trained pilot), Gordon ends up dying so that John sodding Cusack can have a happy ending. Curse you, John Cusack.\n\n\"The neutrinos coming from the sun have mutated into a new kind of nuclear particle. They're heating up the earth's core and suddenly act like microwaves\" – Dr Satnam Tsurutani\n\nNo conversation about 2012 is complete without a reference to the science behind it. After all, Nasa called it the most absurd science fiction film of all time. Think about that for a moment. Think about all the ludicrous sci-fi films that have ever been made: Robot Monster, The Brain from Planet Arous, The Lawnmower Man. And yet 2012 is legitimately sillier than all of them. Chief offenders here are the neutrinos, which are sent from the sun and suddenly boil the Earth's core without scorching its surface to a crisp first. But don't forget that the crust displacement and flooding of the Himalayas are wrong, the pressure calculations are all skew-wiff and blogs apparently need to be downloaded now. The whole thing is a mess.\n\nBut the bad science shouldn't spoil the film for you. Nor should the fact that it was based on a prediction that didn't come true. No, what should spoil 2012 for you is that John Cusack gets to kiss Amanda Peet at the end, even though her husband – who by all accounts was a much better human being – has just died. I'll never forget you, Gordon. I'll never forget you.\n\nObservations\n\nDirector Roland Emmerich should have remembered the lesson of his previous Armageddon film, The Day After Tomorrow. It's aged much more gracefully, because, technically, the day after tomorrow is in the future, so there's still a chance we could find ourselves on an abandoned container ship trying to outrun some ice while we're being attacked by a pack of murder-wolves.\n\n\"Surface cracks? But I've got a plastic surgeon for that.\" It's good to know that, even at the end of the world, radio DJs still have the ability to be the worst people alive.\n\nHere's a debate for the comment section: which is better, the Mr DNA cartoon from Jurassic Park, or Woody Harrelson's rip-off Mayan cartoon from 2012?\n\n2012 is two-and-a-half-hours long before commercials. It felt longer than that."
