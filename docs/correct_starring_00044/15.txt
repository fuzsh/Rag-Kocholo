When a movie comes with the words “from the producer of Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow” you just know that we’re going to see an epic disaster flick, and 2012 doesn’t disappoint.

Starring John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Oliver Platt, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Woody Harrelson, 2012 has as its premise:

“Never before has a date in history been so significant to so many cultures, so many religions, scientists, and governments. The human race is impacted by a global cataclysm, which lead to the end to the world and has survivors struggling for their lives.”

As much as the premise is obviously bollocks (hardly surprising), the trailer looks…well….epic. The aircraft carrier being washed over the White House at the end is a very nice touch as well.

2012 is due out November 13, 2009. Here’s the 2012 movie trailer:
