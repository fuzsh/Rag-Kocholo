Woody Harrelson has joined the cast of Roland Emmerich's 2012.

The actor told MTV that he was surprised but happy to be a part of the big budget disaster movie.

He said: "I don't know why they thought of me. But I like the idea.

"I play a guy who's been talking for a long time, the whole world thinks he's crazy. But he's been talking that there's gonna be hell to pay for what's been going on ecologically and everything."

John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejifor, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Thomas McCarthy and Chin Han are already among the cast.

The film, which begins shooting in Vancouver next month, is scheduled for release on July 10, 2009.
