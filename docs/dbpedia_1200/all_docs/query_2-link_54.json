        "text": "Meet CRICKETS, made up of JD Samson (Le Tigre, MEN), Michael O’Neill (MEN, Princess) and Roddy Bottum (Faith No More, Imperial Teen/Nastie Band).\n\nThey’ve dropped the exciting new track ‘Elastic’ alongside news of their self-titled debut album that’s set for a July 17th release.\n\n‘Elastic’ lyrically deals with toxic masculinity and finding power in healing, presented in one minimally transfixing package. Plus, the collective are donating all proceeds from this single to INCITE! and the Okra Project.\n\nThe band are on a mission to explore minimalism and celebrate restraint, putting a rant of queer prose to a musically brilliant production. It’s sounding pretty fantastic."
