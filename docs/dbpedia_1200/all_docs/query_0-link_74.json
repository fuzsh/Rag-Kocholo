        "text": "MEN_press_photo\n\nMichael O'Neill (on left) and JD Samson make up the band MEN.\n\n(MEN publicity photo)\n\nJD Samson is many things: an activist, musician, songwriter and DJ. Yet, for her, such identifiers come with being an artist.\n\nSamson became well-known 13 years ago as a member of Le Tigre, a pop-punk feminist band. As that group amicably parted ways, she formed a new project, MEN.\n\nFor six years bandmate Michael O’Neill and Samson have produced politically-charged dance music, with a focus on live performance. The pair will perform in the Valley Saturday night, at Flywheel Arts Collective. MEN will take the stage at Flywheel just after the one-woman political theatre piece \"MOM BABY GOD.\"\n\nRead a profile of the play, \"MOM BABY GOD.\"\n\nIn a phone interview Monday, Samson discussed making the group's second album, LABOR, her connection to Western Massachusetts, and how she's \"gone past being punk.\"\n\nFor your current tour, you're performing in Boston, New York, Washington D.C. and Chicago. Why stop in Eastampton?\n\nWell, actually, we had a day off on the tour and needed to fill it somewhere on the East Coast. We have somewhat of a relationship with the area. I went to Sarah Lawrence College, but a lot of my friends went to Hampshire (College) and Smith (College) so I’ve spent a lot of time in Northampton. Michael, my bandmate, actually went to Hampshire.\n\nSpeaking of Hampshire, a few years ago MEN performed at the college.\n\nIt’s always fun to play colleges because I think a lot of people come out just because there is a show going on, and they may not even know the music. That show was a real party, which makes me remember how much partying goes on in college.\n\nDo you find that your audience is a lot of college-aged people?\n\nI think we have a wide-range of venues that we play at. Sometimes we play at colleges, other times at museums or or art spaces which tend to have an older crowd. We’ve even played daytime events with a lot of kids in the audience. Some people really like our music because of the politics; some people like us for our musicality.\n\nOn politics, you've managed to be outwardly political on gender and LGBT rights yet have gained mainstream attention, a line that can be difficult for many. How have you managed to do so?\n\nLuckily I was in Le Tigre which focused on bringing out both elements equally. That’s one thing that has really helped me, my history in music. Another thing is that, as an artist, politics are important to me. I don’t really consider myself a musician; I’m an artist that has gained attention for my music. I think I work conceptually in many different mediums. I feel lucky to be a part of a project where I can write lyrics that are political, be an activist and also make visual art.\n\nDo you find the label \"musician\" too confining?\n\nYea, the reason why I joined Le Tigre was to be a performance artist. As a multimedia project, we focused just as much attention on visuals as we did on politics and music. I think the product that we made was music, but for me, it was more than that.\n\nDo you find it difficult to intertwine your politics within your art?\n\nI think it’s pretty easy for me to create politics out of my life. Me walking outside and going to the store is really different than, you know, another person going outside. I think that’s what I find interesting about life in general. The way people live their lives differently through identity politics is interesting to me and the reason why I make my work.\n\nThe name of the band, MEN, is political in itself, correct?\n\nYes. In the beginning of the project we had been joking with this philosophy for living which is, ‘What Would a Man Do?’ It was a way for women in the music industry who felt like they were being pushed around, or not taken seriously to consider what a man would do. It was kind of a joke, like, if someone cuts you in line you should stick up for yourself. It was a confidence-building technique.\n\nOne day, when we were asked what the name of the band should be we thought MEN would be a really good idea. Since then, we’ve been finding other ways to encapsulate the idea of men, in general. We think of the name as a way to get rid of the gender binary structure, and think more of gender fluidity. So, we decided we wanted to be men.\n\nYou'll take the stage following the one-woman theatre piece, \"MOM BABY GOD.\" How did you become connected with Madeline Burrows' performance?\n\nWhen we contacted Flywheel and asked for the space they said they have an event already booked, but perhaps we could share the night. When they told us about (Burrows’) event, I was really excited about the project. It’s by chance, but a really great pairing.\n\nYou came to notoriety while apart of Le Tigre, another political musical group. What aspects of MEN are similar to being apart of Le Tigre and what differs?\n\nIt’s a different collaboration completely, and I’ve grown a lot. As a musician I’ve gone past being punk. Not to say that I’m not punk in my DIY (do it yourself) style, and that I’m a self-taught musician and artist, but I feel like I’m more interested in being a more well-rounded music producer. I also think that I’m older and have different interests in terms of what I write about, and how I write music.\n\nMEN's music is obviously very different than punk. On your website bio, MEN is described as \"focusing on the energy of live performance and radical potential of dance music.\"\n\nI think a lot of times when listening to a record you lose that humanization. For a live show, I really consider that. For us, we make music that sounds pop-ish, but I don’t lip-synch. A lot of bands now that make pop music are not really singing at live events. But we want to have a club atmosphere; we want it to feel like you’re going out dancing. We want people to feel like they’re coming together as a community, discussing things that matter in a fun atmosphere.\n\nLABOR is your newest album that came out only a few weeks ago. How would you describe the sound of this album?\n\nTo me, sound and content go hand-in-hand. This album is about self-discovery. We switch a lot from genre to genre. A lot of the songs are experimental in nature, in how they were put together in production and the way they were written. Other songs are really pop-ish, and dance floor ready. The album represents a journey.\n\nDo you have a favorite song off the album?\n\nI did really like, “I Don’t Care,” but now I like “Neon Poles.”"
