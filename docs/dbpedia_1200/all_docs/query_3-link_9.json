        "text": "After quitting Bikini Kill, Hanna retreated from the scene and released a record of sampler-based solo music under the name Julie Ruin in 1997. Tired of performing her anger over blistering power chords for most of the â90s, Hanna was ready to try joy. She moved out of D.C.âs blunt-force approach to political music and started working in a mode more aligned with her new home of New York. While putting together a band to help her perform her new music, she found herself forming a new group with Johanna Fateman and Sadie Benning. They called themselves Le Tigre, and set about making feminist jams that could scorch a dancefloor. âPeople would come up and be like, âWhy arenât you angry anymore?ââ Hanna said in a 2019 Gusher interview. âIâm totally fucking angry. Thatâs just not how Iâm singing right now. I had to get to a place where I could celebrate the achievements that Iâve made, because I was just depressed.â\n\nIn a 2019 Red Bull Radio Fireside Chat, Hanna explained more her mindset at the end of the â90s: âLetâs just make something totally happy thatâs a gift about everything great thatâs happened,â she said. âWe want to write political pop songs and be the dance party after the protest.â\n\nA year before the Avalanches released the plunderphonics classic Since I Left You, Le Tigre established their own collaging practice. âSadie and I spent time just collecting samples and creating libraries for ourselves,â Fateman tells me over the phone. âEvery once in a while, we would spend a couple hours going through records or VHS tapes or whatever sound sources we could find. We would sample a note from a record and then detune it to make a melody. We werenât necessarily using it as a form of quotation as much as we were collecting sounds we could use. Because we didnât have a lot of synthesizers or a lot of things to make sounds with, we would find these weirdly textured things and just play them on different keys.â\n\nLe Tigreâs unconventional sound-sourcing strategy complemented their renegade approach to writing. âDeceptaconâ doesnât really have a chorus. Because it revolves around a single four-note bassline and its structure never shifts from bedrock, every single element that comes in hits like a barbed hook. The sampled handclaps, the guitar riff (thereâs only one, and it gets sped up to a hilarious clip for the ânoodlyâ parts), the âwho took the bompâ (a play on Barry Mannâs 1961 hit âWho Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)â), all crash into the ear in such a whirlwind that the ear craves more of them. These disparate sound bites, plumbed from far-flung sources, tug on your attention like a bee sting. Instead of playing to the tension and release that govern traditional pop songs, Le Tigre aimed a candy-crusted torpedo straight at their listenersâ pleasure centers.\n\nâThereâs none of what youâre supposed to have to build excitement in a pop song. There is none of the pathos of a key change,â says Fateman. âItâs on or off. Thatâs the structure. We were trying to make different kinds of songs about different feelings and different ideas that werenât in pop music or punk music at that time.â\n\nIf Bikini Kill distilled the pain of living under patriarchy into bursts of righteous fury, then Le Tigre subsumed that pain into the catharsis of pleasure, a strategy deployed to great effect in New Yorkâs disco clubs in the â70s. âWanna disco? Wanna see me disco?â Hanna screams in âDeceptaconâsâ first verse, as if daring her listeners to re-politicize the corporate, sanitized history of dance music. Before the Bee Gees whitewashed it, disco was survival for queer communities of color. It signified safety during a time when gay bars were outlawed in New York.\n\nâWe knew [âDeceptaconâ] was catchy. It felt like an icebreaker. I remember having a strong feeling it should be the first song,â Fateman continues. âIt came to be our most popular song, so in that way it became anthemic. Early on, for some people, it recalled the Bikini Kill era â it was a familiar reference point for people who knew about us from that connection. But then it became its own thing. People like that song but donât know about Bikini Kill or riot grrrl at all. Itâs kind of a âfuck youâ song. Thatâs a classic trope.â\n\nAfter George W. Bush ascended to the presidency in 2000 and promptly plunged the US into a state of total war, detached escapism became the mode du jour of both mainstream and underground music cultures. Le Tigreâs strategy of layering fierce punk vocals over electronic whimsy crystallized into what came to be known as electroclash, a brief but bright-burning aughts microgenre that cleared open space for groundbreaking artists like Alice Glass and Grimes. Thereâs a little of âDeceptaconâ in the latter artistâs breakthrough 2012 record Visions, in the way basslines bubble and vocals sputter and squall. Grimes famously assembled that album in GarageBand, Appleâs glossy digital answer to the four-track tape machine. Like Le Tigre, Visions proved you didnât need to be a man to slap together a walloping computerized beat, even if the conceit that women sing and men produce lingered after its release. âIâm tired of men who arenât professional or even accomplished musicians continually offering to âhelp me outâ (without being asked), as if I did this by accident and Iâm gonna flounder without them,â Grimes wrote in a 2013 Tumblr post.\n\nThe futurity promised by turn-of-the-millennium digital culture has more or less putrefied into startups and surveillance. Computers of all sizes have started to feel more like a Sisyphean burden than a portal into a brave new world. But the music they enable â the hyperreal textures that slink out of soft synths, the towering monolithic drums, the syrupy, slowed-down vocals â all that still sounds like the future.\n\nMany of this eraâs most adventurous artists cite Le Tigre as a fomenting influence. As well as the aforementioned, in a 2016 interview with Milk, multidisciplinary queer artist Colin Self said, âBy the time I was 13/14 years old, Iâd seen people like Le Tigre and Sleater-Kinney perform live, all of these riot grrrl bands. Essentially I remember being like: âthatâs what Iâm going to do with the rest of my life.ââ In 2014, queer rapper Mykki Blanco recruited Hanna for a song on the mixtape Gay Dog Food. The track, âA Moment With Kathleen,â begins with the sound of Blanco freaking out about getting to meet his idol.\n\nIt follows, in retrospect, that a micromovement of gender-weird geniuses would find life in Le Tigre. Songs like âDeceptaconâ split apart the expected structure of the electronic pop song and stitched it back together deliriously and delightfully wrong. âIt sounds outdated to talk about stuff like this, but we were really into quote-unquote deconstruction,â says Fateman. âDeconstructing a song in the sense of taking little samples from it and building something else, but also in the more conceptual sense of: what is a song? What is rock music? What is a band? All of the masculinist values that run through that stuff at every level, at the level of who plays guitar, who made this note â thatâs what we thought about all the time.â\n\nSometimes bands send Fateman note-for-note rock covers of âDeceptacon.â The songâs quick, squiggly guitar part, the one made from a slow riff sped up, gets played in a flash across the fretboard, a masculinist display of technical dexterity. The song has resonated even among those who miss the point. âItâs just like, well, you kind of negated the content of the song!â Fateman says. âBut it sounds the same if you like bar bands.â\n\nThe point is that anyone can borrow the chorus to a 1961 heteronormative love song and turn it into a rallying cry for feminine independence. The point is that no matter the tools available to you, chaos belongs anywhere you can cram it. Decades after Le Tigreâs debut, queer electropunks still carry âDeceptaconâsâ flaming torch."
