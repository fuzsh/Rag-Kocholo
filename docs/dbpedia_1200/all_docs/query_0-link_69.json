        "text": "“Feminist punk electronic music” is how the band describes its sound. Led by Bikini Kill founder and riot grrrl Kathleen Hanna, Le Tigre tackles the Bush administration on stridently political tracks like “Seconds” and “New Kicks.” The group’s punk roots are reflected on “Punker Plus,” while its electronic side is on full display on the robotic “Tell You Now,” produced by Cars frontman Ric Ocasek. And, just to show it has a sense of humor, Le Tigre raps Beastie Boys-style on the equality rant “Nanny Nanny Boo Boo.”"
