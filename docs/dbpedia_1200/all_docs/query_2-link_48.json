        "text": "About Le Tigre\n\nLe Tigre is a feminist dance-punk trio. They formed in 1998 by Bikini Kill vocalist Kathleen Hanna. Initially envisioned as a live back up band for Hanna's solo moniker Julie Ruin, Le Tigre mixed the politics and feminism of riot grrrl with fun electronic samples and lo-fi beats. Other members included Johanna Fateman and JD Samson. JD joined Le Tigre as a full member when co-founder Sadie Benning left the band before the Feminist Sweepstakes album. JD had previously worked with the band as the roadie and operator of the slide show created by Sadie Benning for Le Tigre's live performances of the first record. The self-proclaimed underground electro-feminist performance artists combined visuals, music, and dance into their performances.\n\nThe song \"Hot Topic\" on Le Tigre's self-titled début pays tribute to dozens of visual artists, musicians, writers, feminists and others who have inspired them. Among the honorées are: Yoko Ono, Aretha Franklin, Vaginal Creme Davis, Yayoi Kusama, Sleater-Kinney, Billy Tipton, James Baldwin and Jean Genet. In a similar fashion the song \"FYR\" off the album Feminist Sweepstakes is a tribute to the chapter and ideals put forth in Shulamith Firestone's Fifty Years of Ridicule in her 1970 feminist work The Dialectic of Sex.\n\nThe first two recordings by the band were released on the independent label Mr. Lady Records, run by Kaia Wilson of The Butchies and artist Tammy Rae Carland. Feminist Sweepstakes (2001) came out on Chicks on Speed's record label. The album This Island (2004) was Le Tigre's first on a major label (Universal/Strummer). Ric Ocasek of The Cars produced one track, \"Tell You Now.\"\n\nEven after signing with Universal, Le Tigre has continued to work with independent labels. In 2005 they released This Island Remixes with Chicks on Speed.\n\nIn 2005 Le Tigre performed at the Michigan Women's Music Festival. The festival has been criticised for its women-born-women admittance policy, which prohibits transgender women from attending.\n\nLe Tigre licensed two of their songs for use in advertisements by a Canadian telephone provider, Telus, and an Australian jewellery chain, Goldmark. A sample from \"Deceptacon\" plays in the background of a 2006 television commercial for Nivea cosmetics and is also used in the Norwayan movie Reprise by director Joachiem Trier.\n\nThe band is currently on hiatus but says that they are only taking a year off, and intend to begin making music again.\n\nShow More\n\nGenres:\n\nPop\n\nLe Tigre is a feminist dance-punk trio.
