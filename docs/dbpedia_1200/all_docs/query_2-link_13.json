Other members included Johanna Fateman and JD Samson. JD joined Le Tigre as a full member when co-founder Sadie Benning left the band before the Feminist Sweepstakes album was recorded. JD had previously worked with the band as a roadie and the operator of Benning's slide show during live performances in support of their first record. The self-proclaimed \"underground electro-feminist performance artists\" combined visuals, music and dance in their performances.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nListen Now!
