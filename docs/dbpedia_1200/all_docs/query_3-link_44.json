If you described this to me in any way, it would be all the things I hate about music. And I fucking love it! This should have been much more of a thing, it should have been emulated, started a trend. How did it not?\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\nCouldn't stand it\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nYes yes yes yes yes yes!!! This is one of my all-time favourite albums ever!!! Kathleen Hanna is THE 90s badass feminist hero I needed. I love the aggressively screeching vocal tones she brings to her performances and I also love the soft vulnerable side she shows. Women are strong powerful beings and we’re unstoppable when we’re given space to speak our minds freely and exist in a respected space. She has such a unique perspective and communicates it so unapologetically. I love every minute of this album: it gives you a killer in your face balls to the walls opener with Deceptacon, then takes you through a winding and frenetic feminist journey celebrating pride, iconic women, New York, and art that culminates with an impassioned moment of gratitude for music and people who make a difference in our lives with Les and Ray. I love the way that song sounds and the genuine appreciation for divergent lifestyles and alternative pathways that it expresses. It fucking rocks so fucking hard! It’s so wildly and daringly different from everything else that was on the market in 1999 and I salute it.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nAnother punk/pop punk/post-punk band that I've only ever heard of and never really given a chance. Le Tigre come out of the blocks swinging and don't let up until they've left a trail of destruction in their wake. They've got a Rudy Giuliani protest song that's relevant 21 years later. Best track: Deceptacon\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nReally enjoyed. Hard rocking beats with feminist message.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\nI found it really annoying\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nBrief story: prior to today, my only exposure to Le Tigre was this godawful song they released through Pitchfork in 2016, in support of Hillary Clinton, called \"I'm With Her.\" I saw it then, and rewatched it today, and both times I've felt like it's possibly the worst piece of art ever created. May have singlehandedly given the election to Trump, just unbelievably embarrassing stuff. What's more punk rock than campaigning for a Clinton? The video is on youtube, with comments disabled (and dislikes don't exist anymore), but you can bet your ass this thing was lampooned to oblivion. So with that as the backdrop, I was gleefully bracing myself for a prequel, bracing for the worst punk shit I've ever heard. But damn, this album's actually really fun. Some really cool, engaging instrumentals, the lyrics are outraged, outrageous, and political in a way that's, at least for me, tongue in cheek and obviously more genuine than anything having to do with Hillary Clinton. \"Deceptacon\" is a drop dead classic man, I swear I've heard that before. If it's not canonized, it should be. The \"what's your take on Cassavetes\" track is seriously funny, I don't know if they're expecting us to take this seriously but I had a good time laughing with these songs. \"Dude Yr so Crazy\" too, just a list of buzzwords, it's so funny. Again, based on the atrocity that they committed in 2016, I'm afraid they may be genuine in all of this, which may work to their detriment. Otherwise, they're in on the joke on this album, and they purposely made the worst song of all time to secretly throw the election for Trump? I'm getting brainworms, ignore me. Great album though. Favorite tracks: Deceptacon, What's Yr Take on Cassavetes, Slideshow at Free University, Dude Yr so Crazy. Album art: I honestly love this one. Bright, popping colors. Headshots on the side like they were printed from a photobooth, and the lo-fi homemade look is certainly fitting. Really fantastic cover. 4/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\nA forgettable, boring ass record from a late to the party girl punk group that brought exactly nothing new or entertaining. 1/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\nlots of yelling out of tune\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\n*_____*\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nI was expecting punk screaming but this was a really fun album to listen. A good mix of punk and rock with a bit of electronic. Good for a morning jog!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nthe raw weirdness of this electronic rock is super refreshing. “Deceptacon” is such a strong start but I wanted to hear MORE like it. something was missing - I loved it though. I feel like it had some 60s pop & early 80s Brit rock influences wrapped with a modern American sound which was cooollll. the songs were janky but it worked with sometimes simple lyrics paired with rough guitar. very good 😈\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nLe Tigre seems a bit lazy on purpose. I appreciate the punk vibe they are apparently going for, but I always thought specifically of \"Hot Topic\" as a pop-culture store that tries-hard to be a punk-culture store, and by try-hard I don't mean the good kind. I think it's cool that the band pushes for feminism. But I think they push a bit too much, making it their identity instead of just part of who they are. I think if I had heard this album when I was a teenager I would have liked it a lot more than I do today. Now they sound like an audio STD, and I don't want to hang out with the band. I give it 2/5.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nSome parts are more tolerable than others, and the singer will test your patience, but redeemable enough to avoid a 1.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\n🤧\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\nLe Tigre by Le Tigre (1999) Tiny tiny voices scream histrionic bleats about god-knows-what, from a flash-in-the-pan morality that not only doesn’t age well—it doesn’t age at all. Their pronouns are so offensive. The litany of heroes in the musically mechanical “Hot Topic” makes their cookie cutter political/cultural stance clear, but could we get some depth? Or even a bit of detail? Here’s a revealing snippet from “Eau D’Bedroom Dancing”: “There's no time for me to act mature. The only words I know are \"more\", \"more\" and \"more\". No one to criticize me then.” Read some Rimbaud, girls. I picture these songs being sung while the young ladies are on the playground jumping rope. The ‘music’ is stumbled across, not composed; canned, not performed. The recording is flawed with distortion on the lead ‘vocals’ and a horrible mix. The best voice performance on this record is the intro to “Phanta” (you’ll have to listen to get the joke). No gimmick on this 1999 album hadn’t already been done over and over. Even girls cussing in a junior-high-school-sounding timbre. They seem unaware of (more likely unconcerned by) the way this comes across to men. There’s a certain menace at work here. It validates every misogynistic trope. 1/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nthis is definitely a perfect punk album for me, it just hits everything flawlessly the production is amazing with all the electronic drums and weird samples Kathleen’s singing and vocals are fucking perfect in every song the writing is also really cool and can get pretty meta and with so many weird, amazing songs like the hilariously literal What’s Yr Take on Cassavetes or the groovy, spoken-word-sample Slideshow at Free University it’s got perfect songs for if you just wanna fuck shit up, like Deceptacon or The the Empty and it’s got perfect songs for if you just wanna vibe out, like Les and Ray or Eau D’bedroom Dancing I don’t have a single issue with this perfect, perfect, punk, new wave, feminist masterpiece - this is an 11 out of 10 I gotta check out Kathleen Hanna’s other stuff\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI had received the song “Deceptacon” on a mixtape from a friend in the early 2000s and really liked it. I should have taken the cue to investigate Le Tigre further! This album kicks ass and sounds great doing it! References to Cassavetes?! The main single listing feminist icons?! Fuck Giuliani!? Count me in! Every song on this appealed immediately to me. The lo-fi instruments are magic in their hands. The lyrics seem very personal. I love it! On the first listen this seems to have become my favorite punk album.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI have heard of this band, but was not actually familiar with this album at all. On first listen, I thought that it was interesting. On the second, I thought, I like these ladies. As I did a quick third overview, I decided I really really like Le Tigre.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nWhat a delight this album was. A retro sound of early 80s new wave/punk, itself evoking 1960s pop, with so much brilliance to say in a clever way. Put a big smile on my face.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nLove it. I really love this sound. I've been reading a book about Riot Grrrl and Kathleen Hanna so I'm quite invested in the genre at the moment. It's such a raw sound and really feels like people just making music for the sake of music with proper political though and force behind it which I don't think you see as much these days because social media gives a simpler avenue for political opinion.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nOh yeah, the feminist/political lyrics, unusual beats and sounds, vivacious care-free women in the 90s kind of vibe, and the excellent guitar and drums all mix together to make this an album which is firmly rooted right up Denny street haha! Love it! Another new discovery for me and it's reminding me of Wet Leg which is a band I'm currently super excited about, maybe they're an inspiration? Deceptacon feels like Deja vu to me, I've definitely heard this tune somewhere but I don't think I've watched any of the stuff in the feature list so I have no idea where I've heard it.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nF me what a blast it was listening to this album. How have I never heard of this band before? So much energy off the hop; loved it from the very first beats of Deceptacon. Simple but wicked beats and a wicked tongue. Very clever lyrics packed into a bunch of catchy 3 minute songs. They combine the melody of Throwing Muses/the Breeders and the anger of L7 (listen to Phanta). No one is spared their glare (eh Cassavetes?) and ahead of their time in calling out Giuliani (on My My Metrocard). Maybe I'm overreacting to how much this album caught me by surprise but it's at least a 4. Going back for a hell of a lot more of these grrrls.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nQuite sparky fun pop rocky album -\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nCool, fun, bouncy, brief, lo-fi smash. Girls with guitars - can’t go wrong.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nGreat opening track, cool fuzz guitars, like the vocal delivery, lots of interesting sounds and noises worked in to the music, but... pretty repetitive, most songs plod along but don't really go anywhere. Happy to listen to the odd track here and there, but can't imagine ever going back for a full album. (2.7)\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nSamples, punk, drum machines, women's lib. A few catchy songs. Reminds me of a poor man's Stereolab at times.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nThe rousing party music of the trio may evoke Sixties' girl-groups, with punchy guitars and dance beats, but in Hannah's mouth it becomes a channel for hard-line feminist ideology. On the surface one hears folk-rock, Motown soul, but each song is a terrible story that leaves deep scars. (6/10) Favourite Track: Deceptacon\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nTar mig näppeligen igenom den första halvan av skivan där Deceptaton är det enda som håller mig kvar underhållningsmässigt. De senare spåren på skivan tonar ner det artsy-tonårsrevolt-skrik-härjandet och stämningen övergår till något mer mellow och suggestivt där Beck-inspirerarde Friendship station och Beastie Boys doftande (utan rappen) Slideshow at Free University sticker ut och får mig att lyssna klart till slutet. Vad tar jag då med mig av de här intensiva 34 min. Jo, att den energidrypande fuck you pekande Deceptacon alltid och då menar jag ALLTID kommer vara ett uppskattat inslag under löppasset eller som den avslutande låten på en lyckad förfest\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nReally not my thing.

Fajna zabawa muzyką, agresywne wokale, liryka zaangażowana politycznie stanowi bardzo miłą przerwę od setnego albumu o miłości.

Har älskat detta album sedan 'Eau D'bedroom Dancing' dök upp i min shuffle, och den låten får fortfarande mig att känna mig som en melankolisk romantisk gymnasieelev. Det är som att riot grrrl-eran under 90-talet ledde fram till detta fulländade album, som har kvar råheten och kaxigheten, blandat med någon sorts glad post-punk. Självklart var sångaren Kathleen Hanna med både i genrens början med Bikini Kill och i dens kulminerande med Le Tigre. Kul att de i 'Hot Topic' sätter sig in i denna historieskrivning genom att lista inspirationskällor i form av andra band och feministiska ikoner. Här finns den stora, roliga hiten i 'Deceptacon', den vänliga och fina 'Les and Ray', det kaxigt punkiga i 'The the Empty', det avantgardistiska och annorlunda i 'Dude Yr so Crazy' och 'Slideshow at Free University'. Den sistnämnda är för övrigt också en favorit, troligtvis tvåa på albumet. Det instrumentella i den låten slår an en sådan sträng hos mig, den går inte att bli av med, den hypnotiserar mig. Fulländat album, tack. Bästa låt: Eau D'bedroom Dancing. Alltid.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nGenuinely good music.

It manages to be upbeat and silly while also being subversive and politically relevant. For example. My Metro Card seems like a silly song about public transportation, but becomes a song about how Rudy Giuliani's policies were affecting New York. The harmonies are great and help make the album feel really dense with music without feeling suffocating. This is one of those albums that you could drop today and it would still feel fresh and relevant 5/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nFun and unique!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nloveeeeeew the ansk\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThat was fun, very cool song writing drawing on every corner of the pop music world, fantastic guitar sounds dropping in and out, some brilliant rolling drumming and great vocal lines. I knew Deceptacon as I was vaguely alive in 1999, but I'd not clocked the rest of this, which is superb. I thought about the sixties white girl groups and then The Slits, et al, all that kind of landed in Le Tigre's lap and they twisted it again to great effect. Dimery was right on this one Michael Chabon fans, well worth a listen as they wheel you into the first day at the nursing home, it will help you kid yourself it is going to be ok...\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nWhat an amazing quirky band. I nearly shut it off after 5 seconds , but it turns out their work is quite varied, intelligent and the screaching is used selectively, thankfully. Interesting lyrics. Varied style. (Mr Elbows can tell me the name for this style as I am ignorant) Turns out I got interested enough to look up their more recent work. How did these guys stay under the radar so long? I guess that's Indy music - you end up getting noticed on a soundtrack selected by people with great taste... Good stuff - quirky, good stuff.

Even if you are one of those insecure machos whose balls shrink at the sound of screaming chick vox, you gotta give props to these musical arrangements. They're SO GOOD. There's so much going on that I just want to listen on repeat and pick it all apart! The lyrics are, by-and-large, fantastic as well.

I don't know that on the left side is, but it seems artistic, plus them being on the right, as if I bought that yellow thing and their faces came along with it. It's punk rock as I've checked so I might not find it as fun as I think, but I'm with an open mind. First song, Oh what a familiar start, I've heard it somewhere. Oh the voice is like Kate Bush almost, but it's more rocky. I think it's a boy singing, so he screamed for a moment. OMG I'VE HEARD THAT INSTRUMENTAL RIFF SOMEWHERE. Ohh the first part got extended now. Outro is quite weird, but I love it. Second song, what a funky start. It's veery chaotic, I love it, I mean there's two voices colliding. He should scream more, it fits the vibe. The guitar is giving. It's getting kind of repetitive, I was more impressed at start. Ohh SO NEVERMIND THIS IS MADONNA'S VOGUE CORED SAYING THE NAMES, WHO INSPIRED THEM, SUCH FUN. Didn't expect this tbh. Third song, talking hmm. It's progressive, but in a different way. I love this so much. It's unique, like not some basic rock, it's the way they sing, and background instruments deliver. What are these dog sounds at the end. 4th song, he is low key screaming here, and barely can hear any words. They love adding a background voice when he's singing. Another chaotic song tbh. This was as well different from what I've heard ever, I mean I have, but Le Tigre just does it better. 5th song, some talking at the start. I don't think it's a boy now, pardon me. She sings less chaotically, but there's this beat that is louder than her. I'm not getting the vibe here. I love that instrument, which is the best part here, but otherwise it's... Umm I'm kinda liking this now that I'm listening to it. It was monotonous too much I'd say. Breaking glass sound at the end. 6th song, Depeche Mode vibes. It's melancholic in a way. Instruments are louder than her, even when she's singing. I'm not impressed, but I love that background sound of that guitar, the one that was at the start. Mother Mother has this vibe, I think. Quite nice, I'm loving this experience so far. 7th song, a much fast paced start. It's definitely a girl singing. It's progressive, there are so many weird sounds here, that makes it much better, rather than basic rock songs as I've said already. The instrumental break was short, but it was giving, now the outro, it's too good. 8th song, Ooo the funkiness here is quite nice. Definitely a bop, the lyrical delivery is just amazing. I'm in love with this artist, they bring these rebel-like songs, which just makes me take a different look at other music. 9th song, I LOVE THE START. It's not going as good as I want it to. This better get more interesting than this, it's too permanent wave rn. Well I guess that's the whole song, well I expected more. The instrumental break is nice, but in the overall sense boring(it was short too so can't really judge it). This is a no for me. 10th song, vibey start. Weird sounds as always. It has a hip hop beat almost. WHO IS THIS MAN. Oh the whole song is that, instrumental then it stops and men talks, which is a sample, but it actually happened, and then instrumental again. Oh they used song when they were presenting a slideshow, makes sense now. I'm weirded out by those glass breaking sounds. 11th song, it's a dramatic sound. Ooo I love this kind of lyrics, just saying things. I LOVE THE MEANING OF THIS, it's them making fun of someone who thinks that things she is saying about him is interesting, but it ain't. This is very rare for me to check the meanings, but this artist is just asking for it. Also she has a bored voice here on purpose, love that. 12th song, quite a different vibe. Mmm I'm not impressed. The chorus isn't chorusing. Though this has a Björk vibe in a way, which I like, but I need more from them now that I've seen their best songs. Oh that was the last song, welll I wanted moreee. Directly gonna say that it was a 5 star album, even though some tracks were not as good, some were too good and unique. I just like things that sound and seem more artistic in a way yk, this has that vibe, so I feel like maximum rating is fair.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThis band is my exact wheelhouse and when I mentioned to my wife I listened to this great band I had never heard-she had heard them! I was very mad. Anyway, even though I've only listened once I already know it would be a 5 someday so I'm cutting to the chase:\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nWow, this is absolute peak 90s indie rock. Very clearly inspired by bands like Sleater Kinney, whom I absolutely love. This album thrives off its simplicity, it's very gritty and underproduced, and they make that sound the whole point of the album, and it sounds great. And of course the strong feminism in the lyrics is always something great to hear.\n\n👍"
