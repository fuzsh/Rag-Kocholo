        "text": "The feminist electro-punk rocker, Jd Samson (a Cleveland native) of Le Tigre, talks of her evolution through music and her new group, MEN.\n\nJd Samson’s music career started when she attended Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers. There, she met her future band members of Le Tigre, and became involved with the growing feminist art scene in New York. She started digging deeper into the culture that engulfed her band's music. Jd began promoting music shows at her college, then like many students, worked at internships around the city. She found herself with several film companies until she finally had the honor to work with her good friend \"Peach\" in the group Peaches. In only a year, Jd mastered the production knowledge of different keyboards, triggers, and drum pads. She sampled electronic sounds and beats and toured with Peaches before deciding to form her group, MEN.\n\nTheir unique electronic sound and attitude is helping them redefine their genre, and stand out in the competitive world of music. All members of the band are \"amazing, self-taught musicians, who don’t care about the ‘correct’ way of playing an instrument,\" Jd explains. Ginger Brooks Takahashi, a visual artist and musician, is described as having radical new approaches to making music and playing instruments. She brings the improvisational philosophy of visual art and translates them into audible sound. Rounding out the group, Michael Oneill, is great at bringing complicated technical aspects to their songs. At times, they also collaborate with artists Emily Roysdon and Johanna Fatemen (Le Tigre) with the musical production. Jd describes that they just ‘play what feels right and fortunately, its exactly what people wanted to hear from them’. They focus on taking electronic music to the limit, while creating incredible music that makes you just want to get up and dance.\n\nSo, why did two feminists name their band MEN? Jd clarified that when she and Johanna Fateman were naming their DJ duo almost a decade ago, Johanna had been living under a life mantra called ‘What would a man do?’ From her point of view, she feels that women in bands or as stand-alone DJ's, deserve to be treated equally to men. Women must act with the same confidence and know that they deserve to be treated well, paid well, and taken seriously.\n\nEach of the band members live the lives that they preach, as artists and activists. What they do is inherently political, artistic, real and self-taught. Jd mentions that she is both confident and proud that she is able to mesh both her political views and artistic vision into her music, so people can appreciate it for more than just entertainment.\n\nJd has traveled the world performing her music. Europe and Australia are always open to new sounds and will support bands with little or no history. Asia is described as a comfortable culture for her, very giving and always sending love. But, more than anything, Jd has great memories returning to her hometown, Cleveland, to perform and spend time with family. Who could forget those \"summer days and cold, cold mornings. I am proud to say that when I return to Cleveland it makes me feel really happy,\" Jd explains.\n\nHer latest collaborative band, MEN, is planning an initial tour on the east coast in June/July, but unfortunately Cleveland is not a stop this time around. Perhaps we can keep our fingers crossed for Pittsburgh and down the road..."
