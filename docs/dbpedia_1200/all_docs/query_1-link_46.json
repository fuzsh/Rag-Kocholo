        "text": "Musician, activist, and drag artist Joey “La Neve” DeFrancesco—perhaps best known as the guitarist and songwriter for the radical Providence, RI, punk band Downtown Boys—also performs house and industrial music as La Neve. Stridently incorporating political ideas into her indefatigable beats and hypnotic riffs, La Neve taps into the indelible dance-oriented legacy of Le Tigre while also embracing the band’s bold stance for the place of queer, trans, and gender nonconforming people in our shared cultural landscape.\n\nPlease note: 18th Avenue west of High Street will be closed March 12–14. Arps Garage will remain open. Click here for details."
