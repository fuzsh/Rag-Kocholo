        "text": "Le Tigre\n\nLe Tigre was a feminist electro post-punk band formed in 1998 by Kathleen Hanna. Initially envisioned as a live back up band for Hanna's solo project Julie Ruin, Le Tigre mixed the politics and feminism of riot grrrl with fun electronic samples and lo-fi beats. Other members included Johanna Fateman and JD Samson. The self proclaimed underground electro-feminist performance artists combined visuals, music and dance into their performances, until their eventual disbandment in 2011."
