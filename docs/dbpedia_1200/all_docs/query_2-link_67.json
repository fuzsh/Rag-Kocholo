        "text": "Le Tigre are back, and touring for the first time in 18 years.\n\nThe electroclash pioneers - made up of Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman and JD Samson - fuse fiery feminist lyrics with lo-fi beats and punk guitars. Le Tigre formed in the latter years of the 90's, where Hanna was already established as the poster girl of the riot grrl revolution, having fronted seminal band Bikini Kill.\n\nAfter a short time working under the name Julie Ruin, she recruited JD and Johanna to complete the iconic trio and release their incendiary eponymously titled debut LP, unleashing such feracious anthems as \"Decepticon\", \"Hot Topic\" and \"My My Metrocard\" on the world!\n\nThe following years would see them grow from outsider upstarts to mainstream infiltrators, dropping second album Feminist Sweepstakes in 2001, then third record This Island three years later.\n\nWhere can I find out more about Le Tigre?\n\nYou can find out all the latest news and information about Le Tigre by following them on social media, or browsing their official website.\n\nFacebook\n\nX\n\nInstagram\n\nOfficial Website\n\nOfficial Merchandise\n\nHow can I stay up to date with the latest Le Tigre gigs & tours?\n\nBe the first to know and stay up to date with all the latest gigs and tours going on sale with Gigantic Tickets by signing up to our newsletter and following us on social media:\n\nFacebook\n\nX\n\nInstagram\n\nNewsletter\n\nWho are Gigantic Tickets?\n\nWe’ve sold over 10 million tickets to more than two million happy customers: Gigantic Tickets is one of the UK's largest independent ticket agencies.\n\nSince 2007, we’ve worked with many of the UK's biggest concert promoters, major festivals and iconic venues.\n\nPlus, we're full members of STAR, the UK's leading self-regulatory body for the entertainment ticketing industry.\n\nAs a regulated and reputable ticket seller, you can trust us to sell tickets at face value for all of your favourite events, safe in the knowledge that our dedicated customer service team are available to help you with any queries you may have.\n\nLike you, we live for the moments that only live events can create, so grab a ticket today and see you down the front!"
