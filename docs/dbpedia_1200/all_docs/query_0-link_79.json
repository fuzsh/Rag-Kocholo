        "text": "The New York--Based Trio Sounds More Polished And Downright Danceable On This Island\n\nAs a lesbian who came of age in the American Midwest, JD Samson can relate to Le Tigre fans who might feel disenfranchised. \"It seems that in more conservative towns kids need an outlet, maybe because there are no freaks in the town like them or something,\" says the 25-year-old keyboardist, on the phone from a Chicago tour stop. \"So people contact us wanting us to come to their town to create a space for their community to hang out. It seems like way more people are coming out in smaller towns than ever before and in conservative places like Pittsburgh and Cleveland and Detroit.\"\n\nIn its half-decade of noisy existence, Le Tigre has built up a passionate and devoted following. The self-described \"feminist punk electronic\" band's outspoken politics and gay-positive lyrics have made it a rallying point for its fans, especially young feminists and emerging lesbians, two groups whose voices are rarely heard beyond the pop underground.\n\nThis Island, Le Tigre's riotously danceable third disc, marks the fiercely DIY band's first real attempt to reach a bigger audience. But the move from an indie label to Universal subsidiary Strummer doesn't seem to have upset those loyal to the New York outfit's cause. \"Some people have asked why we did it and what the benefits are,\" Samson says. \"But in all I think people are kind of just interested in supporting us in whatever's going to be best for us.\"\n\nThat includes briefly working with former Cars frontman Ric Ocasek, whom the band members brought in to help them get in touch with their more accessible side.\n\n\"I think we weren't as clear ourselves that was what we wanted to do until this record was getting written and we realized the songs were so poppy,\" Samson says. \"We got really excited about digging deeper into pop structure and the whole pop element. We did so much research by listening to all kinds of different bands and songs, like our favourite ballads and hip-hop tunes. It was interesting to study that way because we'd never done that kind of work before.\"\n\nOcasek was instrumental to the band's approach, even though only one tune produced by the pop wizard--a slinky, after-hours rush of a song called \"Tell You Now\"--made it onto the record.\n\n\"We just didn't finish the others,\" Samson explains. \"We only spent one week in the studio with him and tried to get three songs done but only finished that one. I think it turned out great, though. And in reality he did have a lot to do with the record because we learned a lot from him during preproduction in terms of little tricks of pop-music structure. In the end those are the kinds of lessons that are really worthwhile.\"\n\nLe Tigre might sound more polished than ever on This Island, but the group hasn't lost its abrasive side. For every stab of post-wave synth there's an offsetting blast of microchip-generated distortion. Adding to the edginess is a drum machine that seems set for maximum overdrive. \"TKO\" finds lead singer Kathleen Hanna, who helped jump-start the whole '90s riot-grrrl movement with her band Bikini Kill, still capable of letting out a wail that could freeze a mosh pit. Le Tigre hasn't toned down its political leanings; the disc's first single, \"New Kicks\", is an in-your-face protest song built around a vicious drum loop, a chant of \"Peace now!\", and excerpts from speeches by anti-war activists Susan Sarandon, Al Sharpton, and Ron Kovac. And the band bares its teeth on \"Seconds\", a two-minute screed attacking George W. Bush.\n\nBy mixing such uncompromising efforts with more accessible dance-pop (including a pointless cover of the Pointer Sisters' \"I'm So Excited\"), the trio isn't about to do anything that might alienate long-time fans. Le Tigre followers who've rallied around past efforts like the subway celebration \"My My Metrocard\" and the uplifting \"Keep on Livin' \" (from previous records Le Tigre and Feminist Sweepstakes, respectively) will find much to love about the new album. More importantly, perhaps, is the current tour, which offers something more than a standard rock show. Costumes, choreographed routines, and videos are all part of an experience that celebrates diversity and the power of the band's life-affirming music. Leave your prejudices at home, but bring your dancing shoes, because Le Tigre is in the house."
