I'm Terry Gross.\n\nNoisy guitar bands are often thought of as a boy thing, but not always. For\n\nexample, there was the riot-grrrl movement that started in the early '90s;\n\ngirl bands with a punk sensibility and a feminist attitude. My two guests\n\nwere important members of that movement. Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman\n\nare now members of the band Le Tigre. In the days when Hanna fronted the\n\nband\n\nBikini Kill, she was considered one of the founders of the riot-grrrl\n\nmovement. The movement spread through 'zines as well as music. Johanna\n\nFateman writes 'zines about music, art and culture.\n\nHanna does most of the singing in Le Tigre. Fateman plays keyboards and\n\ndoes\n\nsome of the sampling. They both play guitar. The band begins a new tour\n\nlater this month. From their recent CD \"Le Tigre,\" here's a song called\n\n\"What's Yr Take on Cassavetes?\"\n\n(Soundbite from \"What's Yr Take on Cassavetes?\")\n\n(Soundbite of birds, guitar)\n\nMs. KATHLEEN HANNA (Le Tigre): We talked about it in letters, and we talked\n\nabout it on the phone. But how you really about it, I don't really know.\n\n(Soundbite of synthesizer)\n\nMs. JOHANNA FATEMAN and Ms. HANNA: (Singing, in unison) What's your take on\n\nCassavetes? What's your take on Cassavetes? What's your take on\n\nCassavetes?\n\nWhat's your take on Cassavetes?\n\nMs. HANNA: Misogynist.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Genius.\n\nMs. HANNA: Misogynist.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Genius.\n\nMs. HANNA: Misogynist.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Genius.\n\nMs. HANNA: Misogynist.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Genius.\n\nMs. FATEMAN and Ms. HANNA: (Singing, in unison) What's your take on\n\nCassavetes? What's your take on Cassavetes?\n\nGROSS: Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start\n\nwith \"What's Yr Take on Cassavetes?\" Why don't you tell us how this song\n\ncame about, particularly the lyric?\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Hi, this is Johanna. Well, with \"What's Yr Take on\n\nCassavetes?,\" it was kind of a series of incidents or coincidences that led\n\nto\n\nthis song. I work at an art gallery, and there was a group show of visual\n\nartists sort of grouped together based on the filmmaking practices of\n\nCassavetes. And so I was reading all the stuff about Cassavetes. And,\n\nmeanwhile, Kathleen and Sadie--well, you should tell his part, Kathleen.\n\nMs. HANNA: This is Kathleen. Sadie and I happen to hook up in Paris,\n\nFrance.\n\nIt was very glamorous. And we wanted to go see a movie, and what was\n\nplaying\n\nbut \"Husbands\" by Cassavetes. And we went to see it and we just had, like,\n\nall these conservations about, you know, `Is the misogyny in this movie\n\ncalling attention to, sort of, like, white middle-class men's, like,\n\nspiritual\n\nvacancy, and stuff like that? Or is it just being a part of it?' Because\n\nwe\n\nboth felt really gross after the movie, but we also loved it in this weird\n\nway. And when we started talking about how many different kinds of art and\n\nmusic we feel that way about, that it's, like, they're something really icky\n\nabout it, but we still are attracted to it. And how can you constantly be\n\nnegotiating that in your mind about everything as a feminist. And so we\n\nstarted writing that song.\n\nAnd then, we also want to bring up the point of me, Sadie and Johanna's sort\n\nof intellectual friendships with each other. Because at the beginning of\n\nthe\n\nsong, there's, like, a girl in a telephone booth. You can hear sea gulls\n\nand\n\nstuff like that in the background. And we've kind of set it up to be a\n\ntypical, you know, Shangri-La type thing, where, you know, one girl's\n\ncalling\n\nanother, you know, and being, like, `Oh, I love that man so much. I'm going\n\nto die without him,' or whatever. And then it's really one woman calling\n\nanother being, like, `What do you think about Cassavetes? I really need to\n\nknow.'\n\nGROSS: Well, I think it's really ambitious to write a song about your\n\nambivalent feelings about a film director, your ambivalent feelings about\n\ncertain art. It's hard to write a song about that.\n\nMs. HANNA: Not for us. That's what we talk about all the time.\n\nGROSS: Well, it's certainly not typical to write a song about that.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: I think that's part of what we wanted to do with the song, was\n\nto overturn that expectation that it was going to be about typical pop song\n\nfare of, you know, love relationships or whatever, having a good time at a\n\nparty or what--I don't know, whatever common themes are. So we wanted to\n\naddress this idea of, like, what's a critique and what's a participation.\n\nGROSS: Kathleen, you're considered one of the originators of riot-grrrl\n\nmusic. I think most artists really hate labels. So let's start with--are\n\nyou\n\ncomfortable with that expression?\n\nMs. HANNA: I'm definitely comfortable with being labeled a `feminist\n\nartist.' Like, I kind of hate the fact that everybody's so freaked out\n\nabout\n\nbeing labeled. I'm sick of reading it in everybody's interviews. You know,\n\nevery single interview is, like, `Don't put me in a box. I don't want to be\n\nlabeled.' And it's--like, I'm really happy when I see people who are, like,\n\n`I'm a lesbian, and I'm really proud of it.' You know what I mean? And,\n\nlike, `Go ahead, label me, because that's something that, like, gives other\n\npeople pride and gives other people a feeling of inclusion.' So in terms\n\nof,\n\nlike, feminism I'm definitely down to say I'm a feminist. Riot-grrrl is a\n\nspecific branch of feminism, but I wouldn't call myself a riot-grrrl just\n\n'cause I don't go to meetings anymore.\n\nGROSS: What was it when you were involved with it, and what was its meaning\n\nfor you?\n\nMs. HANNA: It was sort of, like, you know, '70s feminist art groups a lot,\n\nwith a certain, like, outreach element of, like, you know, doing actions\n\nlike\n\nbeing involved in protests and stuff like that, and planning benefit shows\n\nfor, like, rape crisis shelters, helping out individual women in the sort of\n\npunk music scene, skill sharing, stuff like that. It was really--it meant a\n\nlot to me. I mean, it was a really exciting time when it started in DC just\n\nto be a part of these meetings and see these girls who had never been in a\n\nroom only with women before, you know, saying things that maybe they'd never\n\nsaid and saying things, certainly, that I'd never said to anyone.\n\nGROSS: What would you say has been the impact of that kind of feminism on\n\nyour music? And do you think it's fair to describe your music as a\n\ncombination of, say, punk and feminism?\n\nMs. FATEMAN: I think that's definitely part of it, and certainly, like, the\n\nmost, kind of--I don't know, the most easily identifiable aspects of it are.\n\nBut I think that punk and feminism are more words that apply to, kind of,\n\nour\n\nhistory and, like, what our references are in our music rather than what\n\nwe're\n\nactually doing right now. I mean, we're certainly still feminists, but I\n\nthink that we're not so much interested in staying within a confined set of\n\naesthetics that, you know, the idea of punk might imply.\n\nGROSS: Well, I'm wondering if, you know, having started out with riot-grrrl\n\nmusic, if you felt that some of that music was appropriated by mainstream\n\ngroups and by mainstream pop culture, say groups like the Spice Girls or TV\n\nshows like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nMs. HANNA: I don't think the music was ever appropriated, because probably\n\nto\n\nmainstream listeners, it's just too confrontational and unlistenable and has\n\ntoo many cuss words in it. But it definitely--I think certain people who\n\nare\n\ninterested in graphs and charts and marketing saw that bands like Bikini\n\nKill\n\nand Bratmobile and now Sleater-Kinney were making, you know, a living on\n\nsmall independent labels with absolutely, like, no advertising money, you\n\nknow. And, like, if we're able to do that, they were like, `What if we put\n\na\n\nwhole bunch of money behind something that sort of takes the content out of\n\nit, takes the abrasiveness out of it and, yet, has this sort of, you know,\n\n\"girl power\" message, or whatever, and put that into the world? We could\n\nmake\n\na lot of money.'\n\nAnd, you know, whatever. All the `Girls Rules' T-shirts started happening,\n\nand we--a lot of riot-grrrls used to write stuff on themselves, you know,\n\nlike, names that were, like, derogatory towards women, like on our arms or\n\non\n\nour stomachs if we wearing a short top, sort of as a commentary.\n\nGROSS: Like `slut.' Like you had `slut' on your stomach.\n\nMs. HANNA: Yeah, like, stuff like that. And it was sort of--part of the\n\noriginal reason was when I started being photographed, I felt like I was\n\nsilenced by the photograph. You know what I mean? Like, I would get my\n\npicture taken and they could write absolutely anything over it, under it,\n\nwhatever. And now it's kind of depressing because I'm, like, `Oh, I was\n\nbeating people to the punch.' You know what I mean? Like, `Oh, that's what\n\nmen are going to think if they see me, and so I'm going to beat them to the\n\npunch by writing this and say, \"I know you're thinking that,\"' which I think\n\nwas interesting for a minute, but I'm not kind of interested in that thing\n\nanymore.\n\nBut the basic point is that then they start having T-shirts that said\n\n`slut.'\n\nAnd who are the people who own these companies? Probably men--Do you know\n\nwhat I mean?--who are making money off of this, like, now pseudorebellion\n\nand\n\nwhatever. I just find it annoying and boring, and I don't spend a lot of\n\ntime\n\nthinking about it. I just kind of keep working. And if there are, like,\n\nfive-year-old girls who get sort of a feminist type vibe off of the Spice\n\nGirl's girl power, great, you know.\n\nGROSS: Do you think that the more commercial end of girl power also gave\n\nthe\n\nmessage of, `And if you are really beautiful, really attractive and dress\n\nreally well, you can be a part of girl power, too'?\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Yeah, I mean, definitely, I think so. But I also do think\n\nthat\n\nit's important not to be entirely cynical about the way that riot-grrrl\n\naesthetics have entered the mainstream because, like Kathleen pointed out,\n\nit\n\nis for a much younger audience, generally. I mean, the Spice Girls really\n\nis\n\nfor girls who are too young to do their own record shopping at an\n\nindependent\n\nrecord store or who are probably too young to hear some of the content that\n\nwas in a band like Bikini Kill. Or--you know, it's like--it's kind of\n\napples\n\nand oranges at this point. Do you know what I mean? It's--I don't know.\n\nMs. HANNA: The music definitely doesn't sound anything like anybody I know\n\nwho's ever making.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: I wonder if there are certain types of lyrics or performance styles\n\nin\n\npop music now that disturb you.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Yes.\n\nMs. HANNA: Yeah, we actually try to shy away from this kind of question\n\nbecause we don't want to give those people any press. Because a lot of the\n\njerky guys--and everyone listening knows who they are--you know, who write,\n\nlike, really, you know, sexist lyrics and stuff and who just come off like\n\ntotal unsophisticated cavemen, it's like they don't even deserve our\n\nattention.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Yeah. And it's part of their fantasy that they would be\n\ngaining our attention and making us angry when really we're just not...\n\nMs. HANNA: We don't care. We're bored.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: We're just not engaging with that part of culture.\n\nMs. HANNA: I'm just, like, `Yawn.'\n\nGROSS: My guests are Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman of the band Le\n\nTigre.\n\nWe'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guests are Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman of the band Le\n\nTigre.\n\nI think for some girls growing up--this might not be true in every era--it\n\nseemed more probable that you'd be the girlfriend of the guy in the band\n\nthan--that you'd be a girl with your own band. What were your thoughts\n\nabout\n\nthat? Did you think if you loved pop music, that you could have a band of\n\nyour own, or did you think that you'd be, like, the girlfriend of?\n\nMs. HANNA: Well, I was the girlfriend of until I decided to stop doing\n\nthat,\n\nyou know. I feel like I would have probably been in a band starting at age\n\n12\n\nor 13 if I would have thought that it was a possibility, but I just didn't,\n\nyou know. When me and my friend Maureen Gaines(ph) took guitar after school\n\nin grade school in, like, fifth grade, we were the only two girls, and we\n\ngot,\n\nlike, laughed out of the class. We were, like, so humiliated that we just\n\nstopped going.\n\nGROSS: What were you humiliated for?\n\nMs. HANNA: Well--like, we would practice extra hard because every time when\n\nwe went in, like, the guys would just make fun of us constantly and treat us\n\nlike we were playing it wrong. And I remember it making me feel really\n\ncrazy,\n\nlike, I just couldn't do it right no matter what I did, and there was\n\nsomething, like, genetically wrong with me that made it so that I couldn't\n\nplay, you know.\n\nAnd then the whole thing as I got older was, like, I was always hanging out\n\nwith guys in bands. I was always, like, making stickers for their bands,\n\nmaking T-shirts for their bands, like, helping them set up shows, like\n\nbringing people to their shows and, like, going to their practices and\n\nhoping\n\nthat somebody would ask me to sing. And then eventually I was like, `I\n\ncan't\n\nwait anymore for somebody to ask me. Like, I just have to do this because\n\nit's what I really want to do.' But I mean, I was relatively young. I was,\n\nlike, 19 when I was in my first band. But I really do feel like I would\n\nhave\n\nstarted a lot earlier if there would have been, you know, more\n\nencouragement.\n\nGROSS: Johanna, what about you?\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Before I really knew other women in punk bands, I didn't think\n\nthat that was a possibility for me. I mean, I--as much as I loved, like,\n\nyou\n\nknow, say, Cyndi Lauper or whoever, I don't think that I could relate to her\n\nin a realistic way, like, I didn't see myself having a life like hers. So,\n\nI\n\nmean, I grew up in Berkeley, California, and there were some women in punk\n\nbands, and I kind of looked to them. And it was, like, `Wow, they're\n\ntotally\n\nnormal people like me. I could do that, too, if I wanted to.' So I think\n\nit\n\ntook kind of knowing other women in bands for me to feel that way, that I\n\ncould do it.\n\nMs. HANNA: Well, that's part of the beauty of punk, you know, is that--it's\n\nlike you go to the same coffee shops as people. Like, a lot of people in\n\npunk\n\nrock or in bands are also setting up shows and working the door and, like,\n\ndoing all facets. And it's not just, like--there's not the same kind of\n\nstar\n\nsystem, although there are people who are better known because they've been\n\nin\n\nthe scene for longer and stuff like that. And there--you know, that whole,\n\nlike, excitement about being famous or whatever is just about everywhere,\n\nand\n\nyou can't really escape it. There is, like, a sort of feeling of being,\n\nlike,\n\n`Oh, I could do that because that person is doing it and they don't have a\n\nmillion dollars or, like, a huge label behind them.'\n\nGROSS: Kathleen, having been embarrassed when you were taking guitar\n\nlessons\n\nand made to think that you just would never get it right, you weren't good\n\nenough, how did you overcome that when you started performing?\n\nMs. HANNA: Well, I didn't play guitar, for one, until now at age 31, and\n\nI'm\n\njust starting to play in Le Tigre. And I don't know how I got over it. I\n\nmean, I'm sure a lot of times in Bikini Kill, a false sense of bravado\n\nreally\n\nwent a long way for me. I just acted confident and pretended I knew exactly\n\nwhat I was doing, you know, and kept going because I love the spotlight. I\n\nlove attention. I love singing and having everybody listen to me. It felt\n\nreally good.\n\nGROSS: Now, Kathleen, I read--and you can tell me if this is true--that\n\nwhen\n\nyou were in school, you starred in a production of \"Annie.\"\n\nMs. HANNA: Yes, that is true. I was Annie. They couldn't--my school\n\ncouldn't really afford props and sets and stuff, and they also had to have\n\nsomething with a male lead to be fairer, I guess. So it was sort of a\n\ncombination of \"Annie\" and \"Oliver.\" I don't know how they did it. And\n\nthen\n\nit was, like, I had a stuffed dog instead of real dog for Sandy. It was\n\nreally bad.\n\nGROSS: So did you have to sing \"The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow\"?\n\nMs. HANNA: I sure did.\n\nGROSS: Now that's a really different kind of singing than the singing\n\nyou're\n\ndoing on your records now.\n\nMs. HANNA: Not really. I mean, the thing that's interesting is when I\n\nfirst\n\nstarted out, or whatever, everybody said I sounded like Polystyrene from\n\nX-Ray\n\nSpecs. And I had never heard her. And then I listened to X-Ray Specs, and\n\nI\n\nwas like, `Oh, it's because we both project.' Like--and I learned that\n\nfrom,\n\nlike, my many years of children's theater. And I always wondered if Polly\n\nhad\n\nalso done a little, you know, \"Annie.\"\n\nGROSS: A little theater in her day?\n\nMs. HANNA: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: See, I thought you meant when you started singing in \"Annie,\" people\n\nsaid that you sounded like Polystyrene. I thought that was pretty funny.\n\nMs. HANNA: Oh, I wish.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. I'm going to play something, Kathleen, that you did with the\n\nband Bikini Kill early in your music career. And this is called \"Rebel\n\nGirl,\" and it's considered, like, one of the anthems of riot-grrrl music.\n\nAnd tell us something about writing this song.\n\nMs. HANNA: Well, I lived in DC at the time, and there was just a lot of\n\nexcitement 'cause women's groups were starting and there were a lot of bands\n\nthere. And--I don't know. At that point, I didn't feel like I had to write\n\nsongs. I just felt like I had to reach up into the air and grab them. And\n\nthis was one of the ones I sort of reached up into the air and grabbed. It\n\nwas, like, a scene of people wrote it. I didn't really write it. I just\n\nwas\n\nthe person who actually put the pen to the paper.\n\nGROSS: OK. This is \"Rebel Girl,\" Bikini Kill, featuring my guest, Kathleen\n\nHanna.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMs. HANNA: That girl thinks she's the queen of the neighborhood. She's got\n\nthe hottest Jag in town. That girl, she holds her head up so high. I think\n\nI\n\nwant to be her best friend. Yeah!\n\nRebel girl, rebel girl. Rebel girl, you are the queen of my world. Rebel\n\ngirl, rebel girl. I think I want to take you on, I wanna try a new\n\napproach.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMs. HANNA: When she talks, I hear the revolution. In her head, there's\n\nrevolution. When she walks, the revolution's coming. In a (unintelligible)\n\nwhat is the revolution?\n\nRebel girl, rebel girl. Rebel girl, you are the queen of my world.\n\nGROSS: That's \"Rebel Girl,\" from the band Bikini Kill, that my guest\n\nKathleen\n\nHanna used to be in. And Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman are my guests.\n\nTheir new band is called Le Tigre.\n\n\"Rebel Girl\" is a very low-fi kind of record. And I'm wondering if you want\n\nto keep the low-fi sound or if you want to get more kind of technically--if\n\nyou want to get better technical audio quality on your recordings now?\n\nMs. HANNA: Yeah. I mean, I think we always wanted that. It was--it's not\n\naesthetic as much as it's been a money limitation. You know--I mean, like,\n\nthe first Bikini Kill album was done on a four-track--well, it's actually\n\nhalf\n\nof an album. But it was done on a four-track for $17. So, you know, we\n\njust\n\ndidn't have any money. And even with the albums--I remember spending a\n\nthousand dollars and, like, working for a week or something and being really\n\nfreaked out about how expensive it was. And now I'm finding out about the\n\nbudgets that regular bands have. And I'm kind of, like, `Wow,' you know.\n\nAnd we still with Le Tigre try to keep the costs down and also keep the\n\ncontrol in our own hands by recording a lot of our initial tracks ourselves\n\nand doing a lot of preproduction and production in the studio, because we're\n\nreally interested in, like--we're interested in taking over everything. No,\n\nwe want to--I don't want some, you know, guy who's behind the mixing board,\n\nor whatever, like, deciding what our sound is for us, you know. We want to\n\nknow as much as possible...\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Yeah.\n\nMs. HANNA: ...so that we can explain our ideas and, in some cases, make our\n\nideas happen all on our own.\n\nGROSS: Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman of the band Le Tigre will be back\n\nin the second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite from song)\n\nMs. HANNA: I take you home now. Let me get you hot. You're just a parrot\n\nwhen you're screaming and you're shouting, `More crackers, please. More\n\ncrackers, please.' You are what you are, but you don't want to be. I know\n\nI\n\nneed new duds or who does your hair.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMs. HANNA: Who took the bop in the bop-a-lomp-a-lomp? Who took the rams in\n\nthe rama-lama-ding-dong? Who took the bop in the bop-a-lomp-a-lomp? Who\n\ntook\n\nthe ram in the rama-lama-ding-dong?\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: This is NPR, National Public Radio.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: Coming up, we continue our conversation with Kathleen Hanna and\n\nJohanna Fateman of the band Le Tigre. Also, Maureen Corrigan reviews Bonnie\n\nBurnard's first novel. And our classical music critic Lloyd Schwartz reads\n\na\n\npoem from his new book.\n\n(Soundbite from song)\n\nMs. HANNA: Phone keeps ringing, and it just got ...(unintelligible).\n\nThere's a payment ...(unintelligible) if I call too far. People take it out\n\non me, let them write. My head feels heavy, but my feet feel light.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMs. HANNA: The clock keeps ticking inside my head. Bad news is all I ever\n\nget. The check is in the mail, but not on time. Everyone around me wants\n\nto\n\nstart another fight.\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nBack with Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman of the band Le Tigre.

I'm listening anyway.\n\nUnidentified Woman #1: (Singing) Tap, tap, it's just the way that we rhyme.\n\nTap, tap, it's just the way that we rhyme. Tap, tap, it's just the way that\n\nwe rhyme.

Gretchen and Phyllis achieve our motto ...(unintelligible).\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: Music from the CD \"Le Tigre.\" Singer and guitarist Kathleen Hanna\n\nused to front the band Bikini Kill, one of the '90s riot girl bands that\n\ncombined a punk sensibility with a feminist attitude. Johanna Fateman of Le\n\nTigre writes zines as well as playing music. When she started writing zines\n\nin high school, she didn't think of herself as a riot girl, although her\n\nsubject matter was influenced by the movement and some of her zines were\n\nlater\n\ndistributed by the Riot Grrrl Press. I asked what she wrote about in her\n\nearly zines.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: I guess feminism. I mean, it was sort of more poetic and\n\nabstract than, like, necessarily sort of just political ideas. But it was\n\ndefinitely about sexism and growing up and being in high school and being a\n\nteen-ager and feeling extremely alienated and sort of discovering punk music\n\nand punk aesthetics and finding a way to rebel and be part of something\n\ndifferent than what I saw the majority of my classmates or, you know...\n\nMs. HANNA: But at the same time, it's like you're a really theoretical\n\nwriter. I mean, like, Jo's fanzines aren't like zine reports and, like,\n\npictures of people in bands, like...\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Right.\n\nMs. HANNA: They're, like, based in, like, theory and stuff, and the way\n\nthat\n\nshe writes is really challenging, and I think it's important to note that,\n\nlike, in the Riot Grrrl zine, like, there wasn't just, like, new kinds of\n\nnew\n\nmusic being created. There was also new forms of writing, new ways of\n\nwriting. Like, one of the things in Snarla(ph), which was one of Jo's early\n\nfanzines that she did, was she had these conversations with different parts\n\nof\n\nherself. Were you the one who wrote that stuff?\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nMs. HANNA: Like, she would have, like, you know, conversation with my\n\ninsomnia or (technical difficulties) other ones?\n\nMs. FATEMAN: I think I had a conversation with my migraine, because I had\n\nmigraine headaches. Or what else was there? There was stuff like that.\n\nThere was stuff like--yeah, it wasn't zine reports and pictures of bands.\n\nEven though I went to those shows, that wasn't really what I was interested\n\nin\n\nwriting about. And there was definitely other girls working on projects in\n\nthat same vein of kind of visual art or literary things that functioned as,\n\nlike, adjacent material to the music that weren't about the music.\n\nGROSS: You both talked about the importance of feminism in your life and in\n\nyour music. How were you exposed to that? And I'm wondering if your\n\nmothers\n\nwere feminists.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: My mom's a feminist, definitely. I mean, I grew up in\n\nBerkeley,\n\nCalifornia, which, you know, is a university town and sort of famous for\n\nbeing\n\na place where, you know, radical politics are and are talked about. So I\n\nfeel\n\nlike I was exposed to radical ideas when I was really young.\n\nGROSS: And Kathleen?\n\nMs. HANNA: I grew up in suburbia--in various suburbias. My family moved a\n\nlot. We moved every, like, three years. My dad worked for the union, for\n\nLocal 669, pipe fitters and welders. And my mom has always been a nurse at\n\nvarious, like, mental health facilities, but wherever we lived, we usually,\n\nlike, you know, lived in town houses or something in the suburbs. And my\n\nmom\n\nwas kind of, like, a secret feminist. Like, she didn't really--you know, it\n\nwasn't like we have, like, any Bohemian friends or--you know what I mean?\n\nLike, pretty much the books in our house were, like, romance novels and\n\ndetective novels. But my mom worked in this sort of, like, clandestine\n\ndomestic violence shelter, and I didn't remember this until a couple of\n\nyears\n\nago. I just remember her kind of sneaking out of the house to this--I think\n\nit was, like, an Episcopal church that had a, you know, crisis phone line\n\nthing in the basement, and she would go there every so often and do that.\n\nAnd she got Ms. magazine, and she took me to Solidarity Day in DC when I\n\nwas,\n\nlike--I don't know--10 or something, and we saw Bella Abzug speak, and we,\n\nlike, hung out in the feminist group or, like, the feminist groups that were\n\nthere, because people were still interested in, like, you know, ratifying\n\nthe\n\nERA. And all these women were wearing, like, T-shirts that said, you know,\n\n`A\n\nwoman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle' and stuff like that and\n\nyelling\n\nstuff, and I was just caught up in the total frenzy of it, as, like, a\n\nlittle\n\nkid being like, `Look at all these women,' and it was like the outside\n\nworld,\n\nyou know. And the fact that there were all these women banding together\n\nand,\n\nlike, yelling stuff, it just really had an impression on me, and hearing\n\nBella\n\nAbzug speak was like--I couldn't believe it, you know, but that was the only\n\nthing like that that ever happened.\n\nGROSS: A lot of girls, when they're preteens, go through this phase\n\nof--it's\n\nthe `Oh, he's so cute' phase, where, like, you listen to music and you're\n\nsupposed to have, you know, `Oh, he's so cute' fantasies about the guys who\n\nyou're listening to and so on. And I'm wondering if you ever related to\n\nmusic\n\nthat way. For example, now, you know, like, if you see clips of, say, an 'N\n\nSync concert, it's almost all preteen girls in the audience, and they're\n\nkind\n\nof screaming and, you know, obviously having all these really important\n\nfantasies to them about the guys who are in the band. Did you relate to\n\nmusic\n\nthat way at all when you were 11, 12, 10?\n\nMs. FATEMAN: I was, like, six or something, I was really into Donny Osmond.\n\nThat was my first concert. And I went and I screamed myself totally hoarse.\n\nBut, you know, I think I really wanted to be Donny. That was the real issue\n\ngoing on. I wasn't like--and, I mean, I actually wrote more love letters to\n\nMarie than I ever did to Donny, because I was really kind of obsessed with\n\nher, but I felt like it was more acceptable to channel my, you know, fake\n\nlove\n\nenergy into Donny. But I was also really into Tony DeFranco and the\n\nDeFranco\n\nFamily and would imitate his singing style, along with the records. So it's\n\nkind of interesting because I learned how to sing from a boy who was trying\n\nto\n\nsing like a girl, you know, like, sort of how Ronnie Specter learned from\n\nFrankie Lymon.\n\nGROSS: My guests are Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman of the band Le\n\nTigre.\n\nWe'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guests are Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman of the band Le\n\nTigre.\n\nDo you think about the impact of your music and your presence on stage might\n\nhave for your youngest fans, what it might mean in their lives?\n\nMs. HANNA: I thought about it once in Italy with Bikini Kill and there were\n\nthese, like, seven-year-old girls sitting by the monitors. I just thought,\n\n`Oh, they're going to be in therapy when they're, like, 35,' `And there's\n\nthis\n\ngirl and her face is all red and she was screaming these crazy things, and\n\npeople were saying she's a man-hater and I don't know. Is it a dream,\n\nDoctor?' But I just think I would really like to have been young and gone\n\nto\n\na concert and seen Jo on stage singing and playing keyboards, and I would\n\nreally like to go to a concert when I was younger and see me in all my\n\nbeauty\n\nand sexual glory and fabulous singing style on stage. So I get really happy\n\nabout it. You know, I think that people are pretty incredible and that they\n\ndon't really need me to become amazing people, but if I'm someone there who\n\nreminds them that they're really cool, then that's great.\n\nGROSS: I'm glad you mentioned your sexual glory. What kind of sexual\n\nenergy\n\ndo you want to communicate on stage? Because that's often a really\n\nimportant\n\npart of pop music and of concerts.\n\nMs. HANNA: I'm just, like, a really sexually powerful person in general.\n\nMaybe that's a, you know, bragging thing to say, but it's like, I get what I\n\nwant, and I have a good time, and it's like I really get annoyed--well, I\n\ngot\n\nannoyed in Bikini Kill when it was like--it was never women that said this\n\nstuff. It was always guys who were like, you know, `Well, how can you be a\n\nfeminist? Because, like, you're sexy,' and it's like, I'm sexy when I'm\n\neating a veggie burger, you know what I mean? So, like, what am I going to\n\ndo? Like, just turn it off? Am I being really funny, Jo? I have to brag.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: No, it's fine. I mean, it's never gone down this road in an\n\ninterview before.\n\nMs. HANNA: You haven't been in some of the interviews where I've gone down\n\nthis road.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: I guess not.\n\nMs. HANNA: No, but, I mean, I think it's like we're all, like, totally\n\nsexual\n\nbeings and it's like, I really hate the idea that if you're a feminist or\n\nsomething, you're supposed to shut that off, because people see that as\n\nantithetical to your politics or something, and that's ridiculous.\n\nGROSS: Now I want to ask you about another song on the new CD, and this is\n\ncalled \"Les & Ray,\" and the lyric is about two guys who live next door who\n\nplay rock music and inspire you to be in a band yourself. Who wrote the\n\nsong?\n\nMs. HANNA: I did. That would be me, Kathleen, the sexy one.\n\nGROSS: And, Kathleen, is this based on two guys named Les and Ray who\n\nreally\n\nlived next door?\n\nMs. HANNA: Yeah. That was from when I lived in Laurel, Maryland, and they\n\nactually didn't play rock music. They played show tunes, as I recall, and\n\nshow tune medleys, which I'm very fond of. And--I don't know. Like a lot\n\nof\n\nkids, I grew up really scared. But a lot of times, there was, you know,\n\nviolence around me. And I sometimes would, like, fantasize about Les and\n\nRay,\n\nlike, you know, hanging out with them or whatever because they seemed really\n\nin love. And one time Les took me to the mall to buy a present for my\n\nfriend,\n\nand we had a really good time, and I didn't feel like he was going to put me\n\ndown or be mean to me or, like, scare me, which my mother never did, but\n\nsomeone else in my life who shall remain nameless did.\n\nAnd I remember just thinking if anything really seriously messed up happened\n\nin my house that they would hear through the wall and that they would come\n\nget\n\nme. And so I wanted to write something for them, and a lot of times when we\n\nplay live, I'll talk about it and talk about how, you know, the idea of\n\nbeing\n\npolitical, a lot of people think, oh, you have to, you know, be a part of an\n\norganization, which I think is really important and that we should be part\n\nof\n\norganizations. But there's other ways that people who don't have time or\n\nwhatever to do that can be really helpful in the world, and one of them is\n\nto\n\nbe that person for kids, you know, like, the person who believes them. You\n\nknow what I'm saying?\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Kathleen, are you talking about, like, sexual abuse at home\n\nor\n\nsomething?\n\nMs. HANNA: Not necessarily. I'm just talking about, like, adults who,\n\nlike,\n\nput you down. You know what I mean? And that can be--you know, the more\n\nextreme forms of sexual abuse, that can be like psychological abuse. Like,\n\na\n\nlot of people grow up with parents and other family members who say, you\n\nknow,\n\n`You'll never make anything out of yourself,' and, you know, `You're fat,\n\nyou're ugly, you're stupid, you're lazy. You're, you know, whatever.' And\n\noftentimes, if we're women or other people in marginalized communities, we\n\nalso get told that by the media and we get told that by people at school,\n\nyou\n\nknow, so it's kind of, like, all around you. And, yeah, I mean, I did\n\nexperience, like, fear of violence and stuff. There was always guns in my\n\nhouse. So I was scared. I'm one of the people who grew up really scared.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: I mean, kids usually grow up, I mean, not usually like us, but\n\noften grow up with heterosexual couples as their parents, and often, that,\n\nlike, traditional nuclear family is really dysfunctional, but it's also,\n\nlike, constantly represented as the ideal in media, so just to see, you\n\nknow,\n\na gay couple, a lesbian couple or, you know, groups of adults living in some\n\nalternative manner to that is really, you know, kind of amazing for a child\n\nto\n\nsee if that option hasn't been exposed to them. You know, it can kind of\n\ngive\n\nyou hope for the future, like I could create something different for myself\n\nas\n\nan adult.\n\nMs. HANNA: Well, just hearing, you know, people, like, playing music on the\n\npiano together and knowing that they were snuggling probably while they were\n\ndoing it, like, that wasn't what my family was like at all, you know, so\n\nthat\n\nreally made me think there's something else.\n\nGROSS: Well, Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman, I thank you both so much for\n\ntalking with us.\n\nMs. HANNA: Thank you.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: And Kathleen and Johanna are in the group Le Tigre, and from the \"Le\n\nTigre\" record, this is \"Les & Ray.\"\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nUnidentified Woman: (Singing) I knew ...(unintelligible) the house, through\n\nsongs played on piano by my neighbors, Les and Ray. I put my hand up\n\nagainst\n\nthe wall to be closer to the music that they played. You were my oxygen,\n\nthe\n\nthing that made me think I could escape. This is a thank-you song for Les\n\nand\n\nRay.\n\nGROSS: Music from the band Le Tigre. Later this month, they start a new\n\ntour.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: New book \"A Good House,\" by Bonnie Burnard\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nOur book critic, Maureen Corrigan, has a review of Bonnie Burnard's first\n\nnovel, \"A Good House.\" It won the 1999 Giller Prize, which is Canada's most\n\nprestigious literary award. It's just been published in the US. Maureen\n\nsays\n\nit's one of those tales of ordinary life told with extraordinary precision.\n\nMAUREEN CORRIGAN reporting:\n\nWhy is it that I mentally yawn when somebody, even a friend, begins talking\n\nabout their multigenerational family history? The aunt whose marriage\n\ndissolved after 20 years, the step-cousin who was never quite right in the\n\nhead. But give me those same family sagas in fictional form, and I'll\n\nusually\n\ndevour them. Some of the difference has to do with the clarity and\n\nsuccinctness that writing can impose on a storyteller, and there's also the\n\nimplicit assurance in fiction that since an author god is in control,\n\nthere's\n\na design, an ultimate meaning to those stray stories about the relatives.\n\nI guess that's all true of \"A Good House,\" a novel by Bonnie Burnard that\n\nwas\n\nan award-winning best-seller in Canada last year. But what I most enjoyed\n\nabout \"A Good House\" was that it absolved me of my passivity as a reader.\n\nThe\n\ncharacters in this novel are so busy and Burnard describes their mundane\n\nbusyness in such enticing detail that I felt like I was busy doing something\n\nuseful, too. There are pages and pages here filled up with descriptions of\n\npeople stripping wallpaper and canning fruit and cooking. The women are\n\nalways putting together big meals where they scrub potatoes and caramelize\n\ncarrots and rub roasts. For me, \"A Good House\" exerts the same vicarious\n\nand\n\nvirtuous appeal as all those cooking and home improvement shows on PBS. I\n\nlove to watch as somebody else does all that work.\n\n\"A Good House\" is set in the small town of Stonebrooke(ph), Ontario. It\n\nopens\n\nin 1949 and stretches all the way to 1997. The story focuses on the\n\nChambers\n\nfamily: Bill, who returns from service in World War II minus a couple of\n\nfingers, and his wife Sylvia; their three kids, Patrick, Paul and little\n\nDaphne, who smashes up her jaw while performing in an amateur neighborhood\n\ncircus. Her face never looks quite balanced again. Sylvia dies young of\n\ncancer and Bill soon marries Margaret, a plain and wise woman who becomes\n\nthe\n\nheart and conscience of the family. Years pass, thousands of big meals were\n\nmade and consumed. The adult kids marry, divorce, procreate, mess up and\n\ndie\n\nin unexpected ways. And the town and country around the Chambers clan\n\nslowly,\n\nsubtly change, mostly for the worst. It's probably all more absorbing to\n\nread\n\nabout than to hear about.\n\nBurnard was an acclaimed short story writer before she wrote this, her first\n\nnovel, and she has the poetic precision of language, of somebody used to\n\nworking in a more compact form. Here, for instance, is how she describes\n\nthe\n\nconversation around Sylvia's deathbed, circa 1955: `The adults tried to\n\ntalk\n\nabout things Sylvia might find interesting--Sandy Koufax and the Brooklyn\n\nDodgers, Lassie, James Dean being killed like that. But everyone listened\n\ntoo\n\npolitely, too attentively to the speaker. Almost all of them were too\n\nunnaturally quick to laugh or offer agreement. Sylvia heard their words not\n\nas sentences deliberately formed to tell a person something, but as dull,\n\none-at-a-time thuds against the dull silence that had begun to wall her in.'\n\nReading \"A Good House\" gave me a sense of deja vu all over again.\n\nThe fact that this is a post-World War II family saga, that wife number one\n\ndies, leaving her husband to muddle through, and that the author, Bonnie\n\nBurnard, was no spring chicken when she began her novel-writing career all\n\nreminded me of a novel I always recommend to people who ask for a good\n\nstory.\n\nThat's \"Matters of Chance,\" by another late bloomer, Jeanette Haien. Both\n\nher\n\nnovels, you can get lost in, although \"Matters of Chance\" is much more\n\ninventive and magical than \"A Good House,\" which engagingly plods along.\n\nIt's\n\nthe difference between the shimmering New York City of the 1950s, where\n\n\"Matters of Chance\" is largely set, and Stonebrooke, Ontario, Canada.\n\nGROSS: Maureen Corrigan teaches literature at Georgetown University. She\n\nreviewed \"A Good House,\" by Bonnie Burnard.\n\nComing up, our classical music critic, Lloyd Schwartz, reads a poem from his\n\nnew book. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAnalysis: Use and misue of language\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nOur classical music critic, Lloyd Schwartz, is also an English teacher and a\n\npoet. He says he's especially interested in the way we use and misuse\n\nlanguage in our everyday speech and the possible revelations that come from\n\nthat misuse.\n\nLLOYD SCHWARTZ reporting:\n\nA few years ago, I was in an ice cream parlor and ordered a vanilla cone.\n\n`Easier said than done,' the guy at the counter replied, perhaps with more\n\nmeaning than he intended. I was reminded of that by an article I just saw\n\nin\n\nHarper's called Dubya As A Second Language(ph). It's about the fascinating\n\nEnglish spoken by one of our presidential candidates, who's quoted as\n\nsaying,\n\n\"He can't have it both ways. He can't take the high horse and then claim\n\nthe\n\nlow road.\" I would almost vote for him just so I could hear him talk.\n\nOf course, we're all guilty of this phenomenon. I have a poem that\n\ncelebrates\n\nexactly these kinds of twisted expressions, \"Proverbs From Purgatory(ph).\"\n\n`It was deja vu all over again. I know this town like the back of my head.\n\nPeople who live in glass houses are worth two in the bush. One hand\n\nscratches\n\nthe other. A friend in need is worth two in the bush. A bird in the hand\n\nmakes waste. Life isn't all it's crapped up to be. It's like finding a\n\nneedle in the eye of the beholder. It's like killing one bird with two\n\nstones. My motto in life has always been: Get it over with. Two heads are\n\nbetter than none. A rolling stone deserves another. All things wait for\n\nthose who come. A friend in need deserves another. I trust him as long as\n\nI\n\ncould throw him. He smokes like a fish. He's just a chip off the old\n\ntooth.\n\nI'll have him eating out of my lap. A friend in need opens a can of worms.\n\nToo many cooks spoil the child. An ill wind keeps the doctor away. The\n\nwolf\n\nat the door keeps the doctor away. People who live in glass houses keep the\n\ndoctor away. A friend in need shouldn't throw stones. A friend in need\n\nwashes the other. A friend in need keeps the doctor away.\n\n`A stitch in time is only skin deep. A verbal agreement isn't worth the\n\npaper\n\nit's written on. A cat may look like a king. Know which side of the bed\n\nyour\n\nbutter is on. Nothing is cut and dried in stone. You can eat more flies\n\nwith\n\nhoney than with vinegar. Don't let the cat of the barn. Let's burn that\n\nbridge when we get to it. When you come to a fork in the road, take it.\n\nDon't cross your chickens before they hatch. Do not read this sign. Throw\n\ndiscretion to the wolves. After the twig is bent, the barn door is locked.\n\nAfter the barn door is locked, you can come in out of the rain. A friend in\n\nneed locks the barn door. There's no fool like a friend in need. We've\n\npassed a lot of water since then. At least we got home in two pieces.\n\nAll's\n\nwell that ends. It ain't over till it's over. There's always one step\n\nfurther down you can go. It's a milestone hanging around my neck. Include\n\nme\n\nout. It was deja vu all over again.'\n\nGROSS: Lloyd Schwartz teaches English at the University of Massachusetts in\n\nBoston. \"Proverbs from Purgatory\" appears in Lloyd's new book of poems,\n\n\"Cairo Traffic.\" It will be published October 1st.\n\n(Credits given)"
