        "text": "In the print edition of the NME, Pussy Riot have revealed that they've been collaborating with Le Tigre/MEN member JD Samson on music and videos, with videos the focus. Last week, Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina covered Le Tigre's indie-dancefloor anthem \"Deceptacon\" in New York for VICE's 20th birthday.\n\nNow, what seemed like just a cover has turned out to be a homage to a hookup, with an album threatened for the future. \"Maybe at some point in the future we will do an album, but right now we want to make videos,\" said Tolokonnikova.\n\nLe Tigre's Johanna Fateman posted an image of the group all hanging out in the studio (see above) on her Instagram and the partnership seems like a good fit – Pussy Riot's music could do with some serious tightening up – the feeling's there, but it's undoubtedly a little rough around the edges. JD Samson has the chops to whip them into shape too, having written songs for Christina Aguilera, Peaches and Junior Senior and having been involved with \"Deceptacon\", one of this century's finest slices of punk precision.\n\nNot only that, but JD Samson's band MEN released a song called \"Let Them Out Or Let Me In\" in support of Pussy Riot, who were at the time imprisoned for performing their now famous anti-Putin song at the altar of Moscow’s Christ the Savior Cathedral. The sisterhood is strong – meaning that collaboration should be a breeze."
