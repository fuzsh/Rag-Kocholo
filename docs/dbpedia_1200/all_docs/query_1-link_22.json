        "text": "It makes more sense to think of songs like \"F.Y.R.\" as anthems to play when you're stuck in one of those brief disorientations brought on by, say, the latest report on women's salaries, rather than as bop by which to test your bed's resilience.\n\nThe punchy power of politics should be taken in the same vein as hip-hop's call to arms. In interviews, Hanna and Fateman have never shied away from a direct statement of their politics, and critics needn't apologize for them, either. Feminist Sweepstakes knocks out any of the diminutive possibilities in the term \"girl band,\" and offers up funk, punk and \"Fuck, yeah,\" instead. Le Tigre plays with Chicks on Speed Sunday (March 10) at the Great American Music Hall, 859 O'Farrell St., San Francisco. Tickets are $14.
