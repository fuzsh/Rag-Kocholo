        "text": "Le Tigre Announce First Tour in 18 Years\n\nLe Tigre (photo by Leeta Harding)\n\nThe iconic feminist electro trio, Le Tigre, which features Kathleen Hanna, JD Samson and Johanna Fateman, have just announced a full tour, their first in 18 years. They returned to the stage in 2022 at This Ain’t No Picnic after an eleven year absence and had already announced some festival dates this year including Primavera Sound in June and The Mosswood Meltdown in July. Now fans in many more cities can enjoy their post riot grrrl electro clash sounds of the “party after the protest” with dates in the US and Europe coming this spring into the summer.\n\nThe tour will commence with one date in Philadelphia on 5/27 that will serve as a warm-up before the European leg kicks off. They will return to North America in July, concluding in Brooklyn on 7/28 at Brooklyn Steel. Tickets go on sale at 9am on Friday 1/27. See below for all dates.\n\nThe band members have hardly stayed still in their time away from the project though, and tell us via a press release “Recently, Kathleen has been touring with Bikini Kill (see pics), running Tees 4 Togo (which sells artist-designed T-shirts to fund the non-profit organization Peace Sisters), and writing a book. JD has a full-time teaching position (as Assistant Arts Professor and Area Head of Performance at The Clive Davis Institute at NYU/Tisch), performs with CRICKETS, and tours with the original live score for the film 32 Sounds, directed by Sam Green. Johanna is an author and art critic who writes regularly for the “Goings on About Town” section of the New Yorker and for 4Columns; she is a contributing editor of Artforum.” They also released the song “I’m With Her” in 2016 to support of then presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nLe Tigre 2023 tour dates:\n\n5/27- Philadelphia, PA @ Union Transfer\n\n6/1- Barcelona, Spain @ Primavera Sound Barcelona 2023\n\n6/3- London, UK @ Troxy\n\n6/5- Manchester, UK @ Albert Hall\n\n6/6- Glasgow, Scotland @ Barrowland Ballroom\n\n6/8- Madrid, Spain @ Primavera Sound Madrid 2023\n\n6/9- Porto, Portugal @ Nos Primavera Sound Porto 2023\n\n6/11- Paris, France @ Le Trianon\n\n6/14- Amsterdam, Netherlands @ Paradiso\n\n6/16- Berlin, Germany @ Huxleys Neue Welt\n\n6/17- Hamburg, Germany @ Markthalle\n\n7/1- Oakland, CA @ Mosswood Meltdown Festival\n\n7/3- Vancouver, BC @ Commodore Ballroom\n\n7/6- Seattle, WA @ Paramount Theatre\n\n7/7- Portland, OR @ Roseland Theater\n\n7/9- Los Angeles, CA @ The Greek Theatre\n\n7/15- Chicago, IL @ The Salt Shed\n\n7/17- Cleveland, OH @ Agora Theatre\n\n7/18- Millvale, PA @ Mr. Smalls Theatre\n\n7/19- Baltimore, MD @ Baltimore Soundstage\n\n7/21- Toronto, ON @ History\n\n7/22- Montreal, QC @ L’Olympia\n\n7/24- Boston, MA @ Royale\n\n7/28- Brooklyn, NY @ Brooklyn Steel"
