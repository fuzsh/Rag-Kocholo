Sing it Loud grew out of a friendship between cousins vocalist Pat Brown and guitarist Kieren Smith, who founded the group together and added members whom they met locally in the Minneapolis music scene.[1] The band was offered a contract with Epitaph Records[2] after playing only seven shows together.[3] Their debut release for Epitaph was an EP produced by Josh Cain of Motion City Soundtrack, released in March 2008.[4][5] The group then toured with We the Kings, This Providence, Ludo, The Morning Light, Valencia, Every Avenue, Hit the Lights, All Time Low, Farewell, Cobra Starship, Forever the Sickest Kids, Single File, Cash Cash, Motion City Soundtrack, and others. A full-length produced by Cain and mixed by Mark Trombino was released on Epitaph on September 23, 2008.[6][7] The album features guest appearances from Justin Pierre of Motion City Soundtrack and Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low.[8] Come Around hit #44 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.[9]
