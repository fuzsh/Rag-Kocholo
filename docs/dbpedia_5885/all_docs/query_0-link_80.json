        "text": "Using Your Whole Body\n\nWhen you sing, your body is your instrument. That’s not just a cute thing we say, you are literally using your body as an instrument! Step one is to assemble your instrument correctly, so let’s talk about posture. There’s a little checklist you can go through before you sing to make sure your body is lined up right. Ears over your shoulders, shoulders over your hips, hips over your knees, and knees over your ankles. Make sure all those things are lined up, and try to keep your shoulders back and down. Try gently squeezing your shoulder blades together. Trying to sing with bad posture is like turning a guitar upside-down and trying to play it. You could probably manage, but why would you want to? You’ll definitely sound better with your instrument positioned the way it’s supposed to be.\n\nEvery instrument has a power source, a resonator, and an articulator. Let’s take an acoustic guitar for example. In a guitar, the power source is your hand. That’s where the energy that creates the vibrations is going to come from. The resonator is the body of the guitar, the place where those sound waves are going to bounce around and get bigger. The articulator in the guitar is the strings, that’s where the specificity of our sound is going to come from. In the Rock voice, the power source is our breath. The goal is not to blow as much air as possible, but to manage your breath effectively by using your abdominal muscles and intercostal muscles (the ones between your ribs). If you want to hold your abs and ribcage down and out, think of the kind of pressure that happens when you try to pick up something heavy. Balancing the muscular support with relaxation and space in your mouth and throat is one important part of projecting your voice like a Rock Star!\n\nThe Importance of Mixed Voice\n\nThe other half of projecting like a Rock Star is using your mixed Rock voice effectively. Your voice has a few different parts called registers. The main ones are “head voice” and “chest voice.” Very generally, the head voice is higher and the chest voice is lower. The chest voice is what you’re probably used to hearing in Rock and the head voice is what you’re probably used to hearing in classical singing. Both registers are very important to all kinds of singing though! Usually when we say “belting” what we mean is singing something in a chest voice loud and high. You’ve probably tried to belt something out before and either ended up switching to a breathy form of head voice or just shouting. To avoid hurting your voice, you can mix your head voice and chest voice. The best way to start learning how to have a solid mixed Rock voice is to train your head voice along with your chest voice so that you have solid ingredients to mix together later. A mixed voice is the key to singing higher and louder without hurting your throat.\n\nBefore you get any further into technique, it’s important to know how to take care of your voice. Good technique is the best way, but it takes years to develop! In the meantime, the most important things are to listen to your body, rest well, and stay hydrated. You might have heard singers say they avoid certain foods like dairy or they might use tea with honey and lemon, but the only things that will actually make your Rock voice better when it’s not feeling good are rest and time. The golden rule of singing is “If It Hurts, Don’t Do It.” If it is uncomfortable, stop. If it makes your throat hurt, stop. If it makes you lose your voice, stop. Your whole life, you only get one voice. You need to treat it well. You can always try belting that song again when your voice feels better!"
