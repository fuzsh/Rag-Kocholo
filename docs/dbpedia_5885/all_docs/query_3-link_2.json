Liv starred in it and spent four years in Hollywood filming it. She played a character named Stephanie Einstein, who was the main character of the show.\n\nTo see more fictional movies and TV shows, see Fictional Filmography.\n\nPlot[]\n\nBased on Sing It Louder!!-A-Rooney, the plot of this show highly suggests Stephanie Einstein broke a law and was caught, which resulted in her being sent to a therapeutic boarding school to help her become a model citizen. At the series finale, she graduated and was allowed to return home.\n\nFeatured Songs[]\n\nOn Top of the World\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe show ends with Liv and her class graduating.\n\nSing it Loud! has been mentioned in several episodes, such as Twin-A-Rooney, Skate-A-Rooney, and especially Sing It Louder!!-A-Rooney and Sing It Live!!!-A-Rooney.\n\nLiv once found a Sing It Loud! DVD in a ditch. (Dodge-A-Rooney)\n\nLiv left for Hollywood to film the show when she was only 11 years old. (Flashback-A-Rooney)\n\nThis was the first show Liv starred in, the second being Voltage, and the third being Sing It Louder!!\n\nIt had 4 seasons, which is the same maximum amount of seasons a Disney Channel show has, including Liv and Maddie.\n\nKathy Kan stars as Stephanie Einstein in the Korean version of Sing It Loud! (Korean: 큰소리로 부르세요!)\n\nBased on the fact the show revolved around a boarding school, it is likely Bree DuMont was not a part of the main cast.\n\nAn episode was called Race It Loud.\n\nIn one episode, Stephanie has a dream where she is visiting an international space station and sings a super high note to destroy an asteroid before it fell to earth. The producers of Space Werewolves saw this episode and loved it so much they changed the male lead Tristan Lycanth into a girl so Liv could audition for the role.\n\nCast[]\n\nLiv Rooney as Stephanie Einstein\n\nSouth Salamanca as Stephanie's best friend\n\nBree DuMont as Alberta Einstein\n\nUnknown as Gunther\n\nGallery[]"
