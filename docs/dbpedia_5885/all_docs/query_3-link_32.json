We are non profit making and donate any extra funds to local charities.\n\nIt was set up to help people discover the joy of singing together and to meet new people.\n\nEach year we hold 2-3 concerts with a 12 week programme of rehearsals to prepare for them. Each concert has a different theme and will contain songs from different genres and eras - something for everyone."
