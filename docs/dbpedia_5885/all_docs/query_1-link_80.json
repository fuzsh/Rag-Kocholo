        "text": "patWho can honestly say that they’ve never dreamt of becoming a rockstar? Well, with these 20 rock karaoke songs, you have the chance to live out your dream!\n\nFrom the energetic power chords to the ridiculous hair and shouty choruses – rock music is perfectly suited to karaoke. So without further ado, we give you the top 20 karaoke rock songs of all time.\n\n1. Bohemian Rhapsody – Queen\n\nProbably in the top 5 karaoke songs of all time, let alone rock karaoke songs! There's hardly a music lover alive who doesn't know every single lyric.\n\n2. Don't Stop Believin' – Journey\n\nThis fist-pumping rock anthem is beloved by all and a top karaoke rock song to sing. Plus. everyone knows the lyrics, so you’ll definitely have the crowd burst into song with you.\n\n3. Mr. Brightside – The Killers\n\nAfter a couple of drinks at the karaoke bar, we guarantee that you’ll be coming out of your cage and doing just fine! So why not sing this epic rock song on the karaoke stage?\n\n4. Thunderstruck – AC/DC\n\nFor a bit of a heavier rock song, just choose any one of AC/DCs tracks. However, we’ve got to say that we think this 1990s mega-hit Thunderstruck is ideal for karaoke.\n\n5. Seven Nation Army – The White Stripes\n\nHaving won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song in 2004, it’s easy to see why this song made it onto our list. That’s not to mention its continuous guitar riff.\n\n6. I Love Rock ‘n’ Roll - Joan Jett & the Blackhearts\n\nThis gritty rock n’ roll song was an absolute hit, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for seven straight weeks in 1982. Plus, we love the fact that this rock song was headed by a woman!\n\n7. Born To Run – Bruce Springsteen\n\nWhile this song may have been released back in 1975, it’s still a banger to sing along to. Springsteen has a deserved reputation as a perfectionist and ended up laying down eleven different guitar tracks for Born To Run to get the sound just right. The result is an absolute masterpiece.\n\n8. I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor – Arctic Monkeys\n\nAnother contemporary rock track, this is the song that made the Arctic Monkeys famous! And we think it’s got one of the greatest lines ever – \"Oh there ain't no love no Montagues or Capulets, Just banging tunes 'n' DJ sets\".\n\n9. Welcome To The Jungle – Guns N' Roses\n\nWelcome to the jungle; we've got fun and games with this rock n’ roll karaoke track that featured on the band's first album. Make sure you can hit those higher notes if you decide to sing this song.\n\n10. Purple Haze - Jimi Hendrix\n\nNow, if you think you’ve heard a famous guitar riff before, listen to Purple Haze and then tell us this isn’t the most insane rock riff ever. Jimi was certainly operating at another level when he did this track, so we expect you to do the same!\n\n11. Baba O'Riley – The Who\n\nThe original recording of Baba O'Riley was actually 30 minutes in length but thankfully, for karaoke fans, The Who edited that original session down to a much more manageable 5 minutes!\n\n12. Under Pressure - Queen & David Bowie\n\nDid you know that this song was created during an impromptu jam session between Queen and Bowie? Its infectious beat and poignant lyrics are like no other, which is why it continues to be a fan favorite.\n\n13. Stairway To Heaven – Led Zeppelin\n\n\"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven\" – what a masterpiece! It’s worth singing at karaoke to hear the Jimmy Page guitar solo alone!\n\n14. Rock And Roll All Night – Kiss\n\nLove them or hate them, you can’t deny the fact that this wonderfully ridiculous band has been performing to full arenas for decades now. That’s why we had to add one of their songs to our list of rock karaoke songs.\n\n15. Boys Are Back In Town – Thin Lizzy\n\nThe ultimate rock song for a karaoke night out with the boys. The members of Thin Lizzy had working-class roots and created this song to connect with their fans - how cool?\n\n16. Wonderwall – Oasis\n\nAnother track that'd be towards the top of a list of all-time karaoke classics, let alone just rock songs. This slower rock song remains popular, even 25 years after its release.\n\n17. Comfortably Numb - Pink Floyd\n\nPink Floyd, you almost can’t compare them to another band; they were so iconic. Comfortably Numb is all things rock n’ roll, sporting a legendary guitar solo and psychedelic lyrics.\n\n18. Hotel California – The Eagles\n\nA ballad exploring the dark underbelly of the American Dream doesn't sound like it'd make for the best karaoke choice, but Hotel California is such a melodic masterpiece you can't help but enjoy wailing along to the chorus with gusto.\n\n19. Lust For Life – Iggy Pop\n\nCo-written by Iggy Pop and David Bowie (who plays the ukulele on the track), Lust For Life is a fantastic bit of rock 'n' roll that's sure to get your heart racing next time you sing it at karaoke. Extra points for attempting some of Iggy Pop's famously sultry dance moves!\n\n20. Jumpin' Jack Flash – The Rolling Stones\n\nKeith Richards and Mick Jagger were inspired to write Jumpin' Jack Flash when they were awoken one morning at Richards's country house by the sound of his gardener, Jack Dyer, clumping past the window. To think we might have missed out on one of the greatest karaoke rock songs of all time if Keith Richards had a gardener called Bob!\n\nReady To Rock Out With These Karaoke Tracks?"
