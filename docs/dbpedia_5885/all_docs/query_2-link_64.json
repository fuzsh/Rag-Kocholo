        "meta_description": "Sing It Loud - Luthers Erben in Tansania: Directed by Julia Irene Peters, Jutta Feit. Once a year 1500 choirs take part in the the big Choir Challenge of the Lutheran Church of Tanzania held now for 60 years .The film is about Tanzanian voices performing classical Lutherian Chorals and their own compositions, about talent, dedication, faith. 3 Choirs prepare for the Choir competition and invite us to take part in a journey to the heart of their music, with the bitter/sweet notes of everyday life's challenges in an emerging African society and an heritage of colonialism and proselytisation. Nearly 500 years after Luther's death God seemed nowhere to be as alive as much as in this East African country. Luther s musical heritage is heard everywhere: on the radio, on television and as phone Rington. CD's and DVD's with choir music are bestsellers.Choir music is pop music. At the challenge people from all walks of life meet: the Massai Warrior from the wast-lands, the young Facebook user from the city. All people come together to celebrate the best choir of Tanzania and to praise God.",
