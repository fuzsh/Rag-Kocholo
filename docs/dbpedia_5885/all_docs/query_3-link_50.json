        "text": "FOR THE first time ever, Ronnie Scott’s partners with Channel 4 and Whisper TV to present Sing It Loud: Black and Proud, a one-hour programme exploring the history and impact of iconic black protest songs.\n\nAfter an unprecedented year of tragedy, turmoil and reflection, five of the hottest young musicians on Britain’s contemporary jazz scene take to the world-famous Ronnie Scott’s stage to perform and celebrate a series of anthems of black pride and protest.\n\nPresented by TV and radio presenter, Maya Jama, the programme features Poppy Ajudha, Ashley Henry, Reuben James, Zara McFarlane and Ayanna Witter-Johnson who perform their own interpretations of iconic black protest anthems from Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Billie Holiday, Marvin Gaye and James Brown.\n\nMaya chats with each artist about the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement and their choice of song providing insights about why they still resonate in today’s society.\n\nWhen asked why he chose to perform Nina Simon’s iconic ‘Mississippi Goddam’, Ashley Henry reminded Maya that Nina had performed that very song on the Ronnie Scott’s stage 35 years ago.\n\n“She’s one of the first entertainers to literally change the narrative of how a black entertainer can be” he said, “(one of the first) to say “No, I’m going to be serious, you gonna feel my message you gonna hear what I’m saying and resonate with what I’m doing”.\n\nMulti-talented saxophonist Soweto Kinch will also deliver a rousing rendition of his recent work to complete a joyous evening of sonic history and monumental music.\n\nSing It Loud: Black and Proud is part of Channel 4’s season of programmes celebrating Black lives and Black culture, Black and Proud, a month-long curation of content ranging from bold and timely documentaries to powerful short films that show different aspects of the black experience in modern Britain."
