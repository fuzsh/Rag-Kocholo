        "text": "I actually have had to move -- I was at a regional singing here in Ohio several years ago, singing alto, which I usually do, and some women from Chicago told me I was \"not singing it right\", meaning as loud as possible, like they were. So I felt like I was totally not wanted or needed in the altos, and we happened to be very short on trebles, so I moved over there and sang treble, which I find generally is not belted QUITE so loud as other parts.\n\nWhen I was active in my local group, they all knew me and appreciated me even though I do have a \"church choir\" voice -- I can sing any part, and I can lead anything, so I'd be asked to help new people lead, or to lead songs in a new book. I'd also sometimes be the only one singing tenor up in the usual female range, which adds a nice sound to the melody. Once I'm with people who don't know me, though, I feel like I don't fit in.\n\nI'm glad the Sacred Harp is gaining in popularity, but I feel like there isn't much place for me in it any more -- the above incident is not the only time I've been criticized, either privately, in front of the whole group, or after I have left for the day, when a woman from another state said, within earshot of my best friend, that she was glad that the \"uppity alto\" had left. I was behind her, and we had not spoken one word to each other -- she just assumed from the sound of my voice that I must be \"uppity\", which I don't think I am.\n\nSo -- sorry for griping about personal issues, but -- seeing that some others share some of my feelings, I think it is important that everyone realize that we come from varying singing backgrounds, and if Sacred Harp is going to thrive, there needs to be room and tolerance for more than one kind of voice.\n\nSheryl\n\n--- On Tue, 7/24/12, Karen <karen_...@btinternet.com> wrote:\n\nTo: \"claire...@yahoo.com\" <claire...@yahoo.com>\n\nCc: \"david....@vanderbilt.edu\" <david....@vanderbilt.edu>, \"doj...@yahoo.com\" <doj...@yahoo.com>, \"fasola-di...@googlegroups.com\" <fasola-di...@googlegroups.com>\n\nDate: Tuesday, July 24, 2012, 2:06 AM\n\nI'm fairly new to Sacred Harp and finding your conversation very interesting. I wonder if there is a difference between singers who came from a classical choral background where balance and blend are engrained as high expectations and those who have SH background? I need to hear more than my part to keep happily on(ish) pitch\n\nI've done a fair bit of singing at 'Come and sing' events and volume balance etc can be a problem there. As has been said it's a case of appropriate for the situation.\n\nAt least at a big singing if the person next to you is too loud, there might be the opportunity to move!\n\nKaren in Scotland\n\nSent from my iPod\n\nWell, I'm glad I brought this up -- I was reluctant, because I know I am not the usual type of voice for Sacred Harp, but I think this has been a good discussion, and I hope people of varying views can take something positive from this.\n\nI do respect the tradition, but when some people use that as a reason to criticize or exclude people from other forms of choral singing, I don't think that's good for the future of Sacred Harp. Some of us have even joked that there should be \"traditional\" and \"progressive\" singings to accommodate all, but I think we all would prefer to keep everyone together and be tolerant and accepting of each other.\n\nI probably won't meet many of you -- I'm not a traveler, and I do enough other singing that often I'm busy, anyway. But I do enjoy the photos and video clips that people post, and i have sung with quite a few of the people past and present, including Hugh McGraw, Judy Hauff, Bob Meek, Bill Shetter, the Duffs, the Herrs, the Bayers, and many more, and I hope to sing with some of you again in the future.\n\nSheryl\n\n--- On Tue, 7/24/12, Claire Outten <claire...@yahoo.com> wrote:"
