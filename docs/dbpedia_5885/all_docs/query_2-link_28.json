        "text": "Seb Farrall\n\nA musician from a young age, Seb Farrall graduated from Coventry University in 2014 with a first-class degree in music composition and the Robert Ramskill composition award for ‘significant contribution to the department’. Seb conducted the department orchestra for several years and played a leading role in a number of successful composition and conducting projects, most notably as co-founder of the community ensemble MenCho.\n\nAfter MenCho, the phone didn’t stop ringing, and as Seb’s reputation grew, his commitment to community music-making only deepened. He is now Musical Director of a number of ensembles in Warwickshire, Senior Musical Director of the Workplace Choir Company, and is developing Online Conductor, an online resource to support community ensembles in overcoming barriers to music-making. Seb is the founding conductor of Sing It Loud, and so this particular community of singers has a special place in his heart, and he is hugely proud of all they have accomplished."
