        "text": "Hey guys/girls...\n\nso, I mostly sing rock music which usually needs more support, then let's say, pop.\n\nThe thing is I can't put my volume down! I can only sing loud, and there is no way that I can sing any high note with low volume.\n\nLow notes are not the problem ofcourse, I can sing them quietly or low, but when singing higher notes - loud is the only option.\n\nThis of course limits my upper range, because I guess if I could go just a bit lighter, it would be much easier for me up there in higher registers\n\nMy support (at least inhaling part:) is fine, it's diaphragmic, so I guess that is not the issue.\n\nWhen exhaling, on high notes I just have to add volume, and if I don't I will probably go to falsetto or crack.\n\nSo lighter high notes are something non-existing for me, and it was always like that.\n\nHere is me singing U2 - One. If you listen carefully, you will see that the higher note is the louder I have to be.\n\nhttp://www.box.net/shared/i6xnc2kecy\n\nIf I would go lighter than that than that my voice would probably crack.\n\nIf you listen to Bono in original song or live, he usually sing this with a bit less volume then me, but I can't do that.\n\nSo can anyone suggest some tips.\n\nOh yeah, and visuals/sensations helps a lot, so any visuals or sensation tips that could help me understand my mistakes better, would be great.\n\nHelp?\n\nThanks,\n\nNikola\n\nHey, Nikola\n\nI think you might be forcing up chest voice. Especially if you have a hard time singing light high notes. But the thing is.. singing light AND high is an advanced technique.\n\nMaybe you can try lighting your lower range and maybe your middle range as well. Then it might become easier. Its possible that too much weight is being dragged up.\n\nI've had the same experience when I was younger. I only knew how to sing loud, which was by forcing chest voice. Which also limited some of my range as well.\n\nNowadays I retrained my singing a bit and trying not to use too much chest voice. Now I can only sing light to medium for my higher notes. lol\n\nSee, I find the statement that \"singing light AND high is an advanced technique\" to be odd, because I always do this, automatically, and to me it's just basic. But I CAN'T sing loud properly...and to me, THIS is an advanced technique! lol\n\nAll I know about this is when I have to put more volume into a high note, it tends to mean it's getting a bit into my uncomfortably high range. So I need less air and more voice to get the note OUT, you know? And keep it stable, etc. If I try to be softer, it sometimes can cut in and out, which sucks."
