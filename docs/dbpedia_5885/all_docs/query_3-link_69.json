        "text": "Almost 15 months have passed since Sing It Loud announced that they were no more, but the band just recently reissued first EP from 2007 before signing to Epitaph Records and it’s now available on iTunes with two acoustic bonus tracks. Although guitarist Kieren Smith insists that Sing It Loud are not back together yet, he issued a statement regarding what the future might bring for the band:\n\n“As far as what we will be doing in 2012, we still have to figure that out. I am being completely honest here. We don’t want to stage a huge come-back and then not come through with it, but we are all talking again and bouncing ideas back and forth. This may not be the appropriate thing to talk about openly as it may confuse or bum some people out, but I really don’t give a fuck. Anyone who supports Sing It Loud deserves to know EXACTLY what’s going on with us. We are all extremely excited to be independent musicians again and love that we can share some unreleased songs with everyone. Hopefully we will be able to share some new jams in the future as well and maybe, JUST MAYBE, we will be able to jump around on stage like idiots and see Nate Flynn with his shirt off once again…. just like old times.”\n\nYou can read the rest of Kieren’s statement here.\n\nSing It Loud released their final album Everything Collide a year ago on Epitaph."
