        "text": "However, there are always the exceptions! Some of the most successful iconic singers consistently over-affect their voice, and it has become a part of their unmistakable sound. Some famous examples include singers such as Celine Dion, who has made a career with her unique voice, which often includes a slight knurdle, or over-squeezing of her vocal cords and Britney Spears, who employs vocal fry in most every song that she sings.\n\nYou may also be the exception, where you have found that a certain consistent style choice actually improves your overall delivery and enhances your listener‚Äôs experience. Yet, if that is not the case, I will briefly discuss some practical ways that you can incorporate style, while not overloading your listeners.\n\nFirst, focus inward in and identify your particular style tendencies so you that gain awareness of your own voice. Start to ask yourself some hard questions‚Ä¶ Do I consistently sing with a breathy tone? Am I tirelessly using the same inflections in my singing patterns? Am I overusing vibrato? Is my sound always loud and powerful, or am I able to be soft and vulnerable?\n\nOnce you begin to explore and be honest about your own voice you will be more able to confront any excessive style choices and return to a more organic sound. Next, try recording yourself. When you sing a song and listen to the playback do your style choices seem natural, or forced and contrived?\n\nOnce you have identified and analyzed your specific style tendencies, then remain mindful of how you are incorporating them into your songs.\n\nLastly, in order to return to a more believable sound, try speaking the lyrics to your song. Talk through your song, and then slowly add pitches in order to closely mirror your speaking voice to that of your singing. Essentially, singing is speaking on pitch.\n\nThus, the singing of your song should always exist to tell a story or relay an emotion, and your style choices should simply be an extension of that function. However, often times, we can let pride sneak in and we will try to use vocal acrobats to show off our voices, rather than singing for the song itself.\n\nRemember, the song is the message, and you are the messenger. While your unique style and delivery is essential to an honest performance, your ability to be yourself and not over-stylize can serve to set you apart.\n\nThe Looney Toons or Bugs Bunny character ‚ÄúElmer Fudd‚Äù was the most vocal fry dominant vocal quality in any entertainment character. Check out his short clip below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZeqL0CUvjY\n\nstylistic uses and abuses of vocal fry\n\nPart of using vocal fry in phrasing is understanding that we already use it. Little toddlers often use their creaky voices when they wake up in the middle of the night, asking for a drink of water. Every note is vocal fry. Later we‚Äôll discuss the intuitive wisdom of vocal fry in the morning vocal quality.\n\nWhen we use vocal fry at the bottom note of a phrase, it‚Äôs like laying a foundation for the rest of the voice.\n\nEnding a musical phrase with vocal fry is far more uncommon but can make you sound far more commercial or pop in your approach.\n\nThis sound also emphasizes certain words to reflect multiple possible emotions, including vulnerability, seduction, tiredness or sleepy, cool or relaxed voice, anger, love or romance and humor (subtle vocal fry laugh in song or conversation can be winsome).\n\nSome of the artists who‚Äôve used vocal fry masterfully are:\n\nShania Twain- ‚ÄúThe Woman in Me‚Äù\n\nTim McGraw- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Your Love‚Äù\n\nSteven Tyler (Aerosmith) -‚ÄúPink‚Äù\n\nBono (U2)- ‚ÄúRunning to Stand Still‚Äù\n\nBrooke Fraser- ‚ÄúThe Thief‚Äù (also listed in breathy singing)\n\nTess Manning- ‚ÄúEnough For You‚Äù\n\nGary Allan- ‚ÄúThe Best I Ever Had.‚Äù This might be construed as an overuse of vocal fry since its used in nearly every sentence. Sometimes on every word of the entire sentence. But when you hear the rest of Gary‚Äôs music, it‚Äôs apparent that he uses vocal fry all the time. Or we might say vocal fry uses him. Not trying to be cute here, but think how a dominant vocal fry, breathy voice quality, nasal quality, de-nasal quality or any other approach can tend to force a singer‚Äôs hand. They deal with the tones they‚Äôve been dealt.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hk6qDgQjA [please embed]\n\nBreathy Singing\n\nBreathy singing occurs when the tone quality is more dominated by air flow and weak cord closure. As we‚Äôll mention later, this can be injurious to singers. This airy or breathy tone is opposite to a squeezed, compressed or edgy sound. All these are balanced with a normal, clear and relaxed tone.\n\nBreathy singing produces a very commercial voice. This is due to something I teach my singers called 10k Frequency. Be sure to catch my Instagram and YouTube Shorts explaining this more throughly.\n\nNoticeable breathy voices include: Sarah McLachlan, Ellie Goulding, Brook Fraser (‚ÄúThe Thief‚Äù is a masterclass), Mariah Cary, Smoky Robinson, Brian McKnight (‚ÄúStill in Love‚Äù).\n\nTasteful breathy singing\n\nBreathy tones should rarely be done on every note. And, if it sounds like you‚Äôre running out of air or you sound fake, you‚Äôll be guilty of tasteless affectation. Women can usually get away with more breathy singing, because women often talk breathy. Think Marilyn Monroe.\n\nWhen breathy singing punishes the Vocal folds\n\nThe further you get away from a clear tone and the closer you get to a whisper, the more torque you‚Äôll be dishing out to the surface of your vocal folds. Research by ENT‚Äôs (throat doctors) have seen scar tissue from the overuse of breathy singing. Meaning that you may need medical treatment to fix self-inflicted vocal problems.\n\nEventually, it will be hard to get cord closure and your tone will be one dimensional.\n\nAn educated and competent vocal coach can gage the balance between healthy and gutsy singing.\n\nEdgy Singing\n\nMany coaches and choir directors have feared this coordination. Understandably so. Over compressed cords can lead to serious vocal fatigue. But singing directly on the inner edges of the vocal folds isn‚Äôt much different from talking like a valley girl. You just need to be sure to find a healthy balance between breathy and edgy singing.\n\nEdgy singing can be extremely exciting and produce overtones that are ear grabbing. Whenever there‚Äôs a language change or adaptation, you pick up‚Äîin most every language‚Äîspeakers have a different manner of how much or how little air they use on certain words.\n\nSpeakers who have long, run on sentences must employ an edge so they can keep from a pause in their delivery, in order to get their idea across, without being interrupted. Like I just did now. üòâ\n\nNoticeable ‚Äòedgy‚Äô singers include: Bono (U2), Jimmy Gnecco (ours), Deborah Cox, Mariah Carey (her tonal diversity is one thing she has over most singers), Brett Manning (‚ÄòSeptember‚Äô‚Ä¶oh wait, that‚Äôs me) üòé\n\nNasal Voice Quality\n\nThe nasal tone is produced when the soft palate drops, causing the tone to come through your nostrils. It can be heard in Broadway and musical theater performances to add personality to a character‚Äôs singing, however it can easily be overused and people tend to find it abrasive.\n\nNasal coordinations, in the pharyngeal voice, can help restore broken voices. Also the pharyngeal, though bright, doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be excessively nasal.\n\nAs the listener, you get to decide between interesting and overused or affected singers.\n\nNoticeable singers who artistically color their voices with nasality include: Celine Dion (often charming and even used in pharyngeal voice to find mix), Willie Nelson\n\nDe-nasal Voice Quality\n\nThis quality is like Rocky‚Äôs ‚Äúyo Adrian‚Äù or when you hear a valley girl speak all the time like her nose is plugged. There‚Äôs a charm to this, until‚Ä¶. you do it on every note. Also, research warns of an overweighted voice, because the lack of nasality causes the voice to work too hard.\n\nYoung people have adopted this tone partly out of the loss of ear development to hear other resonance structure. This is almost a rebellion against the excesses of nasality. Society norms (throughout the world and in most every language) shift every decade or so.\n\nNoticeable singers (mostly women) with de-nasal sounding voices are: Britney Spears, Tate McRae, Lennon Stella, Elvis Presley, and Jimmy Gnecco (particularly the chorus in ‚ÄúThese are My Hands‚Äù).\n\nFake Accents and Dialects\n\nWe see through country singers trying to convince listeners that they‚Äôre from the Deep South. Your voice has to slowly adapt to the culture you surround yourself with.\n\nEqually ridiculous is when so many singers attempt to sing the same way as Adele, not realizing her pronunciation is distinctly ‚Äònew‚Äô British.\n\nThe goal is to be convincing. Trying too hard to be distinct brings on severe affectation and ironically you‚Äôll be a copy cat.\n\nThe Light and Dark Side of Quirky Singing\n\nWhen 2000-2010 featured rock singers placing arrrrrr in every word, like a pirate, when coffee shop singers turn their ‚ÄòR‚Äôs‚Äô into W‚Äôs, and when singers become a caricature of the singer they admire, it‚Äôs too much. Some call this bizarre approach ‚Äúsinging in cursive.‚Äù\n\nThe light side is that, with enough influences, throughout several decades, who won‚Äôt be accused of being a caricature of some other sing.\n\nDoes Affectation Damage Your Vocal Cords?\n\nYes and no ‚Äî vocal fry isn‚Äôt damaging to your voice, but research shows that breathy singing could potentially lead to damage over time. Also too much habitual fry can diminish overall vocal ability.\n\nMake sure you work with a vocal coach to ensure that you‚Äôre using the proper techniques and not potentially harming your voice long-term.\n\nHow to Know When Too Much is Too Much\n\nThese style choices, when used in moderation, can be tasteful, intuitive, and show supreme musicianship, however when they are overused they may become predictable, uninteresting and in some cases displeasing to the listener. Personally, I never understood the old adage, ‚ÄúYou can never have too much of a good thing.‚Äù\n\nThat is simply untrue!\n\nOne can have too much ice cream, too much sunlight, too many hours watching television, or too much traveling. Likewise, a singer can have an excessive amount of stylistic tricks within the course of a song. Sometimes the listener desires a reprieve, where they can hear the human voice, simply unaffected.\n\nHowever, there are always the exceptions! Some of the most successful, iconic singers consistently over-affect their voice, and it has become a part of their unmistakable tone. Some famous examples include singers such as Celine Dion, who has made a career with her unique voice, which often includes a slight knurdle, or over-squeezing of her vocal cords, and Britney Spears, who employs vocal fry in almost every song that she sings.\n\nYou may also be the exception, where you have found that a certain consistent interpretation choice actually improves your overall delivery and enhances your listener‚Äôs experience. Yet, if that is not the case, I will briefly discuss some practical ways that you can incorporate stylistic tricks, while not overloading your listeners.\n\nSelf-Awareness\n\nFirst, focus inward in and identify your particular vocal style tendencies so you that gain awareness of your own voice. Start to ask yourself some hard questions‚Ä¶\n\nDo I consistently sing with a creaky voice or a breathy tone?\n\nAm I tirelessly using the same inflections in my singing patterns?\n\nAm I overusing vibrato?\n\nIs my voice always loud and powerful, or am I able to be soft and vulnerable?\n\nAlso, if you‚Äôre a job candidate for a music gig. An overtly breathy, quirky or creaky voice will reduce job prospects because you won‚Äôt be believable.\n\nListen In, Listen Back"
