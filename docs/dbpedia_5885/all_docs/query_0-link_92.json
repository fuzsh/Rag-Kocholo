Before submitting her song, Luna sees the commercial for the contest, which states that the top 5 best songs will be performed by their artists, and the single most popular song will be given a record deal. However, just before hitting the submission button, Luna learns from the commercial the goal of the song is to be sure everyone in the world will love the song. This causes Luna to question if her song is something that the whole world will love. Suddenly, Luna begins hearing her other siblings sing, ranging from...\n\nLana singing a vaudeville about how much she likes to fix the toilet (\"Toilet Jam\")\n\nLola singing a show tune to highlight her beauty (\"Glam Song\")\n\nLisa singing a rap about the periodic table (\"Periodic Table Rap\")\n\nAs they finish their songs, the three tell Luna that they weren't singing at all, and Lisa, after suggesting that Luna sit down to talk about her problems, tells Luna that she's hallucinating her siblings singing, as her subconscious is trying to find the right sound of music for her song. After exiting Lisa and Lily's room, Luna continues to see the rest of her family sing, such as...\n\nLori and Leni singing a slow jam in response to a text Leni got from Chaz (\"Lori2Leni\")\n\nLuan singing about how life becomes less scary when viewed through the lens of comedy (\"Luan's Laugh Parade\")\n\nLucy giving a poetic speech embracing her gothic lifestyle (\"Song of Silence\")\n\nLynn singing an electronic song about her athleticism (\"Get Pumped!\")\n\nRita and Lynn Sr. singing a country song detailing their love (\"That's Our Kinda Song\")\n\nLincoln and Clyde singing a techno song detailing how they're friends, despite their imperfections (\"Best Buds\")\n\nHearing all of her family members \"sing\" their favorite types of music, Luna starts to lose hope, feeling that she will never come up with something the world will love. As Luna plops her head in defeat, she hears some music playing in the hallway. She discovers that it's Lily, dancing to a song on the radio (\"Best Thing Ever\"). Suddenly, the other family members join in (including the pets, Clyde, Mr. Grouse, and the Casagrandes), dancing to the song. Once the song ends, Luna comes to the conclusion that the world loves bubblegum pop songs, and decides to get to work while everyone else heads off to get a Flippee.\n\nAct II[]\n\nLuna comes up with a brand new song to submit (\"What Everybody Wants\"). After performing the song, Luna promptly submits it to America's Next Hitmaker, confident that she will win.\n\nSometime later, Luna is informed via email that \"What Everybody Wants\" has made it to the top 5, and gets to perform it on America's Next Hitmaker. The siblings congratulate Luna on the opportunity.\n\nLater, Luna arrives at the performance hall where America's Next Hitmaker is taking place, and discovers the two judges running the show, Michelle and Doug. When Luna introduces herself to them, the two tell Luna that she wasn't what they were expecting, and offer to give Luna some \"tweaks\" to better herself (\"Changing Luna\"), saying that it'll help her become somebody the world will love. After the \"tweaks\", Luna's new look makes her virtually unrecognizable (even her family thinks she's someone different), and they decide to change her name to Lulu, saying that Luna Loud is not a name anyone will like. When Luna tries to object, she is given an ultimatum: either she performs the way she is, or not perform at all. Realizing the bad spot she put herself into, Luna laments her situation (\"What Have I Done?\"), saying that she regrets selling herself out for world fame.\n\nLater that day, a crowd of thousands is attending the show, including the Loud family. Michelle and Doug present \"Lulu\" to the stage, much to the confusion of the Louds. Luna, as Lulu, approaches the stage, when suddenly, she tells the crowd that she's not performing... as Lulu. She promptly rips off her outfit to reveal the real Luna Loud and starts playing her old song (\"Play It Loud (Reprise)\"). As the crowd starts jamming out, Michelle and Doug, angry that Luna is going against them, attempt to sabotage her performance by unplugging her amps (which is located at the center of the stage). Lynn and Lana take note of this and stop them by blasting them with cannons. After performing, Michelle and Doug ask Luna what she has just done, and Luna simply states that she may have given up worldwide fame, but there is one thing she is keeping: her real self.\n\nCast[]\n\nCollin Dean as Lincoln\n\nJackson Petty as Lincoln's singing voice\n\nCatherine Taber as Lori\n\nLiliana Mumy as Leni\n\nNika Futterman as Luna\n\nCristina Pucelli as Luan\n\nJessica DiCicco as Lynn / Lucy\n\nGrey Griffin as Lana / Lola / Lily\n\nLara Jill Miller as Lisa\n\nAndre Robinson as Clyde\n\nBrian Stepanek as Lynn Sr.\n\nJill Talley as Rita\n\nJohn DiMaggio as Mr. Grouse\n\nJeff Bennett as Mick Swagger\n\nRachel Butera as Michelle\n\nMichelle Lewis as Michelle's singing voice (uncredited)\n\nTova Litvin as Pop Singer\n\nDoug Rockwell as Doug\n\nBobby, Ronnie Anne, Carlota, CJ, Carl, Chunk, Ken Mu, Teen Girl, and Dana have no lines in this episode.\n\nSongs[]\n\nMain article: Really Loud Music/Songs\n\n\"Play it Loud\"\n\n\"Toilet Jam\"\n\n\"Glam Song\"\n\n\"Periodic Table Rap\"\n\n\"Lori2Leni\"\n\n\"Luan's Laugh Parade\"\n\n\"Song of Silence\"\n\n\"Get Pumped!\"\n\n\"That's Our Kinda Song\"\n\n\"Best Buds\"\n\n\"Best Thing Ever\"\n\n\"What Everybody Wants\"\n\n\"Changing Luna\"\n\n\"What Have I Done?\"\n\nSmarty Pants Challenge[]\n\nDuring a rerun of this episode on July 22, 2020, the viewers had the chance to answer trivia questions related to the episode with the Nickelodeon Screens Up app or on Nickplay.com for a chance to see their name on screen.\n\nAct 1[]\n\nWhat is Luna doing in her room?\n\nFinishing a puzzle\n\nPlaying a board game\n\nPlaying ping pong\n\nRecording a song\n\nWho was singing in the bathroom?\n\nLola\n\nLana\n\nLuna\n\nLeni\n\nWhich sister was just singing in her room?\n\nLana\n\nLuna\n\nLola\n\nLori\n\nWho gives Luna a therapy session?\n\nLeni\n\nLori\n\nMr. Grouse\n\nLisa\n\nWho sings a slow jam duet?\n\nLori and Leni\n\nLola and Lana\n\nLincoln and Lily\n\nLynn and Luan\n\nWho sings about winning?\n\nLori\n\nLuna\n\nLynn\n\nMr. Grouse\n\nWho sings a country song?\n\nLori and Leni\n\nLincoln and Clyde\n\nLynn Sr. and Rita\n\nLily and Lisa\n\nThe Winners\n\nRusty Palooza 026\n\nRoyal Champ 034\n\nLincoln Queen 061\n\nCharles King 085\n\nAct 2[]\n\nLuna was riding in what color car?\n\nPurple\n\nRed\n\nRainbow\n\nPink\n\nWho chest-bumped Luna?\n\nLori\n\nCharles\n\nLynn\n\nLily\n\nLuna becomes a finalist for what show?\n\nAmerica's Next Hitmaker\n\nAmerica's Next Hit Baker\n\nAmerica's Best Knit Maker\n\nAmerica's Top Hip Shaker\n\nWhat color is Luna's new hair?\n\nPurple\n\nBlonde\n\nBrunette\n\nPink\n\nWhat is Luna's new stage name?\n\nFroufrou\n\nGoogoo\n\nLulu\n\nNewNew\n\nWhat's the weather outside?\n\nSunny\n\nCloudy\n\nRainy\n\nSnowy\n\nAccording to Doug, what do focus groups love?\n\nGlitter Cannons\n\nConfetti Blasters\n\nLaser Lights\n\nDisco Balls\n\nThe Winners\n\nLisa Comrade 052\n\nFLIP TRIVIA 014\n\nRITA SAVVY 008\n\nDIAPER FANATIC 003\n\nPhysical distribution[]\n\nThis episode is available on the \"Cooked\", \"The Complete Third Season\", \"The Complete Seasons 1, 2 & 3\", \"Mensonges et vérité\" and \"Saison 3 intégrale\" DVDs.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBeing a musical, this episode features the most songs of any production within the animated series, with 14 (15 if counting the reprise of \"Play It Loud\").\n\n\"A Musical to Remember\" features the most songs within the franchise as a whole, with 20.\n\nThis is the last episode to air in 2018.\n\nThis is the last episode that was produced prior to the firing of Chris Savino to air; \"House of Lies\" and \"Tea Tale Heart\", which were the actual last episodes with these respective criteria, premiered earlier on.\n\nOn April 10, 2020, the soundtrack to this episode was released on Spotify to celebrate National Siblings Day.[3]\n\nThis episode was selected by the staff for the three categories the show was nominated in (Outstanding Children's Animated Series, Outstanding Writing for an Animated Program and Outstanding Musical Direction and Composition) for the Daytime Emmys in 2019, winning both Outstanding Children's Animated Series and Outstanding Writing for an Animated Program.[4]\n\nKyle Marshall,[5] Karen Malach,[6] and Sophia Woodward[7] all consider this episode to be (one of, if not by far) their personal favorite episode.\n\nThis is the first full-length episode to not be written by Sammie Crowley and Whitney Wetta, as well as the first one to be solely directed by Kyle Marshall.\n\nThis is the first episode to be boarded by Diem Doan, albeit with Miguel Puga and Jordan Rosato.\n\nThis episode's animation style was slightly distinctive for most of the episode (e.g Leni being drawn with a more round nose, or Lola's facial features being drawn with thicker lines). This style became permanent as of Season 4.\n\nWhen Chris Savino first announced this episode, he announced it as a rock opera. A rock opera is when a majority of the dialogue (if not all the dialogue) is sung.\n\nThe two people skydiving during the \"Best Thing Ever\" song were Kevin Sullivan and Karla Sakas Shropshire, the writers of this episode.\n\nIn the original storyboard, the Casagrande kids (sans Carlitos) weren't originally going to appear in the Great Lakes City town square, as it was originally going to be a group of random civilians. Miguel Puga also confirmed that the reason why one of them is wearing a mask is that it's a reference to New York City and how some people wear crudely made Mickey Mouse costumes.\n\nLincoln appears on the title card as the microphone Luna is screaming into.\n\nThis episode takes place after \"L is for Love\", as it is revealed that Leni is dating Chaz.\n\nThe car Luna is seen riding in during her song resembles a 1959 Chevrolet Impala 2 door Convertible. This car is also seen in \"Butterfly Effect\" and \"Vantastic Voyage\".\n\nLuna breaks the fourth wall at the end of the episode by winking at the viewers.\n\nShe also did this in \"Roadie to Nowhere\".\n\nDoug Rockwell played a caricature character of himself in the episode while Michelle Lewis was played by a different actress. According to Rockwell in an interview on the Loud Crowd podcast, both he and Lewis had to audition for the roles despite the characters being themselves and Lewis did not play her character because she was unable to convey the personality needed for the character.[8]\n\nHops, Izzy, Bitey, El Diablo, Gary, and Fangs were the only members of the Loud family not seen dancing to \"The Best Thing Ever\". Similarly, the adult family members, the pets, and Carlitos were the only members of the Casagrande family not seen dancing to \"The Best Thing Ever\" either.\n\nFive songs from this episode are featured on The Loud House Mega Music Countdown. Those songs are \"Best Buds\", \"Glam Song\", \"Get Pumped!\", \"Best Thing Ever\" and the #1 song on the list: \"Play It Loud\".\n\nIn \"Dad Reputation\", in the very beginning of the episode, Luna sings a snippet of \"Play it Loud\".\n\nAccording to the promotional video \"Firsts with Baby Lily Loud\", this is the first time Lily has performed a dance routine.\n\nInnuendo: Luna's second song, \"What Everybody Wants\", has a satirical meaning behind it, as all the lyrics blatantly state that the whole point of the song is to make everyone love it.\n\nIrony: Luna, Doug, and Michelle claimed/assumed that Luna playing her original song as herself wouldn't be what everybody wants. However, when Luna sang her song as herself, everybody liked it.\n\nCartoon physics: Luna is squeezed out from the flower on Luan's shirt.\n\nInternational edits[]\n\nIn some dubs, the songs \"Play It Loud\", \"Best Thing Ever\" and \"What Everybody Wants\" are left in English, while all the other ones are translated.\n\nIn the Latin American Spanish dub, Lincoln, Clyde, Lori, Leni, Luna, Lana, Lola and Rita changed their voices in when performing their songs. However, Luan, Lynn, Lucy, Lisa and Lynn Sr. have their normal voices when performing their songs.\n\nReferences[]\n\nReally Loud Music - The title of this episode is a reference to loud music and a pun on the last name of the family \"Loud\".\n\nGuns N' Roses - One of the promotional arts is a parody of the 1987 Guns N' Roses debut album Appetite for Destruction.\n\nSo You Think You Can Dance - Doug telling Luna she must be looking for So You Think You Can Head Bang is a reference to this reality competition show.\n\nCobra Starship - Luna's song \"What Everybody Wants\" contains lyrics and melody similar to this synth-pop band 2011 song \"You Make Me Feel...\".\n\nErrors[]\n\nWhen Luna is watching her siblings sing, her notebook and pen disappears and reappears at some points.\n\nIn the beginning of the episode when Luna sings \"Play It Loud\" her guitar is a lighter shade of purple.\n\nAfter Lana's \"Toilet Jam\" Luna looks at Lola in her room during her \"Glam Song\" but it is usually Lori's and Leni's room.\n\nIn the \"Periodic Table Rap\" the explosion comes from Lisa's and Lily's room but technically it's Luna's and Luan's room.\n\nLuan's unicycle keeps its surreal design after her song is over.\n\nWhen Luna is Lulu, the highlight in her wig keeps switching sides.\n\nDuring the song, \"What Have I Done?\", when Luna sings \"For a moment in the spotlight 'til it's gone\" the second time, the door on the side of America's Next Hitmaker building has a light, a window, and some steps that were not there in all wide shots of the building.\n\nBefore Luna's performance, Lynn is next to Lucy in the crowd. Then during the song, \"Play It Loud\", Lynn is next to Lana.\n\nThroughout the song \"Play It Loud\" near the end of the episode, Luna's paperclip earrings disappear and reappear. Also, Luna's ears aren't pierced in those scenes.\n\nAdditionally, her left paperclip earring appeared in the last few frames during her line, \"I can't be wrong, don't need direction, I can find my way.\"\n\nAs Leni finishes the verse, \"Lori, look at this thread! Tell me whatcha see,\" the eyelashes on one of Lori's eyes disappear as she turns and looks Leni's phone again.\n\nVideos[]\n\nSources[]"
