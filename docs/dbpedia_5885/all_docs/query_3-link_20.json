        "text": "Nonesuch Records released k.d. lang and the Siss Boom Bang’s Sing it Loud on April 12, 2011. Produced by lang and Joe Pisapia, it is the award-winning singer-songwriter’s first record made entirely with a band of her own since the pair of albums with the Reclines that launched her groundbreaking career over 20 years ago.\n\nThis collection of songs reflects the organic, collaborative nature of the sessions, which took place at Pisapia’s Middletree Studios in Nashville. Many of the songs were recorded live in the studio and that energy is palpable. The lead single “I Confess” is one of three songs lang penned with keyboardist Daniel Clarke and Joshua Grange, who plays baritone guitar and dobro. In addition to the original material, Sing it Loud includes a striking version of Talking Heads’ “Heaven.” Pisapia, who plays numerous instruments and serves as the band’s musical director, contributed the title track and co-wrote five songs with lang. Bassist Lex Price (Mindy Smith, Peter Bradley Adams) and drummer/percussionist Fred Eltringham (The Wallflowers) complete the lineup.\n\nSing it Loud is lang’s first studio album since 2008’s Watershed, which debuted in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200. In 2010, she marked the 25th anniversary of her recording debut with Recollection, a career retrospective."
