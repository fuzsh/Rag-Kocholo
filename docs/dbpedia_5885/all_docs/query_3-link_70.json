        "text": "“The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear!”\n\nI probably quote one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies, Elf, several times throughout December when leading worship or just in general conversation. We went out caroling around the Tri-Cities Sunday afternoon to do just what Buddy the Elf suggested. But we weren't trying to spread Christmas cheer. We were spreading the good news of hope, love, joy, and peace due to the best gift of Christmas, Jesus Christ. The act of caroling, or singing joyfully with others, has tremendous power behind it. The same is true when we gather for worship each Sunday morning.\n\nSinging together has been proven to be good for your body and mind. Researchers studied how singing in a group can change a person. They found that after groups of people sang together, they had reduced cortisol levels (stress hormone) and increased levels of immunoglobin A, a protein found in the blood essential for immunity. Singing is literally good for you!\n\nWhen we sing as a group, we are unified in our confession of faith. We are singing together about His amazing grace, that it is well with our soul, and that because of who God is 10,000 reasons to sing His praise. Simultaneously we’re sharing the testimony in our hearts while directing our praise and worship to Him. It’s a testimony the world needs, so we should sing loud for all to hear it.\n\nThere are times our hearts don't feel like singing. It is when we truly need our neighbor to sing for us. A struggling heart in worship or a mind worn out from worry may need to hear the voices of their church family singing boldly to remember the promises of God lifted high in one voice around them.\n\nLet the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and\n\nadmonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit,\n\nsinging to God with gratitude in your hearts. – Colossians 3:16\n\nMusic is also used as a tool for teaching us things. Song lyrics are written in such a way as to get the point across or help us remember a specific thing. Think about how you learned your ABCs, multiplication tables, or even the Presidents of the United States. Words were put to melody to teach you something important that you might need to know at some future point in your life. So, words are put to a melody to help you learn the main point. The same is true for worship songs and carols for the Christmas season.\n\nFor a moment, think about the worship song or hymn you turn to most often in a troublesome time or even when you are feeling incredibly thankful. That song can instantly increase your mood, give hope, or calm your Spirit. God uses rhythm and melody through the power of His Holy Spirit to touch the deepest part of our souls. In return, we give thanks.\n\nSongs allow us to express gratitude while shining His light through melodic praises. The light of hope entered the darkness to give us life, which we celebrate in song. But He never meant for us to keep this light to ourselves. Jesus told us to let our light shine! Singing is just one simple yet powerful way to shine your light.\n\nPositive change happens when we sing together. A song can change our perspective, give us hope, and remind us there is hope. You don’t have to have an American Idol-caliber voice to sing God's praise effectively. You just need a heart for worship. You only need a heart for Him.\n\nDuring this Christmas season, remember to let your light shine. Share the good news! Sing loud, so very loud for all to hear!\n\nGo be a blessing!\n\nApril Bergez\n\nWorship Leader"
