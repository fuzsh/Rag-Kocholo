        "text": "chrisrs,\n\nThis is a common problem. Unfortunately it's not one that is easily solvable without a lot more cooperation than most musicians have the maturity and/or skills to handle.\n\nIt is not unusual in any musical balancing situation for each person to want to hear \"more ME\". Amplified instrumentalists tend to bolster their own volume by simply rotating their volume knobs on instruments and amplifiers and as long as they can hear themselves better, they are satisfied. Drums are naturally loud and hard to play softly unless the drummer is very skillful and WANTS to bring it down.\n\nVocals are difficult to amplify, especially in a small room with loud instruments. Feedback also sets a limit on how much you can boost a mic. The distance you are keeping the mic from your mouth reduces the ability to get more vocal volume before feedback causes havoc.\n\nThe worst part of this is that if you have to go through a struggle each time the group gets together, you are likely to blow your voice out, as well as become very frustrated with the situation. You normally do have to \"eat\" the microphone in order for it to pick your voice up without shouting. So if you don't have your own mic to use that you feel comfortable using in close proximity, perhaps you could get a foam \"pop filter\" for the mic that you wouldn't feel too bad about having really close to your lips. That would only set you back about ten or fifteen bucks and help you to be able to use the mic up close.\n\nThat said, you need the instruments to turn down. End of story. If they don't want to cooperate, then you're kind of out of luck. Ken has told a story about having to warm up his voice in hotel rooms where the other guests would complain if they heard his voice, so he learned to sing into a pillow. This taught him to hear his voice from within his head, and now he is able to listen to his voice internally, which helps him when the monitors are bad, or the band is too loud. I don't know if a week is anywhere near long enough to learn this skill.\n\nSinging with a very bright sound is helpful to enable you to hear your own voice inside your head, but you need about an eighty decibel boost over these instruments, and that is physically impossible without some compromise from the musicians.\n\nI've played in a lot of bands, and it is uncommon for musicians to be willing to turn down like you need these people to do. The band I'm in now is an exception to that. Often, for first set, we play so low that you can hear people's feet shuffling on the dance floor while we are playing. At that level, the vocals tower over the instruments, and we sound like a CD or a record, because the vocals are so dominant. We tend to undersing when the band plays at that level, because our voices in the P.A. system would blow people over backwards relative to the band's sound. That's what you need in your situation. That only comes through cooperatively playing at the proper level.\n\nMost musicians are too wrapped up in their own playing to be willing to turn down for a vocalist. They will try to make you feel inadequate as a \"prima donna\" singer before they will cooperate and give up their own volume.\n\nWhen the band does play at these low levels, including the drums, this will help immensely to preserve your voice. The opposite is true when you have to strain and shout to be heard. It would be better to not be heard than to shout your voice into smithereens prior to the show.\n\nYour voice is somewhat delicate to begin with, and won't stand up to that kind of abuse. You don't do Screamo. Protect your voice. The poor piano, if it's an acoustic piano, will be impossible to hear as well. You are right about the bass player's \"your voice will open up automatically\" nonsense.\n\nOne possible way for you to survive this in stride would be if there is some way that you can plug in a pair of headphones, the kind that seal all the way around your ears, that would monitor the P.A. system, that would at least allow you to hear yourself at a comfortable level. You would sound good to yourself inside the phones and hear yourself at the level you want to be able to hear yourself. If there were also a mic set right against the piano, also plugged into the same system you are monitoring through, then the piano would also be in your phones. Who cares if the band can even hear you, then? They don't care enough to turn down. If they do turn down, then they'll hear you, and if they don't, well they can't hear you now anyway, right? The best part of this as a solution would be that you would not blow your voice out from the rehearsals, you might actually enjoy the rehearsals, and your voice would be in good condition on show day. A lot of mic mixers these days do have a headphone output on them with its own volume knob. If you're lucky, maybe the one in this studio has one. Otherwise you are at the mercy of the monitors (if there are any) or the mercy of the musicians.\n\nMay they have mercy on you, chrisrs.\n\nBob"
