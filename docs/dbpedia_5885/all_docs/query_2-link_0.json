Brown officially brought the group together after his previous band, The Semester, called it quits.[1] He was the former singer and guitarist for local legends The Semester. Frustrated with their lack of mainstream success, The Semester played one final show in the Minneapolis suburb Savage. Drummer Jason Grietens went on to spawn hardcore project Get Young.\n\nSing It Loud was offered a contract with Epitaph Records[2] after playing only seven shows together.[3] Their debut release for Epitaph was an EP produced by Josh Cain of Motion City Soundtrack, released in March 2008.[4][5] The group then toured with We the Kings, This Providence, Ludo, The Morning Light, Valencia, Every Avenue, Hit the Lights, All Time Low, Farewell, Cobra Starship, Forever the Sickest Kids, Single File, Cash Cash, Motion City Soundtrack, and others. A full-length produced by Cain and mixed by Mark Trombino was released on Epitaph on September 23, 2008.[6][7] The album features guest appearances from Justin Pierre of Motion City Soundtrack and Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low.[8] Come Around hit No. 44 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.[9]\n\nThe band spent the summer of 2009 on Warped Tour 2009 on the Hurley Stage.[10]\n\nPat Brown recently announced during a live acoustic performance online that Sing It Loud will be releasing their new album in May. Sing It Loud's upcoming album includes a track called \"Shadows\" that features lead vocals by Kieren Smith and backup vocals by Pat Brown. This will be the first time the two have ever switched roles.\n\nIn April 2010, the band supported Motion City Soundtrack on their headlining US tour.[11] Their next album, Everything Collide, containing 11 tracks it came out May 11, 2010.[12] The album reached No. 28 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.\n\nOn September 14, 2010, after three years as a band, the members decided to go their separate ways. The split was announced via their MySpace page.[13] Their final show was played on October 9, 2010 at Station 4 in their hometown.\n\n2012 reunion show\n\n[edit]\n\nThe band played a reunion show on October 6, 2012 in Minneapolis.
