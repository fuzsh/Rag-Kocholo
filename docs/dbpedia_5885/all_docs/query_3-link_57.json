        "text": "You were there playing in the sunshine\n\nImagination going into overtime\n\nThereâ€²s no way the world could weigh you down\n\nThe story in your eyes\n\nSpoke of all the things you realize and dream\n\nThen the days went by like a freight train\n\nMoving fast through the prairie grain\n\nNo one ever did explain\n\nYou got it on your own\n\nSuch a privilege to see you become\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud\n\nSo everyone knows\n\nWho you are\n\nStood by and I watched you make choices\n\nBit my tongue when I saw you taking chances\n\nWatched you go through a string of romances\n\nStill I never had a doubt\n\nI always knew you knew who you were\n\nWhen the days grow dark with confusion\n\nYou can always give your burdens to the music\n\nAnd even when I'm gone\n\nThere is a song that will play on and on and on\n\nSo, sing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud\n\nSo everyone knows\n\nWho you are\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud\n\nSo everyone knows\n\nWho you are\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud, sing it\n\nSing it loud, sing it, sing it, sing it loud\n\nSo you can remember\n\nWho you are\n\nWriter(s): Joe Pisapia<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
