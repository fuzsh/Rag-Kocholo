Some of us do it well… and well, some of us do it with enthusiasm.\n\nWe sing along with music, we sing alone in the shower, we sing for others and we sing for ourselves. It’s something that has happened since humans could make noise. And for once… FOR ONCE… something we enjoy IS GOOD FOR US!\n\nMaking music helps people feel connected. It gives us a way to relate to one another. It helps improve our mood. It helps us understand emotions when we cannot articulate them. Recent studies even show that music and music therapy help improve memory and cognition.\n\nAction Medicine believes in the power of music… so much so, that we brought music to our home-bound patients. With Dr. Tremblay on guitar and the rest of the Action Medicine team on vocals, we went house to house singing songs of holiday cheer. Were we completely in sync, no. In tune, definitely not. Did we have a wonderful time bonding with our patients who sang along, absolutely.\n\nSo, our dear patients, don’t hold back. Let go of your inhibitions and enjoy belting out whatever moves you. You may be surprised how good you feel afterwards. Even if you’re not a “singer”, happiness is contagious, and we could all use a little more of that.\n\nDr. Mike\n\nBrooke Rieth NP"
