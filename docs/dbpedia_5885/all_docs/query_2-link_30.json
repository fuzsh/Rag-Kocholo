        "text": "December 30, 2013\n\nSo your brainiac son with brilliant career opportunities has decided to be a helioseismologist. Your other son has dropped out and moved to a cabin in the mountains with his potter's wheel and kiln. Your daughter wants to be a costume designer for the opera. Your grandson wants to be a ballet dancer. Relax. They'll be fine. There's a good chance they'll also be very happy. Sing Loud: Memoir of a Life in Music by Steve Bassett is the story of a man who has spent almost fifty years doing exactly what he has wanted to to. He's a singer, songwriter, performer, arranger, bandleader, producer and writer. He's not rich. He's not particularly famous. But he's as happy a person as I have ever known.\n\nI first met Steve forty-four years ago. I was an intern school teacher and he was a student at Atlantic Christian College (now Barton College). We don't see each other very often, but when we do it's as if we'd seen each other only yesterday. Our friendship is based on a mutual understanding that the foundation of the universe is love, unconditional and uncomplicated by dogma and expectations. He expresses this love through his music. He lives to sing and when his audience likes his music, his joy is multiplied. By having him as a friend, my joy is multiplied. See if the love is infectious. Read his book. Listen to his music at www.stevebassettmusic.com. And let those children grow and explore according to dictates of their own hearts."
