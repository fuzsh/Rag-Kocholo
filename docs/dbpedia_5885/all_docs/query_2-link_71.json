        "text": "Singing is in Maggie Wall’s blood. The 17-year-old Owasso vocalist is the daughter of Robin Wall, the current choir director at the Owasso 6th Grade Center, who helped instill a love of singing from an early age.\n\n“I've been in choir since about roughly nine months before I was born,” Maggie says with a laugh. “As I've grown up in church and in school, music has been a big part of my life. I love it so much.”\n\nAs a fifth-grade student at Barnes Elementary School, singing in the choir led by her mother grew Maggie's love of music while simultaneously bringing her people closer together. “Music has really united a lot of my family and it’s something that we can connect and bond over. My grandpa is a music minister, and everyone in my family sings,” she says. “People call us the Von Trapp Family sometimes. Music is a big thing for us.”\n\nMaggie expanded her sense of family in 2019 when she first attended the Oklahoma Summer Arts Institute. “I was really nervous walking in and not knowing people, but the students were really, really welcoming,” she says. “It was just nothing but fun. There was no judgment, anywhere. I remember feeling really welcomed.”\n\n“I'm really looking forward to getting to know new people and being able to get out of my shell, more than I was able to back when I went in 2019,” she says. “Because I'm more confident of a person now. I'm just excited to build relationships with people.”\n\nFor a complete list of OSAI 2021 attending students, click here.\n\nReturn to News & Community."
