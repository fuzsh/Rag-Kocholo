We’ve seen him struggling despite having the best medical team by his side. Sadly, it is clear, that a full recovery from his vocal injury is not possible. We have made a heartbreaking and difficult, but necessary, decision — as a band of brothers — to retire from the touring stage.”\n\nIt was just over a year ago when Aerosmith began what was to be their final tour in Philadelphia.\n\nFollowing a critically acclaimed opening date, the wheels fell off only three gigs in.\n\nTyler suffered damage to his vocal cords, and the trek was suspended first for 30 days and then to 2024.\n\nThis April saw 39 brand new shows announced, including another Wells Fargo Center stop on Sept. 23. That show and all the rest, including what was to have been a New Year’s Eve finale in the band’s hometown of Boston, were scuttled.\n\n“We are grateful beyond words for everyone who was pumped to get on the road with us one last time,” the group said. “Grateful to our expert crew, our incredible team and the thousands of talented people who’ve made our historic runs possible. A final thank you to you — the best fans on planet Earth. Play our music loud, now and always. Dream On. You’ve made our dreams come true.”\n\nReaction throughout the music landscape was swift, with many fellow rock ‘n’ rollers paying homage to the band that got its start in 1970 and set the bar for wild and debaucherous behavior, bitter infighting, substance abuse and subsequent recovery.\n\nAlong the way, Aerosmith delivered some true landmark albums, among them “Get Your Wings,” “Toys in the Attic,” “Rocks” and “Pump.”\n\n“Lyrically, musically, rhythmically, and especially with those monster songs, Aerosmith was unparalleled,” said Motley Crue’s Nikki Sixx. “Their entire catalog is outstanding, but those first five albums were the holy grail for a young, future Nikki Sixx.”\n\n“This has brought a tear to my eye,” Queen’s guitarist Brian May wrote. “Aerosmith have been a huge part of my life, as they have been for millions of other rock fans. Steve Tyler stands as one the greatest vocalists and front men of all time, and it’s heartbreaking that his extraordinary voice has been so damaged. All things must pass, but the inspiring work of Aerosmith will live on, along with the memories of truly one of the most awesome bands to ever hit a stage.”\n\n“Their energy, talent, and passion for music have always been an inspiration to us and countless others,” said New Jersey rockers Skid Row in a collective statement.\n\nSammy Hagar, currently leaning into his time in Van Halen on the Best of All Worlds Tour, spoke from the stage in Michigan the night the news broke.\n\nHe spoke of how they were competitors during his time fronting VH, and that Tyler bowing out gracefully was to be commended.\n\n“It’s a sad thing, but honest to God, my hat goes off to one of the greatest rock ‘n’ roll singers of all time, Mr. Steven Tyler, for saying, ‘I can’t sing anymore. I quit,’ ” Hagar said. “That’s [expletive] honorable. The day I can’t sing anymore, I will [expletive] do the same thing. And that’s what a lot of other [expletives] should have did a long time ago.”\n\nOne of the bands most affected by the news was The Black Crowes. Not only did Aerosmith take them out on one of their first big tours, but the Southern rockers were slated as support for the farewell tour.\n\n“We are shocked and saddened by this news from earlier today,” brothers Chris and Rich Robinson said in a statement. “Nothing but love and respect to our friends in Aerosmith. Heartfelt thanks for all of the incredible memories.”\n\nAnother group who Aerosmith provided an opening slot to at their outset was Guns N’ Roses, and guitarist Slash posted on social media, “Just wanted to take a moment to thank Aerosmith for everything. Without this band, none of this would have been possible.”\n\nVinyl of the Week\n\nKeep an eye on this spot as each week we’ll be looking at new or soon-to-be-released vinyl from a variety of artists. It might be a re-pressing of a landmark recording, special edition or new collection from a legendary act.\n\nThis week, it’s a deluxe edition of the biggest album by one of the most popular bands of the 1980s.\n\nThe police: “Synchronicity 40”\n\nRare is it that a band goes out on top and even rarer on the heels of their finest work.\n\nBut that’s exactly what The Police did when they released “Synchronicity” just before the summer of 1983.\n\nAlso their most successful LP, it went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 as well as a number of other charts around the world, selling over 15 million globally with 8.5 million of which were from States alone.\n\nThe No. 1 smash single “Every Breath You Take” would go on to be the most played song in radio history, with more than 15 million plays.\n\nNow available is the global reissue of “Synchronicity,” released in semi-tandem with the 40th anniversary of the record in multiple vinyl formats, including a four-LP super-deluxe edition boxset on standard black vinyl with a 60-page, lavish color book featuring unseen material, new liner notes and interviews, archive memorabilia and photos, printed inner sleeves and four art print photographs, all housed in a hardback slipcase.\n\nThis reissue has been three years in the making, created with the band’s involvement and endorsement.\n\nThe vinyl box sees the original 10-track LP, a second disc of contemporaneous B-sides and singles bonus tracks while the third features 10 previously unreleased alternate takes, outtakes and instrumentals.\n\nSimilarly, the final vinyl in the set consists of a further 11 previously unreleased alternate takes, outtakes and instrumentals.\n\nFor those who don’t want to splurge for the super deluxe box set, there’s a one-LP limited edition picture disc with the original vinyl tracklist but with a different running order of songs.\n\nA two-LP set includes all of that along with a second disc containing a selection of 7-inch and 12-inch B-sides and live recordings.\n\nIt’s on colored vinyl, with one yellow and one red disc.\n\nThe critical reception for “Synchronicity” was in line with the fan response.\n\nThe album received five Grammy Award nominations in 1984 and won three: Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, Song of the Year for “Every Breath You Take” and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\n\nThe 40th anniversary edition expands on that legacy.\n\nLook for the “Synchronicity 40” online in all of its configurations, and from all respectable retailers who carry vinyl.\n\nTo contact music columnist Michael Christopher, send an email to rockmusicmenu@gmail.com.
