I always felt the guitar playing fox needed a buddy, so along with the accordion playing bear they form a rollicking, foot stomping, mountain loving musical duo. I always envisioned the two of them hung side by side.\n\nThe original artwork is a hand carved linoleum block and was printed using a wooden spoon.\n\nScreen printed by the fine folks over at Ink Lounge Creative.\n\nhttps://inkloungecreative.com\n\n- - -\n\nEdition: 50\n\nAll prints signed & numbered\n\n- - -\n\n18\" x 24\"\n\n3-color screen print\n\n- - -\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Combined shipping cannot be included when ordered with anything mailed flat such as Memories of the Mattertal, The Angry Sea or the two smaller giclees. Those have to mailed separately. Thank you for understanding."
