        "text": "Behold The Beloved is a 5 member Contemporary Christian Rock band from Manheim, PA. With each member coming from a different background, these 5 guys: Sean, Jeff, Jason, Tim and Sheldon mesh together perfectly.\n\n“Our main focus is to be the encouragers as well as help further His kingdom through music”.\n\nBehold the Beloved desires also to bring glory and honor to The One who deserves all. Jesus Christ”.\n\n“We are not here for fame and fortune, we are only here to share the abilities God has given to us and share them with everyone to enjoy and to be encouraged”. “In trusting in God to take care of our needs to keep us moving forward”.\n\nWith their second record “No Surrender” released and top national charting songs in their arsenal, BTB looks to encourage the church to stand firm on the truth of Jesus in a chaotic world."
