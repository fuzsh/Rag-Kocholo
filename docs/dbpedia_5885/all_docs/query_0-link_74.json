        "text": "A: I started writing songs with my friend George Marinelli. We played together in Andrew Gold’s band. He’s been playing second guitar with Bonnie Raitt for 20 years. They rolled through town to play the State Fair a couple summers ago and we got back in the saddle, and we wrote 10 or 11 songs. We thought we should hunt for a deal. I was talking to John Wright, a musician up here who has New Folk Records. I played [him] some stuff, and he sent them to Ken Onstad, the president of the record company. He said, “You need to sign with a major [label].” So in light of that I played rough mixes of [”Primitive Road”] and he said, “I want to sign this.” So I signed a three-record deal with Loud Folk, which is the more aggressive version of New Folk.\n\nA: Way back in ‘71 or ‘72, I was in Florida and a friend played me Burning Spear and Toots & the Maytals. Then I heard an early version of “Concrete Jungle” [by Bob Marley & the Wailers]. I was like “My God, what is this?” Then the music started blowing up and I became infatuated with it. I used the reggae vibe on “Thunder Island” that we did [with Jay Ferguson]. I started writing songs with that vibe.\n\nAfter we played the first set, their road manager came back and said, “The Family Man [Aston Barrett] wants to have a word with you right now, mon.” I go back there and there’s this huge cloud of herb smoke. They asked me if I wanted to open the West Coast dates on that tour. It was a life-changing thing for me.\n\nA: It lets me know that our music has appeal. When we get up in front of people who’ve never even seen us before and they come from all walks of life and rural people, to see that music work like that, it’s something that lasts long after the fair vibe is over. It lets me know we’re hitting on the right cylinders to make it work like that.\n\nA: We’ve rewritten a bunch of things. The opening is different. It’s not as ethereal. I’d say maybe 10% has changed. We’re toying with the closing scene. Some of the play is still in the process. We’re meeting this week to finalize things. We were listening to what Rick was telling us. Some of his advice we took, some of it we didn’t. Instead of “From Behind the Sun,” it’s just “Behind the Sun.” It opens Sept. 21.\n\nA: The songs just roll up. I sit and wait to see what kind of vibe the chords are going to send me. I hang around and wait for that. Thank God that still pops through. I write six or seven pages of lyrics for songs, and I end up using like 12 lines. Ha, ha. As long as it keeps coming, I keep writing. Same with the plays. I wait to see what gets sent to me. I try not to force it. I look at these characters and see what kind of language rolls in. All of a sudden, I can hear it. Sometimes I can barely keep up with it. It’s weird writing songs and working on plays at the same time. I don’t know how that happens. But I’m happy that it does. I try to get out of the way."
