        "text": "Music lovers were asked to rank their favorite songs to belt out while driving\n\nEver since cars came with radios back in the last century people have played and sung along to the music that was coming out of the speakers. It all started with crooners in the late 1930’s, where you could sing along with Bing and Frank. Before that car radios were to big and bulky to have in a car and they wore your battery out so fast you would have to carry along a separate battery just for the radio.\n\nOnce it became standard, there was no stopping it\n\nFM radios weren’t invented until 1952 by the Blaupunkt company, of course at that time AM ruled the radio roost with a mix of music and “radio shows” like ‘Dragnet’ and Jack Benny. The 1950’s saw the arrival of the King himself, Elvis. That is when music radio really started to kick in, with stations dedicated to playing “All Music All The Time” or Top 40, which became a very popular format after a radio program director witnessed kids at his favorite diner playing what he thought were the same 40 songs over and over again until they grew tired of them. He understood that he could have a very successful radio format that did just that, play only the hottest 40 songs in the country over and over.\n\nHere Come The Beatles!\n\nAfter arriving on American shores in 1964, music radio exploded with radio stations vying to be the “Official Beatle Station”. Every town had at least one Top 40 station and some towns had a lot more. Driving in your car listening to the AM radio blaring out your favorite songs became a unifying ritual for young Americans everywhere, and the louder the better. Car radios and speakers got better and louder with every passing year.\n\nFM, No static at all!\n\nOnce FM radios were more standard in cars in the late 60’s and 70’s FM radio stations started to dominate with a better and fuller sound, which of course made singing along a so much better experience for everyone. In that spirit, we present the results of a recent survey that asked music lovers and fans, what are the best ever songs to sing along to in the car. There are some interesting choices, with most coming from the Rock and Pop genre."
