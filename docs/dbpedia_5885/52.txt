Pop-Hot Jazz-Doo Wop-Inspirational

Track 1: Sing It Loud "Sing It Loud," penned by Joe Slyzelia and Kate Voss, is a powerful anthem of self-discovery and resilience. This live performance, recorded in the cozy yet resonant Winneconne High School Library by Dave Jerabek, features a stellar ensemble of musicians. Kate Voss leads with her emotive voice, supported by Wayne Salzman II on drums, Adam Gaines on trumpet, Adam Plamann on baritone sax, Tim George on trombone, Joe Slyzelia on piano and backing vocals, and Dave Jerabek on bass and vocals. The song begins with a reflective tone, exploring themes of manifestation and self-worth, and builds to a bold declaration of chasing dreams and the courage to "sing it loud." The dynamic arrangement showcases the synergy between the rhythm section, the depth of Slyzelia's piano, and the vibrant brass section, creating an uplifting and emotionally charged track. "Sing It Loud" is a testament to overcoming doubt and embracing one's voice, delivering authenticity and life with every note.

Track 2: Paper Bag In their unique rendition of Fiona Apple's "Paper Bag," Fox Menagerie transforms the alternative rock tune into a lively jazz number, infused with the spirited sounds of Dixieland. Recorded live in the intimate setting of the Winneconne High School Library, this cover features the mesmerizing vocals of Kate Voss, who brings a soulful and expressive touch to Apple's poignant lyrics. Wayne Salzman II's dynamic drumming provides a solid foundation, while Adam Gaines's trumpet and Adam Plamann's clarinet weave intricate melodic lines reminiscent of New Orleans jazz. Tim George's trombone adds richness, and Joe Slyzelia's banjo strumming and harmony vocals, along with Dave Jerabek's resonant upright bass and vocal harmonies, create a textured and engaging performance. This jazz-infused cover of "Paper Bag" is both nostalgic and refreshingly original, showcasing Fox Menagerie's talent for reinterpreting contemporary songs through a classic jazz lens.

This digital 45 release by Fox Menagerie, featuring the captivating and soulful Kate Voss, is a must-listen for fans of innovative and heartfelt music. "Sing It Loud" and "Paper Bag" both highlight the band's ability to blend emotional depth with dynamic musical arrangements, creating a unique and memorable listening experience.

About Fox Menagerie:

Fox Menagerie began like many musical projects do, as a seed. Planted in the fertile Fox Valley of WI and lovingly cared for by Dave Jerabek and Joe Slyzelia, this seed grew into a large tree, branches laden with bountiful fruits. And with help from many of the area’s finest musicians, the Fox Menagerie is now an orchard, supplying delicious treats in the form of creatively re-imagined original and cover songs to music lovers far and wide.

Though the ensemble changes in each of their weekly videos (recorded live at the library), the quality is consistently awesome. Musicians in the Fox Menagerie family are decorated with numerous awards, and have been featured on International stages, Presidential Inaugurations, The Voice + The Masked Singer (NBC), Grammy-nominated albums, and recordings with Michael Buble. Additionally, Slyzelia’s original songs which comprise many of the videos, have been featured on NBC, CBS, ABC, and Netflix.

About Kate Voss:

Kate Voss has steeped for 2 decades in vocal performance and earned the title of Seattle-Kobe Vocal Jazz Princess in both 2014 and 2016. In 2016 she also received a Golden Ear Award as Vocalist of the Year from Earshot Magazine. Studying under Greta Matassa, she's had many opportunities to sing all across the US. Sundae often surprises her audiences with a melodica solo and with 10 years as a piano instructor under her belt, it is quite a tasty treat. She appears regularly around Seattle lending her unique sounds to a myriad of styles ranging from weirdo-pop with Mannequin BBQ (who filmed on The Gong Show in 2017) to old-timey jazz with Kate Voss & The Big Boss Band to Western Swing with the Western Bluebirds to retro-country with her sister duo Opal-Thistle Pistol Sisters (where they use a swear jar instead of a tip jar). However, she proves most delightful and captivating when she injects her verve into these Golden Age songs as "Her voice nails the authenticity of this era…” —JazzTimes
