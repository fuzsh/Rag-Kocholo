        "text": "Can you tell the difference between the two aircraft pictured above? Most people canât. Often confused with one another, CIAâs A-12 OXCART and the US Air Forceâs SR-71 Blackbird are actually two different aircraft.\n\nCIA developed the highly secret A-12 OXCART (above right) as the U-2 spy planeâs successor, intended to meet the nationâs need for a very fast, very high-flying reconnaissance aircraft that could avoid Soviet air defenses. It became operational on November 12, 1965.\n\nNot only did the A-12 prove its worth during its short operational life, but the overall OXCART project produced the second-longest-lasting aerial reconnaissance platform in US intelligence history: the SR-71.\n\nThe SR-71 Blackbird (above left) was the Air Forceâs two-seat follow-on version of the OXCART. In fact, the A-12 OXCARTâs unique design and characteristics became the foundation for three other versions of supersonic aircraft that Lockheed built for CIA and the Air Force: the YF-12A, the M-21, and of course, the SR-71.\n\nIn the end, the OXCARTâs engineering innovations produced the two fastest, highest-flying, piloted jet aircraft ever (the A-12 and SR-71) and pioneered stealth technology that would later be adapted for use in subsequent aircraft.\n\nPiloted by Mele Vojvodich, the first BLACK SHIELD flight took off in a torrential downpour just before 1100 local Okinawa time on May 31, 1967. The A-12 had never operated in heavy rain before, but weather over Vietnam was forecast as satisfactory, so the flight went ahead.\n\nVojvodich flew the planned route at 80,000 feet and Mach 3.1, refueled immediately after taking off and during each of two loops over Thailand, and safely touched down at Kadena with a total flight time of three hours and 39 minutes.\n\nThe intelligence mission was a resounding success: after detailed examination of nearly a mile of film that was collected, photo interpreters found no surface-to-surface missiles that might threaten US and allied military forces in the South and assessed the status of 70 of the 190 known surface-to-air missile sites and nine other priority targets.\n\nContrary to some published accounts, Chinese or North Vietnamese radar did not track the aircraft during the Vojvodich flight, nor did North Vietnam fire any missiles at it. On subsequent missions in October 1967 and January 1968, North Vietnam fired SAMs at BLACK SHIELD A-12s three times but caused damage only once.\n\nThe OXCART has a documented maximum speed and altitude of 2,208 MPH at 90,000 feet, set during a test in 1965, while the SR-71 holds the official speed record for a piloted operational jet aircraft of 2,193 MPH, set on July 28, 1976. On the same date the Blackbird set an official world altitude record of 85,069 feet.\n\nUnofficially, of course, pilots of both aircraft have anecdotal stories indicating the numbers of both aircraft may be higher, and some SR-71 test reports show that the aircraft surpassed the official records for speed and altitude.\n\nNevertheless, both the A-12 OXCART and the SR-71 Blackbird are regarded as pioneering achievements in aeronautical engineering and the pinnacle of aviation technology during the Cold War.\n\nThe A-12 arrived at CIA Headquarters aboard five wide-load trucks, and it required two enormous cranes to lift the 39,000-pound airframe onto its three-pylon mount to be assembled in 10 days. The pylons hold the airframe in an operational flight attitude at 85,000-90,000 feetâits nose up 8 degrees and airframe rolled 9 degrees to the left. Engineering specifications insure that the airframe as mounted could withstand winds of up to 130 mph.\n\nThe site also commemorates two CIA A-12 pilots, Walt Ray and Jack Weeks, killed in 1967 and 1968, respectively. For the CIA workforce, the A-12 is a symbol of the successful collaboration of the Intelligence Community, the Defense Department, and private industry to create a national strategic asset that our adversaries never dreamed possible."
