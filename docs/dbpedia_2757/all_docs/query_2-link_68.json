        "text": "From a young age, Kelley was bright and athletic. She excelled in school, ultimately earning a Florida “Bright Futures” scholarship due to her academic achievements. Anybody who knew her, however, would agree that she reserved a special love and talent for athletics, where she excelled in soccer, cross-country, and track; ultimately setting several school records, competing at the state-level, and always competing at the highest levels.\n\nUpon graduating from Sarasota High School in Florida, Kelley briefly attended Elon College before settling at Rollins College in Winter Park, FL. She completed her Bachelor’s in Psychology and went to work for Mizuno USA Running. She immediately made a name for herself at the company and was a valuable member of the Mizuno brand for the next 18 years in several different locations and capacities.\n\nBut, more than anything, Kelley was passionate about raising and supporting her four children George, Millie, Frances, and Luisa. She encouraged their growth in academics, athletics, and fostered a well-cultivated love for competition. Her love for her husband and children was always at the forefront of her life; she would spare no effort or expense to ensure her family was loved and provided for, first and always. Kelley was, and forever will be, loved by her family and friends.\n\nKelley was preceded in death by her father, Ronald Johnson; her grandparents, Arnold & Arlette Johnson and Herbert & Jean Hamilton. She is survived by her husband, Matthew, and their four children, George, Millie, Frances, and Luisa; her mother and stepfather, Sally and Thomas Reed; her brother and sister-in-law, Dustin and Sirese Johnson; her nephew and niece, Jack and Hattie Johnson, as well as all of her extended family members will miss her dearly.\n\nA visitation will be held from 5pm-7pm on Monday, November 21, 2022 at Roper and Sons South Chapel (3950 Hohensee Dr.)\n\nA funeral service is scheduled for 11:00am on November 22, 2022 at Trinity United Methodist Church."
