        "text": "Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson, an American aeronautical engineer, was born Feb. 27, 1910. Johnson came to head up the \"Skunk Works\" installation and design team at Lockheed, which was given great autonomy in designing cutting-edge aircraft. Johnson is given most of the credit for designing many of Lockheed's famous aircraft, including the SR-71 Blackbird, between 1937 and his retirement in 1975. Fresh out of the University of Michigan in 1933, he was asked by Lockheed to do wind-tunnel tests on their new twin-engine Model 10 Electra, the first all-metal aircraft (second image). Johnson found the aircraft unstable and recommended that a double-tail be substituted. Surprisingly, Lockheed agreed, and Johnson’s career was off and running. In 1937, Earhart posed with Johnson (third image) and then took off in her twin-tailed Electra for her ill-fated flight around the world. The crash and disappearance of her plane is believed to be the result of fuel shortage and unrelated to the aircraft’s design.\n\nJohnson's first real challenge came in 1937 when he was asked to design a fighter aircraft for the U.S. Army Air Corps, with the war impending. The first Lockheed P-38 Lightning rolled off the lines in 1939, with twin booms and twin stabilizers, the two engines on the booms and the crew and the guns in a separate nacelle between (fourth image). With this unusual configuration, the P-38 proved adept as a fighter, a fighter bomber, and an aerial reconnaissance aircraft. Over 10,000 were built before the end of the War in 1945.\n\nAnother superlative aircraft that Johnson designed was the Lockheed P-104, soon relabeled the F-104 Starfighter. Introduced in 1958, it was intended to be more worthy rival for the Soviet MIG-15, and it was. The F-104, powered by a single turbojet engine, was highly maneuverable and capable of reaching extreme altitude and supersonic speeds. It is also a beautiful machine. Lockheed built more than 2500 of them for a dozen different air forces. Many are still flying.\n\nThe most famous aircraft that Johnson designed were the U-2 and the SR-71. The U-2 was designed for just one purpose - to cruise at 70,000 feet, where no aircraft has any business flying, and take pictures (sixth image). To achieve this, many sacrifices were made, so that the aircraft was very difficult to fly, especially at lower altitudes, and safety margins were very slim. But it was a great spy plane, until Gary Powers and his U-2 were shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960. Lockheed continued producing U-2s until 1989, and they are still flying. Or so they tell me."
