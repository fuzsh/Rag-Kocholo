Who is the most famous person from each and every county in the Great Lakes State?\n\nFrom military heroes to movie stars, Michigan and its 83 counties have produced many a-celebrity. That sometimes made this a hard question to answer but we did it.\n\nOf course, you know Madonna is a Michigander and so is Kid Rock, but maybe you would be surprised to learn the name of the most famous person from Monroe County.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we decided to feature people born in each Michigan county. While many others spent extensive time in our state, we favored natives for this list.\n\nYes, obviously, some counties have served as the birthplace for bigger names than others. That just means you will learn some new names when browsing through our list. Maybe you will even learn something new about the county in which you reside.\n\nDo you disagree with one of our picks for \"most famous\"? If so, let us know. We would love to chat about it in the comments section. Trust me, we chatted about this A LOT in our newsroom.\n\nAlcona County\n\nNational Baseball Hall of Fame member Hazen \"Kiki\" Cuyler played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Chicago Cubs, the Cincinnati Reds and the Brooklyn Dodgers during his 17-year Major League career. According to the National Baseball Hall of Fame website, during Cuyler's career, he was \"one of Major League Baseball's greatest hitters.\" The right fielder, born in Harrisville, Michigan on Aug. 30, 1898, helped bring home a World Series win for the Pirates in 1925.\n\nFrom the archives of Enee Abelman, used with permission\n\nAlger County\n\nGeorge Snow Hill, an artist known for his murals, was born Nov. 13, 1898 in Munising, Michigan. Spending time in Paris for a fellowship in the 1920s, he later spent time in New York and Florida. Some of his restored works are on display at the Tampa International Airport.\n\nCollier's Magazine cover from Oct. 3, 1908 by Clara Elsene Peck\n\nAllegan County\n\nArtist Clara Elsene Peck was born April 18, 1883 in Allegan, Michigan. Peck specialized in illustrations depicting women and children. Her work was used in many magazines as well as books, such as \"A Lady of King Arthur's Court\" and \"In the Border Country.\"\n\nBy vagueonthehow [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nAlpena County\n\nActor Michael Bailey Smith was born Nov. 2, 1957 in Alpena, Michigan. Smith's acting career began in 1989 when he won a role in \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.\" His other credits include television shows \"Charmed\" and \"My Name is Earl,\" as well as the movies \"Men in Black II\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes.\"\n\nAntrim County\n\nMajor League pitcher Roger Mason was born Sept. 18, 1957 in Bellaire, Michigan. Mason played for seven different Major League teams, starting with the Detroit Tigers in 1984. Mostly a relief pitcher, he retired in 1994.\n\nPhoto by Kevin Hagen | MLive.com\n\nArenac County\n\nIva Ousterhout is the Iva behind the most famous chicken dinners in Sterling, Michigan. Iva's Chicken Dinners has served up the goods since 1938.
