        "text": "There are not many heroes in the engineering world, especially not in project management. But one man, Kelly Johnson, is perhaps the most famous and most respected engineer in the aircraft industry. He created the Lockheed Skunk Works, designed and built some of the most famous aircraft in history, and almost always finished projects on time and on budget. That is why he is just as revered for his project management methodologies as he is for the technical coolness of the airplanes he built.\n\nProject Management Excellence that Created Famous Aircraft\n\nKelly Johnson had many titles, but he was the lead project manager for Lockheed when designing some of the most iconic aircraft ever flown. He contributed to over 28 different aircraft, including:\n\nModel 9D Orion: The first airliner with retractable landing gear\n\nP-38 Lightning: A twin nacelle, a single-seat fighter that was the first to go over 400 mph\n\nConstellation: A family of pressurized airliners\n\nF-80 Shooting Star: the first successful American jet fighter\n\nC-130 Hercules: Military transport still in production since 1954\n\nF-104 Starfighter: the first Mach 2 capable jet fighter\n\nU-2: High altitude reconassense plane\n\nSR-71 Balckbird: A Mach 3 capable spy plane\n\nF-117A Nighthawk: The first stealth fighter\n\nBeing a contributor on any of those aircraft would make you famous. Kelly Johnson led the design of all of them. But he is not just famous for all the firsts he accomplished with each aircraft. Engineers look up to and try to emulate him because Johnson produced so many breakthrough projects on schedule and on budget. Yes, he was technically strong, making many breakthroughs in the wind tunnel or with advanced materials.\n\nIt was his project management skills that set him apart. Many credit him for creating the KISS principle's ideas: Keep it Simple Stupid. And he lived by that concept with his simple motto: \"Be quick, be quiet, and be on time.\" He formalized how they got so much done without going over budget with \"Kelly's 14 Rules.\" Although they were written for military projects and predated modern computer-aided engineering, database-driven software, advanced manufacturing, and modern material science, if you apply a few tweaks, they can make a huge difference for any modern project, and they apply across industries.\n\nIn this post, we will take a detailed look at the first five of his rules because they are the most applicable today. Then we will briefly walk through the remaining nine and see how they apply to modern product development.\n\nThe First Five of Kelly's 14 Rules Applied to Modern Project Management\n\nJohnson's first five rules are still the most important on the list, and we use modified versions of them on every project at PADT. As we go through them, you will notice they all focus on keeping headcount down, giving control to the decision makers close to the project, and keeping things simple. We will scratch the surface, but the best way to get an in-depth insight into the thinking behind these rules is to read his autobiography, \"More than May Share of It All.\"\n\nRule 1: The Skunk Works manager must be delegated practically complete control of his program in all aspects. He should report to a division president or higher\n\nMany companies form their own \"skunk works, \"give them clever names, assign difficult projects, then interfere their way to failure. Without empowerment, teams get bogged down, decisions take too long, and scope changes.\n\nIf you want to create a special team that focuses on challenging projects, senior management must give the manager of that group complete control, and they need to report to the person in charge of the entire organization. Even though it is unsaid, you need a fantastic leader for this rule to work. Someone who knows project management, understands the technology, and can make the right decisions to achieve the goals of the project.\n\nIn today's engineering world, this type of empowerment is rare, and it shows in projects going over budget and finishing behind schedule. Technology makes it easy to micromanage, and larger companies tend to want to involve all the \"stakeholders\" in on the decisions. Organizations are often structured to avoid making mistakes instead of how to do amazing things.\n\nInstead of coming up with a clever name that reminds people of the Skunk Works, management needs to find a strong leader who they can trust, then trust them.\n\nRule 2: Strong but small project offices must be provided both by the military and industry.\n\nIn Johnson's day, project management was done by something called the project office. Both the customer (for the Skunk Works it was a branch of the military) and the company doing the work had project offices that watched budget and schedule, tracked milestones and deliverables, and made decisions when needed. In today's integrated teams, project managers are embedded with the rest of the team and are seldom a seperate organization. But there are still two important takeaways from this rule.\n\nThe first is that the \"office\" needs to be \"strong but small.\" Regardless of how it is structured today, you need to limit the number of people doing project management and empower them to know what is happening and control specifications, deliverables, schedules, and budgets.\n\nThe second critical part of the rules is not explicit but implied. Both the customer and the company doing the work need project teams. The rules points to the military, but it is even more important when the customer is a commercial company. Too often, the customer wants to hand off project management to their vendor to keep costs down. But without a small and strong team in both places, projects can easily get off track.\n\nRule 3: The number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner. Use a small number of good people (10% to 25% compared to the so-called normal systems).\n\nDo you see a theme here? Small and capable. And we are not talking half. We are talking one-tenth to one-quarter as compared to what you would normally need. He also comes out and says what he avoids in a couple of other rules - you have to have good people.\n\nProjects get large and unmanageable because one solution to getting more work done is to put more people on it. However, Johnson learned early on that you can get more done with a few top performers. So he built teams that worked well together that could get more done than other companies even thought possible. The predecessor to the SR-71, the A-12, went from project funding to first flight in just over two years, using 1960's technology. This amazing schedule was accomplished because of such a small team of experts.\n\nYou may not be able to put superstars on your project, but you can limit the number of people and work to turn your team into superstars.\n\nRule 4: A very simple drawing and drawing release system with great flexibility for making changes must be provided.\n\nThis rule may be the most impacted by technology. And because of that, many people treat the problem of design documentation as solved. But it is not solved. Many companies don't have a drawing release and engineering change management system in place. And the bigger organizations have just digitized cumbersome and inflexible manual processes.\n\nYes, when Kelly Johnson designed the F-104, he was probably surrounded by rows of drafting tables obscured by cigarette smoke and staffed by men with buzz cuts and short-sleeved white dress shirts drawing lines on paper. We now have amazing software that automates and simplifies the process. We can define more complex geometry in less time.\n\nHowever, none of that matters if the documentation produced by Computer Aided Design (CAD) does not produce drawings that are simple enough to use effectively and go through a release process that tells manufacturing what drawings to use. And most importantly, it needs to be easy to make documented changes. Nothing slows or stops design changes more than a cumbersome change management system.\n\nRule 5: There must be a minimum number of reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly.\n\nSpeaking of documentation, if drawing are documentation of what you need to build, reports document why the design is the way it is. Big, long reports take time and almost never get read. So teams will often stop doing reports. Johnson stressed the need to keep reports to a minimum, not eliminate them.\n\nImportant work, especially decisions, must be recorded and it is the role of project management to define what reports are needed and what details. Most importantly, the project team needs to make sure the reports that are required get done. Holding engineers accountable for writing reports is a thankless job, but an important one.\n\nJohnson's Other Nine Rules for Better Project Management\n\nThe first five rules are must-haves for any project, and they address many of the high level issues teams face when developing any product. The remaining nine focus more on government contracts or aircraft design. So we will say a few words on each.\n\nRule 6: There must be a monthly cost review covering not only what has been spent and committed but also projected costs to the conclusion of the program.\n\nHow often you look at costs will vary based on the type of project you are managing. It may be daily or weekly. The important takeaway here is to keep track of current spend and also keep updating the projected financials. If you don't, you will find budget problems when it is too late to fix them.\n\nRule 7: The contractor must be delegated and must assume more than normal responsibility to get good vendor bids for subcontract on the project. Commercial bid procedures are very often better than military ones.\n\nThis rule is a win if you are already doing commercial product development. For non-military applications, a good way to adapt this rule is to focus on having project management take responsibility for getting good bids from vendors and use a good process.\n\nRule 8: The inspection system as currently used by the Skunk Works, which has been approved by both the Air Force and Navy, meets the intent of existing military requirements and should be used on new projects. Push more basic inspection responsibility back to subcontractors and vendors. Don't duplicate so much inspection.\n\nIt is easy to ignore this rule because it points out military requirements, and inspection is so critical for aircraft. But it does apply to any project. You should put an inspection system in place for the final product, but push as much basic inspection back on your supply chain so you are getting good components up front and reduce your inspection burden.\n\nRule 9: The contractor must be delegated the authority to test his final product in flight. He can and must test it in the initial stages. If he doesn't, he rapidly loses his competency to design other vehicles.\n\nAgain, this looks to apply to aircraft but is just as valid for a kid's toy as it is for a new supersonic fighter. Your team needs to learn from testing the product, and even though your customer may want to do all the testing. Project management needs to build testing by the design team into the project schedule.\n\nRule 10: The specifications applying to the hardware must be agreed to well in advance of contracting. The Skunk Works practice of having a specification section stating clearly which important military specification items will not knowingly be complied with and reasons therefore is highly recommended.\n\nThis one is long and more difficult to unpack. But if you think about it, what Johnson is saying is to get specifications up front, and if you are not going to design to or meet some of the specs, let the customer know why. At PADT, putting our version of this rule in place has been one of the most important ways we meet customer expectations. You can't quote accurately without details specifications, and your customers won't be happy if you don't communicate, which you can and can not meet.\n\nRule 11: Funding a program must be timely so that the contractor doesn't have to keep running to the bank to support government projects.\n\nGovernment funding may have been a concern in Johnson's day, but it has been replaced by commercial customers who push long payment terms down on subcontractors and vendors, then pay invoices late or reject them for technicalities. From a project management standpoint, there is not much you can do other than making sure invoicing is timely and accurate. The project team can also work closely with the business development team to build shorter therms or upfront payment into the project proposal.\n\nRule 12: There must be mutual trust between the military project organization and the contractor, the very close cooperation and liaison on a day-to-day basis. This cuts down misunderstanding and correspondence to an absolute minimum.\n\nThis rule kind of reinforces Rule 2. Once you have small but strong project offices, you need to have them communicate regularly. Day-to-day makes sense for larger undertakings, but once a week may be a better fit for smaller projects. The important thing is to make sure there is no delay in sharing important information, good or bad.\n\nRule 13: Access by outsiders to the project and its personnel must be strictly controlled by appropriate security measures.\n\nThis was obviously a rule for the Skunk Works because they were working on secret technology that gave the US a competitive advantage on the battlefield. Still, even if you are working on a commercial product, there is not much value added by giving access to outsiders. Put the proper measures in place and stick to them.\n\nRule 14: Because only a few people will be used in engineering and most other areas, ways must be provided to reward good performance by pay not based on the number of personnel supervised.\n\nThis rule is a throwback to the corporate habit of paying people based on the number of people that reported to them. Although that is not as common these days, if you want the best managers, you need to make sure you compensate them based on what their teams accomplish and not the size of their teams.\n\nThe Tools and Processes May Have Changed, But Basic Project Management Has Not\n\nPeople still marvel at the aircraft Kelly Johnson helped bring to life. And many engineers operate under some of his 14 Rules today without even knowing they are doing so. That is because he got it. Under the pressure of the cold war, he took his understanding of technology and human nature and applied them to accomplish great things with outstanding teams.\n\nWhen we started PADT back in 1994, we pulled Johnson's biography off the shelf and read through the rules. Bits of what he said are woven into our founding philosophy. And we referred to it over and over again through the years as we grew. You can see its fingerprint all over our product development process.\n\nIf you are starting to plan your next simulation or product development project, why not give PADT a call? We can help by supplementing your team and providing resources and expertise where needed. Our team is made up of those excellent engineers Johnson valued, we use a flexible document management system, and we communicate openly and regularly with your project management team. Give us a call at 480.813.4884 or shoot an email to consult@padtinc.com to get us involved early in the process, help out on a project that is a bit off the rails, or to just talk about the execution of complex engineering programs.\n\nWe don't claim to be Kelly Johnsons, but we are smart enough to learn from the best. Let's do some amazing things together, just like he and his teams did."
