        "text": "On January 16, 2020 our Heavenly Father welcomed John Kelly Johnson home. John was born in Los Alamitos, California on July 11, 1972 to Wayne and Shirley Johnson. John had a magnetic personality. He never met a stranger. You couldn’t help but love him and his quirky and unique sense of humor. John was kind, generous, considerate and selfless. He truly had a servant’s heart. John enjoyed camping, fishing, shooting, riding motorcycles, working on old cars and trucks, welding, creating memories with his family and friends, picking on people, riding quads, gardening, helping others, snuggling, talking about the future with DeLacy, FaceTiming his granddaughters, listening to music, collecting antiques, talking to God and going to church. John’s love for adventure and anything with wheels led him to his career path in the automotive field, most of which he was general manager at Firestone in several different locations where he traveled often for the company. John was preceded in death by his mother Shirley, his stepmother Madelyn, three of his siblings Carl (Bert), Jeremy, and Anna. He is survived by his fiancée DeLacy; his dad Wayne; his adopted moms Peggy and Wilma; his siblings Daniel, David, Larry, and Amanda; his children Lacey and Ciana; his stepchildren Chelsie, Travis, Carmen and Meagan; his grandchildren Jerimiah, Jenesis, Jenica, Shakura, Kaiari, and Felicity. Although John will be greatly missed, we are comforted knowing that he is in heaven. His legacy lives on with his family and friends whom he loved deeply. A celebration of his life will be Thursday, January 23, 2020 at 6:00 PM at his home church; Victory City Church, 8975 Double Diamond Pkwy., Reno, Nevada 89521.
