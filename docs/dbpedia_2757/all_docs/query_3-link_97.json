        "text": "(ran SS edition of Metro & State)\n\nSarah Marjorie Campbell Johnson, one of the founders of the city of Seminole, died Wednesday (May 19, 1999) at home. She was 93.\n\nWhile many people regarded her late husband, Jesse Wilder Johnson, as the prime mover in the establishment of Seminole and many of its businesses, longtime friends of Mrs. Johnson said she deserved credit, too.\n\n\"She was as active as her husband in everything,\" said Martha Mohn, a Seminole civic leader and a friend of Mrs. Johnson since 1956. \"When Jesse was named the first Mr. Seminole (in 1965), I considered her to be Mrs. Seminole.\" Mohn said.\n\n\"On a personal note,\" Mohn continued, \"she will be remembered by many folks for the wonderful hush puppies she made for the weekly Friday night fish fries sponsored by the Kiwanis Club. They were legend.\"\n\nRussell Stewart, Seminole's first mayor, from 1970-72, worked closely with Marjorie and Jesse Johnson. Stewart and his wife were longtime neighbors of the Johnsons.\n\n\"She was a fine Christian woman who never used a harsh word with anyone,\" said Stewart, 87, who now lives in Jacksonville.\n\nMrs. Johnson was born Aug. 20, 1905, to Pinellas pioneers John A. and Clara Meares Campbell in the Campbell Homestead at the corner of what is now Seminole and Johnson boulevards.\n\nMrs. Johnson attended Seminole Elementary School when it was a one-room schoolhouse. With her father's help as a trustee, a new building was erected in 1915. Today, that white, brick building is the music department for the present-day school. Five generations of the Campbell and Johnson families have attended the school.\n\nBefore her 1925 marriage to Jesse Johnson, Sarah Marjorie Campbell attended Florida State College for Women for two years. In 1949, the Johnsons turned their efforts to converting a saltwater bayou into a freshwater lake, now known as Lake Seminole. And in later years, they helped found Sylvan Abbey Memorial Park in Clearwater, where Mrs. Johnson will be interred with her husband.\n\nThe Johnsons established Seminole Nurseries, the Bank of Seminole and an A&P grocery store on the Campbell Homestead property. They also built the city's first library and Seminole Mall, in which on Nov. 15, 1970 _ after several unsuccessful tries _ the city of Seminole was incorporated.\n\nWhen the family sold the land from the first Seminole library (on Johnson Boulevard) last year, about $40,000 of the proceeds went toward a new organ at Seminole United Methodist Church, where Mrs. Johnson and her husband were longtime members.\n\n\"I've only known her six years,\" said Seminole United Methodist Pastor John Denmark. \"But, she was a sweet spirit. She was in church when others couldn't find the time to come. When she saw we needed a new organ, she stepped right up.\"\n\nOver the years, Mrs. Johnson was devoted to many causes: as a benefactor for the All Children's Hospital Dream Builders; a member of the Ladies of Kiwanis for both the Clearwater and Seminole clubs; and numerous volunteer roles in her church including as chairwoman of the Altar Guild and Sunday school superintendent. She was also president of the United Methodist Women, Seminole PTA, Pinellas Seminole Women's Club, Seminole Civic Club and more. A Kiwanis scholarship was established in her name for Seminole area children and one was also set up at Seminole United Methodist Church. A third scholarship in her honor goes to divinity students at Duke University.\n\nThe Civic Club was perhaps Mrs. Johnson's favorite group, said her daughter, Marilyn Johnson Mohney. The Johnsons were charter members of the club that was organized nearly 64 years ago. It was the Civic Club that worked tirelessly, said Mohney, to get the voters to approve a referendum that finally made Seminole a city in 1970. \"We helped too by passing out leaflets, holding informational meetings and getting out the vote,\" Mohney said.\n\nSurvivors include a son, Richard C., Clearwater; three daughters, Marilyn J. Mohney, Seminole, Christine J. Sebring, Franklin, N.C., and Lynda J. Whitaker, Gainesville; a sister, Lois C. Brown, Largo; nine grandchildren, R. Kelly Johnson, Clearwater, Alan B. Mohney, Largo, J. Andre Mohney, Tallahassee, Beverly Mohney Griseck, Gainesville, Sarah Mohney Miller, Seminole, William J. Sebring and Bradley R. Sebring, both of Woodstock, Ga., John B. Sebring, Indianapolis, and Nathan C. Whitaker, Jacksonville; 15 great-grandchildren; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nVisitation will be Sunday from 2-4 and 6-8 p.m. at Lewis W. Mohn Funeral Home, 9700 Seminole Blvd. Funeral services will be Monday at Seminole United Methodist Church with burial following at Sylvan Abbey Memorial Park, Clearwater. Donations may be made to Seminole United Methodist Church, Florida United Methodist Children's Home or Hospice of the Florida Suncoast.\n\n_ Information from Times files was used in this report."
