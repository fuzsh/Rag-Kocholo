Omar Infante should be back to bolster the bench in mid-August. Wren feels their returns will be as big a boost as a big trade at the deadline. When Hudson returns, the Braves will have a surplus of starting pitching but that's a problem Wren is happy to take on. The Braves aren't prepared to trade Vazquez, who has been one of their top performers in the first half. Where they might look to make a deal is with second baseman Kelly Johnson, who is in a reserve role for now. -- Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\n27 years old with two very good seasons 2007-2008, but having a down year. The fact he bats lefty is a plus."
