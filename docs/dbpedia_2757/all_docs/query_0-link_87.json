        "text": "2007 – Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al-Baker warns Airbus that he will order Boeing 787 Dreamliners if a better design for the A350 is not forthcoming. A month later, al-Baker drops the threat after Airbus cedes to his demands and eventually orders 80 of the new jets.\n\n2002 – The crew of Ryanair Flight 296, a Boeing 737-800 (EI-CSA), while taxiing to a gate at London Stansted Airport evacuates the plane after fire personnel report smoke and fire billowing from the right engine. All 117 passengers are evacuated in 90 seconds, but flight attendants have difficulty opening the doors without assistance. Without proper guidance, several passengers evacuate over the right wing not knowing that’s where the fire is suspected. An investigation reveals there had been no fire, and UK aviation safety regulators recommend several changes to evacuation procedures and training at Ryanair.\n\n1993 – The US Air Force begins dropping supplies over wartorn Bosnia."
