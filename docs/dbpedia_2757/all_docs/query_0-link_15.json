        "text": "Born February 27, 1910, Ishpeming, Michigan. Began his distinguished career with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in 1933. Serving initially as flight test engineer and aerodynamicist, he participated in the development of such aircraft as the Electra series which achieved so many aeronautical records during the late 1930s. Elevated to chief research engineer in 1938. Of the more than 40 designs which bear his mark, 19 were the sole creation of his genius. Among his most outstanding designs were the P-38 Lightning, F-80 Shooting Star, the Constellation, F-104 Starfighter, U-2 reconnaisance aircraft and the contemporary triple sonic SR-71."
