        "text": "Career\n\nClarence L. Johnson designed some of America's most advanced airplanes. Lockheed hired Johnson in 1933. As an engineer for Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, Johnson served as Right test engineer, stress analyst, weight engineer, and performed countless aerodynamic tests with wind tunnels. During his tenure as chief research engineer fohnson created the Skunk Works, a division within Lockheed that designed advanced, secret military Projects. It became associated with some of Lockheed’s most impressive achievements in aviation.\n\nThe boss sent Johnson to the University of Michigan to test a model of the aircraft in the university’s wind tunnel, where Johnson had recently worked as a student. After many trials Johnson solved the problem of instability by adding a double vertical stabilizer to the tail. Lockheed included the idea in its early metal aircraft. It appeared as a three-tail design in Lockheed’s famous Constellation, which remained in production until the mid-1950s.\n\nHaving established the administration and production facilities, called \"Skunk Works\", Johnson and his crew set about to create the first American operational jet fighter. The experimental version, the XP-80, first flew at Edwards Air Force Base on January 8, 1944, at speeds over five hundred miles per hour. Johnson had fulfilled his promise to deliver a jet airplane within 180 days. Production models did not come off the assembly line until 1948, however, when the plane was redesignated the F-80. Johnson had also made his mark on non-fighter aircraft.\n\nJohnson’s last and most difficult project was in designing the SR-71, a high-altitude, long-range strategic reconnaissance airplane that repeatedly set speed and distance records. This airplane was the first to incorporate “stealth “ technology to avoid or lessen radar detection."
