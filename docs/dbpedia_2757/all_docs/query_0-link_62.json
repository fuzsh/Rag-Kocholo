        "text": "ISHPEMING — A dedication ceremony of the Three Sons of Ishpeming Monument was held on Friday morning at the Ishpeming Heritage Plaza.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet, “The city of Ishpeming dedicates this memorial, which has been erected to honor three historically prominent figures. Each of them were born and spent part of their lives growing up in the city of Ishpeming. It is important to recognize those who have come before us and have demonstrated their commitment to making the American Dream a reality. Furthermore, their contributions all have had lasting and historical significance for our country.”\n\nThe Ishpeming Heritage Plaza is located along Hematite Drive, and was coordinated by many local businesses, Ishpeming officials and volunteers. Mike Lempinen, a recently retired architectural designer from Marquette, is the creator of the memorial.\n\nThe three sons statue features Glenn T. Seaborg, Clarence Leonard “Kelly” Johnson and John D Voelker.\n\nSeaborg, a chemist who discovered and investigated 10 transuranium elements earning him a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951.\n\nAccording to the pamphlet, “Seaborg spent most of his career as an educator and research scientist at the University of Berkeley serving as a professor, and, between 1958-61 as chancellor. He advised U.S. presidents from Harry S. Truman to Bill Clinton on nuclear policy.”\n\nWhile aeronautical engineer Clarence Leonard “Kelly” Johnson’s work on the P-38 Lightning “significantly changed air combat in WWII. Ishpeming is proud to recognize Johnson as one of our Sons of Ishpeming for his outstanding accomplishments and contributions to aeronautical and systems engineering.”\n\nThe final Son of Ishpeming in the memorial, John D. Voelker’s early professional career was as an attorney and county prosecutor in Marquette County. Voelker was also appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court by Gov. G. Mennen Williams in 1957. He is best known as the author of the novel “Anatomy of a Murder,” published in 1958.\n\n“When we got done with this project, I was a little bit sad, simply because I enjoyed it so much,” said Alex Sovey, the bricklayer for the project. “It was a challenge. I worked with some wonderful people, including (Bob Marietti) and his wife.”\n\nBob Marietti was the project coordinator for the monument.\n\n“The community at large has no idea of the heritage here,” Marietti said.\n\nThe monument sits atop of a large piece of hematite — fitting for the city of Ishpeming.\n\nKatie Segula can be reached at 906-228-2500, ext. 242.
