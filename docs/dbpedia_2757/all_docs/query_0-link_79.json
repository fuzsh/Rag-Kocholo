        "text": "The talent in Michigan comes from all over the state.\n\nMichigan is definitely a great place to look if you are seeking out talent of any type. This state has produced movie stars, politicians, scientists, athletes, coaches, tech moguls, and so many more. With all that talent, sometimes you have to narrow the search.\n\nFor this group of notable people and celebrities, I focused on those born in the Upper Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula has produced quite a few sports stars for the world to see. From coaches to extreme athletes, there is a little bit of everything. The infamous Tom Izzo, Bastion Booger, and ultrarunner Pam Reed just to name a few.\n\nThe Upper Peninsula is also responsible for some great scientific minds as well. Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson from Ishpeming made huge contributions to the designs of the Lockheed U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird. We also have a Nobel Prize-winning chemist on the list as well.\n\nWhen you take time to check out all of the talent that has come from this great state, it is pretty awesome to be a Michigander. Earlier last year I spent some time finding famous celebrities from Flint and was blown away. Today, I decided to research the Upper Peninsula and was not disappointed. I look forward to researching more cities throughout Michigan to see who they have produced.\n\nCheck out the list below and let me know if I left any out."
