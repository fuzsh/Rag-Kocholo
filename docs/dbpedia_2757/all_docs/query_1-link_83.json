Since then, the company added to it's personnel, and changed it's name to Johnson DeBois & Forrest.\n\nJDF is a mid-size firm, located in Santa Rosa, made up of licensed principal engineers, associate engineers, CAD drafters and administrative staff. We are unique in the engineering community because of our strong building code background\n\nGet Started!\n\nJohnson DeBois & Forrest is a Structural Engineering and Code Consulting Firm that provides structural support services for a wide range of projects such as:\n\nCustom homes, subdivisions, apartments, additions and remodels\n\nCommercial buildings for office, retail, warehouse, winery, church and hotel establishments\n\nBarns, riding arenas and agricultural buildings, custom pools\n\nThird party plan checking for life/safety and structural design\n\nWe make every effort to keep the lines of communication open with our clients.
