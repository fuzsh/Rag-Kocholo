He was born on July 19, 1958 in Little Rock, AR to Jack Kelly Johnson and Janice Lee (Ivey) Johnson.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Jack and Janice Johnson. Joeyâ€™s survivors include his daughters, Roxanna Baker (Shelly) of Conway, AR, and Samantha Baker (Shay) of Holcomb, MS, his sisters, Saundra Williams, & husband, Lee of St. Martinville, LA, and Joy Pilkinton of Sherwood, AR; his brothers, Jackie Johnson of Zwolle, LA; Jerry Johnson & wife, Gloria of Jacksonville, AR, and James Johnson & wife, Susie of North Little Rock, AR; his grandchildren, Tesla Kellie Lee of Conway, AR, Aylissa Breann Baker of Conway, AR, Savannah Baker of Grenada, MS, Kaytlin Baker, Kelsey Baker, and Branden Baker of Grenada, MS, Micheala Raymond of Holcomb, MS; his great grandchild, Miles Walters of Grenada, MS; along with a host of nieces, nephews, friends, and other relatives.\n\nTo know him was to love him. His eyes and smile would light up a room! Joey was always willing to help those in need, he was a great and simple man. He loved his family with his whole heart! His spirituality was one of his greatest attributes. May his light forever shine upon all who knew him. He loved racing, building hot rods and motorcycles, playing pool, fishing, and the ocean. Joey never met a stranger and will forever be missed and loved! Fly High, Daddy; We Love You!"
