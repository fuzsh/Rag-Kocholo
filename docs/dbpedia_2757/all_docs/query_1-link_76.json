        "text": "On July 8, 2024, and July 11, 2024, respectively, Henry Dean Johnson, Jr., and his beloved wife, Margaret Garrett Kelly Johnson passed peacefully from this world and into their heavenly home. Separated in death by only three days proves a true testament to their beautiful love story and commitment to each other.\n\nHenry, known to many as “Dean”, was born October 5, 1946, in Richmond, Virginia to the late Lt. Col. Henry Dean Johnson, Sr., and Virginia Preston Lowry Johnson. Dean touched the lives of countless individuals through his unwavering dedication to his career, his community, and most importantly to his family. At a young age, his interest in engineering became evident and he pursued this passion by graduating with a mechanical engineering degree from Virginia Tech. His thirst for knowledge led him to participate in a university co-op program with Boeing on the historic Saturn V project in Huntsville, Alabama, setting the stage for a rewarding career ahead.\n\nDean's professional journey was marked by significant contributions in the field of engineering. He worked as a system design engineer at the Newport News Shipyard, where he played a pivotal role in designing nuclear submarines. Subsequently, he dedicated nearly two decades of his life to Philip Morris USA as a mechanical engineer. However, it was his role as the executive director of Habit for Humanity in Cabarrus County that truly allowed him to fulfil his desire to bless others. Through this position, Dean was able to merge his engineering expertise with his love of philanthropy, leaving a lasting impact on those he served. He also made an impact at All Saints Episcopal Church in Concord, NC by serving as Jr & Sr Warden.\n\nBeyond his professional accomplishments, Dean will always be cherished for his infectious smile and unwavering love for his family, especially his three granddaughters, whom he was best known as “Pop.” They held a special place in his heart and brought immeasurable joy into his life. Described as a man of faith, honor, and devotion to his family, Dean's character shone brightly through his humor and outgoing nature. His witty sense of humor never failed to bring laughter to those around him.\n\nDean’s beloved wife of 53 years, Margaret “Peggy” Kelly Johnson, was born on December 30, 1948, also in Richmond, Virginia, to the late Lt. Col. Daniel Jennings Kelly, Sr., and Lucille Robinson Garrett Kelly.\n\nPeggy attended Mary Washington College and then Virginia Tech, where she and Dean met. Following their marriage, she worked as a loan officer and then as a bookkeeper but found her greatest accomplishment in being a stay-at-home mother to their children, Stacey and Dean.\n\nPeggy found great joy in building lasting friendships and investing in meaningful relationships with those she loved. While living in Virginia, she was a member of the Flaming Flamingos Bridge Club where friendships created decades ago brought her immense comfort in her last days. Peggy was a devoted Christian and was involved in numerous prayer groups. She was instrumental in the prayer life of All Saints Episcopal Church in Concord, North Carolina, as well as the prayer shawl ministry. Peggy had endless faith and would meet with anyone who needed to be prayed over. Her heart was to truly help others.\n\nAnyone that was blessed to know Peggy would collectively describe her as a loyal and compassionate friend, mentor, and nurturer. She was a devoted wife, a loving mother, and a doting grandmother, whose favorite name was “Mamie.” While Peggy found immense joy in pouring into others, her true and greatest joy was found in time spent with her family. She was intentional in creating wonderful memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nDean and Peggy’s legacy lives on through the love and memories they cultivated during their time on earth. May they rest in eternal peace knowing they made a profound impact on all who had the privilege of crossing paths with them.\n\nA dual Celebration of Life will be held at 11:00 am, Saturday, July 20, 2024 at Salem United Methodist Church, 378 N. Pilot Knob Rd., Denver, with Pastor Eric Lane officiating. The family will receive friends following the service.\n\nDean and Peggy are survived by their children, Stacey Johnson Zenoski (preceded in death by Joe Zenoski) and Henry “Dean” Johnson III; granddaughters, Anna, Maryn, and Emma Zenoski; Dean’s brothers, Dwight Johnson and Dale Johnson; Peggy’s brothers, Dan Kelly and Clyde Kelly; as well as numerous nieces, nephews, and cousins.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made in Dean and Peggy’s memory to Salem United Methodist Church, 378 N. Pilot Knob Rd., Denver, NC 28037.\n\nRaymer-Kepner Funeral Home & Cremation Services is caring for the Johnson family. Condolences and memories may be shared at www.KepnerFH.com."
