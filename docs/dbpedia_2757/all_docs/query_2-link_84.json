        "text": "As Speaker Mike Johnson likes to tell it, it was love at first sight when he first met Kelly Lary, the sunny, blond former Kappa Delta who caught his eye in a red dress at the wedding of a mutual friend.\n\nOn their first date, they discovered they both wanted to name their first daughter Hannah and their first son Jack. Three weeks later, Mr. Johnson confessed his love. They were engaged after six months and exactly 364 days later, Ms. Lary became Mrs. Johnson.\n\nIt’s an uncomplicated origin story about a marriage that Mr. Johnson, an evangelical Christian who has put his faith at the center of his political life and policy decisions, has made a focal point of his biography. That has thrust Mrs. Johnson, who has been very vocal about her deeply held conservative views — many of which are at odds with mainstream public opinion in the United States — into an unusual spotlight for the spouse of a speaker of the House.\n\nMrs. Johnson, who turned 50 last month, is also an evangelical Christian and a licensed pastoral counselor, and has co-hosted Mr. Johnson’s podcast about religion and politics. In her professional capacity, she has opposed homosexuality and same-sex marriage, both of which she views as sins. In her work as an activist, as a leader in her church and in her counseling, she has proselytized her hard-line anti-abortion views. As a wife, she has championed more legally binding marriages that make it difficult to divorce.\n\nLike her husband, she attributes all of her beliefs to a biblical worldview. Her views are not far outside the mainstream for evangelical Christians, even if they are out of step with public opinion. Same-sex marriage has become widely accepted by members of both parties, and polls show that more than 70 percent of voters support it.\n\nBut they are unusual for high-profile figures in Washington, roles she and her husband are still acclimating to.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
