        "text": "Clarence L. \"Kelly\" Johnson, creator of Lockheed's secret \"Skunk Works\" research and development division and legendary designer of aircraft, ranging from the World War II P-38 Lightning to the U-2 and triplesonic SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance planes, died Friday. He was 80. Lockheed announced thatJohnson died at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank after a long illness, which the company did not disclose.\n\nTony LeVier, Lockheed's former chief test pilot, who flew many of Johnson's planes, said Friday that Johnson's state-of-the-art aircraft \"kept us out of World War III.\"\n\nLeVier said Johnson's planes \"flew like a dream.\" The test pilot described the engineer as a stern father-figure with great influence in the Pentagon.\n\nJohnson was a renowned aircraft engineer from the outset of his career at Lockheed in 1933. Four years later, at 27, he won the Lawrence Sperry Award for outstanding aeronautics achievement for developing the world's fastest commercial air transport, which flew 250 mph.\n\nJohnson founded the Skunk Works in 1943 to build the XP-80 Shooting Star, the United States' first production jet fighter, for World War II.\n\nHoused in circus tents next to a plastics factory in Burbank, the secret facility smelled so bad that engineers dubbed it the Skunk Works, after the foul-smelling\n\nmoonshine distillery in Al Capp's comic strip \"Li'l Abner.\"\n\nJohnson, who contributed significantly to the design of more than 40 planes, was the key designer of the Constellation or \"Connie\" transport planes, the Hercules cargo planes, the P2V anti-submarine patrol aircraft and the Agena spacecraft.\n\nHis indelible mark was also stamped on the F-104 Starfighter, the first production aircraft to fly at twice the speed of sound; the U-2, the first plane able to make a sustained flight above 60,000 feet; and the YF-12 and SR-71 Blackbird, the world's fastest and highest-flying planes.\n\nWith the assignment to develop the U-2 under a joint CIA-Air Force request for a high-altitude strategic-reconnaissance and special-purpose research aircraft in 1954, the Skunk Works became an autonomous unit of Lockheed, complete with its own manufacturing facilities. The complex was formally named the Advanced Development Projects organization.\n\nConsidered something of a heresy in the aerospace industry because its tiny staff and informal operation could sidestep red tape and bureaucratic reports, the Skunk Works became the place for military leaders to go when they needed something invented and produced quickly.\n\nThe unit took only eight months to build the first U-2. It was a U-2 in which Francis Gary Powers was shot down over Russia in 1960 and another U-2 that provided photographic proof in 1962 that the Soviets were installing missiles in Cuba.\n\nJohnson's triplesonic Blackbirds were only recently retired by the Air Force. The planes could fly faster than 2,000 mph and higher than 85,000 feet. Even on the way to museum display last March, the last Blackbird shattered at least three air-speed standards crossing the continent.\n\nBorn in Ishpeming, Mich., on Feb. 27, 1910, Johnson learned about tools from his Swedish immigrant father, who was a carpenter and bricklayer.\n\nJohnson, certain by the age of 12 that he wanted to build planes, studied aeronautical engineering at the University of Michigan. While studying for his master's degree, he worked on aerodynamic design of cars slated to run in the Indianapolis 500.\n\nLockheed's chief aircraft designer for more than three decades, Johnson was named vice president for research and development in 1956. The same year, he was named Aviation Man of the Year by aviation writers for his development of the F-104 supersonic jet.\n\nIn 1974, Johnson was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame at Dayton, Ohio.\n\nJohnson retired from Lockheed in 1975 with the title senior vice president, and left the company's board of directors in 1980.\n\nHe is survived by his third wife, the former Nancy Powers Horrigan; a brother, Clifford, of East Tawas, Mich., and Pinellas Park; and a sister, Alice Roseveare of Saratoga, Calif."
