Today we have Insignificance, another film from Nicolas Roeg.

This one’s a strange one. It asks what might have happened if Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe DiMaggio and Senator Joe McCarthy all met up in a hotel room.

Theresa Russell plays Monroe (credited as ‘Actress’), rather too much of a breathy impression for my taste.

Michael Emil plays Einstein (or ‘Professor’ as he’s credited).

Gary Busey plays Joe DiMaggio (‘Ballplayer’). He was married to Monroe for a few years.

He’s also known as ‘The Ballplayer’ in the fiction of the film, as this trading card demonstrates.

Finally, Tony Curtis plays Senator Joe McCarthy (‘Senator’) who’s there to force Einstein to testify before the House Unamerican Activities Committee. He’s portrayed as sleazy and power hungry, so probably accurate.

I like the scene where Monroe explains relativity to Einstein (to prove she knows what it means).

The film doesn’t make much of an effort to expand out from the play it’s so obviously based on. Almost the entire thing takes place in the hotel room, except for the opening which starts when Monroe is filming the famous shot of her standing over the grating with her dress blowing up, although we only get to see that from her waist down, and most of the scene is the two fan operators.

Will Sampson plays an elevator operator.

After this, there’s a True Stories documentary about a team of Australian Aborigine Cricketers travelling to England to play cricket, Dreaming of Lords. The tape ends during this programme.
