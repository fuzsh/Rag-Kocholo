However, the notes should only be treated as references, and changes should be made according to the needs of the students.\n\nSummary\n\nThe speaker describes a tiny speck he notices moving across a sheet of paper he is writing on. At first, he thinks it is just a dust speck blown by his breath. On closer inspection, he realises it is actually a living mite, moving with its own inclinations. The mite pauses suspiciously at the speaker’s pen, then races wildly towards the still wet ink on the page. It pauses again, seeming to drink or smell the ink, before turning to flee in apparent disgust.\n\nThe speaker remarks on how the mite seems too tiny to have a full set of feet, yet it clearly does since it can walk and express a desire to live. The mite runs in terror and creeps cunningly across the page. It hesitates, as if trying to decide what to do.\n\nIt then cowers down in the middle of the sheet, accepting its fate at the hands of the speaker. The speaker reflects that he does not have the “tenderer-than-thou” collectivist mentality of the modern world that loves to destroy en masse. Since the mite has done no harm, he decides to let it be, hoping it will fall asleep on the page.\n\nThe speaker concludes by affirming that he recognises and appreciates the presence of “mind” wherever he encounters it, however humble the guise. He is glad for even the smallest display of mind.\n\nLine-by-line explanation of the poem\n\nA speck that would have been beneath my sight / On any but a paper sheet so white\n\nThe poet notices an extremely tiny speck on the bright white paper he is writing on. It is so tiny and diminutive in size that under normal circumstances, it would be invisible to him and completely beneath his ability to detect. The only reason he is able to discern the minuscule speck at all is because the paper providing the backdrop is such a stark, brilliant white. This high contrast between the bright white paper and the tiny dark speck is what allows it to barely be perceptible to him.\n\nSet off across what I had written there. / And I had idly poised my pen in air / To stop it with a period of ink\n\nAs the poet is writing on this sheet of paper, he suddenly notices the tiny speck moving across the page, crawling over the words he had previously written down. At this moment, the poet’s pen was casually hovering in the air over the paper, as he had paused his writing briefly and left the pen temporarily suspended mid-air. He was just about to finish the sentence he had been writing by putting down a final period mark of ink as the terminating punctuation.\n\nWhen something strange about it made me think, / This was no dust speck by my breathing blown, / But unmistakably a living mite\n\nJust as the poet is about to set his pen back to paper, the movement of the tiny speck catches his attention. Some quality seems curious and strange about the way it is crawling across the page. This makes the poet stop and consider the speck more intentionally, sparking his thoughts about it. Upon closer observation and contemplation, the poet realizes this little speck is not just a random bit of dust that had wafted across the page carried by his own breathing as he wrote. Rather, he discerns that the speck is definitively a living mite traversing the page.\n\nWith inclinations it could call its own. / It paused as with suspicion of my pen, / And then came racing wildly on again\n\nMoreover, as the poet watches the mite creep across the page, he perceives that it is not simply blowing aimlessly but moving with self-directed purpose, following its own inclinations. The tiny mite pauses momentarily in what seems like an apprehensive cessation to examine the poet’s pen still poised above. After this brief hesitation, the mite resumes scurrying rapidly, wildy racing across the page once more.\n\nTo where my manuscript was not yet dry; / Then paused again and either drank or smelt– / With loathing, for again it turned to fly.\n\nThe energetic mite scampers over to the part of the manuscript where the poet had recently written, and the ink remains damp and not yet dried. Reaching this moist ink, the mite pauses briefly again. During this second hesitation, it seems to either drink some of the liquid ink or smell and investigate its scent. However, the mite appears to despise and recoil from the ink’s flavor or odor. After examining the wet ink, it quickly whirls around once more to retreat away from the noxious substance.\n\nPlainly with an intelligence I dealt. / It seemed too tiny to have room for feet, / Yet must have had a set of them complete\n\nThrough observing the mite’s self-motivated movements and interactions, the poet concludes he is clearly witnessing an intelligent creature acting intentionally, not just a mindlessly drifting speck. The mite is so unimaginably minute that it doesn’t seem possible it could contain space for a full set of feet within its microscopic form. Yet somehow within its diminutive body, the mite does indeed possess an entire functioning set of feet needed to traverse the page.\n\nTo express how much it didn’t want to die. / It ran with terror and with cunning crept. / It faltered: I could see it hesitate;\n\nThe way the mite actively darts about reveals a strong inborn will to survive and evade death. It runs with an urgency suggesting fear, but also moves with the careful cunning of an instinctual hunter. The poet sees the mite falter, hesitating in an uncertain, wavering manner, as if internally deliberating what to do next.\n\nThen in the middle of the open sheet / Cower down in desperation to accept / Whatever I accorded it of fate.\n\nAfter exhibiting that moment of hesitant indecision, the mite ends up frozen in the very center of the blank open page. It seems to crouch down low against the paper in desperate surrender, willing to accept whatever fate the poet now chooses to deal out.\n\nI have none of the tenderer-than-thou / Collectivistic regimenting love / With which the modern world is being swept.\n\nAt this climactic moment, the poet declares he does not personally possess a sentimental, excessively gentle nature, nor any oppressive variety of “collectivist” love that tries to control everything according to specific regulations. He criticizes this totalitarian kind of “love” which he sees as currently overtaking the modern world.\n\nBut this poor microscopic item now! / Since it was nothing I knew evil of / I let it lie there till I hope it slept.\n\nHowever, observing this particular helpless, tiny mite pitiably poised before him, and given that it has done no evident harm, the poet decides not to interfere with it. He chooses to leave the mite alone on the page undisturbed, hoping it will fall asleep there in peace.\n\nI have a mind myself and recognize / Mind when I meet with it in any guise / No one can know how glad I am to find / On any sheet the least display of mind.\n\nIn conclusion, the poet declares that he himself possesses intelligence and imagination. He is able to perceive those same faculties of intellect and creativity when he encounters them manifesting through any living being. No one else can fully understand the happiness the poet feels when he discovers even the smallest exhibition of imagination or inventive thought on a written page.\n\nWord meanings\n\nspeck: a tiny spot or fleck\n\nidly: lazily, not busily\n\npoised: held suspended; balanced\n\nmite: a very small insect or arachnid\n\ninclinations: natural tendencies or preferences to act in certain ways\n\nmanuscript: a handwritten document or text\n\nloathing: intense dislike or disgust\n\ncunning: skillful aptitude; craftiness\n\ncrept: moved stealthily and carefully\n\nfaltered: hesitated; wavered\n\nhesitate: pause due to uncertainty\n\nopen sheet: blank paper space\n\ncower: crouch down in fear or submission\n\ndesperation: hopeless resignation; despair\n\naccorded: allowed; granted\n\nfate: destiny or outcome\n\ntenderer-than-thou: excessively gentle or sentimental\n\ncollectivistic: focused on group control rather than individualism\n\nregimenting: strictly controlling according to rules\n\nmicroscopic: extremely tiny; visible only by microscope\n\nguise: form; manifestation\n\nAbout the author\n\nRobert Frost (1874-1963) is considered one of the most prominent and influential American poets of the 20th century. He was born in San Francisco but moved to New Hampshire as a boy when his father died. He attended Dartmouth College briefly before returning to work on farms and in factories.\n\nThough he was initially unsuccessful at publishing his poems, Frost persevered and eventually found acclaim with collections like A Boy’s Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914).\n\nHe went on to win four Pulitzer Prizes for poetry over the course of his lifetime, a record unsurpassed to this day. Frost was made Poet Laureate of Vermont in 1916 and served as a poetry consultant to the Library of Congress later in life.\n\nHis works such as “The Road Not Taken,” “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” and “Mending Wall” have become classics.\n\nWorkbook answers/solutions\n\nMultiple Choice Questions (MCQs)\n\n1.
