        "text": "#566 Insignificance\n\n1985 // UK // Nicolas Roeg\n\nCriterion Collection (LINK)\n\nWhere should I begin with this film. Perhaps its ominous film title which seems like a tend in Roeg’s filmography with DON’T LOOK NOW (1973) and BAD TIMING (1980)? Or the fact that the four main characters in the film is a satirical caricature of four public figures who could easily dominate the front page of newspapers in 1950s America? Or its intriguing premise: what if Marilyn Monroe, Senator Joe McCarthy, Joe DiMaggio and Albert Einstein all cross path in a hotel within a single night in 1954?\n\nTerry Johnson’s original play performed in 1982 is, with due respect, out of my concern here. Since Nicolas Roeg, with his idiosyncratic abstruse editing, repackage the story for his own brand. Like BAD TIMING but in a diminished fashion, characters’ flashes punctuate the narrative, thus supplementing the characters’ background (most often of their childhood); or else we have flashes of a nightmarish vision, a bombed wreckage of Hiroshima, from The Professor’s (Michael Emil) disturbed mind.\n\nThe Professor, without being named in the film, is the mirror image of Albert Einstein. He is “threatened” by The Senator (Tony Curtis), McCarthy we presume, with a subpoena to testify in front of a committee. His hotel room would then be visited by The Actress (Theresa Russell) and her baseball-star husband (Gary Busey). I can’t even explain the development of the story since I think what ever happen afterwards is near inconsequential.\n\nOne could analyse the film with the pretext of fame and fear, or simplt take it as a satire stuffed with cultural references. How Marilyn Monroe explains the Theory of Relativity is the highlight for me, but does the scene have any significance in a thematic level? I highly doubt it. The film has a lot of witty dialogues, not that kind of laugh-out-loud comedy though.\n\nIt requires you to have a leap of faith to ride along. Don’t ask why The Indian (Will Sampson), working as the elevator operator in the hotel, is the center of universe, and don’t try to rationalise the explosive, “reversible” ending. Time is relative, so is the film. It’s far from being a significant work of art, the best I could do is simply say I do have a fun time with the film. Just appeal for more."
