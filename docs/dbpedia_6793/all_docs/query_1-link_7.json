I'll be right there.\n\nTell 'em where to put it.\n\n- What do you think?\n\n- I'm ready.\n\nI'd say that's okay. Take it to \"B.\"\n\nGive me some focus, would you?\n\nI need... I need some more light here.\n\nHold it there!\n\n- You got it all wrong.\n\n- Get out of here.\n\nLet's have some more fizz here.\n\nCome on. Come on.\n\n- Come on, guys. Get-Get...\n\n- Hold... That's it.\n\nDon't tell me. Nothing's right.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nOkay, that's great. That's perfect.\n\nIt's thick. All of them are...\n\nA minute, 28. I know. What about, uh...\n\n...and there at the plate... He steals home!\n\nWe got this. Try for a reverse.\n\nShe there yet?\n\n- I can't see.\n\n- Can't see nothin'?\n\n- Just the stars.\n\n- Screw the stars.\n\nI like the stars.\n\nYou look at the stars, and you feel like\n\ntomorrow you can do anything...\n\nkiss that girl, walk on the grass.\n\nStars won't think the worse of you.\n\nStars won't even notice.\n\nKnow what I mean?\n\nIs she there yet,\n\nyou philosophical f***in' bastard?\n\n- That's her.\n\n- I can't see a f***in' thing.\n\nIf I can't see nothin', how do I know\n\nwhen to hit the f***in' fan?\n\n- You guys ready?\n\n- Yep.\n\nI was ready last time.\n\nAnd the time before that!\n\nReady, ma'am? This is a take.\n\nAll right now. Stand back\n\nand make way, please, gentlemen!\n\nJust get it right this time.\n\nI ain't in no hurry.\n\nI hope you go blind.\n\n- Go fan.\n\n- Go.\n\nJesus! Ow.\n\nMove, by God! Move to me!\n\nIt's the breeze from the subway.\n\nIsn't it delicious?\n\nThat's a kind of interesting point of view.\n\nOkay. Cut!\n\nWhat'd you see?\n\nWhat'd you see? Did you see anything?\n\nI saw the face of God.\n\nAh.\n\nUh, you know that according\n\nto the laws of probability...\n\nyou drink a glass of water,\n\nyou drink a little piece of Napoleon's crap.\n\nMaybe even Mussolini's.\n\nBut more like Napoleon,\n\n'cause he's been dead longer.\n\nThis way. It's for Life magazine!\n\nHey, watch out for my leg, buddy.\n\nHey!\n\nHey. Honey. Honey!\n\nHey!\n\nWho does she think she is?\n\n- You think that's cute, don't you?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nBoy, what a night!\n\nOh, would you mind?\n\nFor two minutes, I wait eight hours?\n\nAnything for money.\n\nWherever it is you're taking me...\n\nI don't wanna go.\n\nNow, Attila the Hun,\n\nhe's a dead cert, see?\n\n'Cause he's been gone too long.\n\nSo don't you see? All of us, we're all part\n\nof that great f***in' alimentary canal.\n\n- Hmm.\n\n- Did you know that?\n\n# You're gone again this morning #\n\n# How long will you #\n\n# Keep running on and on? #\n\n# Can't you see the warning? ##\n\nProfessor?\n\nProfessor?\n\nYes.\n\nProfessor?\n\nYes, yes.\n\n- Professor.\n\n- Yes.\n\nGood evening, Professor.\n\nIt sure is a dog of a night.\n\nSorry to bother you so late.\n\nBut, uh, I thought that there was\n\nsomething that had to be said...\n\nand it's gotta be said before the morning.\n\nYep, it sure is a dog of a night.\n\nTomorrow's gonna be a dog of a day.\n\nHey.\n\nIs this the stuff you hump around\n\nwith you all the time?\n\nMust be a few years' work right there, huh?\n\nI'm not an educated man myself, Professor,\n\nbut I sure would love to know what you know.\n\nI guess I'm just a man\n\nwho likes to know things.\n\nHey, do you know\n\nwhere there's a five-and-dime?\n\nAn all-night store or somethin'.\n\nI need a few things.\n\nWell, I don't know, ma'am.\n\nI was told to take you straight to your des...\n\n- Well, f*** them.\n\n- Destination.\n\n- Well, I was told no stopping.\n\n- Please.\n\nIt's important.\n\nJust for me, huh?\n\nOkay.\n\nFor me.\n\nYou're not on trial here.\n\nYou know that.\n\nYou know? You're not being accused\n\nof anything.\n\nYou know? You are not the accused.\n\nIf you feel accused,\n\nthat makes me a very unhappy man.\n\nSit down. Sit down, will ya?\n\nNow, tell me.\n\nAre you feeling accused?\n\nI feel persecuted.\n\nHmm. Are you now?\n\nOr have I ever been?\n\nCheer up, will you, Professor?\n\nThat's not an accusation.\n\nDo you understand? It's just an inquiry.\n\nYou want a drink?\n\nBut, uh, off the record,\n\nwould you tell me what...\n\nWhat do you think your answer\n\nto a question like that would be?\n\nI mean, it seems to me,\n\nit'd be simple as just a yes or a no.\n\nBut you'd be surprised how many citizens\n\nfind it hard to just even say those two words...\n\nand they've turned these hearings\n\ninto one royal pain in the butt!\n\nYou know how many times\n\none guy cited the Fifth Amendment?\n\nGuess.\n\nYou'II never get it. Seventy-nine times.\n\nHe got awfully tired.\n\nLook, all I'm asking you\n\nis for a simple answer to a simple question...\n\nso that we can all get home\n\nfor the long weekend.\n\nProfessor, I haven't seen my sweet wife\n\nin over a month.\n\nThe last time I bought tickets,\n\nI... I had to cancel.\n\nWe had two extra sessions to try that\n\njumped-up n*gger Robeson for contempt.\n\nAh.\n\nAnd I missed the damn plane.\n\nProfessor, let me make this\n\nperfectly clear, you know?\n\nNow, military men and politicians...\n\nthey'll wallow around in the mud,\n\nand they come up smelling roses.\n\nBut not you. Nah, no. Not you.\n\nYou... You're in a special category.\n\nYou know, a different type.\n\nYou know what? The movie star type.\n\nThe kind that mud sticks to.\n\nYou help us, and I'll help you\n\ncome out nice and clean.\n\nUh-huh. Nice and clean. Nice and clean.\n\nI bet I know what you want me to do\n\nto come out nice and clean.\n\nYou want me to answer yes.\n\nIsn't that right?\n\n- Right.\n\n- Ah. Mmm.\n\n- Yes. Yes would be just fine by us.\n\n- Uh-huh.\n\nAnd if you couple that with a denunciation\n\nof any Communist ideals you once held...\n\nI mean, that would be a good plus as well.\n\nUh, and you could mention\n\na couple of names.\n\nMm-hmm. Is that all?\n\nWell...\n\na formal condemnation\n\nof the Soviet arms initiative...\n\nwouldn't do you any harm at all.\n\nHuh.\n\nIn confidence between us, Professor,\n\nI'll tell you something.\n\nThese hearings\n\nare not gonna go on much longer.\n\nYou could be our last great civilian fish.\n\nAnd what a fish.\n\nI mean, you know everything there is\n\nto know about everything...\n\nthe cosmos, space,\n\n\"pootons,\" protons, \"clutons.\"\n\nI mean everything. The Jewish problem.\n\nThey call you the mommy and\n\nthe daddy of the H-bomb.\n\nA true child of the universe.\n\nWell, I have to tell you something\n\nabout all this.\n\nIn my lifetime of experiences...\n\nthe Swiss authorities\n\ncalled me a German fascist...\n\ndisregarding that I'm Jewish.\n\nBut you delicately alluded to that\n\na moment ago.\n\nAnd in Germany, by the German fascists...\n\nbecause I was Jewish,\n\nI was called a Zionist conspirator.\n\nI come to democratic America...\n\nsome small-minded people called me\n\na German fascist and a Zionist conspirator.\n\nAnd now I presume that you are suggesting\n\nthat I'm a Soviet Communist!\n\nWell, listen.\n\nTwo weeks ago, two magazines,\n\nat the same time variously called me..."
