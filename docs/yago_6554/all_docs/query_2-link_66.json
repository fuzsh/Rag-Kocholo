        "meta_description": "In this study new TiO2 photocatalysts core@shell type were synthesized using SiO2 as structural support. The coating was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. Adsorption isotherms revealed that the surface area of such composites is about 26% higher than pure oxide (W50). X-ray diffractograms combined with Raman spectroscopy revealed that the synthesized TiO2 presents a structure based on the coexistence of anatase and brookite. The composite W50S50 presented the best photocatalytic performance of H2 production, with 13.5 mmol in 5 h, corresponding to a specific rate of 32.5 mmol h−1g−1. In the reuse assays, this composite presented a good stability in the production of H2. However, its performance presented a reduction of 23% over the reuse cycles. Considering the H2 production in a solar simulator, W50S50 produced about 25.0 μmols, which is equivalent to 48.0 μmols h−1g−1, suggesting the good performance of this material for photocatalytic hydrogen production.",

        "text": "Photocatalytic production of H2\n\nThis was evaluated by three different approaches. In the first, the most active composite was identified among the synthesized materials, which was done on bench scale experiments, monitoring the production of H2 achieved in the same time interval by each photocatalyst. In the second, also on bench scale, the most efficient composite was submitted to reuse assays, in a process involving four consecutive photocatalytic cycles. Finally, in a solar simulator the production mediated by the most efficient composite and pure oxide (W50), was evaluated.\n\nThe photocatalytic system used in bench scale (Machado & Machado, 2020) is based in a reactor built in borosilicate glass with total volume of 1.5 L, possessing a cooling jacket also made in borosilicate glass. It is connected to a thermostatic bath, which keeps the reaction medium at 20 °C. The reactor was positioned on a magnetic agitator, used to promote homogenization of the aqueous suspension containing the catalyst and reactive species. A 400 W high pressure (HPL-N) mercury lamp without its protective bulb was used as radiation font. The photonic flow of this lamp was estimated to be 3.3 × 10−6 Einstein/s (Machado et al., 2008), and irradiance equal to 100 W/m2 in the UVA. The lamp was positioned laterally at 15 cm from the reactor.\n\nBefore the assays of H2 production the photocatalysts were loaded by photoreduction with 0.1% m/m of Pt, obtained from a solution of hexachloroplatinic acid. The photocatalyst loaded with Pt was suspended in 750 mL of a water/methanol mixture containing 20% v/v of methanol, used as a sacrificial reagent. The pH of the reaction medium was adjusted to 6.2, isoelectric point of TiO2, pH at which its photocatalytic activity is favored according to studies by Hoffmann et al. (1995). For this, 0.1 mol L−1 solutions of HCl and NaOH were used for adjustment. Before each experiment, the dissolved gases, especially oxygen, inside the reactor were purged with N2 for 5 min. Finally, with the lamp on, the photocatalytic assays were started. During the reaction, aliquots of the gases produced were collected every hour, in a total period of 5 h. The gases were analyzed by gas phase chromatography using a PerkinElmer Clarus 580 chromatograph (PerkinElmer, Watham, MA, USA), equipped with two packed columns (porapak N 2 mm and molecular sieve) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate.\n\nIn the assays of H2 production using a solar simulator a smaller volume reactor was used. All experimental parameters such as reaction time, initial pH, photocatalyst concentration, sacrifice reagent and cocatalyst were maintained proportionally equal to those employed on bench scale, for comparative purposes. The solar simulator, described by Nunes, Patrocinio & Bahnemann (2019), is constituted by a reactor, also made of borosilicate glass, with an internal volume of 80 mL, a 300 W xenon lamp, used as radiation font, and an AM1.5 filter, which simulates solar conditions after radiation passes through 1.5 times the atmospheric mass. This is equivalent to the direct incidence of solar radiation on earth’s surface, with a deviation of 48.2° from the angle of zenith (Honsber & Bowden, 2019). The reactor cooling system was connected to a thermostatic bath to keep the reaction medium at 20 °C. During the reactions, the content inside the reactor was maintained under stirring. The reactor was positioned at 15 cm from the radiation source, being exposed to an irradiance of 20 W/m2 in the UVA.\n\nFor comparative purposes, since different photocatalytic systems were used, in addition to the amount, in mols, of produced H2, the results were expressed in terms of specific rate of H2 production (SRHP) (Machado, Alves & Machado, 2019; Lin & Shih, 2016),\n\nSRPH=ntmwhere n is the number of mols of H2, obtained by integration in the interval between 4 and 5 h; t is the time of reaction; m is the mass of catalyst (g).\n\nCharacterizations\n\nFigure 1 presents the FTIR spectra of pure TiO2, SiO2, and of the TiO2/SiO2 composites (W50S25, W50S50 and W50S75). It is possible to distinguish three typical vibrations related to pure SiO2: bands at 438 and 803 cm−1 and a band centered at 1,050 cm−1 related, respectively, to bending and symmetrical and asymmetric stretching of Si-O-Si, and a secondary vibration at 960 cm−1 related to silanol groups (Si-OH) (Panwar, Jassal & Agrawal, 2016; Kermadi et al., 2015). For pure TiO2, three characteristic bands are observed: a wide and intense at 403 cm−1 and two more subtle, at 530 and 730 cm−1, both related to Ti-O-Ti stretching (Mohamed, Osman & Khairou, 2015). The composites present the two most intense bands of the respective oxides, with small displacements: a band centered at 1,102 cm−1, associated to silica, and a band at 403 cm−1, related to TiO2.\n\nThe low signal intensity referring to the silanol groups in the composites proves the silica coating by TiO2. These groups, present on the silica surface, assists in the stability of metal charges through the Si-O-M bonds, favoring the dispersion of TiO2 over the support (Almeida et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2018). It is also observed that composites with higher concentrations of SiO2 have a more intense band centered at 960 cm−1 due to silica not covered by TiO2.\n\nThe Si-O-Si vibration, in general at 1,050 cm−1, is slightly shifted to higher frequencies (approximately 1,102 cm−1) due to calcination of these materials at high temperature, suggesting the strengthening of the Ti-O bond (Kermadi et al., 2015). In general, in all spectra it was possible to observe the presence of two relatively wide bands at 1,636 and 3,360 cm−1, related to O-H vibration of water molecules chemically and physically adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst (Poo-Arporn et al., 2019).\n\nIn Figs. S1–S5, the images obtained by SEM are shown. They are accompanied by their EDS spectra and histograms, that illustrate the average particle size distribution of photocatalysts (Table 1). From the analysis of the figures, it is observed that the particles of pure TiO2 have a dense aspect, with irregular spherical shape and average particle sizes ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 μm. Pure silica presents particles of regular spherical shape, with uniform average size. However, for them there is a tendency to aggregation, giving rise to bulky clusters of SiO2. For the studied composites, when compared to the W50, the reduction of the average particle size between them is evident, and this occurs as consequence of the coating of SiO2 by TiO2 (Li et al., 2013). For composite W50S75 it is verified through the analysis of the histogram, the existence of excess of SiO2, with the presence of particles with average diameter of 0.2 μm, in addition to a considerable increase in the aggregation state.\n\nThe isotherms, Fig. S6, suggest that the photocatalysts under study are type IV, characterized by being mesoporous, with average pore diameter between 2 and 50 nm, corroborating with the average pore diameter values, as displayed in Table 1. The profile of hysteresis are similar to type H2, which correspond to complex mesoporous structures, in which the distribution of pore size and shape is not well defined. Silica, in turn, presented type I isotherm and hysteresis characteristics of microporous materials, composed by agglomerates of spheroidal particles with close size distribution (IUPAC, 1985). Due to this, it is observed that the silica hysteresis loop does not close a typical behavior of materials with very narrow pores or bottle-shaped pores. This evidences the low average pore size, that prevents the diffusion of adsorbed N2 (Tang et al., 2017). The observed porosity also corroborates with the formation of the composite since the immobilization of TiO2 on the silica surface leads to the formation of new pores, resulting in increased porosity and consequent increase in the surface area (Salgado & Valentini, 2015). The composite W50S50 presented the highest porosity among the synthesized composites, which ensures greater adsorption of reagents on its surface, consequently increasing its photocatalytic action.\n\nBy analyzing the diffractograms shown in Fig. 2, and confronting with information reported in literature (Machado & Machado, 2020; Neto et al., 2017) and with the JCPDS 21-1272 (anatase) and 29-1360 (brookite) crystallographic files, it is possible to observe the coexistence of two crystalline phases in all the synthesized oxides, being anatase the main phase and brookite the secondary. It is worth mentioning the similarity of the diffraction profiles of these materials, with emphasis on the well-defined diffraction peaks for the uncoated material (W50), suggesting a significant increase in the crystallinity as a consequence of the heat treatment applied during the synthesis (El-Sheikh et al., 2017). On the other hand, it is observed that the intensity of the peaks decreases as the concentration of silica increases, indicating a decrease in the crystallinity of the composites, consequence of the non-crystallinity of SiO2 (Machado, Alves & Machado, 2019).\n\nFrom the diffractograms, it was possible to obtain, through Rietveld refinement, the proportion of crystalline phases, average size and the average deformation of the crystallite for synthesized species, Table 2. The diffractograms, accompanied by their respective calculated diffraction profiles, experimentally obtained profile, residual curves and Bragg diffraction adjusted by the Rietveld method, can be viewed in Fig. S7. The reliability factors of refinement are shown in Table 1.\n\nThe presence of brookite phase in the composites was verified in the oxide designated as W50, synthesized in a previous study (Machado & Machado, 2020). This involved the use of water/acetone mixtures to control the hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide. The presence of acetone during the synthesis affects the organization of the critical nuclei formed from the oligomeric network generated from titanates, which tends to favor the formation of the brookite phase (Machado & Machado, 2020). On the other hand, the addition of silica during the synthesis of the materials evaluated in the present study apparently did not influence the formation of any crystalline phase.\n\nIn the present study, the composite W50S50 presented the highest percentage of brookite among the synthesized materials—an increase of 25% compared to pure oxide. As shown in Table 2, the other composites showed similar proportions between the crystalline phases. The average crystalline size of the composites for both crystalline phases decreased with increasing silica concentration in the structure. A more expressive reduction was observed for composite W50S75, which presented contraction of the anatase phase greater than five times in comparison with pure oxide. This suggests that the presence of silica should inhibit the growth and surface diffusion processes of TiO2 nanoparticles due the curvature of the silica surface and the formation of interfacial bonds between oxides (Machado, Alves & Machado, 2019; Li et al., 2013). It was also found that the behavior of the mean maximum deformation was inversely proportional to the average crystallite size, since the formation of interfacial bonds tends to compromise the integrity of the anatase and brookite crystals. According to Staykov (Staykov et al., 2017), the strong Si-O-Ti bonds at the composite interface tensions the crystalline network of TiO2 and can change the coordination sphere of Ti4+ from six to five coordinated O2−. Thus, the increase in silica concentration in the TiO2 structure leads to an increase in tension in the crystalline network, which tends to increase the average deformation of the material (Staykov et al., 2017).\n\nAs well as the diffractograms obtained by X-ray diffraction, the Raman spectra shown in Fig. 3 also evidence the biphasic composition of these photocatalysts. The active modes corresponding to the anatase phase are located at 144 cm−1 (Eg), 197 cm−1 (Eg), 399 cm−1 (B1g), 513 cm−1 (A1g), 519 cm−1 (B1g) and 639 cm−1 (Eg) (Staykov et al., 2017; Sekiya et al., 2001). For the analyzed samples, five of these main bands are observed in the following regions: 144 cm−1 (Eg), 198 cm−1 (Eg), 399 cm−1 (B1g), 519 cm−1 (B1g) and 640 cm−1 (Eg). The mode A1g at 513 cm−1 was probably not visualized due to its low intensity in combination with the overlay of the mode B1g, more intense and close to 519 cm−1 (Iliev, Hadjiev & Litvinchuck, 2013; Fang et al., 2015). In the insert in Fig. 3, between 200 and 500 cm−1 four subtle bands attributed to the brookite phase are observed in 245 cm−1 (A1g), 321 cm−1 (B1g), 365 cm−1 (B2g) and 452 cm−1 (B3g). The band of higher intensity for the phase brookite is close to 153 cm−1 (A1g). It may be overlapthed with the anatase band, much more intense, at 144 cm−1 (Eg), which should influence the wider width of this Raman mode (Yin et al., 2007; Hellawell et al., 2015). In Fig. S8, the Raman spectrum of pure silica is shown, in the spectrum well-defined Raman bands between 200 and 600 cm−1 are not observed, but it has a single wide band between 1,000 and 2,250 cm−1, characteristic of tetrahedrons SiO4 jitters typical of amorphous SiO2 as shown by X-ray diffraction (Sahoo, Arora & Sridharan, 2009).\n\nThe estimated values for Eg from the diffuse reflectance spectra, Fig. 4, are 3.25 eV for W50, 3.32 eV for W50S25 and W50S50, and 3.35 eV for W50S75. These results agree with the reported in the literature, which suggests an Eg of approximately 3.2 eV for pure TiO2 (Neto et al., 2017). As observed above, the estimated value for Eg for the synthetized composites is slightly higher, probably due the formation of interfacial bonds (Si-O-Ti), which tends to change the electronic frontier states. In addition, it is known that the electronic properties of particles tend to change significantly with the reduction of their size due the occurrence of quantum confinement, which tends to increase the Eg value (Kumar & Devi, 2011). As the results obtained by TEM and XRD suggest, composites that have higher silica content in their composition have smaller particulate and crystalline sizes and consequently higher Eg values. It is worth noting that amorphous silica possesses Eg higher than 8.0 eV (Machado, Alves & Machado, 2019; Nekrashevich & Gritsenko, 2014).\n\nPhotocatalytic production of H2 in a bench-scale\n\nBeing known the morphological and optical properties of the materials presented in this work, the photocatalytic activity regarding the photocatalytic production of hydrogen was evaluated through bench-scale tests under UV-vis irradiation. After defining the most efficient photocatalyst, its potential for reuse was evaluated. Following, the performance of these same composites in the production of H2, compared to that of pure oxide, was evaluated using a solar simulator.\n\nIt is observed, from Fig. 5, that the synthesized composites obtained better performance in the production of H2 than the pure oxide (W50), with the exception of W50S75, responsible for the lowest productivity of the set, about 20% less than that achieved using the W50. As observed in SEM images along with histograms and EDS spectra, the poor performance of the W50S75 should be attributed to excess of free silica, photocatalytically inert, in its composition. The most efficient composite, W50S50, produced approximately 13.5 mmols of H2 in 5 h of reaction, performance 40% higher than that obtained using the W50, which produced about 9.6 mmols in the same time interval. Using the W50S25, a production of 11.0 mmols was achieved, a value approximately 14% higher than that obtained using pure oxide. It is noteworthy that H2 production tests were also performed using pure silica associated with platinum and platinum powder. However, as expected, no H2 production was obtained in both situations, in 5 h of reaction.\n\nThe more efficient production of H2 by W50S50 was favored by the higher anatase/brookite heterophasic crystalline composition, possibly due the more negative cathode potential of the conduction band of the brookite phase. This tends to favor the reduction of protons during the production of H2 (Patrocinio et al., 2015; Machado & Machado, 2020; Tay et al., 2013). Morphological aspects, such as the high surface area, high porosity and lower particle size, should also contribute to potentiate the photocatalytic activity of this oxide.\n\nIn a previous study published by us (Machado, Alves & Machado, 2019) 5.5 mmols of H2 were produced in 5 h of reaction, which is equivalent to a SRHP of 13.6 mmol g−1 h−1, using a TiO2/SiO2 composite based on TiO2 100% anatase, and approximate composition of 80% of TiO2 and 20% of SiO2. The increase in photocatalytic performance in terms of H2 production using the biphasic composite W50S50 is indisputable since, using these same experimental conditions, it was achieved, in the present study, a SRHP approximately two and a half times larger. Regarding a comparison of the photocatalytic action of W50S50 and the other catalysts evaluated in the present study with other catalysts reported in the literature, developed for the same purpose, it is worth mentioning the work of Lin and coworkers (Lin, Yang & Wang, 2011) who evaluated the efficiency of Nb2O5 combined with different metals as cocatalyst. They used a halogen lamp of 400 W as radiation font and aqueous solutions containing 20% of methanol. Under the best conditions, using platinum as cocatalyst, a SRHP of 4.6 mmol h−1g−1 was reached. In the present study, using W50S50 as catalyst, a SRHP seven times higher was achieved. In a study involving the photodeposition of CuO on the surface of ZnO, Liu and coworkers obtained, under the best conditions, a SRHP of 1.7 mmol h−1g−1 (Liu et al., 2011), using the catalyst suspended in aqueous solutions containing 10% v/v of methanol and irradiated by a 400 W mercury vapor lamp. Also, using the composite W50S50 as catalyst, we obtained a much higher SRHP.\n\nPotential for reuse of W50S50 for H2 production in a bench-scale\n\nThe evaluation of the potential of reuse of the photocatalyst consisted of measuring the reproducibility of catalytic action of the W50S50 by repetitive tests, called cycles, using the same initial conditions applied to the system, only with the pH of the medium being adjusted at the beginning of each additional cycle. The reuse assays were performed in sequence of four photocatalytic cycles, each involving 5 h of reaction. The first cycle was equivalent to the H2 production test carried out in a single cycle of 5 h.\n\nFigure 6 shows the very good stability in H2 production in each cycle, which maintains, individually per cycle, a regular upward pattern, within 20 h of the tests. However, there is a subtle decrease in production in each cycle when compared to the previous cycle.\n\nTable 3, that contains the compilation of Fig. 6 data, shows the number of mols of H2 produced in each cycle of reuse together with the respective SRHP. There was a reduction of approximately 18% in the production of H2 between the first and last cycle. The SRHP of 32.0 mmol h−1g−1 reached in the first cycle was reduced to 31.0 mmol h−1g−1 in the second cycle, an almost equivalent value, whereas in the last cycle this value was reduced to 26.0 mmol h−1g−1. This can be attributed to the exhaustion of the sacrificial reagent stock. Methanol, when oxidized, tends to become formaldehyde and formic acid (Mcmurry, 2011). The pH at the end of each cycle was monitored in order to qualitatively verify the formation of formic acid during the reaction. In fact, it was observed that the pH was reduced during the reuse cycles. From the third cycle, a significant reduction in the pH as well as of SRHP is evident.\n\nFigure 7 shows the amount of H produced by each photocatalyst using the solar simulator, accompanied by their respective standard deviations. It is observed that the compound W50S50 maintains a high performance in comparison with pure oxide. Similar to that observed in bench-scale production, the production using this composite is also approximately 40% higher. Despite the electronic absorption by this material is subtly shifted to the region of higher energies (Fig. 4), its production in 5 h of reaction was 25 μmols against 18 μmols using the pure oxide, which is equivalent to, respectively, SRHPs of 66.6 and 48.0 μmol g−1h−1. Thus, it is clear that the synergism between SiO2 and TiO2 tends to favor the photocatalytic activity in the production of H2. Even with the subtle hypsochromic displacement observed, in the mediation of the photocatalytic process by the solar simulator using the composite, the result was superior than that achieved using pure oxide.\n\nDue the amount of H2 produced using the solar simulator and the detection limit of the gas chromatograph, in this experiment it was not possible to monitor the temporal evolution of H2. In this case, only aliquots collected with 5 h of reaction were analyzed, and each experiment was replicated at least three times."
