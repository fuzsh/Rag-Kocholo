These are people who, with their art, help us to understand and feel music, creating, improvising and risking.\n\nIt occurs with music from different periods and styles. But lets go to where we belong, to what moves us, Flamenco, of course.\n\nWithout detracting from the rest of musical genres, Flamenco is the most powerful music in this sense.\n\nWe notice that when you see “baile”, “toque” or “cante” Flamenco it touches your soul, no matter where you come from. We associate this statement with the reiterated feeling produced when someone completely unconnected to this discipline is moved when they see flamenco “baile”, “toque” or “cante” .\n\nThere are songs that seem to have been composed for oneself, as if the author knew us. The identification we feel when listening to certain songs is so great that sometimes it is inevitable to get excited.\n\nDo you happen to have any of the selected?"
