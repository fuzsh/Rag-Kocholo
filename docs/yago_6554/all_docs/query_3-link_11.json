        "text": "Martín Sanchez recalls standing at the rear of his downtown Riverside property, gazing toward the street and wondering how to make his new taqueria stand out.\n\n“I had a vision. I wanted to make something different and unique. The world has a lot of restaurants,” Sanchez says 30 years later. “If you find a memorable restaurant, you remember it all your life.”\n\nSanchez had more than a vision: He had recyclables. Bottles, jugs and cans were piling up on his lot. Because he grew up poor, he doesn’t like to throw things away that might have a second use.\n\n“Little by little,” Sanchez says, “I make something.”\n\nWhat he made from those found objects was a fantasia of whimsical sculptures, planters, fountains, tableaus and structures that decorate the 1-acre surroundings of his restaurant, Tio’s Tacos.\n\nSanchez’s folk-art sculpture garden has put Tio’s on the map as an unofficial city landmark, boosted by the Food Network, KCET, LAist, Westways and, why not, MTV’s “Extreme Cribs.”\n\nWhat crystallized Tio’s status for me was when reader Roger Kessinger told me succinctly: “It’s the Watts Towers of Riverside.”\n\nI visited with Sanchez, the Simon Rodia of Riverside, last week. His oldest daughter, Stephanie, joined us.\n\nWork is what he’s known since age 5, when he washed cars, tidied yards and lugged groceries after his father died. He left Sayuaho, Michoacán, Mexico in 1984 for L.A. and kept hustling: working at a food truck, selling bags of oranges by the freeway.\n\nHe got a Green Card as a permanent resident in 1986. Returning to Mexico, he married his fiancee, Concepcion, in 1988 before they moved to Riverside, where she had relatives. Weekdays he worked in a factory making mobile homes; weekends he hawked nuts and fruit from a cart, upgrading to hot dogs and then tacos.\n\nIn 1990, a small restaurant on Mission Inn Avenue was available and the Sanchezes decided to rent it. Filling out the paperwork for a health permit, Martin was asked a name for his business. He hadn’t thought that far. “Put ‘Tio’s Tacos,’” his wife said.\n\nUncle’s Tacos? Por qué? Even as a boy, Martín was called “Tio” by younger children because they looked up to him. The nickname stuck.\n\nMartín and Concepcion worked hard at Tio’s — you could say they refused to cry “uncle” — to make it a success. Then Martín had his vision and began assembling the front patio and its fountain, then a pond in back and a little chapel.\n\nThe chapel, built to thank God for what Sanchez has been given, has walls made largely of hundreds of beer bottles and might hold a dozen people, who would sit on pieces of a bunk bed cut up into benches.\n\nAngels in a chapel mural have the faces of his three daughters: Stephanie, Kimberly and Maiten. A painted Jesus holds a three-dimensional “crown” from Stephanie’s quinceañera.\n\nOh my.\n\nMore projects followed: rusted bicycles turned into planters, tin cans turned into sunflowers, a figure in a dress made of dozens of old Barbie dolls. Two 30-foot statues in cowboy boots along the street frontage are made of aluminum cans inside wire mesh.\n\nVisitors wander around in delight and awe. I ask if Sanchez thinks of this as a sculpture garden. He says it’s merely “Martín y Sus Chingaderas” — basically, Martín and His Random Stuff.\n\nIs it completed? It might seem that way, especially after he added a 90-foot-long replica of Mexico’s presidential plane along the fence. But he’d like to get all the fountains pumping again, upgrade some pieces, build a Noah’s Ark — little things like that.\n\n“When I pass away, it is done,” Sanchez, 55, says with a broad smile.\n\nThis creativity dates to Sanchez’s boyhood, when he made do with what he had. Children with toy cars wanted to play on the tiny roads he’d fashioned from rocks, complete with a miniature gas station with used batteries as fuel pumps.\n\nRepeating this sense of play on a large scale in Riverside had the desired effect on customers. “They look around, ‘who make?’” Sanchez says with a wide-eyed look.\n\nBut that took time. As a restaurateur, it’s a little hard to get across to people, especially your own family, that you’re saving thousands of bottles so you can build a chapel. Even today, his daughters hurriedly dispose of their own garbage before dad can pick through it.\n\nI ask about the early reaction around town.\n\n“A lot of complaints,” Sanchez says with an uneasy laugh. “We went two, three times a month to City Hall.” He would bring Stephanie to try to translate the adult conversations. She was 6.\n\n“He wasn’t from here. He had a dream, a vision,” Stephanie says, excusing herself for a cry.\n\nAttitudes changed. The Riverside Art Museum commissioned a sculpture by Sanchez made from 1,100 cans of tomato paste. Mariposa Alley’s butterfly wall was done by him for the city of Riverside, which on its web page for the alley calls the restaurant “beloved.”\n\nTio’s is in full compliance with city zoning and has no code enforcement issues, according to a city spokesman.\n\n“Now, the city, we work together,” Sanchez says proudly.\n\nStephanie adds: “They say, ‘when you come to Riverside, check out the Mission Inn and Tio’s Tacos.’”\n\nTio’s wouldn’t exist without a benefactor, the former landlord who helped Sanchez buy the property for $130,000 with no credit because he liked Martín’s work ethic.\n\nNext door to the east, a former bus yard is home to the city’s new Main Library, which looks like a spaceship docked atop two pylons. That’s what prompts this column: the contrast between the ramshackle, handmade Tio’s and the gleaming, $43 million library just across a fire lane.\n\nHas the library brought customers to Tio’s? It has. You can see Tio’s (and the presidential plane) from its third-floor balcony.\n\n“The library is so futuristic. It’s like a monument,” Stephanie says. “And we’re next door with cans and glass bottles.”\n\nSpeaking of which: What does Martín Sanchez think of the Watts Towers?\n\n“Oh, it’s the best,” Sanchez says, beaming. “He was a genius. It’s the same deal. It was a dream.”\n\nDavid Allen writes Sunday, Wednesday and Friday, three columns of chingaderas.
