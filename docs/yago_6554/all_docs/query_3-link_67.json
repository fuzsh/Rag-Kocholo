        "text": "INVERSE 2023 is a four-day performance art festival presented by the Momentary in Bentonville, Arkansas.\n\nEmploying liveness, experimentation, and radical approaches to the important issues of our moment, the festival features more than 50 artists and projects who are in constant interrogation of material, form, and gesture to offer new ideas and perspectives on how we experience the world.\n\nINVERSE 2023 kicks off with a night of film and performance with performance art legends La Pocha Nostra. Back again after an amazing performance at the Momentary in January, Balitronica, Gómez-Peña, Emma Tramposch, and EmaLee Arroyo have returned for a three-week residency culminating in the INVERSE Performance Art Festival.\n\nWhat is Performance Art?\n\nPerformance is grounded in community, gathering, and the collective. At this year’s INVERSE, artists from all over the country and your own backyard invite you to celebrate being together through liveness.\n\nYou may find yourself asking:\n\n(form) – Is this dance? Is this theatre? What makes this painting different than others I’ve experienced? Consider what you know about these forms, what your expectations are.\n\n(participation) – What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to join? What if I just watch? Consider how you’re feeling, what the artist is doing, any cues you can take from those surrounding you. Lean in to your urge to join in, or to sit still. Embrace a moment of joy or discomfort.\n\n(legitimacy) Is this art? I think this is stupid. Think about performance art like live cinema. Consider the environment, the actors, the dialogue, the sounds…with performance art you are also now able to consider the additional senses of smell, taste and touch. The fully immersive, live quality is what makes this work so weird, and so fun.\n\nWe hope you’ll join us in the celebration. See you there.\n\nChung Park\n\nGimjang_김장\n\nDuration: 3 hours\n\nFayetteville, Arkansas-based artist Chung Park will perform Gimjang_김장, a durational performance of making kimchi as a way to connect with personal and family history.\n\nGimjang is a traditional Korean practice of preparing and preserving large amounts of kimchi for the winter season. The performance locates spaces of comfort and care and carries on cultural traditions that tend to fade away when immigrant families participate in the project of assimilation.\n\nUnderstanding that art is rooted in imperial and colonial histories, this performance represents one pathway to reclaim art as a site of liberation. As the INVERSE festival will be held at the beginning of November, which is usually the time when gimjang takes place, this performance will be timely in the space.\n\nChelsea A. Flowers\n\nAlternative Trivia\n\nDuration: Approx. 90 mins.\n\nDetroit-based artist Chelsea A. Flowers will perform Alternative Trivia.\n\nAlternative trivia is a game that tests social, cultural, and emotional knowledge, by questioning; “What day did Beyoncé turn Black?”\n\n“Can you do the hokey pokey?”\n\nIt also wants to know if Bill and Hilary Clinton would be invited to the cookout?\n\nThe questions surrounding Alternative Trivia are not just about Black culture or pop culture, they’re about American culture and how we all fit into it.\n\nRegistration required. Reserve your spot online during ticket checkout.\n\nJessica Hale and Heidee Lyn Alsdorf\n\nMotion Picture Play: inHabit\n\nDuration: 2 hours\n\nMotion Picture Play: inHabit is an invitation for local individuals to participate in the spontaneous production of a dance film. This two-hour event held inside the RØDE House will be co-facilitated by Jessica Hale (Bentonville, AR) and Heidee Lyn Alsdorf (Bentonville, AR).\n\nThis project is an immersive artistic endeavor that embodies the power of multiplicity and individual agency in fostering communal action and enriching social experiences within Northwest Arkansas communities. Blending elements of performance, structured gameplay, and behind-the-scenes video shoots, this project creates a tapestry celebrating the diverse voices and experiences of those who choose to play!\n\nJefferson Pinder\n\nMonumental\n\nDuration: Approx. 30 mins.\n\nChicago-based artist Jefferson Pinder will be performing Monumental.\n\nIn his arresting new work, Jefferson Pinder asks if the struggling body can be monumental. He struggles to maintain historically resonant poses while suspended on a harness vertically over a wooden block. By doing so, he brings to the heart of the art fair the ghosts of prior spectacles—ones that commodified, maimed, and killed particular struggling bodies. He tests his physical endurance to stay vertical and ascendant (afloat) while competing with various forces—gravity being only one of them. He compels the viewer to witness the historical layers of pain underlying what is an ongoing exertion. The risk of failure, of falling down exhausted, is omnipresent. This tenuous labor constantly threatens the possibilities of the monumental: respect, remembrance, and being seen."
