        "text": "There are plenty of places to eat in downtown Riverside but one restaurant stands out -- and not just for its Michoacán-style chicken soft taco plate.\n\nThe front patio of Tio's Tacos, located on Mission Inn Ave., features a pair of towering sculptures, a 30-foot high man and woman, built from countless aluminum cans and old machine parts.\n\nThey're two of the more than 100 works of recycled art dotting the restaurant's one-acre property. It's like a vast outdoor museum, although Tio's Tacos owner and artist, Martin Sanchez, has a more humble description.\n\nHe refers to it as \"Martin and his trash.\"\n\nSanchez says his love of art began long before he knew what that word meant. He has been turning reusable items into works of art since he was a kid in Sayuaho, in Michoacán, Mexico.\n\nWhen Sanchez was four, his father, the source of his family's income, died, leaving them destitute. Along with his 10 siblings, Sanchez pitched in, doing odd jobs for people around town.\n\n\"I cleaned the shoes. I wash the car. It gave me a little money or something,\" he says.\n\nSince store-bought toys were out of the question, Martin made his own out of rocks, sticks, cardboard and whatever else he could find.\n\nThe first thing he made was a toy car, using a sardine can as the cab and caps from soda bottles as wheels. Soon, he had made enough toy cars to share.\n\n\"We played together, my friends and my brothers, but I think I have more imagination,\" Sanchez says.\n\nImagination eventually took a backseat to necessity.\n\nIn 1984, Sanchez came to the United States and settled in East L.A. He started selling oranges by freeway exits. Selling oranges turned into selling hot dogs, which turned into selling tacos.\n\nOnly five years after arriving in Southern California, he and his wife, Concepcion, opened Tio's Tacos in Riverside.\n\nFrom the start, the business was an all-hands-on-deck affair.\n\n\"I think getting into the family business was since we were born,\" says their 23-year-old daughter, Kim. \"Since my parents were always working, we were always here.\" Along with her two sisters, she now helps run the restaurant.\n\nA few years after Tio's opened, Martin's creativity was reignited. Kim had accumulated several old Barbie dolls, 99-Cent Store finds and plastic Happy Meal toys that didn't have much longevity.\n\n\"They would break easily and I would think that they didn't work any more, but my dad kinda got this spark of imagination and he did a statue out of all of 'em,\" Kim says.\n\nThat first statue, a woman made from bunches of small toys wired together and wearing rows of Barbies as a dress, still stands on the outskirts of the restaurant's patio.\n\nSanchez didn't stop there. He and his family had saved piles of recyclables that needed a home.\n\n\"When I live in Mexico, I don't have nothing,\" Sanchez says. \"When I come by the United States, I see that people throw away everything. I go to clean in the backyard, and I see that everything's recycle. And I think, 'I can make something with this recycle.'\"\n\nFast forward to today. Steps away from the Barbie statue are two life-sized figures of Star Wars droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, made from boom boxes, old remote controls and aluminum cans.\n\nLook down, and you'll spot old house keys embedded in the patio walkway. Look up, and you'll notice stuffed animals hang from a tree branch.\n\nAll this could look like a big mess but instead, in the great tradition of American outsider artists, it looks like one person's obsession.\n\nOne of the most stunning pieces is a walk-in teepee with thousands of beer bottles horizontally embedded in its gray cement walls. Sunlight beams through the bottles, casting green rays inside the teepee, which features a glistening chandelier adorned with aluminum bottle caps.\n\nThe patio is clean and colorful. If you pause to look at the ground near the entrance, you can see tiny handprints. They belong to Kim, who was about 7 years old when she placed her palms in that once wet cement.\n\n\"Anytime my dad would make cement, he would call us over and put our hands, so you kind of see that throughout the property,\" she says.\n\nFor Sanchez, walking with his daughter through the many works of art he has made, always stirs up memories.\n\nThere's the old playhouse that he built for Kim when she was a kid. More of Kim and her sisters' handprints show up here and there, embedded in the patio's cement floor.\n\nAlthough Sanchez smiles when he talks about his sculptures, if you ask him to name a favorite, he has another answer.\n\n\"My daughters and my wife. My family,\" he says. They are the main ingredient in Tio's Tacos success.\n\nAs for the sculptures, you don't have to pay a fee to see them. Martin Sanchez says anyone is welcome to stop in and look around, but don't expect to see them all in one visit."
