In this playlist, dive into the stories of 15 such artists featured in this year's showcase concert (March 28 at the Berklee Performance Center) and discover what their music means to the student performers interpreting their songs onstage. Through their diverse perspectives, we can gain deeper insights into the impact of these idols, offering a more nuanced view of their lyrics, styles, and music.\n\nListen to the playlist below, and read on to learn more about each artist and see what Berklee students say about them.\n\nTracklist and Notes\n\n1. “Caballo Viejo,” Simón Díaz\n\nSimón Díaz (1928–2014) was a Venezuelan singer, composer, and actor, celebrated as one of the most influential figures in Venezuelan music. Born in Barbacoas, Táchira State, Díaz’s career began in the 1950s, blending traditional Venezuelan folk music with contemporary elements to create a distinctive sound. He became widely known for his compositions, such as \"Caballo Viejo\" and \"Tonada de Luna Llena.” His charismatic personality and contributions to Venezuelan culture earned him the nickname Tío Simón (Uncle Simón). He is a symbolic figure of Venezuelan folklore and music and will forever be revered for his talent and cultural impact.\n\n“I grew up listening to him, and thanks to him, Venezuelan folkloric music had a bigger stage in Caracas’ music industry,” says Valentina Garcia, interpreting him at the Ídolos showcase. “If it weren’t for his influence, I probably wouldn’t be at Berklee. . . . No matter which part of the world you are in, we can all relate to his lyrics. The love and respect with which he treats and discusses all of the elements of his lyrics inspire me so much and makes me feel connected to the music when I perform these songs.”\n\n2. “El Alma en Los Labios,” Julio Jaramillo\n\nJulio Jaramillo (1935–1978) was an Ecuadorian singer known for his powerful voice and emotional performances in the pasillo, bolero, and vals genres. He earned the nickname El Ruiseñor de América (the Nightingale of America) for his iconic contributions to Latin American music. Despite a tragic personal life marked by struggles with alcoholism, Jaramillo's passionate singing and enduring hits like \"Nuestro Juramento\" and the classic \"El Aguacate\" continue to inspire fans across the region even after his death.\n\n“I grew up listening to boleros, waltzes, and tangos, and as a singer-songwriter, these genres shaped how I write and compose,” says Luisa Yamille, who will interpret Jaramillo at the showcase. “The song I am performing is very vulnerable and emotional, and during this process, I have learned a lot about connecting with the lyrics, the audience, and the artist's intent. . . . The genre resonates with me, with my writing style, and has been a great inspiration for me in these months.”\n\n3. “Reggaeton Latino,” Don Omar\n\nDon Omar, born William Omar Landrón Rivera in Puerto Rico in 1978, is a renowned reggaeton artist and actor. In the early 2000s, he became an essential figure in the genre's global expansion. His breakout hit \"Dale Don Dale\" catapulted him to success, followed by numerous chart-topping singles like \"Dile\" and \"Reggaeton Latino.\" He achieved widespread recognition with albums such as The Last Don and King of Kings, solidifying his status as a reggaeton icon.\n\nLaura Prias speaks to this, saying, “The stage presence that is necessary to be able to sing in this genre is what has captivated me. Nothing is [really] sung; it's more spoken, but [you] always remember the attitude with which you say things. . . . Don Omar always manages a very intense vibe. Still, it never feels overacted or exaggerated. . . . He has three things that I don't think many people consider when listening to him: attitude, connection with the audience, and intonation.”\n\n4. “Te He Querido, Te He Llorado,” Ivy Queen\n\nIvy Queen, born Martha Ivelisse Pesante Rodríguez in 1972 in Puerto Rico, is a renowned reggaeton artist and songwriter. She became a prominent figure in the genre during the late 1990s and early 2000s, thanks to her powerful voice, provocative lyrics, and fierce persona. Ivy Queen's breakthrough album \"Diva\" (2003) propelled her to international fame with hits like \"Quiero Bailar\" and \"Te He Querido, Te He Llorado.\" She has been recognized for her contributions to reggaeton as a female artist, breaking stereotypes and paving the way for future generations.\n\n“I am learning that I want to feel empowered and confident in my boldness, prominent character, and personality,” says Elianny Perez, who is taking on her role in the showcase. “Her great way of encouraging assertive and playful femininity has stuck out to me.”\n\n5. “En Barranquilla Me Quedo,” Joe Arroyo\n\nJoe Arroyo (1955–2011) was a Colombian singer and songwriter celebrated as one of the most influential figures in Latin music, particularly in tropical music. In the 1970s, he rose to fame as the lead singer of Fruko y sus Tesos, one of Colombia's most famous salsa bands. With his powerful voice and charismatic stage presence, he became known for hits like \"Rebelión\" and \"La Noche.\" His music blended various Caribbean rhythms with elements of Colombian folk, creating a different and vibrant array of sounds.\n\nUrsula Eyzaguirre, who will interpret Arroyo, says, “Being born and growing up in Peru helped me a lot because we listened to a lot of salsa there. I know Joe Arroyo's most famous songs, almost by family inheritance. He is an artist who managed to represent his country with the pride he deserves, and he didn't do it like anyone else. He was so different that his name had a subgenre of Colombian salsa. That's why he inspires me.”\n\n6. “Después de Todo,” Los Van Van\n\nLos Van Van is a Cuban band that formed in 1969, pioneering the modernization of traditional Cuban music by incorporating rock, funk, and jazz elements into their sound.

Willy's relaxing essence is unique, and it is something that I have to implement into my performing habits! Just to enjoy the moment and then let the music flow.”\n\n9. “11 y 6,” Fito Páez\n\nFito Páez is an Argentine singer-songwriter born in 1963.

Even the little things make the difference (how it feels for me or how the delivery is). I have been listening to Fito for as long as I can remember. So, it’s been incredible to impersonate Fito with my touch. Fito has given me so much that I feel this is my way to pay tribute to him,” Felipe Osorio says.\n\n10. “El Necio,” Silvio Rodriguez\n\nSilvio Rodríguez is a Cuban singer-songwriter born in 1946, renowned for his influential contributions to the Nueva Trova movement.
