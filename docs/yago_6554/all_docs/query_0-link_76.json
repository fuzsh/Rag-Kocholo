This dance was also performed in the department of La Paz in the municipality of Marcala and its surroundings.\n\nInvestigation of this dance started in 2004 and ended in the Holy Week of 2006 by Dr. Wilberto Bonilla Ríos. He initially submitted his findings about the dance to the Cuadro Nacional de Danzas Folklóricas de Honduras in 2006 while it was under the directorship of Carlos Valladares. The research was subsequently followed up and completed in 2010 by the Cuadro Nacional de Danzas Folklóricas under the directorship of Azucena Mendoza.\n\nThe research was informed primarily by Mr. Avilio Flores, who was originally from the village Nueva Esperanza. He learned and performed the dance from age 9 and learned the music on guitar from Mr. Emilio Gutiérrez, and professor Jubilado Víctor Dominguez who knew some about the dance because learned it in La Esperanza Intibucá. He contributed information about the beginning of the dance as well as the step and how to hold the partner, which he learned from his father when he was small. Rafael Manzanares Aguilar who first played the music with caramba and told us how he and his father made a different version of the caramba by adding a resonating wood box at the base of the arch to amplify the sound. Rafael also helped inform this dance by playing the music on the guitar.\n\nAccording to the informants, this piece was well known and always danced a little late when couples start to leave a fiesta by those who knew the steps, as these and the entire dance require practice to master. The music starts slowly and the dancers are initially cautious to follow the person who starts the fun. Others then start to join the dance until everyone is dancing. Often in a chain reaction, the first dancer finds a partner, than the first two find new partners, then those four find four fresh partners, until everyone is dancing. The dance was initially danced by adults but over time it changed until it is like children's music round and is practiced in that manner.\n\nThis piece had its peak in the 40s, being danced then for the last time before being rediscovered. Don Avilio Flores learned the music from Mr. Emilio Gutiérrez's recollection, and it they who interpreted the polka part of the dance, in other words, the fast part of the dance, running it on guitar as well as demonstrating the steps for the dance. The dance was usually played solo with string orchestra, and from time to time when an accordion. The dance has several holds, waltz grip, cat's nail grip.

Another version is that this woman liked this dance and that's why they said the Chunga dance in diminutive. This is embodied in a rural legend that a very popular and animated girl in one of the villages named Maria Jesús liked to demonstrate the dance steps and how to hold one's partner for this dance, so everyone followed her lead. It is said that she always asked musicians to play La Chunga. If she was busy in the kitchen and heard the music, she would stop whatever she was doing and begin dancing. If there was no one who wanted to dance with her when this happened, she would grab a broom as a partner, which made everyone laugh.\n\nThe dance is said to have lyrics but unfortunately these were already been lost when the dance was researched and there were no people who remembered them. So we only have the instrumental the melody instrumental.

In certain parts of the dance el moto places the plate so that another will stumble over it and let go of his partner to pick up the plate. At this time they changed partners and el moto thereby finds a partner leaving the other dancer with the plate. At other times el moto would spin the plate in the center of the room and point out a couple or say a number so that the man would have to release his partner and rush to reach the plate while it was still spinning. If he failed to do so, he had to perform a penance as well as lose his partner and become el moto, and the dancer who spun the plate would thereby get a partner.\n\nPolca de la Rosa\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.

It was provided to the National Folklore Office in the year of 2006 under the direction of the Mr. Carlos Valladares, but it was not finished, and subsequently it was reintroduced under Azucena Mendoza in April 2010\n\nThe informant of this piece for both dance and music was Mr. Avilio Flores originally from the village of Nueva Esperanza but resident in Esperanza Intibucá at the time. He said that this dance was performed for all types of village parties including birthdays, Day of the Patron Saint, or at any popular party.\n\nThe origin of the name Palito Verde is unknown, although it seems that it was a version of the Palo Verde dance from Santa Bárbara as there people from Santa Bárbara living in Intibucá, such as Don Leonidas Aguilar who perforrmed this dance exceptionally well. However, the people of Intibucá adopted and performed the dance as their own. So we can say that it is from Santa Barbára originally and continued in Nueva Esperanza\n\nAnother individual who made a special contribution in documenting this dance was was Professor Víctor David Dominguez who provided the opening melody of dance where the couples were to go out to dance and where the man did he was coming (a greeting of courtesy and respect) to the dancing couple like the other people who were at the party mainly if the person was coming to the party, this was done with a happy music in where the musicians sang a melody, \"Adentro palito verde, adentro, que están vailando»\".\n\nThe dance choreographically according to Don Avilio He always danced in groups of 3 couples and stressed that the place should be wide so that the dance had structure since according to the informant the couples were always always well aligned and between the dance, the boys made their way to the girl, in all the dance the couples go aligned in groups of three couples this was due to that the rooms were not very big or they were rectangular and not to trip were organized that form during the dance both the male and the woman they make a greeting or as they do Haman «La venia» which is a greeting where both approach and almost hit cheek to cheek, and the other greeting is the from the entrance of the dance where the dancers males take off their hats briefly and greet the girls crouching a little to the head and just like the women who are at the party to to be able to get a couple, that girl who want to dance with him will follow him to form a row knowing already that He will be your dancing partner.\n\nThis dance contains as a step a sliding xique and the music a waltz rhythm so it's called waltz but I doubt it's because of the composer Austrian Strauss, because they handle it like a musical rhythm where it's a mix between a waltz and a guapango talking about the way this made music, not as a degeneration of name of the composer you come. Don Avilio learned the dance to see his mother Dona Otilia Pineda and dona Francisca Villanueva, sister of don Pedro Villanueva, Don Carlos Tinoco that in the years forty He was already 45 years old and Don Leonidas Aguilar were the musicians who were starting to execute music, which started from 7 or 8 of the night which people asked for a lot for being a melody well sticky and romantic and where there was a lot of live joy and other screams like being («Viva Pedro Villanueva! \"And everyone answered\" Long live! \") Or if they did not say (\" May the elders of the town live! \"To which everyone said\" May they live! \") This was so that the party would be pleasant and as Don Avilio Flores says with the drinks over was more cheerful between smiles.\n\nHe also says that in this dance you could dance necessarily the boyfriend with the girlfriend or the wife with the husband because there was a lot of respect between the people from that place and they did it naturally and nobody was jealous for it because the family almost all of them were related and where It was also danced between members of the same family as brothers or uncles etc., this dance almost he was danced in the nineteen forties like the dance of Chunga leaving to dance in the fifties.\n\nThe music was played as is common in that area as string and accordion instruments, and the The clothes they wore were long suits with designs by Azacualpa, Chiligatoro and other costumes those villages that had in those times these were well colorful and quite wide and with enough pleats only that the majority at that time costumes They were white in color, both male and female.\n\nIn the woman was a comb on his head that could be different color according to your state marital. If it was yellow it was that he was rejecting her groom cleans as they say he was giving the cut, If it was red, I was committed to marriage and if it was white is that she was single and looked for suitor, the comb also was accompanied by a jasmine this was used because the jasmine gives a very pleasant and penetrating smell and it was used instead of perfume and also to decorate his head.\n\nThe man dressed in white with two sash a black fajon where he carried the machete and a belt for the pants, also wore a handkerchief blue or red on your neck and a white one to offer it to the dancing girl.\n\nDon Avilio learned the music of Mr. Carlos Tinoco and says he played it before listening to her from her parents and her parents' friends so it goes back to the late 1800's. When Don Avilio heard her for the first time was 9 years old which he learned by ear, and the music of the corrido At the beginning of the music was provided by an aunt of Professor Víctor.

The dance was performed frequently there, but also in surrounding municipalities including San Antonio Del Norte, Aguanqueterique; Caridad Valle, and Lamani. The inhabitants of San Juan knew the dance El Zapateado, but as there were other dances with that name, Paceño was appended to the name so that it could be distinguished by residents of the many municipalities of the department Of La Paz that performed this dance.\n\nThis dance was researched and documented in the municipality of San Juan by Dr. Wilberto Bonilla Ríos in the years 2008 to 2010. His informants for this dance were Doña Prudenciana Ríos and Maria Antonia Almendarez, who were respectively 90 and 85 years old at the time.\n\nThe dance was performed frequently since the late 1800s and early 1900s. It was danced mainly for January 14 which is the day of Saint San Juan, who is the patron saint of the municipality, and also at weddings. It was also danced on June 24, the day of the carreras de cintas, in which the winner of the races, danced with the coronation queen in the town hall. The carrera de cintas, or belt race, is a traditional race on horse or bicycle often staged during the feria patronal in Spain and Latin America.\n\nThis dance is of mestizo origin with republican influence by what can be recognized as Creole, since the steps and moves are similar to European and Mexican steps, with some indigenous influence. The original music was played in mandolin, guitar, accordion, caramba and violin. In the 1950s the marimba and then wind band accompaniment. These last two came with radio and recordings, so not as might have been found in traditional settings.\n\nThe dance acquired the name zapateado (which means to tab dance) because the steps are tapped, some more than others. Wealthier men liked to dance with spurs on the shoes to add the ringing sound when they stepped. The women liked to show off their best costumes and tried to turn alot to spread the dresses and shown off in that way. For the men, the dance is performed with military posture, which may have been due to the influx of mounted police in that time. One of the informants said that her great grandmother liked the dance because part of the choreography is galloping, and when there were more women at parties then men, the women danced between the men, from corner to corner of the hall, causing all to give way before them. The men on the other hand competed to show off their best steps. Pine sprigs were placed on the earthen floors to perfume the ballroom, and the floors were deformed by the steps of the dancers. The ballroom was lit with candles or wood fires outside, as there was no electric lighting at the time.\n\nThis dance is very complex. It is danced in squared and circled rows, with dancers moving from corners to corners. As it is a rather agitated dance it was typically only danced by the most coordinated dancers. The origin of the dance music is not known since. The music is very simple making repetitions of a same chord for many minutes, similar to La Correa, in which the music was not well stylized but very cheerful, which was what the dancers cared for in that time. They typically danced this piece of 4 to 6 minutes, or until the dancers tired, and then they would dance a waltz a colonial dance to rest after a good Zapateado.\n\nLa Zarandita\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nWatch Video Academia Interamericano Meridon Watch Video Grupo Proyeccion Folclorica Celaque Watch Video Ballet Folklórico Oro Lenca (México, 2014)\n\nThis mestizo dance was popular at parties.
