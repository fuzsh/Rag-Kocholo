        "text": "Bruno Madrigal is a major character in Disney's 2021 animated feature film Encanto. He is the only son and youngest child of Alma and Pedro Madrigal, and youngest sibling of Julieta and Pepa. He was gifted with the ability to see the future.\n\nBruno's odd demeanor, affinity with rats, and often doomsaying visions had distinguished him as the \"black sheep\" of the Madrigals, resulting in his estrangement from the family. Following his disappearance, it became taboo to mention Bruno, who was reviled as a villainous figure by the townsfolk until his deep-rooted love for his family was unearthed.\n\nBackground[]\n\nBruno is the youngest of the fraternal triplets and the only son of Alma and Pedro, his siblings being Julieta and Pepa. In addition to being the brother-in-law of Félix and Agustín, Bruno is also the maternal uncle of Isabela, Dolores, Luisa, Camilo, Mirabel, and Antonio. When he was just born, their home was attacked and his family was forced to flee. After his father's death, a miracle was created that blessed the family with an enchanted house and protection from the raiders. Five years later, Bruno and his two siblings opened their magical doors in the house, revealing their powers. Bruno was given the ability to see into the future, which caused misery to his hometown because of his often cryptic visions and their bleak outcomes (such as supposedly having visions that a lady's goldfish would die, a man would grow a gut, and the town's priest would lose his hair). He also was in attendance at his sister Pepa's wedding to her husband Félix, and, noticing her anxiety, he tried to lighten the mood by joking that it \"looked like rain.\" Pepa, however, believed he was sharing a vision, and her weather-related powers and anxiety caused her to unleash a hurricane on the previously-sunny wedding day.\n\nBecause of his unwelcome gift, he was considered the black sheep of the Madrigal family. Bruno's relationship with his mother Alma worsened over the years as she often doubted his capacity to help his family and community, causing Bruno to distance himself from the family. Despite this, he had some impact in Isabela and Dolores' youth, where he had visions where the former would gain a prosperous life and her powers would grow stronger while the latter's true love would be betrothed to another, which unintentionally it would cause various traumas for both of them as they grew up (increasing pressure from Isabela to meet Abuela's expectations of perfection and Dolores would grow up believing she could never be with the man she loved). After a young Mirabel did not get a gift on the night of her gift ceremony, Abuela worried about the family's magic and asked Bruno to see what the future showed. He had a vision with two possible outcomes: Mirabel in front of Casa Madrigal, one with the house intact and the other with the house breaking. Due to the typically negative outcomes of his prophecies and how everyone always assumes the worst in them, Bruno scatters the vision slab and hid himself from everyone to protect Mirabel from being blamed.\n\nBecause he disappeared without saying anything, Alma's bad thoughts about her son increased to the point that she would think that Bruno never cared about the family. His name was then considered taboo among his family (particularly to Pepa, who held a grudge against him for \"ruining\" her and Félix's wedding) and the townsfolk. However, Bruno loved his family too much to truly go away, and so he stayed hidden in the walls of the house for ten years and spent much of his time within the walls patching up cracks as they manifested. Nobody knew his actual location except Dolores, who said nothing in his decade of absence despite her strong dislike of keeping secrets. Because Bruno was withdrawn when he was still in the house, Luisa, Camilo, and Mirabel would grow up with little to no memory of him. Luisa would only remember the day he left and the family's reaction to his disappearance, Camilo would grow up listening to the some rumors that the family and the townspeople said about him, and Mirabel would have very little knowledge about Bruno except the fact that suddenly disappeared.[3][4] About five years after his disappearance, his youngest nephew Antonio would be born, with whom Bruno would never have contact because he was still hiding in the house.\n\nOfficial Description[]\n\nThough the estranged Bruno was gifted with visions of the future, the family believed that Bruno's visions were causing the misfortune. As such, he mysteriously disappeared from Casa Madrigal.[5]\n\nThe third of Alma's triplets, Bruno has been estranged from the Madrigal family for as long as Luisa, Camilo, and Mirabel can remember. Gifted with the ability to see the future, he made honest but often doomsaying predictions that proved problematic for Abuela and the rest of the family so he disappeared, becoming the uncle nobody talks about.[6]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nAs with the rest of the Madrigal family, Bruno was designed to reflect \"family archetypes that are immediately relatable\".[7] Bruno was one of the characters in the film that had the most changes and designs before reaching his final version. The studio initially created Bruno as one of Mirabel's cousins before changing to her uncle. During the creation process, Bruno in other concepts was also originally going to have a bigger and fatter body, but his costume was always meant to be the old ceremonial outfit that he used to wear when he was having visions of the future for the people that came to see him. Another thing that was not changed, apart from his taste for rats and the theater, was his role as the Black Sheep of the family and to create his personality a lot of research was done on people who are confined and don't have human communication.[8]\n\nBruno's voice actor, John Leguizamo, described his character: \"Well, Bruno is that relative that always says the wrong thing at every party, who wrecks every holiday, because they're always talking too much. And so, that's who I am. I'm Bruno. I'm that uncle that they try to get rid of. And they do get rid of him in this movie. And I relate to him because I had that bit of a issue. I was always talking too much, saying everything nobody wanted to – was afraid to say… I was the black sheep of the family, so I relate to Bruno.\"[9]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nDue to the nature of his gift of precognition, Bruno has been labeled as someone who \"makes bad things happen\" by both the village and his family when he is merely the requested bearer of the news. Despite being feared by almost the entire village, Bruno is actually kind-hearted, caring, fairly comical, and possesses a strong love and loyalty towards his family. Although he is described as a monstrous and sadistic person, Bruno is a quiet, shy, and kind man who easily becomes nervous and suffers from anxiety, like his sister, Pepa. Bruno is introduced in the film as insecure and avoidant, and believes others' accusations that his gift only brings problems. However, after he is fully reaccepted into his family, he becomes more cheerful and enthusiastic. Bruno is also shown to be gentle with animals in a way similar to his youngest nephew, Antonio. He befriended the rats living within the walls of the Casa Madrigal, sharing what little food he has with them and enjoying their company. When the house crumbles, he takes the rats with him before making his escape. Bruno also takes quickly to Antonio's animal friends, letting his capybara's join the vision and allowing the coatimundi, who he shooed away prior to his vision, to hang from his shoulder. He was also good to the horse he presumably found and rode on to find Mirabel and Alma after Casita's destruction.\n\nNot much is known about his personality before he left the family, but it is known that whenever he had a prophecy, he inadvertently hurt or angered the people around him, causing him to retreat from society and eventually from his family to avoid upsetting anyone. His gift made him paranoid and fearful of his surroundings, and he developed a sand-based ritual to help focus and control his power. As a result of living for ten years in isolation within the walls of the Casa Madrigal, Bruno developed odd behaviors, such as knocking on wood, stumbling, muttering, and developing two alternate identities: \"Hernando\", who is \"scared of nothing\" and \"Jorge\", who makes spackle, to keep himself occupied in his isolation, along with befriending some rats to keep him company. Yet, despite claiming he is fine with his isolation from his family, Bruno actually misses them and wished to be with them, despite their negative perceptions of him. He shares a complicated relationship with his mother Alma that had become strained due to his gift not living up to her expectations and that she only saw the worst in him. As a result of his mother's difficult attitude, Bruno was intimidated by her and tried to avoid her, even though he wanted to make her proud.\n\nHe is very selfless man and his biggest acts of selflessness is catalyzed by his love for his family. Despite the way some treated him when he was around and didn't like to talk about him after he left, Bruno is not spiteful or vindictive and has a forgiving heart. When he was reunited with his mother, he never showed hate towards Alma nor did he reject her loving gestures in spite of his confusion, and listened intently as she began to apologize to him and the rest of the family for her mistakes and redefined their miracle. He sacrificed his reputation and went into self-exile for a decade to protect Mirabel from being ostracized and treated the same way he had been after seeing an uncertain vision connecting her to their family's magic disappearing. Bruno was also willing to take the blame for Mirabel after the Casita's destruction. Initially fearful of being seen by Alma, Bruno revealed himself and prepared to confront his mother in defense of his niece before Alma, having now realized she and her idealism were the causes of their family's problems, embraced him, which surprises him completely. Although the townspeople were initially afraid of him due to his gift, Bruno happily works with them in rebuilding the house showing that he now has a close bond with them.\n\nBruno's greatest wish is to be able to help his family. Although he was initially avoidant of his mother because he was initially afraid of her, he does not feel the same way towards his older sisters or brothers-in-law. The misunderstanding at Pepa's wedding arose from his attempt to help her relax and embrace her emotions with an ill-worded joke. When they meet again, he made his first apology to her and Félix for inadvertently ruining their wedding by stressing her out with his comment, and sings to her how much he loves her and he wants her to be herself. With the exception of Camilo, who dramatizes Bruno as a demonic figure and was later confused by his return by being the only member of the family who never knew he's actually a good person, the younger generation does not have anything negative to say about him: Mirabel and Luisa still refer him as their uncle despite the taboo on his name and possessing little memory of him before he left, Dolores empathizes with his problems and chooses not to reveal his hiding in the house's walls despite the depressing vision he gave her when she was younger, Isabela is the only one to say something positive about him while everyone else speaks negatively of him, and Antonio, who has no memory of his uncle, is never afraid of him thanks to the rats and sees him as a friend.[10]\n\nPhysical appearance[]\n\nBruno is a thin and unkempt-looking 50-year-old[11] man with overgrown, curly black hair mixed with gray streaks, a big, prominent nose, whitely clean teeth, a thin unshaved mustache, and a light beard shaped like an hourglass on his chin. He has green hazel eyes, light freckles on his face, and prominent eye bags. Of his siblings, Bruno is the one who most resembles their late father, Pedro. He inherited most of his father's physical characteristics, but unlike Pedro, Bruno has an overly pale complexion. He wears a hooded, ripped up green ruana cuffed at the elbows with hourglass prints over a burgundy shirt that represent his gift, brown and dark pants, and black flip flops. When he uses his precognitive powers, his irises glow bright green. His clothes are visibly worn with his poncho being rough at the edges and his shirt collar being unbuttoned and loose, adding to his ragged look.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nPrecognition: Bruno has the ability to see the future. To help focus and cope with the taxing nature of his power, Bruno performs a ritual that requires a large, open space to properly see his visions, and initiates it by drawing a circle in sand and burning leaves.[12] He does not have full control of his ability and some visions can come involuntarily.[13][14] Bruno's visions are partly connected to his emotions: if he is fearful he will see a negative future and if he feels a strong emotion could trigger an involuntary vision.[15]\n\nOnce the vision is initiated, Bruno's irises glow bright emerald-green and the sand circle rises into the air to create a whirling dome of sand. Within the dome, the sand forms glowing green images that contain the visions. These images are not always clear on what happens, often leaving them up to interpretation and making them self-fulfilling, and they do not always progress in chronological order, but when he focuses on certain images, the vision increases in clarity. Someone else can be present within the sand circle and see the visions, and they can also help him focus on certain parts. When the vision ends, Bruno creates a thick emerald slab showing an image of the most significant detail of the vision. Even shattered into pieces the slabs continue to show the images. If the vision has multiple possible outcomes, the slab created can show the different outcomes by being titled at certain angles.\n\nHis knowledge of the future includes the future of entertainment, as he often has the rats that keep him company perform various TV programs such, as game shows and telenovelas decades before they happen.\n\nParkour: Despite a lack of formal training and being middle-aged, Bruno is a natural freerunner, able to quickly make his way through the confined spaces within the walls of Casa Madrigal. This could attributed by having spent a decade in the walls, and having knowledge of the obstacles. He was shown able to spryly weave through sticks connected between the walls and make it across a gap in three precise jumps without losing his momentum while chased by Mirabel.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nEncanto[]\n\nBruno first appears as an infant in his mother Alma's flashback, shortly after he and his sisters were born to her and Pedro. After his family was forced out of their home, during which his father was killed by soldiers, the family became blessed with magic and was given a new home. At the age of five, Bruno, along with his sisters Julieta and Pepa, were given magical gifts where he was given the ability to see the future. In the present, Bruno is no longer in the Madrigal family since he disappeared years ago without a trace and his name became a strong taboo in the Encanto.\n\nBruno is mentioned several times in the story by his family and the villagers before he actually makes his proper appearance. In \"The Family Madrigal\", Mirabel briefly tells the Town Kids about Bruno's ability to see into the future and how he suddenly disappeared from the house one day and became estranged from the family. During \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" the Madrigals start talking in different ways about Bruno, starting with Pepa and Félix who remember how Bruno ruined their wedding day. Dolores seems genuinely sympathetic towards Bruno and saying that it was hard for someone to have a gift like his. Having no memories of his uncle like Mirabel, Camilo turns into a version of Bruno with shining green eyes, with an evil grin and surrounded by rats, moving in sinister ways. And just like Dolores, Isabela doesn't relate to Bruno in a negative way and talks about a positive vision of her future that her uncle gave her when she was young.\n\nAfter it was revealed to the rest of the Madrigal family that magic and the Casita were in danger, Bruno was eventually discovered in the walls by Mirabel, who pursued him through the house. He initially outran her, but went back when he heard her calling for help, catching her before she fell down a hole. He fell into the hole himself, only to discover that it wasn't very deep. Mirabel begged Bruno to explain his vision to her, following him back to the space he'd been occupying adjacent to the kitchen and dining room. Over the time that he'd been hiding there, he had amassed a collection of odds and ends, as well as several pet rats, which he used to entertain himself by training them to act out telenovelas. Mirabel convinced Bruno to explain his vision, but Bruno initially refused to help Mirabel further when she asked him for another vision. She got him to agree when Antonio, with the aid of the rats to whom he could speak, also discovered them and offered up his room for Bruno to use for his vision.\n\nBruno accompanied Mirabel into Antonio's room, where he laid out a sand circle as part of his ritual. The house continued to shudder around them, prompting Mirabel to urge Bruno to hurry, but Bruno insisted they couldn't rush the future. Once the ritual circle was set up, Bruno warned Mirabel that she might not like what she would see, and expressed fear that she would blame him for causing the future. She reassured him that she didn't think he caused the future. Antonio offered Bruno his stuffed jaguar toy \"for the nerves,\" and Bruno relaxed and began his vision. The vision initially went the same way it had before, and Bruno wanted to quit, but Mirabel insisted on pressing on. She saw a golden butterfly and pointed it out. Mirabel and Bruno followed it, leading to a vision of the candle glowing brighter and Mirabel hugging an obscured figure. The image cleared to reveal Isabela, and the vision ended, leaving a glass tablet with the vision etched into it. Bruno was pleased to see a positive image of Mirabel and Isabela hugging, but when he saw that Mirabel was not happy with it, he threw the glass tablet aside in frustration. Bruno encouraged Mirabel to seek Isabela out and make amends with her, telling Mirabel that she was exactly what their family needed. He then went back into the walls for fear that his mother might find him. Before doing so, however, he invited Mirabel to come visit, and Mirabel in turn promised that after she saved the miracle, she would bring him home.\n\nLater on that day, the Casa Madrigal began crumbling after Mirabel and Alma gets into a heated argument about the latter not deeming anyone good enough for her as well as only seeing the worst in Bruno and doubting his loyalty to their family. As the house was coming down, Bruno ran through the walls grabbing his pet rats. He then put a bucket on his head and rammed through a nearby wall, falling out onto the lawn behind the house. After Casita fell, Bruno found a horse the next day and rode out of the valley to find Mirabel, who had ran away in guilt and sadness. He discovered her with Alma at the river and rode up to them, yelling that none of what had happened was Mirabel's fault. He argued his culpability in that he gave Mirabel a vision, and that she was only trying to help while Alma is shocked when she sees Bruno after ten years. Holding his ground, Bruno fiercely insisted that he didn't care what his mother thought of him as he prepared to reprove her, only to be suddenly embraced by Alma, who called him \"Brunito\" and kissed his cheeks, leaving him utterly confused as a content Mirabel directed them to ride back home.\n\nWhen the three returned to the rubble of the Casa Madrigal, Bruno initially hid shy of reuniting with the rest of their family. In \"All of You,\" he watches from hiding as his mother apologizes to the family for holding on too tight, fearing she would lose them too after losing Pedro, and redefining the miracle as just themselves rather than the magic. Bruno shyly approaches her as Alma calmly guided him to reunite with his sisters and he was immediately happy when they ran to hug him. While most of the Madrigals are overjoyed by his return, others are surprised by his sudden appearance. Camilo expressed enormous confusion with his presence and his siblings' familiarity in the situation, says that the family needs to talk about Bruno, to which the latter agrees. Bruno then began a string of apologies, including apologizing for Pepa's wedding and encouraging her to show her emotions freely, a sentiment Félix shared. When he attempts to apologize to Julieta for past indiscretions, his sisters and Agustín stopped him and hugged him as they expressed their joy that he was back with the family.\n\nWith family all together, everyone came together to fix the house and the entire town also pitched in as thanks for all the Madrigals had done for them over the decades. Bruno later helped with rebuilding the Casa Madrigal by working with the townspeople to mark different places with the sand. After completing the house, Mirabel added a doorknob the family made just for her to the front door, causing a new source of magic to be born that brings Casita back to life and returning the gifts of the Madrigals, but also making a new front door with all the Madrigals carved into it, including those who married into the family, Félix and Agustín. As they enter the Casa Madrigal, Bruno happily watches as his family members recover their powers and have fun with them. The Madrigals then celebrated the returned of their home and gifts with a family picture. As they posed for the photo and everyone shouting \"La Familia Madrigal\", Casita unexpectedly crushed the entire family, creating an imperfect family image.\n\nOnce Upon a Studio[]\n\nBruno returns alongside her family at the Disney Animation Studio for a group photo with all the characters from the previous films to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the studio and The Walt Disney Company's founding in 1923 by Walter Elias Disney and his brother Roy Oliver Disney.\n\nHe meets with the rest of the characters from the previous films for a group photo to celebrate the studio's 100th anniversary, hiding behind Kuzco and Pacha due to his shyness. After Goofy accidentally breaks the camera and everyone sadly prepares to return to the animation building, they hear Alan-A-Dale playing \"When You Wish Upon a Star\". The song improves everyone's spirit until they finally manage to successfully take a group photo. A photo of Bruno then appears in the end credits with his rats.\n\nDisney Parks[]\n\nBruno made his theme park debut during 2022's Oogie Boogie Bash at Disney California Adventure. Bruno was featured as one of the Disney villains that was available for meet-and-greets during the event (debuting alongside Madam Mim from The Sword in the Stone, Mother Gothel from Tangled, and Ernesto de la Cruz from Coco), with a backdrop modeled after his sand temple.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBruno's birthday is on October 17, which is the date of the start of the Thousand Days' War.[16][17] It is also a day to celebrate ethnic diversity in Colombia.\n\nContrary to Camilo's claim of his height, Bruno is shorter than his sisters, Julieta and Pepa.\n\nIn some early concept art, the character is instead called Oscar. The name Bruno was chosen by Lin-Manuel Miranda in order to fit the lyric \"Bruno, no, no, no\" into the song \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\".\n\nOther names Lin-Manuel Miranda considered for the character before settling on Bruno were⁏ Arlo, Anko, Andre, Emo, and Marco.[18]\n\nBruno is the only Madrigal who doesn't have a wife and children of his own due to his hiding in the walls of Casa Madrigal for a decade and his infamous reputation prior to his self-exile.\n\nDuring \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\", Dolores foreshadows the revelation (and hints her knowledge) that he never actually left.\n\nDuring her verse, a cloaked figure with glowing, green eyes, which Jared Bush confirms to be Bruno, can be seen walking along the first floor balcony in the background and bopping his head to the beat of the song.\n\nDolores also speaks about him in the present tense (\"I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling\").\n\nWhile Isabela is telling Mirabel to be quiet, Dolores says she can hear him now.\n\nDolores's knowledge of his presence in the walls is subtly implied with the painting that hides the entrance to the walls being next to her door.\n\nDue to their sensory powers, Bruno and Dolores are the only family members that their doors depict with eyes open. They are also the only two to not appear smiling on their doors.\n\nIt is possible Bruno's predictions about Señora Pezmuerto's fish dying, Osvaldo growing a gut, and Señor Flores's hair disappearing were actually just observations: Pezmuerto kept her fish in a small bowl, which fish are less likely to survive in; Osvaldo can be shown eating a jar of candy in \"What Else Can I Do\", in which uncurbed eating habits can lead to weight gain; and it's likely he just noticed Señor Flores's hair was thinning.\n\nDue to being left to interpretation, Bruno's visions often played out differently than expected:\n\nIsabela actually dislikes her status and idyllic life as the golden, perfect child; the life of her dreams really being having freedom to be her own person rather than conform to others' expectations.\n\nThe man Dolores loved doesn't marry his betrothed, who turned out to have no love for him and eventually breaks off their engagement, allowing her to confess her feelings for him.\n\nThe cracks' appearance and the magic fading was really from how Alma's perfectionism and expectations were affecting the family's emotional wellbeing and relationships, which Mirabel brings to light in an intense argument with her. Ultimately, both scenarios in the vision occur.\n\nMirabel would actually need to embrace Alma, not Isabela, to help the family, as the matriarch's unresolved grief had caused much of the family's generational trauma. He also unintentionally foreshadows Mirabel would clash with them before hugging.\n\nBruno performs several superstitious actions, such as knocking on wood in a rhythmic pattern and reciting the phrase \"Knock knock knock knock knock, knock on wood,\" throwing salt over his shoulder, avoiding stepping on cracks, muttering a healing song to himself, holding his breath while crossing his fingers, going through entrances backwards, and holding an upside down broom out to intruders of his space.\n\nAll these superstitions are associated with bringing good luck, repelling bad luck, and avoiding bringing harm to one's family.\n\nBruno performs these rituals to an excess that visually confuses and concerns Mirabel. According to the official script, this is meant to resemble obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nThe green motif for Bruno and his visions are a reference to the belief in Colombia that emeralds can predict the future. His vision tablets are made of solid emerald for this reason.\n\nAccording to Jared Bush, before leaving his family Bruno was already an introvert and not comfortable around people. He met some rats on his own and by the time he left, his rat count increased.[19]\n\nWhen living in the walls, Bruno gained access to water by diverting one of Casita's bamboo \"pipes.\"[20]\n\nBruno is similar to Héctor, the deuteragonist from Disney/Pixar's Coco (2017).\n\nThey are Hispanic characters, though Héctor is Mexican while Bruno a Colombian.\n\nBoth their families didn't like to talk about them at first for seemingly abandoning them; the Riveras were unaware that Héctor had actually been murdered in trying to return home to them while the Madrigals didn't know Bruno had left to prevent his dire vision from coming to pass. Two relatives, an authoritative one and a temperamental one (Imelda and Elena and Alma and Pepa), personally objected talking of them while a kind-hearted one (Coco and Julieta) harbored no ill will towards them and missed them.\n\nWith the sympathetic help from a younger relative (Miguel and Mirabel) who share similar aspects with them and learn the truth of their departure, they are accepted back into their family.\n\nThere was a wrong perception of them that is disproven; Héctor was remembered as a negligent father who abandoned his family for his music career while Bruno was thought as a dark, foreboding figure who deliberately caused misfortune with his gift.\n\nThey also have facial hair; Héctor has a goatee while Bruno has a thin beard and mustache.\n\nLiving in isolation and estranged from their family, their clothing was worn down and they possessed odd behaviors.\n\nThey have humorous dance.\n\nIt is possible that Bruno's personas \"Hernando\" and \"Jorge\" were created before he started living in the walls, rather than being a result of it, as he tells Mirabel that he \"used to say his real gift was acting\", thus implying he did impressions while he was still part of the family.\n\nIn a podcast, Jared Bush points out that due to the heartbreak and fear that Alma experienced at the riverside after seeing Pedro killed, once she learned of Bruno's powers, she found it impossible to resist pressuring him to frequently look into the future for threats and dangers to the Encanto. Thus, the observations that have been made about Bruno having a depressed attitude which led to him seeing bad futures is wrong. It's actually the opposite, pressure on him to always look for the worst the future has to offer is what left Bruno with a stressed, forlorn attitude.[21]\n\nBruno and Camilo are the only members of the family to wear traditional Colombian Ruanas.\n\nIt is likely Bruno found out about his vision cave getting destroyed by being informed by his pet rats, meaning he is able to communicate with them.\n\nThe walls in Bruno's secret room originally had art depicting his rat friends in imagined acting roles.[22]\n\nWhen helping to rebuild the Casa Madrigal with the townspeople, Bruno is drawing an outline of a to-be-built part in sand and when the house is complete, it looks just as it did before. Given how Bruno lived in the walls of the Casita for long, it's only natural that he has the layout of the house memorized.\n\nAs both \"Jorge\" and \"Hernando\", Bruno's eyes are covered by either his ruana or a bucket. He's also covering the body parts that have him see visions.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nBruno Madrigal on Wikipedia\n\nBruno on Encanto Wiki\n\nBruno on the Heroes Wiki\n\nMedia Encanto (soundtrack/video) • The Art of Encanto • Encanto at the Hollywood Bowl • Disney's Karaoke Series: Encanto • Disney Heroes: Battle Mode\n\nDisney Parks Disney Animation Building • The Tropical Americas (Encanto (attraction))\n\nEntertainment: ¡Celebración Encanto! • Fantasmic! • When You Wish\n\nParades: A Million Splashes of Colour • Disney Adventure Friends Cavalcade • Disney Starlight • Main Street Electrical Parade\n\nFireworks: Happily Ever After • World of Color: One • Wondrous Journeys\n\nCharacters Encanto: Mirabel Madrigal • Alma Madrigal • Bruno Madrigal • Isabela Madrigal • Luisa Madrigal • Dolores Madrigal • Camilo Madrigal• Antonio Madrigal • Pepa Madrigal • Julieta Madrigal • Félix Madrigal • Agustín Madrigal • Pedro Madrigal • Mariano Guzmán • Pico • Cerberus • Señora Guzmán • Osvaldo • Chispi • Parce • Town Kids • Soldiers • Village Donkeys • Antonio Madrigal's Animals • Bruno's Rats • Miracle Butterflies • Señora Ozma • Old Arturo • Tiple Maestro • Señor Rendon • Señor Flores • Lili • José\n\nDeleted: Zoe Madrigal • Fuega Madrigal • José Madrigal • Amelia and Sofía Madrigal • Miranda Madrigal • Princesa Madrigal • Bubo Marquez\n\nLocations Colombia • South America • Encanto • Casa Madrigal • Alma's Village\n\nSongs The Family Madrigal • Colombia, Mi Encanto • Waiting on a Miracle • En Barranquilla Me Quedo • Surface Pressure • We Don't Talk About Bruno • What Else Can I Do? • Dos Oruguitas • All of You\n\nSee also The Madrigals • Miracle Candle"
