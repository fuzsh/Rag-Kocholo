I have what the restaurant throws away.”\n\nSanchez’s love for his hometown of Sahuayo, in the Mexican state of Michoacánis, is reflected in many of his pieces.\n\n“Here we have ‘The Dance of the Old Men,’” Martín said as he pointed to a statue of traditional folk dancers in his back patio. “I always wanted to create different spaces. If you notice here, this dining area represents what my town is about.”\n\nHe said his art also represents a journey to heal a childlike wonder that was sacrificed a long time ago. Sanchez said it’s a sacrifice many immigrants face due to the pressure to provide for their families.\n\nAs a young boy, Sanchez loved to create toys made from scrap metal he found lying around. But after his father passed away, Sanchez had to work to contribute to the family’s finances.\n\nYears later, in 1984, at 16 years old, he immigrated to the United States and sold oranges on the side of the road in East Los Angeles. After some time, he opened a hot dog and taco cart business.\n\n“During the day, I’d sell hot dogs, and at night, I’d transform the cart to sell tacos,” Sanchez said. “And that’s how Tio’s Tacos was born.”\n\nSanchez saved money for six years to buy the land where Tio’s Tacos stands today. Yet, as he was growing his business, he felt a pressure inside him that needed to be released.\n\n“I released the boy that I’d hindered, that I had to freeze in order to become a responsible adult as a kid,” Martín said. “Then, when I reached this point as an adult, I let that boy out, and that’s when the art began.”\n\nHe started collecting garbage from his restaurant and neatly separated the recyclable materials into different piles for upcoming projects he envisioned in his head. Over time, the plot of land behind his restaurant became filled with trash, and it became extremely noticeable. It reached the point where his family chastised him for the mounting garbage near his restaurant.\n\n“I understood the sentiment from the people, from those around me,” Sanchez said. “But I saw the trash’s potential.”\n\nEventually, his trash piles would also catch the attention of the local government. He said he received complaints from the city. But as they saw this public eye-sore transform into a work of art, the complaints slowed.\n\n“They must have said, ‘We have to leave this crazy guy alone and see how far he gets,’” Sanchez said. “Nowadays, thank God, I have the support of the city. They support me, they congratulate me. I am what they call a ‘landmark’ here.”\n\nSanchez also has the support of the local arts community in Riverside. His work has been featured at the Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art and Culture, which is only a couple of blocks away from the restaurant.\n\nMaria Esther Fernandez, the museum’s artistic director, said Tio’s Tacos makes her feel at home and said the art uniquely reflects the city’s culture."
