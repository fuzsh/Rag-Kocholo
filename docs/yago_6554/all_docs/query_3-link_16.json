        "text": "... Manuel María González Ángel, a young entrepreneur who was only 23 years old when he decided to try his luck in the wine business in 1835.\n\nThis adventure didn’t only turn out to be the best idea of his life, but also the beginning of one of Spain’s most important entrepreneurial legacies.\n\nAs he ventured into a business that was completely unknown to him, he sought advice from his uncle, José María Ángel y Vargas – or, as he affectionately called him,\n\n“mi tío\n\nPepe”\n\nIt was this mentor who taught him all the secrets of the art of winemaking in Jerez. Out of gratitude, his nephew gave him part of the winery and a nod to the original casks, or butts, of the soleras aging process, with the name ‘Solera del Tío Pepe’.\n\nThe vision became a reality. Sherry wine from Jerez is beloved in every corner of the world. The success of exportation gave rise to a partnership with Robert Blake Byass, an English wine merchant and sales agent of Manuel Marías in Great Britain. In 1844, Manuel wrote a letter requesting some butts of the\n\n‘exceptionally pale wine that you recommend so highly’.\n\nThose first butts of Tío Pepe were very well received in the United Kingdom. Soon, they experienced exponential growth that gradually expanded to other countries in Europe and North America.\n\nA pioneer from the beginning, Manuel María González Ángel continued to cultivate his entrepreneurial spirit. As a result, in 1886 Tío Pepe became one of the first registered trademarks in Spain, and its winery was the first to feature electricity – two years before the city of Jerez adopted this technology.\n\nThe centenary celebrations inspired Luis Pérez Solero, the winery’s head of advertising, to humanise the bottle with its now unmistakable ensemble of a wide-brimmed hat, Andalusian jacket and guitar.\n\nAnd so one of the most iconic logos in the history of Spanish advertising was born.\n\nToday, Tío Pepe is one of the most prestigious and popular companies in Spain, and exports its products to 115 countries. The fifth generation of Manuel María González Ángel’s descendants continue to spread his passion for wine across the world, staying faithful to the same values of respect, sustainability and authenticity that defined the brand’s beginnings more than 180 years ago.\n\nOur story is written every day. And we want you to be part of it, because...\n\n...this is just the beginning!"
