Kids love it, of course. and it's one of the Catalan traditions this 25th of December.\r\n\r\n(For another interesting tradition, check out the \"caganer\"--or, \"shitter\"--you'll find in nearly every Catalan Nativity scene. There is symbolism and deeper meaning involved here, as well as the obvious humor--check the link. Kids love to spot the caganer (pronounced kah-gaw-NAY) hidden somewhere in each Nativity display they come across.)\r\n\r\nHope you have a Merry Christmas, Happy Festivus, or whatever it is you might celebrate.\r\n\r\n[NOTE: Those with some knowledge of Spanish/Castellano may be tempted to translate \"Tió\" as \"uncle\", but that is incorrect. Tió is a Catalan word meaning \"large branch\" or \"trunk\" or \"log\". Note the accent symbol is over the letter \"o\". Tío is the very different word you are thinking of in Spanish/Castellano which means \"uncle\".]",
