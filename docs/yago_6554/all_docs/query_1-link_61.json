        "text": "Hi there\n\nWhat (or who) is \"el tío\"? I know it can refer to just some guy (kinda like how we say \"dude\" in English, right?), but how does the article change it? Is there some sort of masculine archetypal figure normally associated with it?\n\nThanks!\n\nExactly. \"tío\" is uncle when referring to family ties, and it also means \"dude\" when using the word in colloquial, rather sub-standard context.\n\nThanks to both of you, but the meaning I'm looking for isn't \"uncle\"...but it might be to non-specific to define.\n\nHere is one example of the use I'm looking for: I visited a mine in Bolivia and inside, underground, they had this grotesque statue they called \"el tio\" to which the miners made offerings of coca leaves and alcohol..the statue represented something bigger, in this case a kind of guardian I guess...\n\nI've also seen it used when referring to an undefined masculine figure, like an archetype...\n\nI don't know if we have a word or term or a similar figure in English.\n\nThanks to both of you, but the meaning I'm looking for isn't \"uncle\"...but it might be to non-specific to define.\n\nHere is one example of the use I'm looking for: I visited a mine in Bolivia and inside, underground, they had this grotesque statue they called \"el tio\" to which the miners made offerings of coca leaves and alcohol..the statue represented something bigger, in this case a kind of guardian I guess...\n\nI've also seen it used when referring to an undefined masculine figure, like an archetype...\n\nI don't know if we have a word or term or a similar figure in English.\n\nInteresting input, and yet not too far from context. In both cases I referred to tío (uncle/dude), and most especially in the first one, calling someone \"tío\" doesn't only denote the family tie. At times, and depending on how you say the word, it also represents the speaker's recognition that the person he refers to, is someone he looks up to. I feel that is the very case of your input. Miners somewhat workship this figure and nametagged it \"el tío\", meaning to say it is someone they feel respect for.\n\nActually, pretty recently there was an incredibly fascinating documentary about Bolivian miners and I do remember the phrase from there. I think that particular use of tío may be confined to that particular mining culture. Uncle may be a form of address to an older male relative or ancestor. Growing up near a Native American community in Minnesota, I would hear younger people call older men in their community \"uncle\" and older women \"aunt.\" It's a term that has a sense of respect but also of familiarity so in that way is different than \"dude.\"\n\nYou could probably find tío/uncle in a lot of religious contexts--actually a priest at my parish talked about how we could view the saints in the Catholic tradition as our aunts and uncles.\n\nHi gladfly,\n\nI can't remember the details but I know for sure that el tío is often represented as el diablo - the devil - in this context. I don't think it is the devil as in christianity as such, but it relates to the dance \"la diablada\", which the Oruro carnival is famous for. I think the idea in the mines is that el tío knows the secrets of the mountain and has power over the fate of the miners, so they leave gifts in order to improve their luck.\n\nSorry I don't have the details but I reckon if you google something like potosí tío diablo you'll get some more info.\n\nHope this helps!"
