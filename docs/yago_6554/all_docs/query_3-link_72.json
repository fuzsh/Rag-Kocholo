        "text": "Flash forward to the present day, as the art of cinema is being systematically devalued, sidelined, demeaned, and reduced to its lowest common denominator, âcontent.â\n\nAs recently as fifteen years ago, the term âcontentâ was heard only when people were discussing the cinema on a serious level, and it was contrasted with and measured against âform.â Then, gradually, it was used more and more by the people who took over media companies, most of whom knew nothing about the history of the art form, or even cared enough to think that they should. âContentâ became a business term for all moving images: a David Lean movie, a cat video, a Super Bowl commercial, a superhero sequel, a series episode. It was linked, of course, not to the theatrical experience but to home viewing, on the streaming platforms that have come to overtake the moviegoing experience, just as Amazon overtook physical stores. On the one hand, this has been good for filmmakers, myself included. On the other hand, it has created a situation in which everything is presented to the viewer on a level playing field, which sounds democratic but isnât. If further viewing is âsuggestedâ by algorithms based on what youâve already seen, and the suggestions are based only on subject matter or genre, then what does that do to the art of cinema?\n\nCurating isnât undemocratic or âelitist,â a term that is now used so often that itâs become meaningless. Itâs an act of generosityâyouâre sharing what you love and what has inspired you. (The best streaming platforms, such as the Criterion Channel and MUBI and traditional outlets such as TCM, are based on curatingâtheyâre actually curated.) Algorithms, by definition, are based on calculations that treat the viewer as a consumer and nothing else.\n\nThe choices made by distributors such as Amos Vogel at Grove Press back in the Sixties were not just acts of generosity but, quite often, of bravery. Dan Talbot, who was an exhibitor and a programmer, started New Yorker Films in order to distribute a film he loved, Bertolucciâs Before the Revolutionânot exactly a safe bet. The pictures that came to these shores thanks to the efforts of these and other distributors and curators and exhibitors made for an extraordinary moment. The circumstances of that moment are gone forever, from the primacy of the theatrical experience to the shared excitement over the possibilities of cinema. Thatâs why I go back to those years so often. I feel lucky to have been young and alive and open to all of it as it was happening. The cinema has always been much more than content, and it always will be, and the years when those films were coming out from all over the world, talking to each other and redefining the art form on a weekly basis, are the proof.\n\nIn essence, these artists were constantly grappling with the question âWhat is cinema?â and then throwing it back for the next film to answer. No one was operating in a vacuum, and everybody seemed to be responding to and feeding off everybody else. Godard and Bertolucci and Antonioni and Bergman and Imamura and Ray and Cassavetes and Kubrick and Varda and Warhol were reinventing cinema with each new camera movement and each new cut, and more established filmmakers such as Welles and Bresson and Huston and Visconti were reenergized by the surge in creativity around them.\n\nAt the center of it all, there was one director whom everyone knew, one artist whose name was synonymous with cinema and what it could do. It was a name that instantly evoked a certain style, a certain attitude toward the world. In fact, it became an adjective. Letâs say you wanted to describe the surreal atmosphere at a dinner party, or a wedding, or a funeral, or a political convention, or for that matter, the madness of the entire planetâall you had to do was say the word âFelliniesqueâ and people knew exactly what you meant.\n\nIn the Sixties, Federico Fellini became more than a filmmaker. Like Chaplin and Picasso and the Beatles, he was much bigger than his own art. At a certain point, it was no longer a matter of this or that film but all the films combined as one grand gesture written across the galaxy. Going to see a Fellini film was like going to hear Callas sing or Olivier act or Nureyev dance. His films even started to incorporate his nameâFellini Satyricon, Felliniâs Casanova. The only comparable example in film was Hitchcock, but that was something else: a brand, a genre in and of itself. Fellini was the cinemaâs virtuoso.\n\nBy now, he has been gone for almost thirty years. The moment in time when his influence seemed to permeate all of culture is long past. Thatâs why Criterionâs box set, Essential Fellini, released last year to mark the centennial of his birth, is so welcome.\n\nFelliniâs absolute visual mastery began in 1963 with 8Â½, in which the camera hovers and floats and soars between inner and outer realities, tuned to the shifting moods and secret thoughts of Felliniâs alter ego, Guido, played by Marcello Mastroianni. I watch passages in that picture, which Iâve gone back to more times than I can count, and still find myself wondering: How did he do it? How is it that each movement and gesture and gust of wind seems to fall perfectly into place? How is it that it all feels uncanny and inevitable, as in a dream? How could every moment be so rich with inexplicable longing?\n\nSound played a big part in this mood. Fellini was as creative with sound as he was with images. Italian cinema has a long tradition of nonsync sound that began under Mussolini, who decreed that all films imported from other countries must be dubbed. In many Italian pictures, even some of the great ones, the sense of disembodied sound can be disorienting. Fellini knew how to use that disorientation as an expressive tool. The sounds and the images in his pictures play off and enhance one another in such a way that the entire cinematic experience moves like music, or like a great unfurling scroll. Nowadays, people are dazzled by the latest technological tools and what they can do. But lighter digital cameras and postproduction techniques such as digital stitching and morphing donât make the movie for you: itâs about the choices you make in the creation of the whole picture. For the greatest artists such as Fellini, no element is too smallâeverything counts. Iâm sure that he would have been thrilled by lightweight digital cameras, but they wouldnât have changed the rigor and the precision of his aesthetic choices.\n\nItâs important to remember that Fellini began in neorealism, which is interesting because in many ways he came to represent its polar opposite. He was actually one of the people who invented neorealism, in collaboration with his mentor Roberto Rossellini. That moment still astonishes me. It was the inspiration for so much in cinema, and I doubt that all the creativity and exploration of the Fifties and Sixties would have occurred without neorealism to build on. It was not so much a movement as a group of film artists responding to an unimaginable moment in the life of their nation. After twenty years of Fascism, after so much cruelty and terror and destruction, how did one carry onâas individuals and as a country? The films of Rossellini and De Sica and Visconti and Zavattini and Fellini and others, films in which aesthetics and morality and spirituality were so closely intertwined that they couldnât be separated, played a vital role in the redemption of Italy in the eyes of the world.\n\nFellini co-wrote Rome, Open City and PaisÃ (he also reportedly stepped in to direct a few scenes in the Florentine episode when Rossellini was ill), and he co-wrote and acted in Rosselliniâs The Miracle. His path as an artist obviously diverged from Rosselliniâs early on, but they maintained a great mutual love and respect. And Fellini once said something quite astute: that what people described as neorealism truly existed only in the films of Rossellini and nowhere else. Bicycle Thieves, UmbertoÂ D., and La Terra Trema aside, I think Fellini meant that Rossellini was the only one with such a deep and abiding trust in simplicity and humanity, the only one who worked to allow life itself to come as close as possible to telling its own story. Fellini, by contrast, was a stylist and a fabulist, a magician and a teller of tales, but the grounding in lived experience and in ethics he received from Rossellini was crucial to the spirit of his pictures.\n\nI came of age as Fellini was developing and blossoming as an artist, and so many of his pictures became precious to me. I saw La Strada, the story of a poor young woman sold to a traveling strongman, when I was about thirteen, and it hit me in a particular way. Here was a film that was set in postwar Italy but unfolded like a medieval ballad, or something even further back, an emanation from the ancient world. This could also be said of La Dolce Vita, I think, but that was a panorama, a pageant of modern life and spiritual disconnection. La Strada, released in 1954 (and in the United States two years later), was a smaller canvas, a fable grounded in the elemental: earth, sky, innocence, cruelty, affection, destruction.\n\nFor me, it had an added dimension. I watched it for the first time with my family on television, and the story rang true to my grandparents as a reflection of the hardships theyâd left behind in the old country. La Strada was not well received in Italy. To some it was a betrayal of neorealism (many Italian pictures at the time were judged by this standard), and I suppose that setting such a harsh story within the framework of a fable was just too odd for many Italian viewers. Around the rest of the world, it was a massive success, the film that really made Fellini. It was the picture for which Fellini seemed to have labored the longest and suffered the mostâhis shooting script was so detailed that it ran to six hundred pages, and near the end of the extremely difficult production he had a psychological breakdown and had to go through the first (I believe) of many psychoanalyses before he was able to finish shooting. It was also the film that, for the rest of his life, he held closest to his heart.\n\nNights of Cabiria, a series of fantastic episodes in the life of a Roman streetwalker (the inspiration for the Broadway musical and Bob Fosse film Sweet Charity), solidified his reputation. Like everyone else, I found it emotionally overpowering. But the next great revelation was La Dolce Vita. It was an unforgettable experience to see that film alongside a packed audience when it was brand-new. La Dolce Vita was distributed here in 1961 by Astor Pictures and presented as a special event at a legitimate Broadway theater, with reserved mail-order seating and high-priced ticketsâthe kind of presentation we associated with biblical epics such as Ben-Hur. We took our seats, the lights went down, we watched a majestic, terrifying cinematic fresco unfold on the screen, and we all experienced the shock of recognition. Here was an artist who had managed to express the anxiety of the nuclear age, the sense that nothing really mattered anymore because everything and everyone could be annihilated at any moment. We felt this shock, but we also felt the exhilaration of Felliniâs love for the art of cinemaâand, consequently, for life itself. Something similar was coming in rock and roll, in Dylanâs first electric albums and then in The White Album and Let It Bleedâthey were about anxiety and despair, but they were thrilling and transcendent experiences.\n\nWhen we presented the restoration of La Dolce Vita a decade ago in Rome, Bertolucci made a special point of attending. It was difficult for him to get around at that point because he was in a wheelchair and in constant pain, but he said he had to be there. And after the film, he confessed to me that La Dolce Vita was the reason he turned toward the cinema in the first place. I was genuinely surprised, because Iâd never heard him discuss it. But in the end, it wasnât so surprising. That picture was a galvanizing experience, like a shockwave that passed through the whole culture.\n\nThe two Fellini pictures that affected me the most, the ones that really marked me, were I Vitelloni and 8Â½. I Vitelloni because it captured something so real and so precious that related directly to my own experience. And 8Â½ because it redefined my idea of what cinema wasâwhat it could do and where it could take you.\n\nI Vitelloni, released in Italy in 1953 and three years later in the United States, was Felliniâs third film and his first truly great one. It was also one of his most personal. The story is a series of scenes from the lives of five friends in their twenties in Rimini, where Fellini grew up: Alberto, played by the great Alberto Sordi; Leopoldo, played by Leopoldo Trieste; Moraldo, Felliniâs alter ego, played by Franco Interlenghi; Riccardo, played by Felliniâs own brother; and Fausto, played by Franco Fabrizi. They spend their days shooting pool, chasing girls, and walking around making fun of people. They have grand dreams and schemes. They behave like children and their parents treat them accordingly. And life goes on.\n\nI felt like I knew these guys from my own life, my own neighborhood. I even recognized some of the same body language, the same sense of humor. In fact, at a certain point in my life, I was one of these guys. I understood what Moraldo was experiencing, his desperation to get out. Fellini captured it all so wellâimmaturity, vanity, boredom, sadness, the search for the next distraction, the next surge of euphoria. He gives us the warmth and the camaraderie and the jokes and the sadness and the desperation within, all at once. I Vitelloni is a painfully lyrical and bittersweet film, and it was a pivotal inspiration for Mean Streets. Itâs a great movie about a hometown. Anybodyâs hometown.\n\nAs for 8Â½: Everyone I knew back in those days who was trying to make movies had a turning point, a personal touchstone. Mine was, and still is, 8Â½.\n\nWhat do you do after youâve made a picture like La Dolce Vita that has taken the world by storm? Everybodyâs hanging on your every word, waiting to see what youâre going to do next. Thatâs what happened with Dylan in the mid-Sixties after Blonde on Blonde. For Fellini and for Dylan, the situation was the same: they had touched legions of people, everyone felt like they knew them, like they understood them, and, often, like they owned them. So, pressure. Pressure from the public, from the fans, from critics and enemies (and the fans and the enemies often feel like theyâre one and the same). Pressure to produce more. Pressure to go further. Pressure from yourself, on yourself.\n\nFor Dylan and Fellini, the answer was to venture inward. Dylan sought simplicity in the spiritual sense meant by Thomas Merton, and he found it after his motorcycle accident in Woodstock, where he recorded The Basement Tapes and wrote the songs for John Wesley Harding.\n\nFellini started with his own situation in the early Sixties, and made a film about his artistic breakdown. In so doing, he undertook a risky expedition into uncharted territory: his interior world. His alter ego, Guido, is a famous director suffering from the cinematic equivalent of writerâs block, and heâs looking for a refuge, for peace and for guidance, as an artist and as a human being. He goes for a âcureâ at a luxurious spa, where his mistress, his wife, his anxious producer, his prospective actors, his crew, and a motley procession of fans and hangers-on and fellow spa-goers quickly descend upon himâamong them is a critic, who proclaims that his new script âlacks a central conflict or philosophical premiseâ and amounts to âa series of gratuitous episodes.â The pressure intensifies, his childhood memories and longings and fantasies arrive unexpectedly through his days and his nights, and he waits for his museâwho comes and goes, fleetingly, in the form of Claudia Cardinaleâto âcreate order.â\n\n8Â½ is a tapestry woven from Felliniâs dreams. As in a dream, everything seems solid and well-defined on the one hand and floating and ephemeral on the other; the tone keeps shifting, sometimes violently. He actually created a visual stream of consciousness that keeps the viewer in a state of surprise and alertness, and a form that constantly redefines itself as it goes along. Youâre basically watching Fellini make the film before your eyes, because the creative process is the structure. Many filmmakers have tried to do something along these lines, but I donât think anyone else has ever achieved what Fellini did here. He had the audacity and the confidence to play with every creative tool, to stretch the plastic quality of the image to a point where everything seems to exist on some subconscious level. Even the most seemingly neutral frames, when you take a really close look, have some element in the lighting or the composition that throws you off, that is somehow infused with Guidoâs consciousness. After a while, you stop trying to figure out where you are, whether youâre in a dream or a flashback or just plain reality. You want to stay lost and wander with Fellini, surrendering to the authority of his style.\n\nThe picture reaches a peak in a scene where Guido meets the cardinal at the baths, a journey to the underworld in search of an oracle, and a return to the clay from which we all originate. As it is throughout the picture, the camera is in motionârestless, hypnotic, floating, always bearing toward something inevitable, something revelatory. As Guido makes his way down, we see from his point of view a succession of people approaching him, some advising him on how to ingratiate himself with the cardinal and some pleading for favors. He enters an anteroom filled with steam and makes his way to the cardinal, whose attendants hold a muslin shroud in front of him as he disrobesâwe see him only as a shadow. Guido tells the cardinal that heâs unhappy, and the cardinal responds, simply, unforgettably: âWhy should you be happy? That is not your task. Who told you that we come into the world in order to be happy?â Every shot in this scene, every piece of staging and choreography between camera and actors, is extraordinarily complex. I cannot imagine how difficult it all was to execute. Onscreen, it unfolds so gracefully that it looks like the easiest thing in the world. For me, the audience with the cardinal embodies a remarkable truth about 8Â½: Fellini made a film about film that could only exist as a film and nothing elseânot a piece of music, not a novel, not a poem, not a dance, only as a work of cinema.\n\nWhen 8Â½ was released people argued over it endlessly: the effect was that dramatic. We each had our own interpretation, and we would sit up till all hours talking about the filmâevery scene, every second. Of course we never settled on a definite interpretationâthe only way to explain a dream is with the logic of a dream. The film doesnât have a resolution, which bothered many people. Gore Vidal once told me that he said to Fellini, âFred, less dreams next time, you must tell a story.â But in 8Â½, the lack of resolution is only right, because the artistic process doesnât have a resolution eitherâyou have to just keep going. When youâre done, youâre compelled to do it again, just like Sisyphus. And, as Sisyphus discovered, pushing the boulder up the hill again and again becomes the purpose of your life.\n\nThe movie had an enormous effect on filmmakersâit inspired Paul Mazurskyâs Alex in Wonderland, in which Fellini appears as himself; Woody Allenâs Stardust Memories; and Fosseâs All That Jazz, not to mention the Broadway musical Nine. As I said, I canât count the number of times Iâve seen 8Â½, and I canât even begin to talk about the many ways that itâs affected me. Fellini showed all of us what it was to be an artist, the overpowering need to create art. 8Â½ is the purest expression of love for the cinema that I know of.\n\nFollowing up La Dolce Vita? Difficult. Following up 8Â½? I canât imagine. With Toby Dammit, a medium-length picture inspired by an Edgar Allan Poe story (itâs the last third of an omnibus film called Spirits of the Dead), Fellini took his hallucinatory imagery to a razor-sharp level. The film is a visceral descent into hell. In Fellini Satyricon, he created something unprecedented: a fresco of the ancient world that was âscience fiction in reverse,â as he called it. Amarcord, his semi-autobiographical film set in Rimini during the Fascist period, is now one of his most beloved pictures (itâs a favorite of Hou Hsiao-hsien, for example), though itâs far less daring than the earlier films. Still, itâs a work filled with extraordinary visions (I was fascinated by Italo Calvinoâs special admiration for the film as a portrait of life in Mussoliniâs Italy, something that didnât really occur to me). After Amarcord, every picture had shards of brilliance, especially Felliniâs Casanova. Itâs an ice-cold film, colder than the deepest circle of hell in Dante, and itâs a remarkable and daringly stylized but truly forbidding experience. It seemed like a turning point for Fellini. And in truth, the late Seventies and early Eighties seemed like a turning point for many filmmakers around the world, myself included. The sense of camaraderie that we had all felt, whether real or imagined, seemed to break apart, and everyone seemed to become her or his own island, fighting to make the next picture.\n\nI knew Federico, well enough to call him a friend. We met for the first time in 1970, when I went to Italy with a group of short films Iâd selected for a presentation in a film festival. I contacted Felliniâs office, and I was given about half an hour of his time. He was so warm, so cordial. I told him that on my first trip to Rome, Iâd saved him and the Sistine Chapel for the last day. He laughed. âYou see, Federico,â his assistant said, âyouâve become a boring monument!â I assured him that boring was the one thing heâd never be. I remember that I also asked him where I could find good lasagna, and he recommended a wonderful restaurantâFellini knew all the best restaurants everywhere.\n\nSeveral years later, I moved to Rome for a time and I began to see Fellini fairly often. We would run into each other and get together for a meal. He was always a showman, and the show never stopped. Watching him direct a movie was a remarkable experience. It was as if he were conducting a dozen orchestras at once. I took my parents to the set of City of Women, and he was running all over the place, cajoling, pleading, acting out, sculpting, and adjusting every element of the picture down to the last detail, realizing his vision in a swirl of nonstop motion. When we left, my father said, âI thought we were going to have our picture taken with Fellini.â I said, âYou did!â Everything had happened so fast that they didnât even know it had happened.\n\nIn the last years of his life, I tried to help him get his picture The Voice of the Moon distributed in the United States. Heâd had a difficult time with his producers on that projectâthey wanted a grand Fellini extravaganza and he gave them something much more meditative and somber. No distributor would touch it, and I was truly shocked that no one, including any of the key independent theaters in New York, even wanted to show it. The old films, yes, but not the new one, which turned out to be his last. A little later, I helped Fellini get some funding for a documentary project he had planned, a series of portraits of the people who made movies: the actor, the cinematographer, the producer, the location manager (I remember that in the outline for that episode, the narrator explained that the most important thing was to organize expeditions so that locations were near a great restaurant). Sadly, he died before he could get started on the project. I remember the last time I spoke to him on the phone. His voice sounded so faint, and I could tell that he was fading. It was sad to see that incredible life force ebb away.\n\nEverything has changedâthe cinema and the importance it holds in our culture. Of course, itâs hardly surprising that artists such as Godard, Bergman, Kubrick, and Fellini, who once reigned over our great art form like gods, would eventually recede into the shadows with the passing of time. But at this point, we canât take anything for granted. We canât depend on the movie business, such as it is, to take care of cinema. In the movie business, which is now the mass visual entertainment business, the emphasis is always on the word âbusiness,â and value is always determined by the amount of money to be made from any given propertyâin that sense, everything from Sunrise to La Strada to 2001 is now pretty much wrung dry and ready for the âArt Filmâ swim lane on a streaming platform. Those of us who know the cinema and its history have to share our love and our knowledge with as many people as possible. And we have to make it crystal clear to the current legal owners of these films that they amount to much, much more than mere property to be exploited and then locked away. They are among the greatest treasures of our culture, and they must be treated accordingly.\n\nI suppose we also have to refine our notions of what cinema is and what it isnât. Federico Fellini is a good place to start. You can say a lot of things about Felliniâs movies, but hereâs one thing that is incontestable: they are cinema. Felliniâs work goes a long way toward defining the art form."
