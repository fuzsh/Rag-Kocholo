In addition, some portions were drafted earlier with the support of a postdoctoral fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. My initial field research on merengue típico was supported by New York University’s MacCracken Fellowship, and hosted by the Centro León in Santiago, while field research on carnival was undertaken with the help of the Society for Ethnomusicology’s Nydia and Nicholas Nahumck Fellowship. I am grateful to each of these organizations for their confidence in my work. However, none of the research would have been possible without the many musicians, artists, and fans who helped me along the way. Most important in this regard is my accordion teacher Rafaelito Román, an outstanding musician and human being, and indeed his whole family, particularly his wife Carmen and his son Raúl. I am also grateful to Rita Indiana, Fefita la Grande, El Prodigio, Eddy Núñez, David David, Rafaelito Polanco, Radhamés Polanco, Belarminio Liriano, Luis Ureña, Ray “Chino” Díaz, and the many other musicians who took the time to talk and to teach me. Freddy Peña, José “Peligro” Mateo, Abelardo Martínez, and Américo Mejía also deserve special thanks for always being willing to talk típico with me. Thank you also to the visual artists Chiqui Mendoza and Raúl Recio for always being willing to answer my questions and for the permission to use their artwork, as well as to Shino Aguakate for graciously allowing me to reprint so many of his lyrics. I appreciate the feedback and assistance of numerous colleagues including Tes Slominski, Angelina Tallaj, Rossy Díaz, Lois Wilcken, Martha Ellen Davis, Paul Austerlitz, Darío Tejeda, and Marti Cuevas (owner of Mayimba Music); Rafael Emilio Yunén, Carlos Zapata, and all the staff\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nof the Centro León; and, most of all, Maurice Mengel, always my first and best reader. Thanks also to those who helped with transcriptions along the way—­Altagracia Pérez Almánzar, Adelajda Merchán-­Drazkowska, Victor Hernández Sang, and Anabelle Grullón—­as well as to my graduate assistant Gorda Stan, who assisted with various aspects of preparing this manuscript for publication. Finally, my dissertation advisor, Gage Averill, and committee members Peter Manuel, Ana María Ochoa, Martin Daughtry, and Suzanne Cusick offered important feedback on my early work that helped shape its later development, as the amazing editor Elizabeth Branch Dyson and two anonymous readers did for its more recent incarnations. To all these friends and colleagues go my eternal gratitude.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMaluca Mala, a Dominican American performer whose stage name roughly translates to Crazy Bad Girl, emerges from a salon into the daylight with her hair still in four-­inch rollers. She struts down the streets of Upper Manhattan in a rose-­print motorcycle jacket and red leather bustier over sequined hot pants, red-­fringed fishnets, and stiletto heels the color of her cherry-­red lipstick. An amped-­up bass outlining tonic and dominant chords in E minor joins electronic handclaps at 168 beats per minute as she rhythmically speaks a boast beginning “Lo tengo todo, Papi” (I’ve got it all, baby). Maluca begins to tell her story—­“I went to 182nd and Audubon just the other day”—­as she passes a series of men who are counting money, playing congas and maracas, talking on cell phones, or just watching her go by. Continuing “Papi, you keep blowing all that tiguerazo in the air . . . / Durango boots and all / Bacano walking tall,” Maluca ditches her heels in favor of a pair of rubber sandals and takes off on a bicycle. But she soon finds herself surrounded by a circle of these street-­corner men, each putting on a flirtatious look. With exaggerated eye rolls and expressions of disgust, she taunts them in Spanish: “No, no, I don’t have a phone number.” Maluca enters an apartment building and emerges again at night, her outfit changed but her hair still in rollers. As she visits a bodega to buy a cigarette, we see a montage of Dominican New York’s nighttime scenery: the corner store; a “Spanish” restaurant;1 men playing cards, dominos, or pool; a group of dancers at a club, one of them wearing those rubber sandals over socks. Maluca—­her hair now rolled around beer cans—­is performing with an all-­woman back-­up band on keyboards, bass, and accordion, saying, “A mí me gusta el tiguerazo porque tú tienes la calle unlocked” (I like the tiguerazo because you have the street unlocked). As she and her bandmates continue\n\n2\n\nChapter one\n\nchanting “el tíguere,” the audience looks on and dances, one man stroking an inflatable leopard.2\n\n* Maluca’s real name is Natalie Yépez. Her music reflects the experiences of many Dominican Yorks, island Dominicans’ sometimes admiring, sometimes disrespectful name for those who grew up abroad. Yépez calls her sound “experimental tropical punk, ghetto tech, and hip-­house” (MTV 2014), and indeed this song produced by the well-­known DJ Diplo3 sounds only distantly “Latin.” Auditory references to her latinidad (Latina/o identity) include the use of Dominican Spanish mixed with English, an occasional rustling sound like maracas or a güira scraper, the up-­tempo 2/4 beat recalling Dominican merengue, and the nearly constant presence of the claves, wooden sticks used to tap out Caribbean timelines. Here the rhythm they play (along with the electronic bass) is a 3 + 3 + 2, or tresillo (see Fig. 1.1), an Afro-­Caribbean rhythm found in everything from salsa—­where it forms the “3” side of the timeline known as son, or salsa clave—­to New Orleans jazz, Bo Diddley, Trinidadian soca, or the music of the Afro-­Dominican congos brotherhood. “El tigeraso” (sic; tiguerazo in Spanish orthography) was Maluca’s first single, released in 2009. As this example shows, the music refers on the one hand to a sort of global Afro-­Caribbeanness in its use of the widely dispersed tresillo, familiar far beyond the region through the travels of popular Caribbean sounds, as it reaches out to a broader audience through its electronic danceability. On the other hand, the lyrics and imagery are far more local in their references and meanings: they derive directly from New York Dominican life, even though women in many locations can empathize with the protagonist’s half-­amused, half-­exasperated dealings with the men around her. The song’s title refers to a specifically Dominican kind of masculine figure: the tíguere or street-­corner tiger, a principal figure in this book, which in the video is embodied in both the male flirts and the plastic leopard. The tíguere is known for (among other things) his amorous successes, at least according to his own estimation; his mastery of the urban environment; and his tricksterish ability to come out on top of any situation, whatever it takes. The -­azo is an augmentative suffix indicating that the song’s subject is the maximal tíguere, with a twist of irony. Indeed, the rest of the song lyrics, and especially\n\nF i g u r e 1 . 1 . Tresillo rhythm. Transcription by author.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nMaluca’s appearance and actions in the video, show that she is poking fun at Dominican gender stereotypes for both men and women: the men flirting ineptly and posturing as they try to appear to be suave bacanos (see Chapter 2), the women wearing curlers and flip-­flops all day long. Maluca’s exaggerated grimaces are a wink that lets us know she is taking none of this too seriously, and that she is the true master of this particular street. These clues show that Maluca’s performance of gender is a local one. Yet it has a broader resonance for non-­Dominican viewers, and these resonances suggest that the cases my book discusses have a significance beyond their Dominican home context. Her avant-­garde fashion and exaggerated bodily performances have been termed “drag queeny” and compared to Lady Gaga. Gaga is also known for experimenting with various forms of drag, including hyperfeminine performances as a form of “bio-­drag” (Davisson 2013, 55), but instead of Maluca drawing from Gaga, the influence may have traveled the other way: Maluca’s look appears to have inspired Gaga’s use of beer can rollers in her nine-­and-­a-­half-­minute 2010 video, “Telephone,” also featuring Beyoncé. Some Latino viewers slammed this as a white, “first-­world” appropriation of an unknown Latina’s creativity, though Maluca has refused to assign blame. Whatever the case, Maluca’s unusual performance of gender—­ hyperfeminine in appearance, but with an assertiveness more typically coded as masculine—­may draw on historical Caribbean models more than on contemporary Northern pop stars. One could easily draw parallels to the 1960s Cuban bolero and salsa diva La Lupe, particularly when viewing Maluca’s live performances, where she may lie down and writhe on stage as if taken over by the music—­much as La Lupe once did (see Chapters 4 and 7, this book; Maluca 2011a and 2011b). Yet there are precursors even closer to home. In response to a New York Times interviewer’s question about what was Dominican about her music, Maluca responded, “I think Dominicans don’t hold back. We’re very vocal, we’re loud, passionate and I think that comes out not only on stage, but also in my everyday life. I’m very honest and I say what I feel. We’re very feisty people” (Chang 2011). In claiming her feistiness, this Dominican American woman is not only creating a stage persona that can further her music career but also contesting gender stereotypes that circulate widely among the general public and even in academia—­those that present “normal” Latin American men as excessively “macho” and women, conversely, as subservient. More than that, she is claiming for herself a deeply rooted Dominican femininity that by its very existence demonstrates the limits of such a depiction: the tíguera,4 the assertive, sensual, and often surprising female tiger. The Dominicanness of Maluca’s music thus comes through clearly, but only to an audience already in the know: those who have hung\n\n4\n\nChapter one\n\nwith the tígueres, responded to their catcalls (or tiger calls), or been tígueres or tígueras themselves. My book’s title pays homage to these tigers, both male and female. This opening scene is a brief example of what I seek to demonstrate in this book. As a whole, Tigers of a Different Stripe is about how gender is performed through music: not only by playing on stage but also through dancing, listening, viewing, and discussing. While my findings should have relevance beyond the specific cases I describe, I limit my discussion to a particular cultural context, that of the Dominican Republic and its diasporic outposts in New York. I look at a variety of Dominican musical genres—­and beyond them to dance, music video, literature, and the visual arts—­relating these examples to forms of expressive and gendered culture elsewhere in the Caribbean and Latin America. My focus on gender also leads me to explore how that facet of identity is linked to musical genre, movement, migration, race, class, and notions of tradition and modernity. All these concepts are brought together by the principal musical style I discuss: merengue típico, a traditional, accordion-­based genre that has undergone great change since the 1960s as a result of the rapid urbanization and migration that occurred after dictator Rafael Trujillo’s assassination in 1961. This musical culture has constituted the main focus of my fieldwork for the past fourteen years. Merengue típico is close to the heart of many Dominicans, particularly those from the northern Cibao region. It is constantly linked to ideas about national and regional identity, and through them Dominican ideas about race, class, and gender also come to the fore. Even Maluca’s video refers to this musical genre, in spite of the fact that the sound of “El tigeraso” is quite distant from that of traditional merengue: one of the men on the street pulls on a child’s toy accordion near the beginning, and in the final scene, set in a nightclub, one of her backup musicians is depicted playing a button accordion. Although the accordion is never heard in this song, its silent presence in the video serves to remind knowledgeable viewers of merengue típico and all it stands for.5 I first became fascinated with merengue típico after hearing it performed live at the Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife in 2001, and soon thereafter I began regularly attending típico gigs all over Brooklyn, my home at the time. From the beginning, my intention was to learn to play this music on accordion as well, so I began visiting accordionists at their homes to pick up tunes; I also incorporated my new interest into my job as staff ethnomusicologist at Long Island Traditions, a nonprofit folklore organization, for instance, by organizing a merengue típico concert and workshop series. My project therefore began as a diasporic one, looking at merengue típico in New York, but soon expanded to include the music’s homeland, beginning\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nwith my first trip to Santiago de los Caballeros, the Cibao’s largest city, in 2004. There, I studied accordion under master musician Rafaelito Román; attended numerous live performances of típico and other musics; initiated research, education, and preservation projects with the Centro León, a museum and cultural center; and even conducted research on carnival while participating in the barrio masquerade group Los Confraternos de Pueblo Nuevo. While I no longer live in either of my field sites, I continue to be in touch with my fellow típico fans in New York City through email, Facebook, and the occasional visit, and with musicians, culture workers, and other friends in Santiago through visits, occasional telephone calls, and, in some cases, social media. As this personal history suggests, it was my interest in típico as a musical style that led me to research gender, rather than the other way around. As with many other researchers, my first attempts to analyze the topic of gender centered on a study of women in music. Contrary to my initial expectations, I found a number of other women playing típico soon after becoming involved in the music myself. Their presence and general acceptance in this scene surprised me because academic literature, media portrayals, and popular perceptions had led me to believe that Dominicans were quite machista—­sexist and patriarchal. While such a view was not wholly inaccurate, the general mismatch between mainstream perceptions and my experience in the típico world inspired me to investigate women musicians and their experiences further. My exploration of women’s roles in Dominican music eventually led me to look more broadly at how gender is performed in the Dominican Republic, since I realized I could not understand Dominican femininities, or consider the possibility of a Dominican feminism, without also grasping Dominican constructions of masculinity and other gender categories. On a more personal level, my research helped me to engage with questions I had long had about gender identity in general, and my own in particular. Why, for instance, did I detest all things pink from early childhood? Why had I performed mainly male roles in high school plays and insisted upon singing tenor in college, even though I had never doubted my own femininity or heterosexuality? Upon reflection, I realized that these had been gut reactions to societal expectations of women in the United States and meanings of the “feminine” with which I did not identify. I identified with many of the Dominican female musicians I met precisely because of how they performed critiques I felt to be similar to my own early efforts, principally through tigueraje or the domain of the tíguere (tiger), a key concept in this work that I explain further below. In this book, I aim to explore new ways of analyzing gender and music, dance and movement without engaging in academic wordplay. I do employ\n\n6\n\nChapter one\n\nsome social sciences terms whose meanings are explained in this introduction. I hope this approach to style makes my work accessible to a broader audience, including Dominican music fans and the musicians who appear in these pages. I also believe it better fits my topic: gender is an everyday fact of life that all of us have and perform, all the time; we should thus be able to analyze it using everyday language. Even more broadly, this approach fits with my most basic assumption in studying culture, which is that everything is connected: gender, genre, sexuality, race, nation, tradition, modernity, music, movement, ethnography, biography, research, and writing all feed off and influence one another in all of our lives. I hope to reveal a bit of that complexity in this book. Gender and Performance Gender is a topic that affects every person, all the time, everywhere: attached as it is to our bodies, it is fundamental to our identities and our interactions with society. One of the most basic assumptions on which this book is based is that gender is performed, not inborn. This viewpoint is frequently encountered in the social sciences today, but perhaps requires further explanation for an interdisciplinary audience. To say that gender is a performance means that the categories we use to describe this facet of an individual’s identity are created through the repetition of acts: behaviors, habits, words of proscription or approval. Another way of saying this is that we become “female” by imitating how “feminine” people walk, act, talk, sing, dance; as “women” we eventually learn to do what is considered “feminine” based on what we see other women doing and how others react to what we do. Fundamentally, gender is an exchange between the individual and society aimed at creating societal order. If we feel uncomfortable with what is required of us in this exchange, at the very least we run the risk of feeling ostracized; at worst we may become victims of violence. Far from being “natural,” or based on laws largely outside of human control, gender is cultural, created by people to regulate individuals’ places in society. This is true even though we attach gender categories like female and male to what we call “biological sex,” the particular anatomical features of a given person. Thus, this book is not simply about bodies performing music but also about their representation in music, as well as music’s contribution to and influence on a broader discourse about gender, the lives of particular musicians, and how fans deal with all of these things. This shift in perspective—­viewing gender as something that we learn to enact according to the demands of the culture into which we are born, rather\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nthan as something we are born with—­has been quite influential in the social sciences, including ethnomusicology, and is generally attributed to the work of philosopher Judith Butler, even though her work drew heavily on precursors like anthropologist Esther Newton. In her study of female impersonators, Newton found that drag’s theatricality was important for how it brought into question the “naturalness” of the entire system of gender and sex roles, thus showing that these were superficial and manipulable (see Rubin 2002, 48). Further focusing on the analysis of gender as performance, Butler proposed that what we think of as “female” does not automatically follow from the particularities of the bodies we describe as “female”: “I think for a woman to identify as a woman is a culturally enforced effect. I don’t think that it’s a given that on the basis of a given anatomy, an identification will follow. I think that ‘coherent identification’ has to be cultivated, policed, and enforced; and that the violation of that has to be punished, usually through shame” (in Kotz 1992, 88). The diversity of femininities (ways of being female) in history and other cultures is one piece of evidence suggesting the rather arbitrary relationship between anatomy, masculinities, and femininities. Butler even suggests that so-­called biological sex is itself cultural, because it does not exist apart from discourse about it: sex categories are ideals that few material bodies can live up to (Butler 1993, 1–­2). This view of gender is also connected to a feminist turn in the social sciences, upon which my work builds. Feminist thinkers from the global South, like Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (1987) and Gloria Anzaldúa (1987), criticized Northern feminists for presuming to speak for women everywhere and assuming that women in every culture were interested in following an agenda set mainly by white, heterosexual women from the global North. They showed that women’s experiences, even definitions of “women,” varied widely from place to place, so that trying to speak for women as a unitary group was presumptuous. Butler’s Gender Trouble was in part a reaction against the kind of feminist thought that presupposed “women” as a monolithic category and, in presupposing the global North as the originating source of feminism (and modernity) and hence of all progress in gender relations, unwittingly devalued the efforts of women in the global South (Butler [1990] 2006, 5) like those I describe here. Instead of examining feminism as a woman’s concern, in that book Butler pointed to the wider-­reaching problems created by defining gender as inborn and always binary, of presuming to decide, for instance, who is or is not a woman based on some criteria external to the subject being thus defined. In addition, if feminist theory is always centered only on “women,” it is already exclusionary and cannot represent everyone (not only men are excluded but so, for instance, are transgender or intersex\n\n8\n\nChapter one\n\npersons who identify as women or as female); for this reason, even trying to define “woman” as a category may actually be an “unwitting regulation and reification of gender relations” (7). How can those who do not identify with mainstream, binary gender categories make sense of themselves and become valued members of society in the system Butler, Newton, and others describe? Is feminism salvageable in the face of these problems? I believe it is, particularly if we accept the way forward offered by Butler: to understand and accept what she terms the performativity of gender. Performativity does not simply mean performance-­like but refers rather to the creative property of a speech or corporeal act—­the capacity of a performance, broadly understood, to bring something like gender into being through its repetition (see Butler [1990] 2006, xiv–­xv; 1993, 2). Accepting that gender is performed means accepting that gender does not exist on its own. Even the “interiority” of gender—­what one feels and experiences as one’s gender—­is created through “acts and gestures, articulated and enacted desires” rather than existing a priori ([1990] 2006, 185). We need some rules and norms to live together in a society, Butler says, but at the same time we need to distance ourselves from them or suspend them in order to consider and articulate other versions of those norms that enable minorities (including gender minorities) to have an identity and a voice in society (2004, 3). Music is one way of doing just that, as I will show, but it is one that Butler did not investigate. Instead, much as Newton had done earlier (though in different terms), Butler examined drag as a particularly important, potentially transformative kind of gender performance precisely because of how it reveals gender’s performativity. In Gender Trouble, she showed that drag was not simply copying an “original” gender, because there was no original to turn to; drag made clear that all genders were equally performed. In a later book, Undoing Gender, she further explained: “Through performativity, dominant and nondominant gender norms are equalized. But some of those performative accomplishments claim the place of nature or claim the place of symbolic necessity, and they do this only by occluding the ways in which they are performatively established” (2004, 209). In other words, drag shows that all genders are created equal, because they are all created in the same way—­ through performative acts. The fact that some genders, and usually only two of them—­the normative “male” and “female” ones—­are considered natural is fairly arbitrary, and they are only accepted as natural because of how they hide their origins. For example, as adults at least, we do not normally consider the way a seated woman crosses her legs at the knee to be a performance, much less one that actually creates what we construe as feminine. But\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nwhen a person with a “male” body sits in that feminine way, we see that that is just what it is. Butler’s views on gender, from which my own derive, clearly draw from performance studies. This field grew out of theater studies and anthropology, and it helps us to focus on process rather than product. In the words of Richard Schechner, one of the founders of performance studies, “whatever is being studied is regarded as practices, events, and behaviors, not as ‘objects’ or ‘things’” (2013, 2). My book fits with this perspective: it asks how Dominican musical performance contributes to the stability, variation, or transformation of Dominican gender identities in national and transnational contexts. Many of the performers I analyze in this book, particularly in Chapter 6, are engaged in processes of empowerment by reconstructing or reconfiguring meaning out of preexisting messages in performance. José Esteban Muñoz termed these processes “disidentifications” in his 1999 book of the same title, a study of queer Latino and Latin American performance artists of color. Disidentification, Muñoz says, is a way of rereading and reinterpreting pop culture in a political way precisely because one does not identify with its images or the relations they portray, even if those items are otherwise appealing. It is a “survival strategy that works within and outside the dominant public sphere simultaneously” (1999, 5).6 More specifically, disidentification is a process through which queer subjects engage in oppositional reading, breaking down dominant codes and transforming meanings. However, as I show, disidentification is not for queer subjects only: many Dominicans of all sorts disidentify with the Dominican national project, musically symbolized by mainstream (i.e., orquesta or popular) merengue, and that disidentification can result in adherence to other musical genres that better encapsulate nonmainstream gender, racial, or regional identities, including merengue típico, palos, Afro-­ Dominican fusions, and merengue de calle, to mention just a few (see Appendix A for descriptions of these genres, and Díaz 2013 for an example of how salsa fans build an alternative Dominican identity). I deal with cross-­dressing in just one chapter (Chapter 6), but both Butler’s and Muñoz’s ideas about drag nonetheless influence my analyses throughout the book. Muñoz too sees drag as a transformative performance, one that disidentifies with the “a priori relationship of woman and femininity that is a tenet of gender-­normative thinking” (Muñoz 1999, 108). In other words, drag shows how queer performers are unable or unwilling to identify with the usual binary gender categories and thus offers a critique of the “truths” of binary gender categories. Questioning these categories lays the foundations for a wider public to see the constructed nature of those supposed truths and possibly oppose them; in this way, drag performances can actually change the\n\n10\n\nChapter one\n\nworld (195–­96). While neither Butler nor Muñoz deal with music or dance specifically, I believe they would agree with the importance I assign to these expressions as spaces of imaginative play. For Muñoz, fiction is a “technology of the self ” in that it brings a self into being, blurring lines between the real and the fictional—­it is itself a “contested field of self-­production” (20). For Butler, fantasy allows us to move “beyond what is merely actual and present into a realm of possibility,” thus laying the groundwork for future change (2004, 28–­29). The potential of creative work to change our ideas about what is possible can actually place artistic performance at the forefront of cultural change.7 Feminist ethnomusicology also has a role to play here. For instance, I work to mainstream the analysis of women’s musicking by discussing it as an integral part of a system that also includes other genders. And particularly given the location of my study, I additionally aim to organize my work around local ways of thinking about gender and to value the critiques made locally as a kind of indigenous feminism, different from but just as valuable as mainstream, Northern, or academic feminisms. In fact, I believe ethnomusicology is ideally positioned to counteract some of the problems of feminist thought precisely because of its commitment to hearing and analyzing the voices of Others.8 My book both converges and diverges from prior scholarship in ethnomusicology and musicology, in which the lion’s share of research on gender has been written by and about women, often from a feminist perspective. While I too am a woman writing about gender and drawing from feminism, men are also a focus of this book, because my aim is to consider gender as a whole system. Feminist theory began to impact music studies in the 1980s, so that by 1990 gender was a topic of interest for many researchers, both ethnomusicologists and historical musicologists. In historical musicology, the work of Susan McClary (especially [1991] 2002), Suzanne Cusick (1999), and others have been broadly influential. In ethnomusicology, gender has appeared as the focus of several important edited collections (Koskoff 1987; Herndon and Ziegler 1990; Moisala and Diamond 2000; Magrini 2003), though mainly in the form of documenting women’s musical activities in various musical cultures. Only a few book-­length musical ethnographies have dealt with gender as a primary topic. The most influential is likely Jane Sugarman’s 1997 Engendering Song: Singing and Subjectivity at Prespa Albanian Weddings, which showed how differential singing styles helped not only to reinforce but actually to create Prespa notions of masculinity and femininity. Other ethnographies have followed the lead of the early edited collections and focused on women’s musical activities (e.g., Gilman 2011; Chuse 2013); monographs on music and masculinity are much rarer (a notable exception is Spiller 2010).\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nVery few ethnographies have considered gender more broadly as an identity, performance, or a meaningful system of cultural organization; it is still unusual to analyze gender in music relationally, placing the performances of those identified as male, female, or another gender side by side.9 Two exceptions are Sarah Weiss’s (2006) study of female and male ways of playing Indonesian gamelan music and Sylvia Nannyonga-­Tamusuza’s (2005) look at the array of varied gender identities performed in Ugandan music and dance. While it is now common to include a section or chapter dealing with gender in musical ethnographies, in-­depth studies that consider gender as a principal foundation for all music making (not just that of women) remain rare. Clearly, I also draw from performance studies in my analysis, and I hope that in doing so I can contribute a somewhat unique example of how we can understand gender to be built through music. While music might seem to be an obvious topic of study for performance theorists, and indeed musical research into performance long predates the birth of performance studies as a discipline, music researchers have typically viewed performance differently and studies of music that draw from performance theory have not been numerous; similarly, surprisingly little research on music has emerged from directly within performance studies. As Philip Auslander points out, in popular music studies cultural studies approaches have privileged audience reception over musicians’ performances, while performance studies scholars have tended to ignore musical performance (2006, 2). As for ethnomusicology, Alejandro Madrid (2009) writes, scholarship on performance typically “focused on the actions and practices surrounding music performance within specific cultural contexts. Ethnomusicology’s [study of] performance practice was clearly rooted in a different epistemological paradigm than musicology’s logocentric performance practice; it was an anthropological one. . . . Nevertheless, ethnomusicology’s study of performance still focused on music-­making actions and took them as sort of musical texts to be understood. . . . Both musicology and ethnomusicology’s early interest in performance stemmed from an attempt to understand sound, its production, organization, and meaning, within specific historical or cultural circumstances.” Taking a Schechnerian or Butlerian perspective of performance in ethnomusicology means analyzing performance not simply as a text that can be read but rather as an act or complex of actions intimately related to their cultural and historical contexts and with real effects in the world. By extension, taking a performative view of gender in ethnomusicology means analyzing how musical performance actually brings cultural norms and notions of gender—­really, gender itself—­into being. The performances I analyze in this book—­the movements, gestures, and musical sounds Dominican artists\n\n12\n\nChapter one\n\nproduce at particular moments and in particular places—­are creative not just in the sense that they are artistic but also in the sense that they bring particular identities into being. They therefore have the potential to change those identities that are currently dominant. Given the critiques of Crenshaw, Anzaldúa, Spivak, and others, it is nevertheless impossible to look at gender alone. I will therefore also take race, class, and postcolonial relationships into account in this book. Not to do so would present analytical and political risks; for instance, a gender-­only study might suggest that masculinities and femininities are everywhere alike. Even in a single context, like that of the Dominican Republic, such is clearly not the case; expectations for masculine and feminine comportment differ greatly according to one’s class or racial position in society, while ideas about gender, feminism, and gay rights are strongly colored by the neocolonial relationship between the Dominican Republic and the United States. I try to keep such intersections at the forefront of my analyses throughout this book. As Ellen Koskoff explained in a recent interview, isolating gender as a topic of study is useful for gaining depth, but focusing on it carries the risk of erasing the fact that in everyday life it is “mixed up” with many other markers of identity, like age, race, religion, and much more (Kyker 2014). While this study is specific to one country, the insights I hope it will yield should be applicable to other places with related histories. The study of the intersections between musical performance, gender, and race is particularly pertinent in the Black Atlantic, Paul Gilroy’s widely used term for the transnational cultural region formed as a result of the Atlantic slave trade. Gilroy himself pointed the way to the need for more research on performance, explaining that its focus on “the pivotal ethical relationship between performer and crowd, participant and community” and the “oral character” of many African diasporic societies make performance central to Black Atlantic cultures (Gilroy 1993, 203) like that of the Dominican Republic. He sees the process of performance rather than its content as primary in the Black Atlantic (Gilroy 1993, 200) and therefore suggests turning away from a focus on textuality and narrative and toward “dramaturgy, enunciation, and gesture—­ the pre-­and anti-­discursive constituents of black metacommunication” (75). Gilroy thus seems to concur with Butler, Schechner, and others that we need more research on the “hows” of performance—­the specific corporeal acts that create both culture-­specific notions of gender and Black Atlantic sociality more generally. Among these acts, I include singing and the playing of musical instruments alongside dance and other bodily movements. While neither Butler nor Gilroy analyzed music or movement in detail,10 I have tried to take them up on the challenge in this book as well as to go beyond what they\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nsuggested by using an interdisciplinary set of tools: participant observation, ethnographic interviews, musical analysis, movement and gesture analysis, and textual and video analyses. With these tools, I want to describe not only how gender interacts with music and is performed through the body but also to explain how musical performances of gender (or gendered performances of music) interact with ideas about race, nation, transnationalism, tradition, and modernity in the Caribbean. Tradition, Transnationalism, and Tigueraje in Típico The case on which I focus here, that of merengue típico, is typically Latin American or Caribbean in the way it blends the traditional and the modern, the global and the local, manifesting what García Canclini (2005) terms hybridity, but it is also representative of what has happened to many traditional musics worldwide. Ethnomusicologists—­many of them working in Latin America and/or the Caribbean—­have changed our perspectives on the relationship between music and place through studies of transnational populations’ use of music in establishing identities or maintaining links (e.g., Averill 1994, Austerlitz 1997, Simonett 2001) and the transnational flows of music through media (Garofalo 1993, García 2006). While traditional musics were typically thought of as rooted in a single place, community, or region, this is no longer the case for many or most musics classified as such today. Transnational traditions like típico are more the rule than the exception. In spite of the fact that these styles are now transmitted, consumed, even learned through mass media like recordings, videos, television, radio, and the Internet, those who make típico and other transnational traditional musics still consider themselves part of a tradition, and the idea of tradition and rootedness is a large part of what makes these musics relevant for their practitioners and listeners—­even when they are also drawing from internationally popular styles like hip-­hop, salsa, R & B, or reggaetón. Such a concept of tradition seems to be problematic only for academics who wish to maintain the opposition between categories of “traditional” or “folk” and “popular” music; those who love the music have no such compunctions. In addition, as I have noted elsewhere (Hutchinson 2012c), the Spanish term música popular simply means “music of the people” and thus already includes both folkloric and mass-­mediated genres. Canclinian hybridity is thus a useful way to think about the relationship between traditional music and modernity in Latin America, but this concept has relevance for my broader topic—­gender—­as well. Writing about Middle Eastern women, anthropologist Lila Abu-­Lughod explains that the very idea\n\n14\n\nChapter one\n\nof modernity has been produced in the West, always through contrast with a “primitive” or “traditional” other, and indeed is based on a foundation of slavery and colonialism; thus, when Western modernity is imposed on non-­ Western cultures, it may bring women both emancipation and new forms of domination (1998, 7–­8). Butler finds that feminists like Abu-­Lughod who write from outside of white Northern feminism have shown that Westerners “do not know our own modernity, the conditions of its own emergence and preservation. . . . Or rather, we are showing that what we call ‘modernity’ is a form of forgetfulness and cultural erasure” that positions white Northerners at the center, or even as the only ones making progress (Butler 2004, 230–­31). “Modernity” is itself a product of the unequal relations between North and South and the histories of colonialism, slavery, and other ways the supposedly modern nations exploited those considered traditional or backward (and this occurred not only between nation-­states but also within them, where indigenous people or other minorities often played the “backward” role). In looking at the insubordinate or progressive actions of Dominican women like Maluca, I want to contribute to a feminism that values such women and their actions. In considering how traditional music aids in such acts, I also want to disrupt the value-­laden polarity between traditional and modern as well as an equally contested correlate, the First World–­Third World binary. For these reasons, típico’s hybrid status as both traditional/local and modern/transnational is a significant factor in how gender is thought about and performed in this scene and in the Dominican Republic more broadly. In Chapter 2, I introduce an array of terms used to discuss gender performance in the broader Dominican Republic. The one most central to this book and pertinent to the current discussion is that of tigueraje. Tigueraje is the realm or behavior of the tíguere or tíguera, the tiger or tigress, the tough, streetwise, sensual gender identity with something of the trickster thrown in, which Maluca so masterfully performed at the opening of this chapter. If placed in a binary similar to those just mentioned, a tíguere would form the opposite to the hombre serio or hombre manso, the serious or tame man, and likewise the female tíguera and the mujer seria (serious woman) are seen as opposing roles, although I intend to complicate these binaries. As I show in later chapters, particularly 5 and 6, these masculinities and femininities correspond to differing Dominican ideas about tradition and modernity, particularly with respect to musical style, and they are easily discerned by Dominican viewers and listeners.11 Since the 1960s, tigueraje has come to dominate all forms of Dominican popular music as a model of both male and female behavior, a change that I argue relates to the country’s simultaneously transforming economic and social landscapes and to key performers\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nthat emerged during the tumultuous post-­Trujillo years. In Chapters 2 and 4, I analyze feminine tigueraje, a forceful, even aggressive role that somewhat resembles what Judith Halberstam (1998) has described as “female masculinities,” or constructions of maleness that can also be performed by women. While the tigueraje I examine is performed mainly by heterosexual Dominican women, unlike the queer subjects of Halberstam’s study, it nonetheless similarly affords “a glimpse of how masculinity is constructed as masculinity” (Halberstam 1998, 1). In more recent times, as I show in Chapters 6 and 7, the spectrum of gender performance in the Dominican Republic has expanded even further so that nonnormative masculinities and femininities can also be seen on the popular music stage. The expansion in gender possibilities has occurred together with (though not, I think, because of) an increasing acceptance of and even promotion of Dominican music’s historic roots in and contemporary ties to the broader Black Atlantic. Intriguingly, much of the impetus for this growing inclusivity seems to have come from traditional musics—­via both traditional musicians and those “schooled” musicians who have become involved with them. Genre in Dominican Music In my view, “genre” in music entails not only features of a style’s musical sound—­like instrumental and vocal timbres, rhythms, melodies, forms, and structures—­but also particular social meanings, like class, ethnic, or racial connotations, places of performance, and especially gender performances. In other words, I believe that most if not all musical genres encode and enact specific ways of performing gender that make sense according to the values of their particular musical scene or music world. This view actually dovetails with the terms’ etymologies: both gender and genre derive from the Latin genus, meaning birth, family, nation, or a type or class (for example, of a noun), and indeed just one term still contains both senses in Romance languages like Spanish, where both are termed género. In introducing my topic, then, I will need to describe musical genres as well as the types of gender performance each brings to life. At its most basic level, merengue típico is defined by its instruments and principal rhythms, as well as by contrast to related styles like orquesta or big-­ band merengue (see Appendix A). The two-­headed tambora drum, the metal güira scraper, and the diatonic button accordion12 are required components, and no típico group is without this basic trio. More specifically, the tambora in merengue típico is larger and heavier than those used in merengue de orquesta, and the güira is likewise wider. Típico musicians vastly prefer\n\n16\n\nChapter one\n\nhandmade instruments to factory-­produced ones, so the típico tambora is made of a single hollowed-­out log when possible (less often from barrel staves), its skins stretched around rims of bent wood and tied with rope, rather than fastened and tightened with metal fittings. The sound-­producing bumps in the metal of the güira are also punched by hand, and típico musicians disdain those that are rolled by machine. The preferred accordion is the two-­row Hohner Erica, although some play the two-­row Weltmeister Mayimba; occasionally, very old one-­row models are trotted out by elderly or rural musicians. Before the 1960s, a saxophone and/or a bass lamellaphone called marimba were occasionally added to the group; in recent decades, congas, timbales, keyboards, and even guitars have become optional additions, while electric basses and saxophones are found in most groups. In traditional típico, two principal rhythms were used,13 defined by two-­bar patterns on the tambora: merengue derecho (straight-­ahead merengue, often with a two-­ part form) and pambiche, a more syncopated groove (typically in a one-­part song). These rhythms still lie at the core of the repertoire, but new ones have also been added (these are discussed further in Chapter 5). Place is also central to típico: the music is a symbol for the northern Cibao region as well as its traditional agricultural economy and stratified class system. While it is still played informally (then usually in a trio, often termed perico ripiao) in villages throughout the region, Santiago de los Caballeros has been its center of production since the 1960s. The second-­largest city in the country and largest in the Cibao region, Santiago has a remarkable live music scene dominated by típico but including many other sounds as well. In spite of típico being firmly rooted in urban settings, most típico musicians are nonetheless proud of their ties to the rural Cibao and emphasize these ties even in urban contexts. On another level, típico can be defined by its social relations. Outsiders tend to see it as the music of peasants, urban lower classes, or return migrants, all groups with a low status. For insiders, however, it can be associated with upward mobility, as its consumers adapt to urban living and work situations, reacclimate themselves to Dominican life after amassing financial resources abroad, or use musical patronage to demonstrate economic success. In fact, even though típico is disseminated via mass media like regional radio and television and the Internet, traditional patronage relationships still play an important role: businessmen commission homenajes or praise songs, or they use típico as an investment strategy by managing young musicians at the start of their careers. This mixed economy is another manifestation of típico’s Canclinian hybridity, and it can also be observed in the places típico is played, which range from rural cockfight rings to urban bars and nightclubs, passing\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nthrough the roadhouses (paradas) and ranchos (discos built as large, open-­air, thatch-­roofed shelters) located on Santiago’s periphery. In gendered terms, fans sometimes describe the styles and rhythms of merengue típico as either masculine or feminine. The newer merengue con mambo is perceived as a more feminine style than the older merengue derecho or straight-­ahead merengue, a repertoire also referred to as “merengues de hombre” (men’s merengues; D. Polanco 2006). Some tie this change to playing technique (F. Pascual 2004) and others to the increased participation of female fans (Guzmán 2006). More broadly, some also see the whole repertoire of típico as dividing into the masculine merengue and the feminine pambiche (e.g., Américo Mejía in X. Pérez 2010), each distinguished by tambora rhythm, the former march-­like, the latter syncopated. We can therefore view traditionalists’ vehement condemnation of rhythmic changes as a camouflaged denunciation of changes in traditional society, including its gender roles. While modern típico’s great popularity would seem to show a greater acceptance for such changes, the possibly reactionary emphasis on hypermasculinity in some performances (discussed in Chapter 5) must be viewed critically. Merengue típico shares space with a variety of other Dominican musics, including palos, bachata, merengue de calle, and merengue de orquesta (see Appendix A), and no one listens to only one genre of music, but típico has marked out its territory in particular ways. The word típico here refers not to what is ordinary but to what is typical of a place. Thus, it is more tied to a particular space than any of the other styles I discuss here. Furthermore, típico aficionados conceive of their musical environment and relations as a “world”—­el mundo típico—­rather than a scene, as scholars might describe it (see Hutchinson 2016), and this resonates with concepts of world-­making used in queer studies. Queer theorists Lauren Berlant and Michael Warner’s 1998 article “Sex in Public” argued that just as queer subjects reinscribe public spaces with their own meanings, often hidden from heterosexual outsiders, queer culture can and should engage in the political activity of establishing nonheteronormative spaces in the broader public sphere. Their own use of the term world-­making was based on ideas from the philosophers Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger. Elsewhere Warner has explained that they understood Arendt’s concept of world-­making to refer to how “the activity we undertake with each other . . . brings into being the space of our world, which is then the background against which we understand ourselves and our belonging. . . . The world made in public action is not an intended or designed world, but one disclosed in practice. It is a background for self-­understanding, and therefore something not purely individual. It is also immanent to history and\n\n18\n\nChapter one\n\npractice, unlike ideas of community or identity, which tend to be naturalized as stable or originary. And it is a language of performativity that is necessarily contextual and multi-­perspectival” (Jagose 2000). Taking insider discourse seriously and considering merengue típico as a “world” thus helps us to see how its practitioners and listeners together create not only particular musical sounds, dance movements, social spaces, and interactions but also gender and other facets of Cibaeño and Dominican identities. It forces us to consider típico’s contexts, the multiple perspectives of those inside and outside of it, and the ways performance brings it and its associated identities into being. Típico musicians and listeners are engaged in a process of world-­making, and while they do not normally see their activities as political, scholars can view them as such, since at one level típico music and sociality are aimed at validating the experiences of those Cibaeños whose voices might not normally be valued by those in power: those who live abroad, those who have returned, peasants, tígueres, and tígueras. In fact, we can easily view each musical genre as a world-­making project of its own, and, as I will show later in this book, each genre world emphasizes particular gender performances. In each case, gender and genre mutually define and create each other. Gender in the Caribbean Merengue típico iterates gender performances found in other genres, but it is also unique in the Caribbean for being perhaps the only genre in which women have been more prominent as instrumentalists and bandleaders than as vocalists or dancers. The reasons for their relative success in this apparently “macho” music are multiple, but at the very least they suggest that perspectives on Caribbean gender construction that emphasize machismo as part of a binary whose counterpart is female subservience present a one-­sided view of the subject that does not represent the social reality of all Caribbean women. When factors such as class, race, and musical-­performance traditions are figured in, the picture becomes considerably more complex, since some women, particularly in the lower classes, can and do draw on a number of empowering traditions. Caribbean gender studies have been predicated on notions of gender as a binary, either-­or construct that corresponds to binary divisions found elsewhere in society. In the 1950s, anthropologists like Sidney Mintz, Robert Manners, and Raymond Scheele, all students of Robert Redfield, saw lower-­class life in the Caribbean—­specifically Puerto Rico—­as being organized around a divide between the masculine realm of the calle, street, and\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nthe feminine one of the casa, house or home (see e.g., Steward et al. 1956). Other studies of Caribbean gender from this time, such as studies by Mexican researcher María Elena Bermúdez (1955) and American sociologist J. Mayone Stycos (1958), established “machismo” as the principal term for describing Latin American men’s behaviors and attitudes, and by the 1970s the term was widely used in feminist critiques as well as in popular discourse, even in English. Scholars viewed machismo primarily through a psychological lens, seeing it as pathological and thus almost entirely negative (Ramírez [1993] 1999, 8–­11). In 1969, Peter Wilson added to the casa-­calle model by positing that men were focused on acquiring reputation in the street, women on maintaining respectability in the home. In 1973, political scientist Evelyn Stevens created another binary by arguing that machismo always had a feminine counterpart in marianismo, where women gained respect through embodying the virginal and motherly aspects of the Virgin Mary. Next, Jamaican educator Errol Miller (1986) effectively transferred the calle/reputation model to the Anglophone Caribbean by advancing the so-­called male marginalization thesis in the 1980s. Echoing earlier views of Caribbean families as matrifocal organizations in which men were irresponsible, marginal, or tangential members, he argued that Caribbean men’s declining educational performance was a result of, first, colonial policies that favored steering black men toward manual labor and, later on, policies that created opportunities for women’s advancement in education and other areas, thus laying the blame (in part) at the doorstep of high-­achieving women. These theories of Caribbean gender continue to influence researchers, writers, and policymakers, even as new directions for gender research have emerged, particularly those focusing on the intersections of gender with nationalism, ethnicity, or race, or on homosexuality and homophobia. My research has convinced me that neither reputation nor respectability is a concern of any gender exclusively; instead, different masculinities and femininities may emphasize one over the other or even seek to balance the two. It follows that “machismo” is only one way of viewing masculinity in Latin America, and, in fact, Ramírez ([1993] 1999) sees machismo as a social-­sciences construct based on anecdotal evidence at best and imposed externally. He found that the term was never used among lower-­class Puerto Ricans, even though they did discuss being macho, male (3–­4). In the Dominican Republic the term machista is similarly employed mainly as a feminist critique of male behavior, rather than as a way of analyzing or discussing masculinity (maleness seems to remain the unmarked category). And not only is it impossible for me to imagine the women I know in the Dominican\n\n20\n\nChapter one\n\nRepublic being described as subservient, but also it is difficult to view Dominican femininity within the framework of marianismo. Gender complexity, a term that has recently gained popular currency to describe the spectrum of gender identities that exist beyond conventional male and female ones, is also useful for scholars and activists who wish to look beyond binary views of gender.14 This concept is pertinent to my current project particularly because, at the beginning of my research period, a surprising development in the performance of gender was underway in Dominican music, as a number of male singers began to appear in drag or other atypically masculine attire on stage. Later, several men and women who were either gay or not clearly heterosexual gained popularity in a variety of Dominican musical genres. I believe that the two developments were related, and that both in turn built on the foundation of tigueraje laid by earlier merengueros. While some of these performances resemble camp, a subversive, exaggerated, or shockingly excessive performance aesthetic associated with effeminate homosexuals and famously analyzed by Susan Sontag (1964), others do not fit this type, perhaps due to camp aesthetic’s roots in the North. As Muñoz explains, campy performances (including drag) use humor for cultural critique in a disarming way, but because camp is mainly the province of gay white men, Latinos have developed other kinds of disidentifying performance (1999, 121). One of these is choteo, a kind of mocking, joking talk widespread in the Caribbean that undermines authority and causes confusion.15 While the term “choteo” is not used in the Dominican Republic, its ethos is quite close to that of tigueraje in its tricksterish forms of critique. One can therefore see the musicians I describe in Chapters 6 and 7 as reforming—­or perhaps “queering,” to echo two well-­known books on queer musicology (Brett, Wood, and Thomas 1994; Whiteley and Rycenga 2006)—­the formerly heteronormative tigueraje through their critical, sometimes humorous, and frequently exaggerated acts. These musicians’ performances seem to owe much to earlier ones by the female accordionist Fefita la Grande (Chapter 4), which might themselves be considered campy. In reformulating tigueraje, these artists not only work to make the Dominican public sphere more inclusive of a wider array of gender identities, but they also force us as scholars to move beyond binary models of Caribbean gender. Music and Movement I write this book from the perspective of an ethnomusicologist, and my primary focus is gender. However, to study gender in and as musical performance, I draw from an interdisciplinary toolbox and hope to contribute to\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nan interdisciplinary tradition of research not only on these two topics but also on the interrelated topics of body, movement, and gesture, as well as feminist theory. These topics have received sustained but uneven treatment in my home field. In the latter half of this book, bodily movement in music becomes an important facet of my analyses. I have been inspired by many excellent works in dance studies that consider the relationships between movement and gender (e.g., Cowan 1990; Novack 1990; Browning 1995), nation (Doi 2001), race (Browning 1995; DeFrantz 2006), class (Ness 1992), colonialism (Savigliano 1995), gesture (Noland and Ness 2008), and many others. I am also encouraged by the fact that ethnomusicological attention to body and movement has grown in recent years, leading to a number of monographs on dance, movement, or gesture by ethnomusicologists (e.g., Hutchinson 2007; Hahn 2007; Spiller 2010; Hellier-­Tinoco 2011; Clayton, Dueck, Leante 2013; Rahaim 2013; Bosse 2015) as well as numerous publications on gesture by musicologists (e.g., Gritten and King 2006; Godoy and Leman 2010; Le Guin 2006; Hatten 2004; Rahaim 2013). Given this body of work and recent developments in scholarship on music and the body, I hope to unite several recent trends in musical research by attending to the interrelationship of musical sound with gender, gesture, and aestheticized bodily movement (including but not limited to dance). I take up the challenges posed by Judith Butler, Paul Gilroy, Martin Clayton, and other scholars by investigating how musical sound connects to a particular society and its belief system—­particularly as regards gender—­through the body. And in linking ethnographic research with movement, gesture, and video analysis, I hope to present music, movement, and gesture in a holistic manner rather than separating performance into musical and movement components according to traditional disciplinary divisions. Since gender is located in (i.e., performed by and read from) the body, I believe that movement and gesture analysis provide an excellent way of studying it; music’s important role in identity formation and group cohesion make it equally fundamental. By considering sound and movement together, I aim to probe further the embodied dimensions of music and gender. A Guide to This Book I came to this music first as a fan and aspiring musician, attracted above all by típico’s musical complexity: its virtuosic accordion technique, extreme speeds, tricky rhythms, and fascinating intraensemble interactions. I was involved with the music for a year and a half before I considered myself really\n\n22\n\nChapter one\n\nto be researching it. Before that, I simply attended numerous gigs without taking notes or making recordings. This early involvement meant that I became friends with many musicians and their families before I began to “study” them, and this turned out to be advantageous, in that it was easy for me to make connections with típico musicians and fans in Santiago before I ever got there. Since that time, my principal mode of research has been ethnographic fieldwork. My fieldwork consisted of observing típico events and típico in daily life in two cities, participating in such events as a dancer and accordionist, and interviewing numerous participants in the típico world, from performers to managers to fans. I also undertook a side project on Santiago carnival by participating for four years in a group of lechones, Santiago’s traditional masked figure. While that work is tangential to this book’s topic, the experience nonetheless further informs my understanding of Dominican gendered culture, particularly because I was dressing as a typically masculine carnival character, the lechón. Aside from fieldwork, I have also done library and archival research into both merengue típico and Dominican gender construction. Sources for the former included documents in the collections of the Centro León and the Archivo Histórico de Santiago, and for the latter, the books, articles, and theses I have cited throughout. Many of my interlocutors were interested in my project because they realized that merengue típico was devalued in the Dominican Republic, and they believed my attention would help rectify the situation. My transcriptions in particular seemed important to them because of widespread beliefs that (a) merengue típico simply could not be written, and that (b) written music was more valuable. Their views on the value of written music provide justification for my inclusion of transcriptions in this book. In part, my collaborators were right in their assessment of potential benefits: since I began my research and presented my findings (and transcriptions) at local conferences, merengue típico has begun to gain ground, with some of its musicians invited to perform in prestigious locations that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Such invitations build upon and interact with the concurrent work of respected Dominican típico aficionados like Rafael Chaljub Mejía, Huchi Lora, and Américo Mejía, who also advocate for the style and deserve greater credit than I do for that growing prestige. Given my research methods, parts of this book fit the classic musical ethnography mold, but my work also differs in its use of a wider array of interdisciplinary tools. Besides ethnographic description and the analysis of musical sound and lyrics, I engage in the analysis of visual art (in Chapters 3 and 4), film and video (Chapters 4 and 7), literature (mainly Chapter 7), and\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nmovement (Chapters 4 through 7). My movement analyses were conducted by engaging in close readings of filmed performances, correlating movement and gesture with lyrics, musical sounds, and fans’ feedback. I mainly used recordings that are easily accessible on video-­sharing sites like YouTube, so readers can also view my source materials, and indeed should do so as they read this text (further information and links can be found on this book’s companion website). I should note, however, that fan-­created videos of the songs I discuss also circulate on video-­sharing sites, and their content can differ sharply from those created by the artists themselves. In its structure, this book proceeds in a roughly chronological fashion, from the historical perspective of Chapter 2, through a focus on the 1960s and 1970s period in Chapters 3 and 4, to the more contemporary topics of the final three chapters. Chapter 2 outlines a range of masculinities and femininities in the Dominican Republic, demonstrating the historical rootedness of local concepts about gender and providing modern-­day examples from music and politics to illustrate their continued relevance. Here I also link changes in Dominican masculinities with social and economic transformations related to transnational migration and neoliberalism, and I argue that Dominican femininities can offer both conceptual challenges to and inspiration for feminists in the world at large. Chapters 3 and 4 form a pair looking at two key performers of merengue típico, one male and one female, both associated with the transformations their musical genre underwent following the assassination of dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1961. These musical transformations occurred simultaneously with, and arose principally because of, the massive urbanization and migration that followed the change in political power; these two performers therefore embody these musical-­social changes and express them in part through their related performances of tigueraje. In Chapter 3, I demonstrate how Tatico Henríquez’s performance of tigueraje at a particular time and place—­Santiago during its tumultuous years of urbanization in the period mentioned—­made him so culturally charismatic that he became a legendary figure in the years since his death. In so doing, I also offer a new model for analyzing charismatic performers in traditional contexts and beyond. In Chapter 4, I position Fefita la Grande as a model of charismatic Caribbean feminism for her daring vocal, instrumental, and bodily performances, while also problematizing the reception of those performances in her home context. Chapter 5 unites the currents of the previous two chapters, discussing the positions and performances of both women and men within the “new” substyle of merengue típico moderno or merengue con mambo. Simultaneously viewed as “feminized” (often but not only by its detractors) and performed\n\n24\n\nChapter one\n\nas hypermasculine, this style is centered on the danceable mambo section as well as a form of transnational tigueraje, a border-­crossing youth culture, which builds contemporary Black Atlantic connections even as it draws on historical resonances with other Afro-­ Caribbean and African American musics and masculinities. In Chapter 6, I look at instances of gender complexity in típico as well as other Dominican musical genres like merengue de orquesta, bachata, and reggaetón. I first aim to explain why a number of cross-­dressing male performers appeared in the early 2000s and what their effect on Dominican music and gender performance has been; I then go on to describe artists who have questioned the heteronormativity of Dominican society through their musical performances. While many such performers are in part commercially motivated, I argue that their visibility nonetheless has important consequences, for it has paved the way for a more inclusive musical stage, which may in turn contribute to a more tolerant society. The seventh chapter focuses again on one particular performer, the openly lesbian, sometimes androgynous, and always thought-­ provoking writer, musician, and performance artist Rita Indiana. Through analysis of her music, videos, literary works, and live performances, I show how this artist not only has created new genres and brought queer femininities into the public sphere but also pushes listeners into a more active form of reception and reinterpretation, a practice I term “listening sideways.” I follow this chapter with a brief conclusion summarizing my findings and return to Maluca’s music as a frame for them. With this book I hope to make theoretical contributions, but they are not my only goal. By demonstrating the wide range and historical depth of a variety of Caribbean femininities and masculinities, I hope to help expand possibilities for women and men in the Dominican Republic and beyond, or at least to inspire such an expansion. As a whole, I want this book to open my readers’ ears and minds to the potentials a broader, more inclusive conception of gender offers. I hope to provide a new perspective on Caribbean gender that considers classic binaries but goes beyond them; to show how music can either reinforce entrenched gender roles or help to open up possibilities by imagining new roles and identities for all genders; to give concrete examples demonstrating the performativity of gender; and to show how powerfully musical performance unites gender, racial, national, and other identities, with both the problems and opportunities that such conjunctions entail. I write this book as a humanist at heart, but I think that at this historical juncture any humanist has to be a feminist first and, likewise, an Africanist and a queer activist. By this I mean that only in understanding the limits\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nplaced upon those who are most disadvantaged by the current world order—­ and working to remove them—­can all of us gain greater liberty. While I fully concede that writing an ethnography might be a poor substitute for concrete activism, Butler has suggested that “theory itself is transformative” (2004, 204), that simply expanding the questions we can ask about who is included in our common humanity and who remains outside it “open[s] up the category to a different future” (13). I believe that ethnography has that power to generate new questions and thus new futures, but I also concur with Butler that the potential can only be realized if those questions are accompanied by sustained social and political interventions (204–­5). A first step might be to “question everything,” as the old adage goes. That would mean ridding ourselves of received assumptions about what men and women do and are by asking ourselves what and who we think we are, and asking our Others what and who they want to be.\n\n2\n\nA Gendered History\n\nThe Dominican Republic is typically viewed, along with the rest of Latin America, as a patriarchal, machista (male chauvinist) society. Indeed, my experiences as a woman researching and playing merengue típico, or even just living in the Dominican Republic, were often frustrating. I never could adjust to the continual piropos (pick-­up lines) thrown my way by, it seemed, every man I passed on the street. The sound of Sssssss! Ssssssss!—­the typically Dominican way to attract one’s attention—­followed me everywhere, like a whole fleet of bicycles simultaneously getting flat tires. I felt this as an invasion of my space and my thoughts, which frequently made me angry. While Dominican friends advised me, “Get used to it! Aren’t you supposed adapt to our culture while you’re here?” I still found it difficult to accept. Another was when acquaintances offered advice seemingly predicated by my gender, in combination with my (then single) marital status. At the same time, I learned that many Dominican women felt differently: they found verbal attention from men in the street a validation of their feminine attractions, just as the men seemed to feel they became more masculine through giving such attention. This is just one example of how masculinities and femininities are built, and acquire value, relationally. In other ways, I found the country to be less machista than I had expected. I came to accept statements like “you can’t go there alone” as well-­intentioned advice motivated by growing violence in the city, rather than gender-­based behavioral proscriptions. Similarly, I was at first annoyed by the shock registered on the faces of many when they found out I lived alone, in my own apartment in a middle-­class Santiago neighborhood. While I thought it due to sentiments along the lines of “women need to be looked after” (or perhaps watched and monitored), I later realized that the same reaction might\n\nA Gendered History\n\n27\n\nbe expected by a solitary man: because of both the strength of extended families in Dominican culture and the proximity of neighbors, many Dominicans are unused to being alone and thus regard such a living arrangement with a mixture of horror and pity. My reactions had been based more on my preconceptions about Latino machismo than on the actual intentions of my interlocutors. Indeed, in the music world, I seldom found much opposition to my unconventional pursuits. Whether playing accordion, tambora, or palos, whether sharing a bottle of rum with musicians at their family home or hanging out at a car wash,1 I was welcomed into every situation, even when I was the only woman in a circle of men. And although I may have received some special treatment as a foreigner, my experiences were not unique—­I frequently met or saw Dominican women engaged in similar pursuits. Beyond my own personal experiences, what I saw going on in Dominican music did not seem to match the impression I had formed of Dominican society based on my preparatory reading. It wasn’t that what prior scholars had written was wrong; it just seemed one-­sided. From the beginning, I was impressed with how many women were involved in merengue típico, not only or even primarily as singers (as in other Latin American popular styles) but also as instrumentalists and bandleaders. How did this fit into the machista model? In addition, beginning not long after I started my research, certain male merengue singers—­two in the orquesta genre and one in típico—­ appeared who challenged typical masculine images by performing on stage in feminine attire. Audiences did not generally interpret this as a manifestation of the artists’ sexual preferences, but rather as an amusing element of their stage personas. Was this behavior just an extension of the general sense of play surrounding Dominican musical behavior? Or did it express some larger truth? Based on these observations, as well as the experience of learning how very much my own reactions were based upon my own cultural background, I soon came to believe that classic views of gender in Caribbean and Latin American society did not accurately describe the Dominican Republic—­at best, they did so in only a very partial way. The traditional dichotomy that opposed woman (home/private) to man (street/public) could not account for women in the típico world, either on stage or in the front rows as fans. The male-­provider / female-­nurturer model also did not truly fit the homes I visited, either on the island or among Dominicans in New York, where it was not uncommon to see women returning from a day at work to men washing the dishes or sweeping up. It seemed at least possible that previous scholars writing about gender in the Caribbean had been as influenced as I had at first been by their own cultural biases and/or Northern feminist ideals.\n\n28\n\nChapter t wo\n\nCaribbean gender scholar Linden Lewis states that the old roles I had read about—­like the “male breadwinner” and “exclusive ‘female nurturer’”—­are now outmoded in the region, so that “we are at a crucial conjuncture with respect to the change in the way men and women relate to each other” (2002, 513–­14). In places like the Dominican Republic, it is doubtful that those roles ever extended much beyond the Hispanophilic, Catholic elite. Modes of gender performance that differ by class and other factors can clearly be observed in historical típico lyrics, as we will see. Yet even here, the relationship between men and women has certainly entered a new era since the 1970s. It is not coincidental that this time period coincides with extensive musical transformations in Dominican music from merengue típico and merengue de orquesta to bachata and more. In this chapter, I outline the historical development of different but interrelated masculinities and femininities in the Dominican Republic, using musical examples to illustrate, and I conclude by explaining how this gendered history has enabled the emergence of a relatively large number of female accordionists in merengue típico. Throughout, I will show how gender and musical genre are linked. Each type of masculinity or femininity I present can be understood as one way of performing gender that has been salient either now or in the past. Studying historical gender constructions is necessary for understanding those modes of performance that exist today, as well as the ways in which típico musicians have alternately reinforced and challenged dominant modes of Dominican gender performance. These chapters provide background information that will serve to historicize and contextualize the arguments I make about musical expressions and constructions of gender in the rest of this book. Economics are an important part of this historical context. Linden Lewis cautions us that, besides attending to the relations between men and women and how roles are performed, we should also remember the relationship between gender, capitalism, and labor (2002, 519). My discussion here will show that socioeconomic systems carry with them particular gender roles that members of a society are expected to perform; therefore, the vast socioeconomic changes the Dominican Republic has undergone in the past half century have led to changes in the performance of gender. In particular, economic disparities and differing attitudes toward labor are strongly tied to the two principal modes of performing masculinity at present: the hombre serio or manso (serious or docile man) and the tíguere (tiger). In this discussion, I do not want to become an apologist for those Dominicans who do maintain traditionally oppressive gender roles. Such roles certainly exist and are not beneficial to women (nor are they, I would argue, to\n\nA Gendered History\n\n29\n\nmen); in some cases they are harmful to the extreme, leading to gender-­based violence. I simply wish to show that such roles do not explain all Dominicans’ experiences because they are not the totality of gender roles available in the Dominican Republic. In fact, while merengue típico and other forms of local, neotraditional culture are in some ways conservative, in other ways they can actually offer significant and important alternatives to global capitalism that include reinterpretations and reconfigurations of traditional gender roles. Male Roles Among the menagerie of masculinities available in the Dominican Republic, all adhere at least hypothetically to hierarchical notions of gender that place men at the top of the social ladder. Yet expressed ideals and actual behavior frequently do not match in daily practice. For instance, De Moya adheres to expressed ideals when he describes how Dominican middle-­and upper-­middle-­class boys are taught early on to steer themselves away from “feminine” behaviors in terms of body language, actions, and affinities; thus, they should learn neither piano nor violin and should not enter the kitchen, prepare meals, or sweep or mop “if there are available women” (2004, 72–­ 74). Lewis, on the other hand, reminds us that we should also recognize that “there is often a dissonance between public performance and private practice,” so that many Caribbean men have hidden housekeeping abilities (2002, 515)—­and, indeed, I frequently did observe Dominican men I knew well engaged in cleaning and cooking. The contradictions apparent in single mothers steering their boys to the most macho activities and feminists who marry insensitive men, Lewis further explains, show how “men and women satisfy public expectations of gendered behaviors which may or may not be compatible with their private views” (516). “Dissonance” between ideal and actual gender performance may be one explanation for my experience, but another is that the European-­derived gender distinctions embraced by Dominicans of a certain class have never held much water for the mulatto masses.2 To give an example, while the upper classes may attend churches with male priests, lower-­class Dominicans are more likely to participate in home-­based Afro-­Dominican religious practices, where women often hold leadership positions. In addition, the stay-­at-­ home mother is as much a luxury for urban Dominicans as it is for most US Americans today. Dominican men thus perform a range of masculine roles, many of which are conditioned by economics and even by race. Perhaps the most prevalent one today is the tíguere, the Dominican tiger (from the “proper” Spanish\n\n30\n\nChapter t wo\n\ntigre, but almost always spelled as a three-­syllable word by Dominicans discussing this role), a streetwise hustler. The tíguere is a role that is both temporally and spatially situated. It has evolved in a complex relationship with other Dominican male roles, particularly the hombre serio, which some see as its opposite, although I argue that the two actually have a more complex relationship. Simonson describes both as “projects of selfhood,” ways in which individuals make sense of their lives and relate to the larger society. The goal of these “projects” is both to gain social acceptance and to freely express the self through the creation of a self-­image and the building of a reputation (1994, 122). The hombre serio is considered as prior to the tíguere and linked to rural locations, while the latter is thought to be a more recent development that emerged through urbanization. These and other Dominican masculinities are thus strongly tied to a particular historical moment and social context, but they have evolved from earlier modes of masculinity including the montero and Concho Primo, and they relate to still other contemporary masculinities such as the hombre gallo, viejete, and bacano. I outline these here, as components of a gender history, as constructs of race and nation, and as models for actual actors in the Dominican music world. Historical Masculinities The roots of today’s hombre serio could be traced to the montero, a backwoods huntsman and the titular subject of an 1856 novelette by Pedro Francisco Bonó often cited as the beginning of Dominican fiction and, indeed, the Dominican nation (Bonó [1856] 2003). Also a machetero, a machete ever at his side, the montero adheres to codes of honor and is fearless in defending his own; Bonó describes him as enjoying the rural music and dance parties then known as fandangos. The montero is analogous to the Puerto Rican jíbaro, also a rustic subsistence farmer from the mountains and aficionado of Hispanic string band dance music, and a symbol of the Puerto Rican nation. In Cuba, the guajiro was a similar figure, a usually white peasant who played Hispanic string band music. This character was used as a stock figure in Cuban popular theater as early as the first half of the nineteenth century, and it was later absorbed into bufos, comic plays (Thomas 2009, 13–­15). Unlike in these neighboring islands, however, the Dominican montero did not survive as a masculine archetype. In the early twentieth century, the montero gave way to the belligerent, ignorant yet often ingenious peasant—­ generically called Concho Primo (Fig. 2.1)—­as a result of the assassinations, struggles, and state-­level financial problems of the early twentieth century.\n\nF i g u r e 2 . 1 . Illustration of Concho Primo by Bienvenido Gimbernard, 1919. Image in the public domain (WikiCommons).\n\n32\n\nChapter t wo\n\nConcho Primo is not a real name, but a joke, apparently a combination of the faux-­swear word concho, used in place of the naughtier coño, with primo (cousin), a term of familiarity like the Cuban compay that gives this type his homey flair (Calvo 2011). As a masculine archetype, the Concho Primo was a kind of Dominican Uncle Sam created and spread by cartoonist Bienvenido Gimbernard, who depicted him in a 1919 magazine caricature as a hat-­ and sandal-­wearing, pipe-­smoking campesino insolently leaning against a wooden chair with an accordion on his knee (see Fig. 2.1; see Rodríguez Demorizi 1972). Gimbernard’s son explained that the name and the character were based on a real person who then hung out in Santo Domingo’s Parque Colón, beginning all of his many stories with the words “Concho, primo” (Gimbernard 2009, 141; Damn, cousin). While the Concho Primo does not survive as a model of masculinity today, his name continues to stand for the historical period; for a kind of Dominican Robin Hood; or for old-­school, backwoods, caudillo-­centered politics in general (Calvo 2011); sometimes, it is even used to refer to the single-­row button accordion of early merengue típico. Various merengues from the early twentieth century describe Concho Primo-­like characters, including “La Batuta” (see Chaljub 2002, 101) and “Desiderio Arias.” Contemp orary Masculinities A more contemporary version of the independent but family-­minded montero is the hombre serio, which De Moya describes as a hegemonic heterosexual masculinity (2004, 83). In traditional rural society, a man’s image depended on obtaining a reputation as “serio” or serious, a term that refers to a person who is hard-­working, responsible, morally upstanding, and takes care of his or her family, rather than someone lacking a sense of humor (an hombre serio can, in fact, be funny). A man might demonstrate his seriedad by showing his own humility through acts of respect to other honorable men, thereby earning confianza or trust; he also had to gain honor through his conquest of women, mastery of dominos or cockfighting, or other kinds of rivalries (see Simonson 1994, 126–­34). A particularly successful and virile hombre serio might be termed an hombre gallo or gallo de hombre, a cock of a man (136–­37). This role seems the one most responsible for the Dominican Republic’s reputation for machismo, and it is quite similar to Hispanocentric masculinities found around Latin America. Historically, numerous lyrics to traditional merengues have extolled the hombre gallo way of life, which not coincidentally is connected to cockfighting; examples include “El papujito” (The Bearded Rooster) and “El gallo floriao” (The Black and White Rooster).\n\nA Gendered History\n\n33\n\nA version of the hombre gallo found in Dominican youth culture today is the bacano; known for style in attire and dancing as well as a high economic standing, bacanos can often be found in nightclubs playing the latest urban styles. Another kind of hombre serio is more prevalent in the merengue típico world, however: the viejete, a humorous term applied to male fans of merengue típico of any age who prefer old-­fashioned music (hence the etymological link to viejo, old). Viejetes are also termed seguidores (followers) and merengueros, this last a word more often applied to those who enjoy merengue than to those who make it. Viejetes are famous figures in their own right, known by name across the típico world; they dress in an elegant Caribbean style and engage in the conspicuous consumption of expensive bottles of liquor when attending típico shows in ranchos. As a group, viejetes exert enormous influence on merengue típico through their continuing demand for the core traditional repertoire. Viejetas or female fans also exist, but are a very small minority of traditional típico fans. Although these various masculinities are all available to Dominicans today, another masculinity dominates contemporary típico performance —­as indeed it does all genres of “urban” Dominican music, in which category I include modern típico. It is that of the tíguere, a tough guy or a hustler, the king of the streets, and thus a figure widely admired among youth and lower classes but disdained by elites (see Collado 2002, 15). The tíguere is also a sort of trickster, adept at wordplay, colorful slang, and doublespeak, sartorially resplendent and reputedly successful with women. De Moya classifies tígueres as either a dominant form of heterosexual masculinity or a “survivor” type of subordinate heterosexual masculinity (86; see his rather complex full typology in Table 2.1). The tíguere has particular spatial, temporal, social, and ethnic connotations. Spatially, the hombre serio was located either at home or at work, and ideally used the space in between only for temporary travel. But dominicanos today are stuck in between, and they must inhabit the liminal, dangerous space of la calle (the street)—­the domain of the tíguere. Also, tigueraje was and is an essentially urban phenomenon, in fact the first unique social type to evolve in Dominican cities (Collado 2002, 23, 60). Temporally, the tíguere subculture first arose in the barrios adjacent to the port in the capital city during the late 1920s (Collado 2002, 30) and gained national ascendancy after the fall of Trujillo, as changes in modes of production and economic decline made it impossible for most Dominican men to fulfill the economic obligations of seriedad. In racial terms, tigueraje is more often associated with dark-­skinned men, and in economic terms, with those from the rougher urban barrios (see Collado 2002, 112). So while many better-­off Dominicans,\n\n34\n\nChapter t wo\n\nT a b l e 2 . 1 . Antonio De Moya’s Typology of Dominican Masculinities (paraphrased) I. Hegemonic masculinities A. In household culture: hombre serio Related terms: hombre de palabra, hombre de pelo en pecho, padre de familia, señor don, hombre público, político, tutumpote, burgués, cacique, ejecutivo, empresario B. In street culture: tíguere Related terms: macho probao, verraco, barraco, pato macho, machazo, macharrán, bragao, machomén, machómetro, güebú, toro, bilíguer, bichán, líder, jefe, duro, comando, mayimbe, caballo, bacano, pachá, matatán C. Among Haitian migrants: papá bocó, lugarú, comegente II. Subordinate masculinities A. Hombres incompletos (incomplete men)—­e.g., single or childless men B. Hombres virtuales (virtual men)—­including hombre mamita and pariguayo, as well as cuckolds, unimportant and weak men C. Hombres sospechosos (suspicious men)—­including delicate or attractive men, dependent men, and gigolos D. Survivors or losers, the lowest category—­including tíguere-­tíguere, tíguere bimbín E. Subordinate bisexual masculinities—­including those suspected of being homosexual and male sex workers like sanky-­panky III. Marginal masculinities A. Out homosexuals B. Men raised as or behaving as women, including transvestites IV. Residual masculinities (virilized women)\n\nparticularly those with a more Hispanophilic orientation, would aspire to seriedad, others do not. Notably, in everyday Dominican speech the word manso is often used in place of serio. Manso means timid, docile, or calm, and particularly refers to a castrated horse or bull. Here, the difference between the hombre serio/manso and the fierce tíguere becomes particularly clear in terms of attitudes, comportment, and orientation, as well as class and racial background. Views of tígueres and hombres serios thus are equally varied, changing according to observers’ own race, class, and political sympathies. While the terminology of tigueraje certainly developed in urban contexts, rural predecessors did exist and can be noted in old típico tunes like “Le voy a dar una pela, mamá” (today known as “Arturo Almonte”) or “Un ser que me persigue,” a décima apparently borrowed from Puerto Rican jíbaro music into the típico repertoire. In both songs, male narrators brag about their skill in fighting and even boast of abusing insubordinate women. The troubling depiction of violence against women is part of a tradition of boastful competition poetry called poesía matonesca, something like “bully poetry,” that has its origins in Andalusia and in which Dominican women also have participated. For example, a décima improvised by Bartola Colón, born in 1928, declares\n\nA Gendered History\n\n35\n\nF i g u r e 2 . 2 . Julián Ramírez, El Viejo Tíguere. Business card of Julián Ramírez, collection of author.\n\n“I won’t trouble myself / over a man who goes about in the street / since I am no doll / if he’s going to leave, let him leave” (my translation from Payano 2003, 64).3 Concho Primo is another kind of proto-­tíguere. And in hindsight, scholars now view the dictator Rafael Trujillo as the ultimate tíguere, since he was himself a lower-­class underdog who ascended socially through sheer impudence and who also displayed a combination of style, violence, conspicuous consumption, and overt (hetero)sexuality (see Derby 1116). After Trujillo’s assassination, tigueraje spread and grew as Dominican cities rapidly urbanized and migrants emulated the tígueres’ lifeways as adaptations to their new environment (Collado 2002, 144–­45). Yet because this masculinity draws on notions of machismo with long roots in Dominican history, it should be viewed more as a transformation than a rupture with earlier lifeways. And while seriedad and tigueraje are valued differently in different levels of society, significant areas of overlap join the two. Indeed, even tígueres in the 1950s listened to perico ripiao (127–­28, 136); today they listen to merengue típico moderno (or con mambo), as well as reggaetón, merengue de calle, and other urban styles.
