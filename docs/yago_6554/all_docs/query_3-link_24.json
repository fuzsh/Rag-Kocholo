hands on me tonight You wanna come up Come find me I might be home You're looking for love Come find me And don't let go There's something about your vibe When we're all alone You wanna come up Come find me Come find me Come find me Put on that Little thing I like Send that pic To my phone line You got The code to My building right And the time that You need to get Satisfied You wanna come up Come find me I might be home You're looking for love Come find me And don't let go There's something about your vibe When we're all alone You wanna come up Come find me Come find me Come find me Tell me you wanna Come and Stay all night baby Tell me you wanna Come and Stay all night honey You're the one that gets me going Let me keep you up 'til morning We don't gotta be All alone All alone All alone All alone You wanna come up Come find me I might be home You're looking for love Come find me And don't let go There's something about your vibe When we're all alone You wanna come up Come find me Come find me Come find me You wanna come up Come find me I might be home You're looking for love Come find me And don't let go There's something about your vibe When we're all alone You wanna come up Come find me Come find me Come find me Come on come on up Come find me baby Too much looking for the feeling why not Too much looking for the feeling why not Too much looking for the feeling why not Too much looking for the feeling why not (When you're alone) Too much looking for the feeling why not (When you're alone) Too much looking for the feeling why not (When you're alone) Too much looking for the feeling why not (When you're alone) Too much looking for the feeling why not (When you're alone) Too much looking for the feeling why not (When you're alone) Too much looking for the feeling why not (When you're alone) Too much looking for the feeling why not When you're alone\n\n3.\n\nBad Decisions 2.0 05:46\n\nSometimes you look and find Somebody that fits you head to toe Oh oh oh oh And then there’s you and I Probably should stopped after hello Oh oh oh oh Red flags going off we would ignore Don't really wanna know We thought the vibe was right Couldn't wait to see where it could go Oh oh oh oh Cause we were out And thinking about Get to fooling around Making one, two or three Bad Decisions Bad Decisions Oh la la la la la Ahh Those moments late at night Told us that we couldn't get it wrong Oh oh oh oh So we could justify Every time our bodies wanted more Oh oh oh oh Red flags going off we would ignore Oh if we would've known Did this have a meaning Or just leave us wondering what we're looking for Oh oh oh oh But when we’re out Cause we were out And thinking about Get to fooling around Making one, two or three Bad Decisions We didn’t want to call it love Bad Decisions But in the end do we feel, feel dumb Bad Decisions We didn’t want to call it love Bad Decisions But in the end do we feel, feel dumb But in the end do we feel, feel dumb But in the end do we feel, feel dumb But in the end do we feel, feel dumb But in the end do we feel, feel dumb But in the end do we feel, feel No way to know No way to know If we're in love Or we're involved No way to know No way to know If we're in love And be we involved But when we’re out Cause we were out And thinking about Get to fooling around Making one, two or three Bad Decisions Red flags going off we would ignore We didn’t want to call it love Red flags going off we would ignore We didn’t want to call it love Red flags going off we would ignore We didn’t want to call it love Red flags going off we would ignore We didn’t want to call it love\n\n4.\n\nInterlude: That Ain’t You 00:31\n\n5.\n\nDon't Forget It 04:30\n\nIt’s true I lost all my loving Packed up and made a run After A long time of trying Crying and giving up All from A 1:47 Look to a sped up love In between It was so good Hope you Don’t think much about it Try to rewrite it no Not here to make up a story Tell you you had it Wrong Not here To give out a message To people I don’t know In between It was so good Don’t Forget It Don’t don’t forget it Don’t Forget It Don’t don’t forget it Don’t Forget It Don’t don’t forget it Don’t don’t forget it Don’t don’t forget it\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\nReal to Love 03:23\n\nWhen you feel alone and good for nothing When you’re thinking wants to pull you under Don't be afraid you're something Real to Love And when you’re trying to be good enough but Pulling back when you’re the baddest one Well don't be ashamed you're something Real to Love Whenever doubt hits and you need To shake your insecurities Remind yourself one thing And let it ring You’re something real to love You got that light inside you know To shine so beautiful And don't be afraid You're something Real to love You matter you belong you're one Atomic miracle And don't be ashamed You're something Real to Love You're not your productivity Your looks, your things, or money It’s easy when you see You’re something Real to Love My dear, you hear what I said So move up outta your own way You get to take up space And make mistakes This time this place You’re something Real to Love\n\n8.\n\nAlways After 04:55"
