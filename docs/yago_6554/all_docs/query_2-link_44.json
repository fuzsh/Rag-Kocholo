        "text": "Spanish is one of the worldâs most widely-spoken languages and Castilian (the version spoken in Spain) charms expats and tourists as quickly as the countryâs narrow cobblestoned streets and tasty tapas. Thinking about going to Spain? Make sure you learn these Spanish expressions and use them on anyone and everyone whoâll listen â itâll impress the locals and ensure that youâll have a much easier time making friends and fitting in.\n\n1. Â¡QuÃ© guay!\n\nHow do you say it? âGwaiâ\n\nWhat does it mean and how is it used? It means cool, awesome or great. Young people pepper their conversations with this adjective, responding to their friendsâ stories with a chorus of Â¡QuÃ© guay! (âHow cool!â)\n\n2. Vale\n\nHow do you say it? âBaleâ (the V turns into a B)\n\nWhat does it mean and how is it used? Very much a part of the Spaniardsâ vocabulary_,_ meaning OK, alright, sounds good, I understand or no problem. It comes from the verb valer (to be worth, as in Â¿cuÃ¡nto vale? â How much is it?) but means so much more. Itâs used as a way of agreeing or affirming what someone has said. (âWeâre meeting at 11am tomorrow, vale?â or âCall me later to organize that.â Vale, Iâll call you.) After a while in Spain youâll notice that people tend to use it twice in reply (vale, vale) which is endearing!\n\n3. Hombre\n\nHow do you say it? âOmbreâ (the H is silent)\n\nWhat does it mean and how is it used? It literally means âmanâ, and is also used to affirm or strengthen what youâre saying; typically to mean no, yes/of course, to greet or to plead. Youâll hear:\n\nNo â âDo you like your boss?â QuÃ© va, hombre, para nada. (No way, not at all.)\n\nYes/Of course â Â¡Claro que sÃ­, hombre! (Of course, or definitely)\n\nGreeting â Â¡Hombre! CÃ³mo estÃ¡s? (Hey man! How are you?)\n\nPleading â Â¡Vamos, hombre, por favor! (Aww, come on man, please.)\n\nAs a bonus, this isnât too strange-sounding to English speakers, because English âmanâ can be used in much the same way.\n\n4. TÃ­o/TÃ­a\n\nHow do you say it? _â_Tio/Tiaâ\n\nWhat does it mean and how is it used? While these literally mean âuncle,â and âaunt,â theyâre also used informally to generally refer to another person. In the same way English speakers use âdudeâ or âguyâ (âLook at those guys over there!â or âWho said that?â âI donât know, just some dude.â) Spaniards use tÃ­o or tÃ­a. You can also use these words to call the attention of a friend, as in âTÃ­o/tÃ­a, come here!â)\n\n5. Â¿CÃ³mo vas?\n\nHow do you say it? âComo basâ (Same thing here â the V is pronounced as a B)\n\nWhat does it mean and how is it used? Spaniards are a friendly bunch, quick to start up a conversation and armed with several ways to ask the classic âHow are you?â. These greetings are used casually all day â in small talk, such as when meeting friends, with well-known colleagues, chatting with a clerk at the store â so itâs great to know them. Many visitors will quickly learn Â¿QuÃ© tal? and our fifth expression is another to add to your small talk toolbox: Â¿CÃ³mo vas?, literally meaning âHow are you going?â\n\n6. Puente\n\nHow do you say it? âPuenteâ\n\nWhat does it mean and how is it used? Every employeeâs favorite â and a stereotype of life in Spain â is the puente, or three-day weekend. Often due to a saintâs feast day, these âbridgesâ, become the best Mondays and Fridays of the year!\n\n7. Guiri\n\nHow do you say it? âGiriâ\n\nWhat does it mean and how is it used? Anyone wanting to blend in in Spain has done their research on how not to look like a guiri. Guiris, pronounced âgiriâ, are (very obvious) foreigners usually hailing from English-speaking countries or central and northern Europe. The Spanish will call you out as a guiri for being generally non-Spanish: eating dinner or going out for evening drinks far too early; brandishing extra large maps and cameras on city corners; talking really loudly at monuments or while out sightseeing; wearing denim shorts with flip flops year round; and only ordering sangria.\n\n8. Buenas\n\nHow do you say it? âBuenasâ\n\nWhat does it mean and how is it used? Start your sunny Spanish morning off with a cheerful Buenos dÃ­as, continue with buenas tardes in the evening and end with buenas noches when itâs time to say goodbye or good night. Or, just stick to the sweet and simple âBuenas!â to say hello at any time of the day. Youâll receive a chipper âBuenas!â in return and can move on to more important considerations â like how much tortilla and patatas bravas are you going to order for lunch?\n\n9. Â¡Venga ya!\n\nHow do you say it? âBenga yaâ (Again, the V is pronounced as a B)\n\nWhat does it mean and how is it used? This is another very commonly-used expression in Spain and earns you extra points for stepping outside the usual list of expressions commonly learned by visitors. Â¡Venga ya! (or sometimes simply Â¡Venga!) is a way of expressing surprise or disbelief. Just like âno way,â âcome on!â or âcome off it!â in English, itâs used when you are shocked. (For example, if you learned that your friend had ordered 15 tortillas and ten plates of patatas bravas â then proceeded to eat it all.)\n\n10. Pasta\n\nHow do you say it? _â_Pastaâ (just like your favorite grub!)"
