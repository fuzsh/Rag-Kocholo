        "text": "Librarian of Congress James H. Billington today announced his annual selection of 25 motion pictures to be added to the National Film Registry (see attached list). This group of titles brings the total number of films placed on the Registry to 400.\n\nUnder the terms of the National Film Preservation Act, each year the Librarian of Congress names 25 \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant motion pictures to the Registry. The list is designed to reflect the full breadth and diversity of America's film heritage, thus increasing public awareness of the richness of American cinema and the need for its preservation. In making the announcement, the Librarian said, \"Our film heritage is America's living past. It celebrates the creativity and inventiveness of diverse communities and our nation as a whole. By preserving American films, we safeguard a significant element of our cultural history.\"\n\nThis year's selections span the years 1909 to 1993, and encompass films ranging from Hollywood classics to lesser-known, but still vital, works. Among the films named this year:\n\nThe Blue Bird - Maurice Tourneur's beautiful expressionist adaptation of Maurice Maeterlink's play remains one of the most aesthetically pleasing films. Enchanting, sumptuous, and a perfectly composed pictorial entrance into a fantasy world, which tries to teach us not to overlook the beauty of what is close and familiar.\n\nA Bronx Morning - Part documentary and part avant-garde, this renowned city symphony was filmed by Jay Leyda when he was 21. It features sensational and stylish use of European filmmaking styles The images movingly show the resilience of people persevering with style and enthusiasm during the early years of the depression. \"A Bronx Morning\" won Leyda a scholarship to study with the renowned Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein.\n\nClash of the Wolves - In one of the greatest stories in film history, German shepherd Rin-Tin-Tin (Rinty) was rescued from a German trench during World War I by American soldier Lee Duncan, who trained the dog and took him to Hollywood. Rinty quickly became one of the biggest stars of 1920s Hollywood, reportedly saving Warner Bros. studio from bankruptcy. In \"Clash of the Wolves\" resourceful Rinty ingeniously rescues the good guys while foiling the crooks.\n\nThe Court Jester - In this delightful adventure parody, famed comedian Danny Kaye plays a peasant leader who restores the rightful heir to the throne of England once he learns that \"The pellet with the poison is in the flagon with the dragon (not the chalice from the palace); the vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true.\"\n\nD.O.A. - This pulsating film noir tells the story of a man who has been poisoned and tries to find his killer during his remaining few days. The dialogue sparkles as in this scene between the victim and a police officer: \"I want to report a murder/Sit down. When was this murder committed/San Francisco, last night/Who was murdered? I was.\"\n\nDaughters of the Dust - This is the first feature-length film by an African-American woman to receive a wide theatrical release. Julie Dash eschews traditional forms of film narrative for a poetic, impressionistic collage of gorgeous colors, music and imagery, in telling the story of three generations of African-American who meet on the Gullah South Carolina Sea Island in 1902. Evocative, emotional look at family, era and place.\n\nDuck and Cover - This landmark civil defense film was seen by millions of schoolchildren in the 1950s. As explained by Bert the Turtle, to survive an atomic attack you must \"duck and cover\".\n\nEmpire - Controversial since the day of its release in 1964, Andy Warhol’s grueling, eight-hour, one-shot stationary camera take of the Empire State Building shakes the conventions of cinema by redefining concepts of perception, action and cinematic time. The film features a continuous presence broken into separate pieces of time by 100-foot rolls of film and light flashes. Hailed as a masterpiece by some and a vapid exercise by others, “Empire” continues to produce comment, bewilderment and amazement.\n\nEnter the Dragon - Martial arts legend Bruce Lee burst onto the American scene with this pulsating action flick, climaxed with the dazzling \"Hall of Mirrors\" sequence. Although Lee unexpectedly died shortly before the film’s release, \"Enter the Dragon\" became a huge hit and Lee garnered legendary status.\n\nEraserhead - A visually stunning portrayal of a man facing fatherhood in a nightmarish industrial world, David Lynch's first feature-length film introduced American audiences to his unique, surrealistic style of sparse dialogue, unsettling characters, horrific imagery and a paradoxically abstract narrative. \"Eraserhead\" secured Lynch's place as a hero for fans craving unorthodox filmmaking.\n\nGarlic Is As Good As Ten Mothers - Les Blank's hilarious and affectionate homage to \"The Stinking Rose\" delights slightly wacky devotees or alliumophiles. In their mind, garlic is the benevolent dictator of pungent herbs, always enhancing food rather than dominating it. The rallying cry is \"Fight Mouthwash, Eat Garlic.\" Gastronomic, zestful, tasty and memorable, the film often is screened in \"AromaRound\" with a pot of garlic butter boiling at the back of the theater.\n\nGoing My Way - This sentimental film favorite features Bing Crosby as a kindhearted Catholic priest whose upbeat, infectious personality, musical gifts, and acts of compassion rejuvenate his congregation and leave the community \"swinging on a star.\"\n\nJailhouse Rock - This film showcasing Elvis Presley is in the ultimate rebel mode. The edginess reflected in this film was toned down in the singer’s later movies.\n\nKannapolis, NC - This example of a “town portrait” was chosen to honor itinerant filmmakers who made films of ordinary people on typical days during the 1930s and 1940s. They showcased this footage (in return for a portion of the receipts) at local cinemas prior to the Hollywood feature films. The surviving footage of the towns and its people often became the sole record of these cultural enclaves. H. Lee Waters, who made movies in 117 towns across North Carolina , South Carolina , Virginia and Tennessee , filmed all of Kannapolis ’ separate communities, slyly making sure to include lots of shots of children to attract the entire family to the theaters.\n\nLady Helen’s Escapade - This sprightly short comedy stars actress Florence Lawrence (“The Biograph Girl”) who became the first true star in American cinema through a combination of natural charm and canny publicity. She was the first actor or actress to receive billing in film credits, a break from the anonymity that actors and actresses had worked in until that point.\n\nThe Nutty Professor - This is considered comic genius Jerry Lewis’ greatest film.\n\nOffOn - This landmark work from California filmmaker Scott Bartlett is the first avant-garde work to fully marry video with film. The film combines masterful usage of optical printing, superimposing images, color saturation and hand-dying of the film strip, making abstractions from natural images.\n\nPopeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor - Wildly popular during the 1930s, Popeye’s impact was matched only by Mickey Mouse, his chief rival for cartoon supremacy. This classic by renowned animators Max and Dave Fleischer features lush three-dimensional sets, Technicolor, and was twice the length of normal eight-minute cartoons.\n\nPups Is Pups - One of the finest comedy shorts from the beloved Our Gang series, this film enchanted audiences from 1922 to 1944. The gang systematically wrecks havoc at a fancy pet show when they bring in their own pet mice, pigs, goats and toads.\n\nSwing Time - Legendary Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire musical features magical dancing set to six wonderful Jerome Kern tunes, including \"Never Gonna Dance,\" \"A Fine Romance,\" and \"The Way You Look Tonight.\"\n\nThere It Is - One of the increasingly famous Charley Bowers surrealist shorts, this film combines live action with stop-motion object animation in settings where the usual rules do not apply. This “Scotland Yard investigates Haunted House” spoof features the adorable animated bug MacGregor.\n\nThe Librarian chose this year's selections after evaluating nearly 1,000 titles nominated by the public and conducting intensive discussions with the Library's Motion Picture division staff and the distinguished members and alternates of his advisory group, the National Film Preservation Board. The board also advises the Librarian on national film preservation policy.\n\n“The films we choose are not necessarily the ‘best’ American films ever made or the most famous, but they are films that continue to have cultural, historical or aesthetic significance -- and in many cases represent countless other films also deserving of recognition,” Billington observed. “The selection of a film, I stress, is not an endorsement of its ideology or content, but rather a recognition of the film's importance to American film and cultural history and to history in general. The Registry stands among the finest summations of American cinema's wondrous first century.”\n\nThe 400 films in the National Film Registry represent a stunning range of American filmmaking – including Hollywood features, documentaries, avant-garde and amateur productions, films of regional interest, ethnic, animated and short film subjects -- all deserving recognition, preservation and access by future generations.\n\nThis key component of American cultural history, however, remains a legacy with much already lost or in peril. Billington explained: \"In spite of the heroic efforts of archives, the motion picture industry and others, America 's film heritage, by any measure, is an endangered species. Fifty percent of the films produced before 1950 and 80 to 90 percent made before 1920 have disappeared forever. Sadly, our enthusiasm for watching films has proved far greater than our commitment to preserving them. And, ominously, more films are lost each year -- through the ravages of nitrate deterioration, color-fading and the recently discovered ‘vinegar syndrome,’ which threatens the acetate-based [safety] film stock on which the vast majority of motion pictures, past and present, have been reproduced.”\n\nFor each title named to the registry, the Library of Congress works to ensure that the film is preserved for all time, either through the Library's massive motion picture preservation program or through collaborative ventures with other archives, motion picture studios and independent filmmakers. The Library of Congress contains the largest collections of film and television in the world, from the earliest surviving copyrighted motion picture to the latest feature releases.
