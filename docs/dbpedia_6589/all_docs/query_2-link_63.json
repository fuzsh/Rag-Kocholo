        "text": "Raymond Durgnat described Time Without Pity as being the first English film to offer its director Joseph Losey a plot. It begins with the murder of Jennie Cole (Christina Lubicz), brutally strangled by Robert Stanford (Leo McKern). Alcoholic writer David Graham (Michael Redgrave) lands in England from Canada, we know he is of importance when he pushes a photographer away after getting off the plane. Graham with a trench coat is like a dazed Jean-Pierre Melville character hired out of town to do a hit whilst filled with ridden guilt. Graham has arrived to visit son Alec (Alec McCowen) 24 hours before he is to be hanged for the murder of Jennie Cole. Of course we know the guilty man is Stanford. Jeremy Clayton (Peter Cushing) is Alec’s lawyer, Cushing is dapper, he treats the role with an intense seriousness which is to be expected from those who know and love his work. McCowen’s reaction to seeing Redgrave and accepting defeat to the gallows whilst innocent might seem unconvincing, his life is shattered however and the all evidence points to him. Based on Emlyn Williams’ play Someone Waiting Losey uses cinematic techniques wherever possible, the reflection of father and son through the glass at the prison in a shot reserve shot, the lightning on Redgrave’s face. Redgrave’s gestures, his withering shakes, constant checking of his watch form a stunningly sombre performance. McKern’s performance on the other hand builds to intensity as he shrieks for peace in his apartment and later workplace over the murder case which he is so obviously guilty of. “Can’t you understand what I’m going through” he says,\n\nLosey plays with the sound as Graham remembers and imagines snippets of dialogue; it’s a very innovative use of audio as well as a ‘rainy’ dream effect visually. Redgrave really is one of the best screen drunks; it’s devastating when he finally gives in. Durgnat likens the film to a ‘soul fight’, a Thomas H. Ince type Western, Ince was a producer he died in 1924, he made over 800 films and was known in Hollywood as ‘the father of the western. The stand-off at the film’s finale recalls a western as Redgrave stumbles after McKern by a racing track then up a flight of steps and into an office corridor. One is reminded of Di Caprio’s stumbling walk towards Tom Hardy at the finale of The Revenant. Vague comparisons with Graham walking around London could be to Eyes Wide Shut or even Ulysses, a man’s dreamlike journey through a city. Time Without Pity is a noir melodrama, Tristram Cary’s score and McCowen and McKern’s acting styles hammer it home. Of course the plot on paper heightens it to extremes. Stanford’s wife Honour (Ann Todd) is an angel who brings Alec in from the cold; he sees sense and a love for life if only for a moment.\n\nThe Stanfords live a pretty cushy live on Lowndes Street in Belgravia, Central London. These soul fights that Durgnat refers to; Stanford’s guilt over the affair and murder of Jennie on his life and career, Graham’s relationship with his son and alcohol, Alec wrestling with the value of life whilst imprisoned, Brian giving up his stepfather to the police, Honour’s love for Alec, Alec for her and finally Vickie Harker’s (Lois Maxwell) love for Stanford, her pay-off with a promotion for his alibi and her relationship with her alcoholic mother (Renèe Houston).That’s eight character’s intense lives across 85 minutes running time!\n\n“People don’t always act logically, not everything is thought out’ Brian tells Graham. And what of Vickie’s love for Stanford who she goes against towards the end, the need for a father in him? To be given power? Her apartment is quite rugged looking. We don’t know how Honour and Stanford have lasted this long; perhaps for the same reasons; power, status. Todd is astonishingly 13 years older than McKern! McKern treats her like his mother in the final moment of the film. McKern’s accent in the film is Northern English; his employees on the track too are Northerners too. It’s interesting as McKern is actually Australian. There is a sense of pride perhaps in McKern’s character rising from the ranks of working class to achieve his business, giving the other lads opportunities in London also. Redgrave went to Cambridge which I suppose fits Graham’s character. Perhaps Losey insisted on McKern’s accent to counter balance the self made working class man turned industrialist soul fighting with an upper class Cambridge educated man turned novelist. Perhaps this is why McKern takes such relish against Redgrave at the end; ‘do you see this (motioning to his office building) this is me! And do you see this (emptying a liquor bottle) this is you!’"
