        "text": "Marius was the first film produced from a play by Marcel Pagnol. Although the film, which cost approximately $80,000 to produce, according to Var, was released in France in 1931, it was not released in the U.S. until 1933. The release time cited by FD and Var indicates that the film was cut by approximately twenty minutes for its American release. Var noted that for the 1933 release, the censors made fifty-two cuts. According to Var, the cast of the film played in the Paris stage production, which at the time of the film's Paris opening, was still being performed. This is the first film in a series of three based on plays by Pagnol. Fanny, produced by Pagnol in 1932, starred ORANE DEMAZIS and Raimu, as did César, which was released in 1936. German and Swedish versions of Marius were also produced at the Paramount studios in Joinville, but no information concerning any showings of those versions in the U.S. has been located. The German version, entitled Zum goldenen Anker, was directed by Alexander Korda and starred Ursula Grabley and Mathias Wieman; the Swedish version, entitled Längtan till havet, was directed by John W.

Kane wanted to use well-known French actors in Marius, but director Alexander Korda, after seeing the play, sided with playwright Pagnol and convinced Kane to use the cast of the play. Some modern sources state that Korda brought his brother Vincent, who until then had been a painter and had not worked in films, to design the sets. Vincent Korda subsequently had a distinguished career in films as a leading art director. Other modern sources, state that Alfred Junge and a third Korda brother, Zoltán, designed the sets; however, Zoltán Korda's listing is probably erroneous, as he was primarily a director. In addition, modern sources state that Pagnol worked on the film as supervisor and that Harold Young was the editor. The 1938 M-G-M film Port of Seven Seas (see below) was based primarily on the Pagnol play Fanny, although it included some incidents that were contained in Marius. In 1961, Warner Bros. released a film based on Pagnol's trilogy, entitled Fanny, which was produced and directed by Joshua Logan and starred Leslie Caron, Maurice Chevalier and Charles Boyer (see AFI Catalog of Feature Films, 1961-70).\n\nLess\n\nIn the Marseilles harbor, Marius, the son of café owner Cesar, dreams of working on the exploring ship Malaysia in order to travel.

Honorine complains to Cesar, who later tells Marius of his responsibility to Fanny by relating the story of Fanny's aunt, whose virtue was compromised, and who was later deserted and had to turn to prostitution. With this in mind, Marius again rejects the offer of the mate of the Malaysia when he comes to the café, but Fanny informs him that she has already arranged to marry Panisse so that Marius will not be forced to lead a miserable land-bound life. Appalled by Fanny's manipulations but grateful for the opportunity it offers, Marius slips out of the café as Cesar, assuming his son will soon be married, discusses living arrangements with Fanny. Fanny faints when the Malaysia clears the harbor, and Cesar calls for his son, but receives no response.\n\nLess"
