With his former buddies in murderous pursuit, Angel outwits the gang by driving through a railroad freight yard and finding refuge at a northern California sheep ranch. Dan Felton, the owner of the ranch and a former biker himself, gives Angel a job and rents him a shack, which Lauri converts into a comfortable home.
