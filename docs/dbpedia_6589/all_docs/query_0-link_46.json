        "text": "What books are on your night stand?\n\nI’ve been traveling, so I’ll tell you what’s on my hotel night stand: “The Pocket Haiku,” compiled and translated by Sam Hamill. I like to take this tiny book with me when I leave home. Reading and rereading these poems by Bashō, Buson, Issa and other Japanese masters is a kind of meditation for me. And it’s good to be reminded how much insight and emotion can be expressed in just three short lines.\n\nWhat’s the last great book you read?\n\n“All My Cats,” by Bohumil Hrabal, a memoir that he completed in 1983 but that was only recently published here, in a translation from the Czech by Paul Wilson. This is one of those rare books that meet Kafka’s ideal of what a book should be: “An ax for the frozen sea within us.” It also meets Nabokov’s concise definition of art: “Beauty plus pity.”\n\nCan a great book be badly written? What other criteria can overcome bad prose?\n\nHow can bad writing ever be great writing? If a book is a work of prose and the prose is bad, the book is bad. Anyone can come up with a great idea for a book, but you don’t make books out of ideas, you make them out of language.\n\nDescribe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how).\n\nOnly the “what” really matters, and that’s the beauty of it: A great story casts a spell. It can enthrall you so completely that you not only forget that you’re stuck between two manspreaders in a noisy, crowded, smelly subway car but miss your stop."
