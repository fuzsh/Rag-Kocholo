        "text": "It seems like every day another antisemitic incident shakes our community. Reports in the last month alone on assaults in London, Toronto, Paris and New York could fill several pages. In a world where antisemitism is becoming normalised, the importance of being confident in our Jewish identity has never been more critical.\n\nAs Jews, we are no strangers to adversity. For millennia, we have faced persecution, discrimination and hatred. Yet throughout history our resilience and unwavering spirit have been our guiding lights. Today, once again, we must stand tall and embrace our Jewish identity not only with pride but with confidence, as a beacon of strength for future generations.\n\nIn The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), Hannah Arendt highlighted a disturbing societal trend in Europe: Jewish acceptance into non-Jewish society was conditional back then, granted only if they were seen as “Exceptional Jews,” distinct from the Jewish masses. This paradox required them to straddle the line between being part of their community and distinctly separate from it. The psychological toll was immense, as these newly Westernised, educated Jews faced the demoralising pressure to distinguish themselves and become outstanding examples of humanity. This trend hasn’t ended.\n\nAntisemitism shows itself in various forms but it has one objective: to undermine and erase Jewish identity. It manifests in overt acts of violence, subtle micro-aggressions and institutional biases. In the face of this growing tidal wave of assaults, it is easy to feel vulnerable and isolated. As many of us are integrated into Western societies, it becomes tempting to hide our identity in exchange for acceptance. However, history teaches us that the key to overcoming this hatred lies not in retreat but in the bold affirmation of who we are.\n\nTo be confident in our Jewish identity means to embrace every aspect of it – our rich cultural heritage, our diverse traditions and our shared history. It means celebrating Shabbat with joy, wearing our kippot and Magen David necklaces without fear, placing a mezuzah on our doorposts and educating others about the beauty and complexity of our identity. Confidence in who we are is a form of resistance against those who seek to diminish us.\n\nBut pride alone is not enough. We must have the courage to speak out against antisemitism whenever and wherever we encounter it. Silence in the face of hatred allows it to fester. By confronting antisemitism head-on, we challenge its normalisation and force society to reckon with its presence and impact.\n\nEducation is crucial in fostering this confidence. Knowledge empowers us to counteract ignorance and misinformation. By learning about our history, our contributions to the betterment of the world, and the roots of antisemitism, we arm ourselves with the tools to combat hatred. Jewish education should encompass the vast spectrum of Jewish thought, culture, and achievements. Our heritage is a tapestry of remarkable achievements that deserve recognition and celebration.\n\nMoreover, being confident in our Jewish identity involves fostering a strong sense of community. Antisemitism thrives on isolation and division. By building and nurturing strong Jewish communities, we create networks of support and solidarity. These connections are vital in reinforcing our identity and providing a united front against antisemitism.\n\nSocial media, while often a breeding ground for hate speech, can also be a powerful tool for promoting Jewish unity, pride and combating antisemitism.\n\nBy sharing our stories, highlighting our achievements, and challenging antisemitic narratives, we can reclaim our story and assert our identity on a global stage.\n\nJewish leaders, whether in religious, political or cultural spheres, have the responsibility to set an example and inspire others. Leadership is essential to fostering Jewish confidence. By being vocal and unapologetic about our Jewish identity, we pave the way for others to do the same.\n\nIn his Hope Speech in 1978, Harvey Milk, the American gay and Jewish civil rights leader, strongly advocated for every gay person to come out to their immediate family, relatives, friends, colleagues - and even the people they encounter in their daily lives. He believed that by doing so, “they would realise that we are indeed everywhere” and then “every myth, every lie, every innuendo will be destroyed once and for all.”\n\nThat is true for every Jew today, too. We must actively “come out” as Jewish every day. The importance of being confident in our Jewish identity when facing antisemitism cannot be overstated. It is a declaration of our resilience, our pride, and our unyielding spirit.\n\nBy embracing our identity with confidence, we honour the memory of those who came before us and lay a solid foundation for those who will come after us."
