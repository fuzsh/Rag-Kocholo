        "text": "When you′re young and so in love as we\n\nAnd bewildered by the world we see\n\nWhy do people hurt us so\n\nOnly those in love would know\n\nWhat a Town Without Pity can do\n\nIf we stop to gaze upon a star\n\nPeople talk about how bad we are...\n\nOurs is not an easy age\n\nWe're like tigers in a cage\n\nWhat a Town Without Pity can do\n\nThe young have problems\n\nMany problems\n\nWe need an understanding heart\n\nWhy don′t they help us, try to help us\n\nBefore this clay and granite planet falls apart...\n\nTake these eager lips and hold me fast\n\nI'm afraid this kind of joy can't last\n\nHow can we keep love alive\n\nHow can anything survive\n\nWhen these little minds tear you in two\n\nWhat a town Without Pity can do\n\nHow can we keep love alive\n\nHow can anything survive\n\nWhen these little minds tear you in two\n\nWhat a town Without Pity can do\n\nWriter(s): DIMITRI TIOMKIN, NED WASHINGTON<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
