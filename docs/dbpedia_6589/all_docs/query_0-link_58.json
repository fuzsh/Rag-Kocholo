        "text": "Gene Pitney (born February 17, 1941, Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.—died April 5, 2006, Cardiff, Wales) was an American singer and songwriter known for dramatic pop balladry. Pitney first gained success as a songwriter with hits such as “Hello Mary Lou” (recorded by Rick Nelson in 1961) and “He’s a Rebel” (recorded by the Crystals in 1962).\n\nIn 1961 Pitney began recording his compositions, with “I Wanna Love My Life Away” demonstrating a passionate vocal style. However, he sold more records with songs by other writers, such as “Town Without Pity” and Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance”; the latter rendition rose to number four in the American pop charts in 1962. Pitney also reached the Top Ten with “Only Love Can Break a Heart” (1962), “It Hurts to Be in Love” (1964), and “I’m Gonna Be Strong” (1964). As his career waned in the United States, Pitney enjoyed continued popularity in Europe. An Italian-language country album sold well in 1966, and he appeared regularly on the British pop charts through 1970. In 1989 a rerecording of “Something’s Gotten Hold of My Heart” (duet with Marc Almond) became his first number one song in England. Pitney was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. A tireless performer, he died while on tour in 2006."
