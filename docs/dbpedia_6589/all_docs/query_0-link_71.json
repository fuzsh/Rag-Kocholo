        "text": "EDITOR'S NOTE: \"Caprock Chronicles\" is a yearlong series of short articles and essays that examine the life, people and historical places of our region's past. Paul Carlson, professor emeritus of history at Texas Tech, writes or edits each contribution in the set. Today's essay is written by Meredith McClain, professor emeritus of languages at Texas Tech and a long-standing member of the international Karl May Society. She looks at a German author who in his best-selling western novels wrote with much fantasy about the Llano Estacado.\n\nIn the late 1970s and the 1980s, young German backpackers coming to Lubbock often asked two questions: \"Wo ist der Buddy Holly Park?\" and \"Wo ist der Llano Estacado?\" Answering the first question was not a problem, but the second? Just where is the Llano Estacado?\n\nSince the 1970s, several books have thoroughly defined and described the region of which Lubbock is the unofficial capital. In addition, weathermen and women now talk about \"the weather on the Llano.\"\n\nStill, I was unprepared for the response of an audience in Bonn, Germany, when representing Texas Tech I introduced myself and said I came from Lubbock, Texas, \"the capital of the Llano Estacado.\"\n\nAll the Germans in the room looked at me very intently. At the end of the program many of them approached to say they thought people could not live on the Llano Estacado because there was so little water. They also mentioned \"bad guys\" riding about the desert, moving signs to water so people would go astray and die before being robbed.\n\nOne German took pity on me saying, \"Look up the writer Karl May.\"\n\nBorn in 1842, Karl Friedrich May was the fifth of 14 children, nine of whom died in infancy. His father was a weaver. Although Karl performed well in school, his increasingly nefarious activities landed him in prison - twice.\n\nSometime after his second prison experience, May became an editor at MÃ¼chmeyer Press in Saxony, his home state. Starting there, and then without ever leaving Germany, he wrote western adventure stories in the first person. He set four of the novels on the Llano Estacado, and in them and other books he described the American Southwest.\n\nSo convincing were his descriptions that his readers - mainly young boys and girls - knew that he, Karl, was Charlie, the German frontiersman, aka \"Old Shatterhand,\" blood-brother of the handsome, wise and honorable Mescalero Apache, Chief Winnetou.\n\nThe two popular characters rode from one thrilling adventure to the next on the dangerous Llano Estacado. The stories became best-selling novels.\n\nIn later years, revelations that May had never been to the Llano created minor scandals. Adult fans felt betrayed after they discovered that for personal appearances as Old Shatterhand, May dressed in \"western\" outfits created in Germany and used guns crafted in Dresden.\n\nChildren did not mind, and when not allowed to peruse May's writings, they went under the bed covers with a flashlight to read his \"forbidden\" books, one dog-eared copy after another. Winnetou and Old Shatterhand became household words throughout the German-speaking world.\n\nNear the end of World War II, purportedly, Karl May and his heroes of the American West became signals for German soldiers. If he heard someone approaching his position, a German soldier, worried it might be an American, whispered \"Karl May.\" \"Winnetou\" was the coded answer.\n\nMay's growing success worldwide got an enormous boost in the 1960s. During the decade, West German filmmakers in communistic Yugoslavia turned several Winnetou stories into movies.\n\nMost stared Lex Barker (who also played Tarzan) as handsome, invincible Old Shatterhand, riding beside Winnetou, played by a Frenchman, Pierre Brice. In the movies, Serbo-Croatians played Native American parts.\n\nKarl May died in 1912. A wealthy businessman, he never set foot on the Texas High Plains, but nonetheless contributed in various ways to the mystique of the Llano Estacado.\n\nToday, May is the best-selling German-language author, having sold an estimated 100 million copies of his books in German and 100 million in about 50 other languages.\n\nThere are hundreds of Western and Indian clubs throughout the Republic of Germany (one being \"Lubbock Town\" outside Cologne), at least seven outdoor theaters presenting May's stories and a Karl May Society, which had almost reached its goal of 2,000 members worldwide. In September 2000, it held a conference in Lubbock.\n\nAbout 1983, Professor Theodore Alexander, founder of the department of Germanic and Slavic languages at Texas Tech, said that after escaping Adolph Hitler's takeover of Austria in the late 1930s, he landed safely in America. He came to Lubbock looking for the fantasy land of his childhood - Karl May's der Llano Estacado.\n\nExcerpt from Karl May's \"Des Geist der Llano estakado\" (1888)\n\n(\"The Ghost of the Llano Estacado\")\n\n\"There, where the Southeast edge of New Mexico juts into the region of Texas, lies one of the most dangerous corners of the distant West. It is there that the adjacent territories of the Comanches and Apaches touch a situation which as it natural consequence the continuous insecurity of the area.\n\n\"The Shears,\" as the Frontiersman calls this dangerous place, is a very fitting name. The boundary lines are mobile; they open and close like shearing blades, and anyone who comes between them may speak of great luck to escape with his skin intact. A white man who lets himself be seen there is either extremely brave or very careless; in both cases the \"vulture of death\" circles endlessly over his head.\n\nThere, where the Toya River emerges from the Devil's Mountains and flows into the Rio Pecos, the latter shaped in those days the border between the land of the Comanches and Apaches. Westward the terrain ascends to the Sierra Guadalupe, Sierra Pilaros and Sierra del Diablo, while in the East lie the Staked Plains - the infamous Llano Estacado. (Pp. 215-16)"
