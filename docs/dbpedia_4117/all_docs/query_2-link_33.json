        "text": "The second giant boring machine (TBM) building HS2 under the Chiltern Hills broke through at the tunnel’s northern portal late this afternoon, completing a journey that began in June 2021.\n\nNamed Cecilia, the TBM has driven for 10 miles underground to join twin sister machine – Florence. She arrived at the site near the Buckinghamshire town of Wendover on 27 February, after completing her adjacent tunnel drive.\n\nBetween them, the two 2,000 tonne machines have built the twin bore tunnel at depths of up to 80 metres and excavated three million cubic metres of chalk. Each machine operates like an underground factory, able to excavate the tunnels and line them with 56,000 pre-cast concrete tunnel segments, grouting them into place and moving forward at an average speed of 16 metres per day.\n\nWhen HS2 is operational trains will travel through the Chiltern tunnel – the line’s longest – at speeds of up to 200mph, helping to almost halve journey times between Britain’s two largest cities.\n\nThe new high-speed line will relieve traffic on the West Coast Mainline, freeing up space for more local services on the most crowded part of the important Victorian route. It will almost double rail capacity between London and the West Midlands, providing a more reliable service and driving economic growth.\n\nHS2 Ltd’s head of civil works for this section of the route, Mark Clapp, said:\n\n“Today is a remarkable achievement for all concerned. Cecilia’s arrival completes excavation of HS2’s 10-mile twin-bore tunnel, but it’s only the end of the first chapter in the story of building Britain’s high-speed railway under the Chiltern Hills.\n\n“Several years of intensive, world class engineering lie ahead of us to complete the tunnels’ four ventilation shafts plus headhouses; install the mechanical and electrical plant and machinery, slab track and overhead electrical wires before trains begin passing through at 200mph.”\n\nBoth machines launched from the tunnel’s south portal, near the M25 motorway, were operated by HS2’s main works contractor, Align – a joint venture formed of three international infrastructure companies: Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick. The machines are made in Germany by TBM specialists Herrenknecht.\n\nAlign’s Underground Construction Director, Didier Jacques said:\n\n“Ten miles is a long drive for a TBM, with a typical average being around three miles. The complexity and technical challenges of completing such a long drive for both our TBMs has been significant, however I am delighted that as a team, we have risen to the challenge.\n\n“Both TBMs were designed in partnership with Herrenknecht and incorporating innovations and technologies that have been introduced on TBMs in the UK for the first time, to enhance performance and safety. This includes ‘semi-continuous boring’, allowing our TBMs to build the rings that line the tunnels without pausing.”\n\nEach TBM is operated by a crew of around 17, working in shifts to keep the machines running when required 24/7. They are supported by over 100 people on the surface, managing the logistics and maintaining the smooth progress of the tunnelling operation.\n\nIn total over 450 people have worked on the tunnels over the last three years, including a dedicated production team who made 112,000 precision-engineered, fibre-reinforced concrete tunnel wall segments on site at a purpose build temporary factory - and a team processing the spoil from the tunnels.\n\nCompletion of tunnelling under the Chilterns follows recent publication of HS2 Ltd research showing how high-speed line’s arrival in the West Midlands will give a £10 billion economic boost over the next decade, with new development around its stations at Birmingham’s Curzon Street and near the city’s airport and the NEC.\n\nHS2’s first giant tunnelling machine – which launched almost 3 years ago – broke through today at the end of her 10-mile (16km) journey under the Chilterns, excavating the longest tunnel on the ambitious new rail project.\n\nThe enormous 2,000 tonne Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), named ‘Florence’, is one of 10 machines excavating the 32 miles of tunnel on the new railway linking London Euston with Birmingham and was the first to launch, in May 2021.\n\nThe breakthrough is a major milestone for the HS2 project, which will almost halve journey times between Britain’s two largest cities, while freeing up space for more local services on the most crowded part of the existing West Coast Main Line.\n\nTwo identical TBMs were used to create the twin-bore Chiltern tunnel, which stretches from the South Portal near the M25 to South Heath in Buckinghamshire. Parallel tunnels will carry north and south bound trains with a second TBM, named ‘Cecilia’, due to breakthrough in the coming weeks.\n\nRail Minister Huw Merriman said:\n\n“This ground-breaking moment for HS2 demonstrates significant progress on the country’s largest infrastructure project, with ‘Florence’ paving the way for faster, greener journeys between London and Birmingham while supporting hundreds of jobs and apprenticeships along the way.\n\n“Today’s breakthrough of HS2’s longest tunnel highlights the momentum behind the project and the achievement is testament to the hard work and dedication of the 450-strong team helping deliver the line that will transform rail travel for generations to come.”\n\nDesigned specifically for the geology under the Chilterns, each TBM is an underground factory – excavating the tunnel, lining it with 56,000 pre-cast concrete segments and grouting them into place as it moves forward at an average speed of 16m per day.\n\nFour similar TBMs are being used for the London approach tunnels, while another two will work on Birmingham’s Bromford tunnel. Preparations are also underway for the launch of two more machines to excavate the Euston tunnels.\n\nThe breakthrough comes a week after HS2 published new research which shows how the impending arrival of high speed rail will drive a £10 billion economic boost for the West Midlands during the next 10 years, with a huge increase in new development around the two station sites.\n\nHS2 Ltd Executive Chairman, Sir Jon Thompson, said:\n\n“Today is an incredible day of HS2 and I’d like to thank the hundreds of people who’ve worked so hard over many years to make it happen. Once complete, HS2 will dramatically improve journeys between our two largest cities and also free up space on the existing mainline for more local trains.\n\n“We’ve still got a lot of work to do, but historic moments like today really underline the huge amount of progress that’s been made and the fantastic engineering skills we have on the project.”\n\nBoth machines launched from the South Portal and are operated by HS2’s main works contractor, Align – a joint venture formed of three international infrastructure companies: Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick. The machines are made by TBM specialists Herrenknecht, in Germany.\n\nEach TBM is operated by a crew of around 17 people, working in shifts to keep the machines running 24/7. They are supported by over 100 people on the surface, managing the logistics and maintaining the smooth progress of the tunnelling operation.\n\nIn total, more than 450 people have worked on the tunnels and in support teams on the surface over the last 3 years. This includes a dedicated team which produced 112,000 precision-engineered, fibre-reinforced concrete tunnel wall segments at a purpose build temporary factory at the South Portal who completed their work just before Christmas - and a team processing the spoil from the tunnels.\n\nAlign’s Project Director, Daniel Altier said:\n\n“The typical drive for a TBM is 5-6km and therefore the challenges in completing at 16km drive should not be underestimated.\n\n“Florence and her sister TBM Cecilia were designed in partnership with Herrenknecht. They incorporate a number of innovations and technologies that have been introduced on TBMs in the UK for the first time, to enhance performance and safety. This includes ‘semi-continuous boring’, allowing our TBMs to build the rings that line the tunnels without pausing.\n\n“The mining of the tunnel is a fantastic achievement for not only the Align tunnelling team but also the earthworks team who have managed chalk excavated from the tunnels and placed on site, along with many other supporting functions. I would also like to acknowledge our supply chain partners, including TGT that provided the teams to operate the TBMs and MS with whom we designed and operated the slurry treatment plant, with 24 filter presses it is the largest in the world.”\n\nThe 3 million cubic metres of chalk and other material removed during the tunnelling is being used to create an ambitious grassland restoration project at the south portal, which will include 127 hectares of new landscaping, wildlife habitat and biodiverse chalk grassland. The chalk, which is pumped back through the tunnel in a slurry mixed with water, is processed at a slurry treatment plant at the south portal site where the flint is removed and water extracted before it can be reused in landscaping.\n\nChalk grassland – a type of calcareous grassland - is habitat of international conservation importance mainly found on limestone and chalk valleys of south-east England and the Isle of Wight. Lime-rich, but low in nutrients, the thin soil holds little water and heats up quickly. These conditions encourage a huge variety of smaller herbs and wildflowers and over 40 species can be found in one square metre of grassland, including some of the UK’s rarest orchids and invertebrates. Only 700 hectares of chalk grassland exist across the whole of the Chilterns AONB.\n\nAt its deepest point, the tunnel is 80m beneath the Chilterns and passes under the M25, local railway lines and twice under the River Misbourne. Extensive water quality, groundwater level and surface water flow monitoring was put in place prior to the start of construction, and there has been no significant change to water quality during the tunnelling work.\n\nAlign is also delivering the record-breaking Colne Valley Viaduct which will be the longest railway bridge in the UK, with construction of the deck now over two-thirds complete.\n\nThe enormous 2,000 tonne machines are now 90% of the way through their two-and-a-half-year drive between the M25 and South Heath in Buckinghamshire to create the twin-bore tunnel.\n\nIn total, HS2 will require 64 miles of tunnelling, with five Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) already in the ground, three more ready to go and another two due to be delivered next year. Once complete, HS2 will help improve connections between London, Birmingham and the North while creating space on the most congested part of the existing West Coast Main Line.\n\nEach Chiltern TBM is a 170m long self-contained underground factory, digging the tunnel, lining it with 56,000 concrete segments to form rings and grouting them into place as it moves forward.\n\nDesigned specifically for the geology of the Chilterns, the machines were launched in Summer 2021 from a site near the M25 and have already excavated approximately 2.8 million cubic metres of chalk and flint.\n\nAs well as digging and lining the tunnels, engineers have also completed the excavation of four other shafts that will provide ventilation and emergency access near Chalfont St Peter, Chalfont St Giles, Amersham and Little Missenden with work now happening to create the internal structures and the headhouses on the surface.\n\nMark Clapp, HS2 Ltd’s Head of Delivery, said:\n\n“Once complete, HS2 will transform journeys between London and the West Midlands and free up space on the busiest part of the West Coast Main Line. We’re making great progress in the Chilterns, with 90% of the tunnel excavation now complete. That’s an incredible engineering achievement and I look forward to the breakthrough, next year.”\n\nThe 42m deep shaft near Great Missenden – which the TBM has now reached – is largely hidden behind a hedge and line of mature oak trees next to the B485.\n\nA ‘headhouse’ will be built on top of the shaft designed to resemble local farm buildings with new planting to help blend it into the surrounding landscape. The Chesham Road shaft will only be used for emergency access, while the others will also contain ventilation equipment.\n\nThe two TBMs are operated by, Align – a joint venture formed of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick.\n\nEach machine has a crew of around 15 people, working in shifts and supported by over 100 people on the surface, managing the logistics and maintaining the smooth progress of the tunnelling operation.\n\nDidier Jacques, Align’s Underground Construction Director said:\n\n\"With our first TBM Florence having reached our fifth shaft at Chesham Road and our second TBM Cecilia due to reach the shaft shortly, this a great achievement for not only the tunnelling team, but also the supporting teams on the surface at the South Portal, manufacturing the concrete segments required to line the tunnels and processing the spoil from the tunnels.\n\n\"We are looking forward to continuing the good progress with the TBMs, which are due to complete their drives early next year.”\n\nApproximately 3 million cubic metres of material – mostly chalk and flint - will be excavated during the construction of the tunnels and used for landscaping. Once construction is complete, the temporary buildings at the south portal will be removed and the site landscaped with around 90 hectares of wildlife-rich chalk grassland habitats.\n\nChalk grassland used to be widespread across the hills of southeast England and are considered habitat of international conservation significance with just 700ha left across the Chilterns.\n\nAlongside the Chiltern tunnels, two TBMs are currently excavating the London tunnels with two more due to launch soon. One TBM is excavating the Bromford tunnel in Birmingham with another ready to go. Two TBMs which will excavate the Euston tunnels are due to be delivered to site next year.\n\nOnce complete, the tunnel will carry high speed trains between London and the West Midlands at speeds of up to 200mph (320km/h) freeing up space on the busiest part of the West Coast mainline and improving journeys between Britain’s two largest cities.\n\nThe trains will travel through two parallel tunnels linked by short passages for use in emergencies. Unlike the main tunnels, which are being excavated by two giant tunnelling machines – named Florence and Cecilia – these smaller cross-passages are dug using remotely controlled mini-excavators.\n\nAn expert team of miners use the excavators to break out of the southbound running tunnel and dig the 15-20 metres to the adjacent northbound tunnel. As the excavation progresses the ground is supported using a sprayed concrete lining (SCL).\n\nOnce the team has completed the SCL lined tunnel, a water-proof membrane is installed followed by a secondary concrete lining constructed by placing concrete behind formwork installed in the cross passage.\n\nAaron Harrison, HS2 Ltd’s Project Manager, said:\n\n“We’re making great progress on the Chiltern tunnel with approaching 9 out of 10 miles complete, and our cross-passage teams are catching up fast. Once complete, HS2 will dramatically improve journeys between London and the West Midlands, unlock tens of thousands of new homes and free up space on the busiest part of the West Coast Main Line.\n\n“While invisible to the travelling public, these hidden passages have a key role in providing a safe operational railway so it’s great to see such good progress.”\n\nThe Chiltern tunnel is being delivered by HS2’s main works contractor, Align – a joint venture formed of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick – which is also responsible for the nearby Colne Valley Viaduct, which also reached the halfway point last week.\n\nDidier Jacques, Align’s Underground Construction Director, said:\n\n“I am delighted with the progress made by our cross-passage team, working in close cooperation with our supply chain partners. In particular I would like to acknowledge the contribution from KVJV who is responsible for the ground treatment, specialist contractor Euro Diamond Drilling and waterproofing specialist Renesco.”\n\nOnce the cross-passages are complete, they are temporarily sealed for fire safety reasons before permanent safety doors can be installed at either end. These are being manufactured by Bolton-based Booth Industries who won the contract to provide more than 300 units for all the tunnels between London and Birmingham.\n\nThe win allowed Booth Industries to establish a new facility in the town and create up to 50 jobs over the next 10 years. The sliding doors have been subjected to rigorous fire and fatigue testing to take account of the high train speeds, associated pressures and frequency of the trains.\n\nEach running tunnel has an emergency walkway that allows passengers to safely evacuate the train and walk through the cross passages into the other tunnel where they can be rescued on a passenger train. Access for emergency services is from either the portal or one of the five ventilation/emergency access shafts. Additional short tunnels known as ‘adits’, that connect the shafts to the running tunnels, are also under construction by the team with the mining on two of the adits already complete.\n\nFlorence and Cecilia are expected to breakthrough at the north portal early next year.\n\nThe enormous 2,000 tonne machines have spent two years excavating the twin tunnels between the M25 and South Heath in Buckinghamshire that will help improve connections between London, Birmingham and the North.\n\nEach machine is a 170m long self-contained underground factory, digging the tunnel, lining it with 56,000 concrete segments to form rings and grouting them into place as it moves forward.\n\nDesigned specifically for the geology of the Chilterns, the first TBMs were launched in Summer 2021 from a site near the M25 and have already excavated approximately 2 million cubic metres of chalk and flint.\n\nAs well as digging and lining the tunnels, engineers have also completed the excavation of five shafts that will provide ventilation and emergency access near Chalfont St Peter, Chalfont St Giles, Amersham and Little Missenden with an intervention shaft at Chesham Road.\n\nThe 35m deep shaft near Little Missenden – which the TBMs have now reached – is next to the A413 about half a mile from the Buckinghamshire village.\n\nA ‘headhouse’ will be built on top of the shaft to house ventilation and safety equipment, designed to resemble local farm buildings with new planting to help blend it into the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe news comes just weeks after planning consent was granted by Buckinghamshire Council for the North Portal of the tunnel under Schedule 17 of the HS2 Act, meaning that all major design elements now have consent.\n\nDavid Emms, HS2 Ltd’s Project Client, said:\n\n“HS2 will transform rail journeys between London the midlands and the north, and free up space on the existing network for more freight and local services. We’re seeing great progress on the tunnel, which will take our trains deep under the Chiltern hills, safeguard the woodlands and wildlife habits above and significantly reducing disruption to communities.\n\n“The huge progress that Florence and Cecilia have made would not have possible without a huge team in support - manufacturing the tunnel segments, excavating the vent shafts and I’d like to thank everyone involved.”\n\nThe two TBMs are operated by, Align – a joint venture formed of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick.\n\nEach machine has a crew of around 15 people, working in shifts and supported by over 100 people on the surface, managing the logistics and maintaining the smooth progress of the tunnelling operation.\n\nDaniel Altier, Align’s Project Director, said:\n\n“Both TBMs reaching our fourth shaft at Little Missenden is a great achievement for not only the tunnelling team and the team involved in excavating and preparing the shaft, but also the supporting teams on the surface at the South Portal, manufacturing the concrete segments required to line the tunnel and processing the spoil from the tunnels.”\n\n“In particular I would like to pay credit to Align Shafts team, working with our supply chain partners and Keltbray, who have been working over the last few months to ensure the shaft is ready for the arrival of Florence and Cecilia.”\n\nApproximately 2.7 million cubic metres of material – mostly chalk and flint - will be excavated during the construction of the tunnels and used for landscaping. Once construction is complete, the temporary buildings at the south portal will be removed and the site landscaped with around 90 hectares of wildlife-rich chalk grassland habitats.\n\nChalk grassland used to be widespread across the hills of southeast England and are considered habitat of international conservation significance with just 700ha left across the Chilterns.\n\nHS2 currently has five TBMs in the ground, with a further five due to be launched over the coming years. Together they will create 64 miles of tunnel between London and the West Midlands including major tunnels on the approach to London and Birmingham.\n\nThe geographical reach of HS2’s growing supply chain, which currently encompasses over 3,000 UK-based businesses, means people who were out of work in Wales, the North West, North East, Yorkshire and Humber and the South East are among those to have secured jobs helping to build Britain’s new railway.\n\nRail Minister Huw Merriman said:\n\n\"Helping more than 3,000 unemployed people into work is a huge achievement and it gives me great pride to see this revolutionary infrastructure project generating thousands of high-skilled jobs right across the UK.\n\n\"Not only is HS2 helping people develop new, exciting careers, but once delivered, it will transform rail journeys for generations to come by connecting our communities and offering a greener way of travelling.\"\n\nThrough partnerships with local authorities, employment support services and charities, HS2 is working collaboratively to support people who want to work but need additional support or training.\n\nDedicated HS2 Skills Academies, run in partnership with local training providers and colleges, are delivering hundreds of free training programmes to help people build new skills. In tandem, HS2’s contractors provide work trials to give prospective candidates an insight into the industry, helping them to understand the career pathways and progression opportunities.\n\nTraining programmes have so far helped candidates to launch careers in ecology, planning, CAD and Design, engineering, plant operations and support functions including finance and community engagement.\n\nNatalie Penrose, HS2’s Head of Legacy said:\n\n“We’re exceptionally proud that we’ve helped over 3,000 unemployed people in England and Wales start a new career on HS2. Whether through apprenticeships, specialist fast-track training programmes, or referrals from our partner agencies, every candidate has gained new skills and vital work experience that will put them on track for a promising future.”\n\nHS2’s construction has also played a pivotal role in helping University graduates to transition straight into careers aligned to their specialist subject areas. Over 250 students moved straight in to graduate-level roles with HS2’s construction partners after finishing their studies.\n\nAmong those to have launched a new career is 26-year-old Alisha Bhakta from Birmingham. Alisha graduated from De Montfort University Leicester with an Honours degree in English Language and Literature. She spent months trying to find a job that reflected her skillset or offered career progression opportunities.\n\nThe chance to start a work placement with Balfour Beatty VINCI (BBV), HS2’s construction partner for the West Midlands, sparked the career turnaround she was looking for. After completing her placement in 2020, Alisha immediately secured a permanent role in BBV’s document control team where she continued to impress. Now, three years on, she’s secured two promotions and transitioned into a role in information management, where she has line management responsibilities and the opportunity to expand her team.\n\nAlisha said:\n\n“I would never have considered that a career in construction might be for me, but that’s the great thing about a project of HS2’s size and scale, as there are so many opportunities.\n\n“I work with a fantastic team at BBV and my confidence has grown. Moving out of my comfort zone and into something new has really helped me, and my career, to progress.”\n\nPaul-Kelly Blazquez (PK) from Birmingham is also climbing the career ladder at BBV. After struggling to find work, he seized the opportunity to join BBV on a four-week work placement and hasn’t looked back.\n\nPK was initially referred to BBV by Remploy, a local charity that supports people with disabilities and matches them to companies that can support their needs. Over the last five years, his career at BBV has flourished. PK completed a two-year business administration apprenticeship, was promoted into a new role in IT, and now leads his own team who are tasked with ensuring that all BBV’s online applications run smoothly.\n\nPK said:\n\n“I’ve received so much support from the team at BBV. They have helped me to develop a career doing what I love and working in IT.\n\n“I’ve progressed from being a trainee, to an apprentice, right up to being a team leader, and now I get to support our new apprentices on their career journey.”\n\nHS2's construction partner Align JV is also helping unemployed people to launch new careers. As a Covid Graduate, Queenie Villarente had been struggling to find a role that suited her studies in Engineering. After many unsuccessful applications, she secured a space on Align's pre-employment programme at the end of 2020. The programme specifically supported women who were looking to start a career in Construction, and Queenie was introduced to a resourcing manager who helped her to secure a position working on HS2 as a Plant Clerk.\n\nSince joining Align, Queenie’s career has developed rapidly. She is now operating as a TBM (Tunnel Boring Machine) Control Room and Data Engineer.\n\nQueenie, from Hillingdon said:\n\n“My experience at Align so far has been amazing. The environment in which I work is definitely a good place for growth and development. It’s a place where my voice and opinion matters, with every day offering new challenges and opportunities. I work as part of a team which is very united, working together to achieve our goals. I am very happy to be part of what is a fantastic project.”\n\nFor more information about careers and opportunities on HS2, visit hs2.org.uk/careers\n\nOne year after the launch of HS2’s giant ‘bridge-building machine’, progress on the UK’s longest railway bridge has taken another major step forward with the completion of the first piers that will carry the viaduct over a series of lakes just outside London.\n\nThe Colne Valley Viaduct – which is being built near Hillingdon - will carry high speed trains more than two miles (3.4km) across the Grand Union Canal, River Colne, local roads and a series of lakes between the end of the London tunnels and the start of the Chiltern tunnels.\n\nFor the last year, a 700-tonne ‘launch girder’ – the only one of its kind in the UK - has been assembling giant pre-cast concrete segments to form the first 1 km of the viaduct deck along the edge of the valley.\n\nNow the first enormous v-shaped piers have been completed in the lake, to allow the viaduct to curve eastward, over the water. The ‘V piers’ – each weighing in at 1,800 tonnes – will support a row of elegant arches inspired by the flight of a stone skimming over the surface of the water.\n\nTo allow for the gentle curve of the viaduct, each of the one thousand segments that form the arches and deck are slightly different – and all are manufactured at a temporary factory set up close by, with direct access to the M25.\n\nConstruction of the HS2 project, which is designed to improve rail links between London, Birmingham and the North, help level-up the economy and provide a low carbon alternative to car and air travel, is ramping up across the UK with almost 30,000 jobs now supported by the project.\n\nWelcoming the milestone, HS2 Ltd Project Client David Emms said:\n\n“The Colne Valley Viaduct will form a key part of the HS2 route – helping to deliver better connections across the UK, free up rail capacity on the existing network, and offer passengers zero carbon travel options. That’s why it’s great to see so much progress over the last 12 months and especially the completion of the piers that will allow the girder to head out over the lakes later this year.\n\n“I’d like to thank all those involved in getting us to this exciting stage and look forward to seeing the whole viaduct come together over the coming years.”\n\nKnown as a ‘launching girder’, the 160m long bridge-building machine is used to lift the giant concrete deck segments that form the viaduct’s arches into position. Once each section is complete, the machine inches itself forward to build the next stage.\n\nThe huge viaduct project is being led by HS2’s main works contractor Align JV – a team made up of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine and VolkerFitzpatrick working with key suppliers including VSL, Kilnbridge, Tarmac and KVJV.\n\nOriginally built in 2004, the launching girder was first used during the construction of the Hong Kong East Tsing Yi Viaduct. Specially designed to handle complex viaduct construction, the machine is named ‘Dominique’ in memory of Bouygues engineer Dominique Droniou who played a leading role in its design and development.\n\nIn the last year, it has installed over 300 out of 1,000 segments required to complete the viaduct deck, installing up to three pairs of segments each day\n\nAlign Project Director, Daniel Altier commented:\n\n“I am delighted that by working as an integrated team with our supply chain partners, we have been able to erect nearly a third of the deck and complete the first V pier, just a year since Dominique starting operating.\n\nWhat has been achieved would not have been possible without the support of the different teams across the project including; Quality, Lifting, Safety, Consents, Environment, Surveying and also Earthworks, for maintaining the haul road on which the 60 -140 tonne segments are transported from our factory to meet the girder.”\n\nDesigned to bear the weight of the 80m wide arches over the lakes, the ‘v-piers’ are twice as large as simpler piers that carry the viaduct over land.\n\nCast in place using a series of giant moulds, each pier has a separate tower crane, with a temporary access bridge linking them with the main construction site. Cofferdams were used to hold back the water while the 60m deep foundations were built into the bed of the lakes.\n\nEach pier weighs around 1,800 tonnes and took nine months to complete. To help the engineers master the complex shape of the pier, a mock-up was built off site before work began on the real piers. In total, 11 ‘v-piers’ will support the viaduct over water with a further 45 piers on land.\n\nOnce the piers are ready, deck segments will be placed alternately on each side, using a cantilever approach to balance the structure, as two half-arches are constructed simultaneously. Steel tensioning cables are then threaded through the segments to strengthen the bridge\n\nHidden low into the landscape between Great Missenden and South Heath in Buckinghamshire, the North Portal will only be partially visible from a footbridge over the railway to the north.Once construction is complete, the seven ‘Key Design Elements’ will be the only parts of the tunnel visible to the local community.\n\nAlongside the North Portal, which will be near South Heath in Buckinghamshire, they include the South Portal, near the M25, and headhouses above the ventilation and emergency access shafts, which are mostly designed to resemble agricultural buildings.\n\nThe design work has been completed by HS2’s main works contractor, Align JV – a team made up of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick, working with its design partners Jacobs, Rendel-Ingerop and LDA Design, and its architect Grimshaw.\n\nConstruction of the twin tunnels, which will stretch for 10 miles under the Chiltern hills, recently passed the halfway point, with two giant tunnelling machines currently between Amersham and Little Missenden.\n\nToday’s reveal of the last of the Key Design Elements for the tunnel represent a double milestone for Align who are also responsible for the Colne Valley Viaduct, meaning that they have completed their entire Detailed Design including designs for all of the Key Design Elements.\n\nHS2 Ltd’s Design Director Kay Hughes said:\n\n“HS2 will provide zero-carbon journeys across the UK, improving links between London, Birmingham and the North, while freeing up space for more freight and local services on the existing main line.\n\n“The Chiltern Tunnel North Portal will be one of the least visible parts of the project, but today’s reveal of the final designs is a major symbolic milestone – and I’d like to congratulate Align on getting all their Key Design Elements to this final stage of development.”\n\nHidden low into the landscape between Great Missenden and South Heath in Buckinghamshire, the North Portal will only be partially visible from a footbridge over the railway to the north.\n\nTwo perforated concrete hoods will cover the track, extending the tunnel into the open air. These ‘porous portals’ will avoid sudden changes in air pressure – and resulting noise – caused by trains entering and exiting the tunnels.\n\nAlongside the portals, there will also be a simple single-storey ancillary building to house mechanical and electrical equipment which will be clad in earth-coloured pigmented zinc. Following feedback from the community, this building has been reduced in size and will now feature a green roof to help further blend the infrastructure into the landscape.\n\nThe headhouses about the ventilation and emergency access shafts at Chalfont St Peter, Chalfont St Giles, Amersham, Little Missenden and Chesham Road are also designed to blend into the landscape, with many echoing the look of local barns and other of agricultural buildings.\n\nAlign’s Technical Director, Alan Price said:\n\n“This is a significant achievement for both Align and our design partners in Align D, that is led by Jacobs and Ingerop-Rendel. Having the design on the shelf releases procurement and allows complete flexibility to optimise the construction programme.”\n\nTo the north of the tunnel, the new high speed line will be set into a cutting for 1.8 miles (3km) on its approach to the Wendover Dean Viaduct, with more than 20 hectares of new woodland, shrubs and wildflowers planted to help blend the railway into the surrounding countryside. The species chosen will be typical to the Chilterns including Beech, Oak, Yew, Holly and Dog Rose.\n\nEach machine is a 170m long self-contained underground factory, digging the tunnel, lining it with 56,000 concrete segments to form rings and grouting them into place as it moves forward.\n\nDesigned specifically for the geology of the Chilterns, the first TBMs were launched in Summer 2021 from a site near the M25 and have excavated more than 1.8 million cubic metres of chalk and flint.\n\nAs well as digging and lining the tunnels, engineers have also completed the excavation of five shafts that will provide ventilation and emergency access near Chalfont St Peter, Chalfont St Giles, Amersham, Little Missenden and an intervention shaft at Chesham Road.\n\nThe 44m deep shaft at Amersham – which the TBMs have now passed - will be in the middle of a road junction just outside the Buckinghamshire town. A ‘headhouse’ will be built on top of the shaft to house safety equipment, with a flint-faced boundary wall and a pre-patinated zinc roof to help match the natural tones of the surrounding landscape.\n\nOnce complete, trains will pass through the tunnel at speeds of up to 320km/h, providing zero carbon journeys between London, Birmingham and the north while freeing up capacity on the existing rail network.\n\nMartyn Noak, HS2 Ltd’s Head of Tunnel Engineering, said:\n\n“The Chiltern tunnel will take HS2 underground and safeguard the woodlands and wildlife habits above the tunnel as well as significantly reducing disruption to communities during construction and operation of the new railway.\n\n“I’ve been very impressed with the progress made by Florence and Cecilia as they make their way unseen beneath the Chiltern Hills. It’s great to see how much progress they and the teams excavating the five shafts have made and I’d like to thank everyone involved in getting us this far.”\n\nThe two TBMs are operated by, Align – a joint venture formed of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick.\n\nEach machine has a crew of 17 people, working in shifts and supported by over 100 people on the surface, managing the logistics and maintaining the smooth progress of the tunnelling operation.\n\nCoralie Peroux, Tunnel Manager, Align\n\n‘Florence and Cecilia reaching our third shaft at Amersham is a great achievement for not only the tunnelling team and the team involved in excavating and preparing the shaft, but also the supporting teams on the surface at the South Portal, manufacturing the concrete segments required to line the tunnel and processing the spoil from the tunnels.”\n\n“In particular I would like to pay credit to Steve Meecham and our Align Shafts team, working with our supply chain partners KVJV and Keltbray, who have been working tirelessly over the last few months to ensure the shaft is ready for the arrival of Florence and Cecilia.”\n\nApproximately 2.7 million cubic metres of material – mostly chalk and flint - will be excavated during the construction of the tunnels and used for landscaping. Once construction is complete, the temporary buildings at the south portal will be removed and the site landscaped with around 90 hectares of new wildlife-rich chalk grassland habitats.\n\nChalk grassland used to be widespread across the hills of southeast England and are considered habitat of international conservation significance with just 700ha left across the Chilterns.\n\nHS2 currently has five TBMs in the ground, with a further five due to be launched over the coming years. Together they will create 64 miles of tunnel between London and the West Midlands including major tunnels on the approach to London and Birmingham.\n\nHS2 Ltd today confirmed that ‘Florence’ and ‘Cecilia’, the two giant tunnelling machines excavating the high speed rail project’s longest tunnels, have passed the halfway point on their 10 mile journey under the Chilterns.\n\nThe enormous 2,000 tonne machines have spent the last 18 months excavating the twin tunnels between the M25 and South Heath in Buckinghamshire that will help protect the environment while improving connections between London, Birmingham and the North.\n\nAs well as digging and lining the tunnels, engineers have also completed the excavation of five shafts that will provide ventilation and emergency access near Chalfont St Peter, Chalfont St Giles, Amersham, Little Missenden and Chesham Road. They also recently completed the first breakthrough from a cross passageway to the shaft at Chalfont St Peter.\n\nMore than 1.3 million cubic metres of chalk and flint – enough to fill more than 500 Olympic swimming pools - has been excavated and will be used as part of an ambitious chalk grassland restoration project at the south portal of the tunnel. This will see the creation of 127 hectares of new landscaping, wildlife habitat and biodiverse chalk grassland.\n\nOnce complete, the Chiltern tunnels will carry high speed trains between London and the North at speeds of up to 200mph (320km/h), helping to improve connections, free up space for more freight and local trains on the existing railway and provide zero carbon journeys for people across the UK.\n\nMartyn Noak, HS2 Ltd’s Head of Tunnel Engineering, said:\n\n“It’s great to be able to celebrate the half-way point of this 10-mile long tunnel. The whole team has put in a fantastic effort over the last year-and-a-half and I’d like to congratulate the crews of both Florence and Cecilia for passing this important tunnelling milestone and thank them for all their hard work”\n\n“This tunnel will take HS2 underneath the Chiltern hills, safeguarding the woodlands and wildlife habits above ground as well as significantly reducing disruption to communities during construction and operation. Once complete, HS2 will offer low carbon journey options linking London with the major cities of the north and releasing capacity for more freight and local trains on our existing mainlines.”\n\nHS2’s main works contractor, Align – a joint venture formed of three international infrastructure companies: Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick is responsible for the Chiltern tunnel and nearby Colne Valley Viaduct.\n\nDidier Jacques, Align's Underground Construction Director, said:\n\n“Florence and Cecilia passing the half-way point on what is a long drive for the TBMs, is a great achievement. I would like to pay credit to TGT, our supply chain partner, whose personnel are manning the TBMs.\n\nThis significant progress would not have been possible without the supporting teams on the surface at the South Portal, who supply the thousands of 8.5 tonne segments required to line the tunnels, process the spoil pumped back as slurry through our slurry treatment plant and landscape the chalk produced across the site. Overall, a great team effort.’\n\nDesigned specifically for the mix of chalk and flints under the Chilterns, the two identical TBMs are excavating separate tunnels for north and southbound trains. The excavated material is mixed with water to form a slurry, before being pumped back to the surface.\n\nEach machine operates as a self-contained underground factory - digging the tunnel, lining it with concrete wall segments and grouting them into place at a speed of around 15 meters a day. More than 56,000 precision-engineered, fibre-reinforced segments have been installed to create the walls of the tunnels – with each one made on site in a dedicated temporary pre-cast factory.\n\nA crew of 17 people operate each TBM, working in shifts to keep the machines running 24/7. They are supported by over 100 people on the surface, managing the logistics and maintaining the smooth progress of the tunnelling operation.\n\nAs well as the Chiltern tunnels, HS2 also recently launched two TBMs to begin the project’s London tunnels and celebrated the first breakthrough with the completion of the first of two tunnels under Long Itchington Wood in Warwickshire.\n\nOnce complete, the 2.1 miles (3.4km) bridge will carry the new high-speed rail line across a series of lakes and waterways near Hillingdon on the north-west outskirts of London.\n\nThe construction of the foundations, the 56 huge piers and the deck on top, have all been happening in parallel – with separate teams working from north to south. Deck assembly began last year, with more than 500 meters of the viaduct structure now complete.\n\nIn order to deliver the 66 piles in the lakebed, the team first had to construct over a kilometer of temporary jetties, with cofferdams to hold back the water around each set of foundations. The jetties are also used to transport materials and equipment during the construction of the piers and viaduct deck, keeping vehicles off local roads.\n\nConstruction of the HS2 project - which is designed to improve rail links between London, Birmingham and North, help level-up the economy and provide a low carbon alternative to car and air travel - is ramping up across the UK with almost 30,000 jobs now supported by the project.\n\nHS2 Ltd’s Project Client, David Emms said:\n\n“Once complete, HS2 will transform journeys across the UK, help to boost the economy and support the UK’s transition to net zero.\n\n“The completion of the piling for the Colne Valley Viaduct is a major achievement for our whole team and marks the end of almost two years of hard work. With pier construction and deck assembly also well underway, the viaduct is fast becoming one of the most impressive and recognisable parts of the project.”\n\nThe viaduct is being built by HS2 Ltd’s main works contractor Align JV – a team made up of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick, working with its contractor KVJV– who spent almost two years on the piling. KVJV is a team made up of Keller Group and VSL International.\n\nOn top of each group of piles – some of which are to a depth of 60m into the ground - a concrete pile cap will support the pier which will in turn support the weight of the bridge structure above. Instead of hammering the piles into the ground, holes were bored before being backfilled to create the piles.\n\nThe main deck of the viaduct is being built in 1,000 separate segments at a temporary factory nearby and assembled using a bridge-building machine which lifts each piece into position before shifting itself forward to the next pier.\n\nAlign’s Surface Operations Director, Derek van Rensburg said:\n\n“Completing the piling is a great achievement for both Align and the team at KVJV, working over the lakes and waterways across the Colne Valley. We were able to complete the piling with no significant impact on the environment, a great result for the whole team.”\n\nSet low into the landscape, the widest spans reserved for where the viaduct crosses the lakes, and narrower spans for the approaches. This design was chosen to enable views across the landscape, minimise the viaduct’s footprint on the lakes and help complement the natural surroundings.\n\nThe design was inspired by the flight of a stone skipping across the water, with a series of elegant spans, some up to 80m long, carrying the railway around 10m above the surface of the lakes, River Colne and Grand Union Canal.\n\nHS2 worked closely with Affinity Water and the Environment Agency to monitor water quality and agree working methods. These were monitored by a team of specialist engineers during construction in order to protect the natural environment.\n\nBefore work began, an extensive programme of test piling was completed with engineers sinking 12 piles at two locations with geological and structural data from these tests fed back into the design of the viaduct. This resulted in a 10-15% reduction in the depth of the piles and associated time and cost savings.\n\nThe total number of new starters has reached 1,126, putting the company building Britain’s new railway on track to smash its target of creating 2,000 apprenticeships.\n\nIn September 2020 when construction began on the first phase of the project, linking the capital and the West Midlands, HS2 forecast that it would create 22,000 jobs in the coming years. Its skilled workforce has now reached nearly 30,000, with thousands more jobs supported across the country in the wider supply chain.\n\nWith three further phases of HS2’s construction in the pipeline, extending the new zero carbon railway to Crewe, Manchester and the East Midlands will provide a further boost to the UK’s economy and the Government’s levelling up agenda, years before the first trains run.\n\nRail Minister Huw Merriman said:\n\n“HS2’s benefits clearly go far beyond improving connectivity and this is another great example of how it is changing lives across the country.”\n\n“The apprenticeship programme is an incredible opportunity for people starting their career, giving them the chance to work on the biggest infrastructure project in Europe while ensuring this pioneering project is being spearheaded by the very best new talent.”\n\nThe demand for HS2 apprenticeships has grown exponentially since the pandemic, with 715 new starters recorded since March 2020. The vast range of courses on offer, at intermediate to degree level, is proving attractive to career movers and college leavers seeking to specialise in roles from carpentry and cyber security to tunnelling operatives and environmental technicians.\n\nMark Thurston, CEO of HS2 Ltd, who began his career as an apprentice said:\n\n“It’s great news that we’ve passed the halfway mark and are well on our way to achieve our target of 2,000 apprenticeships at HS2. Creating early career opportunities and investing in the development of a skilled workforce delivers both immediate and long-term benefits to the UK economy, as well as giving us the opportunity to become a world-leader in high speed rail.\n\n“Every person at the heart of that investment is helping to transform our railways and make city to city travel cleaner, greener and more reliable for future generations. There’s a great sense of pride about what we’re achieving at HS2, including the legacy that we're creating.”\n\nThe ability to earn, learn and gain nationally recognised qualifications adds to the appeal of an apprenticeship and is what attracted HS2’s 1,000th apprentice, Jessica Miles, to start a new career.\n\n30-year-old Jessica from Cockfosters, North London, worked in retail fashion for six years and climbed the ladder to management level. She had always been interested in a career in Human Resources but found it difficult to secure a job without the relevant qualifications or industry experience.\n\nIn 2022, Jessica joined HS2’s construction partner Align joint venture on a two-year Level 5 HR Consultant apprenticeship, where she combines work with study at West Herts College. It was the new start she was looking for, and the move has put her on track to secure the CIPD qualifications and work experience needed to build a long term career in the sector.\n\nJessica said:\n\n“It just goes to show that it’s never too late to follow your dreams. I was 30 when I started my apprenticeship, but my college education meant I was able to begin studying at Level 5, so I’m on track to gain a fantastic qualification that will really boost my career.\n\n“I’m working on the biggest infrastructure project in Europe, helping to recruit a talented workforce to deliver the amazing construction challenges I see in front of me every day. I’m not just building my career, but helping thousands of others too, and we’re all working together to deliver this once in a lifetime project. It’s amazing!”\n\nEvery year, HS2 and its construction partners invest in bringing more apprentices into the business. Career pathways are now supported in over 40 different apprenticeship types, with education and training provided by colleges and universities across the country.\n\nInvesting in skills, employment and education is one of seven strategic objectives set out by HS2 to ensure the project leaves a lasting skills legacy. Through initiatives set out in its Skills, Employment and Education Strategy, HS2 is making great progress in its bid to upskill and create careers, not just jobs, for the thousands of people already on board.\n\nConstruction of the HS2 project, which is designed to improve rail links between London, Birmingham and the North, help level-up the economy and provide a low carbon alternative to car and air travel, is ramping up across the UK with almost 30,000 jobs now supported by the project.\n\nRail Minister Huw Merriman said:\n\n“This is an extraordinary feat of engineering and architecture, designed to enable spectacular views across a beautiful part of our British countryside which is being preserved and protected by this project.\n\n“It was incredible to be the first person to officially walk on top of it today – another milestone for this monumental project which will transform journeys for people up and down the country, creating almost 30,000 jobs and providing a low carbon alternative to cars for decades to come.”\n\nKnown as a ‘launching girder’, the 160m long bridge-building machine is the only one of its kind operating in the UK and is used to lift the giant concrete deck segments that form the viaduct’s arches into position. Once each section is complete, the machine inches itself forward to build the next stage.\n\nThe first 141 - out of a thousand - deck segments are now in position, with each one weighing up to 140 tonnes. To allow for the gentle curves of the viaduct as it crosses the valley, all the segments are slightly different shapes and made on site at a purpose-built temporary factory close to the north abutment.\n\nWelcoming the milestone, HS2 Ltd Project Client David Emms said:\n\n“After seven months of hard work, it’s great to be able to finally be able to walk on part of the Colne Valley Viaduct. Once complete, this record-breaking structure will form a key part of the HS2 route – helping to deliver better connections across the UK, free up rail capacity on the existing train network, and offer passengers zero carbon travel options.\n\n“I’d like to thank all those involved in getting us to this exciting stage and look forward to seeing the whole viaduct come together over the coming years.”\n\nThe huge viaduct project is being led by HS2’s main works contractor Align JV – a team made up of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine and VolkerFitzpatrick.\n\nOriginally built in 2004, the launching girder was first used during the construction of the Hong Kong East Tsing Yi Viaduct. Specially designed to handle complex viaduct construction, the machine is named ‘Dominique’ in memory of Bouygues engineer Dominique Droniou who played a leading role in its design and development.\n\nAlign Project Director, Daniel Altier, said:\n\n“The team at Align, along with supply-chain partners VSL, Kilnbridge, KVJV, VolkerStevin, Tarmac, Sendin andVaughan Plant Haulage, have worked incredibly hard to get us to this point. They have demonstrated exceptional teamwork and expertise and I’m incredibly proud of what they have achieved so far. In particular, the successful completion of the A412 crossing which involved collaboration with multiple stakeholders to minimise disruption to our local community.”\n\n56 piers each weighing around 370 tonnes are being constructed along the Colne Valley ahead of the girder, with the machine moving from one pier to the next, installing the deck segments as it goes.\n\nSegments are placed alternately on each side of the pier, using a cantilever approach to balance the structure, as two half-arches are constructed simultaneously. Steel tensioning cables are then threaded through the segments to strengthen the bridge.\n\nThe viaduct pre-cast factory where the one thousand segments are made uses a ‘match-casting’ technique. This approach - where each segment is poured against the previous one - will ensure the whole deck fits perfectly when assembled on the piers. Up to 12 segments a week can be cast at the mammoth 100m long factory, which has an internal volume of 105,000 cubic metres – making it larger than the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nOnce construction is complete, the factory and surrounding buildings will be removed and the whole area between the viaduct and the Chiltern tunnel will be transformed into an area of chalk grassland and woodland as part of HS2’s ‘green corridor’ project.\n\nThe design of the Colne Valley Viaduct was inspired by the flight of a stone skipping across the water, with a series of elegant spans, some up to 80m long, carrying the railway around 10m above the surface of the lakes, River Colne and Grand Union Canal.\n\nSet low into the landscape, wider spans will carry the viaduct crosses the lakes, with narrower spans for the approaches. This design was chosen to enable views across the landscape, minimise the viaduct’s footprint on the lakes and help complement views across the natural surroundings.\n\nIn the next step on its journey towards fully diesel-free construction sites by 2029, HS2 has announced that 10 sites are now diesel-free, smashing the project’s original target of one diesel-free site in 2022.\n\nEarlier this year, the Canterbury Road Vent Shaft in South Kilburn, managed by Skanska Costain STRABAG joint venture (SCS JV), became HS2’s first diesel-free site. Also managed by SCS, the Euston Approaches and Victoria Road Crossover Box sites have achieved diesel-free status.\n\nAlign – a joint venture formed of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick, have also announced that seven of their 14 sites are now diesel-free. These include five vent shaft sites along the route of the 10 mile Chiltern tunnels in Buckinghamshire, and two sites involved in the construction of the Colne Valley Viaduct.\n\nTransport Minister Huw Merriman said:\n\n“HS2 will help to transform the future of construction, decarbonise transport and help us deliver Net Zero, and leave as little trace as possible by planting millions of trees and creating innovative, low-carbon solutions for removing waste from construction sites.\n\n“This is yet another important milestone in the journey towards diesel-free construction, as HS2 ensures this project has a minimal impact on the environment and local communities while transforming journeys for decades to come.”\n\nTo explain how the project will continue on its journey to achieve 100% diesel-free construction sites by 2029, HS2 has published its ‘Diesel-free Plan: Building a net zero future’. It details HS2's journey to diesel-free construction sites and a new ratings system which ranks all sites from diamond to bronze, so progress can be mapped over the next few years.\n\nAndrea Davidson, HS2 Ltd’s Head of Environmental Sciences said:\n\n“Our ambitious goal is to eliminate diesel on all HS2 construction sites by 2029. One of the first targets in our Net Zero Carbon Plan was to achieve one diesel-free site during 2022, so we’re thrilled to see ten sites already reaching this major milestone supported through the hard work from our on-site teams.\n\n“Our ‘Diesel-free Plan: Building a net zero future’ explains how we will reach our goal by improving efficiencies, switching to cleaner fuels, using renewable power such as solar, using the latest cleanest and fully-electric machinery, and continuing to collaborate with the wider industry to set new standards and push the boundaries of green innovation.”\n\nAfter achieving the first diesel-free site on the HS2 project in May, SCS JV aim to be fully diesel-free by the end of 2023 using a combination of mains electricity, fully electric machines, renewable energy and biofuels.\n\nTheir first site - Canterbury Road Vent Shaft in South Kilburn, is connected to mains electricity on a 100% renewable energy tariff. This powers one of the UK’s first 160 tonne emissions-free fully electric crawler crane, as well as other electric plant such as electric compressors, with the rest of the machinery using sustainably sourced biofuels (HVO) as a direct replacement for diesel.\n\nAt HS2’s Euston Approaches, also managed by SCS JV, the world’s first all-electric, high-capacity BAUER drilling rig cuts 1,200kg of CO2 per day and reduces noise by 50%, bringing massive environmental benefits and adding momentum to HS2’s ambition to cut carbon and reduce impacts to surrounding residents.\n\nIn addition, one of the tower cranes in the Euston Area has been fitted with the PUNCH Flybrid ‘flywheel’ energy recovery system, which stores and kinetic energy to use when needed to downscale peak energy demand and therefore cut energy consumption. This technology recently won the award for the Carbon Net Zero Initiative of the Year and the overall Initiative of the Year Awards at the British Construction Industry Awards.\n\nSCS’s third diesel-free site, Victoria Road Crossover Box has a mains electricity connection, is deploying electric equipment and making use of sustainably sourced biofuels (HVO). The site recently successfully completed trials for two GeoPura 250kVA hydrogen power units (HPUs) – cutting carbon and improving air quality for workers and the local community.\n\nJames Richardson, Managing Director of SCS JV said:\n\n“We are proud to be pioneers of diesel-free construction, and we are committed to seeking out and adopting new technology and ways of working to eliminate diesel on construction sites. This all starts with a shift in mindset and a belief that our industry can have a cleaner, greener future.\"\n\nAs well as seven of Align’s 14 sites becoming diesel-free, their 136 acres (80 football pitches) Chiltern Tunnels South Portal, HS2’s largest construction site, is also well on its way to becoming 100% diesel-free next year. On the site, over 120 pieces of plant including dumpers, tractors, excavators, pumps and crushers are all operating using sustainably sourced biofuels (HVO).\n\nIn addition, there’s a range of fully electric plant such as telehandlers and excavators, renewable energy sources such as solar, and site safety gates powered by hydrogen, all reducing carbon impacts and improving local air quality.\n\nAdetunji Lawal, Align JV’s Carbon and Energy Manager said:\n\n“Our strategy is to move to diesel-free operations across all of our construction sites, so we’re thrilled to say that half of our sites are now diesel-free. In addition, on our extensive Chiltern Tunnel South Portal site, all of the earthworks activities that represent 70% of our fuel consumption are now 100% diesel free. We estimate that Align will be able to deliver carbon savings that equate to 80,000 tonnes by the end of the project, supporting HS2’s zero carbon ambitions.”\n\nHS2’s ‘Diesel-free Plan: net zero future’ explains how the project will achieve 100% diesel-free construction sites by 2029, and details a new ratings system which ranks all sites from diamond to bronze, so progress can be mapped over the next few years. Progress will be reported in the Environmental and Sustainability Progress Reports in future years.\n\nIt highlights that by the end of 2022, all joint ventures working on the HS2 Main Work Civils will have a plan in place to accelerate their own diesel-free ambitions. Through 2023, HS2 will continue to facilitate green innovation trials on its sites, aiming to achieve additional diesel-free sites. Between 2024 and 2029, HS2 will continue to work with the industry to pioneer cleaner and greener ways of working, unblock challenges and increase the use of reliable, proven diesel-free alternatives.\n\nTwo enormous 2,000 tonne tunnelling machines digging HS2’s longest tunnels passed the second of five ventilation shafts this week, 4 miles into their 10 mile drive under the Chilterns.\n\nThe milestone comes a week after the launch of another giant TBM in Ruislip which begin excavating the London tunnels for the high speed rail project linking the capital with the Midlands and the North.\n\nDesigned specifically for the geology of the Chilterns, the first TBMs – named Florence and Cecilia – were launched in Summer 2021 from the southern portal of the tunnels.\n\nEach machine is a 170m long self-contained underground factory, digging the tunnel, lining it with concrete segments to form rings and grouting them into place as it moves forward.\n\nMore than 44,000 segments have been used to form the concrete rings that line the tunnels, with a further 68,000 set to be installed before the TBMs break out at the northern end of the tunnel in two years’ time.\n\nThe 46m deep shaft at Chalfont St Giles is one of four that will provide ventilation and emergency access to the ten-mile-long twin tunnels. A fifth will just provide emergency access. Once complete, the shaft will be covered by a headhouse designed to resemble local farm buildings.\n\nMore than 27,000 jobs are already being supported by HS2, which is designed to transform transport links between Britain’s major cities, free up space on the rail network for more freight and local services and support the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.\n\nMartyn Noak, HS2 Ltd’s Head of Tunnel Engineering, said:\n\n“The Chiltern tunnel will take HS2 underneath the hills and safeguard the woodlands and wildlife habits above ground as well as significantly reducing disruption to communities during construction and operation of the new railway.\n\n“It’s great to see how much progress has been made by Florence and Cecilia – and the teams excavating the five shafts – and I’d like to thank everyone involved in getting us this far.”\n\nThese first two TBMs on the HS2 project are operated by, Align – a joint venture formed of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick.\n\nEach machine has a crew of 17 people, working in shifts and supported by over 100 people on the surface, managing the logistics and maintaining the smooth progress of the tunnelling operation.\n\nDidier Jacques, Align’s Underground Construction Director, said:\n\n“Florence and Cecilia reaching our second shaft at Chalfont St Giles is a great achievement for the tunnelling team and I would like to pay credit to TGT, our supply chain partner, whose personnel are manning the TBMs.\n\nIt’s also important to acknowledge the work by the construction team involved in excavating and preparing the shaft. In particular I would like to pay credit to KVJV, VolkerLaser and Keltbray our supply chain partners, who have been working tirelessly over the last few months to ensure the shaft is ready for the arrival of Florence and Cecilia, learning from their experience of excavating and preparing our first shaft at Chalfont St Peter.”\n\nEach of the separate northbound and southbound tunnels will require 56,000 precision engineered, fibre-reinforced concrete segments – which are all being made in purpose build factories on site at the south portal, located just inside the M25.\n\nApproximately 2.7 million cubic metres of material – mostly chalk and flint - will be excavated during the construction of the tunnels and used for landscaping. So far more than 1m cubic metres have been placed on site. Once construction is complete, the temporary buildings at the south portal will be removed and the site landscaped with around 90 hectares of wildlife-rich chalk grassland habitats.\n\nChalk grassland used to be widespread across the hills of south east England and are considered habitat of international conservation significance with just 700ha left across the Chilterns.\n\nIn total there will be ten TBMs on the HS2 project - working to create 64 miles of tunnel between London and the West Midlands including major tunnels on the approach to London and Birmingham.\n\nThe transformation of HS2’s largest construction site into a haven for wildlife reached a major milestone this week with the millionth cubic metre of chalk laid out around the south portal of the Chiltern tunnel.\n\nThe ambitious environmental project will eventually see 2.6 million cubic metres of chalk excavated during the construction of the 10 mile long tunnels used to create one of the largest areas of chalk grassland in the Chiltern hills.\n\nInstead of removing the material by road, it is being used to landscape the site as part of plans to create 127 hectares of new chalk grassland, woodland, wood pasture and wetland habitats.\n\nWelcoming the news, HS2 Ltd’s Environment Director Peter Miller said:\n\n“The south portal project is one of the most important parts of our Green Corridor programme to establish better connected, sustainable and biodiverse landscapes along the route of the new railway and will contribute substantially to HS2’s carbon reduction target.\n\n“It’s great to see how much chalk has already been laid on site and I look forward to seeing the site completely transform over the coming years.”\n\nChalk grassland – a type of calcareous grassland - is habitat of international conservation importance mainly found on limestone and chalk downlands of south-east England and the Isle of Wight.\n\nLime-rich, but low in nutrients, the thin soil holds little water and drains well. These conditions encourage a huge variety of smaller herbs and wildflowers and over 40 plant species can be found in one square metre of grassland, including some of the UK’s rarest orchids as well as highly diverse invertebrate populations. Only 700 hectares of chalk grassland exist across the whole of the Chilterns AONB.\n\nThe plans have been developed by HS2’s main works contractor, Align – a joint venture formed of three international infrastructure companies: Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick – working with its design partners Jacobs, Rendel-Ingerop, and LDA Design, that form Align D.\n\nChris Chantler, Align D, Design Director\n\n“This innovative, multi-discipline project is providing a unique opportunity to create a huge expanse of new grassland using chalk being excavated from the Chiltern tunnels.\n\nWith the first million cubic metres of chalk having already been placed to create the grassland, we are well on the way to creating a landscape which will be both rich in diversity and a place for people to explore and connect with the natural environment.”\n\nTwo giant tunnelling machines – named Florence and Cecilia – are currently around 4 miles into their journey under the Chilterns. The material they excavate is mixed with water to form a slurry before being pumped out of the tunnel.\n\nIt is then processed at a slurry treatment plant at the south portal site where the flint is removed and water extracted, to leave chalk cake which is then carefully laid out on site – together with recycled concrete and aggregates from construction works - in order to create a naturalistic landscape with all the temporary construction buildings removed.\n\nNinety hectares of chalk grassland will be seeded into re-profiled soil layers. This will sit alongside new areas of woodland, wood pasture and wetlands, including almost 65,000 trees and shrubs of 32 species and nearly 3.5km of new hedgerows.\n\nAround 4.5km of new footpath, cycling and horse-riding routes will give the public areas to large parts of the site, which sits between the Colne Valley Regional Park and the Chilterns AONB.\n\nField trials are in preparation ahead of final seeding, and planting of trees and shrubs in 2025.\n\nThe construction of HS2’s longest tunnels stretching for 10 miles under the Chilterns has begun a new phase with the start of work on thirty-eight cross passages linking the northbound and southbound tunnels.\n\nThe Chiltern tunnels will carry high speed trains between London and the North at speeds of up to 200mph (320km/h). The trains will travel through two parallel tunnels linked by short passages for use in emergencies.\n\nWith the two giant tunnelling machines – named Florence and Cecilia – now almost four miles into their journeys, attention has turned to the first cross passages.\n\nAn expert team of miners used a remotely controlled excavator to break out of and excavate from one running tunnel to the adjacent tunnel. As the excavation is progressed the ground is supported using a sprayed concrete lining (SCL).\n\nDelivered by HS2’s main works contractor, Align – a joint venture formed of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick – each passage is between 15 and 20 metres in length.\n\nOnce the team had completed the SCL lined tunnel, a water-proof membrane was installed followed by a secondary concrete lining constructed by placing concrete behind formwork installed in the cross passage.\n\nMartyn Noak, HS2 Ltd’s Head of Tunnel Engineering, said:\n\n“HS2 is making huge progress, with 25,000 jobs supported by the project, construction in full swing between London and Birmingham and now the start of this new phase of tunnelling work under the Chilterns.\n\n“While invisible to the travelling public, the cross passages have a key role in providing a safe operational railway. In an emergency they allow the safe evacuation of passengers into a place of relative safety – the other tunnel. Constructing cross passages is different than using a tunnelling machine as the ground is excavated in short lengths with each advance being left unsupported for a short period of time until the sprayed concrete lining is installed. It is a different set of risks and a specific skilled workforce is needed.\n\n“It’s great to see the first one complete and I’d like to congratulate everyone involved in this important milestone, one down 37 to go.”\n\nDaniel Altier, Align Project Director said:\n\n“The completion of this cross passage is a significant milestone for the team at Align JV, delivering the first mined cross passage on HS2 phase 1. I’m proud of the team, their hard work and collaboration to get us to this point.\n\n“In partnership with our supply chain; KVJV responsible for the ground treatment, specialist contractor Euro Diamond Drilling and waterproofing specialist Renesco, the sub-surface team at Align have already commenced preparation work on several other cross passages and are making good progress.”\n\nOnce the passageway is complete, the safety doors can be installed at either end. These are being manufactured by Bolton-based Booth Industries who won the contract to provide more than 300 units for all the tunnels between London and Birmingham.\n\nThe win allowed Booth Industries to establish a new facility in the town and create up to 50 jobs over the next 10 years. The sliding doors have been subjected to rigorous fire and fatigue testing to take account of the train speeds, associated pressures and frequency of the trains.\n\nEach running tunnel has an emergency walkway that allows passengers to safely evacuate the train and walk through the cross passages into the other tunnel where they can be rescued on a passenger train. Access for emergency services is from either the portal or one of the five ventilation/emergency access shafts.\n\nSet in the middle of a road junction just outside the town, the new designs will see the height of the circular single storey building reduced by more than two metres and the ‘crown’ of steel fins replaced with perforated pre-patinated zinc panels to help match the natural tones of the surrounding landscape.\n\nBuilding on feedback and advice from Buckinghamshire Council, the new design will also see the weathered steel boundary wall replaced by a more traditional stone wall made of flint. The stone is naturally occurring within chalk hills like the Chilterns and flint facades have been a prominent feature of local architecture for hundreds of years.\n\nThe layout of the buildings will remain unchanged, with the spiral shaped walls echoing the shape of the site and the shaft beneath, while extra planting will be provided on the A413/A404 side of the site.\n\nKay Hughes, HS2 Ltd’s Design Director said:\n\n“The Amersham headhouse is one of the few parts of the Chiltern tunnel visible above ground so it’s important that we get the design right. LDA Landscape Architects and Grimshaw Architects have risen to the challenge with an exemplary design with local character.\n\n“The curved form of the head house is sensitively nestled into the landscape of a local traffic island by the designers. This and the combination of natural and traditional materials provides a contextual relationship with the area’s longstanding architectural traditions and setting.”\n\nThe 10 mile long Chiltern tunnel is the longest on the HS2 project, which is designed to improve links between London, Birmingham and the north, help level-up the economy and provide a low carbon alternative to car and air travel.\n\nBelow ground level, the 38 metre deep Amersham ventilation shaft will reach down to the twin tunnels below, with fans and other equipment designed to regulate air quality and temperature, remove smoke in the event of a fire and provide access for the emergency services.\n\nOnce construction is complete, new tree planting will be added to frame views of the headhouse and areas will be set aside for chalk grassland to help create valuable new wildlife habitats. The new planting will focus on native species typically found across the Chilterns, such as wild cherry, buckthorn and crab apple.\n\nThe plans have been drawn up by HS2 Ltd’s main works contractor Align JV – a team made up of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick - working with its design partners Jacobs and Ingerop-Rendel, architects Grimshaw and landscape designers, LDA Design.\n\nConstruction of the shaft is well underway, with the excavation complete and the site team moving on to the structural work inside the shaft.\n\nAlan Price, Align Technical Director said:\n\n“We are delighted to be revealing the updated designs for the Amersham vent shaft headhouse.\n\n“It has been essential for our designers to listen to the local stakeholders to understand what is important to them, and to update the design accordingly. We believe the jointly developed new design sits more comfortably within its surroundings and pays homage to the traditional local architecture.”\n\nThe revised plans for the headhouse are available on the community pages of HS2’s website, with local residents invited to attend a community information event on 7th July where they will be able to learn more about the design and construction of the vent shaft and headhouse.\n\nA formal Schedule 17 application will be submitted to Buckinghamshire Council later in the summer.\n\nThe start of construction is the latest major milestone in the delivery of the HS2 project, which is designed to improve rail links between London, Birmingham and North, help level-up the economy and provide a low carbon alternative to car and air travel.\n\nHS2 Minister, Andrew Stephenson said:\n\n“Today, HS2 began construction on what’s set to be Britain’s longest railway viaduct, a landmark moment for HS2 and a feat of British engineering, taking the HS2 line from London, and into Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.\n\n“Infrastructure is the backbone of HS2 and this viaduct will be integral to delivering faster journeys and an increased capacity rail network.”\n\nKnown as a ‘launching girder’, the 160m long bridge-building machine is the only one of its kind in the UK and will be used to lift the giant concrete deck segments that form the viaduct’s arches into position. Once each section is complete, the machine will inch itself forward into position to build the next stage.\n\nA total of one thousand deck segments will be needed, with each one weighing up to 140 tonnes. To allow for the gentle curves of the viaduct as it crosses the valley, all the segments are slightly different shapes and made on site at a purpose-built temporary factory close to the north abutment.\n\nWelcoming the milestone, HS2 Ltd Chief Executive Mark Thurston said:\n\n“I’m absolutely delighted that we have started work to assemble the giant deck segments that will form the Colne Valley Viaduct. It is yet another big milestone for HS2 Ltd, as we work to deliver the UK’s new high speed railway. Once complete, this record-breaking structure will form a key part of the HS2 railway – helping to deliver better connections across the UK, free up rail capacity on the train network, and offer passengers a zero carbon travel option.\n\n“I’d like to thank all those involved in getting us to this exciting stage and look forward to seeing the whole viaduct come together over the coming years.”\n\nThe huge viaduct project is being led by HS2’s main works contractor Align JV – a team made up of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine and VolkerFitzpatrick.\n\nOriginally built in 2004, the launching girder was first used during the construction of the Hong Kong East Tsing Yi Viaduct. Specially designed to handle complex viaduct construction, the machine is named ‘Dominique’ in memory of Bouygues engineer Dominique Droniou who played a leading role in its design and development.\n\n56 piers each weighing around 370 tonnes are being constructed along the Colne Valley ahead of the girder, with the girder moving from one pier to the next, installing the deck segments as it goes. One segment is put in place each side of the central pier, using a cantilever approach to balance the structure, as two half-arches either side of each pier are constructed simultaneously. Steel tensioning cables will be threaded through the segments to strengthen the bridge.\n\nEvery segment will be a slightly different shape depending on where it fits into the viaduct and the modular approach was chosen to ensure quality, safety and efficiency.\n\nThe viaduct pre-cast factory where the segments are made at the peak of construction will cast around 12 segments every week using a ‘match-casting’ technique. This approach - where each segment is poured against the previous one - will ensure the whole deck fits perfectly when assembled on the piers. The mammoth 100m long viaduct precast factory, which is visible from the M25, has an internal volume of 105,000 cubic metres – making it larger than the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nOnce construction is complete, the factory and surrounding buildings will be removed and the whole area between the viaduct and the Chiltern tunnel will be transformed into an area of chalk grassland and woodland as part of HS2’s ‘green corridor’ project.\n\nAlign Project Director, Daniel Altier said:\n\n“The start of the erection of the deck segments marks the latest important milestone for Align, relating to the construction of the Colne Valley Viaduct.\n\n“There has been a lot of hard work involved to get us to this point, and the achievements so far are a great example of what collaboration and excellent teamwork can deliver. I would specifically like to acknowledge the contribution from our supply chain partners - VSL, Kilnbridge, KVJV, VolkerStevin, Tarmac, Sendin and Vaughan Plant Haulage.”\n\nThe design of the Colne Valley Viaduct was inspired by the flight of a stone skipping across the water, with a series of elegant spans, some up to 80m long, carrying the railway around 10m above the surface of the lakes, River Colne and Grand Union Canal.\n\nSet low into the landscape, wider spans will carry the viaduct crosses the lakes, with narrower spans for the approaches. This design was chosen to enable views across the landscape, minimise the viaduct’s footprint on the lakes and help complement views across the natural surroundings.\n\nIn another visible sign of progress on the project, the team have also completed the construction of three of four jetties across the lakes to get equipment into position to support the construction and help take construction vehicles off local roads. Where the viaduct crosses the lakes, the piles are being bored directly into the lakebed, using a cofferdam to hold back the water while the pier is constructed.\n\nTwo perforated concrete hoods will cover the track, extending the 10 mile long tunnel into the open air. These ‘porous portals’ will avoid sudden changes in air pressure – and resulting noise – caused by trains entering and exiting the tunnels.\n\nSet low into the landscape between Great Missenden and South Heath in Buckinghamshire, the portals will only be visible from a footbridge over the railway to the north.\n\nTo allow for the different levels of air pressure, the portal for trains entering the tunnel will be 220m long, while the one for those exiting will be just 135m. Both will have smooth concrete on top and textured concrete to a low level, to reduce staining and maintenance.\n\nAlongside the portals, there will also be a simple single-storey ancillary building to house mechanical and electrical equipment. HS2 are currently seeking views from the community about the final design, with options including a green roof, split louvred or anodised aluminium façade.\n\nHS2 Ltd’s Project Client, David Emms said:\n\n“Once construction is complete, the Chiltern tunnel will take HS2 trains deep under the Chiltern hills, linking London with Birmingham and the North and releasing space for more freight and local services on the existing mainline.\n\n“Set low into the landscape and out of sight for most passers-by, the structures will play a crucial role in cutting out unnecessary noise and housing essential mechanical and electrical equipment. We are keen to hear local views and I would encourage people living locally to have a look at the designs and let us know what they think.”\n\nThe structures have been designed and will be built by HS2 Ltd’s main works contractor Align JV – a team made up of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick.\n\nWork is well underway, with two enormous 2,000 tonnes tunnel boring machines heading north from the south portal to excavate the twin-bore tunnels. They reached Chalfont St Peter last week and are expected to breakthrough at the north portal in two years’ time.\n\nAlan Price, Align JV Design Director said:\n\n“Our TBMs, Florence and Cecilia are making good progress and have each completed over 3km on their journey to the north portal.\n\n“We are always very conscious of the sensitive setting for any permanent structures on the project and this includes the north portal design. We welcome comments from local stakeholders in order that we can finalise the design.”\n\nTo the north of the tunnel, the new high speed line will be set into a cutting for 1.8 miles (3km) on its approach to the Wendover Dean Viaduct, with more than 20 hectares of new woodland, shrubs and wildflowers planted to help blend the railway into the surrounding countryside. The species chosen will be typical to the Chilterns including Beech, Oak, Yew, Holly and Dog Rose.\n\nAcross this stretch of the line, six new bridges will cross the railway cutting, linking country lanes and historic footpaths to the east and west. New planting will also link existing ancient woodlands alongside of the line, boosting biodiversity and connecting and enhancing existing wildlife habitats.\n\nThe surface route to the north of the tunnels, is being built by another of HS2’s main works contracts, EKFB - a team made up of Eiffage, Kier, Ferrovial Construction and Bam Nuttall.\n\nMore information – and an opportunity for local residents to respond to the designs – can be found here: https://www.hs2.org.uk/chiltern-tunnel-north-portal-ancillary-building-key-design-element/\n\nHS2 this week confirmed that the two enormous 2,000 tonne tunnelling machines digging the high speed rail project’s tunnels under the Chilterns have completed the first stage, up to the ventilation shaft at Chalfont St Peter.\n\nThis major achievement means that a combined total of over 3.6 miles has now been dug by the two machines – named Florence and Cecilia – since they launched from the southern end of the tunnels last summer.\n\nThe 78m deep shaft at Chalfont St Peter is the first of five that will provide ventilation and emergency access to the ten-mile-long twin tunnels – which are the longest on the project. Once complete, the shaft will be covered by a headhouse designed to resemble local farm buildings.\n\nDesigned specifically for the geology of the Chilterns, each TBM is a 170m long self-contained underground factory, digging the tunnel, lining it with concrete wall segments and grouting them into place as it moves forward.\n\nThe TBMs named ‘Florence’ and ‘Cecilia’ by local school children launched in May and June last year and are expected to break out at the north portal in around two and a half years.\n\nWelcoming the progress, HS2 Ltd Project Client David Emms said:\n\n“The Chiltern tunnel will take HS2 underneath the hills and safeguard the woodlands and wildlife habits above ground as well as significantly reducing disruption to communities during construction and operation of the new railway.\n\n“It’s great to see how much progress has been made by Florence and Cecilia – and the teams excavating the five ventilation shafts – and I’d like to thank everyone involved in getting us this far.”\n\nThese first two TBMs on the HS2 project are operated by, Align – a joint venture formed of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick.\n\nA crew of 17 people on board each machine keep them running, working in shifts and supported by over 100 people on the surface, managing the logistics and maintaining the smooth progress of the tunnelling operation.\n\nAlign Project Director, Daniel Altier commented:\n\n“Florence and Cecilia reaching our first shaft at Chalfont St Peter is a great achievement for not only the tunnelling team but also construction team involved in excavating and preparing the shaft. In particular I would like to pay credit to KVJV and Keltbray our supply chain partners, who have been working tirelessly over the last few months to ensure the shaft is ready for the arrival of Florence and Cecilia.”\n\nEach of the separate northbound and southbound tunnels will require 56,000 precision engineered, fibre-reinforced concrete wall segments – which are all being made in purpose build factories on site at the south portal, located just inside the M25. During their first 3.6 miles, Florence and Cecilia have combined installed more than 20,000 separate segments, each weighing around 8.5 tonnes.\n\nApproximately 2.7 million cubic metres of material will be excavated during the construction of the tunnels and used for landscaping on the south portal site. Once construction is complete, this will help create around 90 hectares of wildlife-rich chalk grassland habitats. Chalk grassland used to be widespread across the hills of south east England and are considered habitat of international conservation significance with just 700ha left across the Chilterns.\n\nIn total there will be ten TBMs on the HS2 project - working to create 64 miles of tunnel between London and the West Midlands including major tunnels on the approach to London and Birmingham. Three machines have been launched so far.\n\nMore than 20,000 jobs and over 650 apprenticeships are already being supported by HS2, which is set to transform transport links between Britain’s major cities, free up space on the rail network for more freight and local services and support the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.\n\nThe huge deck segments – which weigh up to 140 tonnes – are being made on site at a temporary factory built specifically for the project. The mammoth 100m long building, which is visible from the M25, has an internal volume of 105,000 cubic metres – making it larger than the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nHS2 Project Client, David Emms said:\n\n“We’re already making strong progress on the Colne Valley Viaduct – sinking the foundations, building the first piers, and now starting production at the new modular viaduct factory. Once complete, this iconic structure will carry trains at up to 200mph – improving connections across the UK, freeing up rail capacity and offering passengers low carbon travel options.\n\n“It’s great to see how much progress has been made and I look forward to seeing work on assembling the deck structure later this year.”\n\nEvery segment will be a slightly different shape depending on where it fits into the viaduct and the modular approach was chosen to ensure quality, safety and efficiency in production and to avoid bringing them in by road.\n\nAt the peak of construction, around 12 segments – each the size of a double-decker bus - will be cast every week using a ‘match-casting’ technique. This approach - where each segment is poured against the previous one - will ensure the whole arch fits perfectly when reassembled on site.\n\nThe huge project is being led by engineers from HS2’s main works contractor Align JV – a team made up of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick.\n\nOnce construction is complete, the factory and surrounding buildings will be removed and the whole area between the viaduct and the Chiltern tunnel will be transformed into an area of chalk grassland and woodland as part of HS2’s ‘green corridor’ project.\n\nDaniel Altier, Align Project Director\n\n“Seeing the first deck segments being cast in the factory marks a significant milestone for the project. The design of the viaduct is such that each segment will be unique, delivering a structure which I have no doubt will be one of the most striking elements of HS2 once complete.\n\n“I would like to thank all the Align team and our supply chain partners that have enabled us to get to where we are today and in particular VSL, Danny Sullivan, Sendin and Tarmac.”\n\nThe design of the Colne Valley Viaduct was inspired by the flight of a stone skipping across the water, with a series of elegant spans, some up to 80m long, carrying the railway around 10m above the surface of the lakes, River Colne and Grand Union Canal.\n\nSet low into the landscape, wider spans will carry the viaduct crosses the lakes, with narrower spans for the approaches. This design was chosen to enable views across the landscape, minimise the viaduct’s footprint on the lakes and help complement views across the natural surroundings.\n\nWork has also begun on the 56 giant piers that will support the viaduct, working from north to south. Weighing in at around 370 tonnes, the first 6m tall reinforced concrete pier was cast on site by a team of engineers who used a specially-designed formwork to create the shape of the structure. This was then removed after 4 days to reveal the final product.\n\nEach pier is designed to support the full weight of the deck above and rests on a set of concrete piles going up to 55m into the ground. This foundation work began earlier this year and will require the construction of 292 piles and 56 pile caps across the whole length of the viaduct.\n\nOnce complete, the team will then use a specialised ‘launching girder’ resting on top of the piers to lift the deck segments into position.\n\nIn another visible sign of progress on the project, the team have also completed the construction of the first two of four jetties across the lakes to get equipment into position to support the construction thereby taking construction vehicles off local roads. Where the viaduct crosses the lakes, the piles are being bored directly into the lakebed, using a cofferdam to hold back the water while the pier is constructed.\n\nPhotos:\n\nDownload new photos of viaduct construction and the new pre-cast factory\n\nThe first pier was cast by engineers from HS2’s main works contractor Align JV – a team made up of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick – and working in partnership with Kilnbridge.\n\nWeighing in at around 370 tonnes, the 6m tall reinforced concrete pier was cast on site by a team of engineers who used a specially-designed formwork to create the shape of the structure.

I’d like to thank the whole team for the huge amount of work they’ve done to get us to this point.”\n\nAlign’s Project Director, Daniel Altier, added:\n\n“I have no doubt that the viaduct will become one, if not the most striking element of HS2 phase 1 once complete. The way it will be constructed is going to be equally fascinating for engineers young and old. The sections for the deck will be fabricated at our main construction site to the west of London just inside the M25, and using a huge launching girder, the deck will be formed from north to south, along the line of the route, thereby keeping unnecessary construction traffic off the roads.\n\n“I would like to thank the whole team, including our supply chain partners, who have worked very hard to enable us to meet this important milestone in the viaduct’s construction.”\n\nThe design of the Colne Valley Viaduct was inspired by the flight of a stone skipping across the water, with a series of elegant spans, some up to 80m long, carrying the railway around 10m above the surface of the lakes, River Colne and Grand Union Canal.\n\nSet low into the landscape, wider spans will carry the viaduct crosses the lakes, and narrower spans for the approaches. This design was chosen to enable views across the landscape, minimise the viaduct’s footprint on the lakes and help complement views across the natural surroundings.\n\nThe main deck of the viaduct – which supports the railway line - will be built in 1000 separate unique segments at a temporary factory nearby before being assembled from north to south, starting next year.\n\nAs part of a push across the whole HS2 project to cut carbon in construction, the design and construction teams working on the viaduct have also cut the amount of embedded carbon in the viaduct by around a third, by narrowing the width of the structure and applying lessons for the design of highspeed railway bridges in Europe.\n\nOver the last six years, HS2 has worked closely with Affinity Water and the Environment Agency to monitor water quality and agree working methods. These are being monitored by a team of specialist engineers during construction in order to protect the natural environment.\n\nHS2 today [Monday 15th November 2021] confirmed that it is on track to cut the amount of embedded carbon in the Colne Valley Viaduct by at least 28.4%, as works continue for what will be the UK’s longest railway bridge.\n\nApplying lessons from the construction of the latest European high speed railway bridges, the British team has cut the amount of embedded carbon in the viaduct by 63,300 tonnes CO2e – the equivalent of 234,500 flights from London to Edinburgh.\n\nThe production of concrete and steel are major sources of CO2 emissions, so narrowing the width of the viaduct allowed a significant reduction in carbon, and helps reduce disruption for local residents by reducing the number of HGVs on local roads.\n\nInspired by the flight of a stone skimming over the surface of the water, the Colne Valley Viaduct will stretch for 3.4km across a series of lakes on the outskirts of London, and will be one of the most high-profile structures on the new HS2 high speed rail link under construction between London, the West Midlands and Crewe.\n\nHS2 Ltd’s main works contractor Align JV – a team made up of Bouygues Travaux Publics, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick – worked for four years on the design with architects Grimshaw and design partners Jacobs and Ingerop-Rendel.\n\nStarting from the reference design produced as part of the HS2 parliamentary process, they refined the design, challenged assumptions, and found efficiencies to help reduce the amount of steel and concrete in the structure.\n\nThis included working closely with rail systems experts at HS2 Ltd to allow the structure to be narrowed by over 1m, while still allowing sufficient space for signalling and control equipment alongside the line. They also worked to bring the northbound and southbound tracks closer together further north, which in turn significantly reduced the amount of earthworks required for the approach embankment.\n\nConscious of commitments made to the community about the appearance of the viaduct as it passed over the lakes, the team focused on creating long graceful arches over the water while reserving simpler, easier to construct, designs for the approaches.
