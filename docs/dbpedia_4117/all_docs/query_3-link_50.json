A large portion of the region was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1965.\n\nMany parts of the Chilterns have been covered with woodland for hundreds of years, and today the Chilterns are still one of the most wooded parts of England. People flock here to experience its rolling hills, distant views, chalk grassland, and acres of woodland. Ever changing through each season, it is a firm favourite with everyone.\n\nAmersham Museum is a small local museum located on the High Street in Old Amersham. The museum is housed in a 15th-century half-timbered house and is itself is a stunning piece of history. It contains collections of fossils and archaeological finds, including items from Roman and mediaeval times. At just £2.50 to enter, it makes for a very interesting experience.\n\nNearby in Beaconsfield is Bekonscot, this is the oldest surviving model village in the world opened in 1929. Stuck in its 1930s-time warp, this 1½ acre site displays hundreds of buildings and thousands of plants, created in minute and meticulous detail.\n\nTiny figures go about their business in an entertaining variety of nostalgic scenes, set in little gardens and all linked by a model railway.\n\nChiltern Open Air Museum in Chalfont St Giles is 5 miles from Amersham. The museum rescues threatened buildings that are typical of the Chilterns and re-erects them on a 45-acre site of natural park, meadow and woodland.\n\nThere are more than 30 buildings on the site which includes a working 19th century farmyard and a village, traditional machinery is still in use, making the farm a particularly special place.\n\nAmersham Property\n\nAs you would expect from such a highly sought-after and beautiful area, property is very expensive with the average cost of a home reaching almost £700,000, over double the national average.\n\nWithin one mile of the town there are currently 152 homes for sale.
