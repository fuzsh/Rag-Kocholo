        "text": "About\n\nAmersham Old Town is a charming town that is full of character. There are houses that date back as far as 1450 (housing Amersham Museum) and the Market Hall, that contained the town's gaol, dates from 1682.\n\nHistorically, Amersham was once a centre for the Lollards, a religious movement following John Wycliffe. They first arrived during the 14th century and preached barefoot in the streets.\n\nBy the 16th century, the movement was taking over the town and many followers were burned at the stake. Their memory lives on in the Martyrs Memorial, off Station Road.\n\nThe rich blend of heritage buildings and modern day shops and facilities combine to make Old Amersham a delightful place to visit. Seasons Cafe Deli and Seasons Cafe at Rowan in nearby Chalfont St. Giles make great place to stop for a bite to eat or drink.\n\nThe town has the advantage of excellent communications, situated twenty minutes from the M25, yet surrounded by the beautiful Chilterns."
