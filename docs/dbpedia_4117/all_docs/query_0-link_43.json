Let's get fancy.\n\nVO: ..behind the wheel of a classic car.\n\nI'm always in turbo.\n\nVO: And a goal - to scour Britain for antiques.\n\nHot stuff!\n\nVO: The aim - to make the biggest profit at auction.\n\nIZZIE: (GASPS) VO: But it's no mean feat.\n\nThere'll be worthy winners... PHIL: Cha-ching.\n\nMARK: Oh, my goodness!\n\nVO: ..and valiant losers.\n\nDAVID: Bonkers!\n\nVO: Will it be the high road to glory... You are my ray of sunshine.\n\nNATASHA: Oh, stop it!\n\nVO: ..or the slow road VO: to disaster?\n\n(GEARS CRUNCH) Sorry!\n\nVO: This is Antiques Road Trip.\n\nYeah!\n\nWe're in Berkshire this morning, hitting the road again with not one but two antiquers.\n\nMARK (MH): Oh, you had a little sort of Marilyn Monroe moment there.\n\nOh, my goodness!\n\nIRITA (IM): I don't know what that is.\n\nIt's like there's air coming from underneath me while I'm sat down.\n\nVO: Wow!\n\nIrita Marriott is behind the wheel, with Mark Hill in the passenger seat.\n\nI think that was the beans last night.\n\nIM: Oh, Mark!\n\nMH: (CHUCKLES) I might've had one too many.\n\nMaybe.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nMaybe not tomorrow.\n\nThat's why you have the open-top car.\n\nI know.\n\nThank goodness for that!\n\nVO: Oo-er, chaps!\n\nCome on - raise the tone a bit.\n\nIt's the second leg of our trip with these two and their sky-blue Triumph Herald.\n\n# It's the morning!\n\n# It's the morning after... # My disaster!\n\nIM: It wasn't that bad!\n\nMH: It was for me.\n\nIt's alright for you, Miss Moneybags.\n\nVO: Yes.\n\nThings didn't quite go Mark's way last time out.\n\nCharmed by something unusual, he took a punt on a curio.\n\nI rather like this.\n\nVO: While our porcelain princess invested heavily in the ceramics market.\n\nOh, my goodness, I've got expensive taste!\n\nVO: But there was only one winner at the auction.\n\nAUCTIONEER: 550.\n\nIM: 550?!\n\n550.\n\nIM: No!\n\nMH: Well done!\n\nNow, how are you feeling with the budget that you have?\n\nAgh!\n\nIM: You're... MH: Did that sum it up?\n\nMH: Agh!\n\nIM: (LAUGHS) VO: Poor Mark.\n\nThey both began with £200 but after that last trip to the saleroom, he's down to just £114.\n\nWhile Irita is rolling in the money.\n\nAfter that first leg, she's topped her piggy up to £570.\n\nThis is only my second road trip, so, you know, I'm still learning the ropes.\n\nI'm rooting for you, Mark.\n\nThank you.\n\nVO: Very sporting!\n\nNow, our antiques adventure began in Surrey, and we're making our way through England's Home Counties and East Anglia en route to a final showdown in Sevenoaks, Kent.\n\nMH: Isn't this lovely?\n\nMH: So, where are we, actually?\n\nIM: I don't know.\n\nAnd I'm usually the one that knows all the directions and know exactly where I'm heading to.\n\nWell, there's a really important point that has to be remembered here - you're driving.\n\nSo if you have no idea where we are, do you have any idea where we're going?\n\nForward?\n\nVO: As good a direction as any.\n\nOn this leg, our shopping spree concludes with an auction in Bedford.\n\nBut, first up, we're in Windsor - the historic market town is the ancestral seat, of course, of the Royal Family.\n\nThere are some fabulous antiques in Windsor Castle, but after dropping off her buddy, Irita will have to make do with the contents of Windsor Vintage... ..a cozy wee place with plenty of goodies.\n\n£570 in her purse.\n\nLet the games begin!\n\nIsn't that a beautiful image?\n\nWindsor Official Guide.\n\nThis is something that is such a bygone kind of item because who goes now somewhere and buys a guide?\n\nThink how many memories that would've brought back to you from when you visited.\n\nAnd they're really, really educating.\n\nIM: Maybe I should buy one.\n\nVO: Maybe you should.\n\nMeanwhile, let's catch up with Mark.\n\nHe's just around the corner at Wellington Antiques.\n\nOh, loving the jacket!\n\nHey!\n\nHere we are.\n\nVO: This family-run business has a bit of everything.\n\nMark's only got £114 to spend, so needs some canny buys if he wants to catch up with Irita.\n\nI spy antiques.\n\nVO: But do you spy any bargains?\n\nBecause that's what you need.\n\nOh, hello!\n\nAmidst all this Victoriana, I spot a mid-century modern glass icon.\n\nOoh!\n\n(CHUCKLES) And something else on top.\n\nThere we go.\n\nLet's grab it properly.\n\nThis incredibly elegant candleholder has a little bit of an invader.\n\nThis is not an original part of it, so I'm going to pop that there and restore it to exactly what I'd expect to find.\n\nThe amazing thing about this particular candleholder, which is known as Brancaster, is that it has a hollow stem.\n\nThat's really clever glasswork.\n\nAnd, of course, because it's hollow, you have this wonderful graduation in the tone of the amethyst glass here.\n\nAnd there are just tiny details to show that this is a great-quality piece.\n\nWhen you look at the base here, it's not rounded - it's been nicely finished off.\n\nElegance for the dining table and something very practical to use today.\n\nAnd something that, ultimately, is, what?\n\n40, 50 years - nearly half a century old?\n\nSadly, no price.\n\nI'm going to pop this back on... pop over and have a word with Michael and see what we can do.\n\nVO: Michael is the owner.\n\nOh, nice blazer, old boy!\n\nMH: Michael?\n\nDEALER: Yeah.\n\nMH: Hello.\n\nDEALER: Good afternoon.\n\nAmazing shop!\n\nOh, thank you.\n\nThat's very kind.\n\nWithin, I found this rather snazzy candleholder, which doesn't have a price.\n\nIt can't be expensive so could you just let me know what you think?\n\nUm, well, 20 quid.\n\n£20.\n\nOK, so it's actually two things.\n\nIf I took this bit off, which isn't part of it, and gave that back to you, could we do something for the price - bearing in mind I've got, like, two thirds of it, three-quarters of it now?\n\n15 quid.\n\nMH: 15 quid?\n\nDEALER: Yeah.\n\nWe have a deal.\n\nVO: 15 spent - which leaves Mark with £99.\n\nMH: And away we go.\n\nDEALER: Thank you.\n\nMH: Thank you most kindly.\n\nDEALER: That's alright.\n\nVO: With his business concluded, let's nip back to Irita across town and see how she's getting on.\n\nOh.\n\nHello, you chappie!\n\nHmm.\n\nStylish.\n\nInterior decorators' thing.\n\nA little plaster bust of what looks a miner... because he got a pickaxe on the shoulder.\n\nI just think if you got, you know, like a library or an office and you got some book shelves, wouldn't he look absolutely superb?\n\nVO: Sculpted heads like this one are known as portrait busts.\n\nThe tradition can be traced back to antiquity and the ancient Greeks.\n\nMaybe the price will make up my mind, should I buy it or not?\n\nOh, it's £38.\n\nI mean, that's cheap as chips, don't you think?\n\nVO: Better HEAD over to the till!\n\nHa-ha!\n\nNow, Mark, I found this and it's priced at £38.\n\nOK. Mm-hm.\n\nSo, here's 40 and I would like £2 change, please.\n\nOK. You weren't expecting that, were you?\n\nNo!\n\n(THEY CHUCKLE) VO: First time for everything.\n\nDon't forget your change.\n\nCome on, Jeffrey.\n\nOff we go.\n\nVO: That leaves Irita with £532.\n\nAnd while she motors on... over the border into Buckinghamshire, Mark has made his way to Amersham.\n\nHe's caught the scent of a story about a local perfume pioneer who changed the smell of the 1960s.\n\nEmma Treleaven will tell him more.\n\nHello, Mark.\n\nHello.\n\nWelcome to Amersham Museum.\n\nI see you're enjoying our beautiful garden.\n\nWell, it's wonderful.\n\nIt's not just the flowers, but the incredible sort of smell.\n\nIt's all about the senses, isn't it?\n\nIt absolutely is.\n\nWe have a huge amount of sensory things in our collection, including a wonderful collection of Goya perfume and cosmetics, as well, from a local brand - Goya.\n\nAmazing.\n\nSo, when was Goya founded?\n\nSo, Goya's began in London in the early 1930s.\n\nA very young entrepreneur named Douglas Collins started a company to make Brylcreem and hair creams when he was just 19 years old in about 1933.\n\nUm, and he realized pretty quickly that he had this enormous talent for mixing perfumes.\n\nSo kind of by 1935, he'd already made 15 different kinds of perfumes and had begun selling them very successfully, and the brand kind of just kept going from there.\n\nVO: British perfumery mostly grew out of the gentlemen's grooming industry of the 18th century, but it was pretty exclusive to the affluent classes.\n\nIn the 20th century, when fashion houses launched their most famous scents - such as Lanvin Arpege and Chanel's No.\n\n5 - the average person couldn't afford it.\n\nIt wasn't until labels like Goya launched affordable perfumes such as Aqua Manda and Black Rose that fashionable scents became accessible to the average working person.\n\nSo, what did that do to Amersham?\n\nBecause this business arrives and it grows and grows and grows to the point that it's got three factories and, presumably, it transformed the town.\n\nYeah, it did.\n\nIt was very significant in terms of just the amount of people it employed.\n\nIt was kind of the coveted summer job.\n\nIf you were young and you could become a \"Goya girl\", that was the place to be.\n\nUm, he... You would get a quarterly allowance of products - so lots of, you know, beautiful lipsticks and perfumes and things, as well as additional discounts if you wanted anything on top of that.\n\nUm, but also socially, he was a very, very supportive employer.\n\nSo, you were allowed to chat as you worked, you were allowed to have the radio on.\n\nThe working hours were very social.\n\nYou'd start at eight in the morning, you'd get a nice, long lunch break, you'd finish at five.\n\nSo, he was very supportive of, kind of, his staff.\n\nVO: Goya was also the first company in the UK to offer their staff three weeks of annual leave, as opposed to two.\n\nBy the mid '60s, Douglas Collins was not only a successful entrepreneur but a radically progressive employer, too.\n\nSo, he builds this enormous business, transforms Amersham, transforms Amersham's community.\n\nWhat happened to the factory?\n\nSo, they kind of went from success to success for a very long time.\n\nYou know, Aqua Manda was one of the most famous perfumes in England in the 1970s.\n\nIt kind of...\n\nThings began to change a little bit in the '60s.\n\nSo, Douglas Collins sold the company in 1960.\n\nBeing part of other companies, or a larger conglomerate, didn't really suit Goya, and so it ended up closing in about 1985.\n\nSo, was that the end of Goya or...?\n\nNot quite.\n\nThere was actually a group that got started that really wanted Aqua Manda, in particular, to be remade, and they kind of gained traction, slowly but steadily.\n\nAnd, um, Christopher Collins, Douglas' son, in collaboration with a couple of other people, kind of got together and recreated it, which is great.\n\nAnd we actually have Christopher inside today, if you want to come in and meet him.\n\nI would love to.\n\nPlease.\n\nYes.\n\nVO: As well as Chris, Mark is meeting Neil Cohen, who has been instrumental in resurrecting Goya's famous fragrance.\n\nI need to smell this if I can.\n\nSo, I can spray this on here.\n\nSo, this is the more modern version.\n\nThe recreation.\n\nWhich is so close to the... You get the citrusy high notes and then there's... CHRIS: Something beyond it.\n\nMH: Isn't there?\n\nSo, what do you think the lasting legacy of Aqua Manda and Goya is?\n\nIt was something of its era, but an era of long ago.\n\nThe smell is the main thing.\n\nIt doesn't matter about...\n\nThe packaging can look great and everything else but they've got to get the smell right.\n\nAnd, luckily enough, we spent so much time doing it and we did get it there.\n\nA lot of people, a lot of complimentary comments from people who remembered it from so many years earlier.\n\nUm, so, yeah, it was really nice to bring those memories back with people.\n\nVO: Over 30 years after its closure, Goya still has resonance in the local area.\n\nFor a brief time, the smell of the Swinging Sixties was crafted by Douglas Collins in Amersham.\n\nSeveral miles around the corner, Irita is in the Herald approaching her next stop.\n\nShop one done!\n\nNow, then, got a lot of money to play with.\n\nVO: Well, you can spend it all in Berkhamsted at Home & Colonial interiors.\n\nNice!\n\nOh, look at this.\n\nOh, my goodness!\n\nFour stories!\n\nI'm going to get lost.\n\nEstablished for over 25 years and specializing in interiors and mid-century design, there are more than 35 specialist dealers here, displaying across five floors.\n\nI love cabinets like this because you never know what you're going to find.\n\nIt's such an eclectic mix.\n\nNow, one thing that has caught my eye in here is this little chappie.\n\nAnd why has he caught my eye?\n\nLet's start with the fact that it is 200 years old.\n\nIt is what's known as penwork from Regency times.\n\nAnd when you painted with pen and ink on wood and handled it for 200 years... it rubbed off.\n\nThis is rather bright.\n\nAnd it is rather jolly.\n\nOne thing that appeals to me, personally, about this is the fact that it opens right in the middle like a Russian doll.\n\nAnd that takes me back to being a kid.\n\nThis little chappie's priced at £125.\n\nNever seen another one.\n\nI don't think I ever will.\n\nOne of a kind.\n\nAm I prepared to take that gamble?\n\nWell, I have pockets full of money, so I might as well buy something that I really, really like.\n\nVO: We're on!\n\nTime to find Lizzie - the dealer.\n\nIM: There you are, Lizzie.\n\nDEALER: Hi, there.\n\nI've been all over the shop.\n\nIt is massive, isn't it?\n\nDEALER: Yeah, it is.\n\nIM: There's so much to see.\n\nSorry to have disturbed you in your work.\n\nDEALER: OK. IM: But I wanted to talk about one little piece of treen that was upstairs.\n\nDEALER: Right.\n\nIM: The little chap.\n\nIt was priced £125.\n\nRight.\n\nI've come holding some money.\n\n(CHUCKLES) Do you know, is there any trade on it, at all?\n\nI think there is a little, yes.\n\nOK. What could it be...?\n\nDEALER: Um... IM: Please?\n\nOff my head, I believe she could do a hundred and... ten.\n\nOoh!\n\nYou were just about to say 105.\n\nI was.\n\nYou were!\n\nI spotted that!\n\n105.\n\nBut that would be it.\n\nThat would be it.\n\nOK. Well, we will go with 105.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nVO: A generous discount.\n\nThanks, Lizzie.\n\nThank you, Lizzie.\n\nSee you later.\n\nBye-bye.\n\nVO: 105 spent - leaving Irita with £427.\n\nNow, time to collect Mark.\n\nIf you would have to be an animal... ..what kind of animal would you be?\n\nIM: Would you be an insect?\n\nCS: Charming.\n\nIM: I reckon you could be a very good grasshopper.\n\nLong legs, big leaps.\n\nI could do that.\n\nAnd I will make a big leap in profit.\n\nIM: Hey-hey!\n\nMH: Ha!\n\nHa!\n\nVO: On that note, let's hop to it and go to bed.\n\nNighty-night.\n\nRise and shine!\n\nAnother shopping day awaits.\n\nOh, Mark, I'm feeling rather blue today.\n\nFeeling rather blue?\n\nI think we are all feeling rather blue.\n\nThe car - Herald's feeling blue.\n\nI'm blue.\n\nYou're blue.\n\nI can't believe how coordinated we all are!\n\nVO: The sky is blue, too!\n\nIt's a lovely morning for antiquing.\n\nMH: SO, dotty and blue - do you feel dotty today, as well?\n\nHow would you... What do you mean by dotty?\n\nYou get those mornings, sometimes - you must have them - when you wake up in the morning and just feeling a bit like... oo-oo.\n\nHow do you feel when you feel... oo-oo?\n\nLike, oo-oo.\n\nWell, I'm none the wiser!\n\n(CHUCKLES) VO: Neither am I!\n\nHuh-ha-hah!\n\nYesterday, Irita picked up two new friends - the Regency penwork gentleman and the miner's head plaster bust... Oh, hello, you chappie.\n\nVO: ..leaving her with £427.\n\nMeanwhile, despite keeping his eyes peeled...\n\nI spy antiques.\n\n..it was only the glass candleholder for Mark, setting him back just £15.\n\nThat's two fabulous things you've just bought.\n\nWell.\n\nWhat can I say?\n\n\"What can I say?\"\n\nshe says, modestly stroking her hair.\n\nVO: Today, our experts will shop exclusively in Hertfordshire, with our first stop-off in the village of Markyate... where Mark, after depositing Irita, will be shopping at Retrovation.\n\nLet's gallop towards some profits.\n\nVO: Open by appointment only, and based on a working farm, inside it's a regular Aladdin's cave.\n\nMark has £99 to his name, remember?\n\nSo let's see what he can rustle up in here.\n\nLove this!\n\nSpleens, livers.\n\nKidneys.\n\nBody parts.\n\nJack the Ripper, eat your heart out!\n\nVO: Don't worry, they're fake.\n\nMH: Now, this sort of thing I love - anything quirky, anything macabre, anything that sort of creates a conversation or even perhaps a scream from a guest when they come into your house.\n\nVO: Oh, you ARE a hoot!\n\nMH: These have huge appeal today.\n\nVO: Anatomical models revolutionized medicine.\n\nPreviously, students had to wait for fresh cadavers but, by the 19th century, mass-produced plaster models like these gave students greater access to study the human body.\n\nHopefully won't cost you an arm and a leg.\n\nHa-ha!\n\nWhat else is there?\n\nI think I know what these are.\n\nI think these are off a London bus.\n\nAnd these would have sat on the front inside a frame telling you where the bus was going and, inside, there would have been a little handle that the driver would turn to change the destination.\n\nSo what have we got?\n\nWe've got Romford, Romford Station.\n\nWe've got... Cambridge Heath.\n\nWe've got a bit of an east London thing.\n\nI can see these would be interesting to a lot of people and I'm loving this East End vibe going on here.\n\nI mean, imagine cutting these up and then framing them all and displaying them on a wall.\n\nAnd they're not that common, either.\n\nThere's quite a lot of them here, though, and I wonder whether I could do a bulk discount.\n\nA plan is hatched.\n\nVO: Dear me, you spend all day waiting for antiques experts and then two come along at once.\n\nIrita's arrived in Sawbridgeworth at the Herts & Essex Antiques Centre.\n\nOur dealer from Derby has a purse bulging with £427 she's itching to spend.\n\nIM: When I first glanced at it, I was 100% sure that it was an early Napoleonic prisoner-of-war straw-work box.\n\nIt has all the signs of it.\n\nI mean, it's a rather cool shape.\n\nEvery single bit of this is made with straw.\n\nOne drawback - one bit that took my excitement ever so slightly away.\n\nThe base is actually wood.\n\nThat means it's straw-work on wood - so it is not as early as I thought it might be.\n\nHowever... look at the quality.\n\nIt's not as old as I thought, but £15.\n\n£15.\n\nThat is a bargain!\n\nThis one's coming with me.\n\nVO: Time for a deal.\n\nIM: Hello, Polly.\n\nDEALER: Oh, hi, there.\n\nHello.\n\nDEALER: Can I help you?\n\nIM: Yes!\n\nIt is priced at a very fair £15.\n\nIt is.\n\nNo haggling.\n\nVery easy.\n\n£15 right there.\n\nOK.\n\nThank you.\n\nIM: Thank you very much, Polly.\n\nDEALER: You're welcome.\n\nIM: Have a good one.\n\nBye!\n\nDEALER: Thank you.\n\nBye-bye.\n\nVO: Well, that was simple.\n\n£15 spent, leaving Irita with £412 to go on with.\n\nNow, 30 miles away on the farm, let's get back to Mark at Markyate.\n\nI rather like this dinky little pendant lamp.\n\nThis really shouts arts and crafts.\n\nAnd it was all about sort of rejecting industry and going back to handcrafts.\n\nAnd, sometimes, it's sort of folklore, sort of medieval.\n\nIt's kind of a romantic view of those styles.\n\nAnd this lantern with this sort of hand-beaten - there's very much the evidence of hand craftsmanship here - effect on the brass really sums up the arts-and-crafts movement to me.\n\nI've only got 99 quid.\n\nBut, you know, it's worth asking.\n\nAs my mum always used to say, \"Well, the only thing they can say is no.\"\n\nBetter track down Dawn, then, and see what she can do.\n\nMH: Dawn.\n\nHello?\n\nDEALER: Hello.\n\nHi.\n\nI am feeling so inspired.\n\nThis is amazing!\n\nIt's a real Aladdin's cave for me.\n\nDEALER: Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nI'm so pleased you love it.\n\nI found a few eclectic, quirky objects, but I am working to a really, really tight budget so please, please be gentle with me.\n\nOK. VO: So, that's a box of anatomy models, Routemaster bus signs and a brass lamp.\n\nAll unpriced.\n\nWhat's the very best you could do?\n\nDEALER: For all three?\n\nMH: For three.\n\nYeah.\n\nMH: Three items.\n\nDEALER: About £100.\n\nAh, could we come down to... DEALER: Oh, er... MH: If I said 70?\n\nI really want you to win.\n\nMH: 70?\n\nDEALER: Absolutely.\n\nMH: Really?\n\nDEALER: Yes.\n\nYes.\n\nDEALER: Brilliant.\n\nMH: Thank you!\n\nLoved you coming to visit.\n\nI have loved it here.\n\nThat is brilliant.\n\nAnd this has made my day.\n\nVO: Super generous, Dawn.\n\nThank you.\n\nMH: I'll pop that there and go and collect my treasures.\n\nDEALER: Brilliant.\n\nMH: Thank you, Dawn.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nVO: That's £25 each for the brass lamp and box of body parts, ha, and £20 on the Routemaster signs, leaving Mark with £29.\n\nLet's saddle up and hit the road.\n\nMeanwhile, Irita has made her way to Clarence Park in St Albans - home of the St Albans Cricket Club.\n\nShe's here to meet Rebecca Kelly to learn about the sport, and a player who dedicated her life to raising the profile of the women's game.\n\nRight-io, Irita - time to get kitted up.\n\nReady for it.\n\nNo spikes or studs.\n\nWell, nobody said anything about heels.\n\nRebecca!\n\nIrita!\n\nYou look fantastic!\n\nIM: What do you think?\n\nREBECCA: Heels.\n\nI've never seen or coached anyone in heels before.\n\nWell, there's first time for everything.\n\nRight, what do I do?\n\nRight.\n\nGrab yourself a bat and we'll get started.\n\nI'm guessing that's the bat.\n\nREBECCA: That is the bat.\n\nIM: OK. Ready.\n\nBorn ready.\n\nBorn ready.\n\nLove it.\n\nOK. Left hand goes on the top.\n\nOK. And your right hand on the bottom.\n\nAnd we can have a go at the pull shot.\n\nREBECCA: Absolutely.\n\nIM: OK.\n\nSo, it's a horizontal shot so your bat's going to be here.\n\nIM: So, one leg forward.\n\nREBECCA: Yeah.\n\nI'm going to put the ball on the tee and it doesn't matter if you hit any of the objects, but the idea is to get the ball and hit it towards the clubhouse as hard as you can.\n\nIM: OK. REBECCA: When you're ready.\n\nIM: As hard as you can.\n\nYes!\n\nI did it!\n\nThere you go!\n\nThat was amazing!\n\nWell done, Irita!\n\nBorn for this.\n\nVO: Women have played cricket for centuries - the first recorded women's match took place in 1745.\n\nHowever, despite a rich tradition, women's cricket has always struggled to gain recognition.\n\nOne player who stepped up to the crease and worked to change the sport for women was Audrey Collins OBE.\n\nAnd one beneficiary was our coach.\n\nWould you be playing cricket if it wasn't for her?\n\nNo, I definitely wouldn't be.\n\nShe certainly got me onto the cricket scene.\n\nInitially, I was just playing with boys and it was fantastic to actually go and play for the Radlett Vagabonds and play with other girls.\n\nVO: She represented England in the Ashes in 1937 and was the longest-serving president of the Women's Cricket Association.\n\nShe passed away in 2010, but her memory lives on.\n\nHer good friend Jane has come to meet Irita.\n\nI have a photo of her here... IM: Oh, look!\n\nJANE: ..as our club president.\n\nOh, she's wearing a dress.\n\nOh, how lovely!\n\nJANE: Yeah.\n\nIM: I thought...\n\nI just had a go at cricket and I thought I was in very inappropriate attire, wearing a dress.\n\nWell, Audrey never wore trousers, so you were absolutely playing the part.\n\nAnd it's so important to have role models for females - IM: like her.\n\nJANE: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nAnd we were very lucky.\n\nWhen she died - and she was well in her 90s when... when she died - um, we were left £1,000.\n\nUm, and so we thought... We thought long and hard what to do with the £1,000 that was given to our club.\n\nSo we thought, what better way than to invest in - not just the Shield, there was a whole tournament, a girls' cricket tournament that continues in Audrey's name, which is... which is fantastic.\n\nI think she would have been very, very proud of how you chose to spend the £1,000 she left you.\n\nVO: Audrey Collins' achievements and dedication inspired a generation of girls to pick up the bat.\n\nAnd today's women's cricket is growing at an unprecedented rate, finally gaining the recognition it deserves.\n\n25 miles away, our boy in blue and the Herald are back on the road.\n\nYou know, out of the two of us - and I'm not trying to, you know, play the violin, the sob story - I think I'm the one under the most pressure because I've got to pull a bargain out of a bag.\n\nI've got to find something for tens of pounds that's worth hundreds of pounds, even if I plan to get anywhere near where Irita is.\n\nVO: Well, you've got one more chance to snaffle some bargains.\n\nOur next and final shop on this leg is in Sawbridgeworth at the delicious-looking Maltings Antiques.\n\nLooks like I'm here first, which means a head start.\n\nVO: This family-run establishment has a bevy of bargains across five rooms and three floors.\n\nMark has just £29 left, so will have to make every penny count.\n\nIrita, who's arriving close on Mark's heels, doesn't have that problem.\n\nShe still got a whopping £412.\n\nWow!\n\nThis area has all the quirks and quirky sells.\n\nIt's just a matter of finding the right quirky thing.\n\nA lay figure of a horse.\n\nSo, if you're an artist learning to draw, this is for you.\n\nIt is a figure of a horse, in this instance, that you can adjust to whatever position you wish, and you can draw it.\n\nAnd the early ones, they fetch some money - thousands and thousands of pounds.\n\nIt is priced at £135.\n\nI think that's an option.\n\nVO: To buy or not to buy, that is the EQUESTRIAN!\n\nLet's trot on - huh!\n\n- and find Mark.\n\nI always try to think of something that is useful in the home.\n\nAnd when you're looking at antiques, how would it fit into today's homes and would it actually still be useful in today's homes?\n\nIt's a little quirky, I admit, but I like this.\n\nI kind of also like oversized or miniature things.\n\nAnd what we've got here is, effectively, an oversized match striker.\n\nSo this would have sat by a fireplace and you'd have taken out a match - very long - struck it on the side, and then you didn't need to use tapers as you lean forward and light your fire.\n\nI think it's 20th century, not quite sure when - earliest maybe 1920s or '30s, latest maybe '50s or '60s - but it's just got a look and it's within spitting distance of my budget.\n\n£35.\n\nI haven't seen one quite like it before, so I think I'm going to clutch this and see whether I can strike up a bargain.\n\nVO: Agnieszka is the lady you have to speak with, Mark.\n\nMH: Agnieszka.\n\nDEALER: Oh, hello.\n\nHello.\n\nI have a request.\n\nDEALER: Go for it.\n\nMH: It has £35.\n\nYou'd like to offer 34?\n\nI would like to offer all the money I have - £29.\n\n£29.\n\nCan we do this?\n\nCome on, baby, light my fire!\n\nAs it's you, yes, we can.\n\nThank you.\n\nFantastic.\n\nI am delighted.\n\n25.\n\nThis is literally every penny I have.\n\nNine.\n\nThank you so much... DEALER: Hope you do well.\n\nMH: ..Agnieszka.\n\nMH: I hope so, too.\n\nThank you.\n\nDEALER: Thank you.\n\nVO: And that's Mark all spent up.\n\nBut what about Irita?\n\nIs she still shopping?\n\nVintage trunk.\n\n£65.\n\nIt used to be made for traveling.\n\nNow - you can have it as a coffee table, you can put your blankets inside.\n\nIt's practical.\n\nIt looks the part.\n\nIt has that real shabby-chic... ..feel to it that everybody seems to love right now.\n\nThat's it.\n\nDecision made.\n\nSee how easy that was?\n\nVO: So, that's the horse with £135 on the ticket and the trunk with 65.\n\nLet's see if Agnieszka is feeling generous.\n\nAgnieszka!\n\nHi, Irita.\n\nNow, I want to buy two things, please, and I've come to see whether there is a deal to be done.\n\nOne was a lay figure of a horse.\n\nThe best we can do is £95.\n\nOK. Also, upstairs there is, like, a green canvas chest thing and that was 65.\n\nWe can do 55 on that.\n\nOK. VO: 150 in total.\n\nBargain!\n\nWow!\n\nI'm spending my money like there's no tomorrow.\n\nDEALER: Good luck with them.\n\nIM: Thank you very much.\n\nIM: It was lovely to meet you.\n\nDEALER: And you.\n\nIM: See you later.\n\nDEALER: Bye.\n\nVO: And that's our shopping on this leg concluded.\n\nBack to the motor now, chaps.\n\nWell, that was a day, Mark.\n\nIt was, but you look very happy, smiling.\n\nSee?\n\nYou're rather cheery.\n\nWhat have you bought?\n\nOh, you wait and see.\n\nRight - pub.\n\nMH: Absolutely.\n\nSwift half.\n\nIM: No - cup of tea.\n\nMH: Pff, boring!\n\nIM: It's gonna be a long night.\n\nMH: (CHUCKLES) (GASPS) Oh, my God!\n\nLook at that fire engine.\n\nThat is fantastic!\n\nMH: What a beautiful thing!\n\nNow, that's how to make an arrival.\n\nOK, I'm moving... We're moving... (GEARS CRUNCH) MH: Oh God!\n\nWhen I get in gear, we're moving forward.\n\nWe're leaving the fire engine behind.\n\n(CHUCKLES) Oh!\n\nVO: Who needs a fire engine when you have the little Herald?\n\nSweet.\n\nNighty-night.\n\nAnd so, here we are.\n\nAuction day at last.\n\nBedford is the setting for our saleroom showdown.\n\nHow are you feeling?\n\nI'm actually kind of, you know, excited.\n\nIM: (GROANS) Come on, let's get this sorted.\n\nVO: Indeed.\n\nIt's time to face the music at W&H Peacock.\n\nThere's no going back now.\n\nThis place is teeming with bidders and there's online bidding, too.\n\nRunning the rostrum today is Lindsay Taylor.\n\nMark spent practically every penny he has on his five lots.\n\nWhat do you reckon, Lindsay?\n\nLINDSAY: We've had a huge amount of interest in the Routemaster destination signs for this sale.\n\nThe market for any transport items is really good at the moment and this sale's going online and there's lots of people all around the country that would love these - especially those in Essex, where most of these are based.\n\nSo I think these are going to do really, really well, today.\n\nVO: That will be music to Mark's ears.\n\nIrita splurged three times as much as Mark on her five lots.\n\nLindsay?\n\nLINDSAY: The lay figure of the horse is my particular favorite.\n\nIt's a lovely-looking item, it's articulated.\n\nIt's going to appeal to equestrian buyers, artists, and it's just a really good standout piece in any modern home today.\n\nVO: Fabulous!\n\nTime to take our places.\n\nIM: Oh, my goodness!\n\nMH: Oh, my goodness!\n\nHow are you feeling?\n\nNervy.\n\nVO: Here we go.\n\nIt's Irita's miner's head under the hammer first.\n\nLINDSAY: Who's got £20, start me?\n\nMH: 20?\n\nLINDSAY: £20.\n\n10 to get on, then.\n\n10 is bid.\n\nAt 10.\n\nAt 10.\n\nI have £10 now.\n\nIt's the lady's bid at 10.\n\n12 online.\n\nAt 12 now.\n\nLINDSAY: 14.\n\nMH: 10?\n\nIn the room here now at 14.\n\nI have £14.\n\nAnd 16.\n\nFeel like I need to hide and pretend it's not mine.\n\n£20.\n\n22.\n\n22.\n\nJust sneaked in there.\n\n24.\n\n24 is bid now.\n\nAt £24.\n\nThis plaster bust selling online, then.\n\nAt £24.\n\nVO: Not the best start.\n\nA MINER £14 loss.\n\nHa!\n\nI didn't dig myself out of a hole, though, Mark.\n\nHeh-heh-heh!\n\nSee what you did there!\n\nVO: Mark's Wedgwood glass candleholder is next.\n\nAny interest at 20, then?\n\n20 to get on.\n\nMH: 20?\n\nIM: Oh, no, she hasn't got it.\n\nMy commission takes it now...
