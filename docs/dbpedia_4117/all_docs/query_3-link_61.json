I had heard rumours that Tony Bianchi was going to call it a day, and maybe this is now underway. With the two seat Spit finally finished in the summer, perhaps this represents the completion of the last major project. I shame if this is the case, as in the glory years there was a huge volume of fascinating aeroplanes passing through Booker, not to mention Aces High, Magnificent Men, and the other movie stuff.",

That's is how it worked out.\n\nNew\n\nI went to Booker from Stroud - my mum drove me (!) - aged 18 to ask Tony Bianchi for a job. He was friendly enough, sat me down in his office and asked 'What can you actually DO?'. I hadn't thought to prepare an answer for that one! Still, he let me go for a wander around the hangar afterwards..\n\nNew\n\nI used to cycle there from Amersham aged about 13 ( so many hills! ) and just hang around and chat when possible.\n\nAlan Chalkley once spent 15 minutes or so explaining all about the Popjoy engine on his beautiful Comper Swift G-ACTF, which was very kind, as it was more likely you would to told to clear off if the PPS staff spotted you.\n\nWhat would Alan have thought if I had had said to him '' See you in 40 years, when I will come to your strip in Wales, and fly away the Piper Cub which you have owned for half a century'' . That's is how it worked out.\n\nWhile not directly part of PPS, Alan Chalkley was, and remains, a brilliant ambassador for the LAA and Vintage Aircraft Club. I'm glad to add that, after our delivery flight, G-ASPS continues to give lots of new converts their first experience of vintage flying.\n\nNew\n\nI remember that, as a callow planespotting youth, I was chased out of the hangars at Booker, more than once, when wanting to see the latest PPS project. That was forty and more years ago. Happy days!\n\n..... and then, someone in the planspotting fraternity (it's funny how one tended to bump into the same people at all the aerodromes within about a 50 mile radius of London) said: 'oh, if you want to get into the hangars at Booker you have to write and ask for an appointment'. I did. I remember a very courteous reply, offering me an appointment and telling me to whom I had to report. I duly arrived at the appointed time and was given a guided tour of the hangars, accompanied by an explanation of the PPS projects and other aeroplanes there, by someone who seemed willing to give me as much of his time as I wanted. I still have the photographs that I took that day. I wonder if that would happen today (and here I am speaking generally, rather than by reference to PPS)? Would the request receive a response? If it did, would it be rejected out of hand - or at least on H&S grounds? Sometimes I believe, firmly, that the past is a foreign country : they do things differently there.\n\nNew\n\nA lot of history with PPS over the years but I guess there will always be a time for us all to retire and why not.\n\nPPS thank you for all the work you have done over the decades and I am sure vintage aircraft scene would have quite a few less aeroplanes if not for your company.\n\nHappy retirement\n\nNew\n\nI paid several visits there when I lived in the general area in the late '60's, early '70's. I was particularly interested in the Mosquito PR34 which PPS overhauled for Kermit Weekes. A great pity that, after it was ferried across the Atlantic, he pushed it into a hangar and it never flew again. Guess it is too far gone to be flyable now, which is a real shame as PPS had made a great job of it.\n\nNew\n\nI think PPS prepped 2 Mosquitos for flights to the USA, the first being RS709, which Neil Williams almost lost in a scary overshoot at Booker. After that, they did all the test flights at Benson, just down the road. RS 712 also did its shake down flights from Benson in 1986.\n\nRS709 returned to the UK , to Blackbushe for Doug Arnold, but in 1983, went BACK to the USA , for good this time.\n\nMirisch Films Ltd, Bovington, July 11, 1963-1964.\n\n- Registered as G-ASKA.\n\n- Flew in movie 633 Squadron at Bovington, July 1963.\n\n-- Flew as HR113/HT-D/G.\n\nT.G.

I for one would love to read that.\n\nNow that would be an interesting read.\n\nFor many years there was a Spitfire lurking in the corner of the hangar. Is it still there?\n\nI visited PPS around 2006 when AR213 was being rebuilt. At the time a Tempest was under construction for Kermit Weeks. Has that project continued/moved on?\n\nNew"
