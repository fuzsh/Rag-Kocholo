The diocese was founded on December 20 1878 when the Diocese of Beverley, which had covered all of Yorkshire, was divided. Today, the diocese covers an area of 4,000 sq km in the historic counties of North Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire, together with the city of York. Bishop of Middlesbrough the Rt Rev Bishop Terence Patrick Drainey provides Catholic schools: â To help him as first educator of the diocese in his mission of making Christ known to all people. â To support parents who at their childâs baptism accepted the responsibility of raising their child in the Catholic faith. â To be at a service to their local church, parish and Christian home and to ensure our children give such service to the wider society.
