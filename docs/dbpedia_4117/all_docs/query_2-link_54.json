        "text": "Home\n\nSOLDIERS\n\nPrivate Georges-Henri Moffatt\n\nPrivate Georges-Henri Moffatt\n\nJoseph Georges-Henri Moffatt was born on April 19, 1922, he was the youngest of two boys. Georges-Henri and his older brother Rolland were raised by their parents, Georges Moffatt and Parmelia Despaties in Montreal, Canada. Georges-Henri attended Chomedey School and by the time he completed grade 7, he decided to leave school and secure employment in order to assist his family financially. From 1936 to 1940, Georges-Henri accepted a variety of job opportunities such as a messenger and apprentice printer along with several general labour positions.\n\nHe also was an usher at a local theatre before becoming an apprentice steamfitter and finally a machine operator at Noorduyn Aviation until his enlistment in the military. Georges-Henri was residing in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district of Montreal when a young girl named Rose-Blanche Lafrance caught his attention. After a short courtship, they decided to get married and the young couple exchanged wedding vows on July 25, 1942. It wasn’t long before they had their first daughter in 1943.\n\nWorld War 2 was in full momentum and Georges-Henri enlisted in the military on September 8, 1942 and was taken on strength with 4 District Depot in south Montreal. Shortly after, he transferred to another Depot in order to support wherever the military decided they needed him. It was during this time when Georges-Henri learned about a new exciting unit being formed and requested to be transferred to the Parachute Corps. He successfully passed all the aptitude screening, psychological interviews and rigorous physical testing. The next stage was to attend training at the parachute school in Fort Benning, Georgia, U.S.A. On January 16, 1943, Georges-Henri graduated from the parachute school and was now a proud member of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion. In April of 1943, Georges-Henri reported for duty at Shilo, Manitoba where he received additional training.\n\nGeorges-Henri was granted leave in June of 1943, and by July of the same year, he embarked to the UK, where he began training with the Battalion as part of the 6th Airborne Division in preparation for Operation Overlord. Georges-Henri was assigned a position in Head Quarters for the operation. During the early morning of June 6, 1944, he parachuted into Normandy, however the plane carrying the soldiers missed the drop zone by many miles. Upon landing they were under heavy enemy contact and he received shrapnel in his right knee. On June 11, 1944, Georges-Henri was taken prisoner and a German medic removed the shrapnel from his knee. He was now a Prisoner of War at Oflag 79 and Dulagluft Weiszlar, Germany. Georges-Henri recalls he attempted to escape on March 22, 1945, however recaptured and received multiple merciless blows from the buttstock of a rifle to the face, head and wrist. Nonetheless, on March 25, 1945 after 9 months of being held in captivity, they were finally liberated. Georges-Henri was admitted to the hospital in Amersham on April 4, 1945, where he received x-rays and treatment for his injuries. The war was finally over for Georges-Henri, he returned to the UK, eventually making his way back to Canada and discharged on July 21, 1945.\n\nAfter the war, he returned home in Montreal where he worked for the Harbor. Since the harbour was closed in winters, he worked other jobs such a taxi driver and oil company delivery man. By the late 1950s, those extra jobs were no longer required once the St-Lawrence River was finally open to shipping circulation year-round. Georges-Henri and his wife Rose-Blanche continued to grow their family until they had 6 children. He and his wife remained by each other's side until he suffered a heart attack and died on October 23, 1973. If you have taken the time to read about World War II veteran Georges-Henri, then you have kept his memory alive.\n\nArtifacts and information Courtesy of Bernard Moffatt.\n\nPortrait studio picture of Private Joseph Georges Henri Moffatt, circa 1943\n\nPortrait studio picture of Private Joseph Georges Henri Moffatt.\n\nHonorary Service Retiring Card, issued by the International Association of Machinist.
