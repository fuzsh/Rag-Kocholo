        "text": "Despite popular belief there was never an officially named Chair Museum in Wycombe. From around 1875 a local lawyer, James Oliff Griffits, collected books and objects to create a general-interest ‘High Wycombe Museum and Library’. At this time, objects were collected on the grounds of general interest, rather than relevance to High Wycombe. This explains the presence in the collection of objects such as the Babylonian tablet and the Parisian velocipede, which have no specific local connection.\n\nSoon after the Museum opened in the 1930s, local chairs and tools were collected and displayed, reflecting the dominant local industry. As a result, the Museum would come to be known informally as ‘The Chair Museum’.\n\nThe Museum kept the name ‘High Wycombe Museum’ until the 1980s when the ‘High’ was dropped and it was renamed ‘Wycombe Local History and Chair Museum’ – to remind people that the collections cover local history from the wider Wycombe District, including Marlow, Stokenchurch and Princes Risborough. In the 1990s the Museum became simply ‘Wycombe Museum’. We are still Wycombe Museum but don’t mind if you prefer to call us The Chair Museum!\n\nThe Chair Making Museum was not in fact a formal Museum but the showroom and workshop of traditional furniture maker Stuart Linford, which he opened to the public. It included a display of Thames Valley Windsor Chairs. It is now closed but the displays have been taken over by Kraftinwood in High Wycombe.\n\nIn the 1870s James Oliff Griffits, a local lawyer, raised money for a free public library. The story goes that he held dinner parties where each guest brought a book or an object or a monetary donation. In 1875 he opened his library – with space to display some small objects – in Church Street, High Wycombe.\n\nIn 1917 Sir John Thomas of Wooburn, a paper mill owner, left land to the council for ‘a Public Museum and Art Gallery’, as well as some paintings which formed the basis of our art collection.\n\nIn 1929 the upper floors of the Library were set aside as a dedicated museum space and more objects started being donated. Fred Skull – an antiques dealer from a furniture-making family – was appointed Honorary Museum Curator.\n\nIn 1932, a new library/museum opened in Queen Victoria Road with an extension 5 years later.\n\nIn 1962, Wycombe Museum moved to its current home, Castle Hill House on Priory Avenue. The move was initially meant to be temporary, but we’re still here today!\n\nDifferent parts of Castle Hill House were built at different times, so there are a number of answers to this question. The oldest parts date back to the late 1600s, with the most recent parts added on around 1910.\n\nThe original house is believed to have been built between 1690-1720, and is at the rear of the Museum as it currently stands. The original house consisted of the kitchen, hallway and living room on the ground floor, a landing and two bedrooms on the first floor, and the attic which had extra bedrooms.\n\nAbout 200 years ago the flint fronted extension was added to give bigger rooms and a more impressive façade. These new rooms had higher ceilings which left no room for an attic at the front of the house. This is particularly noticeable in the Museum’s foyer, where the more recent front half has higher ceilings which then lower towards the staircase to the first floor, and is the reason our lift makes multiple stops on the two levels of the first floor. At the same time that the front extension was built, another was added for the servants’ use at the rear of the building – this is where the toilets are now.\n\nAbout 100 years ago the eastern end of the house was extended resulting in its current, lopsided, appearance.\n\nBefore Wycombe Museum moved to Castle Hill House, it was a family home. Some of the house’s residents were locally important, but not national figures.\n\nThe Shrimpton family, who were tenants here, provided a mayor 21 times for High Wycombe between 1699 and 1786.\n\nSamuel Welles, a member of the family who owned the house until 1808, was Mayor of High Wycombe 5 times. Although his family owned Castle Hill House, Welles never lived there himself.\n\nIn 1808 Samuel Nash, the Town Clerk, bought the house and lived in it.\n\nAfterwards it was owned by the Carrington family, who have ties to Wycombe Abbey School. The Carringtons leased the house to their land agents.\n\nJohn George Peace, another Mayor of High Wycombe, bought the property in 1892.\n\nFrom 1909 to 1962 the Clarke family owned the house. All 3 heads of the house – Daniel, Arthur and Roland Peace – were Mayors of High Wycombe.\n\nIn 1901, a wedding was taking place in the House grounds. It’s said that during the ceremony, workmen working on the driveway unearthed an old grave. Amongst the grave goods was an approximately 1,000-year-old golden Saxon pendant. Although the original is now kept by the British Museum, Wycombe Museum holds a replica of the pendant in our galleries.\n\nThe amount of truth in this story is unknown. While there was definitely a Saxon burial site and golden pendant discovered, it’s not known exactly where within the grounds they were found, or whether they could have been discovered during a wedding ceremony. In 1901 the boundaries of Castle Hill House’s grounds were not the same as they are today. Before the railway was built, the House’s driveway went right down the hill and came out at the bottom of Amersham Hill. When the railway came, the House’s driveway ran along the north of the railway and still came out in Amersham Hill, but just above the railway bridge. Priory Avenue was not made until about 1901 so were the workmen working “on the driveway” somewhere between the present gates and Amersham Hill? If men were working on the driveway, then how did guests get in and out of Castle Hill grounds for the wedding celebration?\n\nSadly, the exact location was not recorded, so these questions remain unanswered.\n\nThe motte, together with the rest of the grounds, was scheduled as an Ancient Monument by English Heritage (now Historic England) meaning it is of national importance. They declared it to be a Norman fortification called motte-and-bailey, probably dating to the 12th century period known as The Anarchy when Stephen and Matilda contested the English throne.\n\nThere are people in Wycombe who dispute the motte-and-bailey claims, and say it is a landscape garden feature, although this is also disputed. There have been several other suggested origins but, sadly, there is no conclusive proof as to what the motte is or is not. Mike Farley, former County Archaeologist, says that, until clear evidence is found, perhaps it should simply be called ‘The Mystery Mound’.\n\nA Windsor chair is, most simply, a stool with a back added. It refers to how a chair is constructed, rather than to a particular design.\n\nRead our blog post What is a Windsor Chair here\n\nWindsor chairs have never been produced in Windsor. They were named ‘Windsor chairs’ by at least the early 1700s, which was long before High Wycombe became a centre for chair production. This would only begin to happen 100 years later. Windsor was where chairs made in the surrounding area were loaded onto river barges for transporting to London. This is almost certainly how Windsor chairs got their name.\n\nBodgers produced all the parts of chairs that were turned on pole-lathes – including the legs, stretchers, arms and rods. They would work in woods around Wycombe, close to their homes. Bodger is an informal name for these turners and it doesn’t appear to have become common until the early twentieth century. They never called themselves bodgers. When they had to record their job, they always used the more correct word ‘turner’.\n\nIt’s not possible to know exactly where the name came from – one idea is that it has links with the idea of a ‘bodged job’, and was a derogatory term used by workers in furniture factories when referring to men who worked in the woods. Or it may simply refer to men who produced incomplete chair parts, leaving the factory workers to produce the finished product.\n\nTraditionally, a mayor was weighed at the beginning and end of their term to make sure that they had not ‘grown fat’ at the expense of the people of Wycombe. It has in recent years become more of a ceremonial tradition. The date of the first mayor weighing in High Wycombe is unknown, but in John Parker’s history of Wycombe (1878) he claims that this tradition had fallen into disuse since the dissolution of the old Corporation in 1835. There are no other known references to the tradition.\n\nMayor weighing is almost unique to High Wycombe – in 1951, mayor weighting was adopted by Minneapolis in America.\n\nThe association between Buckinghamshire, its towns, and the swan starts from around 1444, when Humphrey sixth Earl of Stafford became Duke of Buckingham. The swan was his personal crest. However, the direct link to High Wycombe is not known. The crown that accompanies the swan on the emblem of High Wycombe is said to come from the belief that High Wycombe owes its allegiance to no one but the crown.\n\nThere are differences between the Buckinghamshire swan crest and the High Wycombe swan crest. While they both derive from the Duke of Buckingham’s crest, the Buckinghamshire county swan almost always has its wings open, whilst the High Wycombe swan’s wings are almost always closed.\n\nThe Domesday Book is a record of the 1086 Great Survey, that was undertaken in much of England and parts of Wales, as ordered by William the Conqueror. There is an entry for High Wycombe (then Wicumun), which includes these details:\n\nPopulation: 60 ‘very large’ households – 40 villagers, 8 smallholders, 8 slaves & 4 boors.\n\nPloughland: Land for 30 ploughs – 3 lord’s plough teams & 27 men’s plough teams.\n\nOther resources: Meadow – 3 ploughs. Woodland – 500 pigs. Mills – 6.\n\nA ‘boor’ was the lowest grade of peasant, but above a slave. A ‘plough’ was a measure of land, determined by what could be ploughed by a team of 8 oxen in a day."
