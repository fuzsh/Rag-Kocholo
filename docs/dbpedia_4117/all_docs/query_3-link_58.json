        "text": "A picturesque village in England has recently been given the unfortunate title of the smelliest.\n\nChalfont St Giles, which is also known as the Best Kept Village in Buckinghamshire, stinks of sewage.\n\nThe stench reached new heights in June (you know, back when we had a few days of summer) and the heat made the foul smell even worse, The Telegraph reports.\n\nBut the nostrils belonging to the village’s population, which is roughly 4,700, have to suffer the smell constantly.\n\nSo, where is the village and what is being done about the stench?\n\nWhere is Chalfont St Giles?\n\nThe tiny village is located in Buckinghamshire, and is around 25 miles northwest of central London by car.\n\nIt is in a group of villages called The Chalfonts, which also includes Chalfont St Peter and Little Chalfont.\n\nWhy is Chalfont St Giles so stinky?\n\nLocals initially thought the smell was due to stagnant water in a floodplain. But it later became apparent that Thames Water had been dumping raw sewage into the River Misbourne, which runs through the village’s centre.\n\nOverflow tanks used to control the flow of wastewater, which leads into the River Misbourne, had a ‘storm overflow discharge’ in January, which only ceased at the end of June this year.\n\nA spokesperson for Thames Water said: ‘Our monitor at our Amersham storm tanks site is now publishing this data for the public to see and while all discharges are unacceptable, the sewage system was historically designed to work in this way, to prevent sewage backing up into people’s homes.’\n\nHow has the stench affected Chalfont St Giles?\n\nThe river footpath, a children’s play area and a duck pond have been closed. The parish has also been forced to pull out of the 2024 Best Kept Village competition because of the funk in the air.\n\n‘The stench of sewage permeates the village’, said Chalfont St Giles Parish Council.\n\nWhat is being done about the stench?\n\nThames Water has apologised and said the region experienced the ‘eighth wettest winter on record’ which led to high groundwater and river levels. A spokesperson also confirmed engineers are using filter units at the overflow tanks to ‘minimise the impact to the river’.\n\nLet’s hope the foul stench will soon become a distant memory…\n\nDo you have a story to share?\n\nGet in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.\n\nMORE : July 4 shooting at Yellowstone National Park leaves one dead and ranger injured\n\nMORE : I am concerned about the climate crisis – who should I vote for in the General Election?\n\nMORE : Packet of Walkers crisps from nearly 30 years ago found intact"
