The companion View of the Colosseum is handled in much the same way.\r\n\r\nThe ancient structures are given new life by Rome's inhabitants--strolling gentlemen contemplating the antiquities, perhaps the tourists who will purchase such paintings as this, and gypsies and peasants who simply make the ruins their home.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 410, pp. 520-521.",
