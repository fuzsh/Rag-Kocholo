        "text": "The Goodman Fraud was massive, one of the problems was that sometimes real people got given different personas with ficititious wives, but then sometimes they got linked to authentic genealogies entered by others. It's been a real labour for those who have worked on in to try to unentangle this; almost inevitably some profiles will as the label says be correct but were affected by being linked to the fraudulent ones.\n\nRe Tobias.\n\nThe will is of a Richard Saunders, he was a miller according to his will.What struck me is that it didn't sound like the will of a man who had been in possession of The Bury (I lived in Chesham and know the area quite well)\n\nThe date of death on the profile of Saunders-39 (https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Saunders-39 ;the unlinked Richard Saunders) corresponds with the will and the burial in Chesham of Richard Saunders, the Miller in 1629 If this was his burial and will, then he would be the father of Tobias.\n\nHowever, I think that Saunders-39's death date is incorrect and that he died much earlier, dying in October 1601 leaving a very brief non cupative brief will . Richard Saunders owned 'the Bury' in Chesham but I think he was living at Dinton when he died. He was the husband of an Elizabeth (Blount) They were an armigerous family and appear in the 1623 Visitation of Buckinghamshire\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/visitationofcoun5859byuphil/page/110/mode/2up/search/Saunders\n\nPROB 11/98/451\n\nDescription: Will of Richarde Saunders of Dinton, Buckinghamshire\n\nDate: 28 November 1601 This is on Ancestry and basically leaves everything to be divided between his wife Elizabeth an his children.\n\nThese are the entries from the National Archives Catalogue that suggested to me that Saunders-39 was the man who died in 1601 not 1629\n\n2) Reference: C 2/JasI/H35/74\n\nDescription: Short title: Hoddesden v Pope.\n\nPlaintiffs: Sir Christopher Hoddesden and Elizabeth Hoddesden his wife.\n\nDefendants: Sir Thomas Pope Blunt.\n\nSubject: lands in Pitchcott, Buckinghamshire, settled on plaintiff Elizabeth Hoddesden by Richard Saunders her former husband, and rectory of Donnington [Dinton], Buckinghamshire, in lieu of lands in Ruislip, Middlesex.\n\nLastly ,the old Dictionary of National Biography states that Sir Christopher Hoddeston who died in 1611 took as his second wife\n\n\"Elizabeth, daughter of William Blount of Olbaston, Leicestershire, whom he made his sole executrix, and by whom he had no issue.W\n\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hoddesdon,_Christopher_(DNB01)\n\nObviously this needs double checking.\n\nIf I am correct then a Tobias was the son of Richard Saunders the Miller who died in May, 1629 and was buried in Chesham but this was not the armigerous Richard Sanders with whom he was originally linked\n\n(hope this makes sense,)"
