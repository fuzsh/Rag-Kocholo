Amersham Old Town is popular with visitors and locals alike, the town has a wide sweeping High Street, half timbered buildings, picturesque period cottages and a wonderful selection of exclusive designer and craft shops.

Old Town attractions include the award-winning Amersham Museum, housed in a building dating from the mid 15th century, The Market Hall, which dates from 1682, St. Mary's Parish Church and the Memorial Gardens.

Historically, Amersham was once a centre for the Lollards, a religious movement following John Wycliffe.

They first arrived dating the 14th century and preached barefoot in the streets.

By the 16th century, the movement was taking over the town and many followers were burned at the stake.

Their memory lives on in the Martyrs Memorial, off Station Road.

Old Amersham has a plentiful supply of fine restaurants and coaching inns including The Kings Arms and The Crown Hotel, both recently used as locations for the hit movie Four Weddings and a Funeral.

Amersham-On-The-Hill is the modern part of Amersham often referred to by locals as Top Amersham, containing the main shopping centre, library and Chiltern Pools.
