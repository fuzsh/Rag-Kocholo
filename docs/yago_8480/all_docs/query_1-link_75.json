        "text": "by Jim Denney, author of Walt’s Disneyland\n\nMany Disneyland shops and attractions have come and gone. From 1955 to 1990, Main Street had a cigar shop called Fine Tobacco, between the Magic Shop and the Main Street Cinema. It sold cigars, cigarettes, pipes, and loose tobacco, and gave away free matchbooks. The cigar shop is gone, but the wooden Indian that stood outside remains.\n\nOne shop you’d probably not expect in Walt’s original Disneyland is a place to buy bras, lingerie, and torsolettes. But when Disneyland opened in 1955, there stood the Intimate Apparel Shop, presented by the Hollywood-Maxwell Brassiere Compay of Los Angeles. Not only could you purchase unmentionables there, but you could learn the immodest history of underthings in the shop’s modest museum.\n\nThe shop’s genial host was “The Wizard of Bras,” a mechanical figure that gave a recorded lecture on underwear. Some Disney historians say “The Wizard of Bras” was the earliest Disneyland robot, though it wasn’t as sophisticated as later Audio-Animatronic figures.\n\nThe Intimate Apparel Shop was on the east side of the street, just beyond the Silhouette Studio. While all the other shops on Main Street fronted against the “build-to line,” the Victorian façade of the Intimate Apparel Shop was set back from the street. It’s the only shop on Main Street with a front porch.\n\nThe shop closed in January 1956 after six months in operation. The door was sealed in 1959, and is now locked and unmarked. The space the shop once occupied is now part of the China Closet next door. The porch still offers a bench and two chairs where you can sit, rest, and watch people go by.\n\nAbove the former shop is a window honoring Imagineer Roland Fargo “Rolly” Crump, who helped create the Enchanted Tiki Room, The Haunted Mansion, and “it’s a small world.” The window reads, “Fargo’s Palm Parlor — Predictions That Will Haunt You — Bazaar, Whimsical & Weird — Designs to Die For — Roland F. Crump — Assistant to the Palm Reader.” (The word “Bazaar” is a deliberate pun, not a typo; it refers to Rolly’s work on the Adventureland Bazaar.)\n\nJim Denney is a writer with more than a 150 books to his credit, including the Timebenders science-fantasy series for young readers (Battle Before Time, Doorway to Doom, Invasion of the Time Troopers, and Lost in Cydonia), the highly regarded 2004 biography of Walt Disney, How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Disney Magic Every Day of Your Life (written with Pat Williams, co-founder of the Orlando Magic), and Lead Like Walt: Discover Walt Disney’s Magical Approach to Building Successful Organizations (written with Pat Williams).\n\nJim Denney’s REVISED and UPDATED Walt’s Disneyland: It’s Still There If You Know Where to Look, is available on Amazon.com for just:\n\n$15.99 paperback"
