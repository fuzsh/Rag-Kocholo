As a revolution, the Prague Spring failed, suffocated by the Soviet tanks, but it also gave birth to a whole spate of remarkable films. One of them, Closely Watched Trains, has just been issued in the DVD format by The Criterion Collection, and 35 years later after the movie first played theaters, it still looks damn good."
