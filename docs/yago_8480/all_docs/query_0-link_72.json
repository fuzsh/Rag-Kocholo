        "text": "This film stands not only as one of the most accomplished films that Jan Kadar and Elmar Klos would create, but also as one of the most highly regarded Eastern European films of the 1960s. When a carpenter becomes the \"Aryan comptroller\" of a button shop owned by an elderly Jewish woman in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, his allegiances are tested. The filmâ€™s tragic subject is carefully combined with a comic tone, and the result is this oft-praised winner of the 1965 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film."
