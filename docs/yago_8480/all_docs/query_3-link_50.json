        "text": "The wood Draper Block was built circa 1820 as a Federal period two story home on the Essex Turnpike which was constructed in 1806-9. The original hip roof, pictured in the center in the period photo was converted to the large gable end style in 1869-70 when Warren F. Draper began the remodeling the old house into a business block during the summer of 1869.\n\nSept. 7, 1866 Andover Advertiser - William F. Draper has hired the shop on Main Street, recently occupied by Mr. John H. Dean, & is fitting it up for a book store……#41 Main Street\n\nOct. 12, 1866 – Removal - The subscriber has removed to the store recently occupied by John H. Dean, nearly opposite the Post Office, on Main St. where he will keep all school books used in the several academies and schools in town., together with a general assortment of standard and miscellaneous books and a large variety of stationary, etc. WM. F. Draper.\n\nDraper’s book store was the Andover Bookstore founded in 1809 and its branch publishing house the Andover Press established in 1813 by Flagg & Gould. Deacon Mark Newman was the original owner and his son Mark H. Newman became a partner of the Press Co. in 1833 under the name of Gould & Newman until 1841. Then Allen & Wardwell 1841-1847, W. H. Wardwell 1847-48, Flagg & Wardwell 1848-1849, and then W. F. Draper in 1849 purchased both businesses. In June 1866 the Andover Book Store near the Theological Seminary and the Job Printing office were offered for sale. On September 1, 1866 W.F. Draper & Co. dissolved the partnership with W. H. Halliday and moved his bookstore down to the center of town from the brick building on the Hill. Draper first rented the store space formerly occupied by John Dean’s Gents store in Swift’s building at 41-44 Main St. before purchasing the residence next door to the north.\n\nOn April 15, 1868 Draper purchased the house from Henry W. Abbott., Apr. 24, 1868 AA – “Abbott has sold his real estate on Main Street, second south of the bank building, to Warren F. Draper. It is understood the Mr. Draper will fit up the house for a book store and printing establishment”. On May 8, 1868 the paper reports, “W.F.

F. Draper is about to make extreme alterations to his establishment on Main St. M. L. Ramsdell, who has occupied a part of it for a fancy goods & confectionary store, is consequently obliged to shut up shop for a while. Ramsdell later moved his shop to Hyde Park by Dec. 24, 1869 but continued as a Singer Sewing Machine traveling agent with business connections through John H. Dean at 44 Main St. in 1871.\n\nSept. 17, 1869 AA - Wm. F. Draper is enlarging and improving his building formerly owned by H. W. Abbott on Main Street. The main structure is to be raised twelve feet, making it 3 stories his in front and four in the rear. Besides providing himself with ample accommodations for his book and printing business he will finish a commodious and convenient store to let. The lower story will stand two feet higher on the street than formerly, which will not only look much better, but greatly improve the sidewalk for pedestrians. The work is done by W. S. Jenkins and the masonry work by E. C. Upton.\n\nOn April 29, 1870 AA - Draper advertises, “a commodious, convenient, and central store, and several other valuable rooms in his building on Main street”\n\n“New Store to Let, situated on Main Street opposite the Town House, the best location in town. The store is 21 feet wide, having two bay windows, and 40 feet deep with a basement under, and a cellar below that. The store is ready for shelving, and will be fitted up to suit the occupant, if applied for immediately.” Also to let, in the second story of the same building, six very well lighted commodious rooms, suitable for offices and many kinds of business.”\n\nDraper moved into his new store at #37 in mid August 1870. The paper described it as very convenient and tasteful book store, publishing house and printing office. His advertisement states he has a full supply of text books for the Academies and Schools.\n\nA fire at Elm Square May 26th 1870 (site of Memorial Hall Library to Pearson St.) totally destroyed the businesses and residences of several tradesmen. Abbott & Smith Furniture store reopened for business in the new store at #33 by June 10th becoming Draper’s first tenant. Charles Mayers Harness Shop, also burned out, was reported to have moved first to the Swift building, then to Draper’s basement in August and in October his advertisement changes location to the Barnard Block.
