Since the post comes with a salary and standing in the town's corrupt hierarchy, Tono wrestles with greed and guilt as he and Rozalie gradually befriend each other. When the authorities order all Jews in town to be rounded up, Tono faces a moral dilemma unlike any he's known before.",

What a brilliant combination... like peas and carrots.\n\nThere's something about a busy street scene that I really appreciate. How a crew can accommodate what would have been a massive unit of a camera in the midst of all the hustle and bustle of hundreds of people and yet retain interesting perspectives, technically perfect composition and manage to not have all the kids stare directly into the lens while doing it. It's really quite incredible.\n\nAt the beginning of the the film, we are treated to a quite stunning view of the…\n\n***One of the best 150 films I have ever seen.***\n\nThe ones that have actually dared to go deep enough into the world of cinema have surely realized of the fact that the Seventh Art can be one of the most extraordinary wonders if one is willing to look for lost masterworks scattered worldwide. Unfortunately, classic art cinema is not disseminated in my country as much as I would wish, and Obchod na Korze was a film which I had an enormous luck of discovering on television one day after midnight. That's right: I discovered it being aired after midnight. That's one of the best nights I have spent alone staying up late. Was it worth it? Instead of exaggerating…\n\nI often get asked why this modern piece of shit or that completely offensive puddle of garbage is included in my Do Not Watch List, and my answer will always and forever be that I have no time to waste sniffing cinema's wretched taint fumes when so many classic masterpieces remain unwatched.\n\nAnd not only by myself, but by so many others, as well. Scarcely 3,000 Letterboxd users have seen this movie, and yet steaming new turd piles get 20 times that many views simply because they are new. It's almost as if a whole lot of film viewers aren't actually making their own decisions on what to watch, and are simply watching whatever god-awful piss sandwich is throw in…\n\nIn the mirror, he stands up slowly from his chair. Some object rests beneath his feet, making it look in the reflection as if he is floating somehow. As he stands, his head is bent down, giving it an odd, limp look. For a moment, it appears as if he has hung himself. It's a startling image because it makes no sense in that moment, but later, this brief moment, seemingly accidental, is revealed as prophetic. When Tono finally hangs himself, we never see his body. The chair falls, the noose is tied, and so on, but no, no body is shown. It cuts to a dream fantasy to end things. That earlier image serves as our warning, our visual cue, our sight of his death, subtly inserted into one of the many conversations that forewarn us of doom, that tell us the Nazis will not be stopped and no one we see here will be saved.\n\nLittle over half hour in and I thought this was going to be a charming \"slice of life\" slow cinema affair where the local peasants thumb their noses at the Nazi regime by pulling the wool over their eyes. Similar to the high jinks found in 1969's The Secret of Santa Vittoria.\n\nThis truly uniformed assumption made the last act all the more shocking! This is why going in blind makes for a better and more honest first impression. So if you haven't seen The Shop on Main Street before what are you waiting for.. an engraved invitation lol Skedaddle! Nothing to see here. Hurry back when you've finished your exquisite viewing.\n\nAs it turns out the characters and storyline…\n\nI’d put off watching this film for yonks because I imagined it to be a sombre examination of national guilt over Slovakia’s collaboration with the Nazi’s in WWII, and somehow, I just never felt in the mood. It’s an examination of Slovakian guilt alright, but I was pleasantly surprised how even-handed it is in loving and condemning its countrymen and women, and how finely it balances the tragic with the comic, and the insidious with the bucolic. I knew it was made during the Czechoslovakian New Wave, but I couldn’t imagine the stylish playfulness that is so characteristic of the films of that era being translated into a story about the Holocaust. But how brilliantly it succeeds!\n\nThe lightness with…\n\nI wonder why this beautiful film isn't talked about more. It deserves to be. This one rocked me, I expected it to be good but this good.... no. I had no clue what I was in for\n\nWhat is worth more.... money and a sense of belonging or being a decent honest person? When a down oh his luck man, Tono, is offered to be Aryan controller of a small button shop owned by an old feeble Jewish lady he jumps at the opportunity. He finally will make some real people and pull him and his wife out of the muck. His brother in law offers the job, a man Tono is jealous of. He's jealous of his lifestyle but…"
