        "text": "When he learned that The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze) received a nomination for a prestigious Oscar, he decided to travel to America and represent Czechoslovakia.\n\nLegendary actor Jozef Kroner, who portrayed \"Aryan overseer\" and carpenter Tóno Brtko in the film, got four suits tailored for the Oscars. It cost him 17,000 Czechoslovak crowns, which was a huge amount of money in the sixties.\n\nIn the end, however, the Czechoslovak communists did not allow him to leave for America, and he was left behind at the airport, tailored suits all packed.\n\nThe only Oscar-winning film from Slovakia\n\nThe Shop on Main Street remains the only Slovak film awarded the prestigious statuette. The win in the best foreign language film category occurred over a half century ago, in 1966.\n\nIt was, however, a great success that the film was made at all, considering the conditions of the country at the time."
