At the end of the street, the world-renowned Disneyland marching band appears in full regalia.\n\n2 - Meet Me Down on Main Street - Disneyland USA 04:13\n\nIn 1956, a short-subject theatrical release shot in full Technicolor and widescreen Cinemascope was produced as part of Walt Disney's \"People and Places\" documentary series. A highlight of this travelogue was an extensive tour of Main Street USA's many sights and sounds from the vantage point of an early 1900's Horse-Drawn Street Car.\n\n3 - Meet Me Down on Main Street - The Mellomen Quartet 04:52\n\nThis well-known Disney quartet perform, in barbershop harmony, a song that originated from a 1950 Donald Duck cartoon entitled, \"Crazy Over Daisy\", which was set during the Gay Nineties era. A few years later, the song was recycled, new lyrics were added and it became the official theme song of Main Street USA.\n\n4 - Horseless Carriage - Main Street Sightseeing Tour 01:42\n\nAboard an antique horseless carriage, actor Robert Cummings took one of the very first sightseeing tours down Main Street USA during its grand opening ceremonies in 1955. As he and his family motored down the thoroughfare, he pointed out the many turn of the century shops, attractions and other points of interest along the way.\n\n5 - The Sounds of America - Main Street Montage 09:13\n\nIn 1961, the Bell Telephone Hour television program presented an hour long musical celebration of \"The Sounds of America\" as found in Disneyland USA. The program featured many of the unique sounds found along Main Street, and for the show's grand finale, a rousing musical number further highlighted this happy hometown avenue.\n\n6 - Main Street USA Attraction Preview - Jack Wagner 01:56\n\nJack Wagner provides an insightful attraction preview of all the many exciting sights and sounds to be found along Main Street USA, including descriptions of all the vintage modes of transportation found here, and a run-down of all the live entertainment offerings that can be enjoyed up and down this colorful avenue.\n\n7 - Cast Member Orientation - Main Street USA 07:42\n\nAfter newly hired cast members are fully inducted into the \"Disney Way\" of providing the highest quality in guest service, they are then assigned to their individual on-stage roles. Each area of the park requires unique training, and special knowledge. To facilitate this, multi-media presentations, narrated by Jack Wagner, provided a thorough orientation.\n\n8 - Everyone's Hometown - Main Street USA 01:10\n\nMain Street was first inspired Walt Disney's personal memories of his childhood home in Marceline, Missouri, but much of its architecture is based on Imagineer John Hench's boyhood home of Fort Collins, Colorado. But essentially Main Street was meant to represent everyone's hometown, a true composite of early 20th century America.\n\n9 - A Day at Disneyland - Main Street USA 03:14\n\nIn 1980 Walt Disney Home Entertainment released a 30 minute video souvenir of The Happiest Place on Earth. This was sold at retail locations throughout Disneyland and available for home rental at video stores nationwide. The tour began on Main Street, and featured all the colorful sights and sounds of the early 20th century thoroughfare.\n\n10 - Mickey Mouse Club Newsreel: Horse-Drawn Street Cars 01:48\n\nThe classic 1950's children's television series, \"The Mickey Mouse Club,\" featured a segment which mirrored theatrical newsreels from that period. The news reports were for kids, and by kids, often covering stories about Disneyland, including this informative segment about the Disneyland pony farm and the Horse-Drawn Street Cars.\n\n11 - Horse-Drawn Street Cars - The Trolley Song 03:39\n\nAt one time, Disneyland had many horse-powered modes of transportation. There were surreys and a horse-drawn fire wagon on Main Street, and in Frontierland there were stagecoaches and Conestoga wagons. Today the only remaining attraction featuring equestrians is the Horse Drawn Street Cars, a Disneyland favorite for over 64 years.\n\n12 - Main Street Omnibus 07:16\n\nDisneyland's colorful double-decker Omnibus is a great way to see the sights along Main Street USA. This one-way trip between Town Square and Central Plaza is navigated by a friendly and informative bus driver, who provides a brief guided tour, pointing out the many areas of interest found up and down the boulevard.\n\n13 - The Disneyland Band - King Mickey March 01:50\n\nThe Disneyland Band has been performing up and down Main Street USA since the day Disneyland first opened. At any given moment, this colorful marching ensemble may appear following the growing resonance of a marching drum. They will often perform the King Mickey March on their way to Town Square for an afternoon concert.\n\n- Main Street USA - Area Background Music -\n\nIn Disneyland, the air is filled with the enchantment of song, and of all the themed lands, Main Street USA may be the most musical of all. The atmosphere music heard up and down Main Street includes a collection of popular songs authentic to the gaslight era, recognizable standards from famous Broadway hits, and beloved showtunes from classic Walt Disney motion-picture musicals, each set during the same romantic period.\n\n18 - Main Street USA - Area Music Alternates 1:10:38\n\nPerhaps the most beloved background music in Disneyland is the Main Street area loop. Many are unfamiliar with the origins of these songs, and even more are unfamiliar with the lyrics. Here is a collection of original or alternate versions of these catchy tunes, complete with vocals, so now you can sing along as you stroll down the avenue.\n\n19 - The Gift Shop Song 04:21\n\nAside from exciting attractions, beautiful theming and scenery, and one-of-a-king dining experiences, Disneyland is world renowned as a shopaholic's paradise. In fact, many consider Main Street to be the very first \"shopping mall,\" essentially serving as the prototype for the boom in commercial shopping centers that soon spread nationwide.\n\n20 - Main Street Emporium - Area Background Music 1:01:11\n\nPositioned at the corner of Main Street and Town Square is the largest store in all of Disneyland. Here at the Emporium guests can find almost any kind of Disney themed memento imaginable. Providing period appropriate musical atmosphere are selected orchestral arrangements of recognizable songs by the King of Ragtime, Scott Joplin.\n\n21 - Main Street Emporium - Atmosphere & Background Music 20:06\n\nThe Disneyland Emporium occupies nearly an entire block on the western side of Main Street. This is the busiest store in all of Disneyland, and the mood is always lively. Inside this massive mercantile, the clicking and clanging of cash registers is nearly as melodious as the Victorian era parlor music used as background accompaniment.\n\n22 - Main Street Emporium - Enchanted Windows 14:11\n\nIt has been a long tradition to display vignettes from Disney's animated classics in the storefront windows of the Main Street Emporium. Here too, scenes from new theatrical releases are used to promote the latest animated offerings. In 2015 this tradition returned with new transforming displays featuring further scenes from classic Disney films.\n\n23 - Main Street Emporium Area Music - Disneyland Paris 1:08:23\n\nWhen Disneyland Paris premiered, one unique aspect of the new park was its extensive use of area music. All outdoor areas, attraction queues, restaurants and gift shops had their own specific playlist of theme appropriate music. This also had a positive effect on the US parks, inspiring the instillation of new loops throughout the original Disneyland.\n\n24 - The Storybook Store - Area Background Music 52:44\n\nInside the Crystal Arcade, which is part of the Main Street Emporium complex, the Storybook Store offers Disney themed children's books, music, toys and stuffed animals. The wonderful music used as a backdrop for this colorful shop appropriately comes directly from many of Walt Disney's classic motion picture soundtracks.\n\n25 - Music Man Medley - Area Background Music 06:07\n\nMeredith Wilson's classic American musical, \"The Music Man\", is set in the same time and place as Disneyland's early 20th century thoroughfare, so it is only fitting that several songs from this Tony Award winning score be featured on Main Street. Wilson himself had visited Disneyland in 1959, and led a real marching band of 76 trombones.\n\n26 - Wurlitzer Music Store - Player Piano 1:11:32\n\nFor the better of two decades, the Wonderland Music Store was a prominent feature of Main Street's eastern corner building, facing Town Square. On display were dozens of Wurlitzer keyboard instruments including everything from grand pianos to modern electric organs, as well as a fully operational, restored antique player piano.\n\n27 - Wonderland Music Store - Disneyland Records 45:36\n\nRight next door to the Wurlitzer Music Store was the Wonderland Music Store, which sold a selection of albums produced by Disneyland Records. Many of the records found here included content from Disneyland the park, including attraction soundtracks, guided tours set to music, and many of the live musical acts that performed in the park.\n\n28 - 20th Century Music Store - Disneyland Forever Kiosk 07:55\n\nThe Twentieth Century Music Store was once home to a very twenty-first century music making technology. The short lived but popular Disneyland Forever kiosks allowed guests the opportunity to instantly create their very own personalized souvenir CD's with selections chosen from a vast library of rare Disneyland audio recordings.\n\n29 - Main Street Magic Shop - Houdini Telephone Message 01:25\n\nThe Main Street Magic Shop has been a Disneyland staple for decades, and is even where comedian Steve Martin began his show business career. Here, master magicians often perform slight-of-hand tricks for passers by, and on antique phones guests can listen in on an actual vintage recording of Harry Houdini recorded in 1914.\n\n30 - Great American Pastimes - Area Background Music 09:11\n\nSandwiched between the magic shop and the Main Street Cinema is a small store once known as the Main Street Tobacconist, proof being that a wooden tobacco store Indian is still positioned on the sidewalk in front of this establishment. In the '90's, it became Great American Pastimes and sold vintage sports memorabilia and team merchandise.\n\n31 - Main Street Organ Grinder 02:12\n\nAlong the city streets of early 20th century America, it was common to see a Gypsy organ grinder, churning out charming music as his performing monkey entertained the crowd, carrying a tin cup to accept gratuities. To the delight of park guests, this classic novelty act was replicated in early Disneyland, complete with live monkey.\n\n32 - The Keystone Cops - Main Street Saxophone Quartet 08:44\n\nAnother popular live act that has been performing on Main Street for over fifty years is the Saxophone Quartet. In the early years they were known as the Keystone Cops, and donned old-fashioned policeman uniforms with Bobby hats. More recently, the musical foursome has donned red shirts and suspenders, taking on a fireman's motif.\n\n33 - The Main Street Cinema 15:42\n\nThe distinctive sound of early 1900's silent cinema music can be heard in all its zany glory at the Main Street Cinema. Spike Jones composed this music for an album he released in the 1960's paying homage to the silent movie era. Disneyland has used selections from this album to provide the proper atmosphere for this attraction.\n\n34 - Rides, Rapes & Rescues: Themes from the Great Silent Films 33:07\n\nThe background music featured inside the Main Street Cinema originated from this very unusual album produced in 1961. This comical homage to the silent movie era attempted to replicate an in theater experience as it might have been in the early 1900's, with all original songs inspired by the authentic musical styles of early cinema.\n\n35 - Main Street Cinema - Phantom of the Opera 02:40\n\nYears ago, the Main Street Cinema was haunted by its very own phantom, inspired by the classic silent horror thriller \"Phantom of the Opera\" with Lon Chaney. The ghostly figure would lurk around the cinema lobby, sneaking into the viewing room to frighten unsuspecting guests who felt his presence behind them, but it was all in good fun.\n\n36 - Silents Please - Movies Were Movies 02:44\n\nThe 1974 Broadway musical \"Mack and Mabel\" was the true life story of famed silent movie era producer/director Mack Sennett. Robert Preston, in the lead role, opened the show with this song reflecting back on the romantic era of little tramps, Keystone cops, darling damsels, heroes and villains, car chases, train robberies and pie in the face fun.\n\n37 - Steamboat Bill / Turkey in the Straw - Mickey's Toontown 02:11\n\nThe Main Street Cinema began showing Mickey's first theatrically released cartoon, \"Steamboat Willie,\" in honor of his 50th birthday in 1978. Since then it has played on a continuous loop every 7 minutes, 365 days of the year. Since 1993, a re-orchestrated version of the songs from this classic short can also be heard in Mickey's Toontown.\n\n- Main Street Cinema - Mickey Mouse Cartoon Classics -\n\nWhen the Main Street Cinema premiered at Disneyland in 1955, and for over two decades, the films shown here were a rotating assortment of classic live-action short subjects and feature films from the silent screen era. In later years, these were replaced with six classic Mickey Mouse cartoons from the 20's and 30's, including the very first Mickey short, \"Plane Crazy,\" and the one that made him a star,\"Steamboat Willie.\"\n\n45 - Main Street Cinema - Opening Day at Disneyland 08:16\n\nFor Disneyland's 50th anniversary celebration, the Main Street Cinema's normal cartoon program was put on temporary hiatus to screen clips from the park's live opening day telecast, originally aired on July 17, 1955. The footage from this special presentation showed just how much Disneyland had grown over the past 5 decades.\n\n46 - Main Street Town Band 13:46\n\nFor a brief period, Main Street served as the backdrop for a band of Dixielanders dressed as the residents of a turn of the 20th century small town. This \"Town Band\" was inspired by a similar musical troupe from Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, which began performing there during its opening year and remained a staple for decades.\n\n47 - The Dapper Dans 25:23\n\nDisneyland's own barbershop balladeers, the Dapper Dans, claim to be the original boy band, and rightfully so. They have been performing live on Main Street for over half a century. Throughout the day, they can be seen bicycling along the thoroughfare singing vintage American standards, show tunes and favorite Disney songs.\n\n48 - Hello Dolly Medley - Area Background Music 05:32\n\nJerry Herman's musical masterpiece, \"Hello Dolly,\" perfectly encapsulates both the time period and nostalgia of Main Street USA, so it is no surprise that three songs from this Broadway classic have been included in the area music of Disneyland's early 20th century thoroughfare, emoting the bold and brassy energy of this happy hometown.\n\n49 - Market House Party Line - Dinglinger's Store 03:37\n\nMounted on the walls of Main Street Market House are several old-fashioned public telephones. Many fondly remember the original version, set in Dinglinger's general store. This comical conversation between mother and daughter references many of the prices for common grocery items, including steak at a whopping eleven cents a pound.\n\n50 - The Firehouse Five Plus Two 28:32\n\nThe Firehouse Five, Plus Two, were an immensely popular Dixieland jazz group with a huge following and a string of chart topping albums. Notably, each musician was also a member of Walt Disney's animation staff. They first performed at Disneyland on opening day, and by popular demand became a regularly appearing guest act.\n\n51 - Market House Party line - Burning Barn & Paddy Wagon 06:49\n\nOne of the things that makes Disneyland such a special place, and so magical, are its many and often unnoticed little details, and the old-fashioned public phones inside the Main Street Market House are no exception. Lifting the receiver to their ear, guests can eavesdrop on a comical party line conversation authentic to the 1890's.\n\n52 - Market House - Area Background Music 1:00:07\n\nThe Disneyland Market House was originally a replication of a small town general store, decked out in wooden barrels, rocking chairs, a pot belly stove and checkerboard. In the earliest years it even included a butcher counter where one could purchase choice cuts of meat. In later years the shop mainly featured snack items, kitchenware and crockery.\n\n53 - Starbucks Coffee - Market House Partyline 08:08\n\nSince day one, Disneyland has welcomed outside corporations to host the many shops and restaurants up and down Main Street. In 2013, the Market House underwent a full renovation and expansion when Starbucks Coffee took over as the new sponsor. In addition, the party-line phones where updated with newly recorded conversations.\n\n54 - Disneyana 01:21\n\nDisneyana, by definition, is any sort of Disney item that is collectable. There is also an official Disneyana fan club which was founded in 1984. The first Disneyana shop opened on Main Street in 1976, and originally only carried authentically vintage items. In later years one could find new limited addition pieces and current collectable merchandise.\n\n55 - Main Street Windows - Sherman Bros. Medley 08:47\n\nLike the credits in a movie, the windows on Main Street are used to honor those who have contributed to the creation and development of Disneyland. When legendary Disney song writers Richard and Robert Sherman received their window, the special ceremony included a musical tribute to their tuneful theme park compositions.\n\n56 - Main Street Window Chatter - Painless Dentist 03:05\n\nHalf-way down Main Street, and off the main boulevard, are two opposing cul-de-sacs known as Center Street East and Center Street West. Here, from several open windows, guests can listen in on a number of comical scenarios typical of daily life in the 1890's. One of these reenacts and exaggerates the painful sounds heard from a dentist office.\n\n57 - Main Street Window Chatter - Piano Lesson 03:53\n\nAnother comical scenario heard on Center Street is the agonizing resonance of a young piano student taking a lesson at the Main Street Music School. Other examples of such \"window chatter\" can be heard throughout the park, and these atmospheric details help transport guests to another time and place, adding to the magic of Disneyland.\n\n58 - Main Street Window Chatter - Hotel Marceline 01:48\n\nFrom the second story window of the Hotel Marceline, we hear a typical morning routine, including a shower, a brushing of the teeth, and a quick shave. The name given to this fictitious hotel is derived from small hometown of Walt Disney's own boyhood, Marceline, Missouri, which is said to be the inspiration behind Main Street USA.\n\n59 - Chinatown - Tea Room Restaurant 18:08\n\nThe area known as East Center Street today, was once the designated spot for an attraction that never came to be. In this small cul-de-sac just off Main Street, guests could explore an exotic Chinatown. A Chinese tea room and restaurant were also part of the plan, where an animatronic Confucius would have shared his words of wisdom.\n\n60 - The Happiest Millionaire Medley - Area Background Music 03:12\n\nMuch of the background music on Main Street is not authentic to the period, but is drawn from films and musicals that are set during this romantic age. One of these is Walt Disney's, \"The Happiest Millionaire,\" Several songs from this and other classic Walt Disney motion picture musicals can be heard all along Main Street.\n\n- Main Street Corporate Sponsorships -\n\nSince 1955, Disneyland has partnered with outside corporations to sponsor many of its shows, attractions, restaurants, gift shops and other guest service facilities. Over time, as some companies end their arrangements, new companies have come in to fill in these vacancies. A good number of the facilities on Main Street are run by these nationally recognized corporations, who follow the Disney guidelines for guest service standards.\n\n74 - Center Street - Disneyland Art Festival 02:03\n\nAt the Disneyland Art Festival, held on the sidewalks of East Center Street in the early '60's, guests could browse through aisles of colorful art, including original watercolor and oil paintings available for purchase. For an even more one-of-a-kind souvenir, guests could also sit for an on the spot charcoal portrait by a visiting artist.\n\n75 - Main Street Area Music - The Gaslight Orchestra 46:42\n\nMuch of the music that Jack Wagner personally selected for the fondly remembered background music of Main Street USA from 1971-1992 was provided by Albert White and his Gaslight Orchestra. This musical ensemble recorded many popular albums in the 1960's, in a romanticized yet authentically vintage Gay Nineties style.\n\n76 - Main Street Area Music - Gay Nineties Waltzes 34:56\n\nFrom 1971-1976 Disneyland's Main Street area loop is widely believed to have come from a singular album, performed by the Albert White Orchestra, called \"Gay Nineties Waltzes\" which was played in its entirety. In 1976 the loop was extended to include selections from not only this album, but several other gay nineties period pieces.\n\n77 - Main Street Area Music - The Jack Wagner Collection 54:40\n\nJack Wagner's classic Main Street loop blended songs that were both familiar and obscure, consisting of authentic period pieces as well as contemporary compositions. While the Gaslight Orchestra was the main focus of this loop, several other artists were represented as well, including San Francisco Harry and the Barbary Coast Bandits.\n\n79 - Gibson Girl Ice Cream Parlor 1:01:20\n\nWhen Carnation Café took over what was once the patio area of the former Carnation Ice Cream Parlor, the new Gibson Girl Ice Cream Parlor opened a few doors down in what was once home to the Sunkist Citrus House. The late Victorian calendar girl theming was inspired by a similar venue of the same name in Disneyland Paris.\n\n80 - Disney Clothiers Ltd. - Area Background Music 53:10\n\nHalfway down Main Street, on the northern corner of Center Street East, is one of the most popular gift shops in Disneyland, specializing in all manner of Disney themed clothing items. As guests shop, they may hear the tranquil sounds of classical piano in arrangements of several songs that were fashionable at the turn of the last century.\n\n81 - The Main Street Maniacs 43:45\n\nThe Maniacs were a syncopated jazz quartet, specializing in Roaring 20's era music, which often performed impromptu afternoon sidewalk concerts along Main Street. This talented and very versatile group was otherwise known as the Big Thunder Boys, and would also perform traditional Bluegrass music in Frontierland and Bear Country.\n\n82 - The Silhouette Studio 03:35\n\nIn operation since 1956, one of the most unique souvenirs in Disneyland can be found at the Silhouette Studio, where talented artists quickly cut out accurate likenesses suitable for framing. In the 1950's, Walt Disney even devoted an entire segment of his weekly TV series to the art of Silhouette making, which also featured the shop on Main Street.\n\n83 - Crystal Arts Glass Blowers 02:07\n\nCrystal Arts is more a unique attraction than gift shop. Here, talented craftsmen create hand blown crystal souvenirs in full display of guests. Items of all shapes and sizes are available, including intricate glass miniatures of Disney characters and towering crystal castles with gold leaf embellishments. Hand engraving is also available.\n\n84 - Main Street Mellomen Quartet 18:23\n\nThe Mellomen were frequent guest performers at Disneyland during its earlier years. In addition to their appearances in the park, this talented quartet would record many of the soundtracks from Walt Disney's classic films. The group's bass singer was Thurl Ravenscroft, who was also the voice of Tony the Tiger and many Disney characters.\n\n85 - Granny's Rocker 00:46\n\nA long forgotten feature of early Main Street was a lifelike mannequin dressed as an elderly lady, and seated on a wooden rocking chair on the porch of the Main Street Corset Shop. The rocking chair was connected to a mechanical lever so that it actually rocked back and forth all day long, grabbing the curious attention of passers by.\n\n86 - Main Street Corset Shop - The Wizard of Bras 01:20\n\nThis short lived, but infamously well-remembered shop on Main Street was sponsored by the Hollywood Maxwell brassiere company. It showcased a visual history of woman's undergarments on a rotating display, from Victorian times to the present. Walt's obvious misgivings about this exhibit led to its removal after only a few months.\n\n87 - Dearie - The Main Street Pianist & The Dapper Dans 03:22\n\nThe Dapper Dans join the Main Street Pianist to perform their renditions of the classic Gay Nineties number, Dearie, which is a song many closely associate with Main Street. Adding nostalgia on top of nostalgia, special new lyrics were written for Disneyland's 30th anniversary, hearkening back to many attractions of the past.\n\n91 - Penny Arcade Sounds & The Welte Orchestrion 29:10\n\nThe Penny Arcade features many vintage arcade machines from the turn of the twentieth century, including turn-the-crank kinetoscope movies, mechanical fortune tellers, and various other tests of strength endurance and skill. Also on display in an antique nickelodeon: The Welte Orchestrion, a musical marvel from a day gone by.\n\n92 - Penny Arcade Shooting Gallery 01:55\n\nThe first shooting gallery in Disneyland was surprisingly not in Frontierland, but was actually located inside the Penny Arcade on Main Street USA. Today, the Frontierland shooting gallery uses infrared beams to shoot at its targets, but the earlier Main Street gallery used real pellet guns which shot live ammunition at glass and metal targets.\n\n93 - Penny Arcade - Esmeralda Fortune Teller 03:12\n\nA long time feature of the Disneyland Penny Arcade, prominently displayed front and center of the entry archway, is Esmeralda the gypsy fortune teller. Inside a small booth a mannequin waves her hand over a row of tarot cards when guests insert a coin, then a small card is dispensed below with future predictions and sage advice.\n\n94 - Penny Arcade - Pinocchio: Make Him Dance 01:15\n\nOne will not find a single computer operated video game inside the Disneyland Penny Arcade. All the coin-operated conveyances are of the mechanical variety, hearkening back to a pre-digital age. One such machine contains a tap dancing Pinocchio puppet figure which can be controlled by guests to the tune of \"I've Got No Strings.\"\n\n95 - Penny Arcade Orchestrion - Walt Disney Medley 06:26\n\nDisneyland's orchestrion has pumped out mechanical melodies inside the Penny Arcade since 1955. To prevent further wear and tear on this century old antiquity, it now only operates on rare occasions. Instead, an empty music scroll rotates as a pre-recorded set of classic Disney tunes convincingly resonates from strategically placed speakers.\n\n96 - Voice-O-Graph - Donald Duck and Friend 00:50\n\nThe phone booth like Voice-o-Graph machines located in early Disneyland, provided park visitors with a unique souvenir. For 50 cents, guests would step inside a sound-proof booth, and record their very own voice on an album, singing along with Donald Duck. After processing, these were mailed to your home address a few weeks later.\n\n97 - Candy Palace - Candy Shop Medley 53:54\n\nThe Candy Palace is one of the few remaining Main Street shops that were present on opening day, and has satisfied the sweet tooth of millions of Disneyland guests.

Guests could also pose for a souvenir portrait in early 20th century costumes at the adjacent photo parlor.\n\n99 - Plaza Point - Area Background Music 1:20:29\n\n'Tis the season every day at Plaza Point, curating holiday décor, seasonal housewares, gifts and accessories for all the major holidays throughout the year . Along with its rotation of upcoming holiday goods, Christmas merchandise is available year-round, and Cast Members hand paint personalized tree ornaments available for purchase.\n\n100 - Oklahoma Medley - Area Background Music 06:02\n\nRoger's and Hammerstein's, \"Surrey with a Fringe on Top\" from \"Oklahoma\" was the direct inspiration for an early Main Street attraction. While the horse-drawn surreys may be long gone, they are not forgotten, as this song and other favorites from the classic musical have now become a permanent part of the Main Street soundtrack.\n\n101 - Coke Corner Pianist & The Dapper Dans 02:56\n\nAt the north end of Main Street is an old-time soda fountain, and hot dog eatery, known as the Coca-Cola Refreshment Corner. In the adjacent outdoor patio area, upbeat live musical entertainment is provided via a ragtime pianist, and often the famous Dapper Dans will stop by to join in and sing a few toe-tapping barbershop ballads.\n\n- Coke Corner Ragtime Pianist -\n\nAt the turn of the 20th Century, America experienced an all-new musical sound that was revolutionary for its time, combining elements of classical music with a syncopated rhythm. This new sound quickly became known as Ragtime. Disneyland's Coke Corner has kept this distinctive two beat style alive and well for decades, with daily concerts featuring smiling, friendly, request-taking piano men, and their toe-tapping tunes.\n\n108 - Main Street Medley - Disneyland On Parade 05:35\n\nMain Street has showcased every Disneyland parade since 1955, and many of these parades have, in turn, showcased Main Street as a themed element within many of these lively processions. From Disneyland's opening day parade to the more recent Mickey's Magic Kingdom Celebration, these Main Street-centric segments are always a delight.\n\n109 - I'm Walkin' Right Down the Middle of Main Street USA 03:07\n\nThis catchy tune was originally featured in, \"Disneyland is Your Land\", a live stage show revue presented in honor of Disneyland's 25th anniversary in 1980. Five years later, Marie Osmond performed the song again for the 30th anniversary television special, and it has since become a popular theme song for Main Street USA."
