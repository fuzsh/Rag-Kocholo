        "text": "I did my laundry and took a walk out to the Friendly Market before heading home and sitting down to watch “The Shop on Main Street” from Czechoslovakia in 1965. It was a very good film about the Holocaust. A carpenter named Tono is given the chance to manage a shop where an old woman named Mrs. Lautmann works as part of regulations transferring business to Aryans. Mrs. Lautmann is old and senile, and her business does not make money. The Jewish community offers Tono regular payment for continuing at the shop, which otherwise might fall into ruthless hands. Tono uses his skills to fix up the place, and his nagging wife is pleased with the money for a while, but the day comes when the authorities round up all the Jews. Tono is confused and goes into a panic, and Mrs. Hautmann has no idea what is going on. This last section of the film is very powerful, as Tono initially acts in terms of self-preservation, but it’s difficult to throw this old woman he has come to like out to the wolves. He was a contrast to his materialistic wife and his snake of a brother, and for a time he wore a bowler that made him look like Charlie Chaplin, though not the Chaplin who was in “The Great Dictator.” The last few minutes of the film are very dramatic. I would say that this was one of the best films about the Holocaust that I have seen. I would put “Schindler’s List” and “The Pianist” at the top, but this one was quite memorable. It won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, and Ida Kaminska was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. The other nominees that year were Anouk Aimee, Lynn Redgrave, Vanessa Redgrave, and Elizabeth Taylor, who was the winner for “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” Kaminska’s last film was “The Angel Levine” in 1970. She died at age 80 of cardiovascular disease on May 21, 1980. The directors of “The Shop on Main Street” were Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos. Kádár would move to the United States and direct “The Angel Levine.” In Canada, he directed the film “Lies My Father Told Me.” He was 61 when he died on June 1, 1979. Klos worked with Kádár on “Adrift” in 1971, and he went on to direct “Bizon” in 1989. He died at age 83 on July 31, 1993 in Prague. Some of the people who died on November 7 include Victor McLaglen (1957), Eleanor Roosevelt (1962), Steve McQueen (1980), Slappy White (1995), Howard Keel (2004), Joe Frazier (2011), and Leonard Cohen (2016). Today is a birthday for Lorde (24), Christopher Knight (63), and Joni Mitchell (77). According to the Brandon Brooks Rewind radio segment for November 7, Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner were married in 1951. In 1963, “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World” premiered. In 1974, Ted Nugent won a national squirrel shooting contest, hitting one of them with a bow and arrow from 150 yards. In 2011, Conrad Murray was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson."
