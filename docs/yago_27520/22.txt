News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendi Deng have reached an "amicable" divorce settlement to end their 14-year marriage.

The estranged couple told a New York court they would move forward with "mutual respect" and a shared interest in their daughters' welfare.

The details of the settlement have not been disclosed publicly.

The 82-year-old filed for divorce from Ms Deng in June saying his marriage had "irretrievably broken down".

The couple have a pre-nuptial agreement and are holding shares in trust for their children.

They have two school-age daughters together, Grace and Chloe.
