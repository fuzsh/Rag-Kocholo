        "text": "Rupert Murdoch has called off his engagement to would-be fifth wife Ann Lesley Smith, just two weeks after proposing, it has been reported.\n\nMurdoch, 92, shared the news of his impending nuptials in an interview with the New York Post (which he owns) just a fortnight ago, revealing he had presented Smith, 66, with an Asscher cut diamond on St Patrick’s Day. The billionaire media mogul added he was ‘nervous’ but was confident this marriage – his fifth – would be his ‘last’. The couple said they planed to marry in late summer.\n\nInside Rupert Murdoch’s Mega Dynasty – as it’s announced he’s getting married for the fifth time\n\nRead More\n\nHowever, it appears the romantic fairytale wasn’t to be. Sources close to Murdoch say he has broken off the engagement, according to Vanity Fair. The media mogul had allegedly become increasingly uncomfortable with Smith’s outspoken evangelical views. A spokesperson for Rupert Murdoch declined to comment.\n\nIt would mark the end of a whirlwind romance, one that comes just months after Murdoch finalised his split from Jerry Hall. Murdoch, a father-of-six, met Smith, a former police chaplain and the widow of late country music singer Chester Smith, at his vineyard in Bel Air, California, last September. Smith insisted they had lots in common.\n\n'I’m a widow of 14 years,’ she told the New York Post at the time of their engagement. ‘Like Rupert, my husband was a businessman. Worked for local papers, developed radio and TV stations and helped promote Univision. So I speak Rupert’s language. We share the same beliefs. In perspective, it’s not my first rodeo. Getting near 70 means being in the last half. I waited for the right time. Friends are happy for me.’\n\nMurdoch has six children from his previous marriages: Prudence MacLeod, 64, from first wife Patricia Booker; Elisabeth, 53, Lachlan, 50, and James, 49, from second wife Anna dePeyster (formerly Mann); and Grace, 21, and Chloe, 19, from third wife Wendi Deng. He shares no children with his fourth wife, Jerry Hall.\n\nRead More\n\nPaparazzi snaps, Rupert Murdoch and how a public showmance could pave the perfect path for a billionaire comeback\n\nEverybody loves a romance! Tatler investigates what really goes on behind the scenes of the world's starriest lovers, from cinema, media and high society\n\nHall and Murdoch tied the knot in 2016, with a civil ceremony at Spencer House on 4 March, followed by a blessing at St Bride’s Church the following day, which was attended by famous faces including David Bailey, Bob Geldof, Sir Michael Caine, Bianca Jagger and Tracey Emin, along with the couple’s respective children from their previous relationships. It marked the fourth marriage for Murdoch, but the first for Hall (she had a Hindu wedding ceremony in Bali with her former partner, Mick Jagger, in 1990, but the ‘marriage’ was later declared invalid under both Indonesian and English law).\n\nJerry Hall and Rupert Murdoch finalised their divorce in August 2022, a month before he met Smith and a year after they were last seen together in public. He was married to Deng from 1999 to 2013; Anna dePeyster (née Torv) from 1967 to 1999; and Patricia Booker from 1956 to 1967."
