        "text": "Rupert Murdoch is one of the most famous media tycoons in the world.\n\nWith a career spanning seven decades, he's been in the spotlight for a long time – culminating in his resignation as Fox and News Corp chairman.\n\nThe 92-year-old's relationship status is no exception, and has long dominated the headlines alongside his business pursuits.\n\nIn his early 90s, Murdoch announced he was set to be married once again, with his engagement to former police chaplain, Ann Lesley Smith. But just weeks after sharing the shock news, it was revealed Murdoch had called off the engagement.\n\nThe Australian mogul has four marriages and four divorces behind him, with his divorce from model Jerry Hall finalised last year.\n\nStartling claims about Murdoch's marriage breakdown from Hall have now been uncovered by Vanity Fair, including that he asked for a divorce via a short email.\n\nLet's take a look back at the women he's been married to.\n\nREAD MORE: Meet the women of the Murdoch clan\n\nJerry Hall\n\nNot much was known about Jerry Hall and Murdoch's relationship breakdown and how it took place – until now.\n\nA report in Vanity Fair claims the now 92-year-old dumped his fourth wife by email.\n\nNews Corp chronicler Gabe Sherman told the publication Hall was waiting to meet Murdoch at their estate in Oxfordshire when a message pinged in her inbox.\n\n\"Jerry, sadly I've decided to call an end to our marriage,\" it reportedly read, according to a screenshot seen by the publication.\n\n\"We have certainly had some good times, but I have much to do … My New York lawyer will be contacting yours immediately.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Rupert Murdoch's granddaughter details 'guilt and shame' that led her to 'rock bottom'\n\nSources told Vanity Fair Hall was \"stunned\" by the news and confided in friends that she and her ex-husband rarely fought.\n\nMurdoch began seeing Hall – a former model and actress who was big in the '70s and '80s – in 2015. Hall's perhaps best known for her long-term relationship with Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, whom she shares four kids with.\n\nHall and Murdoch, who have a 25-year age gap, announced their engagement in January 2011 and married just a few months later in March.\n\nIt was a low-key ceremony in central London, with the media mogul tweeting at the time: \"No more tweets for ten days or ever! Feel like the luckiest AND happiest man in world.\"\n\nNotably, he has not tweeted any messages since.\n\nThey were a notoriously private couple, but sources close to the pair said their marriage was successful because \"what Rupert has really been looking for all these years is not so much a wife as a First Lady. Someone who will run his life in private and be at his side in public.\"\n\nHowever, in June 2022, it was announced they were divorcing.\n\nThe couple never released an official statement and finalised their divorce in August last year. The couple signed a tight prenuptial agreement prior to their divorce, meaning Murdoch's media empire, which has sky-rocketed his value to more than $US17 billion ($24 billion) according to Forbes, could not be touched.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\nAnn Lesley Smith?\n\nTwo weeks after the 92-year-old billionaire media mogul announced his engagement to the 66-year-old former police chaplain in one of his own newspapers, sources claimed the former couple have split.\n\nVanity Fair first reported Murdoch and Smith's breakup, with a source alleging Murdoch had become uncomfortable with Smith's evangelical beliefs.\n\nMurdoch's former fiancée, Ann Lesley Smith, who is 66, has a background in journalism – something she's claimed attracted her to the media mogul.\n\n\"Like Rupert, my husband was a businessman. Worked for local papers, developed radio and TV stations and helped promote (Spanish-language TV network) Univision,\" Smith told The New York Post. \"So I speak Rupert's language. We share the same beliefs.\"\n\nSmith worked in modelling early in her career and was the host of the Modesto, California KFIV Ann Lesley Live radio show.\n\nShe also notably worked as a Christian minister for the Manteca Police Department and the Marin County Sheriff's Office, before returning to journalism.\n\nSmith is also the widow of late country music star Chester Smith, who died in 2008 aged 78 from a heart attack.\n\nSpeaking to The Post, Smith revealed that she wasn't expecting to couple up at this point in her life.\n\n\"In perspective, it's not my first rodeo,\" she admitted. \"Getting near 70 means being in the last half. I waited for the right time. Friends are happy for me.\"\n\nIn the interview, Murdoch himself added, \"We're both looking forward to spending the second half of our lives together.\"\n\nPer Murdoch, the pair met just last September, at his vineyard.\n\nThe most captivating love stories in popular culture\n\nPatricia Booker\n\nMurdoch married Patricia Booker right at the beginning of his career, back in 1956 when he was 25 years old.\n\nBecause it was so long ago, she's the wife we know the least about.\n\nBooker was an international flight attendant before she married Murdoch. The pair had one daughter, Prudence, born in 1958, and divorced in 1967 after 11 years of marriage.\n\nAnna Torv\n\nIn the same year his divorce from Booker was finalised, Murdoch married Scottish-born Anna Torv. At the time they met, she was working for his newspaper The Daily Telegraph.\n\nAccording to Women's Weekly, Torv was an 18-year-old aspiring journalist who had the opportunity to interview Murdoch. The pair fell for each other, he split from Booker, and the couple got married.\n\nThis was Murdoch's longest-lasting marriage: from 1967 to 1999. The couple had three kids, Elisabeth, now 53, Lachlan, now 50, and James, now 49.\n\nAs well as her career as a journalist, Torv has authored three books, and she sat on the board of News Corp until her separation from Murdoch in 1998.\n\nAccording to New York Magazine, they split because Torv wanted Murdoch to quit his job and retire with her, which Murdoch believed would kill him. They agreed to an amicable split, but Torv reportedly grew suspicious that Murdoch had a secret girlfriend.\n\nWhile he maintains he didn't meet his next partner until after splitting from Torv, his next marriage came just 17 days after their divorce was finalised.\n\nIt's rumoured Torv won $1.7 billion in assets in the divorce settlement, $110 million of which was in cash. If that figure is accurate, it would have been the most expensive divorce of all time.\n\nWendi Deng\n\nDeng and Murdoch met in 1997, while he was still married to Torv. Deng, who was born in China, was an intern at a Hong Kong television station owned by Murdoch's News Corp at the time.\n\nThey married in 1999 on his yacht, less than three weeks after Murdoch's divorce was finalised. At the time, she was 31 and he was 68.\n\nThe pair had two daughters: Grace, now 21, and Chloe, now 19. In June 2013, Murdoch filed for divorce from Deng, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nIn 2014, the year after their split, rumours emerged that Deng had an affair with Tony Blair, former Prime Minister of the UK – an allegation he has long denied. Unnamed sources claimed Murdoch found out and that's why he filed for divorce. Murdoch reportedly ended his long-term friendship with Blair after the rumours began.\n\nHowever, it seems the exes still have a friendly relationship. Deng called the tycoon a \"good father\" in a 2016 interview with The Independent.\n\n\"We attend school conferences together. We both make sure they learn Chinese, do well in math. We make decisions together about how they use social media,\" she said."
