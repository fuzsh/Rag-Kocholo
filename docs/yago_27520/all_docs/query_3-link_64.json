        "text": "Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has married again, tying the knot for the fifth time at his California vineyard on Saturday.\n\nThe former Fox and News Corp chairman, 93, married 67-year-old Elena Zhukova after a short engagement. The pair started dating in 2023 and confirmed their plans to wed to the New York Times in March this year.\n\nZhukova, a retired molecular biologist, was introduced to Murdoch by his third wife Wendi Deng.\n\nMoscow native Zhukova was previously married to billionaire Alexander Zhukov.\n\nThis will be her third marriage. Zhukova is the mother of Darrya Zhukova, who was married to Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, the former owner of English Premier League soccer team Chelsea.\n\nThe wedding took place at Murdoch’s exclusive Bel Air vineyard and estate Moraga. Murdoch purchased the secluded Los Angeles property in 2013.\n\nMurdoch stepped down from the top job at News Corp late last year, handing the reins to his eldest son Lachlan.\n\nHe continues to be involved in the media empire as a chairman emeritus.\n\nThe wedding comes amid a difficult time for News Corp’s Australian publishing empire, with journalists being informed on Wednesday of a newsroom restructure which is likely to result in more job losses as the company seeks to save up to $65 million.\n\nMurdoch is set to visit Australia in July to celebrate the 60th anniversary of News Corp masthead The Australian.\n\nIt will mark his first trip Down Under since 2018.\n\nThe Murdoch media empires are controlled through a family trust, meaning the marriage to Zhukova is unlikely to impact the future holdings of both media empires.\n\nUpon Murdoch’s death, all votes would be transferred to his four eldest children, Prudence, Lachlan, James and Elisabeth.\n\nMurdoch has six children from his first three marriages.\n\nIt was only in March 2023 that Murdoch was engaged to a different woman, Ann Lesley Smith, before calling off the wedding in April after he reportedly became concerned about Smith’s ultra-conservative and evangelist views.\n\nMurdoch’s fourth marriage to model Jerry Hall ended after six years in 2022.\n\nLoading\n\nHe married his first wife, flight attendant Patricia Booker, in 1956, with whom he had his eldest child, Prudence. In 1967, he married Daily Mirror reporter Anna Torv, mother to Lachlan, James and Elisabeth. Their marriage was Murdoch’s longest before the pair split in 1998 and later divorced in 1999.\n\nMurdoch married 29-year-old Deng in 1999, less than three weeks after his split from Torv was finalised. Murdoch and Deng had two children together, Chloe and Grace. The pair split in 2013.\n\nStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
