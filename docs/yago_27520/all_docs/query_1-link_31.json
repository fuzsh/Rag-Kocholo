        "text": "Hedcuts generally picture a single individual and occupy only a half-column of space on a page of the Wall Street Journal. On rare occasions, however, full-column dot-drawings may run, as in the case of an illustration depicting wife and husband Wendi Deng and Rupert Murdoch. Because of their size and the fact that they are created to illustrate specific stories, such hedcuts are usually used only once.\n\nTaken from a newsphoto documenting Rupert Murdoch's and Wendi Deng's June 1999 wedding, the drawing, which ran on November 1, 2000, did not illustrate a story about the marriage itself, but rather about the effect of the wedding upon Murdoch's business empire. A native of China, Deng has become a central player in helping Murdoch's News Corp. expand into the Chinese market. The double portrait illustrates a relationship that has important ramifications for the News Corp., and thus for the international business community."
