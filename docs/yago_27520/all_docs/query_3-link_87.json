        "text": "Two years after she leaped to his defense with the \"head slap seen 'round the world,\" Wendi and Rupert Murdoch are apparently splitting up.\n\nNPR's David Folkenflik tweets that a News Corp. spokesman confirms the report from Deadline Hollywood that the billionaire media mogul \"has filed for divorce from wife Wendi Deng Murdoch.\"\n\nAs that website reminds its readers:\n\n\"The couple met in 1997, at a company party in Hong Kong. They married in 1999, less than a month after his divorce from ex-wife Anna Maria Torv Murdoch Mann was finalized.\"\n\nTwo-Way readers may well recall the moment in July 2011 when Rupert Murdoch, now 82, was testifying before a government panel in London about the \"hacking scandal\" that had engulfed some of his tabloids in the U.K. A man approached with a plate of shaving cream, ready to stick it in Murdoch's face. That's when Wendi Murdoch, now 44, jumped from a seat behind her husband to deliver a blow to the would-be creamer's head.\n\nThe video, as you can imagine, went viral.\n\nRupert and Wendi Murdoch have two daughters. He has four children from two previous marriages.\n\nUpdate at 1:10 p.m. ET. Family Finances.\n\nNPR's David Folkenflik sends along this note:"
