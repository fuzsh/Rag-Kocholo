        "text": "For the last several years, friends of Rupert and Wendi Murdoch had noticed that the couple seemed to live separate lives. Mrs. Murdoch developed an interest in producing movies, and Mr. Murdoch busied himself steering his $73 billion media conglomerate, News Corporation.\n\nBy most accounts the couple had grown apart and spent long stretches away from each other, but people close to the Murdochs did not expect the 82-year-old mogul to divorce his wife of 14 years. Too messy financially. It wouldn’t be good for their daughters, Grace, 11, and Chloe, 9, said these people, who would only discuss the couple’s marriage anonymously.\n\nBut on Thursday, Mr. Murdoch filed for divorce in New York State Supreme Court. The filing said that the “relationship between husband and wife has broken down irretrievably.”\n\nThe couple were in New York at their Fifth Avenue penthouse on Thursday when news of the divorce, said to be Mr. Murdoch’s decision, emerged. A spokeswoman for News Corporation confirmed the divorce filing, which was first reported by Deadline Hollywood, and said the divorce would have no impact on the company. The Murdoch family trust controls 38.4 percent of News Corporation’s voting shares. Mrs. Murdoch has no financial stake in the company."
