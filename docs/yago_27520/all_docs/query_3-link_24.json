        "text": "On June 25, 1999, 17 days after Murdoch’s divorce became final, he and Deng wedded at a lavish ceremony in New York harbor on his yacht, Morning Glory—which was later sold to former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Before tying the knot, she quit her job at Star TV, though continued to play an active role in News Corp.\n\nDeng had previously been married to Jake Cherry, who—with his then wife Joyce—sponsored her student visa and hosted her in Los Angeles in 1988. After Cherry’s divorce, he and Deng wedded in 1990. The union lasted two years and seven months—seven months more than the requirement for her to receive a green card, according to the Wall Street Journal."
