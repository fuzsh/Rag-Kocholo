        "text": "Rupert Murdoch Children: Rupert Murdoch has been married four times and has six children with three of his wives: Prudence (with his first wife Patricia Booker), Elisabeth, Lachlan, and James (with his second wife Anna Torv), and Chloe and Grace (with his third wife Wendi Deng).\n\nAfter divorcing his fourth wife Jerry Hall in August 2022, Rupert announced his engagement to Ann Lesley Smith on March 20, 2023, but they called off the engagement a few weeks later.\n\nRupert’s eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, will take over his business empire, Fox Corp and News Corp. On Sept. 21, Fox News announced that Rupert will step down as chairman in November and pass his authority to Lachlan. Lachlan became chairman and CEO of FOX in 2019 and will now have the honorary title of “chairman emeritus” after his father’s retirement.\n\nKeep reading to know everything about Rupert Murdoch children.\n\nRupert Murdoch Children\n\nRupert Murdoch is a big businessman in media. He has six children. Their names are Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan, James, Grace Helen, and Chloe. Prudence is his oldest child. Elisabeth, Lachlan, and James are well-known in media and business like their father. Grace Helen and Chloe are less known publicly.\n\nIn media and business, Elisabeth, Lachlan, and James have important roles. They work in companies that their father owns or runs. Prudence is not much in the public eye like her siblings. Grace Helen and Chloe also keep a low profile.\n\nHere’s everything you would like to know about Rupert Murdoch children.\n\nPrudence Murdoch\n\nPrue Murdoch MacLeod, Rupert’s eldest child from his first marriage to Booker, was born in 1958 in Australia. When her parents split, Prue chose to live with her father and his new wife, Anna Torv, as detailed in Michael Wolff’s 2008 book, The Man Who Owns the News: Inside the Secret World of Rupert Murdoch, published in Vanity Fair. Relocating to London and later New York, she completed her high school education there.\n\nWhile briefly employed at her father’s paper, News of the World, Prue has had a tumultuous relationship with Rupert. Their major falling out occurred after a 1997 press conference where Rupert referred to his “three children,” omitting Prue. In one of her rare public statements, Prue mentioned, “I rang up, I screamed at him, I hung up. He was very upset.” She recounted that Rupert later made amends by sending an extravagant gift of flowers and two clementine trees.\n\nPrue has been married twice. Her first marriage in 1986 was to Crispin Odey, a London hedge fund manager, which ended in divorce the following year. In 1989, she married Alasdair MacLeod, despite her disapproval of his subsequent employment under Rupert, according to Wolff. Prudence and Alasdair now reside in Sydney with their three children: James, Angus, and Clementine.\n\nAlso Check – Jennifer Lopez Kids (All you Need to Know about Emme and Max)\n\nElisabeth Murdoch\n\nRupert’s eldest child with his second spouse, Anna, is daughter Elisabeth, born on Aug. 22, 1968, in Sydney, Australia, reportedly named after her grandmother, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. Raised in New York with a brief period at an Australian boarding school, Elisabeth attended Vassar College before assuming roles within her father’s business empire, such as managing director at BSkyB.\n\nIn addition to her corporate roles, Elisabeth pursued her entrepreneurial ambitions, initially owning NBC-affiliate stations in California and later founding Shine, an independent TV company known for producing hit reality shows like The Biggest Loser and MasterChef. Despite initial fears, she embraced the challenge of running her own business, a sentiment she shared in a 2010 interview with The Guardian.\n\nShine was eventually acquired by News Corporation in 2011 for $674 million, leading Elisabeth to join News Corp.’s board. However, in 2019, she launched Sister, an entertainment production company credited with producing acclaimed series like Chernobyl and Broadchurch.\n\nReflecting on her journey, Elisabeth acknowledged the desire for parental approval while asserting her independence. Her political stance and ambitions within her father’s media empire are influenced by her desire to avoid conflict until his passing, as hinted by a Vanity Fair source in April 2023.\n\nOn a personal note, Elisabeth has experienced three marriages and has four children. Her first marriage to Elkin Pianim in 1993 produced two daughters, Cornelia and Anna, before ending in divorce in 1998. She then married Matthew Freud in 2001, with whom she had two more children — Charlotte and Samson — before their divorce in 2014. Her third marriage in 2017 was to artist Keith Tyson.\n\nAlso Check – Deion Sanders Kids (All About his 5 Kids)\n\nLachlan Murdoch\n\nRupert’s first son with Anna, Lachlan, was born on Sept. 8, 1971, in London. Raised in New York, he attended various private schools before studying philosophy at Princeton University. He joined his father’s business right after college, overseeing newspapers in Australia and the U.S. before becoming the deputy COO at News Corp. in 1997.\n\nDespite his family ties, Lachlan sought to establish himself independently. In 2005, he left News Corp. to launch Illyria in Australia, investing in struggling radio stations and turning them around.\n\nLachlan emphasized self-reliance in his decision, stating, “In life, you back yourself.” He believed in the importance of separating from the family business to build confidence and take risks.\n\nReturning to News Corp. and 21st Century Fox in 2014 as non-executive co-chairman marked a significant shift. His reentry was perceived as a challenge to his brother James’s aspirations, causing tension within the family.\n\nLachlan’s rise continued as he became executive chairman at 21st Century Fox in 2015 and chairman and CEO at Fox in 2019. His succession as Rupert’s heir in September 2023 marked a pivotal moment, acknowledging his father’s legacy and impact on the media industry.\n\nMarried to Australian model Sarah O’Hare since 1998, Lachlan and Sarah have three children: Kalan, Aidan, and Aerin.\n\nAlso Check – Mick Jagger Children (Everything to know about his 8 children)\n\nJames Murdoch\n\nJames Murdoch, born on December 13, 1972, in London, took a different path compared to his older siblings in his career journey. He began at Harvard University but left to establish Rawkus Records, a hip-hop label featuring artists like Mos Def and Eminem. The label was later acquired by News Corp. in 1998.\n\nFollowing this, James dedicated over two decades to working within his family’s business empire. His roles included deputy COO of News Corp. in 2011 and CEO of 21st Century Fox in 2015. However, he distanced himself starting in 2019, leaving Fox after its acquisition by Disney and officially resigning from News Corp. in 2020 due to disagreements over editorial content and strategic decisions.\n\nReports suggest that James aims to reform Fox News, a task he may pursue with support from his sisters after Rupert’s eventual passing. Alongside his wife Kathryn, he manages the Quadrivium foundation, backing causes such as voter engagement, democracy, and climate initiatives.\n\nDespite his family’s conservative leanings, James is known for his liberal views and ongoing political debates with his father. With three children, he isn’t interested in building a family business dynasty, stating, “There’s no empire, there’s no future dynasty.”\n\nAlso Check – Jack Nicholson Kids (All About his Sons and Daughters)\n\nGrace Helen Murdoch\n\nGrace Helen Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch’s eldest child with Wendi Deng and his fifth child overall, was born on November 19, 2001. Growing up in New York, she completed her education at the Brearley School in June 2020, as seen on her Instagram. Currently enrolled at Yale University, Grace shares a notably close bond with her billionaire father. Captioning a series of photos together on Instagram, she referred to him as her “favorite person.” Expressing gratitude on his 90th birthday, she wrote, “I am incredibly fortunate to be your daughter.”\n\nAlso Check – Steve Harvey Kids (All About His Sons and Daughters)\n\nChloe Murdoch\n\nChloe, Rupert Murdoch’s second child with Wendi Deng, was born on July 17, 2003. Raised in New York alongside her older sister, she currently studies at Stanford University, according to her Instagram profile.\n\nDespite her parents’ prominence, Chloe maintains a low-key presence, with no public social media accounts. Occasionally, she appears on her mother’s Instagram, where Wendi celebrated her 18th birthday in 2020, calling her “the most wonderful 18-year-old daughter.” A year earlier, Wendi described Chloe as “beautiful, incredible, unique” in another Instagram post.\n\nAlso Check –\n\nJulia Robert and Danny Moder 3 Kids\n\nMichael Jackson’s Kids: Prince Michael Jackson, Paris Jackson, Bigi Jackson\n\nMegan Fox Kids\n\nElon Musk Children\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Rupert Murdoch children has made significant contributions to the media and business worlds.
