        "text": "Congratulations are in order for Rupert Murdoch, the man formerly known as the elite’s most eligible bachelor. On Saturday, the chairman emeritus of Fox Corporation quietly took his fifth blushing bride in Elena Zhukova, the 67-year-old retired molecular biologist and mother of Russian socialite Dasha Zhukova. The nuptials took place at the former Fox titan’s Bel Air winery Moraga, which reportedly features an 11-bedroom 1920s house on the property and was once owned by Victor Fleming, the director of The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. A casual affair, I’m sure.\n\nThe fifth and latest Mrs. Murdoch wore a gown with a cleavage cutout by London-based designer Emilia Wickstead, who, according to “Page Six,” has also dressed Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. Rupert, for his part, opted for a black tux and black sneakers, because comfort is evidently king at the ripe young age of 93. The newlyweds are separated by a 26-year age gap, which does not appear to bother the couple. But for the nonagenarian, 26 years seems to be a piece of cake: He was 38 years older than his third wife Wendi Deng, a Chinese-born television executive from whom he divorced in 2013.\n\nOutside of getting engaged earlier this year and meeting on a megayacht, not much is publicly known about the now-married couple and their dynamic. But in 2012, Dasha told the Financial Times that her mother was “very affectionate” while also “quite a serious person, who is more interested in substance than aesthetics.” If by substance, she means an elderly husband with a $8.26 billion reported net worth, then Zhukova’s assessment checks out."
