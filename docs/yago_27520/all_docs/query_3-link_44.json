        "text": "“I don’t think I ever considered myself just a rich wife,\" Wendi said of her marriage to Rupert Murdoch.\n\nBy Sarah Kester\n\nPublished July 25 2024, 6:24 p.m. ET\n\nThe billionaire ex-wives club is quite an exclusive circle. Several recognizable names include MacKenzie Scott, who was married to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for 25 years. There’s also Melinda French Gates, who was one part of a power couple with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.\n\nThen there’s Wendi Deng, a Chinese American businesswoman who was married to billionaire Rupert Murdoch from 1999 to 2013. They have two children together: Grace and Chloe.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAlthough the couple eventually split, it's believed that Wendi walked away from the marriage with quite a tidy settlement. What is Wendi Deng’s net worth? Read on for more.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhat is Wendi Deng’s net worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Wendi’s net worth is $100 million.\n\nHer rise to riches is impressive. She was born in a small town in China and moved to the United States to pursue an education in economics. She got a bachelor’s degree from Cal State Northridge and landed a scholarship at Yale University’s MBA program.\n\nShe met the Australian-born billionaire magnate in 1997 when she worked for his company Star TV in Hong Kong.\n\nWendi Deng\n\nEntrepreneur, Investor, Movie Producer, Art Collector\n\nNet worth: $100 million\n\nWendi Deng is a Chinese American businesswoman who was married to media mogul Rupert Murdoch from 1999 to 2013. They have two children: Chloe and Grace. She is also an entrepreneur, film producer, investor, and art collector.\n\nBirthdate: December 1968\n\nBirthplace: Jinan, China\n\nMarriages: Jack Cherry (1990-1993, divorced), Rupert Murdoch (1999 to 2013, divorced)\n\nChildren: Grace and Chloe\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIt was her first job out of graduate school. At the time, she was the only Chinese executive there. They fell in love and married on Rupert's yacht in 1999, just a few weeks after his divorce from Anna Murdoch was finalized.\n\nAlthough she married the boss, Wendi told Vogue that she never let the title of “wife” define her.\n\n“I don’t think I ever considered myself just a rich wife. When E-Trade first started, I was at home moving stocks around,” she said.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSince her split, Wendi has thrown herself back into a lot of her creative and business passions, such as investing, art collecting, and even working as a movie producer. In 2013, she joined the film Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang as a producer.\n\nHow much did Wendi Deng earn in her divorce settlement with Rupert Murdoch?\n\nRupert, who has been married five times, knows a thing or two about costly divorces. But he also knows how to protect some of his assets by arranging prenups.\n\nDue to this, it’s not clear how much Wendi earned in their divorce settlement. However, some have speculated Rupert was generous with Wendi after she famously protected her former husband from the embarrassment of getting hit in the face by a foam pie by activist Jonnie Marbles.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAfter the divorce settlement was reached, the former pair released a joint statement, saying, “We are pleased to announce that we have reached an amicable settlement of all matters relating to our divorce. We move forward with mutual respect and a shared interest in the health and happiness of our two daughters. We will not comment on this any further.\""
