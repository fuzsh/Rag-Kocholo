        "text": "Rupert Murdoch and his estranged wife, Wendi Deng, finalised a divorce settlement before parting amicably with a kiss.\n\nThe billionaire chairman of News Corporation and Ms Deng, his 44-year-old third wife, told a judge at New York supreme court in Manhattan that they had reached a deal to end their 14-year marriage.\n\nDeclining to disclose the details of the agreement, they shared a brief embrace before announcing that they would proceed constructively for the benefit of their daughters Grace, 12, and Chloe, 10.\n\n“We are pleased to announce that we have reached an amicable settlement of all matters relating to our divorce,” the couple said, in a statement released through a publicist. “We move forward with mutual respect and a shared interest in the health and happiness of our two daughters.”\n\nAsked whether he was satisfied with the deal, which is based on prenuptial and postnuptial agreements they signed previously, Mr Murdoch, 82, told Judge Ellen Gesmer: “Yes, your honour.”\n\nMr Murdoch and his family have a $13.4 billion (£8.3 billion) fortune, according to Forbes magazine, thanks largely to their holdings in News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, which are held in a family trust.\n\nMr Murdoch’s control of the trust will be inherited when he dies by his four children from previous marriages — Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James — who currently benefit from it.\n\nHis daughters with Ms Deng are believed to have the same financial stakes in his companies, but hold no voting rights. This disparity is said to have caused tensions between the couple.\n\nThe Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal reported that Ms Deng, a Chinese-born businesswoman, would receive the Manhattan apartment they couple bought for $44 million in 2005. The couple also owns properties in London, elsewhere in the US and in China.\n\nMs Deng, a graduate of Yale University, met Mr Murdoch in 1997 while working for his Star TV channel in Hong Kong. They married aboard his yacht in New York two years later."
