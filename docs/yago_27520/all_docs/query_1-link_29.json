        "text": "It’s set to be the wedding of the year, after Rupert Murdoch, 92, the billionaire media titan and owner of Fox News and News Corporation, announced he will be getting married for the fifth time. Murdoch is reportedly set to tie the knot to retired scientist Elena Zhukova, 66, the mother of Roman Abramovich's ex-wife Dasha Zhukova. The couple are said to have been introduced by his third wife, Wendi Deng, and were said to have spent long summer days cruising around the Mediterranean on a superyacht. Elena Zhukova is a twice-divorced scientist specialising in diabetes. She is a hands-on grandmother to Dasha's children with Abramovich and her second husband, Stavros Niarchos, of the Greek shipping dynasty.\n\nThe twist in Murdoch's romantic fortunes came just months after Murdoch called off to his engagement to girlfriend Ann Lesley Smith, 66. The couple met at the billionaire media mogul’s California ranch shortly after he finalised his divorce from his fourth wife, Jerry Hall, and quickly embarked on a whirlwind romance that culminated in Murdoch popping the question with a dazzling diamond ring on St Patrick’s Day. However, just two weeks later, news emerged that the couple had parted ways.\n\nThe wedding will mean another powerful branch is added to the Murdoch family tree, one that includes four ex-wives and half a dozen children."
