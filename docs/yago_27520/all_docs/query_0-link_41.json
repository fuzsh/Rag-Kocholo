        "text": "The wedding was held at the 93-year-old media mogul’s estate Moraga on June 1, according to US and UK media reports.\n\nGuests included New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his wife Dana Blumberg as well as News Corp chief executive Robert Thompson.\n\nThe nuptials come just months after Murdoch stepped down as chairman of Fox and News Corp, ending a more than seven-decade career at the helm of a sprawling media empire.\n\nZhukova, 67, who emigrated from Moscow to the US in 1991, is a retired molecular biologist. The pair began dating last northern summer and met through Murdoch’s third wife, Wendi Deng, according to a report in the Daily Mail.\n\nMurdoch’s most recent marriage to actress and model Jerry Hall ended in divorce in 2022 after six years.\n\nHe was briefly engaged last year to former San Francisco police chaplain Ann Lesley Smith, though the pair called off the engagement weeks later.\n\nVanity Fair reported the break-up, citing one source who said Murdoch had grown uncomfortable with Smith’s outspoken evangelical views.\n\nMurdoch first tied the knot in 1956 at age 25 to Patricia Booker. He then wed Anna Maria Torv in 1967, Deng in 1999 and Hall in 2016.\n\nMoraga is the same venue where Murdoch and Walt Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger first discussed Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, a $US71 billion deal that closed in 2019."
