        "text": "First marriage to Patricia Booker\n\nPeople magazine reports that Murdoch’s first wife was Booker, a flight attendant and part-time department store model. They were married in 1956 when Murdoch was 25, and their first daughter Prudence was born two years later.\n\nTheir marriage lasted 11 years and dissolved in 1967. In 1969, Booker married Freddie Maeder, a man Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff characterizes as a \"bad-news Swiss jet-setter,\" according to the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nIt is reported that Booker died in 1998.\n\nSecond marriage to Anna Torv\n\nThe billionaire wed journalist Torv, who is now 80, the same year he divorced his first wife. The Independent reports that they met while Torv was employed at Murdoch’s Sydney newspaper, the Daily Mirror.\n\nTheir marriage spanned 32 years, ending in a divorce in 1999, with Torv receiving a settlement of US$1.2 billion in assets.\n\nMurdoch and Torv had three children together: daughter Elisabeth, and sons Lachlan and James.\n\nThird marriage to Wendi Deng\n\nMerely 17 days after his divorce from Torv was finalized, Murdoch married his third wife Deng, who is 38 years his junior. It is reported that they first met at a company party when Murdoch was 67 and Deng was 29.\n\nTheir marriage concluded in 2013, and they share two daughters: Grace and Kelly.\n\nFourth marriage to Jerry Hall\n\nIntroduced by mutual acquaintances, Murdoch married model Hall, now 68, in London in 2016. Hall had previously been in a long-term relationship with Mick Jagger, the lead singer of the English rock band Rolling Stones.\n\nTheir marriage ended in 2022.\n\nBrief engagement to Ann Lesley Smith\n\nThe engagement between Murdoch and former radio host Smith, now 68, was made public in 2023, as reported by The New York Times. They had initially planned to marry that summer. However, the wedding was abruptly called off just two weeks after the announcement of their engagement.\n\nFifth marriage to retired molecular biologist Elena Zhukova\n\nMurdoch and Elena Zhukova, 67, married on June 1 at Moraga, Murdoch’s vineyard and estate in California, according to AFP. They were introduced by his ex-wife Wendi Deng.\n\nZhukova’s daughter Dasha Zhukova, an arts patron and entrepreneur, was previously married to Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.\n\nAs of June 6, Murdoch, whose media holdings include The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and other prominent outlets, along with his family, is valued at US$19.8 billion by Forbes.\n\nHe relinquished control of his global media empire to his son Lachlan last November, transitioning to an emeritus role."
