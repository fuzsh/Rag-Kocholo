        "text": "Last Monday I found myself embedded deep in the heartland of the Murdoch media machine as old friends, colleagues and rivals gathered in a vast Sydney movie studio to celebrate the life of entertainment executive, showbiz impresario and esteemed raconteur Brian Walsh.\n\nWalsh, who launched Foxtel, had worked for the Murdochs for decades. There was chatter Rupert Murdoch, 92, might bring his new fiancée, Ann Lesley Smith, 66. Anticipation was high.\n\nTo my left was Murdoch’s heir apparent, eldest son Lachlan, with wife Sarah. They looked to be still very much in love after nearly a quarter of a century of marriage.\n\nTo my right were a couple of Rupert Murdoch’s most trusted lieutenants who for decades worked within his vast news machine and got to know their somewhat enigmatic proprietor better than most.\n\nSadly, Murdoch senior never materialised. Later I whispered in jest to one of his cronies: “I guess you boys are busy planning Rupert’s next buck’s party?”\n\nWe laughed, but there was no further comment on that particular subject coming my way, a gossip columnist from the enemy camp.\n\nThree days later and the buck’s party was a dead duck. Vanity Fair revealed Rupert Murdoch’s two-week engagement to Smith, a former dental hygienist turned country music singer and right-wing evangelist, was off.\n\nMurdoch and Smith are yet to make a public comment on the matter.\n\nApparently Rupert, who had dropped around $3.5 million on an 11-carat Asscher-cut diamond solitaire engagement ring, couldn’t take much more of her preaching.\n\nNot even Murdoch’s own New York Post could have dreamed up a better tabloid zinger, providing a convenient distraction from the far more uncomfortable news of the looming Dominion defamation case he is currently starring in.\n\nIndeed, the many wives of Rupert Murdoch have become one of the more fascinating aspects of the businessman’s much-storied life.\n\nJust as Elizabeth Taylor endured jibes and scrutiny for her eight marriages, Murdoch’s marital history has once again come under the public spotlight.\n\nThere have been countless opinion pieces and analysis from relationship experts published on why he would even want to get hitched yet again.\n\nNo doubt the four previous Mrs Murdochs would be wondering too, curious as to what it will take to become the last Mrs Murdoch now the billionaire is officially back on the market.\n\nMrs Murdoch No.1 was the glamorous Patricia Booker, a flight attendant and department store model from Melbourne. They married in 1956 when Rupert was just 25. They had one child, daughter Prudence, now 65.\n\nThey divorced in 1967. Two years later, aged 9, Prudence persuaded her father to seek custody after her mother remarried Freddie Maeder, described by Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff as a “bad-news Swiss jet-setter”. Booker died in 1998, and by all accounts sounds like she was far too extroverted for the reserved Murdoch.\n\nMrs Murdoch No.2 was the former Daily Mirror reporter Anna Torv. For decades she looked to be Murdoch’s genetically-blessed perfect fit.\n\nTheir 32-year marriage produced three children: Elisabeth, Lachlan and James, but it came to a spectacular end in 1998 as an army of lawyers went into battle over the spoils of the Murdoch fortune. Anna wasn’t going without a fight.\n\n‘Perhaps I was in love with the idea of still being in love with him. But the Rupert I fell in love with could not have behaved this way.’\n\nRupert Murdoch’s second wife Anna Torv\n\nIn a 2001 interview with The Australian Women’s Weekly, Anna broke her silence on the marital demise, saying : “I began to think the Rupert Murdoch that I loved died a long time ago. Perhaps I was in love with the idea of still being in love with him. But the Rupert I fell in love with could not have behaved this way.”\n\nShe described his actions during their breakup as “extremely hard, ruthless and determined”, hardly the cuddly romantic so beguiled by the Chinese beauty Wendi Deng.\n\nEnter stage right Mrs Murdoch No.3. Murdoch was 67 when he met 29-year-old Deng at a company party in Hong Kong. They were married two years later, 17 days after the ink had dried on his divorce from Anna.\n\nThey were married for 14 years, producing two children Grace, 22, and Chloe, 20.\n\nDuring the marriage, Wendi was credited with encouraging Rupert to dye his hair a suspicious mahogany tint and making him dress in a more youthful manner. She enlisted personal trainers and once reportedly divulged that her husband didn’t “need” Viagra.\n\nRupert filed for divorce in June 2013 stating the marriage had “broken down irretrievably.” This followed rumours about Wendi’s close relationship with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair."
