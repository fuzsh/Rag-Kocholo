        "text": "(Ecns.cn)--The world was shocked by Wendi Deng Murdoch, who lunged at her husband Rupert Murdoch's pie-tossing attacker on July 19 during a Parliament hearing in the recent phone-hacking scandal.\n\nThe Internet was suddenly rocked by the question: \"Who is Wendi Deng?\"\n\nGold digger or Tiger Mother?\n\nTo some, Wendi was no longer the \"gold digger\" that many had thought she was.\n\nDeng first came into the spotlight in June 1999 when she married Rupert Murdoch only 17 days after he divorced his second wife of 31 years, Anna Murdoch Mann. At that time, Wendi was just 31 years old, while Murdoch was 69.\n\nIt came as no surprise that many doubted whether true love had ever existed between them.\n\nSome reporters even described it as \"a marriage to China,\" claiming that Murdoch was in fact eyeing the huge Chinese market.\n\nHowever, to some, Wendi's agile rush to defend her husband smashed the rumors, showing that \"she is still a woman who longs for love,\" reported CNN, quoting MissQccc's tweets. \"The harder she slapped, the more we can tell how eager she was to protect her husband.\"\n\nReal-life Vanity Fair\n\nLike Becky Sharp in William Makepeace Thackeray's famous novel Vanity Fair, the strong-willed and cunning Wendi Deng has successfully made her way to the upper crust of society.\n\nShe first met Rupert Murdoch in 1993 at a cocktail party after taking an internship at Star Television in Hong Kong, an Asian TV service owned by Murdoch's News Corporation.\n\nBy \"accidentally\" spilling her wine on Mr. Murdoch, Wendi got a chance to talk to her boss for over two hours.\n\nNot long after, Wendi became Murdoch's interpreter in China, and later his lover.\n\nThe marriage with Murdoch was not Wendi's first. In the 1990s she had been married to Jake Cherry, a former UNICEF executive who had not only helped her study English but also sponsored a student visa for her to study at California State University (CSU).\n\nThey divorced after just two years and seven months, but that was enough to secure Wendi a green card allowing her to stay in the US permanently.\n\nWendi was later admitted to the School of Management at Yale University, where she earned her master's degree in business administration.\n\nCrouching Wendi, hidden dragon\n\nNow dubbed \"crouching Wendi, hidden dragon\" by foreign media, 20 years ago she was no more than an ordinary-looking Chinese girl.\n\nBorn to a poor engineer's family in Jinan, capital of Shandong Province, and raised in Hangzhou of Zhejiang Province, her family moved to Guangzhou when she was 16, where she attended medical school according to her parents' wishes.\n\n\"My father was Cantonese. He hoped that I would become a successful doctor in his hometown,\" recalled Wendi.\n\nHowever, the ambitious girl eventually dropped out of school and flew to America in 1988 to realize her bigger dreams.\n\nShe was a super student according to Daniel Blake, professor at CSU. A project she worked on analyzing how fiscal policies affect the American economy won her team first place, added Blake.\n\nA consummate opportunist, the Chinese \"Cinderella\" finally grew into a \"Queen\" by marrying the \"Media King.\"\n\nBy giving birth to two children, Grace and Chloe, Wendi further secured her position in Murdoch's media empire.\n\n\"All my children will have a chance to take over for me in the future,\" announced Murdoch in June 2003, when Chloe was born. \"Though Grace and Chloe are still very little, they will enjoy the same commitment I made to their elder siblings.\"\n\nWendi was even invited to the White House earlier this year, along with other Chinese celebrities, including Kung Fu star Jackie Chan."
