Rupert Murdoch is getting married again.

The media mogul, 93, is set to wed Elena Zhukova, 67, a retired molecular biologist who grew up in the Soviet Union and immigrated to the U.S. in 1991. They began dating last summer, and the first reported news of their engagement last month.

Murdoch and Zhukova reportedly were introduced by Murdoch's third wife, Wendi Deng. Murdoch has been married four times before, to (in order) Patricia Booker, Anna Torv, Deng, and Jerry Hall (Murdoch and Hall divorced in August 2022). He was engaged last year to Ann Lesley Smith, but they called off their engagement a year ago, with a source saying it was because Murdoch was "increasingly uncomfortable with Smithâ€™s outspoken evangelical views."

Murdoch has six children: Elisabeth (with Booker), Lachlan, James, and Elizabeth (with Torv), Grace, and Chloe (with Deng). He stepped down as chairman of Fox and News Corp. this past November, and Lachlan replaced him. This will be Zhukova's third marriage; she was previously married to Alexander Zhukova and George Gause. She has three children: a daughter, Dasha (with Zhukova) and twins, Yurii and Katya (with Guase). Dasha was married to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich before they split in 2017, and she is now married to Greek billionaire Philip Stavros Niarchos.
