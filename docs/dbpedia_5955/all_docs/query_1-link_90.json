Names can be sent to Living in Recovery via their email at [email protected].\n\nJoin us to remember and honor loved ones we’ve lost to overdose.\n\nInternational Overdose Awareness Day (IOAD) is observed each August 31. On this day, communities worldwide come together to reduce overdose stigma, increase understanding and awareness, remember those who died of overdose, and prevent drug-related harm.\n\nFor IOAD, SAFE will host a community vigil from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. at Wrentham Town Common. Vigil attendees are encouraged to bring pictures of the loved ones they are honoring.\n\nAt 8:00 PM on 8/31/24 we are asking all communities to light their homes, business, programs, and community spaces with purple lights/bulbs and post LIVE or post a picture to social media (locally) #WMALightsItPurpleOverdoseAwareness2024 and Internationally to #TogetherWeCan, #EndOverdose, #IOAD2024, followed by a moment of silence in the region to honor the memory of those we have lost."
