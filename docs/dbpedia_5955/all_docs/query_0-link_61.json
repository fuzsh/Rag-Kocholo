        "text": "BARNSTABLE – Ten incoming college freshmen were presented with scholarships Thursday by the Kraig Andre’ Diggs Scholarship Foundation.\n\nThe scholarships honor the late Kraig Diggs, who died in 2016.\n\nKraig’s parents, Carmen and Kip, presented the students with the scholarships at Liberty Hall in Marstons Mills.\n\nKraig Diggs was among four young men killed in a head-on crash on Route 495 in Middleboro in 2016. A wrong-way driver struck the vehicle in which Diggs and the others were riding.\n\nThis was the first year of scholarships provided by the foundation.\n\nKip Diggs wants to see this gift to the community grow every year.\n\n“We really want to have kind of an alumni that’s going to continue,” Diggs explained.\n\n“We want to pass the torch along. Like we’re doing to them, we want them to do for us.”\n\nBoth Carmen and Kip were appreciative of the support they have received from their community in creating the foundation. What started as just an idea, Kip explained, has now become a reality.\n\n“It’s been a community. And when I say community, everybody that was a donor, sponsor, that knew Kraig, that helped volunteer, it’s all of us,” Diggs said.\n\nThe Kraig Andre’ Diggs Scholarship Foundation is also preparing for Kraig’s Dodgeball Tournament on September 28 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Barnstable High School, to benefit the scholarship fund.\n\nThe first tournament was held last year. For information on this year’s event, and to learn more about the foundation, visit kraigsdodgeballtournament.com.\n\nThe following students received scholarships from The Kraig Andre’ Diggs Scholarship Foundation:\n\n-Payton Walker, Cape Cod Regional Technical High School (not pictured)\n\n-Anthony Karson, Falmouth High School\n\n-Erin Lavin, Falmouth High School\n\n-Renee Levesque, Dennis Yarmouth High School\n\n-Andrew Longobardi, Dennis Yarmouth High School\n\n-Hannah Mitchell, Monomoy Regional High School\n\n-Jared Bianchi, Sturgis East Charter Public School\n\n-Stone Johnson, Sturgis West Charter Public School\n\n-Olivia Berler, Barnstable High School\n\n-Kalyani Clarke, Barnstable High School"
