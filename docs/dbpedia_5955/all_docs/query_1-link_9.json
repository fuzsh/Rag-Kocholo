Vol. XXXV, No. 7, P. 3.\n\nNew Bedford Daguerreotype Rooms, No. 57 Union Street, (Over the Store of Maj. J. H. Collins) Mr. Bryant having availed himself of the tuition of the most celebrated Professor of Photography in New England in taking Miniatures, Views, &c. has the satisfaction of announcing to his fellow citizens that he is fully prepared to give beautiful specimens of this most wonderful art. Specimens of the Daguerreotype can be seen at the rooms of Mr. B. that cannot be surpassed by any artist, except such as may have availed of the same opportunities and experience. His instruments are of the most perfect kind, manufactured expressly for the celebrated Studio of Professor Darling, of Boston, with whom arrangements are made for the supply of every thing requisite in the art. A perfect Daguerreotype portraiture is the only means of treasuring the semblance of Nature’s dearest objects and affections—and the fair sex is Nature’s choicest model of the beautiful—ladies, therefore are particularly invited to call and examine the beautiful results of this wonderful discovery.\n\nSeamen also, who are about to depart on long voyages, cannot leave a more acceptable testimonial of affection to a dear friend than an exact transcript of their person, which can be produced in less than one minute at the rooms of Mr. B.\n\nAs this establishment is intended to be permanent, a few pupils can be instructed, where they may remain for a longer or shorter time—suiting their own convenience—by which means they can satisfy themselves of their competency in the art. Terms moderate. Also apparatus, and other articles necessary in the art, can be furnished on the same terms as at the Studio of Professor Darling, in Boston.\n\nAll communications—post paid—directed to P. Bryant, no. 57 Union Street, will be punctually attended to.\n\nAdvertisement ran from August 20, 1841 to September 10, 1841.\n\n1853 Address Unknown, Barnstable, Massachusetts.[1]\n\n1856 30 Purchase Street, New Bedford, Massachusetts.1\n\n1856-1862 123 Washington Street, Boston, Massachusetts.1\n\n1860-1866 Address Unknown, Chelsea, Massachusetts.1\n\n1867 137 Broadway, Chelsea, Massachusetts.1\n\n1868-1870 139 Broadway, Chelsea, Massachusetts.1\n\n1871 Address Unknown, Chelsea, Massachusetts.1\n\n1872-1873 182 Broadway, Chelsea, Massachusetts.1\n\n1874-1882 Address Unknown, Chelsea, Massachusetts.1\n\n1853 March 4.

Is taken upon fine plate glass; an indestructible cement is then poured upon the picture, and another plate of glass pressed upon it. The cement soon hardens, and the two plates in effect become one, with the picture in the centre, as permanent as the glass itself, and will remain unchanged for ages. They can be taken in one quarter the time of Daguerreotypes, and of any size They are not reversed; can be seen in any light: hence are very suitable for frames, lockets, and pins.
