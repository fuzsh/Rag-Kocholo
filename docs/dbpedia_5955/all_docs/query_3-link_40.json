        "text": "Determining the Facts\n\nReading 1: Excerpts from “Kill the Indian, and Save the Man,” 1892, presented by Richard Henry Pratt\n\nCaptain Richard Henry Pratt fought for the United States against Native American Tribes including the Comanche, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Kiowa. After the U.S. won the “Indian Wars,” Pratt founded the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He presented his thoughts at the Nineteenth Annual Conference of Charities and Correction in 1892. He is famous for his philosophy: “Kill the Indian, and Save the Man.” Complete version.\n\nCarlisle has always planted treason to the tribe and loyalty to the nation at large. It has preached against colonizing Indians, and in favor of individualizing them. It has demanded for them the same multiplicity of chances which all others in the country enjoy.\n\nCarlisle fills young Indians with the spirit of loyalty to the stars and stripes, and then moves them out into our communities to show by their conduct and ability that the Indian is no different from the white or the colored, that he has the inalienable right to liberty and opportunity that the white and the negro have.\n\nCarlisle does not dictate to him what line of life he should fill, so it is an honest one. It says to him that, if he gets his living by the sweat of his brow, and demonstrates to the nation that he is a man, he does more good for his race than hundreds of his fellows who cling to their tribal communistic surroundings. . . .\n\n…. When we cease to teach the Indian that he is less than a man; when we recognize fully that he is capable in all respects as we are….—\n\nThen the Indian will quickly demonstrate that he can be truly civilized, and he himself will solve the question of what to do with the Indian.\n\nQuestions for Reading 1\n\n1) What was “Carlisle”? Explain.\n\n2) Who is the speaker and what audience did he address? What identities do you think the speaker might claim (gender, race, nationality, etc)?\n\n3) What is Pratt’s argument? In your own words, explain what he believed Carlisle could do for American Indians.\n\n4) What do you think Pratt meant by the term “truly civilized”? Describe traits and activities you think Pratt would view as civilized.\n\nDetermining the Facts\n\nReading 2: Building the Carlisle Indian Industrial School\n\nThe students arrived at the school at midnight on October 6, 1879. They traveled by horse, steamboat, and train from the Rosebud and Pine Ridge Indian reservations in South Dakota to Carlisle, Pennsylvania. They came at night so white Americans would not come to stare at them, but even in the darkness a crowd waited. They were the first of thousands of young American Indians to attend Carlisle Indian Industrial School and Carlisle was the first of many American Indian boarding schools.\n\nThe United States founded the Carlisle school in 1879 at the site of an old military base, used during the colonial era and the Civil War. Soldiers also used it as an army training school from 1838 to 1871. The same buildings were used for the Indian Industrial School. One reason the government chose this site was because it was on a railroad line. Students could travel there by train. The school was also a far distance from the western Indian reservations. The distance kept the students away from their families’ cultures and influence for long periods of time. Some students never returned home.\n\nRichard Henry Pratt was a U.S. military officer who founded the school. He went into education after leading troops to fight American Indian nations during the Indian Wars and is famous for his boarding school philosophy: “Kill the Indian, Save the Man.” Pratt believed American Indian children could become successful American citizens if they abandoned their heritage. He wanted to change what made them different from Americans descended from Europeans, including their clothing, language, and beliefs. After opening the school at Carlisle, Pratt and his supporters forced young people to attend the school for three to five years. Some chose to stay as long as 10 years.\n\nCarlisle Barracks was in good condition when the school opened. Students lived on the north end of the campus. Teachers, staff, and the superintendent lived on the southern side near the entrance. A large green space or quadrangle separated the grounds from the north and the south. Students and teachers moved across the center of campus while using crisscrossing through footpaths, a bandstand, and a stone guardhouse.\n\nIn the early 1880s, the American Indian students and the white staff expanded the school campus. They built a chapel, three-story dining hall, classroom building, girls’ dormitory, warehouse, boiler house, laundry, hospital, printing shop, an art studio, and a cemetery. They also added a six-foot fence around the perimeter of the campus.\n\nCivilian school officials enforced military-style discipline at Carlisle. Students marched across the grounds to and from their classes, the dining hall, extra-curricular activities, and for regular inspections. They marched in groups like soldiers in military drills. When officials rang a bell, they shifted to new movements. If a student disobeyed a rule, they went to the guardhouse for punishment or were sentenced to hard labor.\n\nSchool officials tried to make the American Indian students look and dress like white Americans. Carlisle staff cut off the long braids of male children, took away the children’s personal or tribal clothing, moccasins, and family belongings. Students could not keep medicine bags, jewelry, or ceremonial rattles. These items often had special meanings to tribes. While at Carlisle, boys wore uniforms from morning until night and girls wore long, confining Victorian dresses. The school administrators also assigned a new English name to each child and did not allow native languages to be spoken. Administrators took “before and after” photos of students. These photos showed children in the style of their home cultures “before” and in the style of Anglo Americans “after.” People who supported assimilation used the photos as propaganda to show politicians and the American public that cultural assimilation was working.\n\nPratt and his teachers taught American school subjects as well as hands-on training. Their goal was to prepare American Indian students to work jobs outside of the reservation. Students studied English, math, geography, and music. Boys learned industrial skills. They were taught to build furniture and work with wood, iron, steel, tin, and other materials. Girls learned home skills. They learned to cook, do laundry, bake, and perform other caretaking skills. Students also participated in an “outing” system where they lived and worked with white American families in eastern Pennsylvania. They had to speak English and hold jobs to earn money while they were away from school.\n\nStudents at Carlisle were in sports teams, debate clubs, and marching bands. The school teams competed against prominent non-Indian schools and in regional championships. One of the greatest athletes of the 20th century attended Carlisle: Jim Thorpe of the Sac and Fox Nation. Thorpe won athletic competitions as a Carlisle student, won two gold medals in the 1912 Summer Olympics, and went on to be a professional football player. The Carlisle band was famous, too. It performed at presidential inaugurations while the school was open.\n\nOver ten thousand children attended Carlisle between 1879 and 1918, with roughly 1,000 on campus in a given school year. They came from over 142 Indian nations. These nations had many different languages and cultures. Most students were Sioux, Chippewa, Cherokee, Cheyenne, Menominee, and Alaskan Native. Some students graduated in their late teens or early twenties but others left early due to illness or homesickness.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs founded 24 more American Indian boarding schools after Carlisle. Under the same military-style discipline, students at these schools learned domestic and industrial skills. The staff forced them to speak English and tried to destroy their ties to traditional cultures. In 1928 the U.S. government reported findings that children were abused, overworked, and underfed. Most off-reservation schools closed by the 1930s when Americans learned about how students were treated. Politicians chose to stop or decrease funding to the schools. Three schools are still open as of 2016. These three schools have military-style discipline but also teach American Indian customs, languages, and skills instead of trying to erase them.\n\nThe Carlisle campus returned to U.S. Army control in 1918. It was a hospital for soldiers injured in World War I. The historic school buildings in the 21st Century are home to the U.S. Army War College. Descendants of Carlisle students and members of tribes represented at Carlisle visit the school to honor the memory of the students.\n\nQuestions for Reading 2\n\n1) When did Carlisle Indian Industrial School open? What was the site used for before it became a school?\n\n2) Carlisle students came from over 100 different American Indian nations and cultures. What did they have in common? In what ways do you think they were different from each other? Explain your answers.\n\n3) Using evidence from Reading 2, list three ways that attending Carlisle was like being in the military. How did the buildings and landscape support a military culture?\n\n4) Consider the effects of the boarding school system. How do you think the Indian Boarding School system affected the American Indian tribes and cultures? Do you think Pratt was successful or unsuccessful (did he “Kill the Indian, Save the Man”)? Why or why not?\n\nDetermining the Facts\n\nReading 3: Two Articles from March 9, 1888 edition of The Indian Helper newspaper\n\nThe Carlisle school newspaper, The Indian Helper, published this letter on March 9, 1888.\n\n“LETTER HOME”\n\nDear Mother-Shah-Ru-Rah-Wah-Kee:\n\nToday is home letter again I want to tell you something about our school. I think our school house will be torn down in this spring and rebuilt because Congress has promised to have new school house this coming spring, and I hope may be as large as our Quarters.\n\nIt seems too that the Carlisle is going on and on, as you know that I left you in 1883. And I came at this school, and saw the old dining room was too narrow and there was but one story high. The tables were standing close together, and the boys’ Quarters were only two stories high one great big doors on big hinges too, like horse stable.\n\nThe boys were sleeping in the same room sometime sixteen or eighteen boys each room. They made great noise and could hardly think something to study because too much noise. I don’t like it at all and so I did not stay a great while I went out on the country, and there I spent one year and a half. I returned in 1885 and I got back and I saw a great big dining room which had been built up since I was away.\n\nAgain I went out and stayed only six months and came back again. That was in 1886 Capt. Pratt and us boys began to think about it that our boys spent so much money foolishly and so Capt. Pratt’s disciplinarian called attention and all the boys were present, all the boys put some money in that collection.\n\nAgain I went into the country. I was very much surprised that I came back and saw a great big building extending toward west to east three stories high. Hallo! New Quarters I said, and I saw Little Boys’ Quarters, they just starting to build and was finished both Little Boys’ Quarters and a new Gymnasium last Nov. 1887. Now we are comfortable everything is going on all right. Big new gymnasium I think all the boys and girls like it because we are going to have a sociable once a month. -- LUTHER KUHNS\n\nThe front page of the newspaper included a note: “THE INDIAN HELPER is PRINTED by Indian boys, but EDITED by The-Man-on-the-band-stand, who is NOT an Indian.”\n\nOne of our subscribers asks this question: Will you please explain why you are called \"The Man-on-the-band-stand?\" If the questioner were at Carlisle, he would know why. The Band-stand commands the whole situation. From it he can see all the quarters, the printing office, the chapel, the grounds, everything and everybody, all the girls and the boys on the walks, at the windows, everywhere. Nothing escapes the Man-on-the-bandstand.\n\nQuestions for Reading 3\n\n1) What is the source of Reading 3? Who is Luther Kuhns and what does he describe in his letter? Who do you think the “Man-on-the-Band-Stand” might be?\n\n2) Make a list of the buildings and places at Carlisle that the newspaper described. Based on the description, does your school or community have a place like Carlisle? What is its purpose?\n\n3) Who makes decisions about Luther’s life? Who controls where he eats, sleeps, and travels? How is it similar and different to your life?\n\n4) Name two possible audiences for Luther’s letter. Explain why each audience might be interested in the contents of the letter. Why do you think Luther wrote the letter?\n\nVisual Evidence\n\nPhoto 1: Indian School Band and Girls Quarters, Carlisle, PA, 1909.\n\nPutting it All Together\n\nUse the following activities to deepen your students' engagement with the topics and themes introduced in the lesson, and to help them develop essential skills.\n\nActivity 1: Controlling Culture, Controlling History: The Power in Telling History\n\nThe United States and American Indian tribes waged formal and informal wars since the nation’s founding. Many of the children who attended Carlisle were from tribes that had just surrendered or were suppressed by the U.S. military after generations of conflict. Richard Henry Pratt discussed that his first students were prisoners of war from Indian Territory in the American Missionary Journal Volume 37, Issue 4.\n\nOne tool used to dominate a culture is to write or rewrite its history and the history of Native America can be hotly contested. In this activity, give students the power historians have to interpret the past.\n\nHave your students create timelines to illustrate the history of a tribal nation or single American Indian culture represented at Carlisle. The timeline can include political, social, cultural, and legal landmarks and eras. Students can use arts and crafts to create a paper timeline or create a digital timeline online. A quick internet search will help you identify the best program for your students.\n\nThe timelines should include the tribes' own perspectives and histories as well as traditional U.S. narratives. Students should not limit their sources to Anglo-American authors. At least one source must be authored by a member of that tribe. After students complete their timelines, ask the class if they were surprised by anything they learned. Did the history from their tribal sources conflict with what they read in their textbook? Did it conflict with the other sources they used? Ask your students why Native Americans might tell a different version of 19th century history compared to the history a non-Native would tell.\n\nActivity 2: Historic American Indian Boarding Schools Beyond Carlisle\n\nThe Carlisle Indian Industrial School became a model for many more off-reservation boarding schools across the U.S. in the early 20th century. These schools followed Richard Pratt’s “Kill the Indian and Save the Man” philosophy. Have your students learn more about the history of this movement by studying other historic boarding schools, the experiences of people who attended them, and how they compare to Carlisle.\n\nAssign to small groups or each student one historic, off-reservation school for a research project and report. The report you assign can take the form of an essay, research paper, oral presentation, or poster presentation depending on time, resources, and ability. You may even want to give students the option to choose how they want to report, ensuring that students treat the material with appropriate seriousness and respect. Students should not demonstrate their knowledge of the material through skits, since acting out racism and violence can create an unwelcoming classroom environment.\n\nYou can find schools for your students to study with the National Register for Historic Places database (historic site descriptions are available as .PDFs) or through a web search. Then, ask your students to do their own research on the web or in the library to report on their school.\n\nThey should provide the following in their reports:\n\nOfficial mission or philosophy of the school\n\nDescription of the campus, including architectural and geographical features of the school\n\nClasses and extra-curricular activities the school offered\n\nYear the school opened, closed, and explanation why it closed\n\nLocation and distance of the school from nearest reservations\n\nThe tribal identities represented at the school\n\nAn anecdote or description of what life was like for students at the school\n\nSome of the schools listed on the National Register of Historic Places include Chemawa Indian School Site, Phoenix Indian School Historic District, Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, Pipestone Indian School Superintendent’s Residence, and the Haskell Institute (Haskell Indian Industrial School).\n\nThe students should end their report with examples of how their school was similar to and different from Carlisle. They should use at least one primary source as evidence and at least one source created by a Native American who wrote about the school and/or graduated from it.\n\nStudents may learn during this activity that some boarding schools did not close. If time allows, play the 2008 NPR story about modern school experiences in Sherman Indian High School, California: “American Indian School a Far Cry from the Past.”\n\nActivity 3: Explore Disease at Carlisle with Science and Empathy\n\nDisease was one reason why many Indian Boarding Schools closed. Though not the reason Carlisle shut down, at least 168 children who attended Carlisle died from tuberculosis, pneumonia, and the flu at the school. Another 500 students were sent home when they got sick and were too weak to study. A cemetery was built on the school grounds and remains today as a place to honor and reflect on the students who died.\n\nAssign poster presentations to each student about one of the three main illnesses that spread among Carlisle students. Posters should provide a basic description of the disease including symptoms and how it is spread. It should also display images of the disease affecting a cell, or diagrams of body systems or organs affected. Lastly, have students incorporate artwork onto the poster that memorializes Carlisle students buried at the cemetery. Suggest that they look up images of the cemetery or news articles about recent visits to the cemetery by members of the public to aid in the visualization of the site.\n\nHave students give a 2-3 minute oral presentation to the class with their findings and ideas behind their artwork. Wrap up the presentations with a brief discussion about the spread of disease at Carlisle. Have your students comment on ways a student might have been infected in a classroom or crowded dormitory at the school. Ask them how the spread of disease may have been prevented.\n\nActivity 4: Preserving American Indian Past, Present, and Future\n\nIn the lesson about Carlisle Indian Industrial School, your students learned about ways Native Americans lost their culture. Ask your students to study the ways American Indians work to recover and preserve languages, sacred knowledge, and heritage sites today.\n\nExplain to your students that while the United States government tried to erase American Indian cultures in the 1800s and during most of the 20th century, too, an American Indian and Indigenous Civil Rights movement in the 1970s led to greater visibility and political power for those groups. The Indian boarding school experience may have fed such political activism and the Pan-Indian movement. In the 21st century, the U.S. Department of the Interior supports Tribal Historic Preservation Offices that are operated by sovereign tribal nations and carries out the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act to return sacred objects to tribes.\n\nIn this activity, as individuals or in small groups, have your students investigate either the preservation of a type of cultural knowledge (language, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, significant places, crafts and artisanal skills) in the United states OR a single sovereign tribe’s efforts to preserve their whole culture.\n\nYour students may focus on a regional group to emphasize state and local history or a different region of North America, if they are studying U.S. history.\n\nFirst, ask your students to develop a research question to focus their work. Next, have them search the internet to find examples of how American Indians work to recover the culture and traditions that schools like Carlisle and men like Pratt tried to “kill.” Tell your students to use only websites authored by American Indian tribes or websites that end in .edu, .gov, or .org to avoid commercial sources.\n\nHave students present what they learn in an essay, oral presentation, or short video that they can play for the whole class. They should also submit an annotated bibliography that lists their internet sources and explains why each is a trustworthy source of information.\n\nActivity 5: Making Global Connections at Carlisle\n\nThe United States’ efforts to dominate conquered groups’ lands and cultures were not unique in world history, and the U.S. Federal government did more to assimilate American Indians than create boarding schools. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the U.S. government tried to change American Indian society through other policies and laws. Another example is the Dawes Act and General Allotment Act of 1887, which divided traditionally communal tribal land among individual members of that tribe. Throughout human history, other global powers acted in similar ways toward people whose land they conquered. This activity has students study other U.S. policies intended to control American Indians and to compare/contrast those policies with the methods of control used by other colonial powers.\n\nAssign different, specific colonial periods as research projects to your students working in pairs or small groups. Have each student group study their assigned colonial era and list the policies used by the colonial government to control the colonized culture. Then, have your students identify U.S. policies toward indigenous groups in the late 19th century and compare/contrast the policies of the two governments.\n\nExamples of other colonial situations that you may assign are Portuguese rule in Angola, French rule in Martinique, Dutch rule in Southern Africa, Chinese rule in Tibet, British rule in Canada, Roman rule in Gaul, and Russian rule in Romania. If the colonial history is long, students may wish to narrow down to a specific period, such as 16th century Spanish colonial rule in Mexico.\n\nHave your students document how the colonial government and the U.S. government controlled or tried to control the colonized culture through education, religion, style of dress and appearance, labor practices, land use, and family structure.\n\nHave each group produce a table on their findings, outlining the similarities and differences of assimilation policies used by the United States and other colonial powers. Finally, have them write a paragraph to explain what might explain differences and similarities to the tactics the two governments used to control and/or assimilate the colonized groups.\n\nIf time and resources allow, have your students produce a poster board exhibit where each group displays their table and has an opportunity to present what they found in their research"
