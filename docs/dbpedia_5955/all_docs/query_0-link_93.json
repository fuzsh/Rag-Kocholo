It is bounded north-west by Plymouth County, and west by Buzzard's Bay. Cape Cod lies in the form of an arm, half open: the elbow is at Chatham, twenty miles east of the town of Barnstable, which is the county seat. The whole length of the Cape is sixty five miles, and the average breadth about five miles. Below the town of Barnstable the soil is composed mostly of sand; and the people in considerable degree depend upon Boston, and other large places, for their meats and breads tuffs. It possesses, however, unrivaled privileges for the cod, mackerel, and other fisheries. The county has comparatively little wood, but has many valuable peat meadows, in which, of late years, the cranberry has been successfully cultivated. The county is supplied with an abundance of pure soft water. Formerly large quantities of salt were manufactured on the Cape, which was used in the curing of fish. Of late years this branch of industry has diminished; so that in 1865 the value of salt manufactured in the county was only $52,719.00, while the aggregate value of other articles produced during the same year was six million ninety thousand and twenty two dollars ($6,090,022), of which nearly two millions and a quarter were derived from the cod and mackerel fisheries,  with which and the coasting trade almost every family is more or less identified and interested. Barnstable County is noted for its good sailors and men of superior nautical talents, while its women are equally celebrated \" for their fair complexions and good housewifery.\"\n\nIts people are the most homogeneous in the State, never having received a large infusion of new blood. It is not a desirable place for foreign settlement. The county, therefore, retains its old names, and its people their good old ways; yet in no portion of the State will one find a more intelligent and well bred people, in no community is there a more equal distribution of wealth, or a more genuine feeling of generous but unobtrusive hospitality.\n\nThere are but thirteen towns in Barnstable County, one of the largest and most important of which, at the present time, is Provincetown, at the extreme end of the Cape, whose capacious harbor is one of the best on the Atlantic coast. In 1860 the population of the county was 35,990, in 1865 it was 34,489, being a decrease in five years of 1,501. The valuation of the county in 1860 was $12,621,291.00, in 1865 it was $14,276,-198.00, showing an increase in five years of $1,654,907.00.\n\nThe number of men which Barnstable County furnished for the war was reported by the selectmen of the towns, in 1866, to have been 2,305. This return must have been altogether incorrect : the number could not have been less than thirty six or thirty seven hundred, the percentage of men furnished throughout the Commonwealth being about 9£ to every 100 inhabitants ; and that Barnstable County was not behind any other portion of the State is conclusively shown by the fact, well ascertained and indisputable, that each of its towns filled its contingent of men upon every call of the President, and at the end of the war each was credited with having furnished a surplus over and above every demand, which in the aggregate amounted to three hundred and nine men. The total expenses of the towns on account of the war was $308,985.08. This is exclusive of $90,934.84, which was raised and paid for State aid to soldiers' families during the four years of the war, and which was reimbursed by the State. Total, $399,919.92.\n\nThe following is the record of each town in the county:\n\nBarnstable\n\nIncorporated Sept. 3, 1639. Population in 1860, 5,129; in 1865, 4,913. Valuation in 1860, $2,041,534; in 1865, $2,265,407.\n\nThe selectmen in 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, and 1865, were Charles C. Bearse, Ebenezer Bacon, and Joseph R. Hull.\n\nThe town clerk and town treasurer during the same period was Frederick G. Kelley.\n\n1861\n\nThe first legal town meeting, to act upon matters relating to the war, was held on the 4th of May, at which it was Voted, To pay each volunteer belonging to Barnstable, \" who has enlisted, or may enlist, in the service of the United States, whether upon the land or upon the sea,\" the sum of forty dollars to aid them \"in fitting for the service.\"\n\nVoted, To support the families of those who enlist and are citizens of Barnstable \"during the whole time the head of the family is actually employed in the service.\"\n\nVoted, To appropriate one thousand dollars, \" to be placed at the disposal of the Governor of the State for the assistance of the troops of the State,\" and that the selectmen notify the Governor \" at once \" that the money is subject to his order.\n\n1862\n\nOn the 21st of July, it was voted to pay a bounty of one hundred dollars to each volunteer who shall enlist in the military service for the term of three years, when mustered in and credited to the quota of the town, and one hundred dollars when he shall be honorably discharged, \" or to his lawful heirs,\" whether they belong \"to the town of Barnstable or not.\" It was also voted to pay ten dollars extra \"to each of the first twenty four persons who may volunteer from Barnstable.\" The selectmen were authorized to borrow whatever sums of money might be necessary for the payment of these bounties; also five thousand dollars for State aid to the families of volunteers, as provided by act of the Legislature, sec. 1, chapter 66, of the acts of 1862. August 16th, It was voted \"to pay each volunteer for three years' military service one hundred dollars, when mustered in and credited to the quota of Barnstable, and fifty dollars to him, or his legal representatives, at the expiration of the term for which he enlisted.\"\n\nThe following resolutions were read, and unanimously adopted:\n\nResolved, That the citizens of Barnstable fully appreciate the heroic patriotism and noble principle of those of her sons who have enlisted to make up the quota asked for by the President in his call for three hundred thousand volunteers, to put down the present wicked rebellion against the Government and Constitution of our country.\n\nResolved, That we assure those who thus go forth in our behalf that we shall watch with fidelity their every footstep, as true soldiers in the campaign before them; that we have the utmost confidence that their valor will do honor to the town they represent, and the memory of those patriot fathers of '76, who went forth from the homes of Barnstable to battle for the independence and nationality of this glorious government.\n\nResolved, That we pledge our honor as men and citizens to take honorable and tender care of the families of our volunteers whilst they battle for our rights, our liberties, our property, and our honor.\n\nResolved, That the citizens of this town pledge their ready and most active and vigorous assistance, according to the full measure of our ability, now and hereafter, to the President and Government of the United States, to put down and extinguish for ever this treasonable and most atrocious rebellion against the best government on the face of the earth.\n\nAugust 28th, The town voted to pay the same bounty, and on the same terms, to volunteers who would enlist for nine months' service and be credited to the quota of Barnstable, that was offered to volunteers for three years' service by vote of the town passed on the 16th. It also voted \"that all taxes that may be assessed upon the nine months volunteers for the year 1863 be remitted to them, and that their families be assisted by this town the same as the families of the three years volunteers are assisted.\" * September 6th, It was resolved, \" That we have the utmost confidence in the President of the United States, and that we will give him our cordial support in signing the Emancipation and Confiscation Act at as early a day as he may deem expedient.\"\n\n1864\n\nJune 30th, The town voted that all citizens who had enlisted, or might afterwards enlist, \" who had received a bounty of one hundred and fifty dollars, be paid that amount,\" and to the heirs of those who have died in the service. July 27th, Voted to pay \"each man in town who has, or who shall, put in a substitute in anticipation of a draft, the sum of one hundred and twenty five dollars.\"\n\n1865\n\nAt the annual town meeting held March 6th, it was voted to authorize the selectmen to pay to each volunteer citizen who has no family or dependent, and therefore not entitled to State aid, the sum of two dollars a week while in the service.\n\n1866\n\nMarch 5th, An appropriation of one thousand dollars was made for the erection of a soldiers\" monument, to which was added $260.80, being the balance of the soldiers' fund in the hands of the selectmen. Walter Chipman, Joseph R. Hall, F. G. Kelley, Henry Goodspeed, Nathaniel Hinckley, Charles C. Bearse, and Freeman H. Jenkins were appointed to locate the monument and arrange for its erection. The monument was erected in that part of Barnstable called Centreville, and was appropriately dedicated July 4, 1866.\n\nBarnstable, according to a return made in 1866 by the selectmen, furnished two hundred and seventy two men for the war, which is quite inaccurate; for the number of those in the military and naval service properly credited to the town must have been nearly five hundred, as it furnished its full quota upon every call of the President for men, and had a surplus of thirty five over and above all demands, at the end of the war. Three were commissioned officers in the military service. The whole amount of money appropriated and expended by the town on account of the war, exclusive of State aid, was thirty eight thousand five hundred and seventy four dollars and fifteen cents ($38,574.15).\n\nThe amount of money raised by the town, and expended each year of the war in the payment of State aid to the families of volunteers, and which was afterwards refunded by the Commonwealth, was as follows: In 1861, $93.60; in 1862, $2,525.57; in 1863, $6,182.23; in 1864, $6,851.53; in 1865, 4,100.00. Total in four years, $19,652.93.\n\nThe good work performed by the ladies of Barnstable was very considerable. There are three villages in the town, in each of which there were regular organized societies. We have only brief mention of what was done in two of them. In Barnstable proper, the Ladies' Sanitary Association was formed, immediately \" after the publication of the circular of the New England Women's Auxiliary Association was received,\" and continued until the close of the war. Mrs. S. B. Phinny was president, and Miss E. A. Chamberlain was secretary, most of the time. They made 3,153 articles, and $768 were raised in money. Hundreds of yards of bandages were made, boxes of lint, and a large quantity of preserves, &c. The ladies were untiring in their zeal. There was also \" a Children's Aid Society,\" a branch of the New England Women's Auxiliary Association. It began in 1862, and continued until the close of the war, of which Miss Cordelia E. Fhinny was president. 1,276 articles were made, and $106 were raised in money, by this society of little people.\n\nThe Centreville Ladies' Soldiers' Relief Society continued in operation \"one year ten months and eight days.\" Their receipts were $409.74. They sent two boxes of clothing to the \" New England Women's Auxiliary Association and one box to the Christian Commission.\" Of this society Mrs. Margaret Handy was president, and Miss Amanda Crosby secretary. We make the following extract:\n\nWhen the time arrived that our services were no longer needed, we had considerable money and clothing on hand, which were disposed of in gifts to our returned soldiers, and those who were suffering in consequence of the war, and to associations in aid of the war. From Jane 1, 1865, to Feb. 7, 1866, we distributed gifts in money to the amount of $248.86.\"\n\nBrewster\n\nIncorporated Feb. 19, 1803. Population in 1860, 1,489 ; in 1865, 1,459. Valuation in 1860, $636,333 ; in 1865, $801,452. The selectmen in 1861 were Tully Crosby, Zoeth Snow, Jr., Randolphus McLoud; in 1862, Jeremiah Mayo, William Winslow, C. S. Foster; in 1863, Jeremiah Mayo, C. S. Foster, William Winslow; in 1864, Solomon Freeman, Bailey Foster, Strabo Clark; in 1865, Solomon Freeman, Jeremiah Mayo, C. S. Foster. The town clerk and town treasurer during all of these years was Charles S. Foster.\n\n1861\n\nThe first town meeting, to consider matters in relation to the war, was held May 21st, at which it was voted to appropriate five hundred dollars to \" the Massachusetts Soldiers\" Aid Fund.\" A committee of three was appointed \" to see that the families of all volunteers were comfortably provided for;\" and the treasurer was authorized to borrow money when necessary for the above purposes.\n\n1862\n\nJuly 28th, A bounty of one hundred and fifty dollars was voted \" to each volunteer who shall enlist for three years, and be credited to the quota of the town, and fifty dollars additional to those who shall enlist within forty eight hours.\" A committee was elected to help the selectmen in recruiting volunteers. August 25th, Voted to pay a bounty of one hundred dollars to volunteers enlisting to the credit of the town in the nine months' service, and to pay eleven dollars a month to each of their families while in the service.\n\n1863\n\nDecember 1st, The treasurer was authorized to borrow eleven hundred dollars for recruiting purposes, \" if it shall be needed.\"\n\n1864\n\nAt the annual March meeting it was voted that all the business of recruiting \" be left with the selectmen, and that they be authorized to use any money they may find in the treasury for that purpose.\" March 21st, Voted to raise two thousand dollars for recruiting purposes, \"if legal.\" June 15th, Voted, to pay a bounty of one hundred and twenty five dollars to each volunteer who shall enlist for three years, and be credited to the quota of the town; and the treasurer was authorized to borrow the money \" when needed.\"\n\n1865\n\nAt the annual March meeting, \" Voted, to raise three thousand dollars (if needed) for recruiting purposes.\" Brewster furnished one hundred and forty one men for the war, which was a surplus of seventeen over and above all demands. None of them were commissioned officers in the military service. There were probably some in the navy. The whole amount of money appropriated and expended by the town for war purposes, exclusive of State aid to soldiers' families, was nineteen thousand four hundred and fifty three dollars and seventy three cents ($19,453.73). A considerable amount was voluntarily contributed by private citizens.\n\nThe amount raised and expended by the town for aid to soldiers' families, and afterwards reimbursed to it by the State, was as follows: In 1861, 00; in 1862, $291.96; in 1863, $1,024.00; in 1864, $1,819.20; in 1865, $1,221.07. Total, $4,356.23.\n\nThe ladies of Brewster in 1862 organized a Soldiers' Aid Society, which continued in operation until the close of the war, and did much good.\n\nChatham\n\nIncorporated June 11, 1712. Population in 1860, 2,710; in 1865, 2,637. Valuation in 1860, $886,157; in 1865, $1,000,543.\n\nThe selectmen in 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, and 1865, were Josiah Hardy, Benjamin F. Freeman, Levi Eldridge, Jr.\n\nThe town clerk and town treasurer during the same years was Josiah Mayo.\n\n1861\n\nSeveral citizens' meetings were held in Chatham during this year, at which action both by word and deed was taken to place the town in its true position as regards the war; but no formal town meeting was called, as none was necessary.\n\n1862\n\nOn the 22d of July a legal town meeting was held, at which it was voted to pay a bounty of two hundred dollars to each volunteer who would enlist for three years' military service, when mustered in and credited to the quota of the town; also to pay, to assist the family of each volunteer residing in the town, an amount not to exceed eighteen dollars a month. August 25th, Another meeting was held, at which it was voted to pay a bounty of one hundred and fifty dollars to each volunteer for nine months' service, when credited to the quota of the town, and to pay his family the same amount of assistance as paid to the families of three years volunteers.\n\n1863\n\nOn the 3d of February a town meeting was held, to consider the action of the selectmen, and the responsibilities they had incurred in behalf of the town. Up to this date they had borrowed eight thousand dollars on their individual notes, which they had expended in the payment of bounties and other necessary expenditures. The town voted unanimously to assume their entire liability, by giving the notes of the town, to run for five years. The same meeting refused to pay a bounty to two men who were residents of another town, all though they had been credited to the military quota of Chatham. On the 8th of December, Christopher Taylor, 2nd, Edmund Flynn, and David H. Crowell were chosen by ballot to aid the selectmen in recruiting volunteers to fill the quota of the town; also voted, \"that there be a general meeting of the citizens of the town held every Tuesday evening until the 5th of January next, to commence on Tuesday evening next at six o'clock,\" to encourage recruiting, and to consider measures by which to fill the quota of the town.\n\n1864\n\nOn the 3rd of February the town voted to pay four dollars a month to each person dependent on a volunteer for support, provided the amount to any one family shall not exceed eighteen dollars a month.\"\n\n1865\n\nOn the 1st of January a large meeting of citizens was held, at which, after discussion, it was voted to raise by voluntary subscription a sufficient sum from which to pay to each volunteer who will enlist in the service of the United States, and be credited to the quota of the town, a bounty of one hundred and twenty five dollars; and a paper having been prepared, thirty two hundred and five dollars were subscribed by those present at the meeting, which fully sufficed to fill the quota; and at a legal town meeting, held on the 6th of April succeeding, the persons advancing the money were reimbursed by the town.\n\nWe may as well state here as anywhere that the town in 1866, after the war was over, voted to refund to every citizen the money he had subscribed and paid to furnish volunteers; and also to pay to persons who had furnished substitutes, who were credited to the town, the money they had paid to procure them.\n\nChatham furnished two hundred and sixty four men for the war, which was a surplus of thirty two over and above all demands. Five were commissioned officers. The whole amount of money appropriated and expended by the town on account of the war, exclusive of State aid, was twenty seven thousand six hundred and eleven dollars and sixty nine cents ($27,611.69).\n\nThe amount raised and expended by the town during the four years of the war for aid to the families of volunteers, and which was afterwards reimbursed by the Commonwealth, was as follows: In 1861, 00; in 1862, $809.59; in 1863, $1,706.80; in 1864, $2,535.00; in 1865, $1,436.03. Total amount, $6,487.42.\n\nDennis\n\nIncorporated June 19, 1793. Population in 1860,3,662; in 1865, 3,512. Valuation in 1860, $1,108,-054; in 1865, $1,181,399.\n\nThe selectmen in 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, and 1865, were Joshua C. Howes, Alvan Small, Elijah Baxter.\n\nThe town clerk during the same years was Isaiah Nickerson. The town treasurer in 1861, 1862, 1863, and 1864 was Isaiah Nickerson; in 1865, Jonathan Bangs.\n\n1861\n\nThere does not appear to have been any action taken by the town in its corporate capacity in relation to the war during this year, although meetings of citizens were held, and every thing was done which the occasion required. Of these citizens' meetings no record appears to have been preserved, or, if there were, we have failed to obtain a copy of it, which we much regret.\n\n1862\n\nA special town meeting was held July 26th, to act upon war matters; at which a committee of six gentlemen were appointed to act with the selectmen in recruiting volunteers to fill the quota required of the town, under the call of the President for three hundred thousand men for three years' military service. The town authorized them to pay a bounty to each recruit of two hundred and fifty dollars, when mustered in and properly credited to the quota of the town; or they could be paid the bounty before being mustered, upon \" giving satisfactory security to the selectmen that the money would be refunded if the volunteer did not pass an examination and was rejected.\" The treasurer was authorized to borrow money sufficient to meet the expenditure. On the 19th of August another formal meeting was held; and the town voted to pay the same amount of bounty to volunteers for nine months' service, three quarters of the amount to be paid to the recruit when accepted, mustered in, and credited, and the remaining quarter when he was honorably discharged from the service. The treasurer was authorized to borrow five thousand dollars to pay the same.\n\nThese appear to have been the most important votes which were passed in relation to the payment of bounties. Other votes for the payment of State aid to the families of the volunteers were passed each year until the end of the war. Although the information received from Dennis is not so full and complete as we have received from many of the other towns, yet the result shows that few towns were more active in the good cause, or came out of the war with a better record.\n\nDennis reported in 1866 to have furnished two hundred and twenty men for the war, which is considerably below the actual number. Including the men in the navy, Dennis must have furnished about three hundred and seventy men, as at the end of the war the town had filled its quota in every call of the President, and had a surplus of forty three men over and above all demands. None of the men in the military service were commissioned officers. The whole amount of money appropriated and expended by the town on account of the war, exclusive of State aid, was twenty two thousand six hundred and fifty two dollars and sixty six cents ($22,652.66).\n\nThe amount of money raised and expended by the town during the four years of the war for aid to the families of volunteers, and which was afterwards refunded by the Commonwealth, was as follows : In 1861, $32.00; in 1862, $582.63 ; in 1863, $952.66; in 1864, $1,334.15; in 1865, $912.17. Total amount, $3,813.61.\n\nEastham\n\nIncorporated June 2,1646. Population in I860, 779; in 1865, 757. Valuation in 1860, $226,795; in 1865, $219,948.\n\nThe selectmen during the years 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, and 1865, were Zara Higgins, Prince S. Harding, Jonathan Snow.\n\nThe town clerk during all the years of the war was Herman Doane. The town treasurer in 1861, 1862, 1863, and 1864, was Herman Doane; in 1865, Josiah M. Cole.\n\n1861\n\nThere does not appear to have been any action taken by the town, in its corporate capacity, in relation to the war during this year.\n\n1862\n\nOn the 28th of July a special town meeting was held, to take measures to fill the quota of the town under the recent call of the President for three hundred thousand three-years men ; at which it was voted to authorize the payment of a bounty of two hundred and fifty dollars to each volunteer who would enlist and be credited to the town. The selectmen were authorized to borrow one thousand dollars to pay the same.\n\nAn enlistment paper was opened at the meeting, and four young men of Eastham immediately enrolled their names as volunteers. These filled the quota of the town. The names of the young men were\n\nFrancis Penmore, Henry Morrison, Peter Higgins, Nathan A. Gill.\n\nThe meeting then passed the following resolutions :\n\nResolved, That we cherish an unfaltering attachment to the Union and the Constitution formed by our patriotic fathers, and deeply deplore the cause which has produced such an unhappy alienation between the people of the North and South, which has ripened into a gigantic rebellion and unprecedented civil war.\n\nResolved, That we highly approve the judicious and patriotic course of the President of the United States in this trying hour, amid the jargon of party warfare that is carried on in the high places of the nation against the wise provisions and requirements of that time hon­ored Constitution ; and while he continues to stand firmly on that rock of our country's salvation, we will stand by and maintain him with all the men in our power, in his efforts to restore our divided and distracted country to its honor and peace.\n\nAt a meeting held on the 28th of August, the town voted to pay a bounty of one hundred and sixty dollars to each volunteer for nine months' service, when mustered in and credited to the town. Nine young men immediately enlisted and filled the quota of the town. December 5th, Voted, to pay a bounty of one hundred and eighty dollars to each of seven men enlisted in Boston and credited to Eastham.\n\n1863\n\nA special town meeting was held on the 2nd of December, when it was voted \" that the selectmen use their best endeavors to fill the quota of ten men for this town as soon as possible, within the town or elsewhere. The treasurer was authorized to borrow money to pay the expenses.\n\n1864\n\nMay 3rd, The selectmen were directed to \"pay to volunteers under any future call a bounty of one hundred and twenty five dollars.\" This amount was continued to be paid until the end of the war.\n\nEastham furnished seventy seven men for the war, which was a surplus of eleven over and above all demands. None were commissioned officers. The total amount of money appropriated and expended by the town on account of the war, exclusive of State aid, was three thousand four hundred and seventy six dollars and fifty four cents ($3,476.54).\n\nThe amount of money raised and expended by the town during the four years of the war for aid to soldiers' families, and afterwards repaid by the Commonwealth, was as follows:\n\nIn 1861, 00;\n\nin 1862, $111.63;\n\nin 1863, $223.20;\n\nin 1864, $198.40;\n\nin 1865, $300.00.\n\nTotal amount, $833.23.\n\nFalmouth\n\nIncorporated June 4, 1686.

Nearly one hundred must have been obtained from other places. At the end of the war, Falmouth had a surplus of ten men over and above all demands made upon it. Two were commissioned officers. The whole amount of money appropriated and expended by the town on account of the war, exclusive of State aid, was twenty thousand one hundred and fifty four dollars and thirty five cents ($20,154.35). In addition to this amount, eighteen hundred and fifty four dollars were raised by private subscription to encourage enlistment's, and six hundred and forty seven dollars for the sick and wounded in hospitals.\n\nThe amount of money raised and expended by the town during the four years of the war, for aid to the families of volunteers, and which was afterwards refunded by the Commonwealth, was as follows :\n\nIn 1861, $21.60 ;\n\nin 1862, $751.50;\n\nin 1863, $1,371.46;\n\nin 1864, $1,450.00;\n\nin 1865, $979.34.\n\nTotal amount, $4,674.20.\n\nThe ladies of Falmouth did their full proportion to assist the soldiers in the field and in the hospital. Taking \" in the estimate of barrels and boxes forwarded by them, in which were clothes and sanitary stores, it is difficult to come to a definite conclusion; but from all that I can learn from those ladies who had the particular charge of these matters, I think it may be safely set down at twelve hundred dollars.\" Mr. Lewis, to whom we are indebted for much of the information in regard to Falmouth, writes:\n\n\"Although we have no set speeches to record, there was always manifest at our meetings a determined will to do all in our power to bring the Rebellion to an end; and could you have been present at the gatherings of the fair sex, as they so often met to ply their fingers in preparing articles for the comfort and relief of the sick and dying, you would have beard such words of patriotism as flow from no other hearts. There is one case of sacrifice to which I cannot forbear to allude. During the Rebellion, three sons of a very poor citizen of our town enlisted. One was married, and had a family of five little children. The aged and poor parents were dependent upon the other two for their support. All three sons were killed in battle!\n\nHarwich\n\nIncorporated Sept. 14, 1694. Population in 1860, 3,423; in 1865, 3,540.
