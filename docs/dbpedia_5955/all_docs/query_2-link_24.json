The Middlesex Canal ran through it in the early 19th century when the railroad supplanted it and built two stations in the downtown area which are still in use today and located within the proposed cultural district. The train has been a major planning conduit since the 1800s and inspired the layout, design, and development of the neighborhood within walking distance to the two stations. The train along with the river defined the town center, open green space, and fields which are all located within the proposed district. Winchester, formerly part of Woburn until breaking off and incorporating in 1850, through the centuries has maintained its downtown village look and feel, and it draws residents to historical, cultural, and dining facilities where old and new residents mix and mingle. Along with a planned renovation to the train station, newly created Central Business District zoning is now in place in place to attract development that will bring residential and retail to the downtown while maintaining the village context."
