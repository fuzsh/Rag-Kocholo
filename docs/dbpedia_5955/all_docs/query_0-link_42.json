She joins Sunday Journal this week to discuss the ongoing project, the timeline for the different phases, as well as how changes to Title 5 septic regulations could impact the town’s wastewater plans.\n\nView September 22, 2022 Podcast on the CWMP with Rob Steen, Assistant Director of Public Works and Griffin Beaudoin, Town Engineer HERE\n\nJuly 21, 2022: U.S. District Court Judge Dismisses Conservation Law Foundation’s Clean Water Act Lawsuit Against the Town of Barnstable On July 20, 2022, U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs dismissed the lawsuit filed on February 16, 2021 by the Conservation Law Foundation (“CLF”) against the Town of Barnstable alleging violations of the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”). Commenting on the ruling, Barnstable Town Manager Mark S. Ells said, “We are pleased with the Judge’s decision to dismiss this unfounded suit against the Town. The Town is committed to preserving the environmental health of the waters of Cape Cod, and we are appreciative that the Judge recognized the Town’s efforts to protect those waters through the implementation of the Town’s Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan to reduce nitrogen in the waters of the Town of Barnstable, including the Lewis Bay Watershed.” CLF had alleged that the Town was violating the CWA because nitrogen from effluent released from the Town’s Wastewater Treatment Facility (the “Facility”) eventually reached the waters of the Lewis Bay Watershed. In granting the Town’s motion to dismiss, Judge Burroughs noted that the Facility’s groundwater discharges are properly subject to regulation by the state and further noted that the Town’s Facility is fully permitted under the state regulatory framework for groundwater discharges. Judge Burroughs agreed with the Town that nitrogen in effluent that travels through groundwater for more than 21 years over a distance of more than 1.5 miles before it reaches navigable waters cannot be considered the “functional equivalent of a direct discharge” into those waters. She therefore concluded that such discharges do not fall within Clean Water Act jurisdiction. July 13, 2022: Rep Peake has filed amendment #243 to H5007, the Economic Development Bill, that adds to the bill the transformative provisions of the Governor’s allocation of $200 million to Cape Cod to support municipal wastewater projects and to provide much needed support to Cape homeowners with the cost of sewer connections and septic upgrades. This is the most important and transformational proposal we have seen since the creation of the Cape and Islands Trust and we need to let the Ways and Means Committee know how important this is to Cape Cod. Please call the office of House Ways and Means Chair, Aaron Michlewitz tonight or first thing tomorrow morning at 617 722-2990 and voice your support for Rep. Peake’s amendment (see below) Amendment #243 to H5007 Cape and Islands Water Protection Ms. Peake of Provincetown move to amend the bill in section 2A, in item 1599-6079, by inserting at the end the following: “provided further, that $200,000,000 shall be expended for costs associated with planning and implementing water pollution abatement projects undertaken by towns who are members of the Cape Cod and Islands Water Protection Fund and which are subject to the 2015 Section 208 Cape Cod Areawide Water Quality Management Plan Update approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or a suitable equivalent plan as determined by the department of environmental protection; provided, that, in order to be eligible for funding in this item, projects must be deemed by the department to be consistent with the 2015 Section 208 Cape Cod Areawide Water Quality Management Plan Update or a suitable equivalent; provided further, that such projects must be included in a watershed permit issued by the department, or must be necessary to restore and protect water quality in impaired watersheds that are subject to a United States Environmental Protection Agency Total Maximum Daily Load allocation or alternative Total Daily Maximum Load prepared in accordance with United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, or an alternative load allocation identified in a Massachusetts Estuaries Technical Report or approved by the department based on a watershed specific scientific study; provided further, that funding shall be expended to support the Barnstable County Community Septic Management Loan program to provide 50% principal forgiveness to qualified borrowers whose income does not exceed 120% of area median income as defined by the latest census and 25% for qualified borrowers whose income does not exceed 180% of area median income as defined by the latest census”, and in said item by striking out the figures “$100,000,000” and inserting in place thereof the figures “$300,000,000”?

Construction of the first Phase 1 project, the Strawberry Hill Road Sewer Expansion Project, began in September. Construction on the next Phase 1 project, the Route 28 East Sewer Expansion Project, is scheduled to start in April 2022. The Route 28 East project will allow approximately 90 properties to connect to the municipal sewer system and will install critical infrastructure needed to proceed with other Phase 1 sewer expansion projects. This project will expand sewer westerly along Route 28 to the intersection of Route 28 and Phinney’s Lane. The project will install approximately 8,600 linear feet (LF) of new sewers within Route 28, Phinney’s Lane, and West Main Street. The project will construct a new sewer pump station at the Town-owned property located at 1456 Falmouth Road (Route 28), and will install approximately 11,600 LF of sewer force mains from the pump station to the Water Pollution Control Facility. The project will also install 4,300 LF of water main within Route 28, Earle’s Court and Captain Ellis Lane to improve water quality and water pressure. When: The public will have an opportunity to learn about the Route 28 East project at an upcoming virtual meeting scheduled for Tuesday, November 16th beginning at 7 pm.

View 10/21/21 Update HERE October 1, 2021\n\nTOWN OF BARNSTABLE FILES MOTION TO DISMISS CONSERVATION LAW FOUNDATION LAWSUIT\n\nThe Town of Barnstable today asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the Conservation Law Foundation (“CLF”) that threatens to undermine the Town’s efforts to implement a 30-year Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan (“CWMP”) that will preserve and restore water quality in and around Barnstable. The lawsuit also seeks the imposition of millions of dollars of civil penalties on the Town and includes a demand by CLF that the Town pay CLF’s attorneys’ fees. CLF seeks an order requiring the Town to reduce the level of nitrogen released from the Treatment Plant into groundwater. According to CLF’s complaint, if the Town fails to do so, then it must cease all discharges from the Treatment Plant.\n\nThe lawsuit incorrectly claims that the Barnstable Water Pollution Control Facility (“Treatment Plant”) in Hyannis violates the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”). CLF’s claim that discharges from the Treatment Plant, which take between two and three decades to reach the ocean, are subject to the CWA is not supported by the most recent U.S. Supreme Court cases or by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) policy, as these discharges cannot be viewed as the “functional equivalent” of a direct discharge into the ocean under the standards articulated by the Supreme Court. The Treatment Plant has received all required permits under state law.\n\nCLF’s lawsuit has enormous implications for Cape Cod and its residents. If CLF pursues its lawsuit and wins, then the CWA will apply, not just to the Town of Barnstable, but to most of the septic systems on the Cape. As a result, homeowners, businesses, and other Cape communities would have to cease operations of their septic systems or face the costly and time-consuming burden of obtaining CWA permits, which are currently unavailable from the EPA.\n\nCLF has filed this lawsuit despite the fact that the Town has started to implement its CWMP, which is an extensive, long-term capital program to ensure the quality of Barnstable’s estuaries like Lewis Bay for future generations. The CWMP calls for upgrades to the Treatment Plant, an expansion of the Town’s sewer system, and other measures to protect and improve the Town’s natural resources, all at an estimated cost of $1.4 billion over 30 years. In addition, the CWMP was developed by experts and reviewed and approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nTown Manager Mark Ells commented: “The Town is fully committed to protecting and improving the environmental health of the waters surrounding Cape Cod. To do so, the Town has begun investing over a billion dollars to implement its thirty-year plan to upgrade its wastewater infrastructure in order to protect Barnstable’s natural resources. While we would prefer that CLF work with the Town as a partner toward achieving these important goals instead of diverting the Town’s resources from these efforts, we will vigorously defend against CLF’s misguided attempt to impose inapplicable federal requirements on our Town and its residents.”\n\nSeptember 17, 2021 BRIEFING FOR GROUNDBREAKING FOR STRAWBERRY HILL ROAD SEWER EXPANSION PROJECT 1200 PHINNEY’S LANE, HYANNIS Clean Water Resources are Vital to Quality of Life and Economic Health in Barnstable Like all communities on Cape Cod, Barnstable is focused on ensuring the future health of coastal and freshwater resources. Currently, five of Barnstable’s seven coastal embayments are designated as “impaired waters” in violation of federal Clean Water Act standards due to excessive nitrogen. Numerous freshwater ponds have experienced algal anoxic conditions and outbreaks of cyanobacteria. The primary source of nitrogen pollution is wastewater from septic systems. Septic systems allowed under current Title 5 regulations do little to remove the excess nitrogen that poses a risk to coastal waters. Other nutrients and pollutants from septic systems threaten the health of freshwater ponds. Building wastewater infrastructure to reduce the amount of nutrients and pollutants entering the Town’s waters is necessary to protect the environment, property values, local economy, and quality of life in Barnstable. Barnstable is a Leader in Effectively and Efficiently Addressing Nitrogen Pollution Building on more than a decade of scientific study and engineering design, the Town has put forward a Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan (CWMP) to protect coastal, inland and drinking water resources. Barnstable’s plan has been approved by state environmental agencies and deemed consistent with the Cape Cod 208 Plan. The CWMP has been discussed at more than 100 community meetings and benefited from extensive public input. The CWMP identifies measures that will remove 100% of the nitrogen needed to meet federal standards and safeguard the health of our coastal waters, ponds and drinking water for generations to come. The CWMP also provides additional benefits to the community in the form of increased opportunities for affordable housing, economic development and redevelopment, consistent with the Town’s Local Comprehensive Plan. The CWMP calls for the expansion of sewer service to 11,800 properties across Town (see attached Overview graphic). Sewer expansion will occur in three phases over thirty years. Phase 1 sewers will be constructed in this decade and will accomplish 40% of the nitrogen removal needed to meet regulatory thresholds. Investments will also be made to enhance the efficiency and capacity of the Hyannis Wastewater Treatment Plant. The CWMP also calls for use of innovative and nature-based wastewater treatment approaches, including denitrifying septic systems, inlet dredging to improve flushing, green stormwater management projects, and shellfish aquaculture. The Strawberry Hill Road Sewer Expansion Project is the First Significant Phase 1 Project The new gravity sewer will provide sewer service to approximately 300 properties in the village of Centerville (see figure next page). Construction will begin in September 2021 and extend through the Spring of 2023. The Strawberry Hill Road Project cost of $11.7 million is being funded by the issuance of a municipal bond. The Cape Cod and Islands Water Protection Fund Board has authorized a 25% subsidy on the project resulting in a net bond issue amount of $8.8 million. It is also anticipated that the principal and interest on the net bond issue may be subsidized by the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust. Any unsubsidized bond principal, along with interest on the bond, will be repaid with sewer assessment revenue generated from the newly adopted Sewer Assessment Ordinance, and other funding sources dedicated for the sewer expansion program, which are generated from local meals and rooms taxes. The project is being coordinated with the Vineyard Wind 1 Project. Coordination of the two projects will reduce construction-related disruption to local roads and neighborhoods, and save taxpayer dollars.\n\nPictured from left to right: Construction Inspector Stephen Porter; Water Pollution Control Supervisor Andrew Boule; Senior Project Manager Paul Ruszala; Town Engineer Griffin Beaudoin; Town Councilor Paul Neary; C.C.

The Town’s Contractor for the project, C.C. Construction, will mobilize after Labor Day, with groundbreaking scheduled September 20th. Prior to the start of construction, utility mark outs will occur within the right of way. The edges of the Town owned right of way will also be staked and flagged to delineate the limit of work for the project. Test pit excavations to confirm locations of existing utilities are scheduled along the project route from September 7th thru 10th. In addition, preliminary tree pruning will occur along Craigville Beach Road and Strawberry Hill Road. The tree pruning is necessary to allow for excavation equipment to safely perform the work. The tree pruning work will be coordinated with the Town of Barnstable’s Tree Warden, who is a certified arborist. The project is the first significant construction project for the Town’s Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan (CWMP). The new gravity sewer will be installed in portions of Craigville Beach Road, Strawberry Hill Road, Wequaquet Lane and Phinney’s Lane as shown on the locus map included with this update. Additionally, a new submersible pump station will be installed on a Town easement at the intersection of Strawberry Hill Road and Craigville Beach Road. Please note that within the project area outlined above, and during the same construction timeline, Vineyard Wind will be installing a duct bank and associated utility relocations as part of their offshore wind energy project. Upon the completion of both projects, Vineyard Wind will resurface disturbed roadways within the project area. Normal work hours will be between 7:00AM and 3:30PM, Monday thru Friday. Traffic impacts are anticipated throughout the project, with road closures and detours being necessary. Police details will be on site to direct traffic as needed. Motorists are advised to seek alternate routes to avoid the construction work. Weekly progress and traffic updates will provided via eNews and the project update list. As always, please slow down and use extreme caution when traveling through the road construction areas, and follow posted safety and detour signs. If you have any questions or wish to receive project updates, please contact Paul Ruszala, P.E., Senior Project Manager, at the Department of Public Works at 508-790-6400 or paul.ruszala@town.barnstable.ma.us.

The primary source of the problem is nitrogen pollution from septic systems. Likewise, the Town’s freshwater ponds and drinking water supply are being degraded from nutrients and pollutants from septic systems, fertilizer, stormwater run-off and other watershed sources. Building wastewater infrastructure to reduce the amount of these pollutants entering water resources is necessary to protect the environment, property values, local economy, and quality of life. Fortunately, Barnstable is leading the way on clean water solutions. Building on more than a decade of scientific study and engineering design, the Town has put forward a Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan (CWMP) to protect coastal, inland and drinking water resources. Barnstable’s plan has been rigorously reviewed and approved by state environmental agencies. The Town’s plan calls for sewers and other measures to be implemented over 30 years, at a total cost of $1.4 billion. The Town has identified existing revenues to cover more than half of this cost. A Sewer Assessment Ordinance is being proposed to finance a portion of the remaining cost. What: A proposal for a Sewer Assessment Ordinance to finance a portion of the cost to construct the sewer expansion will be presented for community discussion at a series of virtual public forums. Who: Mark Ells, Barnstable Town Manager, will present the proposed sewer assessment ordinance; along with Daniel Santos, Director, Department of Public Works; and Mark Milne, Finance Director. When and How to Participate: Thursday, February 25 – 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 7:00 PM Thursday, March 25 – 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 7:00 PM To participate via computer use the following link for all six meetings: https://zoom.us/j/92047771927 Meeting ID: 920 4777 1927 or join by phone 888-475-4499 All meetings will also be live-streamed on Channel 18 and the Town of Barnstable Facebook page.

View 2/18/21 Update HERE Update: 2/17/21: Town of Barnstable Statement in Response to Conservation Law Foundation Lawsuit Barnstable Town Manager Mark Ells issued the following statement in response to a lawsuit filed against the Town by the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) on Tuesday, February 16, 2021: The Town of Barnstable is taking decisive and effective action to improve water quality in our coastal waters, streams and ponds. The Town’s Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan, recently approved by the Massachusetts Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, will fully achieve the nitrogen reductions needed to meet Federal clean water standards. The Town has already invested $30 million toward the first phase of sewer construction needed to address this problem, and additional construction is planned to begin later this year, including upgrades to the Hyannis wastewater treatment plant. By the end of the decade, sewer expansions will be in place to remove nearly half of the nitrogen needed to protect our waters, with the remainder completed in subsequent phases. Contrary to the CLF’s allegations, the Town adheres to applicable environmental requirements. It operates the Hyannis wastewater treatment plant in full compliance with a Groundwater Discharge Permit issued to the Town by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. If CLF is seeking to change the manner in which the plant is permitted, they need to take up that issue with state and federal permitting agencies. Moreover, CLF’s actions could hinder the Town’s current efforts to address the problem of nitrogen pollution in our waters by diverting financial and staff resources away from that work. Nitrogen pollution of the Cape’s waters is a large-scale and costly problem. Barnstable is committed to ensuring that we do all that we can to protect and restore the health of our coastal waters, which are the lifeblood of our economy and quality of life. We encourage CLF and others concerned about this issue to support these efforts and work together with us. Update: 2/12/21: Citizen Forums will Discuss Proposed Sewer Assessment Ordinance Background: The health of Barnstable’s coastal waters that is so vital to the Town’s quality of life and local economy is at risk. The primary source of the problem is nitrogen pollution from septic systems. Likewise, the Town’s freshwater ponds and drinking water supply are being degraded from nutrients and pollutants from septic systems, fertilizer, stormwater run-off and other watershed sources. Building wastewater infrastructure to reduce the amount of these pollutants entering water resources is necessary to protect the environment, property values, local economy, and quality of life. Fortunately, Barnstable is leading the way on clean water solutions. Building on more than a decade of scientific study and engineering design, the Town has put forward a Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan (CWMP) to protect coastal, inland and drinking water resources. Barnstable’s plan has been rigorously reviewed and approved by state environmental agencies. The Town’s plan calls for sewers and other measures to be implemented over 30 years, at a total cost of $1.4 billion. The Town has identified existing revenues to cover more than half of this cost. A Sewer Assessment Ordinance is being proposed to finance a portion of the remaining cost. What: A proposal for a Sewer Assessment Ordinance to finance a portion of the cost to construct the sewer expansion will be presented for community discussion at a series of virtual public forums. Who: Mark Ells, Barnstable Town Manager, will present the proposed sewer assessment ordinance; along with Daniel Santos, Director, Department of Public Works; and Mark Milne, Finance Director.

Update: 2/8/21: Comprehensive Financial Advisory Committee Submits Final Report on the CWMP Financial Management Plan View HERE Update: 1/28/21: Town of Barnstable Reaches Significant Milestone with Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan The Town of Barnstable reached another significant milestone in efforts to clean up its inland and coastal waters by successfully completing state environmental review of the Town’s Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan (CWMP). The Certificate of completion issued late last month by the Massachusetts Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs Kathleen Theoharides states that the Town’s CWMP “adequately and properly complies with Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act’s (MEPA) and its implementing regulations.”In sharing the news with the Barnstable Town Council, Daniel Santos, Department of Public Works Director, said, “The Certificate from Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs is no small matter. The fact that the regulatory agencies, and there are many that participate in this review, were very satisfied with our project is a major accomplishment and will do us well in the implementation phase.”Barnstable Town Manager Mark Ells spoke to the work called for in the CWMP that has been done and will take place in Barnstable in the future, “The Town of Barnstable has made substantial strides toward improving water quality in its inland and coastal waters. The Town already has invested more than $30 million to reduce nutrient levels in its estuaries, and this plan dramatically speeds up the timeline on major projects, including extending sewer service to nearly 12,000 properties, while managing costs for taxpayers and limiting construction disruptions for residents, businesses and visitors.” The next and final step in the approval of the CWMP is for the Town to petition the Cape Cod Commission for a Consistency Determination with the208 Area Wide Water Quality Management Plan, the regional framework to restore embayment water quality on Cape Cod mandated under the federal Clean Water Act. The 208 Consistency Determination ensures that the CWMP is consistent with a watershed-based approach to reduce or eliminate excess nitrogen reaching coastal waters.

Santos, P.E. Director of Public Works Daniel.Santos@town.barnstable.ma.us\n\nThe Town of Barnstable Department of Public Works released the Draft Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan (CWMP). The Draft CWMP will guide wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal efforts in Barnstable for the next 30 years, with the primary goals of reducing nutrient enrichment of coastal estuaries and fresh water ponds as well as the protection of public water supplies. Secondary goals include supporting economic growth and providing solutions in areas where it has traditionally been difficult to site on-site systems such as areas with high groundwater and poor soils. The Draft CWMP relies on both traditional methods of addressing wastewater, in the form of centralized collection and treatment, but also invests heavily in alternative technologies in the short term to potentially minimize the need for centralized sewering in later phases of the plan.\n\nThe Town has been working since 2015 to develop a plan that meets the needs of the community as well as the requirements of the Cape Commission’s “208 Plan” that was released in 2017. The “208 Plan” outlines the region’s plan to meet the requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act.
