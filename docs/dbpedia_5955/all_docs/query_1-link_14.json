        "text": "2024 Hours\n\nApril 4 – June 30\n\nTh-Sat — 11 am - 4 pm\n\nSun — 12 pm - 4 pm\n\nJuly 3 – October 13\n\nWed-Sat — 11 am - 4 pm\n\nSun — 12 pm - 4 pm\n\nOctober 18 – December 29\n\nFri & Sat — 11 am - 4 pm\n\nSun — 12 pm - 4 pm\n\nBy Car\n\nThe Edward Gorey House is located in Yarmouth Port, a somewhat over-ripe village on Cape Cod. The Cape is located approximately 75 miles from two major airports: Logan Airport in Boston and Green Airport in Providence. The main routes onto Cape Cod are Route 3 from Boston and points North across the Sagamore Bridge, and Route 25 from points South and West via the Bourne Bridge. Both bridges involve a death-defying traverse of the Cape Cod Canal. The Edward Gorey House is located in the Mid-Cape area, approximately 25 miles from the Cape Cod Canal.\n\nOff of Route 6, (the Mid-Cape Highway) you’ll take Exit 72 (formerly Exit 7—don’t ask) to make a right onto Willow Street and then another right when it ends at Route 6A (Olde Kings Highway). A few miles East on 6A, through Yarmouth Port Village, and you will see the Common on your right. The Museum faces the Common at 8 Strawberry Lane. The House has a small lot for parking; if it is full, you may park on the side of the Green. Get even more convoluted driving directions from Google Maps.\n\nBy Air\n\nThe Museum does not have a runway but many wealthy people fly into Hyannis, which is a few miles West of us.\n\nBy Train\n\nCape Cod is serviced by a seasonal train from South Station, Boston. For off-season travel, a train requires assistance from a bus. From the Amtrak terminal at Boston's South Station, take a Plymouth & Brockton (P&B) bus to Hyannis or other stops.\n\nBy Bus\n\nRegularly scheduled buses run from Northeastern cities to the Hyannis Transportation Center. Peter Pan Bonanza or Plymouth & Brockton (P&B) Bus will get you here."
