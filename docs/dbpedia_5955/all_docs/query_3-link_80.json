        "text": "How does oppression force people to either stay or move?\n\nHistorians often examine the issues that lead people to migrate in terms of \"push-pull\" factors. Were difficult times at home \"pushing\" people away or was the promise of better lives \"pulling\" them somewhere else? Usually the answer lies in a combination of both influences.\n\nOppression at home can be a powerful incentive to leave. Forced conscription into the military, restrictions on religious freedom, famines, laws prohibiting land ownership, high taxes, grinding poverty — these are factors that have often persuaded people to seek better lives elsewhere. Victims of violence or those fleeing conflict are often designated as refugees as opposed to immigrants coming for economic advantage. In recent times, wars in southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central America have dislocated millions and made refugee resettlement a major issue of our day.\n\nEnslavement in America\n\nImmigrants who come as enslaved people are a unique class. Africans forced into enslavement did not choose to migrate; their captors made that decision for them. They came as prisoners. In enslavement, one human being and his/her children become the legal property of another. Enslaved people labor for their owners. They have no or very few legal rights and are subject entirely to the will of those that enslave them. According to one source, slave ships brought 500,000 enslaved Africans to the United States. Those coming to America, however, represent less than 5 percent of the approximately 11.3 million Africans brought to the Western Hemisphere through the Atlantic slave trade. The majority went to island plantations in the Caribbean.\n\nBy 1861, sectional tensions in the United States finally culminated in the brutal Civil War. Enslavement was a primary cause of the conflict. Most northern states, including Iowa, prohibited enslavement. Four border states — Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware — permitted the practice but refused to leave the Union. Slave states to the South seceded and formed the Confederate States of America. Enslavement did not find strong support in the U.S. territories in the West.\n\nMost African Americans did not wait for the government to grant them their freedom. Wherever Union armies marched across the South, enslaved people left their homes and flocked to the Union camps. When U.S. enslavement of African Americans officially ended with the adoption of the 13th Amendment, some freed African Americans began moving north.\n\nGreat Migration and Iowa\n\nIn Iowa, small numbers of African Americans found jobs along the Mississippi River. They were sometimes recruited to replace white workers in meat-packing plants or coal mines, leading to hostile relations with local workers. While Iowa passed laws forbidding segregation in schools and public accommodations, they were often ignored or weakly enforced. Some towns, especially across southern Iowa, passed \"sunset laws\" that required all African Americans to leave town at the end of the day.\n\nWhen World War I created shortages of labor in northern factories, many African Americans saw a chance to escape the heavily-segregated South. From 1900 to 1920, some one million African Americans moved North, most to large manufacturing cities where they competed with working class whites for jobs and housing. Tensions led to race riots in several cities and even the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the Midwest. Even where segregation in housing was officially illegal, African Americans were nevertheless excluded from white neighborhoods. Some African-American areas grew into centers of distinct, vibrant black culture that gave rise to the flowering of arts, music and literature like the Harlem Renaissance in New York City.\n\nBy the 1970s, the demographics of African Americans had shifted remarkably. In 1900, 90 percent of African Americans lived in the South with 75 percent in rural areas. By 1970, only 50 percent of African Americans were southern, and only 25 percent lived in rural areas.\n\nNo other ethnic group in America has suffered discrimination more harshly than African Americans. With legal, economic and social restrictions, African Americans have struggled to achieve full equality in American society.\n\nSupporting Questions\n\nWhat is enslavement?\n\nNewspaper Ad for the Sale of Enslaved People at Ashley Ferry, ca. 1780 (Document)\n\n\"The Resurrection of Henry 'Box' Brown at Philadelphia\" Illustration, 1850 (Image)\n\n\"Inspection and Sale of a Negro,\" 1854 (Image)\n\nAfricans Imprisoned on the Slave Ship \"Wildfire,\" 1860 (Image)\n\nSlave Auction Location along Whitehall Street in Atlanta, Georgia, 1864 (Image)\n\nAfrican-American Family at the Hermitage in Savannah, Georgia, ca. 1907 (Image)\n\n\"The Hermitage\" Slave Quarters in Savannah, Georgia, ca. 1907 (Image)\n\nInterview of Formerly Enslaved Person Fountain Hughes, June 11, 1949 (Audio)\n\nIowa Public Television's \"The Underground Railroad,\" 1977 (Video)\n\nIowa Public Television's \"Iowa Underground Railroad Route,\" 1977 (Video)\n\nHow was our country divided during the Civil War?\n\nPreamble to the U.S. Constitution, September 1787 (Document)\n\nNorthern and Southern States East of the Rocky Mountains, 1861 (Map)\n\nIowan John Sivil Jr.'s Volunteer Enlistment Form during the Civil War, October 9, 1862 (Document)\n\nFinal Draft of the Emancipation Proclamation, January 1, 1863 (Document)\n\nAfrican-American Union Soldier, His Wife and Two Daughters, between 1863 to 1865 (Image)\n\n13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, January 31, 1865 (Document)\n\n\"The First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation Before the Cabinet,\" 1866 (Image)\n\n\"The First Vote,\" November 16, 1867 (Image)\n\nHow did oppression cause or motivate African Americans to migrate after the Civil War?\n\n\"The Segregation Question\" Letter to the Editor, February 22, 1915 (Document)\n\nYoung African American Picking Cotton, October 1935 (Image)\n\nFamily of Evicted Sharecroppers Resettled in Mississippi, July 1936 (Image)\n\nSharecropper's Wife and Cabin near Jackson, Mississippi, June 1937 (Image)\n\nAfrican-American Man Entering Movie House Through \"Colored\" Entrance, October 1939 (Image)\n\nSegregated Bus Station in Durham, North Carolina, May 1940 (Image)\n\nSegregated Cafe Near the Tobacco Market in Durham, North Carolina, May 1940 (Image)\n\nRosa Parks Meeting Poster, between 1956 and 1959 (Document)\n\nDemonstrators during the March on Washington, D.C., August 28, 1963 (Image)\n\nIowa Public Television's \"Alexander Clark and the First Successful School Desegregation Case in the United States,\" 2012 (Video)\n\n\"Great Migration | The African Americans,\" November 12, 2013 (Video)\n\nDr. George Washington Carver, Date Unknown (Document, Image)\n\nInterview with George Jiggetts about Moving North and Finding Work, August 19, 1994 (Audio)\n\nEnslavement to the Great Migration Teaching Guide Printable Image and Document Guide\n\nDr. George Washington Carver, Date Unknown\n\nImage\n\nDownload Resource Download Resource\n\nDescription\n\nDr. George Washington Carver was born into slavery at the end of the Civil War, and he became one of the best-known and widely respected African Americans in the world.
