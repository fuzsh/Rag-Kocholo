        "text": "Barnstable County officials are battling over who gets to decide on the distribution of $41.3 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds from the federal treasury.\n\nThe three county commissioners, including Sheila Lyons of Wellfleet, initially argued that the money is a grant, and that under state law they are solely responsible for allocating grant funds.\n\nBut the 15-member Assembly of Delegates, with one member elected from each Cape Cod town, disagreed. They said the money should be distributed under the ordinance process prescribed in the county charter, with the Assembly having the final say.\n\nEfforts at reaching a compromise have seen options and counter-options bouncing back and forth like ping-pong balls between the two panels.\n\nIn the latest development, the Assembly unanimously voted on Dec. 15 to override a veto by the commissioners of the Assembly’s ordinance spelling out how the ARPA funds would be managed. Before that vote, the Assembly’s lawyer, Robert Troy of Sandwich, told the members that they represent the 15 towns in the county and speak for them.\n\n“We need to look at whether the voice of the communities should be heard,” Troy said.\n\nMary Chaffee of Brewster, deputy speaker of the Assembly, said overriding a veto by the county commissioners was rare, “but I strongly support overriding this veto.”\n\nAt the same session, the Assembly unanimously voted to reject the commissioners’ proposal for managing the ARPA funds without allowing it to come to the floor for discussion.\n\n$20 Million Already Received\n\nThe ARPA money comes to the county in two equal installments. The first half, over $20 million, has already arrived. The second half will be paid out in 2022.\n\nFederal officials set broad categories for use of the funds, and County leaders have named water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure projects as top priorities. The wish list also includes public health, addressing the economic harms of the pandemic, and making up for lost public sector revenue, according to Assistant County Administrator Vaira Harik. Applicants for the money may include municipalities, nonprofit organizations, and several other entities.\n\nThe three county commissioners are elected to four-year terms in countywide votes. The current chair is Ron Bergstrom of Chatham, Lyons is vice chair, and the third member is Mark Forest of South Yarmouth. They prepare the county budget, appoint the county administrator and other employees, and oversee disbursement of funds. They can also propose ordinances for Assembly action and can veto ordinances adopted by the Assembly.\n\nThe Assembly is the county’s legislative branch; members are elected to two-year terms by their individual towns. Their votes are weighted based on the populations of their respective communities.\n\nThe Assembly can override the commissioners’ veto of an adopted ordinance via a two-thirds vote.\n\nThe commissioners initially planned to solicit applications for the ARPA money through an online portal starting early in 2022. Those would be reviewed for compliance by staff and then sent to an advisory council organized by County Administrator Beth Albert. The council’s recommendations would be reviewed by the commissioners, who would then write the checks for the ones they approved.\n\nThe Assembly of Delegates argued that the money should be allocated through ordinances proposed by the commissioners or members of the Assembly and followed by public hearings. Proposed ordinances must be adopted by the Assembly and approved by the commissioners. Following a 31-day waiting period, the ordinance goes into effect.\n\nThe commissioners at first proposed a joint process that would involve “resolutions” rather than ordinances, thereby avoiding the hearing process and the 31-day delay.\n\nBut the Assembly didn’t even discuss that proposal. Instead, it unanimously adopted an ordinance dictating that all spending of ARPA funds be done solely via ordinances.\n\nChaffee called it “a clean and simple method of appropriating ARPA funds. Both branches can carry out their responsibilities without a memorandum of understanding or meetings with lawyers or tabletop exercises to test a new process,” Chaffee told her colleagues. “It’s how we routinely conduct the county’s business.”\n\nThe Assembly would make sure to keep the process moving, she said. “We know these funds are needed in the towns we represent,” she said.\n\nThe commissioners vetoed the Assembly’s ordinance, objecting to a lack of specifics on the review process and the delay inherent in the ordinance process. Then they proposed their own ordinance, which was essentially the same as their earlier proposal, simply changing the word “resolutions” to “grant agreements.”\n\nThe veto was overridden, and the commissioners’ ordinance was rejected this week. Both votes were unanimous.\n\nCommissioners Lyons and Forest had said before this week’s action that they were willing to work with the Assembly to resolve the dispute. But Bergstrom was not in a conciliatory mood.\n\nBergstrom said comments made by Chaffee and by Assembly Speaker Patrick Princi of Barnstable “seemed to indicate I wasted a month of their time by presenting compromises, and that they were right, we were wrong.”\n\nOf the ordinance that had been adopted by the Assembly and sent to the commissioners, Bergstrom said, “It represents not one step in our direction; not one attempt to compromise.”\n\nEditor’s note: This article has been revised and updated since it was published in the print edition dated Dec. 16, 2021.\n\nPROVINCETOWN — It’s not easy sharing a ballot with the president. Presidential elections always hoover up the attention, even in a normal year, even when the contest is boring. This year is anything but boring — the Trump versus Biden race is expected to drive turnout to 100-year heights nationwide.\n\nAfter that vote for president, though, there are choices across the rest of the ballot. For voters in the Outer Cape towns, there are three contests in particular whose outcome is uncertain: the county commissioners’ race, and the two statewide ballot questions.\n\nVoters who feel they don’t know much about these races often skip them. To help get more information, the Independent talked to three of the candidates for county commissioner about themselves, their election, and the other contests on the ballot.\n\nCounty Commissioner\n\nThe first thing to know about the county commissioners’ race: you have two votes. There are two seats up for election on the three-person commission, and each voter has the right to pick two candidates for those two seats.\n\nThis kind of contest has a long history of confusing voters. Voting twice in one race doesn’t come easy, and, in 2016, at least a third of Barnstable County voters didn’t vote for two candidates.\n\n“There are four candidates running for two seats,” said Mark Forest of Yarmouth. “Sheila Lyons and I are the Democrats, and there are two strong supporters of Trump. One is the incumbent, Ron Beaty, and one is Abraham Kasparian, running as — apparently, you’re allowed to make up your own party in Massachusetts. He’s running as the Independent Unifying Thinking Party.”\n\n“This is an opportunity, if you’re a Democrat,” said Lyons, who lives in Wellfleet. “There are two very good candidates. Mark and I are going to work together, and we are asking people to vote two and vote blue.”\n\nBeaty, the Republican who was elected to the county commission in 2016, did not respond to an interview request from the Independent. He lives in Barnstable.\n\n“I wanted to unify us as one people,” said Kasparian, who lives in Yarmouth. “That was part of my goal in running for office. I’m independent, and I’m thinking hard on all these issues. That’s how I came up with the name.”\n\nForest, Lyons, and Kasparian would bring very different experiences to the commission.\n\nLyons served two terms as a county commissioner, from 2008 to 2016, and currently works at Outer Cape Health Services as an access specialist, signing people up for health insurance.\n\nForest was the Cape and Islands district director for U.S. Rep. Gerry Studds, and served in the same role for his successor, Bill Delahunt. “I was the congressmen’s liaison to all the Cape and Islands communities,” said Forest. “From groundwater issues, to the National Seashore, the dune shacks, the fishing industry, shellfishing, wetlands restoration — I’ve worked on all of those.” Forest went on to be Delahunt’s chief of staff in Washington.\n\nKasparian was a real estate broker, and served on the Hampden County Commission in the late 1990s. He went to prison for 13 years in 2002 for attempting to murder his estranged wife in a pizza parlor.\n\n“I learned a lot about myself, how I came to go to prison,” said Kasparian. “And also how to change yourself and become a better person. I did try to help other people inside. Because of my experience with contracts, I helped a lot of inmates with their civil suits. You try to be a positive force.”\n\nBeaty, the incumbent, has also been to prison — in 1991, for sending death threats to then-President George H. W. Bush and Sen. Ted Kennedy. He was sentenced to 16 months.\n\nBeaty’s election in 2016 was partly due to the pick-two election system. Barnstable County tends to vote about 55 percent for Democrats and 40 percent for Republicans. That year, 72,000 people voted for Hillary Clinton — but only 58 percent of that number voted for the two Democrats on the ballot in the county commission race.\n\nMeanwhile, 54,000 in Barnstable County voted for Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nThe two top candidates win. In 2016, the top vote-getter was Democrat Mary Pat Flynn. But 23,000 people who voted for Democrats didn’t vote for two commissioner candidates. As a result, Beaty edged out Forest by 903 votes.\n\nThis is why Forest and Lyons appear to be campaigning for each other this year. “You want to use your two votes for the two Democrats, and not leave one behind,” Lyons said.\n\nWhat Does the County Do?\n\nThe Independent asked the candidates to explain what Barnstable County government does.\n\n“The county government can capture real estate taxes that would be going to the state’s general fund and keep that money here on the Cape,” said Lyons. “Then it can strategically look at issues that confront all the towns: wastewater, climate change, adapting and reinforcing the coastline, public health; a regional approach to housing.”\n\n“The county has a dredge program that saves the towns millions every year,” said Forest. “There’s a collective purchasing program, a public health staff, a police academy, a fire training academy. The county grows the actual oyster seed for shellfishers. It’s invested in broadband infrastructure. These are things the 15 towns couldn’t do on their own.”\n\n“My goal is to abolish county government if I become commissioner and return the $15 million in revenue it collects from real estate taxes to the 15 towns,” said Kasparian. “The Cape Cod Commission can do a lot of the important work. Also, I would like to see a unified beach sticker for all of the 15 towns, so if you live on the Cape, you can buy one sticker that’s good for every beach.”\n\nQuestions 1 and 2\n\nBallot Question 1 is a classic scrap between two large industries — more than $30 million has been spent on advertising by the two sides. The largest donors to the Yes campaign are auto repair chains like O’Reilly Auto Parts and AutoZone. The largest donors to the No campaign are the car companies themselves, including General Motors, Toyota, and Ford.\n\n“It’s really the car manufacturers trying to capture all the repair business into their dealerships,” said Lyons. “Saying, ‘This data is so specialized, you have to come to us.’\n\n“For people who want to support their local repair shops, you should vote yes,” Lyons said.\n\nQuestion 2 is an election reform initiative called ranked choice voting (RCV). It would allow voters to pick all the candidates they like, in order, without having to worry they’re “wasting” their vote on someone who can’t win. If their first choice is far behind, their vote will be reallocated to one of their other preferred candidates.\n\nIn primary elections in particular, when there can be many similar candidates competing, RCV means that two similar candidates won’t crowd each other into defeat. A progressive voter wouldn’t have to choose between Sanders and Warren — she could essentially vote for both, without having to worry about who was more viable. A conservative voter could do the same with multiple conservative candidates.\n\nIn general elections, RCV ensures that the candidate who can appeal to the most voters wins — even in a three- or four-candidate race.\n\n“It gives the voter more power and more choices,” said Lyons. Proponents argue that RCV enables more candidates to run without sabotaging their nearest kin. Green Party candidates can run without hurting Democrats, and Libertarians can run without hurting Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic and Libertarian parties of Massachusetts have endorsed Question 2, as have a long list of Democratic office holders. The Republican Party of Massachusetts is against it.\n\nIn the Sept. 1 primary election, three Democratic candidates for the Barnstable County Commission are vying for two places on the Nov. 3 ballot. They’re hoping to replace Mary Pat Flynn, a Democrat who is not running for re-election, and to unseat Republican incumbent Ron Beaty.\n\nThe third seat on the commission is held by Democrat Ron Bergstrom, whose term ends in 2022.\n\nThe county commission is the three-person executive branch of county government, with a budget of about $29 million a year to support Cape-wide efforts on coastal erosion, climate change, wastewater, homelessness, housing, health care, fire and police training, dredging, and insect control.\n\nBeaty, who on Twitter calls himself “The Donald Trump of Cape Cod,” served 16 months in federal prison for making death threats against President George H.W. Bush, U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, and state Sen. Lois Pines. His comments last year about gay politicians being “self-absorbed and self-centered” led to calls for his resignation.\n\nTwo of the three Democrats are from the Outer Cape — Cheryl Andrews, 60, of Provincetown, and Sheila Lyons, 63, of Wellfleet. The third Democrat, Mark Forest, 64, of South Yarmouth, is a former Provincetown town manager.\n\nSizing up Beaty, Lyons said, “All he is doing is spouting so he can get the attention he desires. It doesn’t lead to any progress.”\n\nLyons served as a county commissioner from 2008 to 2016, when she left to run for the state senate, a race she lost to Julian Cyr. Lyons did not plan to return to the commission, but the coronavirus became a factor, she said, because she believes experience is especially important now.\n\n“We don’t have the luxury of time to learn on the job,” she said.\n\nLyons’s first term as a commissioner was during a recession, when the county had few financial resources. Now, she said, county government is in a more secure place, but Cape Cod towns are suffering from Covid-related financial turmoil.\n\nThis, she said, is the perfect opportunity for the county to step up its role and help.\n\n“We need a county that handles the large physical issues that transcend the issues of each town,” she added.\n\nIn her first term, Lyons took up the issue of wastewater. “Nobody wanted to talk about wastewater back then,” she said. She recalled assembling a team, finding state funding for outreach, and now, years later seeing the groundwork result in a new system in Yarmouth.\n\n“That’s how government works,” she said. “It is slow, but it can get things done.”\n\nCheryl Andrews, like Lyons, sees increasing the role of county government as a priority.\n\n“You don’t see the county very active in communities, and I think that’s exactly what you are about to see change,” she said.\n\nAndrews is a veteran of Provincetown government, having been elected nine times to various positions, most recently serving on the select board. After serving five terms, she lost her re-election bid in 2019. She has also spent two terms on the Provincetown Housing Authority and was elected twice as Provincetown’s representative on the county Assembly of Delegates.\n\nThe Mass. Chapter of the Sierra Club, the nation’s largest environmental organization, recently endorsed Andrews’s county commission campaign.\n\n“We don’t have a great deal of money or regulatory authority at the county level,” she said. “But what you have is a lot of expertise in environmental work.”\n\nAndrews said she has been disappointed with the county commission’s attention to the Outer Cape and hopes to change that.\n\nAndrews has been practicing dentistry in Provincetown since 1986. Her health-care background, she says, gives her an advantage, as the first order of business the new county commissioner will be tackling is Covid-19.\n\nNow a Yarmouth selectman, Mark Forest ran unsuccessfully for county commissioner in 2016. This time he received the endorsement of departing Commissioner Flynn.\n\nForest began his career in government as Provincetown town manager from 1980 to 1985. He expects to lean on his experience working in Provincetown during the AIDS crisis in the ’80s as he focuses on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Provincetown is where I learned about the critical role that local communities and governments can play in people’s lives,” he wrote.\n\nBut local government can only handle so much, which is why the county needs to step up, he said.\n\n“When we look at the economic and public health challenges that we are facing right now, there is more that we can be doing; the county government is an underused resource,” Forest said.\n\nFor example, he continued, county funding played an instrumental part in rebuilding Provincetown’s MacMillan Pier in 1987. That, Forest said, could be a blueprint for the county commission’s role on Cape Cod.\n\n“We need that same mindset now,” he said.\n\nVoters in the Democratic primary can vote for two candidates on the September ballot; the two with the most votes will appear on the November ballot with Beaty.\n\nThe “pick two” vote has been historically confusing to voters, with many voting for only one. Although voting for just one candidate can be strategic.\n\nAndrews believes voter confusion was a reason Beaty won the seat in 2016.\n\n“He only won last time because there were over 15,000 blanks in a ‘choose no more than 2’ race,” she said.\n\nPROVINCETOWN — The Barnstable County Assembly of Delegates adopted a resolution on June 17 questioning the legality of Gov. Charlie Baker’s Covid-19 response. The Outer Cape’s delegates opposed the resolution, but were in the minority. The vote was 66 percent in favor, 15 percent opposed, 18 percent absent.\n\nThe debate on the largely meaningless resolution did have a certain significance: it exposed Cape Cod’s longstanding east-west progressive-conservative divide — at least within the assembly.\n\nProposed by Christopher Kanaga of Orleans and John Ohman of Dennis, the resolution states that “the Citizens of Barnstable County have been deprived of property and liberty” because of the governor’s Covid-19 declarations. It mentions especially “those in the restaurant, hotel, resort, retail, and service businesses,” and decries what it calls the governor’s exercise of “unfettered power.”\n\nIn response, Brewster Delegate Mary Chaffee said the governor had acted within the legal authority granted to him by the state legislature 70 years ago. “His actions have reduced the spread of disease, loss of life, and harmful impact on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,” Chaffee said.\n\nThe town by town breakdown on the resolution was seven votes in favor and five opposed. Two delegates were absent, and Falmouth’s seat was vacant at the time. The assembly’s votes are weighted by population, based on the 2010 census. Thus, the Truro delegate’s vote counts for less than one percent of the total, while the delegate from Barnstable, the county’s largest town, gets more than 20 percent of the total.\n\n“The way the vote went was almost cleanly divided by east and west — Upper Cape and Outer and Lower Cape,” said Dr. Brian O’Malley, Provincetown’s delegate. Eastham’s Terry Gallagher and Wellfleet’s Lilli Ann Green also voted against the resolution, while Truro’s Deborah McCutcheon was absent.\n\nThis is a typical dividing line for the assembly; voting along a conservative versus progressive divide is something O’Malley said he’s seen again and again.\n\nBut this time, the vote especially annoyed state Sen. Julian Cyr. Cyr, a Democrat from Truro who also serves as public information officer for the Cape Cod Reopening Task Force, said the assembly’s resolution was “profoundly disrespectful to county staff. County staff has been invaluable throughout the epidemic. Part of the success we’ve had on Cape Cod is due to the concerted efforts of county government.”\n\nCyr called the resolution “a bit of a political stunt,” and pointed out the assembly has no authority on the matter. “Right now,” Cyr said, “I think Cape Codders want us focused on keeping people safe and reopening in a way that prevents community spread.”\n\nBut at a July 8 meeting of the Barnstable County Commissioners, Speaker of the Assembly E. Suzanne McAuliffe of Yarmouth defended the vote as “a good government resolution.”\n\nThe commissioners have no authority over resolutions passed by the Assembly. The July 8 meeting served only as a forum for further discussion.\n\nMcAuliffe reported that County Administrator Jack Yunits had criticized the assembly’s resolution, calling it “repugnant and constitutionally inept and vague.”\n\nFor that reason, McAuliffe asked the commissioners to take action against Yunits. “The county administrator has an article in his contract that calls for an annual evaluation,” McAuliffe said. “And I would request respectfully on behalf of the assembly that there would be a discussion with the administrator about working with county government.”\n\n“Sometimes, in the heat of the moment,” Yunits replied, “you may answer a question in a way you probably shouldn’t have. But I don’t want to take it back because I do believe in my position on that.” He added, “When it comes to defending the actions and efforts of county employees, Suzanne and I are on the same page.”\n\nThe chair of the commissioners, Ronald Bergstrom of Chatham, said that a discussion of renewing Yunits’s contract would go on the board’s agenda.\n\n“But,” Bergstrom said, “what’s in front of us right now is to get through this crisis, both from the standpoint of health and the economy.”\n\nPROVINCETOWN — Cheryl Andrews, a veteran elected official in Provincetown, is the first challenger to declare her candidacy for the Barnstable County Commission race this fall. The commission is the three-person executive branch of county government and writes the county’s budget, among other powers. There are currently two Democrats and one Republican on the commission. Two of the three seats are up for election in November.\n\nVoters will be instructed to “pick two” candidates, which means there will be two Democrats on the November ballot, two Republicans, and possibly some independents. The top two vote-getters win the two seats.\n\nThis type of election can lead to voter confusion, with a significant number picking only one candidate. Voting for only one person can be a strategic choice, but the options are often misunderstood, and Andrews hopes to campaign very specifically on a “pick two” ticket with another Democrat.\n\nAndrews has never run countywide, but she has been elected nine times in Provincetown. She was elected twice to be Provincetown’s representative on the Barnstable County Assembly of Delegates, twice to the Provincetown Housing Authority, and five times to the select board. She also lost one election for select board, in 2019. That was also a “pick two” election, but in that case three people ran for two seats, without any party labels.\n\nIn the upcoming race for commissioner, there will be a primary election on Sept. 1, in which all the Democrats running will be winnowed down to two, and the same for the Republicans. Afterward, Andrews told the Independent, the two Democrats can spend the months of September and October campaigning together and asking voters to pick both on the November ballot.\n\nWhy the County Commission?\n\n“I learned while serving on the county assembly that the commissioners, the executive branch, are very powerful compared to the assembly,” said Andrews. “They have the power to write the budget, and even if the assembly votes it down, the commissioners can just vote to send it back. Then it takes two-thirds of the assembly to veto it. In the 30 years since the charter was written, the assembly has never been able to get two-thirds to veto. The effect of that arrangement is that the budget the commissioners write is pretty much the budget that we get.”\n\nThe Barnstable County budget is about $29 million a year. It supports a variety of regional programs that are considered too unwieldy for individual towns to attempt alone, such as fire and police training, dredging, water quality testing, and insect control.\n\nAndrews added that the county depends largely on real estate transfer taxes for its revenue, and that she would like to find ways to make that income stream more sustainable and resilient against ups and downs in the real estate market. She also wants to orient county programs to face more directly the challenge of climate change.\n\nAndrews cited the effort to build Provincetown’s sewer system as an example of her style of problem-solving. “That project was complex and lengthy,” she said, “but by focusing on the details and developing consensus, we were able to make a fair proposal that was accepted, that worked, and that has been used as a model by other towns on the Cape.”\n\nThe First Challenger\n\nThe two seats that are up for election in November are currently held by Ron Beaty of Barnstable, a Republican, and Mary Pat Flynn of Falmouth, a Democrat. Beaty has already declared that he is running for re-election; Flynn has not declared her intentions.\n\nThe third seat is not up for election until 2022; it is held by Ron Bergstrom of Chatham, also a Democrat. He unseated Leo Cakounes of Harwich, a Republican, in the 2018 election, ending two years of Republican control of the commission.\n\nFor a candidate to appear on the primary ballot requires 500 signatures, which must be turned in for certification by April 28. There is no official beginning date for the campaign season, according to the Mass. Secretary of State’s office, but candidates who wish to raise and spend money legally must open an expenditure committee. Besides the incumbents, only Andrews has opened an expenditure committee for the commissioner’s race with the state’s Office of Campaign and Political Finance, so for the time being, she is the only official challenger. Each party will ultimately want to field at least two candidates for the election, so more people will likely be joining Andrews in the race soon."
