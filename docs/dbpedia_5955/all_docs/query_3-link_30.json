        "text": "Conor Hall is the kind of guy you’d want in your corner. Filled with curiosity and openness to new experiences, he has a passion for life and community. His optimism about what the core principles of politics can and should be, give us a renewed faith in human rights and what the possibilities of working together can bring. His experience as a cancer survivor has given him a zest for life that is obvious to everyone around him, and we were so happy to learn more about his story.\n\nAnnie Bloj: Where did the calling for working in politics come from- had you always been interested in that field of study and work?\n\nConor Hall: The short answer is yes. I have always been fascinated by geography, history, and politics. When I was pretty young, 8 or 9, I would stay up after I was supposed to be asleep compiling charts of counties ranked by GDP, population growth, happiness index, political structure, etc. All based on the data I was pulling out of the various books and encyclopedias I asked for as gifts. Through the example of my parents who were long-time social justice advocates, my three siblings and I were taught that through empathy, open-mindedness, and hard work you can make the world a better place. I know how cliche that sounds but I’ve found it true in my experience.\n\nI cut my teeth in politics working with my twin brother on the '08 Obama campaign as a door-to-door fundraiser in Texas. We had guns shoved in our faces, dogs unleashed on us, and got a sobering look at the bigotry that plagues this country. We also felt the inspiration of a political movement and grew close with the diverse and rag-tag teams that we led. We set fundraising records and we all cried tears of joy together the night of Nov 4th when Obama was elected to the Presidency. I always loved politics but after that, I was hooked.\n\nAB: How did you begin working with Sentor John Hickenlooper (then Governor of Colorado), and what did you learn from that experience?\n\nCH: I first dipped my toes into the Hickenlooper world as a summer intern right out of college. After a few years doing policy research and living abroad, Hick’s Office of Community Partnerships hired me on as a program coordinator, shortly thereafter Hick asked me to be his Director of Advance or “body guy”. I was essentially the person who staffs and advises the Governor at every external event or meeting. Ultimately, it was too unique and intriguing of a role to turn down. Hick and I quickly developed a strong rapport and deep trust, and over the next 3.5 years of his second term, I never left his side. We had some great adventures together; re-working his DNC keynote hours before he went on stage, jamming backstage at Red Rocks, accidentally stealing a former President’s seat in Texas. However, the greatest component of the work was the many interesting people I met and the knowledge that I absorbed. Late at night or early in the morning, I would read a thick briefing book for every event or meeting the Governor had the following day and then be ready to advise him accordingly; sometimes having to summarize a 20-page brief in 10 seconds. I also learned from Hick how to forge tough compromises and think innovatively beyond traditional boundaries.\n\nA few other lessons crystallized for me during my time with Hick. One, the value of having good mentors. I was incredibly lucky to have several seasoned Colorado political figures invest their time and wisdom in my development, and I work hard to pass on that gift whenever I’m in a position to do so. Second, help people when you have the power to do so even if it does nothing for you. Folks approached Hick and I all the time with problems and if fixing that problem did not hurt our administration or anyone else, I would do whatever I could to help. Third, at the end of the day, politics is imperfect but it’s still one of the greatest avenues to drive change in our society. Perhaps it’s naive, but after years working in politics, I still believe that if you are genuine in your intention, committed to listening to others, and willing to collaborate then you can have a tremendously positive effect through politics.\n\nAB: Through your work with the Trust for Public Land, you have been involved in raising billions every year to protect our natural resources. How did a focus on equitable access to nature for all become a priority for you in your career?\n\nCH: This mission runs in my blood. My Dad, Thomas, is a pioneering conservation attorney -- having helped form land trusts and conservation-focused firms in Colorado and Texas. Growing up in Crestone, CO about as far up into the Sangre de Cristo mountains as you can go, we spent just about every waking hour outside in nature. This had a tremendous impact on the development of my identity and values. As lucky as I was, I believe everyone should have access to nature, even if it’s a pocket park in a dense urban environment. It should be a right, not a privilege. Unfortunately, over 100 million people in this country don’t have that access within a 10-minute walk. The Trust For Public Land is working tirelessly to change that. Our Conservation Finance team works with communities to determine their needs (more parks, open space conservation, climate resilience, etc.), then, predominantly through ballot measure campaigns, we create the public funding to meet those needs. Over 25 years of this work, we’ve raised over 85 billion dollars for communities across the country. However, we are always looking to continue scaling up because the need out there is tremendous.\n\nAB: Conor, how did the experience of surviving cancer at 21 shape your perspective on the world? Can you share more about your work with the non-profit First Descents?\n\nCH: Well, simply put, it was a blessing that I would never wish upon anyone else. I had a giant tumor between my heart and my lungs, and for quite a while -- even though I would tell anyone who asked otherwise, I wasn’t confident that I would make it. Facing my mortality at a young age and undergoing intensive treatment made me appreciate every breath I was given and helped steer me more quickly into a career of service. Through this experience, I also came to understand that great meaning can come from suffering (a philosophy beautifully articulated in Victor Frankel’s Man’s Search for Meaning). While I don’t have the space here to properly delve into the stories, my battle with cancer took on a meaning well-outside myself and pushed me to become more compassionate to myself and others.\n\nFirst Descents was one of the blessings that came into my life via cancer. I never thought I needed a support group but when my oncologist suggested I check out First Descents (a nonprofit that provides outdoor adventures for young adults impacted by cancer), I thought it would be cool to go surf on the Outer Banks for a week. I was caught off guard by the deep connections I formed and the healing that came from being around other young people who shared my experience, not to mention the re-empowerment I felt pushing my then-battered body to surf and succeeding. There is a powerful bond formed among survivors in a setting where the tough stories and emotions come up naturally in a space of solidarity and mutual understanding (which is often a rarity among young peers). Although I only spent one week with these former strangers, I consider many of them lifelong friends. Anytime one of us has a scan or a scare we are there for each other, whether we are next door or thousands of miles apart.\n\nNeedless to say, the First Descents community has given me so much so I try to give back by volunteering, throwing fundraisers, raising awareness, and mentoring other young adults who have been recently diagnosed. If you have not heard of First Descents I would strongly encourage you to check them out. They throw a helluva 80s ski party every Oct!\n\nAB: Conor, since this is the September fashion issue, can you speak to how your style has developed over time and how your involvement in the local fashion community has evolved?\n\nCH: Ha! Well, if you saw a picture of me wearing those ultra-baggy JNCO jeans in middle school, my greatest fashion faux-pas, you would know I’ve come a long way. I didn’t wear many suits or fancy outfits growing up (such is life when your first job is on a cattle ranch), but once I started working for Hickenlooper I had to learn about fashion pretty quickly. As it turned out, I enjoyed it! When I have to dress business casual I love a European-cut suit or jacket with an accenting pocket square. This style instills a lot of confidence in me, but I have to admit, I still spend plenty of time in a pair of worn-out shorts I got from the thrift store down the street and a t-shirt I’ve worn since college. Everyone has their version of a confidence-instilling outfit and comfort clothes, it’s all about doing you and owning it.\n\nIn terms of my involvement in the fashion community, my touchpoint is the one and only Esther Lee Leach. We’ve become close friends and she has opened my eyes to the vibrant fashion scene in Denver. Recently, we went to the Fashion West runway show and I came away impressed by the level of fashion sense and the broad array of people in attendance. Denver has so much to offer in terms of our Western culture, as we continue to ascend as a global city, our potential is enormous. The fashion industry will play an increasingly important role in pushing the creative boundaries and expanding perspectives. On a personal level, I’m looking forward to continuing to get to know the local fashion community and being a champion of all the good work being done in this city."
