        "text": "(Compiled by Don Bayley)\n\nIn this John Warner Barber drawing from 1839, Town Hall, built in 1834, is prominently displayed. From Sandwich historian Russell Lovell: “This is the only view found showing the early Calvinistic chapel on the site of the present First Church of Christ (the ‘Elvis’ Church). The smaller buildings in the left foreground are a blacksmith shop, the building that was moved to become (part of) the glass museum and lastly the shop that became the Fred Bunker museum (now gone). At left rear is the Unitarian Church with the Titus Winchester clock and in the distance the two stacks of the Glass Factory casting their prosperous pall of black smoke.”\n\nAt its 1834 Town Meeting, pursuant to a constitutional amendment in 1833 requiring formal separation of church and state, the town voted to erect a new Town Hall. The First Parish Meetinghouse (and earlier meetinghouses) at the corner of Main and River Streets had served as the religious and political center of Sandwich almost since the founding of the village in 1639.\n\nThe new Town Hall building was to be at the northern end of Lower Shawme Lake at the intersection of Main and Grove Streets on bog land donated by the Newcomb family at 8 Grove Street. Construction was preceded by extensive filling of the marshy land with gravel.\n\nThe large structure, built by Ellis Howland, included an upper hall capable of seating 500 people. After the construction of Town Hall, the area around the grist mill and the northern end of Lower Shawme Lake, which had been called Town Square, became known as Town Hall Square. In 1914, a fouteeen-foot addition was made at the south end, to contain, among other things, a stage and dressing rooms, indicating the upper hall’s use for theatrical productions and, later, movies.\n\n(Click photo for larger view.)\n\nCredit: John and Rosanna Cullity, A Sandwich Album\n\nThe above is from a stereoscope card taken by Minnie Cook. Note that here Town Hall is painted in two colors. In the 1900s it was all white. Town offices and the meeting hall were upstairs. Over the years, there were various occupants in portions of the ground floor such as stores, carpenter shops, a newspaper printing office, the library and early Historical Society offices. In the foreground granite is being worked into posts. A hand pump can be seen on the site of the present-day artesian well fountain.\n\nRead a bit more about Minnie Cook (Mary Cooke)\n\nNote in the Minnie Cook photo there is no flag flying on top of the Town Hall. The 1889 Town Meeting (held on Saturday, March 15 at 9 AM) voted to appropriate “$25 for purchase of a flag to be flown over Town Hall.” And, sure enough, we can see the new flag (faintly) on the roof in this 1889 photo:\n\nAccording to historian Russell Lovell the word “SANDWICH” was added above “TOWN HALL” in 1912. Thus this postcard photo must have been taken prior to 1912 as there is no “SANDWICH.” But it most likely was taken after May 30, 1911 as that was when the Civil War Soldiers’ Monument was dedicated. Note also the horse and buggy on the left. And there is a flagpole on the roof but no flag is flying. In this view, two doors in the western wall can be seen. The 1889 and 1895(?) photos show larger doors. The rear extension for a stage upstairs was added in 1914. Originally the upper level was reached by stairways in the front corners of the building accessed from the front porch outside.\n\nIn 2009 the entire building was restored to its former glory. The second floor ballroom is particularly beautiful with its historically accurate stenciling of tan and brown paint and gold leaf, theatrical stage, balcony seating and fully restored historic shuttered windows. Movies and theatrical productions are again presented in the Sandwich Town Hall.\n\nThe Sandwich Town Hall was granted a Preservation Award for Rehabilitation & Restoration by the Massachusetts Historical Commission in 2011.\n\nRehabilitation & Restoration\n\n(text from the Massachusetts Historical Commission website)\n\nConstructed in 1834, the Sandwich Town Hall was one of the first town halls built in the Commonwealth, following an amendment to Article III of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, which ensured the separation of church and state. Prior to the amendment, most town gatherings took place in meetinghouses built for both religious and civic purposes. The Greek Revival-style building has served as the seat of local government for over 176 years, and is a contributing element of the Town Hall Square National Register Historic District.\n\nThe project to rehabilitate and restore the town hall began in 2009, after several years of research and planning, and was completed in October of 2010. The first-floor corridor and office ceiling beams were preserved and remain exposed, as they have been since 1834. During the preservation of the entrance doors, it was discovered that they are the town hall’s original doors and are signed by Solomon Howland, son of the building’s master builder, Ellis Howland. The project also restored the original exterior paint colors, the 1870s stenciled ceiling of the Meeting Hall, and the 1914 Meeting Hall stage and building extension, the walls and ceiling of which had been extensively damaged over the years by water infiltration. New supporting piers and foundations replaced inadequate wood and brick piers in the cellar, where water intrusion was channeled and suppressed to mitigate a long-term, building-threatening condition. Sensitive changes for accessibility and functional use included elevating the entrance portico and installing an energy-efficient elevator, as well as installing additional restroom facilities and multi-zoned heating and air conditioning.

It rests on a cut granite and fieldstone foundation, is sheathed in wood clapboards, has corner pilasters and a wide frieze. The monumental recessed center entrance has wide channeled pilasters and two fluted Doric columns. The five-bay side elevations have tall windows with 12/12 sash on the first floor and 16/16 sash on the second. In the rear is a short full-width addition with a flat roof.\n\n(SOURCE: National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, Town Hall Square HD (2010), Sandwich (Barnstable), MA)\n\nSandwich Town Hall\n\n1834\n\nSignificance & History\n\nPrepared by Jonathan A. Shaw,\n\nSandwich Historical Commission\n\nThe Sandwich Town Hall, built 1834 and located in a setting that is both appealing and unspoiled, is one of the finest and earliest Town Halls in the Commonwealth. The two massive cypress columns fronting the Town Hall, each 3 feet in\n\ndiameter and 25 feet high, are characteristic of the Greek Revival style, as are the proportions and symmetry of the entire building. This style came into use in America following the Revolution as the visible expression of the ideals of civic participation first established in Athens over 2,000 years ago. On the 200th anniversary of American Independence in 1976 the Town Hall and the Colonial and post-Colonial buildings leading to it were designated by the federal government as the Town Hall Square National Register Historic District.\n\nSeparation of Church & State\n\nThe Town Hall was one of the first Town Halls, if not the first Town Hall, constructed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts following the public approval on 11 November 1833 by the voters of the State of a referendum to ratify the separation of church and state. This was done by amending Article III of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Prior to passage of the amendment the Sandwich Town Meeting met in the Congregational & Town meeting house established by the Town in about 1640 at River and Main Streets. The Sandwich Town Hall is not only an architectural symbol of the roots of democracy but also the actual historical embodiment of the separation of governmental power and religious expression.\n\nTown House Authorized\n\nThe construction was authorized by a vote of the Sandwich Town Meeting of 17 March 1834 with the building to be two stories high and “sufficiently large to seat 500 people.” The Committee chosen worked rapidly to prepare plans for what was to be called the Town House with the second floor to be called the Town Hall. The site chosen was the meeting point of Grove, Tupper, and Main Streets and adjacent to the location of the 1638-55 water mill for grinding corn. That this choice was deliberate can be recognized by the fact that over 500 tip loads of gravel would eventually be required to stabilize the soil beside the millstream. The building was to be paid for over four years, and the entranceways to the Town Hall portion of the building were two enclosed winding stairways located under the overhang to the left and right of the first floor entrance. The first floor was to be rented to businesses at the discretion of the Selectmen.\n\nMaster Builder\n\nSandwich’s master carpenter & builder Ellis Howland constructed the Sandwich Town Hall. When the front doors were being restored in 2009 it was discovered for the first time that Ellis’s son had made the front doors, signing in chalk in letters six inches high and six feet long: “Solomon C. Howland 1834.”\n\n$4,138.32\n\nBy the end of 1834 the building was largely complete, and on 28 February 1835 it was authorized “to notify and warn the inhabitants of the Town of Sandwich qualified to vote in elections and in town affairs to meet [on 16 March 1835] at the Town Hall.” The final cost of construction was $4,138.32 and the large sum required years of payments.\n\nFirst Floor Leases\n\nFollowing this first meeting, the building itself is mentioned occasionally during its first 20 years in the Town Meeting records, primarily with regard to leasing the first floor. Over the years lease-holders included, among others, a dry goods store, a cooperative grocery store, a newspaper publisher, a lamp maker, and a carpentry shop. Over the years the Town Hall became a venue and incubator of civic activity, a place for celebration, and a marker of social and technological change.\n\nLast Wolf\n\nIn July of 1847, the last wolf in Sandwich was killed by George Brailey, a teamster and wood carter for the furnaces of the Boston and Sandwich Glass Factory, then becoming one of the largest glass factories in America. The wolf was brought to the Town Hall and the body hung between the columns for exhibition. Bells were rung, and there was much rejoicing among Sandwich farmers for their loss of sheep had been great.\n\nSteam Train\n\nOn May 26, 1848 the first steam train rolled into Sandwich; all was excitement. People gathered on the hill tops to see its arrival, some no doubt on Academy Hill overlooking the Town Hall, and Sandwich citizens remarked that the train would travel so fast that one would have to look quick in order to see it.\n\nUnruly Boys\n\nBy 1853 the roof required shingling and the chimneys were to be taken down and rebuilt. The Town Hall had become an active community center for in that same year it was voted at a Town Meeting held in the Meeting Hall that during the many public meetings, lectures, and public amusements a constable should be present to “keep unruly boys in order.”\n\nSandwich Patriots\n\nAs the Civil War approached, the Fourth of July parade of 1860 became an expression of Sandwich patriotism, and the day ended with fireworks and a Military Ball at the Town Hall. The following year it was at the Town Hall that volunteers enlisted for the Union Army, and almost 60 years later those who began their journey into combat in World War I began it at the Town Hall. Commemorative plaques in the Meeting Hall for World War I and World War II record the name of every Sandwich resident who served his country in these two World Wars.\n\nNew Invention\n\nIn 1876 Sandwich celebrated the national Centennial with a concert and public singing in the Town Hall. In 1878 a public demonstration of the newly invented telephone took place with wires strung between the Town Hall and the nearby Church. Residents were startled to perceive music played in the church could be clearly heard in the Town Hall.\n\nExpansion!\n\nIn 1880 along the inside wall of the second floor Meeting Hall a balcony was built to increase seating capacity. A few years later, the newly created Sandwich Public Library occupied a room on the first floor from 1892 to 1910, and this was followed by the Sandwich Historical Society that housed its collections in the same space until 1926, both leaving when they had sufficient support to establish their own buildings. By 1914 an addition fourteen feet deep to the rear of building made possible a Meeting Hall stage and opportunities for new community entertainments.\n\nSilent Movies\n\nIn 1915 or a little later silent movies began to be shown in the Meeting Hall and a piano, an upright in the Mission style made by Jacob Doll & Sons for the Frederick Piano Company, was acquired. It was played by local residents, Minne Bunker Wimmer, Eva May Harlow, and Mary Haines Morrow, to accompany the silent movies. The projectionist turned the film by a hand-crank illuminated by a carbon-arc. A primitive generator located in a garage across the street from the Town Hall provided the electricity. Nonetheless using a carbon-arc projector was dangerous business and likely to set a building on fire. To protect the Town Hall from fire, the projectionist was provided with a urinal and required to remain continuously on duty when the carbon-arc was running. It is said that occasionally the engine of the generator would fail, the screen would dim, and boos and hisses would arise from the audience who had paid a nickel to attend.\n\nTown Meetings\n\nIn 1939 President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration provided stimulus funds for Town Hall repairs, a great benefit for hard-pressed citizens. With the construction of the Wing School on Water Street in the 1930s and the consolidation of the Town’s numerous district schools, Town meetings began to be held there. Town Hall continued as the administrative seat of government for Sandwich’s Selectmen and later the Town Staff and Town Administrator.\n\nToday\n\nThe Sandwich Town Hall reflects over 175 years of Sandwich’s history, government and culture as well as the larger issues of State and National life that have had an impact on the Sandwich community. The Town Hall has been in active use as the seat of Town government for every one of those 175 years. There are few towns that can make this claim.\n\nIn 2010 the Oldest Town on Cape Cod “Celebrated History & Celebrated Sandwich” with the completion of the historic preservation and restoration of the Sandwich Town Hall, the Town’s most significant structure architecturally\n\nand historically, and a vital presence in the living history of the Town of Sandwich.\n\nPRESERVATION AND RESTORATION 2009 – 2010\n\nThe preservation and restoration of the 1834 Sandwich Town Hall was begun in July 2009 following several years of study & planning, initially by a committee of citizens and later by a task force of town staff & citizens, and with the aid of Community Preservation funds of 3.1 million authorized by three successive Town Meetings.\n\nHistoric preservation & restoration, under the direction of a leading Massachusetts historic preservation architect, was focused on retaining the historic character-defining features of the Town Hall and specificallyon restoring:\n\n• linear first floor corridor and rear doorway\n\n• original Meeting Hall and 1870’s stenciled ceiling\n\n• 1914 extension and stage\n\n• historic exterior and original paint colors\n\nMajor adaptive changes to ensure functional use were: raising the main granite entrance-way & installation of an elevator–for the handicapped and physically challenged; reconfiguration of first floor Town administration\n\noffice spaces; installation of new/additional toilets on both floors; installation throughout of multi-zoned heating & air conditioning, and complying with all ADA and Building Code safety requirements.\n\nMajor corrective changes included: new supporting piers throughout the cellar; covering, channeling, and suppressing cellar water intrusion; and a pair of enclosed steel “summer” beams to support the second floor Meeting Hall.\n\nOctober 2, 2010 Rededication – 1834 Sandwich Town Hall\n\nSkunks and racoons on the kitchen table?\n\nThe house at 238 Route 6A, The Old King’s Highway, is falling down. It’s open to the weather and the rain just pours in. In a year or so, it may be gone. Sad, because so much took place here–so much that is now part of Sandwich’s rich history.\n\nThis house was built around 1770 by Peleg Nye II, a direct descendant of Benjamin Nye, one of the founders of Sandwich. Later it was occupied by the Cooke family who were double Mayflower descendants, being in straight lines of both Cooke and Conant.\n\nIn the early 1900s it was occupied by skunks, racoons and Alice, Abby and Mary Cooke. (It was also an insane asylum called Locust Grove, but more on that later).\n\nHistorian R. A. Lovell wrote that Alice, Abby and Mary “all lived in a consciously archaic fashion; they were abstemious, prohibitionist and vegetarian.” Mary (who preferred to be called Minnie) became an expert photographer; her stereopticon views of Sandwich scenes were popular in town. Her photo of Town Hall can be seen HERE.\n\nAll three ladies had a profound respect for the sacredness of life. They found it impossible to kill even rats and mice. Over time, an unusual collection of skunks, raccoons and woodchucks came to the old woodshed connected to the rear of the house and even came into the kitchen and up onto the table. Abby, Minnie and especially Alice enjoyed feeding and entertaining them.\n\nIt so happened that Alice had known the naturalist and author Thornton Waldo Burgess (1874-1965) when he was a boy in Sandwich. He worked nearby for William C. Chipman shipping water lilies from local ponds (see below). Alice was aware that the woods and pond behind her house were the genesis for Thornton’s nature stories that began to appear after 1912. She was a trustee for the new Sandwich Public Library for many years and made sure the library had a Thornton Burgess collection.\n\nAlice called Thornton “Nephew Waldo,” told him she loved to care for all the animals that wandered into her home and would like to invite him to visit. Thornton was so taken with what he saw that he spent many days there taking photos and movies of the animals. In his autobiography he wrote, “One memorable night twenty-two coons were crowded together in the little woodhouse as they squabbled over the food pans.” Later Burgess wrote about it all in a book he called “Aunt Sally’s Friends in Fur.” (Thornton came up with the name “Aunt Sally” to protect Miss Cooke’s privacy and to keep hunters and trappers away from her house which was beside what was then the main highway down the Cape.)\n\nBurgess went on to introduce the story of the “animal nightclub,” the woodshed and Aunt Sally in his newspaper column and to thousands via the Radio Nature League carried over numerous radio stations including WBZ in Boston and WBZA in Springfield where Burgess lived at the time.\n\nThe Sandwich Historical Society has related photographs, an oil painting and the original manuscript of the Aunt Sally book.\n\nBesides caring for animals in her home, Alice also cared for the disabled. She entered into a formal agreement with the Massachusetts Board of Lunacy and Charity to care for three “deranged” women at her home. A state inspector later mistakenly tried to remove the women, but Alice was ably defended by town selectmen and in 1895 was formally licensed to open a mental hospital at 238 Rte 6A and keep and treat insane female patients there. She named it the Locust Grove Asylum.\n\nThe 1900 Census lists Abigail, her 2 daughters: Alice and Mary; 2 boarders and 2 servants. Alice’s occupation is listed as: “Supervisor Insane Asylum.”\n\nThe 1910 Census lists Abigail, her 2 daughters: Alice and Mary and 6 “inmates” (the word “boarders” is crossed out and “inmate” written in).\n\nIncidentally, in this census, among the neighbors listed are artist William Dodge MacKnight and Jam Kitchen founder Ida Putnam:\n\nIn 1920, the Census reported Alice, Mary, Abigail (who was now 98) and 2 boarders. Alice was “Superintendent, Priv. Sanitarium.”\n\nIn 1930 it’s just Alice, Mary and 1 private servant. (Their mother lived to be 100: born in 1822, she died in 1922.) There’s no longer any mention of an asylum or sanitarium.\n\nMary (AKA Minnie), born in 1854, died in 1932 causing a deep sense of loss and grief to her sister. On a sudden impulse Alice burned Minnie’s papers and many of her photos in a tragic farewell salute.\n\nAlice kept up the animal nightclub until 1947. She died in 1956 and left much of her property to the Cahoons, who had helped supply food for the animals. The Cookes are all buried in the Cedarville Cemetery at Route 6A and Ploughed Neck Road.\n\nIn the 1970s the property was owned by Capt. Colin H. Bell and was used as a furniture refinishing business called “The Country Mouse.” Today the rains pour in and we may soon lose the place where fascinating chapters of Sandwich’s history were created.\n\n(Click photos for a larger view.)\n\nA Bit More About Thornton Burgess\n\nBorn in Sandwich in 1874, Thornton Waldo Burgess was the son of Caroline F. Haywood and Thornton W. Burgess Sr., a direct descendant of Thomas Burgess, one of the first Sandwich settlers in 1637. Thornton W. Burgess, Sr., died the same year his son was born, and the young Thornton Burgess was brought up by his mother in Sandwich. They both lived in humble circumstances with relatives or paying rent.\n\nAs a youth, Thornton worked year round in order to help support himself and his mother. Some of his jobs included tending cows at Town Neck; delivering milk; picking and selling dandelion greens, arbutus, beach plums, wild grapes and blueberries; selling candy made by his mother and trapping muskrats. He also picked cranberries in September; school did not open until October in Sandwich to allow whole families to take part in cranberrying.\n\nBurgess also worked for William C. Chipman, a pioneer grower of pink pond lilies. He had a series of small artificial ponds fed by a stream of spring water. The young Thornton would reach the lillies with a long slender pole that had a knife blade set at an angle at one end for cutting the stems. The mature buds, just ready to break open, were cut, graded, packed in sphagnum moss and shipped to florists all over the country. There was no telephone so Burgess was paid fifteen cents to take Mr. Chipman’s mail and telegrams to the post office in town. The walk, sometimes twice a day, was three miles roundtrip. Chipman lived on Discovery Hill Road, a wildlife habitat of woodland and wetland. This habitat became the setting of many stories Burgess would write referring to the Smiling Pool and the Old Briar Patch (now part of the Green Briar Nature Center).\n\nGraduating from Sandwich High School in 1891, Burgess briefly attended a business college in Boston from 1892 to 1893, living in Somerville, Massachusetts at that time. But he disliked studying business and wanted to write. He moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, where he took a job as an editorial assistant at the Phelps Publishing Company. His first stories were written under the pen name W. B. Thornton.\n\nBurgess married Nina Osborne in 1905, but she died only a year later, leaving him to raise their son alone. It is said that he began writing bedtime stories to entertain his young son, Thornton III.\n\nBurgess remarried in 1911; his wife Francis (Fannie) had two children by a previous marriage. The couple later bought a home in Springfield, Massachusetts which became Burgess’ permanent residence in 1957. His second wife died in August 1950. Burgess returned frequently to Sandwich, which he always claimed as his birthplace and spiritual home. Many of his childhood experiences and the people he knew there (such as Alice Cooke) influenced his interest and were the impetus for his concern for wildlife.\n\nBurgess wrote a syndicated daily newspaper column, “Bedtime Stories,” and he was heard often on radio. His Radio Nature League radio series began at WBZ and WBZA, then located in Springfield, in early January 1925. Burgess broadcast the program from the studio at the Hotel Kimball on Wednesday evening at 7:30pm. Praised by educators and parents, the program had listeners and members in more than 30 states at its peak\n\nBy the time he retired, Burgess had written more than 170 books and 15,000 stories for daily columns in newspapers. He died in 1965 at age 91.\n\nFor more information, read Nature’s Ambassador: The Legacy of Thornton W.

As the number of glass factory workers grew, the company built housing for them as well as a company store and a school. In 1828 a small school was built close to the factory complex on Jarves Street\n\nThe glass company grew even larger and more successful and eventually it became necessary to remove the schoolhouse to alleviate congestion around the factory. Factory Street (now called Dewey Avenue) was extended eastward to the area known as Sand Hill and, in 1851, a new, larger school was erected at 16 Dewey Avenue (at the corner of George’s Rock Road).\n\nKnown as the Jarvesville School or the Sand Hill School, the first building here collapsed while under repair and was replaced in 1885 with a new, more solid structure which still stands today.\n\nThe 1885 Sand Hill School was built in the Carpenter Gothic style with decorative gable and main ridge molding and brackets over the entrance. There was a dividing wall down the middle and the building had two entrance doors (gender-separated entrances were the custom at the time). The two classrooms in the new school served the lower grades in that part of town. For some years prior to the construction of the Henry T. Wing School in 1926-7, the Sand Hill School held the 7th and 8th grades for the entire town.\n\nOver the years, windows were added and the front entrance was modified. After the school was closed, the building served as a meeting hall for American Legion Post #188 (starting in 1931). In 1950, the structure was re-named the Clark-Haddad Memorial Building for the first two Sandwich residents who died during World War I: Alden Clark and Michael Haddad. The building was very heavily used by many groups from the early 60s through the 80s and as a gathering place for children and seniors. The American Legion moved to new quarters in 1972. Later, the building was used as office space by the Sandwich Public Schools until 2007. Today the building stands vacant.\n\n(Photos from the Sandwich Town Archives)\n\n(Click Photos for Larger View)\n\nARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe building is a wood-frame, cross-gabled, 5 bay by 4 bay, 1-story former school house with a high gable on hip roof and a central blind gable dormer. The face of the blind dormer originally had decorative molding in the Carpenter Gothic style. The building has a granite block foundation, wood clapboards on the front elevation, and shingles on the side elevations. The front elevation is articulated with wide cornerboards and fascia, square columns, centered over the projecting front entrance under a piered portico which occupies the central bay of the facade. Other elements include tall 6/6 sash windows, a molded roof cornice and plain frieze.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nGordon, Silene. “Will school offices be on the move?

Main Street – Charles Street Area SDW.D\n\nTown of Sandwich Archives and Historical Center\n\nHistorian John Cullity has been kind enough to share with us an article he wrote in 2006 when the town was considering selling the Sand Hill School building:\n\nThe Clark-Haddad Memorial Building\n\nby John Cullity, May 5, 2006\n\nWithin the last two or three months the idea of our town selling the Clark-Haddad Memorial building at 16 Dewey Ave. was being discussed by some town officials, and this has prompted me to do a little research on the building to better understand its role in town life. For close to 20 years it has been used for school administration, but prior to that use it served the community in many different ways dating back to its construction in 1885. I was also curious about how the name of the building came about. Haddad sounds Middle-Eastern, and as for Clark, my research on him yielded a surprise connection with my own family, which I will share shortly.\n\nTo learn the history of the building I consulted Sandwich, a Cape Cod Town, by R.A. Lovell, Jr., our town archivist Barbara Gill, old annual town reports, and talked to a few people around town. The building was originally called the Jarvesville School, and was built on the site of an older school which had collapsed while under repair. The two classrooms in the new school served the lower grades in that part of town. For some years prior to the construction of the Henry T. Wing School in 1926-7, the Jarvesville School held the 7th and 8th grades for the entire town.\n\nBy 1931 it was being leased to the Clark-Haddad Post of the American Legion, and in 1935 the town voted to establish the building as a permanent war memorial. The American Legion continued its use until their current facility was set up in the late 1960s. In 1950 the building was officially dedicated as the Clark-Haddad Memorial Building, and from then until 1986, the facility was administered by a group of elected trustees. It appears that throughout the time of American Legion use, other groups met there as well. A study of Town of Sandwich Annual Reports indicates that the building was very heavily used by many groups from the early 60s through the 80s, or until the use changed to school administration.\n\nThe list of users through these years provides a good look at community activity in Sandwich. In addition to the American Legion there was a private and later a town-run kindergarten, the Women’s Auxiliary, the Sandwich Women’s Club, the Junior Women’s Club, the Blue Birds, the Faith Baptist Church, Well-Child Clinics, Camp Fire Girls, Sandwich Home Extension Group, Sandwich J.C., the Arts and Crafts Society, Sandwich Gardeners, Boy Scouts – Troop 47, and “supervised parties and dances” – the list goes on and on. The building became home to the Sandwich Council on Aging and their many activities ranging from meals to card games.\n\nThe main point to recognize here is the importance of public meeting halls, not only to serve each specific need, but to build an overall sense of community. We cannot get enough of that. Should the current use of this building cease, let’s keep it in public use.\n\nNow to one of my original questions, who were Clark and Haddad?\n\nAlden Clark and Michael Haddad were the first Sandwich residents to perish during the First World War, though it appears they never made it to the fighting. They both died in February 1918 in this country from illness, shortly after they had enlisted.\n\nMichael Haddad was born in Syria about 1892, and came to this country with his father George, who came to Sandwich “to work at the glass factory”, as his obituary states. Since the Boston and Sandwich Glass Co. had closed in 1888, perhaps he worked at one of the smaller, later glass oriented businesses, of which there were several. Michael lived for nine years with the family of George T. McLaughlin, a very active businessman in town who also served as selectman and led the town band. Michael was said to be very well liked, and “held in high esteem”.\n\nAlden Clark was the youngest child of Robert and Emma Clark who lived at #7 Liberty Street. I haven’t learned what Robert’s profession was, but I have found several references to Alden. He is mentioned, for example, in the 1913 Town Report as one of the workers in the Town Cemetery, and this would likely involve mowing. Of more interest, however, is what I found in the photo album and papers of my grandmother Anna Nye Armstrong (1893-1930), who married Samuel D. White in 1917.\n\nI have studied her photo album for years, and was familiar with a picture of her at her home, Mill Pond Farm (108 Old County Road) sitting on the back of an early motorcycle, with a good-looking guy at the controls. When I asked my mother about this, she thought it might have been Alden Clark, who was boyfriend at that time – she didn’t know any more than this. Earlier this year, my mother showed me another scrapbook of Anna’s that I had never seen. In this was a collection of her classmate’s photos, labeled, including Alden Clark. He was obviously the motorcyclist, though the photos were taken a few years apart. In that portion of her album with graduation photos, there is one of her holding a SHS (Sandwich High School) banner with Alden, also taken at Mill Pond Farm, so clearly they were friends.\n\nTo top it all off, her scrapbook also contained a handwritten copy of the Class of 1913 History and Prophecy written by Francis Joseph Buckley, in which all the classmates are mentioned in different ways – there were only seven in all! By the way, the high school was then located on Academy Lane, off of Grove Street overlooking the Town Hall. The history tells of numerous group projects, carried out in part to raise money for the upcoming class trip to Washington, D.C., which was taken in May, 1913.\n\nThe prophecy was quite imaginative, taking place years later in a sort of dream state. My grandmother was the president of a university, and Alden had become a renowned baseball player. There lives were to be much shorter than predicted, unfortunately, in both cases due to illness, but it appears that their school days were lively and cheerful.\n\nBack to the old Clark-Haddad Memorial Building – I have one more connection there, my only one, actually. Forty long years ago I played in a little band, “The Minus-Four”, at one of those supervised dances mentioned in the town reports, my first real gig as a musician.\n\nI hope this great old building continues to be appreciated.\n\nSetting the record straight on two soldiers\n\nBy Carl Johansen\n\nJuly 06. 2015\n\nCREDIT: Cape Cod Times\n\nThis is an attempt to clarify the historical facts and provide clarity to a myth, which has been perpetuated by some for many years in Sandwich. It is not my intention to disrespect two men who served their country in the military, one as a natural-born citizen and the other as a naturalized citizen, during World War I.\n\nI am referring to Alden Clark of Sandwich, who enlisted in the Army on Sept. 20, 1917, and was assigned to Camp Devens to undergo basic training. I am also referring to Michael Haddad of Boston, an immigrant from Beyreuth, Syria, who was one of 29 Syrians in Massachusetts that enlisted in the war efforts. According to records, Mr. Haddad, at a younger age, lived with George T. McLaughlin and his family in Sandwich.\n\nFor many years, it has been reported that both men were killed in the war in February 1918. As a result, a historic building in Sandwich, built in 1885 as a schoolhouse for glass factory workers, was renamed the Clark-Haddad Memorial Building in 1950. The town is now trying to restore the building on Dewey Avenue.\n\nIt is clear from their death certificates that both men died from diseases while undergoing training here in Massachusetts.\n\nMr. Clark was part of Company H, 302nd Infantry, 76th Division. The 302nd infantry was a part of the fire, truck and hose companies. While undergoing training at Camp Devens, he was promoted to corporal on Jan. 16, 1918. Shortly thereafter, he contracted “septicemia” and died on Feb. 24, 1918. Mr. Clark is buried in the family lot in the Bay View Cemetery in Sandwich. The Gold Star records of Massachusetts state that an American Legion post was named after him.\n\nMr. Haddad enlisted in the Navy on Dec. 7, 1917, in Boston and was in training at the U.S. Naval Training Camp on Bumkin Island in Boston Harbor. He was part of the United States Naval Reserve. Records indicate that he died from pleurisy 47 days after beginning training. His next of kin was listed as Mary McLaughlin, who was living at Mr. Haddad’s address in Roxbury during that time. At the time of his death, Mr. Haddad was listed as being from Boston and working at Padden Motor Co. in Dorchester. However, his body was brought back to Sandwich for burial. Mr. Haddad is buried in the McLaughlin plot in Saint Peter’s Cemetery in Sandwich.\n\nIt is noted that both men filled out their draft cards on the same date — June 5, 1917 — Mr. Clark in Barnstable and Mr. Haddad in Boston. Mr. Clark was 21 and Mr. Haddad was 26 at those signings.\n\nI hope this provides clarity to those who may think that they both were killed as a result of combat during World War I. It is important that history reflect the factual occurrences in the manner they happened. As a veteran, I paid my respects to both men for what they attempted to do in defending our country during World War I. Although they did not die in combat, it was the war, and their training for combat, that likely put them in a position of contracting the diseases.\n\nAll of the documents uncovered for this research will be given to Barbara Gill, the Sandwich historian, with a copy to the Clark-Haddad American Legion Post. Special thanks go to the Town Clerk’s office in the towns of Sandwich, Hull and Chelsea, Sandwich Town Hall and Mrs. Gill for assisting in providing this information for historical clarity.\n\nCarl Johansen lives in Sandwich.\n\nWilliam Eaton and the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument\n\nMemorial Day , 1911\n\nBy William F. Daley\n\nOver 100 years ago, the town of Sandwich celebrated a very special Memorial Day. On May 30, 1911 William Eaton, a wealthy business man from Brockton, donated a 30 foot Civil War Monument to the people of Sandwich. It was erected next to the Town Hall on a piece of greenery that became known as Eaton Square. The Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument is still there today for all to see.\n\nThe dedication took place on a rainy day, but that did not dampen the spirit of the throngs of townspeople and visitors who turned out for the festivities. There was a parade lead by the band from the Keith Car & Mfg. Company and, the full crew of the USRC Gresham, Civil War veterans from the GAR, school children and a host of town officials. There was even a recital of Lincoln’s Address at Gettysburg. Patriotic speeches were given including one by the keynote speaker, John F. (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, the Mayor of Boston and the grandfather of President John F. Kennedy. Mayor Fitzgerald spoke of the custom of various nations honoring their great generals, but said the United States was the one nation to recognize the common soldier in granite.\n\nWilliam Eaton, the donor, was not always a rich man. During his youth he was desperately poor. His English father, James, was a glass worker at the Boston and Sandwich Glass Co. (B&S), but he died in 1856 when William was only 8. There were no government social services in mid 19th century America and young William had no alternative but to go to work at the glass factory. In his short autobiography he describes the situation:\n\nAfter my father’s death I went to work in the Boston and Sandwich Glass Works, where they worked night and day, beginning at one o’clock a.m., Monday. After I worked in the factory some time Mr. Fessenden, the superintendent of the factory, became interested in my case. He sent me to board with a family by the name of Reighel. He paid my board every two weeks to them out of what I earned in the factory; he also gave me what I needed to get shoes and clothes. I tried to be careful of them and tried to make them last as long as possible as I feared I might not be able to pay my way, my wages being very small. After paying for these things, what little was left was saved for me, but this sum was very small.\n\nHe was a tireless worker and by the time he was 14 he had saved enough to buy some furniture, hire a house and make a home for his Irish mother Mary and his 2 brothers. At the factory he was fortunate to meet a good friend of his father, John F. Clayton, who was the steam engineer at the factory. Billy Eaton was interested in all things mechanical and Mr. Clayton took him under his wing, spoke words of encouragement to him and answered the hundreds of questions he put to him. Whenever he had “spare time”, he was in the engine room learning all he could from his mentor. He was a quick learner, had a natural\n\nability in this field; and eventually he became the assistant engineer to Mr. Clayton.\n\nYears later, Mr. Clayton asked the B&S for a raise, but the company refused the request and Clayton resigned. The company asked Eaton to show the new engineer around the factory and to make him familiar with the operations. In an amazing show of loyalty, Eaton said he would not do so and he resigned as well. The company found Mr. Clayton too valuable to lose and he was soon hired back and his demands were satisfied. William returned as well and stayed as Mr. Clayton’s assistant until the company closed in 1888. After Mr. Clayton died, William carried flowers to the grave of his friend at least twice per\n\nyear and did so for the rest of his life.\n\nWilliam Eaton moved on to other parts of the country and improved his career as an engineer. Eventually he made his way back to Brockton where he invested money in real estate and accumulated some wealth. During his retirement years he took the time to visit different places in the US. One of these journeys took him to Gettysburg where he was emotionally overcome with the sacrifices that so many young men made in defending the Union. He remembered his boyhood years in Sandwich and recalled the young lads from\n\nthe glass factory who answered Lincoln’s call for volunteers. It was this experience which motivated him to donate the monument and its inscription reads:\n\nPresented by William Eaton\n\nto his Native Town of\n\nSandwich, Mass.\n\nAs a Memorial to his Father\n\nJames R. Eaton\n\nMay 30, 1911\n\nErected in memory of the\n\nSoldiers and Sailors\n\nFrom This Town\n\nBrave Defenders of the Union\n\nand the Flag\n\nWe Honor Their Noble Deeds.\n\n“Let Us Have Peace”\n\nWhen the Memorial Day festivities took place in Sandwich on May 30, 1911, they were exclusively directed to those who had given their lives during the Civil War. Its tradition was begun by General Logan in 1868 when he had his troops place flowers on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers buried in Arlington National Cemetery. The practice quickly spread among the northern states and May 30 was initially known as Decoration Day. The southern states did not participate in May 30 observances, choosing instead to honor Southern dead on separate days. It wasn’t until the end of World War I that Memorial Day changed from honoring those who died in the Civil War to honoring all Americans who died in any war.\n\nDuring the years from 1861 to 1865, 386 men from Sandwich enlisted in military service. Approximately 100 of these were glass factory workers. Patriotic fervor was running high and Deming Jarves, the head of the glass factory, suspended the rents of any factory worker who enlisted in the war. Volunteers reduced the number of workers in the factory and glass production decreased. It would take years to rebuild the manpower at the factory. By the war’s end, 54 Sandwich men had died on the battlefields or from wounds or diseases. For a small town of 4,500 people, this represented a tremendous sacrifice. It was within this atmosphere that William Eaton spent his early teenage years at the glass factory in Sandwich and as head of his family household.\n\nMartha Hassell, former Curator at the Sandwich Glass Museum, captured the meaning of Eaton’s monument in an article she wrote in 1981. “Although it was particularly those men [enlistees] whom Eaton was honoring in erecting his monument, he was also remembering all the workers of the Boston & Sandwich Glass Factory who had played such an important role in his life. Therefore it seems appropriate that the monument should be placed not only near the town but also facing the Sandwich Glass Museum where so many beautiful\n\npieces of Sandwich glass are on display.”\n\nIt should be said that without Eaton, there would be no Civil War Memorial in Sandwich for town records show that a committee was formed in 1867 to explore the proper way to honor the Civil War dead, but the town ultimately voted to postpone the enterprise and nothing was ever done until William Eaton donated his monument in 1911. He never married and died in Brockton in 1928 at age 80. He is buried in the town where he was born in the Old Town Cemetery on Grove Street and his grave is distinguished by a large Eaton granite stone bearing not only his own name but lovingly those of his parents and brothers and sisters as well. He also honored his first cousin, Joseph Eaton, a glass worker who served in the 36th Massachusetts Regiment during the Civil War. At the Mt. Hope Cemetery on Route 6A, a large granite boulder bearing the name Eaton was placed beside the simple headstone of the Civil War veteran.\n\nEaton had done well in life, but he always felt badly about his own lack of formal education. He had said, “I could have gone farther in life if only I had had some mathematical training.” In his later years he placed $10,000 in a scholarship trust to be used for worthy Sandwich students. He did not name the scholarship after himself, but after the man who had provided him with the education he needed. The John C. Clayton Scholarship has been awarded to deserving Sandwich High School seniors for nearly 80 years and the practice continues to this day.\n\nFinally, William Eaton never forgot how difficult it was to be poor. In his will he set aside $5,000 in trust known as the Mary, Charles and John R. Eaton Memorial Fund in honor of his mother and brothers. It calls for the fund “to provide needy and worthy families in the town with Christmas dinners and other comforts during the Christmas season” It is still in existence today. He was a humble man of quiet dignity who did the best he could. He loved his country, his family and his native town of Sandwich. Mr. Eaton concluded his own short biography with these words. “I have been industrious and it has been a source of great happiness. I have been temperate in my habits and believe in the simple life, which I have followed to a great extent. I have been able to accomplish some things beyond my expectations. I have made the most of the talents God gave me.’\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNew Civil War Memorial Wall Plaque Now in Town Hall\n\nSandwich Men who Died in Military Service during the Civil War 1861-1865"
