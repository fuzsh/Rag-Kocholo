The culvert spans a tributary of Beaver Dam Brook that flows between Plymouth's public recreation area at Fresh Pond and the Massachusetts Audubon Tidmarsh Sanctuary. Along with the removal and replacement of the culvert, the Town will realign the narrow roadway, add a much-needed sidewalk, and establish new, \"green\" stormwater infrastructure, simultaneously protecting public safety, water quality, and ecological habitat at the site.\n\nProject Name: Bellingham PFAS\n\nAmount Requested: $4,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Bellingham\n\nLocation: Bellingham, Norfolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Over just the past decade, the Bellingham Department of Public Works (BDPW) has and continues to expend a significant amount of capital for the design and construction [as well as ongoing operation & maintenance (O&M) costs] for its two Water Treatment Plants (WTPs). When originally constructed, these two WTPs were required for the removal of naturally occurring iron and manganese from their good sources. The BDPW is now facing significant additional capital expenditures for the design and construction (and O&M costs) of upgrades to its Hartford Avenue WTP for the treatment of the newly regulated Per and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS).\n\nIn late 2019, the BDPW detected PFAS concentrations in routine sampling at one of its recently upgraded wells. As a result, the MassDEP required the BDPW to resample the replacement well and its other sources. The BDPW also sampled the WTPs serving the town. The follow-up samples detected PFAS at concentrations requiring treatment at the Hartford Avenue WTP. The town has since been monitoring the PFAS level while investigating ways to implement and pay for the PFAS removal treatment.\n\nThe funding would be used to construct a treatment system for the removal of PFAS at the Hartford Avenue WTP. The BDPW water system consists of 16 groundwater sources serving approximately 6,000 service connections. The population served includes a significant number of vulnerable customers, including three daycares, five schools, and senior housing. When operated individually or in combination, the Hartford Avenue and Wrentham Road WTPs supply 100% of the Town's drinking water.\n\nProject Name: Boston Harbor Islands National Park Area Visitor Enhancement Program\n\nAmount Requested: $500,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Boston Harbor Now\n\nLocation: Boston, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Georges Island Visitor Experience Improvements Project represents a significant investment in the re-development and evaluation of the visitor experience on Georges Island while telling the story and sharing the legacy of this island's past, present, and future. This legacy is interwoven with the 33 other Islands and gateways of the Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park. Fort Warren on Georges Island is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a registered National Landmark. Several other Boston Harbor Islands are also listed on the National Register.\n\nProject Name: Centerville Village Sewer Expansion Project\n\nAmount Requested: $24,400,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Barnstable\n\nLocation: Barnstable, Barnstable County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The purpose of this project is to extend municipal sewer within the Village of Centerville, consistent with the Town of Barnstable's Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan (CWMP), to address nitrogen impairment in the Centerville River. The project will install approximately 5.3 miles of sewers, require 6 new sewer pump stations, connect approximately 350 properties to the municipal sewer system, collect approximately 66,000 gallons per day of wastewater, and remove approximately 6.6 kg/day of nitrogen from the Centerville River Watershed.\n\nProject Name: Chelmsford Water District for Town Wide PFAS Removal\n\nAmount Requested: $2,225,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Chelmsford Water District\n\nLocation: Chelmsford, Middlesex County\n\nProject Purpose: Treatment to remove PFAS from drinking water sources in the Town of Chelmsford.\n\nProject Name: Chicopee Nitrogen Removal Project\n\nAmount Requested: $2,500,000\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Chicopee\n\nLocation: Chicopee, Hampden County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Chicopee Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) is a 15.5 million gallons/day facility, discharging to the Connecticut River, which is a tributary to Long Island Sound, an Estuary of National Significance impaired by nitrogen. This stand-alone project will improve the treatment process and equipment to reduce nitrogen by 200-300 lbs/day; it can be accomplished within one year and will complete the work necessary to implement a larger $60M facility upgrade. This project provides immediate measurable nitrogen reductions, benefiting water quality in the Connecticut River and Long Island Sound, and will improve energy efficiency at the facility, stabilizing operating costs and taxpayer burden.\n\nProject Name: City of Gardner James Street Pump Station\n\nAmount Requested: $1,153,540\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Gardner\n\nLocation: Gardner, Worcester County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The James Street pump station serves water to the northeast neighborhoods of Gardner. The pump station was built during the 1980s and is in need of a renovation.\n\nProject Name: City of Gloucester WPCF FY24\n\nAmount Requested: $3,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Gloucester\n\nLocation: Gloucester, Essex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Originally built in 1984, the City of Gloucester's wastewater treatment plant is the last remaining facility in New England without secondary wastewater treatment. The City recently entered into a Consent Decree with the U.S. Department of Justice, Environmental Protection Agency, and Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to make necessary upgrades to the Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) and construct a secondary treatment plant at the existing site as a result of violations to the state and federal Clean Water acts. The complete project is estimated to cost $150 million to make critical upgrades to the primary wastewater treatment plant and construct a secondary treatment plant.\n\nGloucester's WPCF has reached its life expectancy and upgrades are essential to continue providing essential services to residents and businesses while protecting our environment. In recent months, several key pieces of equipment have failed and require replacements and updates to continue operating; this will be incorporated into the secondary upgrade project in addition to the larger plant construction. We are requesting $3 million to support the incorporation of the design of the critical upgrades at the primary plant required by the Consent Decree.\n\nProject Name: CT River Outfall Lining\n\nAmount Requested: $4,566,400\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Easthampton\n\nLocation: Easthampton, Hampden County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Built in 1949, Easthampton's 2.14-mile outfall weaves between Arcadia Wildlife Sanctuary, and wetlands discharging into the Connecticut River. The project protects public and environmental health by reducing the high probability of wastewater leakage. Eliminating the outfall brings high costs, so the most prudent action is to continue its current mode of operation. Relocation of the outfall piping to either East Street or adjacent to the Manhan Rail Trail is impractical, given the deep excavation and associated high costs related to relocation alternatives. By lining the outfall piping, we extend the life of the outfall piping and eliminate root intrusion.\n\nOur outfall discharges into the Connecticut River, just south of Northampton and north of Holyoke. The quality of wastewater is vitally essential to keep nitrogen and e.coli levels at levels within federal permitting for the Pioneer Valley, down to the Long Island Sound. The Long Island Sound has an EPA-approved total maximum daily load (TMDL) for Nitrogen. Discharges from MS4s in Massachusetts to waters that are tributaries to the Long Island Sound are subject to the requirements of the 2016 MA Small MS4 General Permit Appendix F, part B.1.\n\nThis project has a direct connection to small businesses and jobs. Within Easthampton, the Manhan River is the main tributary stream that flows west to the northeast and feeds into the Connecticut River in the northeast corner of the City via the Oxbow. The outfall ends where the river meets a person-made oxbow, built to accommodate RT 91. With now fish and swimmable river water, the Oxbow area is a flourishing micro-business and recreation center. Its shores host a marine repair shop, a boat dealership, a water ski club, restaurants, a bait shop, and the Easthampton Rod & Club, to name a few - local businesses providing local year-round jobs.\n\nThe outfall is above the Aquifer, endangering the City's drinking supply, including the land where the outfall pipe discharges. This project protects acres of active agricultural land, some owned by the same family for over 50 years. Today, brewers and cannabis growers locate here for the same reason - delicious water and nutrient-rich soil. Both industries bring jobs and retail customers to our Mill District. These hyper-local businesses - produce stands, breweries, farmers' markets, goat, beef dairy, and produce farmers were economic mainstays through the pandemic.\n\nProject Name: Fall River Ferry Street Sewer Pump Station Rehabilitation Project\n\nAmount Requested: $2,416,000\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Fall River\n\nLocation: Fall River, Bristol County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The sewer pump station on Ferry Street is over 60 years old and requires major rehabilitation and capacity improvements to be able to function reliably for the next twenty years. Further exacerbating concerns regarding the pump station's performance is its location along the waterfront within the City Pier watershed, a highly developable area that has quickly become a regional draw for commercial, residential, and clean energy-producing development. This area has been the focus of several recent redevelopment projects, including a reconfiguration of roadways that will create over 19 acres of developable waterfront parcels when completed in 2026. As a result, sewer flows to the pump station are expected to increase significantly and far exceed the current capacity. These performance and capacity issues must be quickly addressed via complete rehabilitation to prevent unplanned and costly major failures, which would discharge directly into the nearby Mount Hope Bay and cause an environmental and public health hazard.\n\nThis proposed rehabilitation will include: (1) installing permanent force main bypass connection, (2) replacing the concrete block structure housing the generator and deteriorated foundation floor with a reinforced concrete building on a pile foundation, (3) replacing a natural gas standby generator with a diesel standby generator, (4) constructing flood-hardened structures to the base flood elevation plus three feet, (5) rehabilitating dry well concrete structure with cementitious waterproof coatings, (6) replacing ultrasonic level measurement with primary and backup transducers and a high-level float, (7) replacing wet well access with new concrete cover and water-tight hatch, (8) installing SCADA communication with the wastewater treatment facility to indicate operating conditions and alarms, (9) upgrading the primary electrical feed to a standard 480 volt 3-phase service, (10) replacing electrical equipment, (11) replacing pumps, valves, and piping in drywell and wet well, and (12) replacing ventilation systems.\n\nProject Name: Fall River Material Separation and Transfer Facility Project\n\nAmount Requested: $5,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Fall River\n\nLocation: Fall River, Bristol County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The City of Fall River will construct a material separation and transfer facility at the site of its existing public works facility on Lewiston Street (Phase I), which is located inside a structurally decrepit former incinerator that was shuttered in 1999 for producing airborne pollutants at up to twelve times the volume considered to be safe exposure for certain toxins. In addition, the City will also create space for its Department of Community Maintenance (DCM) offices (Phase II) on the same premises to create a central headquarters for all of the City's recycling and waste management efforts.\n\nCurrently, the Lewiston Street facility has no material separation capabilities and functions solely as a transfer station for all of the City's material solid waste, which is collected unseparated from residents' homes by a vendor who then transports it to our facility. At the facility, City employees compact the unseparated waste and load it onto the truck of yet another vendor, who then transports it to a separate facility where it is separated and sold for profit. The City pays upward of $1 million per year on the aforementioned contracts and sees none of the profits from the sale of its recyclables.\n\nThe construction of a Municipally owned and operated material separation and transfer facility at the Lewiston Street site will (1) increase recycling capture rates with the introduction of on-site separation capabilities, (2) improve health outcomes in a historically environmentally disadvantaged community, and (3) establish a local end-market for recycled commodities by enabling the City to sell its separated waste materials, which will save the City millions of dollars per year in vendor costs and generate even more in additional revenue.\n\nThis project will be accompanied both by the incorporation of separate bins for separate waste streams and by a series of community outreach and education efforts led by Groundwork Southcoast, a community non-profit committed to environmental justice and youth leadership. These efforts are already underway, with DCM slated to implement a pilot program to introduce additional recycling bins at single-family residences in April 2023. If successful, these bins will become permanent and expand to include multi-family residences as well. In addition, the City has also already begun a cart maintenance program, which will both ensure that residents' waste bins are functioning properly and create an inventory of waste bin serial numbers that will later aid the City in effectively enforcing the stricter waste disposal guidelines that the proposed separation facility will require.\n\nProject Name: Going to Scale: Regional Urban Forestry in Greater Boston's Mystic Watershed\n\nAmount Requested: $4,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Mystic River Watershed Association\n\nLocation: Arlington, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: MyRWA will work with 20 communities to plant 5,000 trees across the watershed between now and 2026, prioritizing underserved neighborhoods of color that we found to be the hottest per MyRWA's Wicked Hot Mystic maps. We will do this by bringing down both the cost and mortality of planting new trees, coordinating efforts to engage communities and train youth and adults in tree care, and focusing our efforts in underserved urban heat islands where predominantly low-income BIPOC residents live and in major public parks where people can go to cool off.\n\nProject Name: Green Infrastructure in the Mystic River Watershed\n\nAmount Requested: $4,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Arlington\n\nLocation: Arlington, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: We propose a regional green infrastructure project in the 21 municipalities of the Mystic River watershed, Arlington as lead: a system of small-scale, cost-effective installations that distribute the benefits of stormwater management regionally. The principal tools will be: 1) Infiltration trenches: Pioneered in Arlington, an efficient street trench design has been used 100 times across the watershed. 100 more sites are shovel-ready. 2) Tree trenches: Trenches with co-benefits of urban greening and cooling. 3) Rain gardens. 4) Other green infrastructure Best Management Practices. The project will seek the most cost-effective solutions possible across settings, from the full palette of options\n\nProject Name: Horn Pond Water Treatment Plant PFAS Mitigation\n\nAmount Requested: $3,800,000\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Woburn\n\nLocation: Woburn, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The project will add granular activated carbon (GAC) treatment to remove PFAS in drinking water at the Horn Pond Water Treatment Plant which is essential to comply with Massachusetts Drinking Water Standards and provide the public with a safe water supply. It also includes a control system and Cybersecurity upgrades to strengthen the resiliency of critical drinking water infrastructure.\n\nProject Name: Implementing an Advanced Septic System Treatment Technology Incubator at MASSTC\n\nAmount Requested: $707,937\n\nIntended Recipient: Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Technology Center\n\nLocation: Sandwich, Barnstable County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: This project will provide resident research facilities at the Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Technology Center (MASSTC) and leverage existing associations with academic and other research institutions to address the many challenges of wastewater treatment near water resources including nutrients, contaminants of emerging concern, forever chemicals (PFAS), and pathogens. In many coastal and rural areas, onsite wastewater treatment systems do not receive proportional research, attention, or funding given to centralized wastewater treatment.\n\nBy providing convenient facilities for laboratories and short-term habitation we hope to encourage the development of novel measures to treat wastewater by private industry and research universities.\n\nProject Name: Montague Sewer Collection System and Clean Water Facility Improvements\n\nAmount Requested: $2,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Montague\n\nLocation: Turners Falls, Franklin County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Town of Montague has two separate sewer systems; Millers Falls and Turners Falls. The Turners Falls sewer system conveys sewage to the Montague Clean Water Facility (CWF) where it is treated before being discharged to the Connecticut River. The Turner's Falls sewer system is a combined sewer system containing three combined sewer overflow (CSO) structures located at 7th and L Streets, Avenue A, and Greenfield Road.\n\nOrdinarily, some stormwater is sent to the CWF before it is discharged into the Connecticut River. However, during high rainfall events, the treatment plant cannot process all of the combined wastewater. Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) were built to deal with this excess wastewater, essentially bypassing the treatment plant.\n\nThe Town of Montague was issued an Administrative Order (CWA-AO-R01-FY20-31) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on June 11, 2020, addressing compliance with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit (No. MA0100137) to meet numeric effluent limitations and minimize Combined Sewer Overflows in the Turners Falls Wastewater Collection System. The Administrative Order specifically brought attention to \"excursions of the water quality criterion for E. coli bacteria in the Connecticut River\" from untreated combined sewage that was discharged from CSO outfalls between 2018 and 2019 and required an update to the Town's CSO LTCP.\n\nThe proposed project will remove excessive infiltration/inflow from the Turners Falls sewer collection system, minimize Combined Sewer Overflows and sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) volumes in the Turners Falls sewer collection system, implement short-term and immediate recommendations for the Turners Falls sewer collection system being written into the CSO Long-Term Control Plan Update, due to the EPA by June 30th, 2023, and maximize the use of existing infrastructure in the Turners Falls sewer collection system to minimize CSOs.\n\nProject Name: New West Parish Filters Water Treatment Plant\n\nAmount Requested: $5,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Springfield Water and Sewer Commission\n\nLocation: Agawam, Hampden County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Springfield Water and Sewer Commission is currently designing a new drinking water treatment plant to serve 250,000 people in the lower Pioneer Valley, including a large number of vulnerable and Environmental Justice populations located in Springfield. The new plant is intended to eliminate the increasingly unacceptable risk to public health and access to safe water the 1970s (and older) existing plant poses to the entire region. The new plant will incorporate clarification technology to address non-compliance with disinfection byproducts; add new rapid sand filtration and chemical feed systems; and electrical upgrades to maximize energy efficiency.\n\nProject Name: Newburyport Reservoir Protection\n\nAmount Requested: $882,500\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Newburyport\n\nLocation: Newburyport, Essex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: This project will protect the future of our region's water supply from the anticipated effects of climate change, including more frequent contaminants causing algal blooms and river flooding, by directly connecting our largest source of water to our water treatment facility. This will save millions of gallons of water annually and prevent future emergency measures in the event of threats to our water supply.\n\nProject Name: North Reading Town Center Wastewater Construction\n\nAmount Requested: $1,500,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of North Reading\n\nLocation: North Reading, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The purpose of this project is to connect municipal and school buildings to the wastewater treatment system owned by the Town and currently operated by its public schools.\n\nProject Name: Pepperell Groton Dunstable regional PFAS filtration\n\nAmount Requested: $1,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Pepperell\n\nLocation: Pepperell, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Pepperell, Groton, and Dunstable Massachusetts share a common border near a freshwater well site in Pepperell. Each community hopes to provide clean water to its community. Pepperell's well site and pumping station have a low but detectable PFAS concentration. PFAS has also been detected in Groton's water. This proposal is to build one filtration plant and provide clean water access to all three communities. Much of the distribution infrastructure is already in place.\n\nProject Name: PFAS Project Lab Municipal Testing Initiative\n\nAmount Requested: $859,666\n\nIntended Recipient: Northeastern University\n\nLocation: Boston, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: This request will fund a PFAS testing, mapping, and outreach initiative in select high-risk cities and towns across the Commonwealth and provide for the acquisition of PFAS contamination testing, monitoring, and mapping tools and supplies in those communities. The acquisition of these supplies and equipment will allow Northeastern's PFAS Project Lab, in collaboration with Silent Spring Institute, participating cities and towns, and other community partners to launch a multi-municipality PFAS monitoring and testing program in the Commonwealth.\n\nProject Name: Phase 1/1A Sewer Project\n\nAmount Requested: $1,600,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Sudbury\n\nLocation: Sudbury, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Phase 1/1A Sewer System Conceptual/Preliminary Design effort includes the preliminary design of the Towns first municipal Wastewater Treatment Facility and associated groundwater discharge to support removing failing and/or improperly operating septic systems in and around drinking water supplies that will ensure preservation and protection of the Town's major drinking water supplies, to preserve and protect public health, as well as surrounding environmental resources.\n\nProject Name: Pump Station Efficiency & Reliability Improvements for WWTF\n\nAmount Requested: $2,240,000 (Total project cost is $2,800,000)\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Acton\n\nLocation: Acton, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Acton sewer pump station project includes the rehabilitation of several pump stations throughout Acton's Sewer District. This project is critical to ensure the continued operation of these pump stations to support much of Acton's existing commercial areas, but it ensures that reliable sewer service/capacity is available for several proposed future housing developments along with Kelley's Corner improvements.\n\nProject Name: Ramah Circle and Downtown Stormwater Infrastructure Improvements\n\nAmount Requested: $2,400,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Agawam\n\nLocation: Agawam, Hampden County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Ramah Circle area experiences flooding in the northern portion of this mixed-use neighborhood and the adjacent downtown area has inadequate drainage infrastructure. Flooding of some businesses and disruption in the area have resulted, as well as the degradation of stormwater infrastructure, roads, and streams. The project will advance selected alternatives to improve the stormwater collection system and perform stream restoration throughout the Ramah Circle area and downstream to the Westfield River. It is anticipated to include reconstruction and improvements to increase stormwater collection system capacity within and downstream of the flooding areas, stream restoration, and daylighting portions of culverted streams.\n\nProject Name: Regional Wastewater Needs\n\nAmount Requested: $700,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Hull\n\nLocation: Hull, Plymouth County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Town of Hull, MA, working as the Lead Community on behalf of the neighboring communities of Scituate and Cohasset, MA, is requesting a $700,000 FY24 Earmark to be matched by $300,000 in local funding ($100,000 each has been committed from local revenues by each collaborating community) for the development of a regional wastewater plan. The plan will continue and expand work to address regional wastewater needs across the three communities, benefiting them individually and collectively. The expected implementation of the plan will create an economy of scale, by sharing rather than replicating waste treatment facilities and equipment. A regional approach will also better protect the public health and environment through improved handling of wastewater flows. An expanded regional collection system with secondary treatment at the Hull Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) will dramatically reduce nutrients from existing septic systems that are presently traveling underground to fresh and marine waters and causing water quality impairments. Nutrient loading into the Gulf River, which empties into Cohasset Harbor, which has experienced degradation due to non-point (Cohasset and Scituate septic systems) and point source (Cohasset WWTF discharges to the Gulf River under its NPDES Permit) pollution will be reduced and or eliminated, thus restoring these water resources to their intended uses. The RCWMP will also provide for any potential future need for the Town of Cohasset to send all flows to Hull, if and when Cohasset's WWTF reaches its useful life. Hull currently owns and operates a 3.07 MGD facility that has the capacity needed to service the regional partners' wastewater needs. There is also potential for the Town of Hingham to join the regional wastewater group, specifically with sewer needs in the Worlds End area.\n\nProject Name: Roseway Preservation Project\n\nAmount Requested: $500,000\n\nIntended Recipient: World Ocean School\n\nLocation: Boston, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The National Historic Landmark schooner, Roseway, is nearing her 100th anniversary and needs a preservation project to address areas of concern in structural wood dating back to her original construction in 1925. This funding will specifically address two key areas, the frames, and keelson of the vessel, which are integral to the infrastructure and constitute a major portion of the preservation effort.\n\nProject Name: Sewer Main Improvement Project on Stonehamâ€™s Park Street and Fallon Roads\n\nAmount Requested: $4,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Stoneham\n\nLocation: Stoneham, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Town of Stoneham requests a Sewer Main Improvement Project on Park Street and Fallon Road, which is located in the southwesterly part of town, for funding. Our municipal sewer systems transport human waste from homes and businesses and treat it in a centralized wastewater plant at Deer Island. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) provides water and sewer service and the Town has 5 pumping stations, 75 miles of water, and 75 miles of sewer, all of which are overseen by the Stoneham Public Works Water and Sewer Department. Aging pipe networks challenge our wastewater infrastructure and many of these pipes are over a hundred years old. This project seeks to implement engineered designs to re-lay portions of the sewer main, along with extending other areas to the system.\n\nProject Name: Town of Amherst - Centennial Water Treatment Plant\n\nAmount Requested: $5,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Amherst\n\nLocation: Amherst, Hampshire County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Town of Amherst is reconstructing the Centennial Water Treatment Plant that was taken out of service in 2018 due to age and condition. This facility represents about a third of the Town's treated water capacity. The new facility will use the latest technology to treat water and meet the latest water quality regulations. The treatment plant pulls water from a series of three connected reservoirs located in Pelham, Massachusetts. It is currently on the Intended Use Plan for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. Design work for this project is complete and the Town has received construction bids.\n\nProject Name: Town of Concord CDS FY24 Request\n\nAmount Requested: $1,500,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Concord\n\nLocation: Concord, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Nagog WTF Project Purpose is to construct a new 1.5 million gallons per day (MGD) water treatment facility to filter and treat the Town's surface water supply (Nagog Pond). This supply resource is critical to meet the Town's potable water demands. The Project will also address the Disinfection Byproduct Rule non-compliance for bromate maximum contaminant level (MCL) exceedances. The Project will also incorporate treatment provisions to meet new federal MCLs for PFAs (\"forever chemicals\").\n\nProject Name: Town of Ware\n\nAmount Requested: $525,000 (Total project cost is $1,025,000)\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Ware\n\nLocation: Ware, Hampden County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Funds will be used in conjunction with a pending EPA Brownfield Cleanup Grant to complete the Brownfield Cleanup project located at 0 Monroe Street, directly adjacent to Ware's athletic complex - Memorial Field. Upon cleanup completion, the site will be capped with a 100-space parking lot with EV charging stations, and a multi-purpose court, and also include ADA-accessible improvements for visitors to access the adjacent Memorial Field.\n\nProject Name: Tri-Town Water Plant Army Corps Tribal Archeological Relief\n\nAmount Requested: $974,720\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Holbrook\n\nLocation: Holbrook, Norfolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Town of Holbrook operates a joint drinking water facility with Randolph and Braintree. Initially constructed in the 1880s and refurbished in the 1930s, this existing plant outlived its usefulness yet remains operational during the construction of the replacement facility targeted for completion in 2026. The project requires additional, unforeseen funding due to the discovery of tribal artifacts at the site of the new treatment plant. In compliance with the Army Corps permit conditions, the towns were required to hire an on-site archeologist and compensate three different tribal nations for oversight services. Additionally, delays in the construction schedules have also imposed costly delay claims, ultimately creating a financial hardship on already beleaguered ratepayers in a town with a population of 11,500.\n\nProject Name: Tyngsborough, MA- Sewer Capacity Project\n\nAmount Requested: $480,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Tyngsborough Sewer Commission\n\nLocation: Tyngsborough, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The purpose of this Sewer Capacity Project is to ensure Tyngsborough maintains sewer capacity in this area of town to support housing and economic development.\n\nProject Name: Wareham Fire District Water Infrastructure Upgrade\n\nAmount Requested: $1,536,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Wareham Fire District,\n\nLocation: Wareham, Plymouth County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The purpose of this water infrastructure project is to make improvements to the water distribution system, specifically the water mains. This project would add 3,050 feet of 12-inch water main, which will have a dual purpose of water transmission and localized distribution. Improvements in drinking water quality, quantity, pressure, system resilience, and therefore public safety and well-being will be realized for a variety of customers' existing needs: residential/domestic, commercial, and industrial.\n\nAbove and beyond these fundamental benefits, the project additionally is in a location where the adjacent community of Rochester connects to Wareham. Rochester and Wareham have an Inter-Municipal Agreement (IMA), wherein Wareham provides Rochester with drinking water. This proposed water main is critical to ensuring sufficient water is delivered to the neighboring community.\n\nThis project is progressive in that it works to harness economies of scale. It's helping to establish a regional water system through the consolidation of resources. This high-impact project will serve both communities of Rochester and Wareham and leverage resources to the maximum extent possible. It additionally will improve the water service connection of an MBTA facility.\n\nYet another aspect of this high-impact project is the existing MBTA facility's expansion that will be completed in FY24, ahead of this proposed water main upgrade. The MBTA facility is located on Kings Highway in Rochester; it serves the Middleborough/Lakeville commuter rail. The MBTA facility services and maintains commuter rail cars here which are used in the transportation corridor that Rochester is an adjacent community. In FY24 ahead of this proposed project, the MBTA is extending a 12-inch water main on Kings Highway 1,700 feet from County Road to their facility. This is precisely the point (County Road) where Wareham will extend its proposed 3,050 feet of 12-inch and connect to.\n\nIn summary, this proposed 3,050-foot 12-inch water main upgrade would ensure that sufficient water will be available to the MBTA facility, residents, and businesses in Wareham and Rochester, and therefore that water system resources are optimally consolidated and economies of scale are leveraged.\n\nProject Name: Wayland Permanent Drinking Water Supply Connection to MWRA\n\nAmount Requested: $1,016,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Wayland Department of Public Works\n\nLocation: Wayland, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: This project will be the critical first phase in the Town of Wayland establishing a new permanent connection to the MWRA to improve water quality and restore lost capacity and resiliency of the Town's drinking water supply for the long term. This project consists of the application for admission to the MWRA, permitting, and design of a new pumping station and new pipelines to convey MWRA water to Wayland. The project is primarily to support existing Town water supply needs.\n\nProject Name: Westfield, MA: PFAS Medical Monitoring (pilot)\n\nAmount Requested: $1,047,286\n\nIntended Recipient: University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML)\n\nLocation: Lowell, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Widespread PFAS contamination has led to elevated blood PFAS levels in several communities, including Westfield, as documented by a recent CDC/ATSDR report. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) have put forth a set of recommendations for medical screening and surveillance of people with elevated blood PFAS levels for several health endpoints. Implementation of these recommendations on a large scale poses multiple challenges to state and local health departments and healthcare providers for which they are under-resourced to address. To date, there is no systematic medical monitoring of PFAS-impacted communities in Massachusetts, although the Commonwealth has promulgated some of the most comprehensive and stringent drinking water standards in the US. The proposed medical monitoring program will enroll Westfield residents, and collect and analyze blood and urine for PFAS and health biomarkers associated with documented health effects of PFAS, per the National Academies recommendation. The project will provide a rigorous, scientifically defensible framework of methodologies and tools to connect the residents' exposures to PFAS with their health biomarker data. The proposed project is designed to pilot and implement NASEM-recommended medical monitoring and could be used to inform the design of a larger-scale longitudinal program at the state and/or federal level.\n\nProject Name: Westport Trunk Sewer and Water\n\nAmount Requested: $5,500,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Town of Westport\n\nLocation: Westport, Bristol County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Build the critical first phase connection to the Fall River regional sewer system. Unlock the long-term North Westport water and sewer service area.\n\nProject Name: 23-24 Sewer Improvements - Marblehead MA\n\nAmount Requested: $2,420,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Marblehead Water & Sewer Commission\n\nLocation: Marblehead, Essex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The purpose of this project is to protect local water quality by reducing the volume of infiltration and Inflow entering the sanitary sewer system and avoid future sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs).\n\nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n\nLink to FY24 Financial Certification Letter\n\nProject Name: Achieving a Thriving Future for All â€“ Revolutionizing Conservation Education\n\nAmount Requested: $400,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Commonwealth Zoological Corporation, Zoo New England, The Franklin Park Zoo and Stone Zoo,\n\nLocation: Boston, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: This project will provide current climate change scientific content along with mechanisms and techniques for conservation engagement across all learning opportunities. Graphics, guest encounters, and school curriculum will be updated with more interactive components such as touch, sight, audio, and other learning activities providing a richer understanding of climate change and nature-based solutions to protect ecosystems and species.\n\nThis project will also encourage people to actively engage in conservation and other environmental initiatives and work to change attitudes and perceptions about the environment and the need to protect it. Our strategic goal is to develop greater conservation ethics in visitors and inspire conservation/environmental action. Students (MA school students receive free admission) and general audiences will be connected emotionally and intellectually through meaningful experiences that enhance their ability to connect to calls to action.\n\nThe scientific community and environmentalists have been educating the public for decades, and yet we find ourselves in an ever-spiraling situation where the health of the environment continues to degrade, extreme storms, heat, floods, and other weather events continue to increase with devastating results, including loss of species, habitats, and loss of human life. Knowledge alone does not change behavior. ZNE's graphics and interpretation will include messaging that fosters an appreciation for wildlife and result in changed conservation behavior. This will be accomplished both person-to-person and through graphics by using visuals and visual descriptions, communicating clear and feasible actions, and sharing stories and support for conservation action.\n\nProject Name: Atlantic White Shark Conservancy\n\nAmount Requested: $190,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Atlantic White Shark Conservancy\n\nLocation: Chatham, Barnstable County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Over the past decade, Cape Cod has emerged as the newest great white shark hotspot. Great whites hunt for seals along popular swimming beaches in the summer and fall, and interactions between sharks and humans are on the rise. As part of ongoing efforts to mitigate the growing potential for shark-human conflict in Massachusetts, this proposal will support scientific studies designed to improve understanding of shark occurrence and behavior off our coastline. The results of the supported studies will be directly provided to local officials to inform public safety practices and will be incorporated into outreach efforts to educate beachgoers.\n\nProject Name: Blue Economy Center\n\nAmount Requested: $987,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Massachusetts Maritime Academy\n\nLocation: Buzzards Bay, Barnstable County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Expansion of the Blue Economy Center (BEC) within Massachusetts Maritime Academy's (MMA) Marine Science, Safety, and Environmental Protection (MSSEP) program.\n\nProject Name: Brockton Police Radio Communication Infrastructure Project\n\nAmount Requested: $1,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Brockton\n\nLocation: Brockton, Plymouth County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Brockton Police Department's existing radio communication infrastructure is 10 years beyond its useful life. Overall the communication infrastructure is over 25 years old and requires parts that are no longer manufactured. In a situation that requires an immediate repair, the Brockton Police Department must either use spare parts or utilize portable radios. Portable radios are very limited in terms of range and bandwidth needed for the entire City and spare parts. The typical life of radio communication infrastructure, in general, is only 10-15 years.\n\nProject Name: Burlington Life Sciences Innovation Center Equipment\n\nAmount Requested: $1,106,400\n\nIntended Recipient: Northeastern University\n\nLocation: Boston, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: This funding will support the creation of a new shared state-of-the-art wet laboratory and Biosafety Level 2 (BSL2) facility. The facility will be made available for community-oriented workforce training and education programs, shared community use, and as a resource to assist early-stage life sciences and biotech companies in their development and to facilitate new pathways for job training and job creation. Specifically, this investment would facilitate the creation of a shared wet lab and BSL2 facility to enable new early-stage life sciences companies to develop and be part of an established vibrant innovation ecosystem. These new companies would be co-located on the Innovation Campus at Burlington, MA (ICBM) alongside Northeastern's Biopharmaceutical Analysis and Training Laboratory (BATL) and Life Sciences Training Center, which are enabling innovative biopharmaceutical education, global regulatory convergence, industry partnerships, and use-inspired research for the benefit of patients worldwide. In addition, BATL's intellectual and capital equipment resources would be made available to these early-stage companies to help advance their innovations. This new space will also enable our defense research partners to interact with small companies working at the cutting edge of biomedical sciences-a critical priority for defense agencies. The shared wet lab model has proven successful, in the case of ICBM's existing Barracks Venture Creation Center (VCC), which houses early-stage companies that require research chemistry wet lab space (e.g., specifically equipped with chemical fume hoods). Overall, this proposed wet lab and BSL 2 project would significantly bolster Massachusetts' ability to grow its capacity within the life sciences industries, in particular by expanding opportunities near but outside Cambridge/Kendall Sq.\n\nProject Name: Central Massachusetts Watershed Project\n\nAmount Requested: $1,111,458\n\nIntended Recipient: Worcester State University\n\nLocation: Worcester, Worcester County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Urbanization can strongly impact the quality and biodiversity of streams and lakes, with important implications for ecosystems and adjacent communities. This project will examine the temporal and spatial variability in water quality and biodiversity in the\n\nTatnuck Brook watershed. It will continually monitor various aspects of water quality (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, light, turbidity) in water bodies along an urbanization gradient, from headwaters to urban locations. Periodic sampling will measure ions and dissolved organics. Sediments will be analyzed for organics, metals, and flux rates. This work will be conducted in collaboration with the City of Worcester, community groups, and-most importantly-Worcester State students. It will promote the health of our waterways (see letters of support) and will also provide students with high-impact learning experiences that highlight the diverse interests, values, and perspectives about watersheds.\n\nThis project offers broader benefits as well. The data collected by this project will guide decision-making around future water and land use issues, thus impacting hundreds of thousands of people who live in the Blackstone River watershed. Their enjoyment of this backyard natural resource is hampered when poor water quality closes beaches on Coes Reservoir and other water bodies.\n\nThe work proposed here aligns directly with NOAA's mission to improve measurement science in ways that improve our quality of life. The multifaceted research proposed here will implement an innovative network of spatially distributed water quality measurements along an urbanization gradient. Having accurate water quality data is paramount to allowing policymakers to make decisions that improve water resources in a densely populated urban area, improving the quality of life for the hundreds of thousands of people in the area. Further, we propose developing new methods for measurements where needed, once again fulfilling a NIST mission. The STEM education activities will reach students from K-12 through college, engaging diverse students in hands-on community-engaged experiences.\n\nProject Name: Coskata-Coatue Resiliency Barrier Beach Project\n\nAmount Requested: $364,000\n\nIntended Recipient: The Trustees of the Reservations\n\nLocation: Boston, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Trustees of Reservations seek $364,000 in FY24 Congressionally Directed Spending to support the Coskata-Coatue Resiliency Barrier Beach Project in the Town of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The project would take place on the Coskata-Coatue Wildlife Refuge, an ecologically valuable 1,117-acre barrier beach system that hosts fish and wildlife habitat, including several federally threatened and endangered plants, shorebirds, and migratory birds; and a red cedar savannah and woodland which is the largest of its kind in New England.\n\nThe refuge is owned and managed for conservation purposes by several partners including The Trustees and the Nantucket Conservation Foundation, as well as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The US Coast Guard owns the Great Point Light House, which sits on National Wildlife Refuge owned by USFWS.\n\nThe Coskata-Coatue barrier beach systems protect the Town of Nantucket and Nantucket Harbor from storms, storm surge, tidal flooding, and sea level rise and yet remains increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Without strategic and targeted intervention to restore, protect and conserve these critical natural buffers and build resilience to climate impacts, the losses faced will have tremendous local and regional impacts on biodiversity and the community.\n\n$364,000 in Congressionally Directed Spending would be used to support feasibility studies, design development, and permitting to strengthen and restore two highly vulnerable coastal sites along the barrier beach system of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The two sites are known as â€œCoskata Pondâ€? and the â€œHaulover.â€? (See Figure 2 and See Figure 3, attached in supplemental documents). A Climate Vulnerability Assessment conducted in 2022 determined that these two sites are highly susceptible to breaching; a breach would allow flow between the open ocean and Nantucket Harbor, threatening harbor infrastructure and downtown Nantucket. Feasibility studies, design, and federal, state, and local permits will lead to innovative nature-based climate adaptation solutions that will provide critical resiliency benefits for the region, including the protection of cultural institutions, historic resources, businesses, and homes from storms, storm surge, tidal flooding, and sea level rise. It will also maintain access to the refuge and the Great Point Lighthouse, owned by the US Coast Guard. Using nature-based resilience techniques will help to protect, strengthen, and restore state and federal threatened and endangered species habitat. The Trustees' proposed project will have far-reaching impacts on the region as the innovative project design approach will utilize nature-based techniques that can be replicated on similar barrier beach systems.\n\nProject Name: Creating Digital Infrastructure to Expand the Healthy Air Network\n\nAmount Requested: $370,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Partners for a Healthier Community, Public Health Institute of Western MA\n\nLocation: Springfield, Hampden County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Healthy Air Network (healthyairnetwork.org) will expand its reach through:\n\ndevelopment of an app and website upgrades to provide greater access and better usability to the hyperlocal air quality data on particulate matter and ozone collected by the Healthy Air Network. This will be done through a community-driven design process to ensure that the data is presented in a way that is useful and actionable for community residents.\n\nadding 50 air sensors, 10 sensors in each of 5 communities, tracking hyperlocal air quality in MA, and calibrating and monitoring the sensors to ensure research quality data.\n\nProject Name: Demonstrating and Inspiring Sustainable Actions for Children and Families\n\nAmount Requested: $535,500\n\nIntended Recipient: Discovery Museum, Inc.\n\nLocation: Acton, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: For the Demonstrating and Inspiring Sustainable Actions project, Discovery Museum will draw upon its industry-leading sustainability practices as content for a comprehensive series of new learning experiences designed to motivate the next generation of environmental stewards. Unlike a typical exhibit, the Museum's entire campus and its extensive sustainability work will become the center of learning for this unique initiative. The Museum has taken highly visible, concrete actions to reduce its carbon footprint in recent years, including installing a solar array that generates enough electricity to fully power its facilities and implementing a first-of-its-kind carbon offset program for commuting staff and Museum members. Congressionally Directed Spending funds will support the Museum in achieving two parallel goals: taking additional steps to measurably reduce its carbon emissions and, with the understanding that children learn more from what we do than from what we say, using these actions to educate and inspire.\n\nProject Name: eWHALER project:\"Extracting Weather data: Historical Analysis of Logbooks for Environmental Research\"\n\nAmount Requested: $1,800,000\n\nIntended Recipient: University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (Department of History)\n\nLocation: North Dartmouth, Bristol County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: A collaborative cross-disciplinary project in which historians & oceanographers extract/analyze weather data from whaling ships' logbooks going back over 250 years (1760s-1920s). This data helps scientists understand weather patterns over centuries, which is useful for modern ocean navigation, agriculture, commerce, supply chain planning, coastal management, and national defense. Providing a long-term context for shifting global wind patterns is one of the main goals of this project, to better understand and anticipate changing wind and pressure systems in a warming climate, with implications for ocean navigation, and for aiding vulnerable communities to plan for changing weather conditions in the future.\n\nProject Name: Fishing for Data: Massachusetts Cooperative Fisheries Research\n\nAmount Requested: $2,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Coonamessett Farm Foundation, Inc.\n\nLocation: East Falmouth, Barnstable County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Coonamessett Farm Foundation is proposing a program that will provide Massachusetts fishers with the necessary equipment and training to further develop their ability to collect and disseminate oceanographic and fisheries data. This will utilize their ecological knowledge to advance our understanding of climate change. The program also serves to collect and analyze the data, producing products that will inform fishers on existing and projected oceanographic and ecological trends. In turn, this will provide fishers with a broad range of support, enabling them to be more intimately involved in the process, and increasing the industry's adaptability and resilience.\n\nProject Name: Framingham State University's McAuliffe Center for Integrated Science Learning\n\nAmount Requested: $999,500\n\nIntended Recipient: Framingham State University\n\nLocation: Framingham, Middlesex County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: This is a request by the McAuliffe Center for Integrated Science Learning (McAuliffe Center) at Framingham State University (FSU) to acquire a suite of innovative technology for the newly created McAuliffe Simulation Lab (MSL). MSL will help address the growing demand for STEM jobs in Massachusetts by providing cradle-to-career learning experiences designed to leverage NASA's portfolio of STEM engagement opportunities and activities through the use of innovative high-resolution visualizations and virtual reality simulations. MSL programming will complement learning experiences in the McAuliffe Center's recently upgraded Challenger Learning Center and refurbished digital planetarium. The integration of programming in these three discrete environments will establish the McAuliffe Center as a unique STEM learning hub in the Commonwealth, well-positioned to pursue goals articulated in the NASA Strategy for STEM Engagement. High-resolution visualizations and shared virtual reality simulations will be used to design STEM learning experiences that provide powerful connections to NASA's mission and work, and that attract and spark the interest of diverse groups of students. These experiences will contribute to building a diverse future STEM workforce, and thus contribute to meeting Massachusetts' STEM workforce demands, by engaging students in authentic learning experiences with people and content from NASA's space and earth science missions. Located on the campus of Framingham State University, the McAuliffe Simulation Lab will equip the university with modern technology to provide innovative learning experiences to its increasingly diverse student population and thus contribute to diversifying the Commonwealth's STEM workforce. Access to innovative NASA-themed STEM experiences will especially benefit an increasing number of MetroWest K-12 students who, due to economic barriers and lack of transportation, would not have access to similar resources otherwise.\n\nProject Name: FY24 Boston Medical Center Violence Intervention Advocacy Program (VIAP)\n\nAmount Requested: $380,652\n\nIntended Recipient: Boston Medical Center (BMC) Corporation\n\nLocation: Boston, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Boston Medical Center (BMC) Violence Intervention Advocacy Program (VIAP) was founded in 2006 to respond to the needs of victims of community violence and the families of those impacted by violence and homicide to recover from physical and emotional trauma. With the knowledge that violent injury is the strongest predictor of future violent injury, VIAP's mission is to assist victims of violence and their families to recover from physical and emotional trauma and empower them with skills, services, and opportunities so they may return to their communities, make positive changes in their lives, strengthen others who have been affected by violence, and contribute to building better communities.\n\nVIAP takes an innovative approach to holistic healthcare by utilizing a trauma-informed care model of service delivery. The innovation in this program is that the intervention with the patient begins in the hospital, providing a unique opportunity to support victims in a safe environment. Victims are paired with a case manager (Violence Intervention Advocate), a mental health clinician, and a family support advocate who, as a team, facilitate access to mental health, longer-term health care, and family support as needed. Victims are provided wrap-around case management services, and job and educational training that, in many cases, provide the impetus and guidance that they need to re-direct their lives and avoid future violence. VIAP services remain ongoing, in the hospital, in the victim and family's home, and in the community for a period ranging from a few weeks to a year or more, as needed by the individual.\n\nVIAP is a state and national leader in victims of violence advocacy efforts and is a founding member of The Health Alliance for Violence Intervention (HAVI). To heal communities affected by violence, The HAVI fosters hospital and community collaborations to advance equitable, trauma-informed care and violence intervention and prevention programs.\n\nProject Name: Managing Trauma in Corrections - A Demonstration Project\n\nAmount Requested: $921,520\n\nIntended Recipient: Roca, Inc.\n\nLocation: Chelsea, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: Managing Trauma in Corrections (MTC) is a Demonstration Project designed to address both the trauma faced by incarcerated individuals and the staff who are hired to work with them, helping to break the cycle of incarceration for our most heavily impacted residents. MTC will address a growing need across MA and nationally, appropriately, and effectively addressing not only sentenced but pre-trial populations in correctional institutions.\n\nRoca knows that many of the young people engaged in the criminal justice system have experienced significant trauma that ultimately impacts their behaviors. These young people will be unable to create sustained behavior change without addressing this trauma and building critical tools that will allow them to act differently. Roca's reentry model is designed to do just that. Roca's work will build on key evidence-based practices - prison visitation, cognitive behavioral theory, and restorative justice practices using peacemaking circles behind the walls. And, because we know that behavior change takes time and that the transition from incarceration to the community is a critical period that requires support, whenever possible, Roca will continue to engage young people in its nationally recognized Intervention Model, after release, for a period of up to four years. Over time, we know this combination of services will support long-term, sustained behavior change for even our most traumatized, high-risk emerging adults.\n\nFinally, because incarceration is a traumatic experience not only for those who are incarcerated but also for the staff who work with them, Roca will work with our correctional partners (as well as other correctional institutions across the Commonwealth) to provide their staff with the tools they need to manage their vicarious trauma, allowing them to better support themselves and their co-workers and serve the individuals in their custody, ultimately supporting long-term behavior change.\n\nProject Name: Marshfield Coastal Academy and Hazard Laboratory\n\nAmount Requested: $1,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Marshfield Chamber of Commerce, Marshfield Public Schools, Town of Marshfield, Northeastern University\n\nLocation: Marshfield, Plymouth County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Town of Marshfield, Marshfield Chamber of Commerce, Marshfield Public Schools, and Northeastern University propose to develop a technology hub and laboratory, the Marshfield Coastal Hazard Lab (MCHL) to study coastal hazard events and develop coastal hazard mitigation and construction solutions. This unique partnership between local government, community, local industry, and academia will drive technology, innovation, and partnership, thus promoting local economic development.\n\nProject Name: medVR Medical XR Longwood Accelerator Lab\n\nAmount Requested: $4,250,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Grassroots, Developer Education, Inc, Mass Ch 180 non-profit, 501 (c) 3 medVR Accelerator Lab\n\nLocation: Braintree, Norfolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The application in healthcare of immersive technology (commonly referred to as Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) is accelerating globally. The medVR immersive medical Accelerator Lab located in the Longwood medical area acts as a catalyst on top of the world-leading Massachusetts medical cluster. medVR will be a nexus between the Longwood medical experts, interdisciplinary technical teams, and resources to translate clinical ideas into products that improve patient health and hospital efficiency and keeps pace with the global competition. Longwood medical institutions have innovation departments but do not have product development staff. medVR will be the Longwood immersive product-development center.\n\nImmersive technology is included in the 10 strategic technologies in the Chips and Science Act because of its importance to the country. The most significant support for funding medVR is with Massachusetts leadership in NIH research funding since 1994. The state should lead this nationally important program in the immersive medical technology development segment.\n\nmedVR will bridge the medical and technical communities orchestrating product development, catalyzing growth in healthcare, and revitalizing the technical community with new technology challenges. Regional success depends on investment, hiring, and product development activity. This is often measured as an ecosystem. For example, looking back at the development of today's ubiquitous mobile platform, beginning with the iPhone in 2007, California, and Massachusetts, with rich technical clusters adopted, invested, hired, and built products early that created a mobile ecosystem, gaining a lead over the rest of the country and world. Similarly, by combining Massachusetts's significant medical and technical clusters, the medVR accelerator lab will contribute to the organic development of the medical immersive development ecosystem, spinout companies, large company development projects, and jobs. Funding medVR will maintain the Massachusetts medical cluster's leadership and create companies and jobs. During 2022, 17 companies received $281 Million in equity investments[i] but only one in Massachusetts due to an underdeveloped ecosystem and low investor familiarity. This proposal will correct this underrepresentation.\n\nmedVR's commitment to making patient populations used in studies representative of the communities will be an example to other fields.\n\nProject Name: NASA STEM Engagement at the EcoTarium\n\nAmount Requested: $856,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Worcester Natural History Society (EcoTarium)\n\nLocation: Worcester, Worcester County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: NASA STEM Engagement at the EcoTarium will create and deliver educational programs that provide youth and adults opportunities to discover and explore the scientific universe within and beyond our atmosphere. The project will bring updated scientific educational content to the full-dome planetarium, install an updated telescope in the outdoor observatory, and engage diverse groups of students in STEM learning and NASA's mission.\n\nProject Name: New England Aquarium\n\nAmount Requested: $3,500,000\n\nIntended Recipient: New England Aquarium Corporation\n\nLocation: Boston, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Aquarium's project updates two exhibits to better communicate the increasingly urgent need for ocean conservation action. By enhancing our ability to educate and inspire ocean conservation, NEAq can help to build a more informed and engaged public that is better equipped to act to protect our ocean and ensure its long-term sustainability. Updating these exhibits will ensure they continue to provide visitors with a meaningful and engaging learning experience. Funds will support the development of new educational interpretations, visitor interactions and engagements, conservation-based messaging, educational carts and other delivery techniques, and aquatic habitats that enhance animal wellbeing.\n\nProject Name: Nubian Ascends BATL Community Laboratory\n\nAmount Requested: $1,681,621.75\n\nIntended Recipient: Northeastern University\n\nLocation: Boston, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: This request will support the acquisition of state-of-the-art laboratory equipment for Northeastern University's Nubian Ascends Biopharmaceutical Analysis and Training Laboratory-located within the Nubian Ascends development project in Nubian Square-which will bring vital workforce development, training, and research opportunities to underserved populations in Roxbury.\n\nProject Name: Population Studies of Humpback Whales in Support of Modern Management Concerns\n\nAmount Requested: $200,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Center for Coastal Studies\n\nLocation: Provincetown, Barnstable County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The requested funding will provide much-needed support for the Center for Coastal Studies' Humpback Whale Research Program. In recent years, with the reduction of federal funding, the Center has raised support for its work through private donations and foundation grants which is no longer sustainable. In addition, there are now critical federal management issues and decisions that involve humpback whale populations for which federal financial support for key work like the Center's population studies is warranted.\n\nProject Name: Project Engage: Public Safety through Public Health\n\nAmount Requested: $1,447,795\n\nIntended Recipient: Project Engage: Public Safety through Public Health\n\nLocation: Boston, Suffolk County, MA\n\nProject Purpose: The Suffolk County Sheriff's Department's (SCSD), the goal is to transition an existing 700-bed secure facility in downtown Boston to a state-of-the-art model in the delivery of behavioral"
