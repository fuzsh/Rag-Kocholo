I drove mounds of bubble wrapped artwork in my Subaru to Plymouth for the Fairy Christmas on Thursday and then 25 more pieces to the Sturgis Library in Barnstable, Massachusetts (Cape Cod) yesterday. Both locations are about 25 miles from where I live, but in opposite directions. The Sturgis Library was constructed in 1644 for the Reverend John Lothrop, founder of Barnstable. The house, which forms the original part of the Library is the oldest building housing a public library in the United States. If you’re interested in this kind of historical stuff, read about it here.\n\nMy framed original illustrations from Pocketful of Posies are hung between the book stacks and displayed in 3 glass cases throughout the library.\n\nThe artwork will be in the library until Dec. 29th, 2012. I hope that some of you will get a chance to visit the library during December!"
