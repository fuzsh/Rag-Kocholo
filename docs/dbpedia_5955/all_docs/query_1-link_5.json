        "text": "Editor's note: Due to a write-in campaign, a race has emerged for the Precinct 6 Town Council seat. Hear from those candidates here.\n\nBarnstable's voters have some selections to make for the town's top governing board when they head to the polls for the town election on Nov. 7.\n\nAll 13 Town Council seats are up for election, but the ballot features races for just six of the positions. The contests are for the Council seats representing Precincts 1, 2, 5, 9, 11 and 12, with five incumbents facing challengers and one contest between two newcomers for the Precinct 9 seat Councilor Tracy Shaughnessy is vacating.\n\nWe asked the candidates on the ballot who are in races to share more information about themselves and answer a few questions. Below, read more about them.\n\nPrecinct 1\n\nIncumbent Gordon Starr is challenged by Paul Gage.\n\nGORDON STARRAge: 71Education: MS, curriculum; MS, readingEmployment: retired school teacher, Sturgis Library, part time, and close to full time as a town councilor.Civic Experience: Member of the Barnstable Energy Committee before being elected to the Town Council in 2019.Other community service: Mass Audubon Long Pasture Sanctuary, led field trips Barnstable Harbor Ecotour, naturalist\n\nCampaign website: www.starrbarnstable.comCampaign social media: Facebook — Gordon Starr for Town Council\n\nWhat motivates you to run for this office?\n\nI feel very connected to Precinct 1, having lived in Barnstable Village for 45 years. My wife Sherry and I built our house and raised our three children here. One of our daughters, an oyster farmer, still lives in Barnstable.\n\nI have gotten to know so many people over the last four years serving our precinct. I am curious and love the day-to-day learning and discussions about issues and solutions.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing the Town Council and how would you address them?\n\n1) Clean water. Eventually all of our drinking water will need to be treated; PFAS are becoming ubiquitous in the environment and EPA standards for drinking water are becoming stricter.\n\nIn the Barnstable Village Water District we have committed to building a new treatment plant. Our estuaries have become degraded from nitrogen loading. The surface of our bays may look scenic, but the habitats underwater have deteriorated.\n\nThe town-wide Sewer Plan (CWMP) is progressing but needs to be constantly reevaluated as technologies change.\n\n2) Housing. The dire need for a place for all of our residents to live has no easy fix. We are working to create as many tools as we can to increase housing.\n\nAccessory dwelling units should be encouraged and even incentivized. I will continue to fight for a higher percentage of affordable housing in larger developments.\n\nI want to continue working on these and the many other important challenges the town faces. The professional staff, the town manager and the town councilors work together continually for all of the residents of our town.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nI have the time, inclination, passion, persistence and energy to devote to the tasks at hand.\n\nPAUL GAGEAge: 60Education: B.S. Communications, Emerson CollegeEmployment: First job - Cape Cod Standard Times paperboy. Former director of operations at Songtime Radio, district supervisor for Boston Globe, director of alumni/parent relations at The Stony Brook School and account executive at Ocean 104 FM. From 1998 to present: Executive customer representative for Merck and Co., Inc. calling on cardiologists, psychologists, neurologists, pulmonologists, endocrinologists, nephrologists and primary care practitioners.Political Experience: Elected twice to the Barnstable Republican Town Committee.Other community service: Candy striper at Cape Cod Hospital (16), Faith Family Kitchen volunteer, volunteered with Toys for Tots, Cradles to Crayons, past deacon and Elder chair at Osterville Baptist Church, Osterville Village Day volunteer, Town of Barnstable Natural Resources and B.A.R.S. - volunteered to plant clam seeds.\n\nCampaign website: NoneCampaign social media: None\n\nWhat motivates you to run for this office?\n\nMy family has resided in Barnstable Village since 1969. All four of my children are Barnstable High School grads. Barnstable is a special place for all of us and, with seven grandchildren, I have a personal interest in stewarding the town for future generations. There are so many amazing people living and working in our community. Finally, what motivates me most is love of neighbors and friends.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing the Town Council and how would you address them?\n\nAffordable housing for Cape residents, next generation and veterans: A.D.U. and business/residential mixed-use properties are good starts. For young homeowners, the A.D.U.s may be an excellent way to help cover mortgage or could be used for multi-generational living.\n\nMaintaining/preserving and improving our harbors and beaches: These natural treasures are the reason people come here. Promoting a spirit of volunteerism and town pride (particularly in the next generation), we all can pitch in alongside municipal services to preserve and improve this treasure.\n\nDrug abuse and addiction, and sex trafficking. I applaud the work of the law enforcement sting in recent months. Education and awareness are key to exposing perpetrators. We need to stand with our police.\n\nWater runoff (clogged storm drains). We have systems in place that are neglected. Barnstable DPW does tremendous work; however, with miles of roads requiring constant maintenance, in some cases our DPW may be unaware of an issue. As citizens, that’s where we need to bring these to their attention.\n\nDangerous intersections with obstructed views; particularly the Oak Street, 6A and 132 intersection. On Oct. 15 there was another accident here. I suggest this would be a great spot for a mini roundabout.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nI grew up here in Barnstable, worked summers on Main Street Hyannis and the mid-Cape area (Piccadilly Deli, Gourmet Brunch, the Barnstable House and Cranberry Moose). My family and I have had times of struggle, early on we had to live in winter rentals moving each spring and fall. My wife and our first two children were born at Cape Cod Hospital (all delivered by the same doctor). Throughout my life God has provided, and I am grateful.\n\nPrecinct 2\n\nIncumbent Eric Steinhilber is challenged by Kristin Terkelsen.\n\nERIC STEINHILBERAge: 48Education: MBA, Master of Business Administration & BA, Political ScienceEmployment: Real Estate & non-profit sectorPolitical Experience: Barnstable Town CouncilorOther community service: Bluecoats of Barnstable, Hyannis Kiwanis, Barnstable Public SchoolsCampaign website: EricForBarnstable.comCampaign social media: NoneWhat motivates you to run for this office?I was born in Barnstable, grew up in Barnstable, graduated from Barnstable High, and now work and raise my kids, along with my wife, in Barnstable. It has always been home, and I want to ensure that our kids and grandkids are able to afford to stay, live and raise their kids here. I want to build on our progress and continue the work to protect Wequaquet Lake and our surrounding waters, lower the burden on our taxpayers, ensure safe communities and a thriving economy for our residents, and make Barnstable the best it possibly can be.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing the Town Council and how would you address them?As a Town Council, we have been able to increase the supply and protection of our drinking water and develop a wastewater management plan to protect our lakes and ponds.\n\nIn our Precinct, the health of the Wequaquet Lake is a main priority. I was able to save taxpayers by reducing the sewer assessment cost, attaining third party funding, and developing a variety of financing options. I will continue to block efforts to increase the assessment on residents or delay sewering, which will imperil the lake.\n\nIt has become extremely difficult for our kids and grandkids to stay in Barnstable. Without a $200,000 income to attain a mortgage or increased rental options, our families will not be able to stay on Cape. The lack of housing has depleted our police force, medical providers are unable to properly staff, schools are struggling to attract teachers, and small businesses are closing or limiting hours due to staff shortages.\n\nI am focused on continuing to create attainable homeownership and year-round rental opportunities to ensure our economy can continue to function and grow, our kids are able to stay here, and we can continue to have a safe community.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nExperience, knowledge of the complex issues we face, and the ability to find common-sense solutions. We are a town of 50,000 people with two coastlines, seven villages, eight schools, a regional commercial, medical, and transportation hub, the fourth largest road system in the state, and a budget of nearly $200 million.\n\nWe face difficult challenges, but I have delivered positive results — standing with taxpayers, leading on water quality, and advocating for our kids and a safe community. I thank the residents for their past support and for allowing me to serve and I humbly ask for their vote Nov. 7.\n\nDR. KRISTIN TERKELSENAge: 50Education: Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT), Masters of Science in Physical Therapy (MSPT), Bachelors in Science Sports Medicine (BSc)Employment: Owner, clinic director, Physical Therapy Solutions, since October 2009Political Experience: noneOther community service: every day I serve my community through my work as a PT and this means going beyond just treating a body part\n\nCampaign website: https://terkfor2.org/Campaign social media: Consciously choosing no social media\n\nWhat motivates you to run for this office?\n\nI was born and raised in this town and made a conscious decision and investment to return to Barnstable to live and open my business here. Over time I have seen our idyllic town change in negative ways and am concerned decisions in our town council will cause compounding irreparable damage going forward. I am moved to be part of the solutions rather than complain about the problems.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing the Town Council and how would you address them?\n\nThe Town Council should represent the interests of the residents and local business owners who make the town what it is, and what we want it to be. These are the most important considerations in deciding what will affect us long term — not outside financial interests and forces.\n\nIn solving the problems facing us, I advocate for listening to resident input, being open to debate and thinking of solutions from many angles, not from a monocular view. Allow residents to ask questions, then listen for answers and be respectful and engaged with our constituents, not dismissive.\n\nResidents who live and work here provide this town its wellness. Their voices and concerns are integral to decision making when there are issues in front of town council that impact the town long-term, like wind farm access, developing large open spaces and housing. If water quality is the issue, then marrying sewer installation with development and/or wind farm cables is inappropriate.\n\nOverdevelopment that does not provide long-term residential housing is not a positive gain for our town as a whole. Having clear goals and communication about the processes and implementation will go a long way. Accountability will help this town thrive.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nI bring the non-politician’s fresh viewpoint. I can hold both the positive of where we are, while safeguarding our town from decisions that will harm the character and health of the town of Barnstable, now and into the future.\n\nPrecinct 5\n\nIncumbent Paul Cusack is challenged by John Crow.\n\nPAUL CUSACKAge: 51 Education: Graduated from Georgetown University in 1996 with a Bachelor's Degree in Classical Languages. Graduated from Columbia University in 2017 with a Master's Degree in International Security Policy.Employment: Most recently was employed as a shell fisherman by the Cotuit Oyster Company, 2018-2022.Political Experience: One year incumbent as Barnstable Town Councilor for Precinct 5.Community service: Former Army Ranger with four combat deployments to Afghanistan. Hyannis Big Brothers Big Sisters 2017-2021.\n\nCampaign website: electpaulcusack.orgCampaign social media: https://www.facebook.com/cusack4ma/\n\nWhat motivates you to run for this office?\n\nI am running for re-election to protect and serve the people of Barnstable's 5th precinct. My campaign is dedicated to restoring some civility to the public sphere.\n\nTeamwork, collaboration and innovation will continue to be the calling cards of my time on the Council. I will be transparent and aggressive in pursuing a direction that strengthens our values and character, while steadfastly maintaining my belief that our villages' uniqueness is best expressed within the context of the town of Barnstable as a whole.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing the Town Council and how would you address them?\n\nI believe it is the nexus between our dire need for housing and the realization that our historical development patterns have put enormous pressures on our natural ecosystems.\n\nThe health and beauty of our local waters underwrite the value in most of our homes and experiences here. Without realistic and timely leadership, we will continue to place our most valuable assets — our homes, our waters — in jeopardy. My insatiable interest in preserving what nature has given us has been a part of my entire approach to solving current problems and is woven through all aspects of my professional life.\n\nThese housing and environmental issues cross boundaries and necessitate a personality and willingness to seek workable solutions in a timely way. I will hear out all the arguments and the questions and concerns of all constituents when pursuing our collective work. I will not however cave to special interests, nor allow excessive delaying tactics to block progress that has achieved a clear consensus.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nI have seen different kinds of combat, from being a U.S. Army Ranger to being a first responder at the Boston Marathon to my work on gang intervention programs. And I know Osterville and surrounding villages intimately. Until recently, I worked the local waters for years as a shell fisherman.\n\nFrom high level service in government to lying on my belly in Cotuit Bay, from combat in Afghanistan to helping kids in Watts avoid combat in their own neighborhoods, I have practical life skills and a commitment to public service that differentiates me from my competition for this seat.\n\nJOHN CROWAge: 64Education: B.A., Business/Economics, Muhlenberg College, Allentown, PAEmployment: Retired after a long career with Federal Express.Political Experience: None.Community service: Involved in the community through the Osterville Village Association for more than two decades. Elected to leadership roles for 17 years. Worked across our villages with leaders of other civic organizations on issues of mutual concern.\n\nCampaign website: John Crow for Barnstable Town Council (electjohncrow.com)Campaign social media: Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/people/Elect-John-Crow/61550995687537/?mibextid=LQQJ4d Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/johncrowprecinct5/\n\nWhat motivates you to run for this office?\n\nI’m strongly motivated to give voters a councilor who listens, who represents them, who speaks for them.\n\nI’m motivated to preserve for future generations what makes Cape Cod so unique by gratitude for those who have worked to do it for us. Let’s be deliberate in growth and respect the Cape’s character and environment as we work to meet residents’ and businesses’ evolving needs.\n\nI’m motivated to achieve a responsive-to-citizens, transparent town government. Example: the recent citizens’ petition on offshore wind projects. It should never be necessary for citizens to have to ask to be heard, to get straight answers.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing the Town Council and how would you address them?\n\n1. Sewering, alternative systems and straight talk. I support mitigating existing effluent problems by targeting sewer spending to areas of greatest need. I’ll encourage aggressive pursuit of alternative systems (for those who can afford them), which can reduce nitrogen 90%. I’ll give clear information and straight talk about who pays.\n\n2. Well-planned, affordable offshore wind power. I support environmentally suitable landings: at industrial sites, sites with existing substations, or an offshore grid — what the experts recommend, and which can save ratepayers over $1 billion. I am proud to be endorsed by Save Greater Dowses Beach.\n\n3. Sustainable, proactive housing solutions for locals and workers. I am in favor of addressing housing needs proactively to meet community needs, not just reacting to developers’ needs. I support redevelopment, ADUs, and returning some non-resident, investor-owned short-term rentals to housing for locals. It is time to prioritize locals and workers! I do not support the unelected Cape Cod Commission’s call to change single family zoning to dense development.\n\nI also believe our village libraries are a treasure. They deserve increased financial support from the Town of Barnstable.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nVoters have a right to be heard and to be represented. That’s how I’ll do the job: I’ll listen to constituents and represent them.\n\nRespectfully, we haven’t had that. For example, the incumbent published a deeply personal, 11-page letter parroting Avangrid’s plans to industrialize our town’s precious public assets. Another example: the Town Council sets the town’s course through a Strategic Plan. Councilors give directions on housing, finance, public safety, the environment, everything. The incumbent took part in two Council strategy sessions. He did not say one word. You can hear his silence on video.\n\nI will listen and represent.\n\nPrecinct 9\n\nCharlie Bloom and Michael Mecenas are competing for this seat. Incumbent Tracy Shaughnessy is not running.\n\nCHARLIE BLOOMAge: 73Education: Barnstable High School 1968, Boston College 1972, Boston University 1974Employment: Retired from 40-year career as a social worker (working with released Barnstable County offenders to prevent recidivism, DPW and DSS child abuse investigator, DMH Children’s Emergency Response, Hallgarth Institute outreach family therapist); and as a guidance counselor/SPED team chairperson with the Barnstable Public Schools (20 years of which was at Hyannis East Elementary serving the children of what is now Precinct 9).Political Experience: NoneCampaign website: www.precinct9bloom.comCampaign social media: None\n\nWhat motivates you to run for this office?\n\nI am concerned about the urbanization of Hyannis and zoning law complexities that give developers the upper hand to push through their projects.\n\nThe existence of zoning laws does not mean they are good for us. As a lifelong Hyannis resident, I feel the need to protect my village from policies that put developers in the driver’s seat. We need developers willing to take cues from us. This will not scare away developers. There will always be another developer. Let’s ensure it is a developer who will not threaten us with a 40B project if their initial plans are rejected.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing the Town Council and how would you address them?\n\nThere are so many important issues to address. Foremost, through consensus building, we can have a functioning Town Council with members who respect each other and are able to reach agreements that are good for the citizens of every precinct.\n\nMy entire career was one of building consensus. We need to have a vision for the future of Hyannis and the town. For example, we should have a plan for available spaces that come to market. We will be telling developers what we want and need, not just rubber stamping their plans for what they think is good for our town.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nMy opponent and I differ on issues surrounding urbanization. I am for affordable housing that is in keeping with the historic character of Hyannis, not for imposing residential edifices with inadequate parking, no open space for children to play, and higher density that raises issues with water and additional pollutants into our sewer system — and ultimately our environment — for which we have no treatment strategies at this time.\n\nWe can provide affordable housing and promote the attractive business opportunities we need using well-planned projects to help preserve the seaside village that is the foundation of our economy.\n\nMICHAEL MECENAS Age: 45Education: Mental health clinician, trilingual medical interpreter, holds a master's degree in social work - majored in human services concentration in clinical settings, experience with psychotherapy, trauma and human crisis.

An important part of maintaining that charm is ensuring our community remains accessible to people of all income levels.\n\nI am an advocate for attainable housing, which is crucial in ensuring sustainable town development. Housing is a basic need, and it's vital for our essential workforce — nurses, students, firefighters, police — as well as the homeless.\n\nWater and the environment. Water isn't just a resource, it's a lifeline. Access to safe and clean drinking water is fundamental. The preservation of our lakes and estuaries is about ensuring the longevity of this vital resource. I'm committed to supporting efforts to expand our wastewater infrastructure.\n\nI support a community-centric approach to education that emphasizes diversity. Training in schools can foster inclusivity and respect and address vital issues like mental health and drug addiction prevention among the youth. An informed youth is an empowered future.\n\nThe backbone of a safe community is its police force and first responders. Supporting them is paramount in crime reduction and in maintaining a sense of security in our neighborhoods. Safety is collective well-being.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nI’m a community leader and a proud volunteer. I have been doing the work and my actions prove it. I am younger, open minded and believe in unity.\n\nWhen I retire, I want to be proud of how much I contributed and not wait to do something when I’m retired.\n\nI’m a founder of a nonprofit organization that has serviced over 2,000 people since January. I have multilingual communication skills, so I will be able to communicate with those who don’t have a voice.\n\nI am ready to serve the community even more profoundly as a councilor for Precinct 9.\n\nPrecinct 11\n\nIncumbent Kristine Clark is challenged by Toby Leary.\n\nKRISTINE CLARKAge: 66Education: Springfield College, B.S. Environmental Studies, magna cum laudeEmployment: RetiredPolitical Experience: Incumbent town councilor; served on town committees: Shellfish Committee, Open Space Committee, Land Acquisition and Preservation Committee; Town Council liaison to various committees; involved on the board of directors of the West Barnstable Civic Association since 2001.

Board member and clerk for the Cape & Islands Municipal Leaders Association.Other community service: Past chair of the West Barnstable Village Festival Committee; volunteer since 1996.

On the kitchen team for monthly senior luncheons at Our Lady of Victory Parish until COVID.\n\nCampaign: www.precinct11clark.comCampaign social media: www.facebook.com/KrisClarkPrecinct11\n\nWhat motivates you to run for this office?\n\nMy husband and I moved to West Barnstable in 1983. Not being blessed with children, we are in a position to give back to our community and do our share of civic duty. Over the years, my husband and I have volunteered our time and resources to initiate new and facilitate traditional community events.\n\nI enjoy working with wonderful people and developing treasured relationships in West Barnstable. As Precinct 11 town councilor, I have worked hard to diligently research and thoroughly review Town Council agenda items to make the best, informed decisions for our village and the Town of Barnstable.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing the Town Council and how would you address them?\n\nSupporting the Comprehensive Wastewater Management Plan is important to me, being the most expensive project that the town has undertaken, spearheaded by past Town Councils. Managing and funding this massive effort is a high priority to maintain our quality of life and preserve estuarine habitat and property values.\n\nDrinking water quality and quantity are paramount for Barnstable’s residents. The town needs to be forward-thinking in planning for the town’s drinking water, not only for our current residents and tourists, but also for future needs.\n\nHousing for our residents is another front-burner issue, given that we address this at nearly each Town Council meeting. I continue to invest time to understand and vote on strategies to alleviate our housing crisis. I spent hours evaluating the Form Based Zoning proposed earlier this year and 10 amendments were attributed to me after an evaluation before the vote on this complex ordinance.\n\nThere are other strategies being considered to create more housing. But at the same time, the growth in short-term rentals has stripped some of our year-round housing stock, converting what used to be year-round housing to businesses operating as short-term vacation rentals in areas of our town zoned as residential.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nMy 40 years as a resident and community volunteer in West Barnstable distinguish me from the other candidate for Town Council from Precinct 11. I listen to the residents of West Barnstable. Having been a past employee of the town, I worked for the Natural Resources Division and had a first-hand experience with the declining quality of our estuaries and bays. Another cause for concern is our drinking water sources and I’ve been cognizant of the town’s plans for various options. I am not a gun owner, but I do respect those who own guns safely and legally.\n\nTOBY LEARYAge: 48Education: Cape Cod Tech Class of 1993, carpentry shopEmployment: Owner TL Fine Woodworking Inc. 20+ years, co-owner Cape Gun Works 9+ yearsPolitical Experience: N/AOther community service: Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce Membership Pillar\n\nCampaign website: electtobyleary.comCampaign social media: Facebook: @tobyleary X: @tobyleary\n\nWhat motivates you to run for this office?\n\nI promised myself over 20 years ago that I would run to give back to the town that I have lived in my entire adult life. I can help shape town policy through years of business experience and bring much-needed efficiency to town policy.\n\nI am willing to listen to those who I'll represent in West Barnstable and educate myself on all sides of issues. By implementing a conservative approach to finances, we can lower costs to the taxpayer, and stimulate new revenue to the town through a pro-business approach.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing the Town Council and how would you address it?\n\nWorkforce housing is the biggest issue facing the town right now. Our children and grandchildren can't afford to live here and workers are increasingly coming in from over the bridge.\n\nI would like to see opportunities created for home ownership and look at the state's 40Y starter home district ordinances, and CommonWealth Builder as some programs the town could take advantage of.\n\nI look forward to exploring mixed-use housing, relaxing zoning regulations, and accessory dwelling units as housing options. These options will lower housing costs for people starting out their careers and willing to put down roots here in Barnstable.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nI am pro-housing and support town efforts to lower costs and get creative about tackling the housing shortage.\n\nI want to help businesses develop a strong, viable workforce by being a town people want to set up in.\n\nI support reducing regulations wherever possible. I believe it is the government's job to stay out of people's lives as much as possible.\n\nI support preserving the conservation land the town has now, but not acquiring more. It is not a good policy to accumulate assets and take property off the tax rolls, resulting in town maintenance costs and less revenue.\n\nPrecinct 12\n\nIncumbent Paula Schnepp is challenged by Kyle Condinho.\n\nPAULA SCHNEPPAge: 63Education: B.A. Economics; M.A. Public PolicyEmployment: Executive director, Sandwich Housing AuthorityPolitical experience: Barnstable Town Council, 6 years; Barnstable Housing Authority, 16 yearsOther community service: Habitat for Humanity, NOAH Shelter, BHMPCS PTA (Past Pres.), Cape & Islands Municipal Leaders Association (Past Pres.)\n\nCampaign website: https://sites.google.com/view/electpaulatown/homeCampaign social media: facebook.com/ElectPaulaTown/\n\nWhy are you running and what most motivates you?\n\nWhen I ran for Council six years ago, our country had just experienced a divisive national election, and I believed that politics could and should be a collaborative process, not a polarized one.\n\nAlthough national politics haven't improved, I believe locally we can still find common ground. I remain committed to this task. I’ve enjoyed working with my dedicated colleagues on the Council, our talented, hard-working staff, and the many residents who serve either on committees, associations, and/or citizen groups — all trying to address the many challenges before us while making sure Barnstable remains the wonderful place it is.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues in Barnstable and how would you address them?\n\nFor me, there are two equally pressing issues in Barnstable: Protecting and improving the quality of our water and increasing the availability of housing options for all who live and work in Barnstable.\n\nTo address water quality, I’ll continue to advocate and support funding for the treatment of our lakes and ponds; support sewer expansion to improve our coastal waters, and support protection of our drinking water from emerging contaminants. We also need to consider alternatives to clean up our water. I support reconvening a water quality committee to facilitate this discussion.\n\nTo improve housing availability, I will continue to advocate for policies that provide more flexibility for housing across our community.\n\nIn 2021, the Council enacted one such policy by changing our zoning to allow Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) in all residential zoning districts. This change lets more of our seniors age in place while also creating low density housing units for younger, working households.\n\nOne final issue we cannot fail to address is the increasing impact of climate change: recent storms here show our vulnerability to a rapidly changing climate, and our need to ensure our existing infrastructure (primarily roads and stormwater drains) can be made more resilient.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nMy family and I have lived in Marstons Mills for over 27 years. We love walking the bogs, swimming in the ponds, visiting our beaches and enjoying the events in our villages during the summer and holidays.\n\nI’ve served the town for over 22 years, first as an elected housing commissioner, and now as Town Councilor for Precinct 12. I have both the passion and experience to ensure that we, on the Town Council, do everything to protect our natural resources, keep our roads and neighborhoods safe, and ensure that future generations can afford to live, work and play here.\n\nKYLE CONDINHOAge: 42Education: Barnstable High graduate, CCCC business classes Employment: Small business ownerPolitical experience: NoneCommunity service: Member of Marstons Mills Village Association, member of Liberty Hall\n\nCampaign website: NoneCampaign social media: None\n\nWhat motivates you to run for this office?\n\nBeing a lifelong resident, husband and father of three, I want to get involved with local issues that affect local people.\n\nThere are a few very important issues the town is facing right now that seem to go on without, or with very little, public knowledge and interaction. We need more transparency in local government. I don’t think we would be facing the situations we are if there was full transparency.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing the town council and how would you address them?\n\nDowses Beach is the biggest issue to me. We live in one of the most beautiful and sensitive areas in our country. This is an issue that stems from Town Council, and their failure to stand up to large corporations, and stand up for the residents of this town, in my opinion.\n\nWe have so many conservation rules and regulations that should protect our vital areas, as well as laws protecting public land, that somehow failed here under our current leadership.\n\nThe second biggest issue is affordable housing. This is a hard subject for me to say what is the best approach. Again, we live in a sensitive area where our water quality is failing, so adding more infrastructure doesn’t seem environmentally responsible to me, especially in sensitive areas. But I also understand the need for affordability for people to attain homeownership, as well as affordable housing — no easy solution, but with common sense debate and town involvement, it is attainable.\n\nWhat differentiates you from the other candidates?\n\nI believe that having no political ties, and only working on behalf of the people is what would make me a good councilor. I do not know my opponent well, so that is not directed towards her by any means. If I am elected councilor for precinct 12, I would rather reach out for advice on certain issues, as I believe we are a better community when we are open to working together.\n\nWhen and where is the Barnstable election?\n\nPolls on Election Day, Nov. 7, will be open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nPolling takes place in various locations according to precinct.
