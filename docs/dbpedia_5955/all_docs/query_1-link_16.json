The first of close to 20 oil spill emergency trailers arrived on Cape Cod July 5. Barnstable was the first to receive its trailer equipped with thousands of feet of boom materials, floats and anchors, absorbent pads, storm drain plugs, life vests and personal protective equipment.\n\nIs Buzzards Bay a pit stop or something else?\n\nBUZZARDS BAY - The company planning a Tedeschi’s convenience store at the former Quintal’s restaurant site at Scenic Highway has also filed plans for four gasoline pumps at the complex that will include a Dunkin’ Donuts shop. Plans filed by Chrisco LLC are under review by Bourne Planning Board member Dan Doucette. Gas pump plans for the site have already been rejected by selectmen, but that decision prompted an appeal, pending in Barnstable Superior Court.\n\nSelectmen tell dog owner to shape up\n\nFALMOUTH - A man whose two pit bulls have been deemed dangerous by the town of Falmouth must meet both short- and long-term conditions if he wants to get those animals back. In early June Falmouth selectmen conducted a hearing and found that Haze and Ochoa, two pit bulls owned by Steven Rose, had been involved in a number of incidents at 12 Royal Circle. On one occasion in October 2006, the older dog, Haze, allegedly bit someone on the property. Since that time, Haze and Ochoa have been kept by the town while the dogs were evaluated for their potential for rehabilitation.\n\nTriathlon returns to Surf Drive Beach Sunday\n\nFALMOUTH - After a two-season break in the action, the City Sports New England Triathlon Tour brings the popular Falmouth Sprint Triathlon back to Surf Drive Beach Sunday.
