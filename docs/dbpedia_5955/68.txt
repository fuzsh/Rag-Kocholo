BARNSTABLE – Ten incoming college freshmen were presented with scholarships Thursday by the Kraig Andre’ Diggs Scholarship Foundation.

The scholarships honor the late Kraig Diggs, who died in 2016.

Kraig’s parents, Carmen and Kip, presented the students with the scholarships at Liberty Hall in Marstons Mills.

Kraig Diggs was among four young men killed in a head-on crash on Route 495 in Middleboro in 2016. A wrong-way driver struck the vehicle in which Diggs and the others were riding.

This was the first year of scholarships provided by the foundation.

Kip Diggs wants to see this gift to the community grow every year.

“We really want to have kind of an alumni that’s going to continue,” Diggs explained.

“We want to pass the torch along. Like we’re doing to them, we want them to do for us.”

Both Carmen and Kip were appreciative of the support they have received from their community in creating the foundation. What started as just an idea, Kip explained, has now become a reality.

“It’s been a community. And when I say community, everybody that was a donor, sponsor, that knew Kraig, that helped volunteer, it’s all of us,” Diggs said.

The Kraig Andre’ Diggs Scholarship Foundation is also preparing for Kraig’s Dodgeball Tournament on September 28 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Barnstable High School, to benefit the scholarship fund.

The first tournament was held last year. For information on this year’s event, and to learn more about the foundation, visit kraigsdodgeballtournament.com.
