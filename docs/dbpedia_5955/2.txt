Capsule Movie Reviews

“The Age of Adaline” (romance, PG-13, 110 minutes, reviewed by Roger Moore, Tribune News Service). Building this “love that stands the test of time”-themed film around all the willowy, world-weary grace that Blake “Gossip Girl” Lively can muster pays off. As a twentysomething who stopped aging 80 years ago, Lively suggests several lifetimes of experience in a love story that ranges from wistful to hopeful, a romance whose female half understands its consequences. When Harrison Ford shows up for the third act, his affecting performance lifts this in ways we never see coming. *** ½

"Avengers: Age of Ultron" (superhero action, PG-13, 142 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and the rest are back in a giant superhero adventure that's sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe. ***1/2

"Clouds of Sils Maria": (drama, R, 124 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). An expertly filmed insider's look at the film business, the trappings of fame and the unstoppable, sometimes bone-chilling march of time. It's rare when a film has three robust, deeply drawn female characters — and Juliette Binoche, Chloe Grace Moretz and Kristen Stewart deliver memorable, nuanced performances. ***½

"Ex Machina": (sci-fi drama, R, 108 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). If you're going to go all-in with the gorgeous, chilling and sometimes ludicrous "Ex Machina," you'll have to check your logic at the ticket counter. Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson star in a dizzyingly effective sci-fi/thriller. ***½

“Furious 7”: (action, R, 137 minutes, reviewed by Cary Darling, Fort Worth Star-Telegram): This newest model in the careening yet indestructible “Fast & Furious” franchise may be the best in the line. Director James Wan brings a revved-up sense of energy and kinetic choreography, with many good action scenes. That all helps when working with material that’s as dimwitted as drywall and loud as a Texas thunderstorm. This film starts with the main characters getting on with their lives, but trouble won’t leave them alone and they have to get back together for one more mission. That includes Paul Walker, who died before completing the film. His brothers and CGI (computer-generated imagery) were combined to digitally re-magine him in certain scenes, and while it sounds crass, the process never appears obvious or fake. ****

"Home": (animated adventure, PG, 96 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). A little Jim Parsons goes a long way, and he grates on your nerves voicing an alien on the run with a smart seventh-grader (Rihanna). Kids will probably enjoy the colors and the music, but anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. **

"Hot Pursuit": (comedy, PG-13, 87 minutes, reviewed by Moore): Cheap, short and slow, this comedy never lets you forget that pairing up Sofia Vergara as the wife of a drug lord’s accountant, with Oscar-winning Reese Witherspoon, as the comically disgraced cop who escorts her to court, should have worked better than this. A mismatch-misfire badly misdirected, it wastes the the two in what is “Midnight Run” without enough running, “The Heat” without any heat. Vergara may play variations of a “type” in film and on TV (“Modern Family”) but NOBODY has every played this type funnier. But the two pros are left starving for funnier lines and situations. *1/2

"Mad Max: Fury Road": (action, R, 120 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron make one of the best action duos ever in a stunningly effective post-apocalyptic fable, a chilling and yet exhilarating daytime nightmare that also contains a surprising amount of depth and character development. ****

“Monkey Kingdom”: (nature documentary, G, 81 minutes, reviewed by Moore). This latest Disneynature Earth Day offering is an intriguing peek inside the social structure of Macaque monkey society in Sri Lanka. So while this Tina Fey-narrated film has got plenty of cute Macaque monkeys, playing and cavorting, there’s also a little social commentary in the mirror the monkey movie holds up to us. Kids may not get all of that, but they may be bothered by the violence among the animals. ***

“Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2”: (comedy, PG, 94 minutes, reviewed by Moore). The fat jokes just keep coming in this Kevin James-starring sequel, but the theater echoes with the sounds …of silence. This movie falls flat, and every joke and sight gag built around a clueless plump lump has a “just grind through it” quality. Blart has married and had a quickie divorce since “Mall Cop 1,” and here, he and zaftig daughter Maya visit Las Vegas for a “fake cop” convention. *

“Pitch Perfect 2”: (musical comedy, PG-13, 115 minutes, reviewed by Moore). The”Glee” phenomenon, with its four-part harmony covers of pop hits, has run its course. So while the jokes often land and the music is still perfectly in tune, the novelty’s gone from this sequel to the 2012 surprise hit that brought attention to Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson. With the college singers trying to move to world competition, this is a longer movie that feels both overfamiliar and “new but not improved.” **

"Woman in Gold" (Historical drama, PG-13, 110 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Helen Mirren stars as an American from Vienna fighting to reclaim a Gustav Klimt painting of her aunt that had been seized by the Nazis. This fictionalization of a true story is shamelessly sentimental, but fascinating nonetheless, beautifully photographed and greatly elevated by Mirren's brilliant performance. ***
