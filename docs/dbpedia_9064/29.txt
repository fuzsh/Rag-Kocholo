The East Orange (NJ) trio of Naughty by Nature consists of lead rapper Treach, rapper Vin Rock and DJ/producer Kay Gee. Their self-titled album is the first by the group as Naughty by Nature, as their previous album, Independent Leaders, was released under the name The New Style. The group was mentored by fellow New Jersey native Queen Latifah and subsequently changed their name to Naughty By Nature. Naughty by Nature was a critical and commercial success, being certified platinum on February 6, 1992, thanks in large part to the smash single "O.P.P.", which peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1991. Additional singles were "Everything's Gonna Be Alright" and "Uptown Anthem", which were both minor hits on the Billboard charts. "Uptown Anthem" was featured in the film Juice in 1992, and subsequently appeared on the film's soundtrack and is now included in the streaming versions of Naughty's LP. The success of "O.P.P." outshined the fact that Naughty By Nature released a classic album with some deep album cuts. "Yoke The Joker," "Guard Your Grill," the Queen-Latifah assisted "Wickedest Man Alive," and more, all serve to give the album a lot of replay value, even in 2019. I do not recommend you revisit Independent Leaders, but much love to Queen Latifah for seeing SOMETHING in that release that helped us get one of the best MCs in hip-hop history in Treach. Naughty By Nature was released on September 3, 1991. Revisit it...
