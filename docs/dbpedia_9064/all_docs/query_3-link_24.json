        "text": "(back when Treach wore the crown)\n\nRap fans have the shortest memories. A year in Rap is a decade in any other genre. I’ve written about it several times and test younger fans by asking them to name five popular rappers from ten years ago — then I name some and jar their memory. The concept hits home when I mention Lil Wayne, The once self-proclaimed “Greatest Rapper Alive.” Most of them know nothing of “The Wickedest Man Alive,” Treach.\n\nAnd that’s why I put little stock into many of these so-called Rap historians and data stat mongers. Leave it up to them our history will be reduced to a few names: Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, KRS, Tupac, & Biggie.\n\nThat narrative is void of the nuance and context from which most of our favorites have emerged. If you eliminate the large swath of rappers, the styles popular at the time, and what affect that competition has on an artist, you miss the spirit of the culture.\n\nBefore Treach, Vin Rock, and Kay Gee were Naughty by Nature they were the New Style signed to Bon Ami bka Sugar Hill Records. You can find that album on YouTube. Treach recalled on Drink Champs how he was ready to violently force the group off the label due to lack of royalties but I’m sure the greater emotion was disappointment.\n\n“Scuffin Those Knees” had the noise that was prominent between 87–89, Kay Gee’s cuts were nice, the rhymes were aight, but if they had a video, I never seen it, and if it was popular, that popularity didn’t leave the Tri-State area.\n\nYou can hear the beginnings of Treach’s style on this album, check “Start Smokin” (on songs like “Picture Perfect” and “Can’t Win For Losing” I can still hear Big Daddy Kane-isms). Naughty had to be disappointed, they got zero promotions and the album was left for dead.\n\nTreach went back to hustling and took on a non-descript uniform to avoid attention. Gone were the flashy outfits of the day, in came the “Timber boots and jail suits,” and also enter Treach’s own flow.\n\nYou hear “OPP” and he’s like a different man. I liked the song. I recall me and Sayyed Munajj trying to figure out where Naughty by Nature was from. I thought it was a one-off single. Besides, there was Main Source, then Tribe, then Ice Cube, and only so many hours in the day. Then came “Uptown Anthem.” Yup, the Juice Soundtrack giveth again. But the Hip Hop gods taketh away.\n\nI ain’t buy Naughty by Nature until I bought House of Pain and Cypress Hill. I explained how House of Pain and Cypress connected, but the way East Orange’s own fit into that mix because they were a part of a new breed of what people were calling “Hardcore Rap.”\n\nPerhaps you recall, back then there was so-called “Gangsta Rap,” there was “Bass Music,” “Commercial Rap,” and then everything else. We separated what we called “Hard” from “Soft” based on how the beat hit.\n\n“Hardcore Rap” changed that. Now, rappers were kicking people’s ass on record, gun models were introduced, and “reality” was celebrated. Cypress Hill had some Hardcore songs but that wasn’t the crux of who they were. Neither was House of Pain. Naughty excelled at it. I dubbed it “Ass Kick Music” and it was what I listened to when I wasn’t running Diamond D’s album into the ground.\n\n“Everything’s Gonna be Alright/Ghetto Bastard” didn’t move me when I first saw the video, but in the context of the album, it became one of my favorite songs — the sentiment of “say something positive, well positive ain’t where I live” resonated with me, the song now became a part of a greater theme — rising out of shitty conditions, finding success, and staying the same. That theme would become a Rap mainstay.\n\nAnd for the next few years, Treach was on everyone’s Greatest MC list. Where once he sounded like Kane, now rappers were imitating him. You can hear it in most New Jersey rappers of the day that weren’t Redman. Lords of the Underground, Fugees, Artifacts, you name em. Treach became a sex symbol, hosted shows like The Source All-Access, and was one of the most respected MCs. Nowadays, I hardly hear people mention him. Rap fans have such short memories."
