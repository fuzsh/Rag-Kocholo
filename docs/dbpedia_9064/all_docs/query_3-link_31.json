        "text": "Earlier Wednesday, I had the opportunity to sit down with one of the most revered hip-hop groups in the history of the culture, Naughty by Nature.\n\nAlthough Naughty by Nature are celebrated for their chart-topping hits, they have never been mistaken for a hip-pop hit factory by anyone who has been listening. Throughout their career, they have coupled infectious hits with contemplative tunes that address their background from the tough streets of East Orange, N.J.\n\nFrom the moment Naughty stopped by our studios, it was clear why they have remained so successful 25 years into their career. They were kind, humble and honored to bring their story to The Current's listeners. It was amazing to hear about their early years working under the management company that Queen Latifah led in the late '80s and early '90s. It was also amazing to dig deep into DJ Kay Gee's relationship with Minnesota: Kay Gee produced \"Close,\" the biggest hit for Minnesota R&B sensation, Next. Finding out about Kay Gee's dedication to finding new talent by wading through a sea of demo tapes speaks volumes to his longevity in the game.\n\nI encourage you to click the audio player above to hear a conversation with one of the greatest hip-hop groups of all time."
