Performing all of their greatest hits along with new material from their upcoming album, Anthem Inc. Naughty By Nature are back in business.\n\nHip Hop Kings, Naughty By Nature are teaming up again for their 20th Anniversary Tour. Performing all of their greatest hits along with new material from their upcoming album, Anthem Inc. Naughty By Nature are back in business.\n\nFormed in 1986 while the boys were still in high school this Grammy Award winning, platinum-album selling, New Jersey super-group began by performing at talent shows. They were discovered by Queen Latifah who signed the group to her management company and helped them land a record deal with Tommy Boy Records.\n\nIn 1991 Naughty by Nature’s self-titled debut album produced their first top ten hit, O.P.P. They went on to produce a number of albums with 19 Naughty III (1993) going platinum and Poverty’s Paradise (1995) recieving a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. Naughty By Nature then dissapeard on a recording hiatus of several years but have now returned with their undeniably classic, hand-raising, life affirming, HipHop music and a new album.\n\nDespite a number of unsuccessful album releases in the ninties and some trouble with the authorities Naughty By Nature’s master lyricist Treach says “We wouldn’t have reunited if we didn’t think we could give people that authentic Naughty feeling.” The band claims that their new album Anthem Inc will “take you back…we’ve invented a new sound, a bunch of new flows and after being without an album for so long, we’ve got a lot of things to say”.\n\nNaughty By Nature fans, gear up for what is promised to be one hell of a ride on Saturday April 30 at Chelsea Heights Hotel, Chelsea."
