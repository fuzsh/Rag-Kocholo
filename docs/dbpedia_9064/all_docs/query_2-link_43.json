He wrote Do you know.\n\nI was under the impression he played a part in producing the the song O.P.P by Naughty by Nature considering a Jackson 5 song is sampled, and the beat is exactly the same in 'Do You Know Where your Children Are' as in this song.\n\nThe drum break used in both songs is a very common sample. Michael sampled the break for DYKWYCA, just as Naughty By Nature did for OPP (along with the ABC sample).\n\nIndeed, one of those tracks that was sampled to death during hip hop's golden age. And not just that break either, when I listened to the clip just now De La Soul's Potholes in my Lawn and Redman's Jam 4 U came to mind which sample different parts of the song (listening to the latter now for the first time in ages, great track).\n\nSome other tracks that sample it (there are literally tons more):"
