        "text": "Formed of high school MCs Treach (Anthony Criss) and Vinnie (Vincent Brown) and DJ Kay Gee (Keir Gist), the hip hop group originally performed under the name New Style. After playing a number of live gigs and talent shows, the trio were discovered by Queen Latifah, who signed the group to her management company and secured a record deal with Tommy Boy Records.\n\nThe group’s debut eponymously-titled album arrived in 1991, spawning the utterly infectious Top Ten hit “O.P.P.” which sampled Jackson 5’s “ABC”. The single earned the group significant esteem as they were able to walk the fine line between maintaining their ghetto reputation in the underground and producing catchy anthemic funk for the mainstream. Treach, along with being a more than capable lyrical wordsmith, also turned his hand to acting, making appearances in the films “The Meteor Man”, Who’s the Man?” and “Jason’s Lyric”.\n\nLike its predecessor, Naughty by Nature’s sophomore release “19 Naughty III” in 1993 was praised to the rafters by fans and similarly went platinum. The album produced the hit “Hip Hop Hooray”, known for its inescapable “Hey, Ho” chant; the single became synonymous with the era’s style of hip hop. The group’s follow-up album “Poverty’s Paradise” in 1995 earned a Grammy for Best Rap Album despite the lack of hit singles and marked the group’s departure from Tommy Boy Records.\n\nA hiatus ensued with Treach landing a role in the HBO prison drama “Oz” and DJ Kay Gee, focusing on his production work for the likes of Zhané, Aaliyah and Next to name a few. In 1999 Naughty by Nature returned with the album “10 Naughty Nine: Nature’s Fury” and produced the sizeable hit “Jamboree” featuring Zhané. Kay Gee officially departed the group after the release to focus on his production work, and subsequently the duo singed with TVT. The group went on to release the album “IIcons” in 2002 successfully sustaining their career into the new millennium."
