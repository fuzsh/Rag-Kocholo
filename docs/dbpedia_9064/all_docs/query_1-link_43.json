        "text": "Treach of Naughty by Nature has made clear that he doesn’t always see eye-to-eye with his former group members — but, according to him, that’s not why they didn’t perform at this year’s BET Awards.\n\nTMZ caught up with the “Hip Hop Hooray” MC on Saturday (July 8), where he shared some more details about why being fractured as a group isn’t as bad as it sounds on the surface.\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\n“We were invited with the other members,” he explained to the outlet. “But they had some scheduling difficulties. So, we tried to make it happen. But I’m holding it down.”\n\nHe continued: “They’re doing their thing, and I’m gonna keep the brand poppin’ over here. So, you know. We’ll see what happens in the future, but right now, it’s Naughty down, this brand down, for the 50th.”\n\nNo matter what incarnation of Naughty by Nature fans see, Treach is going to continue to make music, as he recently demonstrated when he popped up on Coolio’s second posthumous single.\n\n“A Star Is Born,” which dropped on Friday (July 7), will appear on the rapper’s posthumous album LONG LIVE COOLIO, and serves as the follow-up to “TAG ‘You It’” featuring Too $hort which dropped back in March.\n\nLONG LIVE COOLIO will be the “Gangsta’s Paradise” rapper’s first LP since his 2009 offering From the Bottom 2 the Top — and it will also be his last.\n\n“It takes time for a star to develop and shine,” DJ Wino said of the new track. “Coolio was known for his hairstyle and rhymes, Coolio’s star will continue to shine until the end of time.”\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nTreach added: “Coolio’s music transcends time and space. His unique style and sound has left an indelible mark on Hip Hop. He’s a true pioneer and a legend in his own right.”\n\nCoolio died at the age of 59 from a fentanyl overdose on September 28, 2022, after he was discovered unconscious inside a friend’s home in Los Angeles.\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING..."
