Both albums 19 Naughty IIIÂ (with hit single âHip Hop Hoorayâ) and Povertyâs Paradise (Grammy Award for Best Rap Album in 1996) reached #1 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Charts.\n\nâI have been a soccer fan for a long time and am beyond excited to participate in this incredible night for MLS,â said DJ Skribble. âSee everyone on August 26!â\n\nDJ Skribble has become renowned across generations, and in high-regard in todayâs music world.
