        "text": "Near the Syrian border on Monday, coalition forces tracked down and confronted suspected members of al Qaeda in Iraq, the U.S. military said. The fighting, which included a U.S. airstrike, killed 12 militants and injured a 6-year-old girl, the military said. Six coalition soldiers also were wounded, it said, without specifying their nationalities.\n\nAl-Jaafari had promised to form a government that would win over the Sunnis, but members of his Shiite-dominated alliance rejected candidates with ties to Saddam's brutal regime.\n\nAfter months of wrangling following the historic election of the National Assembly on Jan. 30, al-Jaafari negotiated a 37-member Cabinet that so far includes 15 Shiite Arab ministers, seven Kurds, four Sunnis and one Christian. Two of the four deputy prime ministers were also sworn in Tuesday, a Shiite and a Kurd.\n\nPresident Jalal Talabani wished the new Cabinet well in its historic task: \"To achieve a unified democratic Iraq.\"\n\nUnderscoring lingering divisions, however, many lawmakers stayed away from the ceremony, which took place in a half-empty hall inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone. They included Vice President Ghazi al-Yawer, a Sunni leader and one of two vice presidents, who earlier complained not enough Sunnis were included in the new government.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, a secular Shiite whose caretaker government took charge of the country while al-Jaafari struggled to form his Cabinet, was also absent. His office said he was out of the country, but declined to specify where.\n\nThe new government will hold it's first meeting within days, al-Jaafari said.\n\nThe attacks are blamed on an insurgency believed largely made up of members of Iraq's Sunni minority, who dominated for decades under Saddam Hussein but were excluded from meaningful positions in the partial Cabinet that took office.\n\nAn aide to al-Jaafari, Laith Kuba, said earlier the prime minister had picked people to fill six of the seven vacant Cabinet positions. He said the names were discussed with Talabani and his two vice presidents, who must sign off on them before they are submitted to parliament for a vote.\n\nOn Sunday, Kurdish factions agreed to give up one of their ministries to meet the Sunnis' demands, said Azad Junduiani, spokesman for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of two main Kurdish parties.\n\nBut an official from the same party, Fouad Massoum, disputed that. He said Kurdish leaders would not accept a Sunni Arab in the human rights ministry, which is being temporarily lead by a Kurd.\n\nSalih al-Mutlag, head of the National Dialogue Council, a coalition of 10 Sunni factions, identified the Sunni deputy prime minister as Abid Mutlag al-Jubouri, a former major general in Saddam's army. He said three candidates were being discussed for defense minister: Hamid Obeid and Ahmed al-Rikan, both former generals under Saddam, and Mohammed Hassan Dalwa."
