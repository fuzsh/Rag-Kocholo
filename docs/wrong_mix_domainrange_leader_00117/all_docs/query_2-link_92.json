        "text": "In a report on its ad hoc visit to Greece, which took place from 21 November to 1 December 2023, published together with the response of the Greek authorities, the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) once again urges the Greek authorities to improve the conditions in the country’s immigration detention facilities, and especially the newly-built and EU-funded centres on the Aegean islands, while ensuring that foreign nationals are treated both with dignity and humanity (see the executive summary of the report in English or in Greek)\n\nThe main objective of the November 2023 visit to Greece was to examine the treatment of foreign nationals deprived of their liberty under immigration legislation in pre-removal detention centres, in police and border guard stations and in the newly built Closed Controlled Access Centres on the Aegean Islands of Lesvos, Kos and Samos.\n\nDuring the visit, the CPT again received several credible and consistent allegations of deliberate physical ill-treatment of detained foreign nationals by police officers in certain police stations in Athens and in the pre-removal detention centres of Amygdaleza, Corinth and Tavros (Petrou Ralli).\n\nFurther, foreign nationals continue to be held in poor conditions of detention. This is the case for several police stations which are inappropriate for stays exceeding 24 hours.\n\nThe CPT is also critical of the new EU-funded Closed Controlled Access Centres on the Aegean Islands. At the time of the visit, these centres did not meet the basic reception and protection needs of applicants for international protection. A great number of persons remained there deprived of their liberty way beyond the time limits provided by law and without benefiting from the legal safeguards related to detention, including access to a lawyer and interpreters. The living conditions for many of the persons met by the CPT could only be described as inhuman and degrading, especially at the centres of Kos and Samos.\n\nFurther, the CPT considers that the excessive security and unnecessary barbed wire fencing make these centres unsuitable for accommodating children and persons in a situation of vulnerability.\n\nThe CPT again received many consistent and credible allegations of informal, often violent, forcible removals of foreign nationals across the Evros river or at sea to Türkiye (pushbacks). This occurred without consideration of their individual circumstances, vulnerabilities or protection needs as well as the risk of ill-treatment when pushed back.\n\nIn their response, the Greek authorities underline that the conditions of detention of foreign nationals in the country’s police stations and pre-removal detention centres are in line with international standards and that large-scale renovation works are being planned in three detention centres.\n\nPress release\n\nAnti-torture Committee again calls on Greece to reform its immigration detention system and stop pushbacks"
