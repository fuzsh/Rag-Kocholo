The Chinese side will continue to support Iraq in its efforts to combat terrorism and safeguard its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. China is willing to actively participate in the economic reconstruction of Iraq and provide assistance within its due capacity. China and Iraq have established a strategic partnership with mutual trust. The Chinese side appreciated the Iraqi side for supporting the \"Belt and Road\" initiative, and is ready to make joint efforts to effectively implement the cooperation documents signed by both sides.\n\nIbrahim al-Jaafari expressed that the Iraqi side thanked the Chinese side for its support and assistance for Iraq's efforts in combating terrorism. The Iraqi government forces have entered the terminal phase of the battle to liberate Mosul and will win the victory before long. The Iraqi side hopes that the international community including China can continue to provide more aids for Iraq to fight against the Islamic States. Iraq looks forward to China's active participation in the post-war economic reconstruction of Iraq, in a bid to achieve an early recovery of national stability and development."
