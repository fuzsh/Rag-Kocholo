        "text": "On September 27, 2014, Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.\n\nWang Yi said that Iraq has recently formed a new government, which represents an important step forward in the political process of Iraq. We believe that the new Iraqi government will pool the strengths of all factions, restore security and social order as soon as possible, lead its people to realize national stability and development and work with the international community to crack down on terrorism. As the friend of Iraq, China will continue to provide the Iraqi side with what it needs, including the emergency humanitarian assistance. China is grateful for the efforts made by the Iraqi side to protect Chinese personnel and institutions in Iraq. We hope that the Iraqi side will continue with its concrete measures to ensure the security of Chinese personnel and institutions there.\n\nJaafari said that Iraq and China respect and trust each other, and bilateral relations are in a good state. The Iraqi side attaches great importance to the responsible role played by China in international affairs and thanks China for its support in the peaceful reconstruction, political transition and anti-terrorism campaign in Iraq. It is hoped that China will continue to do so. The Iraqi side will do all that it can to protect Chinese personnel and institutions there."
