        "text": "Konstantinos Karamanlis (born February 23 [March 8, New Style], 1907, Próti, near Sérrai, Ottoman Empire [now in Greece]—died April 23, 1998, Athens, Greece) was a Greek statesman who was prime minister from 1955 to 1963 and again from 1974 to 1980. He then served as president from 1980 to 1985 and from 1990 to 1995. Karamanlis gave Greece competent government and political stability while his conservative economic policies stimulated economic growth. In 1974–75 he successfully restored democracy and constitutional government in Greece after the rule of a military junta there had collapsed.\n\nThe eldest of seven children of a poor schoolteacher, Karamanlis was able, with the help of local benefactors, to attend secondary school and the University of Athens. He received a law degree in 1932 and practiced law in Athens (Modern Greek: Athína). Launched into politics by the Populist Party, he was elected to Parliament in 1935 for Sérrai (Sérres), which continued to reelect him. In 1946 he was appointed minister of labour, and over the next nine years he held a string of cabinet posts in successive right-wing governments, earning a reputation for drive and efficiency in his efforts to aid Greek refugees and rebuild the war-torn economy. Karamanlis joined the conservative Greek Rally party in 1950, and, when Prime Minister Alexandros Papagos died in October 1955 and the party was unable to decide on a successor, King Paul chose Karamanlis as prime minister.\n\nKaramanlis formed not only his government but also his own party, the National Radical Union (ERE), which in parliamentary elections in February 1956 obtained 161 seats out of 300. He retained a parliamentary majority in elections held in 1958 and 1961. As prime minister, Karamanlis helped Greece make a dramatic economic recovery from the devastation of World War II and the ensuing civil war (1946–49). With American aid, he achieved rapid economic growth and greatly expanded Greece’s fledgling industrial sector.\n\nIn foreign affairs, he improved Greece’s relations with Yugoslavia, but those with Turkey and Great Britain remained strained because of the issue of tensions between the ethnic Greek majority and the Turkish minority on Cyprus, which was then under British rule. In order to restore friendly relations with the NATO powers, Karamanlis decided to disentangle the awkward Cyprus problem by establishing an independent republic on the island, an action taken, with the agreement of Turkey and Great Britain, in 1960.\n\nIn June 1963 Karamanlis resigned after a dispute with King Paul over the respective powers of the monarchy and the government. Shortly afterward he left Greece to live in Paris, where he remained while his country was ruled by the military (1967–74). During these years he repeatedly called for the military junta to resign but did not otherwise actively oppose the regime.\n\nOn July 24, 1974, after the fall of the military junta, Karamanlis was recalled to Athens as prime minister of an emergency government. He demanded and obtained the subordination of the armed forces to civilian authority, reinstated the constitution, and averted a catastrophic war with Turkey over Cyprus without loss of prestige. In parliamentary elections held in November that year, his New Democracy Party won 220 of 300 seats. In June 1975 Karamanlis obtained the adoption of a new constitution that strengthened the powers of the presidency, which had largely been a ceremonial office. In December 1975 he held a referendum in which the people voted to abolish the Greek monarchy."
