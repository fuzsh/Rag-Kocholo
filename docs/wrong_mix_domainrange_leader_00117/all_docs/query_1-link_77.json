        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Top Shiite politicians met at a heavily fortified building on Tuesday to choose between conservative interim vice president Ibrahim al-Jaafari and secular Shiite Ahmad Chalabi as their candidate to be Iraq’s next prime minister.\n\nIf they fail to reach a decision — and so far neither al-Jaafari nor Chalabi have shown any signs of backing down — leaders of the clergy-backed United Iraqi Alliance will hold a secret ballot later Tuesday to decide the issue, said alliance member Ali al-Hashim.\n\n“We will do our best to select one today,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, two explosions echoed through the Iraqi capital at midday. A small plume of black smoke could be seen rising above the Green Zone, where Iraqi government offices and the U.S. Embassy are located.\n\nPolice Capt. Muthanna Hassan said one of the blasts was a car bomb that exploded as an Iraqi special forces convoy passed by, killing two soldiers and wounding 20 others. It was not clear what caused the other blast.\n\nIn western Baghdad, masked gunmen hurled explosives into a Shiite mosque in the Ghazaliyah neighborhood, police Capt. Sa’ad Jawad Kadhim said. The explosives failed to detonate and guards opened fire on the attackers, killing one and forcing the rest to flee, Kadhim said.\n\nAlso in Baghdad, Iraqi police foiled a suicide bombing attempt, arresting a Sudanese man who tried to detonate an explosive-laden belt inside the Adnan Khair Allah hospital in the north of the city, Interior Ministry Capt. Ahmed Ismael said.\n\nIt was apparently the second suicide mission involving a Sudanese. At least one man believed to be of Sudanese origin carried out a suicide bombing Saturday in Baghdad, part of a wave of violence across the country that killed 55 people on Ashoura, the holiest day of the Shiite calendar.\n\nAlso in the capital, a U.S. military convoy was hit in a roadside bomb attack in the southern neighborhood of Doura, police Lt. Haitham Abdul Razak said.\n\nElsewhere Tuesday, U.S. troops exchanged fire with gunmen in Samarra, 60 miles north of the capital. One Iraqi was killed in a mortar strike there, said Dr. Aala al-Deen Mohammed.\n\nThe violence, typical of recent months in Iraq, comes as Shiites prepare to take power there for the first time in modern history.\n\nThe Shiite alliance won 140 seats in the 275-seat National Assembly in Jan. 30 elections, and a two-thirds majority, or 182 seats, is needed to confirm a prime minister. That means the alliance will need to strike a deal with smaller parties to form the next government after choosing its candidate.\n\nAbout two dozen top Shiite politicians were meeting at the Baghdad headquarters of the leader of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. Shiite politicians have been negotiating to decide their candidate for days.\n\nChalabi spokesman Haidar al-Moussawi said Monday that the most powerful man in predominantly Shiite Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, met with interim Finance Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi in the southern city of Najaf on Tuesday and gave his backing for whatever decision the alliance makes.\n\n“Al-Sistani assured that whoever the alliance will choose, he will agree on him,” al-Moussawi said.\n\nAlthough supporters of Chalabi, who was once known for his ties with Washington, claim he had the support needed for the nomination, the vote between the two 58-year-old men was anything but a sure thing.\n\nThe Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, the main group making up the alliance, had tried to persuade Chalabi to quit the race, some of its senior officials said.\n\n“We had hoped that we would agree on one person without the secret ballot, because we fear that such a vote will cause divisions inside the alliance,” said Jawad Mohammed Taqi, a senior member of the group, known as SCIRI.\n\nHe added that “Chalabi seems very confident and he believes that when we hold a secret ballot he will get the majority. I believe this is an exaggeration.”\n\nWhoever wins the ballot, he will face interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, 59, whose party came in third after a Kurdish coalition and received 40 seats.\n\n“My list nominated me for the prime ministership,” Allawi, a secular Shiite, said Monday.\n\nAl-Jaafari, the president of the Islamic Dawa Party, is also Western-oriented but is considered by many to be a cleric in a business suit.\n\nChalabi is a former exile leader who heavily promoted the idea that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He later fell out with some key members of the Bush administration over allegations that he passed secrets to Iran.\n\nChalabi’s candidacy could create problems for the alliance because of his vow to rid the government and administration of former members of Saddam’s Baath party. Most Baathists are Sunni Arabs, who largely stayed away from the polls either as a boycott or out of fears of being attacked by militants.\n\nShiite politicians such as al-Jaafari have been quick to reassure Sunnis, who make up about 20 percent of the population but were favored under Saddam, that they will have a role in forming a government and drafting the country’s first democratic constitution. Shiites make up about 60 percent of the population.\n\n———\n\nAssociated Press reporter Qasim Abdul-Zahra contributed to this report."
