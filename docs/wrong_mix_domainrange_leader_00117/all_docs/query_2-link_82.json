        "text": "Announcements\n\nCHECK DATE ERRORS\n\nURGENT: Checks issued June 3–11 may have the date printed incorrectly. This may result in problems depositing or cashing checks. For example, a check generated on 6/10/2024 may display a date of 10/6/2024, making the check dated in the future and therefore unable to cash or deposit. Please verify your checks carefully. You should have received an email from OregonChildSupportProgram@csp.doj.oregon.gov if you are affected. If you have a check with a date error and did not receive our email, please contact Customer Service by email at ChildSupportCustomerService@doj.oregon.gov or by phone Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. – 5:15 p.m. at 800-850-0228. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nNew Reporting Requirement for Employers and Businesses\n\nA new Oregon requirement to report individuals who are independent contractors took effect on January 1, 2024. You can report independent contractors through the Oregon Employer Services Portal. If you believe this impacts your entity, find more information here.\n\nAnnual Notices\n\nThe Oregon Child Support Program issues Annual Notices (English/Espanol) with necessary information to participants each year. If you have an online account, you should have received an email saying you have a new urgent document in your online account. These do not require a response from you and are not an annual accounting of your cases. You can retrieve your Annual Notice by logging in and going to the Documents section. You can request a new PIN or reset your password directly from the online account login page. Online Account User Guide\n\nOnline Account"
