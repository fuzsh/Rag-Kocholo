        "text": "The country generally has fair electoral laws, equal campaigning opportunities, and a weakly enforced system of compulsory voting. If passed with a two-thirds supermajority, changes to electoral law are implemented for the following elections. If passed with a simple majority, they go into effect in the following elections. An electoral law passed by the SYRIZA-led government with a simple majority in 2016 abolished the 50-seat bonus awarded to the winning party and was set to take effect during the elections after those in 2019. In January 2020, the ND government secured passage of legislation that would restore a bonus system, awarding between 20 and 50 bonus seats to the leading party depending on its share of the national vote. The new law also passed with a simple majority, meaning it would take effect only after the next elections.\n\nIn 2019, the ND government passed a law expanding the voting rights of diaspora and overseas Greek citizens. Citizens living abroad can participate in elections by proving residency in Greece for a two-year period within the last 35 years.\n\nGreece’s largest recognized minority population, the Muslim community of Thrace, has full political rights, and three members of the community won seats in the 2019 parliamentary elections. The authorities have rejected some ethnic groups’ attempts to secure official recognition or to register associations with names referring to their ethnic identity, affecting their ability to organize and advocate for their political interests, though such associations are generally able to operate without legal recognition. Since 2010, documented immigrants have been allowed to vote in municipal elections.\n\nIn August 2021, the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (KIS) expressed concern over the appointment of Athanassios Plevris as minister of health. KIS claimed Plevris made antisemitic remarks as a lawyer in a 2009 court case against his father, Constantinos Plevris, who was charged with inciting racism and violence for a book he published called “Jews: The Whole Truth.” Plevris apologized for his comments, stating that the objections to his court statements were “understandable” and that he disagrees with his father’s views.\n\nThough there are no significant legal or practical barriers to women’s political participation, women only hold a little more than a fifth of the seats in Parliament and sexist and patriarchal attitudes dissuade their active participation. In January 2020, Katerina Sakellaropoulou became the first woman to be elected as president of Greece.\n\nCorruption remains a problem in Greece, and institutions tasked with combating it have inadequate resources. Tax officials in past years have been implicated in tax evasion schemes, which seriously complicate the government’s fiscal reform efforts. A new criminal code and a new code of criminal procedure, adopted in 2019, allow prison time for the bribery of politicians and are more broadly aligned with relevant international conventions. However, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed serious concerns that the main active bribery offense was converted from a felony to a misdemeanor.\n\nIn March 2021, a special committee was created to investigate accusations against former digital governance minister Nikos Pappas for receiving bribes and rigging television licensing competition. In July, Parliament voted in favor prosecuting Pappas through a special court in collaboration with the Judicial Council and the prosecutorial authority.\n\nThe constitution includes provisions guaranteeing freedom of the press, and these are generally upheld in practice, though the law imposes some limits related to defamation, hate speech, and other such content. While citizens continue to enjoy access to a broad array of print, broadcast, and online news outlets, ownership concentration and editorial interference from owners remain concerns, and the government has been accused of directing public funds toward friendly private media.\n\nJournalists have been subject to assaults or other mistreatment, particularly while attempting to cover protests or report on migration issues. Crime reporter and journalist Giorgos Karaivaz was fatally shot outside his home in Athens in April 2021. Also in April, police arrested three suspects who had allegedly plotted to kill journalist and newspaper owner Kostas Vaxevanis, after authorities learned that someone had sought to pay for his murder. Vaxevanis had been placed under increased police protection, but no charges had officially been made against the suspects at year’s end.\n\nWomen generally enjoy equality before the law, though they continue to face workplace discrimination in practice. In January 2021, Greek Olympic gold medalist Sofia Bekatorou publicly discussed her experience being sexually assaulted by a former coach. Bekatorou’s revelations paved the way for a nascent #MeToo movement in Greece, in which women more actively and publicly discuss instances of sexual harassment and assault they have experienced. The government responded by proposing legislation in February that facilitate people’s ability to report these incidents and establish harsher punishments for perpetrators.\n\nViolence targeting immigrants, refugees, and LGBT+ people remains a problem. Roma are also subject to discrimination and excessive policing despite legal protections. In October 2021, a young Romany man was killed by police after being caught driving a stolen vehicle. Testimony from a Romany youth in the car revealed that they had surrendered immediately with their hands over their heads after being stopped, but the police still shot at them with about 30 rounds of ammunition.\n\nChristos Pappas, one of the main leaders of the far-right party Golden Dawn, was arrested in July 2021 after being on the run for nine months. Pappas and many other members of Golden Dawn, which failed to win representation in the 2019 elections, were convicted of running a criminal organization in October 2020.\n\nOver 4,300 migrants and refugees entered Greece by sea and more than 4,800 entered by land during 2021, as reported by the Office of the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the lowest numbers since the refugee crisis began several years ago. Many refugees are housed in Reception and Identification Centers on the Aegean islands or in camps on the mainland. Within those centers’ inhumane living conditions, problems range from at times fatal violence, harassment of women, and endangerment of children. NGOs successfully pressured authorities to attempt to close the worst facilities by the end of 2021 and increase the use of urban accommodation on the mainland. Many relocation attempts are protested by Greek communities.\n\nGreek authorities have been accused of forcibly returning migrants and asylum seekers who attempt to enter irregularly from Turkey by land and sea, and multiple cases of such pushbacks were documented in 2021. The government has denied these allegations, though the UNHCR and other organizations called for independent border monitoring in September 2021. In October, Afghani women and children refugees on the island of Lesbos had their documents and belongings confiscated and were returned to sea, later to be discovered by the Turkish Coast guard. Greek authorities claimed they were enforcing European Union (EU) immigration rules while complying with international law."
