        "text": "Nuri al-Maliki assumed the job in April 2006 as a compromise candidate after Ibrahim al-Jaafari failed to gain enough Kurdish or Sunni support.\n\nMr Maliki's very anonymity, as someone without too much political baggage - or so it seemed - was viewed as an asset.\n\nOn becoming prime minister, he faulted his predecessor for having \"a discordant cabinet\" and for appointing ministers who showed more loyalty to their parties than the national government.\n\nYet more than a year on, Mr Maliki faces exactly the same accusation. US officials frequently charge him with behaving more like a Shia sectarian leader, despite his inclusive rhetoric.\n\nThis was not how the administration first saw him. The former US ambassador to Baghdad Zalmay Khalilzad praised Mr Maliki as an Iraqi nationalist.\n\nBut commentators have pointed to Mr Maliki's strong Shia affiliations, which go back a long way. Mr Maliki was a member of the revolutionary Islamic Dawa party, founded in the late 1950s to establish an Islamic state in Iraq.\n\nLike many Dawa leaders, Mr Maliki fled Iraq in the 1980s when Saddam Hussein cracked down on the opposition, and sought refuge in Syria. When Saddam was overthrown by the US-led coalition, Dawa, with Mr Maliki as one of its leaders, emerged as a political force.\n\nMr Maliki's reputation for sectarianism since his appointment has much to do with his record early on in the US-led occupation. He was heavily involved in the de-Ba'athification programme, which barred thousands of Sunnis from government work, regardless of whether they could be shown to have been guilty of wrongdoing. Some 100,000 Sunni Iraqis are said to have lost their jobs since the fall of the old regime.\n\nPerceptions of Mr Maliki's Shia bias have grown as he has become increasingly reliant on the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. But that was perhaps inevitable as Iraq started to fragment along tribal and sectarian lines, leaving Mr Maliki to rely on whomever he could.\n\nSpeaking to US veterans today, Mr Bush bestowed his support on Mr Maliki by calling him a \"good guy, a good man\". But for months now, Mr Maliki has been the subject of a whispering campaign in Washington, and the sniping is unlikely to stop because of George Bush's declaration.\n\nNotwithstanding all the criticisms emanating from Washington - which may in fact bolster Mr Maliki's reputation as someone who is standing up to the US - the White House is stuck with him. He is Iraq's elected leader, and even Washington will not want to be seen to be going over the heads of the Iraqi people to pick their leader.\n\nIn any case, holding Iraq together at this stage looks increasingly beyond the powers of any Iraqi leader.\n\n\"The problem isn't just Maliki; it's the job,\" said Jon Alterman of the Washington thinktank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies."
