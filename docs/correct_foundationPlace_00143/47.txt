Background

Backbone Entertainment's name appeared in 2003 when Digital Eclipse merged with ImaginEngine. Backbone had three divisions in Vancouver (Digital Eclipse), Emeryville and Charlottetown. However, the latter spun-off very soon into the independent studio Other Ocean. In April 2005, the studio merged with The Collective to form Foundation 9 Entertainment, though both studios remained as subsidiaries of the merged company. In 2009, Backbone's Vancouver studio was shut down and other divisions experienced layoffs as well.
