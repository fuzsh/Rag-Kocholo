        "text": "How many M&A deals has Sony made to date?\n\nSony’s first gaming acquisition dates back to 1993 when its gaming division, Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), was known under its original name Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). Since then, SIE has purchased 21 studios, some of which have already been shut down.\n\nThe list of game development companies that joined PlayStation through M&A deals includes Bend Studio, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla Games, Insomniac Games, Media Molecule, and more.\n\nAmong the acquired studios that didn’t live up to the present day:\n\nPsygnosis — British developer founded in 1984. Known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, and Colony Wars, it was acquired by PlayStation in 1993. The studio was renamed SCE Studio Liverpool in 2000, but ceased all operations in 2012. However, Sony renewed a trademark for the Psygnosis brand a couple of years ago;\n\nIncognito Entertainment — US studio founded in 1999 and known for making some games in the Twisted Metal series, as well as online shooter Warhawk. It has been operating under Sony Computer Entertainment America between 2002 and 2009;\n\nZipper Interactive — US studio that was originally focused on different sim games like Top Gun: Hornet’s Nest and MechWarrior 3. It then created the SOCOM series for PlayStation and was acquired by Sony in 2006. However, the Japanese company closed Zipper in 2012, a couple of years after the release of multiplayer shooter MAG;\n\nSigil Games Online — US developer founded in 2002 by key creators of EverQuest. It has only released MMORPG Vanguard: Saga of Heroes, with management selling the company and its assets to Sony shortly after the troubled launch;\n\nEvolution Studios — UK studio known for the WRC and MotorStorm series. Sony acquired the company in 2007 but shut it down almost nine years later. Evolution’s key developers then joined Codemasters.\n\nSIE rarely discloses the financial terms of its acquisitions, so it is hard to say how much money the company has spent during its shopping spree. The only deals with exact amounts are Insomniac Games ($229 million) and Bungie ($3.6 billion).\n\nIn addition to the acquired studios, Sony also owns stakes in video game companies like Devolver Digital, FromSoftware, and Epic Games.\n\nHow many first-party studios does PlayStation own?\n\nOn April 20, SIE announced the acquisition of Firewalk Studios, a studio founded by former Bungie developers. It is said to be the 20th game developer to join PlayStation Studios.\n\nHowever, the list of Sony’s first-party teams is a little longer if we count support studios that don’t directly develop new games but help other subsidiaries with their work.\n\nThese studios are distributed across Asia, Europe, and North America and are united under the PlayStation Studios brand. Sony first established this label in 2005 by forming SCE Worldwide Studios and rebranding it two years ago. At various times, the division was managed by Phil Harrison and Shuhei Yoshida. PlayStation Studios is currently led by Guerilla Games co-founder Hermen Hulst.\n\nBelow you can see the full list of Sony-owned subsidiaries (excluding support studio San Mateo Studio, which mainly works with other teams and oversees the production process) with brief information about each of them."
