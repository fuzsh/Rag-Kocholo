        "text": "Logo description by EnormousRat\n\nBackground: Backbone Entertainment's name appeared in 2003 when Digital Eclipse merged with ImaginEngine. Backbone had three divisions in Vancouver (Digital Eclipse), Emeryville and Charlottetown. However, the latter spun-off very soon into the independent studio Other Ocean. Foundation 9 used Digital Eclipse brand for ported titles, and Backbone for original development. In 2009, the studio in Vancouver was shut down and other divisions experienced layoffs.\n\n(2003- )\n\nLogo: There is a mounting bench (shaped like a human body, having a part of vertebral column instead of its head) surrounded by a white box. Above, the name \"BACKBONE\" is written, and below we see the word \"ENTERTAINMENT\" in smaller font. The byline says: \"A division of Foundation 9 Entertainment\" (in F9E corporate logo).\n\nVariants:\n\nThere are several animated variants used for video-capable platforms.\n\nThe studios in Emeryville and Vancouver has the town name instead of \"Entertainment\".\n\nThe colors can be reversed.\n\nFX/SFX: There are many variants, but the basic version is still.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None for the static version.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. The still version can be found on DS games, such as Charlotte's Web. The Emeryville logo is seen on Dogz and MechAssault: The Phantom War for DS. The Vancouver logo is very rare and probably seen only on Death Jr. for DS (other games come under the Digital Eclipse label).\n\nEditor's Note: None."
