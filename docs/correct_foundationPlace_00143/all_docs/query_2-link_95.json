        "text": "Capital One Arena is home to the NBA’s Washington Wizards, the NHL’s 2018 Stanley Cup Champion Washington Capitals, and the NCAA’s Georgetown Hoyas men’s basketball team. Boasting an average of 220 events per year, Capital One Arena is the heart of an $9.2 billion redevelopment that began 25 years ago when the arena was built and opened on Dec. 2, 1997. Since then, the privately financed arena has hosted 47 million people and more than 4,500 events.\n\nThe surrounding neighborhood throughout the years has been rejuvenated by a plethora of restaurants, condominiums and businesses, making the Seventh Street corridor an entertainment destination.\n\nIn June 2010, Ted Leonsis became the majority owner of Capital One Arena and formed Monumental Sports & Entertainment (MSE). As an arena in the heart of downtown Washington, D.C., Capital One Arena has hosted a multitude of high-profile events in its history, ranging from the 2018 and 1998 Stanley Cup Finals to the NBA (2001) and WNBA (2002, 2007) All-Star games to the 2003 World Figure Skating Championship, the ACC Men’s Basketball Tournament (2005, 2016), the first and second rounds of the NCAA Division I men’s basketball tournament (1998, 2002, 2008) as well as the second and third rounds (2011), the Big Ten Men's Basketball Tournament (2017), the A10 Men’s Basketball Tournament (2018, 2022), and the NCAA East Regional Finals (2006, 2013, 2019, 2026).\n\nEntertainment at the arena would not be complete without concerts and family shows ranging from all-time greats to current-day chart-topping artists. In the 25-year history of the arena, some of the artists who have roamed the halls and mastered the stage at Capital One Arena include: U2, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Drake, Barbra Streisand, Bon Jovi, Prince, Tim McGraw & Faith Hill, Beyonce, the Dalai Lama, Tina Turner, Keith Urban, Paul Simon and Sting, Taylor Swift, Elton John, Daddy Yankee, Disney on Ice and WWE.\n\nTwo events have taken place every single year in the building dating back 40 plus years to the old Capital Centre, making them the longest tenured events between both buildings: the Harlem Globetrotters (1973-present) and the Washington International Horse Show (1975-2019).\n\nOther amenities in the arena include the Etihad Airways Lounge, The Ultra Club, Players Club, Devil's Backbone Lounge, Caesars Sportsbook Lounge and the Team Store. Caesars Sportsbook and Guy Fieri’s DC Kitchen + Bar are also anchored at Capital One Arena."
