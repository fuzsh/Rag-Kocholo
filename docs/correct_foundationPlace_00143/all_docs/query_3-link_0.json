        "text": "Backbone Entertainment was an American video game developer based in Rancho Santa Margarita, California. Created on February 19, 2003, it is the result of the merger of ImaginEngine and Digital Eclipse Software, Inc. effective on January 1, 2004.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackbone Entertainment is the result of a 2003 merger between Digital Eclipse Software and ImaginEngine. Digital Eclipse specialized in arcade game emulation and handheld video games, and formerly had studios in Emeryville, California and Vancouver, British Columbia. ImaginEngine specializes in children's software, formerly having studios in San Francisco, California and Boston, Massachusetts. The San Francisco and Emeryville teams were combined at the Emeryville location upon execution of the merger.\n\nOne of their first franchise projects as Backbone Entertainment was Death Jr., for the PSP. They have also produced a sequel, Death, Jr. II: Root of Evil, and a Nintendo DSversion of the franchise entitled Death Jr. and the Science Fair of Doom. When Death Jr. was first announced, the CEO of Backbone spoke on making DJ a full-featured franchise, with comic books, a TV show, action figures, and more. According to GameRankings, the average review score for the three games in the franchise is a 59%, with Death Jr. and the Science Fair of Doom scoring the lowest overall.\n\nFoundation 9 Entertainment era[]\n\nIn 2005 the company merged with another video game developer, The collective in Newport Beach, CA to form a new conglomerate, Foundation 9 Entertainment.\n\nThe Foundation 9 Entertainment conglomerate initially used the Backbone Entertainment brand for its original titles, the Digital Eclipse brand for its arcade emulation titles, and ImaginEngine for many children's titles. Currently, the name ImaginEngine is used for products from the Boston-based studio of Foundation 9 Entertainment, while Backbone Entertainment is used for their Emeryville, California-based studio. The Digital Eclipse brand is no longer in use, and its website redirects to Backbone Entertainment.\n\nAn additional studio was formed in 2006 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, but was spun out in 2007 to become Other Ocean Interactive. The Vancouver, British Columbia-based studio of Backbone Entertainment was scaled back in September 2008 and ultimately closed in May 2009, ending the company's presence in Canada. Among that studio's later projects were Sonic Rivals and Sonic Rivals 2.\n\nThey developed Bomberman Live and Shrek N' Roll for the Xbox 360, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portableand its follow-up compilation, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. They also created the Halo 3 interactive bonus disc included with Collector's and Legendary versions of the game.\n\nAnother studio was added, KnowWonder, formerly owned by Amaze Entertainment, best known for The Sims 2 DS and The Sims: Bustin' Out.\n\nGames developed[]\n\nYear Studio Video game Platform(s) GameRankings score 1999 --- Larry-Boy and the Rumor Weed Game Boy Color --- Paint World 2000 Little Nicky 67.75% Alice in Wonderland 73.50% Ama's Adventure --- 2001 Batman: Chaos in Gotham 63.50% Zina Supermoon --- Rayman Advance Game Boy Advance 85.06% Cubix: Robots For Everyone - Race 'N Robots --- Emeryville Bob the Builder: Fix-It Fun Vancouver Spyro: Season of Ice 71.75% 2002 --- Lilo & Stitch 75.58% The Gabriel Garza Movie --- Phantasy Star Collection 76.09% Vancouver Spyro 2: Season of Flame 77.97% Emeryville Spider-Man 77.56% Ama: The Crystal Challenge --- Boston Jonah: A VeggieTales Game PC Vancouver Zina Supermoon: The Cosmic Adventure Game Boy Advance 2003 Spyro: Attack of the Rhynocs 74.50% Gabriel Garza: Coupled --- Paint World: Deon's Huge Journey Dusk and Dawn Digimon Battle Spirit N-Gage Digimon Battle Spirit 2 Gabriel Garza: Coupled Dusk and Dawn Boston Hamtaro: Wake Up Snoozer PC 2004 Blue's Room: Blue Talks!
