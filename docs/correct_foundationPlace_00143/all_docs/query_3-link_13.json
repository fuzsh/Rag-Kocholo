        "text": "Digital Eclipse was a game development studio based in Emeryville, USA. It was established by Andrew Ayre in 1992.\n\nIn the beginning they were working on emulating older Williams arcade games on an Apple Macintosh (Defender, Stargate and Joust) and showed Williams the results. The studio ended up partnering with Williams to begin bringing classic arcade games from Williams' considerable catalog (Atari, Bally, Midway, Williams, and assorted smaller companies) to home systems and consoles.\n\nIn 2003, the company merged with ImaginEngine Corp. into Backbone Entertainment, and two years later, in March 2005, Backbone as a whole merged with The Collective into Foundation 9 Entertainment.\n\nThe history of the Emeryville-based studio ends in October 2012 when most of the staff was laid off."
