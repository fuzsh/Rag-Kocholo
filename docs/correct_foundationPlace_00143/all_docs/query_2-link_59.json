        "text": "Consistent with the goals of TechHire, today, Vice President Biden and Department of Labor Secretary Perez are announcing the release of $150 million in new Department of Labor TechHire grants—which will support 39 public-private partnerships to help train tomorrow’s workforce in rapid-growth sectors like tech, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing.\n\nThe grants will focus on providing workers the skills for a pathway to the middle class while providing employers with the skilled technology workers need to grow and expand. The Department of Labor estimates that more than 18,000 participants will receive services through the TechHire grant program. Over $125 million of the grants will go to partnerships that specifically target, train, and support young people, ages 17-29. In addition, $24 million will go to partnerships that help other disadvantaged groups with barriers to employment, including veterans, people with disabilities, people with limited English proficiency, and people with criminal records.\n\nGrant winners and TechHire community partnerships focus on the following:\n\nData and innovative hiring practices to expand openness to non-traditional hiring\n\nModels for training that prepare students in months, not years\n\nActive local leadership to connect people to jobs with hiring on ramp programs\n\nThe TechHire initiative launched in 2015 with 21 communities and over 300 employers committed to providing Americans with the accelerated, nontraditional technical training they need to obtain better jobs and achieve better futures. Since the launch of TechHire, the initiative has grown to 50 communities, committed to improving the lives of Americans. The President is challenging other communities across the country to follow their lead and get involved.\n\nRural Tech in the U.S: South Central Appalachia TechHire\n\nOn June 27, 2016 the Administration also launched South Central Appalachia TechHire, a joint effort by the Appalachian Regional Commission, the University of Virginia’s College at Wise, and private sector employers to develop a world-class ecosystem of tech talent in the heart of Appalachia. Together, South Central Appalachia TechHire will prepare and place over 50 individuals into tech jobs over the next year, and 400 by 2020.\n\nTo learn more about TechHire in rural communities, check out the blog post from NEC Director Jeff Zients and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.\n\nWatch and Read About the Launch Learn More About the Grants Spotlight on Rural Tech"
