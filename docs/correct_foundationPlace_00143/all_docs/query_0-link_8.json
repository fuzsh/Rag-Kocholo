        "text": "About Backbone Entertainment\n\nBackbone Entertainment (BBE), part of Foundation 9 Entertainment, is one of the largest and leading independent developers in North America and has more than 200 employees in growing studios located in the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston and Vancouver.\n\nThe company has developed games for all major publishers. In addition to developing original games based on licensed or franchise properties, the company is also dedicated to creating games based on original, company-developed IP (such as Death, Jr.). We have shipped games across every major platform, and we are currently working on projects from Plug ‘n’ Play, DS and PSP, to current- and next-generation consoles.\n\nAt BBE, you have a chance to make a real difference in the games you develop, and not just be an anonymous number in an anonymous cubicle. From the top down, we are passionate about creating great games with real innovation and fostering creative freedom in our employees. BBE offers a great work atmosphere with challenging roles, and the rare opportunity to contribute on a wide variety of new platforms and genres, including the development of original titles."
