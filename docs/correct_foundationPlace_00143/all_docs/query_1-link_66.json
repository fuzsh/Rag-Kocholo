        "text": "Together, We Are Even Stronger.\n\nDear Neighbor,\n\nCuyahoga Falls has a strong foundation built on superb municipal services, good schools, flourishing businesses, tremendous parks and cultural amenities, abundant dining choices, year-round entertainment options for the entire family, and most importantly - its people.\n\nThere is little question that our diverse blend of safe and friendly neighborhoods serve as the backbone of our community. Whether you live in a house, condo, duplex, or apartment, we all have a stake in the long-term health and vitality of our neighborhoods. We need to continue to build upon our strengths in ways that reinforce our neighborhoods.\n\nThe Neighborhood Excellence Initiative began with a handful of everyday citizens brainstorming about ways to make sure all neighborhoods receive the resources and attention needed to flourish. I am proud to continue this work with residents and city council, to further our goal of achieving excellence.\n\nThe collective goal of the Neighborhood Excellence Initiative is to ensure a strong, safe, and vibrant future for Cuyahoga Falls neighborhoods. We strive to turn this vision into a reality through citizen engagement, neighborhood empowerment, and strategic investment. Now, I ask for your help in walking the path of excellence.\n\nThis brochure provides useful information about current programs and services that may help you or a neighbor and outlines a variety of ways you can help. By working together, we protect our property values, improve our quality of life, and ensure that Cuyahoga Falls remains a wonderful place to live, raise a family, and enjoy retirement for generations to come!\n\nMayor Don Walters\n\nmayor@cityofcf.com\n\n(330) 971-8200\n\nCONTACT THE OFFICERS ELECTED TO SERVE YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD."
