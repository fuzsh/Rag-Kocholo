        "text": "Story Highlights\n\nVimond Media Solutions’ video content management solution has been chosen by VENN to power the video backbone of their startup gaming-centered media network.\n\nThe newly formed gaming, esports, and pop culture entertainment service founded by video-game veterans Ariel Horn and Ben Kusin, VENN or Video Game Entertainment and News Network, will deliver a 24/7 linear network for the streaming generation launching in August. With live studios in Los Angeles and soon to follow New York, VENN is estimated to produce roughly 35 hours of live programming per week.\n\n“The Vimond technology stack incorporating Content Manager, Orchestrator, Content Delivery, and Curator enables a powerful video CMS and unparalleled VOD distribution aggregation service. This allows VENN’s streaming service infrastructure to be innovative, cloud-based, and flexible,” said Scott Gillies, VENN’s CTO. “We trust the Vimond team, and their great technology to power VENN’s video pipeline to best engage our viewers.”\n\nVimond’s toolset makes it possible for VENN to ingest, manage, and curate their unique content to quickly reach viewers with the ability to pivot as needed with business models and scale as adoption and viewership grow."
