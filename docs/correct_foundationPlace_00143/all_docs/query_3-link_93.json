        "text": "DETROIT LAKES — Teach Haiti founder Miquette Denie McMahon still has strong ties in Detroit Lakes, where she attended high school through a Rotary Exchange scholarship during the 2000-01 school year.\n\nIn fact, it was to her friends and Rotary family in Detroit Lakes that McMahon went to a little over 17 years ago when she was looking for ways to help her fellow Haitians get the same kind of education that saw her realize her dreams of becoming a nurse.\n\n\"This community is the backbone of Teach Haiti,\" she said during a June 27 fundraising visit to Detroit Lakes' Holy Rosary Church.\n\nFor this visit, McMahon was accompanied by a team that not only included her mother, Rose Denie, but also two graduates of the Teach Haiti program, which started in 2010 with a small group of kindergartners. One of those former students, Jessica Toussaint, was sponsored by Detroit Lakes' own Tamie Jensen, who had the opportunity to meet her for the first time at the event.\n\n\"I'm so excited to meet this girl!\" said Jensen with a broad smile.\n\nIn a later Facebook post, Jensen related part of her family's history with Jessica, noting that she and her husband Steve had just lost a child a couple of years before Jessica came into their lives.\n\n\"This visit was such an unexpected blessing from the Lord,\" she wrote. \"He heals our hearts in so many ways.\"\n\nToussaint, as she said during the Teach Haiti presentation, said that she started with Teach Haiti when she was in second grade. She had just lost her mother, and her dad wasn't a part of her life, but thanks to Teach Haiti and the Jensens' donations, she has set her sights on becoming a nurse.\n\nToday, the Teach Haiti organization has grown to provide annual scholarships for over 600 impoverished Haitian children and has built two schools, one which operates in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and the other in McMahon's hometown, St. Michel, which is located on the northern part of the island nation, far from the capital.\n\nMcMahon visited the St. Michel school this past spring and was able to leave the island before the gang violence that erupted in the nation's capital impacted travel in and out of the country.\n\n\"My goal is still that one day, some of you would be able to go to Haiti and see (the impact of Teach Haiti),\" McMahon said, but because, as she put it, \"I know that might not happen for a while,\" she instead showed a video of her most recent visit to the group of 40 or so that showed up for Thursday's presentation.\n\nIn that video, McMahon showed the home where she grew up in St. Michel — a small shack without running water or electricity.\"Every single day, I would get up, I would put my (school) uniform on and I would have a sense of hope,\" she said. \"Even though sometimes there would be no food, no breakfast before we go to school, that uniform gave me such strength and optimism to know that one day, I might rise up from poverty. And it's because of people like you, who poured (assistance) into my life that today, my dream of becoming a nurse came true.\"\n\nWith so many students now enrolled with Teach Haiti, it has become impractical to continue with the organization's previous fundraising format, where each donor would directly sponsor a child's tuition, and receive regular updates on that child's progress.\n\nSo on Thursday, McMahon and Teach Haiti board member Tom Klyve unveiled a new format, where donations would go into a scholarship pool that would be used to fund future students' education. Though those who are sponsoring a student through Teach Haiti may continue to do so, this will be the format for future donations, Klyve noted in response to a question from the audience."
