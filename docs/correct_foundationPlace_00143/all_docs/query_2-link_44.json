        "text": "Mark your calendars!\n\n31st Annual Public Justice Foundation Auction\n\nThursday, March 19, 2020\n\nNew Format!\n\nSilent Auction | Student Lounge\n\n9 a.m.-2 p.m. (bidding closes at 1:45 p.m.)\n\nLunch will be served from 12:30-1:45 p.m.\n\nPurchase tickets online up until noon on the day of the event.\n\nPURCHASE TICKETS DONATE\n\nOur 31st annual Public Justice Foundation (PJF) Auction will be held on Thursday, March 19 at the Law School.\n\nThe Foundation very much welcomes monetary donations. Please help us ensure that Hofstra Law students can continue to contribute to the pursuit of public justice by making a monetary donation. All donations are tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law.\n\nYour Gift in Action\n\nJonathan Goldhirsch 2L, U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration: The Public Justice Foundation's grant allowed me to spend my summer working full time at the U.S. Department of Labor. At DOL, I assisted attorneys in their investigations of retirement and welfare plans, helping to recover delinquent contributions to these plans. I reviewed thousands of emails and plan agreements to determine whether employers were providing adequate benefits to their employees. I also researched high-profile employment law issues like cross-plan offsetting and wrote research memorandums to assist attorneys to better understand recent case law and the secretary of laborâs position on such issues. This internship allowed me to hone my research abilities and develop my analytical thinking, ultimately improving the quality and efficiency of my work.\n\nSamantha Levitz 2L, Nassau County District Attorney's Office, District Court: Thanks to the generous funding that I received from PJF, I was able to spend my summer shadowing experienced attorneys at the Nassau County District Attorney's Office. During my internship I observed various court proceedings and assisted in preparing for hearings and trials. This experience solidified my passion for criminal prosecution and was an invaluable contribution to my legal education.\n\nDONATE\n\nThe Public Justice Foundation is Hofstra Lawâs public interest law student organization. The objectives of foundation are twofold: first, to raise awareness about public sector law practice by facilitating student employment in the area and, second, to expose the Law School community to important legal issues through debate and discussion.\n\nThe Public Justice Foundation holds various fundraisers, including an annual goods and services auction. The auction is our principal fundraiser, with 100 percent of the money raised going to support summer fellowships for Hofstra Law students. These fellowships enable recipients to take non-paying jobs in the public sector that they otherwise would be unable to accept due to financial constraints. In furtherance of our second objective, the Public Justice Foundation has sponsored debates on prisonersâ rights, the policy and constitutionality of âhate crimesâ legislation, the Clarence Thomas nomination and âClintonomics.â\n\nFellowship recipients have worked at some of the following places: Nassau/Suffolk Law Services, District Attorneyâs Office, U.S. Attorneyâs Office, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Justice, New York State Division of Human Rights, New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, South Brooklyn Legal Services, New York Legal Assistance Group, Legal Assistance Corp. of Massachusetts (Family and Child Department), Domestic Violence Coalition, Public Defenders Office and many, many more."
