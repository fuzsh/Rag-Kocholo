        "text": "The Adventure of a Lifetime\n\nAdventure waits for sightseers, hikers, and thrill-seekers in Devils Garden – one of the premier locations in the park. Here you’ll find arches, spires, and a large concentration of narrow rock walls called “fins.” Fins form when rainwater erodes parallel fractures caused by the uplift of salt deposits below the surface. Fins eventually erode and give way to the formation of arches like Landscape Arch, the crown jewel of Devils Garden.\n\nLandscape Arch is the longest arch in North America with a light opening of 306 feet (93.3 meters). This awe-inspiring expanse is only 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter at its narrowest. Large segments of the arch came crashing down in the 1990s – proof that the park’s landscape can change dramatically in a instant. Although other arches have fallen, Landscape Arch still hangs on by a very thin thread.\n\nDevils Garden offers breathtaking views, camping, backpacking, stargazing, and hiking of all skill levels. There is truly something for everyone in this popular area of the park."
