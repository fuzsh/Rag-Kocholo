        "text": "Background\n\nBackbone Entertainment's name appeared in 2003 when Digital Eclipse merged with ImaginEngine. Backbone had three divisions in Vancouver (Digital Eclipse), Emeryville and Charlottetown. However, the latter spun-off very soon into the independent studio Other Ocean. In April 2005, the studio merged with The Collective to form Foundation 9 Entertainment, though both studios remained as subsidiaries of the merged company. In 2009, Backbone's Vancouver studio was shut down and other divisions experienced layoffs as well.\n\nLogo (August 16, 2005-November 6, 2012)\n\nVisuals: There is a mounting bench (shaped like a human body, having a part of vertebral column instead of its head) surrounded by a white box. Above, the name \"BACKBONE\" is written, and below is the word \"ENTERTAINMENT\" in a smaller font. The byline \"A division of Foundation 9 Entertainment\" (with F9E's corporate logo) is seen below.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere are several animated variants used for video-capable platforms.\n\nThe studios in Emeryville and Vancouver have the town name instead of \"ENTERTAINMENT\".\n\nSometimes, the colors are inverted.\n\nTechnique: A digital graphic.\n\nAudio: None for the static version."
