So today we want to put some incredible drummers front and center! Including: @kassaoverall, @ulyssesowensjr_, @smithches, @googlebully, Nick Yacyshyn from @sumacbandofficial, @biboye.onanuga, @kentonloewen, @konradagnas, and @jasonwinikoff. \n \nüî≥Kassa Overall is a GRAMMY-nominated emcee, singer, producer and drummer who melds avant-garde experimentation with hip-hop production techniques to tilt the nexus of jazz and rap in unmapped directions. \nüü¶Ulysses Owens Jr. leads a new ensemble Generation Y, building bridges to success and paying it forward by featuring a new crop of remarkable jazz talents that he‚Äôs discovered through his professorship at Juilliard. \nüü©We All Break is the extraordinary and innovative project is the brainchild of drummer/composer Ches Smith, well-known to fans of cutting-edge jazz, improv, and avant-rock.\nüüßLegendary Bad Plus drummer Dave King returns to the Vancouver Playhouse to lend his talents to Julian Lage. \n‚¨õÔ∏èNick Yacyshyn brings tour-honed technical skill (and a few admiring accolades from Dave Grohl) to metal band SUMAC, who fluctuate between meticulous discipline on one end, and untethered feral energy on the other. \nüü™Finding its voice somewhere between jazz and hip-hop, Biboye Onanuga‚Äôs quartet bends and leans into a spiritual aesthetic and submits itself to the moment. \nüü®Local legend Kenton Loewen will be performing with JUNO-nominated breathers of instrumental fire Peregrine Falls. \nüü•Konrad Agnas is one of Sweden‚Äôs most sought-after drummers, making his debut as composer/bandleader with Rite of Passage, where he unites collaged hip-hop fantasias and Alice Coltrane-inspired spiritual jazz. \n‚¨úÔ∏èJason Winikoff is leading the Hot 5 who play early swing and New Orleans trad jazz from the seminal 1900-1930s era.\n#vanjazzfest\". find, me",
