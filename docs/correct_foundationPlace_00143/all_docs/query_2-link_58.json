        "text": "Technically, mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering from design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object. Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the principles of motion, energy, and force—ensuring that designs function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost.\n\nMechanical engineers make a difference. That's because mechanical engineering careers center on creating technologies to meet human needs. Virtually every product or service in modern life has probably been touched in some way by a mechanical engineer to help humankind.\n\nThis includes solving today's problems and creating future solutions in health care, energy, transportation, world hunger, space exploration, climate change, and more.\n\nBeing ingrained in many challenges and innovations across many fields means a mechanical engineering education is versatile. To meet this broad demand, mechanical engineers may design a component, a machine, a system, or a process. This ranges from the macro to the micro, from the largest systems like cars and satellites to the smallest components like sensors and switches. Anything that needs to be manufactured—indeed, anything with moving parts—needs the expertise of a mechanical engineer.\n\nHow do I become a mechanical engineer?\n\nThere are several paths you can take to a career in mechanical engineering. Tomorrow needs MEs who are prepared to make a difference in the world to solve challenges in healthcare, energy, transportation, space exploration, climate change, and more.\n\nMost entry-level mechanical engineering positions require at least a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering or mechanical engineering technology. Positions that are related to national defense may need a security clearance and a US citizenship may be required for certain types and levels of clearances.\n\nIn high school, focus on classes in math and physics. Other science courses can also be helpful. Research colleges and universities offering an accredited mechanical engineering degree program. Visit the schools you are interested in and apply early. Become a mechanical engineer.\n\nMechanical Engineering at Michigan Tech\n\nWe are committed to our mission of hands-on education of our mechanical engineering students, by world-class faculty, through innovative teaching, mentoring, and knowledge creation.\n\nMechanical Engineering Degrees\n\nThe bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at Michigan Tech offers undergraduate students many unique, hands-on learning opportunities:\n\nUndergraduate Research Opportunities\n\nUndergraduate research opportunities are plentiful. Our department offers undergraduate students numerous opportunities in research, hands-on experience, and real-world client work. Research projects often require help from students for running simulations, taking data, analyzing results, etc. These opportunities may even be paid, depending on the availability of funds on the particular project. Take advantage of over 50,000 square feet of labs and computer centers, in the 13-story R. L. Smith Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics Building.\n\nReal-World Experience\n\nGet ready to contribute on the job from day one. Our students benefit from hands-on experiences ranging from our senior capstone design program to our enterprise teams to internships/co-ops. As a mechanical engineer, you can make a difference in the world by using the latest technologies to help solve today's grand challenges.\n\nABET Accreditation\n\nOur undergraduate mechanical engineering program is ABET Accredited. ABET accreditation is a significant achievement. We have worked hard to ensure that our program meets the quality standards set by the profession. And, because it requires comprehensive, periodic evaluations, ABET accreditation demonstrates our continuing commitment to the quality of our program—both now and in the future.\n\nPrepare for Graduate Study"
