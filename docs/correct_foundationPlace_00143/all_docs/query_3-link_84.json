        "text": "100+ Years of Family Fun\n\nThe Brown County Fair has been providing entertainment and promoting family unity since the 1880's. It began as a small county fair where livestock, vegetables, grains, and machinery were brought for display. In the 1920's, it became known as the Tri-State Fair (Minnesota and the two Dakotas) which ran a full week and was popular for its competitions among purebred animal producers. The Tri-State Fair also featured huge machinery displays, horse racing and auto racing. It was a major social and entertainment event before the days of radio and television.\n\nSince those early days, the fair has opened up to all residents of the county and includes a large variety of exhibit choices: all breeds of livestock, poultry, field crops, garden crops, flowers, arts and crafts and several home arts divisions.\n\nThe County 4-H Clubs have become a very important part of the fair as their youth take part in a variety of programs offered by 4-H. These young people have become the backbone of the future as they display their interests, efforts and leadership skills which they have learned through this training.\n\nGRANDSTAND ENTERTAINMENT TAKES ROOT\n\nIn 1986, the \"Booster Button\" concept was introduced. This concept provides quality well-known grandstand entertainment for the week at one price. The revenue from the sale of buttons enabled the Fair Board to improve the buildings and grounds, offer free stage entertainment, more exhibits, shows and displays creating a fair that indeed has something for everyone. Grandstand revenue also allows for no gate fee so the fair is available to everyone, every day.\n\nGRANDSTAND HISTORY SINCE 1986\n\n2022\n\nRandy Rogers Band, Wade Bowen, Craig Morgan, Danielle Bradbery, Callista Clark, Seether, Saliva, Emissary Echo, Scotty McCreery, Parmalee, Larry Fleet\n\n2021\n\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band, Sara Evans, Eli Young Band, Randy Houser, Daughtry, Black Stone Cherry, Nelly, Michael Ray, Jo Dee Messina\n\n2020\n\nThe Brown County Fair was postponed due to COVID-19.\n\n2019\n\nTriple Threat Tour: Black Hawk, Restless Heart & Shenandoah, Dylan Scott, Jordan Davis, 3 Doors Down, Red Sun Rising, Big & Rich, Cassadee Pope\n\n2018\n\nGranger Smith, Casey Donahew, Chase Rice, Chris Lane, Skillet, Pop Evil, Brothers Osborne, John King\n\n2017\n\nFor King and Country, Zach Williams, Old Dominion, Brandon Lay, Trace Adkins, Lauren Alaina, The Band Perry, LOCASH\n\n2016\n\nMercyMe, Sidewalk Prophets, Dustin Lynch, Chris Janson, Montgomery Gentry, Canaan Smith, Jake Owen, Avenger Joe\n\n2015\n\nNewsboys, Ryan Stevenson, Martina McBride, Dan + Shay, Brett Eldredge, Gary Allan, Randy Houser\n\n2014\n\nKip Moore, Cassadee Pope, Chris Young, Courtney Cole, Willie Nelson\n\n2013\n\nJustin Moore, John Michael Montgomery, Brantley Gilbert, Chancey Williams & The Younger Brothers Band, Gretchen Wilson, Katie Armiger\n\n2012\n\nTravis Tritt, Hunter Hayes, Jerrod Niemann, David Nail, Dierks Bentley, Dustin Evans & the Good Times Band\n\n2011\n\nLeAnn Rimes, John Anderson, The Band Perry, Frankie Ballard, Josh Turner, The Bellamy Brothers\n\n2010\n\nClay Walker, Joe Diffie, Jake Owen, Love & Theft, Kenny Rogers, Joey + Rory\n\n2009\n\nLuke Bryan, Heidi Newfield, Blake Shelton, Herb Dixon, Rodney Atkins, Gloriana\n\n2008\n\nKellie Pickler, Ashton Shepherd, Miranda Lambert, Mark Chesnutt, Ronnie Milsap, Hailey Steele\n\n2007\n\nTaylor Swift, Craig Morgan, Triple Threat, Blackhawk, Little Texas & Restless Heart, Lonestar, Taryn Kranhold\n\n2006\n\nNeal McCoy, Jo Dee Messina, Keith Anderson, Josh Gracin\n\n2005\n\nDierks Bentley, Lauren Lucas, Oak Ridge Boys, Trace Adkins, Dustin Evans and the Goodtimes\n\n2004\n\nChris Cagle, Valerie Smith & Liberty Pike, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, Diamond Rio\n\n2003\n\nGary Allan, Kelly Coffey, Pat Benatar & Neil Geraldo, Sawyer Brown\n\n2002\n\nLifehouse, Charlie Daniels, Phil Vassar, Carolyn Dawn Johnson\n\n2001\n\nBlessid Union of Souls, EVE 6, Yankee Grey, Terri Clark, Creedence Clearwater Revisited\n\n2000\n\nChely Wright, Ty Herndon, 38 Special, Glenn Campbell\n\n1999\n\nToby Keith, Sammy Kershaw, Lee Ann Womack, Mustang Sally, Montgomery Gentry, The Coats\n\n1998\n\nTracy Byrd, Bill Engvall, The Lynns, Little River Band, Kenny Chesney, BR 549\n\n1997\n\nRhett Akins, Martina McBride, Williams & Ree, Joe Diffie\n\n1996\n\nChris LeDoux, John Berry, The Trench Coats, Lonestar, Williams & Ree, JoDee Messina, Ricochet\n\n1995\n\nPatty Loveless, Guess Who, Blackhawk, Neal McCoy\n\n1994\n\nLittle Texas, Diamond Rio, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Velvet Touch, Michelle Wright\n\n1993\n\nBilly Dean, Confederate Railroad, Ronna Reeves, Mark Chestnut, Restless Heart\n\n1992\n\nBrooks & Dunn, Diamond Rio, Lee Greenwood, Suzy Bogguss, Pam Tillis, Pirates of the Mississippi\n\n1991\n\nThe Statler Brothers, Paul Revere & the Raiders, Baillie & the Boys, Joe Diffie, Restless Heart\n\n1990\n\nLorrie Morgan, The Oak Ridge Boys, The Bellamy Brothers, Highway 101\n\n1989\n\nThe Escape Club, Charley Pride, Sawyer Brown, Skip Ewing, Lacy J.
