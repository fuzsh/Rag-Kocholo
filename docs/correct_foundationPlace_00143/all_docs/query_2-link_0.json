        "text": "Defunct American video game developer\n\nBackbone Entertainment was an American video game developer based in Emeryville, California. The company was formed in 2003 as the result of a merger between developers Digital Eclipse and ImaginEngine. In 2005, Backbone merged with The Collective to form Foundation 9 Entertainment.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nBackbone Entertainment was formed in 2003 through a merger between Digital Eclipse, a developer of emulations of arcade games, and ImaginEngine, an edutainment games developer. ImaginEngine remained an independent studio, based in Framingham, Massachusetts, while Digital Eclipse's studios were absorbed by Backbone, becoming Backbone Emeryville and Backbone Vancouver, respectively.[1][2] In 2004, in co-operation with the University of Hawaii, Backbone opened an office in Honolulu, Hawaii, under the lead of Backbone's chairman, Mark Loughridge.[3][4] On March 29, 2005, Backbone Entertainment announced that it was merging with another developer, The Collective, to form Foundation 9 Entertainment.[5] By this point, Backbone also operated Games2Learn, another edutainment game developer.[5] Later in 2005, Backbone first rose to prominence with the release of Death Jr., a game for PlayStation Portable.[6]\n\nIn February 2006, Backbone opened another subsidiary studio, Backbone Charlottetown, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, under the lead of Andrew Ayre.[7] In May 2007, the new studio, including Ayre and several former Digital Eclipse employees, spun off from Backbone and became Other Ocean Interactive, aiming at showcasing Digital Eclipse's former traits in a smaller fashion.[8][9] In September 2008, Backbone let go most people employed at its Vancouver studio, followed by a full closure of the studio in May 2009.[10][11] In October 2012, Backbone laid off the majority of its Emeryville-based staff to avoid closing completely.[12] A few days later, it was reported that ImaginEngine had shut down, leaving 25 people, including studio head Randall Sanborn, out of work.[1]\n\nSubsidiaries[edit]\n\nBackbone Charlottetown (2006–2007)\n\nBackbone Emeryville (2003–2015)\n\nBackbone Vancouver (2003–2009)\n\nGames2Learn\n\nImaginEngine (2003–2012)\n\nGames developed[edit]\n\nYear Title Platform(s) 2004 The Incredibles: Escape from Nomanisan Island Microsoft Windows 2005 Rifts: Promise of Power N-Gage Death Jr. PlayStation Portable Namco Museum 50th Anniversary GameCube, Game Boy Advance, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox Smash TV Xbox 360 Gauntlet Xbox 360 Joust Xbox 360 2006 Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Xbox 360 Time Pilot Xbox 360 Scramble Xbox 360 Robotron: 2084 Xbox 360 Contra Xbox 360 Frogger Xbox 360 Defender Xbox 360 Age of Empires: The Age of Kings Nintendo DS Charlotte's Web Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS Death Jr. II: Root of Evil PlayStation Portable, Wii NBA Ballers: Rebound PlayStation Portable Sonic Rivals PlayStation Portable MechAssault: Phantom War Nintendo DS 2007 Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Xbox 360 Streets of Rage 2 PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Sonic the Hedgehog PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Ecco the Dolphin Xbox 360 Golden Axe Xbox 360 Yie Ar Kung-Fu Xbox 360 Track & Field Xbox 360 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Xbox 360 Super Contra Xbox 360 Rush'n Attack Xbox 360 Root Beer Tapper Xbox 360 Paperboy Xbox 360 Gyruss Xbox 360 Cyberball 2072 Xbox 360 Bomberman Live Xbox 360 Death Jr. and the Science Fair of Doom Nintendo DS Sonic the Hedgehog iOS Brooktown High PlayStation Portable Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Sonic Rivals 2 PlayStation Portable Shrek n' Roll Xbox 360 Yaris Xbox 360 2008 Discs of Tron Xbox 360 Monster Lab Wii Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3 PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 1942: Joint Strike PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Tron Xbox 360 2009 Altered Beast Xbox 360 Comix Zone Xbox 360 Diner Dash Xbox 360 Gunstar Heroes Xbox 360 Military Madness: Nectaris Xbox 360 Phantasy Star II Xbox 360 Space Invaders Extreme Xbox 360 Shinobi Xbox 360 Sonic & Knuckles Xbox 360 Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Xbox 360 Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection PS3, Xbox 360 G.I.
