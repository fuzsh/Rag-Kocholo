        "text": "Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park Foundation Document\n\nThe following are the planning strategies of Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park. Pictures and appendixes from within the Foundation Document are omitted from this page.\n\nMission of the National Park Service\n\nThe National Park Service (NPS) preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the national park system for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The National Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world.\n\nThe NPS core values are a framework in which the National Park Service accomplishes its mission. They express the manner in which, both individually and collectively, the National Park Service pursues its mission. The NPS core values are:\n\n·· Shared stewardship: We share a commitment to resource stewardship with the global preservation community.\n\n·· Excellence: We strive continually to learn and improve so that we may achieve the highest ideals of public service.\n\n·· Integrity: We deal honestly and fairly with the public and one another.\n\n·· Tradition: We are proud of it; we learn from it; we are not bound by it.\n\n·· Respect: We embrace each other’s differences so that we may enrich the well-being of everyone.\n\nThe National Park Service is a bureau within the Department of the Interior. While numerous national park system units were created prior to 1916, it was not until August 25, 1916, that President Woodrow Wilson signed the National Park Service Organic Act formally establishing the National Park Service.\n\nThe national park system continues to grow and comprises more than 400 park units covering more than 84 million acres in every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These units include, but are not limited to, national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House. The variety and diversity of park units throughout the nation require a strong commitment to resource stewardship and management to ensure both the protection and enjoyment of these resources for future generations.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEvery unit of the national park system will have a foundational document to provide basic guidance for planning and management decisions—a foundation for planning and management. The core components of a foundation document include a brief description of the park as well as the park’s purpose, significance, fundamental resources and values, and interpretive themes. The foundation document also includes special mandates and administrative commitments, an assessment of planning and data needs that identifies planning issues, planning products to be developed, and the associated studies and data required for park planning. Along with the core components, the assessment provides a focus for park planning activities and establishes a baseline from which planning documents are developed.\n\nA primary benefit of developing a foundation document is the opportunity to integrate and coordinate all kinds and levels of planning from a single, shared understanding of what is most important about the park. The process of developing a foundation document begins with gathering and integrating information about the park. Next, this information is refined and focused to determine what the most important attributes of the park are. The process of preparing a foundation document aids park managers, staff, and the public in identifying and clearly stating in one document the essential information that is necessary for park management to consider when determining future planning efforts, outlining key planning issues, and protecting resources and values that are integral to park purpose and identity. While not included in this document, a park atlas is also part of a foundation project. The atlas is a series of maps compiled from available geographic information system (GIS) data on natural and cultural resources, visitor use patterns, facilities, and other topics. It serves as a GIS-based support tool for planning and park operations. The atlas is published as a (hard copy) paper product and as geospatial data for use in a web mapping environment. The park atlas for Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park can be accessed online at: http://insideparkatlas.nps.gov/.\n\nPart 1: Core Components\n\nThe core components of a foundation document include a brief description of the park, park purpose, significance statements, fundamental resources and values, and interpretive themes.\n\nThese components are core because they typically do not change over time. Core components are expected to be used in future planning and management efforts.\n\nBrief Description of the Park\n\nOpportunity, innovation, immigration, the American Dream—the ideas and principles that formed the cornerstone of the United States are represented today at Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park. The stories of our industrial heritage are the stories of America in the 21st century.\n\nPaterson Great Falls National Historical Park encompasses approximately 52 acres adjacent to the Passaic River in the city of Paterson, west of the city’s downtown center. Paterson, approximately 15 miles from Manhattan as well as downtown Newark, is within the greater New York–Northern New Jersey Metropolitan Area and is the county seat for Passaic County.\n\nPortions of the park fall within the Great Falls of the Passaic River / Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures National Historic Landmark Historic District and Great Falls of Paterson–Garret Mountain Natural National Landmark. It also includes Hinchliffe Stadium National Historic Landmark, significant for its role in the history of Negro professional baseball in 20th-century segregated America.\n\nThe park consists of the natural, cultural, and historic resources associated with the Great Falls of the Passaic River, the hydropower system it feeds, and a 220-year period of industrial history. The Great Falls is an outstanding example of the country’s natural history, formed millions of years ago. The geologic formation created an extraordinary 77-foot fall into a naturally occurring 280-foot chasm that attracted American Indians and later Colonial era tourists. By the late 18th century, entrepreneurs, investors, and government officials, led by Alexander Hamilton, sought to harness the power of the river through the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures. The resulting concentration of 19th and 20th century industrial buildings and structures, connected to a water power system of raceways fed by the Passaic River just above the Great Falls, illustrates the growth and evolution in industrial planning, architecture, and engineering in the United States from 1792 to 1945.\n\nThe park is situated in and serves one of the most ethnically and socioeconomically diverse communities in the country. There are more than 50 ethnic groups represented in a population of some 160,000. Many of the descendants of older waves of ethnic immigrant groups live in nearby suburban communities that surround Paterson. Today, there is a tremendous opportunity to introduce diverse communities to the National Park Service through outreach, on-site programs, youth work programs, and the enhancement of educational and recreational opportunities within the park’s boundaries, and to do so in cooperation with both public and private partners.\n\nPaterson Great Falls National Historical Park is one of many partnership parks in the national park system. In a partnership park, many parties cooperate to preserve the park’s resources and provide experiences for visitors and to accomplish the vision for the park. Today the park has numerous partners who support a variety of park activities and operations. Several have formal agreements with the National Park Service, but many of the park’s partnerships are collaborative with less formal arrangements. Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park represents an evolving idea of a park in an urban setting that brings a national park experience “close to home” and whose ownership and management are shared by a group of partners.\n\nThis approach has many advantages and brings great flexibility in responding to opportunities and challenges as technology and innovation are quickly moving forward.\n\nPark Purpose\n\nThe purpose statement identifies the specific reason(s) for establishment of a particular park. The purpose statement for Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park was drafted through a careful analysis of its enabling legislation and the legislative history that influenced its development. The park was established when the enabling legislation adopted by Congress was signed into law on March 30, 2009 (see appendix A for enabling legislation and legislative acts). The purpose statement lays the foundation for understanding what is most important about the park.\n\nPark Significance\n\nSignificance statements express why a park’s resources and values are important enough to merit designation as a unit of the national park system. These statements are linked to the purpose of Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park, and are supported by data, research, and consensus. Statements of significance describe the distinctive nature of the park and why an area is important within a global, national, regional, and systemwide context. They focus on the most important resources and values that will assist in park planning and management.\n\nThe following significance statements have been identified for Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park. (Please note that the sequence of the statements does not reflect the level\n\nof significance.)\n\n·· The Great Falls of the Passaic River, with its natural chasm and 77-foot waterfall, provides an extraordinary scenic and geologic resource in the midst of an industrialized city and opportunities for relaxation, contemplation, and inspiration.\n\n·· Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park and the national historic landmark district provide one of the best opportunities to view a complete hydropower system from its source above the Great Falls of the Passaic River to its transformation into power for the mills and the surrounding community. Alexander Hamilton’s vision of a model manufacturing city, a central part of his economic strategy for the nation, is embedded in this industrial, cultural, and natural landscape.\n\n·· Paterson’s raceway system illustrates American ingenuity as the country grew to become a major industrial nation. The raceways offer an outstanding opportunity to interpret the city’s industrial past and the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures’ role as a manufacturing incubator making it possible for immigrants to start businesses with limited resources and capital.\n\n·· The entrepreneurship and innovations of Paterson’s industrialists and workers allowed the city to thrive and evolve over time in a long continuum of industrial use that continues today. Paterson’s success can be attributed in large part to immigrants who brought their creativity and experience to the city seeking a better life; a trend that has continued throughout the city’s history.\n\n·· Hinchliffe Stadium is one of the best examples of a professional Negro League baseball venue. The stadium was specifically sited above the Great Falls so patrons could have a commanding view of Paterson’s ever-evolving industrial, social, and natural landscape.\n\nFundamental Resources and Values\n\nFundamental resources and values (FRVs) are those features, systems, processes, experiences, stories, scenes, sounds, smells, or other attributes determined to warrant primary consideration during planning and management processes because they are essential to achieving the purpose of the park and maintaining its significance. Fundamental resources and values are closely related to a park’s legislative purpose and are more specific than significance statements.\n\nFundamental resources and values help focus planning and management efforts on what is truly significant about the park. One of the most important responsibilities of NPS managers is to ensure the conservation and public enjoyment of those qualities that are essential (fundamental) to achieving the purpose of the park and maintaining its significance. If fundamental resources and values are allowed to deteriorate, the park purpose and/or significance could be jeopardized.\n\nThe following fundamental resources and values have been identified for Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park:\n\n·· Geologic Formation and Features. The Great Falls of the Passaic River were designated a national natural landmark in 1967, significant because of its creation by the Watchung basaltic lava flow. The geologic formation of the falls has created an extraordinary 77-foot fall into a naturally occurring chasm.\n\n·· Hydrologic Systems. The Passaic River is the principal drainage of the Great Swamp area that cuts its way through northern New Jersey and eventually cascades over the Great Falls in Paterson. The flowing water was the backbone of industrial development as the City of Paterson was planned and still provides power today. The river also provides an ecological and recreational value to an otherwise industrial city.\n\n·· Historic Structures, Archeological Resources, and Ruins. Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park’s historic structures, structural ruins, and associated archeological resources, including the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures’ (S.U.M.) Administration Building, Allied Textile Printing site (including the Colt Gun Mill ruins), the S.U.M. Steam Plant ruins, and the Ivanhoe Wheelhouse, convey the history of the park’s industrial past.\n\n·· Raceway System. Paterson’s system of raceways (gatehouses; wheelhouses; upper, middle, and lower raceways; spillways; outfalls; and associated archeological resources) provides visitors with a complete vision and understanding of how the system functions as a whole and fits into the larger hydropower grid of the industrial landscape.\n\n·· Hinchliffe Stadium. The municipal stadium hosted Negro League baseball games and served as the home field for the New York Black Yankees and New York Cubans. When segregation of major league baseball ended, the stadium enjoyed new life as a center for sports and entertainment that continued to bring the people of Paterson together.\n\n·· Natural Scenic and Industrial Landscape Views. The breathtaking views of the Great Falls and surrounding natural landscape allow a glimpse into the inherent beauty bof nature in contrast to the manipulated landscape of the industrial city. The topography within the park provides visitors with panoramic views of the national historic landmark historic district’s industrial landscape, reflecting settlement and industrial development patterns.\n\n·· Experiential Elements of the Falls. The experience of hearing the water thunder over the falls, feeling the spray from the water crashing into the chasm, and watching the water churn down the river help the visitor understand the power of the flowing water.\n\nRelated Resources\n\nRelated resources are not owned by the National Park Service nor are they within the park boundary. They may be part of the broader context or setting in which park resources exist, represent a thematic connection that would enhance the experience of visitors, or have close association with park fundamental resources and the purpose of the park. The related resource represents a connection with the park that often reflects an area of mutual benefit or interest, and collaboration, between the park and owner/stakeholder.\n\nThe following related resources have been identified for Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park:\n\n·· Historic Mill Buildings. The numerous historic mill buildings within the national historic landmark historic district were an integral part of the industrial development of the city. The densely constructed mills along the raceways and river illustrate the success of a 19th century industrial city.\n\n·· Milling Community. Paterson’s success was built largely on the innovative, entrepreneurial spirit of its citizens, most of whom were immigrants. The mill housing, community centers, recreational facilities, and local sites of labor protest, such as the Botto House, provide the visitor with an understanding of the typical lifestyle of 19th and 20th century mill workers.\n\n·· Museum Collections. The City of Paterson, one of the park’s partners, maintains a collection of museum objects relating to the park’s period of significance. These items and artifacts show the inner workings of manufacturing machinery used in Paterson products produced in Paterson’s mills, and personal artifacts of mill workers.\n\n·· Passaic River National Natural Landmarks. The Great Falls of Paterson-Garret Mountain Natural National Landmark includes related resources that fall outside of the park boundary, including Garret Mountain, which, together with the Great Falls, provide an excellent illustration of the geologic formations present within the park. Three additional national natural landmarks outside the park boundary are connected to the broader story of the Great Falls of Paterson and the Passaic River. These include Troy Meadows, Great Swamp, and Riker Hill Fossil Site National Natural Landmarks.\n\nInterpretive Themes\n\nInterpretive themes are often described as the key stories or concepts that visitors should understand after visiting a park—they define the most important ideas or concepts communicated to visitors about a park unit. Themes are derived from, and should reflect, park purpose, significance, resources, and values. The set of interpretive themes is complete when it provides the structure necessary for park staff to develop opportunities for visitors to explore and relate to all park significance statements and fundamental resources and values.\n\nInterpretive themes are an organizational tool that reveal and clarify meaning, concepts, contexts, and values represented by park resources. Sound themes are accurate and reflect current scholarship and science. They encourage exploration of the context in which events or natural processes occurred and the effects of those events and processes. Interpretive themes go beyond a mere description of the event or process to foster multiple opportunities to experience and consider the park and its resources. These themes help explain why a park story is relevant to people who may otherwise be unaware of connections they have to an event, time, or place associated with the park.\n\nThe following interpretive themes have been identified for Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park:\n\n·· The Natural Beauty that Inspired and Powered a Revolution. The Great Falls in the heart of Paterson has drawn people and inspired them—both for its natural beauty and for the power and the energy that it promises.\n\n·· The Economic Vision that Shaped America. Paterson was founded on Alexander Hamilton’s vision that freedom and independence for the United States would be based in a manufacturing economy that required a diversity of talents with promises of a better life for its people.\n\n·· Innovation and Opportunity (the Power of American Manufacturing). Through diversification of industries, technological innovation, and successive waves of industry and immigration, Paterson continued to exemplify and reinvent Hamilton’s vision of a planned manufacturing center for more than two centuries.\n\n·· Race, Recreation, and Respite. While the nation struggled with issues of race and civil rights, Paterson’s Hinchliffe Stadium was home field for two Negro League baseball teams—the New York Black Yankees and New York Cubans—and a municipal sports and entertainment venue that offered respite from factory work and fostered civic pride.\n\nPart 2: Dynamic Components\n\nThe dynamic components of a foundation document include special mandates and administrative commitments and an assessment of planning and data needs. These components are dynamic because they will change over time. New special mandates can be established and new administrative commitments made. As conditions and trends of fundamental resources and values change over time, the analysis of planning and data needs will need to be revisited and revised, along with key issues. Therefore, this part of the foundation document will be updated accordingly.\n\nSpecial Mandates and Administrative Commitments\n\nMany management decisions for a park unit are directed or influenced by special mandates and administrative commitments with other federal agencies, state and local governments, utility companies, partnering organizations, and other entities. Special mandates are requirements specific to a park that must be fulfilled. Mandates can be expressed in enabling legislation, in separate legislation following the establishment of the park, or through a judicial process. They may expand on park purpose or introduce elements unrelated to the purpose of the park. Administrative commitments are, in general, agreements that have been reached through formal, documented processes, often through memorandums of agreement. Examples include easements, rights-of-way, arrangements for emergency service responses, etc. Special mandates and administrative commitments can support, in many cases, a network of partnerships that help fulfill the objectives of the park and facilitate working relationships with other organizations. They are an essential component of managing and planning for Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park.\n\nSpecial Mandates\n\n·· General Agreement to Establish and Preserve Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park. As mandated by section (b)(1)(B) of the park’s enabling legislation, the U.S. Department of the Interior (National Park Service) entered into a written agreement (see appendix B) with the City of Paterson to establish and preserve the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park, focusing on actions required prior to establishment of the park:\n\n-- Manageable Unit. The agreement addresses the requirement to acquire sufficient land or an interest in land within the boundary to constitute a manageable unit. It defines the federal land acquisition process and acquisition phase that will allow for progressive resource protection of core properties and other interests in land, as funding is available, and as due diligence requirements are satisfied. It also addresses responsibilities for maintenance and operations for lands and improvements within the park boundary, interpretation and education responsibilities, and law enforcement within the park.\n\n-- Resource Protection. The agreement addresses the requirement for non-NPS lands within the Great Falls National Historic Landmark District to be managed consistent with the enabling legislation and that future uses of lands within the district will be compatible with the park designation. It describes how the city will coordinate with the National Park Service on all major work on properties within the district. The city has further committed to several actions in support of the park, such as strengthening and enforcing its land use ordinances and design standards to protect the historic and natural resources of the district, and working with the National Park Service to foster appropriate and compatible uses and building treatments within the district.\n\n-- Land Acquisition. Congress established the park’s boundary through the enabling legislation and provided direction for federal acquisition of property within the boundary. Section (b)(4) states that at Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park, the National Park Service is authorized to acquire additional land or interests in land within the boundary of the park by donation, purchase from a willing seller with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. Lands or interest in land owned by the State of New Jersey or any political subdivision of the state may only be acquired by donation.\n\n·· Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park Advisory Commission. Section (e) of the park’s enabling legislation requires that the National Park Service establish an advisory commission to advise on development and implementation of the park’s general management plan. In accordance with this mandate, the Secretary of the Interior created the nine-member Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park Advisory Commission, to include representatives appointed by the Secretary after consideration of recommendations submitted by the governor of the state of New Jersey (4), the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Passaic County (1), and the City Council of Paterson (2), as well as individuals who are experienced with national parks and historic preservation (2). The work of the advisory commission is anticipated to be complete approximately 10 years from the date of its establishment (March 2019), at which time it will terminate.\n\n·· Hinchliffe Stadium Study. Section (f) of the park’s enabling legislation requires that the National Park Service complete a study regarding Hinchliffe Stadium for purposes of assessing (1) its potential for listing as a national historic landmark, and (2) options for maintaining the stadium’s historic integrity. In accordance with this mandate, the National Park Service completed the Hinchliffe Stadium National Historic Landmark Nomination and on February 25, 2013, the Secretary of the Interior designated the site as a national historic landmark.\n\n·· Hinchliffe Stadium Heritage Act. Public Law 113-291, Carl Levin and Howard P. “Buck” McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, expanded the park’s legislative boundary to include Hinchliffe Stadium. The law stated that the national historical park shall include the approximately 6 acres of land containing Hinchliffe Stadium and shall be administered as part of the park in accordance with subsection (c)(1) and section 3 of the Hinchliffe Stadium Heritage Act (appendix A). Restrictions were placed on acquisition so that the Secretary may not acquire fee title to Hinchliffe Stadium, but may acquire a preservation easement in Hinchliffe Stadium if the Secretary determines that doing so will facilitate resource protection of the stadium. The law stated that the fact that activities can be seen or heard from within the approximately 6 acres of land described in paragraph (1) shall not preclude such activities outside the boundary of the park. In administering the approximately 6 acres of land containing Hinchliffe Stadium…the Secretary of the Interior– (A) may not include non-federal property within the approximately 6 acres of land as part of Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park without the written consent of the owner; (B) may not acquire by condemnation any land or interests in land within the approximately 6 acres of land; and (C) shall not construe the inclusion of Hinchliffe Stadium made by this section to create buffer zones outside the boundaries of Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park.\n\nAdministrative Commitments\n\nFor more information about the existing administrative commitments for Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park, please see appendix B.\n\nAssessment of Planning and Data Needs\n\nOnce the core components of part 1 of the foundation document have been identified, it is important to gather and evaluate existing information about the park’s fundamental resources and values, and develop a full assessment of the park’s planning and data needs. The assessment of planning and data needs section presents planning issues, the planning projects that will address these issues, and the associated information requirements for planning, such as resource inventories and data collection, including GIS data.\n\nThere are three sections in the assessment of planning and data needs:\n\n1. analysis of fundamental resources and values\n\n2. identification of key issues and associated planning and data needs\n\n3. identification of planning and data needs (including spatial mapping activities or GIS maps)\n\nThe analysis of fundamental resources and values and identification of key issues leads up to and supports the identification of planning and data collection needs.\n\nAnalysis of Fundamental Resources and Values\n\nThe fundamental resource or value analysis table includes current conditions, potential threats and opportunities, planning and data needs, and selected laws and NPS policies related to management of the identified resource or value.\n\nFundamental Resource or Value (FRV)\n\nGeologic Formation and Features (GFF)\n\nFRV: Related Significance Statements\n\nGFF: The Great Falls of the Passaic River, with its natural chasm and 77-foot waterfall, provides an extraordinary scenic and geologic resource in the midst of an industrialized city and opportunities for relaxation, contemplation, and inspiration.\n\nGFF: Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park and the national historic landmark district provide one of the best opportunities to view a complete hydropower system from its source above the Great Falls of the Passaic River to its transformation into power for the mills and the surrounding community. Alexander Hamilton’s vision of a model manufacturing city, a central part of his economic strategy for the nation, is embedded in this industrial, cultural, and natural landscape.\n\nFRV: Current Conditions and Trends\n\nGFF: Conditions\n\n• The basalt is likely to lose small to large sections periodically due to expansion of water in the basalt rock joints and fractures caused by freezing and thawing, particularly during the early winter and spring.\n\n• Soils in some areas of the park may contain contamination from the previous industrial uses that encompassed much of the park at various points throughout the site’s history. Several contaminated sites within and adjacent to the park have been documented, including the former Allied Textile Printing site, which is classified as a brownfield.\n\nGFF: Trends\n\n• None identified.\n\nFRV: Threats and Opportunities\n\nGFF: Threats\n\n• Increased erosion due to flooding of the Passaic River could alter the geologic features within the park.\n\nGFF: Opportunities\n\n• Interpretive opportunities to explain the creation of the falls and its use as a source of power.\n\n• Establish monitoring programs with the U.S. Geological Survey to measure any change of movement in the chasm.\n\nFRV: Data and/or GIS Needs\n\nGFF: Cultural landscape inventory.\n\nGFF: Natural resource inventory and condition assessment.\n\nFRV: Planning Needs\n\nGFF: Resource stewardship strategy.\n\nFRV: Laws, Executive Orders, and Regulations That Apply to the FRV, and NPS Policy-level Guidance\n\nGFF: Laws, Executive Orders, and Regulations That Apply to the FRV\n\n• Paleontological Resources Preservation Act of 2009\n\n• Clean Water Act of 1972\n\n• Executive Order 11514, “Protection and Enhancement of Environmental Quality”\n\n• Executive Order 11988, “Floodplain Management”\n\n• Executive Order 12088, “Federal Compliance with Pollution Control Standards”\n\n• National Flood Insurance Act of 1968\n\nGFF: NPS Policy-level Guidance (NPS Management Policies 2006 and Director’s Orders)\n\n• NPS Management Policies 2006 (chapter 4) “Natural Resource Management”\n\n• Director’s Order 6: Interpretation and Education\n\n• Director’s Order 12: Conservation Planning, Environmental Impact Analysis, and\n\nDecision-making\n\n• Director’s Order 47: Soundscape Preservation and Noise Management\n\nFundamental Resource or Value (FRV)\n\nHydrologic Systems (HS)\n\nFRV: Related Significance Statements\n\nHS: The Great Falls of the Passaic River, with its natural chasm and 77-foot waterfall, provides an extraordinary scenic and geologic resource in the midst of an industrialized city and opportunities for relaxation, contemplation, and inspiration.\n\nHS: Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park and the national historic landmark district provide one of the best opportunities to view a complete hydropower system from its source above the Great Falls of the Passaic River to its transformation into power for the mills and the surrounding community. Alexander Hamilton’s vision of a model manufacturing city, a central part of his economic strategy for the nation, is embedded in this industrial, cultural, and natural landscape.\n\nFRV: Current Conditions and Trends\n\nHS: Conditions\n\n• The Passaic River segment that flows through the park and the sub-watershed surrounding the park supports its designated uses for agricultural water supply and industrial water supply, but does not support its designated uses for aquatic life, fish consumption, primary contact recreation, or public water supply. It is on New Jersey’s list of impaired waters.\n\n• Debris and litter in the river contribute to the water pollution and frequently collect at the base of the falls, visible from the park’s primary overlook.\n\n• A Federal Energy Regulatory Commission agreement is in place to ensure water flow over the falls in the summer months, but this agreement does not address water flow during the remainder of the year or “winter drought” issues.\n\n• Within the park, construction of river walls, raceway systems, and dams has altered the natural flow of the river, changing the location and size of the adjacent floodplain and creating floodplains along the upper, middle, and lower raceways. Today, the regulatory floodway along the river in the park varies from 200 to 500 feet in width. Adjoining the regulatory floodway is a narrow 500-year floodplain. Other areas of 100-year floodplains in the park include and adjoin the upper, middle, and lower raceways, where average flooding depths are between 1 and 3 feet.\n\nHS: Trends\n\n• Visitors are increasingly requesting more water-contact experiences in and around the falls.\n\nFRV: Threats and Opportunities\n\nHS: Threats\n\n• Recurring floods impact water quality by increasing sedimentation loads and other trash/debris.\n\n• Sewer overflows have been known to contaminate the river and contribute to the river’s listing as an impaired body of water.\n\n• Safety of visitors who use the river for recreational purposes (fishing, swimming, etc.).\n\nHS: Opportunities\n\n• Continue to work with federal, state, and local agencies and friends group to mitigate flooding and stormwater impacts.\n\n• Work in cooperation with upstream partners to maintain flow, water quality, and integrity of river waters.\n\nFRV: Data and/or GIS Needs\n\nHS: Cultural landscape inventory.\n\nHS: Monitoring for water quality and quantity.\n\nHS: Natural resource inventory and condition assessment.\n\nFRV: Planning Needs\n\nHS: Invasive species plan / vegetation management plan.\n\nHS: Resource stewardship strategy.\n\nFRV: Laws, Executive Orders, and Regulations That Apply to the FRV, and NPS Policy-level Guidance\n\nHS: Laws, Executive Orders, and Regulations That Apply to the FRV\n\n• Executive Order 11514, “Protection and Enhancement of Environmental Quality”\n\n• Executive Order 11988, “Floodplain Management”\n\n• Executive Order 12088, “Federal Compliance with Pollution Control Standards”\n\n• National Flood Insurance Program\n\n• Executive Order 13112, “Invasive Species”\n\n• Secretarial Order 3289, “Addressing the Impacts of Climate Change on America’s Water, Land, and Other Natural and Cultural Resources”\n\nHS: NPS Policy-level Guidance (NPS Management Policies 2006 and Director’s Orders)\n\n• NPS Management Policies 2006 (chapter 4) “Natural Resource Management”\n\n• Director’s Order 77-2: Floodplain Management\n\n• Special Directive 93-4, “Floodplain Management, Revised Guidelines for National Park Service Floodplain Compliance”\n\nFundamental Resource or Value (FRV)\n\nHistoric Structures, Archeological Resources, and Ruins (HSARR)\n\nFRV: Related Significance Statements\n\nHSARR: Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park and the national historic landmark district provide one of the best opportunities to view a complete hydropower system from its source above the Great Falls of the Passaic River to its transformation into power for the mills and the surrounding community.

Administration Building is in good overall condition and is structurally sound. It currently contains office and storage space and is closed to the public.\n\n• The Allied Textile Printing site ruins (composed of remnants of the former industrial mills housed on the site, its industrial landscape, and industrial artifacts) are currently gated off, closed to the public, and the site is classified as a brownfield. The site lacks direct utility supply, but city utilities run through the property. Invasive and volunteer vegetation has overwhelmed much of the site. A project is currently funded to stabilize the river wall running along the extent of the Allied Textile Printing site.\n\n• Preservation efforts have been undertaken at the Colt Gun Mill. Some sections of the former mill are in very poor condition, with some areas of the mill a total loss. The extant walls have been partially stabilized and preserved and remain reasonably intact.\n\n• The S.U.M. Steam Plant ruins include the concrete foundation, including the exterior terrace, the lower facade, and lower level foundation features. The remaining structure consists of concrete exterior walls that are below grade with the exception of the north facade. The foundation has been filled and capped with a series of flat roofs. The upper level is a small terrace where most visitors go to view the Great Falls. The terrace also includes the Alexander Hamilton statue and other smaller monuments. The lower level of the foundation is currently unused but at one time contained working public restrooms.\n\n• The Ivanhoe Wheelhouse was restored in 1981 (without the waterwheel and turbine). It now serves as a museum that exhibits work from regional artists.\n\n• Previous archeological studies have identified a number of archeological sites within the Allied Textile Printing site and around the park’s other historic structures. These intact resources focus primarily on the industrial development and history of Paterson.\n\nHSARR: Trends\n\n• Since its establishment, the park has seen an increased interest in public access to the Allied Textile Printing site.\n\nFRV: Threats and Opportunities\n\nHSARR: Threats\n\n• Vandalism and graffiti, especially in underused areas of the park (primarily the Allied Textile Printing site).\n\n• Vegetation growth in the Allied Textile Printing site could weaken the structural integrity of some of the ruins and archeological resources.\n\n• Several areas of the park fall within the regulatory floodway, 500-year floodplain, or 100- year flooplain. Flooding is a recurring problem in Paterson which threatens to accelerate weathering and deterioration of ruins as well as potentially uncover archeological resources.\n\nHSARR: Opportunities\n\n• Collaborate with partners and property owners to implement the general management plan and clean up / open areas of the park that are isolated and closed.\n\n• Continue to provide preservation assistance for properties not owned by the National Park Service.\n\nFRV: Data and/or GIS Needs\n\nHSARR: Cultural landscape inventory.\n\nHSARR: Cultural resource condition assessment.\n\nHSARR: Natural resource inventory and condition assessment.\n\nFRV: Planning Needs\n\nHSARR: Cultural landscape report.\n\nHSARR: Historic structures management plan.\n\nHSARR: Invasive species plan / vegetation management plan.\n\nHSARR: Resource stewardship strategy.\n\nHSARR: Park sustainability plan.\n\nFRV: Laws, Executive Orders, and Regulations That Apply to the FRV, and NPS Policy-level Guidance\n\nHSARR: Laws, Executive Orders, and Regulations That Apply to the FRV\n\n• Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n\n• Architectural Barriers Act of 1968\n\n• “Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities; Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Guidelines” (36 CFR 1191)\n\n• Archeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974\n\n• Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979\n\n• Museum Properties Management Act of 1955, as amended\n\n• National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended\n\n• “Protection of Historic Properties” (36 CFR 800)\n\n• Executive Order 11593, “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment”\n\n• “Curation of Federally-Owned and Administered Archaeological Collections” (36 CFR 79)\n\n• Secretarial Order 3289, “Addressing the Impacts of Climate Change on America’s Water, Land, and Other Natural and Cultural Resources”\n\nHSARR: NPS Policy-level Guidance (NPS Management Policies 2006 and Director’s Orders)\n\n• NPS Management Policies 2006 (chapter 5) “Cultural Resource Management”\n\n• NPS Management Policies 2006 (chapter 7) “Interpretation and Education”\n\n• Director’s Order 6: Interpretation and Education\n\n• Director’s Order 24: NPS Museum Collections Management\n\n• Director’s Order 28: Cultural Resource Management\n\n• Director’s Order 28A: Archeology\n\n• Director’s Order 42: Accessibility for Visitors with Disabilities in National Park Service Programs and Services\n\n• The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties\n\n• NPS Museum Handbook, parts I, II, and III\n\nFundamental Resource or Value (FRV)\n\nRaceway System (RS)\n\nFRV: Related Significance Statements\n\nRS: Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park and the national historic landmark district provide one of the best opportunities to view a complete hydropower system from its source above the Great Falls of the Passaic River to its transformation into power for the mills and the surrounding community.

A key issue focuses on a question that is important for a park. Key issues often raise questions regarding park purpose and significance and fundamental resources and values. For example, a key issue may pertain to the potential for a fundamental resource or value in a park to be detrimentally affected by discretionary management decisions. A key issue may also address crucial questions that are not directly related to purpose and significance, but that still affect them indirectly. Usually, a key issue is one that a future planning effort or data collection needs to address and requires a decision by NPS managers.\n\nThe following are key issues for Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park and the associated planning and data needs to address them:\n\n·· Implementing the General Management Plan. Implementation of the newly completed general management plan will require the completion of additional baseline documentation and plans to facilitate management decisions and strategically outline the implementation process. This baseline documentation would provide management with resource stewardship goals as the management plan actions are being implemented.\n\n-- Associated planning and data needs: Resource stewardship strategy, visitor use\n\nsurvey, historic resource study, raceway system preservation plan, long-range\n\ninterpretive plan, cultural resource condition assessment, natural resource\n\ninventory and condition assessment\n\n·· Strengthening Community Engagement. The park has an agreement with the City of Paterson to provide technical assistance to the Great Falls National Historic Landmark Historic District on preservation of their resources. In addition, the community sees the park as an economic development opportunity. Engaging adjacent private property owners, as well as business owners within the Great Falls National Historic Landmark Historic District, on issues of preservation and economic development is an important component of protecting the park’s resources and providing a high quality visitor experience. Working with neighbors to improve gateway community visitor amenities could increase visitor satisfaction and awareness of the park as well as support the local economy.\n\n-- Associated planning and data needs: Partnership strategy, visitor use survey\n\n·· Access, Circulation, and Orientation to Park Resources. Because the park has multiple entry points and sits within a large urban commercial, industrial, and residential area, getting from one place to another is often difficult for residents and visitors alike. Most visitors visit the Great Falls, but do not go to other areas of the park or the surrounding historic landmark district. Transportation to and from the park, as well as parking, can be challenging and wayfinding deficiencies add to the confusion. Opportunities for connections, partnerships, alternative transportation modes, and outreach exist, but would require coordination to holistically address the issues.\n\n-- Associated planning and data needs: Partnership strategy, visitor use survey, multimodal transportation and access plan\n\n·· Partnerships. Due to the diversity of resources within and adjacent to its boundaries, most of which will continue to be owned by state and local governments, this partnership park works with a wide variety of groups and stakeholders ranging from nonprofit organizations to federal, state, and local agencies. Lacking clear coordination strategies, the park, the City of Paterson, and other partners find it difficult to nimbly address emerging issues and opportunities while efficiently leveraging the resources and strengths of partner organizations. As a true partnership park, Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park functions at its best when all partners are coordinated and oriented toward the core mission of the park, with minimal duplication of efforts or competition among organizations.\n\n-- Associated planning and data needs: Partnership strategy\n\nPlanning and Data Needs\n\nTo maintain connection to the core elements of the foundation and the importance of these core foundation elements, the planning and data needs listed here are directly related to protecting fundamental resources and values, park significance, and park purpose, as well as addressing key issues. To successfully undertake a planning effort, information from sources such as inventories, studies, research activities, and analyses may be required to provide adequate knowledge of park resources and visitor information. Such information sources have been identified as data needs. Geospatial mapping tasks and products are included in data needs.\n\nItems considered of the utmost importance were identified as high priority, and other items identified, but not rising to the level of high priority, were listed as either medium- or lowpriority needs. These priorities inform park management efforts to secure funding and support for planning projects.\n\nPlanning Needs: Where a Decision-Making Process is Needed\n\nRelated to an FRV or Key Issue? (FRV) or (KI)\n\nPlanning Needs (PN)\n\nPriority (H, M, L)\n\nNotes (N)\n\nFRV\n\nPN: Historic structure reuse plan\n\nH\n\nN: Investigate and identify adaptive reuse alternatives for historic structures including an evaluation, cost analysis, and selection of effective strategies that protect resources and meet legal requirements.\n\nFRV\n\nPN: Key Issue Long-range interpretive plan\n\nH\n\nN: The park needs a long-range interpretive plan as a baseline document for guiding the development of an interpretive program.\n\nFRV, KI\n\nPN: Resource stewardship strategy\n\nH\n\nN: Identify and track indicators of desired conditions, recommending comprehensive strategies to achieve and maintain desired conditions over time, and assess and update these strategies periodically based on new information and the results of completed activities. (Would require completion of natural and cultural condition assessments.)\n\nKey Issue\n\nPN: Partnership strategy\n\nM\n\nN: The plan would clearly identify existing and potential partners and establish roles and responsibilities for each party.\n\nFRV\n\nPN: Cultural landscape report\n\nM\n\nN: Document, analyze, and prepare detailed treatment recommendations for park cultural landscapes.\n\nFRV\n\nPN: Historic structures management plan\n\nM\n\nN: Develop a management strategy for the rehabilitation of historic structures throughout the historic landmark historic district.\n\nFRV\n\nPN: Park sustainability plan\n\nM\n\nN: Develop a park-specific sustainability plan that supports the park purpose, integrates with park strategic documents, ensures that appropriate documentation is completed, and contributes to the overall regional sustainable buildings target and objectives.\n\nFRV, KI\n\nPN: Raceway system preservation plan\n\nM\n\nN: The general management plan calls for re-watering of the raceway system. This plan is needed to guide the rehabilitation of the raceway system.\n\nKI\n\nPN: Multimodal transportation and access plan\n\nL\n\nN: A multimodal transportation plan would assess opportunities and strategies for connecting existing and planning for new transportation systems including, but not limited to, personal vehicles, walking, bicycling, parking, and buses. The plan would emphasize pedestrian safety, multimodal equity, mobility, accessibility, quality of life, and reducing road and parking lot congestion. Appropriate and compatible multimodal access, parking, and use within the park would be defined. The plan would assess opportunities for seamless connections between adjacent communities and the park.
