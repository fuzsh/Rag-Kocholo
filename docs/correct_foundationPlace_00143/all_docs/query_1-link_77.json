The event, held at The Spinnaker Restaurant in Sausalito, welcomed nearly 100 attendees, including major donors, club presidents, foundation chairs, and devoted advocates of The Rotary Foundation.\n\nWe were honored to have Past Rotary International President and Chair of The Rotary Foundation, Barry Rassin, as our keynote speaker. Barryâs inspiring words and heartfelt gratitude set the tone for the evening. Joining him Zones 26/27 Director-Elect, Wyn Spiller who also extended her thanks to our generous donors, as well as Tabitha Sparks, Major Gift Officer for Rotary International.\n\nRotary Foundation \"Stars\" Create Night to Remeber Laine Hendricks 2024-07-03 07:00:00Z 0 Major Donors,The Rotary Foundation\n\nTwo Clubs Unite to be a Force for Community Service\n\nIn a powerful demonstration of unity and dedication to service, the San Rafael Evening and Marin Evening Rotary Clubs have merged to form the new San Rafael Marin Evening Rotary Club. With nearly 50 years of combined Rotary experience, the newly formed club is poised to continue and expand its impactful work in Marin communities and beyond.\n\nThe former Marin Evening Rotary Club was originally chartered in 1985 and was the first Rotary Club in Marin to hold regular membership meetings at night. San Rafael Evening Rotary Club chartered in 2014 was known as the young professionalsâ club, often attracting graduates from Dominican University of California. Over the past six months, the two clubs determined that joining forces would foster greater collaboration and a higher-level support that would benefit the local community.\n\nTwo Clubs Unite to be a Force for Community Service Laine Hendricks 2024-07-02 07:00:00Z 0 Rotary Club of Marin Evening,Rotary Club of San Rafael Marin Evening,San Rafael Evening Rotary Club\n\nGovernor's Message - July 2024\n\nWelcome to our new Rotary Year â and it is always exciting as we have new leadership that comes with fresh energy, new ideas, great passion and the eternal optimism that defines Rotarians.

The effort to launch this club took five years, and Marilyn went on to serve multiple leadership roles including two times as Club President.\n\nMarilyn creates joy and laughter anytime she is around people and excels at getting all of us to maximize our three Tâs: Time, Talent, and Treasure. Her keen eye for fashion and fundraising for the community locally and internationally has materialized in her Club fashion shows which keep getting bigger and better every year. She has even inspired other Rotary clubs to participate in a fashion show.\n\nRotarian of the Month - July 2024 Dora Dye 2024-06-21 07:00:00Z 0 District Rotarian of the Month,Rotarian of the Month,Rotary Club of San Francisco Sunset\n\nRecap: Better Together District Conference\n\nOur Annual District Conference, held from May 17 to 19, 2024, at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada, was an extraordinary event! This Multi-District Conference brought together Districts 5150, 5180, and 5190 â more than 550 people! â under the extravaganza theme \"Better Together\". And indeed, we were better together!\n\nA Grand Kickoff\n\nAfter 18 months of meticulous planning by Mary Liu (San Francisco), our district conference chair, and the dedicated co-chairs from districts 5180 and 5190âJanice Gage, Tina Spencer, and Steve Snyderâthe \"Better Together\" multi-district conference was finally here! Excitement was palpable as we gathered to witness the fruition of their hard work.\n\nThe conference kickoff on Friday, May 17, began with the prestigious Major Donor Reception, honoring those who donated $10,000 or more to The Rotary Foundation. We were graced by the presence of Rotary International President (RIP) Gordon McInally and his wife Heather, elevating the evening's grandeur.\n\nRecap: Better Together District Conference Mary Liu 2024-06-12 07:00:00Z 0 District Conference\n\nGovernor's Message - June 2024\n\nGreetings, Rotarians and Friends:\n\nWow! June already? Itâs true â time stops for no one. But, as it marches on, so does Rotary.\n\nReflecting on the past 11 months, I am filled with pride for the tremendous effort our more than 1,600 members contributed to impact lives in communities near and far. We've seen countless service projects, millions of dollars invested in global grants, a growing interest in vocational service and personal-professional development, reinvigorated Interact clubs, and growing Rotaract membership. New records in giving to The Rotary Foundation and enhanced public image efforts are just some highlights. The impact of these achievements will be felt well into the future.\n\nGovernor's Message - June 2024 Laine Hendricks 2024-06-12 07:00:00Z 0 District Governor,District Governor's Monthly Message\n\n2024 Club Excellence Awards Honorees\n\nCongratulations to all of our honorees for the 2023-24 Club Excellence Awards program. These honors serve as a guide for Rotary Clubs to strive for excellence as they create new and better ways of providing service both locally and globally. Awards are given in 8 categories, which measure different functions of each club, from outward service to our communities, administration and management, raising Rotary's visibility, engaging with future leaders, and ensuring our members have a fulfilling experience. In addition, a \"Best Club\" award is available to clubs that earn points across multiple categories, demonstrating a vibrant and successful club.\n\nThis year, 29 clubs earned recognition. Awards were presented at the 2024 Better Together District Conference in Reno, Nevada.\n\n2024 Club Excellence Awards Honorees Laine Hendricks 2024-06-01 07:00:00Z 0 Club Excellence Awards,District Conference\n\nMental Health Matters: A Year of Focus and Success\n\nRotary District 5150: A Year of Mental Health Focus and Success\n\nAs we conclude another Rotary year, it's time to reflect on our journey and celebrate the impactful work accomplished in Rotary District 5150. This year, inspired by the visionary leadership of Rotary International President Gordon McInally, we focused on a critical and often overlooked area: mental health.\n\nEmbracing President McInally's Vision\n\nPresident McInally emphasized the importance of mental health, encouraging us to break down stigmas, raise awareness, and provide support to those in need. His dedication to this cause resonated deeply within our district, and we are proud to have embraced his vision wholeheartedly. By prioritizing mental health, we have taken significant steps toward creating a more understanding and supportive community.\n\nMental Health Matters: A Year of Focus and Success Jenny Bates 2024-06-01 07:00:00Z 0 Mental Health\n\nRotarian of the Month - June 2024\n\nCongratulations to Johwell Saint-Cilien of the Rotary Club for Global Action for being selected as Rotary District 5150's Rotarian of the Month for June 2024! Johwell is a founding member of the Rotary Club for Global Action. Raised in Paris, France, by his Haitian mother, he pursued his dream of filmmaking by moving to New York City. He arrived just days before 9/11 and was lucky to survive as he ran out of Tower One after the planes hit. Such a traumatic experience gave him a perspective on life and living that few of us have. He has gone on to connect and build community in ways beyond his imagination, including a documentary on his friend turned Congressional Representative Jamaal Bowman. In the years following, his focus on community activism included partnering with a successful creative arts youth program known as \"Kids Helping Kids: A Hip Hop Experience\" as well as a curriculum for NegusWorld Youth which consists of connecting students with their peers in different parts of the country or the world.\n\nIn 2014, he co-founded the Negus WorldWide Party, a global event that raises funds and awareness to support groups benefiting children. With Johwellâs leadership, the Negus WorldWide Party partnered with the Rotary Club for Global Action to raise over $18,000 to support the education of girls in Liberia with the Gbowee Peace Foundation. Though we were in the middle of the COVID pandemic, his strong network and infectious enthusiasm brought a global community together, including Rotary senior leaders (then incoming RI President Jennifer Jones), rock stars (Pete Townsend of The Who), luminaries (Gloria Steinem), Nobel Laureates, actors, and activists (US Congressman Jamaal Bowman) over Zoom to make a difference.\n\nRotarian of the Month - June 2024 Dora Dye 2024-05-25 07:00:00Z 0 District Rotarian of the Month,Rotarian of the Month,Rotary Club for Global Action\n\nMental Health Matters: Awareness Month\n\nMay is Mental Health Awareness Month andâ¦ we asked, you answered.

We want to raise awareness about Rotaryâs efforts in mental wellness, break down stigma, and support public education. Let's engage in open conversations, foster empathy, and share resources to help individuals and families on their path to mental wellness. In addition, consider attending our two District-sponsored mental health events planned for May 9 in Kentfield or May 10 in Redwood City.\n\nGovernor's Message - May 2024 Laine Hendricks 2024-05-06 07:00:00Z 0 District Governor,District Governor's Monthly Message\n\nNovato Evening Charters as the Newest Club in District 5150!\n\nOur Rotary Family has grown! We are so pleased to share that District 5150's newest addition is the Rotary Club of Novato Evening! While the club officially chartered February 9, they held a formal charter party on April 6 at McInnis Golf Club in Marin County. Nearly 100 people -- friends, family, and Rotarians from across the District -- were in attendance to witness mass member induction and officer installation by Governor Hendricks. In addition, State Senator Damon Connolly attended and provided some welcoming remarks before Charter President, Gregory Crabtree, was handed his gavel to officially \"ring the bell\" on this new chapter in Novato Evening's legacy.\n\nNovato Evening Charters as the Newest Club in District 5150!

Mike is the last remaining, founding member of his Club and has been a Rotarian since June 1, 1987.

He has demonstrated his passion and commitment to serving others both professionally and as a Rotarian. For 59 years, he was a surgeon in the military, in the public health sector, and at Marin General Hospital. As a Rotarian, he was instrumental in bringing RotaCare, a free medical clinic, to Marin Countyâs underserved and uninsured residents 26 years ago.

Many individuals hesitate to seek help due to fear of judgment or lack of access to resources. This is where our role as Rotarians becomes pivotal. By raising awareness, fostering understanding, and providing support, we can break down barriers and create inclusive communities where everyone feels valued and supported.\n\nThis month, the Mental Health Rotarian Action Group of District 5150 is challenging each and every Rotarian and Rotary Club to make a difference by supporting mental health initiatives. We invite all Rotarians to join us in commemorating Mental Health Awareness Month this May. Share your ideas, events, and initiatives with us and we will feature them in our May newsletter entry. Together, let's make a difference in the lives of individuals and families affected by mental health challenges.\n\nMental Health Matters: A Challenge to Clubs Jenny Bates 2024-04-01 07:00:00Z 0 Mental Health\n\nRotarian of the Month - April 2024\n\nCongratulations to Ken Lai of the Rotary Club of San Francisco West for being selected as Rotary District 5150's Rotarian of the Month for April 2024!

Consider this: Just as blooming flowers capture our attention and signal the arrival of a new season, a positive Rotary Club public image can serve as a beacon, drawing the communityâs gaze toward the impactful work Rotary club members undertake. Active participation in public image efforts is crucial for Rotary Clubs as it enhances the credibility and visibility of clubs, influences membership attraction and retention efforts, and can help garner support for The Rotary Foundation.\n\nGovernor's Message - March 2024 Laine Hendricks 2024-03-08 08:00:00Z 0 District Governor,District Governor's Monthly Message\n\nRotarian of the Month - March 2024\n\nCongratulations to Betsy Koefoed of the Rotary Club of San Carlos for being selected as Rotary District 5150's Rotarian of the Month for March 2024!

Established in 2002, the program selects a diverse group of talented individuals from around the world to participate in a fully-funded master's degree or professional certificate program in peace studies at one of the Rotary Peace Centers hosted by leading universities. The fellows undergo intensive academic training, gain practical experience through fieldwork, and engage in collaborative research to develop the skills necessary for promoting peace and addressing complex global issues. Emphasizing the Rotary values of service, fellowship, and ethical leadership, the Peace Fellows program is committed to fostering a network of professionals dedicated to making a positive impact in conflict-affected areas and contributing to sustainable peace worldwide.\n\nHelp Connect Local Peace Builders with the Rotary Peace Fellows Program Bob Kuchem 2024-02-02 08:00:00Z 0 Peace and Conflict Prevention\n\nMental Health Matters: Recognizing Signs of Struggling Mental Health\n\nCreating Hope in the World: Recognizing Signs of Struggling Mental Health\n\nWhen Rotary President Gordon McInally called upon us to \"Create Hope in the World,\" Rotarians enthusiastically embarked on various initiatives to make a positive impact. Addressing mental health within the scope of Rotary's mission is crucial, as fostering a supportive and caring community involves recognizing the signs of mental health struggles.

This allowed the Rotary Club of San Rafael Evening to continue fulfilling its commitment to consistently provide, make, and pack lunches for the St. Vincent de Paul Society to distribute those in need. Today, her Club is able to continue making and packing even more lunches.\n\nWhen needed, Erika did not hesitate to help organize her Club's Holiday Party.\n\nHer Club's team in the Rotaplast Bocce Ball Tournament was short staffed, and Erika recruited one of her co-workers to help out.\n\nRotarian of the Month - February 2024 Dora Dye 2024-01-21 08:00:00Z 0 District Rotarian of the Month,Rotarian of the Month,San Rafael Evening Rotary Club\n\nMental Health Matters: Stigma Busting\n\nStigma Busting\n\nOne day in April, I came home from high school and my world was forever changed. âMom, why do you have aluminum foil wrapped around your head?â My mother, who just months prior worked two jobs as a nurseâs aid, was now relegated to sitting on the couch for most of the days preventing government rays from penetrating her body.\n\nAt 14, reaching out desperately to family members and church members I was only met with apathy or disdain, told âSheâs just tired, overworkedâ and that I was overreacting.\n\nWe didnât talk about mental illness back then. The words, âmental illnessâ did not exist in the community vocabulary. There were other words like âcrazyâ or âinsane.â Words that created shame, resentment, and animosity.\n\nMental Health Matters: Stigma Busting Tashaki Ford 2024-01-01 08:00:00Z 0 Mental Health\n\nGovernor's Message - January 2024\n\nHappy New Year, Rotary Family!\n\nItâs a new year, and with that, the chance to chart a path toward new opportunities in life (and Rotary).\n\nJanuary is Rotaryâs Vocational Service Month.

Iâm so proud of your collective efforts thus far.\n\nNow is the time to revisit the goals your club (or your club leadership) set at the beginning of the year. Take the time to celebrate successes, analyze progress, but also adjust â identifying obstacles and opportunities for refinement to reach unmet goals-- for the remainder of the year.

People who already live with a mental health condition should take extra care to tend to their overall health and wellness during this time.\n\nThe âholiday bluesâ can stem from a variety of sources, such as current events, personal grief, loneliness, health challenges, economic concerns, separation from family members, loss of a loved one, or relationship issues like separation or divorce.\n\nMental Health Matters: Dealing with the Holiday Blues Joe Teresi 2023-12-04 08:00:00Z 0 Mental Health\n\nRotarian of the Month - December 2023\n\nCongratulations to Linda Jonas of the Rotary Club of Pacifica for being selected as Rotary District 5150's Rotarian of the Month for December 2023!

Allen Ng has been a Rotarian since 2008. During those years he has served in many positions including Past President in 2016-17, current Club Treasurer since 2017, Club Board member, Chair of the Foundation Board, and an active participant in countless fundraising projects.\n\nAs Chair of the Youth Services Committee, Allen was instrumental in initiating many youth service projects on behalf of Marin Evening Rotary. Allen sponsored numerous scholarships for students. In the past 18 months, two of those students graduated from college and started their careers. Allen gathered and distributed dictionaries to Venetia Valley, San Pedro, and Verde Elementary Schools. Before, during, and after the Pandemic, Allen served as a camp counselor for the Rotary Youth Leadership Academy camp (RYLA) mentoring our leaders of the future.\n\nFor 26 years, Marin Evening Rotary has been giving the Nicholas Green Award to a student at Bodega Bay School who has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to service. This award was in memory of Nicholas Green, a former student of the school who was killed in a robbery attempt while traveling with his parents in Italy. His parents immediately donated his organs, opening the door to an organ donor program in Italy.\n\nRotarian of the Month - November 2023 Dora Dye 2023-10-26 07:00:00Z 0 District Rotarian of the Month,Rotarian of the Month,Rotary Club of Marin Evening\n\nDistrict Leadership Visits Headquarters in Evanston\n\nEvery few years, District 5150 sends members of the Governor Line to Rotary International Headquarters to meet with key staff and leaders to be briefed on the latest information and bring back new knowledge and resources to help our clubs.

If youâve never experienced depression, you are rare. What medical research tells us is that depression is widespread and should not be stigmatized. New statistics note that mental health issues including depression affect at least 32.4% of the worldâs population. But what is it, exactly? And how can we keep from getting depressed?\n\nDepression is a prevalent and often misunderstood mental health condition that affects millions of adults worldwide. It can be debilitating, but with the right knowledge and support, it is manageable. It is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, and a range of physical and emotional symptoms.\n\nMental Health Matters: Real Talk about Depression Mikol Davis 2023-10-01 07:00:00Z 0 Mental Health\n\nGovernor's Message - October 2023\n\nHappy October, Rotary family:\n\nItâs hard to believe that one-fourth of this Rotary year has already flown by. And yet, as I look over the last three months, Iâm so heartened by how much our clubs have accomplished already. Paramount among those examples is the recent collaboration for the California Coastal Clean-Up Day. 20 Rotary Clubs and 3 Interact Clubs participated and helped remove garbage to help protect our beautiful coastlines and local neighborhoods. Thank you to all of the volunteers who participated.\n\nGovernor's Message - October 2023 Laine Hendricks 2023-10-01 07:00:00Z 0 District Governor,District Governor's Monthly Message\n\nConnect and Collaborate: California Coastal Clean Up!\n\nOn September 23, 21 local Rotary Clubs and 3 Interact Clubs joined forces with other local volunteers to participate in the California Coastal Clean-Up Day, a statewide clean-up effort sponsored by the California Coastal Commission. While the event was originally created in the 80s to help clean up California beaches, its expanded to help with trash removal from Californiaâs bays and waterways, too â all which help keep garbage and pollutants out of our ocean.\n\nConnect and Collaborate: California Coastal Clean Up! 2023-10-01 07:00:00Z 0 Collaboration,Protecting The Environment\n\nThe Quest to End Polio Begins with You\n\nRecently, I was invited to speak to a group of about 40 college Freshmen and share information on Rotary and Rotaract programs. During my talk, I asked how many of them had heard of the word âPolio.â\n\nOnly seven students raised their hands.\n\nThe fact that Polio is becoming less and less known among younger generations is a testament to the remarkable and monumental public health initiative that helped remove Polio from the United States and all but two countries in the world. This is thanks to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative backed by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, Rotary International and countless volunteers to help immunize children and track the virus's presence.\n\nThe Quest to End Polio Begins with You Laine Hendricks 2023-10-01 07:00:00Z 0 End Polio,Polio Immunization Program,Polio Plus\n\nRotarian of the Month - October 2023\n\nCongratulations to Paul Chin of the Rotary Club of San Francisco Chinatown for being selected as Rotary District 5150's Rotarian of the Month for October 2023!

This is a topic is crucial to have within Rotary as nobody is immune from experiencing the effects of mental illness and/or addiction. Many of us know someone such as a friend, family member, co-worker or even a Rotarian that has attempted or died by suicide. The disease does not discriminate, and to prevent it, neither can we.\n\nThis month, we encourage everyone to take a little time to educate and increase awareness of the signs of someone at risk for suicide and the resources available to help those who are struggling.\n\nMental Health Matters: Suicide Awareness Henry Choi 2023-09-01 07:00:00Z 0 Mental Health,Recovery\n\nRotarian of the Month - September 2023\n\nCongratulations to Joe Brennan of the Rotary Club of Half Moon Bay for being selected as Rotary District 5150's Rotarian of the Month for September 2023!

Each month, Joe works with one or two other Club members to purchase and pack approximately $80 worth of household necessities for eight identified families.\n\nRotarian of the Month - September 2023 Dora Dye 2023-08-16 07:00:00Z 0 District Rotarian of the Month,Rotarian of the Month,Rotary Club of Half Moon Bay\n\nRotary Establishes Maui Fires Relief Fund\n\nEarlier this week, horrible fires fueled by a dry summer and strong winds from Hurricane Dora overtook the island paradise of Maui, Hawaii. The historic town of Lahaina has been left to rubble. The fires have already claimed the lives of more than 50 people and have become the state's deadliest natural disaster since 1960. Its also the deadliest U.S. wildfire since the 2018 Camp Fire which devastated the community of Paradise, California. Hawaiian Governor, Josh Green, estimates it will take billions of dollars to rebuild all of the communities affected and there is an urgent need to house thousands of people who have lost their homes to the blaze.\n\nRotarians are People of Action and the Rotary members of Hawaii (District 5000) have created a fund to help with the relief and rebuilding effort.

Mental illness and emotional wellness can be difficult topics for anyone to discuss, and I know that there are some places in the Rotary world where those conversations are especially difficult.\n\nBut we have so much to gain by helping each other address mental health and wellness more openly. As we come out of a global pandemic that forced many to experience hardship and isolation, so many of us and the people we serve are experiencing lasting challenges to our emotional well-being that we cannot handle alone. As Rotary members, we have a unique ability to reach out to people who may have no other access to this kind of care. And as an organization built on friendship and service, we can help guide our fellow Rotary members in a trusting, caring manner. All of us can serve our communities by engaging openly in discussions about mental health and wellness and establishing a solid foundation for preventative and interventional measures in your area.\n\nThe Importance of Prioritizing Mental Health and Well-Being Gordon McInally 2023-07-24 07:00:00Z 0 Mental Health,Rotary International President\n\nMental Health Matters: Soul Exhaustion\n\nRotary International President, Gordon McInally, has inspired us to think about Creating Hope in the World and we can do so by ensuring we are practicing caring for ourselves and others this Rotary year.

In Rotary, Rotaract and Interact, that may be the case: a change in leadership, new club officers, or maybe a new club program or focus. A new year is a good reason to âresolveâ to improve in an area of growth, whether driven by self-reflection or a collective goal shared by many. Continuous improvement is a healthy mindset for every person and organization.\n\nWhile a new year often signals transition, it does not mean we have to abandon the foundation that makes our clubs who they are. In fact, we should build upon the foundation and progress made by our outgoing leaders and the leaders and members who have helped us get to where we are today. Continuity in terms of working together year after year to reach long term goals is what helps clubs be vibrant and healthy.\n\nDistrict Governor Message - July 2023 Laine Hendricks 2023-07-01 07:00:00Z 0 District Governor,District Governor's Monthly Message\n\n2024 Rotary Foundation Fundraiser Cruise\n\nGreetings!

Fellowship is an integral part of your Rotary experience.\n\nRotary Fellowship:\n\nEnables Rotarians to make lasting friendships within their own club, district, country, or globally.\n\nContributes to the advancement of Rotary's public image and identity\n\nServes as an incentive for joining Rotary and for continuing as a member\n\nRotary International also has a large variety of Rotary Fellowship programs, which are international, independently organized groups of Rotarians, Rotary partners, and Rotaractors who share a common recreational interest or vocation. This month recognizes the opportunity to have fun, make new friends around the world and enhance the experience of Rotary that belonging to a Rotary Fellowship enables.\n\nRotary Fellowships began informally in 1928 when a group of Rotarians with an interest in Esperanto joined together. In 1947, Rotarians organized a group of boating enthusiasts, which became the Yachting Fellowship. This joining together to share common interests and activities gained attention and operated over the years under various names as World Fellowship Activities; International Vocational Contact Groups; Rotary Recreational and Vocational Fellowships; and finally Rotary Fellowships.\n\nFellowship activities vary widely. Some groups come together around hobbies or special interests. Others are based on common vocations. Some Fellowships are purely social, while others use their fellowship for service projects. To learn more about the many fellowship programs available to you, go to www.rotary.org/fellowships\n\nRotary provides us with an extraordinary opportunity to help the world one person at a time. It also provides us as Rotarians an opportunity to bond together as a fraternity who believe in âService Above Self.â It has truly helped me personally when times were tough, and I hope it will be a support to you. We truly are, as our Past District Governor Mary Bates used as her theme, part of a âRotary Chosen Family.â\n\nThank you for âbeing the changeâ you wish to see in your communities (and in yourselves!).\n\nYours in Rotary,\n\nGary Chow\n\nGovernor, 2022-2023\n\nRotary International\n\nDistrict 5150\n\nDistrict Governor Message - June 2023 2023-06-02 07:00:00Z 0 District Governor,District Governor's Monthly Message\n\nDistrict Governor Message - May 2023\n\nGreetings 5150 Rotarians,\n\nMay is Rotary Youth Services Month.\n\nIn 1949, the Rotary International Board adopted the slogan \"Every Rotarian an Example to Youth\" as an expression of commitment to children and youth in each community in which Rotary clubs exist. Serving young people has long been an important part of the Rotary program.\n\nYouth service projects take many forms around the world. Besides the programs that we are all familiar with, including Interact, Rotaract, RYLA, Rotary Youth Exchange and Youth Scholarships, Rotarians also sponsor Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops, athletic teams, centers for disabled children, school safety patrols, summer camps, orphanages, recreation areas, safe driving clinics, county fairs, child-care centers, and children's hospitals. Many clubs provide vocational counselling, establish youth employment programs, and promote the use of The 4-Way Test. Increasingly, drug/alcohol abuse prevention and AIDS awareness projects are being supported by Rotarians.\n\nIn every instance, Rotarians have an opportunity to be role models and mentors for the young people of their community. One learns to serve by observing others. As our youth grow to become adult leaders, it is hoped each will achieve that same desire and spirit to serve future generations.\n\nIt is the responsibility of each Rotarian to prepare the New Generationsâall young people up to the age of 30âby improving their life skills to ensure a better future, while recognizing the diversity of their needs. All clubs are encouraged to undertake projects that support the fundamental needs of the New Generations: health, human values, education, and self-development.\n\nFundamental to all Youth Service activities is our commitment to creating and maintaining the safest possible environment for all participants in Rotary activities. It is the duty of all Rotarians, Rotariansâ spouses, partners, and any other volunteers to safeguard to the best of their ability the welfare of, and to prevent the physical, sexual, or emotional abuse of, children and young people with whom they come into contact. Please refer to our Youth Protection Guidelines (District 5150 Guidelines for Rotarians When Working with Youth) on our District website to learn the simple steps you need to follow to protect our youth.\n\nThank you for being the change you wish to see in our youth.

Every day mothers risk their lives giving birth, and millions of children die each year from treatable, preventable causes. At least 6 million children under the age of 5 die each year due to malnutrition, poor health care, and inadequate sanitationâall of which can be prevented. To help reduce this rate, Rotary provides immunizations and antibiotics to babies, improves access to essential medical services, and supports trained health care providers for mothers and their children. Rotaryâs projects ensure sustainability by empowering the local community to take ownership of health care training programs.\n\nAlthough most of our efforts are focused in developing countries, these challenges exist right here in the United States, which has the highest mortality rate of any high resource country. The U.S. is the only countryâoutside of Afghanistan and Sudanâwhere the rate is rising.\n\nYour club can address these issues by advocating for increased access to:\n\nSupport for working mothers\n\nPre-natal/postpartum education\n\nMaternal Mental Health Services (the most common complication of birth)\n\nAffordable childcare\n\nRotary makes high-quality health care available to vulnerable mothers and children, so they can live longer and grow stronger.\n\nThank you for being the change you wish to see in your communities!\n\nYours in Rotary,\n\nGary Chow\n\nGovernor, 2022-2023\n\nRotary International\n\nDistrict 5150\n\nDistrict Governor Message - April 2023 2023-04-06 07:00:00Z 0 District Governor,District Governor's Monthly Message\n\nDistrict Governor Message - March 2023\n\nDear District 5150 Rotarians,\n\nMarch is Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Month. Clean water is a basic need for human beings. When people, especially children, have access to clean water, they live healthier and more productive lives. However, at least 3,000 children die each day from diseases caused by unsafe water, which is what motivates our members to build wells, install rainwater harvesting systems, and teach community members how to maintain new infrastructure.\n\nWhile very few people die of thirst, millions die from preventable waterborne diseases, providing the impetus for our members to also improve sanitation facilities in undeveloped countries. Members start by providing toilets and latrines that flush into a sewer or safe enclosure and then add education programs to promote handwashing and other good hygiene habits to create greater and longer-lasting change.\n\nThese same hygiene principles also apply here at home, where handwashing is one of our major defenses against COVID, Influenza, RSV, the common cold, and a host of other diseases.

Will you and your club join the effort to find the persons we need?\n\nRotary Peace Fellowships are designed for non-Rotarians who already have some experience in peace building and/or conflict resolution. For example: former Peace Corps volunteers, social workers, doctors and nurses, police and military veterans, teachers, etc. Since the program began in 2002, the Rotary Peace Centers have trained more than 1,500 fellows who now work in over 115 countries. Many serve as leaders in governments, NGOs, education and research institutions, peacekeeping and law enforcement agencies, and international organizations like the United Nations and the World Bank.\n\nCalling All Rotary Peace Center Fellow Candidates Jonathan Nicolas 2022-11-29 08:00:00Z 0\n\nRounding Up Emails\n\nThe number of emails that crowd our inboxes is sometimes overwhelming. And the inevitable result is that many people ignore most of them, running the risk of missing important information. The Rotary Club of Tiburon-Belvedere decided to do something about it by collecting all the Rotary announcements and putting them in a weekly email, giving members a chance to stay informed by reading just one message from Rotary on the same day each week.\n\nRounding Up Emails Judy Wilson 2022-11-28 08:00:00Z 0 Email\n\nShelterBox USA Awarded the 2022 Peace Prize from United Nations Association\n\nThe United Nations Association of Santa Barbara and Tri-Counties Chapter has awarded the 2022 Peace Prize to ShelterBox USA in acknowledgment of its humanitarian work conducted in the worldâs most extreme conflict and disaster zones. The award, presented annually, honors an organization that advances the causes of peace, human rights, and humanitarian aid globally.\n\nShelterBox accepted the honor with profound gratitude and great humility on October 24, which is United Nations Day. In an October 29 letter to ShelterBox supporters, the organization's President Kerry Murray wrote, \"It is an award that speaks to our highest aspirations of a world with peace and stability.\"\n\nShelterBox USA Awarded the 2022 Peace Prize from United Nations Association Jonathan Nicolas 2022-10-31 07:00:00Z 0\n\nWine and Fellowship\n\nDoes the thought of swirl, sniff, sip and spit excite you? If so, youâre probably a wine connoisseur and will be pleased to learn that District 5150âs Wine Appreciation Fellowship is back. Past District Governors, Jeri Fujimoto, Riki Intner and Brian McLeran are spearheading its revival and planning four gatherings over the next year for like-minded Rotarians to focus on specific wines, discuss their characteristics and quality, and learn about different varietals and wine-producing regions.\n\nWine and Fellowship Judy Wilson 2022-10-12 07:00:00Z 0\n\nLearn How to Combat Human Trafficking\n\nHuman trafficking is a cruel crimeâone that exploits vulnerable people for profit without any concern for their humanity. Itâs the second largest criminal activity in the world, with only illegal drugs exceeding it, and itâs growing. The United Nationsâ International Labor Organization estimates that 27.6 million people are subject to forced labor, and 3.3 million of them are children. It might be forced work, which is essentially modern-day slavery, or sexual exploitation, and itâs everywhere: in our own communities as well as countries that are far away. The ILO reports that more than half of all cases are in wealthier countries and calls for an international effort to address and solve the problem. Rotarians can help by learning how to recognize human trafficking, finding ways to prevent it and aiding its victims.\n\nTo give people a greater understanding of the issue and ways to combat it, Rotary Zones 26 and 27, which are comprised of 30 districts in the western United States and British Columbia, Canada, are hosting a joint virtual and in-person People of Action Summit on human trafficking at San Diegoâs Liberty Conference Center on Sat., Oct. 1. It will give participants the opportunity to learn from experts and develop action plans and playbooks for their clubs, providing them with strategies for protecting their families and communities from this heinous crime.\n\nLearn How to Combat Human Trafficking Judith Wilson 2022-09-12 07:00:00Z 0 Human Trafficking\n\nDistrict Governor Message - September 2022\n\nGreetings District 5150 Rotarians,\n\nSeptember is Basic Education and Literacy Month. We know that these skills are essential for reducing poverty, improving health, encouraging community and economic development, and promoting peace. Yet in many urban areas, even our own S.F. Bay Area, many underserved and at-risk children are not meeting basic education standards. In 2019, before the pandemic upended instruction, only 35% of 4th graders met the standards for reading proficiency set by the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\n\nDistrict Governor Message - September 2022 2022-09-04 07:00:00Z 0 District Governor,District Governor's Monthly Message\n\nWalk in Their Shoes: Polio & Abilities Awareness Expo\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only two polio-endemic countries (nations that have never interrupted the transmission of wild poliovirus). So when the idea of promoting a local polio and abilities awareness program came to be, little did District 5150 organizers know that suddenly the U.S. would be thrust back into the conversation. Since 1979, no cases of wild polio have originated in this country. Then on July 21, a young adult with Polio paralysis was confirmed in Rockland County, and on August 4, Polio is found spreading in Rockland County wastewater.\n\n\"Walk in Their Shoes\" is the polio and disability awareness expo being held on Sunday, October 23, 2022, from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. at Lander Hall on the Touro University campus in Vallejo. Sponsored by Sanofi and PDG Russ and Kathy Ketron, the interactive experience will allow attendees to see what it is like to have accessibility challenges. The expo will also feature post-polio syndrome education as well as other helpful resources.\n\nScheduled speakers include:\n\nDr. Michael Greenberg, Sanofi Pasteur, Poliomyelitis and Importance of Childhood Vaccinations\n\nDr. Carol Vandenakker Albanese, U.C. Davis, Post-Polio Syndrome Update\n\nRuss and Kathy Ketron, Polio Survivor and Rotary International District 5150 PolioPlus Chair\n\nBob Rogers, Polio Survivor and Rotary International PolioPlus Chair\n\nSarah Sweitzer, PhD, Provost, Touro University Medical School\n\nFor more information and to register, please click here: https://rotarydistrict5150.regfox.com/polio-alternate-page\n\nWalk in Their Shoes: Polio &amp; Abilities Awareness Expo Jonathan Nicolas 2022-09-02 07:00:00Z 0 End Polio\n\nJoin Us on California Coastal Cleanup Day, September 17\n\nAll Rotary clubs in District 5150 are invited to participate in the 38th Annual California Coastal Cleanup Day, Saturday, September 17, 2022, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon as one of the Districtâs Community Service events.\n\nSince the start of California Coastal Cleanup Day in 1985, over 1 million Californians have removed over 20 million pounds of trash and recyclables from our stateâs beaches, lakes, and waterways.

Harry joined Peninsula Starlight in 2020 (only a year after its chartering) and immediately set about to widen the scope and impact of the new club. Whether it was organizing a street clean-up in the Tenderloin or a beach clean-up in San Mateo, Harry led the charge. Whether distributing PPE or rallying against hate crimes against the Asian-Pacific Islander community, Harry was in the front row. Harryâs other accomplishments included planting trees, feeding the homeless, and spearheading a first-time club effort to fund Alzheimer's research.\n\nRotarian of the Month - September 2022 Dora Dye 2022-08-16 07:00:00Z 0 District Rotarian of the Month,Rotarian of the Month,Rotary Club of Peninsula Starlight\n\nTaking Steps to Eradicate Polio\n\nA group of Rotarians will be seeing Italy the old-fashioned way in Septemberâon foot, on a 340-mile trek along the Via Francisco from Firenze (Florence) to Assisi to Rome, following the footsteps of St. Francis of Assisi. Rotarians from the Rotary Club for Global Action and the E-Club of District 5190 in northeastern California and northern Nevada will join members of the Rotary Club of Firenze Sud and the Rotary Club of Firenze Valdisieve for the journey.

This September, Zones 26 and 27, which are comprised of 30 districts in the western United States and British Columbia, including District 5150, invite Rotarians to take action and learn more about specific areas of the environment in three People of Action summits. All take place on Saturday, September 10, and are virtual, while two have in-person options as well, giving Rotarians throughout the west a choice of ways to gain new knowledge that they can use to direct their efforts to improve the environment in effective ways.\n\nPeople of Action Take on the Environment Judith Wilson 2022-08-09 07:00:00Z 0 Protecting The Environment\n\nTeam PIPR is Looking to Grow\n\nAre you a wiz at creating a beautiful flyer?

When he was subsequently selected as the District Governor for 2010-2011, he asked his Rotarian wife and long-time business partner, Betsy, to take the reins on this promise and bring it to fruition into District 5150.\n\nAfter considerable research into Rotary-based trainings, it was determined that Potential Rotary Leaders Seminars (PRLS), as developed in Rotary District 5240, had the âbonesâ of the training they wanted to bring to 5150. Wanting to experience the training at its source, Betsy, Michael Ford, and Bob Pope (initially chosen faculty members) drove down to Santa Maria, CA once a month to actually take the PRLS training in District 5240. Having themselves then graduated from PRLS, Betsy, as the designated 5150 PRLS Founder and Director, set up a faculty training program and the date for the first Basic PRLS class - May 1, 2010. The class was held at the Dale Carnegie Headquarters (at the time) in San Mateo and was sold out. Thirty excited Rotarians gathered that Saturday morning to experience the training that would become the hallmark of District 5150. The faculty conducted three Basic PRLS classes in 2010 followed by the establishment of the five Master PRLS class series in 2011.\n\nPRLS' History and Legacy: Leadership Training for Rotarians Betsy Koefoed 2022-07-12 07:00:00Z 0\n\nRotarian of the Month - July 2022\n\nCongratulations to Rotary District 5150 Rotarian of the Month for July 2022, Michael Petricca, from the Rotary Club of San Francisco!\n\nSince joining the Rotary in 2017, Michael has served on the clubâs board and contributed hundreds of volunteer hours towards our club services and District 5150 events.\n\nâWhen you hear the Rotary saying, People of Action, Michael Petricca comes to mind,â said Immediate Past Club President, Mary Liu. âHe is a person of action, and he gets things done!â\n\nRotarian of the Month - July 2022 2022-07-09 07:00:00Z 0 District Rotarian of the Month,Rotarian of the Month,Rotary Club of San Francisco\n\nDistrict Governor Message - July 2022\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR!\n\nWelcome to the new Rotary year, 2022-2023.

Over the past fifty years, he has served in almost every Rotary assignment, from Berkeley Rotary Club president to worldwide President of Rotary International in 1992-93. He has traveled the world on humanitarian projects and has been honored by the heads of state in many nations.\n\nCliff lived in the Bay Area -- most recently a member of the Rotary Club of Moraga -- and maintained many friendships and Rotary project connections with District 5150 Rotarians. We will miss our friend, Cliff.\n\nRemembering RI President Cliff Dochterman PDG Peter Lagarias 2021-12-02 08:00:00Z 0 Rotary International\n\nRotarian of the Month - December 2021\n\nCongratulations to Rotary District 5150 Rotarian of the Month for December 2021, Agnes Siteyia from the Rotary Club for Global Action.\n\nAgnes is a member of the Maasai tribe in the Mara region of Kenya and is a charter member of the Rotary Club for Global Action (RCGA). Due to COVID-19, many Rotary clubs had to forego their international projects over the last two years. An educator by profession, Agnes alerted RCGA to the obstacles to getting children back into school both in her native Kenya, as well as throughout the world and it was her efforts that really shaped RCGAâs international service work to provide immediate assistance to schools and school children.\n\nRotarian of the Month - December 2021 2021-12-01 08:00:00Z 0 District Rotarian of the Month,Rotarian of the Month,Rotary Club for Global Action\n\nDistrict Governor Monthly Message - November 2021\n\nHappy November, everyone!\n\nThis month we celebrate our Rotary Foundation.
