In alignment with the World Bank’sDigital Development Practice, the summit will focus on three subthemes:\n\n1) Digital Access and Inclusion\n\n2) Artificial Intelligence\n\n3) Sustainable Technology for a Livable Planet\n\nWhen discussing these subthemes, the summit will focus on three fresh perspectives on technology: Youth in areas affected by Fragility, Conflict and Violence (FCV), Women in Tech and Rural Youth. By giving recognition to these groups, pioneering ideas will be presented on the world stage that tackle the digital divide, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and explore the opportunities and challenges associated with emerging technologies. With the aim of empowering youth to harness the potential of technology, the summit will bring together young minds, experts, and stakeholders to shape the digital future and drive progress towards a more inclusive and sustainable world.\n\nWhy is it relevant?\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, young people are confronted with a multitude of complex challenges, ranging from the threat of climate change to unemployment and violent conflicts. These challenges demand innovative solutions, and that's where digital technologies come into play.​\n\nDigital tools not only help us tackle global challenges and respond to unexpected shocks, but they also open new avenues for job creation, market expansion, and improved efficiency. Technology allows for urban planning in smart cities, digital financial services for previously unbanked populations, disease surveillance data platforms to stop the spread, and unlimited other possibilities. ​\n\nHowever, a glaring digital divide is hindering progress and limiting opportunities, with2.6 billion people offline globally. The World Bank Youth Summit 2024 will be dedicated to addressing this divide by discussing digital access and the development solutions that can follow using AI and sustainable and green technology.\n\nThe Summit will bring together young people, the World Bank Group, and the international community to discuss the impact of digital transformation. Historically marginalized voices, including women in technology, FCV-affected youth, and rural youth will be showcased as we explore ways to bridge the digital gap by providing skills, infrastructure, and promoting technological literacy.\n\nOnce again, this year, the World Bank Group (WBG) Youth Summit will feature an action-based learning component through the Case Challenge competition on the theme \"Powering Progress: Youth Leading the Digital Transformation\" (the “Case Challenge”). The Case Challenge is an integrated part of the WBG Youth Summit taking place on May 30-31, 2024.\n\nThe Case Challenge collaborative element is an essential part of the 2024 WBG Youth Summit on the promotion of efficient local solutions contributing to global development, with a vision for fostering an environment of belonging and increasing engagement between all delegates, the WBG and the facilitators.\n\nDuring the 2024 Summit, all attending delegates will engage in this Case Challenge designed to provide hands-on experience. This team-based, simulated scenario will allow participants to actively identify pivotal challenges and opportunities in fostering local solutions for equitable growth. Through facilitated working sessions led by leading development practitioners, the participants will work with their peers to develop and present their solutions. The Case Challenge will provide a unique opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, problem-solving skills, and creativity while co-creating and networking with peers and experts in the field.\n\nParticipants are divided into random groups to form high-performing case teams. Teams are tasked with devising a proposed solution to the given case prompt within an allotted time and presenting their solutions to a panel comprised of WBG senior leads and external partners. With such an eclectic array of experiences and skills within every group, individuals will enhance their own communication and teamwork skills.\n\nRead through the FAQ below to get more information.\n\nFAQ\n\n1. What is the “Youth Leading the Digital Transformation” Case Challenge?\n\nThe Case Challenge is a guided workshop for all the in-person participants of the Youth Summit, where teams propose solutions to cases based on real World Bank Group projects.\n\nThe Case Challenge provides delegates with a unique opportunity to craft solutions aimed at addressing primary challenges encountered by regional communities. These solutions not only address local issues but also have the potential to yield global impact upon implementation. During the Case Challenge, the teams will focus on one of the three salient sub-themes: (i) digital access and inclusion; (ii) artificial intelligence; and (iii) sustainable tech for a livable planet, applied to a specific region. Under these themes, the following development challenges will be taken into consideration: women in tech, rural youth and youth in areas affected by fragility, conflict, and violence.\n\n2. What is the difference between the Case Challenge and the Youth Summit Pitch Competition?\n\nThe Case Challenge is a guided workshop for all the in-person participants of the Youth Summit, where teams propose solutions to cases based on real World Bank Group projects. It is a foundational action-based learning component of the Youth Summit, seamlessly integrated into the two-day event.\n\nThe Pitch Competition is an annual competition that runs concurrent with the Youth Summit and culminates during the two-day event. Ahead of the Summit, young professionals from all over the world are invited to propose innovative, action-oriented business-level or policy-level solutions that illustrate how technology can address challenges relating to youth in FCV-affected areas, women in the tech space and the digital inclusion of rural youth. A jury of experts will pre-select the most compelling proposals based on three pillars and invite their authors (individuals or teams) to pitch them during the live competition. Winners will be designated by votes from the jury and members of the audience. For more information on the WBG Youth Summit Competition, please consult the Pitch Competition section of our website.\n\n3. What kind of work is done on the cases?\n\nThe proposed cases are rooted in actual WBG and Deloitte initiatives, strategically chosen to prompt Delegates to delve deeply into the core development issues of the Youth Summit subthemes. Through this process, they will tailor solutions to the unique context of each region. Delegates will hone their research, teamwork, and consulting skills by engaging in problem-solving exercises modelled after real-world scenarios. Facilitators and frameworks will provide guidance throughout, aiding Delegates in effectively addressing the challenges presented.\n\n4. Who will take part in the Case Challenge?\n\nAll 200-300 delegates selected to attend the 2024 World Bank Group Summit in Washington DC at the WBG headquarters will be required to participate in the Case Challenge. The delegates will be randomly split into 7 regional groups and will work in teams of approximately 8-10 people to solve the challenge.\n\n5. Do participants have to apply individually or as part of a team?\n\nBy applying to attend the 2024 edition in person, participants are automatically required to take part in the Case Challenge. All teams are formed randomly during the actual event, to test the effectiveness of the delegates’ communication and teamwork skills when teamed up with people they have not known previously.\n\n6. Is any previous case experience required?\n\nThis is meant to be a fun and learning experience, so no previous experience is required.\n\n7. Is there a participation fee?\n\nNo.\n\n8. Who designs/gives the case?\n\nThe cases are provided by the WBG Youth Summit organizers and have been designed with the help of a group of young and experienced World Bank Group volunteers.\n\n9. Who is facilitating the Case Challenge?\n\nFacilitators are young, skilled professionals who possess substantial expertise in digital access and inclusion, artificial intelligence, and sustainable technology. Their role is to lead participants through each stage of the Case Challenge, fostering engaging discussions, ensuring seamless interaction, and addressing any queries that may arise, thus enhancing the overall experience.\n\n10. When and where is the Case Challenge going to be held?\n\nThe Case Challenge is fully integrated into the Youth Summit so that participants can be inspired by the discussions they attend during the panel sessions on the global impact of local development strategies and apply their learnings to the Case Challenge. This year’s Case Challenge section will be 100% in-person at the WBG HQ in Washington D.C.\n\n11. How is the winning team of the Case Challenge determined?\n\nOn the event's second day, all teams will present their solutions within their respective regional groups, with a jury comprised of WBG senior leaders and external partners selecting a winning team for each region. Following a final round of presentations by the seven winning regional teams, the audience will vote to elect the global winning team.\n\n12. What do participants get out of this?\n\nParticipants will have the opportunity to get a hands-on experience of the work conducted at the WBG by working on cases based on real WBG projects.\n\nParticipants will have the opportunity to experience the challenges of tackling a development case under the mentorship of professionals in this area.\n\nParticipants will have the opportunity to apply knowledge gained during the plenary sessions and apply them directly, to learn more interactively on the global impact of localized solutions to development challenges across communities and regions.\n\nParticipants will have the opportunity to network with professionals and team members and to learn more about opportunities for future collaboration.\n\nFollowing deliberations of the panel of experts, the global winning team will receive a symbolic prize and the chance to write a blog to be published on a WBG page (all prizes to be confirmed)."
