        "text": "Code Mystics is lead by a core team of industry veterans, all with multiple areas of expertise, and many shipped titles under their belts. Over the years, this same team have been the key personnel entrusted with such premium brands as Age of Empires, Spyro the Dragon, Sonic the Hedgehog, Castlevania and more... with award-winning results. We are also renowned for our care of timeless arcade classics like Asteroids and Pac Man  our team was the very same founding technical group of Digital Eclipse that established the retrogaming genre with Williams Arcade Classics in 1994. Below are bios of some of our key personnel:\n\nJeff Vavasour\n\nCode Mystics' founder, Jeff's career in the video game industry started in 1994. He was formerly a founding partner and EVP of Canadian Operations for Foundation 9 Entertainment, departing in 2006 to serve as an industry consultant. Jeff started Backbone Entertainment's Vancouver studio in 1997, which, by the time of his departure had grown to over 100 people, developing for all modern video game platforms. Studio accomplishments included the award winning Age of Empires: The Age of Kings for the Nintendo DS, and more than 40 other titles. Prior to founding Code Mystics, Jeff had already personally led development for more than 30 titles, contributed to more than 60, and served as Chief Technical Officer for both Digital Eclipse Software and Backbone Entertainment from 1998 to 2005. He has first-hand knowledge of all aspects of the process, through contribution to programming, business development, production, design, budgeting and art. Prior to his work in video games, Jeff was a researcher in polymer physics, holding an M.Sc. degree.\n\nGeorge Phillips\n\nSenior Programmer and lead on the platform adaptations of our FOCAL Emulation Technology, having a key role in Code Mystics products such as Lost Treasures of Infocom, Atari's Greatest Hits, Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection, and more. George has 20 years experience in video game development, previously culminating as Technical Director of Backbone Entertainments Vancouver studio. He is an expert in infrastructure coding, including graphics, collision, physics, and networking, with strong skills in optimisation, compression, debugging and coding in everything from C++ and Perl to assembly. He has served in a significant or lead role on nearly 50 SKUs from the Sega Genesis to the PS3. He has been a key contributor to most all of Code Mystics' games. Credits prior to Code Mystics include Monster Lab (PS2), Sonic Rivals 2 (PSP), Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (XBLA), Ultimate Mortal Kombat (DS), and Activision Hits Remixed (PSP). Prior to his work in video games, George was a significant contributor to web standards, including the ubiquitous CGI web interface standard and to the first implementation of the transparent GIF format in the Mosaic web browser. He also earned an M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia, where he was subsequently employed.\n\nPeter Phillips\n\nPeter brings over 20 years game programming experience to Code Mystics having worked on teams large and small as lead or technical director. A programmer by preference, Peter is a generalist working on all technical aspects of development: data pipelines, tools, build systems, graphics, infrastructure, UI, physics, technical specifications and... whatever else it takes to get the game shipped. As with his brother, George, Peter has been a key contributor to most of the games in Code Mystics' catalogue. Prior to joining Code Mystics, his credits include Sonic Rivals (PSP), Monster Lab (Wii, PS2), Atari's Greatest Hits and Activision Anthology (iOS, Android). Peter's background includes B.Sc. in Computer Science from UBC, managing large UNIX networks and writing Internet services in C++.\n\nTony Rodriguez\n\nCode Mystics' visual lead, Tony has been an artist for over twenty years. Tony oversees and has a personal hand in all aspects of Code Mystics' art needs, from concept/visualisation to characters and 3D modelling to UI. Tony studied graphic arts for five years including the postgraduate 3D animation program at Sheridan College in Toronto, Ontario. Upon graduation he worked for three years in TV production at Nelvana (Animation Studio). In 2001 Tony moved to Vancouver where he began his career in the games industry, joining Digital Eclipse in 2002. With such a strong art background, Tony was quickly promoted to art lead as well as a team lead. Tony has contributed his talents to major licences such as MLB Baseball for both the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii, Full Auto 2 for the PSP, Spyro the Dragon for GBA, Cat in the Hat and Nicktoons Basketball for PC. All together Tony has worked on more than 50 games plus has contributed to an array of concept work and design for original IP."
