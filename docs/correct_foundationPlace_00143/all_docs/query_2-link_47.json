Phase 2 will include development of the following Elements:\n\n- Land Use and Transportation Element (LUTE) Update\n\n- Open Space, Conservation and Recreation (OSCAR) Element Update\n\n- Noise Element Update\n\n- Infrastructure and Capital Facilities Element\n\nAs in Phase 1, the Elements will be accompanied by a Racial Equity Impact Analysis and update of the Zoning Code.\n\nWe look forward to engaging you in this work!\n\nWhat's the General Plan Update?\n\nOakland’s General Plan Update (GPU) is a collaborative, citywide planning process required by the state to plan for a vibrant future for all residents. Through this process, we will create more livable and connected neighborhoods where folks can access what they want and need, like grocery stores, arts & and entertainment, retail, libraries, parks, and safe and reliable transportation. Once approved in 2025, the Plan will guide citywide development over the following two decades, with a focus on creating an equitable and just city.\n\nPhase 2 will work with the Oakland community to advance the following goals:\n\n- Build a transportation system where everyone has access to safe and reliable options to get them where they need to go\n\n- Create more livable and walkable neighborhoods where folks have access to the things they want and need, like grocery stores, arts & entertainment, retail, libraries, and parks\n\n- Develop parks and recreational spaces, focusing on the most underserved neighborhoods, so that everyone can access and enjoy natural spaces\n\n- Protect neighborhoods adjacent to freeways, airports, and industrial activities from excessive noise\n\n- Improve our city’s infrastructure, from roads, bridges, and sidewalks to facilities such as public restrooms and fire stations\n\n- Identify and work to meet the needs of Oakland’s many different, yet interconnected communities"
