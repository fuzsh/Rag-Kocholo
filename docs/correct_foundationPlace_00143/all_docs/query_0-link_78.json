        "text": "Enslaved with Insomnium and Black Anvil\n\nRickshaw Theatre\n\nVancouver, B.C., Canada\n\n(April 18th, 2023)\n\nPhotographs and review by Kurt Almey\n\nAdditional review comments by JP\n\nInsomnium had a concert booked in our hometown of Calgary, Alberta, Canada before the pandemic and it was cancelled. These things happen. Unfortunately, on this tour cycle they did not rebook in Calgary. The last time I saw Insomnium was in 2015 and the last time I saw Enslaved was in 2013 so I was long overdue. Kurt had never had the pleasure of seeing either of them. Both bands just released very strong albums; Enslaved with HEIMDAL and Insomnium with ANNO 1696 so it necessitated the cheap, one-hour, 1000 km flight to Vancouver to see the co-headlining tour.\n\nVancouver was overcast and mild, and quite sedate. The city’s notorious and dangerous tent city that stretched for a few kilometers, right in front of the venue, had just been removed the week before by the authorities and the streets were surprisingly clean and quiet. After a few pre-concert refreshments at local Metal bars The Moose (located at 724 Nelson Street) www.facebook.com/themoosevancouver and Jackalopes (located at 2257 East Hastings) www.facebook.com/jackalopesdive we were ready for a night of Metallic entertainment.\n\nA scheduling mix-up (probably my fault) means Kurt and I arrived a bit late and only caught the last bit of Black Anvil, but it was already packed. A local Vancouver resident and friend who I had reunited with, mentioned it is the busiest he has seen The Rickshaw in years. The old tyme movie theater was built in 1971 and despite showing its age, is a great venue, a true staple of Vancouver’s Metal scene. I have been there many times and they are metal-friendly and cool, no burly security guys treating the paying customers like criminals. Show time!\n\nA late-announced addition to the Vancouver landing of this tour was New York-based black metal outfit Black Anvil, known for and aggressive overwhelming sound… and they delivered a performance that hit the mark on both points. They wasted no time announcing themselves as harbingers for a ferocious evening; guitarist and vocalist Paul Delaney unleashed a barrage of razor-sharp riffs in tandem with guttural growls, though standing on the frontline ahead of drummer Raeph Glicken couldn’t detract from the ruthless, hammering perfect percussion being delivered from behind the kit.\n\nStandout moments early in the evening were delivered by Delaney during the more intricate and melodic moments. While not quite the masterclass in black metal we were about to be treated to, Black Anvil was a strong reminder of the incredible talent and quality growing within the genre. As the band that had the incredibly challenging task of opening for Insomnium and Enslaved, they most certainly were a worthwhile and exciting act to properly propel us into the evening’s festivities to come.\n\nBlack Anvil\n\nSetlist\n\nIn Two\n\nThe Bet\n\n29\n\n8-Bit Terror\n\nGrant Us His Love\n\nCastrum Doloris\n\nInsomnuim brought their trademark atmospheric, emotionally charged performance to the Rickshaw, a concert experience that was moving and evocative. I somehow came away less convinced of the popular opinion promoted by my peers that they play a music style closely attached to that of Bolt Thrower, but despite my dissenting opinion perception of the “obvious” Bolt Thrower worship, my enjoyment of the show was in no way affected.\n\nWith a minimalist stage setup (granted, the dressed-down approach did at times giving a feeling of the stage being bigger than it physically was) they immediately filled any feeling of emptiness with an intimidating aural presence, a melancholic and commanding sound that seized the attention of all. Ville Friman and Markus Vanhala captivated instantly, shredding in a display of impeccable skill and energy. Weaving, intricate melodies and harmonies backed the viciousness from the onset, framing Niilo Sevänen’s guttural growls and resonating percussive rhythms across the already fully involved crowd in the Rickshaw. The relentless energy of drummer Markus Hirvonen served as the backbone of the performance, providing a thunderous foundation for the band’s epic compositions.\n\nThe setlist was a respectable and balanced offering of the new and old, giving a solid glimpse of Insominum’s sound evolution throughout their career. Tracks like “While We Sleep” and the finale “Heart Like a Grave” elicited impassioned sing-alongs from the audience, and haunting acoustic interludes provided brief moments of calm amidst the storm. The melodies and infectious choruses were never more than a moment away though and were always met with enthusiasm from a crowd that was thoroughly immersed in the experience.\n\nThat genuine immersive connection between crowd and artist was apparent throughout the set, as shared stories and banter between songs only further enraptured the excited audience.\n\nInsomnium had some big shoes to fill, as friends inundated me with heaps of praise for the band and suggestions of their talent being in league with other genre greats. However, it was the unwavering commitment to the craft and their own art to create the aforementioned immersive, emotionally charged experience that sold all of us on their music that night; particularly as they were to be followed by one of the most impressive bands occupying the progressive black and death music scenes at the moment. Fans of melodic death metal would be hard-pressed to find a more satisfying live concert experience; Insomnium continues to stake claim as a candidate on their way to being one of the scene’s most revered acts.\n\nInsomnium\n\nSetlist\n\n1696\n\nWhite Christ\n\nWhile We Sleep\n\nGodforsaken\n\nLilian\n\nAnd Bells They Toll\n\nThe Witch Hunter\n\nValediction\n\nThe Gale\n\nMortal Share\n\nHeart Like a Grave\n\nLikely the most important, active Norwegian (former) Black/Viking metal band, Enslaved have never shied away from evolution. Their unique blend of black and progressive influences, straddling the intensity of Emperor but with a more diverse approach akin to (but not nearly as transient) as Ulver, kept them quite high on the bucket list for yours truly. Somehow never having the good fortune of crossing paths with the Nordic extreme metal legends, I was very much looking forward to not only finally bearing witness to the quintet, but so much so that I may have gone overboard and snagged tickets to see them on three occasions, in three separate countries, this year. Best of all, the Norwegian vets have developed a reputation of excellent live performances, and my excitement was further compounded – ironically enough – by my laziness: recent/late-era Enslaved is something truly special. Finding the perfect balance between the aforementioned and fearlessly experimental Ihsahn- and Rygg-led black metal projects, the 30-year-old outfit has kept things fresh without compromising on a single thing. Quality was at the forefront of the show, something evident from their immediately electrifying entrance and crowd engagement.\n\nTaking to perhaps the most minimally dressed stage I’ve seen in quite some time; digital projections spoiled the plot for some while simultaneously confirming the treats that they had in store already presumed by many others. The classic pre-2000s Enslaved logo was muddily displayed on stage canvas, and likely had a marked effect on the eager fans who packed the floor of the Rickshaw.\n\nEnslaved kicked the proverbial doors in, very quickly ripping into two tracks from 2020’s ‘Utgard’ album and establishing a high energy mood in doing so. Although guitarist Ivar Bjørnson was unable to make the show in Vancouver and, frankly, his presence was very much missed, his absence remained apparent without being detrimental on this evening. Arve was nothing short of mesmerizing, showing no problem at all whilst shouldering the workload. Perhaps intentionally throttling up the energy himself, his effortless management of the trademark Enslaved riffing meant there was nothing compromised when it came to their sound. Additionally, the youthful and new percussion section tandem of Iver (behind the kit) and Håkon (on bass) provided a solid foundation, and they didn’t miss a step as they drove each song with powerful precision.\n\nGrutle Kjellson was also in top form, his voice still dynamic as ever, with rapid and clean transitions between raspy black snarls to haunting melodic choruses. His commanding stage presence was palpable, as he effortlessly engaged the audience, urging them to join in the battle cries and chant along to brand new material, including “Kingdom” and “Forest Dweller.”\n\nEnslaved’s setlist spanned their extensive discography, expertly balancing fan favorites with newer tracks from their fantastic last two. The band expertly showcase their musical evolution with the care given to curation, without ignoring their roots. The crowd remained in a constant state of fervor, headbanging and moshing to the thunderous riffs and soaring melodies that define Enslaved’s sound.\n\nOne of the standout moments of the night was easily “Heimdal,” the title track of their latest album. The epic journey further displaying Norse mastery of epic prog metal was met with an equally awesome reception. It was perhaps the first time in a few years that I was nostalgic for the old days of drawn out, over-the-top acts of bands baiting the crowd into chants for an encore. This one deserved every encore they could have incited us to feverishly chant for.\n\nThe Enslaved concert experience is an exemplary statement: a testament to the band’s unwavering dedication to their craft, and their ability to captivate audiences with their enthralling blend of black and progressive metal; and a statement that the wild, pop culture sphere that still hangs heavy above the 90’s black metal scene is but a brief glimpse of the innovation and passion that has kept the genre relevant to this day. Skol, to the true masters of black, Viking, and progressive metal music.\n\nEnslaved\n\nSetlist"
