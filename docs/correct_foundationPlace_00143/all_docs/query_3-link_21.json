        "text": "For Immediate Release:\n\nEMERYVILLE, CA - March 2, 2006 - Backbone Entertainment announced today that it is now an officially licensed Universal Media Disc (UMDTM) authoring service provider, able to create a variety of video projects for the PSPTM (PlayStation® Portable) system. The new branch of Backbone's business adds to its already well-known reputation as one of the leading videogame developers in the country.\n\n\"The PSP has so many different entertainment capabilities to offer,\" says Mike Mika, studio head of Backbone's Emeryville location. \"We're excited to continue to push the limits of the platform, not only in the games that we develop, but also in every other form of media available on the system.\"\n\nSimilar to DVD authoring, Backbone's service offers clients a wide array of interactive menu design and implementation options to maximize a user's video experience on the PSP. These range from designing and creating menus from scratch, to converting menus from an already-released DVD to UMD compliant form. And since the UMD format enables far more functionality than the DVD standard, the company's service can push the limits in terms of creativity and innovation in interaction and design.\n\nBackbone's first announced projects in this field are Night Warriors DarkstalkersTM Revenge Alpha and Night Warriors DarkstalkersTM Revenge Omega, both developed for Capcom®. Based on Capcom's popular Darkstalkers videogame, both volumes will contain two, action packed, 40-minute anime episodes each, and are scheduled for release in March.\n\nAbout Backbone Entertainment\n\nPart of Foundation 9 Entertainment (www.F9E.com), the largest independent game developer in North America, Backbone specializes in developing original and licensed IP for all platforms and creating merchandising opportunities in diversified entertainment genres.
