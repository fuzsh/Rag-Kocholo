        "text": "The Point is widely recognized as one of the most important quality-of-life opportunities in Utah history. It consists of 600 acres of state-owned land that is being built into Utah’s Innovation Community. The new community will foster innovation and technological advancement, provide parks and open space, support economic opportunity and enhance Utahns’ quality of life.\n\nThe first phase of development will serve as a catalyst for The Point. Located at the heart of the site, it reflects Utahns’ vision. It includes a pedestrian-priority area, a Central Green, regional trail connections, transit-oriented development, a balanced mix of jobs, housing, retail, shopping, entertainment, and so much more.\n\nDevelopment plans also include critical backbone infrastructure that will lay the groundwork for future development. Major infrastructure projects will extend Porter Rockwell Boulevard and planned transit service through the site, and construct most of the “River-to-Range” regional trail system."
