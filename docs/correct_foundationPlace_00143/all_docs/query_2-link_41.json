Begin exploring options here by sorting based on your intended OSU campus, academic college or delivery method.\n\nIf you're not sure what to major in when you arrive at Oregon State, you don't need to rush such an important decision. You can select \"University Exploratory Studies Program\" (UESP) as your academic home until you are ready to declare a specific academic major. Learn more about UESP."
