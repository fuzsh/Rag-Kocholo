        "text": "SARALEE & RICHARD'S BARN\n\nA Permanent Agriculture Education Center on the grounds of the Sonoma County Fair\n\nFor over 80 years, the backbone of the Sonoma County Fair has always been agriculture. Generations of 4-H and FFA'ers grew up showing animals at the Fair and returned years later to watch their children and even grandchildren do the same.\n\nOne of these young 4-H members was Saralee McClelland Kunde, who showed her prized cows at the Sonoma County Fair as a youth in the 1950s and 60s. Saralee remained closely integrated with promoting agriculture and the Fair throughout the rest of her life, becoming and employee and later a board member of the Sonoma County Fair. She and her husband, Richard, hosted numerous fundraisers each year, helping to fund scholarships for youth in agriculture. When Saralee passed away in January of 2014, she left behind and incredible legacy as a grape grower, philanthropist, community leader and agricultural mentor.\n\nAs a county based in agriculture, be it dairy, grapes, or other commodities, having a location where agriculturalists can showcase their value to our community is essential. A permanent agriculture education center can promote better understanding of agriculture, which in turn provides support for farmers and ranchers. In our urban culture, educating youth about the importance of our agriculture industry and how it brings fresh food to their table daily is more important than ever.\n\nThe nearly 12,000 square foot facility will serve as a showcase and promote the county's heritage and its $4 billion industry. It will serve as a venue in honor of Saralee and Richard, potentially hosting fundraising dinners, wine competitions, culinary demonstrations, farm to table activities, 4-H and FFA seminars and meetings, the Sonoma County Farm Bureau's Ag Days for over 4,000 elementary school children and various private events.\n\nDONOR SUPPORT LEVELS\n\nNaming Rights Gifts\n\nAgricultural Education Center Endowment Fund • $1,000,000 • Richard & Saralee Kunde\n\nThe Plaza • $200,000 • Redwood Credit Union\n\nDemonstration Kitchen Area • $150,000 • Ovations FanFare, LLP\n\nThe Olive Grove • $100,000 • Summit State Bank\n\nThe History Wall • $100,000 • Ernest L & Ruth W.
