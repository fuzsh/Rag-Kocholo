For over two decades we’ve worked to make the Alamo Drafthouse experience the best cinematic experience in the world. Here’s how. We don’t just want to be another multiplex. Everyone who works at Alamo Drafthouse, from the managers to the servers to the kitchen staff, is passionate about film. To us, the latest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe can be just as worthy of attention and celebration as a foreign language drama. Through our Drafthouse Recommends program we've committed ourselves to helping innovative and challenging films like GET OUT, THE FLORIDA PROJECT, and CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, and find an audience. Celebrating classic cinema is also something we take seriously. Whether it’s an interactive Movie Party presentation of a timeless classic, a chef-inspired feast with a menu paired to a film, or a re-evaluation of a lost gem, we love sharing the movies we love with Alamo Drafthouse audiences of all ages. When you see a movie at Alamo Drafthouse, you get cold drinks, delicious meals and tasty local beers, brought to your seat by a server. Need a free refill on your popcorn or soda? Raise an order card and we’ll get it taken care of quickly. Each Alamo Drafthouse's menu has food, snacks & dessert prepared fresh from locally sourced ingredients. Plus, our chefs regularly create special menus inspired by classic cinema and big upcoming blockbusters, like an all-Pakistani menu curated by Kumail Nanjiani for THE BIG SICK or a take on African flavors for BLACK PANTHER. Beer is our middle name at Alamo Drafthouse, so we make certain that every Alamo Drafthouse location highlights and promotes the best local craft breweries. Our bar staff also loves to innovate, and are constantly mixing up new cocktail creations that’ll elevate the cinematic experience.\n\nGaming • News + Entertainment\n\nFableVision Studios creates animations, games, websites, apps, videos, and more to help move the world to a better place. Our signature blend of positive messaging, storytelling, and interactive technologies is sought after by a host of best-in-class organizations, including leading publishers, broadcasters, educational and nonprofit organizations, museums, hospitals and health care organizations, such as PBS Kids, Smithsonian Institution, Sesame Workshop, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Mattel, the Jim Henson Company, and National Geographic Society. Founded in 1996, the company has earned a reputation for its creative design and development of digital media that engages and inspires. The FableVision team has a deep understanding of the ways that people of all ages approach, comprehend, and apply knowledge, and build media to support their learning. Among others, in 2016 we’ve won Parents’ Choice Awards for Zoombinis and ParkPals: Kindness Rules, and took home an AAM MUSE Award for Ripped Apart: A Civil War Mystery. In 2015 we were awarded an Excellence In Financial Literacy Education (EIFLE) Award also for Renegade Buggies, and were a finalist in the 2015 EdTech Digest Cool Tool Awards for After the Storm.\n\nAgency • News + Entertainment • Other\n\n25 Employees\n\nL’AgenceRP was created in 2012 from the independent, idealistic spirit of our founder. Natacha Favry fervently believes that freedom allows greater efficiency, and that working your way, without pressure from stakeholders, leads to 100% customer satisfaction. Natacha is also convinced that every one of us has the power to make a positive social impact. Her secret weapon: communication. What’s the point of innovation if it doesn’t affect anyone? If it elicits no response? “Revealing” is the key that can open the door to profound change. But change also means transformation, questioning, shaking things up. These words can be frightening, and can generate mistrust. Mistrust is the evil of our times; no one believes anyone anymore. “Technology will steal our jobs!” “Journalists distort the truth.” “If you read it online it’s probably fake news.” We respond to this mistrust with trustworthiness, transparency, honesty, and commitment. Our commitment to a better world. Our commitment to our clients. They are the ones creating this movement, and their innovations are changing the world. Our mission is to support them, and provide them with the platform they need to spread their message. We truly believe in them!\n\nGaming • Marketing Tech • Mobile • News + Entertainment\n\nTechRobot has been helpful in guiding people with a proper understanding of the changes that are taking place in the tech world. Relevant changes are to be carefully analyzed, and if one creates a mess at this point, they will not be in a position to deal with the challenges in the online space. You should make sure that you not only learn from it for once but keep learning everything that is related to your online safety and ease.\n\nAgency • News + Entertainment • Transportation\n\nFully Remote, USA\n\n4,190 Employees\n\nWe are a pioneering technology and marketing services company that creates end-to-end digital experiences for brands such as Google, KFC, Philips, Audi, Twitch, Patagonia, eBay and more. Our team of 4,000+ digital specialists across 30+ locations on 5 continents delivers pioneering work on a global scale with a boutique culture. We are committed to making a positive impact on the planet and since 2021 have been Climate Neutral and B Corporation certified. We are pioneers at heart. What this means, is that we are always leaning forward, thinking of what we can create tomorrow that does not exist today. We were born digital and we are a new model of agency, with a deep skillset in tech & marketing. We facilitate our pioneering spirit by investing in innovation, by leveraging our proprietary tech, data and knowledge platforms for all our clients worldwide. Our culture is ’big enough to cope and small enough to care. Simply put we can work for any brand in the world, but with the speed, agility, flexibility and personal relationships of a boutique agency. Join us!"
