        "text": "Do YOU have a pretty good baseball team that’s reeling due to a rough part of the schedule? Is your star player on the IL with painful foot that just won’t go away? Do you have any pitchers you need to get back on track? If any of these symptoms sound familiar, talk to your local professional baseball about the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThat’s right, folks. The White Sox are the cure to all of your team’s problems. On pace to be one of the worst teams in MLB’s long and storied history, today’s vaunted Chicago lineup featured a single player with an OPS over .700 this season, Luis Robert Jr. at a robust .704. The combined fWAR of this lineup was -1.9, meaning the White Sox would be significantly better off getting a random veteran off the waiver wire over seven of the hitters in their lineup. If that can’t cure your pitcher’s struggles, I don’t know what will.\n\nThere was some actual baseball played, though most of it was unimportant and uninspired. Simeon Woods Richardson had his trademarked “totally fine” start, though he was nibbling around the corners a bit too much against an offense this lineup, leading to some runs. Royce Lewis hit his 13th home run in just his 33rd game this season and improbably continued to be one of the best hitters in baseball on a per-AB basis.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing that happened in this game was a potential Byron Buxton injury. With how well he had been playing, he was overdue for a collision with the wall, given how most of his career had gone. The incredible catch saved at least two runs, which would surprisingly loom large later in the game when Chicago got within three runs, but Buxton was clearly in some pain afterward. Buck was able to run off the field and even had his bat in-hand in the next inning before Rocco removed him from the game. Word from the Twins is that the removal was precautionary and he is fully medically cleared. He likely would have been removed anyway due to the fact that we were facing a team that is an embarrassment to professional baseball.\n\nThe game got a little more interesting in the 8th inning when now-fully-bearded Randy Dobnak made his second appearance for the Twins this season. Dobnak struggled to find the zone, basically throwing only meatballs or non-competitive pitches while the White Sox once again got the game within three runs. Steven Okert got the Twins out of the inning and the Twins added three runs of their own in the bottom half of the inning to put the game well out of reach.\n\nSTUDS\n\nGOAT Royce Lewis: 2-4, 1 HR, 3 R, 3 RBI\n\nSpeed Demon Matt Wallner: 1-2, 3 BB, 1 3B, 1 SB\n\nAll-Star Willi Castro: 3-5, 3 RBI\n\nDUDS\n\nThe entire White Sox organization. I don’t want to make it a habit to sympathize with White Sox fans, but it is BLEAK for South Siders right now and unclear if they have a plan to ever improve (why didn’t they trade Robert or Crochet in that crazy deadline market???)\n\nA second consecutive Cleveland loss puts the Twins back within 4.5 games of the Guardians, where they’ve seemingly been stuck all season. The Twins head to Chicago to face the Cubs over the next three days while the Guardians will play the red-hot Diamondbacks, before the Twins have a chance to seize control of the AL Central in a four-game set with their divisional rivals. If they can take three of those four games, they’ll be right back in the mix. Lose the series and they may not have a chance to recover at this point.\n\nThey’ve yet to win a single game against AL teams above them in the standings, going a combined 0-14 against the Guardians, Orioles, and Yankees, though almost all of those games came in their first couple months of early-season struggles. That record alone pretty much explains why the Twins are fighting for a Wild Card spot instead of contending with those three squads for the best record in baseball.\n\nNo time like the present to start righting the ship."
