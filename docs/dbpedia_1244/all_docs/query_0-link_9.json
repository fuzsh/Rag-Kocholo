        "meta_description": "L’objectif de cette étude est d’identifier la pertinence de la nouvelle de Michèle Laframboise, « Monarque des glaces », dans un cadre (sous-)générique, ainsi que de démontrer la façon dont elle s’applique aux scénarios plausibles de catastrophes écologiques, voire d’effondrements. Mon enquête s’appuie sur les travaux de Brent Ryan Bellamy, de Roger Bozzetto, de Gerry Canavan, de Rebecca Evans, d’Andrew Milner et de J. R. Burgman, de Kim Stanley Robinson, et de Darko Suvin. Parmi les objets d’étude à analyser, il y a les enjeux de la crise des changements climatiques, tels que représentés dans le récit de Laframboise, et les moyens par lesquels les personnages réussissent à survivre et à agir, pour le meilleur ou le pire. Les extraits que j’ai choisis traitent des conditions physiques et idéologiques de l’univers de fiction, du corps modifié comme adaptation de certains personnages à l’environnement, ainsi que de leur agentivité – tout cela en fonction des retombées écologiques et sociales continues de la catastrophe, qui s’alignent avec les causes anthropogéniques de la crise et les solutions anti-capitalistes éventuelles.",

        "text": "3“Ice Monarch” recounts the story of Dominique, an elderly man in a foreseeably distant future, who, at an advanced age, manages to prolong his life to 148 years thanks to a technology that grants a certain longevity by permitting the individual to transfer their consciousness into androids. In this case, the robotic, anthropomorphic body is that of a butterfly. Dominique remains at the service of the corporation that facilitated the extension of his being, ensuring a remote, supervisory role of the world outside its enclave. After significant climatic changes due to carbon emissions, global warming, glacier melting and methane release, the planet has for the most part been left in environmental and social ruin. The wealthiest and most politically savvy of survivors—those benefitting from the services of Dominique, among many other subordinates in varying roles—have constructed mobile domed palaces in order to weather the storm, as it were. Some thirty such self-contained cities are scattered over an artificial, moderately-sized continental ice shelf, sustained by itinerant factories that circulate in search of natural resources to extract, regardless of their impact on less fortunate survivors struggling to subsist in the outside world.\n\n6Before beginning the analysis of “Ice Monarch,” some preliminary definitions will help to direct the reader with respect to the conception of climate fiction (or cli-fi, as it is sometimes called), within science fiction (hereafter, SF). According to Roger Bozzetto, SF is a genre that offers\n\n7 Bozzetto, Roger, La Science-fiction (Paris: Armand Colin, 2007), 11 (Author’s translation).\n\nfictional narratives […] which present, in a very realistic, almost naturalistic way, adventures that aim to explore the potential of invented worlds, related in a more or less scientific context. These scenarios are “thought experiments” conducted through and within these “possible worlds.” Relying on a vocabulary steeped in that of science and technology, they evoke certain themes and notions as possible political, and even theological extensions of known reality.\n\nIndeed, Bozzetto continues:\n\n8 Bozzetto, La Science-fiction, 11 (Author’s translation).\n\nSF stories involve the narrative development of an idea or a serious question, such as the following: […] What will happen if global warming leads to changing our way of life? Will technology alone be able to ensure the survival of the human race? SF feeds on these types of questions, rendered relevant by virtue of the link they maintain with current events.\n\n12 Evans, “Nomenclature, Narrative, and Novum,” 489.\n\n[the] “Anthropocene” as a term seems particularly calculated for narrative effect. It narrates the contemporary period as a story of rapid ecological transformation and disruption of familiar assumptions about the stability and separateness of the nonhuman realm, with the central narrative conflict triggered by disastrous human overreach and overconsumption. The story of this indelibly altered world can only be “resolved” by a dramatic change in global human behavior (the progressive resolution) or a dramatic shift in the scale of the human species (the pessimistic resolution).\n\nFrom geological timeframing of human activity that proves detrimental to survival, to more brief periods of excessive exploitation, consumption, discarding and pollution of resources,\n\n13 Evans, “Nomenclature, Narrative, and Novum,” 495.\n\nthe novum of the Capitalocene [a term coined by Dipesh Chakrabarty] is quite different from the novum of the Anthropocene: while the latter is rooted in the particular ecological impacts that invisibly followed modern technoculture, the former is rooted in the social and ecological relationships that invisibly undergird modernity itself.\n\n11For Kim Stanley Robinson, the thematic tendency of climate crises in near-future works is indeed simply a trope of SF. More important than subcategorizing is assessing the relevance of the text’s literary value and real-world application to climate crises:\n\n16 Robinson, Kim Stanley, “Story Spaces of Climate Change,” Science Fiction Studies, vol. 45, n° 3 (20 (...)\n\nall near-future [SF] now has to include climate change or it becomes some kind of alternative history, which of course is not disallowed. Any kind of future is a story space, but the ones we are really going to live are going to be dealing with climate change. So there will be more and more climate-oriented science fiction.\n\n13Indeed, SF, and the cli-fi it encompasses, so preoccupied with science, technology and world issues, is perpetually evolving in tandem with and beyond the progress of empirical reality. This is a central concern for defining the genre and subgenre at issue.\n\n20 Robinson, “Story Spaces of Climate Change,” 427.\n\nDystopia is obvious, because the possibility of causing the sixth great mass extinction event in Earth’s history is all too real, and this kind of immense damage would impact humans hugely, as the whole biosphere is one integrated system. Sounding the alarm by way of dystopian cautionary tales is a valid response with an important role to play.\n\n15Conversely, still according to Robinson, a utopian imperative might trigger the political will necessary to confront radical change, to undertake the steps required not only with respect to adaptations to climate, but also, in the fallout, where ensuring social justice is concerned:\n\n21 Robinson, “Story Spaces of Climate Change,” 427.\n\n[A]t this point in history, our technological abilities and the energy flows on the planet are such that a “good anthropocene” is still physically possible. That may not remain true for too many more years, so there is an intense urgency to our moment, if we care about the biosphere and the human generations to come. […] [T]hat very urgency can be a spur to action. The need is clear, the solution is obvious: we have to invent a just and sustainable civilization, which will mean inventing postcapitalism […] against the intense resistance of currently existing privilege, greed, stupidity, and fear […].\n\n27 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 2.\n\nPale areas reflected sunlight back in space; dark areas absorbed the heat. Covering the pole with a white polymer sheet would augment the Earth’s albedo and curb global warming.\n\nThe Construction of this arctic jigsaw took twelve years. Hundreds of ships—freighters, converted whalers, passenger ferries, even luxury yatches [sic] from bankrupt CEO[s]—sailed north, their holds full of liquid polymer.\n\nFirst, workers sprayed a rectangular segment of sea with polyurethane foam. The foam solidified as it touched water, its trapped air bubbles ensuring buoyancy. Next, additives hardened the upper surface. The result was a nice patch of synthetic ice, serrated edges ready to fuse with another patch. A new segment of sea was marked out and the process began anew.\n\nAlas, political quarrels about cost-sharing erupted among the powers. Funding channels closed down before the new ice barely covered four million square kilomet[re]s. […]\n\nTossed around by sea currents, this big chunk of polymer bumped with clockwork regularity against the coasts of Greenland, Siberia, Alaska and Canada.\n\n18The ongoing environmental consequences of the climate crisis—again, global warming, glacier melt, and methane release—are discussed in relatively profound detail, but so is, perhaps more importantly, the social upheaval that takes place as a result. It is not only a matter of political indifference to the plight of the many, but of elite hoarding of resources and ensuring of safe refuge for the exclusive few:\n\n28 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 8-9.\n\nCivil war and political assassinations ruined nations. Cities became concrete wastelands. Facing this calamity, the happy few dug again in their deep pockets, their Swiss bank accounts.\n\nMost had their exit door ready.\n\nA few opted for a lunar hotel ticket, some others for a mansion in the new metropolises of Siberia and Alaska. The North Pole beckoned, as the newly thawed Antarctica had been annexed by China.\n\nThe Ice Lords[’] cities rolled on.\n\nBy that time, long past retirement age, I cast my lot with the last oil magnate. I supervised the building of his rolling palace. I took some time away to find my family and invite Eliane [Dominique’s daughter] and her children to come with me. She refused.\n\n[…] When my body, worn-out past all hope of recovery, began its final decline. I managed one last leap.\n\nThe ecologist became a butterfly.\n\n31 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 5.\n\n32 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 4-5.\n\nmy form: a black torso, four forearms to manipulate delicate instruments […], two powerful grasshopper legs to propel me towards the sky.\n\nAnd my best feature […]: two immense wings, their vibrant orange striated with black lines. Soft as synthetic silk, they could resist the strong convection winds of mountain ranges and withstand the highest shearing stresses. You could suspend a five-ton truck from each of my wingtips without tearing them apart.\n\nSome parts of me retained their original form: the mo[u]ld encasing my brain and spinal cord was sculpted into a human face, with large eyes. A small family of cameras and sensors lining my ocular globes gave me an eagle’s sharpness of vision. I could perceive the light range from ultraviolet to infrared. Perched atop a mountain, I could spot an ant scurrying on the floor of the valley.\n\nFew [servants] had kept their human form. Like me, they were modified and remodelled to add a few decades to their life expectancy. […]\n\n[M]y lifeline looked after me, other ports opening, bottle green caterpillars spreading essential oils on my wings to keep them flexible, filling up my brain’s nutrient reserves, calibrating my sensors: thermometer, altimeter, anemometer… the works.\n\n20While technologically extraordinary, continued application is limited for logistical and economical reasons. Therefore, Dominique must accept that this existential leap is provisional, especially given his class:\n\n33 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 12-13.\n\nThis body […] was—I knew it long before signing my […] agreement—the last that [I] would inhabit.\n\nIn theory, my masters could transfer my brain and spinal cord into a biological vat-grown body. In practice, the high failure rate and the few available resources limited the application of this procedure, especially on a mere servant.\n\n21From the individual body to the collective mentality, the culture of the inhabitants of the domes involves social conditioning through troubling surveillance footage, to ensure consent among the more fortunate survivors. For example, while flying over a devastated continent, Dominique captures images for his employer of\n\n34 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 11.\n\n35 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 17.\n\nEurope’s scars, dead cities with little rectangles of razed bungalows and large squares of collapsed supermarkets. Kilomet[re]s of empty shelves[;] their abundance forgotten. Murderous fights among scavenger groups also provided edifying pictures for the domes’ dwellers. […] The Ice Lords liked to show such images to their servants to remind them how lucky they were.\n\n22In the wake of environmental collapse, humanity declines into depravity, with a significant stratification of society according to, on the one hand, the survival of the fittest, and, on the other, the prosperity of the resourcefully influential. Indeed, nature has reclaimed civilization out in the wild world. Continuing his flight, Dominique bears witness to the devastation below:\n\n36 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 13.\n\nA chaotic landscape […] disputed by dozens of warlords. Columns of refugees faded into the dim horizon. More refugees lined up outside green tents at the desert’s edge. The rare relief organizations had to kowtow to warlords’ whims.\n\nI recorded all this for the edification of the domes’ children. The Ice Lords weren’t cut off from the world. Their tank-factories ponderously rolled across ravaged lands. When one of these mastodons detected a deposit, it stopped and drilled into the soil. Factories also harvested trees and other resources for the domes. Automated barges conveyed the goods to the ice-field harbour.\n\nSometimes, people were already on site, trying to live off the land. If they interfered with the mobile factories, the Ice Lords would engage a local warlord’s militia. I had recorded these “pacifying” events. My employers made sure they were getting what they paid for.\n\n51 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 20.\n\nThe behemoths would reach the water’s edge. They would mindlessly continue towards the ghost deposit, deeper and deeper, until water pressure finally crushed them.\n\nThe Ice Lords would attempt to remedy this lemming behavio[u]r remotely. It wouldn’t work. My “milkweed juice” had seen to that.\n\nThey would have to come out in person.\n\nOut in the wreckage of civilization, predators far more deadly than polar bears waited, the warlord[s] who had until now carried their commands, the angry survivors chased [from] their homes. Whoever would emerge victorious was no more my concern.\n\nBut there would be changes.\n\nThe apocalyptic vision of material and natural catastrophe, as well as of the descent into human violence, is overwhelmingly palpable. Individual hope is clearly lost as Dominique must resign himself to a form of death by starvation, with suicide as the only alternative option to hasten the inevitable and elude further personal suffering. However, collective betterment is an implied possibility as the story essentially concludes on an environmentally conscientious, post-capitalist vision of tabula rasa and revival.\n\n53 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 3-4.\n\n[…] I spotted a dark speck on the whiteness. Not a lonely seal. This speck moved so fast no polar bear could hope to make a meal [of] it. […]\n\nThe dark blur resolved into the fugitive servant. His torso was bent forward as if praying non[-] existent gods, to keep off the cold. His mechanical spider legs threw up chips of polyurethane mixed with some real ice in his wake. […].\n\nThe man was trying to reach a competitor’s mobile palace. Few were in range, since the thirty or thirty[-]one surviving palaces were scattered over four million square kilomet[re]s of synthetic ice. The freezing cold or his failing batteries would soon kill him. […]\n\nI computed the odds […][;] a faint chance to reach another Ice Lord’s palace. His determination filled me with admiration, mixed with sadness. I knew my duty. My employers would want the spider servant’s bio-implants back.\n\nI recorded his speed and direction, then turned toward my base.\n\n25In later coming to the decision to violate the terms of his contract, Dominique is inclined to reflect on the evolution of the political climate and its fallout, as well as on his own changing role throughout, on what he should and should not have done, perhaps:\n\n54 Laframboise, “Ice Monarch,” 7-8.\n\nLong ago, I led rallies, attended Climate Change Symposiums, took part in the laying of the first puzzle pieces of the artificial ice. Meanwhile, like an ice cube dropped in a glass of water, run-off from melting glaciers had chilled the local weather.\n\n“What global warming?” industrialists asked, laughing out loud.\n\nWorse, the warming sea stopped the Gulf Stream current. Paris, London, and most European capitals [experienced] the harsh winters that Canadians came to miss. Oil kings dug in their deep pockets to wash their hands [of] this “natural perturbation cycle.” They hired hackers and agents-provocateurs to disrupt and discredit the green organizations.\n\nFunding to the North Pole puzzle project dried up. […]\n\nAs climate warnings sank to the bottom of the public opinion pond, my bosses returned to their usual pastimes: concentrating capital, abolishing workers’ standards, automating productivity.\n\n27Given the content and form of the story, the text clearly belongs to cli-fi as a contemporary subgenre of SF in that it addresses the science of anthropogenic global warming and its fallout, serving at once as an ecological warning and as a call to act against potentially oppressive social restructuring. The protagonist moves from a place of vulnerability to empowerment in the face of systemic domination, his model dissidence against injustice constituting a thoroughly imaginative and meaningful reclamation."
