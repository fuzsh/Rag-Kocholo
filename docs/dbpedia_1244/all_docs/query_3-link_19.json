        "text": "Why fallout new vegas was terrible game and worse than fallout 4\n\nit seems some people on this forum are under the the imperssion that fallout new vegas is a better game than fallout 4 well im here to destroy this claim. Now well its true fallout 4 failed as an RPG fallout new vegas failed on every level so it by definition cant be better.\n\n1 the bugs and technical aspects\n\nFallout new vegas to this day even after patches remains the least stable and most bug ridden of both the modren 3D bethesda games and the fallout franchise as a whole which given the state of fallout 1 and 2 as well bethesda's releases is a remarkably hard thing to pull off. It has more crashes, more save file coruption issues and more bugs than other fallout or elder ecrolls game ive played. noteworthy issues include corupting parts of the hard drive itself and rendering sections unreadable and save files on the PS3 version become unplayable after a long amount of hours rendering a full completion of the game impossible as saves over 100 hours become unplayable due to rampent crashing and single digit frame rates.\n\nNow a common defense of these issues is for the obsdian fan boys to blame bethesda for the short development time on the grounds fallout 3 and 4 both had longer dev cycles. well at face value this may make sense the fact is unlike fallout 3 and 4 which required massive engine overhauls and groundwork to be built new vegas is at its core a conversion mod of fallout 3 and as such most of its design work was done before the game started production. Setting aside the actually programing work even the story and plot of new vegas was partially finshed before Obsdian started work as most of the core background and plot elements were lifter right from the design documents for the interplay versions of fallout 3 (vaun buren) and fallout 4. in fact when interviwed by RPG codex Chris Avolone lead writter for not only fallout new vegas but every Obsidian game worth mentioning laid the issues with fallout new vegas squarly at the feet of obsdian pointing out bethesda actully offered a extension on the project which was turned down. Even stting aside Avolone its a know fact that Obsdian has a reputation for a culuster ♥♥♥♥ dev cycle going back to the creation of fallout 2 and the black isle days. When taken alongside the likes of Alpha protocol, Kotor 2 , dungeon siege 2, POE and Tyranny all of which suffered form similar techinacal issues the idea they were screwed over by the publisher in every case starts to ring hollow as the one common factor in these games is Obsdian itself and POE and POE2 were self funded and published. (well POE was self funded Deadfire embezeled the money paradox paid to fund tyranny alegedly)\n\n2 map and level design\n\nhave you ever noticed that new vegas seems to reuse a lot of dungeons? well its true bethesda games tend to use a handfull of tilesets for its dungeons im not talking about that im talking Dragon age 2 level cave clones. i can enter a coyote den near prime a death claw infested cave up north or any other number of caves and aside from diffrent inhabitants the caves the same and not in the all subways in fallout 3 used the same tile set same but everything about the interior map is the same aside from loot and hostiles. dragon age 2 got hammered for this ♥♥♥♥ and rightly so and new vegas is the same.\n\nWorld map design open world games live and die based on the world maps and new vegas has one of the worst I've seen large expanses of the interior map are blocked with invisible walls preventing the player from freely crossing the wastland. small hill inclines your character can climb with no issue in some areas are impassable in others forcing backtracking aroundto the set canyons and chokepoints the developers want you to take. well true other bethesda games used invisble walls they were only at map boundries not used to force players around certian paths on the maps supposed playble space and well skyrim did use mountians to route players they were barriers that made sense and they lack any invisble walls meaning if a player really wanted they could climb them. Map layout of the various faction bases in new vegas also pokes some rather massive holes in the story telling but ill cover that in my next point.\n\nNow the primary motive stated in game for all three factions is that they want the hover dam, the NCR and House for power and the legion to move troops. none of these reasons make a lick of sense given what we see in game and what the lore established in prior games. House not only has the vault 21 power plant but a fusion reactor beneth the lucky 38 given the hover dam is a relic from the 1930's and barely functional I find it odd its power output actully matters on a large scale given house has 2 far closer and more easily protected reactors that were built for modren power consumption.\n\nThe NCR as shown in fallout 2 has the abillity to make its own fusion reactors, laser defense grides and has full blown industrial capabillities none of which are show in new vegas. the excuse for this is that its all back west and they dont have it because they over extended but they only overextended to get the dam which they dont need because the ♥♥♥♥ they have back west makes its power pointless particularly given they suposedly cant get a water driven 19390's dynamo working and its stuck barely functional and well its hilarious they rely on mr fantastic to get helios 1 back on line a faction thats just bellow the brootherhood tech wise shouldnt need outside help on aiming mirrors and fixing turbines.\n\nthe legion suposedly needs the dam to move troops and as such has launched to frontal assults on a heavily fortifed narrow chokpoint which both in the intial battle and second battle went way better than it should have. charging a fortifed postion with a largely melee equiped force should have gone like Rorkes drift except worse for the legion because unlike the british the ncr has automatic weapons. now im aware some legion members have guns but so did some of the Zulu and WW1 shows how well mass infantry charges work on entrenched forces. (they dont unless you have heavy air and artilery support) forget the ncr needing to blow up a town the legion never would have it to the dam at all.\n\nBut lets see how much the legion even needs the dam by looking at the wars progress without its capture. the legion has before the game starts removed every ncr military base bellow camp from play either by caputre like nelson or by destroying it outright with the exception of one ranger outpost which falls shortly after the player visits it, Camp Hope is on the verge of colapse via legion presser and camp mcaren is being harrased by fiends who are backed by legion support and has a spy who outside player intervention will criiple the ncr operation at mcaren and on the strip,the strip has 2 of the 3 major familes on the legion payroll and ready to size it on ceasers comand, the NCR refugee camp at bitter springs is assulted during boones personal quest and without the player would be destroyed. camp golf is mostly recruits. during the ending slide camp golf as well as the strip both suffer major legion assults before the dam is taken. combine this with the northren route out of good springs rendered impassable before the game this means the sole supply line to vegas is under if not direct legion control at the very least constant raids and harrasment due to the legion owning most postions west of nippton and south of camp hope. this means well not reflected in the story due to its ♥♥♥♥ writting vegas has no safe way for tourists to vist and the ncr and caravans has outside vertabird airlfits no stable supply line to the dam, vegas or any army camps. the legion as shown in game has without player action won before the game starts dam or no dam.\n\nAside from the issues with the dam another massive issue with the plot exists the pardon. the mailman after braking into the tops is granted a free reset on both ncr and legion reputaion. at this point its not only possible but likely the player has interfeared in both ncr and legion plans actions that could includ siding with escaped convicts to destroy an NCR base, wiping out multiple legion and ncr camps, destroying dozens of political schems like the legions use of the Khauns, white glove and Ghomora factions, killing the legions 3rd in command, openly sided with there sworn foe and various other actions. the get out jail free card for braking into the tops might make sense for some level of reputation reset but if youve gone to villifed before it happens youve done ♥♥♥♥ they shouldnt just forgive. well its stupid in both the ncr and legions cases the legions worse as your invited to meet face to face with ceaser told he need you o destroy houses robots and given back all your guns well deep inside the legions main base. Why didnt ceaser use his own loyal brainwashed men? he cant have them see modren tech dispite them seeing it all over across the wastland, why didnt he use benny? because benny looked shifty. I guess trusting the mailman killer of multiple legion camps, slayer of ceasers left hand man, merc for the NCR, emplyee of house to do it with no legion member verifying his work after. truly ceaser is the smartest and best written character in fallout.\n\nNow the mailman is presented as blank slate hero with no set background in the base game and this was a choice I think that new vegas was improved by making. for the first time in a mainline fallout game you have no set background no family no ties to any faction before the game starts and it was great. Key word being was Lonesome road removes that and adds an impressive background to out intreped mailman. your no longer some no name courior now your a trusted and important NCR asset who was given a vital mission to deliver captured Enclave tech sized at navaro to the divide the site of a settlment which you helped build into a thriving comunity and that you cause the destruction of which triggers the entire politcal situation in the base game by letting the legion escape by closing off the northren ncr supply lines. this raises many many issues as the idea no one in the NCR know who you are after not only having been trusted with enclave tech but crippling the war effort defies explination both the legion and ncr scouts can tell if you kill a patrol in the wastland with not witnesses but they dont know you past history with them and the vast impact your actions at Hopeville caused?\n\nnow for the other lore nitpicks. first shown in broken steel the tesla canon was designed and made post war by lyons BOS members based on the liberty prim eye laser to serve as a counter for enclave air craft following primes loss. Opps nope now its a just a generic pre war energy weapon cause new vegas retconed that ♥♥♥♥ harder than Fallout 4 did the X01. the Khauns were completly wiped out in both fallout 1 and fallout 2 but suprise they get dug out of the waste bin again because we need a raider faction and finally useing the vipers or jakels properly doesnt fit our blatent nostalgia pandering. well were digging up dead factions for nostalgia wank value you know how how the followers a small lecoal group based in LA who Unity kills off in all of fallouts endings? well guess what not only are they still alive they caused the legion! Oh and lets reuse the NCR/BOS war idea from vaun buren even though it makes sense the bos would engage a war after sending a massive amout of troops east like the did before fallout 3 i mean just beacuse the new post interplay lore make that an even dumber idea than it was in vaun bruen doesnt mean we shouldnt just lazily reuse ♥♥♥♥ balck isle wrote years ago. In honest hearts legion players have no real pro legion option if im an agent of ceaser i should be able to work with his proxies and help them not be forced to side with the legions foes or just kill everyone and skip the DLC.\n\noh and some other nitpicks. Low IQ dialoge makes its return in vegas from the old games but unlike fallout 1 and 2 it was quarter assed and comes up rarely leading to to Courior going from normal speech to caveman talk mid conversation like there an Oblvion era begger changing vouice actors. i get dev time was tight but VTMB was made under far tighter constraints and made full game spaning conversation change for malkavians so im still mentioning it. gun runners arsenal adds duplicate weapons bacause of Obsidians half assed coding meaning a gun dispite being the same type a mod was made for cant use said mod bacause its not a GRA gun.\n\nSo in short fallout 4 may be a bad rpg but new vegas is not only a bad rpg but a bad game.\n\nexcept oldworld blues and dead money those were awesome"
