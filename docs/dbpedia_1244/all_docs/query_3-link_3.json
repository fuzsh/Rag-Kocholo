        "text": "Captains, Update 13.8 is just around the corner – let’s get into the details of some of the upcoming features you can expect!\n\nEarly Access to Pan-American Battleships\n\nUpdate 13.8 brings about Early Access to the new Pan-American Battleship line! This line (which includes the Tier VIII Ipiranga, the Tier IX Los Andes and the Tier X Libertad) features powerful secondaries up to 234mm, lots of main battery guns and solid armor schemes. Additionally, they're able to heal up quite nicely after some close-quarters combat with an improved Repair Party that boasts a fast cooldown and restores a higher amount of damage taken. Lastly, you won't want to miss this line's Combat Instructions, which will improve the range, damage and reload time of those already impressive secondary guns. Charge 'em up by landing hits with your main battery (as well as racking up potential damage) and then it's go time!\n\nTo celebrate the introduction of this line, we are also adding the following content:\n\nOrdem e Progresso permanent camouflage for the Ipiranga.\n\nEn Unión y Libertad permanent camouflage for the Los Andes.\n\nPor La Razón o La Fuerza permanent camouflage for the Libertad.\n\nPan-American Battleships Flag.\n\nPermanent camouflages for the above-mentioned ships are still work in progress and will be announced in later publications.\n\nOperations Update\n\nWe're excited to finally give you more information about Operations Update: we have expanded the list of eligible Tiers you can use in certain Operations. Starting with Update 13.8, you can use Tiers VI-X ships as well as Superships in six Operations. And of course we don't plan to stop here - in the future we will continue updating the Operations, so follow the news!\n\nFollowing is the list of Operations that will be affected by these changes in the upcoming Update:\n\nNaval Station Newport\n\nRaptor Rescue\n\nThe Ultimate Frontier\n\nHermes\n\nAegis\n\nCherry Blossom\n\nBecause of these changes matchmaking in the Operations will be working according to the following rules:\n\nThe difference between ships on your team can be +/-1 Tier. For example, a Tier IX ship can be placed with Tier VIII-X ships.\n\nOnce you click the \"Battle!\" button, you will be added to a queue that is suitable for the Tier you selected. Once a team is assembled in queue, a random operation will be launched.\n\nFor Divisions, the difference between ships cannot be more than 1 tier. In terms of which queue you would enter, that would be based on the highest tier ship in your Division. For example, if you had Tier VIII and IX ships in your Division, you will enter the queue as a Tier IX Division.\n\nOperations with Tiers IX-X ships and Superships will have higher tier enemy ships to balance out the difficulty. If you are in a Tier VIII and are paired with Tier IX ships, you will also face these stronger enemies, but the Operations will be properly balanced to accommodate for these cases.\n\nClan Battles Season 27 - \"Asp\"\n\nUpdate 13.8 brings new Clan Battles season with codename \"Asp\"\n\nFormat: 7 vs. 7 playing Tier VIII ships.\n\nShip restrictions\n\nJust like in previous seasons, certain restrictions on the numbers of specific ships per team apply in Clan Battles.\n\nThe restrictions can be set for the entire duration of a season or for specific periods of time. For example, they might be set after the first 2 weeks of a season then replaced with different restrictions a few weeks later. This allows us to promptly react to the current state of the season.\n\nSeason 27 will begin with the following restrictions:\n\nGeneral restrictions\n\nOnly battleships, destroyers and cruisers allowed.\n\nNo more than one battleship per team.\n\nRestrictions on particular ships\n\nNebraska, Lenin and Vladivostok cannot be taken into battles.\n\nLimited the number of Cherbourg, Bayard and Congress. One team may not have more than one of these ships in total.\n\nLimited the number of Cossack, Cossack (В), Kidd and Zhu Que. One team may not have more than two of these ships in total.\n\nLimited the number of Le Fantasque, Le Terrible, Kiev and Split. One team may not have more than two of these ships in total.\n\nMaps:\n\nNew Dawn, Trap, Sea of Fortune, Tears of the Desert, Trident, Loop and Haven.\n\nThe following rules apply for all maps:\n\nNumber of Key Areas: 3\n\nCapture time: 30 seconds\n\nScoring of capture points: 3 points every 4 seconds\n\nBrawls\n\nUpdate 13.8 will bring three Brawls unleashed in different formats.\n\nBrawl #1\n\n4v4\n\nTier IX ships.\n\nOnly Battleships can participate.\n\nDivisions of up to four players.\n\nBrawl #2\n\n5v5\n\nTier X ships.\n\nNo Submarines or Aircraft Carriers allowed.\n\nNo more than 3 Battleships, 4 Cruisers, and 3 Destroyers per team.\n\nDivisions of up to five players.\n\nThis Brawl will be available only in Arms Race mode.\n\nBrawl #3\n\n4v4\n\nTier VIII ships.\n\nNo Submarines or Aircraft Carriers allowed.\n\nNo more than 3 Battleships, 2 Cruisers, and 1 Destroyer per team.\n\nDivisions of up to four players.\n\nThis Brawl will feature Support consumables.\n\nSupport consumables\n\nShip class\n\nConsumable Title\n\nDescription\n\nAction\n\nCruisers\n\nCoordinated Emergency Repairs\n\nRepairs 1% of HP per second. Applies Damage Control Party effect.\n\nAffects all allied ships.\n\nThe consumable's effect does not multiply when activated by several players simultaneously.\n\nNumber of uses: 3\n\nCooldown: 90 seconds\n\nAction time: 10 seconds\n\nBattleships\n\nCall Smoke Curtain\n\nDispatches air group equipped with smoke curtain generator to the indicated area. The air group generates a smoke screen that reduces the risk of being detected by the enemy.\n\nAircraft do not spot enemy ships.\n\nNumber of uses: 3\n\nCooldown: 120 seconds\n\nAction time: 15 seconds\n\nPreparation time: 60 seconds\n\nSmokes duration time: 60 seconds\n\nDestroyers\n\nJoint Fleet Maneuvers\n\nIncreases speed of allied ships by 20%\n\nIncreases acceleration speed by 30%\n\nDecreases turning radius by 30%\n\nAffects all allied ships.\n\nThe consumable effect does not multiply when activated by several players simultaneously.\n\nNumber of uses: 3\n\nCooldown: 60 seconds\n\nAction time: 40 seconds\n\nPreparation time: 20 seconds\n\nContent Additions\n\nLast but not least, take a look at some of the additional content that we are preparing for Update 13.8!\n\nThe Chinese Character “Wu” Patch.\n\nTo get ready for the Mid-Autumn Festival event, we have also added the following items:\n\nThe Osmanthus Blossoms Under Moonlight Permanent Camouflage for the Cleveland.\n\nThe Dragon Moon Flag.\n\nBlessings from Jade Rabbit Patch.\n\nWith the start of Update 13.8, German Cruiser Premium containers, Soviet Era containers and Soviet Era Premium containers will be automatically opened for all players who have them on their accounts. Starting with Update 13.9 these containers will receive content changes, so this way players will obtain the current rewards from the containers before any changes apply.\n\nPlease note that all information in the development blog is preliminary. Announced adjustments and features may change multiple times during testing. The final information will be published on our game's website."
