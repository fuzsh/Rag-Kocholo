        "text": "On May 8, 1945 - known as Victory in Europe Day or V-E Day - celebrations erupted around the world to mark the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe war had been raging for almost five years when U.S. and Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944. The invasion signaled the beginning of the end for Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. In less than a year, Germany would surrender and Hitler would be dead.\n\nBut in his speech to the nation on V-E Day, President Harry S. Truman cautioned that Allies must \"work to finish the war\" by defeating the Japanese in the Pacific.\n\nView the Series of Events\n\nTens of thousands of people filled the streets of New York, New Orleans, London, and cities in Canada, Australia and other Allied nations. There was also a massive celebration in Paris. U.S. forces participated in the celebrations in France, a nation that had borne much of the brunt of the fighting. The Soviets celebrated their own \"Victory Day\" on May 9.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman announced V-E Day to the American people, saying in a radio address: \"Our rejoicing is sobered and subdued by a supreme consciousness of the terrible price we have paid to rid the world of Hitler and his evil band. Let us not forget, my fellow Americans, the sorrow and the heartache, which today abide in the homes of so many of our neighbors - neighbors whose most priceless possession has been rendered as a sacrifice to redeem our liberty.\"\n\nTens of thousands of people filled the streets of New York, New Orleans, London, and cities in Canada, Australia and other Allied nations.
