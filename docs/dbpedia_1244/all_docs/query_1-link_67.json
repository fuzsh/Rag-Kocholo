        "text": "When to Disclose\n\nDisclose when you have any financial, employment, personal, or family relationship with a brand.\n\nFinancial relationships aren’t limited to money. Disclose the relationship if you got anything of value to mention a product.\n\nIf a brand gives you free or discounted products or other perks and then you mention one of its products, make a disclosure even if you weren’t asked to mention that product.\n\nDon’t assume your followers already know about your brand relationships.\n\nMake disclosures even if you think your evaluations are unbiased.\n\nKeep in mind that tags, likes, pins, and similar ways of showing you like a brand or product can be endorsements.\n\nIf posting from abroad, U.S. law applies if it’s reasonably foreseeable that the post will affect U.S. consumers. Foreign laws might also apply.\n\nIf you have no brand relationship and are just telling people about a product you bought and happen to like, you don’t need to declare that you don’t have a brand relationship.\n\nHow to Disclose\n\nMake sure people will see and understand the disclosure.\n\nPlace it so it’s hard to miss.\n\nThe disclosure should be placed with the endorsement message itself.\n\nDisclosures are likely to be missed if they appear only on an ABOUT ME or profile page, at the end of posts or videos, or anywhere that requires a person to click MORE.\n\nDon’t mix your disclosure into a group of hashtags or links.\n\nIf your endorsement is in a picture on a platform like Snapchat and Instagram Stories, superimpose the disclosure over the picture and make sure viewers have enough time to notice and read it.\n\nIf making an endorsement in a video, the disclosure should be in the video and not just in the description uploaded with the video. Viewers are more likely to notice disclosures made in both audio and video. Some viewers may watch without sound and others may not notice superimposed words.\n\nIf making an endorsement in a live stream, the disclosure should be repeated periodically so viewers who only see part of the stream will get the disclosure.\n\nUse simple and clear language.\n\nSimple explanations like “Thanks to Acme brand for the free product” are often enough if placed in a way that is hard to miss.\n\nSo are terms like “advertisement,” “ad,” and “sponsored.”\n\nOn a space-limited platform like Twitter, the terms “AcmePartner” or “Acme Ambassador” (where Acme is the brand name) are also options.\n\nIt’s fine (but not necessary) to include a hashtag with the disclosure, such as #ad or #sponsored.\n\nDon’t use vague or confusing terms like “sp,” “spon,” or “collab,” or stand-alone terms like “thanks” or “ambassador,” and stay away from other abbreviations and shorthand when possible.\n\nThe disclosure should be in the same language as the endorsement itself.\n\nDon’t assume that a platform’s disclosure tool is good enough, but consider using it in addition to your own, good disclosure.\n\nWhat Else to Know\n\nYou can’t talk about your experience with a product you haven’t tried.\n\nIf you’re paid to talk about a product and thought it was terrible, you can’t say it’s terrific.\n\nYou can’t make up claims about a product that would require proof the advertiser doesn’t have – such as scientific proof that a product can treat a health condition.\n\nFor More Information\n\nHave more questions? The FTC’s Endorsement Guides: What People Are Asking is an FTC staff publication that answers many questions about the use of endorsements, including in social media, with many helpful examples."
