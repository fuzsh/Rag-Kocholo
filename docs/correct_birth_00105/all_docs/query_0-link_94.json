He is the son of former Philadelphia 76ers player Joe \"Jellybean\" Bryant. Bryant's combination of talent, skill, dedication, and work ethic have been instrumental in establishing his status as one of the premier athletes in the NBA. With his growing list of individual and team accomplishments, the 27-year old Bryant is expected to eventually rank among the greatest players in NBA history.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nKobe Bryant was born the only son of Joe and Pam Bryant. At the age of six, he, his two sisters and his parents moved to Italy, where his father began playing professional basketball. While living there, he gradually became accustomed to the lifestyle and subsequently learned to speak Italian fluently. In 1991, the Bryants moved back to the United States. After a spectacular high school career in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion, at Lower Merion High School, Bryant achieved national recognition as a prodigious basketball talent. While his SAT score of 1080[1] would have ensured his basketball scholarship to various top-tier colleges, Bryant eventually scrapped his original plans of continuing on to college by making the leap from high school directly to the NBA, a bold but controversial decision made by the then 17-year-old, the first guard ever to bypass college basketball.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nIt was during this time that the 20-year-old Bryant first met 16-year-old Vanessa Laine on the set of a music video where Laine was working as a background dancer. The two began dating and were engaged six months later. They married on April 18, 2001 in Dana Point, California, while Laine was still a senior at Marina High School in Huntington Beach, California. Bryant's parents initially were staunchly opposed to the marriage for a number of reasons, citing the couple's young age as their primary concern. This disagreement resulted in an estrangement period of over two years, during which Kobe Bryant did not have any contact with his parents.\n\nThe Bryants' first child, daughter Natalia Diamante Bryant, was born on January 19, 2003. Soon after Natalia's birth, Kobe Bryant reconciled his differences with his parents, and the family was once again on good terms. Vanessa Bryant suffered a miscarriage due to an ectopic pregnancy in the spring of 2005. Their second daughter, Gianna Maria-Onore Bryant, was born on May 1, 2006, and happened to be born within 6 minutes of Shaquille O'Neal's daughter, Me'arah Sanaa.\n\nEarly NBA career[]\n\n1996 Draft[]\n\nBryant's career trajectory as an NBA player out of high school has been nothing short of exceptional. Even before he was chosen as the 13th pick overall by the Hornets in 1996, Bryant had made a lasting impression on then-Lakers general manager Jerry West, who immediately foresaw the potential in Bryant's basketball talent during pre-draft workouts. West stated that Bryant's workout was one of the best he had ever witnessed. After overseeing the arrival of Shaquille O'Neal to Los Angeles, West continued his quest to return the Lakers to championship status by trading then-starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets for the 18-year old Bryant.\n\nGrowing pains[]\n\nBryant was primarily labeled a work-in-progress by then-Laker coach Del Harris during his first two seasons with the Lakers, in which he played mostly off the bench under guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel. In his first season, he played limited minutes initially but this changed as Bryant received more playing time as the season continued. While Bryant was a promising young talent, his inexperience was soon exposed. With the Lakers facing elimination in a playoff game against the Utah Jazz, late in the game Bryant missed three crucial shots, all air balls. The Lakers lost the game and were eliminated. The failure was a humbling one for Bryant, but veteran Antoine Carr of the Jazz took time immediately after the game to seek out the young Bryant and offer words of encouragement.\n\nIn Bryant's second season, he received more playing time and began showing more of his abilities as a talented young guard. However, he still came off the bench behind a more experienced guard in Eddie Jones. In a somewhat controversial trade, the Lakers traded Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell for veteran All-Star forward Glen Rice. The move was unpopular with Laker fans, who were particularly fond of Jones, and it also hurt the Lakers prospects for winning a title in the lockout season. However, it would put the pieces in place for the team's eventual championship run in the following season. This move had added significance in that it thrust Bryant into regular starting role in the NBA for the first time. While his statistics were impressive, he was still a young guard who lacked the experience to complement Shaquille O'Neal and significantly help the team win a championship.\n\nChampionship years[]\n\nHowever, Bryant's fortunes would soon change when Phil Jackson became coach for the Los Angeles Lakers. After years of steady improvement, Bryant had become one of the premier shooting guards in the league, a notion that was indicated by his annual presence in the league's All-NBA, All-Star, and All-Defensive teams. The Los Angeles Lakers became perennial championship contenders under Bryant and O'Neal, who teamed up to form one of the deadliest center-guard combinations in NBA history. Their success gave the Lakers three consecutive NBA championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n\nEnd of the dynasty[]\n\nIn the 2002-03 NBA season, Bryant had by far his best season, statistically. He averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic scoring run, posting 40 or more points per game in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. In addition, he averaged 5.9 rebounds, 6.9 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, all career highs. Bryant was voted on to the All-NBA offensive and defensive 1st teams for the 1st time. After finishing 50-32 in the regular season, however, the Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference Semifinals to the eventual NBA champion San Antonio Spurs in six games.\n\nMadison Avenue appeal[]\n\nBryant's image and accomplishments on and off the basketball court made him one of basketball's most popular and marketable players. He became a spokesperson for major corporations such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola. For several years, he had an exclusive apparel and shoe deal with Adidas but is currently under a four-year, $45 million advertising contract with Nike [2].\n\nWork ethic[]\n\nMuch of Kobe Bryant's meteoric rise to NBA superstardom is attributed to his consummate work ethic. In each of his years in the league, Bryant showed improvement in all areas of his game, from offense to strength to defense. On the court he showed himself to be a very composed and competitive player with impressive concentration, able to deliver the toughest and in clutch shots at the times most needed. These attributes allowed him to perform greatly when rising to the level of a premier player in the NBA.\n\nSexual assault allegation[]\n\nAccusation and court cases[]\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the news media reported that the sherriff's office in Eagle County, Colorado had arrested Bryant in connection with an investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year old hotel employee. Bryant had checked into The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera hotel in Edwards, Colorado in advance of having knee surgery near there the next day. The woman in question, eventually identified as Katelyn Faber, accused Bryant of raping her in his hotel room the night before the surgery.\n\nLaw enforcement officials interviewed Bryant about the incident following his surgery.[3] Later that week, they arrested Bryant, releasing him immediately [[Bail bond|on bond]dsffasdsdafsadfsdafdasfasdfasdfsdfadfasasdfdfas], and news of the arrest became public two days after that. Several days later, the Eagle County District Attorney's office filed a formal charge against Bryant.\n\nAfter he was formally charged, Bryant held a news conference in which he adamantly denied having raped Faber. He confessed to having an adulterous sexual encounter with her, but insisted that everything that happened between the two had been consensual.\n\nThe case's pre-trial hearings went on through the 2003-2004 NBA season, a number of times causing Bryant to have to be in court in Colorado during the day, then immediately fly to another part of the country to play in the Lakers' game that night. Bryant generally performed well in such games, though the on-going proceedings and the media attention on them served as a continuing distraction, both to Bryant personally, and to the Laker team as a whole.[4][5]\n\nAs the hearings went on, it became clear that Bryant's defense team was going to aggressively attack Faber's credibility.[6] Various media reports about evidence that Bryant's defense was planning to present caused widespread speculation that chances of the prosecution overcoming reasonable doubt and obtaining a conviction were dwindling. Amid both such speculation and the intense scrutiny of her personal life, Faber decided to withdraw her support of the criminal prosecution and informed prosecutors that she would be unwilling to testify in the case. With that development, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the case against Bryant, with District Attorney Mark Hurlbert citing Faber's unwillingness to continue as his reason for doing so. As part of the overall agreement, Bryant issued a statement in which he continued to assert that he believed his encounter with Faber was consensual, but acknowledged that Faber \"did not and does not view this incident the same way that I did.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the trial, Faber filed a civil lawsuit against Bryant over the incident. The two sides ultimately settled that lawsuit, with the specific terms of the settlement being undisclosed to the public. Just as some media sources speculated that the criminal case was dropped by the prosecution due to Faber's reluctance to expose the various details of her personal life, others also speculated that Bryant had decided to settle the civil case out of court so that the details of his own personal life would not be made public.\n\nAftermath and image problems[]\n\nKobe Bryant had always received an abundance of criticism regarding his play on the basketball court. Detractors have long branded him as a selfish, egotistic player who pads his own achievements at the expense of his team. However, one factor which had helped to uphold a generally positive public image even despite such criticism had been the public's perception of him as \"squeaky-clean\" with regard to his moral behaviors. The public had become accustomed to tales of high-profile professional athletes indulging gratuitously in a wild nightlife rife with alcohol, drugs and/or sexual promiscuity. But Bryant had a reputation as one who eschewed such behaviors, preferring to keep quietly to himself, even to the point of his being criticized for not socializing enough with his teammates. The events surrounding the alleged sexual assault changed that dynamic drastically. At best, he was guilty of the adultery to which he had confessed. And when the police transcript of his interview with investigators later became public, it revealed that Bryant had further confessed to investigators that his adultery with Faber was not an isolated incident. He had acknowledged that unbeknownst to his wife, he had been maintaining an on-going affair with another woman in New York.[7] But still worse was the fact that despite the lack of a criminal conviction, many people believed him to be guilty of rape.\n\nBryant previously had a positive moral image but, with his image so badly tarnished, the public's perception of Bryant plummeted, and his endorsement contracts with McDonald's, Nutella, and Ferrero SpA were terminated. His ball play was also viewed more critically. Sales figures from NBA merchandisers indicated that sales of replicas of Bryant's jersey fell far off of their previous highs.\n\nFurthering the blemish upon Bryant's reputation was the public rift through the Laker core of Bryant, O'Neal, and coach Phil Jackson. In well-documented episodes throughout their careers together on the Lakers, mainly over leadership of the team, O'Neal and Bryant have feuded in dramatic fashion. The 2000-era Lakers were built around the dominant center in O'Neal but Bryant seemed to tire of his formal role as \"second fiddle\" on the team. Though there were periods when the two seemed to get along very well, during the rougher times, O'Neal would not be shy about launching criticisms toward teammates, usually without explicitly mentioning names, but with details that left no doubt he was referring primarily to Bryant. Bryant only responded publicly on one occasion, in an interview with Jim Gray of ESPN, where he called O'Neal \"fat\" and bristled at O'Neal's previous characterizations of their relationship as \"big brother\" and \"little brother.\"\n\nThe sexual assault allegations ultimately led to one of the largest blows to the relationship between Bryant and O'Neal, as well as serious damage to Bryant's personal reputation among other NBA players. According to a supplemental report added to the original transcript, when questioned by the police during their investigation, in an apparent attempt to deflect questioning, Bryant had brought up alleged extramarital affairs by O'Neal. [8] If Bryant made such a comment, it likely meant that in order to extricate himself from his own situation, he had either made false allegations of adultery against O'Neal, or, even if the allegations were true, had betrayed O'Neal's confidence in that matter to investigators. Either explanation served only to further sully Bryant's image.\n\nOther conflicts[]\n\nOther conflicts have also done their share of damage to Bryant's image. In addition to his problems with O'Neal, Bryant feuded with other teammates during his career. In an isolated incident, he allegedly punched then teammate Samaki Walker in the face outside of the team bus. In 2004, a dispute between Bryant and former teammate Karl Malone became public prior to Malone's expected re-signing with the Lakers. Bryant claimed Malone had made inappropriate comments to Bryant's wife. Malone claimed the comments were in jest and that Bryant was overreacting. In the subsequent months, rather than re-join Bryant and the Lakers, Malone turned his attention to the possibility of joining another team, but ultimately decided to retire. More recently, there have been rumors of Bryant clashing with teammate Lamar Odom which both have denied and attribute to media rumors.\n\nBryant also clashed with coach Jackson. While remarkably efficient in Jackson's \"triangle offense,\" Bryant had a personal distaste for Jackson's brand of basketball and subsequently called it \"boring.\" In games, Bryant would often disregard the set offense completely to experiment with his own one-on-one moves, incensing the normally calm Jackson. Bryant managed to test Jackson's patience enough that the \"Zen Master\" even demanded that Bryant be traded, although Laker management rejected the request.\n\nThe end of the Trifecta[]\n\nJackson's coaching contract ran out following the 2003–04 season and the Lakers failed to produce a championship despite sporting 4 Hall-of-Fame caliber players: Karl Malone, Gary Payton, O'Neal, and Bryant. Bryant opted out of his contract and became free agent, thus having the ability to choose to leave for another team if he desired. Amid that atmosphere, Jackson was not invited back to coach the team. Many fans attributed Jackson's departure directly to the wishes of Bryant, whom Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss championed. O'Neal, indicating that he felt the franchise was indeed pandering to Bryant with the departure of Jackson, demanded to be traded, and was dealt to the Miami Heat.\n\nBryant proceeded to consider playing for the Lakers' STAPLES Center suitemates, the Los Angeles Clippers, raising the possibility that the Lakers had made such drastic moves, perhaps primarily to please Bryant, and yet would lose him anyway. Ultimately though, Bryant did re-sign with the Lakers for the veteran's maximum of seven years at over US$136 million.\n\nUnquestioned leader[]\n\nWith O'Neal gone, Bryant became the Lakers' unquestioned leader of the team going into the 2004-2005 season. As it turned out, however, his first season at the helm of a team would prove to be a very rocky one. With his reputation so badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year, Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the season.\n\nA particularly damaging salvo came from Phil Jackson in his book The Last Season: A Team in Search of its Soul. The book detailed the sordid events of the Lakers' tumultuous 2003–04 season and hurled numerous harsh criticisms of Bryant. Along with other unsavory adjectives, Jackson called Bryant \"uncoachable.\"\n\nThen, midway through the season, Rudy Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach, citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion. Without \"Rudy T,\" stewardship of the remainder of the Lakers' season fell to career assistant coach Frank Hamblen. Despite the fact that Bryant was the league's second leading scorer at 27.6 points per game, the Lakers floundered and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. This year signified a drop in Bryant's overall status in the NBA by not making the NBA All Defensive Team and being demoted to All NBA Third Team.\n\n2005-06 Season[]\n\nThe 2005-06 NBA Season would mark a crossroads in Bryant's basketball career. Despite past differences with Bryant, Phil Jackson returned to coach the Lakers and by all appearnces, the two men worked together well the second time around, leading the Lakers back into the NBA Playoffs. The team posted a 45-37 record, an eight-game improvement over the previous season, and played well enough in the first round of the playoffs to come within a game of eliminating the second-seeded Phoenix Suns before finally falling.\n\nScoring[]\n\nAccomplishments[]\n\nIn many ways, however, the team's improvement in 2005-06 was often overshadowed by the spectacular individual scoring accomplishments posted by Bryant which resulted in the finest statistical season of his career:\n\nIn December, Bryant scored 62 points despite playing only three quarters of play against the Dallas Mavericks. Entering the fourth quarter Bryant had, by himself, outscored the entire Mavericks team 62-61, the only time a player has done this through three quarters since the advent of the 24-second shot clock.\n\nIn January, Bryant scored 81 points in a game against the Toronto Raptors. In addition to breaking the previous franchise record of 71 set by Elgin Baylor, his point total in that game was second in NBA history only to Wilt Chamberlain's legendary 100-point game in 1962.\n\nAlso in January, Bryant became the first player since 1964, and the only player aside from Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor to score 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\n\nFor the month of January, Bryant averaged 43.4 per game, the eighth highest single month scoring average in NBA history, and highest for any player other than Chamberlain.\n\nBy the end of the season, Bryant had also set Lakers single-season franchise records for the most 40-point games (27) and most points scored (2,832), among others.\n\nBryant won the league's scoring title for the first time, posting the highest scoring average (35.4) since Michael Jordan's 37.1 average in 1986-87.\n\nBryant finished in fourth-place in the voting for the 2006 NBA Most Valuable Player Award, but also received 22 first place votes — second only to winner Steve Nash, and by far the highest number of first-place votes Bryant had ever received in his career.\n\nDebate[]\n\nBryant's scoring accomplishments were accompanyied by controversy, however. Throughout his career, some have considered Bryant to be a \"ball hog\". Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Plaschke has described himself as \"someone who has spent years writing that Bryant should stop hogging the ball.\" [9] With Bryant averaging over 27 field goal attempts per game in 2005-06, the long-standing debate over whether Bryant's shooting the ball that often is detrimental to the Lakers as a team took on a renewed fervor.\n\nCritics claimed that Bryant's shot total inhibited the development and confidence of other Laker players and indicated that he does not play true \"team\" basketball. During an early season TNT post-game broadcast, analysts Charles Barkley and Reggie Miller sharply criticized Bryant for attempting over 30 shots in a single game, something Bryant would do frequently over the course of the season.\n\nOthers, such as ESPN columnist Marc Stein[10] and Salon.com columnist King Kaufman [11], argued that the players currently on the Lakers are not nearly as talented as Bryant, and that therefore the team has its best chance to win when Bryant attempts the substantially more shots than any of his teammates.\n\nOther notable events[]\n\nWhen the Lakers faced the Miami Heat on January 16, 2006, Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that is believed to signify the end of the feud that had festered between the two players since O'Neal's acrimonious departure from Los Angeles. A month later, at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game, the two could be observed laughing and joking together on several occasions.\n\nIn late January 2006, Bryant officially committed to play basketball for the USA National Basketball team. He is expected to play in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, once the team qualifies.\n\nLate in the season, it was reported that Bryant would change his jersey number from #8 to #24 at the start of the 2006-07 NBA season. #24 was Bryant's first high school number, before changing to #33.[12] After the Lakers' season ended, Bryant made a television appearance on TNT, where he stated that when he came into the league, he wanted #24, but it was unavailable. He went on to say that he believed the new number signified the start of the second half of his career.\n\nCurrent image[]\n\nBryant's public image reached its nadir in the wake of his 2003 trial for sexual assault and his highly publicized feud with then-teammate Shaquille O'Neal. Bryant lost a number of lucrative corporate sponsorships due to the trial, and almost certainly lost some fans due to the trial and the feud. While his image problems have not completely disappeared in the wake of his high-scoring season in 2005-2006, he has recovered somewhat in that realm. Sales of replicas of his jersey, while not as high as they were before the case, are nonetheless up significantly, placing Bryant among the league leaders. [13]\n\nOne of the legacies of these image problems is that Bryant is now one of the most polarizing individuals in the NBA. He retains a loyal fan base, no doubt expanded by his most recent accomplishments on the court and a more fan-friendly media personality (e.g. meeting with victims of Hurricane Katrina and participating in the associated NBA charity exhibition game in 2005). But there remains a large segment of the NBA fan populace that is just as vehemently scornful of him as his fans are adoring.\n\nThe rebound in Bryant's public perception has opened up additional opportunities for commercial endorsements. In February 2006, Nike launched a new signature shoe for Bryant, dubbed Zoom Kobe I. With Bryant having been completely absent from the product endorsement scene since 2003, the campaign around the shoe marked the corporate world's first effort to test whether Bryant's image has recovered enough to make marketing him a profitable endeavor. The television commercials promoting the shoe featured a \"love me or hate me\" theme with Bryant directly addressing the fact that the public's reaction to him is so highly polarized.\n\nAlleged media bias[]\n\nSome of Bryant's supporters have alleged that the negative aspects of his image have led to a bias against Bryant among certain members of the sports news media. Bill Plaschke wrote that coverage critical of Bryant's 81-point game, such as that of Ian O'Conner in USA Today [14], showed that \"lots of people don't like [Bryant]; lots of people will never like him.\"[15]\n\nThose who purport the existence of such a bias also cite the voting results for the 2006 MVP award — an award selected by the media. Bryant finished fourth overall in the voting, behind the Phoenix Suns' Steve Nash, the Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James, and the Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki. Of the 125 members of the media who voted, 22 ranked Bryant first, while another 22 left him off the five-man ballot entirely.[16]. The Lakers finished 7th in the Western Conference, perhaps hurting Bryant's candidacy, while the Suns, Cavaliers, and Mavericks all finished in the top 4 in their respective conferences.\n\nColumnist Jason Whitlock suggested that Bryant's MVP finish was due in part to season-long and unfair criticism from influential analyst Charles Barkley.[17] Despite his previous criticism of Bryant, Barkley himself also took issue with the number of voters who excluded Bryant altogether from their ballots. Barkley declared on ESPN Radio that \"there's no way in good conscience you can leave Kobe Bryant off of your top-five MVP ballots.\" On TNT, Barkley opined that the voters who had done so should never be allowed to vote again.

[2]\n\nLate-game heroics[]\n\nThroughout much of his career, Kobe Bryant has been heralded as one of the premier \"clutch\" scorers in the NBA. In a sense, this term refers to a player's ability to take over and lead his team to victory under pressure during tight games, notably at the end of regulation or in overtime periods. Bryant's exceptional ability to will his team to victory in the last seconds of a close game has often been compared to the legendary Michael Jordan's capacity to do the same thing. According to an NBA poll directed at general managers throughout the league before the 2005–06 season, Bryant was overwhelmingly voted as the player they would choose to take the last shot during the crucial moments of basketball games.\n\nInterestingly though, there are some who question whether Bryant's reputation in this regard is fully justified. One prominent such group would be APBRmetricians, who conducted statistical analyses of players' peformances in the final five minutes of close games during the 2004 NBA Playoffs and most of the 2004-05 regular season. Their results results indicated that Bryant's reputation for performing \"in the clutch\" exceeds his actual deeds in that regard.[57], [58]\n\nIn February of 2006, USA Today conducted an analysis which took into account NBA players' scoring, rebounding, assist and turnover statistics within the final two minutes and in overtime periods of the games of the 2005-2006 NBA season prior to the All-Star break. Kobe Bryant's name was noticeably absent from the league's individual leaders in every category, as were the Lakers in every team category. Moreover, from the 2003-2004 season through March 16, 2006, Bryant has hit a lower percentage of his \"game-winning\" shot attempts (defined as a shot taken when one's team is tied or trailing by one or two points, and with 24 seconds or less left in the game) than the overall league average, and a substantially lower percentage of such shots than many other players, such as Allen Iverson, Michael Redd, and Jalen Rose, who are not nearly as widely lauded for late-game heroics as is Bryant.[59] Nevertheless, Bryant has both made and missed several game-winning shots so far in his career.\n\nThose who champion Bryant as a clutch performer, and those who question his status in that regard, each found dramatic support for their arguments during the Lakers' first-round loss to the Phoenix Suns during the 2006 NBA playoffs. In Game 4 of the series, Bryant hit two \"game-winning\" shots: one with .7 seconds to send the game into overtime and one at the buzzer in overtime to win the game. With the latter shot capping an improbable Laker comeback to give the team a seemingly commanding 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series, Bryant described it as \"the most fun shot I've ever hit.\"\n\nHowever, in Game 6, with the score tied and the clock running out, Bryant again found the ball in his hands. With a chance to win not only the game, but also end the series, this time his shot, fired over the outstretched arm of defender Shawn Marion, came up well short of hitting the rim. Referring to Marion's ability to contest Bryant's shot, Bryant later said that he \"forgot who was guarding me\", and thus failed to adjust his approach accordingly on that final play. Bryant's inability to clinch the series on that play would prove costly, as the Lakers lost the game in overtime and then lost the series in Game 7, becoming only the eighth team in NBA history to lose a playoff series after having taken a 3-1 lead.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBryant's 81-point game was the 666th game of his professional career. It came from 66 shots, 46 from the field and 20 from the free-throw line. His 55 second-half points in that same game matched the single-game high of the NBA's all-time leading scorer, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nBryant wore jersey #33 while at Lower Merion High School. With that number retired by the Lakers (in honor of Abdul-Jabbar), Bryant chose #8 upon entering the NBA because his ABCD Adidas Camp number in high school was 143: 1+4+3 = 8. He has said that the switch to #8 was easy because he wore that number when he was a child playing in the Italian leagues. As a child, he chose #8 because his favorite Italian player, Mike D'Antoni, wore the number. (Ironically, D'Antoni currently coaches the Phoenix Suns, who eliminated the Lakers from the 2006 NBA playoffs.)\n\nBryant currently endorses Nike.\n\nBryant speaks fluent Italian and is currently studying Spanish.\n\nBryant has two sisters, Shaya and Sharia.\n\nBryant lists Star Wars as his all-time favorite movie.\n\nBryant has a number of nicknames including Black Mamba, Three Rings or Lord of the Rings (when at Rucker Park), Kobe-Wan Kenobi, and most recently, Mr. 81. He lists Black Mamba as his favorite.\n\nBryant took R&B singer Brandy to his senior prom in 1996.\n\nBryant's first name was given after the famous Kobe beef of Japan.\n\nBryant has guest starred on television shows Moesha and In the House and also Sister Sister. He also made a cameo appearance on Hang Time.\n\nBryant appeared in the video for the Destiny's Child song, \"Bug A Boo\". He also recorded a verse for a remix of their hit song \"Say My Name\".\n\nBryant recorded, but did not release, a rap album. He guest rapped on a remix of Brian McKnight's song, \"Hold Me\" and released a single called \"K.O.B.E\" featuring Tyra Banks.\n\nBryant is one of the candidates to appear on the cover of NBA Live 2007 video game.\n\nBryant's 2nd daughter and Shaquille O'Neal's 2nd daughter were born on the same day: May 1, 2006.\n\nHe was also on the cover of Nintendo 64 games NBA Courtside and NBA Courtside 2 early in his career. Later, he was on the cover of NBA Courtside 2002, for Gamecube.\n\nNotes[]\n\n[]\n\nProfile at NBA.com\n\n模板:Espn nba\n\nProfile at Basketball-Reference.com\n\nProfile at the IMDb.com\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of active NBA players who have spent their entire career with one team\n\nList of National Basketball Association players with 60 or more points in a game\n\n模板:Start box 模板:Succession box 模板:Succession box |}\n\n模板:Persondata\n\ncs:Kobe Bryant de:Kobe Bryant es:Kobe Bryant fr:Kobe Bryant it:Kobe Bryant he:???? ??????? nl:Kobe Bryant ja:??????????? no:Kobe Bryant pl:Kobe Bryant pt:Kobe Bryant sv:Kobe Bryant tr:Kobe Bryant [[zh:??�??]]"
