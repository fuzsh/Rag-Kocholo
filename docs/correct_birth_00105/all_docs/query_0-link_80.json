        "text": "Nike’s Kobe line will soon see an influx of releases, including a version of the Kobe 4 Protro inspired by his birthplace.\n\nThe Nike Kobe 4 Protro “Philly” is slated as one of three Kobe sneakers to release on the same day in April. A blue, white and red color scheme mirrors those of Philadelphia Phillies and 76ers, the latter of which Bryant’s dad Joe played for for the first four years of his professional career. Glossy star motifs on the collar lean into the city’s history as the birthplace of America, while a “08-23-78” print on the insole calls out the day Kobe was born in Philadelphia.\n\nThe “Philly” colorway is one of the Kobe 4’s original from 2009 and is now make its first return for the retooled Protro edition of the model. Changes from the Kobe 4’s first run are minimal, however, with the primary difference being a softer Phylon midsole. Otherwise, the shoe still features the same Zoom Air unit in the heel and Flywire technology in the upper.\n\nWatch on FN\n\nRelated\n\nIn addition to the “Philly” 4, the Kobe 6 Protro “Camo” and Kobe 8 Protro “Venice Beach” are also slated to release on the same day. The Kobe 4 “Girl Dad” will also follow at the end of May.\n\nBryant was born in Philadelphia during his father’s playing during the 76ers and, although the elder Bryant’s career would see the family move to Italy, the younger one would return to the city to play for Lower Merion High School in the suburbs.\n\nThe Nike Kobe 4 Protro “Philly” will release April 13 through the Snkrs app and select third-party retailers. Pricing is set at $190.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nIan Servantes is a Senior Trending News Editor for Footwear News specializing in sneaker coverage.
