He even knew the local slang,” Petrucci added.\n\nBryant, the Philly-born, 18-time NBA All-Star who won five championships and became one of the most iconic basketball players of his generation over a 20-year career with the L.A. Lakers, died on Jan. 26, 2020 in a helicopter crash near Calabasas, Calif. He was 41.\n\nHis 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others also perished in the crash.\n\nBryant, who retired in 2016, would make it a point to help Italian players acclimate to the NBA, as he always held a strong connection to the Old Country.\n\nOther victims of the crash included John Altobelli, a longtime baseball coach at Orange Coast College, a junior college in Costa Mesa. Calif., as well as Altobelli’s wife, Keri, and daughter Alyssa, according to The New York Times.\n\nKobe is survived by his three children: Natalia Diamante, 17; Bianka Bella, 3; and Capri Kobe, less than 1; and his wife Vanessa Bryant, 37."
