        "text": "The Bryants spent the 1991-92 European season in France after Joe latched on with a new team. The move was hardest on Kobe and his sisters, who endured a two-hour daily commute to an international school in Switzerland. Joe retired after the campaign ended, and he and Pam decided it was time to return to the U.S. Shaya and Sharia were thinking about college, and Kobe was ready to begin high school.\n\nAfter Joe accepted an assistant coaching job at La Salle, the Bryants bought a house in Ardmore, a well-to-do suburb about 10 miles northeast of Philadelphia. Kobe viewed the change in scenery with mixed feelings. Connecting with American kids was difficult for him, and he worried about fitting in socially.\n\nOn the court, Kobes transition was seamless. He was one of the Sonny Hill Leagues top players during the summer of 1992, then he entered Lower Merion High School and made the varsity basketball team for the Aces. The following spring he began going to the gym at Temple University looking for pick-up games. Among those who befriended him was Eddie Jones, one of the Owls starting guards.\n\nLife outside of hoops wasnt quite as easy. A solid B student, Kobe struggled to find common ground with his classmates. In Europe he had been sheltered from many of the temptations and pressures faced by teenagers in the U.S. Naturally quiet and reserved, he got a crash-course in dealing with the daily dramas of high school hallways.\n\nBy his junior year Kobe felt comfortable in his surroundings. He also began to make major strides in his hoops career. At 6-5 (and with another growth spurt likely), he decided his basketball future was probably in the backcourt, and began to think and practice like a guard. This was fine by Lower Merion coach Gregg Downer, who liked the mismatches Kobe presented to opponents. In truth, between the expert advice the youngster received from his father and competition he faced each year in Philadelphias top summer leagues, he would have been a handful for just about any high-school defender.\n\nKobe sizzled during the 1994-95 season. The junior averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year. Kobe also unveiled his devastating cross-over dribble during the campaign. He learned the move from God Shammgod, a teammate on his summer AAU squad.\n\nAfter Kobes breakout year, college recruiters from across the country came knocking. The soon-to-be senior boasted excellent grades and SAT scores, so academics would not be an obstacle. At the top of his list were Duke, North Carolina, Villanova and Michigan. But when Chicago schoolboy Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the NBA Draft in June of 1995, Kobe began seriously considering going directly to the pros. That summer, Joe arranged for his son to work out with members of the 76ers, and Kobe was awesome. He also made a big impression on scouts at the ABCD All-America camp at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey.\n\nAs a senior, Kobes sparkling play put Lower Merion on the high-school basketball map. The Aces posted a 32-3 record and captured their first state title in 42 years. The schools name was in the newspapers constantly, college coaches filled the stands for every game, and coach Downer received invitations to several prestigious tournaments. Kobe finished the year with a scoring average of 30.8 points, pushing his four-year points total to 2,883, which shattered the Pennsylvania record set four decades earlier by Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nThe fun really began when the season ended. When an Italian League team approached Joe about becoming its coach, management insisted that his son be part of the deal. Meanwhile, with several other top high school seniorsincluding Tim Thomas of New Jersey, Lester Earl of Louisiana, and Jermaine ONeal of South Carolinathinking about going to the NBA, Kobe did nothing to squelch rumors that he would do the same. The 17-year-old added fuel to the fire when he wowed the scouts at the 1996 Beach Ball Classic in South Carolina.\n\nKobe ended the speculation that spring at a press conference in the Lower Merion gym. Before dozens of reporters and camera crewsand with friends from the group Boyz II Men nearbyhe announced that he had decided to take his talents to the NBA. A short time later he signed on with the William Morris Agency, then inked multi-year endorsement deals with adidas and Sprite.\n\nThe news was greeted with mixed reviews. Some sportswriters compared Kobe to Grant Hill and Anfernee Hardaway at the same age, only with better offensive skills. They believed the teenager was ready. Others criticized Joe and Pam for pushing their son into a bad decision. Kobe bristled at the suggestion that his parents didnt have his best interests at heart.\n\nDebate began almost immediately about whether Kobe would be a lottery pick, as Garnett had been the previous June. The top four selections in the draft would likely be Marcus Camby, Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury, and Ray Allen. From there, the college talent thinned quickly.\n\nThe Lakers and their president, Jerry West, were among the few teams convinced that Kobe was destined for greatness. In a private workout for the club, the teenager impressed with his leaping ability and wide array of offensive skills. The Lakers asked Kobe to play one-on-one against Dontae Jones, and he blew the Mississippi State star off the court. Los Angeles also felt Kobes upbringing was an advantage. As the son of an NBA player, he would be able to assimilate into the league better than other rookies.\n\nOn draft day, West worked his magic. First he tabbed Derek Fisher, a defensive-minded point guard out of Arkansas-Little Rock, with the 24th pick in the first round. Then he put a call into the Charlotte Hornets, who had grabbed Kobe at #13, and after a little haggling arranged a trade for Vlade Divac. The move created extra salary space, which Los Angeles used to sign Orlando free agent Shaquille ONeal. The building blocks of a new dynasty were in place.\n\nKobe was ecstatic to join the Lakers. Not only was he starting his pro career with his favorite team, but he would not be expected to be its savior. In addition to Shaq, Los Angeles had exceptional talent, including Nick Van Exel, Elden Campbell, and Kobes old pal, Eddie Jones. An added bonus was coach Del Harris, who had been the head man in Houston for Joe Bryants one season there.\n\nKobe signed a three-year, $3.5 million contract with the Lakers, then averaged 25 points per game for their summer-league team. He bought a home in Pacific Palisades, Joe quit his job at La Salle, and the family moved out to California with him. During a Labor Day pickup game at Venice Beach, Kobe fractured his left wrist. Though the injury wasnt serious, it forced him to sit out five weeks and miss much of training camp. Going into the regular season, Harris and the Lakers decided to bring their 18-year-old rookie along slowly.\n\nSomewhat fittingly, Kobe made his official NBA debut against Kevin Garnett and the Timberwolves. In six minutes, he bricked his only shot and committed a turnover, but also hauled down a rebound and blocked a shot. Sparse playing time was the norm for Kobe through the first part of the 1996-97 campaign. With Los Angeles vying for the Pacific Division crown, there was no need to throw him into the fire.\n\nIn January, a thinning roster forced Harriss hand. At 18 years, five months, five days Kobe became the youngest starter in NBA history. Weeks later, during All-Star Weekend, he set a record with 31 points in the Rookie Game and won the Slam Dunk Contestthe first Laker ever to do so. Those were the highlights of the season for him. Injuries to ONeal and other key players decimated Los Angeles, and the club was steamrolled by the Jazz in the second round of the playoffs. Kobe, who saw only spot action in March and April, ended the year contributing just under eight points a night.\n\nPrior to the 1997-98 season, West and Harris agreed to install Kobe as the teams sixth man. He took to the role immediately. Playing between 20 and 30 minutes a game, he boosted his scoring average to nearly 18 points per game. Kobe was just the spark the Lakers needed, as they reeled off 11 straight victories to start the year. Even when ONeal went down with an injury, Los Angeles flourished. Van Exel, Jones and Campbell all were contributing, as were supporting players Robert Horry, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher.\n\nWith the Lakers battling the Sonics for first in the Pacific Division, fans voted Kobe into the starting lineup for the 1998 All-Star Game. The NBA, in turn, advertised the contest as a battle between Michael Jordan and the heir apparent to his throne. Kobe, the youngest All-Star in league history, didnt handle the situation well. He drew the ire of teammates by hogging the ball through the first three quarters and dissing teammate Karl Malone. West coach George Karl sat him for the final period.\n\nKobes All-Star performance highlighted a growing problem with his game. He wasnt sharing the ball. Even Jordan talked with the 19-year-old about this shortcoming. It got so bad that in March Harris scaled back Kobes minutes. Slowly the message sank in, and by playoff time he was working within the team structure and making meaningful contributions on the defensive end.\n\nLos Angeles opened the post-season with an impressive series win over the Trailblazers. Next up were the Sonics. After dropping Game 1, the Lakers took the next four in a row. Kobes role was limited thanks to a bout with the flu that caused him to miss two games. Though he returned to full health for the Western Conference Final against Utah, Los Angeles was completely outclassed by the more poised and experienced Jazz.\n\nThe NBA lockout turned the 1998 off-season into a frustrating waiting game. When the labor problems were finally settled, the resulting 50-game campaign put the championship up for grabs. Los Angeles responded with three major moves. The Lakers signed Dennis Rodman, replaced Harris with assistant coach Kurt Rambis, and in March dealt Jones and Campbell to Charlotte for Glen Rice, J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong.\n\nKobe, meanwhile, nailed down a spot in the starting lineup and responded well, earning Third Team All-NBA honors.He began to add depth to his game, leading the Lakers in steals and ranking second on the team in scoring with a 19.9 average. In all, he logged nine double-doubles, and proved increasingly dangerous in crunch time. Indeed, though his jumper lacked consistency, the Lakers were going to Kobe more and more in key situationsand he was delivering.\n\nAfter going 31-19 in the regular season, Los Angeles felt it was ready to go all the way. Rodman gave the club a veteran presence, and Rices outside game created more space on the floor for Kobe and Shaq inside. But all was not right in Lakerland. Rumors surfaced that ONeal was jealous of Kobe. In a team meeting, the club tried to smooth over the rift, but bad feelings lingered.\n\nThe off-court controversy didnt faze Los Angeles in the first round against the Houston Rockets, and the club advanced with a 3-1 series victory. Then the Lakers ran into the red-hot Spurs. After dropping the first contest, Los Angeles battled back and seemed in control of Game 2. But with 19 seconds left, Kobe missed a pair of foul shots that would have given the Lakers a three-point lead. The Spurs ended up winning by three, and seized the series momentum. When the series moved to L.A. the Lakers let Game 3 slip away late, and the next day succumbed to San Antonio in an embarrassing four-game sweep.\n\nA big change was clearly called for, and it came at the top. The Lakers new coach was PhilJackson. He brought Tex Winters and the Triangle Offense along with him. Jerry West knew he had to find a way to make Kobe and Shaq see eye to eye. Jacksons unorthodox approach had worked wonders with Jordan and Pippen in Chicago; now he would get to play Svengali to two new superstars."
