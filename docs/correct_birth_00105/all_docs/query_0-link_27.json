        "text": "Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father was a professional basketball player in the United States and in Italy, where Bryant attended school. When his family returned to the United States, Bryant played high-school basketball in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. He received several national Player of the Year awards. He also broke the southeastern Pennsylvania scoring record with 2,883 points. After he graduated from high school, Bryant decided to enter the NBA draft instead of going to college. He was chosen by the Charlotte Hornets as the 13th pick in the 1996 draft.\n\nShortly after Bryant was chosen by the Hornets, he was traded to the Lakers. He became the second youngest NBA player in history when the 1996–97 season began. In his second season he was selected for the NBA All-Star Game, becoming the youngest All-Star. By the time Bryant was 23, the Lakers had won three consecutive NBA championships.\n\nBryant continued to excel on the court during the years the Lakers did not win a championship. He led the league in scoring in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. In 2008 he was named the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the first time. Bryant won his fourth NBA championship in 2009 and was named the finals MVP. His fifth, and final, title came the following year when he was again named the finals MVP.\n\nDuring the next few seasons Bryant suffered a number of injuries, including a ruptured Achilles tendon, a fractured kneecap, and a torn rotator cuff. He retired following the last regular-season game of the 2015–16 season.\n\nIn 2015 Bryant wrote a poem called Dear Basketball. A short film based upon the poem was released two years later. He narrated the film, which won the Academy Award for best animated short film. Bryant also wrote The Mamba Mentality: How I Play (2018), a book in which he described his approach to basketball. The title reflected the nickname “The Black Mamba,” which he gave himself when he was playing. On January 26, 2020, Bryant was killed, along with his 13-year-old daughter, in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. The following year Bryant was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame."
