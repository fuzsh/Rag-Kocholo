        "text": "Transcript\n\nKobe Bryant was an American pro basketball player who helped lead the Los Angeles Lakers to five National Basketball Association championships. Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father was Joe (“Jelly Bean”) Bryant: a pro basketball player who spent eight years in the NBA before playing abroad in Italy, where Kobe spent his early school years. After excelling at basketball in high school—and even breaking the southeastern Pennsylvania scoring record set by Wilt Chamberlain—Bryant declared himself eligible for the NBA draft immediately following graduation.\n\nDrafted by the Charlotte Hornets and quickly traded to the Lakers, the opening of the 1996–97 season made him the second youngest NBA player in history. By the time Kobe Bryant was 23, the Lakers—led by Bryant and fellow star player Shaquille O’Neal—had won three consecutive NBA championships.\n\nWhen O’Neal was traded in 2004 after the Lakers lost the finals to the Detroit Pistons, Bryant emerged as his team’s sole leader.\n\nDespite injuries that occasionally kept him off the court, Bryant continued to prove his prowess as a star player— even playing as a member of the gold medal-winning U.S. men’s basketball teams at the k Kobe Bryant died on January 26, 2020, when a helicopter carrying Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and seven others crashed while traveling to a girls’ basketball game.\n\nBryant was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame later that year."
