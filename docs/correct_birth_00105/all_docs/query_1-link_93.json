        "text": "PHILADELPHIA >> Even before Kobe Bryant heard the entire question, his eyes lit up in earnestness.\n\nWhat significance does Bryant attach to playing tonight when the Lakers (2-14) visit the Philadelphia 76ers (0-18) on Wells Fargo Center, in what will mark his final NBA game in his hometown?\n\n“It means a lot,” Bryant told Los Angeles News Group. “Just going home and playing in front of Philadelphia fans and that relationship that we had and my entire career. I’m really appreciative of everything.”\n\nThat relationship does not fit the ones most athletes experience with their hometown, however.\n\nBryant has not received a warm reception from Sixers fans ever since the Lakers secured his rights with the 13th pick of the 1996 NBA Draft after trading Vlade Divac to Charlotte. He heard countless boos when the Lakers played the Sixers in the 2001 NBA Finals, partly fueled when Bryant said he wanted to “cut their hearts out.” The boos persisted when Bryant won the 2002 NBA All-Star MVP in Philadelphia.\n\nWill Bryant finally face a warm reception?\n\n“I don’t know,” Bryant said, laughing. “It’ll always be a mixture of both, I assume. But I love that city no matter what.”\n\nGregg Downer, Bryant’s high school coach at Lower Merion, is not as forgiving.\n\n“It got to the point where I stopped going,” Downer said. “I would go to some of the key games. But I just remember after two or three of them, (the backlash) was upsetting me. I though it was probably better that I watch it from home.”\n\nDowner will watch Bryant’s final game in Philadelphia in person. Lower Merion spokesman Doug Young also said about 400 members of the high school will attend, including former coaches, teammates and teachers. They have seats designated behind the basket parallel to the Lakers’ bench.\n\n“I have to imagine Philadelphia will embrace him,” Young said. “He will get his just due that he has always deserved. It’s going to be a pretty emotional moment for all of us.”\n\nYet, Bryant vowed he will not cry in Philadelphia or in other road games amid any positive receptions.\n\n“It’s not going to happen on the court,” he said, laughing, following the Lakers’ loss on Sunday to Indiana. “If I said I wasn’t getting a little emotional about it, I’d be lying. It’s a little different internally than when you actually voice it. Now it’s out there. There’s a certain level of finality to it that adds a little more.”\n\nWhat’s in a name\n\nIt turns out Bryant goes beyond going by his first name or “The Black Mamba.” Bryant called himself the NBA’s “triple OG,” standing for original gangster.\n\n“I feel like their grandfather,” Bryant said. “LeBron (James) and those other guys are the old guys now, and I’m way older than them. So they’re vets, and I’m like a triple vet.”\n\nHence, Bryant reported Detroit fielded three players in a captain’s meeting three weeks ago so an unnamed young player could shake his hand. Bryant also chastised an unnamed Portland player for telling him last weekend, “We’re going to beat you guys tonight.”\n\n“I said: ‘I got one rule. If you weren’t born when I started playing, you can’t talk trash. It’s a simple rule,’ Bryant said. “He looked at me and said, ‘Yes, sir.’ No argument.”\n\nBiggest accomplishment\n\nIt turns out Bryant’s most cherished memory had nothing to do with his five NBA championships.\n\n“Nothing beats getting drafted,” Bryant said. “Nothing tops that. That’s the beginning of it all.”"
