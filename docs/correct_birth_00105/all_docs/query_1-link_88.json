        "text": "I was born and raised in Los Angeles. For as long as I can remember, sports were an integral part of my family and upbringing. Whether I was playing baseball or basketball or watching my favorite teams (obviously, the Dodgers and Lakers), these games were a way of life. I was also born in 1978, the same year Kobe Bryant was born. And while we never met, like so many of us Angelinos, I felt like I knew him.\n\nFor those who don’t remember, Kobe was part of a group of mid-1990s all-stars who were drafted straight from high school, including Kevin Garnett, Tracy McGrady and Jermaine O’Neal. While I was learning to drive, these prep-to-pro players were navigating multimillion-dollar contracts and lacing up their sneakers to play at the highest competitive level of basketball in the world. Kobe was so young at the time of his drafting — the ripe old age of 17 — that his parents had to cosign his contract with the Lakers. I remember watching him and admiring how quickly he became one of the greatest players in the NBA.\n\nOver the next 15 years, Kobe and the Lakers did more than just play basketball. They built a dynasty that has been rivaled by few teams in the history of modern sports. The NBA playoffs and finals were a memorable time in my life that brought my friends and me — and perhaps the entire city of LA — together. And along the way, the world watched Kobe grow up. We all felt like we knew Kobe as we watched him grow into the family man he’ll always be remembered as.\n\nI’m not the only person who has eulogized Kobe since his untimely passing. But if there is one lesson I can take away from his death, this is it: The times I have been asked to work a little harder — put in the extra hours, travel a little more, make that extra sacrifice — the answer has been, and will continue to be, a resounding no.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. This isn’t because I don’t work hard or don’t consider the financial benefits of an 80-hour workweek for my family. It’s definitely not because I’m lazy, tired or burned out. It’s because I am a father, first and foremost. Instead, I’d rather be at my son’s basketball practices and coach his games. I’d rather take my daughter to soccer. I’d rather watch my oldest son folk dance and my younger son play the violin. I’d rather color and play video games with the kids. And I’d rather be at home with my family and kiss my wife. This is what matters most to me.\n\nIf you allow me to step on my proverbial soapbox, I believe we’ve grown used to excuses and compromises. We’re too busy and too tired to enjoy what’s considered an ordinary day. Rather than take the time to slow down and sit down with our families, we get stuck in a cycle of deadlines, meetings and long commutes. But that’s not what matters. You won’t remember the extra hours put in at your desk to perfect that pitch from last week, or that email you sent in a panic at 10 p.m.\n\nThe most tragic thing about Kobe’s death is the fact that he died doing what he loved the most: being with his daughter. Of course, he will be remembered as a great basketball player, teammate and entrepreneur. But his true legacy of being a father is what should always be remembered first. That’s what I’ll remember.\n\nI know now, more than ever, that my choices are a direct reflection of the person I want to be, regardless of how much pressure I may get from others who don’t value my family as much as I do. To all my friends and peers, I encourage you to do the same.\n\nSo, how do I maintain an equilibrium between work and family? It’s a balancing act, for sure. But with a little effort, it's entirely possible to raise a family and run a business in tandem.\n\nWhether it’s sibling, partner or parent, you’re most likely juggling roles across multiple relationships. That’s not to mention your business responsibilities. From manager to mentor, client to colleague, you probably wear many hats in your career as well. And what about goals? Maintaining a home, going to the gym, saving for retirement, getting that next promotion — we all have countless ambitions that seemingly compete for first place on our to-do list.\n\nThere are only 24 hours in a day. It’s important to breathe and remember to let your values take precedent. I believe that balancing business and family all boils down to planning and setting priorities. It’s wise to let your principles guide your life. What matters most to you at this exact moment? What about in the next three months? Make your decisions with these priorities in mind, and I can almost guarantee you'll be happier.\n\nAs a parent, I make it a point to set aside time each day to be with my kids and my wife. It’s the memories that matter. From eating dinner together (when we don’t have practice) to watching movies on the weekends, we make it a point to set aside time for each other. I also try to limit my after-work activities and set aside enough time for what I call unexpected family moments.\n\nI will not put the unnecessary first. My family will always come first."
