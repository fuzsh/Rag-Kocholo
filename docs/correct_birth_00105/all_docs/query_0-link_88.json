        "text": "First, a list of his accomplishments. Kobe was drafted out of highschool at the age of seventeen, broke into the league by winning the Slam Dunk contest in his rookie season, and by age of twenty-five he was a three time world champion. He was the youngest person to be named a NBA All-Star at the age of nineteen. The combination of his talents with the talents of Shaquille O’Neal was the greatest “one-two punch” of all time. That is an objective fact. Shaq himself has even admitted that had the duo stayed together after the 2004 season, they most certainly would have gone on to win additional world championships, but Kobe didn’t need Shaq. When it was all said and done, Kobe ended up with five rings to his name to O’Neals four - all five with the Lakers I might add.\n\nBryant’s accomplishments, competitiveness, and work ethic is very inspiring to the fans of sport. Playing for one of the biggest franchise team for 20 years and winning five championship is something no other player has done except Kobe Bryant. Bryant has also maintained his high level performance in the most competitive league by spending time on his craft for many hours and extending his time on recovery by icing and playing less minutes during each game. One of the most inspiring moment in Bryant’s career is him coming back from torn achilles during the game against the Golden State Warriors in 2013. Bryant tore the tendon as he fell from getting a shooting foul, he stayed on the court and made his two free throws which led to a remarkable win. His eager to win a game is ambitious than any players. At the age of 34, it is very difficult for top athletes to come back from serious injury but Bryant never gave up so he embraced his injury to put himself through a very intense rehabilitation to bounce back from his step back. In the article “Kobe Bryant: I inspire myself by inspiring others” Kobe Bryant stated “ when people say you can’t come back from that…. I’ve had those doubts about myself but i’m not gonna cower to those doubts. I’m not going to be scared” This quote demonstrates how inspiring Kobe is because his willingness to fight back his serious injuries and embracing the fear that is created by others and\n\nAbdullah Alqatami Miss Perger English 11 6 March 2015 The successful American Dream Kobe Bryant and Lance Armstrong have both been proven best at what they do for a living. Kobe Bryant will always be thought of as one of the biggest mistakes for the Los Angeles Lakers, but over his life time he is proven best at achieving his goals and begging successful. Kobe Bryant's personality and hatred was earned and not given. He is one of the most hard working basketball players on this earth.\n\nAlthough it is true that Kobe Bryant was charged with sexual assault, companies are willing to endorse him because he was proven not guilty by law. Does this make Kobe Bryant a risky partner to be an endorser for a company? I would say so, but than again, anyone would be a risk. I think the reason why people are still willing to endorse Kobe Bryant is because they are willing to take that risk. The reason why many companies are willing to take that risk is because Kobe's fame and success only continues to grow. I don't mean to say that he has found success because of his past sexual assault charge, but his success in the NBA has only continue to improve even after the ordeal. Kobe Bryant is considered to be one of the best to ever play\n\nOne of the things that inspired him was how much he loved the sport. Kobe Bryant said, \"It's the enjoyment of the game and the love of it. Then it's the low hanging fruit of responding to this challenge. I mean it's right there, it's very easy to get me going\" (\"Kobe Bryant Best Motivational Speech\"). Another factor of what inspired him was his willingness to become the greatest which encouraged him to do better each time. \"That's how I would think everyone would go into it. You want to be the man, you know, not the best of the moment, but the best who ever set foot on a basketball court,\" said Kobe Bryant (Biography Today 54). Kobe brought out the best in people and he wanted to have a positive affect to the people around him and supported him in his life. His goal was to be one of the greatest, but he also wanted to influence people. One of the motivational things that he said was, \" We realize the most important thing in life is how your career moves and touches those around you and how it carries forward to the next generation. You realize that's what makes true greatness\" (\"Kobe Bryant Interview\"). These are the things that kept him from giving up through the obstacles that he"
