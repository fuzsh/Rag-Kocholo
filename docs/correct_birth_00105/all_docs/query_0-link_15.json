        "text": "The late Kobe Bryant's childhood home outside of Philadelphia is for sale, and the original basketball hoop where he honed his Hall of Fame shot is still hanging. Bryant spent his teenage years at 1224 Remington Road in the heart of Wynnewood, where he attended Lower Merion High School from 1992-1996. Not surprisingly, he led the school's basketball team to a state championship.\n\nThe 3,434-square-foot colonial-style home is located in the heart of Wynnewood, which offers an easy commute into Philadelphia. It has 5 bedrooms with 3.5 bathrooms and a spacious bonus room. The kitchen features custom maple cabinets and granite countertops, where meals can be prepared for service in a formal dining room. Sliding glass doors open up to a back patio, which overlooks an AstroTurf yard.\n\nThe asking price for Bryant's former home is $899,900, and the listing is held with TJ Sosko of Compass Realty. It is only the first time the home has hit the market since Bryant's own parents sold it back in 2008, according to the real estate company. Kate Bayer, the current owner, told House Beautiful that she was honored to have called Bryant's childhood house her home.\n\n\"When Kobe got into his limo on the way to his high school prom, people lined up on the street,\" Bayer said. \"Even back then, he was a celebrity.\"\n\nBryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, Calif., in January. He was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in April."
