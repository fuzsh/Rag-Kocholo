        "text": "People who play for their city usually become heroes in the eyes of the fans. They are a representation of the expectations, desires, and hopeful future of a whole community. One of those hometown heroes is Kobe Bryant, a legend of Philadelphia, who had not expected a cool reception in the 2002 All-Star game despite being very competitive, and Charles Barkley came to the rescue.\n\nKobe Bryant and the Unintended Backlash\n\nIt was the year 2002 and in Philadelphia, Kobe Bryant’s hometown, the All-Star game of the NBA was being held. There was palpable excitement, especially among fans in the city of brotherly love awaiting the return of their “prodigal son”. Nevertheless, as Kobe stepped into the arena, he faced a sudden chanting of boos and jeers. Unsettling indeed – the hometown hero scathingly attacked by his own supporters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nTo understand why, one has to revisit the 2001 NBA finals. Kobe then playing for the Los Angeles Lakers made a statement that fueled the controversy. In the face of the 76ers, he dared to say that he intended to “cut Philly’s heart out”. Charles Barkley, in his book “I may be wrong but I doubt it”, states that Kobe was referring to the 76ers, and the entire city of Philadelphia. It is worth saying that it was more of a competitive drive than a normal statement for the top league players.\n\nRead More: Denying His Idol for a Face Off, Kobe Bryant Contrasted His Competitive Mindset Only To Evade Michael Jordan’s Advantage\n\nIt is during these competitive moments that the players’ psychological tricks are commonly used, and in this case, Bryant’s phrasing was no exception. There is no reason fans should not see that the context was from a place where Kobe’s loyalty was towards the Lakers, rather than an attack on his hometown. Instead of misinterpreting them, Philly’s sports fans should have praised his determination for the victory.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nKobe’s Competitive Flame Illuminates the Heart of Philadelphia Sports\n\nIn this regard, another Philadelphia legend Charles Barkley also iterates that such a reaction was unfair. He recalls that during his time as an NBA player, he too was driven in his own way by the same competitive fire. In 1993, he says he had the desire to “cut the Bulls’ heart out” despite having a lot of love for the city of Chicago. Just as Barkley loved his hometown, he was just as passionate a player as Kobe.\n\nBarkley’s sentiment is clear: demanding competitiveness of a player in the NBA finals is just an understatement because the sport should not be taken for granted. It is unfair to even boo a superstar like Kobe, not because he has always embarrassed his family, his name, or his city. Bryant was born in Philadelphia and he put an iconic stamp on the city when he represented his hometown on the world scale.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWATCH THIS STORY | Shaquille O’Neal’s 20YO Son Joins Vanessa’s Plea In Saving Kobe Bryant And Gigi Tribute Amid Shocking Update\n\nFinally, the 76ers fans could have misconstrued Kobe’s spirit to compete as aggression. In a nutshell, Charles Barkley’s view helps us understand the backdrop of the issue and the reason why hometown heroes like Kobe should be appreciated for fighting for pride in the game, rather than against the city that molded them. It goes to show the delicate details behind sportsmanship despite the intense rivalry."
