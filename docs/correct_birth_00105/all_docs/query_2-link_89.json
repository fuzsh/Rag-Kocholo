        "text": "Kobe Bryant was born on August 23, 1978. In other words; A legend was born on August 23, 1978. He was born in Philadelphia, and he was the youngest of 3 siblings. He was also named after a beef. Yes. A beef. He was actually the son of an NBA player, Joe Bryant. His uncle was also an NBA player, so this means that basketball was in the family growing up.\n\nKobe started playing basketball at the age of three. Three. Some toddlers can’t even talk at that age. Let alone understand the rules of basketball. He grew up watching the Lakers, and the Lakers were his favorite team. Quite a bit of foreshadowing. It feels bittersweet knowing he cared about them from the start.\n\nHowever; his favorite player wasn’t on the Los Angeles Lakers. His favorite player was nowhere to be found in Los Angeles. His idol was somewhere in Illinois. Somewhere in Chicago.\n\nLike many others, Kobe grew up idolizing Michael Jordan. Looking at it now, you could see the influence Jordan had on him. They were both great scorers. Both were good in the midrange. Both were great players, actually; the greatest players of all time.\n\nJoe Bryant was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers, which is why Kobe was born in Philadelphia. Kobe was born in ’78, and Joe was on the 76ers from ’75 to ’79.\n\nJoe Bryant would eventually end up in Los Angeles.\n\nJust not the Lakers.\n\nHe was now on the Los Angeles Clippers. Actually, saying he ended up in Los Angeles is slightly a lie, since they were in San Diego back then; but it’s poetic (I’m sorry). He stayed in San Diego until 1982, and he was then with the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe 1982–1983 season was the final season of Joe Bryant’s NBA career, and he retired. More specifically, he retired from the NBA.\n\nMove to Italy.\n\nThe Bryant family moved to Italy and Joe Bryant started playing pro basketball in Italy. Kobe reportedly spoke fluent Italian growing up. Here in Italy, Kobe started to play basketball more and more; and he started to take the game seriously. His grandfather would actually mail him footage of NBA games so that he could study them. In 1987, Joe played at Olimpia Basket Pistoia.\n\nKobe spent years in Italy; learning the language, playing at their courts; and joining youth leagues. He returned to America in the summers to play in youth basketball leagues. But by the time Kobe turned 13, a teenager, he moved full-time back to Philadelphia. When he returned, he enrolled into Bala Cynwyd Middle School in the 8th Grade.\n\nAfter Middle School, it would be natural that I would move on to his high school career. But; I think that probably deserves it’s own part in this series.\n\nBefore I finish; I just want to speak of a story about Kobe from when he was a kid. Specifically 10 or 11 years old. He told this story himself on a podcast.\n\nHe said, that one summer when he was a kid; he played. But he couldn’t score one point. The entire summer. The man who was interviewing him asked if he was even in the game, and Kobe replied saying that he was. He said that he was just terrible at basketball.\n\nSo, at the end of the summer, he cried and was obviously upset about it. But; his father came to him and hugged him and told him; “Whether you score 0 or score 60, I’m gonna love you no matter what”.\n\nHe said that after that, he had all the confidence in the world to fail. He was secure enough. But; in his own words :\n\n“To hell with that, I’m scoring 60.” — Kobe Bryant\n\nI would argue that this moment was one of the most important moments in his whole career. This moment lit the flame. From then on, he started to mold into the Kobe that we know now. He just kept on practicing, and practicing, and practicing, and practicing.\n\nThe work ethic was here. The Mamba Mentality had arrived.\n\nHe realized that he would need some long-term thinking. He wasn’t going to beat these kids in a year, or even 3 years.\n\nAll he had to do was work on the basics, the fundamentals. He created a whole menu of things he wanted to work on. “What to work on first?” was the question.\n\nIf he chose to work on shooting. He would spend the summer doing nothing but shoot.\n\nDribbling. Spend the summer doing ball handling drills. Mastering basic crossovers, behind the backs, and between the legs.\n\nAnything he wanted to do; he would work on it.\n\nBy the time 13 rolled around and his body started to get stronger, he was just dominating everyone. All the other kids relied on their athleticism and height, but Kobe worked on his fundamentals and actual skill. He never really had any built in advantages.\n\nOnce his body caught up to them; it was over for them.\n\nWhen Kobe was growing up, he would watch those NBA tapes that his grandfather would send him. He would see Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, maybe even Kareem. He would see those and think if he could get to that level. Eventually he decided how he wanted to answer that question.\n\n“Let’s find out.”\n\nTo be continued, in Part 2."
