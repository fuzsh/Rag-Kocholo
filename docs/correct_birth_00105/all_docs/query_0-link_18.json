        "text": "It’s hard to believe it’s been more than three years since one of the most talented athletes every to grace the hardwood died in a tragic helicopter accident. Only a few years post-retirement, Bryant was only beginning a new chapter in life as a coach for his daughters, a mentor to younger players and as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist.\n\nUnfortunately, we never got to see the next chapter of that evolution, but on what would have been his 45th birthday, we can look back at the man we called “Mamba” and imagine what might have been.\n\nHere is the evolution of Kobe Bryant.\n\nAlthough he was recruited by Duke, North Carolina and Michigan, at 17 years old Kobe opted to declare for the 1996 NBA Draft. He was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick and traded that same night to the Los Angeles Lakers, his favorite team when he was a child.\n\nAs a rookie, Kobe struggled during the times he did an opportunity to play in Laker games. He averaged 7.6 points, 1.9. rebounds and 1.3 assists and 41 percent shooting from the field. He had an infamous in game 5 of the 1997 Western Conference Semifinals against the Utah Jazz where he airballed four shots in the span of five minutes.\n\nMichael Jordan is gone. The NBA landscape is wide open. Kobe along with Shaquille O’Neal and head coach Phil Jackson won their first of many NBA championships against the Indiana Pacers in six games. Kobe in particular had a standout performance in game 4 when Shaq fouled out.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Kobe was arrested in Colorado in connection with a sexual assault complaint filed by a hotel employee who was 19. She accused Kobe of rape but he claimed the encounter was consensual. The case went to trial but was eventually dropped in September 2004. Kobe’s reputation was tarnished as a result of the trial and he lost many of his endorsements, including his sneaker deal with Adidas.\n\nKobe and Shaq had a well-documented feud with each other over whose team it was. Kobe also was not happy that Shaq did not take care of his body the way Kobe did with his. After the 2004 NBA Finals, in which they were demolished by the Detroit Pistons, Shaq was traded to the Miami Heat.\n\nDuring the 2007-2008 NBA season, Kobe won regular season MVP and made it back to the NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. Unfortunately, the Lakers lost in six games and it served as motivation for him for the next few seasons.\n\nThe Lakers got right back to their winning ways in 2009 and 2010, championing the Finals in both years and Kobe taking home the Finals MVP in back-to-back years proving he could truly win without Shaq’s help.\n\nWhile Kobe still had some prime years after the 2010 NBA Finals, injuries started to catch up with the NBA veteran. At the age of 34, he suffered a torn achilles tendon, which is like a death sentence for a basketball player’s career. While he eventually returned to the court, he was never the same player he once was.\n\nDuring the 2015-2016 NBA season, Kobe announced that it would be his final year in the NBA. Fans in every NBA arena greeted him with open arms and were enamored to see the NBA legend one final time. In his final game as a Laker, Kobe scored 60 points."
