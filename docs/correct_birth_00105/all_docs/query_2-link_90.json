        "text": "There’s a joke some around the Kings have whenever they play the Lakers: they make sure I’m not wearing a Kobe jersey underneath my shirt.\n\nUs L.A. folks love Kobe Bryant. That’s no secret. So being a Los Angeles-born writer being asked to cover the Sacramento Kings — funny right?\n\nYou can’t tell Kobe Bryant’s NBA story without Sacramento, especially from 2000-02 through three playoff series, culminating in the 2002 Western Conference Finals which played as the de facto NBA Finals.\n\nBryant died along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others in a helicopter crash Sunday morning. Bryant was 41.\n\nThis hits hard. In so many ways, this isn’t just a sports story for me. It’s personal.\n\nI’m 41. He was a father of four; I am a father of three. I was born in L.A., Kobe came to represent L.A. We essentially grew up together.\n\nI first encountered Kobe in the summer of 1996 at summer league at Long Beach State. We were both 17. He was going to be a Laker, and I was going to be a freshman in college and I wondered how Jerry West was going to justify trading Vlade Divac for this kid my age.\n\nBut boy did he, and little did I know my career and his would end up intertwined by one city.\n\nI started working at the Sacramento Bee in June 2002, about a week after the Lakers had won their third consecutive NBA Championship. I was warned the city was still hot over the Western Conference Finals and what Shaq and Kobe had taken from the city. But I didn’t care. Plus, I had no plans to ever cover the NBA. Ever. I wasn’t going to let anything interfere with my unadulterated love for the Lakers.\n\nBut by 2009 life changed and I was covering the NBA after being taken off the NFL beat. So I had to step back and observe this Kings-Lakers rivalry from a work perspective.\n\nAnd no, there was never a Kobe jersey with me at work.\n\nBut the experience gave me a new insight on how Sacramento saw Bryant, its ultra-competitive nemesis, and how Bryant saw Sacramento.\n\nYes, Kings fans reveled in booing everything Bryant did and the thousands of Laker fans that filled seats when the Lakers were in town. But it was also evident Sacramento was special to Bryant and he wanted to put on a show whenever he was in the state capitol.\n\nHe dazzled on the court in his many appearances against the Kings, averaging 26.7 points in 63 career games. It seemed Bryant took a special joy in torturing the Kings, but in the end there was a level of love and respect that could not be ignored.\n\nThat’s because Bryant loved basketball and loved those who loved the game. Kings fans love the game, and Bryant appreciated that.\n\n“We will forever remember the mutual respect shared between Kobe and Sacramento,” said Kings chairman Vivek Ranadive in a statement. “On behalf of the entire Kings organization, we extend our deepest condolences to his wife Vanessa, their family and all those impacted as we hold them in our hearts and prayers at this most difficult time.”\n\nBryant was a Laker, a central player in denying the Kings a championship. That was reason to hate him in Sacramento.\n\nBut in his final appearance in Sacramento, there was an outpouring of love for Bryant. The constant grind of 20 NBA seasons had taken a toll on the Lakers legend, making it difficult to practice and missing games a necessity, but there was no way he’d miss his last game in Sacramento.\n\nHe sat out the Lakers’ previous three games to make sure he’d be available Jan. 7, 2016.\n\n“I looked at the schedule and I knew my shoulder was bothering me,” Bryant said at the time. “I wanted to make sure I rested it enough to be able to play one last time here.”\n\nSacramento sent Bryant off with a rousing ovation that night, a final show of respect to a player who routinely tortured the city for two decades. Bryant scored 28 points in through three quarters that night, giving Sacramento a vintage performance and a reminder of why he was still the Laker the city loved to hate.\n\nAnd you can’t be around the Kings for too long and not notice Bryant has a tie to or left a mark on the city in some way.\n\nDivac, the Kings’ general manager, was traded to Charlotte for Bryant’s draft rights in 1996 and would later become his teammate.\n\nHead coach Luke Walton was Bryant’s teammate for championships in 2009 and 2010. Former King Doug Christie often had to guard Bryant during those heated playoff battles and now serves as Sacramento’s television color analyst. King’s assistant general manager Peja Stojakovic and assistant coach Bobby Jackson also played against Bryant. Bryant’s former teammate, Shaquille O’Neal, is a minority investor with the Kings.\n\n“My heart goes out to the Bryant family,” Jackson wrote on Instagram. “It was an honor to compete against you #mambamentality.”\n\nOne of Bryant’s proudest accomplishments on the court was overcoming the Kings in 2002. It was the only time the Lakers did not have homecourt advantage en route to a title. Bryant famously was ill with food poisoning during Game 2 during the conference finals after eating a cheeseburger and cheesecake in his hotel room.\n\nThe Lakers won Game 7 in Sacramento to advance to the Finals after being down 3-2 in the series and winning a controversially officiated Game 6 in Los Angeles that still irks Kings fans.\n\nSo there was no way Bryant was going to miss his last chance to play in Sacramento, because the city meant so much to his NBA legacy.\n\n“I don’t think anything will ever top Game 7 (of the 2002 Western Conference Finals),” Bryant said after his last game in Sacramento. “Not the end of Game 7, but the beginning of Game 7, the start. The announcing of the starting five, the lights going out, all those cool lights that they gave everybody and they’re waving them all around. You just feel the electricity in the building. That’s the best part.”\n\nThat electricity was always in the building when Kobe was in town.\n\nRead more Kobe Bryant coverage on this topic page\n\n(Photo: John G. Mabanglo / AFP via Getty Images)"
