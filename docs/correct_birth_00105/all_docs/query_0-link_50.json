        "text": "Kobe Bryant was about to enter his senior season at Lower Merion High School, what would be his last as an amateur, but he was already a regular participant in informal workouts with the Philadelphia 76ers. John Lucas, then the 76ers’ coach and general manager, had extended the opportunity to Bryant to train before and after practices, after seeing him dominate his preps peers — and all but one prospect in individual workouts leading up to the 1995 NBA draft. But on one afternoon, Lucas was concerned for Bryant’s well-being.\n\nBryant’s informal workouts would often find him paired up individually against 76ers players. This time, the opponent was Vernon Maxwell, a hot-tempered, nearly 30-year-old, seven-year veteran who was once famously ejected for getting overly physical with Michael Jordan. Playing to 10, Bryant and Maxwell were tied at 9-9 when Lucas and his staff had to call it a draw.\n\n“I thought they were about to fight,” Lucas, the current player development coach of the Houston Rockets, recalled in a telephone interview. “One of my coaches was like, ‘Jesus Christ, Luc, this boy gon’ be something. He ain’t scared.’ I said, ‘I already know.’ And at that time Vernon was ‘Mad Max.’ But I said, ‘Kobe are you nuts?’”\n\nNo, he was just Philly.\n\nBryant’s relationship with his hometown was always complex and multi-layered. On the surface, the city and the surrounding region should have embraced the son of a homegrown former La Salle star and Philadelphia 76er who would go on to become one of the all-time greats. But for much of his career — and especially after he helped the Los Angeles Lakers thump the 76ers and their beloved Allen Iverson in the 2001 NBA Finals — an underlying struggle for Bryant was that while most places hailed him, the place he credited for his mental toughness and edge would leave him hanging whenever he wanted some dap.\n\nIn high school, Bryant was viewed as the pampered kid who spent part of his youth in Italy and committed the cardinal sin of living on the wrong side of City Line Avenue, the street that divides West Philadelphia from one of the most affluent suburbs in the nation. Even if his game, his swagger and his attitude screamed so much of the gritty, overachieving personality of the place of his birth, Bryant was dismissed by those who resented that he existed in an otherwise world of privilege.\n\nBryant declared for the draft with those sunglasses on his head, took Brandy to the prom, and played for the Lakers, of all teams. He was Hollywood. At least that was the perception.\n\nHere’s the reality: The Mamba Mentality is a Philadelphia mentality.\n\nWhat he learned there, the work ethic he inherited from his parents, and the narrow-minded focus that produced such a driven, ruthless competitor, made Bryant a revered figure. It also made his untimely death in a tragic helicopter crash on Jan. 26 in Calabasas, Calif., that took the lives of nine people, including his daughter, Gianna, so difficult for many to accept. Bryant is gone, but his legacy lives on in the people he’s inspired and entertained in Los Angeles and across the globe.\n\nAnd it’s time — past time even — for the hometown that wasn’t always eager to embrace Bryant to give him one of those eternal hugs. The Lakers got the benefits of those five championships, two Finals MVPs, one regular-season MVP, 18 All-Star appearances, 33,643 points and countless other chest-pounding memories. But without Philadelphia, Bryant doesn’t become the biggest star in a town glistening with them.\n\n“He was really Philly,” Hill said of Bryant. “Wilt Chamberlain once told me, ‘If I didn’t grow up in Philadelphia, I’d never be the player that I am today.’ Did Kobe feel the same way? I don’t know. But that’s what Wilt told me.”\n\nBryant never hid his affinity for Philadelphia, even if it wasn’t always requited. In one of his last public appearances with Gianna, Bryant rocked an Eagles knit hat and he famously wept tears of joy following their Super Bowl victory two years ago. It was unlikely a coincidence that Bryant announced that the 2015-16 season would be his last before playing his final game at Wells Fargo Center. That day in December 2015, Bryant declared, “I brought my Philly attitude back as a Laker. Philly was like, ‘No, don’t do that.’ So it was like two rams, which was marvelous.”\n\nAnd that got him in some trouble when the Lakers smoked the 76ers in five games in 2001. Bryant took down the one Philadelphia had grown to love, the undersized yet relentless Allen Iverson. Eight months later, Bryant spent All-Star weekend in Philadelphia waiting to celebrate what should’ve been the glorious homecoming for a champion who beat the odds coming directly out of high school. Bryant proudly wore his father’s throwback No. 23 76ers jersey during media availability and claimed All-Star Game MVP honors for the first of four times in his career after scoring 31 points. That would be the only instance in which Bryant was booed in that event, on that stage.\n\n“He was a single-minded, driven individual. He wanted to play for the Lakers, he became successful for the Lakers. He showed where his loyalty was, playing ball, was with the Lakers,” Hill said. “The fans here took it as, ‘He’s dissing Philadelphia.’ Well, he’s not dissing Philadelphia. He’s loyal and driven to what it is that he wants to do. And he may have made some statements that made people feel uncomfortable.”\n\nHill isn’t surprised that Bryant is more adored in Los Angeles because he gave that city all 20 seasons of his Hall of Fame career. Bryant left Philadelphia for good at 17. Will Smith left Philadelphia, moved to Hollywood, became the biggest movie star in the business and has a huge mural and other acknowledgments throughout the place where he was “born and raised.” Bryant dribbled his way toward a similar path that resulted in icon status but often got pushback when he came home to play.\n\nLocal high school talents rarely maintain that connection without ever playing for their hometown teams. James Harden was once booed at a Dodgers game. Stephen Curry is adored in Charlotte but his father played for the Hornets and continues to work for the organization. He also played collegiately at Davidson and never stood in the way of the Hornets’ success.\n\n“I don’t know why that’s abnormal for people. Most people adopt someone who didn’t grow up there,” Lucas said. “Iverson didn’t grow up in Philly.”\n\nHill explained the disconnect between Bryant and Philadelphia succinctly: “He didn’t play for the 76ers.”\n\nLucas knows, if given the chance, he could’ve delivered Bryant for the 76ers. In the first season of his short two-year stint with the 76ers, Lucas got wind of a special talent who went to school with his daughter, Tarvia. “My wife (Debbie) told me she had seen a better high school basketball player than I was. And I told her, ‘You must be crazy.’ And she said, ‘Yeah, I am,’” Lucas recalled with a laugh.\n\nThe 1994-95 76ers weren’t very good and Lucas decided to watch Lower Merion take on Chester in the PIAA District One championship game at Villanova. Upon entering the gym, Lucas was stunned to see Joe Bryant, one of his former NBA opponents. “I said, ‘What are you doing here?’ He said, ‘I’m here to see my son.’ He said, ‘What are you doing here?’ I said, “I’m here to see some kid named Kobe.’ He said, ‘That’s my son,’” Lucas said with a chuckle.\n\nLower Merion was blown out but Lucas was blown away by Bryant’s versatility, fearlessness and cockiness. Bryant seamlessly switched between playing center and point guard to handle Chester’s tenacious full-court pressure. Afterward, Lucas invited Bryant to work out with the 76ers.\n\n“Don’t you know when you see a rare bird?” Lucas said. “At that time, there were two people I let come in the gym, Kobe Bryant and Dawn Staley. That year, Dawn was thinking about retiring because of her knees and Kobe worked out every day with our guys. Our workouts were at 6 in the morning — we’d start out at (St. Joseph’s University) track — and I never beat him there.”\n\nNBA rules prohibiting contact with amateurs weren’t in place at the time (they were when Lucas tried to do the same with the LeBron James, a few years later while in Cleveland, and received a two-game suspension), so Bryant was able to show up and leave an impression on Lucas, with whom his family had grown close. Lucas determined that he would use Bryant to help make his 1995 draft selection. Bryant went one-on-one against every prospective draftee the 76ers brought in to try out for the No. 3 pick. Lucas claims he emerged victorious in all but one instance: against Antonio McDyess, a power forward who went second overall in that draft.\n\nOne player, humbled by defeat, asked Lucas if the youngster who had just given him the business played for the 76ers. “No,” Lucas told him, “he’s a junior in high school.”\n\nKevin Garnett re-opened the doors for players to enter the NBA straight out of high school that June, when the Minnesota Timberwolves took him fifth. Lucas knew Bryant would be next in line. When college coaches such as Rick Pitino would ask, Lucas said he’d tell them, “Don’t waste your time.”\n\nLucas would leave tickets for Bryant to attend 76ers games but had to make a special arrangement when the Chicago Bulls came to town. Bryant was obsessed with Michael Jordan and desperately wanted to meet him, so Lucas cleared the Flyers’ locker room for the two to have a conversation. Jordan walked in, dressed exquisitely in a suit, and Bryant followed behind, nervously. “Kobe went in there and said, “Hello Mr. Jordan,” Lucas said. “Michael talked to him about Carolina and some other stuff. And I said, ‘If you’re going to go the pros next year, you can’t be calling him, ‘Mr. Jordan.’ And he laughed and from that point on, he kept going.”\n\nAs Bryant would go on to dominate the state as a senior, win Pennsylvania player of year honors, break Chamberlain’s all-time scoring record and lead Lower Merion to the title, Lucas noticed the resentment he encountered. They assumed he was soft, pompous. “They had great hate for Kobe.” Lucas said. “It was because he was Lower Merion. A suburban kid and the whole works. I used to tell him all the time, ‘Don’t pay no attention to that. Just go play. Fake bullies.’”\n\nHad the opportunity arrived, Lucas would’ve made the stunning decision to take Bryant instead of Iverson. But Lucas wasn’t around to make the first pick of the 1996 draft because Howard Katz sold the team that April and Pat Croce hired a new general manager and coach. The 76ers brought Bryant in for a workout, which was deemed odd by some for a player expected to go in the middle of the first round. Iverson wasn’t a bad choice because he produced a Hall of Fame career, winning an MVP award and multiple scoring titles. But Bryant surpassed him and kept winning rings, which contributed to some of the indignation from Philadelphia fans.\n\n“The city had fallen in love with Allen Iverson,” Lucas said. “I’ve always described Kobe as the Rolls Royce or the Bentley, even back in high school. Not the G wagons or the trucks. He was more R&B music. At the time rap was the thing. To me, Kobe was always an old spirit.”\n\nBryant’s spirit will continue to live on among admirers who refuse to let go. Philadelphia fans gave him the love he long sought in his final appearance, giving him an extended ovation and serenading him with chants of “Kobe! Kobe!” Bryant tapped his chest and waved, noticeably moved. “They got me,” he said. “I wasn’t expecting that kind of reaction. You can’t script that stuff. The amount of adoration I have for this city means everything to me.”\n\nThe 76ers honored Bryant in the first home game after his death with a 33-second moment of silence in honor of his high school jersey number and placed a No. 33 logo on the sideline. Rotating billboards with the word, “Legend,” in the Lakers streaking font, could be spotted by anyone driving up I-76 that night. An opportunity was lost during Bryant’s career but the recognition shouldn’t stop there. Los Angeles shouldn’t be the only place that puts up murals in his honor.\n\nPhiladelphia is one of the basketball meccas, producing Hall of Fame legends such as Chamberlain, Bryant, Earl Monroe and Paul Arizin. Hill won’t bother getting into rankings or debates about who was the best to come from the area, but instead makes his answer in a series of questions.\n\n“Kobe scored 81. Who scored more than him? Wilt. He had 100,” Hill said. ”Where are they from?”\n\nPhiladelphia.\n\n“There you go,” Hill said.\n\n(Top Photo: David Dow/NBAE via Getty Images)"
