He was the son of professional basketball player Joseph \"Jellybean\" Bryant and his wife, Pamela Cox, sister of pro basketballer \"Chubby\" Cox.[1]\n\nKobe started playing basketball at the age of three. When he was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Italy to continue playing professional basketball at a lower level. His father had previously played for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and the Houston Rockets.[3] At an early age, Kobe also learned to play soccer, and became fluent in Italian and Spanish.[1] The Los Angeles Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up. His grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games to study. At age thirteen he attended Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA suburb, where he was recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the country. Upon graduation, he declared for the 1996 National Basketball Association (NBA) draft; he was named an All-Star by his second season.[1]\n\nCareer\n\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, some of his accomplishments included:\n\n- led Lakers to 3 consecutive NBA championships (2000-2002)\n\n- won 5 NBA championships\n\n- 18-time All-Star\n\n- 15-time member of the All-NBA Team\n\n- 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team\n\n- led NBA in scoring during 2 seasons (2005/06 & 2006/07)\n\n- ranked 4th on the league's all-time regular season scoring\n\n- ranked fourth on the all-time postseason scoring list\n\n- 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP)\n\n- 4 All-Star MVP Awards\n\n- led team to 2 consecutive championships (2009 & 2010)\n\n- won 2 gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team (2008 & 2012 Summer Olympics)\n\nIn 2006 he scored a career-high 81 points against the Toronto Raptors, the second most points scored in a single game in league history, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962.[1]\n\nHe was a member of United States men's Olympic basketball team in 2008 and 2012, winning gold each time.[4]\n\nHe continued to be among the top players in the NBA through 2013, when he suffered a number of injuries. Citing his physical decline, he retired after the 2015/16 season. He was the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons, which he did with the Los Angeles Lakers.[1]\n\nIn 2018 Kobe won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for the film Dear Basketball, which he wrote and narrated.[1] He is also the founder of Granity Studios, a sports-focused production company.[5]\n\nMarriage\n\nKobe and his wife met in November 2000; they married on 18 April 2001 in a Catholic church in Dana Point, California.[6][1] Together they had four daughters. Their daughter Gianna Maria-Onore died on 26 January 2020, at age thirteen.\n\nControversy\n\nIn 2003 Kobe was in the headlines for the alleged rape of a 19-year-old Colorado hotel employee.[6][1] He was charged with one count of felony sexual assault, but the criminal case was dropped after the young woman refused to testify. However, she filed a civil suit on 10 Aug 2004 seeking damages for pain and suffering, and the case was settled out of court, with each side stating that the matter was \"resolved to the satisfaction of both parties.\" [6]\n\nRelatives\n\nKobe had two sisters and was the only son of his parents.[7][8] His maternal great-grandparents were John Arthur Cox and Dorothy Roxana Ridley.[7] Kobe's maternal uncle, \"Chubby\" Cox[3] and cousin, John Cox, were also notable professional basketball players.\n\nDeath\n\nKobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, were on the way to her basketball tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy, when they died in a helicopter crash on 26 January 2020 in Calabasas, Los Angeles County, California, USA,[9][10][11][12]\n\nAmong the deceased were their friends, John Altobelli, his wife Keri and their daughter Alyssa;[13] Sarah and Payton Chester; [13] Christina Mauser, and pilot Ara Zobayan.[14]\n\nKobe was survived by his wife, three daughters, his parents, and two sisters.\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 Wikipedia contributors, \"Kobe Bryant,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kobe_Bryant&oldid=1158926084 (accessed June 10, 2023).\n\n↑ \"United States Public Records 1970-2009\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:29KF-RQ7 : 23 May 2014) a third party aggregator of publicly available information; for K.
