He was the maternal nephew of the N.B.A. player, John Chubby Cox. His father was also a former N.B.A. player. When he was six, his father moved to Italy to play professional basketball, after taking retirement from the N.B.A. Bryant returned to the States in the summers to play in a basketball summer league. He eventually returned to Philadelphia when he was 13 and enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School.

He attended high school in Pennsylvania, where he played varsity basketball. He was the first freshman in decades to start on the varsity team as a freshman. He played all five positions for the Aces over the next three years, compiling a 77–13 record. He averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks, and 2.3 steals as a junior. With 2,883 points, he surpassed Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons as Southeastern Pennsylvania’s all-time leading scorers. He was 17 then and decided to enter the N.B.A. directly in 1996, becoming only the sixth player in N.B.A. history to do so. He was named one of the ‘35 Greatest McDonald’s All-Americans’ in 2012 for his high school play as well as his later achievements.
