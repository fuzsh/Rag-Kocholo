        "text": "Nonprofit advocacy is not about partisan politics. And it’s definitely not about political candidates.\n\nAdvocacy is about educating decision makers about the impact of the public policy decisions they are contemplating. It’s about helping them understand how the people and communities we care about will be impacted. And it’s about making sure that we aren’t sitting on the sidelines while decisions that would positively or negatively impact our missions are being made.\n\nThe Stand for Your Mission campaign seeks to unleash the power of the nonprofit sector through advocacy. It flows from a deep belief in the role of nonprofit organizations in identifying solutions and finding common ground. And an unwavering commitment to the communities and people we serve.\n\nLearn more about how your board can be a part of it."
