        "text": "Looking to volunteer your time to help arts organizations? Consider telling your story to help advocate for increased arts funding and support. Advocacy is a year-round effort and means more than organized, collective actions. YOU can make all the difference.\n\nIn today’s climate, arts funding is constantly at risk. Here are five steps you can take to advocate for the arts:\n\nLearn about the issues: visit your state arts advocacy organization website and/or the regional advocacy websites, below.\n\nCall, write, or email your state’s governor, senators, and/or representatives. Americans for the Arts provides contact information for legislators for all states at the local, state, and national levels.\n\nLearn what committees your legislator serves on. For example, if your Senator serves on the budgeting committee, they will be more involved with setting how much money goes to arts and culture funding. If your Representative sits on the House Interior Appropriations Committee, they will be key to supporting the arts. Remember the arts and humanities cut across many issues from education and technology to veteran affairs and healthcare.\n\nWrite a letter to the editor of your local newspaper. Most limit letters to 200 words or less; check the paper’s website for specific requirements. Share your personal arts and culture stories.\n\nInvite your legislators to arts events or arrange a private tour of your museum or performing arts center. Illustrate how arts and culture thrive in your community.\n\nOther things you can do:\n\nContact friends, neighbors, and colleagues with whom you serve on committees and boards and ask them to support the arts with the above actions.\n\nHost a Call-a-Thon to contact legislators and empower your friends to make a big difference with just a few hours.\n\nUse your social media to voice your support of arts and culture.\n\nNote: At the federal level, the arts retain strong bipartisan support. Follow how your legislators vote in passing budget measures and let them know you’re thankful for this support!\n\nRegional Advocacy Resources"
