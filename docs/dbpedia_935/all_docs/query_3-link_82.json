No one desires a society in which their political rights are restricted, and people have a limited say in the direction of their country. They want to be citizens, not subjects.\n\nUnfortunately, we live in a world where many governments abuse their power and assert total control. Others are in the middle of a democratic transition and seek the establishment of a representative government.\n\nAt IRI, we understand that advancing democracy worldwide is about empowering individuals on a personal level. Once people can raise their voices without fear, and participate in a free and fair political process, they will finally have the tools they need to build a democratic destiny in the country they call home.\n\nIn a true democracy, no one is too small to make a difference."
