        "text": "Greetings and welcome to the Bloomington Core Planning Team!\n\nBloomington. Tomorrow. Together. That last word is especially important. Working toward an intended future for the community is work that takes many hands. Finding consensus on a vision of Bloomington where everyone can see themselves thriving will be a powerful way to build an even greater sense of community than exists today.\n\nThis community’s past and present are the building blocks of the future. These building blocks can form solid structures, but there is something that has to hold them together. In this case, it is you and the other members of the Core Planning Team and the unifying mission we are about to create. Through this process, we will set a course for the future and we will create supporters who encourage the work, stakeholders who urge us to move forward and champions who will cheer us to success.\n\nBy accepting membership to the Core Planning Team you have accepted a shared responsibility in the development of a plan that creates an intended future for Bloomington. Your presence and contribution to this process of transformation will be forever recognized as a distinct turning point in the history of our community. Author Peter Block best sums up our mission in his book titled Community: The Structure of Belonging:\n\nThe essential challenge is to transform the isolation and self-interest within our community into connectedness and caring for the whole. The key is to identify how this transformation occurs. We begin by shifting our attention from the problems of community to the possibility of community. We also need to acknowledge that our wisdom about individual transformation is not enough when it comes to community transformation. So, one purpose here is to bring together our knowledge about the nature of collective transformation. A key insight in this pursuit is to accept the importance of social capital to the life of the community. This begins the effort to create a future distinct from the past.\n\nTo help inform our work, we have compiled this data book. In addition to the input of Bloomington residents who participated in numerous community café discussions, you’ll learn more about the services we provide as a City, the resources that abound in our community, and the amenities that residents, businesses and visitors have come to appreciate. Please take time to read this material prior to our first meeting.\n\nOn behalf of the Bloomington City Council and our entire community, thank you for the contribution of your time and your talent. We look forward to your active and enthusiastic participation.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJamie Verbrugge\n\nCity Manager\n\nJan Almquist\n\nJon Anderson\n\nNancy Brewster\n\nErika Brown\n\nTim Busse\n\nDana Chou\n\nKimberly Clauson\n\nSteve Gurney\n\nFaith Jackson\n\nBrendan Klein\n\nDwayne Lowman\n\nPatrick Martin\n\nLuis Martinez\n\nEric Melbye\n\nSarah Merriman\n\nNur Mood\n\nChao Moua\n\nShamil Mirza\n\nAmos Olivarez\n\nJC St. Onge-Holm\n\nMary Rathsabandith\n\nPriscilla Roberts\n\nKendra Rysan\n\nRon Sarat\n\nJamie Schumacher\n\nMara Stauffacher\n\nEmma Struss\n\nAnn Marie Terpstra\n\nJamie Verbrugge\n\nAlison Warren\n\nFacilitators: Teresa Arpin and Stephen Barone, Transformation Systems, Ltd.\n\nOctober – November, 2021: Community Cafes\n\nOctober 16 – Kennedy High School\n\nOctober 26 – St. Michael’s Lutheran Church\n\nOctober 28 – Virtual café on Zoom\n\nOctober 30 – Blooming Meadows\n\nOctober 30 – Valley View Playfields\n\nNovember 4 – Mall of America\n\nNovember 6 – Action for East African People/Action Care Clinic\n\nOnline community input via Let’s Talk Bloomington and Polco\n\nDecember 2 - 4, 2021: Core Planning Team retreat\n\nJanuary 7, 2022: Measurement Team meeting\n\nJanuary 8, 2022: Action Team meeting\n\nJanuary 28, 2022: Measurement Team meeting\n\nJanuary 29, 2022: Action Team meeting\n\nFebruary 19, 2022: Action Team meeting\n\nMarch 5, 2022: Core Planning Team review of Action Team’s work\n\nMarch - April 2022: City Council considers and adopts the City Manager’s recommendations regarding the strategic plan\n\nPrepared by Transformations System, LLC\n\nDownload appendices\n\nThe City of Bloomington has embarked upon an initiative to build and share a clear vision of the future. As part of the\n\nprocess, the city held six in-person and one virtual World Cafés in October and November 2021, with approximately 148\n\ncommunity members participating.\n\nThe purpose of each World Café was to engage all community stakeholders in conversations, providing them an opportunity\n\nto share their thoughts on Bloomington’s present and future.\n\nThe participants of the World Cafés engaged in dialogue over four questions:\n\nAs you think about Bloomington, what are your top priorities to help our community thrive as a satisfying place to live,\n\nwork and play (for example, community amenities, resources, what we should aspire to, etc.)? Be as specific as\n\npossible.\n\nWhat are the most significant challenges you believe Bloomington will face in the next 3 to 5 years? What are the most\n\nsignificant opportunities?\n\nWhat are the greatest untapped resources within our community that could contribute to our success? What are the\n\ngaps in our community – in other words, what’s missing?\n\nWhat could be the role of your city government to help create the community we envision?\n\nIt is important to recognize that each person who participated in the world café had the opportunity to give multiple\n\nresponses to each question. Notes recorded on tabletop and chart paper were also included in the analysis of the responses.\n\nIn addition to the world cafés, community members were given an opportunity to provide feedback through an online survey\n\nand idea boards. 104 community members participated in these digital engagement tools.\n\nMain themes emerged in the responses and are reported in the summary of findings. Themes are presented in order of\n\nmagnitude. Rounding is used in the display of percentages, so totals may fall within +/- one (1) percent of 100.\n\nAs you think about Bloomington, what are your top priorities to help our community thrive as a satisfying place to live, work and play (for example, community amenities, resources, what we should aspire to, etc.)?

The river also brought occasional European explorers and traders. In the 1820s, Fort Snelling became the first European settlement at the nearby confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. With the fort nearby, some of the earliest settlers in Bloomington were missionaries who came to convert the resident Native Americans.\n\nIn the 1850s, Bloomington began to be settled by Europeans and converted to agricultural uses. On May 11, 1858, on the same day Minnesota became a state, the town of Bloomington was established. Bloomington remained primarily agricultural for a century, raising produce for the growing nearby cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.\n\nIn the 1950s, Bloomington became the classic American “boom town” and its population soared from 9,900 in 1950 to 50,500 in 1960, the same year voters approved the village of Bloomington’s transformation to a city. Bloomington added amenities, businesses, infrastructure and schools to keep up with the growing demand.\n\nSchool enrollment in Bloomington was 700 in 1945 and peaked at 26,000 in 1971. Today public school enrollment is more than 9,700 and the city is home to three colleges/universities, two early childhood education centers, ten elementary schools, three middle schools, two high schools, four private schools and three charter schools.\n\nThe Bloomington volunteer fire department, established in 1947 with 25 members at a cost of $24,000, will celebrate its 75th anniversary in 2022. Today there are six fire stations and 109 paid-on-call firefighters, many who are second and third generation volunteers.\n\nThe Bloomington Police Department was formed with three officers in 1953 at a cost of $2 per taxpayer. That same year, the first traffic signal was installed at the intersection of 98th Street and Lyndale Avenue. Today the police department has 114 sworn officers.\n\nLocated along the Minnesota River, almost a third of the City has been preserved for conservation, public and recreation uses. The first City parks, Bush Lake Beach and Moir Park were created in 1954. Today the City of Bloomington parks and recreation system is extensive with 97 parks, natural areas, 45 playgrounds, 2 golf courses, regional parks, cultural resources, and special use facilities including the Bloomington Ice Garden, Center for the Arts and the Family Aquatic Center.\n\nIn 1956, the $8.5 million Metropolitan Stadium opened and became best known as the home of the Twins and Vikings. Many games later in 1982, when Minnesota's pro baseball and football teams moved out of Bloomington, redevelopment resulted in Mall of America, one of the most visited destinations in the United States. Hospitality is now Bloomington’s number one industry with more than 9,700 hotel rooms in the city.\n\nToday, Bloomington is a dynamic urban center with nearly 90,000 residents and a workforce of 84,000 employees. The city’s central location in the metropolitan area, proximity to freeways and to a major international hub airport resulted in a strong and diverse economy with a mix of commerce and industry. Bloomington is an important economic engine for Minnesota and a major tourist destination for the Upper Midwest.\n\nWith an excellent location and well trained workforce, many great companies have grown and prospered in Bloomington. Today, Bloomington serves as headquarters for businesses both large and small including Toro, Donaldson, Health Partners and many others.\n\nBloomington is one of only 40 cities out of more than 19,000 municipal governments in the U.S. that have achieved three triple-A ratings—the highest ratings from three bond ratings agencies for fiscal management. Bloomington is currently the only Minnesota city to hold all three highest ratings. Excellent bond ratings signal to current and potential investors that the City’s financial future is strong and ensure that interest costs remain low. They also signal to businesses and individuals that Bloomington is a financially healthy community.\n\nBloomington provides excellent transit connections. The city hosts the busiest transit station in Minnesota, in addition to Blue Line light rail transit trains, and Red Line, Orange Line and D-Line bus rapid transit stations.\n\nNow Minnesota’s fourth largest city, Bloomington is growing rapidly. Desirable new housing options are popping up throughout the city to support Bloomington’s growing work force. As Bloomington grows, the City is focused on using creative placemaking to foster vibrant neighborhoods that are interwoven with public art, parks, trails, restaurants, taprooms and opportunities to enjoy the company of others. The focus will be to continue making improvements that will renew and shape the community to ensure that Bloomington remains a high quality place to live, work, do business and visit for years to come.\n\nBloomington’s evolution over 50 years\n\nWhile the overall size of Bloomington’s population has remained stable since 1970, there have been notable shifts in the demographics of its residents.\n\nBloomington’s total population in 2020 was relatively similar to its population 50 years ago:\n\n1970 population: 81,971\n\n2020 population: 89,987\n\nTwo major demographic shifts have shaped Bloomington over the past fifty years – the aging and diversification of the city’s population.\n\nThe percentage of Bloomington’s non-white population is 32 times what it was in 1970.\n\n1970 population: 1% non-white, 99% white\n\n2020 population: 32% non-white, 68% white\n\nChange in Black Indigenous People of Color Population 2010 to 2020 Total and Percentage\n\nHousehold Speaks Language Other than English at Home\n\nLimited English Proficiency\n\nBloomington is on average much older than it was in 1970.

Many industries came to a halt, including the hospitality and entertainment industries.

Those two revenues will likely be about $3 million less than what the City collected in 2019.\n\nLearn more\n\nFor detailed information, including presentation slides from information sessions and recaps of City Council budget discussions, visit blm.mn/budget.\n\nCustomers\n\nThe City of Bloomington’s primary customers are the residents of Bloomington since they receive a majority of services that the City delivers.

The district’s mission statement is: “The Bloomington Public School District is an educational leader developing in all our learners the ability to thrive in a rapidly changing world.”\n\nThe district focuses on developing learning opportunities for children from birth to graduation in a comprehensive framework known as Pathways to Career and College. Bloomington Public Schools’ strategic plan focuses on how the district can help students to be career and college ready. Each learner has a personal growth plan to meet Pathway milestones such as preschool readiness.\n\nNine of the district’s schools are Blue Ribbon Schools of Excellence and another six have received Minnesota School of Excellence designations. A computer science immersion program is offered at Indian Mounds and Poplar Bridge elementary schools and Olson Middle School in partnership with the University of Minnesota. In addition, New Code Academy is a fully online enrollment option for students in grades K-12 available to any Minnesota family. Courses are standards-aligned and hold students to the same level of rigor and assessment as equivalent face-to-face classes.\n\nInformation on school district enrollment and other data is located in the Bloomington by the Numbers section.\n\nThe City’s other key educational partners include:\n\nNormandale Community College\n\nNorthwestern Health Sciences University\n\nPenn Lake and Oxboro Libraries\n\nService clubs and other community partners\n\nBloomington Optimists Club\n\nBloomington Rotary Club\n\nBloomington Lions Club\n\nEducation Foundation of Bloomington\n\nBloomington Community Foundation\n\nBloomington League of Women Voters\n\nEarl C. Hill American Legion Post 550\n\nEverett McClay VFW Post 1296\n\nCompetitors\n\nBloomington competes nationally for business creation, relocation and retention—specifically with the Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Denver, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle metropolitan areas. Bloomington is an investor in Greater MSP and partners with the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development to recruit, retain and develop businesses and entrepreneurs. Greater MSP targets companies in the headquarters and business services, health and life sciences, food and water solutions, advanced manufacturing and technology, and financial services industries.\n\nA key draw to Bloomington, and the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, is that it possesses one of the nation’s most steady and diversified economies. The region has strengths in several key sectors such as health care, manufacturing, agricultural and food products, biomedical and finance, professional and business services, education, health services, and leisure and hospitality.\n\nBloomington’s broad economic base includes a diverse mix of industries including technology, health care, retail and manufacturing. Mall of America is the city's largest employer, with approximately 13,000 jobs. In addition to the Mall of America, Bloomington is home to several large corporations including The Toro Company, Donaldson Company, HealthPartners, and Seagate Technology. Prior to the pandemic, the economy was expanding quickly, propelled by commercial development.\n\nBloomington also competes in the leisure and business travel market. Voted the Best Value City in the U.S. by Meetings & Conventions Magazine, Bloomington is a desirable travel location due to its convenience to downtown Minneapolis, Saint Paul and the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. With more than 47 hotels and more than 9,700 rooms, Bloomington has the largest concentration of hotel rooms in Minnesota. The City of Bloomington contracts with the Bloomington Convention & Visitor’s Bureau to market to leisure and business travel customers.\n\nWhen it comes to attracting new residents, Bloomington’s competition comes from Minneapolis, Saint Paul and surrounding suburbs. Bloomington offers prospective residents the value proposition of good transportation access, competitive housing prices, excellent schools, a full range of municipal services, an expansive park and open space system, quality arts and cultural programs, low property taxes and a safe and stable community. Research indicates that potential buyers and Realtors underestimate the strength of these community assets, so creating a more realistic understanding of Bloomington’s advantages is a marketing opportunity.\n\nHow Bloomington ranks in comparison to other communities\n\nWhat makes a community livable? Safe and healthy neighborhoods, plenty of parks and open spaces, quality transportation systems, clean and safe drinking water, diverse and affordable housing options, and good value for property taxes paid are just a few of the items on residents’ checklists that contribute to a higher quality of life.\n\nThe 2021 National Community Survey provides the results of Bloomington resident responses to questions about overall livability and compares them to resident perspectives gathered in surveys from more than 600 communities whose residents evaluated the same kinds of topics. The comparison evaluations are from the most recent survey completed in each community in the last five years.\n\nThe below summary shows the comparisons of some of Bloomington’s survey results to those from other communities. Bloomington’s results are noted as being “higher,” “lower” or “similar” to the benchmark, meaning that the average rating given by Bloomington residents is statistically similar to or different than the benchmark.\n\nFor a complete listing of benchmark comparisons, see page 36 of the 2021 National Citizen Survey at blm.mn/NCS21.\n\nA snapshot of 2021 survey ratings and community comparisons\n\nQuality of Life in Bloomington Rating (Excellent or good) Community Comparison Bloomington as a place to live 91% Similar Your neighborhood as a place to live 88% Similar Overall quality of life in Bloomington 90% Similar Characteristics of Bloomington Economic health 78% Similar Quality of the transportation system 71% Similar Quality of the utility infrastructure (water, sewer, storm water, electric/gas) 88% Higher Feeling of safety 80% Similar Quality of natural environment 89% Similar Quality of parks and recreation opportunities 89% Similar Health and wellness opportunities 84% Similar Opportunities for education, culture and the arts 81% Similar Residents' connection and engagement with their community 58% Similar Variety of housing options 68% Higher Availability of affordable quality housing 48% Similar Variety of business and service establishments 76% Higher Vibrancy of shopping areas 64% Similar Employment opportunities 75% Higher Public places where people want to spend time 74% Similar Overall appearance 74% Similar Overall image or reputation 75% Similar Bloomington’s performance Making all residents feel welcome 79% Similar Attracting people from diverse backgrounds 79% Higher City government performance Overall confidence in Bloomington government 67% Similar The value of services for the taxes paid 66% Similar Overall direction that Bloomington is taking 67% Similar Quality of City of Bloomington services 80% Similar Welcoming resident involvement 64% Similar Being open and transparent to the public 66% Similar Informing residents about issues facing the community 68% Similar\n\nAbout The NCS™\n\nThe National Community Survey™ (The NCS™) report is about the “livability” of Bloomington. A livable community is a place that is not simply habitable, but that is desirable. It is not only where people do live, but where they want to live. The survey was developed by the experts at Polco's National Research Center.\n\nGreat communities are partnerships of the government, private sector, community-based organizations and residents, all geographically connected. The NCS captures residents’ opinions considering ten central facets of a community:\n\nEconomy\n\nMobility\n\nCommunity Design\n\nUtilities\n\nSafety\n\nNatural Environment\n\nParks and Recreation\n\nHealth and Wellness\n\nEducation, Arts, and Culture\n\nInclusivity and Engagement\n\nThe report provides the opinions of a representative sample of 732 Bloomington residents collected from April 20, 2021 to June 8, 2021. The margin of error around any reported percentage is 4% for all respondents and the response rate for the 2021 survey was 21%. Survey results were weighted so that the demographic profile of respondents was representative of the demographic profile of adults in Bloomington.\n\nRead the full report\n\nIn April 2016, the City of Bloomington’s leadership team and staff engaged with the City Council on a strategic planning process for the three-year period of 2017- 2020. The strategic plan consisted of a set of six strategic priorities – issues of highest priority for the City Council. The six strategic priorities were:\n\nCommunity amenities\n\nCommunity image\n\nFocused renewal\n\nEnvironmental sustainability\n\nHigh quality service delivery\n\nInclusion and equity\n\nWithin each strategic priority was a set of desired outcomes, key outcome indicators, and performance targets which described expected results and how the results would be measured. In May - June 2016, City staff and community partners developed strategic initiatives for each priority that defined the actions that would be taken to achieve the targeted outcomes.\n\nThe City Council amended the strategic plan in February 2020 to add “engagement and transparency” as a seventh strategic priority. Since communication and engagement are key components of most City projects and initiatives, this priority encouraged staff and Council to think more intentionally about when it was appropriate to use various forms of engagement (ranging from the most basic tactic of informing, all the way to empowerment). This priority also put an emphasis on how the City communicates its plans and expectations with residents and stakeholders.\n\nIn early 2021, the City Council decided to continue its strategic plan through the end of 2021. The Council also added the following initiatives under three of its strategic priorities:\n\nEnvironmental sustainability: Enhance natural resources\n\nFocused renewal: Home ownership opportunities; diversity local economy; neighborhood commercial nodes\n\nHigh quality service delivery: Staff innovation/boldness\n\nThe City Council received progress reports from staff for each of its strategic priorities on a quarterly basis. These quarterly updates were made available to the public on the City’s website.\n\nBelow is a chart of the original strategic plan indicating desired outcomes, key outcome indicators, performance targets and strategic initiatives for each priority. Also enclosed is a summary of how the City performed in in meeting the performance targets for each strategic initiative.\n\nPerformance target outcomes\n\nCommunity Amenities\n\nComprehensive funding strategy for capital needs\n\nPerformance Target: Capital Improvement Plan adopted Q2 2018.\n\nUpdate: The 10-year Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is adopted by City Council before December 31 of each year. The performance target was intended to align the timing of the CIP with the adoption of the yearly budget. The 2021-2030 CIP was adopted December 21, 2020.\n\nCommunity center decision Performance Target: Following task force input, series of City Council decisions on whether to move forward, and if so, site options, funding strategies, etc., starting in January 2017. Update: In December 2019, the City Council decided that a proposal for a community center design at Valley View Park was not viable and no formal action was taken. The need for facility and park investments was addressed in the Park System Master Plan, adopted in August 2021. The plan includes a comparison with benchmark communities and national standards for recreation facilities.\n\nStrong support for City-owned amenities and park/recreation facilities\n\nPerformance Target: Majority of survey responses indicate strong support for facilities and parks.\n\nUpdate: Below are the percentages of respondents to the annual National Community Survey of Bloomington residents who rated Bloomington’s parks and recreational facilities as excellent or good:\n\nCity Parks Recreation Centers or Facilities 2016 87% 74% 2017 89% 77% 2018 88% 74% 2019 91% 75% 2020 89% 71% 2021 87% 74%\n\nCommunity Image\n\nOne Bloomington\n\nPerformance Target: One Bloomington marketing campaign adopted by Q3 2017.\n\nUpdate: Since launching the One Bloomington marketing campaign in 2017, the City has continuously promoted each of the One Bloomington strategic priorities to the community through video, cable television, print, social media and events such as the State of the City.\n\nPositive image of Bloomington\n\nPerformance Target: 85% of residents report favorable image.\n\nUpdate: The percentage of respondents to the annual National Community Survey of Bloomington residents who rated Bloomington’s overall image as excellent since 2016 is reported below:\n\nOverall Image 2016 76% 2017 81% 2018 81% 2019 80% 2020 79% 2021 75%\n\nJoint marketing with school district\n\nPerformance Target: Three marketing activities with school district.\n\nUpdate: Joint marketing efforts have included:\n\nPromotion of School-City partnership and joint activities;\n\nTargeted promotion of the School District’s activities and achievements via print, video and State of the City events;\n\nUse of the City’s communications channels and resources to highlight and market specific school activities.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nReduce citywide carbon footprint\n\nPerformance Target: Reduce Bloomington’s greenhouse gas emissions with an energy-related performance target of 75% reduction by 2035.\n\nUpdate: The City tracks Bloomington’s natural gas and electricity emissions savings on an annual basis.\n\nImprove surface water quality\n\nPerformance Target: Meet adopted standard for each water body.\n\nUpdate: 2020 surface water monitoring results indicated the 2018 Normandale Lake project has reduced frequency and biomass of curly-leaf pondweed. 2020 summer averages for water quality indicators met state shallow lake standards for chlorophyll a concentration and Secchi disc transparency depth, but exceeded standards for total phosphorus concentration. Chloride concentrations were found to be below the chronic MPCA criterion\n\nHyland Lake was listed as impaired for nutrients by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in 2016. The City worked with Three Rivers Park District to support several years of curly-leaf pondweed treatments. In 2019, Three Rivers Park District completed an alum treatment on Hyland Lake in partnership with the Riley Purgatory Bluff Creek Watershed District. Surface water quality monitoring results for 2020 found Hyland Lake to be meeting state standards for chlorophyll a concentration, secchi disc transparency depth, and total phosphorus concentration. Monitoring efforts will continue.\n\nReduce volumes delivered to landfills/incinerators\n\nPerformance Target: 10% reduction in tonnage.\n\nUpdate: In 2019, the diversion rate was 27%. The estimated residential solid waste diversion rate for 2020 was 36%. New in 2020, the diversion rate included the estimated tons of yard waste composted based on direction from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The inclusion of yard waste composting in the overall estimated residential diversion rate for 2020 is the main reason for the reported 9% increase in diversion.\n\nEstimated residential diversion rate = Estimated residential waste diverted (curbside recycling, estimated curbside yard waste, estimated community organics drop-offs, curbside cleanup appliance recycling) divided by residential waste generation (curbside trash collection, curbside cleanup trash, curbside recycling, curbside yard waste collection, community organics drop-offs, and curbside cleanup appliance recycling).\n\nEnhance natural resources (added Q1 2021)\n\nPerformance Target: Identify a list of projects for resident participation/partnership; identify grant-funding resources and other interagency/foundation funding opportunities; explore whether there are ways the City could knit “community” together for these projects.\n\nUpdate: The Sustainability Commission worked with Parks and Recreation and Park Maintenance staff to develop activities in 2021 designed to engage residents and bring people together around natural resources. These included: Earth Day Celebration; garlic mustard pull at Parker’s Picnic Grounds; tree planting at Countryside Park, Tarnhill Park and River Ridge playlot; and a buckthorn bust/Zumba event.\n\nThe Park System Master Plan is recommending the creation of a natural resources management plan that will develop a priority list of restoration projects and suggest potential funding sources for completing the work. It is anticipated that a focus on natural resources restoration will continue to be a significant part of the Sustainability Commission’s work plan in 2022.\n\nFocused Renewal\n\nMore affordable housing\n\nPerformance Target: Meet Met Council 2030 affordable housing target.\n\nUpdate: The development pipeline continues to grow with affordable housing units. Development of affordable units is at72% of the Metropolitan Council’s 2030 affordable housing target and is on track to exceed the City’s goals.\n\nRenew priority neighborhood commercial nodes\n\nPerformance Target: Meet adopted schedule.\n\nUpdate: Redevelopment strategies for Bloomington’s top three neighborhood commercial nodes – Old Cedar Avenue and Old Shakopee Road, 98th Street and Nicollet Avenue, and Portland Avenue and American Boulevard – were identified and prioritization was completed. There has not been as much opportunity for commercial redevelopment.\n\nSuccessful neighborhood renewal innovation\n\nPerformance Target: Council and neighborhood agree on successful project innovation.\n\nUpdate: The 2019 Neighborhood Focus Area program was administered as well as the Curb Appeal Loan Program. In 2020, 51 home improvement program loans were completed that included a focus on exterior improvements. The loans were offered citywide to income-qualified homeowners at a maximum of $35,000. The Curb Appeal loan program was paused in 2020 due to declining participation, as homeowners opted for the citywide home improvement loan program.\n\nHome ownership opportunities (added Q1 2021)\n\nPerformance Target: Research home ownership opportunities in other cities and evaluate their applicability to Bloomington; develop/enhance a marketing program; follow the research of the Federal Reserve Bank on home ownership; study flexible zoning and land use policies regarding R-1 districts.\n\nUpdate: A City-sponsored down payment assistance program, including marketing strategies, will be recommended by fourth quarter 2021. Federal Reserve Bank home ownership research has been followed and staff were included in ongoing focus groups and conversations. A project to review and revise zoning standards for single family dwellings, two-family dwellings and accessory dwelling units is underway, with completion anticipated in the first half of 2022.\n\nDiversify local economy (added Q1 2021)\n\nPerformance Target: Assess staff/organizational capacity for traditional economic development activity; research establishment of an Economic Development Authority (EDA).\n\nUpdate: The Bloomington Port Authority has the statutory powers of an Economic Development Authority and more. Whether the City, Port Authority and Housing and Redevelopment Authority should reorganize to address Economic Development Authority activities, rebrand or add an EDA will be the subject of a service assessment scheduled for completion in fourth quarter 2021. The service assessment will include an analysis of staffing needs to add EDA functionality.\n\nNeighborhood commercial nodes (added Q1 2021)\n\nPerformance Target: Spur redevelopment with economic development/expansion diversification ideas.\n\nUpdate: Opportunity for commercial redevelopment in additional areas has been identified and currently in varying stages of the redevelopment process. The Lyndale Avenue Retrofit, 90th Street and Penn Avenue, Portland Avenue and American Boulevard, Penn American District, 98th Street Station Plan and the small business survey will help direct future economic development support.\n\nHigh Quality Service Delivery\n\nFinancial sustainability of all funds\n\nPerformance Target: Each of the approved budgets should include working capital goals and actual/projected workin capital balances. The actual/projected working capital balances should be at 80% or better of the working capital goal.\n\nUpdate: Of 32 budgeted funds, 24 have working capital balances of more than 90% of their working capital goals.\n\nThe General Fund working capital balance was at 118% of its working capital goal at the end of 2020.\n\nFour funds are between 60% to 90% of their working capital goals – Cemetery, Park Grants, Water Utility Operating, and Motor Vehicle.\n\nThe Golf Course and Enhanced 911 funds are between 25% to 34% of their working capital goals.\n\nFor the Accrued Benefits Fund, current assets were 82% of accrued long-term liabilities, with a goal of being 100% funded by 2032.\n\nLong-term models for these funds show working capital balances achieving at least 80% of their goals in the next 2 to 7 years.\n\nMeet customer expectations\n\nPerformance Target: 85% satisfied customers.\n\nUpdate:\n\nCustomer service Excellent or good 2016 79% 2017 85% 2018 85% 2019 82% 2020 86% 2021 88%\n\nImproved customer service\n\nPerformance Target: Meet targeted improvement levels in five areas as determined by survey results, staff analysis and community/customer feedback.\n\nUpdate: Service assessments that incorporated survey results, staff analyses and community/customer feedback were completed in six areas:\n\n2017 – Print Shop\n\n2018 – Public Health, Human Services (which was restructured into the Community Outreach and Engagement Division)\n\n2020 – Fleet Maintenance, Fire Services, Police Dispatch\n\nStaff innovation/boldness (added Q1 2021)\n\nPerformance Target: Utilize rapid prototyping that focuses on refinement while implementing.\n\nUpdate: Initiatives that utilized a rapid prototyping approach in 2021 have included:\n\nA new energy disclosure component of the Time of Sale housing evaluation that would provide property buyers with information on the energy performance of the home, bringing visibility and value to home energy improvements.\n\nThe proposed large building benchmarking ordinance would require large commercial, multifamily, and public buildings to be benchmarked annually in order to address the City’s community development and climate goals.\n\nAn ordinance amendment that prohibits the sale of all flavored tobacco products, including menthol, and sunset the availability of new tobacco retail licenses in the city in order to protect youth and marginalized communities from the harms of commercial tobacco products.\n\nThe Just Deeds project, which is focused on helping owners remove discriminatory covenants from properties.\n\nAn equitable contracting microbusiness, which is applying a racial equity lens to the City’s purchasing procedures in order to break down barriers and encourage more small, minority-owned, women-owned and underutilized businesses to engage with the City.\n\nNew components to the City’s recruitment process such as a search committee and recruitment plan designed to increase the diversity of the organization’s workforce so that it mirror’s Bloomington’s population and increases diversity in leadership positions.\n\nA racial equity impact assessment tool that integrates explicit consideration of racial equity in City decisions, including policies, practices, programs and budgets.\n\nInclusion and Equity\n\nMore diverse advisory boards\n\nPerformance Target: Composition of boards is reflective of the community.\n\nBoards and Commissions – August 2021* Bloomington Residents** Asian 4 6% Asian 6.6% Black 7 10% Black 9.8% Hispanic/Latinx 3 4% Hispanic/Latinx 9.9% Native American 0 0% Native American 0.5% Other Race 2 3% Other Race 5.2% White 37 54% White 68.1% Unknown 16 23% Unknown 100% TOTAL 69 100% 100%\n\n*Does not include Charter Commission members\n\n**2020 US Census\n\nMore diverse workforce\n\nPerformance Target: Workforce is reflective of the community.\n\nFull-Time Staff – August 2021 Bloomington Residents* Asian 17 3.1% Asian 6.6% Black 22 4.1% Black 9.8% Hispanic/Latinx 17 3.1% Hispanic/Latinx 9.9% Native American 2 0.4% Native American 0.5% Other Race 3 0.6% Other Race 5.2% White 480 88.7% White 68.1% TOTAL 541 100% 100%\n\n*2020 US Census\n\nMore diverse program participation\n\nPerformance Target: Increase in share of program participants who identify as racial or ethnic minorities.\n\nUpdate: Excluding certain select areas, program participation data is generally not collected and disaggregated by race by the City. The Racial Equity Business Plan adopted by the City Council commits to tracking outreach event participation by race. The City has the opportunity to begin tracking event participation by utilizing some version of contact cards at events and/or requesting the information via registration channels.\n\nEngagement and Transparency (added Q1 2020)\n\nPerformance Target: Ensure proactive communication around City projects and services and create multiple channels for civic engagement and feedback.\n\nUpdate: The Community Outreach and Engagement Division was established in 2019 to use innovative and authentic approaches to facilitate, engage and connect with internal and external stakeholders. The division also serves as an advocate and change agent to ensure the community is considered, accounted for and heard in the development and delivery of programs and services.\n\nInitiatives designed to ensure proactive communication around City projects and services have included:\n\nLet’s Talk Bloomington, an online digital engagement tool for community conversations on current and future projects\n\n“Council Minute,” a weekly video series hosted by Mayor Tim Busse featuring highlights from each City Council meeting and other City news.\n\nA change in the start time of City Council meetings from 7 p.m. to 6 p.m. to provide more flexibility and opportunity for resident engagement.\n\n“Q & A with BPD,” a video series where the police chief, police officers and staff answer questions from residents.\n\nPolco, a web-based survey tool to solicit real-time feedback.\n\nA series of public outreach events to solicit community input on the Park Master Plan and Lyndale Avenue Retrofit projects.\n\nA Community Budget Advisory Committee that engaged with the community on the City’s budget and services to inform their recommendations on the 2021 budget for the City Council.\n\nVirtual meetings on a regular basis throughout the pandemic with Bloomington’s faith communities, multi-unit housing managers, community leaders, seniors and congregate living facilities to provide information on City services and resources.\n\nForward 2040 Comprehensive Plan\n\nThe City started the process of updating its comprehensive plan - Forward 2040 - in 2016 by articulating a vision for Bloomington’s future that reflects how Bloomington has, and continues to change. The City’s population had remained relatively stable since 1970, but has become much more diverse and thousands of new jobs have been added. By 2040, the Metropolitan Council forecasts that Bloomington will add 6,000 additional residents and 17,000 additional jobs. To implement the vision, the Forward 2040 plan established a set of goals and policies to guide future land uses and investments in City services such as parks, community facilities, transportation, and sewer and water systems over the next 20 years.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nMinnesota law requires all cities, counties and townships within the seven-county metropolitan region to update their comprehensive plan every 10 years. Community engagement is a cornerstone of the comprehensive planning process. In the summer of 2016, City employees hosted three town hall meetings to gather ideas and input from community. The meetings focused on topics identified as priorities for Bloomington’s future, including: sustainability, diversity and engagement, and City amenities and aging infrastructure.\n\nIdentifying aging infrastructure\n\nMuch of Bloomington’s public infrastructure (roads, parks, sewers, fire stations) and housing were built to accommodate the City’s rapid growth in the ‘60s and ‘70s. While roads are routinely upgraded through the City’s Pavement Management Program and private homes are continually renovated by their owners, other public infrastructure is nearing the end of its serviceable life and will need replacement in coming years. For example, the City’s fire stations and some park buildings are more than 40 years old. There are also many sewer pipes and water mains that are more than 50 years old. These public facilities are critical to the quality of life in Bloomington and replacement must be done in a strategic manner.\n\nResident advisory committee\n\nIn September of 2016, the City Council appointed a resident advisory committee to assist staff with Forward 2040. Half of the advisory committee members were representatives from the City’s various boards and commissions. The other half were residents. The advisory committee met monthly, beginning in October 2016 and through 2017. City staff worked with the advisory committee to draft policies and strategies, which were subject to public review in a series of town hall meetings that occurred in summer and fall 2017.\n\nPublic comment and recommendations\n\nMany opportunities were provided for the public to comment on the recommendations in the draft Forward 2040 Comprehensive Plan update in 2018 at various public events, including farmers markets, Summer Fete, Heritage Days and more. In late 2018, informational meetings and public hearings were held with the Bloomington City Council, Planning Commission, and other City advisory commissions. The purpose of these meetings was to get feedback and direction on key aspects of the plan, such as: the vision, identification of priority issues and opportunities, and goals and strategies.\n\nThe final plan\n\nA final draft of the Forward 2040 plan was submitted for the Metropolitan Council’s review in December 2018. The Metropolitan Council approved the plan in July 2019 and the City Council adopted the Forward 2040 Comprehensive Plan Update in August 2019. The adopted Forward 2040 document addresses comments received during the review and community engagement processes. Read the plan at blm.mn/plan/forward-2040-documents.\n\nOpportunity Housing Ordinance\n\nThe City’s Opportunity Housing ordinance promotes the development of new affordable housing and the preservation of existing naturally occurring affordable housing while furthering private market development in the city. As a result of the ordinance, developers will now offer at least 9% affordable units in all newly constructed and renovated housing developments of 20 units or more. The City has also increased flexibility in building and design requirements, reduced fees, expedited the approval process and increased financial resources available to housing developers as incentives to produce affordable housing.\n\nHousing is affordable when rent or mortgage costs are equal to 30% or less of a household’s income. The HRA’s affordable housing goals include promoting the development of new affordable housing and preservation of existing naturally occurring affordable housing while furthering private market development.\n\n2030 Goal: Preserve naturally occurring affordable housing\n\nThere are 4,602 naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH) rental units in 94 apartment buildings throughout Bloomington. HRA is developing community engagement strategies to improve communications with property owners and tenants to preserve NOAH units. Considering the economic impacts of COVID-19, the preservation of NOAH property is more crucial now than ever. HRA is leveraging sources for development activities that assist in the stabilization of NOAH units, such as acquisition, preservation, rehabilitation and new construction.\n\n2030 Goal: Develop 845 new affordable units\n\nHRA is off to a strong start in supporting the need for both affordable and market rate rental housing in the City since the launch of the Opportunity Housing Ordinance and establishment of a $15 million Affordable Housing Trust Fund in 2019.\n\nPark System Master Plan\n\nIn August 2021, the City Council adopted the Park System Master Plan, which provides a clear action plan and guidance for improvements to Bloomington’s parks, trails, facilities, recreational programs and green spaces.\n\n“We want to ensure that generations to come will benefit from the continued enjoyment of Bloomington’s beautiful parks and amenities,” Stephanie Tungseth, Chair of the Parks, Arts and Recreation Commission said. “The thoughtful and methodical framework of the plan will enable the City of Bloomington to have the flexibility needed to continually meet the needs of its dynamic and ever-changing community and the community’s needs.”\n\nEnsuring the vibrancy of parks and green spaces for decades to come\n\nThe purpose of the Park System Master Plan was to establish a clear, 20-year vision for the Bloomington park system, which includes parks, trails, recreation, and open space. It will serve as a blueprint for planning and completing park improvements, program planning, and budgeting to serve the needs of the community.\n\nThe development of the plan took nearly two years. “This plan is what it is today due to the staff’s desire and attempts at soliciting our community’s engagement, their prioritization to meaningfully integrate the community feedback into the plan, and their extensive data-driven research,” PARC Member Laura Perreault said.\n\nA plan developed with extensive community engagement\n\nThe extensive community engagement process that occurred between November 2019 and June 2021 included a statistically valid survey, stakeholder interviews, listening sessions, conversations with residents and staff, and online interactive engagement via project bloom! and the City’s Let’s Talk Bloomington site.\n\nFour “Priority Park Elements” established\n\nBased on the extensive engagement and participation of the public, staff, PARC and City Council in the planning process, four “Priority Park Elements” were established:\n\nNatural resources\n\nPark system need—level of service\n\nTrails and mobility\n\nEquity\n\nFor more information about the plan, visit blm.mn/park-master-plan."
