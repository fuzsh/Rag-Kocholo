        "text": "First, what is civic engagement?\n\nCivic engagement (aka civic participation) is about being involved in and caring about your community. Civic engagement allows people to participate in community decisions and policies that affect their day-to-day lives. It includes not only improving conditions for you and your family but your community and society as a whole. That is, civic engagement is about working toward the common good. In our increasingly polarized political climate, civic engagement can help you learn how to handle disagreement, find common ground, and seek solutions that have the best chance of improving your community. (Looking for tips on how to find common ground? Check out our Defining Tolerance and Civility guide.)\n\nCivic engagement is also tied to a person’s access to resources and opportunities. Inequitable access can lead to inequitable civic participation. This lack of participation can then result in those with power and wealth making decisions on behalf of others and underinvestment in minority and low-income communities. Therefore, civic engagement must also include actively promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in civic spaces and activities.\n\nVote! And engage in all aspects of the voting process\n\nYour vote is one of the most powerful tools to make your voice heard and hold elected officials accountable.\n\nIt’s important to vote in EVERY election.\n\nThis includes primaries, mid-terms, state, and local elections. A handful of votes often decides local elections, but the people elected make life-altering decisions that affect your day-to-day. For example, school boards, city councils, and city clerks make decisions about whether your roads get repaved and what kids are taught in school. State legislators control things like abortion rights, minimum wages, gun control, and voting rights. Your vote is incredibly important. Listen to activist and rapper, YelloPain, break it down.\n\nThe first step to voting is making sure you are registered. Then, you need to make a voting plan. This includes knowing when, where, and how to vote. See our Voting Matters guide for a step-by-step guide. It also includes resources on the below actions.\n\nOther ways to support the voting process:\n\nHelp others register to vote by sharing information, participating in voter registration drives, and talking to your friends, family, and neighbors. Especially if you know someone who has just moved, turned 18, or recently changed their name.\n\nHelp increase voter turnout by volunteering for Get Out the Vote efforts and helping others get to the polls. For example, you can coordinate with local groups or senior centers to provide transportation for those who may need it.\n\nSupport speakers of other languages by volunteering to translate and interpret. Policies vary from state to state so check with a voting rights organization in your area on how it works.\n\nDefend the right to vote by demanding reforms to our voting process, defeating voter suppression laws, passing voting rights protections, and securing the right to vote for all citizens.\n\nBecome a poll worker. In 2020, the U.S. faced a record shortage of poll workers. As a poll worker, you can help ensure safe and fair elections where everyone’s vote is counted.\n\nIf you own a business, guarantee your workers can take the time they need to vote and offer discounts to customers who provide proof of voting on election days.\n\nAttend or host debate watch parties. Watching and discussing debates in a group can help you reflect on the issues that matter most to your community and help prepare you to vote. Check out this Debate Watching 101 tip sheet from the League of Women Voters.\n\nStay informed\n\nIn today’s hostile political climate, some people prefer to avoid talking about politics. Others disengage because they are distrustful of the government or disillusioned about its ability to improve their lives. Still, others get sucked into a world of misinformation. However, being well-informed is central to civic engagement.\n\nSeek out credible news\n\nFake news is everywhere. With the rise of social media, a decline in local newspapers, large media sites spreading misinformation, and echo chambers that reinforce your point of view, it can be hard to know if your news source is trustworthy.\n\nLearn how to spot fake news.\n\nFact check it before you share it.\n\nRead and subscribe to your local and regional newspapers. A decrease in local newspapers has led to “news deserts,” where people lack access to credible and comprehensive news about what’s happening in their community. This has been shown to increase political polarization and impact national voting patterns.\n\nTry to understand other people’s perspectives. While some argue that “bothsideism” has gone too far — by preventing the media from calling out lies and misinformation, and promoting bad-faith arguments — it is important to get out of your echo chamber and to listen to other points of view. Groups like All Sides, Pro Con, and The Better Arguments Project try to provide balanced perspectives without succumbing to bothsideism. Check out additional tips in our Defining Tolerance and Civility guide.\n\nBrowse this comprehensive list of organizations engaged in transforming polarization and division created by the International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution.\n\nGet to know your representatives\n\nUse thisCommon Cause database orBallotpedia tool to see the bills they’ve introduced, committees they serve on, and political contributions they’ve received.\n\nFollow your reps on social media and sign up to receive their emails (think: updates, invites to local events, newsletters) to learn more about what they stand for and the actions they are taking.\n\nNot sure who your reps are? Read our Who Are My Reps? guide.\n\nContact your elected officials\n\nYou can use the power of your voice and your vote by contacting elected officials directly, organizing with fellow members of your community, putting public pressure on elected officials to meet your demands, and holding them accountable when they don’t. Learn more in our How To Contact Your Reps guide.\n\nOrganize a film/documentary screening\n\nFilm screenings can be used to increase awareness and knowledge on an issue affecting your community, create space for reflection, provide opportunities for people with different perspectives to exchange viewpoints, and co-create community solutions that identify actionable next steps. PBS’s POV films are an excellent place to start. They also have a guide on how to host a screening.\n\nAttend local meetings and events\n\nPublic forums\n\nCity council, town hall, and community board meetings (think: school board or planning commission) generally don’t get a lot of attendees. That’s because, let’s face it, they can feel kind of boring. But, if you stick with it, you might just find yourself getting sucked in and forming strong opinions. Since the onset of the global pandemic, many meetings are now available to watch online. You can also check on your town’s website for meeting minutes.\n\nFind out what’s happening where you live. Check on your municipality’s website for upcoming meetings or look for a wide range oflocal events listed in Indivisible’s database.\n\nAssociations\n\nNeighborhood associations and Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) are just two examples of local civic associations that can provide an opportunity to improve your community’s health and wellbeing.\n\nJoin a local group\n\nGetting involved in a local group (from the Lions Club to Indivisible) is a great way to engage civically. Joining a group can foster a sense of social cohesion and provide an opportunity to engage in collective action. Check out our Take Action guides for ideas on how to find organizations focused on the issues in your community that you care about.\n\nVolunteer with your local government or run for office\n\nThere are a variety of elected and non-elected positions that help local government structures operate. Check out your municipality’s website for opportunities.\n\nElected positions: Consider running for office. In many smaller communities, candidates often run unopposed. This is also true for more obscure positions in larger cities. If you are looking to get things done and make a difference on the issues you care about, don’t count yourself out. We bet you have more to offer than you think. Learn more at Run for Something.\n\nNon-elected positions: Many local, county, and district offices rely on volunteer roles that enable local governments to function and provide more services to residents. Contact your local government offices to learn about opportunities.\n\nVolunteer for a political candidate, political action committee, or community advocacy group. Look for opportunities on the website of your go-to political organizations or check out Mobilize, a clearinghouse for events and volunteer opportunities.\n\nLook for other opportunities at your public library, parks and recreation department, community center, youth center, state and national parks, and public schools. Reach out to them directly or visit Volunteer.gov.\n\nCreate diverse, equitable, and inclusive civic spaces\n\nEveryone has the right to be civically engaged. Yet, we continue to have under-representation of historically excluded groups in civic spaces. Equitable and inclusive civic engagement requires community members to confront and address institutionalized forms of bias and discrimination (think: racism, sexism, ableism, classism) and unjust abuses of power.\n\nWe all hold power and privilege. It can be based on race, ethnicity, social status, income level, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, ability, age, etc. It’s necessary to be aware of the privileges and power you hold to address power imbalances and make others feel welcome and valued. It’s also important to create space for all people to participate and all voices to be heard, particularly those that have a history of being silenced or ignored.\n\nIn addition, some communities suffer from decades of disinvestment, underinvestment, and segregation that weaken civic spaces and the community’s ability to influence decisions affecting their lives. This under-representation and disinvestment is both a cause and consequence of ongoing oppression and inequity in our society. In order to have equitable civic participation, we must invest in historically disinvested and underinvested communities, and transform civic spaces and activities to be more diverse and inclusive.\n\nLearn more in the Six Principles for Equitable and Inclusive Civic Engagement.\n\nPromote civic education\n\nCivic education empowers us to be well-informed, active citizens by teaching us about civic practices and allowing us to practice taking informed action. Yet, Americans are undereducated about civics. Not all states require civic education. And even in states that do, there has been underinvestment in the subject. Further, unequal access to quality civic education disproportionately impacts low income and students of color. There are signs that this is starting to change. Following the January 6 Capitol Riot, at least 34 states have introduced 88 bills to strengthen civics education in public schools.\n\nLearn more and get involved at CivXNOW, a bi-partisan coalition that advocates for K-12 in and out-of-school programs to cultivate civic skills and values.\n\nTake Action\n\nChoose one action and just do it!\n\nDon’t get stuck in analysis paralysis. Everyone has something important to offer. We present a range of actions that empower you to help in ways that are right for you. Whether you have five minutes or five hours, you can make a difference."
