You can also watch on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nThe Parade Cam broadcast will be hosted by entrepreneur and host Alex Pomes and \"Planet NOLA\" podcast host Mary Jacobs with a guest appearance from AJ Allegra of The NOLA Project.\n\nThis year's Parade Cam sponsors are NewOrleans.com and the National World War II Museum.\n\nLooking for another NOLA.com Parade Cam broadcast? Click here for the full schedule.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe Krewe of Proteus was born in 1882, making it the second-oldest krewe in Mardi Gras. The group treasures its traditions, rolling on origina…\n\nThe Krewe of Okeanos makes its 75th year in 2024, which prompted the theme \"Okeanos celebrates 75.\" Okeanos will have 350 riders on 22 floats.\n\nThis krewe has only ever had one double-decker float and it's called Hippocampus. Riders toss Hippocampus medallion beads and novelty plus items. The king is the only one to throw blue doubloons.\n\nNext up, the Krewe of Mid-City has 210 male riders on 14 floats, plus a new Tribute to City Park float. Mid-City, founded in 1933, picked the theme \"Cheers to Ninety Years\" for 2024.\n\nMid-City riders will throw crawfish trays, metal cups, krewe t-shirts and more.
