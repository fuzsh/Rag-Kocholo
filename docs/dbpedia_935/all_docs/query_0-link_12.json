Through extensive research, we now more fully understand the influence of the MRGO while it was open and the influence of the closure structure put in place in 2009. This information is critical to restoration efforts in and around New Orleans. At the same time, the ecosystem restoration recommended by the Federal government, the state government, conservation organizations, and local communities is far from done. We’ve just begun to make progress on restoration projects for the areas impacted by the MRGO. In fact, no funding has been allocated to implement the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (Corps) MRGO ecosystem restoration plan, despite Congressional calls for action after Katrina. The prioritization of restoration is critical, not only to protect communities with a healthy coastal buffer, but also to allow recovery within communities still reeling from the catastrophe of the Federal shipping channel.\n\nTitle: COVID-19: The New Orleans Response & Current Status\n\nPresenters: Jennifer Avegno, MD (Director, City of New Orleans Health Department)\"\n\nDescription: \"In this session, the city’s Public Health Director, Dr. Avegno, reviews the City's fight against the pandemic, basics about the virus, current treatments and interventions, and what comes next.\n\nTitle: New Orleans Community Voice: A Health Action Learning Plan Initiative\n\nPresenters: Arthur Johnson (Executive Director, Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development); Torrie Harris, PhD, MPH (Health & Equity Strategist, New Orleans Health Department); Daphne Ferdinand, PhD, RN (Executive Director, Healthy Heart Community Prevention Project); Catherine Haywood (Executive Director, Louisiana Community Health Outreach Network)\"\n\nDescription: \"This session will describe an action learning initiative focused on designing and sustaining healthy communities in an effort to: build stronger resident engagement, create relationships and connections, bring together community action for a more powerful voice and establishment of a coalition network of public, private, and community partners in order to identify and address specific health outcomes, health factors and relevant policies and programs for more sustainable neighborhoods in the city of New Orleans.\n\nTitle: Organizing Your Neighborhood Digitally\n\nPresenters: Kathryn M.

This session will present an overview of how the City of New Orleans views violent injury from a health lens, new programs and approaches, and perspectives from those on the ground fighting to interrupt violence in our neighborhoods.\n\nTitle: Leveraging Technology to Enhance Public Safety: New Orleans’ Real-Time Crime Center and You\n\nPresenters: Ross J.

This inequity threatens the City’s ability to fully recover and grow to its full capacity and promise. Because of these inequities we must ask the critical question with a sense of urgency: How can City government begin to understand and address equity in our city in a data-driven, strategic manner? In this session, participants will have the opportunity to learn more about the EquityNewOrleans initiative, hear from a panel of City leaders about the equitable work the City is currently doing and learn about upcoming opportunities to advance equity for all New Orleanians. After the panel, participants will have the opportunity to workshop and share their own vision of an equitable government.\n\nBuilding Leadership and Systems to Strengthen Neighborhood Resilience\n\nTaught by Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement & Development\n\nWhile the city works to grow and diversify its economy across sectors, billions of dollars are committed to investments in environment and infrastructure. Plans like the state's Coastal Comprehensive Master Plan and the city's Urban Water Plan provide thoughtful frameworks for guiding investments. However, there are questions facing New Orleans neighborhoods and communities on how these systems will impact residents. This track will examine how these relationships will benefit local communities, impact civic-engagement infrastructure and work across all sectors--public, private and nonprofit--to capture leanings from these processes and adapt accordingly. Discussions related to Flood Maps, Sea-Rise, Environmental Justice, youth programs and community-engagement opportunities with the New Orleans Port will be explored.\n\nEmerging Neighborhood Trends that Impact Housing\n\nTaught by HousingNOLA\n\nIn New Orleans, there is now a sense of urgency around the issues of equity, displacement, and the right of self-determination for neighborhoods. HousingNOLA is a 10-year partnership between the community leaders and dozens of public, private, and nonprofit organizations working to solve New Orleans’ affordable housing crisis. In September 2016, HousingNOLA released its first Annual Report Card, which provided an honest assessment of citywide efforts to address housing issues since the release of the HousingNOLA Preliminary Report in August 2015. As part of the process, HousingNOLA designed Neighborhood Typologies to track neighborhood change and assist with housing policy and funding choices by grouping neighborhoods with similar conditions. Participants will review the neighborhood typologies and discuss the specific policy interventions for each of the five kinds of neighborhoods.\n\nLeading in Challenging Times: Strategies for Engaging Complex Systems\n\nTaught by Neighborhoods Partnership Network\n\nWhen times are great, everyone’s a hero. When times are tough, great leaders step forward. This workshop is intended for participants in key leadership positions. How does a leader inspire others not to give up; to go to that next meeting; to provide input to that new plan; to convene that next gathering? This workshop will be highly interactive, incorporating the current landscape and situation and seeking individual solutions to individual challenges.\n\nPrinciples, Practices, and Strategies for Equitable Community Development\n\nTaught by Central City Renaissance Alliance\n\nThis course is designed to offer a theoretical basis and practical application of community economic development. Participants will become familiar with basic concepts and terms.
