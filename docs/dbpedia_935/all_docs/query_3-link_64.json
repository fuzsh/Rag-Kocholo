        "text": "Sign up to be a Poll Worker!\n\nPoll workers are essential to ensure elections are a success. During each election, millions of Americans dedicate themselves to sustaining the backbone of democracy - our election process. The EAC encourages those interested in becoming poll workers at the polls on Election Day to learn more about what is required and how to sign up to work with your local election office.\n\nClick here for Poll Worker Resources for Election Officials\n\nWhat is a poll worker? Why should I sign up?\n\nPoll workers are critical to the success of an election. Having an adequate number of poll workers to staff polling places on and before Election Day can ensure voters receive the assistance they need at the polls and can help provide a positive and smooth voting experience for all. By signing up to be a poll worker, you can Help America Vote.\n\nWhile specific duties and compensation vary depending on location, poll workers are the face of the election office during voting. Most jurisdictions task election workers with setting up and preparing the polling location, welcoming voters, verifying voter registrations, and issuing ballots. Poll workers also help ensure voters understand the voting process by demonstrating how to use voting equipment and explaining voting procedures.\n\nPoll Worker Recruitment Lookup Tool\n\nPlease use the lookup tool below to find information on being a poll worker in your community, including requirements, hours, pay, training, and more. Links are provided so you can sign up directly with your state or local election office. The EAC does not retain your personal information.\n\nSign up with the Lookup Tool below!\n\nIf you are an election official, and the information for your jurisdiction needs to be updated, please email the EAC at [email protected].\n\nIf you are interested in signing up, or have signed up, to be a poll worker but haven't heard from your local election office please be aware that some jurisdictions have enough volunteers and others do not. Please be patient as they may still need your help and need some extra time to respond to you as election officials are working diligently to prepare for upcoming elections.\n\nWant to make sure you are prepared?\n\nThe Poll Worker Preparedness Checklist is designed to assist poll workers as they prepare for Election Day. The checklist can help poll workers feel ready for Election Day and make them feel more confident as they prepare to serve their community.\n\nGet started and find out if you are eligible. Go to the State Compendium of Election Worker Laws and Statutes.\n\nFind out if you must be a registered voter in the state.\n\nFind out if there is an age requirement.\n\nFind out if there is a residency requirement.\n\nFind out if a political party affiliation is required.\n\nAbout National Poll Worker Recruitment Day\n\nEstablished in 2020 by the EAC, National Poll Worker Recruitment Day is a day of action with the goal of encouraging potential poll workers to sign up to Help America Vote. As a part of the agency's ongoing commitment to this important issue, the EAC also created Help America Vote in 2022 to address the needs of election officials.\n\nBy encouraging more people to become poll workers in their communities, National Poll Worker Recruitment Day aims to address the critical shortage of poll workers, strengthen our democracy, inspire greater civic engagement and volunteerism, and help ensure free and fair elections in November and beyond.\n\nHow to get involved with National Poll Worker Recruitment Day\n\nState and local election officials can use National Poll Worker Recruitment Day to kick off recruitment efforts or supplement ongoing recruiting for poll workers in their community.
