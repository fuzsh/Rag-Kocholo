California Calls, PICO California and USC PERE have joined forces to expand integrated voter engagement into new communities across the state.\n\nOver the last year, our organizations have worked closely with over 50 of the California Endowment’s Building Healthy Community (BHC) groups in areas of the state experiencing rapid demographic changes from conservative strongholds to communities with a large concentration of young, immigrant, African American, Asian and Latino populations.\n\nBased on the growing interest in integrated voter engagement by BHC, six groups were chosen to receive support with building their voter engagement capacity: Community Water Center, Fathers and Families of San Joaquin, Hmong Innovating Politics, Khmer Girls in Action, Latino Health Access and Mid-City CAN.\n\nWorking with these groups, California Calls and PICO California will design and implement a multi-year capacity building program that will include training on integrated voter engagement including data management and analysis, technical assistance, and planning and implementing a series of actual voter engagement programs.\n\nThe first civic engagement programs with the BHC Project will launch in the fall of 2017 around issues including youth services, environmental justice, health education and farmworker empowerment.\n\nThis project concluded in 2020."
