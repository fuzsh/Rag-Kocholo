Walz will be an excellent partner for Vice President Harris to protect abortion and reproductive health care and help pass a people-first agenda that will uplift communities and our futures, just as he has in Minnesota.\n\nJoin us as we continue to mobilize against Project 2025 and MAGA!\n\nIt’s official: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is Kamala Harris’s running mate! Show your support with a free sticker!\n\nJoin us as we continue to mobilize this election season and encourage people to vote for a democracy where everyone can thrive. Together, we can defeat MAGA and Project 2025 at the ballot box!\n\nMoveOn members have voted to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president! Harris is a groundbreaking leader who can and will carry us to victory. She has spent her career fighting for each and every person in this country.\n\n2024 has proven to be a historic election year. President Biden has made a tremendous personal sacrifice to preserve our democracy. Now we look back on Vice President Harris’s career fighting for progressive values and the rights of every American, and look forward to making history with her in November."
