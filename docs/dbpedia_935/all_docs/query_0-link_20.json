I think y’all did amazingly for a two day workshop. Of course there will always be more to cover. I like that we are already applying what we learned by writing a letter to city council together, I think the model should be learn, apply, discover and learn again. With that said, I would like to dive deeper into who our political reps are and what their passionate about and how we can align our needs with solutions to the problems that they’re trying to solve.\" - 2024 PACE cohort member\n\nCURRICULUM\n\nWe partner with community organizations to create and deliver lessons that address the specific challenges and needs of Indigenous, Black, Latinx, and Asian & Pacific Islander communities for getting involved in civic activities.
