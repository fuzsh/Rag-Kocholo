Special attention will be paid to the intercultural aspects of community practice, particularly looking at race, class, and gender.\n\nUEP 0293-05 Legalized Marijuana: Planning, Policy & The Law. (2 Credits) This two credit module will review the United States' tortured history of regulating Cannabis sativa (marijuana) and current efforts of the respective states, in defiance of federal law and the supremacy doctrine, to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. We will discuss the federal government's current and past \"marijuana policy\", the economic benefits and impacts of legalization and the approaches taken by other countries, most notably Canada, to foster a regulated marijuana industry. We will discuss the relationship between \"recreational marijuana\" and \"medical marijuana\" and review relevant provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (e.g., 21 U.S.C §812) wherein marijuana is classified as having a \"high potential for abuse\" and \"has no accepted medical use in treatment in the United States\" on par with heroin and LSD.\n\nUEP 0293-07 Revisioning Cities: Ethnography for Policy and Planning. (3 Credits) This research seminar introduces students to the craft of ethnography and explores how qualitative, embedded, and socially committed research can critically and constructively intervene in contemporary urban problems. We read both classic and cutting-edge ethnographic texts on topics like addiction, eviction, violence, insecurity, informal markets, participatory planning, and urban social movements. At the same time, students will experiment with different ethnographic and qualitative research methods – including ethnographic and participant observation, in-depth interviewing, material culture analysis, and archival, discourse and media analysis – as they design and execute their own original research projects. Ultimately, our goal in this class is to use ethnographic methods and modes of analysis to attend to the world differently, and to theorize how these new vantages and alternative perspectives might contribute to creating more just policies and urban spaces. This elective will also serve as valuable preparation for students planning to conduct qualitative thesis research.\n\nUEP 0293-09 Practicum. (3 Credits) The Community Practicum brings graduate students and community practitioners together to learn and conduct joint projects on critical issues to advance more just, democratic, and sustainable cities. Each Practicum is co-designed with UEP's Co-Education/Co-Research (CORE) community partners. The Fall 2019 Practicum's overall theme is Building Community Controlled Economies in Boston. It will work with community partners to learn about and advance strategies for community control over land, housing, commercial development, and the food economy. While some of the Practicum will be in the classroom, there will also be sessions in community locations (possibly at alternate times).\n\nUEP 0293-15 Corporate Social Responsibility. What is the behavior that we—as consumers, community members, employees, and future leaders—expect from corporations, and how do we hold them accountable? What is it like work in the field of CSR? Students will take on various perspectives, from consumer to CSR professional, to examine the impact of corporations on issues such as water, energy, pollution, waste, human rights, and worker wellbeing. Throughout the semester, we will explore corporate structures and emerging business models, codes of conduct, transparency & accountability, the social & environmental impact of global supply chains, regulatory & voluntary frameworks, reporting, strategy & communication, and technology as a driver for change. Projects and assignments will mimic the tasks a CSR professional would take on in a corporate or consulting context. Material will often pull from the apparel industry, but students will have the flexibility to explore the issues and industries that most interest them.\n\nUEP 0293-17 Greenhouse Gas Management.

This course explores how solidarity economy movements are emerging and building towards post-capitalist futures in Boston, Massachusetts, and beyond. Solidarity economy (SE) is a set of theories and practices that aspire towards a more democratic, just, and sustainable world. SE frames economy broadly, as all the ways that humans meet our material needs and care for each other. SE can describe a coherent alternative economic system that would replace capitalism or refer to cooperative economic practices that already and always have existed. SE movements exist throughout the world but are most well established in Latin America, Canada, and Europe. SE practices include cooperatives of all kinds, participatory budgeting, fair trade, community land trusts (CLTs), mutual associations, community banks, alternative currencies, time banks, and more. Students will engage with SE movement organizations and practitioners in class projects. Various sessions of the course will also be open to practitioners and community partners.\n\nUEP 0294-xx Effective Organizations.

(3 Credits) A survey course on the financial operations of local government. Focus on the concepts, techniques and law relating to municipal finance. Detailed analysis of the tools available to local governments as they seek to raise revenues for the provision of traditional services, including the property tax and fees (user and regulatory), but with emphasis on \"new\" strategies such as impact fees and development agreements. Discussion of trends toward \"privatization\" and the legal implications of transferring traditional municipal obligations to the private sector. Discussion of the policy implications found in \"tax cap\" states such as California and Massachusetts.\n\nUEP 0294-14 Sharing Cities, Smart Cities, and Social Innovation. (3 Credits) How can cities, where the majority of the world’s people now live, become more socially just, more environmentally sustainable, smarter and more socially innovative? This class will look into the reinvention and revival of one of our most basic human traits: sharing. It will look at the growth of the sharing economy as a largely transactional activity while presenting a more relational (social, cultural, and political) alternative through communal models of sharing that build solidarity and spread trust. Focusing on the role of cities in urban policy and planning, it will demonstrate how, with smart technologies and social innovation, the intersection of urban space and cyberspace can provide an unrivaled platform for more just, inclusive, and environmentally efficient economies and societies rooted in a rediscovery of the urban commons and a sharing culture. Case studies will be drawn from around the world.\n\nUEP 0294-18 Jobs that Work. (3 Credits) Why is it that people either have too little work to make a living or too much work to have a life? And why is it so rare for that work to be part of a gratifying life for individual workers, their families, and their communities? This course will investigate these questions and interventions to address them by drawing from two fields that are typically considered separately. The workforce development field tends to focus on low-wage workers and government sponsored policies. In contrast, those concerned about the challenges of work-life balance tend to focus on salaried, professional workers and interventions generally consist of practices adopted in private sector firms for their employees. The current economic crisis is an opportune setting for this inquiry. On the one hand, it exacerbates the social, urban, and environmental impact of ongoing trends in employment and wages, the organization of labor and corporations, and frictions between work life and home and civic life. It also highlights the limitations of contemporary policy and planning strategies for contending with these challenges. On the other hand, the crisis presents an opportunity to entertain new questions and new solutions – the intended product of this course.\n\nUEP 0294-19 Equity and Inequity and Inclusion. (3 Credits) Research shows that more diverse and inclusive workplaces consistently out-perform their counterparts that do not have such a focus. In this two-credit seminar, students will learn why making space for diversity, equity and inclusion in the culture of their organizations is a just imperative with many organizational benefits. Materials and case studies will help to create a framework which leads with equity which will enable students to create their own strategies for making a way for this important focus in their organizations.\n\nUEP 0294-24 Housing and Inequality. (3 Credits) This course explores the multidimensional relationship between housing and inequality in the United States. It begins by providing a conceptual framework for understanding inequality and evidence on recent trends. Next, we will examine the various ways that inequality is manifest through housing, including issues related to affordability, neighborhood conditions, and segregation. Finally, we will study government interventions to address housing inequality for low-income groups and critically analyze their successes and failures.\n\nUEP 0294-26 Global Urban Developments. (3 Credits) This seminar invites students to develop a more expansive understanding of \"urban development\" by exploring the development trajectories of cities around the world and how diverse world cities are coping with problems that are \"global\" in nature (e.g. climate change, displacement, real estate speculation). Drawing on critical urban theory and ethnographic case studies from urban spaces in the Global North and South, as well as from sites that defy such geographies, we investigate topics including: informal housing, spatial segregation, water and energy infrastructure, transportation innovations, coping with climate change, migrant and refugee relocations, and emergent forms of governance and social mobilization. This course is designed for graduate students or advanced undergraduates pursuing research and policy careers that look beyond the US, and for those eager to learn new paradigms we might use to resolve problems at home.\n\nUEP 0294-28 Qualitative GIS. (3 Credits) Mixed-method, critical, and qualitative approaches and applications of GIS will be considered through readings, seminar discussions, and applied laboratory activities.
