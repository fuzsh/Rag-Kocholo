These initiatives encompass a broad spectrum of strategies, including early intervention, educational support, mentoring, and conflict resolution.

We're looking to learn and share more with others who are working on related issues. Here, too, is a post that explores more and an opportunity to connect with us: https://lnkd.in/gvNqAYWx\n\ndo you have what it takes?...building capacity for Latino-led organizations that serve the growing Latino population in Maryland is a gap that needs lots of attention in different fields. At Maryland Latinos Unidos we talk and do a lot about building pathways for and with Latinos in Maryland. Like my colleague Gabriela D. Lemus, Ph.D. Executive Director at MLU says, \"juntos podemos más\". what does it mean to build capacity? To answer this question and join forces, check out the advocacy conversations to discuss priorities for Latinos in Maryland in the \"People's Issues Priorities Series\" https://lnkd.in/dBEK9Cbm Latinos are an economic power for Maryland so I joined the MLU steering committee with Centro SOL to bring awareness of infrastructural barriers Latinos encounter in building their businesses and organizations. #latinosunidos #representationmatters #advocacy\n\n(Draft) Inverclyde Community Justice Outcomes Improvement Plan 2024 Last week Inverclyde Community Justice Partnership published its draft Community Justice Outcomes Improvement Plan. This plan initially commenced following publication of the National Strategy for Community Justice in 2022 and developed throughout 2023. The CJOIP has five priority outcomes reflecting the four nationally determined outcomes and a locally determined outcome around housing and homelessness outcomes for those in the justice system. The document outlines progress from the previous CJOIP published in 2015, an analysis of community justice locally and action underway by the Partnership to meet the priority aims. Regarding the priority outcomes a range of proposed actions are included over the next few years. The document has now moved into an engagement phase until mid-March. There is a consultation survey for groups and individuals locally, a planned week of engagement with the third sector, engagement with individuals who have lived/living experience of the justice system and a number of staff engagement sessions from across the Partnership and beyond. The draft CJOIP and consultation survey are available via https://lnkd.in/ep_DHFH9 EDITED COMMENT. The idea of this post is to generate discussion if anyone wants to ask/comment/respond to anything."
