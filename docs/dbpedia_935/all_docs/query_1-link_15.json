But the organization needed help creating a bridge between its existing impact and its full potential.\n\nThat’s where our Fiscal Sponsorship program came in.\n\nWHAT THEY NEEDED\n\nWhen MCC first came to us over nine years ago, it was an easy partnership from the get-go. They were looking for a partner that would allow them to grow in the ways they needed, while we sought to empower a growing, impactful community-based organization. MCC transferred to Mission Edge from a different fiscal sponsor, so they also needed a financial partner to help them meet their goals: something we were well-poised to do.\n\nWhere mission edge came in\n\nWe partnered with Mid-City CAN as a comprehensive fiscal sponsorship partner by providing them with a variety of services including Accounting, Human Resources and a 501(c)(3) structure to operate within.\n\nIn doing so, we helped MCC continue to grow autonomously while still taking advantage of our resources and expertise."
