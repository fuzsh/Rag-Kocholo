        "text": "Our Goal:\n\nLethbridge is experiencing a shortage of family physicians, nurses and paramedics leaving many residents unattached to a physician and limiting their access to primary care. We recognize this need and the pressure it puts on other healthcare resources as residents seek the care they need. At the City of Lethbridge, we are supporting the work being done by AHS South Zone and their allied partners, such as the Chinook Primary Care Network.\n\nThe Facts:\n\nIn 2021, there were approximately 25,000 – 30,000 Lethbridge residents who were without a family doctor.\n\nLethbridge City Council approved a physician shortage action plan, which provides a response to Lethbridge residents who may be without a family physician in Lethbridge.\n\nThe City is participating on the Southern Alberta Medical Program (SAMP) Working Group that is working to build the framework to train physicians locally.\n\nIf you have questions or would like more information on our advocacy efforts, you can call or chat with 311 Monday - Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nAlternatively, the Mayor and Members of Council welcome written feedback with any comments, issues, or concerns through the online form below.\n\nThe City of Lethbridge acknowledges that we are gathered on the lands of the Blackfoot people of the Canadian Plains and pays respect to the Blackfoot people past, present and future while recognizing and respecting their cultural heritage, beliefs and relationship to the land. The City of Lethbridge is also home to the Métis Nation of Alberta, Region III."
