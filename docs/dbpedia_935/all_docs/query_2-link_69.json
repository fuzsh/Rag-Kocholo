        "text": "RPS Legislative Advocacy Update - February 20, 2024\n\nGreetings RPS advocates! This advocacy update is full of great news regarding the state budget. On Sunday, February 18, the House Appropriations Committee and Senate Finance & Appropriations Committee released their respective proposals for changes to the state budget. These proposals were the focus of our advocacy over the last two months following Governor Youngkin‚Äôs budget proposal that he released in December.\n\nBoth the House and Senate budgets have proposed significant additional investment in K-12 education to support local school divisions across the state. The House proposed about $1 billion in additional funding and the Senate proposed about $1.6 billion in additional funding. The Senate budget is more favorable, both due to it being a larger investment but also due to the inclusion of more programs that support RPS.\n\nIn the House budget, RPS can expect approximately $10.4 million more than anticipated from the Governor‚Äôs proposed budget. In the Senate budget, we would expect approximately $14.3 million more than anticipated from the Governor‚Äôs budget.\n\nWhile there has been much discussion of the 2023 report from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) and their recommendations to the legislature, most of the JLARC recommendations were not included in either budget proposal. There is a joint committee being established through a resolution to further consider the JLARC recommendations before the next session.\n\nWe are very excited to see both the House and Senate propose reforms and greater investment in the At-Risk Add-On program based on the JLARC recommendations. The At-Risk Add-On program is the state‚Äôs funding program that supports school divisions with high concentrations of economically disadvantaged students. The proposed changes will infuse almost $400 million in new funding into this program and support many RPS students. This is a huge win to making public education funding more equitable and we are grateful to the House and Senate for advancing these proposals.\n\nBelow are some of the additional highlights of the House and Senate budget reports.\n\nHouse Budget Details\n\nApproximately $1 billion in new K-12 public education funding. RPS would receive approximately $10.4 million more than anticipated under Governor Youngkin‚Äôs introduced budget.\n\n$628.2 million to implement a four-year plan to bring the Commonwealth‚Äôs teacher pay to beyond the national average by providing two 3 3/8 percent pay increases, at the start of each fiscal year.\n\n$384.6 million to comprehensively and strategically reform the way the state provides funding to support these At-Risk students by using up to date data and increasing the size of this fund by over 30 percent.\n\n$95.1 million over the biennium to shift to a teacher-to-staff ratio based on the level of English each student has mastered (this is a major win, RPS first requested this legislation in 2020).\n\nSenate Budget Details\n\nApproximately $1.6 billion in new K-12 public education funding. RPS would receive approximately $14.3 million more than anticipated under Governor Youngkin‚Äôs introduced budget.\n\n$402.0 million to provide a 3 percent salary increase each year.\n\nApproximately $395 million increase in At-Risk Add-On funding.\n\n$26.7 million to increase the English Learner teacher ratio from 20 to 22 per 1000 students.\n\n$400.6 million to fully remove the cap on support positions that was implemented during the Great Recession.\n\n$243.1 million to restore the grocery sales tax supplemental payments that the Governor removed.\n\n$400 million from the Literary Fund for construction loans.\n\nNow that each chamber has proposed a budget, a conference committee of members from the House and Senate will be organized to negotiate their differences and prepare a conference report that all 140 members of the General Assembly will vote on. If both chambers pass the budget conference report, it will be sent to Governor Youngkin for his approval or veto.\n\nA more detailed update will be provided to the School Board at their March 4 School Board Meeting. If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact me at mstanley@rvaschools.net.\n\nüö®What can you do today? üö®\n\nWe are grateful for the House and Senate budget proposals and encourage everyone to email legislators to thank them for their advocacy and investment in K-12 education. There is still negotiating that will occur between the House and Senate so let‚Äôs keep up the momentum and encourage them to pass the best possible budget for our schools.\n\nIf you previously contacted any legislators this session, please send them a follow up thank you email. Otherwise, please contact your own legislators to thank them as your representatives (you can identify your legislators by using this map tool). Here is a sample email that you can copy, paste, and modify with your own personal message:\n\nDear XXX,\n\nI am thrilled to see the House and Senate prioritize our students, staff, and schools by committing significant new funding towards K-12 education. Thank you for your advocacy and all of your efforts to introduce legislation and convey the importance of this topic to members of the appropriations committees. As you and your colleagues work to negotiate a final budget, we ask you to pass the best possible budget for our schools. Thank you again for all of your efforts.\n\nSincerely,\n\nXXX\n\nLooking Ahead üóìÔ∏è\n\nHere are some key upcoming opportunities and dates to add to your calendar:\n\nTomorrow, Wednesday, February 21 at 11 am - The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis is hosting a ‚ÄúVirginia Budget Breakdown‚Äù webinar to learn more about key differences in the House and Senate budgets in the areas of K-12 education, health care, tax choices that impact our ability to invest in our shared priorities, and more. Register here!\n\nMarch 9 - Adjournment Sine Die - this is the last scheduled day of the 2024 Regular Session\n\nRPS Legislative Advocacy Update - February 15, 2024\n\nHello and happy Crossover! On Tuesday, February 13, the General Assembly passed the mid-point in their session where no new legislation can be introduced and anything that has not already passed the House or Senate can no longer be considered. In addition to the many bills that have crossed over to the other chamber, the House and Senate will release their budget proposals this coming Sunday, February 18. Stay tuned next week for a budget update comparing the House and Senate proposals.\n\nOver the next two weeks, legislators will be making critical final decisions on what bills to pass on to the Governor and what to put into their final budget so we need all of RPS to do a final advocacy push now! We encourage everyone to attend the Fund Our Schools rally for school funding on President‚Äôs Day, Monday, February 19, 2024. The rally will be held at 1pm on Capitol Square, be sure to join us and wear red! For more information and to RSVP, please visit the VEA‚Äôs website or the Fund Our Schools registration form.\n\nRPS students and staff have been advocating for the 2024 RPS Legislative Priorities! Llast week, two groups had the honor of visiting with legislators and being introduced on the floor of the House and Senate! We encourage everyone in the RPS community to visit the legislature and advocate for funding our schools. If you are interested in organizing a trip to the Capitol, please contact me at mstanley@rvaschools.net.\n\nBudget Updates üíµ\n\nThe House and Senate will release their budget proposals on Sunday, February 18 and we will have an update early next week with a comparison of what is included. We are hearing that both chambers are making significant investments in public education and are excited to dig in!\n\nHighlighted Legislation üìÉ\n\nWe are very excited that many of our legislative priorities have been favorably considered by the House and the Senate. To view a list of bills that we support, view this report from the Legislative Information System. Each bill number is linked to more information about the legislation.\n\nThe Commonwealth Institue for Fiscal Analysis (TCI) is a non-profit that advances racial and economic justice in Virginia by advocating for public policies that are designed in partnership with people most impacted, and shaped by credible, accessible fiscal and policy research. Here is an update on legislation they are advocating for this year that would provide more state support for community schools:\n\nBills to expand access to comprehensive services through the community school model advanced in both the House and Senate this week. Community schools offer a holistic model for providing essential services to families ‚Äî such as mental and physical health services, nutrition and housing support, tutoring and expanded learning time, family engagement, and community collaboration ‚Äî so that children are able to focus on learning and not on other pressing needs. SB608 and HB625 as amended by the respective ‚Äúmoney committees‚Äù will establish a state Office of Community Schools to provide technical assistance and coordination and outline the structure for development and implementation grants for local school divisions, with a focus on high-poverty schools. Funding for the development and implementation grants will still need to be provided in the budget. Supporting the development and continuation of community schools was a major priority for TCI and the Fund Our Schools coalition this year, and support for these bills in both chambers is a welcome development.\n\nTo help advocate for this legislation, check out their Take Action tool to contact your legislators!\n\nüö®What can you do today? üö®\n\nWe need as many students, families, community members, and staff as possible to come out to the Fund Our Schools rally on Capitol Square on MONDAY (President‚Äôs Day). Your presence will show legislators how important this topic is for our schools. Please RSVP to attend and join us at the Fund Our Schools lobby day and rally on Monday, February 19!\n\nLooking Ahead üóìÔ∏è\n\nHere are some key upcoming opportunities and dates to add to your calendar:\n\nFebruary 18 - House and Senate publish their budget proposals\n\nFebruary 19 - RSVP for the Fund Our Schools Rally and Lobby Day\n\nLobbying: 8:30 am, meet at St. Paul's Episcopal Church (815 E Grace St, Richmond, VA 23219)\n\nRally: 1pm-2 pm, Bell Tower at Virginia State Capitol, Richmond (101 N 9th St, Richmond, VA 23219)\n\nMarch 9 - Adjournment Sine Die - this is the last scheduled day of the 2024 Regular Session\n\nRPS Legislative Advocacy Update - February 5, 2024\n\nHello and thanks for being a part of RPS advocacy efforts during the 2024 Virginia General Assembly. Complete the Google Form on this page if you would like to receive these updates in your inbox!\n\nThe Virginia General Assembly is in full swing considering over 2600 pieces of legislation and hundreds of budget amendments. Committees are meeting consistently and advancing legislation towards floor votes and consideration by the other chamber. Committee meetings are open to the public and the schedule may be found on the Legislative Information System website. You can also livestream their daily floor sessions from the Virginia Assembly website (click the drop down + at the top of the page).\n\nTonight, I am presenting a more detailed update on the legislative session at the School Board meeting. Tune in via YouTube to watch - the meeting starts at 6pm and I will be presenting later in the agenda.\n\nOn Wednesday this week, RPS will be hosting an advocacy day to visit members of the General Assembly from 9am to 1pm. To RSVP, please email Matthew Stanley at mstanley@rvaschools.net and additional information will be provided.\n\nBudget Updates üíµ\n\nOf the $15+ billion in amendments introduced by legislators in the public education section of the budget, Richmond legislators introduced over $3 billion in amendments addressing RPS priorities. We are grateful to the Richmond legislative delegation and many others for their support of public education funding reform. Here is a Google Sheet with all of the budget amendments that we support.\n\nThe recent Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) reports on Virginia‚Äôs K-12 Funding Formula and Virginia‚Äôs K-12 Teacher Pipeline have spurred legislation and budget amendments incorporating many of their recommendations. The House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over education policy have begun vetting the bills before referring anything with a fiscal impact to the House Appropriations Committee or Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee. These two budget committees will likely hold them in the committee as they prepare their respective budget proposals.\n\nWhile many of the JLARC recommendations have been introduced this year, the legislature is also considering next steps on JLARC‚Äôs longer-term recommendations, including the transition to a student-based funding model instead of a staffing-based funding model. Click here to watch video of the hearing of the legislation creating a new Joint Committee to recommend next steps to the legislature.\n\nHighlighted Legislation üìÉ\n\nRPS partner Greater Richmond Fit4Kids has been championing legislation (HB 937) that would help encourage innovative alternatives to school buses for student transportation, including walking and biking school buses. The bill has passed the House Education and House Appropriations Committees and will likely be voted on by the full House of Delegates tomorrow!\n\nIf you would like to advocate for this legislation, contact members of the General Assembly via email or phone. Here is some sample language but please feel free to personalize your own message!\n\nPlease vote YES on Delegate Destiny LeVere Bolling's HB 937, to encourage the implementation of innovative low-cost or no-cost transportation alternatives for students, including organizing and facilitating biking or walking school buses. If passed, this bill would give school districts more flexibility to support, organize, and facilitate biking and walking school buses for students.\n\nWalking and Biking School buses help encourage students to learn and practice pedestrian safety, reduce chronic absenteeism for students, and promote daily physical activity, helping students arrive on time to school safely and ready to learn. Investing in active transportation has health and safety benefits for students, as well as benefits that extend to the whole community.\n\nPlease vote YES when HB 937 comes to you for a vote, and thank you for reading!\n\nThank you Greater Richmond Fit4Kids for advocating on this important topic! Contact Justine Blincoe, Policy Director, at justine@grfit4kids.org if you would like any more information or want to get involved.\n\nüö®What can you do today? üö®\n\nContact legislators to ask them to prioritize public education funding in the budget! Check out our form letter templates for examples of what to ask legislators when emailing or calling their offices. Key legislators serving on the budget committees should be prioritized, see slides 15-16 for a listing of key contacts.\n\nRSVP to attend the Fund Our Schools lobby day and rally on Monday, February 19.\n\nLooking Ahead üóìÔ∏è\n\nHere are some key upcoming opportunities and dates to add to your calendar:\n\nFebruary 6 & 9 - ‚ÄòFund Our Schools‚Äô Advocacy Training\n\nTuesday, February 6 at 6pm\n\nClick here to join Zoom Meeting\n\nMeeting ID: 811 4688 9103\n\nPasscode: 280899\n\nFriday, February 9 at 11:30am\n\nClick here to join Zoom Meeting\n\nMeeting ID: 851 9390 2400\n\nPasscode: 779109\n\nFebruary 7 - RPS Advocacy Day including a legislative briefing and visits with legislators\n\nRSVP by emailing Matthew Stanley at mstanley@rvaschools.net\n\nFebruary 18 - House and Senate publish their budget proposals\n\nFebruary 19 - RSVP for the Fund Our Schools Rally and Lobby Day\n\nLobbying: 8:30 am, meet at St. Paul's Episcopal Church (815 E Grace St, Richmond, VA 23219)\n\nRally: 1pm-2 pm, Bell Tower at Virginia State Capitol, Richmond (101 N 9th St, Richmond, VA 23219)"
