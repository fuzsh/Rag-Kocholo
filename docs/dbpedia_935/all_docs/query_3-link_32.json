        "text": "Civil liberties protect people from undue government interference or action. Civil rights, on the other hand, protect people from discrimination. It is DoD policy to prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, mental or physical disability, or age.\n\nAlthough civil liberties and civil rights are different, they can overlap, especially with issues involving religion and free speech. For example, a civil rights complaint involving religious discrimination in the workplace could also involve the First Amendment right of freedom of religion if an employee was wrongly prevented from exercising his or her religion.\n\nFor information on how to report an alleged civil rights violation, visit EEO, the Equal Employment Opportunity division of the DoD Office of the Inspector General. If you are a service member, contact a Military Equal Opportunity (MEO) Office.\n\nYes. Civil liberties protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of service members. However, service members must exercise their civil liberties in a manner consistent with good order and discipline. This means a military commander may lawfully limit the exercise of civil liberties, such as free speech, for service members. For example, there are restrictions on service members' partisan political activities.\n\nActive duty service members can:\n\nVote\n\nContribute to political campaigns\n\nDisplay political bumper stickers on their personal vehicles\n\nActive duty service members cannot:\n\nSpeak at a partisan gathering or participate in any radio or tv programs or organized blog discussions that advocate for or against a political party, candidate, or cause\n\nAttend political events as an official representative of the Armed Forces unless authorized by the Service Secretary concerned\n\nSeek nomination or candidacy for civil office (with limited exceptions)\n\nClick here to view some of the DoD Issuances that provide guidance for how service members may exercise their civil liberties.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission saw the need to make sure that privacy and civil liberties are adequately protected, and included recommendations for doing so in its report. Congress put these recommendations into law, which requires DoD and seven other federal agencies to properly safeguard privacy and civil liberties.\n\nIn order to comply with the law, DoD's Civil Liberties Officer established the DoD Civil Liberties Program and combined it with the longstanding DoD Privacy Program to create the Defense Privacy, and Civil Liberties, and Transparency Division (DPCLTD). You can check out the formal policy for the DoD Civil Liberties Program here.\n\nYes. The governing law specifically provides that no actions of reprisal or threats of reprisal shall be taken by any federal employee against individuals who make complaints or disclose information that indicates a possible violation of privacy protections or civil liberties in the administration of the programs and operations of the Federal Government, unless the complaint was made or the information was disclosed with the knowledge that it was false or with willful disregard for its truth or falsity.\n\nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) is an independent agency within the executive branch of government. The board has four members and one chairman, each appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The purpose of the board is to review the actions the executive branch takes to protect the Nation from terrorism and to make sure that the need for those actions is balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties. The board also makes sure that civil liberties concerns are appropriately considered in the development and implementation of laws, regulations, and policies related to efforts to protect the nation against terrorism.
