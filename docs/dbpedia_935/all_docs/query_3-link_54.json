        "text": "What Is a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)?\n\nA non-governmental organization (NGO) is a group that functions independently of any government with the objective of improving social conditions. NGOs are typically non-profit institutions. They are sometimes called civil society organizations and are established on community, national, and international levels to serve a social or political goal such as a humanitarian cause or the protection of the environment.\n\nFor example, NGOs might focus on activities in areas involving health or health emergencies, education, infrastructure, advocacy of minority rights, support of the poor, and the reduction of crime.\n\nTypes of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)\n\nThe term NGO is generally accepted to refer to usually non-profit, private organizations that operate outside of government control. Some NGOs rely primarily on volunteers while others support a paid staff. The World Bank identifies two broad groups of NGOs:\n\nOperational NGOs, which focus on the design and implementation of development projects\n\nAdvocacy NGOs, which defend or promote a specific cause and seek to influence public policy\n\nSome NGOs may fall under both categories simultaneously. Examples of NGOs include those that support human rights, advocate for improved health, or encourage political participation.\n\nHow NGOs Work\n\nA non-governmental organization, or NGO, is an organization established by a group of individuals that wishes to pursue goals and aspirations that relate to the public, social, or political good of a nation or the world.\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, U.S. regulations were created to assist in the formation of NGOs. These regulations have no bias as to the value of any NGO or the kind of work that it does.\n\nNGOs focus on a wide range of issues and areas. These might include women's rights, the health of the environment and planet, healthcare, political advocacy, labor unions, religious faith, care of aging adults, and youth empowerment.\n\nWhile the government is not involved in the activities of NGOs, U.S. law normally regulates them via their filing of information returns that show an NGO's funding, management, and activities.\n\nForming an NGO\n\nAny group of people may form an NGO without government approval or involvement. In addition, one need not be a U.S. citizen to form an NGO in the U.S. However, should an NGO wish to obtain legal benefits such as exemption from state and federal taxes, it should incorporate and register as an NGO under the relevant laws of the state in which it's located.\n\nAn NGO doesn't have to incorporate. For instance, to form a charitable NGO, all that's required (as is for any charitable trust) is a legal contract and deed that conveys property.\n\nWhile no federal government involvement comes into play, states in the U.S. may require NGOs with religious, educational, or charitable missions that may ask for donations to register with a state charity.\n\nTax-Exempt Status\n\nTo obtain tax-exempt status, an NGO must apply to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Many types of NGOs are eligible.\n\nNon-profit NGOs organized for educational, religious, and literary purposes, or to support certain sports and scientific testing for public safety, are welcome to apply for exemption from federal income tax on all their funding. For state tax exemption, NGOs should apply to a state's tax authority.\n\nNGOs that engage in political activities may receive some tax benefits for the income they receive from the public, membership dues, and fundraising events.\n\nContributions to NGOs may be tax-deductible for donors.\n\nSome NGOs may be subject to government or IRS restrictions and rules that relate to such things as excessive compensation, lobbying beyond a limited degree, certain commercial activities, and governance.\n\nHow Are NGOs Funded?\n\nNGOs rely on a variety of sources for funding, including:\n\nMembership dues\n\nPrivate donations from individuals, private sector businesses, and philanthropic organizations\n\nThe sale of goods and services\n\nGrants\n\nFunding from foreign governments and organizations\n\nDespite their independence from governments, some NGOs rely heavily on government funding. Large NGOs may have budgets in the millions or billions of dollars.\n\nVariations of NGOs\n\nThe American Red Cross, Salvation Army, and Amnesty International are considered examples of NGOs.\n\nMany variations of the NGO acronym exist:\n\nINGO: an international NGO. For example, the Conference of INGOs of the Council of Europe is comprised of more than 300 participating INGOs.\n\nGONGO: this means government-organized NGO, often derogatory. They are generally government-backed NGOs that support repressive regimes in the international arena.\n\nQUANGO: chiefly a British term, often derogatory. A quango is a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization that relies on public funding. Its senior officials are appointed by the government.\n\nENGO: an environmental NGO, for example, Greenpeace or the World Wildlife Fund. Both groups operate internationally in addition to advocating for the environment. They are often simply referred to as NGOs.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs) seek to improve social and political problems locally, nationally, or internationally. They work outside the frame of the government, are usually not-for-profit, and can obtain tax-exempt status if they meet certain criteria."
