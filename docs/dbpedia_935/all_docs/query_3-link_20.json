        "text": "Americans’ knowledge of their government varies widely by topic. Majorities are aware of the length of Supreme Court appointments, how states’ representation in the House of Representatives is determined, which parties control the House and Senate, and one of the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\nFewer Americans correctly answer questions about the filibuster, the length of a Senate term and how a presidential election is decided in the event of a tie in the Electoral College.\n\nBefore reading further, take our U.S. civic and political knowledge quiz. For full question wording and correct answers, refer to the survey topline.\n\nThree-quarters of Americans are familiar with the length of a Supreme Court appointment. This question got the highest share of correct answers on our quiz.\n\nA clear majority (68%) also knows how the number of representatives each state gets in the House is determined.\n\nThe public also generally knows who’s in control in Congress: 66% correctly identify which party has a majority in the House and 63% know which controls the Senate.\n\nA smaller majority (57%) correctly identifies one of the rights the First Amendment guarantees, while half correctly answer what part of the government requires a 60% majority vote to end a filibuster.\n\nOn the other hand, fewer than half of Americans know the length of a full term of office for a U.S. senator (44%) or who chooses the president if there is a tie in the Electoral College (40%).\n\nPartisanship and civic knowledge\n\nRepublicans and Democrats perform about equally well on these questions.\n\nEqual shares of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and Democrats and Democratic leaners correctly answer three questions:\n\nWhich party is in control of the Senate\n\nOne of the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment\n\nWhich part of the government requires a 60% majority to end a filibuster\n\nAmong all eight items in the quiz, there is no greater than a 3 percentage point difference in the shares of Republicans and Democrats who answer correctly.\n\nAge and civic knowledge\n\nOlder Americans are generally more likely than younger adults to answer the quiz questions correctly. For instance, 88% of adults ages 65 and older know the length of a Supreme Court appointment, compared with 62% of those ages 18 to 29.\n\nHowever, older adults are somewhat less likely than younger adults to correctly answer questions about First Amendment rights and the tiebreaker for the Electoral College."
