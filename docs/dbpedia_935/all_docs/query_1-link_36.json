        "text": "Why Access Inc?\n\nInterns can choose to work with any of these programs - focusing on one program or a combination of the three. Access focuses on engagement within the community and students will be actively involved in providing resources to under-served populations in San Diego County.\n\nRequirements: There are a number of different programs, some of which require no Spanish language skills and others that do require advanced proficiency\n\nCatholic Charities- San Diego\n\nCatholic Charities Diocese of San Diego exists to exemplify the scriptural values of mercy and hospitality by Witnessing the gospel message contained in “Matthew 25:“; to advocate for a just society by Calling individuals and institutions to action on behalf of the poor, the vulnerable and the marginalized; and to acknowledge the sacredness of the human person by Accompanying those we serve on their journey toward achieving their full potential as persons created in the image and likeness of God.\n\nWhy Catholic Charities San Diego?\n\nThis is a great opportunity for anyone who is interested in helping and has the will to assist those in need. There are several areas in which an intern can be of great assistance such as helping case managers, refugees and asylum seekers in designated areas.\n\nPreferred skills: Bilingual in another language is helpful but not required.\n\nCultural Media Archive (CMA)\n\nThe Cultural Media Archive (CMA) seeks to promote dialogue between community and academy through intersectional youth centered research. The CMA will document and promote educational, visual, and charitable needs of the community, specifically by introducing cultural and educational awareness through media, charitable donations, scholarship and the production of documentary (audio, visual, and literary) materials. Interns will help collect narratives that document how first generation youth, youth of color and queer youth construct and engage notions of citizenship.\n\nWhy Cultural Media Archive?\n\nCultural Media Archive provides a multidimensional internship opportunity where interns work in a variety of different fields including documentary and audio recording, archival science, ethnographic research and public outreach. Interns benefit from hands-on experience with these methodologies as well as help expand meaningful interaction and collaboration between academe and community.\n\nExcellence and Justice in Education (EJE) Academies\n\nExcellence and Justice in Education (EJE) Academies are looking for dedicated SDSU students who are able to mentor K-8 youth at a dual-immersion (bilingual) charter school in El Cajon. This is a unique opportunity to be a part of a child’s life in an encouraging and open environment. Unlike most mentoring programs, EJE Academy aims for interns to interact with youth on-campus and outside of campus to prepare their students, through mentoring, to excel in higher education and to be leaders in creating a just global society.\n\nWhy EJE Academies?\n\nThrough this program, interns will have the opportunity to take youth on field trips, help them during school time, and be a valued mentor promoting critical thinking, effective communication and helping youth become socially responsible global citizens. Interns who are interested in becoming educators can benefit from the first hand experience of managing and assisting a classroom of students.\n\nRequirements: Students are required to attend EJE Academies at least once a week for the whole semester. Some Spanish-language skills preferred.\n\nMid-City Community Action Network (CAN)\n\nMid-City Community Action Network (CAN) seeks to bring together community partners to coordinate social, health and community services advocate for change in government policies and systems, and generally work for greater community involvement and community-based decision making.
