        "text": "Key Advocacy Areas\n\nThe Coca‑Cola Companyâs public policy agenda is built around our mission to refresh the world and make a difference. In the U.S. and Canada, our policy priorities include sustainability,Â consumer preference, andÂ community impact. Our advocacy often involves collaboration and thought leadership in the public and private sectors. When significant to our business interests, we may also advocate through lobbying and coalitions. The companyâs public policy agenda in the U.S. and Canada is established by the North America Operating Unit and managed by the Vice President, Public Policy, Federal Government Relations & Political Engagement, and Senior Vice President & Chief of Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability. TheÂ Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight and annual reviews.\n\nLobbying\n\nCoca‑Cola engages in direct advocacy at U.S. federal and state levels of government to share information and perspective on our public policy priorities. The company discloses our lobbying activity and expenditures as required by law and adheres to the highest ethical standards. Â Coca‑Cola files federal lobbying reports quarterly with the Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Secretary of the U.S. Senate and makes these reports available on our company website.Â We file state lobbying activities with the appropriate governing agencies. Â Â LOBBYING DISCLOSURE REPORTS\n\nPolitical Engagement Outside the United States\n\nCoca‑Cola engages in direct advocacy outside the U.S. to share information and perspective on our public policy priorities. As true in the U.S., the company follows all national laws regarding political engagement and discloses our political giving as required by law in the countries where we operate. Disclosure of political contributions are made according to each countryâs legal framework and through the relevant national and regional regulatory authorities. Links to the relevant national and regional regulatory disclosure repositories are listed below.\n\nEuropean Transparency Register\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nAustralian Labor Party\n\nTrade & Other Tax-Exempt Organizations\n\nCoca‑Cola's business operations reach many markets. Our membership with trade groups and related organizations gives us the opportunity to exchange ideas among a broad range of perspectives on our key policy issues. While we may not agree with every position of each organization, the company believes diverse perspectives help contribute to balanced policy outcomes. The company voluntarily discloses our trade and social welfare group affiliations on a semi-annual basis.\n\nTrade groupsÂ organized under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code to which we contribute $25,000 or more in membership dues, along with amounts attributed to lobbying as identified by those organizations as non-deductible expenditures under Â§ 162(e)(1).Â Â TRADE GROUP MEMBERSHIPS\n\nSocial welfare groupsÂ organized under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code to which we contribute, along with amounts attributed to lobbying as identified by those organizations as non-deductible expenditures under Â§ 162(e)(1).Â Â The company does not make contributions to 501(c)(4) organizations for electoral purposes.Â Â SOCIAL WELFARE GROUP CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nÂ\n\nCorporate Political Contributions\n\nConsistent with U.S. federal law, Coca‑Cola does not use corporate funds to contribute to federal candidates, political parties, or political committees, or otherwise employ its resources, including in-kind, even when permitted by law. The company has a long-standing policy against use of corporate funds for independent expenditures or Super PACS, including toward electioneering communications.Â As of January 1, 2021, the company has not used corporate funds to directly support state or local political candidates, even if permitted by law.Â\n\nThe company, however, contributes funds on a limited basis to political groups organized under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code.Â In some instances, the company may also contribute corporate funds for the purpose of supporting or opposing state and local ballot initiatives with material impact on our business operations, if permitted by law.Â The Vice President of Public Policy & Government Relations, along with Legal, approves corporate political contributions, while ballot initiatives require additional approval by the Senior Vice President & Chief of Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability and the President of the North America Operating Unit.Â When the company contributes to political groups, the information is voluntarily disclosed on our company website.Â Â POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nÂ\n\nThe Coca‑Cola Political Action Committee\n\nThe Coca‑Cola Company Nonpartisan Committee for Good Government, our employee-funded Political Action Committee (Coca‑Cola PAC), makes political contributions in a bipartisan manner to U.S. candidates based on alignment with established criteria and our company values. The Coca‑Cola PAC Board of Directors evaluates political contributions quarterly and our eligibility criteria on an annual basis.\n\nÂ"
