        "text": "Engage San Diego is a coalition of left-of-center organizations focused on civic engagement and voter outreach. It is a member of the left-of-center coalition State Voices and is one of State Voices’ California affiliates. Its fiscal sponsor is the San Diego LGBT Community Center.\n\nIn addition to the coalition’s work in civic engagement and voter outreach, it also has an affiliated action fund. The action fund endorses and supports left-of-center candidates for state, local, and national office.\n\nA major focus of the coalition is identity politics-based outreach to racial minorities, women, low-income earners, immigrants, and young people, which the coalition describes as the “New American Majority Electorate.”\n\nAmong the organizations that Engage San Diego has received donations from is the Tides Foundation, a major funder of left-of-center organizations.\n\nOverview\n\nEngage San Diego is a coalition of left-of-center organizations that works in San Diego County, California. The coalition focuses on civic engagement, voter outreach, advocacy, and community organizing among left-leaning communities in the county. The coalition was founded in 2010 by various left-wing activists, primarily to engage in voter engagement and organizing.\n\nEngage San Diego focuses on “underserved communities” that historically vote for left-of-center candidates and issues, including Asian-Americans, blacks, and Latinos (which the group refers to by the controversial term “Latinx”). The coalition also reaches out to women, the gay and lesbian community, low income earners, immigrants and refugees, and young people. The organization refers to these people as the “New American Majority Electorate.”\n\nEngage San Diego is a California affiliate of the left-of-center coalition State Voices. Its fiscal sponsor is the San Diego LGBT Community Center.\n\nThe coalition is also a member of the left-of-center San Diego Equal Voice Network, which was founded in 2016. The San Diego Equal Voice Network engages in identity politics outreach towards San Diego’s growing Latino and Asian-American population, the LGBT community, and low-income residents.\n\nIn addition to the ostensibly nonpartisan voter outreach, civic engagement, and advocacy, the coalition has an action fund. That affiliated action fund endorses and campaigns for candidates on the state, local, and national level. Most of the endorsed candidates are Democrats or align with the Democratic Party.\n\nCoalition Members\n\nEngage San Diego has 13 member organizations and special projects as of the 2020 election cycle. Those members are:\n\nVietVote\n\nPlanned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest\n\nACCE Institute\n\nCenter on Policy Initiatives\n\nSan Diego Organizing Project\n\nJustice Overcoming Boundaries\n\nMid-City Community Advocacy Network\n\nUnited Taxi Workers of San Diego\n\nThe San Diego LGBT Community Center\n\nACLU California\n\nAlliance San Diego\n\nPartnership for the Advancement of New Americans\n\nEnvironmental Health Coalition\n\nLeadership\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, as of September 2021 the most recent executive director of Engage San Diego was Alan Kaplan, who held the post from July 2017 to March 2021. Previously, Kaplan worked with groups advocating for increased immigration.\n\nFinances"
