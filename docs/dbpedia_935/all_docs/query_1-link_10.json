        "text": "The Center invites you to join us and the Coalition for Police Accountability and Transparency (CPAT) in calling for local governments to pass the Police Accountability Now policy reforms. Police Accountability Now policy reforms include five policy changes that will address racial and identity disparities present across San Diego County. Follow/Contact: @CPATSanDiego. Founded in 2017, The Center was a founding organization in a new coalition table called The Coalition for Police Accountability and Transparency (CPAT). CPAT advocates for just and fair policing that is grounded in ensuring healthy communities by working to address systematic inequities that are due to bias in laws, policies and practices that result in over-policing of communities of color. The Coalition believes in advancing community-centered, transparent and accountable policing that views the community as a partner. CPAT formed out of the need to advocate for changes within the San Diego Police Department to address evidence-based statistics that identified the department was over-policing communities of color during traffic stops. Since 2016, CPAT has been a leader in policy and advocacy surrounding police accountability and transparency throughout San Diego County. CPAT members are: Alliance San Diego, ACLU of San Diego & Imperial Counties, Earl B. Gilliam Bar Association, La Raza Lawyers Association, Mid-City CAN, San Diego Organizing Project (SDOP), Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) San Diego, Women Occupy San Diego, Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ), Community Assistance Support Team (CAST), United Domestic Workers and Center on Policy Initiatives.\n\nGreat strides have been made locally, statewide and nationally in the ongoing effort to secure safe communities for all and vigilantly prosecute crimes motivated by hate. In 2009, President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard & James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, making hate-motivated crime against someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity and expression a federal offense, granting the federal government more latitude to investigate hate crimes otherwise dismissed by local authorities and requiring the Federal Bureau of Investigation to track hate crime statistics against transgender people. This is the first act of Congress to extend protections to transgender Americans.\n\nThe Center works with civic and community leaders to encourage the reporting of hate-motivated incidents, connect victims of hate crimes to supportive resources, and educate the community about the investigation and prosecution process. In addition, we monitor local and national trends, and collaborate with other communities vulnerable to hate crime to raise public awareness.\n\nIf you believe you’ve been the victim of a hate crime, call 911 or report the incident to the San Diego Police Department online,\n\nTo file a report with the FBI, click here.\n\nTo learn more about local resources for victims of hate crime, visit the San Diego County District Attorney’s Hate Crimes webpage.\n\nIf you’d like information about national hate crime trends, click here.\n\nTo learn more about the Matthew Shepard & James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, click here.\n\nYou may also contact The Center’s Chief Public Affairs & Civic Engagement Officer at 619.692.2077 x103 or publicaffairs@thecentersd. org for further assistance.\n\nSchool-based bullying is an insidious phenomenon that has been linked to lower academic performance and achievement, truancy, absenteeism and suicide. With the advent of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, these effects have only been amplified.\n\nCalifornia is one of several states that have taken major steps to address the pervasive problem of bullying. Legislative mandates range from requiring publicly-funded schools to adopt a basic nondiscrimination clause to more robust solutions such as remedial bullying intervention programs and inclusive curriculum with positive depictions of LGBT people.\n\nThe Center works with stakeholder groups including the GLSEN, The Trevor Project and the Genders & Sexualities Alliance (GSA) Network to educate administrators, teachers and parents about the implications of bullying when left unchecked, and about the variety of resources at their disposal.\n\nTo learn more about California safe school laws, visit Equality California or the California Safe Schools Coalition.\n\nTo learn more about proposed federal safe schools legislation or safe schools laws by state, visit the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nFor resources such as model policies and data-driven anti-bullying programs, visit Welcoming Schools or the California Department of Education.\n\nFeel free to contact The Center’s Chief Public Affairs & Civic Engagement Officer at 619.692.2077 x103 or PublicAffairs@thecentersd. org for further assistance.\n\n#LoveWins – On June 26, 2015, after a long-sought victory for the LGBTQ rights movement, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5-to-4 vote on Friday that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage.\n\nIn the Opinion of the Court, Justice Kennedy wrote that “No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. Their plea is that they do respect [the institution of marriage], respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.” It’s been a decades-long, hard-fought fight for the freedom to marry.\n\nTo learn more about relationship recognition laws in California, visit EQCA.\n\nFor information about relationship recognition by state, visit Freedom to Marry."
