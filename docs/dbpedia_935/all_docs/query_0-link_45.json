        "text": "Youth involvement can benefit organizations and their programs as well as the youth themselves. Programs that are developed in partnership with youth are more likely to be effective at engaging the population and, therefore, to have a greater impact. Involving youth as partners in making decisions that affect them increases the likelihood that the decisions will be accepted, adopted, and become part of their everyday lives. In addition, empowering youth to identify and respond to community needs helps them become empathetic, reflective individuals, setting them on a course to potentially continue this important work in their future. Meaningful youth engagement views youth as equal partners with adults in the decision-making process. Programs and activities are developed with youth, rather than for youth. In this kind of equal partnership, both adults and young people need to be fully engaged, open to change in how things are done, and share a unified vision for the partnership.\n\nConsiderations for organizations that want to involve youth in a meaningful way\n\nWays to involve youth throughout the life of a program\n\nResources\n\nHHS/ASPE\n\nHHS/ACF/CB\n\nHHS/ASH/OPA\n\nHHS/USDA/NIFA\n\nHHS/CDC/SAMHSA\n\nFEMA\n\nHUD\n\nDOL/ODEP\n\nUSAID\n\nPeace Corps\n\nAdditional Federal Resources"
