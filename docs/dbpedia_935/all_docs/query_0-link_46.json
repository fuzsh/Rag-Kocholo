        "text": "​Djimet Dogo is the Associate Director of the Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization (IRCO) and Director IRCO/Africa House. His work to effect true community engagement includes a demonstrated history of over 23 years' experience facilitating collaborative coalition building for refugee and immigrant communities. His many educational qualifications include a Master of Public Administration from PSU and several degrees in Human Rights, Conflict Resolution, Peace building and Leadership from France, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Libya and South Africa.\n\nMr. Dogo was pivotal in the creation of the culturally specific community focal point Africa House in 2006—the only culturally and linguistically specific one-stop service center targeting the increasingly diverse and rapidly growing number of African immigrants and refugees living in Oregon.\n\nMr. Dogo is a member of the Oregon Commission of Black Affairs, member of City of Portland New Portlanders Policy Council (NPPC), Secretary General of the Coalition of Community of Color (CCC) and the Secretary General for the Nationwide African Economic Development Solutions (AEDS).\n\nLiz Fouther-Branch, BS, MS, is a retired educator turned Storyteller, cultural worker, and archivist who loves sharing stories about family, history, and the sense of place. Liz develops history panels with artist Bobby Fouther on a family archives project that includes 99 years of Black life and the arts in Oregon. Liz's work examines stories through pictures, interviews, and artifacts of her family migration, the intergenerational trauma of red-lining and displacement, and navigating the ins and outs of Black Life.\n\nLiz's goal as a Culture Bearer is to share stories often erased from the typical historical and creative canon. She believes “Black\" stories need to be preserved, championed, told, and retold. Her work includes exhibits, presentations, and sharing family photos that tell the history of Black people living, working, and memory-making across the Pacific Northwest. Liz and her brother gave visual presentations on “Juneteenth\" for the Oregon Employment Department and “Crossing The Red Line\" for the First Unitarian Portland joint with the Oregon Synod Lutherans and the Center for Equity and Inclusion. The creation of the history panels was part of a large exhibition called “Culture + Trauma\" at Gallery 114, window exhibits at the Old Albina Art Center, and Red E Cafe.\n\nHer current vision as one of the members of the Culture-Bearers Archive is to continue creating a digital archive showing the creativity, resilience, and persistence of Black life in the Pacific Northwest.​\n\n​\n\nTai Harden-Moore, Founder of Moore Consultants, LLC, is a dedicated diversity, equity, belonging, and inclusion advocate.\n\nWith an unwavering commitment for changing the way organizations approach diversity, equity and inclusion, Tai is dedicated to helping organizational leaders deepen their knowledge and develop the strategies necessary to create diverse, equitable, and inclusive environments for all.\n\nDuring Tai's career, she has used her skills and experience to guide organizations through the process of meeting their diversity, equity, and inclusion goals. From refining recruitment and retention strategies that attract and keep employees of diverse backgrounds; to performing in-depth equity assessments and providing strategic planning services, Tai has focused her work on helping leaders create the changes within their organizations that are needed to sustain success.\n\nIn addition to her work as Founder of Moore Consultants, LLC, Tai has also served her community through a variety of leadership positions in the nonprofit sector. She has served in positions for organizations such as Susan G. Komen Oregon & SW Washington, Oregon Community Foundation, Oregon Donor Alliance, and Professional Business Development Group.\n\n​\n\n​Travis Nelson was appointed to the House of Representatives on January 27, 2022 representing House District 44. He was sworn in on the first day of the 2022 Legislative Session. He is proud to join the legislature as the first ever Black LGBTQIA+ member.\n\nThe grandson of Louisiana sharecroppers, his parents moved his family to the Pacific Northwest before he entered grade school. He put himself through community college and then Washington State University School of Nursing by working food service, landscaping, and janitorial positions. It is this strong work ethic that has carried him to where he is today.\n\nThroughout his career as a Registered Nurse he saved lives by practicing constant attentiveness along with being a strong advocate. He specialized in Emergency Nursing, Critical Care Nursing, Medical-Surgical Nursing and Rehabilitation Nursing. Serving as a union representative honed his advocacy skills and allowed him to begin tackling the many problems inherent in our healthcare system. He is a member of the Sierra Club, American Nurses Association, Oregon Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, the NAACP and a former Vice President of the Oregon Nurses Association. He knows healthcare is intersectional and is entwined with our environment, housing policy, racial justice, and so many other social determinants of health. It is this intersectionality that initially drove him to run for office. ​\n\n​Senator Woods was elected to the Oregon Senate in 2022.\n\nSenator Woods grew up on the south side of Chicago.
