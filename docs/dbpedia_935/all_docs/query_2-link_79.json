Session days are on the 2nd Wednesday of each month from June 12th through December 11th. There will also be a two-hour evening Meet and Greet on Wednesday, April 10th; a one and a half day Opening Retreat on Thursday, May 9th through Friday, May 10th; and a three-hour graduation celebration on Wednesday, January 8th, 2025. To remain in the program, City Advocates are required to attend the Meet and Greet, Opening Retreat, and all seven session days unless prior arrangements have been made with the program director.\n\n• What does a program day look like?\n\nThe day will begin by networking with your cohort over breakfast, followed by a guest speaker or panel. A mix of guest speakers, panelists, tours, and engaging team building activities will take place throughout the day with two fifteen-minute breaks and lunch in between. The session will end with a debriefing of the day’s agenda during happy hour and the completion of a survey to provide us feedback on how to make the program even better.\n\nNote: Breakfast and lunch are provided, dietary restrictions will be accommodated. City Advocates are responsible for paying for their own parking unless otherwise noted. Additionally, City Advocates are responsible for their own happy hour meals and beverages.\n\n• When does the application process begin?\n\nThe portal for 2024 applicants will open December 15th and close February 14th. Acceptance notifications will be sent on Monday, February 26th. Tuition fees will be due no later than Friday, March 29th.\n\n• What does the tuition fee cover?\n\nTuition is $1,200 and can be paid by the individual or employer, due no later than Friday, March 29th. Tuition goes towards the operation of the program and includes:\n\n• Ticket to Downtown Cleveland’s Annual Ruth Ratner Miller Celebration (April)\n\n• Ticket to State of Downtown at The City Club (mid to late October)\n\n• Invitation to the Downtown Cleveland Improvement Corporation’s Annual Meeting at the Union Club (November)\n\n• Meals (breakfast + lunch during each session day; breakfast, lunch, and dinner during the Opening Retreat)\n\n• Materials\n\n• Any necessary session day transportation\n\n• Graduation celebration\n\n• What do I do if I or my employer cannot afford the tuition fee?\n\nPlease contact us at Downtown Cleveland."
