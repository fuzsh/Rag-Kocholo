I replied that the left had made it one by treating climate change as an imperative for sweeping ideological change. Climate alarmists insist that the earth is doomed unless we radically change the way we live by reducing freedom, limiting choices, and aggrandizing government. The struggle is not about the science of global warming, in short; itâs about the theology of global warming - a theology that commands us, in Al Goreâs formulation, to âmake the rescue of the environment the central organizing principle for civilization.â\n\nThis religious aspect of climate alarmism, which many conservatives and libertarians grasp intuitively, is not often acknowledged openly by its adherents. But now and then it is stated with unabashed directness, as with this headline in the Guardian, an influential London daily, during the Copenhagen conference: âThis is bigger than climate change. It is a battle to redefine humanity.â Precisely.\n\nJeff Jacoby, Dec 27, 2009, Boston Globe\n\nGood quote for Dec 2007:\n\nâI mean, talk about a direct IV into the vein of your support.

Born in Boston in 1937 to Klaus and Erika Goetze, Rolf and his younger brother, Christopher, spent summers in a close-knit summer community in Randolph, NH. Rolf's fondness for mountains and spectacular vistas came from the summers he spent as a caretaker at the Randolph Mountain Club's Grey Knob and Crag Camp huts. His schooling cultivated and stoked his natural curiosity, starting with the influential Shady Hill School, a year of German schooling in Schoendorf, Phillips Exeter, Harvard and Harvard's Graduate School of Design (Masters in Architecture), as well as a PhD in Housing and Social Policy from MIT. Always eager to explore less traveled paths, Rolf and his wife, Julie Anne (Decker) Goetze joined the Peace Corps and lived in Kathmandu, Nepal in 1962-64. The campus buildings he designed for colleges in Pokhara and Kathmandu still stand today. The return from Nepal was another adventure of 9 months, which included buying a Volkswagen Beetle and Julie and Rolf driving it across India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey and on to Austria and Germany, including some roads that saw less than a dozen cars per year.\n\nSettling in Belmont, MA upon their return, Rolf and Julie raised 4 children with frequent family visits to the White Mountains in NH and the Green Mountains in VT. Summer vacations were opportunities for multiple family car camping trips in a Volkswagen Bus, visiting National and State Parks throughout the United States. During this time, Rolf worked at the Boston Redevelopment Authority as the Director of Housing Revitalization Programs, published many articles and wrote 3 books: Building Neighborhood Confidence (1976), Understanding Neighborhood Change (1979), and Rescuing the American Dream (1983). Rolf's curiosity introduced him to computers, databases and GIS mapping and he coordinated Boston's initial city-wide, parcel-based Geographic Information System. In 1991, Rolf founded GeoData Analytics, which was a partnership of land use development consultants, which did analytical data mapping work for many Massachusetts towns. Rolf and Julie enjoyed hiking and exploring the Maine coast and inland during long weekends in Southwest Harbor, ME, based in a 19th century house they owned for 15 years.\n\nIn 2000, Rolf and Julie moved to Cambridge, MA to the house in which Rolf had grown up. He applied his architectural ideas and experience to a significant renovation and modernization of the house. Rolf and Julie continued to make annual spring trips to beloved State and National Parks. \"Theodore Roosevelt National Park is not to be missed if you are in North Dakota!\" Rolf would say. It is off the well-traveled path.\n\nRolf passed away on June 27 and is survived by his wife, Julie Anne, son Erik Goetze and his partner, Stephen Gumbs, son Ben Goetze and his partner Lara Sprinski and granddaughter Katelynn Goetze; daughter Devi Mapakoi and her husband William Mapakoi and grandchildren Will Jr., Gavin and Keanna, as well as son Karl and his wife Amy Lord and grandchildren Ella, Viva and Cyrus. Rolf is also survived by sister-in-law Lydia Goetze, and nieces Lisel Record and Erica Goetze and their families. Rolf loved family gatherings and seeing what the \"next generation\" was up to. He always had many questions for them and we will miss those.\n\nNote: Rolf Goetze is perhaps best known in Cambridge as the author of the 1994 study on rent-controlled housing in Cambridge: âAffordable Housing for the Privileged, Not the Poor; a Study of the Impact of Rent Control in Cambridge, Massachusetts â. This study was widely quoted at the time during the 1994 Question 9 Initiative Petition campaign that resulted in the abolition of rent control in Massachusetts.\n\nElections Updates\n\nPolling Location Change For Voters in Ward 7 Precinct 3\n\nPlease be advised that your polling location, if you choose to vote in-person on Election Day for the upcoming State Primary, September 3, 2024, will be located at:\n\nCAMBRIDGE RINDGE & LATIN SCHOOL, 459 Broadway, Media Cafeteria, Cambridge Street Entrance\n\nYour polling location will NOT be Gund Hall, 48 Quincy Street, Cambridge Street Entrance.\n\nPolling Location Information Polling Locations - Sept 24 (PDF) State Primary Voter Guide 2024 (PDF)\n\nOn the Sept 3, 2024 ballot:\n\nSenator in Congress (MA)\n\nRepresentative in Congress\n\nFifth District\n\nSeventh District\n\nCouncillor (Governorâs Council)\n\nThird District\n\nSixth District\n\nSenator in General Court (State Senate)\n\nSecond Middlesex District\n\nMiddlesex & Suffolk District\n\nSuffolk & Middlesex District\n\nRepresentative in General Court\n\nTwenty-Fourth Middlesex District\n\nTwenty-Fifth Middlesex District\n\nTwenty-Sixth Middlesex District\n\nTwenty-Ninth Middlesex District\n\nSecond Suffolk District\n\nEighteenth Suffolk District\n\nClerk of Courts (Middlesex County)\n\nRegister of Deeds (Middlesex Southern District)\n\nAdvance Removal and Depositing of Ballots for the State Primary, September 3, 2024\n\nUnder the provisions of âThe Votes Actâ, early voting ballots may be processed in advance of Election Day.

From its humble beginnings in 1994, the game has grown considerably over the years, yet has remained loyal to its mission of offering a glimpse of what it was like in the old days, when hundreds of fans would turn out to root for their âtownâ team in various local semipro leagues.\n\nWhat makes the Oldtime Baseball Game so special is our dazzling collection of flannel uniforms that represent virtually every era in baseball history. Used just once a year for the Oldtime Baseball Game, and then returned to storage the uniforms include such long ago teams as the Boston Braves, St. Louis Browns and Brooklyn Dodgers. Teams from the old Negro Leagues are represented by the Kansas City Monarchs, Homestead Grays and Baltimore Elite Giants. Cuba is represented by the legendary Cienfuegos Elefantes. We even have a uniform from a team that never actually existed: the New York Knights for whom Robert Redfordâs Roy Hobbs character played in âThe Natural.â\n\nPlayers from the game are chosen from colleges and universities from throughout New England, with an occasional high school player or retired big-leaguer added to the mix. Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez came out of retirement in 2017 to work two shutout innings in the Oldtime Baseball Game. The 2018 game featured one of the most interesting pitcher-batter match-ups in our gameâs history, as legendary Red Sox knuckleballer Tim Wakefield faced Pro Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Raymond Bourque. In 2019, seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens pitched pitched two innings, and then played two more innings at first base. Jim Lonborg, Cy Young Award winner for the 1967 Red Sox, pitched a shutout inning in 2015. Other former big-leaguers include Oil Can Boyd, Mike Pagliarulo, and, of course, Lou Merloni, an annual fixture at the Oldtime Baseball Game.\n\nAdmission to the Oldtime Baseball Game is free. Fans are asked to bring a beach blanket or chair and camp out along the foul lines, as it is the crowd that makes the game so electric.\n\nMembers Sought for Cambridge Veterans Advisory Committee\n\nAug 1, 2024 â Cambridge City Manager Yi-An Huang is seeking members to serve on the Advisory Committee for the Cityâs Department of Veterans Services (DVS).

The Foundryâs nonprofit operator, the Foundry Consortium, manages the building and stewards community activities in the various community spaces including the performance space, maker workshops, dance studio, art classrooms, and multi-purpose rooms.

The CRA is an independent public body focused on publicly-beneficial real estate projects and infrastructure investment within the City of Cambridge.\n\nThe mission of the CRA states, âThe Cambridge Redevelopment Authority is committed to implementing creative development projects and initiatives that promote social equity and environmental sustainability. As a real estate entity that works in the public interest, we offer distinctive public investment tools and a human dimension to our projects and partnerships throughout the City of Cambridge.â\n\nThe CRA is managed by an Executive Director and has a current headcount of 11 employees across its Leadership, Finance, Operations, and Planning and Development teams. Over the past decade, the CRA has led the redevelopment of the Foundry building, facilitated a public-private partnership to construct an electrical power substation, launched the Forward Fund nonprofit grant program, initiated multiple park and streetscape improvement projects, and purchased and renovated the nonprofit office building at 99 Bishop Allen Drive.\n\nThe CRAâs 2023 Strategic Plan deepens the organizationâs commitment to equity and sustainability through community infrastructure projects, affordable housing investments, and economic opportunity programs. New efforts underway include the development of affordable homeownership opportunities, the preservation and renovation of commercial and non-profit spaces that advance economic opportunity, and investments in vital community infrastructure including community facilities, open space, and transit.\n\nBoard members are responsible for setting the strategic direction and fiscal policies of the CRA. They oversee project selection, program goals, internal controls, contracting, and procurement decisions. The Board hires and supervises the Executive Director and sets annual budgets for the organization. It serves as a critical connection between community interests and program management.\n\nThe Board also guides existing redevelopment programs providing land use approvals and design review of buildings in the MXD area of Kendall Square. The Board monitors the delivery of ongoing community benefits stemming from development agreements with property owners. The CRA is hoping that the current vacancies could provide an opportunity to strengthen the CRAâs financial, real estate, and urban design skillsets on the Board. Additional information regarding the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority is available at www.cambridgeredevelopment.org.\n\nPer the state regulations creating redevelopment authorities (M.G.L. 121B), the CRA Board is composed of five members, four of whom are appointed by the Cambridge City Manager and confirmed by the Cambridge City Council. The fifth member is appointed by the Governorâs office. The CRA Board is a public body that meets at least monthly under the guidance of the Open Meeting Law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

All board and commission members in Cambridge must have the ability to work and interact effectively with individuals and groups with a variety of identities, cultures, backgrounds, and ideologies. Women, minorities, veterans, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and persons with disabilities are encouraged to apply.\n\nCRA Board meetings are currently held on the second or third Wednesday of each month, from 5:30-8:30pm. While meetings are hybrid to enable the public to participate virtually, Board members are expected to attend the meetings in-person, and should also plan to spend a few hours each month outside of meetings reviewing documents, visiting potential sites, etc.\n\nApplications can be submitted to City Manager Yi-An Huang using the cityâs online application system at Cambridgema.gov/apply.

The Cambridgeâs City Charter: From Town Meeting to Plan E combines historical documents, images, maps, and statistics to present a provocative half-hour overview of Cambridgeâs first 94 years as a city and the origins of the current Plan E charter.\n\nThe episode examines our shared history through the lens of the City Charter and local elections. It shows how the Town Meeting style of government became impracticable and led to the consolidation of Old Cambridge, the neighborhood around Harvard College, with the villages of Cambridgeport and East Cambridge to create the city of Cambridge, chartered by the Commonwealth in 1846. The half-hour video presents a visually engaging review of the expansion of Cambridge as bridges linked Old Cambridge to Boston in the 18th and early 19th century, as migration drove population growth, suffrage expanded, and participation in local elections increased.\n\nA second episode of Cambridge Civic View is planned that will look at the history of the current Plan E charter. Since 1940, Plan E has defined our local government, given us the existing system of nine City Councillors with a City Manager as our chief executive, and established the ranked-choice proportional representation voting system used to elect our Councillors and School Committee. It is hoped that these videos will provide necessary perspective on how the current City Charter came to be and how it might be modified.\n\nComments?\n\nLocal Walks/Hikes [more listings (BWMG, AMC, DCR, etc.] - Open to All.

I also do the Cambridge InsideOut show via Zoom. For telephone (not cell phone) I have a device from Ooma that I can use for VoIP phone service at low cost.\n\nThe difficult part to understand is how to navigate the various streaming options in such a way that I donât end up paying even more than I am currently forking over to Comcast. My primary TV needs are old movies (like TCM), Red Sox games, Twilight Zone, real news stations like BBC, all the local channels (of course), some science stuff (weâre really into cosmology), South Park, and a few other things. My understanding is that streaming can be a real data hog, and though Comcast doesnât currently charge extra for excess data, they will likely do so at some point.\n\nSooo.... I am looking for a plan here. Any sage advice?\n\nComing up soon (more details here):\n\nWed, Aug 14\n\n4:00pm Cambridge Election Commission (Zoom)\n\nWed, Aug 21\n\n11:00am The City Councilâs Housing Committee will hold a public hearing to continue the discussion on allowing multifamily housing in all neighborhoods of the City.

We donât have to follow no stinkinâ rules!\n\nUpdated January 3, 2024 - In the 2022-23 City Council Rules, there are two items that have been often ignored in recent City Council terms:\n\nRule 28. Every committee of the City Council to which any subject may be referred shall report on the subject within a reasonable time from the time of referral. Any committee report that has not been signed by the Chair of the committee within seven days after submission of the committee report by the City Clerk will be placed on the City Council agenda unsignedâ¦\n\nRule 29. Minutes shall be kept of all committee proceedings. All minutes, reports, and papers shall be submitted to the City Council by the City Clerk or their designee. Recommendations of each committee shall be made to the City Council for consideration and adoption.\n\nAs if communication through the Tunnel of Zoom wasnât bad enough, some committee Chairs apparently have not seen fit to keep either their colleagues or the public informed unless they were present at the meeting or chose to view a recording of the meeting. There are reasons why minutes of a meeting are taken. Not everyone wants to suffer through a recording of a long and possibly boring meeting, and a voluminous transcript is not a substitute for good (succinct) minutes.\n\nHere is the current record of deliquency [Chair]:\n\nCambridge City Charter Study Group\n\nI would like to informally gather a group of concerned Cambridge residents to form a Study Group to better understand the Cambridge City Charter - past, present, and future - in detail. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the current Charter? How did we come to have the current (Plan E) Charter? What improvements to the governmental form and election methods might be advisable? [References]\n\nThis Study Group would be separate from the âofficialâ Cambridge Charter Review Committee that was recently appointed by several city councillors. Among other things, this group can monitor the official review committee, discuss and critique any proposals coming from that committee, and independently propose alternatives.
