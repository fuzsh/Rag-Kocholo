Submitting a proposal prior to a specified deadline does not negate this requirement.\n\nSummary Of Program Requirements\n\nGeneral Information\n\nProgram Title:\n\nCivic Innovation Challenge (CIVIC)\n\nA Research and Action Competition Driven By Community Priorities\n\nSynopsis of Program:\n\nThe Civic Innovation Challenge (CIVIC) is a research and action competition that accelerates the transition to practice of foundational research and emerging technologies into communities through civic-engaged research. By addressing priorities at the local scale that are relevant across the US, CIVIC is laying the foundation for a broader and more fluid exchange of research and technology capabilities and civic priorities through joint partnerships involving civic partners and the research community. CIVIC funds projects that pilot state-of-the-art solutions to community challenges over 12 months, following a six-month planning phase, and have the potential for lasting impact in the partnering community as well as the potential to be scaled and implemented in other communities. Additionally, the foundation for CIVIC projects should be rooted in maturing and transitioning state-of-the-art research in disciplines, including but not limited to computer science, engineering, geosciences, biological sciences, and social sciences.\n\nCIVIC is uniquely designed to enable transition to practice of innovations into communities, as follows: (1) CIVIC flips the community-university dynamic, by empowering communities and researchers to jointly identify civic priorities ripe for innovation and to address these priorities as equal partners; (2) CIVIC focuses on research-centered solutions that are ready for piloting in and with communities on a short timescale, where real-world outcomes can be evaluated within 12 months; (3) CIVIC requires a coalition of communities and civic partners and a multi-disciplinary set of researchers to co-create and execute pilot projects; and (4) CIVIC organizes and fosters nationwide \"communities of practice\" around high-need problem areas that allow for meaningful knowledge sharing and cross-site collaboration during both the pre-development and piloting stages.\n\nFor this solicitation, civic partnership and engagement activities, communities, and academic and civic partners must be based in the United States or its protectorates. For purposes of clarity, civic partners may include local, state, or tribal government officials; non-profit representatives; community organizers or advocates; community service providers; and/or others working to improve their communities.\n\nCIVIC is organized as a two-stage competition with two tracks centered around the following topic areas:\n\nTrack A. Climate and Environmental Instability - Building Resilient Communities through Co-Design, Adaption, and Mitigation\n\nTrack B. Bridging the gap between essential resources and services & community needs.\n\nIn Stage 1, approximately 35-40 Planning Grant awards will be made â€“ each with a budget of up to $75,000 for six months to undertake planning and team development activities. These include solidifying the team, maturing the project plans, and preparing a well-developed full proposal for submission to Stage 2. Only Stage 1 CIVIC recipients can submit to the CIVIC Stage 2 competition.\n\nIn Stage 2, approximately 20 Full Awards will be made. These will be selected from Stage 1 award recipients. For Stage 2, proposals will be considered with budgets up to $1,000,000 for up to 12 months. Proposals must describe how the PIs will execute and evaluate their research-centered pilot projects.\n\nThroughout both stages, NSF award recipient (2223449) MetroLab Network (metrolabnetwork.org, nsfcivicinnovation.org) will foster \"communities of practice\" through in-person and virtual activities, aimed at enhancing the teams' capacity-building, networking, impact, and ability to create methods and solutions transferable to other communities.\n\nThe CIVIC research and action competition is jointly supported by NSF's Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE); Directorate for Engineering (ENG); Directorate for Geosciences (GEO); Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE); Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO); and the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nCognizant Program Officer(s):\n\nPlease note that the following information is current at the time of publishing.

Introduction\n\nThe Civic Innovation Challenge (CIVIC) is a research and action competition designed to build a more cohesive research-to-innovation pipeline and foster a collaborative spirit between communities and researchers. CIVIC aims to flip the community-university dynamic by empowering communities and researchers to jointly identify civic priorities ripe for innovation and to address these priorities as equal partners. Together, academic and civic partners leverage scientific and community expertise to make progress towards addressing the themes in the two tracks specified in this solicitation.\n\nCIVIC aims to accelerate the transition to practice of foundational research and emerging technologies and approaches into communities through civic-engaged research, while deepening cooperation and information sharing across sectors and regions. Whereas many community-university partnerships take years to provide tangible benefits to communities, CIVIC funds projects that rapidly pilot state-of-the-art technologies and ideas over 12 months, following a six-month planning phase, and have the potential for lasting impact in the partnering community as well as the potential to be scaled and implemented in other communities.\n\nII. Program Description\n\nA. Overview\n\nCIVIC is laying a foundation for a broader and more fluid exchange of research interests and civic priorities that will create new instances of collaboration and accelerate the impacts of scientific discovery for public benefit. This goal will be achieved by maturing and transitioning state-of-the-art research in disciplines, including but not limited to computer science, engineering, geosciences, biological sciences, and social sciences, through support for projects that are ready for piloting in and with communities on a rapid timescale, with significant potential for real-world impact that can be delivered and evaluated within 12 months. A CIVIC project should address community-challenges identified via tight collaboration between civic and academic partners, with the goal of achieving concrete impacts in the communities. Project outcomes should also be scalable and sustainable within the partnering community and have aspects that are transferable to other communities across the US.\n\nCIVIC is comprised of two tracks:\n\nTrack A: Climate and Environmental Instability - Building Resilient Communities through Co-Design, Adaption, and Mitigation\n\nThis track supports projects that pilot community-driven, innovative, and actionable research-centered approaches and technologies that focus on strengthening the resilience of a community and its economy to climate- and associated environmentally-related instability and disasters such as extreme heat events, flooding, wildfires, etc. Projects may target specific function(s) and aspects of a community such as utilities, communications, and other critical infrastructure; public health; transportation and mobility, food and agriculture; water security; ecosystem services; residential and commercial buildings; financial services; education and workforce development; community planning; and other services at individual, household, neighborhood, city, or regional scales. Projects can involve cyber, physical, environmental, biological, and/or social components. Multi-domain teams consisting of research and civic partners should co-create scalable pilot projects that lead to measurable community impact and outcomes. Teams may consider and incorporate the needs of economically disadvantaged and marginalized populations that are especially susceptible to increasing climate-and environmental stress and its resulting impacts. Teams are encouraged to also consider a system's thinking perspective around environmental sustainability and thresholds, and implications for public safety and wellbeing.\n\nAs civic-academic teams assess impactful, local pilot projects that protect communities against climate risk and disasters, they may consider questions such as but not limited to:\n\nWhat is urgently needed for the partnering community to strengthen the resilience of its built or natural environment â€” or its economy and services within a specific sector, in the face of current and future climate conditions and cascading hazards?\n\nWhat novel adaption and mitigation approaches can be implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote decarbonization, while mobilizing capital, investment, and public support at scale?\n\nWhat are the policy, health, environmental, and economic implications of the proposed pilot project on the community?\n\nTrack B: Bridging the gap between essential resources and services & community needs\n\nThis track is centered on enhancing peoples' access to essential resources and services, where better accessibility could significantly improve quality of life and community resilience. Gaps and inequities in resource and service allocations result from long-standing, systemic issues around accessibility, economic disparity, poorly designed interfaces, or the result of disruptions caused by a shock or disaster. Examples of relevant areas for this track include food and water security, transportation and mobility, housing, workforce training and development, recreational facilities and access to the natural world, healthcare, education, social services, financial services, and digital inclusion. Proposers are encouraged to leverage anchor institutions in their community that are focused on delivering or providing access to one or more resources or services to a set of end-users which may include socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and vulnerable populations (such as the elderly and those who are physically disabled). Multi-domain teams of research and civic partners must co-create scalable pilot projects that will lead to measurable, inclusive, and equitable outcomes.\n\nProposing teams should consider questions that include, but are not limited to:\n\nWhat inefficiencies or inequities in access or distribution exist regarding a given type of service, and are the problems occurring as a result of, for example, gaps in information, lack of coordination, a technological divide, design flaws, limited resources, inadequate community voice, or lack of infrastructure?\n\nWhat innovative technological, financial, social, or organizational approaches can be used to improve access to and coordination of essential resources and services, thus improving the connection between service providers and service seekers? How might community-wide expertise and innovative thinking be brought to bear?\n\nWhat is needed to deploy secure digital platforms and tools that leverage emerging advancements in artificial intelligence, sensing, and other related fields, while building and ensuring trust in their fairness, security, privacy, and robustness?\n\nWhat are the holistic requirements in terms of social, physical, environmental, and digital infrastructure that can realistically be designed, developed, and/or deployed within communities in a 12-month time frame to promote successful outcomes?\n\nFor all proposals (Track A or Track B), the project team must include civic partners working together with researchers to develop, pilot, and evaluate the proposed project. Civic partners may include local, state, or tribal government officials; non-profit representatives; community organizers or advocates; community service providers; and/or others working to improve their communities. In addition, teams may choose to engage with industry partners. To be true partners in these activities, it is encouraged in the Stage 1 Planning Grants and Stage 2 Full Awards for civic partner(s) to receive an appropriate distribution of funds in the project budget, if allowable by the participating organization. Although only universities and non-profit organizations are eligible to receive funds directly from NSF, other civic partners and organizations (including local, tribal, and state governments and industry) may receive funding via subawards from the recipient organization.\n\nFor this solicitation, civic partnership and engagement activities, communities, and the academic and civic partners must be based in the United States or its protectorates.\n\nNSF is committed to broadening participation among underrepresented groups, institutions, and geographic regions. This is essential to the health and vitality of our Nation. Teams are encouraged to work directly with members of underrepresented groups as team members and/or to carry out civic partnership and engagement activities`\n\nProposals should anticipate providing Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approvals as appropriate prior to award.\n\nB. Project Categories\n\nThe CIVIC program comprises two stages, Stage 1 Planning Grants and Stage 2 Full Awards. Stage 1 projects will be selected through an open proposal submission. However, only Stage 1 participants will be allowed to submit proposals for Stage 2. For Stage 2 projects, the PI must be the same as Stage 1, but other changes in the team composition are allowable.\n\nStage 1. Planning Grants (PGs). Projects funded in this stage will provide support for a period of six months with a budget not to exceed $75,000. Each of these projects will undertake a range of planning activities in anticipation of submitting a Stage 2 proposal, such as strengthening collaborations with relevant partners and communities, solidifying the deliverables and the academic and civic partner team members' roles, and refining the vision and plan for executing the research-centered pilot project.\n\nStage 2. Full Awards (FAs). Projects funded in this stage will provide support for a period of 12 months with a budget not to exceed $1,000,000. Each Stage 2 project will pursue a research-centered pilot project in either one of the two tracks specified in this solicitation. Teams will define clear roles for the civic and research organizations, describe expected research and community impacts, identify risks in execution and their possible mitigation, and provide plans for scaling the project as well as project sustainability beyond the period of the award.\n\nC. \"Community-of-Practice\" Activities\n\nMetroLab Network, supported by NSF award 2223449, will lead a range of activities critical to the success of CIVIC, including outreach, capacity building, recipient support, and joint-funder engagement. MetroLab Network will foster \"communities-of-practice\" through in-person and virtual activities aimed at enhancing the teams' capacity-building, networking, impact, and ability to ultimately create methods and solutions transferable to other communities.\n\nCIVIC recipients must participate in cohort activities led by MetroLab Network and the NSF CIVIC program team, with a combination of in-person or virtual events. Projects must send a minimum of two team members to participate in these activities, including the PI and preferably another member of the project representing a sector different from the PI. For example, if the PI applies via a non-profit, they may send a second team member from academia; local, state, or tribal government; service provider; or another sector represented on the team. An alternate representative may attend these events, if approved by NSF.\n\nRecipients must participate in the following activities, which will be held either in-person or virtual. Stage 1 recipients must participate in a one- or two-day kickoff workshop and a two-day event near the end of the six months, including a showcase of progress to date on the first day. Stage 2 recipients must participate in a two-day kick-off event, a two-day mid-year workshop, and a one-day showcase at the end of the projects. Each Stage 2 recipient will also be required to participate in a bimonthly discussion with NSF and possibly partnering agencies, to share project and partnership updates including progress towards sustaining and scaling promising project outcomes. Details of these activities, including whether they will be held in-person or virtual will be provided to the recipients. Additional virtual activities will be provided to the recipients, including those focused on capacity-building and networking.\n\nAt the showcases at the end of Stage 1 and Stage 2, recipients will present demonstrations and/or summarize progress made during their awards. In addition, each team will prepare content that includes a one-page graphic summary of their project and a video of up to five minutes describing the project. Award recipients agree that the resulting presentation material may be posted online for public access and/or shared by NSF with interested parties. NSF anticipates the documents may be posted on a MetroLab Network or other appropriate website.\n\nProposing teams must include in their budgets travel to these events. The events are anticipated to be located in the Washington, DC area.\n\nIII.

Titles for Stage 2 Full Award proposals must begin with \"CIVIC-FA Track A\" or \"CIVIC-FA Track B\".\n\nThe rest of the proposal title should describe the project in concise, informative language so that a scientifically- or technically-literate reader can understand the aims of the project. The title should emphasize the expected outcome of the project and be suitable for use in the public press.\n\nProject Description:\n\nAll proposals must include all sections required by the PAPPG, including Broader Impacts, and Results from Prior NSF Support.\n\nStage 1. Planning Grant (PG) Proposals\n\nProject Description: PG proposals should describe how the team will use the planning grant period to refine their team, ideas, and research-based pilot project in order to prepare for submission of a Stage 2 Full Award. The Project Description for PG proposals is limited to 7 pages in length. PG proposals exceeding 7 pages in length will be returned without review. References do not count as part of the page limits.\n\nThe Project Description must include separate sections labeled Vision for a Research-Centered Pilot Project, Civic Partnerships and Engagement, Broader Impacts, and Results from Prior NSF Support. A subsection labeled Research Questions must be included as part of the Vision for a Research-Centered Pilot Project section. Proposals lacking one or more of these sections or subsection will be returned without review. Additional details about these sections follows:\n\n1) Vision for a Research-Centered Pilot Project must be the central focus of the Project Description. This section must outline the vision and goals of the pilot project that would be carried out within a real-world context in Stage 2; indicate the partners involved in the project; and the tasks to be performed during the Stage 1 PG. It should also include a description of the respective roles of each organization. Note that teams must propose a vision for Stage 2 outcomes and products that go beyond a model, policy, best practices document, or academic publications.\n\nResearch Questions must detail technical and social science research questions, hypotheses, and research gaps that will be explored during the planning period in order to refine the Stage 2 pilot project.\n\nTeams should consider the following as they develop their vision for a Research-Centered Pilot Project:\n\nIn what ways does the envisioned Stage 2 pilot project go beyond the state-of-practice and state-of-the-art?\n\nIs the envisioned Stage 2 pilot project suitable for the fast-paced timeline of CIVIC?\n\nWho are the members of the team, including academic and civic partners, and why is each relevant for the project? Are there gaps in expertise that will be addressed during the planning period?\n\nWhat are the activities to be undertaken during the Stage 1 PG to prepare the team to propose a competitive Stage 2 proposal?\n\n2) Civic Partnerships and Engagement must describe the community(ies) where the activities will be undertaken and detail how the team will work together to \"close the loop\" and achieve significant impact with their proposed activities. NSF expects strong collaboration across the PG team. Details of the collaboration should be included, both previous partnerships and engagement and the specific proposed roles and responsibilities for this project.\n\nTeams may wish to consider the following as they develop their civic partnership and engagement plans:\n\nWho from the community should be engaged in the project? This may include city or state departments or agencies, regional councils of government, human and social service providers, city planners or land/resource managers, as well as other potential partners who are interested in addressing the specific topic, enhancing service provision, and/or creating better approaches for residents to inform a region, city, or community.\n\nHow will the collaborative approach break down barriers between academia, civic organizations, and local and state governments to achieve desired impact?\n\nFrom the community's perspective, do the proposed activities address a problem of significance? In what ways has the community worked to address this problem previously? Why does the community believe this problem will benefit from inclusion of researchers?\n\nIs there a need for skill building or workforce development elements in order for the community to be an integral part of the pilot project and adopt the pilot project outcomes long term?\n\nWhat combination of civic partner(s), civic engagement activities, and research outputs will enable the project team to \"close the loop\" and achieve significant impact with their proposed activities?\n\nDoes the team have the capacity to undertake a fast-paced research-centered pilot project in Stage 2, including the ability to meet regularly?\n\n3) Broader Impacts must include the content described in the NSF PAPPG.\n\n4) Results from Prior NSF Support must include the content described in the NSF PAPPG.\n\nStage 2. Full Award (FA) Proposals\n\nProject Description: The Project Description for Full Award proposals is limited to 15 pages in length. References do not count as part of the page limit.\n\nThe Project Description must provide details on a research-centered pilot project within a real-world context and describe how the civic partnership and engagement components infuse and support the proposed project. It should summarize activities conducted during the PG and how these activities have prepared the team for the FA, as well as the ability for a rapid start-up of the pilot project at the onset of the award. Proposals must include separate sections labeled Research-Centered Pilot Project; Civic Partnerships and Engagement; Broader Impacts; Results from Prior NSF Support; Management Plan; Evaluation Plan; and Scalability, Sustainability, and Transferability.\n\nA subsection labeled Research Questions must be included as part of the Research-Centered Pilot Project section. Proposals lacking one or more of these sections or the subsection will be returned without review. Additional details about these sections follows:\n\n1) Research-Centered Pilot Project section must be the central focus of the Project Description. This section must outline the proposed pilot project and its goals; preparatory activities carried out, including those from the PG; tasks to be performed during execution of the FA; and the roles of each team member along with the role of their respective organization. Note that teams must propose a vision for Stage 2 outcomes and products that go beyond a model, policy, best practices document, or academic publication(s). Priority will be given to projects that are scalable and generalizable to other communities.\n\nResearch Questions must detail technical and social science research questions, hypotheses, and research gaps that will be explored during the proposed project.\n\nTeams should consider the following as they develop their Research-Centered Pilot Project:\n\nIn what ways does the proposed pilot project go beyond the state-of-practice and state-of-the-art?\n\nWhat technologies and/or prior work are being leveraged for this project? What were the results from the PG and how have they supported the vision for the FA?\n\nHow ready is the proposed project for demonstration in the selected community within 12 months with the available award size for CIVIC?\n\nIf changes in the team happened from Stage 1 to Stage 2, what are the reasons for those changes and what are the additional capabilities of the new members?\n\nWhy are the proposed activities best suited for collaboration between researchers, communities, and civic partners, rather than as independent efforts? How will the team members work together during the execution of the FA and will civic partners be able to receive funds?\n\nWhat are the constraints within which the project must work (e.g., availability of paid and unpaid individuals contributing to the project, deployment and operations restrictions or conventions in the community, and cost of the proposed activities)?\n\nWho will be impacted by these activities? Is this impact sufficiently large to warrant investment of time and future funds on the part of the community? Will the proposed activities receive the necessary \"buy-in\" from the local government and citizens in order to achieve the desired impact?\n\nWhat resources and infrastructure from the partnering community will be leveraged for the proposed activities?\n\nHow do considerations of equity, access, and data privacy factor into the proposed solution(s)?\n\n2) Civic Partnerships and Engagement must describe the community(ies) in which the activities will be undertaken and detail how teams will work together to \"close the loop\" and achieve significant impact with their proposed activities. Details of the collaboration should be included, both previous partnerships and engagement and the specific proposed roles and responsibilities for this project.\n\nTeams should consider the following as they are developing their civic partnership and engagement plans:\n\nWho from the community should be engaged in the project?\n\nFrom the community's perspective, do the proposed activities address a problem of significance? In what ways has the community worked to address this problem previously? Why does the community believe this problem will benefit from inclusion of research?\n\nIs there a need for the pilot project to involve skill building or workforce development elements in order for the community to adopt and sustain the pilot outcomes?\n\nWhat combination of civic partner(s), civic engagement activities, and research outputs will enable the project team to \"close the loop\" and achieve significant impact with their proposed activities?\n\nDoes the team have the capacity to undertake a fast-paced, research-centered pilot project, including the ability to meet regularly?\n\n3) Broader Impacts must include the content described in the PAPPG.\n\n4) Results from Prior NSF Support must include the content described in the PAPPG.\n\n5) Management Plan. The Project Description for FA proposals must contain a Management Plan that describes the specific roles and responsibilities of all members of the team: PI, co-PIs, other Senior Personnel, and other partners. This section should describe the expertise each member or group brings to the project, including to the technical and/or social-science dimensions, access to the target community, and management of project tasks. If any member of the team is not included in the budget, describe the reason.\n\nIn addition, teams should consider the following:\n\nHow will the project be managed across academic disciplines, institutions and organizations, and community(ies)? Identify specific collaboration mechanisms that will enable cross-discipline and cross-sector integration of teams. How did this approach work during the Planning Grant award period? Note that although the lead PI must be from an institution of higher education or non-profit organization, teams are encouraged, as it makes sense for a given project, to designate funds for other member(s) of the team to participate in the project.\n\nWho will be involved in carrying out tasks over the course of the project? Consider including a timeline with principal tasks and associated interactions.\n\nHow will the team address issues such as data sharing, data governance, and any intellectual property developed during the project?\n\n6) Evaluation Plan. Teams should have a plan to monitor and adjust the proposed pilot project activities to ensure that they are meeting the envisioned goals of the involved set of partners and communities. The Evaluation Plan should be specific to the project's proposed goals and milestones, which includes the effectiveness of the multi-domain, civic-academic partnerships. For example, it should describe criteria, metrics, and methods for assessing progress, impact, and outcomes. Evaluations may use methods most appropriate for measuring community impact (e.g., qualitative and/or quantitative assessment, periodic and/or longitudinal analyses, and public participation in data collection).\n\n7) Scalability, Sustainability, and Transferability. In the design of their 12-month pilot projects, teams should consider the scalability, sustainability, and transferability of successful outcomes.\n\nTeams should consider addressing the following:\n\nWhat is the vision for scaling the project to full implementation in the context of the team's proposed project?\n\nHow will the team sustain the project beyond the period of NSF support to increase impact beyond the pilot stage? Examples include partnerships with civic partners who can build and facilitate local, long-term support or relevant technical training of the local community/end users.\n\nAlthough the focus of the proposed activities should be on a pilot project that is specific to the team's local community, projects should not simply propose a point solution but must have components that are transferable to other communities. This section should describe the aspects that may be transferable.\n\nSupplementary Documents:\n\nProposers are required to submit all Supplementary Documents required in the PAPPG. Information on Project Personnel and Partner Institutions is also required. Biographical sketches for civic partners not designated as senior personnel are strongly encouraged as are Letters of Collaboration. See below for more details.\n\n1.

After proposers have received an e-mail notification from NSF, Research.gov should be used to check the status of an application.\n\nVI. NSF Proposal Processing And Review Procedures\n\nProposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as ad hoc reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.\n\nA comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/.\n\nProposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in Leading the World in Discovery and Innovation, STEM Talent Development and the Delivery of Benefits from Research - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022 - 2026. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.\n\nOne of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.\n\nNSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.\n\nA. Merit Review Principles and Criteria\n\nThe National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission \"to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.\" NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.\n\n1. Merit Review Principles\n\nThese principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:\n\nAll NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.\n\nNSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These \"Broader Impacts\" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.\n\nMeaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.\n\nWith respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.\n\nThese three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.\n\n2. Merit Review Criteria\n\nAll NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.\n\nThe two merit review criteria are listed below. Both criteria are to be given full consideration during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.\n\nWhen evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:\n\nIntellectual Merit: The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and\n\nBroader Impacts: The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.\n\nThe following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:\n\nWhat is the potential for the proposed activity to\n\nAdvance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and\n\nBenefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?\n\nTo what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?\n\nIs the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?\n\nHow well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?\n\nAre there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?\n\nBroader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.\n\nProposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.\n\nAdditional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria\n\nIs it evident that the envisioned CIVIC project is (a) addressing a community priority with an impactful pilot that has the potential to be scaled and sustained, and (b) driven by strong partnerships between the necessary set of civic institutions and organizations, researchers, and other partners and other community partners?\n\nIs the proposed pilot project well-suited for execution in the fast-paced 12-month timeframe of the CIVIC program, including a rapid start-up at the onset of Stage 2?\n\nDoes the proposal clearly articulate the desired impact of its planning activities or envisioned pilot, with well-defined metrics and benchmarks for evaluating progress and success?\n\nB. Review and Selection Process\n\nProposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, Site Visit Review, or Reverse Site Review.\n\nNSF will manage and conduct the review process of proposals submitted in accordance with NSF standards and procedures, as described in further detail below. The review and award recommendations will be coordinated by a CIVIC Interagency Working Group comprising program directors from the CIVIC program in CISE, ENG, GEO, SBE, and BIO, and program directors from DHS and DOE. Relevant information about proposals and reviews of proposals will be shared between the participating funding organizations as appropriate. This Working Group will make joint decisions. For projects to be funded by DHS and DOE, those agencies will transfer funds to NSF, and NSF will make the awards.\n\nReviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.\n\nAfter scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new recipients may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.\n\nAfter programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements or the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.\n\nOnce an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.\n\nVII. Award Administration Information\n\nA. Notification of the Award\n\nNotification of the award is made to the submitting organization by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)\n\nB. Award Conditions\n\nAn NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.\n\n*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-8134 or by e-mail from nsfpubs@nsf.gov.\n\nMore comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg.\n\nAdministrative and National Policy Requirements\n\nBuild America, Buy America\n\nAs expressed in Executive Order 14005, Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers (86 FR 7475), it is the policy of the executive branch to use terms and conditions of Federal financial assistance awards to maximize, consistent with law, the use of goods, products, and materials produced in, and services offered in, the United States.\n\nConsistent with the requirements of the Build America, Buy America Act (Pub. L. 117-58, Division G, Title IX, Subtitle A, November 15, 2021), no funding made available through this funding opportunity may be obligated for an award unless all iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in the project are produced in the United States. For additional information, visit NSF's Build America, Buy America webpage.\n\nC. Reporting Requirements\n\nFor all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.\n\nFailure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.\n\nPIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.\n\nMore comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg.\n\nVIII.

Other Information\n\nThe NSF website provides the most comprehensive source of information on NSF Directorates (including contact information), programs and funding opportunities. Use of this website by potential proposers is strongly encouraged. In addition, \"NSF Update\" is an information-delivery system designed to keep potential proposers and other interested parties apprised of new NSF funding opportunities and publications, important changes in proposal and award policies and procedures, and upcoming NSF Grants Conferences. Subscribers are informed through e-mail or the user's Web browser each time new publications are issued that match their identified interests. \"NSF Update\" also is available on NSF's website.\n\nGrants.gov provides an additional electronic capability to search for Federal government-wide grant opportunities. NSF funding opportunities may be accessed via this mechanism. Further information on Grants.gov may be obtained at https://www.grants.gov.\n\nAbout The National Science Foundation\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is \"to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.\"\n\nNSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.\n\nNSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.\n\nFacilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide Chapter II.F.7 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.\n\nThe National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.\n\nThe National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.\n\nPrivacy Act And Public Burden Statements\n\nThe information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by proposers will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding proposers or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See System of Record Notices, NSF-50, \"Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,\" and NSF-51, \"Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records.\" Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.\n\nAn agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB control number for this collection is 3145-0058. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 120 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions.
