        "text": "Amplifying voices\n\nDespite the increased interest in mental health over the past few years, the sector remains chronically underfunded and there is still a significant global unmet need for mental ill-health prevention and treatment. The global annual mental health finance gap is at least $200 billion, around 80% of people living with a mental health condition in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) are not diagnosed or treated, and less than 7% of global mental health research funding goes to prevention.\n\nThe evidence is increasingly clear that strengthening and amplifying the voices of advocates is core to mental health improvement, leading to more appropriate services, campaigns and community programmes. However, mental health advocacy is still under-resourced and most investment and focus goes to high-income countries.\n\nWe are addressing this gap as the worldâ€™s leading network of mental health advocates & civil society organisations. Leading by example in sharing power and bringing diverse voices of expertise and lived experience from LMICs to the global stage where it matters in decision-making, both in international agencies, and regional and local governments and organisations. We consistently challenge the power dynamics in how global priorities are set.\n\nThe Global Mental Health Action Network is not a provider of health support services or guidance.\n\nIf you feel you are in need of mental health support, please seek appropriate support from your local health care facility, community groups which specialise in mental health, or a national helpline if one is available. Please visit Find A Helpline who have identified over 1,600 free and confidential support resources available over phone, text or web chat."
