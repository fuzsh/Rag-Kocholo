The Mid-City CAN Youth Council launches a Skate Park Campaign to break skating stereotypes and bring a safe space for youth to skate in City Heights. The youth combined their efforts with a Health Impact Assessment and use data to support their argument for a skate park.

It showcases work created throughout California highlighting the power of individual and collective efforts to promote health and demonstrates how stories have the power to re-imagine and transform our communities.
