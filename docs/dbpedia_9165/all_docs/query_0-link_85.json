        "text": "1 / 50\n\nFollow2find/Shutterstock\n\nBiltmore Estate, North Carolina\n\nThe Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina, is the largest home in the U.S. and comes in at a staggering 175,000 square feet. That’s nearly 70,000 square feet more than the next biggest home in the U.S.\n\nThe estate was built for the Vanderbilt family, which built its fortune through railroads, and had 35 bedrooms, 43 bathrooms and 65 fireplaces. It was officially opened in 1895, six years after construction started. In 1930, the estate opened to the public and is now the top tourist attraction in Asheville.\n\nLiving there must have been like living in one of these 50 incredible castles.\n\nⓘ\n\n2 / 50\n\nFelix Lipov/Shutterstock\n\nOheka Castle, New York\n\nOtto Kahn built the 109,000-square foot Oheka Castle on Long Island from 1914-19 for a cost at that time of $11 million, roughly $158 million in today’s dollars. Kahn was a financier whose work included reorganizing railroads.\n\nNow a luxury hotel, the castle includes a golf course and used to have a private airstrip. Exterior shots of Oheka Castle even appeared in the classic film “Citizen Kane.”\n\n3 / 50\n\nGray Towers Castle, Pennsylvania\n\nModeled after medieval Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, England, Gray Towers Castle was built for sugar magnate William Welsh Harrison and designed by architect Horace Trumbauer.\n\nAt 66,341 square feet, Grey Towers s the 18th largest house in the U.S. The castle became part of the Arcadia University campus in 1929, and its once-regal bedrooms are now used as student housing! The castle is rumored to have been built without a single nail and there are several stories of it being haunted.\n\nThese 100 super scary home inspector nightmare photos will stop you cold in your tracks.\n\n4 / 50\n\nWinterthur, Delaware\n\nThe third-largest home in the U.S. is in one of the smallest states, Delaware. Clocking in at 96,582 square feet, Winterthur was built for the du Pont family and was completed in 1932.\n\nAvid art collector and horticulturist Henry Francis du Pont donated the mansion and collections to the state in 1951. It’s now the Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library, and houses one of the most important collections of early American arts and crafts. The museum is spread over 175 period-rooms and sits on nearly 1,000 acres of grounds and naturalistic gardens.\n\nIf you’re gardening in a slightly smaller space, check out the best plants for container gardening.\n\n5 / 50\n\nVersailles, Florida\n\nNope, not the French Versailles, though this soon-to-be-completed Florida megamansion is modeled after the famous French chateau. The long-term project of Westgate Resorts founder David Siegel and his wife Jackie, Versailles has been under construction since 2004!\n\nOnce completed, the lakefront estate in Orange County will measure more than 100,000 square feet, and feature three indoor pools, a bowling alley, a skating rink, a movie theater and at least 14 bedrooms.\n\nCheck out the other expensive properties in the U.S. on the market.\n\n6 / 50\n\nShadow Lawn (Wilson Hall), New Jersey\n\nThis 130-room building covers 90,000 square feet in New Jersey once served as the site of Woodrow Wilson’s summer home. It became part of Monmouth University in 1956 and was featured in the film Annie.\n\nFor those thinking a little less presidential about a summer home, check out some amazing cabins you have to see to believe.\n\n7 / 50\n\nPensmore, Missouri\n\nThis 72,000-square foot behemoth was constructed as a tornado-proof, bomb-proof, earthquake-proof home. It’s built with insulated concrete form and called Chateau Pensmore. It’s located near Ozark, Missouri and Steven Huff, an astrophysicist, built it to withstand an EF-5 tornado with reinforced steel referred to as helix, into the concrete, which should bend rather than break in the event of a tornado. For a more practical solution to prepare for a tornado, try researching a storm shelter.\n\n8 / 50\n\nThe One, California\n\nIconic Hearst Castle used to top the list of California’s largest homes, but it’s been usurped. The One, a newly-completed 100,000 square-foot mega-mansion built by real estate mogul Nile Niami, is expected to sell for at least $340 million. That will make it the U.S’s largest and most expensive home.\n\nWith its futuristic design, The One will feature 20 bedrooms, 30 bathrooms, and five swimming pools, plus a movie theater, 50-car garage and a private nightclub!\n\nYou can add square footage to your house, just maybe on a smaller scale.\n\n10 / 50\n\nMeadow Brook Hall, Michigan\n\nMatilda Dodge Wilson, the wealthy widow of automotive giant John Dodge, and her second husband, Alfred Wilson, built this 88,000 square foot home in the Rochester Hills area north of Detroit.\n\nConstructed between 1926 and 1929, the Tudor revival-style residence has 110 rooms, sits on 1,500 acres and cost nearly $4 million at the time it was built. Today it’s part of Oakland University and is still filled with much of the Wilsons’ priceless art collection.\n\n11 / 50\n\nBrandon Bisel / CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nStan Hywet Hall and Gardens, Ohio\n\nThere’s a lot of money in tires. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company co-founder F. A. Seiberling built this sprawling country house for his family in Akron, Ohio.\n\nBuilt between 1912 and 1915, the home was modeled on English country estates—its name is an Old English form of “stone quarry”, in homage to the former quarry it was built on. In the 1950s, the surviving Seiberling children donated the house to a non-profit, which now runs it as a historic mansion museum.\n\n12 / 50\n\nCastle Hill, Massachusetts\n\nCastle Hill, a 56,881-square-foot Stuart-style mansion sits on the 2,100-acre Crane Estate in Ipswich, Massachusetts, on a site whose history is linked to the arrival of the first British colonists.\n\nThe Crane family gained wealth from manufacturing brass goods and plumbing supplies and bought the property, which included five miles of shoreline, in 1910. The family donated much of the property to The Trustees of Reservations in 1945 and today it’s open for tours.\n\n13 / 50\n\nNottoway, Louisiana\n\nDown in Louisiana, this plantation house built in a Greek Revival style covers 53,000 square feet and dates back to 1859. John Hampden Randolph, a sugar planter, had the home built and made sure that it would remain a one-of-a-kind home by destroying the plans following its construction. It’s now a luxury hotel and a popular wedding venue.\n\nBefore you do any work to your home make sure you pick out a contractor who will follow the plan to a T.\n\n14 / 50\n\nChateau Montagel, Alabama\n\nChateau Montagel was a dream home for Larry House, the former CEO of a medical supplier, MedPartners, in Alabama. The 54,400-square foot home on 27 acres was built in 1997, with historic French and Italian castles in mind.\n\nIt took four years to build and includes some quirks. The driveway is shaped like a guitar, there’s a commercial elevator and a theater with a 170-inch screen. The home last sold for $4.8 million in 2017, well below its $12 million assessed value.\n\n15 / 50\n\nHala Ranch, Colorado\n\nThe 95-acre Hala Ranch in Colorado boasts 56,000 square feet and 15 bedrooms in the main house, overlooking the Rocky Mountains. It once held the distinction of being the most expensive property in the U.S. when it had a price tag of $135 million in 2006.\n\nJohn Paulson, a hedge fund billionaire purchased the ranch in 2012 for $49 million from Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan, a former ambassador to the U.S. Bin Sultan bought the land for the house in 1989 and completed the house two years later.\n\nThe property has its own wastewater treatment plant and we’re not talking a septic tank, though you might be surprised to know how a septic tank works.\n\n17 / 50\n\n1299 Via Tivoli, Nevada\n\nThe total square footage of 1299 Via Tivoli in Henderson, Nevada is just under 40,000 square feet. It was completed in 2010 for eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and has 25 bathrooms, 33 bedrooms as well as two exercise rooms. There is also a 35-foot climbing wall, a vast pool and a racquetball court. Oh, there is space to fit 10 people for dining … in the wine cellar.\n\nWe’ve got a pretty neat idea of where to keep your wine stash.\n\n18 / 50\n\nCourtesy of Fernando Maclen\n\nOak Hall, Maine\n\nThe property, referred to as Oak Hall, Cobe Estate and Cariad, has sat on the shores of Penobscot Bay in Northport, Maine, since 1913. It was designed by Marshall & Fox as a summer home for Ira Cobe. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\nThe 20,000-square foot home and 13-acre lot sold for $1.84 million in June 2020, according to Zillow.\n\nBring the water to you with a great-looking backyard waterfall or if you’re more of a pond person, take a peek at some pond ideas.\n\n19 / 50\n\nChateau Bray, Texas\n\nThis one is kind of depressing. While 60,000-square foot Chateau Bray in Manvel, Texas doesn’t look so great from the outside, the interior is even worse — it’s 46 bedrooms and 36 bathrooms are completely empty.\n\nHouston doctor Ulysses W. Watkins started building two mansions in Manvel, Texas, outside of Houston, but one was never completed. The house has changed hands a few times but is still a work in progress.\n\nMake sure you know the zoning and building codes before you start building a mansion.\n\n22 / 50\n\nIllinois Governor’s Mansion\n\nAs the name suggests, the Illinois Governor’s Mansion is the governor’s residence in Springfield, Illinois. Constructed in 1855, it’s the third-oldest governor’s residence in the U.S. and draws on the Classical Revival style for its 45,000 square feet. It’s gone through several renovations and is currently the home of Governor J.B. Pritzker, though the public is allowed to visit.\n\nCheck out these 17 smart renovation tips so your project doesn’t run $15 million.\n\n23 / 50\n\nRichard G Smith/Shutterstock\n\nMarland Mansion, Oklahoma\n\nOil baron E.W. Marland once controlled ten percent of the world’s oil supply. He wanted to build a palace to reflect his vast wealth, and that’s what he did at Marland Mansion in Ponca City, Oklahoma.\n\nBuilt in the Mediterranean Revival style, the 43,561-square foot mansion includes 55 rooms, ten bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, seven fireplaces and a kitchen for each meal. Normally, we’ve got trouble fitting everything into our kitchen. The mansion is now a museum of art and architecture.\n\n24 / 50\n\nAsherwood, Indiana\n\nMel Simon, who once owned the Indiana Pacers basketball team, built this 51,267-square foot home in 1999. It included its own 18-hole golf course on the 106 acres in Carmel, Indiana. In 2017 Simon’s widow, Bren Simon, donated the estate to a performing arts center, which plans to use it to house the Great American Songbook Hall of Fame Museum.\n\nFull golf course in your backyard? Probably not, but maybe a putting green. Check out 19 crazy backyard putting greens.\n\n25 / 50\n\nWalker McCune Mansion, Arizona\n\nOnce home to Hormel Foods heir Geordie Hormel, this 52,000-square foot home once cost him $11,000 a month for electricity. The home takes its name from Penzoil heir Walker McCune, who built it in the 1960s.\n\nIt includes a 150-seat theater, an Olympic-size swimming pool and a beauty salon. Hormel died in 2006 and the home took quite some time to sell. Zillow currently values it at $8.1 million.\n\n28 / 50\n\nLongview Estate, New Hampshire\n\nOn its own private promontory on New Hampshire’s Lake Winnipesaukee, Longview Estate’s combined 63,000 square feet make it the Granite State’s largest.\n\nBuilt by New Hampshire International Speedway founder Bob Bahre and his wife, Sandra, the main house has seven bedrooms, 16 bathrooms, 15 fireplaces, and two elevators. It once listed for $49 million but sold in 2019 for a paltry $5.6 million. Times are hard!\n\nFind out other things around the house that aren’t as they appear.\n\n29 / 50\n\nStowe, Vermont\n\nIt won’t just be the square footage of this Vermont home that will knock you out. The 8,150-square foot home owned by former beer distributor Stephen Levin is filled with American folk art.\n\nOutside on the 85 acres are go-karting trails, a miniature golf course and a zip line. The downside, the ½-mile driveway to the main gate and then up another road to get the mail. It’s on the market for $12 million.\n\n30 / 50\n\nFayetteville, Georgia\n\nThis Georgia house is large enough to house the heavyweight champion of the world and the ego of a rapper. The Fayetteville, Georgia home that tops 44,234 square feet, has 109 rooms and two swimming pools.\n\nIt’s now owned by rapper Rick Ross and before that it belonged to Evander Holyfield. Ross bought the property for $5.8 million back in 2014. In late 2020, he purchased another 87 acres next door — maybe to build a guesthouse?\n\n32 / 50\n\nRamsey Mansion, Mississippi\n\nFinancier J. Edgar Monroe built this Mississippi home back in 1963 as an 11,000-square-foot ode to his Gatsby-style home in Rhode Island.
