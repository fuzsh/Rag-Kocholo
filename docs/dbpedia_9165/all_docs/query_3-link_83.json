        "text": "ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A North Carolina man who conspired with others to gain unauthorized access to government computer systems and online accounts belonging to several United States government officials was sentenced today to 2 years in prison.\n\nAndrew Otto Boggs, aka “INCURSIO”, 23, of North Wilkesboro, pleaded guilty on January 10. According to the statement of facts filed with the plea agreement, Boggs, along with others including co-conspirator Justin Gray Liverman, aka “D3f4ult”, 24, of Morehead City, North Carolina, joined a hacking group that called itself “Crackas With Attitude.” From about October 2015 to February 2016, the group used social engineering, including victim impersonation, to gain unlawful access to the personal online accounts of senior U.S. government officials, their families, and several U.S. government computer systems. In November 2015, Boggs and other co-conspirators used a victim's government credentials to gain unlawful access to a confidential federal law enforcement database. Several months later, Boggs publicly posted documents and personal information that the conspiracy unlawfully obtained from another government system, and which included names and contact information for tens of thousands of Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security employees. In total, the conspiracy targeted more than 10 victims and caused more than $1.5 million in losses to victims.\n\nLiverman pleaded guilty on January 6, and is scheduled to be sentenced on July 28. Other members of the conspiracy are located in the United Kingdom and are being prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nDana J. Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; Andrew W. Vale, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office; and Brian J. Ebert, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Secret Service’s Washington Field Office, made the announcement after sentencing by U.S. District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Maya D. Song and Jay V. Prabhu, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph V. Longobardo are prosecuting the case.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the Eastern and Western Districts of North Carolina, and the FBI’s Charlotte Division provided significant assistance with the investigation."
