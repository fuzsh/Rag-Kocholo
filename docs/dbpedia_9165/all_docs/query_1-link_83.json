Matteson Jr.\n\nCountry Music: Definitions, Biographies and Origin\n\nCountry Music (Country and Western) is an American style of popular musicassociated with the rural, agrarian southern United States or with the music of cowboys in the west. Country music was originally (1922-1924) called “old timey” (old-time), “old familiar tunes,” “hill country tunes,” “mountain” music or “songs of the hills and the plains.” In 1925 country music began to be called hillbilly music as in “originating in mountainous regions of southern US.” The word “country” didn’t become the standard term until the mid-1940s when (lead by Ernest Tubb) it began being called “Country and Western” and eventually this was shortened to “Country.” The music spans a wide variety of styles and is usually played on guitar and other stringed instruments.\n\nThe Early “String Band” and “Cowboy” Years (1922-1933) span the time period of the first commercial recordings made in the early 1920’s until the early 1930s and encompasses the major politic and economic event of the 1929 Depression. Early Country ends with the beginning of Western Swing before the honky-tonk style which was firmly entrenched until after the death of “The Hillbilly Shakespeare” Hank Williams in 1953. A new phase of Country began with the birth of rock n’ roll and Elvis (starting in the late 40s but 1954 seems to be the accepted date) in the mid-1950s, which is the end of the radio era.\n\nThe Western Swing and Honky-Tonk Years span the years 1933-1950. These years includes the Opry Stars like Roy Acuff and Red Foley, honky-tonk stars like Earnest Tubb, Hank Williams, and Eddy Arnold and the Western Swing bands of Light Crust Doughboys, then Milton Brown and Bob Wills.\n\nI’ve selected 29 of the most important Country-recording artists, however, several of the groups have additional biographies bringing the total to 43 with 5 additional record company bios found in this section. Most of the important songs and performers are included in the Country Music Timeline. The number of Country Music recordings between 1922 and 1942 (World War II) is a staggering 20,000 according to Guthrie Meade’s book “Country Music Sources” with around 11,400 different pieces.\n\nI’ve tried to feature the most important artists and most influential songs with more emphasis on the genesis from 1922-1929, hence the inclusion of Ernest Thompson and Roba Stanley, two obscure figures in a luminous history whose impact was certainly minimal. Roots is arranged chronologically by the first recording dates; for example Henry Whitter recorded before Fiddlin’ John Carson even though his first recordings weren’t released- Whitter still recorded first. Vernon Dalhart, a recording artist since 1916, made his first Country record for Edison in 1924. Although I’ve tried to get the ferret the facts, this is not a scholarly work and is not footnoted. When practical I’ve listed sources, but some quoted material may appear without credit. Any unauthorized use of copyrighted material is unintentional.\n\nThe Beginning of Country Music\n\nMany people believe that country music began on August 1, 1927 in Bristol, Tennessee when Ralph Peer signed Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family to recording contracts for Victor Records. This simply isn’t true. Country Music was in full swing by 1927, one of the biggest country hits of the first twenty-five years, “The Prisoner’s Song,” was recorded in 1924. Although Rodgers as well as The Carters would make a significant impacts on country music in the late 20’s and 30’s they were just two of hundreds of country artists who recorded in the 1920s.\n\nStated simply- Country Music began when “country” artists began making commercial recordings and began performing on commercial radio. The first such recording after the advent of radio was Eck Robertson in 1922 followed by Henry Whitter and Fiddlin’ John Carson in 1923. [Some historians like Tony Russell include the Vaughan Quartet gospel discs (Vaughan 300 series) as the first Country recordings which were issued on their own custom-made label in 1921.] Certainly it was the combination of radio and recordings as well as a distinct defined genre (old-time/hillbilly music and western “cowboy” music) that was the nucleus of creation in the 1920s.\n\nThe song that started it all- Sally Goodin with fiddler Eck Robertson:\n\nPainting by Richard L. Matteson Jr.\n\nThe 1923 recordings for Okeh (Henry Whitter’s “The Wreck of The Old Southern 97” and Fiddlin’ John Carson’s “Little Old Log Cabin In The Lane”) laid the groundwork for the future public clamor. The whole disenfranchised region in the south needed music that they could identify with; it was the music of their parents- the music that was passed down through the generations. It was music made by country folk, who worked in mills or farms, for country folk. This was the appeal of the early “hillbilly” recordings. Although the word, hillbilly (or hill billie) has been used both pejoratively and humorously in American print since the 1900 it was never applied as a music genre until 1925.\n\nWhat the recording industry wasn’t prepared for was the enormous commercial and popular success of “hillbilly” songs. Ralph Peer with Okeh and later Victor and Frank Walker with Columbia were searching for ways to compete onslaught of commercial radio stations. Radio was already cutting into their profits by early 1920s. After Peer’s hit with a blues song on a newly created “race” division, he was looking for new material. When Peer recorded Fiddlin’ John Carson’s “Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane” which sold over 500,000 units, the rush to record country artists was on. Then in 1924 one record, “The Wreck of the Old 97” with “The Prisoner’s Song” on the B side, would change everything. “The Prisoner’s Song” alone would go on to reportedly sell over 20 million copies and hillbilly music would be a dynamic force in the recording industry.\n\nTo solidify the genre’s name, Peer in 1925 christened a popular band (Al Hopkin’s Buckle Busters), The Hill Billies. When Peer began calling his Country artists “hillbilly,” the name stuck. Victor also discovered a new form of hillbilly music in Carl T. Sprague a ranch hand, veteran cavalryman and Texas A&M athletics coach. They recorded Sprague’s traditional cowboy ballads in mid-1925. The Western could now be applied to the Country.\n\nCarl T. Sprague\n\nWestern culture and cowboys had always fascinated Americans and much of the world. The musical heritage of the west is a long and rich one. Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show touted one of the first western bands, Buffalo Bill's Cowboy Band, which was organized and directed by William Sweeney in 1883. By 1895 Powder River Jack and Kitty Lee performed “cowboy songs” at the show. In 1910 John Lomax published “Cowboys Songs and Other Frontier Ballads.” Otto Gray and His Oklahoma Band formed in 1918 merged with Billy McGinty’s troupe and became a major vaudeville attraction. Gray and Gene Aurty would play roles in Country’s western recording revolution.\n\nSongs that would qualify as Country had been recorded earlier. Certainly Billy Golden could qualify as the first Country Music recording artist. Golden recorded “Turkey in the Straw” in 1896 and then the bluegrass standard “Roll on de Ground” in 1899. His performances were in a similar vein to those of future Grand Ole Opry star, Dave Macon. The “Arkansas Traveler” from 1901 by Len Spencer on Ed 8202 was a hit and stayed in the Columbia catalogue for years. Silas Leachman recorded “Turkey in the Straw” and then “Bake That Chicken Pie” by Collins and Harlan on Vi 5116 was a hit in 1907. “They Gotta Quit Kickin' My Dawg Around” by Byron Harding certainly resembles a song that would be a hit for John Carson in the 1920s.\n\nThere were hundreds of songs (see Early Country Timeline) that were recorded before 1922 that would become standards of the early country repertoire. Some were very successful like Alma Gluck's 1915 song \"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny\" recorded for Victor which reportedly sold over one million copies.\n\nBesides the early recordings of “Arkansas Traveler” and “Turkey in the Straw,” there were some country fiddle recordings made by country fiddlers. To say that old-time fiddler Eck Robertson was the first “country musician” to record commercial sides (Victor on June 30, 1922) is not correct. Charles Ross Taggart (1871- 1953), an American comedian and folklorist who appeared all over the Eastern U.S. as \"The Man From Vermont\" and \"The Old Country Fiddler\" from the mid-1890's to the mid-1930's, recorded two songs with Victor; \"Rural monologue with violin specialty,\" and “Violin Mimicry” Victor 17700 in 1914. Another country fiddler Don Richardson, born in Kentucky in 1898, recorded “Arkansas Traveler” on Columbia A2140 in 1915. Eck Robertson stature as a great fiddler isn’t the reason he made the first country recording. Robertson simply was the first country musician to record after the onset of radio in 1922.\n\nClearly radio was the other commercial force that began the country music “revolution” in the 1920s. One of the first radio stations to feature the emerging music was WSB in Atlanta, which began broadcasting March 16, 1922. Much of the programming on early country stations centered on live performances. There were no DJs and Country Top 40 back then. Chicago’s WLS Barn Dance (later called the National Barn Dance) began in 1924. The Grand Ole Opry, a Nashville offshoot, started broadcasting in 1925. Country musicians would travel to play at dances, fairs and fiddle contests and promote their performances on local radio shows that were popping up all over the South. Radio dominated commercial Country Music during the depression, most people didn’t have money for records but they could listen to the radio.\n\nThe name, Country Music, didn’t become established until the mid-40s when it was usually called “Country and Western Music.” The definition of who was a “Country Music” artist and who wasn’t is certainly confusing and arbitrary. Visibility on certain country radio stations or recordings on Country labels are the determining factors.\n\nConsider one of Country Music’s biggest stars; his first role was in Giacomo Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West; following this he played the part of Ralph Rackstraw in a production of HMS Pinafore. He also played the part of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly. His name: Vernon Dalhart, a man who sold more country recordings than any other early recording artist. His versions of “The Prisoner’s Song” and the “Wreck of the Old 97” paved the way for the coming onslaught of future “country” hits.\n\nIt was the guitar in particular that can be credited with the beginning of early country music. The increased availability of the guitar in the 1890s lead to the development of classic string band (guitar, fiddle, banjo and eventually stand up bass) in the 1900s. The guitar was to the string bands in the 1920s what the banjo was to the Minstrel bands of the 1840’s. Although jug bands were popular around 1910, it wasn’t until the early 1920’s that white string bands flourished. It was the guitar and the string band that ultimately ushered in a new style of music- what we know today as “Country Music.”\n\nMy Role in Country Music\n\nI began singing, played guitar and bass with a number of Country bands in the 1980s. At this time I also formed a bluegrass duo with Derrick Phillips. My current bluegrass band, The Bluegrass Messengers was formed with my talented students in 1995 in Winston-Salem, NC. Talented members have included Debbie Gitlan (award winning fiddler); Rex McGee (banjo); Martha Bassett (vocals & guitar) and Sally Spring (vocal) & Ted Lyons (mandolin). Wayne Hauser (banjo) recorded with famed fiddler Clark Kessinger. Several of my talented students are winning prizes and performing including Edward Dalton (guitar), Justin Swaim (banjo, guitar) and Daniel Habib (bass).\n\nI’ve had several memorable performances that included Country Music Hall-of-Famers. In 1991 I shared the stage with Chet Atkins. My trio opened the show and we sang and played several songs (the segment is recorded). When I went to pick up Chet at the hotel to go play, the car trunk was packed with amps and guitars. There was no room for him to put his guitar! (He had to get a ride with other band members). I have a photo of me with Chet backstage (below) and as a tribute to him played in Nashville the next year at the Chet Atkins festival.\n\nChet Atkins and Richard Matteson backstage\n\nSeveral years later I shared the stage with Roy Clark who was very complimentary of my playing. When Roy and I were promoting the concert we went out to my car to see a policewoman giving me a parking ticket. After recognizing Roy she tore up the ticket and got Roy’s autograph instead.\n\nThe other Country Music hall-of-famer who I played with several times is Doc Watson, a man I still consider to be a good friend although I haven’t played with Doc or talked with him in some years. Doc really sings and plays in the style of the old-time performers like Riley Puckett or Jimmie Rodgers. Doc has played on stage with my bluegrass group several times.\n\nChet Atkins played guitar with Bill Carlisle, Red Foley, Maybelle Carter of the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Doc Watson played with Tom Ashley of the Carolina Tar Heels. So in a round about way, I have a link back to the stars of early Country Music in the 1920’s through them. And so the “circle is unbroken bye and bye.”\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe most difficult challenge when writing about the 1920s is getting the facts right. I’ve corresponded with Nolan Porterman, author of the definitive Jimmie Rodgers biography and also old-time music authority Tony Russell. Archie Green was helpful in providing some details for my biographies of the Hill Billies, Haywire Mac, and the Carolina Tar Heels. He also gave me permission to use his excellent article, “Hillbilly: Source and Symbol” which I’ve quoted extensively."
