        "text": "NANTERRE, France (AP) — Léon Marchand held up four fingers.\n\nOne for every gold medal at the Paris Olympics.\n\nHis dominating run through the Summer Games is complete.\n\nWith French President Emmanuel Macron among the more than 15,000 fans cheering him on in a rugby stadium-turned-natatorium, Marchand captured his fourth swimming gold with another runaway victory in the 200-meter individual medley Friday night.\n\n“I don’t think anything went wrong this week,” Marchand said. “It was just perfect.”\n\nThe 22-year-old French star left no doubt he’ll be remembered as one of the biggest stars of the Summer Games in his home country. He finished in an Olympic record of 1 minute, 54.06 seconds, just missing Ryan Lochte’s 13-year-old world mark.\n\nThat was about the only thing he didn’t accomplish in six magical days at La Defense Arena, previously winning the 400 IM, 200 butterly and 200 backstroke — the latter two about two hours apart in the same session.\n\nMarchand became only the fourth swimmer in Olympic history to win four individual golds at a single games.\n\nThe others? Michael Phelps, who did it in both 2004 and 2008, Mark Spitz in 1972 and East German Kristin Otto in 1988.\n\nHeady company, indeed.\n\nThe silver went to Britain’s Duncan Scott, a body length behind at 1:55.31. China’s Wang Shun grabbed the bronze in 1:56.00, edging out American Carson Foster for a spot on the podium.\n\nA packed house at La Defense Arena came to party one more night with their favorite son. They chanted, sang “Sweet Caroline,” waved the French tricolore flag and unveiled a huge tifo in the upper deck.\n\nMarchand climbed from the pool, pumped his fists, then held out his arms as if to say, “What more could you want?”\n\nNot a thing.\n\nHe had done it all, more than fulfilling the expectations of his nation and the comparisons to Phelps, who was here to cheer Marchand on. What might have been a burden to some athletes only seemed to push Marchand to even greater heights.\n\nHe certainly enjoyed his moment, which his American coach Bob Bowman — Phelps’ coach, in an appropriate touch — had encouraged him to do.\n\nMarchand led the fans behind the podium in a cheer before climbing to the top step one more time. The crowd erupted in its most rousing rendition yet of “La Marseillaise” — though, of course, they’ve had plenty of chances to work on the French national anthem this week.\n\nChants of “Léon! Léon! Léon!” filled the arena as soon as the French anthem was done. Someone held up a sign that simply “Merci Léon.”\n\nThe celebration wasn’t confined to the pool, either.\n\nAt Stade de France, hosting the first night of track and field, such an enormous ovation broke out that the first heat of the 400-meter run in the decathlon was delayed. And at the French Olympic house in Paris, nearly 20,000 gathered outside during the race, including 19-year-old Arthur Oursel.\n\n“He’s a hero,” Oursel said. “He’s our hero.”"
