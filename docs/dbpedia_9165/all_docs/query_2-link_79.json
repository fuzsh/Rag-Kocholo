        "text": "Shrubs serve an important role in landscaping. They can be used as hedge borders, focal points, along the foundation of a home to “tie” it to the ground by softening strong architectural lines, and to fill large areas. Shrubs screen and separate private areas, create garden rooms, and absorb noise. Many are evergreen, providing a backbone for the winter landscape.\n\nUnlike annual flowers, or even some herbaceous perennials, shrubs are usually planted with permanence in mind. As such, it is important to carefully select plants to ensure long-term success. It is important to consider the plant’s adaptability to the proposed planting site, as well as its mature size. For best results, choose a plant that is best adapted to the climatic zone or region and will fit in the space designated for planting, even after it reaches full size.\n\nWhen selecting shrubs for the landscape, it is also important to consider each plant’s ornamental characteristics. Consider plant height, width, and shape; foliage\n\ncolor and texture, including fall color; bark attributes; and flowering and fruiting habits, to obtain the right shrub for your landscape design.\n\nShrubs can be used as living fences to delineate space and create garden rooms.\n\nOrnamental Characteristics of Shrubs\n\nMany shrubs are planted for their showy floral displays. You can develop a long season of bloom by planting various types of shrubs. The time any shrub remains in bloom varies from a few days to a few months; however, the time of year a shrub blooms remains the same year after year. Use a variety of shrubs that bloom in sequence to develop a planting with a long blooming period. Most landscapes have lots of flowers in spring, with few in summer or fall. Prolong the ornamental season through careful shrub selection. Choose shrubs known to bloom at alternate times of year, or choose plants that provide other ornamental traits during hot weather and into the fall such as colorful bark, fall foliage, or fruit.\n\nA number of ornamental shrubs produce attractive fruit following flowering. Some have black or dark purple fruit that often go unnoticed, unless sited for contrast. Brightly colored fruit make a better show than dull colors. The time fruit is ornamental should be a consideration. Fruit persisting into winter provides color in the winter landscape. A shrub may produce beautiful fruit, but too few to be noticed, so their ornamental value is low. Within limits, the larger the fruit the more ornamental it may be. Conversely, large fruit can be a problem to clean up.\n\nFor shrubs such as holly and yew, male and female flowers are produced on separate plants and fruit is only produced on the female plants. A plant with this flowering and fruiting habit is called dioecious. When female, fruiting plants are desired, a male plant must also be grown to ensure pollination. Usually one male shrub pollinates several female plants.\n\nFoliage color, other than green, can occur in fall, in spring, or from spring to fall. The foliage of shrubs with showy spring color often fades to green or off green by summer. Colored foliage or variegated shrubs can be less vigorous than the natural form with green foliage. Shrubs with colored or variegated foliage may need different light intensity. Sunlight is often necessary for good fall color development or summer foliage coloration. For example, barberry cultivars with purple leaves in the sun may have nearly green leaves in the shade.\n\nBark is another ornamental feature. The bark may be highly colored or have interesting texture. Shrubs with evergreen foliage, brightly colored bark, or striking bark textures and patterns can provide winter color and interest.\n\nAttracting wildlife may be a reason for selecting a particular shrub. Some shrubs produce fruits eaten by birds and others provide shelter; while some yield flowers that attract butterflies.\n\nSome shrubs have safety concerns that should be considered. Don’t plant shrubs with poisonous berries near public walkways. Keep in mind that plants with poisonous parts or spiny foliage or stems should be avoided in high traffic areas. On the other hand, spiny shrubs/hedges may provide “traffic control” and security for an area.\n\nSelect shrubs hardy enough to survive the winter and durable enough to endure the Oklahoma summer heat.\n\nAvoid shrubs with serious pest problems. The large selection of available shrubs makes it unnecessary to use those notorious for annual infestations of insects or diseases. Pests attack most shrubs during their lives, but most can be easily controlled or ignored. Shrubs to avoid are those with serious pest problems that render the plants aesthetically unacceptable.\n\nShrubs pruned in a formal fashion can be used to create\n\nfun and creative garden designs.\n\nShrubs for a Purpose\n\nTolerates or Prefers Dry Locations\n\nMost or all of the shrubs listed below will still require vigilant irrigation for at least the first growing season.
