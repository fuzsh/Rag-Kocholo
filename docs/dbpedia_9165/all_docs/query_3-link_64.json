        "text": "Early Life[]\n\nBorn in Schenectady, New York, to a lower-class family, only child Otto Octavius was raised by his overbearing mother and his abusive father. During his youth, Otto would often receive beatings from his father at home, or from bullies at school. Otto was devoid of friends, but excelled academically. [36]\n\nAfter high school, Otto was accepted into M.I.T. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for university. During Otto's first year of school, his father Torbert died in a construction accident, a fact for which Otto was very grateful. Otto continued a very close relationship living with his mother, but his mother continued to become more over-attached, and was jealous that Otto spent so much of his time at school.[36]\n\nAfter graduating M.I.T., Otto was hired by the U.S. Atomic Research Center to research radioactivity, a study he had already begun in his college career.[36] To help manipulate radioactive substances from a safe distance, Otto constructed a chest harness that could control four mechanical, tentacle-like arms - via neural impulses. This earned him the nickname Doctor Octopus. At work, he had fallen in love with a fellow researcher, Mary Anders, and the began a romantic relationship. When Otto's mother, whom he lived with, found out about his relationship, she accused Otto of turning his back on her and forced him to traumatically end the relationship. When Otto discovered his mother hypocritically dating behind his back, he blew up in rage at her. During his confrontation with his mother she died of a heart attack, leaving Otto with bitterness at being the cause of his mother's death.[37][38]\n\nBecoming Doctor Octopus[]\n\nConsumed with guilt, Otto couldn't fully focus during work, and volatile liquids exploded - bombarding the scientist with radiation. The substances left him capable of mentally controlling the arms, but the accident also caused irreversible brain damage - transforming the respected scientist into a megalomaniacal superhuman criminal.[26][39]\n\nWaking in a hospital, Otto knew this newfound strength - combined with his awesome intellect - could render him supremely powerful. Holding the medical staff hostage, Otto forced them to gather lab equipment for him to continue his work. But Spider-Man showed up. Doctor Octopus easily defeated Spider-Man. Doc Ock then took control of a leading nuclear research facility and again squared off with the wall-crawler, who this time defeated him with one punch to the jaw.[26][40]\n\nAfter serving time, Doc Ock attempted to raise funds by springing gangster Blackie Gaxton from a Philadelphia prison - assisted by Gaxton's lawyer, Bennett Brant. Spider-Man foiled the scheme but could not save Bennett from being shot in front of his sister, Betty Brant. After escaping from Spider-Man during a scuffle on a getaway boat meant for Gaxton, Octopus travelled throughout the country, committing some of the most spectacular crimes in an attempt to bring Spider-man to confront him. When that failed, Octopus returned to New York, where he hoped to find Spider-Man.[41]\n\nAfter kidnapping Betty Brant, whom Octopus knew Spider-Man had risked his life saving before, he fought Spider-Man on Coney Island, who was suffering from a severe virus attack, and easily defeated and unmasked him as Peter Parker. Falsely realizing that the weak Peter Parker could not be Spider-Man, Octopus left and went on a rampage, releasing zoo animals and finally confronting the \"real\" Spider-Man, and was defeated when he was trapped in a burning building.[42]\n\nAfter being imprisoned yet again, a team of specialists found a way to remove his harness. Now believed by the prison to be normal again and without power, they placed his tentacles in another part of the facility. It was at this time that Octopus showed that he had mental control over his arms, even when separated from him over short distances. Using this to his advantage, he summoned his tentacles to return to him and escaped from prison.[17]\n\nForming the Sinister Six[]\n\nOtto then deduced that to defeat Spider-Man, he could not do it alone. He decided to bring together a team of villains to destroy Spider-Man, and thus assembled the first Sinister Six to combat Spider-Man. He plotted to kidnap Betty Brant again and make her their hostage. However, Betty was visiting with May Parker at the time, who was also captured and taken hostage. Doctor Octopus treated May so kindly, though, that she remained blissfully unaware she had been kidnapped by the charming villain.[17][43]\n\nMaster Planner[]\n\nFollowing Spider-Man's defeat of the Sinister Six, Octopus assembled another group of costumed underlings and established an undersea base. Calling himself the Master Planner, he embarked on a series of thefts of experimental substances - seeking to further expand his mastery of the atomic sciences. His goal: to develop a radiation ray with which he could rule the world. But his plan was fated to entwine with Spider-Man's: when May fell sick, Peter provided her with a blood transfusion - not realizing the radioactivity in his plasma would kill her.[44]\n\nThe only substance capable of saving her was the experimental ISO-36. Peter managed to obtain enough money to fund the operation, but the Master Planner's forces hijacked the shipment for their own deadly research. Spider-Man tracked down the Master Planner to his underwater hideout and confronted his foe, revealed to be Doc Ock. After the base was destroyed, Doctor Octopus escaped once more. Spider-Man recovered the ISO-36 and saved Aunt May's life with the aid of Dr. Curt Connors (the Lizard).[3]\n\nDoctor Octopus' next scheme involved the theft of the Nullifier, a projector that could disable any device. After two failed attempts, Otto finally succeeded on his third. Turning the Nullifier against Spider-Man, he caused the wall-crawler to lose his memory and told him that they were allies. He then enlisted Spider-Man's help to steal the remaining components for the device.[45] Though Spider-Man had not regained his memory, his instinctive spider-sense persuaded him not to trust Doc Ock, and Otto was defeated once more.[46][47][48]\n\nMarriage[]\n\nNow imprisoned, with his arms confiscated, Otto again demonstrated that the range of his psionic control over the tentacles had increased to a far greater distance than previously believed.[49] The arms freed him from captivity; after hijacking a plane and exploding it, Doc Ock, believed to be dead, decided to rampage through the city, bringing attention to himself from Spider-Man.[50] In the ensuing battle between the two, Doc Ock accidentally knocked over a chimney, which killed George Stacy (the father of Gwen Stacy, the first true love of Spider-Man), who was preventing a child from being crushed by the chimney.[51]\n\nFree again, Doc Ock seized upon the Kingpin's absence to gather his forces and launch an all-out gang war against Hammerhead's thugs.[52] But Spider-Man's involvement quickly resulted in Doc Ock's return to prison.[53] While incarcerated, Doctor Octopus learned May Parker had inherited a small Canadian island containing a commercial nuclear reactor. On his release, he set out to woo and marry May. But Hammerhead interrupted the wedding, and the ensuing chase and brawl led to the destruction of the reactor.[54]\n\nOctopus survived the explosion and ended up living as a derelict in the Bowery, being haunted by the ghost of Hammerhead.[55][56][57] He sought out May Parker who took him back in even though he had left her stranded at the altar, leading him to kidnap her when he was attacked by Hammerhead.[58] He constructed a device to destroy the host, which instead brought Hammerhead back to life,[59] who kidnapped Aunt May. Octopus and Spider-Man briefly teamed up to rescue her.[60]\n\nDoc later tried to hijack an atomic powered submarine.[61] He also attempted to poison New York with printers' ink, and fought the Punisher and Spider-Man.[62] Doc next battled the Owl and his gang.[63][64] He successfully deactivated a nuclear reactor before a meltdown.[65] Mr. Fantastic diagnosed Doc Ock as suffering from multiple personality disorder.[66]\n\nSecret Wars[]\n\nDoc was taken to the Beyonder's Battleworld, where he fought a group of heroes and plotted against Doctor Doom for leadership of the group of villains. He was able to defeat the X-Men until Magneto came to their aid.[67][68]\n\nFear of Spider-Man[]\n\nWhen Doc Ock went to war with the Owl,[69] Spider-Man and the Black Cat attempted to intervene. Devastated that the confrontation had left the Black Cat near death,[70] a cold-hearted Peter said farewell to his friends before entering what he believed to be his final showdown with Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man's victory was remorseless, and Doc Ock developed a morbid fear of his arachnid foe.[71] Imprisoned in a mental institution, Otto struggled with his overwhelming phobia of Spider-Man. Knowing he could not face his foe directly, Ock's next plan involved the use of biological weapons to kill the entire population of New York. Spider-Man was forced to fake a humiliating defeat lest the city be destroyed, restoring Otto's self-confidence.[72][73]\n\nSavior of Spider-Man[]\n\nDoctor Octopus recruits Electro and Sandman for the New Sinister Six.[74] His next recruits were Hobgoblin and Mysterio.[75] His final recruit was the Vulture.[76] Doc Ock with his new Sinister Six planned to take over the world and destroy Spider-Man.[77] After trying to gas Spider-Man,[78] Spider-Man defeated the villains.[79]\n\nLearning his once-to-be-fiancée Mary Alice was dying from AIDS, Otto began a desperate search for a cure - stealing research materials to do so. His attempts failed, Mary Alice died, and the villain meekly surrendered to Spider-Man.[80] A world-weary Otto nonetheless escaped from prison. At the time, Spider-Man was dying from a chemical virus. Hoping to one day kill the hero himself, Doc Ock captured and unmasked his foe. Analyzing the virus, Otto offered him a cure. Daring to trust his foe, Peter accepted the mixture and was healed.[81]\n\nDeath and Resurrection[]\n\nDoctor Octopus was murdered by the insane Peter Parker clone named Kaine.[23] Octavius' student Carolyn Trainer took over as Doctor Octopus II, until the original was resurrected by a branch of the mystical ninja cult known as the Hand. Although Octavius had discovered Peter Parker's dual identity shortly prior to his death while curing Parker of a lethal virus created by the Vulture, he lost all knowledge of it upon his resurrection. The reason for this was the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by his associate Carolyn Trainer with his recorded memories. That recent memory had not been recorded at the time of his death (It is uncertain whether or not Trainer had some ulterior motive for remodeling Octavius' mind).[82]\n\nOctavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed \"Spider-Woman\"[83][84] and was involved in a plot with Fusion involving using prosthetic limbs as mind-control devices, to create an army of minions. [85] He also had to deal with another usurper, in the form of an arrogant-yet-brilliant scientist named Carlyle, who created his own version of Octavius' harness and who tried to kill Octavius, whose power he envied.[86]\n\nOctavius resurfaced in the attempt to kidnap a Palestinian ambassador, in hopes of causing chaos for reasons unknown. His plot was thwarted by Spider-Man and his temporary sidekick the Kiwi Kid.[87] Octavius was then taken into Ryker's Island and was drugged and brainwashed to take down the Green Goblin. He interrupted a battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin on the Brooklyn Bridge, and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below. Octopus was dragged out days later with no memories of the event.[88]\n\nCivil War[]\n\nOctavius unsuccessfully tries to form and lead another version of the Sinister Six, because Captain America's Secret Avengers managed to defeat the villainous group, although Ock himself eludes authorities. Doctor Octopus is later seen viewing a telecast of Peter Parker revealing himself to be Spider-Man. Ock then goes rampaging throughout the city, in utter disbelief that not only was he beaten numerous times by a teenager, but of the lost opportunity he had when he unmasked Parker. He is again defeated by Spider-Man, who confronts Doctor Octopus unmasked, after two of Peter's students distract Octavius. He is then sent to Baron Zemo's super villain detention facility and is one of the ex-super villains trying to hunt down the renegade super heroes. Ock abandons the team when he realizes being a part of the Thunderbolts is pointless. However, he was apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. and placed into custody.[89]\n\nBrand New Day[]\n\nAfter escaping, Doctor Octopus learned that after all his battles and injuries suffered, his body was failing, giving him just some months to live. He modified himself to be mentally connected to his own army of Octobots, and adding four more arms to his harness. His goal then became to use his abilities to take over the utilities of New York City, and turn it into a paradise under his control, though his mind's subconscious also targeted Spider-Man, and disrupted the wedding plans of his ex, Aunt May. Spider-Man and the Human Torch eventually track down his base, save the captive Jay Jameson (May's fiancee), Carlie Cooper, and Norah Winters, and finally destroy Doctor Octopus' hold over the city. Doctor Octopus is then able to escape (still holding power over his mini-bots) and vows a \"terrible revenge.\"[27]\n\nOrigin of the Species[]\n\nDoctor Octopus later assembles a super villain team consisting of Chameleon, Diablo, Electro, Freak, Hammerhead, Hippo, Lizard, Mister Negative, Morbius, the Living Vampire, Mysterio, Overdrive, Rhino, Sandman, Shocker, Spot, Tombstone, Vermin, and Vulture IV. He tells them to secure specific items and promised they will receive a reward. First, he targets Menace's newborn infant despite Spider-Man's interference as it has pure Goblin Serum in its veins which Doctor Octopus thinks that it would help cure his crippling illness.\n\nAfter Spider-Man grabs the infant from Doctor Octopus, he sends the villains after Spider-Man. Doctor Octopus talks with Chameleon stating that he had placed an Octo-Tracker on Spider-Man in order to track him down. After Chameleon steals the baby from Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus talks with the Chameleon saying that the baby is the first of a new species. Because the serums inside Norman Osborn and Lily Hollister co-mingled when they reproduced, the baby is beyond Octopus' procurement. He refers to it as \"Sui Generis\" and plans on using the new species' DNA to repair his body.\n\nWhen Spider-Man caught Chameleon, he mentioned that the baby is still alive, and that the Lizard stole it from him before it can be handed over to Doctor Octopus. Doctor Octopus was looking for the Lizard when Spider-Man arrived. Spider-Man told Doctor Octopus that they will get the baby back from the Lizard and then fight over who will get it. Spider-Man even mentioned to Doctor Octopus that the Lizard is now in a different appearance. When Doctor Octopus attacks Spider-Man, the Lizard attacks Spider-Man. Spider-Man threatens to attack the Lizard with the Lizard serum if he does not give him the baby. Lizard agrees and reveals that he got a blood sample from the baby and found out that Norman Osborn is not the father. The Lizard then gives the baby to Spider-Man saying that if Osborn is not the father, then the baby is of no use to him. Doctor Octopus then attacks the Lizard while Spider-Man escapes with the baby.\n\nSpider-Man, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four later fight Doctor Octopus and his macro-octobot army. During that time, he had assembled another version of the Sinister Six consisting of Chameleon (who was posing as Steve Rogers), Electro, Mysterio, Rhino, and Sandman in a plot to slip the macro-octobot army into a military base and detonate them. This was prevented by Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four. After his defeat, Doctor Octopus acknowledges Spider-Man's intellect and no longer considers him as the 'foolish child' he had believed him to be.[90]\n\nWhen Alistaire Smythe was having Scorpion, Fly-Girl and some cyborgs attack the launch base where John Jameson was, Doctor Octopus was observing the occurrences with a remote Octobot and uses the machine to assist the astronauts on board as part of his heretofore unknown plans.[91]\n\nEnds of the Earth[]\n\nAs his final master plan, Otto Octavius set in motion a set of events, starting with the announcement to offer the world a chance to stop global warming.[92]\n\nNext Doctor Octopus and his Sinister Six planned the theft of the Zero Cannon, (a powerful weapon which changes Earth's gravity field to send specific objects to space), from the group of genius super villains called Intelligencia. Otto and his group succeeded with Intelligencia down and the Cannon stolen.[93]\n\nLater, while disguised as Vice-President of America, Al Gore, Chameleon tried to accelerate the decision of world's leaders about Otto's earlier request, but was uncovered by Spider-Man, who interrupted the scene along with the Avengers. When the Chameleon was freed, he arrived in the Mediterranean for a meeting with the rest of the team. The Avengers followed them and fought the Sinister Six, but they were all defeated by the villains, save for Electro, who was sent to space by Thor.[94]\n\nUsing an explosion as a distraction, Silver Sable saved Spider-Man and Black Widow. When they tried to get to one of Octavius manufacturing plants of satellites, they defeated Sandman, but Octavius asked for help to all nations, due his position in the matter, to capture Spider-Man.[95]\n\nWhile Spider-Man and his allies continue to disarm Doc Ock's bases, defeating Rhino in the process, they are attacked by S.H.I.E.L.D. forces before they can capture him and are forced to flee. Octavius asked for help of other super villains to watch over his facilities over the world, but even after Spider-Man tracks down the final one, Octavius finally reveals he was going to destroy the world anyways, rather than save it. He activated his Octavian Lens, burning half of the world, including Silver Sable's country, Symkaria. But this is revealed to be a trick made by Mysterio (only burning a small portion of a city in Symkaria), while Chameleon uses a robot to fight Spider-Man, after they are defeated, Mysterio is convinced by Spider-Man to help him to catch Doctor Octopus in his base in Guatemala, but Octavius used the mind-controlled Avengers as his new Sinister Six.[96]\n\nSpider-Man, Sable and Widow managed to defeat the Avengers, then he and Sable headed to Octavius underwater base. They are faced by Rhino while the base starts to flood, he trapped Sable and left Spider-Man with two choices, to continue to fight him in order to save Sable from drowning (but Octavius would activate the lenses) or let him drown himself and Sable but stop Octopus. After leaving Sable to her death at her request, Spidey faced the Doctor in battle, and managed to destroy Octavius' arms and equipment before taking his foe away for medical assistance.[97]\n\nDying Wish[]\n\nUsing a brain-swapping Octobot, Otto Octavius transplanted his mind into the body of his nemesis Spider-Man. He retained all of Peter's memories, and thus was able to fool all of Peter's family and friends, from Mary Jane Watson and Aunt May to the Avengers. Peter's mind, meanwhile, was placed into Octavius' dying body.[28]\n\nAfter realizing Peter, in Doc Ock's body, escaped the Raft, Otto decided to keep every person Peter knew in a safe room in the Stark Tower and waited for Doctor Octopus alone there, by distracting the other Avengers with giant Octobots around the globe, knowing that Peter would seek for help from Tony Stark. Both enemies battled until both fell from the Tower into the ground, fatally wounding Peter (Otto's body). When Peter tried to use the brain swapping Octobot, Otto revealed him that he was using a Carbonadium helmet, making his brain totally inaccessible for changing brains. Otto declared his final victory against Parker by giving him a lethal punch which caused \"Doctor Octopus\" to give his last breaths.[98]\n\nBoth then discovered that the Octobot managed to connect their minds although it could not swap them, and Peter forced Otto to relive his most suffering experiences and memories as Spider-Man, making him realize the responsibility his power came with. Otto told Peter he did not want this, but they could not change bodies back. Finally, Otto promised Peter to continue his legacy both as Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Later, he not only realized he could become a better Spider-Man, but also a better man than who he once was as Doctor Octopus, to become a superior Spider-Man to Peter Parker.[29]\n\nSuperior Spider-Man[]\n\nBecoming a hero[]\n\nAfter Peter Parker died, Otto Octavius became the new \"Superior\" Spider-Man. One of his first actions, after upgrading the spider suit with computerized lenses, was to break into an old base which he had established during his time as Doctor Octopus. The base's defenses were coded to his original DNA, which he no longer possessed due to the body swap, and identified him as an intruder. It was during this battle that he had an epiphany that no matter how brilliant he had believed himself to be, Peter Parker had always defeated him. Spider-Man had always thwarted Doc Ock. Destroying his creations, Otto left the base and fully embraced his new role as Spider-Man.[99]\n\nAfter defeating the new Sinister Six,[30] and the returned Vulture, with numerous of Peter's friends noticing changes in \"Peter\"'s behavior, Octavius decided to become more efficient and utilized thousands of Spider-Bots to patrol the city thereby getting to crimes that Peter never could in his life.[100] Otto also enrolled at the Empire State University to get his (Peter's) doctorate.[101] As Peter he met Anna Maria Marconi, who offered to tutor Peter. Otto was initially annoyed that she thought he needed assistance but Anna not only surprised Otto with her intellect, but he also found himself falling in love with her, feelings mirrored by the young woman.\n\nDuring his time as Spider-Man, Otto shattered Scorpion's jaw, blinded the Vulture and killed the mass-murderer Massacre.[102] He also performed numerous involuntary acts, like stopping himself from killing Boomerang.[30] When the Avengers decided to examine Spider-Man to find a reason for his change of behavior,[103] they couldn't find anything. Otto attempted to use a neurolotic scanner to determine the source of several spasms his body was experiencing, that Dr. Elias Wirtham, aka Cardiac also needed. After agreeing to help Cardiac in surgery Otto could take the scanner with him. Afraid of his own discovery, Peter Parker almost prevented Otto from completing his surgery on a wounded little girl, which would have major consequences. After obtaining the scanner, Otto spotted a strange anomaly in his brain, and knew what it was: Peter Parker.[104]\n\nOtto figured out that Peter's consciousness was alive in his brain, and to his shock, Otto could now hear Peter inside his mind and decided to put an end to him once and for all.[104] Using a neurolitic scanner Otto started a mind-wipe, and finally managed to wipe Parker after dealing with him directly, by plunging himself into his brain. In the split-second of surgery, the moment Peter was truly selfish, that could give Otto the power to convince Peter of his own superiority, and finally Peter Parker was gone, or so, Otto thought.[105]\n\nFollowing the expel of Parker, Octavius helped Mayor Jameson assist the execution of Alistair Smythe,[106] and even though Smythe managed to temporarily take over the Raft,[107] Otto managed to defeat his allies, Vulture, Boomerang and Scorpion and kill the villain, secretly taking the Vulture captive himself. During the conflict, Jameson ordered Spider-Man to execute Smythe when he had escaped, using this evidence to blackmail Jameson, Spider-Man forced the Mayor to allow the Raft to become his new headquarters renamed \"Spider-Island 2\". With new foundations in which to build his own legacy, Octavius formed his own group of minions, the Spiderlings, and created giant Spider-Mechs,[108] and being one of Otto's newest measures the destruction of Shadowland.[109] Unknown to him, a new group of organized crime was being built by the hand of a new villain, the Goblin King.[110]\n\nSpider-Verse[]\n\nDuring the period where Otto went missing in Horizon Labs, he was transported to the year 2099 in an alternate universe. Whilst there, he was attacked by the Public Eye, until he was rescued by Gabe O'Hara. Otto then settled into Miguel O'Hara's old flat and programmed an AI in the form of Anna Maria. He decided to return to the present, and to do so by stealing equipment from Stark-Fujikawa and Alchemax (finding it amusing that Stark abided by the law whilst Alchemax sent everyone after him). When he attempted travels back in time, he does so but instead traveled to parallel universes, one with a recently deceased Spider-Man, including one where he found a Spider-Man who was part of the Fantastic Four (now Five), one still reconciling with the Superhero Registration Act, one living in the House of M reality as a famous mutant and another Spider-Man in a black iron clad armored-like suit, are all killed by a being with a unique, exotic energy source. Otto realized that someone was killing each universe's Spider-Man and so traveled to different universes. He eventually traveled to a universe with an Indian Spider-Man who was under attack by the being killing all the different Spider-Men, saving him and escaping back to 2099, revealing that Otto had already recruited several other Spider-Men, including Spider-Monkey, Spider-Man Noir, Six-Armed Spider-Man, and Spider-Girl. He next found and rescued a Spidey who left New York City and joined the Wolverine in Russia and recruited him to join in fighting back against the being hunting Spider-Men before they both escaped back to 2099.[13]\n\nOver time, Otto would gather an army of Spider-Man across the Multiverse against Karn and other similar hunters. His own team met up with a second Spider-Men team, which included Peter Parker from Earth-616. When informed of the existence of the Spider-Totems by Ezekiel Sims, Otto dismissed the notion of supernatural beings as a backwards superstition. When Daemos attacked, drawn to the presence of the Other and the Bride, two powerful Spider-Totems, Otto engaged in combat with Daemos and killed him. That turned out to be a clone, and the Spiders were forced to split up and flee when Daemos returned with reinforcements, killing several members of Otto's team. Afterwards, Otto declared that they were at war with the Inheritors and that he was now the leader of the Spiders, no questions asked.[111]\n\nThe Peter Parker from Earth-616 challenged his authority, stating that he had been named leader due to having fought the Inheritors before. Otto mocked Peter and received a punch to the face for his arrogance. The Superior and Amazing Spider-Men fought until Otto revealed that he believed Peter to be from before his takeover, which Peter exploited by surrendering and challenging Otto to prove his superiority by killing him. Otto refused, as he believed killing Peter would jeopardize his existence, and Peter defeated him with a single blow. To Otto's surprise, Peter helped him to his feet, admitting that he would need Otto's expertise and advice for the coming battle. Accepting his role as adviser, Otto suggested the Spider-Totems move from Central Park into the city but was opposed by Captain Universe, who stated they were safe as long as he was around. When Peter left with an away team to give a cloaking device to the injured Spider-Man Noir and gather more recruits, Otto half-jokingly challenged Spider-UK - who Peter had placed in charge until his return - to a fight for the position.[112]\n\nAfter Captain Universe and Japanese Spider-Man tried their best against Inheritors' leader, Solus, but failed, the Spider-Army relocated to Earth-3145 where they found that reality's Spider-Man, Ben Parker.[113] Otto was aghast that Earth-3145's Doctor Octopus was responsible for the desolation of that world, and when Peter made a comment regarding his holographic assistant's resemblance to Anna Maria, Otto realized that Peter was from later in Earth-616's timeline and therefore that he loses everything. When Peter failed to convince Uncle Ben to wear his costume one last time, Otto berated Ben for giving up and letting his world fall to ruin, convincing the old man to suit up one more time.[114]\n\nDuring the final battle against the Inheritors, Otto tried to take on Daemos, but had two of his mechanical legs ripped off. When Morlun sneered that Peter returning Benjy to Earth-982 was only prolonging the inevitable, Otto proclaimed that he had found a \"superior solution\" that Peter and the other Spiders were too blind and gutless to see, slitting the Master Weaver's throat to Morlun's and Peter's mutual horror. After the Inheritors were defeated, Otto overheard Miguel O'Hara state that the Web of Life and Destiny could be used to return them to their proper universes and times.[115] He proceeded to attack the Web, refusing to return to a world knowing the destiny it had in store for him, but even as the other Spiders returned to their worlds, the Spiders of Earth-616 banded together to oppose him, Peter proclaiming that Otto lost because he acknowledged that Peter was superior. With Karn agreeing to act as the Master Weaver- with the deceased Weaver apparently being his own future self- Otto was resigned to return to his home time with his memories of this battle erased, although he left instructions for \"Anna\" to reactivate in a hundred days.[116]\n\nSuperior Venom[]\n\nAfter a brief fight with Agent Venom, during which Octavius discovered that Flash Thompson was behind the symbiote,[117] Flash sought Peter's help in giving him a place to stay. Octavius eventually convinced Flash to allow him to perform a procedure that would give him robotic leg implants, though during the procedure he forcefully removed the symbiote from Flash. The symbiote, feeling isolated and scared, broke out of containment and bonded to Octavius, creating a \"Superior Venom\".[7]\n\nDespite claiming to be able to exert full control over a reluctant Venom symbiote, Otto became even more erratic than usual: he wounded Cardiac and fled, hoping to find a villain to physically overpower, proving his new-found might. Failing to do so, he started beating up and scaring petty criminals, until Anna Maria called him to be consoled, having been hurt over insensitive remarks Aunt May had made regarding her height. This prompted \"Peter\" to storm Aunt May's home, loudly berating her for her actions, then directing his anger towards MJ, guilty of having taken May's side. As soon as MJ tried to counter his anger, Otto was informed that some of the Hobgoblin's minions were robbing a bank and summoned the Venom symbiote, leaving while warning his former family to stay away from him.[118]\n\nAfter almost killing two of the robbers, Venom was confronted by the Avengers, who with the aid of Flash Thompson clad in an Iron Man Armor managed to defeat Octavius. Octavius realized that the symbiote had been eroding his control and it abruptly took over him, lashing out at Flash when he tried to convince it to return to him. Otto tried to cast the symbiote out but failed, prompting Peter Parker's consciousness to return to help him purge it before retreating back under the radar. Back as Spider-Man, Otto lied to the Avengers and Mary Jane that his behavior in the past months was due to microscopic fragments of the symbiote slowly multiplying within him. When the Avengers talked to Tony Stark about the test they previously conducted on Spider-Man and found nothing, Stark decided to check the data further, and discovered that all of it except the one he knew about had been erased by Spider-Man. With this in mind, Captain America proclaimed that they would need to bring Spider-Man in.[119] After being confronted by the Avengers once more because of the missing medial scans, Otto escaped.[120]\n\nGoblin Nation[]\n\n31 days later, Otto is surveying the city of New York, having it come under siege by the Goblin Underground. He realizes that he had been chasing the wrong goblins all this while, and that it was the Green Goblin that was behind everything that had transpired. Back at his apartment, Otto is troubled over how the Green Goblin managed to hack into his Spider-Bots, when Anna Maria comes in, concerned about him neglecting his health and employees at Parker Industries.\n\nDuring their conversation when Anna brings up the word \"recognize,\" Otto has a brainwave, and attempts to call Uatu Jackson about his facial recognition software, only to be ignored, forcing him to visit Jackson as Spider-Man, where the two discuss about the hacking. Otto then heads underground to locate the source of the transmission and runs straight into the Goblin King and his henchmen. To Otto's surprise, the Goblin King sends off his henchmen, and talks with Otto, revealing that he knew of his true identity all along, shocking Otto.\n\nThe Goblin King then offers Otto a partnership with the latter as his second. Enraged, Otto refuses and swears to liberate New York from his grip. Laughing, the Goblin King zaps Otto, only to realize that it was only a hologram that Otto projected of himself. The Goblin King then gives the command to destroy Spider-Island.[121]\n\nOtto is confused why the Goblin Army managed to get past his security grid. As the Goblin King mocks him, the Living Brain shields him from a blast. Otto notes with dismay that one of his favorite Spiderlings have been killed. Ordering a strategic retreat, Otto himself flees Spider-Island on the Living Brain and goes underwater to avoid pursuit.\n\nGetting back to Parker Industries, Otto met Sajani, who berates him for his absence. Just then, Wraith drops in and demands answers about Carlie from Otto, when Monster interrupts and knocks out Wraith, surprising Otto with her true identity. Otto and Sajani flee inside the facility, where Otto tells Sajani to split up. Cornering Monster, Otto's kick destroys her earpiece, preventing the Green Goblin from listening in. Monster pleads with Otto to use his brains to resolve the situation before the Green Goblin's plans are realized. While all this is happening, Otto is unaware that Anna has been kidnapped by Menace.[122]\n\nOtto, in his lab, makes a call to Mary Jane, telling her to stay safe. When Mary Jane mentions that Aunt May is stressing out, Otto tells her to deal with the situation before cutting off the conversation. He resumes his study on Monster, now restrained, in an attempt to cure her of the Goblin Serum without killing her, when suddenly, the Goblin King contacts him, telling him to put on his suit, and promises to show him interesting things. When Otto does so, the Goblin King projects images of the places he blows up one by one, including the house where Otto grew up, to the H.E.A.R.T clinic.\n\nOtto swears to kill the Goblin King, but the latter threatens Otto with the life of Anna Maria if he does not comply with his demands of heading to Empire State University, prompting Otto to think about how Peter Parker would have resolved this crisis. He quickly swings his way to the university, where he finds the captive to be Don Lamaze. Otto dismisses this as a joke, when the Goblin King attempts to flee.\n\nUnleashing his mechanical arms, Otto starts to attack, only to find that the Goblin King had hacked into his arms as well, causing them to strike at him instead. As the Goblin King makes his exit, Otto struggles with his arms, telling Lamaze to flee. However, when a stray arm threatens to strike at Otto's neck, Lamaze takes the fatal blow meant for Otto. With his dying breaths, Lamaze states that he helped Spider-Man as he had helped him and Anna when Stunner attacked, and in the process showed him what a true hero really was. Otto cradles Lamaze in his arms as the latter dies.\n\nSwearing to find the Goblin King, Otto's Spider-Sense goes off, and he is confronted by the new Spider-Slayers. Jameson, projecting his voice, declares that he will kill Spider-Man, much to Otto's shock. When Otto is pinned by one of them, he is saved by the arrival of Spider-Man 2099, who deactivated them with a remote. Otto is questioned by him regarding his actions of late, but before anything can happen, the Spider-Slayers are reactivated by the Goblin King, who has hacked into their systems as well, and promptly grab both Spider-Men by the head.[123]\n\nSuperior No More and Death[]\n\nThe Goblin King revealed Otto he had taken Anna Maria hostage, and he promptly started looking for her. Spider-Man was deceived by Menace into going to the subway, as she made him believe Maria was there. In the subway he found himself with the decision to save a young child, revealed to be Amy Chen. Otto hesitated, as there was a chance that by saving Amy, he would injure himself and fail to get back in the search for Maria. The consciousness of Peter Parker revealed his survival by pushing Otto into saving the child, as there was no time for planning but just doing what was right. Otto realized he had failed as a \"superior\" Spider-Man and decided Peter should take the control of his body back, as he could save Maria and stop the Goblin. Octavius arrived to what was left of Parker Industries and proceeded to erase his consciousness with the neurolytic scanner and let Peter Parker live fully once again, but in doing so, sacrificed himself for the girl he loved and the man he hated.[31]\n\nThe Return of Doc Ock[]\n\nDuring the battle against the Inheritors, upon discovering he was fated to die once he returned to his proper place in the past of his timeline, Otto Octavius used the technology he had acquired in 2099 to house a copy of his consciousness inside his gauntlets and programmed Anna's A.I. to enter sleep mode for one hundred days.[25]\n\nOne hundred days later, when Parker Industries collapsed,[124] Anna's A.I. reactivated and activated Otto's back-up consciousness, who then proceeded to merge the gauntlets into an Octobot, its mission being to regain control over Peter Parker's body, which he considered to be perfect. Fearing Parker would cast him out of his body again, Otto decided to house himself inside the Living Brain instead, and to wait for the right time to act.[25] Over the next several months, Otto worked for Peter Parker while plotting against him and his company whenever he had the chance.[125][126][127][128][25]\n\nWhen Parker decided to take a look at the Living Brain to see if there was any problem with it, Otto asked him how his former self's mind had been erased and went on a rampage after being told that he had sacrificed himself in order to give Peter full control over his own body to defeat the Goblin King, forcing Peter to shut the Living Brain down. However, Otto managed to activate the robot's self-destruction and escape through his Octobot body.[25]\n\nAs he believed Peter's body had somehow damaged his former self's mind, Otto gave up the idea of stealing it again and decided to get his biological body back by cloning and perfecting it, using New U Technologies' cloning procedure to do so.[25][129] But when he arrived at Potter's Field Cemetery to acquire the genetic material he needed from his corpse, Otto found out it had been stolen, which led him to investigate the graves of other criminals related to Spider-Man, such as the Spider-Slayer, and discover that the corpses had also been stolen.\n\nAccessing the web, Otto discovered New U Technologies was behind the disappearance of the bodies, as he had suspected, and secretly arranged for his former self's body to be delivered to New U Headquarters, where it was cloned. As the consciousness inhabiting Doctor Octopus' body at the time of its death was that of Spider-Man, a copy of Peter Parker's consciousness was created along with the cloned body, forcing Otto to fight and kill it in order to take control over the new body. Once he emerged from the vat the clone was inside, Otto had his tentacles returned to him by the Jackal, who was secretly the owner of New U Technologies, and became Doctor Octopus once again. Doctor Octopus later allied himself with the Jackal to help him solve the problem in his cloning process in exchange for the pills that would prevent his body from breaking down.[129]\n\nDead No More[]\n\nWhen Peter Parker infiltrated New U Headquarters as Spider-Man to uncover the truth behind its cloning procedure, Doctor Octopus ambushed him[130][129] and revealed the truth about himself to him, as well as his involvement with Parker Industries as the Living Brain. Having insulated himself from Spider-Man's new webbing types, Otto easily defeated Spider-Man but was stopped from finishing him off by the arrival of the Jackal, who forced him to stand down.[131]\n\nWhen Spectro infiltrated New U in order to help his girlfriend Silk uncover what was going on, Doctor Octopus captured him and conducted an experiment on him, implanting his ghost into a cloned body.[132]\n\nUsing the Jackal's cloning technology, Otto began to work on a project he termed the \"Proto Clone,\" splicing his own genetic material with Spider-Man's to create a hybrid body into which he planned to transfer his consciousness.[133][5] The Jackal attempted to make him put the project on hold so that they could relocate to a new location after Spider-Man and Spider-Gwen infiltrated the facility; but Otto refused, suggesting the Jackal just kill and resurrect them.\n\nFollowing the capture of Kaine, Otto began to work with the Lizard to ensure the Proto Clone would not succumb to the cellular degeneration that the other New U clones and Kaine suffered from, dismissing Connors' suggestion of a possible cure. Puzzling over Kaine's resilience in comparison to himself or Electro, he recognized Kaine's interdimensional transporter from his time in the Spider-Army, but was interrupted when Anna Maria was brought in. To Otto's dismay she was disgusted and enraged with him, making him wonder if she would have preferred if he had come back in a cloned body of Spider-Man. Realizing that the New U facility's shielding was slowing the clones' degeneration by blocking out certain frequencies, Otto and Anna Maria theorized that they could isolate the signals to either stop or accelerate the degenerative process.\n\nThe Jackal interrupted their research, and Otto explained that they had managed to isolate a frequency that accelerated the degeneration. However, when the Jackal insulted Anna Maria's height, Otto attacked him and discovered that the Jackal was a Spider-Clone. Furious at having been tricked, Otto broadcast the signal to trigger the clones' degeneration. When the Jackal started to broadcast the signal worldwide,[134] Otto continued to fight him even as their bodies began to break down. When Spider-Man arrived, he and Anna began work on isolating the signal to counteract the degeneration while Otto kept the Jackal (unmasked as Ben Reilly) occupied. Otto asked why Spider-Man would trust him, causing Peter to respond that he had been inside Otto's head and knew he was not all-bad. When the countersignal was broadcast, Otto shattered Ben's Webware, telling him they'd die together.[135]\n\nRealizing the Proto Clone was immune to the degeneration, Ben attempted to transfer his mind into it only to be electrocuted - a precaution that Otto had put in place. Otto transferred his consciousness into the Proto Clone, leaving his cloned body to decay into dust.[32]\n\nSuperior Octopus[]\n\nSecret Empire[]\n\nLater, Otto hitched a ride to one of his old bases only to learn it had been appropriated by Hydra in his absence. Furious over this and Peter's mismanagement of Parker Industries, Otto easily defeated the intruders but was approached by Arnim Zola, who offered an alliance in order to take down Parker Industries. Accepting to gain access to Hydra's manpower and resources, Otto constructed new and upgraded tentacles as well as a new suit patterned after his Superior Spider-Man costume, rebranding himself as the Superior Octopus.[5]\n\nShortly before Hydra launched its conquest of the United States, the Superior Octopus arranged a meeting with Spider-Man where he revealed his new identity to him and tried to convince him to relinquish control of Parker Industries. When Peter Parker refused the deal, the Superior Octopus had Hydra agents blow up the London branch of Parker Industries.[33] Superior Octopus made plans to also destroy the Shanghai branch of Parker Industries,[136] but Octavius was ultimately foiled when Peter had those at Shanghai destroy everything in the building, obliterating the Webware technology and ultimately taking down Parker Industries itself. Octavius used an EMP to destroy the Spider-Armor MK IV, only to be confronted with Spider-Man in his original costume. Spider-Man turned the tables on Octavius and short-circuited his tentacles, forcing him to retreat, losing his arms and mask in the process.[137]\n\nBy the time Hydra had taken over the nation, the Superior Octopus became a member of Hydra's own Avengers.[138] Otto was present during the final battle between Hydra and the resistance in Washington, D.C., but fell when his fellow teammate Odinson turned against Hydra's Avengers.[139]\n\nGo Down Swinging[]\n\nAfter Norman Osborn became the Red Goblin by bonding with the Carnage symbiote, he infected his grandson Normie Osborn with it and sent him to kill May Reilly in order to emotionally hurt Spider-Man. Octopus still possessed Parker's memories and they motivated him to protect May from Normie. He was aided by J. Jonah Jameson with a remotely piloted Spider-Slayer, though Jameson initially thought Octopus was a partner of Osborn. When Osborn arrived to retrieve Normie, he took both Octopus and the Spider-Slayer out and attempted to kill May with a barrage of darts, but Octopus jumped in front of them. After being healed by Agent Anti-Venom, Octopus assumed the alias of \"Elliot Tolliver\" and went on to work for Horizon University, where Anna Marconi (who noticed something familiar about him) was also working. With its technology, Otto intended to reclaim his title as the Superior Spider-Man.[14]\n\nSuperior Spider-Man in San Francisco[]\n\nSpider-Geddon[]\n\nCombining the Jackal's and Jennix's cloning technology, Otto created a set of duplicate bodies he could upload his conscious into should his current body be killed.[9] The Web-Warriors and Ultimate Spider-Man attacked his lab to destroy them - fearing the Inheritors could use them to escape their prison - Otto fought them, smugly stating that was impossible and that they should have killed the Inheritors like he'd suggested in the first place. The Web-Warriors' fears were confirmed when Otto's system was confirmed to have been hacked by Jennix, who created new bodies for himself, Morlun, and Verna. Otto was nearly consumed by Jennix, who tossed him aside when he realized he wasn't a pure Spider-Totem.[140]\n\nOctavia Otto, a female counterpart of Otto from another Earth, programmed Otto's lab to explode in order to destroy the cloning tubes. Unfortunately, during the battle, Verna acquired Gwen's dimensional travel watch, trapping her in another dimension and assembling her family. The remaining spiders returned to Karn, arguing what to do with the Inheritors, dividing opinions and causing a discussion. However, Karn suggested to stop wasting time arguing and get other spiders to fight the Inheritors. With his costume damaged, Otto returned to his lab with Octavia and Spider-Punk and changed to a replica of the second version of the Superior Spider-Man's Suit. Returning to his Superior Spider-Man identity, Otto recruited Kaine, presuming that he still possessed the Other, who informed the former that he did not. Kaine suggested they also recruit Ben Reilly, but Otto refused. They go back to his lab, unaware that Ben swung through the portal.[6]\n\nLater, Otto recruited the Spider-Man of Earth-1048, defeating the villain Tarantula in the process. For unknown reasons, he left a Spider-Bot in that Earth when learning of the status of that world's Otto Octavius.[141] Otto and Peter later recruited the Spider-Man of Earth-51778. When his team was all assembled, Ben Reilly, the former Jackal, revealed himself to them and offered his help. Though he declined at first, Otto realized he could help a lot since he created the cloning tubes the Inheritors are using. Miles contacted them and said his team was planning an attack, forcing some of the Superior Spider-Army's Spider-People to rescue them.[142]\n\nThey managed to retreat to their base, with Spider-Man, an alternate spider-version of Norman Osborn from Earth-44145, having a discussion with Otto, suggesting he take over the leadership. Their disagreement led Norman and Spiders-Man to separate from the group; however, Norman destroyed the Web of Life and Destiny to leave the Inheritors trapped in Earth-616. When the Inheritors retrieved the crystal containing Solus' soul, since they planned to use the Jackal's cloning technology to revive their father but couldn't do it without the crystal. After his resurrection, Otto would give Ben to Jennix feast on him in order to acquire his knowledge about the cloning tubes.[143]\n\nHowever, this was just a plan to destroy Jennix's \"maniacal mind\" since he was forced to see through Ben's point of view all the times he died and was resurrected. Fortunately, shortly after realizing his plan, the Spider-People appeared, with Miles Morales now with the power of the Enigma Force. Otto revived Ben, and later, Peter arrived and decided to lend the leadership to Otto, meaning Miles killing Solus with Earth-51778's Spider-Man's sword Vigor. After realizing Solus put the hunger in his sons, they decided to create new clone baby bodies to the Inheritors, without their hunger and their past life memory, who would later be adopted by Spider-Ma'am.[144]\n\nReturn to Heroics[]\n\nOtto as Spider-Man defeated Stilt-Man on his way to deliver a speech as Elliot Tolliver at Horizon University and afterwards reflected on his past. Later in the evening he met up with Night Shift members Digger and Dansen Macabre to defeat a cult dedicated to Master Pandemonium. The next day he was confronted at Horizon by Anna Maria, who had deduced he was actually Otto Octavius and not really Elliot Tolliver. She was going to turn him over to the police but changed her mind when Terrax the Tamer attacked San Francisco.[34] The Superior Spider-Man confronted Terrax alongside the Night Shift, but was abandoned by his allies when Digger was bisected. He continued to fight a losing battle while Anna Maria built and delivered an Inductors device that allowed him to drain some of Terrax's Power Cosmic.[145] Spider-Man reentered the battle infused with cosmic energy, but Terrax was still more skilled in its use. The former Herald was eventually defeated when Otto and Anna work together to reprogram Terrax's Axe to backfire on him. After the battle, Anna agreed to allow Otto to continue his hero career, but only if she were his chaperone.[146]\n\nAt the urging of Anna, Otto participated in the disaster relief in San Francisco as the Superior Spider-Man. Throughout the course of the day he began to realize the value of civilians through his different interactions. Afterwards he was invited on a date by Emma Hernandez and agreed.[147] Otto's date with Emma went well until he revealed his true identity, which caused her to flee from his apartment. He followed her as Spider-Man, and they were confronted by police officers possessed by Master Pandemonium's demons and Emma was possessed as well. Otto contacted Doctor Strange for aid, who initially attacked him before being shown the demonic infestation. By combining their efforts, they were able to track down and confront Master Pandemonium.[148] The pair of doctors ended up defeating Pandemonium by swapping equipment, but Strange refused to wipe Emma's memory for him afterwards; however, Anna Maria helped him convince Emma to keep his identity a secret because he had saved her.[149]\n\nWar of the Realms[]\n\nWhen Frost Giants invaded San Francisco, Superior Spider-Man saved its citizens by transferring them into a limbo state using experimental technology. He then decided to team up with the West Coast Avengers in order to make use of Ms. America's abilities. After he rescued them in Los Angeles using his Octavian Lens, he managed to convince them of his plan to stop the war at its source in the Asgardian Realms; however, they needed to travel to New York City to find a way there, as magic was interfering with Ms. America's powers.[150] They arrived amidst a battle between the Fantastic Four and Malekith's forces where Otto was able to work with Mister Fantastic to develop a way to allow Ms. America to duplicate the energies of the Bifrost. They failed to locate the Svartalfheim strike team so they moved on to the Jotunheim Strikeforce, who convinced Otto to trust them and focus on protecting Midgard. He then returned to New York to protect its citizens alongside the West Coast Avengers.[151][152][153]\n\nDoctor Octopus Once More[]\n\nTargeted by the Norman Osborn Spider-Man of Earth-44145, who sought to destroy Otto's life in revenge for having insulted him during the second Totem War, Otto was approached by Mephisto, who offered him a way to defeat Norman.[154] Despite Anna Maria begging him not to throw away the good inside himself, Otto accepted Mephisto's bargain and was restored to his original body and state of mind from before he ever mind-swapped with Peter Parker.[2] (An alternate universe variant of Otto later claimed to be the one who magically and clandestinely convinced him to accept Mephisto's deal.)[155] A spare cloned body was used as a decoy to fool Norman, and later buried as Elliot Tolliver.[35]\n\nAs is typical with Mephisto, the details of this deal are somewhat confusing. Otto has seemingly lost all of Peter Parker's memories but retained all of the ones since he was duplicated after the battle against the Inheritors. For instance, though Otto did not remember Peter's identity or the events from the first time he was the Superior Spider-Man, he remembered his alliance with the Jackal through the War of the Realms, and people such as Anna Maria, from the New U crisis to the present. This also meant that while he remembered being a hero, he now associated more with villainy, just as he did before the initial mind-swap. The deal also included restoring Otto's body to perfect shape, not only fixing the damage of all fights as Octopus, but also the brain damage he suffered while becoming Octopus — \"if any.\" This suggested that Mephisto was convinced the brain damage was a false excuse and Otto would return to criminal behavior regardless.[2]\n\nSinister War[]\n\nWhile in a quest to fill the missing gaps in his memory, Otto was forced into the service of the demon Kindred.[156] Kindred instructed Otto to reform the Sinister Six, for which he recruited Sandman,[157] revived Electro,[158] and enlisted the new Kraven the Hunter.[159] Forcing the Isotope Genome Accelerator on Dr. Curt Connors, Otto separated the scientist's Lizard side into a separate entity for his team. The final member, chosen by Kindred, was Mysterio,[160] who the Sinister Six retrieved from the premiere of a film he had directed under a false identity. The team briefly clashed with the Savage Six, who had also intercepted the premiere to enact revenge on Mysterio. Spider-Man became involved in the fray, and Octavius knocked him down to deliver him to Kindred, whose torment was the demon's endgame.[161]\n\nDoctor Octopus and the Sinister Six were then forced to participate in a hunt for Spider-Man, competing against other teams assembled by Kindred, including the Syndicate, Wild Pack, and the Savage Six.[162] At one point during the battle royale, Doctor Octopus had Spider-Man in his grasp but hesitated to kill him long enough for the Savage Six to interfere, giving Spider-Man the chance to escape.[163] Realizing that Kindred wouldn't give him the answers he seeked, Otto used Black Ant's helmet signal to kill the centipedes that Kindred was using to control him and the other villains during the fight, leaving all of them unconscious and saving Spider-Man. The hero thanked him, but Otto claimed that he was just getting revenge on Kindred for not going through with their agreement before leaving.[164]\n\nBeyond Corporation[]\n\nWhile reuniting with and helping May Parker find a cure for Peter to awaken him from his coma, they come across a company called Infinite Solutions. This intrigues Otto, and upon further investigation, he discovers it is a shell company for the Beyond Corporation, which is utilizing Parker Industries' technology - his technology. Otto reacts with smugly saying that he'll show Beyond who's superior.[165]\n\nSuperior Four[]\n\nWhen Mayor Wilson Fisk started a war against vigilantism and super heroes as part of a vendetta against Daredevil, Otto started working for him while secretly having his own ulterior motives. After having Reed Richards and Sue Storm imprisoned, Fisk gave the Baxter Building to Otto.[166] Otto helped Fisk by creating a device that would use the imprisoned the Purple Man to coerce people within New York into voting for him so that Wilson would win the elections again. Otto used the multiversal technology from Reed's lab to summon three versions of himself from other universes, creating an unstoppable group.[167] Ock tried to campaign against Fisk in his mayoral race by having the Chameleon pose as Tony Stark and win the elections. However, Stark was outvoted when the heroes choose Luke Cage as their candidate. Otto also planned to attack the Mayor with his Superior Four but was interrupted by the heroes doing the exact same thing, which lead to a fight that gained Fisk's attention.[168]\n\nAfter his deal with Mephisto regressed what he considered to be an evolution of his baser self, Otto hoped to create a council of Ocks across the multiverse and control everything. Traveling to Earth-5069, Otto soon realized that he wasn't a fixed variant in the multiverse like Spider-Man or Iron Man. Otto and his variants decided to wage war against any other version of themselves from the Multiverse in order to create a destructive wave across the multiverse in hopes that it would branch and create dozens of new Ock variants. Starting at Earth-2902, where they killed Spider-Ock, with Otto absorbing his entire intellect, making his own mind grow.[169] The assassination of Spider-Ock left Otto exhilarated, which worried his other variants who quickly tried to stop him, leading to a fight where the Superior Four were forcibly transported to another earth before being yanked out by Otto von Strange, the Supreme Octopus. His other three variants surrendered themselves to this superior foe while Ock and was imprisoned in the magician's Supreme Sanctorum.[170] Otto was freed from his confinement by a mysterious plant creature that seemed to be another one of his variants. The plant bonded with Otto and he claimed that this new variant was created from the blood he dropped into the biological Wasteland of Earth-5069. Otto and his Man-Thing variant rescued the Superior Four and together they defeated Supreme Ock. The Superior Four returned to Earth-616 hoping to stay and rid New York of all crime, but not before leaving the Man-Thing Otto on Earth-2902 where he acted as a new Spider-Ock.[155]\n\nThe failed attempt by the heroes to kill Fisk, allowed Otto Octavius to keep the city under surveillance with his \"anti-crime\" drones. Happy to leave Fisk in his useless Mayor seat while he made the world better.[171] Fisk eventually turned on Ock, and while Otto had a neural blocker that protected him from the Purple Man's powers, his variants did not. Otto saw how his variants joined the mind-controlled Thunderbolt Units as a super-charged Killgrave was let loose on the streets.[172] During the battle against the Purple Man, Otto was knocked out by Iron Man and later arrested."
