        "text": "Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which your immune system mistakenly damages healthy cells in your body. Types include rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and some thyroid conditions.\n\nYour immune system usually protects you from diseases and infections. When it senses these pathogens, it creates specific cells to target foreign cells.\n\nUsually, your immune system can tell the difference between foreign cells and your cells.\n\nBut if you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system mistakes parts of your body, such as your joints or skin, as foreign. It releases proteins called autoantibodies that attack healthy cells.\n\nSome autoimmune diseases target only one organ. Type 1 diabetes damages your pancreas. Other conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, can affect your whole body.\n\nBelow we provide an overview of some of the most common autoimmune diseases.\n\nResearchers have identified more than 100 autoimmune diseases. Here are 14 more common ones.\n\n1. Type 1 diabetes\n\nYour pancreas produces the hormone insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar levels. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys insulin-producing cells in your pancreas.\n\nHigh blood sugar from type 1 diabetes can damage the blood vessels and organs. This can include your:\n\nheart\n\nkidneys\n\neyes\n\nnerves\n\n2. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\n\nIn RA, your immune system attacks the joints. This causes symptoms affecting the joints such as:\n\nswelling\n\nwarmth\n\nsoreness\n\nstiffness\n\nWhile RA more commonly affects people as they get older, it can also start as early as your 30s. A related condition, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, can start in childhood.\n\n3. Psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis\n\nSkin cells grow and then shed when they’re no longer needed. Psoriasis causes skin cells to multiply too quickly. The extra cells build up and form inflamed patches. On lighter skin tones, patches may appear red with silver-white scales of plaque. On darker skin tones, psoriasis may appear purplish or dark brown with gray scales.\n\nUp to 30% of people with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis. This can cause joint symptoms that include:\n\nswelling\n\nstiffness\n\npain\n\n4. Multiple sclerosis\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) damages the protective coating surrounding nerve cells (myelin sheath) in your central nervous system. Damage to the myelin sheath slows the transmission speed of messages between your brain and spinal cord to and from the rest of your body.\n\nThis damage can lead to:\n\nnumbness\n\nweakness\n\nbalance issues\n\ntrouble walking\n\nDifferent forms of MS progress at different rates. Difficulties with walking are one of the most common mobility issues with MS.\n\n5. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\n\nAlthough doctors in the 1800s first described lupus as a skin disease because of the rash it commonly produces, the systemic form, which is most common, actually affects many organs. This can include your:\n\njoints\n\nkidneys\n\nbrain\n\nheart\n\nCommon symptoms can include:\n\njoint pain\n\nfatigue\n\nrashes\n\n6. Inflammatory bowel disease\n\nIBD describes conditions that cause inflammation in the lining of the intestinal wall. Each type of IBD affects a different part of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n\nCrohn’s disease can inflame any part of your GI tract, from the mouth to the anus.\n\nUlcerative colitis affects the lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum.\n\nCommon symptoms of IBD can include:\n\ndiarrhea\n\nabdominal pain\n\nbleeding ulcers\n\n7. Addison’s disease\n\nAddison’s disease affects the adrenal glands, which produce the hormones cortisol and aldosterone as well as androgen hormones. Too little cortisol can affect how your body uses and stores carbohydrates and sugar (glucose). Too little aldosterone can lead to sodium loss and excess potassium in your bloodstream.\n\nCommon symptoms of Addison’s disease can include:\n\nweakness\n\nfatigue\n\nweight loss\n\nlow blood sugar\n\n8. Graves’ disease\n\nGraves’ disease attacks the thyroid gland in your neck, causing it to produce too much of its hormones. Thyroid hormones control the body’s energy usage, known as metabolism.\n\nHaving too much of these hormones revs up your body’s activities, causing symptoms that may include:\n\nrapid heart rate (tachycardia)\n\nheat intolerance\n\nunintentional weight loss\n\nswelling of the thyroid gland (goiter)\n\nSome people with Graves’ disease may also experience symptoms affecting the skin (Graves’ dermopathy) or eyes (Graves’ ophthalmopathy).\n\n9. Sjögren’s disease\n\nThis condition attacks the glands that provide lubrication to your eyes and mouth.\n\nThe hallmark symptoms of Sjögren’s disease are dry eyes and dry mouth, but it may also affect your joints or skin.\n\n10. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis\n\nIn Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, thyroid hormone production slows to a deficiency. Common symptoms of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can include:\n\nweight gain\n\nsensitivity to cold\n\nfatigue\n\nhair loss\n\nswelling of the thyroid (goiter)\n\n11. Myasthenia gravis\n\nMyasthenia gravis affects nerve impulses that help the brain control muscles. When the communication from nerves to muscles is impaired, signals can’t direct the muscles to contract.\n\nThe most common symptom is muscle weakness. It may worsen with activity and improve with rest. Muscle weakness can also affect:\n\neye movements\n\nopening and closing eyes\n\nswallowing\n\nfacial movements\n\n12. Celiac disease\n\nPeople with celiac disease can’t eat foods containing gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and other grain products. When gluten is in the small intestine, the immune system attacks this part of the GI tract and causes inflammation.\n\nPeople with celiac disease may experience digestive issues after consuming gluten. Symptoms can include:\n\nvomiting\n\ndiarrhea\n\nconstipation\n\nabdominal bleeding\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, celiac disease affects about 1% of people in the world.\n\n13. Autoimmune vasculitis\n\nAutoimmune vasculitis happens when your immune system attacks blood vessels. The inflammation that results narrows your arteries and veins, allowing less blood to flow through them.\n\n14. Pernicious anemia\n\nPernicious anemia may happen when an autoimmune disorder causes your body to not produce enough of a substance called intrinsic factor. Having a deficiency in this substance reduces the amount of vitamin B12 your small intestine absorbs from food. It can cause a low red blood cell count.\n\nWithout enough of this vitamin, you’ll develop anemia, and your body’s ability for proper DNA synthesis will be altered.\n\nIt can cause symptoms that include:\n\nfatigue\n\nweakness\n\nheadaches\n\nThis rare autoimmune disease typically occurs in people ages 60 to 70 and older."
