        "text": "South Africa, a country located at the southernmost tip of Africa, shares its borders with six countries as well as the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Namibia lies to the northwest, Botswana to the north, and Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Eswatini (Swaziland) to the northeast. A completely enclosed sovereign state, Lesotho, lies within its interior. The total area of South Africa amounts to 1,221,037 km2 (471,445 mi2).\n\nThe country's coastal borders extend for more than 2,800 km (1,770 mi) along the southwestern edge of the African continent. The Indian Ocean lies to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest. Where these two oceans converge, the warm Agulhas current from the Indian Ocean mixes with the cool Benguela current from the Atlantic, along the ecologically rich, fluctuating, Agulhas Front.\n\nNotable Landmarks: Table Mountain is a notable geographical landmark in South Africa. It is a flat-topped mountain that is part of the Table Mountain National Park. It overlooks the city of Cape Town on the southwestern coast and it attracts many visitors. Additionally, a notable example of South African terrain and wildlife is exhibited by Kruger National Park, a 19,623 km2 (7,576 mi2) game reserve in the northeastern corner of the country.The Highveld, a plateau region in the interior, sits at an elevation of about 1,200 m (3,937 ft). It tapers off to the Bushveld towards the north, which extends into the Limpopo River basin. The Lowveld, another major geographical area, rests to the northeast of the Highveld.\n\nThe Eastern Highlands run along the edge of the Highveld, featuring notable mountain ranges like the Drakensberg. These mountains include some of the highest peaks in Africa south of Kilimanjaro, with heights reaching up to 3,482 m (11.423 feet).\n\nThe Western Cape, meanwhile, has the Cape Fold Mountains, creating a series of parallel ranges that run east-west along the coast. This region features the Fynbos biome, which includes a large proportion of endemic plant species.Bodies of Water: In terms of water bodies, the country has few natural lakes, but an extensive system of reservoirs and dams, like the Gariep Dam on the Orange River, the largest in the country. Additionally, South Africa's eastern coast is dotted with estuaries, which play an essential role in local ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and serving as nurseries for several species of fish.\n\nSeveral significant rivers flow across the country's expanse. The largest, the Orange River, stretches about 2,200 km (1,367 mi), originating from the Drakensberg Mountains and meandering westwards to discharge into the Atlantic Ocean. Other crucial rivers include the Limpopo, serving as a border between South Africa and Zimbabwe, and the Vaal, a significant tributary of the Orange River and an essential water source for the densely populated Gauteng province."
