        "text": "Cape Town City Centre at a glance\n\nAffectionately known as the 'Mother City', Cape Town lies in the arms of Table Mountain, more often than not shrouded in cloud and one of the world's most recognisable landmarks. The heart of Cape Town, her centre is one of the only major CBDs in South Africa. The eclectic mix of Cape Town's city centre is home to historically significant areas such as Oranjezicht, Tamboerskloof, Gardens, Bo Kaap and District 6. The heady mix of both cultural and natural attractions is irresistible and as such, property in the CBD is always in demand.\n\nA brief history of the area\n\nCape Town is one of South Africa's most historically important cities. It was here, in the Mother City, where the first European colonists set foot in South Africa-which also marked the beginning of the South African slave trade. It was home to perhaps the world's most famous political prisoner-Nelson Mandela-who was held on the tiny Robben Island in Table Bay. Table Mountain and the surrounding area was home to the Khoisan people long before the first Europeans arrived. They called the city //Hui !Gaeb, and they were skilled and industrious people with an unmatched knowledge of the local fauna and flora. They also gave Table Mountain its first name: Hoerikwaggo, or \"Mountain in the sea\".\n\nClimate\n\nCape Town has a Mediterranean climate and as such has cold wet winters and warm dry summers. While winters in the burbs might be dreary, the fantastic restaurant specials, theatres and cozy bars are enough to lure city dwellers out to explore. In summer, stroll through the historic company gardens and explore Bree, Long, and Loop Street, home to vintage boutiques, cafes and clubs.\n\nSchools in the area\n\nThere are local and international schools in Cape Town's city. Jan Van Riebeeck, The German International School, St Syprians, The American International School and Struben House are all popular choices with others on the Atlantic Seaboard like Reddam House not far behind.\n\nHealthcare in the area\n\nCape Town has world-class healthcare facilities and is, in fact, home to the hospital where the first heart transplant took place. The Netcare hospital is brand new, and the Mediclinic in Gardens also provides excellent care. There are also a wealth of GPs, dentists, plastic surgeons and alternative therapists in and around the CBD.\n\nShopping centres\n\nThere are plenty of shopping centres in Cape Town, with Gardens Centre and Kloof Street Lifestyle centre firm favourites with locals. For a mall experience, one can head to the nearby V&A Waterfront or head out to Century City just off the N1.\n\nDistance from key points (Airports/CBD)\n\nCape Town is about 20 minutes from Cape Town International Airport. It's just 10 minutes away from the V&A Waterfront.\n\nRestaurants\n\nPart of why visitors and locals love Cape Town city is because of its reputation for excellent, world-class restaurants. The Pot Luck Club, Test Kitchen, Chef's Warehouse, Kloof Street House and Thali are all excellent choices for a fine dining experience, with other smaller spots like Bootleggers, and Jason's great for coffee and pastries.\n\nSpecial attractions\n\nThere are so many special attractions in Cape Town that it's hard to know where to begin. There is the theatre scene, and the iconic Artscape Theatre is the leader with Fugard not far behind. There are plenty of historically important sites, and the Iziko Museums and District Six Museum that commemorate them. Art galleries too, abound, with the National Art Gallery in the equally famous Company Gardens. Famous roads like Long Street are fantastic to explore, and of course, Table Mountain is ready to be climbed, or explored via the Cable Car.\n\nMake Cape Town your home. Let it be your story.\n\nThere are so many varied spots to choose from within the Cape Town city centre. Penthouse suites, bachelor pads, cozy historical cottages, and expansive homes. If you crave city living with a unique spin, Cape Town city centre is for you. Let Seeff Atlantic Seaboard and City Bowl find you your perfect investment property or new and exciting place to live."
