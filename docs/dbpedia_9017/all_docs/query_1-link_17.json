        "text": "What is the Capital of South Africa? It turns out, the answer is not as easy as one might think.\n\nThe Republic of South Africa does not have a single capital city. Instead, it is one of a few countries in the world that divides its governmental powers among three of its major cities: Pretoria, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein.\n\nWhen the Union of South Africa was created, different parties had different views on the appropriate city for the capital. Some expressed concern that allowing a single city to hold all branches of government could lead to too much power for one place. Thus, the developing nation placed the three branches of government in three different capital cities.\n\nThe Three Capitals of South Africa\n\nSouth Africa’s three capital cities are strategically placed throughout the country, each hosting a separate segment of the nation’s government. When asked about a single capital, most people would point to Pretoria.\n\nPretoria is the administrative capital. It is home to the executive branch of the South African government, including the President of the Cabinet. The city also hosts many departments of government and foreign embassies.\n\nLocated in the province of Gauteng, Pretoria is in the northeast part of South Africa and near the city of Johannesburg.\n\nCape Town is the legislative capital. It is home to the country’s legislative parliament, including the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces.\n\nLocated in the southwest corner of South Africa in the province of Western Cape, Cape Town is the second largest city in population.\n\nBloemfontein is considered the judicial capital. It is home to the Supreme Court of Appeal, the second highest court in South Africa. The Constitutional Court (the highest court) is located in Johannesburg.\n\nLocated in the province of Free State, Bloemfontein is in the center of South Africa.\n\nThere is a logic behind choosing these three cities:\n\nBoth Bloemfontein and Pretoria were capital cities of one of the traditional Boer provinces prior to the Union of South Africa. Bloemfontein was the capital of the Orange Free State (now Free State) and Pretoria was the capital of Transvaal. There were four traditional provinces in total; Natal and Cape of Good Hope were the other two.\n\nBloemfontein is located in the center of South Africa, so it is logical to place the judicial branch of government in this location.\n\nPretoria had long been the home to foreign embassies and governmental departments. Its location near the country’s largest city of Johannesburg also makes it a convenient location.\n\nCape Town had been host to a parliament since colonial days.\n\nIn addition to these three capitals on the national level, the country is divided into nine provinces, each with their own capital city.\n\nEastern Cape: capital Bhisho\n\nFree State: Bloemfontein\n\nGauteng: Johannesburg\n\nKwaZulu-Natal: Pietermaritzburg\n\nLimpopo – Polokwane\n\nMpumalanga: Nelspruit\n\nNorthern Cape: Kimberley\n\nNorth West: Mahikeng (formerly Mafeking)\n\nWestern Cape: Cape Town\n\nWhat is the Capital of South Africa? It Could Change…\n\nIn 2016, President Jacob Zuma called on Parliament to consider consolidating the capitals, stating it was not practical to maintain capitals in both Cape Town and Pretoria, as these two capitals are located on opposite sides of the country. President Zuma has noted that maintaining two houses, two cars, and two households in order to properly execute the duties of government officials, is an “unnecessary cost.”\n\nThe idea of consolidating capitals was first proposed by the late former president Nelson Mandela, who commissioned a study in 1997. The study found that if the capital was consolidated in Pretoria, over 1,400 parliamentary staff and their families would have to be relocated.\n\nWestern Cape Premier Helen Zille responded by proposing the country consolidate the capital in Cape Town. Zille noted the country could save money by housing government employees in apartments in government buildings.\n\nSo what is the capital of South Africa? For now, it remains a question with three answers. But that could change.\n\nSources and Further Reading"
