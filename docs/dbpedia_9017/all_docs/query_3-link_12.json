        "text": "Cape Town has a terrific mixture of areas to live, from vibrant city-living to quiet, leafy residential suburbs. The city is known for its successful property market.\n\nIn recent years Cape Town’s property values and sales transactions have exceeded Johannesburg’s and continue to attract international property investors.\n\nTake some time to explore our neighbourhoods and get close to the people and places which make our city so special.\n\nBellville\n\nOriginally known as the “12th milepost”, the area that is Bellville today was exactly 12 miles from Cape Town.\n\nBo Kaap\n\nOn the slopes on Signal hill, facing Cape Town, lies a vibrant and colourful neighbourhood\n\nknown as the Bo-Kaap.\n\nBlouberg\n\nIf you head out along Table Bay in Cape Town, one of the last spots you will find before leaving Cape Town is Blouberg.\n\nCamps Bay\n\nAs with most upmarket and trendy spots around the world, this beautiful place called Camps Bay comes from humble beginnings.\n\nCape Town CBD\n\nThis ever inviting city is perfect for tourists, expats and locals alike.\n\nClaremont\n\nSituated below the Majestic Table Mountain and tucked cosily between Newlands and Rondebosch is the lovely Claremont.\n\nDe Waterkant\n\nSitting between the CBD of Cape Town and the popular V&A Waterfront is the charming, welcoming and sought after DeWaterkant.\n\nDurbanville\n\nWhen most people think of South African wine, the names Stellenbosch and Franschhoek get thrown around a lot, but what most visitors won’t know is that Durbanville is where the locals are going.\n\nGugulethu\n\nSituated 15 km from the city centre of Cape Town is a bustling hive of local flavour called Gugulethu: one of the original townships established in Cape Town in the 1960s.\n\nHout Bay\n\nPicture an old fishing seaside suburb with lush green forests towered over by the beautiful Cape mountains and only 25 Km’s from the city centre, and that just about summarises Hout Bay for anyone who hasn’t been there.\n\nKalk Bay\n\nThis quaint and colourful sea-side fishing village is only 30 minutes drive from Cape Town city centre, and it is hard to imagine that you are in one of South Africa’s largest cities when visiting Kalk Bay.\n\nKhayelitsha\n\nKhayelitsha is the largest township in Cape Town and is home to more of the working class locals than anywhere else.\n\nKommetijie & Scarborough\n\nKommetjie and Scarborough are the perfect destinations for people wanting to experience nature and not wanting to stay in the City.\n\nLanga\n\nAbout 15 km from the city centre is the oldest informal settlement in Cape Town, called Langa and no trip to Cape Town would be complete without a visit here.\n\nMitchell’s Plain\n\nSituated on the outskirts of Cape Town facing the majestic False Bay is an unassuming place called Mitchell’s Plain.\n\nMuizenberg\n\nMost famous for surfing and sharks, Muizenberg is an interesting place to visit.\n\nNewlands\n\nNestled on the foothills of Table Mountain, lies a leafy green suburb called Newlands.\n\nNoordhoek\n\nJust 35 minutes drive from Cape Town city centre, you will find the tranquil, green and lush countryside of Noordhoek.\n\nObservatory\n\nObservatory or “Obz” as it is affectionately known, is a mostly student orientated suburb situated just outside of the city centre of Cape Town.\n\nRondebosch\n\nThis leafy green suburb nestled below the slopes of Table mountain has been home to most of the University of Cape town’s students for many years, but there is much to know and see in this beautiful suburb.\n\nSea Point\n\nHome to South Africa’s oldest lighthouse, great ice cream and Cape Town’s popular promenade.\n\nSimon’s Town\n\nHome to the Naval base of South Africa, the most popular penguin colony at Boulders Beach and right by the Cape Point National Park, there is much to see and do in Simon’s Town.\n\nStellenbosch\n\nSouth Africa’s second oldest town is most famous for its bold red wines, like with most things though there is much more to this quaint town than first meets the eye.\n\nWoodstock\n\nThis quirky area is only situated about 2 kilometres from the city centre and is an eclectic mix of colonial buildings with hip new thrift shops and the best street art in Cape Town."
