        "text": "Not for nothing is Cape Town’s city centre called the ‘city bowl’ by locals. The heart of Africa’s favourite city sits in a shallow basin hemmed in by the dramatic backdrop of Table Mountain, Signal Hill and the harbour. Head for Table Mountain for the best city views but you don’t even have to go up to the top: the views from the lower cable car station are amazing enough.\n\nIt’s a small city centre but it’s safe, busy and there’s plenty to do. Indeed, one of the major advantages of staying in central Cape Town is your proximity to Cape Town’s best-loved institutions. Chat to the flower sellers of Adderley Street and the market stall holders of Greenmarket Square; grab a coffee on bustling Long Street and then wander down to the museums (the District Six museum is especially good) or simply take a stroll around the Company’s Garden. Central Cape Town is also just a few minutes drive away from the ever-popular V&A Waterfront.\n\nThe city’s small size has another advantage: in just fifteen minutes you could be on one side of the mountain sunning yourself on one of the city’s famous beaches or on the other, enjoying wine tasting in the Constantia winelands. A hike or cable car ride to the top of Table Mountain is a must on any visitor’s holiday checklist – from the city centre it’s a mere 10-minute drive to the cable car station."
