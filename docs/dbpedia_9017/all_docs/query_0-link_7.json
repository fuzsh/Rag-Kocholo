        "text": "Transcript\n\nCape Town, on the southernmost tip of Africa, is one of the world's most beautiful and multi-faceted cities. This city of three and a half million people is overlooked by its most prominent landmark, the majestic Table Mountain. The 600-million-year-old flat-topped mountain is the emblem of Cape Town and thus a must-see for all visitors to the city. The journey to the summit takes just three minutes in a cable car but those who prefer to go by foot should plan a climb of at least two hours. From the top, 1,000 meters above sea level, visitors can enjoy a magnificent view over the Cape region and Table Bay. Way up here, one also gains an impression of the city's diversity.\n\nWith temperatures regularly hitting 30 degrees or more, the summers here are hot. But few people dare to take the plunge into the ocean - the water of the Atlantic remains chilly. However, the coastline here is a surfer's paradise, with huge waves that attract tourists and locals alike. Here, one thing counts above all else: to see and be seen. And a stroll along the glamorous seafront in the affluent suburb of Camps Bay truly is something worth experiencing. Indigenous people perform traditional African dances in special shows for tourists.\n\nCape Town is the third-largest city in South Africa. It has been an important harbor for centuries and has always attracted migrants from all over the world. Today, Cape Town's main industries are retail and tourism. The recently restored Victoria and Albert Waterfront, with its elegant restaurants and exclusive stores, has become a tourist magnet. Yet large parts of the city's population cannot share in this wealth. Cape Town is a city of stark contrasts between rich and poor, white and black.\n\nThe southerly route out of the city leads to the end of the world. The Cape of Good Hope, 50 kilometers away, was given its name by sailors desperate to successfully navigate around the treacherous promontory of rocks on the sea route to India. And this infamous place at the very bottom of the continent still represents a risk to ships. Many vessels have fallen prey to the rough seas and rugged cliffs here. Another name sailors gave to this halfway point between Europe and India was the Cape of Storms.\n\nTo the north of the cape is another of the region's major attractions - the Winelands. Numerous vineyards are situated in this idyllic landscape, where the sun shines almost all year round - providing ideal conditions for grape growing. Both the red and white wines of South Africa are beloved by wine connoisseurs the world over. More and more people from across the globe are discovering the unique fascination of Cape Town."
