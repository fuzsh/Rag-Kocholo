        "text": "Sitting at the feet of iconic Table Mountain, Cape Town is a little city that packs a big punch. Established in 1652 with the arrival of Dutch settlers who were sent to start a halfway station for passing ships, Cape Town is known as Africa's \"Mother City.\" Like most other African cities, it has a complex colonial history, but one that has brought about truly magnificent diversity. —Mariette Du Toit-Helmbold"
