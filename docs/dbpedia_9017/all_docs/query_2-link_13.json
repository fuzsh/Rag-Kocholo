        "text": "Hint: South Africa, the southernmost nation on the African mainland, famous for its different geography, extraordinary natural magnificence, and social variety, all of which have made the nation a supported objective for explorers since the lawful closure of politically-sanctioned racial segregation (Afrikaans: \"apartness,\" or racial partition) in 1994.\n\nComplete answer:\n\nSouth Africa's distance—it lies a huge number of miles inaccessible from significant African urban areas, for example, Lagos and Cairo, and more than 6,000 miles (10,000 km) away from the majority of Europe, North America, and eastern Asia, where its significant exchanging accomplices are found—strengthened the official arrangement of politically-sanctioned racial segregation for a huge piece of the twentieth century. South Africa has three urban communities that fill in as capitals: Pretoria (leader), Cape Town (authoritative), and Bloemfontein (legal). Johannesburg, the biggest metropolitan zone in the nation and a focal point of business, lies at the core of the crowded Gauteng territory. Durban, a port on the Indian Ocean, is a significant modern place. East London and Port Elizabeth, the two of which lie along the nation's southern coast, are significant business, mechanical, and social focuses.\n\nSo, the correct answer is Option A.\n\nNote: Today South Africa appreciates a generally steady blended economy that draws on its prolific farming grounds, plentiful mineral assets, vacation destinations, and profoundly advanced scholarly capital. More noteworthy political fairness and financial dependability, in any case, don't really mean social serenity. South African culture toward the beginning of the 21st century kept on confronting steep difficulties: increasing crime percentages, ethnic strains, extraordinary aberrations in lodging and instructive chances, and the AIDS pandemic."
