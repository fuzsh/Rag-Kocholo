        "text": "Khoi people some of the first inhabitants of the Cape, it is believed that Khoi migrated towards the Cape Peninsula around 2000 years ago with their large herds of Nguni cattle. The San people were also in the Cape around the same time, but with no written history it is impossible to say who was here first.\n\nBartholomeu Dias, a Portuguese explorer, was the first known European to have sailed around the southernmost tip of Africa in 1488. Vasco da Gama was the next recorded visitor to the Cape in 1497. It was not until around 1652 when Jan van Riebeeck arrived that Europeans first inhabited the Cape.\n\nIn 1688 the first non-Dutch immigrants arrived in the Cape, and they were the French Huguenots who were fleeing anti-Protestant persecution in Catholic France. They fled to the Netherlands and were then sent to the Cape. They brought with them experience in wine making and formed the town of Franschhoek.\n\nThe English military successfully invaded the Dutch held Cape Colony in 1795 with the \"Battle of Muizenberg\". In 1802 a peace agreement saw the Cape being returned to Dutch rule, however in 1806 at the Battle of Blaauwberg the British took the Cape back. The British took permanent control of Cape Town in 1814 and held it until 1960.\n\nBritain established the Union of South Africa in 1910 which saw the Cape Colony being merged with the Colony of Natal and the two defeated Boer Republics. This would later in history become the current South Africa that we have in front of us today with Cape Town as the legislative capital.\n\nIn 1948 South Africa introduced the world the Apartheid, a political platform that divided South Africans in 4 racial groupings as well as the Group Areas Act\", a law that grouped areas of residence by race. All multi-racial suburbs of Cape Town were either purged of unlawful residents or demolished by the Government.\n\nRobben Island translated into Dutch is \"Seal Island\". First inhabited way back in the Stone-age and since the 1600's Robben Island was used as a prison by the Dutch, English and Apartheid Government. Robben Island is where Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners were held; the island is now a museum.\n\nNelson Mandela made his first public speech in decades from the balcony of the Cape Town City Hall in 1990. On the 27th April 1994, South Africa had her first ever free and fair elections in which over 20 000 000 South Africans cast their votes, many for the first time in their lives.\n\nCape Town today is the top international tourist destination in the whole of Africa with visitors taking in all of her majestic beauty 364 days a year. Yes, Cape Town has her fair share of issues, but as Capetonians, we are working hard together to help this one of the best cities in the World.\n\nThe 19th annual Cape Town Kite Festival was held at the beginning of November in Muizenberg, bringing together over 20,000 people for a two-day event.\n\nThe festival featured stunt kiting exhibitions, Japanese-inspired Rokkaku kite battles, and a Heritage Kite Competition that encouraged children to build South African swallow or bat-style kites from scratch.\n\nIn addition to the fun activities on offer, the festival also supports Cape Mental Health charity and provides an opportunity for local businesses and visitors alike to experience the beauty of Cape Town and Muizenberg.\n\nThe Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town is a luxurious 5-star resort known for its stately entrance, magnificent views of Table Mountain, and nine acres of landscaped gardens.\n\nRecently the hotel has completed a winter refurbishment program that includes enhancements to the fa√ßade and bathrooms, as well as light refurbishments to all remaining luxury rooms and suites.\n\nGuests can enjoy activities such as garden walks with the hotel horticulturalists, indulging in morning or afternoon tea on the terrace, or meeting up with friends at Planet Champagne Bar.\n\nCape Town, South Africa is a vibrant and beautiful city that offers something for everyone.\n\nFrom its stunning beaches to its majestic Table Mountain, from its world-famous Constantia vineyards to the stunning Kirstenbosch Garden, Robben Island and a great number of 5-star restaurants on offer - Cape Town truly is an unforgettable destination.\n\nHere are 10 of the best things about this incredible city that make it such a fantastic place to visit or live in.\n\nTable Mountain is one of the most iconic landmarks in Cape Town, and with the Aerial Cableway closed for a few weeks, now is the perfect time to explore its many paths.\n\nA hike up Skeleton Gorge provides an opportunity to experience nature's beauty while gathering breathtaking views along the way.\n\nWith record numbers of visitors coming to Cape Town due to its designation as World Design Capital 2014, and inclusion as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, it is no wonder why this city has been gaining so much attention.\n\nWith its dynamic atmosphere and captivating art, Norval Foundation in Cape Town offers a unique experience for all ages who appreciate the beauty of art.\n\nNo matter who you are, the Norval Foundation has something to astound and delight!
