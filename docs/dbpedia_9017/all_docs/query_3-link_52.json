The food is superb, there is great surfing, a strange abundance of penguins, and watching the city‚Äôs epic sunsets from Table Mountain is a bucket list worthy occupation.\n\nSadly, this is not the whole picture.\n\nYou might be wondering ‚ÄúWhy is Cape town so dangerous?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs Cape Town safe?‚Äù Well, Cape Town‚Äôs reputation is one marred by accounts of theft, muggings, assaults, car jackings and gang violence ‚Äì often fuelled by poverty. Years of Apartheid have contributed to current social issues, which haven‚Äôt gone anywhere since‚Ä¶\n\nLuckily for you, I have created this top tier guide to staying safe when you visit Cape Town, filled to the brim with safety tips, tricks, and informative stats.

Tourist had a generally fun vacation\n\nBegrudgingly, yes, visiting Cape Town is safe right now. However, travellers should exercise heightened caution due to high levels of crime.\n\nHow dangerous is Cape Town? Well, as a tourist, the level of risk that you expose yourself to is low, thanks to the South African tourist police. Spots that are regularly visited by tourists (and there are a great number of cool places to go) are well guarded, but that does not mean that they can‚Äôt be dangerous, especially at night!\n\nIn answer to why is Cape Town dangerous. There is theft, in the form of muggings, scams, and pickpocketing, which remains part of the scenery as it would be in any developing city. Because of these occurrences, among others, you can‚Äôt really wander around the city too much ‚Äì it is a little dangerous to do so. Thankfully, the city is safe enough to tick off a great Cape Town itinerary!\n\nCarjackings are a particular issue in South Africa in general, and it is wise to double-check that you locked your doors before driving. When visiting Cape Town, it is always a great idea to take that extra level of precaution!\n\nCape Town suffered a bad water shortage in 2017/2018, so pay attention to local water regulations and rules.\n\nThere is some confusion regarding the safety of central business districts and the city centre. Some reports indicate that due to a strong police presence, the CBDs are quite safe. Others (including the UK government‚Äôs own) show that crime levels are actually unreasonably high here, especially at night.\n\nAt the end of the day, you should be cautious and take note of any travel safety tips you can get your mitts on. Talk to someone who lives here if you can!\n\nCheck out our detailed where to stay guide for Cape Town so you can start your trip right!\n\nSafest Places to Visit in Cape Town\n\nCape Town is a large city with two main areas: the Atlantic Seaboard and the City Bowl. Divided by the iconic Table Mountain, these areas are subdivided into different neighbourhoods and areas. If you‚Äôre worried about your safety, stay in one of the following areas.\n\nV&A Waterfront: Waterfront is a contained area with limited road access and plenty of CCTV cameras and security patrols. It‚Äôs home to the Aquarium, the Robben Island Museum, and is the main stop on the City Sightseeing bus routes. If you can put up with loads of tourists, this will be a great place to stay!\n\nClifton and Camps Bay: These two sister neighbourhoods are an amazing option for families that want to enjoy the beauty of Cape Town while staying safe. You can find flashy houses and mansions overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, and, if you‚Äôre lucky, one or the other celebrity. The area has good transportation links to other parts of the city and it‚Äôs home to some of the best guesthouses in Cape Town.\n\nCity Bowl: You‚Äôll find plenty of artists, small businesses, and young entrepreneurs in the City Bowl vicinity. Garden and Woodstock, two uprising and popular neighbourhoods, are situated in City Bowl as well. Staying here means a great mix between nature, culture and lots of creativity. Great hostels too!\n\nFalse Bay: While the name belies trickery, False Bay is actually an ex-pat hub. Lots of people move here for the fantastic watersports in the area, especially in Muizenberg and Fish Hoek. Known as Cape Town‚Äôs deep south, this is a super safe place to be.\n\nPlaces in Cape Town to Avoid\n\nUnfortunately, not all of Cape Town is safe. The general rule of thumb is: the poorer the neighbourhood, the more dangerous it is. We‚Äôve listed the main no-go areas that you should avoid during your trip.\n\nCape Flats: Cape Flats is known for high crime rates and should definitely be avoided. It‚Äôs situated to the southeast of the CBD area and is ruled by gangs. Since 2019, the government has stepped in and the crime statistics have improved, however, it‚Äôs still considered a no-go area for tourists.\n\nLanga and Nyanga: These two areas are the oldest townships in Cape Town, but also one of the poorest. Therefore, crime rates are relatively high and it‚Äôs not a safe area for tourists.\n\nKraaifontein: Kraaifontein has an extraordinarily high crime rate, and is best missed if possible. Over 10000 crimes were committed here in 2020.\n\nOther Township Areas: These areas are on the outside of Cape Town‚Äôs popular neighbourhoods. While they offer an incredible culture, they‚Äôre not the safest place for tourists. Exploring these areas alone is not recommended. Instead, opt for having a local guide or friend show you around.\n\nKeeping your money safe in Cape Town\n\nOne of the most common things to happen to you whilst travelling is losing your money. And let‚Äôs face it: the most annoying way for this to actually occur is when it‚Äôs stolen from you.\n\nPetty crime is pretty much a problem all over the world. The best solution? Get a money belt.\n\nTravel with peace of mind. Travel WITH a security belt.\n\nStash your cash safely with this money belt. It will keep your valuables safely concealed, no matter where you go.\n\nIt looks exactly like a normal belt except for a SECRET interior pocket perfectly designed to hide a wad of cash, a passport photocopy or anything else you may wish to hide. Never get caught with your pants down again! (Unless you want to‚Ä¶)\n\nHide Yo‚Äô Money!\n\n23 Top Safety Tips for Traveling to Cape Town\n\nThe best way to avoid crime is to be cautious, stay vigilant, be aware of your surroundings ‚Äì and to keep in mind our insider tips for staying safe in Cape Town.\n\nDon‚Äôt walk around at night ‚Äì crime rates are significantly higher after dark. Don‚Äôt even think about wandering around during this time. Take a taxi (more on that later).\n\nDon‚Äôt travel on the trains (especially at night) ‚Äì Rent a car to get or use Uber.\n\nAvoid certain districts ‚Äì do your research when visiting Cape Town and make sure your walking routes don‚Äôt take you through dodgy neighbourhoods.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings ‚Äì for instance, wearing headphones isn‚Äôt smart. You‚Äôll want ALL your senses to stay safe.\n\nDon‚Äôt walk around looking super rich ‚Äì jewels, expensive clothes, looking like a celebrity. It‚Äôs an advert for thieves.\n\nBe alert at all times ‚Äì don‚Äôt wear your headsets or walk around holding electronics like cameras or phones.\n\nTake a good medical kit with you ‚Äì you never know when you might need it!\n\nSwim between flags and in nets at beaches ‚Äì because of dangerous currents, and also sharks. Swim close to the shore and keep an eye out for red flags (these mean don‚Äôt swim). But enjoy!\n\nBe careful if you‚Äôre out hiking ‚Äì Attacks do happen on the trails. Always share your location with someone you trust. Travel with a group and check to see if certain areas have higher rates of muggings.\n\nIf you‚Äôre approached by ‚Äòtourist police‚Äô ignore them ‚Äì these people are nine times out of ten fake and just looking to extort you. Ask for identification if you are unsure.\n\nDon‚Äôt leave things lying around unattended ‚Äì bags, phones, wallets. These can disappear easily. Keep them on you. A large proportion of crime in Cape Town is opportunistic, so don‚Äôt give ‚Äôem a reason!\n\nAlways keep an emergency stash of cash ‚Äì Never keep all your cards/ currency in one place. And hide it all from thieves with a hidden money belt.\n\nUse ATMs inside ‚Äì The only currency accepted in South Africa is the Rand (ZAR). Avoid carrying a lot of cash and try to pay by card. It‚Äôs just safer to do so. When withdrawing cash, go inside a mall or bank.\n\nSecure your belongings at your hotel ‚Äì If someone rifles through your stuff, it‚Äôs best to have valuables hidden or in a safe.\n\nDon‚Äôt open the door to just anybody ‚Äì check to make sure you know who‚Äôs knocking at your door ‚Äì it may be a potential thief.\n\nKeep your credit cards in sight ‚Äì even when they‚Äôre in use as fraud is rampant here. Hide them in a money belt.\n\nSimilarly, don‚Äôt give your details to anyone ‚Äì again, fraud.\n\nPractice safe sex ‚Äì HIV/AIDS is a genuine issue in South Africa that affects lives daily.\n\nIf you‚Äôre being robbed, don‚Äôt resist ‚Äì most fatalities occur when people struggle too much.\n\nDecline if someone offers to help you with your luggage at airports ‚Äì they‚Äôll most likely just be after your luggage itself.\n\nIf you‚Äôre heading out at night, do your research and go with people ‚Äì a ‚Äònice‚Äô area + more people around you = preferable.\n\nCopy important documents ‚Äì rather than take your passport around with you, which could easily go missing.\n\nYou‚Äôll probably be approached by street children asking for money ‚Äì it‚Äôs a personal choice if you give money, but you may find yourself overwhelmed if you seem to be giving a lot/all the time. Donate to a not-for-profit.\n\nMake sure you do your homework, be aware of ‚Äòno-go‚Äô areas, and be conscious of your surroundings; practice these, and you‚Äôre bound to have a blast!\n\nHow Dangerous is Cape Town to Travel Alone?\n\nYou‚Äôll be pleased to know it‚Äôs safe to visit Cape Town alone. Of course, travelling by yourself anywhere in the world comes with its problems. Solo travellers are often easier targets for thieves and can be more susceptible to attack. If you follow our Cape Town safety tips, you should be fine!\n\nTravelling around Cape Town Alone ‚Äì Tips and Pointers\n\nStaying in a hostel in Cape Town with solid reviews, a good social atmosphere, and a good location is a good step towards staying safe as a solo traveller in Cape Town.\n\nGoing on a well-reviewed walking tour, or any other sort of tour ‚Äì maybe one put on by your hostel ‚Äì is a good way of getting acquainted with the city.\n\nStaying with a local at a homestay or guesthouse is another good way to get some perspective. Not only will you learn about Cape Town (and South Africa) but also get a good grip on how to get around the city.\n\nListen to advice from locals. If you are advised to avoid certain areas or activities alone, do some additional research with their advice in mind before making your final decision on the destination or activity.\n\nAlways let someone know where you are. You don‚Äôt want to go missing without anyone noticing.\n\nMake sure you know where you‚Äôre going, how you‚Äôre getting there and how you can get back independently.\n\nUltimately, do your research. Our tips are a good place to start, but the different districts of Cape Town are a sphere of knowledge that need special attention.\n\nIs Cape Town safe for solo female travellers?\n\nWith a high crime rate and the ever-looming threat of rape (South Africa as a country has been called the ‚Äúrape capital of the world‚Äù), Cape Town might not seem like the best place to be heading as a solo female traveller.\n\nIn defiance of these dangers, there are still plenty of female travellers who go backpacking in Cape Town. Staying safe just means extra work as a female solo traveller. Lame but necessary.\n\nTravelling to Cape Town as a Woman ‚Äì Tips and Pointers\n\nTake taxis arranged by your hostel or through an app. It‚Äôs not worth taking the risk when it comes to walking around at night, or even just after sunset.\n\nMeeting other travellers is a good idea, so find a place to stay in Cape Town with good views, a good vibe and some female-only dorms (if you fancy it). Talking to other female travellers is good since you can share tips on travelling, which can only ever be a positive thing.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre walking around by yourself, be confident. Looking unsure of your surroundings makes you seem like an easy target.\n\nNot everywhere in the city is shady. Do your research, and get out of the main touristed areas ‚Äì Bo-Kaap is a wonderful, trouble-free district full of cool, colourful houses.\n\nIf you want to go out partying, maybe stick to your own hostel bar. If you do go out (with people and while using taxis), watch your drink and don‚Äôt take drinks offered by strangers.\n\nAsk the staff at your hostel about the local area. The more you know, the safer you‚Äôll be.\n\nLet people know what your plans are. If you go out hiking or even just on a guided tour, having someone know your whereabouts s better than nobody knowing where you are for the day.\n\nTry to fit in a little more and dress like a local.\n\nAvoid being on isolated beaches by yourself, any time of day. Muggings ‚Äì or worse ‚Äì can happen.\n\nWhere to Start Your Travels in Cape Town\n\nSafest Area to stay\n\nSafest Area to stay\n\nV&A Waterfront\n\nV&A Waterfront is Cape Towns safest and most popular neighbourhood.\n\nHow Safe is Cape Town for Families?\n\nIf you‚Äôre travelling with your loved ones it‚Äôs perfectly normal to be wondering how safe is Cape Town South Africa? Cape Town receives all kinds of tourists, many of these being families rather than intrepid backpackers. As such, we‚Äôd say Cape Town is absolutely safe for families.\n\nChances are you‚Äôll be staying in a more visited area, and will be doing more touristy things than the average backpacker. This already makes the situation much safer for you, and it should be easy to fully experience Cape Town.\n\nWith regards to specifics, you‚Äôll want to pay extra attention to your children if you let them go swimming, due to strong currents and sharks. Normally, there will be a lifeguard or shark spotter on the beach, but don‚Äôt count on this!\n\nDon‚Äôt let kids wander around streets themselves, and stick to the ‚Äògood‚Äô bits of town. Crime risks are low in large parts of Cape Town but can rise if you head into the slums or poorer parts of town. Don‚Äôt do that really uncool tourist thing of visiting one of the underprivileged parts‚Ä¶\n\nGetting Around Cape Town Safely\n\nThere are a few public transport options in Cape Town. Although not as safe as Uber, they‚Äôre still a great way to get around the city.\n\nMinibus Taxis: Very cheap, but they also come with a lot of flaws. They‚Äôre often overcrowded, the cars themselves are not maintained, and the drivers have a tendency to disobey all traffic laws.\n\nMyCiTi: It‚Äôs the bus service in Cape Town, and it is much safer. As opposed to minibus taxis, these are actually like any ‚Äònormal‚Äô city bus that you might get in. We approve of this mode of transport.\n\nMetrorail: As we mentioned earlier, this is not the sort of thing you‚Äôll want to be travelling around on at night (like with anything in Cape Town).\n\nWhile the roads in Cape Town are generally good to drive on, carjackings and smash-and-grabs make it a bit more dangerous than other places. Since these happen almost exclusively at red lights, people often run reds to mitigate the risk. Lights don‚Äôt mean everything here!\n\nUber is safe in Cape Town. In fact, everybody uses Uber in Cape Town. Even if it‚Äôs a 2-minute journey on foot, even if it‚Äôs just 100 metres to the next venue, Cape Town residents do not walk ‚Äì they Uber (or taxi).\n\nStick to reputable companies that have official methods of contact. One company that is certainly worth your time (and money) is Excite Taxis, although there are plenty of others. Even when using these legitimate services, take a photo of the driver‚Äôs ID. This helps in case you have any problems.\n\nCrime in Cape Town\n\nCrime in Cape Town is sadly a large problem. In 2022, the murder rate was 66.36 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is in a similar bracket to some of the most dangerous cities in South America (like Fortaleza or Belem). The U.S. government travel authority has put a level two rating on South Africa as a whole, due to the high crime rate. Thankfully, crime against tourists is pretty low, but the recent drought and water crisis have put everyone on edge, including the inevitably white middle class.\n\nThere have been increasing reports of tour guide scams, so if someone offers, don‚Äôt take them up on it unless you know they‚Äôre kosher!

We‚Äôve listed the most common question, answers and facts to make your trip as easy as possible.\n\nHow safe is Cape Town South Africa at night?\n\nUnless you‚Äôre staying in a resort, it is not safe to walk around at night in Cape Town. While touristy areas might be safer, you should definitely avoid going into dark side streets or quiet areas by yourself (or at all).\n\nIs Cape Town Safe for Solo Female Travellers?\n\nYes, Cape Town is safe for solo female travellers, but they should stay extra aware, and take more precautions than they usually would. South Africa is known in general as the rape capital of the world, so making sure that you stay safe is a top priority.\n\nWhat are the most Dangerous areas in Cape Town?\n\nThe Cape Flats are the most dangerous area and should be fully avoided by tourists and visitors. It‚Äôs an area that even locals don‚Äôt walk in, and you should definitely avoid it during your visit. In general, townships should be left alone too, given their high rates of crime.\n\nIs Visiting Cape Town Safe?\n\nWhilst Cape Town has a high crime rate and suffers from systematic social issues, you should be safe when you visit Cape Town. A large portion of crime in confined to poorer neighbourhoods and tourist areas are patrolled regularly by the South African tourism police force. That said, it is a place where you should take extra care if possible.\n\nIs Cape Town LGBTQ+ Friendly?\n\nYou‚Äôll be happy to hear that Cape town is one of the most LGBTQ+ friendly cities on the entire planet. The rainbow nation legalized same-sex marriages in 2006 ‚Äì the first country in Africa and the fifth in the world to do so. If you venture out to the poorer areas (which we definitely do not recommend), you‚Äôll get some nasty comments, but if you‚Äôre staying in the more touristy neighborhoods you‚Äôll have an absolute blast!\n\nIs it Safe to Live in Cape Town?\n\nCape Town is an amazing town, one that is often worth the risks. Ask any local and, regardless of statistics, they‚Äôd probably say it‚Äôs safe to live in Cape Town, at least, for people with good sense.\n\nLiving here means you probably won‚Äôt be as free as you might be in your own country. Races may mix without issue in your own country, but it‚Äôs still not the case here, unfortunately.\n\nLiving safely in Cape Town will require living in a fairly upmarket suburb with excellent security. Bloubergstrand is a suburb to the north of the city where you‚Äôll feel safe out at night, even alone at the beach. Constantia and Hout Bay are beautiful places to live in the south, but you‚Äôll need security due to the ‚Äúinformal settlement‚Äù of Imizamo Yethu between the two.\n\nSo, is Cape Town Safe for Travel?\n\nYes, we‚Äôd say Cape Town is safe for travel as long as you use your common sense and do your research. It is an amazing town, one that is often worth the risks. Ask any local and, regardless of statistics, they‚Äôd probably say it‚Äôs safe to live in Cape Town, at least, for people with good sense.\n\nBad things can happen anywhere, but when it comes to staying safe in Cape Town you can lessen your chances of being a victim by simply being vigilant.
