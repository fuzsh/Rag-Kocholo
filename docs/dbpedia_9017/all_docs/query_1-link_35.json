        "text": "Safety and security\n\nOutages\n\nNationwide power shortages or rolling blackouts, referred to as load shedding, are still occurring regularly. They are occurring numerous times a day and for multiple-hour stretches. They are expected to continue through 2023 and into 2024.\n\nThough the potential for a nationwide blackout is low, the associated risks are high, including a nationwide loss of power for days or weeks.\n\nSouth Africa has already experienced blackouts for up to 12 hours in a 24 hour period. Increased demand for power during the coldest winter months of June and July means that blackouts could last longer. Expect a dark and cold winter.\n\nAn official schedule of the planned blackouts provides advance notice of the shortages. However, they can also occur with very little notice.\n\nBlackouts could increase the risk of criminal activity in affected areas, which could in turn lead to opportunistic theft and prolonged outages.\n\nBlackouts can affect the following services and businesses:\n\ntelecommunications and security systems\n\nstores and food supply\n\nhotels and other accommodations\n\nbanks and ATMs\n\ngas stations\n\npublic lighting and traffic lights\n\nInterruptions to water supply occur occasionally and can be lengthy in some areas, causing considerable inconvenience.\n\nIf you’re in South Africa:\n\nbe prepared for extended power outages\n\nmake sure you always have a complete emergency kit on hand, including several flashlights\n\nalways carry a cell phone, power banks, chargers and a list of emergency numbers handy\n\nkeep a sufficient supply of water, food, medication and fuel on hand for several days\n\nkeep your travel documents up-to-date\n\nmonitor local media\n\nfollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nUseful links\n\nList of planned blackouts - Eskom, South African electricity public utility\n\nGet Prepared - basic emergency kit\n\nCrime\n\nViolent crime\n\nSouth Africa has a very high level of crime. Crime is the primary security threat to travellers.\n\nViolent crimes, including rape and murder, occur frequently and have involved foreigners.\n\nMuggings, armed assaults and theft are also frequent, often occurring in areas that are popular among tourists. Carjackings, robbery and assault also occur.\n\nArmed robberies at shopping malls occur. To minimize the risk of personal assault if confronted by an armed individual:\n\nimmediately comply\n\navoid making sudden movements\n\navoid resisting or antagonizing the assailants\n\navoid eye contact with your assailant\n\nCrime significantly increases after dark in major city centres and townships. After dark, avoid the areas of:\n\nBerea\n\nHillbrow and Yeoville in Johannesburg\n\nSunnyside in Pretoria\n\nthe beachfront and Victoria wharf in Durban\n\nCape Town downtown hotels to the waterfront\n\nCrimes of opportunity\n\nThere is a high risk of pickpocketing. You should not carry your wallet in your back pocket.\n\nDo not show signs of affluence, display money or carry valuables such as laptop computers or cameras.\n\nWhen at restaurants or bars, do not leave your bag under your chair or table or hung over the back of a chair; keep it on your lap.\n\nEnsure that all your bags’ zippers, straps and fasteners are closed and secure, and be aware of people behind and around you.\n\nCriminals are known to target people who appear distracted and are not paying attention to their immediate surroundings.\n\nIf you believe that you are being followed, go directly to a police station.\n\nCrime in and around airports\n\nPassengers have been followed upon arrival at airports and then robbed either on their way to or once they arrived at their final destination. There are also reports of theft from checked luggage.\n\nSome areas around Cape Town International Airport are less secure. There are reports of an increased risk of attack on secondary roads near the airport.\n\nWhen travelling to and from an airport:\n\nstay on highways and main roads\n\navoid shortcuts\n\nif you are using a GPS, make sure that the itinerary avoid townships and secondary roads\n\nplan your trip in advance and verify your travel itinerary with a trusted local source\n\nconsider arranging an airport transfer\n\nOn the road\n\nBe vigilant at vulnerable points such as:\n\ntraffic lights\n\nstop signs\n\nyield signs\n\nhighway off-ramps\n\nSmash and grab incidents are frequent. This is when car windows are broken and valuables such as handbags are taken while cars are waiting at junctions.\n\nPark in well-lit areas\n\nDo not pick up strangers\n\nEnsure that vehicle doors are locked and windows are closed at all times\n\nHotel theft\n\nTheft from hotel rooms and guest houses is common. Never leave your windows or doors open or unlocked, even when you are present.\n\nCheck the level of security at guest houses, hotels, lodges, backpacker lodges or any accommodation before making bookings\n\nDon’t leave luggage and valuables unattended; place them in safekeeping facilities\n\nDon’t open the door to anyone without taking necessary precautions. If someone claims to be a member of staff, verify with the reception prior to opening the door\n\nPolice officer impersonation\n\nCriminals may pose as police officers to extort or rob tourists. There are reports that criminals use fake IDs and flashing blue lights to stop cars with the intent to rob the passengers or steal the vehicle.\n\nIf you face this situation:\n\ndo not stop your vehicle\n\nput on your hazard lights and continue to the nearest police station or secure location\n\nKidnapping\n\nThere is a threat of kidnapping across South Africa. Foreign nationals have been kidnapped in the past.

Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThere is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Individuals who may be inspired by terrorist groups may carry out “lone actor” attacks targeting public places, including where foreigners gather.\n\nTargets could include:\n\ngovernment buildings, including schools\n\nplaces of worship\n\nairports and other transportation hubs and networks\n\npublic areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners\n\nSouth African authorities have successfully disrupted planned attacks and made arrests related to terrorism offences. Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.\n\nRegional unrest\n\nXenophobic attacks, primarily targeting refugees or immigrants from other African nations, related demonstrations, looting and outbreaks of violence occur. This type of unrest could occur in any region of the country and with little warning.\n\nAvoid large gatherings and demonstrations, monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times.\n\nTownships and rural areas\n\nAvoid townships and informal settlements if you are unfamiliar with them, except when travelling with organized tours provided by a reputable company or in association with an experienced local organization.\n\nWildlife viewing\n\nWildlife viewing poses risks, particularly on foot or at close range. Be aware of the threat of monkeys and baboons overwhelming sightseers in their search for food. They are known to get very aggressive.\n\nAlways maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife\n\nOnly exit a vehicle when a professional guide or warden says it’s safe to do so\n\nOnly use reputable and professional guides or tour operators\n\nClosely follow park regulations and wardens’ advice\n\nWater activities\n\nCoastal waters have unpredictable wave and currents patterns, which can be dangerous. Shark attacks have been reported in several areas, including in KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape.\n\nFollow the advice and warnings of local authorities\n\nBe cautious when swimming in lakes and rivers because of the risk posed by wildlife\n\nWater safety abroad\n\nTelecommunications\n\nCellular phone reception is generally good in major towns and cities but can be intermittent in rural areas. Extended periods of rolling blackouts are impacting internet connectivity and cell phone networks.\n\nAlways carry a cellular phone in the event of an emergency. If using your own phone, ensure that it has international/roaming capability for use while in South Africa.\n\nRoad safety\n\nFatal road accidents are common in South Africa. Accidents occur especially in wet conditions, as roads can be very slippery. Traffic lights are frequently out of order. GPS navigation systems may suggest the most direct route but not the safest.\n\nObserve the recommended following distances\n\nAvoid undertaking overland travel after dark\n\nTreat all intersections with malfunctioning traffic lights as a four-way stop\n\nVerify your travel itinerary with a trusted local source, such as your hotel, your travel agent or local police, before driving\n\nRoad conditions\n\nRoad conditions are generally good, but some roads in the more remote areas are less well maintained.\n\nDriving can be dangerous due to:\n\npotholes\n\ninsufficient lighting\n\npedestrians crossing major highways\n\nwild animals and stray livestock on the road\n\nDriving habits\n\nDrivers do not always respect traffic laws, especially at night. Drivers often drive at excess speed and ignore traffic signs. Drinking and driving is common.\n\nDrivers are often aggressive toward pedestrians and fail to yield the right of way even on marked crosswalks.\n\nTravel on foot is inadvisable in most areas. If walking is unavoidable, use only brightly lit, busy streets in popular tourist areas and maintain awareness of your surroundings.\n\nIf you choose to drive in South Africa:\n\nalways drive defensively\n\nplan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area\n\navoid travelling after dark\n\nchoose a vehicle with a robust central locking system, lockable fuel tank cap and vehicle alarm\n\nuse a reliable rental company offering 24-hour emergency service and ensure that you have the contact details for the service\n\nPublic transportation\n\nAvoid using public transportation.\n\nBus\n\nTourists have been mugged and assaulted in and around bus stations. Avoid the central bus station in Johannesburg.\n\nTrain\n\nTrain services are slow and several serious accidents in recent years have raised concerns over safety standards.\n\nViolent attacks have occurred on commuter and metro trains between Johannesburg and Pretoria, as well as on commuter trains in Cape Town. Don’t travel by train, especially second or third class.\n\nThe Gautrain between O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and Pretoria, as well as the Blue Train and Rovos Rail, are, however, safe for tourists.\n\nTaxis\n\nTaxis cannot be hailed in the street. Ask your hotel to arrange a taxi and ensure that you prearrange transport for your return journey.\n\nSit in the rear of the vehicle and keep windows up and doors locked at all times. Keep valuables out of sight and place bags by your feet. Negotiate the fare with the driver in advance. Avoid using minibuses and unlicensed taxis.\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nEntry and exit requirements\n\nEvery country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.\n\nWe have obtained the information on this page from South African authorities. It can, however, change at any time.\n\nVerify this information with the Foreign Representatives in Canada.\n\nPassport\n\nEntry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.\n\nBefore you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements.

In such cases, visitors may face a very substantial fine and be deported at their own expense.\n\nSouth African visas - South African Department of Home Affairs\n\nChanging or extending your visa\n\nSome foreigners travelling to South Africa have not gone through the correct channels to obtain, change or extend their relevant visas. This has resulted in arrest and detention due to fraudulently issued visas.\n\nWhile in South Africa, you must go through regional or district offices of the South African Department of Home Affairs for information on visa requirements and issuance.\n\nRegional travel\n\nIf you leave and re-enter South Africa, even for a short time, you will not automatically be given an additional 90-day visitor’s visa. An immigration official can deny you re-entry into South Africa. The immigration officer can also allow you to enter for a limited time only.\n\nIf you wish to extend your stay, contact the South African Department of Home Affairs 60 days before your visitor’s visa expires.\n\nSouth African Department of Home Affairs contact information\n\nWork or study\n\nIf you intend to work or study in South Africa, you must apply for the relevant visas prior to your arrival; otherwise, you risk being refused entry and may be returned to your point of origin.

Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is no risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is required if you are coming from or have transited through an airport of a countrywhere yellow fever occurs.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is not recommended.\n\nDiscuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.\n\nContact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.\n\nThere is a risk of malaria in certain areas and/or during a certain time of year in this destination.\n\nAntimalarial medication may be recommended depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:\n\n• Cover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.\n\n• Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.\n\n• Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.\n\n• Wear permethrin-treated clothing.\n\nIf you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nRisk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nSchistosomiasis\n\nThere is a risk of schistosomiasis in this destination. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by tiny worms (blood flukes) which can be found in freshwater (lakes, rivers, ponds, and wetlands). The worms can break the skin, and their eggs can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, or urinary problems. Schistosomiasis mostly affects underdeveloped and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing communities.\n\nMost travellers are at low risk. Travellers should avoid contact with untreated freshwater such as lakes, rivers, and ponds (e.g., swimming, bathing, wading, ingesting). There is no vaccine or medication available to prevent infection.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:\n\nseason\n\nyear\n\nregion\n\nelevation\n\nThe virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInsect bite and pest prevention\n\nChikungunya\n\nCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever\n\nCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral disease that can cause fever, pain and bleeding under the skin. In some cases, it can be fatal. It spreads to humans through contact with infected animal blood or tissues, or from the bite of an infected tick. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Celebrations which include the slaughtering of animals and contact with their blood and/ or tissues may increase the risk of exposure to the virus.\n\nProtect yourself from tick bites and wear gloves or other protective clothing if you are in contact with the blood and tissues of animals, particularly livestock. There is no vaccine available for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.\n\nRift Valley fever\n\nRift Valley fever is a viral disease that can cause severe flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can be fatal. It is spread to humans through contact with infected animal blood or tissues, from the bite of an infected mosquito, or eating or drinking unpasteurized dairy. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from insect bites and avoid animals, particularly livestock, and unpasteurized dairy. There is no vaccine available for Rift Valley fever.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.\n\nFor most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.\n\nTravellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.\n\nHigh-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.\n\nHIV\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks and impairs the immune system, resulting in a chronic, progressive illness known as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).\n\nHigh risk activities include anything which puts you in contact with blood or body fluids, such as unprotected sex and exposure to unsterilized needles for medications or other substances (for example, steroids and drugs), tattooing, body-piercing or acupuncture.\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nMedical facilities and supplies are widely available in large cities but can be expensive. Medical facilities are limited in remote areas.\n\nPublic and private health facilities require an up-front cash deposit for services, guarantee of payment or confirmation of medical insurance before commencing treatment.\n\nAir evacuation may be the only option when faced with a medical emergency in remote areas.\n\nDecompression chambers are available in many hospitals.\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.\n\nHealth and safety outside Canada\n\nKeep in Mind...\n\nThe decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.\n\nBe prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a travel health kit, especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.\n\nLaws and culture\n\nYou must abide by local laws.\n\nLearn about what you should do and how we can help if you are arrested or detained abroad.\n\nDrugs\n\nPenalties for using, importing or exporting drugs are severe and may include lengthy imprisonment.\n\nDrugs, alcohol and travel\n\nFirearms\n\nYou may not import or take in-transit any firearm or ammunition without a temporary export and import or in-transit permit issued by the South African Police Service.\n\nDual citizenship\n\nDual citizenship is legally recognized in South Africa.\n\nIf you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of South Africa, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different entry/exit requirements.\n\nDual citizens\n\nInternational Child Abduction\n\nThe Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. The convention applies between Canada and South Africa.\n\nIf your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in South Africa, and if the applicable conditions are met, you may apply for the return of your child to the South African court.\n\nIf you are in this situation:\n\nact as quickly as you can\n\ncontact the Central Authority for your province or territory of residence for information on starting an application under The Hague Convention\n\nconsult a lawyer in Canada and in South Africa to explore all the legal options for the return of your child\n\nreport the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre\n\nIf your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.\n\nBe aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.\n\nUseful links\n\nList of Canadian Central Authorities for the Hague Convention\n\nInternational Child Abductions: A guide for affected parents\n\nChildren and travel\n\nThe Hague Convention – Hague Conference on Private International Law\n\nCanadian embassies and consulates by destination\n\nRequest emergency assistance\n\nDriving\n\nTraffic drives on the left.\n\nYou may use your valid Canadian provincial driver’s licence in South Africa, however, an international driving permit (IDP) is strongly recommended.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to obtain car insurance for car rentals or to purchase a car without an IDP. Insurance companies and rental car agencies often require proof of a South African driver’s licence or an IDP to honour an insurance claim, even when such proof was not requested at the time the policy was secured. An IDP must be obtained in Canada before travelling to South Africa, as it cannot be obtained locally.\n\nIf your licence is in French, it is advisable to obtain a translation into English and carry it with you.\n\nForeigners driving a rental car across any border into neighbouring countries must obtain a permit from the Cross-border Road Transport Agency prior to arriving at the border crossing. Failure to do so may lead to arrest and/or a fine.\n\nIt is illegal to carry gasoline in portable containers.\n\nUseful links\n\nObtain a permit - Cross-border Road Transport Agency\n\nInternational Driving Permit\n\nMoney\n\nThe currency is the South African rand (ZAR).\n\nCanadian currency can be easily exchanged at major banks and foreign exchange counters. A passport and additional identification is required when undertaking foreign exchange transactions.\n\nForeigners are permitted to enter South Africa carrying a maximum of ZAR100,000, or US$10,000 or its equivalent in foreign currencies. Customs forms are not required to be completed, but random customs checks are conducted."
