        "text": "Joseph Bonaparte (7 January 1768-28 July 1844), born Giuseppe-Napoleon Buonaparte, was King of Naples and Sicily from 1806 to 1808 (succeeding Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and preceding Joachim Murat) and King of Spain from 1808 to 1813 (succeeding Carlos IV of Spain and preceding Fernando VII of Spain). The younger brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, he was Count of Survilliers from 1815 until his death in 1844.\n\nBiography[]\n\nJoseph Bonaparte was born on Corte on the island of Corsica, then part of the Corsican Republic, on 7 January 1768. He was the first son of Carlo Buonaparte and the older brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, but he played less of a role in politics than his brother did. In 1795 he became a member of the Council of Ancients, and aided Napoleon's accession to power in 1799. Under his brother, he was given the Chateau de Villandry, and in 1806 was made the puppet king of Naples & Sicily, and in 1808 he was installed in a more-important title: King of Spain."
