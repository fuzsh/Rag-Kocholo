        "text": "Hmm...I thought I had read that somewhere in a Bernadotte biography, never mind then.\n\nNot that napoleon needs much help to get noticed by the directory, considering he was already on they radar because of Toulon.\n\nOh, yes that was true, but Desiree was well-connected as wife for Bernadotte being the sister-in-law of Joseph Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon...\n\nAbout Napoleon, while Toulon was good and bad for him at the same time as that signaled him as Jacobin, close to the Robespierres (well only to Augustin but still made him suspected and almost destroyed forever his career) and at least Lucien had very strong Jacobin sympathies. Right now Napoleon had received by Barras the command of the forces of the Directory for stopping the revolt of the Royalists and was successful in doing that but between that and receiving the command of any army there is a certain difference. The wedding to the very well introduced (and aristocratic) Josephine played a big part in detaching forever Napoleon’s image was from any suspect of Jacobinism and putting him in the circle of the new leaders of France\n\nBarras was starting to trust him, but I guess who without the wedding to Josephine the big start of Napoleon’s career is likely delayed...\n\nBarras picked him as a commander to deal with the royalists 3 (or 4) October 1795. On October 5 he cleared the streets with \"a whiff of grapeshot\", which assured patronage of the the Directory. He was promoted to Commander of the Interior and given command of the Army of Italy. He married Josephine on 9 March of 1796. By that time his career was pretty much guaranteed even without the marriage: he left to join the Italian Army two days after the wedding.\n\nBarras picked him as a commander to deal with the royalists 3 (or 4) October 1795.

I think the connections Josephine offered were to be useful later, not this early in his career. The interesting question to me is where does this leave Eugene de Beauhamais?\n\nYeah, this seems right to me. I think the connections Josephine offered were to be useful later, not this early in his career. The interesting question to me is where does this leave Eugene de Beauhamais?\n\nIt seems to me that at this point command of the Italian Army was not a very desirable appointment except for general Bonaparte who already planned offensives of 1794 and 1795. The front was not considered important and the army was the most neglected one both in the terms of supplies and reinforcements. With the nominal strength of over 100,000 the real numbers were around 30,000. It’s commander, Kellerman, asked Carnot for reinforcements and ... was replaced by Scherer who soon afterwards resigned and was replaced by Bonaparte who did not get any reinforcements or supplies and launched an offensive with 37,000 troops against more than 50,000 (or 90,000?) in what was considered a good defensive position. His famous address to the troops clearly described both situation and perspectives.”.You are naked and hungry...It is my design to lead you into the most fertile plains of the world . Rich provinces and great cities will be in your power ; there you will find honor , glory , and wealth .” From the Directorate’s point of view this could look,as a reasonable appointment: (a) honor of getting an army command, (b) familiarity with the theater and (c) a minimal risk for the Republic if inexperienced army commander screws up. Probably they expected something limited in scope like Saorgio Offensive (executed by Bonaparte’s plan)\n\nAs for Eugene, he would probably enter the military service and, AFAIK, he was talented enough to make a decent career, especially if he starts as Bonaparte’s aid: even if there is no marriage to Josephine, Barras could recommend him. Of course, chances to raise as high as in OTL would be close to zero."
