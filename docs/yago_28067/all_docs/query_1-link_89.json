        "text": "…with Napoleon\n\nThe Chateau de Malmaison, located in Reuil-Malmaison, about 9 miles from Paris, was the home of Napoleon Bonaparte and his wife Josephine. While Napoleon was out galavanting in Egypt, she bought the house in 1799. Or, more precisely she signed a contract to buy the house, it was up to him to come up with the cash when he got back. He did. Later, as emperor, Napoleon would enact a law that prevented women from signing a contract without the consent of a husband, father or brother.\n\nFor two years, from 1800 to 1802, the Chateau de Malmaison was the seat of French government. Josephine lived there until her death in 1814. Napoleon moved out in 1809 after their marriage was annulled. Despite his love for Jospehine, Napoleon had sought the annulment because she could not give him an heir.\n\nJosephine was born Marie Josephe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie in Martinique to a noble French family. She initially married Alexandre de Beauhamais. She had two children with Beauhamais. Her husband was a bit of a philanderer and she was able to get a court ordered separation. Alexandre was beheaded during the French Revolution. Josephine was also imprisoned, but she was released after the fall of Robespierre.\n\nJospehine apparently had a number of affairs with political figures before marrying Napoleon in 1796. In 1804, when Napoleon was “elected” emporer, she became the Empress of France. She is often referred to as Josephine Beauhamais, but she used the name Josephine Bonaparte after her marriage. She died in 1814 from pneumonia.\n\nJospehine was responsible for the renovation of Chateau de Malmaison and for the beautiful gardens that surround the chateau."
