        "text": "Bernardine Eugenie Desiree Clary, born on 8th November 1777 and passed on 17th December 1860, held various significant roles throughout her life. She served as Queen of Sweden and Norway, alongside her husband King Charles XIV John, who was not only a French General but also the founder of the House of Bernadotte. Additionally, she was the mother of Oscar I and had once been engaged to Napoleon Bonaparte. Interestingly, she officially changed her name to Desideria, although she did not commonly use this appellation herself.\n\nExploring the fascinating history of Desiree Clary, whose life intertwines with the political and romantic dramas of 18th and 19th-century Europe, you may also like to delve into the vibrant cultural tapestry showcased during the European City of Culture 2013 celebrations.\n\nThe Enigmatic Life of Desiree Clary\n\nThe Early Life and Education of Desiree Clary\n\nDesiree Clary was born in Marseille, France, into a prosperous family. Her father, François Clary, was a prominent silk manufacturer and merchant, while her mother, Françoise Rose Somis, hailed from Marseille as well. Desiree had a close bond with her siblings throughout her life. Her sister, Julie Clary, went on to marry Joseph Bonaparte and became Queen of Naples and Spain, while her brother, Nicholas Joseph Clary, was granted the title of 1st Count Clary.\n\nDuring her childhood, Desiree received an education typical for girls of her social standing in pre-revolutionary France, primarily in convents. However, the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 led to the closure of convents, abruptly interrupting her formal education at the age of eleven. Subsequently, she was homeschooled by her parents, though her education has been criticized by some historians as lacking depth. Despite this, Desiree remained deeply devoted to her family throughout her life.\n\nEncounters with the Bonapartes: A Tale of Fate and Romance\n\nIn 1794, tragedy struck the family of Désirée when her father passed away. Unveiled in the aftermath was a denied appeal for nobility, leading to the arrest of her brother Etienne by revolutionary authorities. As the new head of the family, Etienne’s plight thrust Désirée into a pivotal moment. Legend holds that she ventured with her sister-in-law Suzanne to petition for Etienne’s release, only to find herself forgotten in the waiting room, where she drifted into slumber. It was here that Joseph Bonaparte stumbled upon her, sparking a chain of fateful encounters.\n\nJoseph’s introduction to Désirée’s family marked the beginning of a whirlwind of alliances and affections. Napoleon Bonaparte, Joseph’s brother, quickly recognized the potential for romantic connections, subtly suggesting matches that reshaped destinies. Joseph wedded Julie, while Napoleon and Désirée found themselves betrothed on April 21, 1795. Yet, amidst the backdrop of burgeoning love, the shifting tides of Napoleon’s heart led to the dissolution of their engagement, as he embarked on a passionate liaison with Joséphine de Beauharnais.\n\nFor Désirée, life unfolded in unexpected ways. She journeyed to Rome with her sister Julie and brother-in-law Joseph, immersing herself in the vibrant tapestry of diplomatic affairs. Amidst the grandeur of Rome, her bond with Julie remained steadfast, even as she navigated the complexities of romance. Her union with French general Mathurin-Leonard Duphot, orchestrated by Napoleon, bore the weight of reluctant acceptance, shadowed by Duphot’s prior commitments. Tragedy struck on the eve of their marriage, shattering dreams and altering the course of Désirée’s fate, as Duphot fell victim to an anti-French riot outside their residence in Palazzo Corsini on December 30, 1797.\n\nDésirée Clary: Parisian to Swedish Royalty\n\nUpon her return to France, Désirée Clary resumed life in Paris alongside Julie and Joseph, immersing herself within the Bonaparte family circle—a family noted for their broken promises. Despite her personal indifference towards Josephine, Désirée managed to avoid the animosity that characterized the Bonaparte family’s attitude towards Josephine. She declined a marriage proposal from General Junot, a decision influenced by Marmont, only to later commit to Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, a distinguished French general and politician. Their union was solidified in a secular ceremony in Sceaux on 17 August 1798, where Désirée was assured economic independence in their marital agreement. On 4 July 1799, she welcomed their sole child, Oscar.\n\nThe political upheaval of 1799, marked by Napoleon’s ascent to power, placed Désirée at the center of a tug-of-war between the Bonapartes, who sought Bernadotte’s allegiance to Napoleon, and Bernadotte’s own faction, eyeing personal ambition. Bernadotte withheld his plans from Désirée, attributing his reticence to familial pressures. Amidst this turmoil, the couple sought refuge in General Sarrazin’s villa in Villeneuve St. Georges, with Désirée reportedly disguising herself as a man during their escape. Despite these challenges, she maintained constant communication with Julie, and Napoleon’s eventual acceptance of Bernadotte was partly credited to her;\n\nIn 1800, Désirée was caught in an assassination attempt on Napoleon, signaling the beginning of her unintentional role as a political intermediary between her husband and Napoleon, who utilized her connections for mutual influence. By 1801, Bernadotte’s intervention on behalf of General Ernouf was facilitated through Joseph, and a conspiracy against Napoleon in 1802 raised suspicions towards Bernadotte, putting Désirée in an uncomfortable position of interrogation. This period of tension concluded with Napoleon’s brief appointment of Bernadotte as governor of Louisiana, an opportunity that was withdrawn before fruition;\n\nOn 19 May 1804, Bernadotte’s elevation to Marshal of France mirrored an increase in Désirée’s social standing, though she remained indifferent to her newfound status, much like her sister Julie. Napoleon’s provision of an allowance and a residence in Rue d’Anjou Saint-Honoré underscored her importance, further highlighted during the Coronation of Napoleon on 2 December 1804, where she had a ceremonial role.\n\nDespite Bernadotte’s frequent absences due to military duties, Désirée thrived in Parisian high society, refusing the traditional role of a lady-in-waiting at her husband’s request. Her life was rich with cultural engagements, and rumors of a romantic liaison with Corsican Angel Chaippe persisted. Désirée’s life intertwined with political events, which she relayed to Bernadotte through correspondence.\n\nHer reluctance to leave Paris was evident during Bernadotte’s tenure in various administrative roles, and her dismay at the prospect of leaving Paris for Pontecorvo was palpable. However, the election of Bernadotte as heir to the Swedish throne in 1810 presented an unprecedented challenge to Désirée’s Parisian affections. Initially confused and reluctant, Désirée eventually embraced her new role, overcoming her fears fueled by daunting tales of the North Pole. Her journey to Sweden, via Hamburg and Kronborg, marked the beginning of a new chapter in her life, far removed from the Parisian circles to the royal court of Sweden.\n\nDésirée Clary: Swedish Royalty to Parisian Intrigue\n\nOn December 22, 1810, Désirée arrived with her husband, Oscar, in Helsingborg, Sweden. A few weeks later, on January 6, 1811, she was formally presented to the Swedish royal court at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. However, the Swedish climate proved challenging for her, especially the winter snow, which she despised so much that it moved her to tears. Despite her initial discomfort, she adapted to her new role as the spouse of the Swedish monarch, even converting to Lutheranism as required by the Swedish court. Yet, her heart remained tied to her Catholic faith, and she found solace in the private Catholic chapel arranged for her.\n\nHowever, Désirée struggled with the demands of court life, failing to engage effectively in formal court practices or representational duties expected of her as Crown Princess. Her French entourage, particularly Elise la Flotte, fueled her dissatisfaction, making her unpopular by encouraging her complaints. Her relationship with Queen Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte was strained, although she found kindness from the Dowager Queen Sophia Magdalena.\n\nEventually, Désirée’s discontent led her to leave Sweden in the summer of 1811, assuming the title of Countess of Gotland. Returning to Paris, she expressed her disdain for Sweden, claiming its nobility was as cold as ice. Meanwhile, her husband took a mistress, further straining their relationship.\n\nBack in Paris, under the guise of the Countess of Gotland, Désirée lived incognito, closely monitored by the secret police. She associated mainly with a select circle of friends and family, hosting receptions attended by influential figures like Talleyrand and Fouché. Despite her reluctance, she found herself entangled in political matters, acting as a mediator between Napoleon and her husband during negotiations with the Duke of Bassano.\n\nAs political tides shifted, Désirée found herself navigating complex alliances. She remained in contact with Louis XVIII of France and advocated for leniency toward her exiled sister, Julie. Plans to return to Sweden with Julie were thwarted by her husband’s concerns about the potential political ramifications.\n\nIn the midst of these intrigues, Désirée maintained close relationships with figures like Germaine de Staël and Juliette Récamier. However, tensions persisted in her marriage, with her husband appointing a Count of Montrichard to his household in 1817.\n\nThe Enigmatic Reign of Queen Désirée\n\nIn 1818, the ascension of her husband to the throne of Sweden bestowed upon Désirée the title of Queen. Despite this, she chose to remain in France, purportedly for health reasons, sparking curiosity among Parisian press and her acquaintances alike. Even after assuming the role of Queen, she maintained her incognito status, declining the Swedish Queen Dowager’s suggestion of having Swedish ladies-in-waiting, deeming it unnecessary while she lived in seclusion. Désirée continued to keep a low profile, refraining from hosting any court functions officially, yet she subtly exercised her royal influence by entertaining guests at her Thursday and Sunday receptions, albeit unofficially, all the while retaining the title of Countess.\n\nDuring this period, rumors swirled regarding her romantic liaison with the French Prime Minister, Duc de Richelieu, drawing considerable attention. Some narratives portray her as having captivated Louis XVIII with her charm, while others depict her pursuit of Richelieu, earning her the epithet of “crazy Queen.” Despite conflicting accounts, her infatuation with Richelieu persisted until his demise in 1822. While some suggest her motivations were politically driven, others assert her genuine affection, though Richelieu’s response remains a mystery.\n\nIn the summer of 1822, arrangements were made for her son, Oscar, to meet potential brides in Europe. Ultimately, a match was found with Josephine of Leuchtenberg, whom Désirée escorted to Sweden in 1823. Despite initial intentions to visit, she decided to remain in Sweden permanently. The warm reception she received upon her arrival in Stockholm, marked by a peculiar incident involving peasants’ chants for rain being mistaken for cheers for the Queen, added to the intrigue surrounding her.\n\nOn August 21, 1829, Désirée was crowned Queen of Sweden, albeit amidst apprehension and delays. Despite suggestions of converting to Lutheranism prior to her coronation, the matter was dismissed, and she was crowned as desired. Her coronation marked a symbolic assertion of her status as a rightful Queen. However, her aspirations to be crowned in Norway were thwarted due to her Catholic faith. Nonetheless, she became the first commoner to ascend to the throne of Sweden since the sixteenth century.\n\nDésirée’s relationship with her husband, Charles XIV John, was characterized by a peculiar blend of informality and amiability. Despite his occasional irritability, she was known to soothe him with a single firm word. Her disinterest in politics earned her praise, as she refrained from meddling in state affairs. However, her eccentricities, from her unconventional attire to her nocturnal habits, often raised eyebrows at court, where she was viewed with a hint of snobbery due to her humble origins.\n\nThroughout her reign, Désirée’s eccentricities remained a subject of fascination, from her unconventional wardrobe to her nocturnal carriage rides. Despite her aversion to religion, she accommodated her devout Catholic daughter-in-law’s wishes, albeit begrudgingly. Her preference for Rosersberg Palace and her peculiar fear of bats exemplified her idiosyncrasies, earning her the moniker of “Miss Calamity” among her ladies-in-waiting.\n\nDésirée’s legacy extended beyond Sweden, as she also held the title of Queen of Norway. Her philanthropic endeavors in Norway, particularly her patronage of the Eugenia Foundation, underscored her commitment to charitable causes. Despite the controversies and intrigues that surrounded her reign, Désirée left an indelible mark on Scandinavian history, embodying the complexities of royalty with her enigmatic persona.\n\nQueen Dowager Desideria: Court to Eccentricity\n\nIn the year 1844, the passing of Charles XIV John marked Desideria’s transition to Queen Dowager. Despite her new status, her son, King Oscar I, ensured her residence remained at the Royal Palace, obviating the need for any change in her living arrangements. Renowned for her graciousness, Desideria was much appreciated by her personnel, establishing a close and personal bond with Countess Clara Bonde, who remained a steadfast companion until her demise.\n\nDesideria’s philanthropy was discreet yet impactful, notably supporting impoverished noblewomen through sewing projects and patronizing various charitable entities, including the Women’s Society Girl School. French diplomat Bacourt observed her unchanged simplicity despite her royal standing, recognizing her as a woman of kindness.\n\nMaintaining her Parisian home on Rue d’Anjou under the care of her sister and French aides, Desideria contemplated a return to Paris in 1853, a plan thwarted by her aversion to sea travel, despite her arrangements to depart from Karlskrona with her grandson Oscar.\n\nHer later years were shadowed by concerns over Parisian urban developments under Haussmann, although an exception was made by Napoleon III to preserve her residence. She shared a cordial relationship with her daughter-in-law and empathy towards her grandson’s spouse, Louise of the Netherlands.\n\nWidowhood saw Desideria embracing eccentricity; her nocturnal lifestyle included unusual routines, such as her night-time carriage rides, often surprising the palace staff with her unconventional habits.\n\nDesideria was known for her spontaneous visits, endearing herself to many by distributing sweets, albeit without engaging in substantial conversations. Her night-time escapades in her carriage, known affectionately as “Kring Kring,” added to her unique character.\n\nDesideria’s final public appearance was at the Royal Swedish Opera, shortly before her death in Stockholm on December 17, 1860. Her life, marked by a blend of royal duty and personal quirks, remains a fascinating chapter in the history of the Swedish monarchy.\n\nAncestral Lineage of Queen Dowager Desideria\n\nQueen Dowager Desideria’s paternal lineage traces back to Joseph Clary, born on November 22, 1693, in Marseille, to Jacques Clary and Catherine Barosse. Joseph was the descendant of Antoine Clary and Marguerite Canolle, as well as Angelin Barosse and Jeanne Pélissière. He married Françoise Agnès Ammoric on February 27, 1724, in Marseille. Françoise, born on March 6, 1705, to François Ammoric and Jeanne Boisson, passed away on December 21, 1776.\n\nOn her maternal side, Queen Dowager Desideria’s grandparents were Joseph Ignace Somis, born around 1710 and died on April 29, 1750, in Marseille, son of Jean Louis Somis and Françoise Bouchard. He married Catherine Rose Soucheiron on May 27, 1736, in Marseille. Catherine, born on January 11, 1696, to François Soucheiron and Anne Cautier, passed away on February 18, 1776, also in Marseille.\n\nConclusion\n\nDesiree Clary’s life story is a vivid display of strength, courage, and resilience. From her initial existence as a merchant’s daughter to being an instrumental figure in Napoleon’s life, her influence in history is indisputable. Clary’s story serves as a timeless testament to the strength of women and the roles they played, often behind the scenes, in shaping the world we know today."
