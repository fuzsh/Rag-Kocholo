Julie Clary was the daughter of the rich silk manufacturer François Clary (1725-1794). Her sister Désirée was an early favourite of Napoleon I and became Queen of Sweden and Norway because of her marriage to Marshall Bernadotte. Julie married Napeoleon's elder brother Joseph Bonaparte on 1 Aug 1794. In 1797 they went to Rome where became ambassador and in 1800 they settled in Paris

After Napoleon crowned himself emperor she received the title of Imperial Princess. She preferred life in her chateau in Mortefontaine, Oise above court life in Paris. Her husband had affairs with other women and Napoleon made him King of Naples in 1806 she didn't follow him there until Napeoleon sent her after him in 1808. In 1808 Joseph was made King of Spain and Julie became Queen, but she continued to live at Mortefontaine and never resided in Spain.

After Napoleon was defeated in 1814 she moved to Switzerland, where she bought the castle of Prangins. When Napoleon returned to France in 1815 she was in Paris to welcome him. After Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo, Joseph moved to the USA. Julie took her daughters to Frankfurt am Main where she lived for six years. Afterwards she lived in Brussels and at the Serristori Palace in Florence.

Joseph returned to Europe in 1840 and joined her in Florence. They hadn't seen each other for 25 years. He died there in 1844 and Julie died in 1845 in Florence as well.
