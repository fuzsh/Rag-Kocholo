The Walt Disney Company (Disney for short) is an American multimedia conglomerate mostly known for their film studio, iconic cartoons such as Mickey Mouse and its film franchises from Disney's brands. Even though it was a competitor to 21st Century Fox until its acquisition, it is often parodied, homaged and referenced on The Simpsons.

Acquisition of 21st Century Fox[]

On December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced that it would acquire copyrights and distribution rights to the majority of 21st Century Fox's assets. This would include 20th Century Fox, National Geographic, FX Networks, X-Men, Star Wars, Futurama, Family Guy, and of course, The Simpsons. 20th Century Fox Television would still produce the shows as a unit of Disney Television Studios. The deal did not include the FOX network, the Fox News Channel and its Sports channels. The deal was completed on March 20, 2019.

On April 11, 2019, it was confirmed that The Simpsons would be added to the upcoming Disney+ streaming service, which launched in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands on November 12, 2019, with all the episodes, (with the exception of "Stark Raving Dad" due to it being pulled from rotation after headlines were made about the Michael Jackson scandal)[1][2], which effectively replaced FX's "Simpsons World" streaming service.[3] A Simpsons short titled "Welcome to the Family, The Simpsons!" was released by the company on April 11, 2019, with the Simpson family not only promoting Disney+, but also lampooning Disney's corporate synergy and media consolidation, indicating that, much like the show's previous corporate parent Fox before it, Disney will continue to be a target of the show's satirical humor. Another short was released by the company in November 2019, with the Simpson family dressed as characters representing the library presented on Disney+ (a reluctant Bart Simpson as Mickey Mouse (representing Disney), Marge Simpson as Bo Peep (representing Pixar), Homer Simpson as Tony Stark/Iron Man (representing Marvel), Maggie Simpson as The Child (representing Star Wars) and Lisa Simpson as an iceberg (representing National Geographic). All 30 seasons of the series debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019, but is instead presented in a non-HD format. Instead of presenting them in their original aspect ratio, they were either cropped to fit widescreen televisions or were stretched out in the same manner. FXX's now-defunct "Simpsons World" streaming service was similarly criticized when it launched. In response, Disney stated they would make the ability to watch the episodes of the first 19 seasons and some from season 20 in either the 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio in early 2020.

On May 28, 2020, Disney+ officially made episodes of The Simpsons from episodes of season 1 to some episodes of season 20 available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio.
