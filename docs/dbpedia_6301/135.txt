20th Century Fox Television was a former American television production company owned by Walt Disney Television, which ultimately became a division of Disney Television Studios. Since the acquisition of much of 21st Century Fox on March 20, 2019, it has been owned by The Walt Disney Company. 20th Television was the distribution arm of 20th Century Fox Television.

On August 10, 2020, Disney announced that 20th Century Fox Television would be renamed 20th Television, and that the two companies would merge together to avoid branding confusion of then-current formed, Fox Corporation.[1]

History
