        "text": "This article is about the organisation which owns the companies that distribute Futurama. For other uses, see Fox.\n\nTwentieth Century Studios, formerly Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, often known simply as 20th Century Studios, is an American film studio currently owned by The Walt Disney Company. It is the parent company of the entities most directly involved with the creation of Futurama, including 20th Century Fox Television (production), 20th Television (syndication). Until 2019, it was under the same ownership as the Fox Broadcasting Company (broadcaster from 1999 to 2003), which has since been spun-off into the Fox Corporation.\n\nAs 20th Century Fox, the studio was often confused for the network, as well as parts of its production companies, which can be attributed to the use of it's own production logo for different entities, which develops into the confusion of these names.\n\nParts involved with Futurama\n\n20th Television (formerly 20th Century Fox Television) – the production company of Futurama during its original run as well as its second run.\n\n20th Century Home Entertainment (formerly 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment) – the production company for the Futurama films, that also became season 5, as well as the distributor for all home media releases.\n\n20th Television – the company responsible for handling Futurama's syndication.\n\n20th Television Animation (formerly Fox Television Animation) – production company for Futurama beginning with season 8. Credited within the show as \"30th Television Animation.\"\n\nFox Broadcasting Company (until 2019) – the television network that aired the show during its original run.\n\nSee also\n\n30th Century Fox – its 31st century counterpart."
