        "text": "Fox Corporation is an American mass media company that was formed in 2019 as a result of the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company. The assets that were not acquired by Disney were spun off from 21st Century Fox to create the new Fox Corporation. The company is headquartered in New York City, New York, United States.\n\nFox Corporation is involved in producing and distributing content through some of the world's leading and most valued brands. These brands include FOX News, FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment, and the FOX Television Stations. FOX News Channel, a part of Fox Corporation, has been the most-watched television news channel for over 18 consecutive years. FOX Sports is the umbrella entity representing Fox Corporation's wide array of multi-platform US-based sports assets. It includes national networks such as FS1, FS2, and FOX Deportes, as well as FOX Soccer Plus and a majority stake in the Big Ten Network. FOX Sports covers a wide range of sports events and programming.\n\nFOX Television Stations, another division of Fox Corporation, owns and operates 29 full-power broadcast television stations in the U.S. Out of these stations, 18 are affiliated with the FOX Network. In addition to distributing sports, entertainment, and syndicated content, the television stations collectively produce nearly 1,000 hours of local news every week. They cater to viewer, distributor, and advertiser demand for the FOX Network's national content.\n\nWith over 7,700 employees, Fox Corporation is considered one of the top 2000 largest public companies in the world and one of the World's Most Valuable Brands according to Forbes. The company has a significant presence in the media industry and continues to provide diverse and engaging content to its audience.\n\nFox Corporation, an American mass media company, has an interesting history that traces back to the early 20th century. The origins of Fox Corporation can be traced back to the establishment of the Fox Film Corporation by William Fox on February 1, 1915. The company quickly became a major player in the film industry, producing and distributing numerous successful films.\n\nOver the years, Fox Film Corporation went through various mergers and acquisitions. In 1935, it merged with 20th Century Pictures to form 20th Century Fox. The newly formed company continued to produce successful films and established itself as a prominent Hollywood studio. In 1985, media mogul Rupert Murdoch's company, News Corporation, acquired 20th Century Fox, expanding its global media empire. Under Murdoch's leadership, the company continued to grow and diversify its portfolio.\n\nIn 2013, News Corporation underwent a corporate restructuring, which led to the separation of its entertainment assets from its publishing assets. This separation resulted in the formation of two separate companies: 21st Century Fox, which consisted of entertainment assets, and News Corp, which focused on publishing.\n\nFox Corporation is a publicly traded American multinational mass media company. It was formed in 2019 as a result of the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company. The remaining assets that were not acquired by Disney were spun off to create Fox Corporation. The company is operated and controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch and is headquartered in New York City.\n\nFox Corporation operates in the television broadcast, news, and sports broadcasting industries. Its portfolio includes the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Television Stations, Fox News, Fox Business, the national operations of Fox Sports, and other related entities. Rupert Murdoch serves as the Chairman of the Board, while his son Lachlan Murdoch is the Executive Chair and CEO of the company. The Murdoch family, through a family trust, holds a 39.6% ownership share and controls the company.\n\nThe history of Fox Corporation can be traced back to the Fox Film Corporation, which was founded in 1915 by William Fox. Over the years, through a series of mergers and demergers, the company evolved to its current form.\n\nIn 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced its intent to acquire the motion picture, cable entertainment, and direct broadcast satellite divisions of 21st Century Fox. The remaining assets were separated to form \"New Fox,\" which became Fox Corporation. The acquisition was completed in 2019, and Fox Corporation began operating as a separate entity.\n\nSince its formation, Fox Corporation has engaged in various strategic moves and acquisitions. It acquired a stake in Canadian online gambling operator The Stars Group, resulting in a partnership to develop sports betting products for the U.S. market under the branding Fox Bet. The company also acquired Credible Labs, an online marketplace for consumer credit products, and the animation studio Bento Box Entertainment. In 2020, Fox Corporation acquired streaming service Tubi, expanding its digital content offerings.\n\nIn recent years, Fox Corporation has continued to evolve and expand its operations. It acquired TMZ from WarnerMedia, entered into the film and television production business with the acquisition of MarVista Entertainment, and launched Fox Entertainment Studios for in-house television production. The company also explored a potential merger with News Corp, which was later abandoned.\n\nWith its diverse portfolio of media assets, Fox Corporation remains a prominent player in the media industry, delivering news, entertainment, and sports content to audiences worldwide."
