        "text": "Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the Top 20 Times The Simpsons Made Fun of Disney. For this list, we’ll be looking at moments where Springfield took aim at the Magic Kingdom, whether it was before or after The Simpsons joined the Mickey Mouse Club. Which “Simpsons” satire did you find the most savage? Let us know in the comments.\n\n#20: “Frozen” Coach Gag\n\n“I Won't Be Home for Christmas”\n\nEven more than a year after its release, “Frozen” continued to rage on. When the latest “Simpsons” Christmas special came to town, a reference to the Disney blockbuster seemed inevitable. This couch gag naturally casts Lisa as the misunderstood Elsa with Marge as Anna, Bart as Kristoff, Margie as a troll, and Satan’s Little Helper sporting Sven’s reindeer antlers. Bart isn’t interested in building a snowman, but he instigates a snowball fight. The cold doesn’t bother Lisa, but Bart does, retaliating against him with an ice palace. Homer also appears as Olaf, in the market for a new nose. Since then, Krusty, Patty, Selma, and Principal Skinner have had their own “Frozen” experiences with the storm showing no end in sight.\n\n#19: Homer Meets Genie\n\n“MyPods and Boomsticks”\n\nWe all know Dan Castellaneta as the voice of Homer Simpson. However, did you know that Castellaneta also filled in for Robin Williams as the Genie in “The Return of Jafar,” the “Aladdin,” TV series, and the “Kingdom Hearts” games? Universes collide in this episode where Homer has an Arabian nightmare. Riding a magic carpet, Homer rubs a lamp to release a blue Genie, voiced by Castellaneta. Just like the Disney version, this genie has a never-ending arsenal of impressions up his sleeve, including Jack Nicholson. It’s all fun and pop culture references until the Genie starts transforming Western society, much to a misguided Homer’s horror. Nobody can top Williams, but this in-joke has us looking back at Castellaneta’s Genie with fonder memories.\n\n#18: “Shady and the Vamp”\n\n“Love, Springfieldian Style”\n\n“The Simpsons” has parodied “Lady and the Tramp” numerous times, particularly the iconic pasta kiss, which works just as well with a chilidog. In Season 19, the show dedicated an entire segment to the 1955 tale of puppy love. At first, the parody sticks closely to the film with Marge as an aristocratic dog and Homer as a mutt from the other side of the dog track. Things take a darker turn when the Vamp becomes pregnant and Shady straight-up abandons her. Shady does come around to fatherhood following a misadventure at the pound, complete with a Goofy knockoff. (You’ll all be working for Disney soon enough!) However, Shady isn’t prepared for now many puppies that the Vamp has. Where’s Cruella when you need her?\n\n#17: Trash-Talking California Adventure\n\n“The Great Louse Detective”\n\nNowadays, California Adventure is regarded as a worthy addition to the Disneyland Resort with several must-see attractions. That wasn’t always the case. Opening with a massive amount of hype, many were disappointed with the lack of Disney’s signature magic. Before Bob Iger initiated an overdue makeover, the Simpsons expressed their frustration with the park in an episode fittingly titled, “The Great Louse Detective.” At a prison packed with killers and other criminals, the kids note that it’s still a better family destination than Disneyland’s lesser neighbor. Homer and Marge can’t argue otherwise. With Mother Simpson on the run in another episode, Homer plots to hide her somewhere virtually deserted. Wanna take a guess what the punchline is? Avengers Campus can’t get here soon enough.\n\n#16: Lisa & The Seven Dwarfs\n\n“​​Four Great Women and a Manicure”\n\nBefore commencing this timeless tale, Lisa reminds Springfield’s resident lawyer that “Snow White” is a public domain fairytale. While Lisa’s version also takes a few notes from the Disney classic, parody is thankfully fair use. Not only are the dwarfs assigned clever names that align with their “Simpsons” counterparts, but we get an earworm of a song that echoes “Heigh Ho.” Lisa casts herself as the titular princess with Groundskeeper Willie playing the huntsman. Unlike Snow White, Lisa is smart enough to realize when someone is offering her a poisoned apple. The Queen thus forces it down her throat. Instead of a prince, Lisa is saved by a female doctor, which honestly sounds like something that would happen in a live-action Disney remake.\n\n#15: Bill Cipher\n\n“Bart's in Jail!”\n\nShows like “Gravity Falls” provide the missing link between Disney and “The Simpsons.” The series might’ve aired on Disney’s kid-oriented networks, but the writing channeled “The Simpsons’” wit. Unsurprisingly, creator Alex Hirsch grew up watching “The Simpsons,” knowing the show so well that he could differentiate seasons based on the size of the characters’ pupils. It was a dream come true for Hirsch when he got to lend his voice to “The Simpsons” as Gravity Falls’ greatest threat, Bill Cipher. The Norse god of mischief Loki takes on various forms in this episode, including Bill, who has gone from endorsing gold to championing crypto. Granted, this all might be an appetizer-induced fantasy, but as Bill would say, reality itself is an illusion.\n\n#14: Mouse Ears\n\n“The Simpsons Movie” (2007)\n\nUpon release, “The Simpsons Movie” was the highest-grossing non-Disney traditionally animated feature. We guess that record technically doesn’t apply anymore, seeing how the film has become a Disney property. This makes the film’s digs at Disney even funnier. If you thought the death of Bambi’s mother was traumatic, just wait until you see Homer and Marge get a fairytale happy ending in front of Alaska’s woodland critters. Mickey isn’t safe from ridicule either. Rummaging through luggage, Bart plops a black bra on his head. With a high-pitched voice, he imitates Disney’s corporate mascot. Bart may be chuckling now, but in just over a decade, he’ll have to put on a pair of mouse ears for real. We suppose Mickey got the last laugh.\n\n#13: Boozing with Goofy\n\n“Plusaversary”\n\n“The Simpsons” has produced a few Disney+ exclusive shorts, including the villain-themed “Welcome to the Club.” 2021’s “Plusaversary” packs the most Disney references. Some feared that franchises like “The Simpsons” might be toned down under the Mouse’s umbrella. This short solidified that this wouldn’t be the case. On the contrary, Disney allowed “The Simpsons” to depict some of their most treasured characters in a more mature light. Most notably, Goofy throws back a few beers with Homer. Hey, it’s not as bad as when Goofy was a smoker. Characters from Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel are present to hear Lisa’s song about streaming, the world’s most lucrative babysitter. It’s the moment where “The Simpsons” making fun of Disney became Disney making fun of Disney.\n\n#12: Duff Gardens\n\n“Selma's Choice”\n\nAlthough the name is a play on Busch Gardens, Duff Gardens takes just as many shots at Disneyland. In addition to the Seven Duffs and Beer Hall of Presidents, the park’s main attraction is The Little Land of Duff. Sending up It’s A Small World with a song that you’ll find either incredibly catchy or annoying, the boat ride unites all the cultures of the world in their mutual love of liquor. It’s hilarious that nobody questions the alcoholic branding of this supposed family-friendly park. The kids might not be old enough to drink beer, but nothing is stopping Lisa from drinking the ride’s water. What was already a surreal ride becomes even trippier, sending the “Lizard Queen” running into the Main Street Electrical Parade.\n\n#11: Under the Sea\n\n“Homer Badman”\n\nThe same year “The Simpsons” made its debut as a series, Disney kicked off an animation renaissance with “The Little Mermaid.” As different as they are, both projects would change the medium forever. They ultimately merged five years later when Homer finds himself in hot water. To escape the allegations against him, Homer proposes that his family move away… under the sea. Homer envisions an Underwater Wonderland where the media can’t get to him and there are plenty of sea friends to eat. Singing a joyous song while stuffing his face, Homer leaves a trail of aquatic skeletons behind. Leave it to Marge to burst Homer’s bubble. Homer has seen “Little Mermaid” one too many times, that is until he tapes over it.\n\n#10: The 20th Century Fox Acquisition\n\n“When You Dish Upon a Star”\n\nThe title of this Season 10 episode, “When You Dish Upon a Star,” is an obvious take on Disney anthem, “When You Wish Upon a Star.” While the episode has nothing to do with “Pinocchio,” it did predict that the stars would one day align for Disney to purchase the show’s parent company, Fox. Through a visual gag, it’s noted that 20th Century Fox is “A Division of Walt Disney Co.” At the time, this was presumably poking fun at Disney’s recent acquisitions of the ABC and ESPN networks. The joke wound up being even more relevant nearly 20 years later, however, when Disney entered negotiations to purchase Fox. The deal officially went through in March 2019, making “The Simpsons” part of the Disney family.\n\n#9: Copyright Expired\n\n“Lisa the Beauty Queen”\n\nIt’s no secret that Disney is very protective of its property. If your product invites too much comparison to the Disney brand, a lawsuit is likely on the horizon. So when Principal Skinner uses the slogan, “The Happiest Place on Earth,” for the school carnival, Disneyland threatens to sue Springfield Elementary. What Disney’s lawyers don’t realize is that Skinner was a Green Beret in the United States Army. Before a legal battle can ensue, Skinner commences a literal battle that leaves the lawyer and one of his bodyguards whimpering on the ground. Another Disney minion attempts to get away, but Skinner sends him packing with a mouse-eared briefcase. Of course, now that Disney owns “The Simpsons,” we shouldn’t expect any more copyright wars.\n\n#8: Shary Bobbins\n\n“Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious”\n\nThis practically perfect episode parodies Disney’s “Mary Poppins”- although Shary Bobbins claims upfront that she’s an “original creation.” Julie Andrews herself was actually set to voice this send-up of her iconic character, but the producers ultimately gave the role to Maggie Roswell, the voice of Maude Flanders. The episode puts several satirical spins on classic Sherman Brothers songs, including “The Perfect Nanny,” “A Spoonful of Sugar,” and “Feed the Birds.” We also get Groundskeeper Willie channeling Bert and Mr. Burns flying a kite. Unlike the Banks family though, the Simpsons remains completely dysfunctional, prompting Shary to fly away with her umbrella. Given the character’s hilariously dark exit, we probably shouldn’t plan on seeing “Shary Bobbins Returns” anytime soon.\n\n#7: “See My Vest”\n\n“Two Dozen and One Greyhounds”\n\nIn addition to referencing the famous spaghetti scene from “Lady and the Tramp,” this episode largely satirizes “One Hundred and One Dalmatians.” When the Simpsons find themselves looking after 25 greyhound puppies, Mr. Burns kidnaps the dogs in order to make them into a tuxedo. Instead of Cruella de Vil’s song, however, Burns borrows a few notes from the “Be Our Guest” number in “Beauty and the Beast.” Sadly, the puppies won’t be the first animals to have died in the name of fashion, as Mr. Burns shows off his wardrobe of turtles’ necks, grizzly bear underwear, and a vest made from gorilla chest. Burns sings the tune with the same upbeat charisma as Lumière, which is hysterically at odds with its grim, even graphic subject matter.\n\n#6: Diz-Nee Land\n\nVarious Episodes\n\nA not-so-subtle imitation of various Disney parks, Diz-Nee Land is briefly seen in Season 2. The amusement park resurfaces in Season 26 and this time the writers come off as much more cynical, describing it as “The Happiest Hell on Earth.” A lengthy car trip is followed by an even more tedious journey simply to enter the park. Once inside, the Simpsons end up bleeding their wallets dry and sitting through repetitive rides. The episode also draws attention to Disney’s acquisition of “Star Wars” and the overhaul to make “Pirates of the Caribbean” more “politically correct.” A Springfield-themed area is currently located at Universal Studios, but it’ll be beyond ironic if “Simpsons” attractions start popping up in Disneyland later down the line.\n\n#5: Mixar\n\n“Angry Dad: The Movie”\n\nAt any Oscar or Golden Globe ceremony, Pixar is almost always a safe bet for Best Animated Feature. When Bart’s short film garners award buzz, he faces fierce competition in an animation powerhouse called Mixar. One of the key Mixar personnel is the spitting image of John Lasseter, from the glasses to the Hawaiian shirt. The Mixar staff aren’t quick to make friends with the competition, enlisting Randy Newman to sing a song entitled “You’ve Got an Enemy.” They also have a giant Luxo lamp, Mr. Carrot Head, and WALL-E-like robot in their corner. The Mixar short in contention is “Condiments,” a CGI western that spoofs Pixar’s tendency to give inanimate objects life and create worlds within worlds. And yes, this episode predated “Sausage Party.”\n\n#4: EFCOT Center\n\n“Special Edna”\n\nLet’s be honest, if you’re going to visit a Florida theme park, Epcot probably isn’t top of the list. The Simpsons’ EFCOT Center does little to distinguish itself from EPCOT with its signature structure being a large geodesic sphere. Homer is bored from the second they fly over the park, which is advertised as the place you go “when everything else is booked.” The park’s vision of the future apparently hasn’t been updated since the late 60s and it really shows. Eventually, Homer decides to make a break for Disney World, although he’s horrified to learn that the churros are $14. As many jabs as the episode takes at Epcot, the writers have to admit that Disney parks do have some incredible restaurants.\n\n#3: Itchy the Lucky Mouse\n\n“The Day the Violence Died”\n\nWe all know who Walt Disney is, but fewer people are familiar with Mickey’s co-creator, Ub Iwerks. In this episode, it’s revealed that Roger Meyers stole the character Itchy from another animator in 1928, the same year Mickey made his debut. This doesn’t exactly parallel Disney and Iwerks’ partnership, as both played a hand in creating Mickey. That being said, there’s no denying that the public associates Mickey more with Disney than Iwerks. Roger Meyers is clearly meant to be a Walt Disney parody, right down to a line about him being cryogenically frozen. Of course, the episode could also be seen as a shot at Charles Mintz, a distributor who took control of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit away from his creators, Disney and Iwerks.\n\n#2: The Roger Meyers Story\n\n“Itchy & Scratchy Land”\n\nA vacation to Itchy & Scratchy Land invites numerous possibilities for parodies, including a documentary about fictional founder Roger Meyers, Sr. The documentary depicts Meyers as a seemingly wholesome figure who actually had a few skeletons in his closet. Just as Walt Disney has been accused by some of being anti-Semitic, Meyers landed in hot water for his controversial cartoon, “Nazi Supermen are Our Superiors.” Meyers’ filmography also includes an ultra-violent version of “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” entitled “Scratchtasia.” His follow-up feature is a “Pinocchio” parody called “Pinnitchio,” which is perhaps even more shocking than the original novel by Carlo Collodi. A manic Scratchy robot destroys the screen before the documentary’s conclusion, but we can’t help but wonder if Itchy and Scratchy ever got the Bambi treatment.\n\n#1: “Kimba, I Mean Simba”\n\n“Round Springfield”\n\nWhen the late Bleeding Gums Murphy appears to Lisa in the sky, it’s hard not to think about Mufasa’s heavenly message to Simba. Actually, Mufasa appears alongside Bleeding Gums with Darth Vader and James Earl Jones. While “The Lion King” lampoon is evident, there’s another joke that might’ve flown over your head. Mufasa accidentally says “Kimba” instead of “Simba.” Animation fans will know that this is a reference to “Kimba the White Lion,” an anime series from the 60s that shares an astonishing amount in common with the Disney film. “Lion King” directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff claim they had no knowledge of the anime while making their film, but this moment seems to be suggesting that somebody at Disney was familiar with it."
