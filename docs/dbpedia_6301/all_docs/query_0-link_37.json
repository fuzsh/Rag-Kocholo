        "text": "20th Television (formerly known as 20th Century Fox Television) is the television production and former distribution arm of 20th Century Studios and is a subsidiary of Walt Disney Television, which is part of The Walt Disney Company.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Production codes\n\n3 List of shows produced by 20th Century Fox Television/20th Television\n\n3.1 Folded from Fox 21 Television Studios/Touchstone Television\n\n3.2 Miniseries / TV Movies\n\n4 Logos\n\n5 Related Pages\n\n6 References\n\n7 External Links\n\nHistory\n\n20th Century Fox Television was founded in 1949, around the same time that other movie studios were branching out into television production. At the time, the company was known as TCF Television Productions, Inc. until 1955. TCFT folded the operations of television production companies it acquired: Metromedia Producers Corporation in 1986, New World Entertainment in 1997, and MTM Enterprises in 1998. This also includes 20th Television, the current distributor for most of the shows originally produced by each company.\n\nSince 1986, TCFT had served as FOX's official production arm (with Fox Television Studios being viewed as the unofficial production division), producing the bulk of TV shows airing on the network. The company produced the first two shows that aired on sister network MyNetworkTV; Desire and Fashion House.\n\nIn 1989, the functions of 20th Century Fox Television were taken over by Twentieth Television Corporation, a separate entity from Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. Both companies were subsidiaries of News Corporation unit Fox Inc. The move was made to separate the television productions from the movie studio for an increase in the studio's output. After the 1994 restructuring of Fox's television production companies, 20th Television refocused on syndication and \"non-traditional programming\" while network programs once again came back under the 20th Century Fox Television banner and to being a division of the movie studio.\n\nIn 2012, TCFT got reorganized as a separate unit of News Corporation, and chairs Dana Walden and Gary Newman reported to Chase Carey, who is the CEO of 21st Century Fox. Two years later, operations of the Fox Broadcasting Company and 20th Century Fox Television were merged into the Fox Television Group, overseen by Walden and Newman.\n\nOn December 14, 2017, it was announced that The Walt Disney Company would be purchasing most of 21st Century Fox's assets, including the 20th Century Fox film studio, 20th Century Fox Television, 20th Television and FX. The FOX network, Fox Television Stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Channel and the 20th Century Fox studio lot were not included in the deal but were spun off into a separate company, Fox Corporation, while FSN was sold off to the Sinclair Broadcast Group. The Disney-21st Century Fox deal obtained antitrust approval of the US Department of Justice Antitrust division, the European Commission and most other foreign regulatory bodies and, as of February 2019, required only approval from Brazil and Mexico to be finalized, with the finalization of the sale completed on March 20, 2019.[1][2]\n\nOn January 17, 2020, Disney changed the name of TCFT parent 20th Century Fox to 20th Century Studios to distance that company from the Fox name.[3] On August 10, 2020, TCFT was rebranded once again as 20th Television as the Fox part of the name was dropped to avoid brand confusion, while what had been the distribution division 20th Television was folded into Disney-ABC Domestic Television, and sister company Fox 21 Television Studios was renamed as the new Touchstone Television (which had been the original name of what later became ABC Studios and is now ABC Signature).[4]\n\nProduction codes\n\nThe format for free-to-air network produced shows is YSSSEE, where Y is the season identifier from 1 to Z, S is the three letter show identifier and E is a two digit episode number during that season. These are burned-in on the end copyright slate.\n\nList of shows produced by 20th Century Fox Television/20th Television\n\nTitle Format Buyer Year(s) Crusade in Europe Military documentary ABC 1949 The 20th Century-Fox Hour Anthology CBS 1955–1957 My Friend Flicka Western CBS 1956–1957 Broken Arrow Western ABC 1956–1958 Man Without a Gun Western Syndication 1957–1959 How to Marry a Millionaire Sitcom Syndication 1957–1959 The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis Sitcom CBS 1959–1963 Five Fingers Adventure drama NBC 1959–1960 Adventures in Paradise Adventure ABC 1959–1962 Hong Kong Adventure drama ABC 1960–1961 Follow the Sun Drama ABC 1961–1962 Bus Stop Drama ABC 1961–1962 Margie Sitcom ABC 1961–1962 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea Sci-fi ABC 1964–1968 Peyton Place Soap Opera ABC 1964–1969 Valentine's Day Sitcom ABC 1964–1965 12 O'Clock High War drama ABC 1964–1967 Daniel Boone Historical adventure NBC 1964–1970 The Legend of Jesse James Western ABC 1965–1966 Lost in Space Sci-fi CBS 1965–1968 The Long, Hot Summer Drama ABC 1965–1966 The Loner Western CBS 1965–1966 Blue Light Espionage adventure drama ABC 1966 Batman Crime comedy ABC 1966–1968 The Monroes Western ABC 1966–1967 The Man Who Never Was Action drama ABC 1966–1967 The Tammy Grimes Show Sitcom ABC 1966 The Time Tunnel Action science fiction ABC 1966–1967 The Green Hornet Action / crime drama ABC 1966–1967 The Felony Squad Crime drama ABC 1966–1969 Custer Military-western ABC 1967 Judd for the Defense Legal drama ABC 1967–1969 Julia Sitcom NBC 1968–1971 The Ghost and Mrs. Muir Sitcom NBC 1968–1969 CBS 1969–1970 Land of the Giants Sci-fi ABC 1968–1970 Lancer Western CBS 1968–1970 Journey to the Unknown Sci-fi / thriller anthology ABC 1968–1969 Room 222 Dramedy ABC 1969–1974 Bracken's World Drama NBC 1969–1970 Nanny and the Professor Fantasy sitcom ABC 1970–1971 The Best of Everything Soap Opera ABC 1970 Here Comes the Double Deckers!
