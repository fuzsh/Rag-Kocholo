Meanwhile, ABC Studios and ABC Signature will collectively become ABC Signature, while Fox 21 Television Studios has been renamed Touchstone Television.\n\nMore from Variety\n\n'Mulan' Approved for China Theatrical Release\n\nWalt Disney World to Shorten Theme Park Hours\n\nESPN Plus Price Getting Hiked to $6 Monthly for New Customers\n\nNixing “Fox” from 20th TV was part of the negotiated merger terms between Disney and 21st Century Fox in order to prevent confusion among consumers. On the film side, 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight removed “Fox” from their names in January.\n\nIf Touchstone Television sounds familiar, that’s because it was a legacy Disney-owned TV brand name that had gone into retirement over a decade ago in 2007. The company is now looking to meld its heritage with its newer components, hence the new Touchstone logo’s resemblance to the Fox 21 logo.\n\nThe changes to the studios’ branding are effective immediately, although each studio’s new name and logo may not be fully integrated into their branding until the end of 2020. All new episodes produced by 20th TV, ABC Signature and Touchstone TV will be tagged with the new motion end cards, while library episodes will continue to feature the old motion end cards.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nThe Best Amazon Prime Movies to Watch Right Now\n\nThe Best Movies on Netflix\n\nBest Horror Movies to Watch on Netflix Right Now"
