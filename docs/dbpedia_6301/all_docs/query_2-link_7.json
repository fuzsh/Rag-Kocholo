        "text": "150 years, 5 generations, 1 home of good malt.\n\nFounded in 1862, Simpsons Malt is a fifth-generation, family-owned business.\n\nSimpsons Malt has a passion for making high-quality malts that are renowned for their exceptional taste and flavour, helping the world’s best brewers and distillers to craft the very finest beers and whiskies.\n\nThis drive for quality begins with the barley used and Simpsons Malt is unique in that it has its own agricultural merchanting division – McCreath Simpson & Prentice (MSP) – built within the business. This ensures that its malts are only produced from certified seeds of the finest UK two-row barley, while the company’s team of in-house agronomists are on-hand to offer advice and products to these growers throughout the season.\n\nEvery harvest, Simpsons Malt procures more than 400,000 tonnes of barley and, with direct access to these growers through MSP, it means that each crop is fully traceable, guaranteeing the provenance of each malt from grain to glass.\n\nHaving a close relationship with growers has also helped Simpsons Malt to drive on-farm sustainability. More than 400 of the company’s farming partners who grow malting barley on contract are verified to Gold level on the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA). These farmers are part of the only FSA Gold verified Farm Management Group in the UK, which means that they can demonstrate that they use first class sustainable farming practices.\n\nSustainability is also at the core of Simpsons Malt’s operations at its two malting sites in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland and Tivetshall St Margaret, Norfolk. The company is working on carbon reduction plans across each department, with various projects having been completed – or currently in progress – to meet annual targets on the road to the overall goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nWith a focus on continual investment, Simpsons Malt has the latest, state-of-the-art plant technology at its two malting sites – including five roasting drums at Tivetshall St Margaret, which makes the company’s renowned crystal and roasted malts. This constant innovation and drive to improve processes ensures the consistent production of high-quality malts."
