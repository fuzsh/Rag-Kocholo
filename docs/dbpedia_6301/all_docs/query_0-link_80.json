        "text": "In a blockbuster deal that could help reshape the media landscape, Disney will acquire a majority of the assets of Twenty-First Century Fox — including its storied Hollywood studio, its TV studio and 22 regional sports networks.\n\nThe all-stock $52.4 billion deal will help Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger’s plan to turn a mostly analog entertainment giant into a digital powerhouse better able to battle Netflix, Facebook, Amazon and other content streamers.\n\nFox will retain its Fox News Channel, Fox Broadcasting, its stations group and Fox Business Network, among other non-entertainment assets — which it will spin off into a new publicly traded company.\n\nGBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives called the purchase a “home-run deal.”\n\n“[W]hile it’s an aggressive acquisition with a high price tag, in our opinion this is the right move at the right time as the marriage of these assets creates a much more formidable Disney on both the content and streaming front for the coming years — with its primary goal to invade Netflix’s ‘golden streaming sandbox’ when it launches its competitive service in 2019,” Ives said.\n\nBTIG media analyst Rich Greenfield said the deal has more upside for Fox than Disney.\n\n“It’s a brilliant deal for Fox,” Greenfield said. “[Fox Executive Chairman] Rupert [Murdoch] is recognizing that the industry is changing … he’s doing the best thing for shareholders and himself.”\n\nThe analyst was not so kind to Iger.\n\n“This really buries Disney in the past,” Greenfield added. “This is two struggling media companies together battling the Netflixes, Facebooks and Amazons of the world.”\n\n“It seems like they’re doubling down on the past,” Greenfield said. “I know Disney keeps using the word ‘transformational,’ but what’s transformational about this?”\n\nIger sees the Fox assets as helping with his long-range plan for Disney.\n\n“The acquisition of this stellar collection of businesses from Twenty-First Century Fox reflects the increasing consumer demand for a rich diversity of entertainment experiences that are more compelling, accessible and convenient than ever before,” Iger said in a statement.\n\nPart of Iger’s transformative plan is to debut ESPN Plus, a sports-programming streaming service, in the spring.\n\nBuying Fox’s RSNs will help ESPN battle cord-cutting by budget-conscious, pay-TV subscribers — which has caused the cable sports giant to lose 13 million subscribers in recent years.\n\nIger also has plans to roll out a streaming service built around its Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm studios — and the addition of the 20th Century Fox film studio will make that offering more robust.\n\nThe Fox film stable includes Marvel’s “X-Men,” the one part of the comic book franchise Disney didn’t own.\n\nDisney is also buying Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable assets, its 30 percent stake in Hulu, and several international satellite channels such as Star India and Sky Italia.\n\nFor Iger, the deal is the largest ever for Disney and is the crowning achievement in his years-long effort to transform the Burbank, Calif., company to one less reliant on ad revenue and box office receipts.\n\nIger, who will receive a $100 million stock award for pulling off the deal, has agreed to extend his contract expiration from mid-2019 to the end of 2021.\n\nOn the flip side, the deal will give Fox shareholders a 25 percent stake in Disney.\n\nThe Murdoch family, which controls Fox, will own 5 percent of Disney.\n\nFox Chief Executive James Murdoch will work with Iger on the transition.\n\nThere have been reports that he will end up in a high-level management role at Disney after the deal is done.\n\nIger deflected questions on the subject during a conference call on Thursday.\n\nCalling the deal a “pivot” not a “retreat,” Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch said, “The new Fox will draw upon the powerful live news and sports businesses of Fox, as well as the strength of our broadcast network.”\n\nThe deal, a horizontal merger, is subject to federal regulatory approval.\n\nDisney shares closed up 2.7 percent, at $110.57. Fox shares closed up 6.5 percent, at $34.88."
