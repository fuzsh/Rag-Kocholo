        "text": "â€œIn the late 1950s our grandfather Richard L. Simpson travelled to Holland, where he researched a new style of malting in operation. In the Saladin box, an instrument that allowed for barley to be mechanically turned two or three times a day, he saw the potential for competitive, efficient and consistent malting quality, all year round.\n\nThis marked a significant change from his existing floor maltings, where grain had to be turned by hand to prevent matting, often at the mercy of external factors like the weather.\n\nOn his return to England, our grandfather instructed his engineers to build a pilot Saladin box and soon realised that this style of operation would mean that all his malting could be done in one place, rather than across the 17 malting floors that were currently in use. The new Saladin box malting was built in Berwick in the early 1960s."
