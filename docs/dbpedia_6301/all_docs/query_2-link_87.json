The website contains various information for the series, including episode recaps, character biographies, and episode clips. In September 2011, the website revamped its content and now has an interactive \"Springfield Career Day\", where readers can switch between booths to find out different information. In 2015, the website was revamped again and was called Simpsons World. Currently, the website redirects to the page of The Simpsons on FOX.com.\n\nCharacter biographies[edit]\n\nThe website has the biographies of only the main and side characters. Characters are sorted by their last name and each has a few paragraphs for a biography as well as at least one user interactive object with each character's biography, and a photo.\n\nThere is also a \"The Simpsons Filing Cabinet Giveaway\", where every day a visitor to TheSimpsons.com gets an exclusive piece of animation. One of the pieces of animation is Nelson going \"Ha ha!\".\n\nList of characters with biographies[edit]\n\nComic Book Guy\n\nPage features a clickable mouse which upon being clicked shows a clip of a nude woman being slowly loaded, and a popup ad for Homer's Internet King business appearing. A reference to the same clip in \"Das Bus\".\n\nCarl Carlson\n\nPage features a clickable green splotch of goo that bubbles when clicked and a radioactive rod which falls through the paper when clicked.\n\nCharles Montgomery Burns\n\nPage has a knees-to-head sized portrait of Burns which, when clicked, causes the three dots on his head to fall off one at a time. Burns then bends over and reaches out of the portrait to pick them up, putting them back on his head.\n\nSelma Bouvier\n\nPage has Jub-Jub, Selma's pet iguana sitting on it. When clicked the iguana pokes out its tongue and Selma's voice says \"Jub-Jub\" in the background.\n\nPatty Bouvier\n\nPage features Homer's failed chauffeur's driving test. Clicking a place on the test will cause Patty's hand to stamp a \"FAILED\" stamp onto it. Clicking on different places will have the stamp stamped onto a different place.\n\nJulius Hibbert\n\nThe page features 3 interactive objects: a light reflecting mirror band that doctors wear on their heads, which when clicked, plays Hibbert's catchphrase laugh; a stethoscope that plays the sound of a beating heart when clicked. A syringe with green fluid, when clicked causes the syringe to squirt out all its fluid, causing Dr. Hibbert to complain that the viewer is wasting thousands of dollars' worth of Interferon, as heard in \"Little Big Mom\".\n\nBarney Gumble\n\nWhen the page is opened there is a full coffee cup, and an empty beer cup. Clicking on the coffee cup will cause it to empty and fill the beer cup. When clicking on the beer cup, it empties and the coffee cup fills up.\n\nTodd Flanders\n\nClicking on the golf-ball on the page causes it to pop out of its hole, a golf club then knocks it back into its whole, making Rodd and Todd to shout \"Yay\".\n\nRod Flanders\n\nClicking on Billy Graham's Bible Blaster opens up the actual game as seen in \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\".\n\nNed Flanders\n\nA video camera can play a short section from his dating video (as in \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\") and some more pictures when clicked.\n\nKrusty\n\nThere are 2 interactive pieces of Krusty the Clown merchandise, each of which, when clicked, attempts to function then breaks down.\n\nEdna Krabappel\n\nPage features a fold out heart, clicking on it once opens up the left, showing Edna on the left and Principal Skinner in the middle, clicking on it again shows Agnes Skinner on the right, pulling on Principal Skinner's ear.\n\nItchy\n\nPage has a target board and a picture of Scratchy's face attached.

Clicking on a donut squishes it, squirting out pink liquid.\n\nLisa Simpson\n\nClicking on a cover for Sax on the Beach shows a saxophone on the page, which has flashing buttons to teach the opening theme music for The Simpsons (saxophone buttons and sounds do not match those of a saxophone in reality).\n\nMaggie Simpson\n\nClicking on the edges of the page makes Maggie's pacifier appear and plays Maggie's catchphrase: the \"suck\" sound.\n\nAbe Simpson\n\nClicking on his pair of fake teeth make them shut then open again. Clicking on a bag with two pennies inside plays a different Abe Simpson quote every time.\n\nBart Simpson\n\nClicking on his slingshot opens up a target-shooting minigame.\n\nSanta's Little Helper\n\nClicking on a new shoe shows it getting ripped up, a reference to Santa's Little Helper's constant destruction of items and general behavioral problems as first explored in \"Bart's Dog Gets an \"F\"\".\n\nScratchy\n\nClicking on a remote plays an Itchy and Scratchy episode based on an existing Itchy and Scratchy episode.\n\nWhile browsing the character bios, sometimes a red light starts flashing while disco music plays, Disco Stu then walks past dancing.\n\nSo you think you know The Simpsons? Quiz[edit]\n\nThere was a quiz on the website which asked a set of multi-choice questions (3 choices) and had a picture of Comic Book Guy.\n\nDesigns[edit]\n\nThe site has had many various changes to its design throughout its time online.
