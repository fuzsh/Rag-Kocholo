        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAbout 19 years ago, \"The Simpsons\" predicted that 20th Century Fox would be owned by Disney, and on Thursday Disney announced it would be purchasing it (and other assets) in a deal estimated at $52.4 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deal also means that \"The Simpsons\" will be owned by Disney. That should make your head spin a little.\n\nBut this isn't the only time that \"The Simpsons\" has managed to wow us with its ability to predict the future.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n16. Disney buys 20th Century Fox - Season 10, Episode 5\n\nIn the episode \"When You Dish Upon a Star\" that originally aired in 1998, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer produce a script Homer pitches. The script is being produced at 20th Century Fox, and a sign in front of the studio's headquarters reveals that it is “a division of Walt Disney Co.”\n\nOn December 14, 2017 Disney purchased 21st Century Fox for an estimated $52.4 billion, acquiring Fox's film studio (20th Century Fox), in addition to a bulk of its television production assets. The media conglomerate will also have access to popular entertainment properties like \"X-Men,\" \"Avatar,\" and \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. Nobel Prize Winner - Season 22, Episode 1\n\nMIT professor Bengt Holmström won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2016, 6 years after he was bet on to win the Nobel Prize on \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nHolmström's name appears on a betting scorecard when Martin, Lisa, Database, and Milhouse bet on Nobel Prize winners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. Smart watches - Season 6, Episode 19\n\n\"The Simpsons\" introduced the idea of a watch you could use as a phone in an episode aired in 1995, nearly 20 years before the Apple Watch was released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n13. Lady Gaga's Super Bowl halftime show - Season 23, Episode 22\n\nIn 2012, Lady Gaga performed for the town of Springfield hanging in midair. Five years later, she flew off the Houston NRG Stadium roof in real life to perform her Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Autocorrect - Season 6, Episode 8\n\nSchool bullies Kearny and Dolph take a memo to \"beat up Martin\" on a Newton device in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" that aired in 1994. The memo gets quickly translated to \"eat up Martha\" - an early foreshadowing of autocorrect frustrations.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" were lampooning Apple's underwhelming Newton — the iPhone's ancient ancestor — that had just been released, and included shoddy handwriting recognition, according to Fast Company.\n\nNitin Ganatra, former director of engineering iOS applications at Apple, told Fast Company that this particular moment on \"The Simpsons\" served as inspiration to get the iPhone keyboard right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. Faulty voting machines — Season 20, Episode 4\n\nIn 2008, \"The Simpsons\" showed Homer trying to vote for Barack Obama in the US general election, but a faulty machine changed his vote.\n\nFour years later, a voting machine in Pennsylvania had to be removed after it kept changing people's votes for Barack Obama to ones for his Republican rival Mitt Romney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The invention of the tomacco plant — Season 11, Episode 5\n\nIn 1999, Homer uses nuclear energy to create a hybrid of tomato and tobacco plants: the \"tomacco.\"\n\nThis inspired US \"Simpsons\" fan Rob Baur to create his own plant. In 2003, Baur grafted together a tobacco root and a tomato stem to make \"tomacco.\" Writers for \"The Simpsons\" were so impressed that they invited Baur and his family to their offices and ate the tomacco fruit themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Ebola outbreak — Season 9, Episode 3\n\nSome people maintain that \"The Simpsons\" predicted the 2014 outbreak of Ebola 17 years before it happened. In a scene from the episode \"Lisa's Sax,\" Marge suggests a sick Bart read a book titled \"Curious George and the Ebola Virus.\" The virus wasn't particularly widespread in the 1990s, but years later it was the top of the news agenda.\n\nEbola was first discovered in 1976, and though this latest outbreak has been the worst yet, it killed 254 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995 and 224 in Uganda in 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. The discovery of the Higgs boson equation — Season 8, Episode 1\n\nIn a 1998 episode called \"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace,\" Homer Simpson becomes an inventor and is shown in front of a complicated equation on a blackboard.\n\nAccording to Simon Singh, the author of \"The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets,\" the equation predicts the mass of the Higgs boson particle. It was first predicted in 1964 by Professor Peter Higgs and five other physicists, but it wasn't until 2013 that scientists discovered proof of the Higgs boson in a £10.4 billion ($13 billion) experiment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. The invention of The Shard — Season 6, Episode 19\n\nThe \"Lisa's Wedding\" episode from 1995 came with a lot of unexpected predictions. During Lisa's trip to London, we see a skyscraper behind Tower Bridge that looks eerily similar to The Shard and that is even in the right location. Construction on the building started in 2009, 14 years later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Robotic librarians — Season 6, Episode 19\n\nIn \"Lisa's Wedding,\" we discover that librarians have been replaced with robots in the \"Simpsons\" universe.\n\nMore than 20 years later, robotics students from the University of Aberystwyth built a prototype for a walking library robot, while scientists in Singapore have begin testing their own robot librarians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Horsemeat scandal — Season 5, Episode 19\n\nIn 1994, Lunchlady Doris used \"assorted horse parts\" to make lunch for students at Springfield Elementary.\n\nNine years later, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland found horse DNA in over one-third of beefburger samples from supermarkets and ready meals, and pig in 85% of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Siegfried and Roy tiger attack — Season 5, Episode 10\n\nSimpsons - Anastasia the tiger from Sebastian Villafana on Vimeo.\n\nThe Simpsons parodied entertainers Siegfried & Roy in a 1993 episode called \"$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalised Gambling).\" During the episode, the magicians are viciously mauled by a trained white tiger while performing in a casino.\n\nIn 2003, Roy Horn of Siegfried and Roy was attacked during a live performance by Montecore, one of their white tigers. Roy lived but sustained severe injuries in the attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Letter from The Beatles — Season 2, Episode 18\n\nIn 1991, an episode of \"The Simpsons\" saw The Beatles' Ringo Star diligently answering fan mail that had been written decades ago.\n\nIn September 2013, two Beatles fans from Essex received a reply from Paul McCartney to a letter and recording they sent to the band 50 years ago. The recording was sent to a London theatre the band was due to play at but was found years later in a car boot sale by a historian.\n\nIn 2013, the BBC's \"The One Show\" reunited the pair with their letter, plus a reply from McCartney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. The censorship of Michelangelo's David — Season 2, Episode 9\n\nAn episode from 1990 titled \"Itchy and Scratchy and Marge\" showed Springfieldians protesting against Michelangelo's statue of David being exhibited in the local museum, calling the artwork obscene for its nudity.\n\nThe satire of censorship came true in July 2016, when Russian campaigners voted on whether to clothe a copy of the Renaissance statue that had been set up in central St Petersburg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Three-eyed fish — Season 2, Episode 4\n\nIn this episode from 1990, Bart catches a three-eyed fish named Blinky in the river by the power plant, which makes local headlines.\n\nMore than a decade later, a three-eyed fish was discovered in a reservoir in Argentina. Strangely enough, the reservoir itself was fed by water from a nuclear power plant.\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
