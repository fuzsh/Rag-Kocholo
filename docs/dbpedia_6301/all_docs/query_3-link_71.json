        "text": "Set in a gorgeous Grade II-listed Georgian villa, the decor is bright and modern but respects the building’s elegance and heritage.\n\nThe food, too, respects classical tradition, but is a contemporary take on British cuisine - combining influences from around the world in dishes based on fabulous impeccably sourced seasonal ingredients.\n\nSimpson’s attentive, friendly service ensures that diners enjoy a relaxed experience as they savour exquisite food and drink.\n\nThree decades of culinary excellence have resulted in numerous accolades and the establishment of Simpsons as a favourite dining destination for directing foodies.\n\nSimpsons has held a Michelin star since 1999 and proudly holds a host of other awards recognised in the industry as benchmarks of quality.\n\nIn the same year that the restaurant was honoured with a Michelin star, chef-patron Andreas Antona was named Chefs’ Chef of the Year by the Craft Guild of Chefs and his long-time colleague Luke Tipping won the first ever Midlands Chef of the Year award.\n\nAndreas was honoured with a doctorate by University College Birmingham in 2013 in recognition of his dedication and contribution to the hospitality industry.\n\nSimpsons chef-patron went on to be named International Chef of the Year at La Gastronomie et des Vins in 2014.\n\nThe Simpsons story began in 1993 when Andreas Antona realised his dream by opening his own restaurant in the centre of the historic town of Kenilworth.\n\nJust two years later, the restaurant received a Michelin Bib Gourmand and, within four years, had been awarded a Michelin star.\n\nThe accolades accumulated and its reputation grew and, in 2004 Andreas moved Simpsons to Birmingham, taking over a fantastic Georgian building in Edgbaston.\n\nHere the restaurant went from strength to strength - its kitchen producing culinary stars who themselves went on to great things.\n\nSimpsons revolutionised Birmingham’s dining scene and became a byword for quality, luxury and relaxation.\n\nIts reputation grew overseas, too, and, in 2014, Simpsons was invited to cook at the prestigious Rheingau food and drinks festival.\n\nThe restaurant was transformed in 2015 with a massive, but sensitive, refurbishment.\n\nIts cookery school was refurbished in 2017 with the opening of the innovative Eureka Kitchen.\n\nA year later, Simpsons dining room was packed with friends and leading industry figures as Andreas and the team celebrated its 25th anniversary.\n\nOver recent years Simpsons has collaborated with many of Britain’s leading chefs and restaurants"
