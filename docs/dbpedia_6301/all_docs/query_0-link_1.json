        "text": "20th Century Studios, Inc., (stylized as 20th Century Studios and formerly Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation or 20th Century Fox), is an American film studio that produced and distributed The Simpsons Movie.\n\nIt, along with the FOX Network, has been referenced many times in the show. The Simpsons has taken many swipes at their home network. FOX was part of the Motion Picture Association. In 2013, following the split of News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, the byline \"A News Corporation Company\" was removed.\n\nIt is a subsidiary company of The Walt Disney Company, under The Walt Disney Studios division. The Fox Studios lot is currently owned by Rupert Murdoch and Fox Corporation. This studio, along with 21st Century Fox-related assets (including 20th Century Animation, Blue Sky Studios, Searchlight Pictures, and FX Networks) are now owned by Disney.\n\nOn January 17, 2020, Variety reported that The Walt Disney Company was rebranding some of its acquisitions from the now-defunct 21st Century Fox to avoid confusion with the part of Fox that remains an independent company. Along with the change in names to 20th Century Fox, FOX Searchlight Pictures has been renamed without \"FOX\" in front of it and 20th Century Fox Animation was renamed 20th Century Animation.[1][2] The television divisions were not renamed.\n\nHistory[]\n\n20th Century Fox was founded on May 31, 1935 as the result of the merger of Fox Film Corporation, founded by William Fox in 1915, and Twentieth Century Pictures, founded in 1933 by Darryl F. Zanuck, Joseph Schenck, Raymond Griffith and William Goetz.\n\nAfter being owned by the News Corporation from 1984 to 2013, the studio was bought by The Walt Disney Company for $71.3 billion in 2018,[3][4] a deal that was completed on March 20, 2019.\n\n20th Century Studios was a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA) before its acquisition by The Walt Disney Company.\n\nCitations[]\n\nEpisode – \"Kamp Krusty\" Not exactly implied, but:\n\nBart: I want the whole world to know this was a really crappy camp.
