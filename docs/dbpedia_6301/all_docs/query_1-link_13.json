        "text": "This article is about the film studio founded in 1935. For the companies before the merger, see Fox Film and Twentieth Century Pictures.\n\n\"20th Century Fox\" redirects here. For other uses, see 20th Century Fox (disambiguation).\n\n20th Century Studios, Inc. is an American film studio owned by the Walt Disney Studios, a division of Disney Entertainment, in turn a division of The Walt Disney Company.[6] It is headquartered at the Fox Studio Lot in the Century City area of Los Angeles, leased from Fox Corporation.[7] Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributes and markets the films produced by 20th Century Studios in theatrical markets.[8][9]\n\nQuick Facts Trade name, Formerly ...\n\nClose\n\nFor over 80 years, 20th Century was one of the major American film studios. It was formed in 1935 as Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation[lower-alpha 1] by the merger of Fox Film and Twentieth Century Pictures, and one of the original \"Big Five\" among eight majors of Hollywood's Golden Age. In 1985, the studio removed the hyphen in the name (becoming Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation)[lower-alpha 2] after being acquired by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which was renamed 21st Century Fox in 2013 after it spun off its publishing assets. Disney purchased most of 21st Century Fox's assets, which included 20th Century Fox, on March 20, 2019.[10] The studio adopted its current name as a trade name on January 17, 2020, in order to avoid confusion with Fox Corporation, and subsequently started to use it for the copyright of 20th Century and Searchlight Pictures productions on December 4.[11]"
