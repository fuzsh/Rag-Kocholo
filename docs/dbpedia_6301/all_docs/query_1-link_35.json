        "text": "History\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Studio Employees Federal Credit Union began serving employees of the Los Angeles studio in 1933.\n\nThe credit union was formally chartered on August 6, 1965 serving employees of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and Twentieth Century Fox Television, Inc. and their families.\n\nOn May 14, 1975, the credit union changed its name to Twentieth Century Fox Federal Credit Union.\n\nIn 1985, the studio was acquired by News Corporation and over the next several decades, remained one of the major studios in Hollywood and grew to become one of the largest media companies in the United States under 21st Century Fox. As the studio grew, so did the credit union, adding employees of News Corporation to its field of membership in 1999.\n\n21st Century Fox, a 2013 spin-off of News Corporation, and the Walt Disney Company began negotiations in 2017 on a deal involving Disney acquiring the majority of 21st Century Foxâ€™s assets. On March 20, 2019, the merger completed.\n\nFollowing the merger, the credit union decided to continue its relationship with the new Fox that emerged from the acquisition. As a result, on December 10, 2019, the credit union changed its name to Fox Federal Credit union.\n\nFox Federal Credit Union has safely and soundly served its membership for over 85 years and has grown to become a full-service financial institution whose mission is to assist members in managing their financial resources by providing competitive, affordable financial products and services.\n\nPhilosophy\n\nFox Federal Credit Union upholds its fundamental commitment to serving its members and is committed to the highest standards of responsibility and conduct and subscribes to the philosophy that members come first.\n\nAbout Credit Unions\n\nA credit union is a member-owned financial cooperative between people who share a common bond. Credit unions are usually able to offer higher dividends on savings and lower rates on loans and other services than other financial institutions. As a cooperative, members are owners and expect to receive high quality financial services to meet all their needs. The Board of Directors is nominated from and elected by its membership and serve on a voluntary, non-compensated basis."
