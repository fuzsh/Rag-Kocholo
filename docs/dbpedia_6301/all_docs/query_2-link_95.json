        "text": "Guns N’ Roses star Duff McKagan has spoken out after a writer from the Simpsons slammed speculation that a huge aspect of the series was named after him.\n\nHomer Simpson and the regulars at Moe’s Tavern, which recently got rid of its cigarette machine after 33 years, are usually sipping on a Duff beer, the go-to beverage of Springfield.\n\nThe rocker recently made headlines when he floated a theory that his name is the inspiration behind the brand of booze – something that Jay Kogen dispelled, insisting that those in the writer’s room had no clue who McKagan actually was at the time.\n\nThe Sweet Child O’ Mine musician has since vowed that he’s not that fussed by the denial, but suggested that fans should ‘do the maths’ over the timeline.\n\n‘I think it’s hilarious that they’re going nuts on this thing,’ he told TMZ. ‘I never treated it as a big deal, “How doth thou protest?”\n\n‘This has been going on for 35 years.’\n\n‘Do the math,’ he said when questioned about the timeline of Guns N’ Roses’ decades-long popularity – as the group were formed before the cartoon hit our screens.\n\n‘It’s been a story going on for 35 years, I don’t care about. It doesn’t matter at all.\n\n‘I’m not going to sue you.’\n\n‘They blew up, good for them,’ he added. ‘I don’t care at all.’\n\nIn his 2011 autobiography It’s So Easy and Other Lies, McKagan previously revealed a ‘production company working on a new animated series’ requested to use the name ‘Duff’ for a brand of beer to be used in the show, paying homage to his reputation as a ‘big drinker’.\n\nHaving absolutely no idea quite how big said animated series would become, he gave the green light without asking for a penny.\n\n‘Here’s the deal,’ the Welcome to The Jungle star had previously said. ‘So I was Duff, the King of Beers. But this is 1988, 1989 and our management, I remember they called me and said some arthouse-like cartoon wants to use your name as the beer, like a college arthouse cartoon.\n\n‘There weren’t any adult cartoons at this point.\n\n‘I didn’t know about branding or anything like that, but that show took off. And then they started selling merch and stuff.\n\n‘I never went after him [creator Matt Groening], but I’m like, “Hey, mother**kers,’ you know?”’\n\n‘I think it’s very probably business savvy of them to say that’s not true,’ he continued.\n\n‘But if you just do your own math behind it, look at when they started off with the King of Beers, and I had my King of Beers belt I wore all the time.’\n\nMcKagan stressed again though that he still wasn’t going to ask them for money.\n\nHowever, several The Simpsons writers have debunked the claims and – after he doubled down in an interview with Stereogum – producer Kogen isn’t having it.\n\nThe writer told TMZ that Duff beer wasn’t named after the rocker, saying: ‘We named it Duff because it’s a synonym for butt, tushy, booty, and so on.’\n\nHe also added that the Simpsons writers didn’t know of McKagan at the time, continuing: ‘It’s very weird this Duff McKagan guy wants to claim credit for Duff Beer… He had zero to do with it.’\n\nThe Simpsons fans have recently been shocked to discover the cartoon’s confirmed link to a music giant as Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson is actually related to Espresso songstress Sabrina Carpenter.\n\nThe Simpsons is available to stream on Disney Plus in the UK.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : WWE fans devastated as star quits after 8 years to focus on ‘next chapter’\n\nMORE : WWE fans scared as ‘unhinged’ star with criminal record makes ‘terrifying’ debut"
