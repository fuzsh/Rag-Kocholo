        "text": "The Walt Disney Company (Disney for short) is an American multimedia conglomerate mostly known for their film studio, iconic cartoons such as Mickey Mouse and its film franchises from Disney's brands. Even though it was a competitor to 21st Century Fox until its acquisition, it is often parodied, homaged and referenced on The Simpsons.\n\nAcquisition of 21st Century Fox[]\n\nOn December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced that it would acquire copyrights and distribution rights to the majority of 21st Century Fox's assets. This would include 20th Century Fox, National Geographic, FX Networks, X-Men, Star Wars, Futurama, Family Guy, and of course, The Simpsons. 20th Century Fox Television would still produce the shows as a unit of Disney Television Studios. The deal did not include the FOX network, the Fox News Channel and its Sports channels. The deal was completed on March 20, 2019.\n\nOn April 11, 2019, it was confirmed that The Simpsons would be added to the upcoming Disney+ streaming service, which launched in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands on November 12, 2019, with all the episodes, (with the exception of \"Stark Raving Dad\" due to it being pulled from rotation after headlines were made about the Michael Jackson scandal)[1][2], which effectively replaced FX's \"Simpsons World\" streaming service.[3] A Simpsons short titled \"Welcome to the Family, The Simpsons!\" was released by the company on April 11, 2019, with the Simpson family not only promoting Disney+, but also lampooning Disney's corporate synergy and media consolidation, indicating that, much like the show's previous corporate parent Fox before it, Disney will continue to be a target of the show's satirical humor. Another short was released by the company in November 2019, with the Simpson family dressed as characters representing the library presented on Disney+ (a reluctant Bart Simpson as Mickey Mouse (representing Disney), Marge Simpson as Bo Peep (representing Pixar), Homer Simpson as Tony Stark/Iron Man (representing Marvel), Maggie Simpson as The Child (representing Star Wars) and Lisa Simpson as an iceberg (representing National Geographic). All 30 seasons of the series debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019, but is instead presented in a non-HD format. Instead of presenting them in their original aspect ratio, they were either cropped to fit widescreen televisions or were stretched out in the same manner. FXX's now-defunct \"Simpsons World\" streaming service was similarly criticized when it launched. In response, Disney stated they would make the ability to watch the episodes of the first 19 seasons and some from season 20 in either the 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio in early 2020.\n\nOn May 28, 2020, Disney+ officially made episodes of The Simpsons from episodes of season 1 to some episodes of season 20 available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\nReferences in The Simpsons[]\n\nSimpsoncalifragilisticexpialaD'oh-cious[]\n\nThe character Shary Bobbins is an obvious spoof of Mary Poppins, and the episode features songs parodying ones from Mary Poppins. The episode title is also a reference to Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, a song from the film.\n\n\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\"[]\n\nThe episode title and plot is a parody of Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians. The scene where Santa's Little Helper and his girlfriend are eating pasta is a spoof of Lady and the Tramp, and Mr. Burns's song See My Vest is a parody of the song Be Our Guest from Beauty and the Beast.\n\n\"Homer Badman\"[]\n\nHomer imagines living underwater in a sequence parodying the song \"Under the Sea\" in Disney's The Little Mermaid.\n\n\"Lisa the Beauty Queen\"[]\n\nPrincipal Skinner uses the slogan \"The happiest place on Earth\" for his school's carnival, but the Blue-Haired Lawyer tells him that it is a registered Disneyland copyright.\n\n\"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\"[]\n\nOne of the homeless men recalls owning Mickey Mouse Massage Parlors, which Disney shut down due to copyright infringement.\n\n\"Treehouse of Horror II\"[]\n\nIn the opening, gravestones for Bambi's Mom (from the Disney film Bambi) and Walt Disney can be seen.\n\n\"Selma's Choice\"[]\n\nThe Little Land of Duff, a ride at Duff Gardens, features animatron puppets which represent all parts of the world and sing the \"Duff Beer for me, Duff Beer for you\" song. The ride is a reference to the It's a Small World ride at Disneyland.\n\nDuff Gardens has a group of costumed mascots (called The Seven Duffs) who are an obvious spoof of the Seven Dwarfs from Snow White.

The title is even a parody of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\".\n\n\"Make Room for Lisa\"[]\n\nLisa cites The Little Mermaid as her favorite movie before Homer taped it over.\n\n\"Mom and Pop Art\"[]\n\nDisney merchandise is among the objects Homer uses to make unusual art.\n\n\"D'oh-in' in the Wind\"[]\n\nWhen Barney Gumble drinks hallucinogenic vegetable juice, he sees a three-eyed monster, which frightens him.

It similarly revolves around African animals assembling. When the jeep is traveling through the Savannah, Pride Rock can be seen in the background.\n\n\"The Great Louse Detective\"[]\n\nThe Simpsons agree that a tour of prison is preferable to Disney's California Adventure.

When Homer is imagining all the bears attacking him the \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" parodies it.\n\n\"Special Edna\"[]\n\nThe plot of the episode takes place at EFCOT Center, a parody of Epcot.

Dan Castellaneta, in addition, also voiced the Genie in The Return of Jafar, the animated series and the Kingdom Hearts series.\n\n\"The Burns and the Bees\"[]\n\nLisa tells Homer that without bees there will be no honey. Homer then imagines what the future would be like without honey. In Homer's imagined version of the future, it is a wastleland. Then, WALL-E shows up with the last bottle of honey, which Homer then drinks, and WALL-E shoves Homer into him and makes him into a cube. This is a reference to Disney•PIXAR's 2008 film, WALL-E.\n\n\"Gone Maggie Gone\"[]\n\nLisa tells Homer to come into the kitchen where many rats are scurrying. One rat climbs onto Homer's head and begins pulling his hair, which controls Homer's movements. Homer says, \"Ah, it's just like that movie I taped in the theaters.\" The rat begins pulling on his hair and helps Homer make a soup.

The whole sequence is a reference to Disney•PIXAR's 2007 film Ratatouille.\n\n\"The Wandering Juvie\"[]\n\nGina tells Bart that she got arrested for pushing Snow White off the Parapet at Disneyland, Showing him a newspaper with the news tittle \"It's a fall world\".\n\n\"Treehouse of Horror XI\"[]\n\nWhen the witch casts a spell to Homer makes him grow donkey ears, he has the same reaction as Pinocchio when he discovers that he too becomes a donkey.\n\n\"Waverly Hills 9-0-2-1-D'oh\"[]\n\nHomer and Marge put a Winnie the Pooh doll and a picture of Tigger in the apartment to make the Inspector believe that Lisa and Bart live there.\n\n\"Four Great Women and a Manicure\"[]\n\nLisa tells Marge a story parodying Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, with herself in the title role, and staring Homer and friends as the Dwarfs.\n\n\"Coming to Homerica\"[]\n\nWhen Lenny and Carl are floating in the sky by balloons, Mr. Fredricksen's house can be seen floating across the sky.

The opening credit's card also reads \"Disney welcomes The Simpsons\". The Gracie Films logo at the end of the short replaces one of the patrons in the audience with Mickey Mouse.
