        "text": "Rupert Murdoch has proven to be a transformative and prescient entrepreneur, business leader, visionary and dealmaker across every medium of the media industry throughout his nearly 70 year career. Mr. Murdoch currently serves as Chairman Emeritus of both Fox Corporation and News Corp., two of the most recognized and influential media companies in the world. Mr. Murdoch previously served as Chair of Fox Corporation from March 2019 to November 2023 and Executive Chair of News Corp. from 2013 to 2023. Mr. Murdoch was Executive Chairman of 21st Century Fox, one of the leading portfolios of cable, broadcast, film, pay TV and satellite assets, from 2015 to the closing of the merger of 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company in March 2019. Mr. Murdoch served as CEO of 21st Century Fox from its inception as News Corporation in 1979 until 2015 and as its Chairman from 1991 to 2015.\n\nRupert Murdoch’s passion for the news media business was sparked by the legacy of his father, Sir Keith Murdoch, chairman of The Herald and Weekly Times and head of News Limited, an Australian-based public corporation.\n\nHe inherited his father’s interests in the Adelaide newspaper The News in 1952, becoming publisher and a member of the board of News Limited the following year. In 1954, Mr. Murdoch took control of News Limited and embarked on a path that would redefine the media landscape. His entrepreneurial instinct led Mr. Murdoch to expand his interests into the growing medium of television. His company founded the Southern Television Corporation and pushed its newly licensed Channel 9 to be first to air in 1959 in South Australia.\n\nGlobal expansion under his leadership began as News Limited bought the Sydney-based Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror in 1960, which was followed by the launch of The Australian, Australia’s first national newspaper, in 1964. The Company gained control of the U.K.’s News of the World and The Sun in 1969 and subsequently acquired several publications in the U.S. including the New York Post, New York Magazine and The Village Voice.\n\nIn 1980, News Corporation was established as a holding company to consolidate international operations of its growing roster of newspapers, magazines and television assets. The Company’s growth continued with the purchase of The Times (London) and The Sunday Times in 1981 and in 1983 Murdoch’s News International became the majority owner of Satellite Television, the first satellite-to-cable channel in Europe. News Corp also made its foray into book publishing with an investment in Collins in 1981 and then Harper & Row in 1987, which were then merged in 1990 to create HarperCollins.\n\nIn 1985, Mr. Murdoch significantly expanded his interests in the film and television industry when he took ownership of Twentieth Century Fox as well as a number of regional television stations in some of the top U.S. markets.\n\nThe following year, the FOX Television Stations group was created, comprised of 25 stations across the U.S. that became the foundation for the launch of FOX Broadcasting Company in 1986. This historical development would not only reshape network television, but pave the way for the groundbreaking NFL broadcasting rights deal that served as the launch pad for FOX Sports, which just kicked off its 30th season. By 1996, the FOX network was the top-ranked television group in the country, a position it held for a record eight consecutive years, thanks to such defining programming as “In Living Color,” “Married with Children,” “The X-Files,” and “The Simpsons” which is now in its 35th season on the network.\n\nFOX News Channel – now the undisputed leader in 24-hour news service for over twenty years – made its debut in October 1996. FOX also successfully established globally renowned cable networks, including FOX Sports Network, FX and the National Geographic Channels.\n\nMurdoch launched Sky Television in the United Kingdom in 1988 and expanded the offering with the launch of Sky News in 1989, as the first 24-hour news television channel in Britain. In 1992, Sky acquired the rights to the Premier League, in an upstart deal that put Sky Sports in a league of their own.\n\nNews Corporation simultaneously grew its cable business outside of the U.S. with the establishment of Foxtel in Australia in 1995 and cable news channel Sky News Australia in 1996.\n\nIn 2007, Mr. Murdoch led News Corporation’s acquisition of Dow Jones, including The Wall Street Journal in a landmark deal.\n\nMr. Murdoch oversaw the continued expansion and development of the Company and in June 2013, established 21st Century Fox as a stand-alone international media and entertainment company and News Corp as a global company comprised of distinguished brands across a range of media, including news and information services and book publishing. The acquisition of Move, Inc., operator of Realtor.com®, in 2014, leveraged News Corp’s existing majority investment of REA Group Limited’s real estate and digital expertise.\n\nIn 2019, led by Mr. Murdoch, Fox Corporation was launched as a standalone, publicly traded company following the separation of 21st Century Fox in a deal that yet again redefined the U.S. media landscape. As Fox Corporation, the company produces and distributes content through some of the world’s leading and most valued brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment, FOX Television Stations and Tubi Media Group.\n\nIn recognition of his storied career, Mr. Murdoch has been awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia (A.C.) for services to the media and to newspaper publishing in particular. In 2014, he was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame. He and his family have been closely involved with, and made generous contributions to various educational, cultural, and medical charitable organizations throughout the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Israel.\n\n1921\n\nSir Keith Murdoch (1885–1952) becomes chief editor of Melbourne’s Herald newspaper. Over time, he expands the Herald Group’s business holdings to include the News Limited company of Australian newspapers.\n\n1931\n\nElisabeth (née Greene, 1909-2012) welcomed their second of four children, Keith Rupert Murdoch, on March 11, 1931, in Melbourne, Australia. Rupert is pictured with his mother, Dame Elisabeth.\n\n1952\n\nAt Keith Murdoch’s passing in 1952, Rupert Murdoch inherits his father’s interests in the Adelaide newspaper The News. The following year, he becomes publisher and joins the board of News Limited.\n\n1954\n\nRupert Murdoch takes control of News Limited, an Australian-based public corporation whose only key asset at the time was a majority interest in the number-two daily newspaper in Adelaide, South Australia.\n\n1959\n\nNews Limited founded Southern Television Corporation. Under Rupert Murdoch’s urging, its newly licensed Channel 9 Adelaide became the first to air in South Australia.\n\n1960\n\nGrowth and expansion continued under Rupert Murdoch’s guidance as News Limited bought the Sydney-based Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror in 1960.\n\n1964\n\nNews Limited launches The Australian, Australia’s first national newspaper. Page one notifies readers, “In these pages you will find the impartial information and the independent thinking that are essential to the further advance of our county.” The Australian will celebrate its 60th anniversary in 2024.\n\n1969\n\nNews Limited expands into the United Kingdom with the purchase of News of the World and The Sun newspaper.\n\n1972\n\nMurdoch expands his Australian media holdings with the acquisition of The Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph (Sydney).\n\n1973\n\nMurdoch makes his foray into the U.S. newspaper business with the purchase of the San Antonio Express and the San Antonio News, which were later merged. Pictured with former Express-News publisher Charles O. Kilpatrick.\n\n1974\n\nBringing his patented tabloid news model to the U.S., Murdoch launched The Star.\n\n1976\n\nMurdoch meets with Dorothy Schiff, former owner of the New York Post. News Corp., purchased the New York Post in 1976, sold the newspaper in 1988, and repurchased it in 1993.\n\n1977\n\nWith the acquisition of New York Magazine and The Village Voice, Murdoch’s media empire grows.\n\n1980\n\nNews Corporation is established as a holding company evolving from its roots as News Limited.\n\n1981\n\nAgain adding to his stable of newspapers in the U.K., Murdoch purchases The Times (London) and The Sunday Times. He also extends his ambitions into book publishing by acquiring a stake in Collins Publishing.\n\n1984\n\nMurdoch earns recognition as Companion of the Order of Australia (A.C.) for service to the media, particularly the newspaper publishing industry.\n\n1985\n\nNews Corporation purchases Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. The studio subsequently produced many award-winning films, including the two then-top-grossing films of all time: Avatar and Titanic.\n\n1985\n\nNews Corporation purchases five television stations from Metromedia. This holding represents the first stations that would become FOX Television Stations.\n\n1986\n\nThe FOX Network debuts. From the beginning, the network was all about upending norms and taking risks – premiering with The Joan Rivers Show. Later, FOX would introduce fans to The Simpsons; In Living Color; COPS; Beverly Hills, 90210; The X-Files and more. Pictured: Rupert Murdoch cameo in 2010\n\n1986\n\nMurdoch introduced new state-of-the-art technology in his printing plants that helped to revolutionize the newspaper industry in the U.K.\n\n1989\n\nSky launches as the UK’s first satellite TV service with 4 free to air channels including Sky News, Europe’s first 24-hour News channel.\n\n1990\n\nIn 1987 News Corp acquired publisher Harper & Row and became the sole owner of Collins in 1989. In 1990, News Corp merged the two publishers to create what is today known as HarperCollins.\n\n1992\n\nMurdoch leads the winning bid to acquire the broadcast rights to Premier League football, which was then leveraged to bolster the new Sky Sports network.\n\n1993\n\nIn a stunning move, FOX Broadcasting Company lands rights to the NFL’s NFC television package for four years beginning in 1994.\n\n1994\n\nFOX Sports launches in the U.S. In 1995 FOX also makes an agreement with Major League Baseball, with games premiering in 1996.\n\n1996\n\nThe FOX News Channel launches in the U.S. and becomes the undisputed leader in 24-hour news service in 2000.\n\n1996\n\nSky News launches as Australia’s 24/7 News Channel.\n\n1998\n\nMurdoch locks down the rights to the National Rugby League to air on FOX Sports Australia.\n\n2001\n\nNews Ltd. enters Australia’s digital real estate market with investment in REA Group.\n\n2003\n\nNews Corporation acquires a controlling interest in the satellite television company DirecTV.\n\n2007\n\nFOX Business Network launches as a financial news channel delivering real-time information across all platforms that impact both Main Street and Wall Street. It currently ranks among the top business channels on television. The network is available in nearly 80 million homes in all markets across the United States.\n\n2007\n\nNews Corp completes the purchase and integration of Dow Jones, including the Wall Street Journal, one of the most iconic and trusted newspapers in the U.S. for world news, business news, politics, arts, culture, lifestyle, sports, and health.\n\n2013\n\nNews Corporation splits into two separate companies. News Corp retains a primary focus in publishing with the Wall Street Journal, The New York Post, The Australian and more, in addition to its international broadcast and digital assets. The U.S. media side of the business launched as 21st Century Fox and included 20th Century Fox, the FOX Network, FOX News, FOX Sports, FOX Television Stations, FX and National Geographic Channels.\n\n2014\n\nIn what has proven to be a highly strategic digital investment, News Corp acquired Move, Inc., operator of Realtor.com.\n\n2014\n\nBroadcasting pioneer since the mid-1980s, Murdoch is inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\n2017\n\nRupert Murdoch conceived of and executed the spin of 21st Century Fox to Disney, an historic and defining moment for the Company and the media industry as a whole. The deal was completed in 2019 for $71.3 billion.\n\n2019\n\nFox Corporation, comprised of FOX News, FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment, and the FOX Television Stations, launches as a standalone, publicly traded company.\n\n2020\n\nFox Corporation acquires Tubi and establishes an early lead in the free, ad-supported, direct to consumer streaming space. In 2023 Tubi Media Group is established to leverage the synergies between Tubi, AdRise, Blockchain Creative Labs, Credible and other platform services across FOX.\n\n2021\n\nA FOX News Channel state-of-the-art studio is renamed Studio M to honor the Company founder, Rupert Murdoch, pictured with his son Lachlan Murdoch.\n\n2021\n\nAfter years advocating for compensation from the big tech platforms for use of premium journalism, as of 2021, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp had reached such agreements with Facebook, Google and Apple. The landmark deals have benefited News Corp and its mastheads, as well as journalism and media the world over.\n\n2022\n\nNews Corp. completed the acquisition of the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) and Chemical Markets Analytics (formerly Base Chemicals), further strengthening the burgeoning professional information business at Dow Jones.\n\n2023\n\nThe Murdoch Center is unveiled at the American Australian Association in New York City.
