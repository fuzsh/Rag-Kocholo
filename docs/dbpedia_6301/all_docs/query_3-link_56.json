        "text": "Jessica Simpson has come a long way from her pop music days of singing hit songs like “I Wanna Love You Forever” and sharing her early years of fame in front of reality television cameras on MTV’s Newlyweds. Today, Simpson, 41, is leading one of the most sought-after fashion empires in the world with The Jessica Simpson Collection.\n\nCreated in 2005 by Simpson, The Jessica Simpson Collection has grown into a popular destination over these past 17 years for women and juniors to shop shoes, clothing, accessories, and more. However, in 2015, Simpson made a deal with Sequential Brands Group Inc. with the expectation that their involvement would help expand her line. Instead, Sequential soon found itself in deep financial trouble, directly affecting not only Simpson’s business but also the public image of a company that she had spent years building.\n\nSo in 2019, being no longer a majority shareholder in her own company, Simpson decided to take back her name and fight to regain ownership of The Jessica Simpson Collection.\n\n“It was a journey but I never lost faith in myself,” Simpson shared with me over Zoom last week from inside of her California home. “I never let fear come in, it was not invited! A lot of people around me are like, ‘Are you sure? Are you sure?’ And I was like if you’re not sure, you’re fired because that means you don’t believe in me and that means that you don’t believe in what I can do and my purpose. I know that it’s going to be okay, even if I drained my bank accounts and don’t have a working credit card or whatever it may be. I chose to invest it all in myself for my children's future.”\n\nAfter two years of negotiations, Simpson re-acquired full ownership of The Jessica Simpson Collection with her mom Tina, a victory that has led to even greater public interest in her company, according to Simpson.\n\n“It opened up so many doors and we got the calls, like people just wanting to work with us because all of a sudden, it was like a powerhouse female-led brand. We literally carried the brand through the pandemic and saw our sales go up and that was obviously rare, but people were reading the memoir [Open Book] and timing just works out when you have faith in yourself and you listen to your intuition and your gut and you really know yourself.”\n\nOver recent years, The Jessica Simpson Collection has been credited as a multimillion dollar company, while others before have reported that all of its merchandise has been collectively valued at $1 billion. So, I decided to go right to the source and ask Simpson where her company financially stands today.\n\n“I mean, you’re very close (laughs) but the thing is, we’re in the licensing business, so it’s different than like fast cash. I get a percentage off of the people that make it, so all of our licensees. So, I don’t have a billion dollars, unfortunately, but what I did have I drained in and bought myself back with. Talk to me in a couple years and I can guarantee you I have that money. It’s about manifesting, you know, and just really about believing that you can do anything.”\n\nHaving Simpson back in the driver’s seat with The Jessica Simpson Collection, I wondered what has been her favorite part of continuing to lead her own business and be her own boss.\n\n“My favorite part is not having to answer to anybody. I still answer to my mom, even though I’m her boss (laughs). She’s still my mom. We have a very good working relationship. If I have an idea, she can run it! She can just make it happen and it’s really awesome.”\n\nWith the ongoing sales success of The Jessica Simpson Collection, including the recent debut of the Spring 2022 Collection, I decided to ask Simpson if she had anything to say to the many consumers around the world, people who continue to buy from her brand and support her business.\n\n“Without the consumer, I am nothing. I’m just a mom and like a wife, which is fine, but everybody has given me a reason to stay and everybody has given me a reason to work harder, whether it’s negativity or positive, everything is a driving force and I appreciate people that aren’t even fans but like the clothes, you know? You don’t have to like my voice or you could find me super annoying, that’s fine, but you do like my shoes, I know you do!”\n\nMarried to former NFL player Eric Johnson and a mother of three, Simpson has big plans to see The Jessica Simpson Collection expand into new areas of fashion and lifestyle, inspired by some of the most important people in her world.\n\n“We are going to go into boys and men, as well. That’s definitely something I’ve always wanted to do. I have a son, so that makes it really easy. It’s a lot of dry-fit, things that they will feel comfortable in. For my husband, it’s always about easy, relaxed, and I want to be able to give that to men, as well. We’re going to be going into home interior, that type of stuff, which is exciting. I really want to get into health and wellness.”\n\nSimpson also deals with the seasonal issues that many parents face with their children’s allergy symptoms, which is why she has teamed up with Flonase to get the word out that relief does in fact exist.\n\n“I didn’t know the difference between sickness and allergies because the symptoms are so similar and once my kids started to sneeze and out here in Los Angeles, it’s really bad because of the wildfires and climate change and pollen - name it. We already used Flonase, so it was such a natural thing to be able to talk about because my kids now only want to play outside, so it has changed their life and they’re much happier. A lot less complaining and a lot less snot (laughs).”\n\nSimpson goes on to tell me that she is well-aware of the downfalls to being a public figure, which has led to her being on the receiving end of backlash and criticism, particularly about her body. She says that she sets small goals for herself and when she achieves the big goals, she always seems to reach them sooner than she had expected.\n\n“There’s little things in my life that I can’t let people’s judgments stand in the way of because there is somebody out there that is going through what I’m going through. Yes, I’m going through it publicly but I’ve learned to really accept that and not read those comments, because if I did that, if I let other people’s judgments dictate my next decision, you wouldn’t have what I know I can offer.”\n\nBeyond her business focus with The Jessica Simpson Collection, the fashion mogul has already been dabbling back into her music roots, even putting out a cover to the song “Particles” last year on her YouTube channel, proving that her vocal range today is just as powerful as it has ever been.\n\n“It’s always something that I’m working on. On my Voice Memos [on my phone], I have all my vocal lessons. I tape them, so I make sure to keep that muscle strong because I know that’s my God-given gift and that’s what got me into the doors that I’ve walked through and it’s always going to come back to my voice.”\n\nWhen I asked Simpson if her longtime music fans can expect more from her ahead, she quickly responded with, “Absolutely! I want it just as bad as a fan, trust me. When you don’t have a record label, I didn’t realize when I got dropped from my record deal, that I actually wouldn’t have a record deal again. I didn’t think to go out and shop it because everybody was signing 360 deals and I already had the Collection and there was no way that I was going to give a record label a percentage of that. They didn’t create that for me. I did that because I put my life out there on a reality show. I was brave enough to do that. I just think that no matter what we do in our lives, if we hold strong to our purpose, we’ll always go back to who we really are and for me, that is a singer.”\n\nAs I wrapped up my conversation with Simpson, I wondered how her business mindset and her mindset in general as an evolving person is changing as time goes on.\n\n“I think that we rely on ourselves and not others. I think that we learned that our opinions are what’s right for my name, because so many people can tell you what success is or what will make you successful or how to dress to be approachable and stuff like that. I’ve always been the type that’s honest, open, and relatable because I mean, with pregnancies, like I’ve gained 100 pounds three times and lost it, you know?\n\nI’m a determined spirit and I want to instill that in my children and I want to instill that in people who watch my career. For me, back in the day, I was all about Oh gosh, how many spins is my record going to get? Are they going to get mad at me? I was always afraid that I wasn’t doing it well enough, but that was to their standards. My standards, I’ve realized, are the right ones because I know myself and I know what I can give people and I know what I can give to the world and it inspires me to inspire people. Honestly, it keeps me happy and sane, the more I do.”"
