It was originally founded in 1949 (under the name of TCF Television Productions, Inc.) as other studios were branching out into television production as well. In 1955, the studio officially began television production. 20th Century Fox also owned a stake in the NTA Film Network from 1956 to 1961, and has produced some of the most popular television programs over the years. After Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation acquired TCF on March 6, 1986, TCF/News Corp acquired the television holdings of Metromedia (including its TV stations and television production company), this acquisition helped News Corp launch the Fox Broadcasting Company, and TCFTV became the production arm of FBC. Between 1997 and 1998, the company's library expended by acquiring New World Communications and MTM Enterprises. Today, TCFTV is owned by The Walt Disney Company. TCFTV also produces cable television shows under the Fox 21 Television Studios name.\n\n1st Logo\n\n(1955-1959)\n\n<iframe height=\"157\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/e820aff65972f6e7dc70db0bdb6fffabb5202d77\" width=\"281\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"TCF Tower\", \"TCF Sunburst\"Logo: A logo similar to the 20th Century Fox logo, except instead of \"20th CENTURY FOX\", it reads \"TCF\" and contains an explosion-like shape behind it. Underneath, there's a byline.\n\nBylines:\n\n\"FILMED AT THE HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS OF TCF Television Productions, Inc. IRVING ASHER, Executive in Charge of TV Productions\".\n\nFILMED AT THE HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS OF TCF TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS, INC.\n\nIRVING ASHER EXECUTIVE IN CHARGE OF TV PRODUCTION\n\nVariants:\n\nIn some cases, this logo is superimposed over the ending credits image.\n\nIn color shows, the tower is yellow-orange and the background is blue.\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The closing theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare. It's seen on Broken Arrow, How to Marry a Millionaire (the series), and My Friend Flicka in color, also available for viewing on the <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.museum.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Broadcast Communications Archives</a> website.\n\nEditor's Note: The logo design is a familiar albeit distinctive take on the classic Fox structure.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(September 29, 1959-June 5, 1963)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"205\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/685f3f3e760def088e25bebb9b71d06a0f69f1e3\" width=\"366\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"Starry Sky\", \"Floating Structure\"\n\nLogo: We see a backdrop of a night sky covered with stars and clouds. Over this backdrop, we see the following text fade in, not similar to any of their movie logos:\n\n20TH\n\nCENTURY-\n\nFOX------------------\n\nThis company name, in bold letters, fades in as if it were streaking from the bottom left of the screen. The \"20TH\" seems to be more to the right of the other text, as displayed here.\n\nVariant: On Adventures in Paradise, this appeared as an opening logo with a fanfare, followed by the Martin Manulis Productions logo.\n\nFX/SFX: The fading in of the company name.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The opening or closing theme of the show.Availability: Extremely rare. Recently seen on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis on Me-TV and the Shout! Factory DVD set. Also can be seen on Adventures in Paradise, which is currently available for viewing on the Museum of Broadcast Communications Archives website, as well as the short-lived NBC sitcom Five Fingers.Editor's Note: This logo certainly deviated from the familiar Fox tower structure. However, it's nothing too strange.\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(November 6, 1957-1966)\n\n20th Century-Fox Television (1962)20th Century-Fox Television (1964) <iframe height=\"134\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/c9b9037147af66a8f7e382cf3961520caac5c1e6\" width=\"240\"></iframe><iframe height=\"134\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/18c674b350f38012ed5967004dbc163624b3fe9e\" width=\"238\"></iframe><iframe height=\"135\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/11e7d09b50369ddd1bcf0b4f4249ed8976bf2b86\" width=\"241\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe height=\"135\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/7b180af7b507e4fe13930f6d0cf196dd00a611de\" width=\"164\"></iframe><iframe height=\"135\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/bf75c1e0daa29c5227325777eaa8bc9d26b05f6c\" width=\"241\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"The Searchlights\", \"Zoom Out\", \"20th Television Fox\", \"The Tower of Doom\"\n\nLogo: We see the usual 1935 film logo animating. We start off with the logo close-up. The camera then backs away as the word \"TELEVISION\", slanted at an angle, suddenly appears and rapidly zooms out, plastering itself on top of the \"CENTURY\" on the stack of words, filling the whole screen.\n\nVariants:\n\nThe logo also appears in sepia-tone.\n\nSometimes, the camera would back away slowly.\n\nSometimes, a sped-up variant of the logo exists.\n\nThe movie logo of the time opened the pilot to The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, \"Caper at the Bijou\", with the Martin Manulis Productions logo (the fanfare plays over the Martin Manulis logo).\n\nOn some variants, when the word \"Television\" zooms out, the searchlights abruptly jump back to where they began when the logo began.\n\nFX/SFX: The searchlights, and the text \"TELEVISION\" zooming out.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\n\n1959-1964: A rearrangement of the Alfred Newman fanfare used on the movie variation.\n\n1961-1966: A short tune played on muted trumpets and strings that is a variation of the jingle, but does not sound exactly like a Fox jingle.\n\n1963-1964: A shortened variant of the 1959 theme.\n\n1965-1966: A sped-up/shortened version of the 1961 theme.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nOn the TV series Hong Kong, there are three different arrangements of the 1959 theme.\n\nIn some cases, it used only the closing theme of the show, or none. This is the case for The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.\n\nAvailability: Very rare. It can be seen on season 1 reruns of Daniel Boone on World Harvest Television (also available on the Liberation/Goldhil DVD release) and on reruns of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis and 12 O'Clock High on Me-TV, as well as the Season 1 Blu-ray of Lost In Space. Fox updated this with a newer logo (most likely 20th Television) on most prints and DVD releases of shows from this era, but can still be seen on older prints. Initially seen on the last episodes of How to Marry a Millionaire and Man Without a Gun before the NTA logo. Also appeared on the short lived Rod Serling western The Loner, and appeared before the Martin Manulis logo on later episodes of Adventures in Paradise.\n\nEditor's Note: The finishing product of this logo (or rather, its design concept) would not only be used for the next 2 logos but would also be the inspiration for 20th Television's name (as the finishing product of this logo has \"TELEVISION\" plastered over \"CENTURY\", making the logo read \"20th Television Fox\"). Also, the fanfares used on this logo, which often sound nothing like the standard TCF fanfare, could startle a few viewers at first.\n\n4th Logo\n\n(September 16, 1965-1984)\n\nNicknames: \"The Searchlights II\", \"Zoom Out II\", \"20th Television Fox II\", \"The Tower of Doom II\", \"Slanted Zero\"\n\nLogo: We have the 1953 theatrical logo. This time, the camera doesn't back away from the tower structure and the \"0\" is slanted. The word \"TELEVISION\" appears again and it slowly plasters itself on top of the word \"CENTURY\".\n\nVariants:\n\nA \"gray scaled\" variant appeared on B&W prints of classic color shows from the era, such as Batman.\n\nThe word \"TELEVISION\" would appear in either gold, orange, or yellow.\n\nIn 1966, the logo is shifted over to the left and the word \"TELEVISION\" zooms out rapidly onto the structure. A tip of the letter \"C\" in \"CENTURY\" is seen.\n\nIn 1976, the registered trademark \"®\" symbol was added to the 1965 logo. Plus, the logo is shifted to the left a little more from the 1966 version, but \"TELEVISION\" remains centered and zooms out again slowly, consequently revealing the \"C\" in \"CENTURY\".\n\nThere is a still version of the 1965 variant with the text \"DISTRIBUTED BY\" on the top left corner of the logo (this was seen at the close of the 1976-78 version of Liars' Club).\n\nOn the TV series The Starlost, it uses a shortened version of the 1953 movie logo.\n\nFX/SFX: Same as the 3rd logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\n\n1965-1969: The same 1961 theme from the 3rd logo.\n\n1966-1984: The same 1965 theme from the 3rd logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nSame as before, it used only the closing theme of the show, or none. On some co-produced shows from the era, a generic theme was used. Post-1986 prints of the 1974 television movie Hurricane use the Metromedia Producers Corporation jingle instead of the standard jingle.\n\nOn the DVD and Blu-ray print of the S1 Batman episode \"Hi Diddle Riddle\", it uses the 1989 theme from the next logo, due to the HD master on this episode using a different source for the audio (in this case, the 1990s video masters). The Portuguese track from this episode, however, uses the 1995 theme from the last logo instead.\n\nHulu prints of M*A*S*H from the first two seasons has this logo with the 1989 TCFTV jingle.\n\nA version of the TCFTV fanfare is incorporated into, and appears at the end of, the theme for the 1976-1982 syndicated documentary series That's Hollywood, which TCFTV produced and distributed. At the end of that show's closing credits, the TCFTV logo is timed to appear as the That's Hollywood theme segues into the logo fanfare as the song ends.\n\nAvailability: Rare, due to frequent plastering by later Fox logos.\n\nThe 1965 version is retained on the 2nd through the final season of Daniel Boone last aired on Retro TV and World Harvest Television, as well as the DVD sets of these seasons from Liberation/Goldhil and DVD/Blu-ray releases of the 1960's Batman series from Warner Home Video.\n\nThe 1976 version is available on the first two episodes of The Fall Guy on the season 1 DVD set, while the next logo is intact on the remainder of the season.\n\nThe Magnetic Video print of The Making of Star Wars from 1979 also has this logo (it was omitted from its 1981 reissue as a double feature with SPFX: The Empire Strikes Back, and replaced by the 20th Television logo in the 1995 reissue and bonus disc 3 of the Star Wars saga Blu-ray set).\n\nIt is also seen on the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special from 1978. Copies of the special have been circulating for decades.\n\nAlso appears on the VHS release of Tomorrow's Child. The Greatest Game Ever Played, aired on Atlanta's WATC 57, June 27, 2009, preserves the 1976 version at the beginning. It's also seen on the Season 2 Blu-ray of Lost in Space.\n\nBeginning in 2017, this logo has been restored on Hulu prints of the first two seasons of M*A*S*H, marking the first time since the 1992 that this logo has been restored to that series. It was also spotted on FOX Classics’ broadcasts of the episodes \"The Price of Tomato Juice\" and \"C*A*V*E\" in Australia, as well as True Entertainment's print of \"Fade Out, Fade In (Part 2)\" in the United Kingdom. It has also recently begun appearing again on Season Three episodes of Lost in Space on MeTV, replacing previous prints of those episodes which had the 1995 20th Television logo with the News Corporation byline.\n\nEditor's Note: The 1976 variant with the shifted text certainly doesn't look very professional. Other than that, it's a decent logo for its time, though again the fanfares may startle some.\n\n5th Logo\n\n(November 11, 1981-1993)\n\nNicknames: \"The Searchlights III\", \"Zoom Out III\", \"20th Television Fox III\", \"The Tower of Doom III\"\n\nLogo: Same as the 1981 theatrical logo, with the word \"TELEVISION\" zooming out and plastering over the word \"CENTURY\".\n\nVariants:\n\nThis exists as both a filmed and a videotaped/telecine version. Originally presented on film throughout its whole run, it also appeared in telecine format starting in 1986.\n\nThe word \"TELEVISION\" would appear in either gold, yellow, orange, or ivory.\n\nAround 1984, the sky background looks a bit darker.\n\nOn the short-lived series Working Girl, the unaired TV pilot of Revenge of the Nerds, and The Simpsons S3 episodes: \"Bart the Murderer\", \"Homer Defined\", \"Treehouse of Horror II\", \"Lisa's Pony\", \"Flaming Moe's\", \"I Married Marge\", \"Radio Bart\", \"Separate Vocations\", \"Colonel Homer\", \"Black Widower\", and \"Bart's Friend Falls in Love\", you can see more structure on the logo as it appears further out.\n\nOn some old syndie prints of S1Small Wonder episodes, the logo freezes after \"TELEVISION\" plasters \"CENTURY\" before cutting to black.\n\nThere exists a \"matted\" 1.78:1 widescreen version.\n\nOn a few episodes of Bobby's World, it has a green-ish background.\n\nOn A&E airings of a few season 2 episodes of L.A. Law, the logo animation was strangely in slow motion, but the jingle remain unaffected.\n\nOn a Channel 4 airing of The Simpsons episode \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment,\" the logo cuts out before the final note ends.\n\nFX/SFX: Almost the same as the 4th logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\n\nNovember 11, 1981-August 22, 1991: The same 1965 theme from the 3rd and 5th logos. Even though it mainly stopped being used in late 1989, some shows have used it into the 1990-1991 season, such as S1 and early S2 episodes of In Living Color, the first two S5 episodes of L.A. Law (pretty odd, considering said show used the next theme on November 1989-May 1990 episodes of the fourth season), the L.A. Law 100th Episode Celebration, a few international prints of S1 Bobby's World episodes, and most of season 1 and the first season 2 episode of True Colors.\n\nNovember 1989-1993: A short version of the 1979 Fox jingle, which was later used for the early variant of the standard 20th Television logo from 1992-1993.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nThere are abridged variants of the 1965 theme, such as the case for Hooperman that the closing theme ends abruptly with the last note of the 1965 theme, and Charlie & Co., which used the last 5 notes of the fanfare.\n\nOn some co-produced shows from the era, a generic theme was used.\n\nTwo versions of the 1989 theme exist: one where the last note echoes for a bit after fading out and another without the echo. The latter version was seen on In Living Color, the unaired Revenge of the Nerds pilot, and the 1991 M*A*S*H retrospective Memories of M*A*S*H.\n\nOn some episodes of Mr. Belvedere and the short-lived series Sister Kate, the first note is cut-off (via fade transition).\n\nAvailability: Uncommon.\n\nThe Simpsons episodes \"There's No Disgrace Like Home\", \"Krusty Gets Busted\", \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\", \"Treehouse of Horror II\", \"Saturdays of Thunder\", \"Colonel Homer\", and \"Black Widower\" preserve this logo on their respective season DVD releases.\n\nIt has strangely been spotted on Comedy Central's prints of Office Space and French Kiss, but has been plastered over with the 20th Television logo in recent airings due to split screen credits. A similar situation happened on a few episodes of The Pretender when reran on TNT, but has now been plastered by the 2013 20th Television logo on H&I (Heroes and Icons).\n\nOn VHS, it can be seen on The Simpsons Christmas special, L.A. Law, and, in the UK, on The Simpsons episode \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\".\n\nMore recently, the logo has been sighted on several 1970s-'80s TV movies on Fox Movie Channel. It can also be seen on some early season one and most season two and three episodes of In Living Color on DVD.\n\nThe 1981-1991 and 1989-1993 variants can be found on the Alien Nation series DVD set, along with original airings of Capitol Critters on ABC.\n\nThe 1981-1991 version of this logo can be seen on Fox Movie Channel's prints of The Hurricane.\n\nThe 1980s variants are also seen on the Shout! Factory DVDs of Mr. Belvedere, although FamNET reruns of said show plaster it with the 2008 20th Television logo on almost all episodes, and the 1995 20th Television logo on several episodes while Antenna TV reruns plaster it with the bylineless 2013 20th Television logo on all episodes.\n\nThe 1981 version appeared on the 1985-1988 syndicated run of The $100,000 Pyramid and was preserved on USA reruns. Since 1997 reruns, the logo was plastered by the 1997 Columbia TriStar Television logo.\n\nThis can also be found on the unaired TV pilot of Revenge of the Nerds, which can be found on the \"Panty Raid Edition\" DVD release of Revenge of the Nerds (the movie).\n\nOn Netflix, it can be found on several episodes of the first two seasons of Bobby's World (while others have either the 20th Television or 1996 Saban International logos).\n\nMade a strange appearance on the 10th episode of S4 of In Living Color (that episode being produced during season 3 (1991-92), but not airing until the fourth season).\n\nThe 1989 version can be seen on a handful of early Simpsons episodes on FXNOW, FX's streaming service, in 4:3 mode only. This appeared on the first few episodes of the Fox TV series The Adventures of Beans Baxter before Fox Square Productions took over (which never used a proper logo; just a copyright notice).\n\nDespite general use stopping around 1992, the news series Not Just News (co-produced with Fox Television Stations) used this into 1993.\n\nThe widescreen logo is available on M*A*S*H reruns on Hulu starting in 2017, with the 1989 jingle. Additionally, the 1982 variation was seen plastering the previous logo on FOX Classics' print of “Carry On, Hawkeye\", and True Entertainment's print of \"Fade Out, Fade In (Part 1)\".\n\nTurned up on Me-TV's print of the rarely seen M*A*S*H series finale, \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\".\n\nEditor's Note: It's more of the same like the last two logos, but with the 1981 film logo and a smoother zoom-out on the word \"TELEVISION\". This logo marks the first time that the familiar shortened TCF theme was used for Fox's television logos after approximately three decades of unconventional fanfares.\n\nNote: 20th Century Fox Television was supplanted by Twentieth Television Corporation from 1989 to 1994. From September 18, 1992-March 19, 1995, the standard 20th Television logo of these years was used. See 20th Television for details on that logo.\n\n6th Logo (Dance Fever variant)\n\n(1983-1984)\n\n20th Century-Fox Television (1983)\n\nNicknames: \"The Searchlights IV\", \"The Chryon Searchlights\", \"Print Searchlights\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, we see the '80s TCF print logo. Under it is the word \"TELEVISION\" and a copyright stamp.\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The theme song of Dance Fever.\n\nAvailability: Extinct. It was only seen on season 5 episodes of Dance Fever on local syndication.\n\nEditor's Note: None.7th Logo\n\n(March 19, 1995-)\n\n<iframe height=\"135\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/d55073483708c43379117a16f092bb6de2fb7a5c\" width=\"239\"></iframe><iframe height=\"135\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/d35350443c05d2e94701a5bd6830cb85725e64d2\" width=\"241\"></iframe><iframe height=\"135\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/601ea2a90357a32f7da6e52a4e8393042c07179f\" width=\"239\"></iframe><iframe height=\"135\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/b4046d679c45a6d8f1653e35c99129658b0f2f2b\" width=\"241\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"The Searchlights V\", \"CGI Searchlights\", \"Zooming Tower\", \"The Tower of Tepidity\", \"The 20th Tower\"\n\nLogo: It's exactly the same as the standard 20th Television logo, but now the stack of words has been modified to resemble the standard Fox stack, with \"TELEVISION\" added to the bottom and the whole thing looking rather taller, reading \"20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION\". When the logo is finished zooming out, the registered trademark \"®\" symbol and the News Corporation byline fade in at the same time.\n\nVariants:\n\nAn early variant from 1995-1997 featured a slightly darker tower.\n\nOn Futurama, the logo and the more recent syndie prints' 20th Television logo read \"30th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION\", as that show is set in the 31st Century. Also, the registered trademark \"®\" symbol is replaced with the trademark \"TM\" symbol. This was also seen at the end of The Simpsons episode \"Simpsorama\". On a recent Channel 4 airing of the episode, there was an extremely bad editing mistake revealed, as just the fanfare finishes, the 3 changes back to a 2!\n\nOn the short-lived sitcom Andy Richter Controls the Universe, the text \"IN ASSOCIATION WITH\" below the News Corporation byline fades in at the same time as the News Corporation byline. On the region 1 DVD release of the series from CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution, this and the 2003 Paramount Domestic Television logo are removed in favor of the CBS Television Distribution logo, although both were retained when the show aired on Universal HD a few years ago. It is presumed that international releases of the series on DVD will retain the original end logos since Fox owns the international rights.\n\n1998-2007: On shows featured/produced in widescreen/high definition, the sky background is more blue, with less realistic searchlights. Debuted on Martial Law with the already formed logo squished to 4:3, then cropped to 4:3 in season 2, while most shows began using the widescreen variant in 1999.\n\nOn seasons 3-5 of Soul Food, there is a still version of this logo. On The Simpsons Arcade Game, downloadable on Xbox Live and PSN, a still version of the enhanced logo is used.\n\nOn April 13, 2007, starting with Drive, the logo was given a more \"enhanced\" look with more realistic effects, the registered trademark \"®\" symbol is already there and the News Corp. byline fades in later. However, some shows still used the 1995 variant, such as King of the Hill (until November 25, 2007), American Dad! (until May 11, 2008), The Simpsons (until February 15, 2009), and Family Guy (until September 27, 2009).\n\nOn the 2009 animated sitcom Sit Down, Shut Up, there was a shortened version of the 2007 logo.\n\nBeginning with the 9th season of Bones on September 16, 2013, the logo is bylineless. This was due to the split of News Corporation which occurred back at the end of June (with Fox and all of the former company's entertainment divisions going to the then-newly-formed 21st Century Fox). Strangely, The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, Family Guy, and American Dad! still used the byline until November 10, 2013. The Simpsons and Family Guy started using the byline-less version on November 17, 2013, while Bob's Burgers and American Dad! started using it on November 24, 2013.\n\nThe short-lived Sci-Fi (now Syfy) Channel series The Chronicle: News from the Edge had a very rare and interesting \"International\" variant. The first one or two seconds shows a cloudy background similar to what was used on the Television logo of the time, with the words \"DISTRIBUTED BY\" appearing first. After that, it cuts to the 1995 logo placed in the middle of the screen, with the animation slowed down, but more or less complete with the News Corp. byline, and under that is the words \"INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION\".\n\nOn The Simpsons S9 episode \"The Last Temptation of Krust\", nearing the end of a musical number, the 1995 logo with the '97 fanfare appears, but is pushed away by the remainder of the episode. This variant is preserved on syndication prints.\n\nOn the pre-broadcast pilot of the short-lived series A.U.S.A., the logo is slightly extended, starting off with a close-up of the structure, then easing into the normal animation. The standard version was used when it hit broadcast.\n\nFX/SFX: The logo zooming out, and the byline and registered trademark \"®\" symbol fading in.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Here are the main versions:\n\nMarch 19, 1995-December 7, 1997: A re-arranged and re-recorded variant of the 1989 jingle by Bruce Broughton. It is slightly different from the 1995 20th Television fanfare. It's the 2nd alternate theme that was first used for 20th Television in 1992.\n\n1995-January 12, 2005: The 1995 20th Television fanfare. Also used on the \"International\" variant.\n\nOctober 19, 1997-: A re-arranged, re-recorded, faster variant of the 1961 jingle.\n\nApril 13, 2007-: A re-orchestrated, truncated/altered version of the 1997 film jingle, albeit edited to resemble the 1995-1997 jingle.\n\nMay 19, 2009-October 4, 2012: Another truncated variant of the 1997 film jingle, much shorter than the above. Used on Glee.\n\nNovember 4, 2012-: The 2008 20th Television fanfare.\n\nSeptember 21, 2015-: The last 4 notes of the 1997 20th Century Fox fanfare; the last note is cut short. Used only on the short variant.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nFox network commonly uses their own fanfare over logos, before the split screen show promo/credits; due to the fact that much Fox programming is produced by Fox, these fanfares go well with this logo. From 1997-2001, a simple Fox drum roll was used; the 2001-2002 season introduced different \"remixes\" of the Fox fanfare (including the John Williams one), usually only using the final four notes. Many of them were done by a California-based company named Groove Addicts. The John Williams one was used on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bzqlAZH_uo\" target=\"_self\">a tape of The Pitts</a>.\n\nIn exceptional cases, it used the closing theme of the show, or silence.\n\nA warp speed version of the 1995-1997 theme exists, which was still used on 24, and S1 episodes of Lie to Me.\n\nSometimes, only the second half of the theme will play.\n\nThere are many abridged variations of the 1997 jingle such as American Dad! and The Cleveland Show that used it.\n\nThere is also a long version of the theme.\n\nOn 1995-1997 and some post-1997 episodes of The Simpsons, such as the S9 episode \"Simpson Tide\", the S16 episode \"Treehouse of Horror XV\", the S19 episode \"Treehouse of Horror XVIII\", and the S21 episode \"Treehouse of Horror XX\", the 1989 TCFTV logo theme is played.\n\nOn Seth & Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show and the first two episodes of Bob's Burgers, the same 1989 TCFTV logo theme is played, except the pitch is a bit higher.\n\nOn the Family Guy episode \"Blue Harvest\", the 1997 fanfare is low-pitched to fit in with the show's closing theme.\n\nOn the Network Ten and Sky 1 airings of 24: Live Another Day in Australia and the United Kingdom, a warp speed version of the 1995 20th Television fanfare was strangely used on the 2013 bylineless variant.\n\nSky 1's print of The Simpsons season 10 episode \"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\" features the 1995 20th Television fanfare.\n\nOn Quintuplets, the 1999 filmed TCFTV tower features the 1995 20th Television fanfare.\n\nHITS airing of The X-Files has the 2007 revision with 1995 20th Television fanfare.\n\nOn The Simpsons season 7 episode \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\", the fanfare comes in roughly half a second to one second after the logo starts animating. Given Sky 1's prints of older episodes freeze at the end transitioning into commercials, the last note of the fanfare is abruptly cut off.\n\nThe American Dad! season 9 episode \"Da Flippity Flop\" uses the 2012 TCFTV fanfare, rather than the usual abridged version of the '97 fanfare. As a result of this, given how short this variant of the logo normally is, the last few notes of the fanfare play over a black screen. ITV2's broadcast of the episode fixes this in a way by freezing the logo before the cut to black, so the fanfare finishes over the static image.\n\nThe American Dad! season 9 episode \"The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith\" uses an abridged version of the 2012 TCFTV fanfare, consisting of the first two notes and the last four notes of the standard fanfare. Strangely, this fanfare isn't present on any other episode, despite fitting the length of the logo as opposed to the example directly above.\n\nSome episodes of The Simpsons on Fox in Bulgaria have a double-pitched variant of the 1997 theme. This could be due to the fact that the episodes are PAL prints aired in the country.\n\nAppears on select St. Elsewhere episodes on Hulu. The end theme plays as the logo appears (credits were adjusted to fit in the logo as the theme song ends). However, at least one instance forgets to cut out and thusly you can hear the meow sound effect from the MTM Enterprises logo even though it is plastered with this one.\n\nAvailability: Very common. Typically found on network programming provided by Fox. Also seen on some CBS (Yes, Dear, Martial Law, and Still Standing, etc), NBC (The Pretender, 1997-2000 seasons and the two TV movies), or ABC (The Practice and Boston Legal, etc.) shows. May or may not be present in syndicated repeats of network programs, as the 20th TV logo may follow or plaster it. The still shot version of this logo can be found on Soul Food: The Series, starting with S3, DVD's (released by CBS) retain it. The version with the edited 1997 theme can be seen on reruns of American Dad! and Family Guy reruns on Adult Swim, among others. DVD releases of The Simpsons, starting with the 15th season, plaster the 1995 logo with the 2007 logo. Sky 1 in the UK has recently been airing upscaled HD 'remasters' of The Simpsons season 8 episodes, plastering the 1995 logo with the 2007 logo. This logo makes a surprise appearance on seasons 1-3 of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on both Netflix in the USA and French airings. The bylineless 2013 variant plasters the Fox Television Studios logo on Netflix prints of Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nEditor's Note: While both the 1995 and 2007 versions have held up well enough, this logo and its 20th Television counterpart strangely have not been updated to match the 2009 theatrical logo. This version of the tower design has been used since 1992 (albeit in a modified form) which even predates the 1994 film version."
