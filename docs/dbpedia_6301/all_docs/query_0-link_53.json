        "text": "My Name is McCrae Cook and Disney,I know you're one of the greatest entertainment companies in history and brought so much magic to everyone for 100 years,but your most biggest dumbest,expensive, and most horizontal decision you ever did was acquire was the assets of 21st Century-Fox(including 20th Century-Fox,,which they acquired on March 20th,2019 5 years ago. Not only this was a stupid and unneccassary move by the Mouse House to gain access to itâ€™s film library for it's streaming service, Disney+ and use it to get a hold in blockbuster content as a attempt to get greater control in the film industry,which is just hypocritical since Disney used to have Touchstone Pictures and they used to own and helped make Miramax a iconic name in Hollywood from 1993 to 2010,this is just heartbreaking and devastating to the people of Hollywood and many people who grew up with 20th Century-Fox,since Fox used to be a huge iconic movie/television studio and important name in Hollywood since it gave us some of the best franchises such as M*A*S*H,Home Alone,The Simpsons,Buffy The Vampire Slayer,Alien,Predator,X-Men,Fantastic Four,Ice Age,Rio,and Deadpool,iconic movie stars such as Shirley Temple,Gregory Peck,and Marylin Monroe,TV greats like Family Guy,M*A*S*H,the 60's Batman cartoon,American Dad,How I Met Your Mother,Modern Family,Glee,Bob's Burgers,Futurama,and King of The Hill and some of the greatest movies such as The Sound of Music,The King and I,Speed,Titanic,Star Wars,Cast Away,Moulin Rouge,Miracle on 34th Street,The Grapes of Wrath,The Robe,Fantastic Voyage,The French Connection,The Rocky Horror Picture Show,Independence Day,and The Robe,and many more.\n\nI understand Rupert Murdoch sold off most of 21st Century-Fox's assets to Disney to focus more on sports and news and the Fox ownership was putting a strain on his family for years and has now spun off the rest in Fox Corporation.,but he needs to know the real truth why Disney wanted to buy his movie studio and a few assets in the first place. Also,Fox has made more than thousand movies,TV shows,video games,home video units,and networks like Disney did,so it's kinda weird since Fox's huge film-television library would be impossible to fit in Disney's vault and I'm upset they shut down Fox's research lab at it's studio lot and caused so many layoffs at Fox Studios becuase of the whole Disney-Fox merger. It also led to a lot of cancellations to movies in production at 20th Century-Fox such as Mouse Guard,sequels to Alita and The Greatest Showman,Gambit(a X-Men spinoff),On The Come Up,News of The World,Mega Man,Chronicle 2,Flash Gordon,Magic:The Gathering,Play-Doh,Assassin's Creed 2,Hitman,The Sims,and more,which is also devastating and sad as well.\n\nThey should've used their minds and made a deal with Fox to bring it's film-television library to Disney+ to expand it instead of acquiring the whole studio from the Murdoch family. While I'm mixed and fine with Disney acquiring ABC,Pixar,Lucasfilm(the creators of Star Wars) and Marvel,this whole Fox acquisition was just a dumb and unnecessary move and a desperate attempt to cash in on blockbuster content and find something to expand Disney+. Not only they bought Fox,but they ended up shutting down Blue Sky Studios because of COVID-19 and starting milking some of Fox's franchises with horrible crappy streaming movies such as Adventures of Buck Wild,the Diary of A Wimpy Kid animated movie trilogy,Home Sweet Home Alone,and Night At The Museum:Kamurah Rises Again and making horrible self-promotional Simpsons Disney+ shorts advertising Disney properties.\n\nWhile I'm glad Disney is making good decisions again with the divisive move to focus more on sequels mixed with originals(for better or worse),considering going on quality over quantity according to Disney CEO,Bob Iger,now getting the rights to Deadpool,Fantastic Four, and X-Men and bringing them to the Marvel Cinematic Universe now and now getting the original prints of Star Wars from 20th Century Fox now, we need to sign,support,and share this petition and stand up to get the people both at Disney and Fox Corporation to reconsider and regret their big mistake 5 years ago by getting Disney to sell back 20th Century Studios to Fox Corporation now,cause I miss 20th Century-Fox as a huge entertainment studio in Hollywood and Disney needs to reconsider and have a talk with the Murdochs about their horrible mistake(as Walt Disney said,\"I don't make money for movies,I make movies to earn money),and sell the studio back to them,so Fox could become a major movie-entertainment powerhouse again and consider Disney to bring back Touchstone Pictures in a some way,maybe start a new production office for Touchstone on the Disney lot and start a new art-house film label(Buena Vista Pictures),and have the Fox movie-television library back in the vaults at Fox Studios and have many of them restored in 4K Ultra HD and Blu-ray under the relaunched 20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment and released on the big screen again.\n\nAlso,merge 20th Century Animation and 20th Television Animation into 20th Century-Fox Animation and revive Fox films cancelled by Disney. Disney has owned enough properties already and they need to go back to Walt's original vision and lessen on the rules a bit,such as the theme park ideas(since people deserve the world more) and focusing on originality again,they should keep 20thCF's library on Disney+ by still signing a deal with Fox to bring them to the streaming platform and still make new content for it's streaming service,and have [adult swim] and TBS bring back Family Guy and keep Bob's Burgers.\n\nand Finally,have Disney CEO,Bob Iger apologize to Fox Corp and everyone for the whole merger 5 years ago. Come on,everyone,we must continue and sign,support,and share this whole petition to get Disney and Fox's attention through media coverage,so we can undo Disney's ownership of 20th Century-Fox and sell it back to Fox Corporation and let everyone at Disney and Fox Corp know were making a difference for both companies now."
