        "text": "Do you like action, adventure, magic, really fast car chases, and a bit of humor?\n\nIf so, you may be a fan of Universal Orlando! Around these theme parks, you can find dedicated lands to movies such as Jurassic Park, Harry Potter, the Fast and the Furious franchise, and even The Simpsons. But we have a clue that could mean the closure of the whole area devoted to the comedy and jokes of the yellow family, the Simpsons.\n\nWhat Is Simpsons Land?\n\nSimpsons Land is at Universal Studios Florida at Universal Orlando Resort. It brings to life the home (Springfield) of the famous 2-D yellow family.\n\nYou’ll find places to eat and shop in the land, but the biggest attraction here is probably The Simpsons Ride. The Simpsons Ride is a high-extreme motion simulator ride in the dark. If you get motion sick easily, chances are pretty good you’ll get sick on this ride.\n\nYou’ll also find The Twirl ‘n’ Hurl inside Simpsons Land! This ride will take you for a dizzy ride that may just result in you seeing your donut for a second time (D’OH!)\n\nYou can eat donuts and meet the family all around this cool land. But your time in Simpsons Land may be coming to an end.\n\nWhy Is It Closing?\n\nSo what is happening that would make this popular land in Universal Studios Florida close? Well, Disney officially took ownership of The Simpsons when the company acquired 20th Century Fox (Fox) in 2019.\n\nWhile Disney already owns The Simpsons, Universal has a licensing agreement to use the content within its theme park, but that agreement comes to an end in 2028.\n\nWhile there hasn’t been any formal announcement about the closing of Simpsons Land, we highly anticipate that after 2028, when the licensing agreement is up, the land will, in fact, shut down. It’s unlikely that Disney will want its content in a Universal theme park once there is no longer an agreement to do so.\n\nYou can watch episodes of The Simpsons on Disney+, and if you’re a fan, we highly encourage you to get to the Universal Studios Florida version of Springfield sooner, rather than later!\n\nIn the meantime, keep following AllEars for more Universal updates!\n\nThe Ten Best Rides in Universal Orlando\n\nJoin the AllEars.net Newsletter to get the free list ranking rides at Universal Studios Florida!
