        "text": "Article III, Section 1:\n\nThe judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that Article I courts can adjudicate cases involving “public rights” —cases that arise between a private actor and the government. The public rights theory can be traced back to the Court’s 1855 ruling in Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co. In that case, Justice Joseph Story explained that, although Congress cannot withdraw from federal courts the jurisdiction to hear suits at common law, equity, or admiralty, “there are matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which Congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.” In essence, the Court distinguished between matters that historically had been decided by courts and matters that arose between the government and others and had been historically resolved by executive or legislative acts. Thus, under Murray’s Lessee, certain matters arising between the government and others that might be susceptible to judicial determination may also be referred to Article I courts. Congress does not have sole discretion to determine what matters fall within that class. In subsequent cases, the Court has held that matters susceptible of judicial determination, but not requiring it, include claims against the United States; the disposal of public lands and claims arising therefrom; questions concerning membership in Indian tribes; and questions arising out of the administration of the customs and internal revenue laws. Courts such as consular courts and military courts martial may be justified on similar grounds.\n\nThe Supreme Court has offered several rationales for why public rights cases can be handled in Article I courts. The first is based on the doctrine of sovereign immunity and postulates that, because Congress need not allow suits against the government at all, the legislature is free to attach conditions to the federal government being sued, including what type of forum the claims can be brought in. The second major rationale is that, historically, these cases were conclusively determined by the Executive and Legislative Branches, “and that as a result there can be no constitutional objection to Congress’s employing the less drastic expedient of committing their determination to a legislative court or an administrative agency.”\n\nAs a general matter, the Court has broadly defined public rights cases as those that arise “between the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments.” At the core of the public rights doctrine are cases involving claims for benefits against the government. Private rights cases, by contrast, pertain to the “liability of one individual to another under the law as defined.” Beyond these general definitions, the Supreme Court has not articulated the exact parameters of the public rights doctrine. As Chief Justice John Roberts has noted, “our discussion of the public rights exception . . . has not been entirely consistent, and the exception has been the subject of some debate.” However, a series of Supreme Court cases have attempted to draw the line between public and private rights.\n\nIn 1932, in Crowell v. Benson, the Court approved an administrative scheme for evaluating maritime employee compensation claims, subject to judicial review, although the case involved a matter of private right. The scheme was permissible, the Court said, because in cases arising out of congressional statutes, an administrative tribunal could make findings of fact and render an initial decision on legal and constitutional questions, as long as there was adequate review in a constitutional court. The “essential attributes” of decisions must remain in an Article III court, but so long as they do, Congress may use administrative decisionmakers in those private rights cases that arise in the context of a comprehensive federal statutory scheme.\n\nIn the 1982 case Northern Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipeline Co., the Court addressed whether Article I bankruptcy courts could adjudicate common law contract and tort claims. Acknowledging that the “distinction between public and private rights has not been definitely explained” in the Court’s precedents, Justice William J. Brennan, writing for a plurality of the Court, traced three historical exceptions to the literal command of Article III: territorial courts, military courts, and courts and agencies that adjudicate public rights. Disposing of the first two categories as clearly inapplicable, the plurality also rejected the public rights argument as the underlying case did not arise between government and a private party, but involved a state-created claim between two private parties.\n\nIn two cases following Northern Pipeline, the Court rejected a bright line test for the distinction between public and private rights. It instead focused on substance—that is, on the extent to which a particular grant of jurisdiction to an Article I court threatened judicial integrity and separation of powers principles. First, in Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., the Court adopted a functional approach for determining when Congress may use non-Article III forums. The statute in question created a system of binding arbitration, subject to limited judicial review, for determining the amount of compensation due to pesticide manufacturers whose data had been used by other manufacturers to register their products. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, writing for the majority, asserted that “substance rather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories should inform application of Article III.” Because the arbitration scheme (1) was created by federal statute, (2) was a “pragmatic solution to the difficult problem of spreading [ ] costs,” and (3) did not “preclude review of the arbitration proceeding by an Article III court,” the Court found that it “did not threaten the independent role the Judiciary in our constitutional scheme.” Two years later, in Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) v. Schor, the Court reaffirmed Thomas’s functional approach and held that the CFTC was empowered to hear common law counterclaims related to violations of the Commodities Exchange Act or CFTC regulations.\n\nIn a subsequent case, Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, the Court held that the distinction between public and private rights determined both whether a matter could be referred to a non-Article III tribunal and whether Congress could dispense with a civil jury trial. Granfinanciera suggests that seemingly private causes of action between private parties will also be deemed public rights when Congress, acting for a valid legislative purpose pursuant to its Article I powers, fashions a cause of action that is analogous to a common law claim and integrates it so closely into a public regulatory scheme that it becomes a matter appropriate for agency resolution with limited involvement by the Article III Judiciary.\n\nIn the 2011 case Stern v. Marshall, the Court shifted away from the functionalism of Thomas and Schor and back towards the formalism of Northern Pipeline. In Stern, the issue was whether a bankruptcy court could adjudicate a common law claim for fraudulent interference with a gift. In a 5-4 decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court held that Article III prohibited the bankruptcy court’s exercise of jurisdiction because the common law claim did not fall under the public rights exception. The Court acknowledged that Thomas and Schor had declined to limit the public rights exception to actions involving the government as a party, but it concluded that the Court had continued to limit the exception to claims deriving from a “federal regulatory scheme” or in which “an expert Government agency is deemed essential to a limited regulatory objective.” In rejecting applying the public rights exception to the fraudulent interference counterclaim, the Court observed that the claim was not one that could be “pursued only by grace of the other branches” or could have been “determined exclusively” by the Executive or Legislative Branches. Additionally, the underlying claim did not “flow from a federal regulatory scheme” and was not limited to a “particularized area of law.” Because the counterclaim involved the “most prototypical exercise of judicial power,” adjudication of a common law cause of action not created by federal law, the Court rejected the bankruptcy courts’ exercise of jurisdiction over the counterclaim as a breach of Article III."
