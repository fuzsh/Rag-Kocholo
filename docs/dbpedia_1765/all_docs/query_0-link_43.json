        "text": "Benjamin Weiser\n\nI’m a reporter for The New York Times covering the federal courts and U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.\n\nWhat I Cover\n\nMy reporting often focuses on prominent trials, including E. Jean Carroll’s $83.3 million defamation verdict against Donald J. Trump and the sex trafficking case of Ghislaine Maxwell. I’ve covered the death penalty trials of three men. But I also try to examine parts of the justice system that are hidden from public view: the lapses inside a jail that allowed Jeffrey Epstein to die in custody; the Trump administration’s attempted interference in cases before the U.S. attorney’s office; and the abuse of developmentally disabled adults in a Bronx group home. I also write longer-form journalism, often with a focus on mental illness. I chronicled the life of a homeless woman who spent years on New York’s streets, and wrote about a man who was arrested sleeping on a park bench in Los Angeles, was mistaken for an escaped drug dealer and ended up in a New York State prison for two years, despite his protests that he was the wrong man.\n\nMy Background\n\nI joined The Times in 1997 as a member of the metro staff — my home ever since. Earlier in my career, after graduating from Brown, where I reported for the college radio station, I was a researcher for Bob Woodward on “The Brethren,” his book about the Supreme Court. I then spent 18 years at The Washington Post, first covering the Maryland and D.C. courts and then working on the investigative unit.\n\nI’m gratified whenever my work resonates with readers and may have impact, and over the years, my reporting has also received a George Polk Award and a Livingston Award and has been a Pulitzer finalist three times (once as a member of a team.)\n\nJournalistic Ethics\n\nI strive to be accurate, fair and empathetic in my reporting, and I keep an open mind. I don’t make political donations or sign on to political causes. I know people take risks in speaking to reporters and I’m committed to protecting sources who provide me with sensitive information that I believe is important for the public to know. And I’m committed to upholding the standards of integrity outlined in The Times’s Ethical Journalism Handbook."
