An official can be impeached for treason, bribery, and âother high crimes and misdemeanors.â\n\nLearn more about impeachment, including its history and how the U.S. Constitution grants impeachment powers to Congress.\n\nPast impeachments of federal officials\n\nThe House has initiated impeachment proceedings more than 60 times. But there have been only 21 impeachments. This includes three presidents, one cabinet secretary, and one senator. Of those who were impeached, only eight officials were found guilty by the Senate and removed from office. All eight were federal judges.\n\nThe presidents impeached by the House were:\n\nAndrew Johnson in 1868\n\nWilliam Jefferson (Bill) Clinton in 1998\n\nDonald John Trump in 2019 and 2021\n\nPresidents Johnson, Clinton, and Trump remained in office following acquittals by the Senate on all charges.\n\nFormer President Richard Nixon was not impeached. He resigned after Congress started the impeachment process against him in 1974.\n\nImpeachment of state and local officials"
