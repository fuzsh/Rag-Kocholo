        "text": "The Judicial Conference convenes twice a year to consider administrative and policy issues affecting the federal court system, and to make recommendations to Congress concerning legislation involving the Judicial Branch. Learn more about:\n\nReports of the Proceedings\n\nMembership\n\nOrganization\n\nJudicial Conference Committees\n\nHistory\n\nReports of the Proceedings\n\nRead summary reports issued following sessions of the Judicial Conference dating back to its origin. The proceedings detail actions taken, who was present at the session, and other information.\n\nMembership\n\nThe Chief Justice of the United States is the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference. Membership is comprised of the chief judge of each judicial circuit, the Chief Judge of the Court of International Trade, and a district judge from each regional judicial circuit.\n\nA circuit chief judge's term on the Conference is concurrent with his or her term as chief judge of the circuit. With limited exceptions, 28 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1)b provides that a circuit’s chief judge may serve for seven years or until attaining the age of seventy, whichever comes first. Similar provisions apply to the Chief Judge of the Court of International Trade. See 28 U.S.C. § 258.\n\nDistrict judge representatives are elected for terms of not less than three nor more than five successive years, as established by majority vote of all circuit and district judges of the circuit (28 U.S.C. § 331). By Conference policy, terms begin and end on Oct. 1 of any given year.\n\nMarch 2024 Members (pdf)\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference serves as the senior executive arm of the Conference, acting on its behalf between sessions on matters requiring emergency action as authorized by the Chief Justice; the Executive Committee is not otherwise a policymaking committee of the Judicial Conference.\n\nThe Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) serves as Secretary to the Judicial Conference and is an ex-officio member of the Executive Committee. The AO Director coordinates administrative support to the Conference itself and the Executive Committee. The AO Director also coordinates the activities of AO professional staff who dedicate all or much of their time supporting the work of the Judicial Conference and its committees.\n\nJudicial Conference Committees\n\nThe Conference operates through a network of committees. These committees focus on specific topics such as information technology, human resources, probation and pretrial services, space and facilities, security, budget, defender services, court administration, rules of practice and procedure, and magistrate and bankruptcy judge matters. The Chief Justice has sole authority to make committee appointments.\n\nJudicial Conference committees review issues within their established jurisdictions and make policy recommendations to the Conference. The committees are policy-advisory entities and are not involved in making day-to-day management decisions for the federal courts or for the Administrative Office. Judicial Conference committees derive their jurisdiction from the Conference itself and the Chief Justice as presiding officer.\n\nMatters Before Committees\n\nIn addition to reviewing issues within their established jurisdictions, Conference committees may also study relevant matters requested by the Chief Justice of the United States, the Executive Committee, the Conference Secretary (AO Director), Congress, federal judges, circuit judicial councils, and other Conference committees, or as required by statute.\n\nRequests for consideration of items by the Judicial Conference or one of its committees should be directed to the AO Director.\n\nList of Committees\n\nThe Executive Committee\n\nCommittee on Audits and Administrative Office Accountability\n\nCommittee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System\n\nCommittee on the Budget\n\nCommittee on Codes of Conduct\n\nCommittee on Court Administration and Case Management\n\nCommittee on Criminal Law\n\nCommittee on Defender Services\n\nCommittee on Federal-State Jurisdiction\n\nCommittee on Financial Disclosure\n\nCommittee on Information Technology\n\nCommittee on Intercircuit Assignments\n\nCommittee on International Judicial Relations\n\nCommittee on the Judicial Branch\n\nCommittee on Judicial Conduct and Disability\n\nCommittee on Judicial Resources\n\nCommittee on Judicial Security\n\nCommittee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System\n\nCommittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure\n\nAdvisory Committee on Appellate Rules\n\nAdvisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules\n\nAdvisory Committee on Civil Rules\n\nAdvisory Committee on Criminal Rules\n\nAdvisory Committee on Evidence Rules\n\nCommittee on Space and Facilities\n\nHistory\n\nCongress established the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges in 1922, at the urging of Chief Justice (and former President) William Howard Taft. In 1948, Congress renamed it the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n\nIn its earliest years, the Conference addressed rising caseloads caused by Prohibition, and established procedures for accurate, comprehensive statistics to measure court business. Over its first century, the Conference grappled with many issues, such as the need for additional judgeships, natural disasters, public-health crises, containing costs, changes in technology, and judicial security.\n\nThe Conference also has played a central role in improving efficient case management, reducing sentencing disparities, and overseeing changes to federal rules of practice and procedure."
