Agencies also identify Performance Measures to track their performance on achieving their strategic plan objectives. View agency strategic plans and objectives online and track their progress.\n\nThe Auditor of Public Accounts (APA) serves Virginia citizens and decision-makers by providing unbiased, accurate information and sound recommendations to improve accountability and financial management of public funds. It is part of the legislative branch of Virginia government and reports through the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) of the General Assembly. This structure provides independence from the executive and judicial branch agencies it audits. View financial reports and audits for public accounts, report fraud or review procedural documents.\n\nYour source for information about proposed changes to Virginiaâ€™s regulations including a meetings calendar and board minutes.
