        "text": "Based on various authorities, GSA is able to support the procurement needs of eligible state, local, territorial, and tribal governments, including instrumentalities as well as other eligible non-Federal entities. This webpage provides an overview of these authorities, the GSA sources available, and the process supporting such use.\n\nThe GSA Office of Acquisition Policy (OAP) has been delegated the authority in GSA Order ADM 5450.39D, Chapter 6 to make determinations of eligibility for entities to use GSA sources in accordance with GSA Order OGP 4800.2I (Note: GSA Order OGP 4800.2I is in the process of being updated. The appendices contained in the order have been replaced by the searchable table provided in Section I below.)\n\nSee Section I for a list of entities that have already been determined to be eligible.\n\nSee Section II for information on how to request an eligibility determination.\n\nSee Sections III(a) and III(b) for charts that identify the different types of entities and corresponding GSA sources/programs available to the entity type.\n\nSee Section IV for information on some of the limitations/conditions surrounding eligibility and use of GSA sources.\n\nSee Section V for what is not covered by the eligibility process performed by GSA OAP.\n\nPlease note:\n\nNon-profit status alone is not sufficient to grant eligibility. Generally, commercial non-profit organizations are not eligible.\n\nFederal grantees are generally not eligible to use GSA sources.\n\nI. List of eligible entities\n\nThe searchable table below identifies entities that have been determined eligible by GSA’s OAP. You can search/filter the table by entity name, entity type, and/or the state where the entity is located (if applicable). When reviewing the data, please note the following:\n\nThe listing of eligible entities in the table below is updated regularly, but is not a fully exhaustive listing.\n\nFor ease of use and simplicity purposes, the table identifies the primary entity and not each and every component that comprises the primary entity. For example, the table identifies the name of cities in lieu of identifying each and every office/department that comprises a city’s government, such as the mayor’s office and accounting department.\n\nThe table must be read with the understanding that though an entity may be listed, an entity still must meet/comply with any and all applicable limitations/conditions surrounding eligibility as well as the use of GSA source (see Section IV).\n\nFor purposes of distinguishing between entities with the same or similar name, additional text may have been added to an entity’s name (e.g., the name of a local educational agency may have “(located in [name of State])” added to reflect the state the entity is located in).\n\nSearch eligible entities\n\nName of entity\n\nEntity type\n\nState\n\nName of entity Entity type State/Location\n\nIf you are not able to locate an entity you are looking for, please review Section II below for information on how to request an eligibility determination.\n\nII. How to request an eligibility determination\n\nEntities are encouraged to review the list of existing eligible entities provided in Section I above before submitting a request. Entities requesting eligibility determinations must submit the following information to gsaeligibilitydetermination@gsa.gov.\n\nIdentify the entity type that best describes your organization from the chart in Section III(a) or Section III(b) below (e.g., state or local instrumentality, tribal organization under ISDEAA).\n\nIdentify the specific authority(ies) that best supports your organization’s eligibility (e.g., state or local statute/code creating the entity). Include any specific citations or attachments to streamline the review (e.g., section, paragraph or articles of incorporations). Please note that tax certificates do not satisfy this requirement.\n\nIdentify the specific GSA source(s), reference the chart in Section III(a) or Section III(b) below.\n\nDiscuss any additional information that supports the request.\n\nSubmit copies of or hyperlinks to any supporting documentation (e.g., Articles of Incorporation or most recent Audited Financial Statements), including referenced authorities.\n\nProvide a point of contact, including their address and contact information.\n\nIII(a). What types of entities are eligible (by source/program)\n\n1 GSA Order OGP 4800.2I\n\n2 The term does not include private/charter schools.\n\nIII(b). What Types of Entities are Eligible (By Entity Type)\n\nIV. What are the limitations/conditions surrounding eligibility and use of GSA sources?\n\nLimitations/conditions include the following, but are not limited to:\n\nEligibility does not guarantee product or service availability.\n\nEligibility cannot be transferred to a third party, such as a subcontractor.\n\nEligibility does not include purchases for resale unless specifically authorized.\n\nA GSA source may have additional requirements that must also be met.\n\nUse of GSA sources generally does not mandate participation by a GSA vendor, as sales to non-federal entities are, unless otherwise stated, voluntary.\n\nAll users of GSA sources must comply with the applicable ordering guidance.\n\nThe underlying authority providing use of a GSA source may establish a restriction, limitation, or condition that must be met for purposes of being eligible to use or using the GSA source. For example, 25 U.S.C § 5324(k) requires that for a tribal organization to be eligible they must have an active ISDEAA compact, contract, grant, or cooperative agreement and that the use of the GSA source is used for the purposes of carrying out the ISDEAA compact, contract, grant, or cooperative agreement. If the tribal organization does not meet either of these conditions they cannot use the GSA source under this authority. However, this does not preclude the tribal organization from seeking to use another authority that may be available.\n\nV. What is not covered by the OAP eligibility process?\n\nThe use of government sources by contractors as prescribed by FAR part 51.\n\nThe ability to obtain Federal surplus property.\n\nFixed-price contractors (and subcontractors) ability to purchase security equipment under 41 CFR 101-26.507.\n\nThe purchase of items available under the Wildland Fire Protection program. For information about this program contact Defense Logistics Agency at DLAWFPP@dla.mil or 1-877-DLA-CALL (352-2255).\n\nThe purchase of items available under the U.S. Department of Defense 1122 program.\n\nAdministrative support services from GSA for certain programs (e.g., GSA Advantage, GSA SmartPay) that may be provided to entities deemed eligible. Accessibility of such services is determined by the specific program.\n\nVI. Who can I contact?"
