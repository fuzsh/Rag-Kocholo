        "text": "George Washington was inaugurated as the first United States president on April 30, 1789. He would spend most of his first term defining the role of the executive branch and literally setting up the government.\n\nTimeline\n\nFirst 100 Days\n\nNo president accomplished more at the start of their presidency than George Washington.\n\nexplore timeline\n\nSetting Up a Presidential Cabinet\n\nDuring his first term, George Washington’s cabinet included just four original members: Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph.\n\nLearn more\n\nAppointing the Entire Supreme Court\n\nCongress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789, which formally established the federal judiciary. Since there were no sitting justices at the beginning of his term, George Washington had the unique opportunity to fill all the empty seats in the Supreme Court.\n\nLearn more\n\nNative American Policy\n\nSettlers in several southeastern states were fighting skirmishes with the Native Americans primarily over American land expansion. Holding this land was, in Washington's estimation, a federal matter and a treaty was signed with the Creek.\n\nLearn more\n\nReligious Freedom\n\nSince the Constitution did not ensure religious communities the right to practice many were fearful of persecution. Some communities and their leaders wrote of this concern to President Washington. Between 1789 and 1791, at least 18 different religious groups wrote Washington. His responses which were frequently printed in newspapers often emphasized that religious liberty was not just a blessing, but a right.\n\nLearn more\n\nFirst US Census\n\nThe 1790 census was the first federally sponsored count of the American people and one of the most significant undertakings of Washington's first term.\n\nLearn more\n\nWhiskey Tax\n\nIn January 1791, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton proposed a seemingly innocuous excise tax \"upon spirits distilled within the United States, and for appropriating the same.\" What Congress failed to predict was the vehement rejection of this tax by American citizens.\n\nLearn more\n\nRatification of the Bill of Rights\n\nThe first ten amendments to the United States Constitution comprise James Madison's Bill of Rights. It was ratified on December 15, 1791.\n\nview primary source\n\nConstructing the Nation's Capitol\n\nIn 1790, Washington took personal control over the building of what he once termed \"the seat of Empire.\" He specified the location of the ten-mile square federal district, the President's mansion, and the Capitol on the bank of the Potomac River.\n\nLearn more\n\nSouthern Tour of the United States\n\nPresident George Washington coordinated a journey to the southern states between March 21 and June 4, 1791 to emphasize national unity and familiarize himself with political sentiments in the region.\n\nLearn more\n\nLaying the Cornerstone of the White House\n\nIn 1792, the cornerstone is laid at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue under the guidance of architect James Hoban. It would not be completed during George Washington's presidency. His successor, John Adams, would be the first president to reside in the White House.\n\njohn adams\n\nPresidential Entertaining\n\nTo provide order to the steady stream of visitors to the executive residence, Washington established prescribed days and times to meet with his various constituents.\n\nLearn more\n\nLife in New York City\n\nThe Washington's new home at 3 Cherry Street must have seemed like the center of the universe even though geographically speaking it was not even the center of New York City. Located uptown facing the East River, it was just a few long blocks away from the countryside.\n\nLearn more\n\nMove to Philadelphia\n\nGeorge Washington, and the rest of the government, moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in late 1790. The Washingtons resided on Market Street for the remainder of his presidency.\n\nThe Influencer\n\nWhat did Washington's friend Elizabeth Powel say to convince the reluctant president to run for a second term?\n\nLearn more\n\nThe First President\n\nWashington's Inauguration\n\nNo celebration of a president-elect's inauguration can match the grandeur that surrounded Washington's trip to New York in April 1789 and the subsequent inaugural ceremony at Federal Hall.\n\nThe Library\n\nThe Acts of Congress\n\nLearn more about George Washington's annotated copy of The Acts of Congress—one of the prized holdings in our Library collection.\n\nVideo\n\nJustice Kennedy on George Washington\n\nWatch our interview with Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Learn about the vital role that Washington played during our founding.\n\nState of the Union Address (1790)\n\nOn January 8, 1790, President George Washington delivered to Congress the first State of the Union address in American history. This address presented defense, foreign policy, economic, education, and immigration related topics to gathered representatives and senators in Federal Hall, New York City.\n\nread the address and view primary source\n\nThe First State of the Union Address\n\nMount Vernon President & CEO Douglas Bradburn describes George Washington's 1790 State of the Union Address—the very first State of the Union for the United States.\n\nKey Legislation of Washington's First Term"
