        "text": "The Supreme Court of the United States Police is a federal law enforcement agency, whose primary goal is to ensure the integrity of the Constitutional Mission of the Supreme Court of the United States by protecting the Supreme Court, the Justices, employees, guests, and visitors. As the third branch of government, the Supreme Court is the highest judicial body in the United States and leads the federal judiciary. During a single Supreme Court term, 7,000-8,000 new filings are submitted for review. Each year the Supreme Court is visited by an estimated half a million visitors from around the world.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States Police have allocated staffing for 189 officers, who currently represent 24 States, and 8 Countries. Currently our department is 26% female, which is well above the national average for law enforcement. Veterans encompass 12% of our workforce and minorities encompass 31% of our workforce. The Supreme Court Police believe that diversity and inclusion are essential to the departmentâ€™s success."
