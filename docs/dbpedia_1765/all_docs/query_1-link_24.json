        "text": "Searching Google Scholar\n\nHow do I search by author?\n\nUse the \"author:\" operator, e.g., author:\"d knuth\" or author:\"donald e knuth\".\n\nHow do I search by title?\n\nPut the paper's title in quotations: \"A History of the China Sea\".\n\nHow do I sort by date?\n\nYou'll often get better results if you search only recent articles, but still sort them by relevance, not by date. E.g., click \"Since 2018\" in the left sidebar of the search results page.\n\nTo see the absolutely newest articles first, click \"Sort by date\" in the sidebar. If you use this feature a lot, you may also find it useful to setup email alerts to have new results automatically sent to you.\n\nNote: On smaller screens that don't show the sidebar, these options are available in the dropdown menu labelled \"Year\" right below the search button.\n\nHow do I search for court opinions?\n\nSelect the \"Case law\" option on the homepage or in the side drawer on the search results page.\n\nWhat does the \"Related articles\" link do?\n\nIt finds documents similar to the given search result.\n\nWhere is advanced search?\n\nIt's in the side drawer. The advanced search window lets you search in the author, title, and publication fields, as well as limit your search results by date.\n\nHow do I search by specific jurisdictions?\n\nSelect the \"Case law\" option and do a keyword search over all jurisdictions. Then, click the \"Select courts\" link in the left sidebar on the search results page.\n\nTip: To quickly search a frequently used selection of courts, bookmark a search results page with the desired selection.\n\nAccess to articles\n\nFor each Scholar search result, we try to find a version of the article that you can read. These access links are labelled [PDF] or [HTML] and appear to the right of the search result. For example:\n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=example\n\nA paper that you need to read\n\nIn this fascinating paper, we investigate various topics that would be of interest to you. We also describe new methods relevant to your project, and attempt to address several questions which you would also like to know the answer to. Lastly, we analyze â¦\n\nCited by 35 Related articles All 6 versions\n\nAccess links cover a wide variety of ways in which articles may be available to you - articles that your library subscribes to, open access articles, free-to-read articles from publishers, preprints, articles in repositories, etc.\n\nWhen you are on a campus network, access links automatically include your library subscriptions and direct you to subscribed versions of articles. On-campus access links cover subscriptions from primary publishers as well as aggregators.\n\nOff-campus access\n\nOff-campus access links let you take your library subscriptions with you when you are at home or traveling. You can read subscribed articles when you are off-campus just as easily as when you are on-campus. Off-campus access links work by recording your subscriptions when you visit Scholar while on-campus, and looking up the recorded subscriptions later when you are off-campus.\n\nWe use the recorded subscriptions to provide you with the same subscribed access links as you see on campus. We also indicate your subscription access to participating publishers so that they can allow you to read the full-text of these articles without logging in or using a proxy. The recorded subscription information expires after 30 days and is automatically deleted.\n\nIn addition to Google Scholar search results, off-campus access links can also appear on articles from publishers participating in the off-campus subscription access program. Look for links labeled [PDF] or [HTML] on the right hand side of article pages.\n\nhttps://example.com/abstract/1\n\nA paper that you need to read\n\nAnne Author, John Doe, Jane Smith, Someone Else\n\nIn this fascinating paper, we investigate various topics that would be of interest to you. We also describe new methods relevant to your project, and attempt to address several questions which you would also like to know the answer to. Lastly, we analyze â¦\n\n[PDF] Help\n\nYou can disable off-campus access links on the Scholar settings page. Disabling off-campus access links will turn off recording of your library subscriptions. It will also turn off indicating subscription access to participating publishers. Once off-campus access links are disabled, you may need to identify and configure an alternate mechanism (e.g., an institutional proxy or VPN) to access your library subscriptions while off-campus.\n\nEmail Alerts\n\nHow do I sign up for email alerts?\n\nDo a search for the topic of interest, e.g., \"M Theory\"; click the envelope icon in the sidebar of the search results page; enter your email address, and click \"Create alert\". We'll then periodically email you newly published papers that match your search criteria.\n\nDo I need a Google account to receive email alerts?\n\nNo, you can enter any email address of your choice. If the email address isn't a Google account or doesn't match your Google account, then we'll email you a verification link, which you'll need to click to start receiving alerts.\n\nHow do I get notified when my papers are cited?\n\nThis works best if you create a public profile, which is free and quick to do. Once you get to the homepage with your photo, click \"Follow\" next to your name, select \"New citations to my articles\", and click \"Done\". We will then email you when we find new articles that cite yours.\n\nHow do I get notified when a particular paper is cited?\n\nSearch for the title of your paper, e.g., \"Anti de Sitter space and holography\"; click on the \"Cited by\" link at the bottom of the search result; and then click on the envelope icon in the left sidebar of the search results page.\n\nHow do I get notified of new papers published by my competitors, err, respected colleagues?\n\nFirst, do a search for your colleague's name, and see if they have a Scholar profile. If they do, click on it, click the \"Follow\" button next to their name, select \"New articles by this author\", and click \"Done\".\n\nIf they don't have a profile, do a search by author, e.g., [author:s-hawking], and click on the mighty envelope in the left sidebar of the search results page. If you find that several different people share the same name, you may need to add co-author names or topical keywords to limit results to the author you wish to follow.\n\nHow often do you send the alerts?\n\nWe send the alerts right after we add new papers to Google Scholar. This usually happens several times a week, except that our search robots meticulously observe holidays.\n\nHow do I unsubscribe?\n\nThere's a link to cancel the alert at the bottom of every notification email.\n\nHow do I change my alerts?\n\nIf you created alerts using a Google account, you can manage them all here. If you're not using a Google account, you'll need to unsubscribe from the individual alerts and subscribe to the new ones.\n\nGoogle Scholar library\n\nGoogle Scholar library is your personal collection of articles. You can save articles right off the search page, organize them by adding labels, and use the power of Scholar search to quickly find just the one you want - at any time and from anywhere. You decide what goes into your library, and weâll keep the links up to date.\n\nYou get all the goodies that come with Scholar search results - links to PDF and to your university's subscriptions, formatted citations, citing articles, and more!\n\nLibrary help\n\nHow do I add an article to my library?\n\nFind the article you want to add in Google Scholar and click the âSaveâ button under the search result.\n\nHow do I find an article in my library?\n\nClick âMy libraryâ at the top of the page or in the side drawer to view all articles in your library. To search the full text of these articles, enter your query as usual in the search box.\n\nHow do I remove an article from my library?\n\nFind the article you want to remove, and then click the âDeleteâ button under it.\n\nMy library is too big! Can I organize it?\n\nYou can use labels (for example: âartificial intelligenceâ) to categorize your articles.\n\nTo add a label to an article, find the article in your library, click the âLabelâ button under it, select the label you want to apply, and click âDoneâ.\n\nTo view all the articles with a specific label, click the label name in the left sidebar of your library page.\n\nTo remove a label from an article, click the âLabelâ button under it, deselect the label you want to remove, and click âDoneâ.\n\nTo add, edit, or delete labels, click âManage labelsâ in the left column of your library page.\n\nWho can see the articles in my library?\n\nOnly you can see the articles in your library. If you create a Scholar profile and make it public, then the articles in your public profile (and only those articles) will be visible to everyone.\n\nHow is my library related to my Scholar profile?\n\nYour profile contains all the articles you have written yourself. Itâs a way to present your work to others, as well as to keep track of citations to it.\n\nYour library is a way to organize the articles that youâd like to read or cite, not necessarily the ones youâve written.\n\nContent Coverage\n\nWhat do you include in Google Scholar?\n\nGoogle Scholar includes journal and conference papers, theses and dissertations, academic books, pre-prints, abstracts, technical reports and other scholarly literature from all broad areas of research. You'll find works from a wide variety of academic publishers, professional societies and university repositories, as well as scholarly articles available anywhere across the web. Google Scholar also includes court opinions and patents.\n\nDo you cover Pubmed? JSTOR? Elsevier?\n\nWe index research articles and abstracts from most major academic publishers and repositories worldwide, including both free and subscription sources. To check current coverage of a specific source in Google Scholar, search for a sample of their article titles in quotes.\n\nWhile we try to be comprehensive, it isn't possible to guarantee uninterrupted coverage of any particular source. We index articles from sources all over the web and link to these websites in our search results. If one of these websites becomes unavailable to our search robots or to a large number of web users, we have to remove it from Google Scholar until it becomes available again.\n\nHow complete is your coverage?\n\nOur meticulous search robots generally try to index every paper from every website they visit, including most major sources and also many lesser known ones.\n\nThat said, Google Scholar is primarily a search of academic papers. Shorter articles, such as book reviews, news sections, editorials, announcements and letters, may or may not be included. Untitled documents and documents without authors are usually not included. Website URLs that aren't available to our search robots or to the majority of web users are, obviously, not included either. Nor do we include websites that require you to sign up for an account, install a browser plugin, watch four colorful ads, and turn around three times and say coo-coo before you can read the listing of titles scanned at 10 DPI... You get the idea, we cover academic papers from sensible websites.\n\nHow come a search for [site:example.gov] returns far fewer results than I expect?\n\nThat's usually because we index many of these papers from other websites, such as the websites of their primary publishers. The \"site:\" operator currently only searches the primary version of each paper.\n\nIt could also be that the papers are located on examplejournals.gov, not on example.gov. Please make sure you're searching for the \"right\" website.\n\nThat said, the best way to check coverage of a specific source is to search for a sample of their papers using the title of the paper.\n\nWhich specific journals do you cover?\n\nAhem, we index papers, not journals. You should also ask about our coverage of universities, research groups, proteins, seminal breakthroughs, and other dimensions that are of interest to users. All such questions are best answered by searching for a statistical sample of papers that has the property of interest - journal, author, protein, etc. Many coverage comparisons are available if you search for [allintitle:\"google scholar\"], but some of them are more statistically valid than others.\n\nWhich court opinions do you include?\n\nCurrently, Google Scholar allows you to search and read published opinions of US state appellate and supreme court cases since 1950, US federal district, appellate, tax and bankruptcy courts since 1923 and US Supreme Court cases since 1791. In addition, it includes citations for cases cited by indexed opinions or journal articles which allows you to find influential cases (usually older or international) which are not yet online or publicly available.\n\nLegal opinions in Google Scholar are provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied on as a substitute for legal advice from a licensed lawyer. Google does not warrant that the information is complete or accurate.\n\nHow frequently do you update Google Scholar?\n\nWe normally add new papers several times a week. However, updates to existing records take 6-9 months to a year or longer, because in order to update our records, we need to first recrawl them from the source website. For many larger websites, the speed at which we can update their records is limited by the crawl rate that they allow.\n\nInclusion and Corrections\n\nThe description of my article is wrong and I am appropriately irritated. How do I correct it?\n\nWe apologize, and we assure you the error was unintentional. Automated extraction of information from articles in diverse fields can be tricky, so an error sometimes sneaks through.\n\nPlease write to the owner of the website where the erroneous search result is coming from, and encourage them to provide correct bibliographic data to us, as described in the technical guidelines. Once the data is corrected on their website, it usually takes 6-9 months to a year or longer for it to be updated in Google Scholar. We appreciate your help and your patience.\n\nHow do I add my papers to Google Scholar?\n\nIf you can't find your papers when you search for them by title and by author, please refer your publisher to our technical guidelines.\n\nYou can also deposit your papers into your institutional repository or put their PDF versions on your personal website, but please follow your publisher's requirements when you do so. See our technical guidelines for more details on the inclusion process.\n\nWe normally add new papers several times a week; however, it might take us some time to crawl larger websites, and corrections to already included papers can take 6-9 months to a year or longer.\n\nMy citation counts have gone down. Help!\n\nGoogle Scholar generally reflects the state of the web as it is currently visible to our search robots and to the majority of users. When you're searching for relevant papers to read, you wouldn't want it any other way!\n\nIf your citation counts have gone down, chances are that either your paper or papers that cite it have either disappeared from the web entirely, or have become unavailable to our search robots, or, perhaps, have been reformatted in a way that made it difficult for our automated software to identify their bibliographic data and references. If you wish to correct this, you'll need to identify the specific documents with indexing problems and ask your publisher to fix them. Please refer to the technical guidelines.\n\nI have noticed an error in a court opinion you are providing. What I can do to help fix it?\n\nPlease do let us know. Please include the URL for the opinion, the corrected information and a source where we can verify the correction.\n\nWe're only able to make corrections to court opinions that are hosted on our own website. For corrections to academic papers, books, dissertations and other third-party material, click on the search result in question and contact the owner of the website where the document came from. For corrections to books from Google Book Search, click on the book's title and locate the link to provide feedback at the bottom of the book's page."
