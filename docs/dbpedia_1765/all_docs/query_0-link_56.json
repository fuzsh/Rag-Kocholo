        "text": "BELGRADE -- Serbian police have removed protesters opposed to lithium mining from two railway stations in the capital, Belgrade, where they were blocking train traffic.\n\nRiot police used shields to disperse the protesters at the Prokop and Novi Beograd railway stations at around 5.30 a.m. on August 11, participants told RFE/RL.\n\nThe Internal Affairs Ministry said the railway traffic disrupted by the protests had been restored. The ministry warned that criminal charges will be brought against those who caused the traffic disruption and endangered public safety.\n\nOn August 10, tens of thousands of protesters rallied in the Belgrade city center and then split into two groups that separated and headed to the railway stations. Some of the protesters forced the trains to stop by lying or sitting on the tracks.\n\nThe protesters demanded a halt to Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto's lithium project in Jadar in western Serbia over fears it could pollute nearby land and water.\n\nProtesters who had spent the night of August 10-11 at the train stations also demanded that authorities release three demonstrators who had been detained by police.\n\nZlatko Kokanovic, one of the organizers of the protests, told RFE/RL the three activists were detained at the Prokop station.\n\n\"Ivan Bjelic, Nikola Ristic, and Jevdenije Dimitrijevic were arrested. They are accused of disobedience and reckless behavior,\" Kokanovic said.\n\nKokanovic on August 10 had vowed more rallies would take place in other cities across Serbia.\n\nInterior Minister Ivica Dacic insisted police had intervened without the use of coercive measures and no one was injured.\n\n\"A total of 14 persons have been brought on suspicion of having committed criminal offenses, three on misdemeanor [charges], and two foreign citizens because of their presence at the protest near important state institutions,\" Dacic said.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic said the protests were \"a mockery of democracy\" and added that stopping traffic at railway stations and roads was \"the implementation of violence, will, and terror of the minority against the majority.\"\n\nIn 2022, the Serbian government had rejected the project in the wake of massive public protests amid concerns over its impact on the environment.\n\nBut it reinstated the plan on July 16 this year, days after the Balkan state's Constitutional Court said the government had acted unconstitutionally when it withdrew permits for Rio Tinto.\n\nThree days after the court ruling, a Critical Raw Materials Summit was held in Belgrade, where a memorandum of understanding between the European Union and the Serbian government on a \"strategic partnership\" on sustainable raw materials, battery supply chains, and electric vehicles was signed.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the mining of lithium, a key component in batteries for electric vehicles and mobile devices, is necessary for Europe \"to remain sovereign in a changing world and not be dependent on others.\"\n\nScholz pledged that mining would be carried out \"in compliance with the highest standards of environmental protection, and Germany will help in this.\"\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nKYIV -- Russian forces launched missile attacks overnight on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, killing at least two people, Ukrainian authorities said on August 11.\n\nThe State Emergency Service said that a 35-year-old man and his 4-year-old son were found dead in the rubble of a building during search-and-rescue operations. Three others, including a 13-year-old child, were seriously wounded in the attack, it added.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Kyiv's military administration said the city's air-defense systems had been activated.\n\nFive other regions were being attacked by Russian drones, according to Ukraine's air force.\n\nCities across Ukraine have been regularly hit by Russian air strikes from missiles and drones. There has been growing concern among many Ukrainians in recent days that Moscow might intensify its air raids in response to Kyiv's recent incursion into Russian territory in the border region of Kursk.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly urged its Western allies to provide it with more air-defense system.\n\nIn Russia, Kursk regional Governor Aleksei Smirnov said 13 people had been injured by debris from a downed Ukrainian missile that fell on a residential building during the night. Two of the injured were in serious condition, Smirnov said on August 11.\n\nResidents of the nine-story building were to be evacuated to temporary accommodations, according to Igor Kutsak, mayor of the regional capital, Kursk city.\n\nThe whole city was under an air-raid alert, the official said on Telegram. He posted a photo that showed an apartment building with blown out windows and damaged balconies.\n\nIn the neighboring Voronezh region, Russian authorities claimed that debris from a downed Ukraine-launched drone damaged an administrative building and a utility facility in the provincial capital of the same name. There were no injuries, they added.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said on August 11 that its air-defense units destroyed 16 Ukrainian-lunched drones over the Voronezh region, while 14 drones and four Tochka-U tactical ballistic missiles were downed over the Kursk region.\n\nThree drones were downed over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, and one drone each was destroyed over the Bryansk and Orlov regions, the ministry said on Telegram.\n\nThe claims cannot be independently verified.\n\nUkraine’s surprise cross-border incursion in Kursk on August 6 has been described as the biggest attack on Russian soil since Moscow launched its unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:22 0:00\n\nRussia on August 10 announced that it had imposed what it called anti-terror measures in the Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod regions.\n\nThe National Anti-Terrorism Committee said in a statement that the measures included the possible evacuation of residents, limits on transport, beefed-up security around sensitive sites, and wire taps.\n\nMore than 76,000 people have been evacuated from border areas in the Kursk region in recent days, according to Russian media reports.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and AP\n\nBelarusian journalist and political activist Andrey Hnyot, who is under house arrest in Belgrade awaiting a final decision on his extradition to Belarus, has been removed from the Interpol wanted list.\n\nThe international police agency's warrant for Hnyot’s arrest was issued at the request of Belarus, which accuses him of tax evasion. Hnyot has denied Minsk's accusations and called them politically motivated.\n\n\"Andrey Hnyot is no longer the subject of Interpol's notification,\" according to a decision of the General Secretariat of Interpol. The decision was forwarded to the media on August 10 by his lawyer, Vadim Drozdov.\n\nHnyot said in a statement to RFE/RL that Interpol informed representatives of the European Union in Serbia that the warrant \"was suspended and the data deleted due to the violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the Interpol Statute.\"\n\nHe said that those provisions refer to politically motivated criminal prosecution.\n\n\"As far as I know, representatives of the EU brought this important information to the attention of the government of Serbia and the judiciary. However, this did not result in my release,\" said Hnyot.\n\nHnyot pointed out that the process of his extradition is ongoing and he is under house arrest until the final decision.\n\n\"That will be my only and last chance to challenge the illegality of my extradition,\" he said, adding that he has not been able to receive adequate medical care and has no source of income to pay rent or buy food and medicine.\n\nHnyot was arrested in October 2023 at the Belgrade airport after arriving from Thailand, where he was in exile.\n\nHe spent seven months in Belgrade Central Prison before being transferred to house arrest on June 5.\n\nThe High Court in Belgrade on June 13 issued a ruling on the extradition that would send him back to Belarus, but it is not yet final.\n\nDrozdov said that Interpol responded to his request to delete Hnyot from its information system with a decision made on August 5.\n\n\"This means that no country will be able to detain him at the request of Belarus,\" said Drozdov in a statement.\n\nHnyot fled Belarus for Thailand in 2020 after criticizing the regime and participating in massive protests that occurred after the presidential election in which authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka declared victory.\n\nWestern countries do not recognize the results of those elections, and after violence against demonstrators, the European Union imposed sanctions on Minsk.\n\nBrussels called for Hnyot’s release on June 13 a blistering warning for authorities in EU candidate Serbia, and several media and nongovernmental organizations did the same.\n\nHnyot 's lawyer has informed the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg about the case.\n\nAccording to his statements, the court sent a letter to the authorities in Serbia that it expects that Hnyot will not be immediately extradited after a final decision by the High Court, allowing time for him to address the European Court.\n\nHnyot currently wears an ankle-bracelet monitor and is confinement to a modest, 20-square-meter apartment in Belgrade.\n\nThe prospect of a forced return to a regime that Hnyot describes as \"torture, blood, nightmare\" is motivating.\n\nHe told RFE/RL’s Balkan Service in mid-June in his first interview after his transfer to house arrest that he works \"from morning to night\" on his defense.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has voided the inquiry that led to an Olympic bronze medal for American gymnast Jordan Chiles in the women’s floor exercise.\n\nThe ruling by the CAS on August 10 said the inquiry filed on behalf of Chiles after the final in the event on August 5 came outside the 1-minute time limit allowed by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG).\n\nChiles was awarded the bronze medal after her inquiry was filed, but the CAS agreed with an appeal filed by the Romanian Gymnastics Federation on behalf of gymnasts Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, who were bumped into fourth and fifth place, respectively, by the judge's decision.\n\n\"The inquiry submitted on behalf of…Chiles in the Final of the women’s Floor exercise was raised after the conclusion of the one-minute deadline…and is determined to be without effect,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt also said the initial score given to Chiles, which initially put her in fifth place, \"shall be reinstated.\"\n\nThe CAS said the final ranking was up to the FIG but said it should “assign the medal(s) in accordance with the above decision.”\n\nThe decision means Barbosu, 18, will receive her country's only medal in the gymnastics competition.\n\n\"I can barely express my emotions. I can't believe it,\" Barbosu told Romanian media. \"When I heard the news, I was afraid it wasn't true, and once I was sure, I hugged my parents and called everyone who had helped me.\"\n\nIt has been an emotional roller coaster for Barbosu, who thought she won bronze on the night of the competition and began celebrating only to leave the floor in tears with Maneca-Voinea after the revision of the scores.\n\nChiles initially was given a score of 13.666 that put her in fifth place behind Maneca-Voinea. U.S. coach Cecile Landi called for an inquiry, and after a review, judges boosted Chiles’s total by 0.1. That was enough to leapfrog Barbosu and Maneca-Voinea for bronze.\n\nThe Romanian Gymnastics Federation welcomed the decision and congratulated its two gymnasts.\n\n\"We laugh with one eye, we cry with one,\" it said on Facebook. \"Following this decision, Ana Maria Barbosu gets the bronze medal while Sabrina Maneca-Voinea ends the competition on the 4th place.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics said in a statement it is “devastated” by the ruling.\n\n\"The inquiry into the Difficulty Value of Jordan Chiles' floor exercise routine was filed in good faith and, we believed, in accordance with FIG rules to ensure accurate scoring,\" the organization said.\n\nDuring his entire imprisonment in Russia, Andrei Pivovarov yearned for one thing: freedom.\n\n\"To be released. You always count the days, hours, months. The only [desire] is to break free. Any person, politically oriented or not, sitting in prison, wants to be free,\" Pivovarov told Current Time.\n\nPivovarov, 42, was part of the biggest prisoner exchange between the West and Russia since the Cold War.\n\nIn the exchange on August 1, Russia got back eight prisoners held in the West, including a member of its FSB security service convicted of murder in Germany, and 16 people were released from Russian and Belarusian jails. They included Pivovarov, dissidents Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin, and U.S. citizens Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan, and RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva.\n\nPivovarov, the former executive director of the now-defunct pro-democracy Open Russia movement, was detained in May 2021 after being taken off a Warsaw-bound plane just before takeoff from St. Petersburg and sentenced to four years in prison in July 2022 on a charge of heading an \"undesirable organization.\"\n\nThe \"undesirable organization\" law, adopted in 2015, was part of a series of regulations pushed by the Kremlin that squeezed many nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations that received funding from foreign sources, mainly from Europe and the United States.\n\nAfter his trial in Krasnodar, the St. Petersburg native was convicted and sentenced in July 2022, when Russia's full-scale war and Russian President Vladimir Putin's intensified crackdown on dissent were in full swing.\n\nFrom January 2023, Pivovarov was held in isolation at Penal Colony No. 7 in Russia's Karelia region.\n\nSince his release and transfer to Germany, Pivovarov has given numerous interviews but is hoping to find time now to rest and spend time with his family.\n\n\"I would like to exhale. Plus, during all this time I was deprived of the opportunity to communicate with my son, so I would really like to meet him, spend time with him,\" Pivovarov told Current Time, adding he has no plans to abandon his \"political work.\"\n\nPivovarov admitted that voicing opposition to Putin's regime is easier from abroad but with possible drawbacks.\n\n\"When you are in Russia, any unification, any coordination is automatically a criminal offense. At the same time, having a platform abroad, where we are now, on the one hand, to be honest, diminishes the weight of our words, because it is easy to say something while sitting outside in the sun and knowing that no policeman is coming for you,\" Pivovarov explained. \"On the other hand, this allows us to say more than what people in Russia can afford.\"\n\nBreathing life into Russia's opposition, largely silenced by Putin's repression and infighting, will be a formidable task, admitted Pivovarov, saying the goal should be \"not to unite but to establish a dialogue, contact.\"\n\n\"Of course, there will still be disputes,\" he said.\n\nPivovarov was also asked about comments he made at a Bonn press conference on August 2, when he appeared to suggest that Western sanctions against Russia were unfairly impacting ordinary Russians, triggering some criticism, especially among Ukrainians.\n\n\"There was no phrase about the unfairness of sanctions. I don't remember all the words verbatim, but there was no phrase about the unfairness of sanctions. Sanctions are effective, and they work. I'm talking about, for example, a housewife -- a stupid example -- but it seems typical to me. And she has, let's say, a small child, and she cooks at home. So that she has the opportunity to buy at least some more or less normal products, so that her small everyday world becomes a little simpler,\" Pivovarov offered.\n\nPivovarov said Russian opponents of Putin shared common goals with Ukrainians.\n\n\"Our goals are the same. We want to work together to ensure that the war ends, that the regime in Russia changes, and that, ultimately, Putin ends up in the dock. This is our main goal,\" he said. \"We just look at this from the perspective of Russian society, and in this regard we can be more useful.\"\n\nRussia has imposed what it called anti-terror measures in Kursk, the site of a Ukrainian military incursion, and two nearby regions as well as Bryansk and Belgorod.\n\nThe announcement was made early on August 10 by the National Anti-Terrorism Committee. In a statement, it said the decision had been made by Aleksandr Bortnikov, head of the FSB intelligence service, in response to Ukraine's \"unprecedented attempt to destabilize the situation in a series of regions.\"\n\nThe committee said the measures included the possible evacuation of residents, limits on transport, beefed-up security around sensitive sites, and wire taps.\n\nRussian media reported on August 10 that more than 76,000 people have been evacuated from border areas in the Kursk region since Ukraine launched the surprise cross-border offensive on August 6. TASS quoted Artem Sharov, an official from the regional Emergencies Ministry, as saying that those evacuated \"have been temporarily relocated to safe places.\"\n\nDozens of temporary accommodation facilities have been set up in Kursk and other regions, Sharov told journalists, according to TASS.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said on August 10 that fighting was continuing region and that the army has conducted air strikes against Ukrainian forces.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Ukraine proves that it really knows how to restore justice and guarantees exactly the kind of pressure that is needed: pressure on the aggressor,\" Zelenskiy said without explicitly referring to the situation in the Kursk.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:22 0:00\n\nUkrainian soldiers appeared in a video late on August 9 showing a Ukrainian flag against the backdrop of a Gazprom facility in Sudzha, about 10 kilometers from the border.

The strategic object of Gazprom in Sudzha is controlled by the 99th Mechanized Battalion,\" the fighters say in the video, which could not be immediately verified.\n\nSudzha Mayor Vitaly Slashchev denied the claim in a comment to TASS but said an evacuation of the city was under way.\n\nA Ukrainian member of parliament who spoke with RFE/RL on August 9 said the Ukrainian military was \"advancing and making an impression on the enemy\" and inflicting damage on Russian forces in the Kursk region.\n\n\"And the most important thing is that they are advancing quite professionally,\" lawmaker Roman Kostenko said, adding that they had managed to surprise the enemy at a place where the Russian forces were the weakest.\n\nEarlier on August 9 the Ukrainian military said it had hit the airfield in Russia's southern Lipetsk region overnight, damaging guided-bomb stockpiles.\n\n\"Several sources of ignition were recorded, a large fire broke out and multiple detonations were observed,\" Kyiv's military said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nIt said Russian Su-34, Su-35 and MiG-31 aircraft were based at the airfield.\n\nSatellite images made available to RFE/RL by Planet Labs show the consequences of Ukrainian strikes on the Lipetsk airfield. The unverified images show completely destroyed buildings and evidence of a large fire.

Video circulating on social media showed what appeared to be many burned-out military transport vehicles on the side of a road in or near the town of Rylsk.\n\nTwo ethnic Armenians in Kursk who spoke with RFE/RL's Armenian Service by phone said the Russian authorities had banned large gatherings and mass events in the region through August 11.\n\n\"It can be said that we are at war now,\" said one of the men, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nHe said Ukrainian troops had captured two towns that are 60 to 70 kilometers away from the city of Kursk in addition to the Gazprom facility.\n\nJailed Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi and other women inmates in Tehran's Evin prison were injured earlier this week in clashes that erupted after a spate of executions, Mohammadi’s family says.\n\nMohammadi’s husband, Taghi Rahmani, said Mohammadi suffered breathing problems and severe chest pain after being punched in the chest and was transferred to the prison's clinic.\n\nRahmani, who spoke by phone to RFE/RL from Paris, said several women came under attack by guards during the clashes on August 6. Mohammadi was hit in her chest, and her arm was bruised, he said.\n\nThe injured women were later taken to the prison clinic for treatment and were returned to their ward.\n\nRahmani said the news agency of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps claimed the clash was a riot, but he said it should be made clear that it was a protest in which the women in Evin prison chanted in the prison yard against the death penalty.\n\nHe added that he and the rest of Mohammadi’s family were worried about her health especially because she was hit in the chest. Mohammadi had surgery for blocked arteries in 2022.\n\nRahmani added that Mohammadi, who is renowned as a staunch advocate for the Women, Life, Freedom movement, cannot contact her sister in Iran and she hasn’t been allowed to contact her children for 2 1/2 years. She also has had no contact with her lawyer.\n\n\"These restrictions make all of us worried about her situation in that ward where other women are also facing difficult conditions,\" Rahmani told RFE/RL.\n\nBefore Rahmani spoke with RFE/RL, Mohammadi's family issued a statement about the clash on August 8. It said several women who stood in front of the security forces were severely beaten.\n\nIt said the women in Evin prison had been actively protesting against executions in Iran, and following the execution of Reza Rasaei, several prisoners gathered in the prison yard to voice their dissent, chanting slogans against the death penalty.\n\nOne woman suffered a nervous breakdown and passed out and another prisoner also fainted from the emotional strain, the statement said, adding that Mohammadi and several other prisoners protested against the locked doors that were preventing the critically ill inmates from being taken to the prison clinic.\n\nIranian authorities acknowledged a confrontation took place on August 6 but blamed Mohammadi for a \"provocation\" and denied any of the prisoners had been beaten.\n\nTwo prisoners \"had heart palpitations due to the stress,\" but medical examinations determined that their general condition \"is favorable,\" Iran's prison administration said in a statement, according to the Tasnim news agency.\n\nMohammadi, 52, has been campaigning for human rights in Iran for decades and has been in and out of prison for the last 20 years. She has been convicted five times since March 2021 and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for \"spreading propaganda\" against the Islamic republic.\n\nThe executions that took place this week drew outrage from rights groups. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights group said 29 people were executed at two prisons in the Tehran satellite city of Karaj on August 7 alone.\n\nRasaei, 34, was the 10th man executed by Iran in connection with the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" protests that erupted after the death of a woman in police custody. The Iranian judiciary said Rasaei was executed on August 6.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nThe United States and Britain unveiled new sanctions against Belarus on August 9 to mark the fourth anniversary of the country's disputed presidential election that returned authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka to power.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 19 people and 14 companies involved in supporting Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine by producing resources used by the military, shipping goods to Russia, evading sanctions, and generating revenue for Belarusian oligarchs in Lukashenka’s inner circle.\n\nIt also took aim at Lukashenka’s “luxury airliner,” a Boeing-767-300 owned by the Belarusian government that the Treasury Department said he uses “professionally and for his personal leisure.”\n\nPaval Latushka, head of the People's Anti-Crisis Directorate, said the sanctions meant the plane is barred from maintenance by authorized Boeing service providers, and this will create problems if it tries to land at airports outside Belarus.\n\nBradley Smith, the Treasury Department’s acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement that the sanctions were in response to the regime's \"blatantly corrupt, destabilizing, and anti-democratic acts -- along with its continued support for Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe U.S. designations followed fresh sanctions announced earlier on August 9 by Britain against four individuals and three businesses \"in response to human rights violations and ongoing facilitation of Russia's illegal invasion in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Foreign Office noted that it issued the sanctions on the anniversary of \"the deeply flawed 2020 presidential elections in Belarus.\" It also noted that the action was taken in coordination with international partners and took the total number of sanctions imposed by Britain against Belarus to more than 200.\n\nAll four people sanctioned by Britain are present or former commanding officers of Belarusian prisons. The businesses sanctioned are involved in the country's defense and military sector.\n\nThe European Union targeted Belarusian authorities involved in human rights abuses earlier this week, and Canada on August 9 also announced additional sanctions on the Lukashenka regime.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said that since the 2020 election, Lukashenka’s actions “have eroded Belarusian civil society and enabled Lukashenka, his family, and his inner circle to enrich themselves at the expense of Belarus’s citizens and sovereignty.”\n\nIt said the regime continues to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by hosting Russian military bases and allowing Russian forces to use Belarus as a staging point for military operations, the department said.\n\nAmong the 14 entities designated by the U.S. is Laboratory of Additive Technologies, which the department said provides Russia with components for satellite communications systems and optical equipment.\n\nThree other entities -- AlYurTekh, Diskoms, MOT, Grosver Grup, and Tochnaya Mekhanika -- were hit with sanctions for supporting what Washington said was a sanctions-evasion network supported by Peleng JSC, one of Russia’s most important industrial partners. Peleng was designated by for U.S. sanctions in December 2021.\n\nAmong the other entities are Aviakompania Rada and UE RubiStar, which the Treasury Department said are two private Belarusian cargo airline companies that have provided support to Russian defense activities, including transporting Wagner Group personnel to and from Africa.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any U.S.-based assets owned or controlled by the individuals and organizations. They also block financial transactions with those designated and prohibit the contribution of funds, goods, and services to them.\n\nThe U.S. State Department also took steps to impose visa restrictions on 19 regime officials and their affiliates for their involvement in undermining democracy in Belarus, the Treasury Department said.\n\nRussia declared what it described as a \"federal-level\" emergency on August 9 in the Kursk region, the site of a four-day incursion by Ukrainian forces. The announcement came hours after a Ukrainian military strike on an airfield there.\n\nIn response to the incursion, the Russian Defense Ministry said on August 9 that it was transferring extra forces to the region, including Grad multiple-launch rocket systems, artillery, and tanks, Interfax reported.\n\nState-run media reported on troops and armor being redeployed to Kursk, including video of Russian military on the move, much of it reposted on social media.\n\nThe cross-border action in Russia's Kursk region has been described as the biggest attack on Russian soil since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his country's unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nWATCH: Scenes of destruction in Russia's Kursk region continue to be shared online following a surprise cross-border incursion.

He later added that a local power installation had been damaged and six people had been wounded.\n\nArtamonov first urged residents to ignore calls on social media to evacuate, saying they were being “spread by the enemy in order to sow panic.” Hours later, he said a state of emergency had been declared in the Lipetsk district and that four outlying settlements of Lipetsk city had been ordered to evacuate.\n\nSatellite images made available to RFE/RL by Planet Labs show the consequences of Ukrainian strikes on the Lipetsk airfield.

Air-raid alerts are issued every half-hour. But we are kind of used to it, given what has been going on for the past year or two.
