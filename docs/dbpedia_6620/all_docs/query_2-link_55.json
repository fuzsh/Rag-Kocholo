        "text": "Although populism is one of the trendiest research topics in contemporary literature, populist parties are still largely analysed through approaches that treat them, almost a priori, as ‘challengers’ or ‘outsiders’. Indeed, while excellent analyses of various aspects of the populist phenomenon abound (e.g. Albertazzi and McDonnell Reference Albertazzi and McDonnell2015; Akkerman et al. Reference Akkerman, de Lange and Rooduijn2016; Eatwell and Goodwin Reference Eatwell and Goodwin2018; Hawkins et al. Reference Hawkins, Carlin, Littvay and Rovira Kaltwasser2019; Kriesi Reference Kriesi2014; Moffitt Reference Moffitt2016; Mudde Reference Mudde2007; Norris and Inglehart Reference Norris and Inglehart2019; Pappas Reference Pappas2019; Rooduijn Reference Rooduijn2019; Rovira Kaltwasser et al. Reference Rovira Kaltwasser, Taggart, Ochoa Espejo and Ostiguy2017; van Kessel Reference van Kessel2015), the literature seems not to have sufficiently theorized or empirically investigated a decisive development: the fact that an increasing number of populist parties are no longer at the margins of party systems; they are instead – as never before – integrated into their national political systems.\n\nIn this contribution, I shall respond to the recent call for a ‘paradigmatic shift’ in the study of populist parties (Mudde Reference Mudde2016: 16) and push the agenda forward by complementing the ideational approach with an analysis of the different interaction streams characterizing such actors. First, this review article provides an overview of 66 contemporary populist parties by adopting a wide-ranging pan-European perspective covering EU member states and micro-states, as well as extra-EU countries. In order to capture the salient ideational varieties of populist parties, subtypes within the general categories of right-wing and left-wing are identified, and the new category of ‘valence populism’ is introduced. Next, the limitations of the common approaches to the study of the role of populist parties in party systems, such as ‘anti-establishment’, ‘challenger’ and ‘outsider parties’, are discussed. Subsequently, building upon and expanding my previous works on the topic (Zulianello Reference Zulianello2018, Reference Zulianello2019a, Reference Zulianello2019b), the 66 populist parties under analysis are classified according to their different interactive patterns, and the key differences between non-integration, negative integration and positive integration are discussed. Finally, a brief summary is provided.\n\nConclusion and discussion\n\nIn this contribution, I have taken a different approach to the study of the party politics of populism, by complementing the ideational approach to populism with the analysis of party interaction streams at the systemic level, and applied it on empirical grounds by adopting a broad pan-European perspective to 66 parties in 33 countries. First, from an ideational point of view, I argued that a more nuanced analysis of populist parties in contemporary party systems requires not only distinguishing between (subtypes) of left- and right-wing populism, but also introducing the separate category of valence populists to analyse actors such as the Italian M5S or the Croatian ZZ, which predominantly engage in non-positional competition and subscribe to an unadulterated version of populism. Second, from a party system perspective, I have stressed that scholars should avoid using labels such as anti-establishment, challenger or outsider parties with the expectation of automatically referring to the universe of populist actors. While the term ‘anti-establishment’ captures a decisive element of the ideational profile of populist parties, its usage is unwarranted if the goal is to understand the different roles played by such actors in contemporary party systems. Indeed, the anti-establishment ideology is frequently disjointed from anti-establishment behaviour, as indicated by the increasing integration of populist parties into the coalition game and the governmental arena. This observation applies equally to existing approaches that seek to distinguish between challenger-outsider or insider-outsider political parties, as populist actors may well present mixed features that are not captured appropriately by such categories.\n\nIn light of these considerations, I have followed a different line, arguing that a minority of contemporary populist parties are at the margins of their national party systems, as many of them are indeed integrated in very visible cooperative interactions at the systemic level. Furthermore, I have suggested that it is necessary not only to assess whether a populist party presents the property of systemic integration, but also to distinguish between two very different patterns: negative and positive integration. In fully fledged liberal-democratic contexts, the integration of populist parties is by default of a ‘negative’ type, given that their ideational profile is at odds with both the values of pluralism and the constitutional checks and balances characterizing these regimes. However, in hybrid or fully authoritarian contexts, populist parties may well be ‘positively’ integrated into the system, meaning that they share its underlying values, as shown by the cases of Hungary, Russia and Serbia."
