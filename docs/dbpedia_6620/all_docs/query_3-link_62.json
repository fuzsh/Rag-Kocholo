        "text": "In the spirit of the Stockholm Declaration that states: “With humanity still scarred by …antisemitism and xenophobia the international community shares a solemn responsibility to fight those evils” the committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial called the IHRA Plenary in Budapest 2015 to adopt the following working definition of antisemitism.\n\nOn 26 May 2016, the Plenary in Bucharest decided to:\n\nAdopt the following non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism:\n\n“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”\n\nTo guide IHRA in its work, the following examples may serve as illustrations:\n\nManifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.\n\nContemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:\n\nCalling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.\n\nMaking mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.\n\nAccusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.\n\nDenying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).\n\nAccusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.\n\nAccusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.\n\nDenying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.\n\nApplying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.\n\nUsing the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.\n\nDrawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.\n\nHolding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\n\nAntisemitic acts are criminal when they are so defined by law (for example, denial of the Holocaust or distribution of antisemitic materials in some countries).\n\nCriminal acts are antisemitic when the targets of attacks, whether they are people or property – such as buildings, schools, places of worship and cemeteries – are selected because they are, or are perceived to be, Jewish or linked to Jews."
