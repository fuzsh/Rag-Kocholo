        "text": "Located at the point where the Alps open out onto the Pannonian plains, on the right bank of the river Danube, Vienna is today a major industrial and commercial crossroads. Traditionally the center of power of the German Holy Roman Empire and of the Habsburgs, Vienna is brimming with architectural features from\n\nthe medieval period (including the gothic cathedral of Saint Stephen), long promenades running past palaces and baroque, neogothic or neoclassical buildings (the Opera, the Parliament, the City Hall, the Art History Museum and the Burgtheater). As a meeting point of the Latin, Germanic, Magyar and Slavic cultures, Vienna developed very early on a cultural vibrancy that is entirely its own. As the town of some of the world’s greatest thinkers and writers (including Freud, Wittgenstein or Zweig) or composers (Mozart, Strauss), the city remains synonymous with these great individuals, even today.\n\nSaint Stephan’s Cathedral © ANTO/ Mayer\n\nThree quarters of the Austrian landscape is covered with mountains, and skiing is an integral part of Austrian culture. More than just a sport, skiing is a way of life here. The Austrian Alps cover approximately\n\n60% of the surface area of the country. Thanks to its favourable climatic conditions, there are more than a thousand winter sports resorts dotted throughout the country, with some 22 000 km of Alpine ski slopes and 16 000 km of cross country slopes. In summer as well as in winter, it offers some of Europe’s finest ski slopes and the best hiking trails. Beginners or experts alike never fail to be impressed by everything that Austria has to offer. This snowy wonderland has enabled Austria to produce many great champions such as Toni Sailer, Karl Schranz, Annemarie Moser-Pröll, Franz as the “Herminator” or Benjamin Raich.\n\n© ANTO/ Mayer"
