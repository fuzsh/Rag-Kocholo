        "text": "Trump and Harris agreed to debate in September\n\nDonald Trump suggested that he was eager to face off with Vice President Kamala Harris yesterday during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, and he proposed three dates for debates. The ABC network confirmed that it would host the two candidates for a debate on Sept. 10.\n\nThe conference was the former president’s first public appearance since Harris became the Democratic nominee, and it signified an effort to recapture political momentum. His points were familiar: that Harris was weak on the issues of crime and protecting the U.S. border with Mexico, and he described her as “a radical left person” who was “very, very bad to Israel and very bad to Jewish people.”\n\nTrump also took personal shots, saying that Harris wasn’t “smart enough” to do a news conference and repeatedly mispronouncing her first name."
