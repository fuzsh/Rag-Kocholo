        "text": "The collapse of the coalition government in July 2008 triggered early elections to the 183-member National Council in September, nearly 25 months before they were due.\n\nFollowing the previous elections in October 2006, three months of negotiations resulted in a grand coalition between the Social Democratic Party (SPÃ, 68 seats) and the People's Party (ÃVP, 66 seats). SPÃ leader, Mr. Alfred Gusenbauer, was sworn in as Prime Minister in January 2007. However, the coalition government remained fragile due to its different political views, in particular regarding health, taxes, pensions and education.\n\nThe country of 8.2 million inhabitants had enjoyed high economic growth (3.4 per cent in 2007) and a low unemployment rate of 4 per cent. Inflation and high fuel prices reportedly disrupted the country's economy prior to the 2008 elections. In June, Prime Minister Gusenbauer announced that he would step down as SPÃ leader. On 7 July, ÃVP leader, Mr. Wilhelm Molterer, announced that his party would withdraw from the coalition government. The two parties had been in disagreement over tax reform as well as a SPÃ proposal to offset inflation. Mr. Molterer criticized the SPÃ for being \"without orientation or leadership\". On 9 July, the National Council voted unanimously to dissolve itself with a view to holding elections. The Government, in consultation with the Main Committee of the National Council, set the election date for 28 September.\n\nFollowing a reform of the electoral law in 2007, the voting age was lowered from 18 to 16 years, and people over 18 years of age (instead of 19) became eligible to run for elections to the National Council. In the same vein, the term of the National Council was extended from four to five years starting from the new legislature.\n\nAs many as 15 parties fielded candidates in the 2008 elections. Transport Minister, Mr. Werner Faymann, led the SPÃ which repeated its long-standing policy of making the last year of kindergarten compulsory and free of charge. The ÃVP, which had opposed that policy in the outgoing legislature, announced that it would support the SPÃ's plan. The pre-election polls suggested that neither the SPÃ nor the ÃVP would obtain a majority in the new National Council.\n\nTwo far-right parties featured prominently during the election campaign. The Freedom Party (FPÃ, which took 21 seats in the 2006 elections) of Mr. Heinz-Christian Strache and the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÃ), formed in April 2005 by former FPÃ leader Mr. JÃ¶rg Haider, both campaigned to end immigration and called for the expulsion of foreigners and asylum-seekers who committed crimes. During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Strache criticized the outgoing coalition government, calling its members \"traitors of the people\". Mr. Haider promised to fight off the \"catastrophe of inflation\" and provide rent subsidies and free kindergarten.\n\nThe ÃVP promised to fight abuses of asylum rules. The Greens of Mr. Alexander Van der Bellen proposed that all children born to parents who were legal residents in Austria should be granted Austrian citizenship.\n\nThe media focused on discussion about a post-election coalition. SPÃ leader Faymann firmly rejected the possibility of forming a coalition government with either of the far-right parties. He said he preferred another coalition with the ÃVP, arguing that a broad consensus would be needed to tackle the economic downturn, health care and educational reform. ÃVP leader Molterer did not explicitly rule out the possibility of a coalition with the far-right parties. The Greens were open to coalition with the SPÃ or the ÃVP but dismissed any possibility of a coalition with the FPÃ and the BZÃ.\n\nA total of 78.81 per cent of the 6.3 million registered voters turned out at the polls.\n\nBoth the SPÃ and the ÃVP recorded their worst results since World War II. They won 57 and 51 seats respectively. On the contrary, the FPÃ and the BZÃ increased their strength to 34 and 21 seats respectively. The Greens took the remaining 20 seats. In all 50 women were elected.\n\nOn 8 October, President Heinz Fischer (SPÃ) asked Mr. Faymann (SPÃ) to form a new government.\n\nThe newly elected National Council held its first session on 28 October and re-elected Ms. Barbara Prammer (SPÃ) as its Speaker.\n\nOn 2 December, Mr. Faymann's government comprising the SPÃ and the ÃVP was sworn in by President Fischer."
