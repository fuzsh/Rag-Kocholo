Austria was a major imperial power in Central Europe for centuries in various state guises, until the fall of its Habsburg dynasty after World War One.

But its position at the geographical heart of Europe, and its neutral status during the Cold War between Nato and the Soviet bloc, maintained the much-reduced country's strategic significance.

Austria is now a member of the European Union, though not Nato, and an enduring legacy of its decades of post-war neutrality can be seen in the large number of international organisations that call its capital Vienna their home.

These include the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and Opec, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

For much of the post-war period, so-called "grand coalition" governments of left and right wing parties have ruled Austria, although the Social Democrats led by Bruno Kreisky ruled alone in the 1970s.

More recently, the centre-right People's Party ruled in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party, but this coalition collapsed in May 2019 after a scandal involving the leader of the Freedom Party.
