        "text": "Filmmakers\n\nMARCEL CARNÉ\n\nMarcel Carné was born in Paris in 1909. He learned to make films as an assistant to several important directors of the 1920s and 30s, Jacques Feyder and René Clair notably. He was likewise a film critic for two major journals, Cinémagazine and Cinémonde, before launching his own career as a filmmaker. His first feature film, Jenny (1936), is the beginning of a famous collaboration with the poet-screenwriter Jacques Prévert. Their work together will produce a half-dozen films, including three indisputable masterpieces, Port of Shadows (1938), Daybreak (1939), and Children of Paradise (1943-45)."
