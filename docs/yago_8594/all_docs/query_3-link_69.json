Photo: Collection Cinémathèque Suisse, Lausanne/Cormiglion-Molinier. <b>Louis Jouvet </b> in <i>Drôle de drame/Bizarre, Bizarre</i> (Marcel Carné, 1937).\n\t\n\t<b>Marcel Carné</b> (1906-1996) was with his poetic realism style one of the great directors of pre-war French cinema. He created such masterpieces as <i>Hôtel du Nord</i> (1938),  <i>Le quai des brumes/Port of Shadows </i> (1938) and <i>Le jour se lève/Daybreak</i> (1939), together with writer Jacques Prévert, decorator Alexandre Trauner, composer Maurice Jaubert and actor Jean Gabin. During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany he directed <i>Les enfants du paradis</i> (1945), an anti-Nazi parable and an all-time classic.\n\t\n\tMarcel Carné was born in Paris, France, in 1906. He was the son of Marcelin Paul Carné, a cabinet maker, and Véronique Marie Françoise Racouët. His mother died when he was five years old, and Marcel was brought up by his grandmother and an aunt. He was soon drawn to the cinema: every Thursday he went to a film screening, and then more and more often. After attending an arts and crafts school and completing his military service, he first worked as an insurance agent. He secretly took evening classes in photography at the Ecole des Arts et Métiers, graduating as a photography technician. Carné entered the film industry in the silent era as a camera technician. He also began writing film reviews for Parisian magazines like Cinémagazine and Cinémonde. After a meeting with actress Françoise Rosay, Carné was hired as a secondary assistant director on her husband Jacques Feyder's new film, Les Nouveaux Messieurs (Jacques Feyder, 1928). Feyder became his artistic mentor. The following year, the 23-year-old Carné made Nogent (Marcel Carné, 1929), a short documentary about the Sunday escapades of young Parisians, shot with a hand-held camera. He visited the USA as a film critic. Back in France, he became assistant director to René Clair for Sous les toits de Paris (1930), and to Jacques Feyder for Le Grand Jeu (1934), Pension Mimosas (1935) and La kermesse héroïque/Carnival in Flanders (1935). Feyder introduced him to Jacques Prévert. The surrealist poet and film writer became a lifelong friend of Carné and wrote the screenplay for his first feature, Jenny (Marcel Carné,1936), starring Jean-Louis Barrault and Feyder's wife, Françoise Rosay. Carné's breakthrough came with his second film, the crime comedy Drôle de Drame/Bizarre, Bizarre (Marcel Carné, 1936), starring Louis Jouvet and Michel Simon. Prévert had also written the screenplay for this film. Their films Le quai des Brumes/Port of Shadows (Marcel Carné, 1938) and Le jour se lève/Daybreak (Marcel Carné, 1939), in which Jean Gabin played the leading role, made Carné one of the most important French filmmakers of the 1930s alongside Jean Renoir, René Clair and Julien Duvivier. Le Quai des brumes (Marcel Carné, 1938), marked an important turning point in Carné en Prévert’s collaboration. Carné's skill in depicting exteriors and directing actors combined with Prévert's combining themes of late surrealism with a restless atmosphere created the film's charm. It is a prime example of Poetic Realism. A typical French genre of the late 1930s characterised by a ‘preference for the darker side of life, sympathy for the disadvantaged, attention to social problems, especially the conflict between the individual and society [and the] positioning of the characters in a specific milieu. Carné’s films in this genre also revealed an insurmountable pessimistic attitude to life. Another example was Hôtel du Nord (Marcel Carné,1938) starring Louis Jouvet, Arletty and Annabella. Carné initially thought of Prévert to write the screenplay, but he was busy with other projects. The screenplay was written by Jean Aurenche and Henri Jeanson. Jouvet and Arletty are remembered as French cinema's most iconic pairing with their darkly comic bickering making up the more memorable moments of the film. Another highlight of Poetic Realism is Le jour se lève/Daybreak (Marcel Carné, 1939). It tells the story of a factory worker (Jean Gabin) who, just as he is about to be arrested by the police in his bedroom, relives the moments that led him to kill for love. When the sun rises, he shoots himself.  \n\t\n\tDuring the occupation of France by Nazi Germany in World War II, Marcel Carné's films were banned. He managed to shoot the medieval legend Les visiteurs du soir/The Devil's Envoys (Marcel Carné, 1942) starring Arletty and Alain Cuny in the zone of the Vichy government. Several of his team were Jewish, including Joseph Kosma and set designer Alexandre Trauner. Between 1943 and 1945, Carné directed under difficult conditions Les enfants du paradis/Children of Paradise (Marcel Carné, 1945), a clear anti-Nazi parable that was released after the liberation of France. Set in 19th-century Paris on the Boulevard du Crime, the film tells about a famous mime, Jean-Gaspard Deburau (Jean-Louis Barrault), and a great actor, Frédérick Lemaître (Pierre Brasseur), from the start of their careers to stardom and the love they both have for the beautiful Garance (Arletty). The film became a huge box-office success and an all-time classic of French cinema. Carné and Prévert followed this triumph with what at the time was the most expensive production ever undertaken in the history of French film. But the result, the mystery Les Portes de la nuit/Gates of the Night (Marcel Carné, 1946) starring Pierre Brasseur, Serge Reggiani and Yves Montand, was panned by the critics and a box-office failure. It was the last completed film of Carné and Prévert. Their Poetic Realism gave way to new forms of expression. From the 1950s onwards. Carné alternated highs and lows. The critics of Cahiers du cinéma, who became the film-makers of the New Wave, dismissed him and placed his films' merits solely with Prévert. However, the Emile Zola adaptation Thérèse Raquin/The Adultress (Marcel Carné, 1953) with Simone Signoret and Raf Vallone was screened at the 14th Venice International Film Festival where it won the Silver Lion. Carné was jury president of the first Berlinale in 1956 and he scored another box office success with Les tricheurs/Youthful Sinners (Marcel Carné, 1958) starring Jacques Charrier, Pascale Petit and Laurent Terzieff. The study of disaffected youth was the fifth biggest hit of the year in France. In the 1960s, Carné found it increasingly difficult to get his films produced. He was forced to re-edit Les jeunes loups/The Young Wolves (Marcel Carné, 1968) with Yves Beneyton, and the main character's bisexuality was completely cut from the film. Carné himself was openly gay. His partner was actor Roland Lesaffre, who appeared in many of his films. Some of Carné’s later films contain references to male homosexuality or bisexuality: the ambiguous relationship between Jean Gabin and Roland Lesaffre in L'air de Paris/The Air of Paris (Marcel Carné, 1954) or Laurent Terzieff's character in Les tricheurs/Youthful Sinners (Marcel Carné, 1958). Carné ended his career with the documentary La Bible/The Bible (Marcel Carné, 1977). In 1979, he was the first film director to be elected to the French Académie des Beaux-Arts. Marcel Carné died in 1996 in Clamart, France, at the age of 90. He was buried in the Cimetière Saint-Vincent on Montmartre in Paris. Roland Lesaffre was buried in the same grave in 2009. Edward Baron Turk published a biography of Carné, ‘Child of Paradise: Marcel Carné and the Golden Age of French Cinema’ (1989). \n\t\n\tSources: Volker Boehm (IMDb), Wikipedia (Dutch, German, French and English) and IMDb.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
