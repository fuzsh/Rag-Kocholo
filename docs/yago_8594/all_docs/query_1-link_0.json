The film was known as Bill in the US and as Old Bill of Paris and Coster Bill of Paris in the UK. The restored film is now known for its cinematic realism compared to many other films of the silent era [citation needed]. It is based on the 1901 novel L'Affaire Crainquebille by Anatole France, which was later adapted into a 1934 sound film Crainquebille.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nJérôme Crainquebille, is an ageing modest vegetable seller who has sold groceries from his cart in Les Halles market in Paris for over 40 years. One day, whilst waiting for a customer to give him his change, he is hassled by a policeman who insists that he moves on. When he protests, Crainquebille is arrested, supposedly for swearing at the policeman. Following a farcical trial, the old man is sent to jail, where due to the poor quality of his past life he enjoys the benefits of the free shelter and food.\n\nOn his release, however, his life continues to nose-dive: all of his past regular customers shun him, and, with no income, he turns to the bottle becoming an alcoholic. He is reduced to a tramp that everybody loathes, and the sad old man is about to commit suicide when a young street boy called \"Mouse\" takes him by the hand to forget about the past and persuades him to make a fresh start.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMaurice de Féraudy as Jérôme Crainquebille\n\nFélix Oudart as L'agent 64\n\nJean Forest as La Souris\n\nMarguerite Carré as Mme Laure\n\nJeanne Cheirel as Mme Bayard\n\nRené Worms as M.
