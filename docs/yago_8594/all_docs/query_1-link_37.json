        "text": "Anatole France's street vendor \"Crainquebille,\" whose misadventures with \"justice\" as dispensed in a Paris police court have been held to typify the gentle French author-philosopher's scorn of modern society, has come to life on the screen of the little Acme Theatre.Brought strictly up to date by the use of plenty of automobiles in the traffic jam which was the cause of the elderly hawker's first clash with the police, this remarkably well photographed and directed picture figuratively transports the audiences to an humble quarter of the French capital and makes them experience the petty joys and sorrows of the common people who live there. While the work of M. Tramel as \"Crainquebille\" is realism at its best, it must be stated that this veteran actor has a formidable rival in the youth (unfortunately unnamed on the program) playing the part of the newsboy whose kind heart saves the persecuted hawker from the Seine and provides a fairly satisfactory happy ending. The other members of the cast act right up to the high standard set by the principals.Although persons familiar with French naturally will get more enjoyment out of the film's sarcastic comments upon the functioning of the courts, there are plenty of English titles to help along those limited to that language. A highly interesting feature consists of a puppet show representing Crainquebille's dream of his judge as an angel descending from heaven to mete out justice here below.\n\nCRAINQUEBILLE, a dialogue film in French, with M. Tramel, Jeanne Fusier-Gir, Gaston Modot, M. Carjol and Rachel Devirys; directed by Jacques de Baroncelli; a Du World release. At the Acme Theatre."
