        "text": "Marcel Carné (born August 18, 1906, Paris, France—died October 31, 1996, Clamart, near Paris) was a motion-picture director noted for the poetic realism of his pessimistic dramas. He led the French cinema revival of the late 1930s.\n\nAfter holding various jobs, Carné joined the director Jacques Feyder as an assistant in 1928, and he also assisted René Clair on the popular comedy Sous les toits de Paris (1930; “Under the Roofs of Paris”). Carné’s first picture was a short documentary, Nogent, Eldorado du dimanche (1929; Nogent, Sunday’s Eldorado). Later the success of his film Jenny (1936) ensured his position as a leading director.\n\nThe screenplay for Jenny was by the poet Jacques Prévert, who would write the scripts for all but one of Carné’s finest films. Carné’s next picture, the comic crime fantasy Drôle de drame (1937; Bizarre, Bizarre), had sets designed by Alexandre Trauner, and both he and the composer Joseph Kosma also became regular collaborators on Carné’s films. Quai des brumes (1938; Port of Shadows) and Le Jour se lève (1939; Daybreak) established Carné as the preeminent director of the revival. In these films, whose fatalism was typical of the French cinema of the late 1930s, a pair of lovers find a few brief moments of happiness in a gloomy, mist-shrouded world of violence and hopelessness. The actor Jean Gabin became famous for his roles as the doomed hero in these films.\n\nDuring World War II, when it was impossible to deal effectively with contemporary subjects under the German occupation, Carné made two important period films. Les Visiteurs du soir (1942; The Devil’s Envoys), a costume drama that combines spectacle with romantic passion, is photographed with the lyricism and flowing smoothness characteristic of all Carné’s films. Les Enfants du paradis (1945; Children of Paradise), a fictionalized portrait of the mime Jean-Gaspard Deburau, paints a rich and powerfully evocative picture of 19th-century French theatrical society and is regarded as Carné’s masterpiece."
