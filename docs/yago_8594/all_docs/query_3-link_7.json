        "text": "In films as an actor from 1913 and director from 1916. Feyder's lyrical handling of realistic subject-matter created some of the finest French films of the 1920s, including \"Crainquebille\" (1923), \"Visage d'enfants\" (1924) and the celebrated Zola adaptation, \"Therese Raquin\" (1928). After a brief sojourn in Hollywood he assured his place as a key figure of \"poetic realism\" with a series of films starring his wife Francoise Rosay and co-written by Charles Spaak. Feyder's assistant during this period was future director Marcel Carne."
