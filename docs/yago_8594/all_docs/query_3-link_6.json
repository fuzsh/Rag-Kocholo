        "text": "Stage actor from 1912. Wrote and directed short features for Gaumont from 1916. Front-line military service during World War I. Directed Die Herrin von Atlantis (1921), shot on location in the Sahara, followed by another big success, Der Mann von der Straße (1922) two years later. Briefly with MGM in Hollywood, 1928-32, but did not enjoy the experience and returned to France. Directed his best film, La kermesse héroïque (1935) in 1935. After filming Tatjana (1937) for Alexander Korda, essentially retired. Found a safe refuge in Switzerland during the Second World War, teaching at the Geneva Conservatoire.\n\nHis younger contemporary René Clair judged in 1970, \"Jacques Feyder does not occupy today the place his work and his example should have earned him\". Any subsequent reassessment has tended to be hampered by the limited availability of his films in English-speaking countries, with the exception of La Kermesse héroïque which some reckon to have aged less well than other examples of his work. These factors have contributed to a sometimes ambivalent attitude to his work as a whole.\n\nIn 1944 Feyder and Françoise Rosay published Le Cinéma, notre métier, an autobiographical memoir of their work together in the cinema, in which Feyder stated that he regarded himself as an artisan, a craftsman of filmmaking. Some critics have been content to take him at his word and to look no further for any underlying vision of the world. He was however insistent upon his creative independence, demonstrated by his willingness to make his films in so many different countries if the conditions of production appeared favourable.\n\nHe started directing films for Gaumont in 1916, but his career was interrupted by service with the Belgian army during 1917-1919. After the end of the war, he returned to filmmaking and quickly built a reputation as one of the most innovative directors in French cinema. L'Atlantide (1921) (based on the novel by Pierre Benoit), and Crainquebille (1922) (from the novel by Anatole France) were his first major films to achieve public and critical attention.\n\nDisillusioned with the Hollywood system, Feyder returned to France in 1933. During the next three years he made three of his most successful films, all of them in collaboration with screenwriter Charles Spaak and featuring Françoise Rosay in a leading role. Le Grand Jeu (1934) and Pension Mimosas (1935) were both significant creations in the style of poetic realism; La Kermesse héroïque (1935) (also known as Carnival in Flanders) was a meticulously staged period film which aroused some contemporary political resonances; it earned Feyder several international awards.\n\nIt was in Hollywood that he made the transition to sound films; even before he had worked with sound films, Feyder declared himself to be a firm believer in their future, in contrast with some of his French contemporaries.\n\nAt age twenty-five he moved to Paris where he pursued an interest in acting, first on stage and then in film, adopting the name Jacques Feyder. He joined the Gaumont Film Company and in 1914 he became an assistant director with Gaston Ravel.\n\nIn 1917, Feyder had married Parisian-born actress Françoise Rosay (1891-1974) with whom he had three sons; she acted in many of his films and collaborated with him as writer and assistant director on Visages d'enfants.\n\nHis films achieved an atmosphere of realism, whether through the accumulation of judiciously chosen detail, the use of location shooting, or the use of elaborately designed sets; (he worked closely with Lazare Meerson on several of his films).[8] In this respect, his adherence to a realistic tradition in French cinema was contrasted with the 'impressionist' style of some contemporaries in the 1920s such as Abel Gance, Marcel L'Herbier, and Jean Epstein, and it pointed the way to the vogue for poetic realism which found its fullest expression in the films of Marcel Carné: Carné worked as assistant director to Feyder in the mid-1930s.\n\nHis last silent film in France was Les Nouveaux Messieurs, a topical political satire which provoked calls for it to be banned in France for \"insulting the dignity of parliament and its ministers\". By this time Feyder had accepted an offer from MGM to work in Hollywood, where in 1929 his first project was directing Greta Garbo in The Kiss, her last silent film."
