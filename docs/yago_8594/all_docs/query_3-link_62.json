        "text": "This is mostly a straightforward adaptation of Anatole France's story about a vegetable peddler who gets arrested for talking back to a cop, spends a couple of not-too-unpleasant weeks in jail, and then finds his life ruined when he gets out. It expands the story in three ways: a long prologue that introduces us to Paris in general and to the supporting characters, which is wonderful; a brief subplot with a new character who exists to give us a relatively happy ending, which is predictable but done pretty well; and some wild visual effects in the trial scenes to literalize the old man's confusion about the legal process, which clash with the style of the rest of the movie (and…\n\nCRAINQUEBILLE (Jacques Feyder, France, 1922, 7)\n\nRelative to my expectations I’d have to call that a bit of a disappointment (this was my most anticipated film of the festival).
