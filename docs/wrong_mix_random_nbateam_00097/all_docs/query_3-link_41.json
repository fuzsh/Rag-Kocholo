        "text": "News\n\n2024\n\nProfessor Muller is awarded highly prestigious SJSU President's Scholar award for 2023/2024\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nProfessor Gilles Muller Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar in the Departent of Chemistr at SJSU was recently awarded the prestigious SJSU President's Scholar award for 2023/2024. The award is in recognition of Prof. Muller's outstanding work as a teacher-scholar at SJSU. Since joining SJSU in 2004, Chemistry Prof. Muller has secured over $2 million in funding, mentored nearly 90 students, and published 71 peer-reviewed articles and 43 seminars. Under his mentorship, Prof. Muller's students have co-authored 54 publications and engaged in international collaborations. An expert in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), his collaborations span China, Poland, Spain, and the Czech Republic. CPL, which involves studying the interaction of circularly polarized light (the electric field vector of the light rotates in a circular motion as it propagates) with different molecules of interest, which has applications in chemistry, biology, materials science, and optics. His lab hosts a diverse group of scholars from various countries and educational levels. Muller finds joy in both research and teaching, valuing the interplay between the two. In response to winning the award, Prof. Muller stated \"I am honored and grateful to receive the 2023-24 President’s Scholar Award,\" he says. \"This honor represents more than just an individual accomplishment; it underscores the significance of collaboration and the value of engaging students in enriching research endeavors. It serves as a testament to the remarkable outcomes that arise from collective scholarly efforts, highlighting the transformative potential when we unite as a community dedicated to a shared purpose.\" Prof. Muller has also served as associate dean of research and chair of the Chemistry Department at SJSU. He expressed gratitude for receiving the 2023-24 President’s Scholar Award, highlighting the importance of collaboration and student engagement in research.\n\nProfessor Rios is awarded a NASA Grant to initiate an Astrobiology Scholars Program between SJSU, Skyline College and NASA Ames Research Center\n\nApr. 9, 2024\n\nProfessor Rios was recently funded to serve as the Principal Investigator(PI) of a two-year Bridge SEED grant (totaling $331k) for a proposal entitled, “Astrobiology Scholars Program Immersive Research Experience (ASPIRE)” from NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH23ZDA001N (ROSES-2023), F.23 Bridge Program Seed Funding (BPSF). The SMD Bridge program’s goal is to develop sustainable partnerships among institutions historically under-resourced by NASA and NASA Centers or Facilities. The goal of ASPIRE led by PI Rios is to develop long-term collaborations between faculty and students from SJSU and Skyline College (a two-year institution in the San Mateo Community College District) with scientists at NASA Ames Research Center. ASPIRE will leverage the diverse expertise found within the Exobiology Branch at Ames to give Scholars an opportunity to conduct research that contributes to two pillars of Astrobiology: origins of life on Earth and the search for life elsewhere. As a full year immersive program, Scholars participate in academic year activities focused on mentoring in research and professional development that enhance their summer research activities. Under ASPIRE, all Scholars are supported by year-round stipends that match the calculated living wage rate for Silicon Valley.\n\nProfessor Rios helps establish a newly funded research collaboration between SJSU and NASA JPL\n\nApr. 8, 2024\n\nProfessor Rios and Dr. Mauro Ferriera Santos at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) received an internal award from the JPL Center for Academic Partnerships for a project entitled, “Establishing a collaboration in life detection science with a new faculty member at San Jose State University'. This funding ($21k for 8 months) will provide opportunities for a student from SJSU to participate in research with Dr. Santos for 10 weeks at JPL in Pasadena this upcoming summer, 2024. The award will also provide funding for Dr. Santos to come to SJSU and for Dr. Rios to visit JPL for generating longer term collaborative projects.\n\nProf. Eggers Retires with a Flurry (of publications)\n\nMar. 18, 2024\n\nProfessor Daryl Eggers officially retired from the Chemistry Department in May of 2023, but some of his most important research findings are just now available to the scientific community. When questioned about the timing of this productivity, Dr. Eggers stated “I was determined to share these results and ideas with the biophysical community, and retirement freed up the time to read and think deeply about the work while writing the manuscripts.” Research in the Eggers Laboratory has focused on understanding the energetic role of water in binding and conformational equilibria, prompting a new thermodynamic framework that accounts for the change in solvation energy when two reactant surfaces make contact with one another. Regarding the new framework, Dr. Eggers said “our governing equation is viewed as controversial by many biophysical scientists, but I am hopeful that our approach may one day be recognized as an important pivot in the application of thermodynamics to solution equilibria. If the scientific community ever takes notice, these last three papers should become the most cited works of my career.”\n\nLink and TOC graphics for three papers:\n\nSupramolecular Chem (https://doi.org/10.1080/10610278.2023.2254442)\n\nACS Omega (https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c09329)\n\nbioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.15.585270)\n\nRetirement gift from Department:\n\nProf. Grazioli Publishes Research Paper on an Artificial Intelligence for Simulated Evolution of Models of Amyloid Fibril Formation\n\nFeb. 15, 2024\n\nThe latest article from the Grazioli Research Group (GRG), titled \"Genetic Algorithm for Automated Parameterization of Network Hamiltonian Models of Amyloid Fibril Formation,\" was just published in the American Chemical Society's Journal of Physical Chemistry B:\n\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c07322\n\nThis work is aimed at tackling the timescale gap in simulating protein aggregation leading to amyloid fibrils, which are related to diseases like Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington's disease. The AI-generated coarse-grained molecular simulations, which were optimized using a genetic algorithm - a form of AI that simulates evolution to produce better and better models with each new generation, were shown to exceed previous model performance, and offer insights into possible mechanisms of amyloid fibril formation. The article was co-authored by 3 undergraduate SJSU students: Andy Tao, Inika Bhatia, and Patrick Regan!\n\nThis work was supported by a research grant through the National Institutes of Health (1R16GM150706), as well as a CSUPERB research grant through the California State University system.\n\nAdditionally, the artwork above, created by Prof. Grazioli, was selected as a supplemental cover for this issue of the Journal of Physical Chemistry B.\n\nCover art description: Working with artificial intelligence can be a surreal experience. A type of AI called a genetic algorithm is introduced that is capable of discovering network Hamiltonian models (NHMs), which are coarse-grained models of molecular self-assembly, that produce maximal topological structure found in amyloid fibrils (well-known for their association with diseases like Alzheimer’s disease). The algorithm begins with a gene pool of low fibril yield models (represented by the ocean of low fibril yield networks), allows the models to evolve through breeding and natural selection (represented by the tree), and ultimately produces high fibril yield models (the orange and cyan colored networks). The 1,2 2-ribbon network structures shown are the most abundant amyloid fibril topology found in the PDB, exemplified by the protein structure shown behind the tree (PDB ID: 5KK3).\n\nProf. Resa Kelly is Elected Chair of the ACS Division of Chemical Education and Also Publishes New Article in the Journal of Chemical Education\n\nFeb. 11, 2024\n\nProf. Resa Kelly, the newly elected 2024 Chair of the ACS Division of Chemical Education, began service as Chair-Elect in 2023 when she facilitated the organization of a strategic planning retreat. Now at the helm of the Division, Kelly is focused on implementing the Strategic Plan, rallying volunteers, and initiating impactful projects.\n\nIn a notable collaboration with Vicente Talanquer, Kelly recently co-authored a paper published in the Journal of Chemical Education titled: \"Thinking and Learning in Nested Systems: The Individual Level.\" Drawing from conversations held during her sabbatical at the University of Arizona, Talanquer and Kelly explore the dynamics of individual student learning, shedding light on the complexities inherent in this process.\n\n2023\n\nProf. Wang Publishes Research Paper on the Effects of Resveratrol on SIRT1\n\nAugust 30, 2023\n\nThe work carried out by Dr. Wang investigates the dual regulatory effects of resveratrol, a small molecule regulator, on the activity of SIRT1, a crucial enzyme involved in cellular processes, and addresses the current knowledge gap in understanding the detailed mechanism of SIRT1 regulation. Our results from enzyme kinetics, protein stability, protein conformation, and binding studies suggest that the effects of resveratrol on SIRT1 are not simply on a linear spectrum, from inhibiting to activating. Instead, we propose that activation and inhibition of SIRT1 by resveratrol are carried out through two fundamentally different mechanisms. These findings shed light on the intricate regulatory mechanism of SIRT1 by resveratrol and provide insights into the conformational changes and substrate interactions underlying the dual effects. This knowledge is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutics and for assessing potential side effects of SIRT1 regulators in diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes. The study also highlights the importance of considering multiple peptide substrates in assessing the effects of regulators, moving beyond the limitations of previous studies that focused on a few canonical substrates. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of SIRT1 regulation and lays the foundation for future research and development of therapeutic interventions targeting SIRT1 in various diseases.

This award of $714,000 over 4 years will fund a research project underway in the Grazioli Research Group (GRG) titled \"Probing Amyloid Fibril Self-Assembly with Network Hamiltonian Simulations in Explicit Space,\" (National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health award number R16GM150706) and will be focused on developing coarse-grained computer simulation methods for studying the mechanism of formation of protein aggregates that have been implicated in a number of human diseases, such as type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. This interdisciplinary project will combine theoretical frameworks from network statistics (exponential-family random graph models), computational fluid dynamics, statistical mechanics, and artificial intelligence, and will require Prof. Grazioli and his students to build a custom simulation software package, which will be made freely available as open source software. Broader impacts of the work include not only making network Hamiltonian simulations more readily comparable with experiments, such as dye-binding fluorescence kinetic assays, but also increasing the capabilities of network Hamiltonian models as a predictive tool for elucidating the few-body intermolecular interactions from which the molecular self-assembly into large supramolecular structures are an emergent property.\n\nProject on Diamond and Nitrogen Vacancy Center Photophysics Awarded by NSF\n\nFebruary 27, 2023\n\nDiamond with its amazing physical properties usually associated with fine gem stones is also an emergent material in photonics, biolabeling and quantum sensing. The surface of diamond, while notoriously difficult to modify, is the target of a recently awarded NSF grant to the lab of Prof. Abe Wolcott (NSF LEAPS). Investigating new surface chemistry and its effect on electric field sensing by the fluorescent nitrogen vacancy center (NVC) are the main aims. NVCs are very sensitive to magnetic and electric fields and can be used in applicationa such as chemical analysis (similar to NMR) and pH sensing. Because the NVC is also a quantum bit, or qubit, it can be used in encoding and transmitting information. The project should have a broad impact in the field of materials science and those using spin defects in diamond for quantum detection. The work will be carried out by an ultradiverse team of researchers and in collaboration with the Black Leadership and Opportunity Center or BLOC.\n\nProf. Grazioli Publishes an Article on Instructional Activities using his Fluid Simulation Software\n\nFebruary 7, 2023\n\nProf. Grazioli recently published a peer-reviewed article with 4 SJSU student co-authors in the ACS Journal of Chemical Education titled \"Foregrounding the Code: Computational Chemistry Instructional Activities Using a Highly Readable Fluid Simulation Code.\" The article demonstrates two instructional activities for teaching computational chemistry to students that emphasizes students working directly with computer code. This approach is motivated by Dr. Grazioli's teaching philosophy that, just as students of organic chemistry need experience working directly with the chemicals and laboratory equipment used by professional organic chemists, so too do students of computational chemistry need experience with one of the professional computational chemist's core skills: writing code. The activities are centered around a Lennard-Jones fluid simulation code that Dr. Grazioli wrote in Python to maximize the readability of the simulation code for students. The article is freely available to the public through the CSU's open publishing agreement with the CSU, and the simulation code and Jupyter Notebook for the activity are freely downloadable from Dr. Grazioli's GitHub page.\n\nProf. Muller Publishes Two Research Papers with Cover Features\n\nJanuary 21, 2023\n\nProf. Gilles Muller recently published two research papers with two alumni of his research group in the Dept. of Chemistry at SJSU. One of the papers, published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry, is titled Tuning CPL by helical pitch modulation in helically-flexible small organic multichromophores (below top). This work is in collaboration with Prof. Santiago de la Moya at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and involved contributions from Prof. Muller's student Muzuki Johnson. The other paper, titled Vortex Flow-controlled Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Pt(II) Complex Aggregates Assembled at the Air-water Interface Small Methods, was published in Small Methods (below bottom). That was done in collaboration with Prof. Takeshi Naota of Osaka University and involved work carried out by Prof. Muller's student Shing Cho Ma.\n\n2022\n\nProf. Madalyn Radlauer publishes editoral titled \"Games for the Inorganic Chemistry Classroom\"\n\nJuly 27, 2022\n\nProf. Madalyn Radlauer recently published an editoral titled \"Games for the Inorganic Chemistry Classroom\" in the ACS journal Inorganic Chemistry (link). The article highlights educational games as a tool for active learning, also known as Game-Based Learning, in the chemistry classroom. The article aims to inspire instructors to consider chemistry games for their classroom and also to consider crafting games of their own.\n\nJuly 26, 2022\n\nUndergraduate researcher and recent physics graduate Camron X. Stokes (Fall 2021) in the Wolcott lab has been recognized for research excellence by the American Chemical Society. The award is in recognition of Camron's recent publication, cover art and resulting patent with nanoscale diamond chemistry and a discovering a new route to manipulate the world's toughest material. The Division of Colloid and Surface Chemistry has selected Camron as a COLL-PUI awardee and will give an invited lecture entitled, \" Exploiting the metastable brominated diamond surface for amine functionalization with linear, cyclic and branched amine\" at the national meeting of the ACS in Chicago, IL this Fall. Along with giving the invited lecture, Camron will also receive his award placard from the Division of Colloid and Surface Chemistry. Congratulations Camron!\n\nCongratulations to the class of 2022!\n\nMay 26, 2022\n\nProf. Esker Wins Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Early Career Faculty Development Grant\n\nMay 20, 2022\n\nCongratulations to Dr. Nicholas Esker, who recently received a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) early career faculty development grant to support the Esker group’s nuclear science and targetry research. Dr. Nicholas Esker and his group investigate methods to produce and study nuclei far from stability. The proposed project will build the necessary capabilities in SJSU’s Nuclear Science Facility in Duncan Hall to produce thin film samples of low-activity actinides such as thorium & uranium. These thin films, known as targets, are used in low energy nuclear reaction studies to investigate the production and decay of heavy nuclei. An important component in this project is student training, as this support will introduce SJSU students to nuclear science & train them in various thin film production and characterization techniques. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to revitalize the Nuclear Science Facility with a long-term research active faculty.\n\nProf. Grazioli Wins CSUPERB Faculty-Student Collaborative Research New Investigator Grant\n\nCongratulations to Prof. Gianmarc Grazioli on winning a CSUPERB Faculty-Student Collaborative Research New Investigator Grant!

SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that has been shown to play a significant role in many biological pathways including insulin secretion, tumor formation, lipid metabolism, and neurodegeneration. For this reason, SIRT1 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target, where the regulation of SIRT1 activity could combat diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. This progress has been hampered by insufficient understanding of the molecular mechanism of the regulation of SIRT1 activity. Prof. Wang’s lab aims to understand the regulatory allosteric interactions between the N-terminal domain and SIRT1’s catalytic core. Using biochemical and biophysical methods to clarify how the activity of SIRT1 is altered in various biological pathways and disease states will enable the targeted modulation of SIRT1 activity as a therapeutic method. The project will also provide insight into how other allosterically regulated enzymes function in the cell.\n\nProfessor Cheruzel Receives Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award\n\nMay 2019\n\nProf. Lionel Cheruzel was recognized for his commitment to excellence in research and education by the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation.

Our graduating class includes 8 students with a Master's of Science in Chemistry, 23 students with a Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry, 9 students with an ACS-certified Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, and 46 students with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with a Concentration in Biochemistry.\n\nProf. Radlauer Awarded CSUPERB Grant\n\nSpring 2018\n\nProf. Madalyn Radlauer was awarded a CSUPERB New Investigator Grant in Spring 2018. The funded project is inspired by the question: Can we mimic the macromolecular environment of an enzyme with an organic polymer to achieve effective catalysis? Enzymes, biological catalysts that accelerate reactions, promote numerous impressive reactions in nature. For example, transformations like selective methane oxidation have the technological potential to revolutionize our fuel economy. Thus, Prof. Radlauer turned to nature for inspiration, aiming to mimic the chemical transformations made possible by enzymes. Enzymes generally include an active site – where the reaction occurs – embedded in a larger structure, which provides stabilizing forces to promote the desired reaction. To access enzyme-like activity, the lab hypothesizes that these stabilizing interactions must also be mimicked. This task is nontrivial and remains a significant challenge. The proposed work aims to address the challenge of reproducing secondary interactions by embedding a small molecule “active site” within a larger synthetic scaffold to mimic bacterial enzymes that convert greenhouse gases into useful fuels. In addition to a deeper understanding of enzymes and their structures, success with this type of synthetic system might allow technological leaps for the fuel economy since we would be better able to transform greenhouse gases into viable fuels or industry-relevant chemicals.\n\nProf. Okuda Wins University Award\n\nSpring 2018\n\nProf. Roy Okuda was recognized with the 2017-2018 Distinguished Service Award.

He has been the recipient of numerous awards for his work in jazz programming, including the prestigious “Duke DuBois Humanitarian Award” by JazzWeek in 2008, a national award for lifetime achievement and service to the jazz and jazz radio communities. Prof. Stone’s work at KSJS-FM at SJSU led to that station’s inclusion on the original panels for both the Gavin and JazzWeek national Top 50 jazz charts, as well as KSJS being selected as a 2-time winner (7-time nominee) of the JazzWeek “Jazz Station of the Year – Medium Markets” award.\n\nProfessor Madalyn Radlauer Joins Chemistry Department\n\nFall 2017\n\nProf. Madalyn Radlauer will be teaching courses in inorganic, polymer and general chemistry. As both an organometallic and a polymer chemist, she is looking forward to combining these two areas in her lab, studying small molecule catalysts in macromolecular environments. Like traditional organometallic chemists, students in her lab will synthesize catalysts to lower the activation barrier for challenging reactions relevant to the fuel economy, but these catalysts will then be appended to polymers. Thus, the small molecule catalysts will work as active sites within a larger scaffold, similar to a protein or enzyme. The polymers’ ability to alter catalytic activity will be explored, where we expect that this biomimetic approach will have significant effects.\n\nProfessor Ningkun Wang Joins Chemistry Department\n\nFall 2017\n\nProf. Ningkun Wang will be teaching courses in biochemistry. With a background in protein interactions, Prof. Wang’s research combines biochemistry and biophysical methods to study indirect allosteric effects on the activity and substrate specificity of enzymes. The general goal of the lab is to study the “supporting actors” in biology that play a major role in the story and to learn how they go about doing that.\n\nSpecifically, the lab is interested in studying SIRT1, an enzyme that affects gene expression by de-acetylating transcription factors and histones. SIRT1 has a large, unstructured N-terminus domain that is not directly involved in enzyme catalysis, but regulates the catalytic activity and substrate specificity. The lab will seek to elucidate the mechanism of this allosteric effect by studying the interactions between the N-terminus domain and the enzyme catalytic core.\n\nCongrats, Graduates!\n\nMay 27, 2017\n\nThe chemistry department congratulates its 75 graduates from the 2016-2017 year!

Prof. Simocko's research bridges the gap between organic chemistry and polymer science. He studies structure-property relationships in polymer systems by considering a desired property (mechanic strength, melting temperature, ion conduction, etc.) and determining how polymer structure affects that property. The lab controls polymer structure by growing a polymer from a surface to create polymer brushes and by making precise polymers and block copolymers for tailored self-assembly via alternating diene metathesis polymerization. Some of the students working on this effort in the Simocko lab are shown above: From left to right: Paul Abarquez, Sandy Rosa, Alexis Sarabia, Andrew Pham, Melvina Lu, Natsu Okuda, Bryan Chin (front), Josh Chen (back), Hamdy Yahya.\n\nStudents Present at ABRCMS\n\nNovember 15, 2016\n\nStudents in the MARC, RISE, LSAMP and CoSRaTS programs presented their biomedical research at the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students held in Tampa, Florida in November 2016.\n\nCongratulations, Graduates!\n\nMay 27, 2016\n\nThe chemistry department congratulates our 65 graduates in the 2015-2016 year! In addition to 7 master’s students, we had 9 students graduate with a B.A., 9 with a B.S., and 40 with a B.S. with an emphasis in biochemistry.\n\nProfessor Miller Conrad Awarded an NIH Grant to Investigate Resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nApril 4, 2016\n\nProf. Laura Miller Conrad was awarded an NIH SC3 Grant to investigate and block antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterium is the leading gram-negative cause of secondary infections in hospitals. Few treatments successfully clear the infection and resistant strains are increasingly encountered. One class of last-resort drugs currently used are cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) like colistin and polymyxin B. Alarmingly, CAP-resistant strains have also been encountered, threatening the efficacy of these life-saving treatments.\n\nThe positively-charged CAPs enter the bacterial cell by electrostatic attraction to the negatively-charged outer membrane of P. aeruginosa, followed by disruption of the membrane. Once inside, the drug binds intracellular targets, killing the bacterium. In resistant strains, P. aeruginosa modifies its outer membrane to become less negatively charged, preventing uptake of the antibiotic. With the grant, the Miller Conrad lab will aim to inhibit a biosynthetic enzyme in the modification pathway, forcing the bacterium to maintain a negatively-charged outer membrane and to remain susceptible to CAP treatment. A successful inhibitor could be used in a combination therapy with the CAP antibiotic. Ken Choi and Sarah Matthews shown above are among the students working on the project.\n\nProfessor Rascón, Jr. Awarded an NIH Grant to Study Aedes aegypti Midgut Proteases\n\nFebruary 1, 2016\n\nProf. Alberto A. Rascón, Jr. was awarded an SC3 research grant from the NIH. The project will investigate the role midgut proteases play during the blood meal digestion process in the virus-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito. The mosquito specifically feeds on humans to obtain the nutrients needed for the egg laying process, and it is this blood-feeding behavior that facilitates the spread of blood-borne pathogens including Yellow fever, Dengue fever, Chikungunya, and the Zika virus, which has recently emerged in the Americas. At the moment, the only way to minimize pathogen transmission is through mosquito (vector) control. Current strategies include the use of insecticides, which have proven effective in reducing the mosquito population and slowing down pathogen transmission. However, there has been an increase in Ae. aegypti mosquito resistance to available insecticides and with increasing world population, global warming, urbanization, and the lack of other effective mosquito control strategies, the mosquito population will continue to grow. As a result, we will likely experience higher incidences of Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika infections. The strategy being investigated in the Prof. Rascón, Jr. lab is to target the proteolytic enzymes involved in the blood meal protein digestion process, which should have a negative affect on egg development, reduce the mosquito population, and hence reduce pathogen transmission.\n\n2015\n\nStudents and Faculty Attend ABRCMS\n\nDecember 1, 2015\n\nA group of SJSU students and faculty attended the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students in Seattle on November 11-14, 2015. At this conference students can present scientific research they have performed with faculty. The students are participants in the MARC, RISE, LSAMP and CoSRaTS programs housed in the College of Science. Five students received awards for their presentations. MARC students Jessica Ballin (Psychology) and Rebecca Sandoval (Psychology) presented research performed during the summer at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign and University of Michigan, respectively. Awardees from the RISE program presented work done with faculty at SJSU. These students are Fauna Yarza (Biological Sciences, Professor Elizabeth Skovran), Elvia Silva (Biological Sciences, Professor Tzvia Abramson) and Adrian Riives (Chemistry, Prof. Gilles Muller).\n\nChemistry Department Receives Equipment Donations\n\nDecember 1, 2015\n\nTwo mass spectrometers were donated to the department this fall, giving students experience with state of the art equipment. The Prof. Joseph Pesek's research group received a Perkin-Elmer liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) instrument donation for use by CHEM 55L students. A new gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) instrument was donated by the Santa Clara Valley Water District and will be used in Prof. Roger Terrill’s CHEM 155 class. This is the second donation from SCVWD - the first was an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer system (ICP-OES).\n\nProfessor Kelly Receives NSF Grant to Develop a Visualization Framework for Chemical Reactions\n\nOctober 1, 2015\n\nProf. Resa Kelly was awarded a $265,924 grant from the National Science Foundation – Division of Undergraduate Education - IUSE Program to design effective strategies to develop and present molecular visualizations that support student learning in General Chemistry. The framework will present students with a video of experimental evidence followed by animations in variance to each other. The student will be charged with critiquing the animations in connection to the experimental evidence to decide how the animations are similar to or different from the evidence and each other. Ultimately, they will be asked to reflect on the accuracy of each animation. The understanding and insights revealed through this endeavor, regarding how visualizations can enhance student success, will be of significant value to educators across a wide range of scientific disciplines, from biology, to earth sciences, to physics and more.\n\nProfessor Muller Leads Research Seminars in Japan\n\nOctober 1, 2015\n\nProf. Gilles Muller was invited by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) to visit several Japanese universities (Osaka City University, Osaka University, Toyama University, Tsukuba University, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Kinki University and Kwansei Gakuin University) in June 2015 to participate in educational and scientific discussions and to lead lectures and research seminars. Internationally recognized for his work in promoting excellence in research and for successful mentoring of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, Prof. Muller is one of the few researchers in the world studying circularly polarized luminescence. During his month-long visit, Prof. Muller also shared the mission of his research group which is to facilitate and increase undergraduate research as a teaching and mentoring tool at SJSU.\n\nProfessor Pesek and Dr. Matyska-Pesek Receive Grants from Brazilian Government\n\nSeptember 20, 2015\n\nProf. Joseph Pesek received a grant from the Brazilian government agency (CNPg) associated with Ministry of Science and Technology and Dr. Maria Matyska-Pesek received a grant from Brazilian government agency (CAPES) linked to Ministry of Education. Grants are devoted to development of new separation methods for analysis of different food products, impurities in food, main components and monitoring the changes in food after food processing. Both researchers spent two weeks in Brazil at the Federal University in Pelotas this summer."
