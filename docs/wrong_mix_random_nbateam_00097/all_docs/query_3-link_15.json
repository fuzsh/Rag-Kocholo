She is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences, the first and most highly acclaimed of which, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, tells of her life up to the age of seventeen and brought her international recognition and acclaim. Angelou's life was marked by a series of remarkable metamorphoses: from a child victim of racism, to a single mother working odd jobs to secure her son's future; from a nightclub dancer and performer to a renowned poet and author; from a coordinator for Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference to a friend and advisor to two U.S. Presidents.

January 20] 1905 – March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American writer and philosopher. She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935 and 1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals.Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.\n\nAge : Dec. at 77 (1905-1982)\n\nBirthplace : Saint Petersburg, Russia\n\nLisa Edelstein is an American actress and playwright renowned for her versatility, talent, and charisma.

Her performance over seven seasons (2004-2011) brought her critical acclaim and recognition, earning her a People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Drama Actress in 2011. Despite her success on House, Edelstein never allowed herself to be typecast. She has consistently demonstrated her range, playing diverse characters across numerous genres, such as her notable roles in The West Wing, Ally McBeal, and Felicity. In addition to her acting career, Edelstein is also a talented writer and an ardent activist. She authored, composed, and performed the musical Positive Me in response to the growing AIDS crisis during the late 1980s. As for her activism, Edelstein is known for using her platform to advocate for various causes, including animal rights and LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nAge : 58\n\nBirthplace : Boston, Massachusetts, USA\n\nDame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, (née Miller; 15 September 1890 – 12 January 1976) was an English writer. She is known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around her fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. Christie also wrote the world's longest-running play, a murder mystery, The Mousetrap, and, under the pen name Mary Westmacott, six romances. In 1971 she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature.Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon. Before marrying and starting a family in London, she had served in a Devon hospital during the First World War, tending to troops coming back from the trenches. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed when The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring Hercule Poirot, was published in 1920. During the Second World War, she worked as a pharmacy assistant at University College Hospital, London, acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which feature in many of her novels. Guinness World Records lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time. Her novels have sold roughly 2 billion copies, and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world's most-widely published books, behind only Shakespeare's works and the Bible. According to Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author, having been translated into at least 103 languages. And Then There Were None is Christie's best-selling novel, with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever, and one of the best-selling books of all time. Christie's stage play The Mousetrap holds the world record for longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25 November 1952, and as of April 2019 is still running after more than 27,000 performances.In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's highest honour, the Grand Master Award. Later the same year, Witness for the Prosecution received an Edgar Award by the MWA for Best Play. In 2013, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was voted the best crime novel ever by 600 fellow writers of the Crime Writers' Association. On 15 September 2015, coinciding with her 125th birthday, And Then There Were None was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. Most of her books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games and comics, and more than thirty feature films have been based on her work.\n\nAge : Dec. at 85 (1890-1976)\n\nBirthplace : Torquay, Devon, England, UK\n\nMae West, born Mary Jane West in August 1893, was a renowned American actress, singer, playwright, screenwriter, comedian, and sex symbol whose career spanned seven decades. Originating from Brooklyn, New York, West's uncanny ability to captivate an audience began at the tender age of seven when she first graced a public stage. By the time she turned fourteen, she had become a professional vaudeville performer and created an alter ego by the name \"Baby Mae\". West's career took another leap forward as she delved into playwriting under the pen name Jane Mast. Her early plays, like Sex and The Drag, were often deemed scandalous due to their bold explorations of sexuality and gender roles, compelling the authorities to prosecute her on moral charges. However, this only served to fuel her popularity. By the mid-1930s, West had transitioned to Hollywood and quickly made her mark with memorable performances in films such as She Done Him Wrong and I'm No Angel. Her sharp wit, sultry persona, and iconic one-liners propelled her to stardom, making her one of the highest-paid people in the United States. Despite the strict censorship rules of the era that sought to limit her provocative style, West continually pushed boundaries, redefining the portrayal of women in entertainment. Even into her 80s, she continued to perform, refusing to let age define her. Her legacy is marked by her fearless approach to challenging societal norms and her immense contributions to the entertainment industry. Mae West passed away in November 1980, but her influence continues to resonate, marking her as a true icon of 20th-century pop culture.\n\nAge : Dec. at 87 (1893-1980)\n\nBirthplace : New York City, USA, New York, Bushwick\n\nJoyce Carol Oates (born June 16, 1938) is an American writer.
