        "text": "Grabow, Fredericke (Venghaus) &\n\nGrabow, Louis\n\nGrabow Couple Passes\n\nMrs. Louis Grabow died at her home in Columbus Friday morning. Fifty-two hours and ten minutes later she was followed in death by her husband, Mr. Louis Grabow. The following obituary was read in connection with the burial service on the cemetery of the Zoar Lutheran Church Monday afternoon by Rev. W. A. Flachmeier, the officiating pastor.\n\nLouis Grabow was born in Pritzwalk, Prussia on Nov. 10th, 1849. Somewhat more than a year later on April 20, 1851, Fredericke Venghaus entered this life in Bielefeld. The two children soon emigrated to America, he with his parents in 1852, she with friends in 1858. While his folks settled in the Mentz section, she found a home near Frelsburg. Thus the children grew, both attending the Lutheran Church of Frelsburg where they were confirmed by that well known pioneer pastor, the Rev. J. C. Roehm. Here also, they joined their hands in holy wedlock on January 16, 1873. For many years thereafter they lived and labored on a farm near Mentz. Eight children were born to them in the course of time. They themselves came to be among the founders of the Zoar Lutheran Church near Bachelor Hill School. On Nov. 1st, 1929 they moved to Columbus with their son Louis to enjoy the evening of life in peace and quiet. And at last, when both had exceeded the age of the psalmist, they were called to their reward, neither one knowing of the death of the other. Saturday we laid the tired body of Mother Grabow to rest and today (Monday) we place the remains of Father Grabow by her side. For fifty-nine years they shared the joys and sorrows of life. Now may their bodies rest side by side until the great resurrection day.\n\nAll of the eight children of Mr. and Mrs. Grabow live to mourn their departure. They are Mrs. Henry Kansteiner of Mentz, Mrs. Ed Kansteiner of Columbus, Mrs. Fred Kansteiner of Mentz, Louis Grabow of Cat Spring, Henry Grabow of Mentz, Mrs. Fred Knoop of Buffalo, Nebr. and Mrs. Ad Kansteiner of Mentz. Eight grandchildren and three great grandchildren followed them to the grave. One sister of Mr. Grabow, Mrs. Aug. Ladusch grieves at home, too weak to leave her room. The large gathering here is some evidence of the esteem in which the departed were held.\n\nColorado County Citizen, September 29, 1932\n\nTranscribed by Judy Talkington\n\nGrabow, Henry Lee\n\nHenry Grabow Buried Tuesday At Columbus\n\nFuneral services for Henry Lee Grabow, 47, of Houston, husband of the former Miss Ella Muehr of Weimar, were held Tuesday at St. Anthonys Catholic Church, Columbus, with burial in the church cemetery.\n\nRev. Tom Collins officiated, assisted by Rev. Gideon Stram of Mentz and Rev. Leroy Braden of Houston.\n\nMr. Grabow died Sunday, Nov. 20, in Memorial Baptist Hospital SE, Houston. He had been ill since June.\n\nA salesman of heating and air conditioning equipment, he had lived in Houston the past 18 or 20 years. He was born July 25, 1919, at Mentz, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Grabow, and was a graduate of Columbus High School. He married Miss Muehr at Columbus on April 21, 1941, and they lived at Huntsville and Brenham for several years before moving to Houston. He was a member of Queen of Peace Catholic church and Knights of Columbus Council 803 at Houston. In addition to his wife he is survived by his father, who made his home with the couple.\n\nPallbearers were George Sebesta, Ellis Neuendorff, Clemens Venghaus, Roy Jones, Eugene Drescher, Sidney Frey, Willie Williams, and Milton Nelson.\n\nWeimar Mercury, November 24, 1966\n\nGrabow, Mary (Kansteiner)\n\nMrs. Mary Grabow Dies at 91, Burial Here Monday\n\nLast rites for 91-year-old Mrs. Mary Grabow were held at Untermeyers Funeral home Monday with burial in Odd Fellows Rest, Rev. G. Wolf of St. Pauls Lutheran church officiating.\n\nMrs. Grabow died Saturday at noon at the home of her son, Hugo Grabow, in Columbus. She had made her home with his family since the death of her husband, Louis Grabow, in February, 1938. She and Mr. Grabow moved to Columbus from Mentz in 1929.\n\nBorn in Mentz Jan. 27, 1868, she was a daughter of Fritz and Henrietta Buescher Kansteiner. She and her husband were married in 1902.\n\nMrs. Grabow had been in bed and in a wheelchair since she broke her hip in February, 1958.\n\nBesides her son she is survived by a grandson, Jesse Grabow, of Columbus and a brother, Phillip Kansteiner, of Cat Spring.\n\nPallbearers were her nephews, Ewald Kansteiner, Ellinger; Edgar Kansteiner and E. Grabow, Cat Spring; Melvin Gajeske, Columbus; Walter Krause, Willow Springs, and Henry Lee Grabow, Houston.\n\nColorado County Citizen, May 14, 1959, page 6\n\nGrace\n\n(Browse all obits with Grace surname)\n\nGraham, Doris (Davis) Potter\n\nGraham\n\nDoris Potter Graham, 78, of New Braunfels, formerly from Columbus, passed away May 19, at McKenna Memorial Hospital in New Braunfels.\n\nShe was born, in Columbus, July 16, 1925 to Robert and Elizabeth (Nelson) Davis.

[place of interment unknown]\n\nWeimar Mercury, March 1, 1902\n\nGranger, Abner\n\nAb. Granger, commonly called Ab. Crenshaw, a colored man, well and favorably known in this county, died of dropsy at Burditts Wells, on the 3d of this month. Uncle Ab. was indeed a worthy citizen. His old master, O B. Crenshaw, died during the war. Ab. was so trusty that the plantation was turned over to his sole management. The war over, he still remained on the old homestead controling the same, which he continued to do till one of the boys of his old master grew to be of age to take charge; then he moved to a tract of land he had bought, and improved it in good style, settling a family of grown children around him comfortably. He had at his death considerable property. He was noted for his honesty and integrity. Peace to his ashes. [Interred in the Independent Methodist Cemetery]\n\nWeimar Gimlet, June 11, 1885\n\nGranger, Freeman\n\nPolk, Cal\n\nDOUBLE KILLING\n\nBad blood had existed between Freeman Granger and Arthur and Gregory Walker--all negroes of this section--for some time, and their troubles had been aired in the courts as well as in private. Several personal encounters had taken place between them, and as Freeman was a large negro and the Walker brothers small and undersized, he easily worsted them. It is said that he beat up one of them badly in a Weimar saloon recently. All this had a tendency to provoke still further trouble, and it culminated last Saturday shortly after the noon hour when the Walker boys went gunning for Freeman. They found him at Laas saloon, and without further parley they opened fire on him. He ran, and they followed, shooting all the while. Cal Polk, another negro (of this city) and cousin of Freeman, ran to and grabbed one of the Walkers, when the other Walker jabbed a six-shooter against his back and fired. He fell and they sent another bullet or two at him. Thinking him finished, they continued their pursuit of Freeman, who had run from Laas saloon east up the street and into the store of Anton Alkek. Reaching the back door of this store he fell dead, seven bullets having entered his body. The Waker boys then left the scene, but soon afterward surrendered to City Marshal Henry J. Insall and were locked up in the calaboose.\n\nWhen the smoke of battle had cleared away, it was found that Cal Polk was mortally wounded, having been hit in the side and in the back, the later wound proving fatal Sunday morning at 2 oclock; Freeman Granger was found dead in the back door of Alkeks store, with seven bullet wounds upon his person--one near the nose, four in his back, and two grazing wounds, one on the arm and the other on the finger; Anton Alkek, proprietor of the store, was hit under the arm by a spent ball; and Freemans horse, hitched near the side door of Laas saloon, was struck by a stray bullet. The Walkers had emptied their pistols--one of which was a 45 and the other a 41. It is said that Cal and Freeman were unarmed\n\nThe Walkers were taken to Columbus on the afternoon train. They were brought back Monday for examining trial, but waived examination, declined bail, and were taken to jail to await the action of the grand jury.\n\nFreeman was buried at Independent and Cal in this city, Sunday afternoon.\n\nAll parties are well known, and are farmers. The Walkers do not appear to be more than 21 or 22 years of age, are sons of Tom Walker, a respected negro of the Oakland neighborhood, and have, we understand, hitherto borne good reputations.\n\nWeimar Mercury, August 18, 1900, page 5\n\nGranger, Dick\n\nWEIMAR LOCAL MATTERS\n\nDick Granger, a colored man well known in this community, for his honesty and integrity, died of dropsy near the evening of the 16th last. He was a brother of Ab Granger, whose death was mentioned in these items last week. Both died with the same disease. [Place of interment unknown]\n\nColorado Citizen, June 18, 1885\n\nGranger, Lucy\n\nWeimar Local Matters\n\nAunt Lucy Granger, colored, wife of Jas. Granger, an old faithful family servant in the O. B. Crenshaw family, died Wednesday morning last in great peace, leaving the consolation to the bereaved that all is well and that death had no terrors to her. She was about 60 years of age. Aunt Lucy was respected by both white and black for her honesty and uprightness. [Interment in Independent Methodist Cemetery]\n\nColorado Citizen, September 19, 1889, page 3\n\nGranger, Lizzie E. (Taylor)\n\nThe wife of Bedford Granger, a prominent and highly respected colored farmer of this section, died Saturday morning of a combination of tuberculosis and pneumonia, and was buried Sunday afternoon. They had been married but nine months. In his bereavement, Bedford has the sympathy of all our people, irrespective of color. [Interment in Paradise Garden]\n\nWeimar Mercury, Aug 5, 1910, page 5\n\nGranger, Penny\n\nWeimar Local Matters\n\nAunt Penny Granger, wife of the late Ab Granger, colored, died at her home December the 1st. Aunt Penny was quite old, was a faithful and devoted servant, respected by both white and black; before the war belonged to the Andrews and Crenshaw families. Aunt Penny was a devoted Christian, and passed calmly away, leaving loving admonitions to her children that survive her. [Interment in Independent Methodist cemetery]\n\nColorado Citizen, December 9, 1886\n\nGrant, Dr. Herbert Lucian\n\nThe shocking news of the suicide of Dr. H. L. Grant was received here this 9Thursday) morning, same having occurred at Houston Wednesday night. No particulars were obtainable this morning, nor could we learn where or when the burial was to take place. Dr. Grant was married seleral [sic.] years ago to Miss Willie Shaver, daughter of W. S. Shaver of this city. She died about a year ago, and since that time Dr. Grant has been extremely despondent, which undoubtedly was the cause of the rash act. Dr. Grant was visiting in Weimar the first of the week, in fact, we understand, was here up to Tuesday last, on a visit to Mr and Mrs Shaver and his two little children. He was a most pleasant, cultured man, a splendid physician, of lovable disposition, one who made friends wherever he went, and his tragic death is deeply and sincerely deplored by all. We will give further particulars of his death in our next issue. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the bereaved ones.\n\nWeimar Mercury, June 4, 1915\n\nSent Bullet Through His Brain Soon After Reaching Houston\n\nDr. H. Lucien Grant of El Campo was found dead with a bullet hole through his brain in his room at the DeGeorge hotel shortly before midnight Wednesday. In his right hand he grasped a 32 caliber pistol.\n\nHe left four notes, one to his mother, Mrs. A. S. Grant of 610 Anita street; Clifford Greve, an attorney of Houston; W. S. Shaver of Weimar and A. D. Lloyd of Houston. All but the note to Mr. Greve were sealed.\n\nThe note follows: \"Dear Clifford: I have withstood the terrible pressure to the limit and I can bear in[sic.] no longer. I wish to thank you and Highsmith (C. C. Highsmith) for your true friendship to me.\n\n\"In the tragedy just enacted, just when life semed worth living, fate has blasted all. All within me is dead now and to get peace and rest (unfinished).\n\n\"There is no other alternative except beyond the grave.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\"Lucien.\"\n\nThe note was written in apparently a steady hand, but evidently hurriedly.\n\nMr. Greve, who had a suite of rooms with Dr. Grant, was probably the last to see him alive. This was about 9:30 Wednweday. He invited him to dinner, but Dr. Grant declined and said he would be in the room when he returned home.\n\nMr. Greve discovered the prostrate form of the physician when he unlocked his door and Justice Walton was summoned. He returned a verdict of suicide.\n\nHotel attaches said they heard a muffled shot about 10 o'clock in the evening but thought the report a slamming door.\n\nThe body will be shipped to Weimar Friday by the Sid Westheimer Company and be laid to rest beside his wife.\n\nDr. Grant was a native of West Virginia and spent his boyhood at Palestine. After graduating from Tulane University he practiced medicine in Houston from 1898 to 1901, then removing to El Campo, where he resided 14 years. He was 39 years old. Surviving him are his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Adolphus S. Grant, the former president of the Grant Locomotive and Car Works of Houston; one brother, William A. Grant, secretary-treasurer of the same company; two sisters, Misses Ethel and Mary Grant, and his two chidren, a boy and a girl, aged 7 and 2 years, respectfully.—Houston Post\n\n—————\n\nThe funeral of Dr. Grant took place at the Masonic cemetery in this city Friday afternoon, Rev. Roy G. Rader officiating, in the presence of a large circle of sorrowing friends and relatives. The pall bearers were members of the Msonic order of this city and two of El Campo.\n\nWeimar Mercury, June 11, 1915, page 1\n\nGrant, Herbert Lucien Jr.\n\nLucien Grant Dies; Funeral Here Friday\n\nFuneral services for Lucien Grant, 71, of Weimar and New Mexico were held Friday afternoon January 19, from Hubbard Funeral Chapel with burial in Masonic Cemetery.\n\nRev.

L. and Willie Daniel Shaver Grant Sr.\n\nHis only survivor is his sister, Miss Mary Grant of Weimar.\n\nPallbearers were Jack Montgomery, Joe Kaye, Leslie Townsend, F. F. Brasher, Herbert Pickett, Jerry Vachala, M. K.

Andrew Patge Jr. officiating.\n\nInterment followed in the Weimar Masonic Cemetery.\n\nMiss Grant died on Tuesday, Dec. 17, following a lengthy illness.\n\nShe was a longtime teacher at Weimar Elementary School.\n\nMiss Grant was born May 1, 1913, in El Campo, the daughter of Dr. H. L. and Willie Daniel Shaver Grant Sr.\n\nHer parents died when she was young and she was raiseed by her grandmother, Mrs. Grace Shaver.\n\nMiss Grant attended Weimar schools and graduated from Weimar High School. She attended Southwest Texas University for her bachelor's degree. She received her master's degree from the University of Houston.\n\nHer teaching career started in 1931 at the New Bielau-Content Consolidated School. She taught here for nine years, moving to Boling Newgulf Public School, wher she taught for the next two years.\n\nShe then returned to Weimar Public Schools and taught for 38 years for a total of 49 years of teaching. Miss Grant retired in 1980.\n\nOver the years, she taught kindergarten through tenth grade, skipping the first and seventh grades. Her favorite level was the second grade.\n\nWhile at Weimar, she organized and directed a choir with students from third through eighth grades. The choir was entered in the UIL area competition and won first place every year.\n\nShe was a member of the First United Methodist Church and began playing the organ and piano for the church when she was 11. She continued in that position for more than 60 years.\n\nIn 1997, the Weimar Masonic Lodge presented her with the Lamar Medal, in recognition of her contributions to public education.\n\nIn addition to her parents, a brother, Lucien, prececed her in death.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the First United Methodist Church. of Weimar.\n\nWeimar Mercury, December 26,2002\n\nGrant, Willie (Shaver)\n\nMrs. Willie Shaver Grant.\n\nThe sad news of the death of Mrs. Willie Shaver Grant, wife of Dr. H. L. Grant of El Campo, was received here Tuesday night about midnight by her father, Mr. W. S. Shaver, who left on the first train for that point, accompanied by his wife and Rev. G. T. Gibbons. Full particulars regarding her death have not been received here up to the time of going to press, although it is understood that Mrs. Grant was undergoing a slight operation and while under the influence of chloroform, succumbed and every effort failed to survive her. News of her death shocked this community from the center to circumference, for Mrs., Grant was born and raised here, was a general favorite, often visited here after her marriage, and numbered every resident of our city as her personal friend. She was a lovely character, possessing a sweet, sunny disposition, was a devoted wife, mother and daughter, ever mindful of those about her, always glad to help the sick and suffering, and her death has cast a gloom over not only this community, but El Campo as well, in which city she and her husband have resided for a number of years. The remains will be brought to Weimar for burial in the Masonic cemetery this (Thursday) afternoon on the 3:20 train. The remains will be taken from the train to Mr. W. S. Shaver's residence, from which point the funeral will take place at 4:30. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the bereaved husband, children, father and relatives in the sad and irreparable loss or their loved one.\n\nWeimar Mercury, May 8, 1914, page 1\n\nDeath Claims Mrs. H. L. Grant\n\nAgain our city has been shocked with the realization that the grim reaper has been in our midst and one of our choicest flowers has been struck by the fatal sickle and garned to await the time when he that spake the world into existence shall declare that time shall be no more. Her life was short but the usefulness of our lives is not measured by the number of years that we live, Willie Shaver Grant departed this life very suddenly Tuesday night at 10:00 o'clock she had been complaining but a few days, and her condition was not deemed serious in any particular hence the shock was greater. Heart failure is assigned as the cause of her early demise. Mrs. Grant was 26 years 7 months and 2 days old. She was the daughter of Wm. Shaver of Weimar and spent her early life teaching school. About 8 years ago she was united in marriage to Dr. H. L. Grant and most of this time they have made their home in our midst. She leaves two children, husband and father to mourn for her besides a host of sympathetic friends who will share in their grief and render what assistance is posible[sic] in this trying hour. The funeral services were conducted from the residence Thursday morning by Rev. W. A. Manley. The remains were then shipped on the 10:00 o'clock train to Weimar her old home for burial. They were accompanied by relatives of the family, of Houston and Weimar who had come in Wednesday, besides husband and many friends from this place. And thus again we are brought to a full realization of the fact that life Is extremely uncertain. Two sudden deaths in our little city in four days should be a reminder that the most thoughtless could not but realize. The Citizen extends sympathy to the Dr. and his two motherless babes in this perhaps the darkest hour they have ever experienced.--El Campo Citizen.\n\nWeimar Mercury, May 15, 1914, page 1\n\nGraschel, Minnie (Bittner)\n\nServices, For Mrs. Graschel, 65, WednesdayFuneral S\n\nFuneral services for Mrs. Minnie Bittner Graschel, 65, of San Antonio, were held Wednesday morning, Jan. 2, at Hubbard Funeral Home and St. Michaels Catholic Church, with burial in the church cemetery.\n\nShe died on New Years Eve in San Antonio.\n\nMrs. Graschel, the former Miss Minnie Bittner, was a native of the Weimar area.\n\nSurviving are her husband, Paul Graschel; one son, Leroy (Sonny) Bahner of Wharton; one daughter, Mrs. Andrew (Essie Lee) Morales of San Antonio; 2 grandchildren and one great-granddaughter; 2 brothers, Artie Bittner of El Campo and Charles Bittner of Holman; and 3 sisters, Mrs. Robert Belcik of La Grange, Mrs. Oscar Heller of Weimar and Mrs. John Luecke of La Grange.\n\nWeimar Mercury, January 3, 1962, page 5\n\nGrave, August\n\nFormer Weimar Citizen Died in Germany\n\nA Mercury reporter accidently a few days ago learned that Mr. A.

Contact Rox Ann Johnson\n\nGray, Lillie (Greak)\n\nOAK GROVE ITEMS\n\nRelatives and friends of the family were greatly surprisd Monday morning when news was flashed around that Mrs. Lillie Greak Grey, wife of Mr. Randolph Grey of Houston, was dead. Mrs. Grey was formerly Miss Lillie Greak, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. R. Greak of this sectiion, was born and raised here, and lived here up to about two years ago when her health became so bad that she and her husband moved to Houston, but to no avail. For the past seven months she had been with her brother, Herman, at Glidden, where she passed away Sunday night about 10:30. Lillie was of a cheerful disposton, always looking on the bright side of life, no matter how discouraging the circumstances. Despite the fact that disease made her an invalid for many months prior to her death, she never lost her cheerfulness, and during her critical stage for weeks she bore up cheerfully, inspiring those around her with the hope that after all perhaps she would survive. But it was not to be. The Saviour called her Sunday night of last week, and the poor, tired spirit gave up the battle and joined her Creator in that heavenly home above where sickness, suffering and parting are unknown. Poor Lillie! Only those closely associaed with her can realize the suffering she endured during the long months of her illness, and how she bore up so cheerfully is something that puzzles them all. Few people in this life could do so, yet she never murmured and was cheerful to the very last. In life she was a solace and comfort to those about her; in death all realize that she has gone to a better home than any of us possess on this earth. Lillie was still young--had she lived but two days longer she would have been 30 years old. She leaves to mourn her death a grief-stricken husband and little son, a father and several brothers and sisters, all of whom were here for the funeral except two. She was laid to rest in the Miller Creek Cemetery Monday at 4:30 p.m., Rev. Fleishman[sic] Lutheran minister of Columbus, performing the burial service.

He raised a large family of children and lived to see them all grown. In June 1871, he was married to his second wife, Mrs. S. A. O'Bryan, the mother of the editor of this paper.

Besides being a physician he was an ordained minister of the Cumberland Presbyterian church, and was all through his life a most exemplary christian gentleman.\n\nHe was a prominent mason, standing high in the order, and also a man of great force of character and possessed of many noble traits of character.

A. Gregory, aged 27. For him \"life’s fitful fever” was soon o’er, and “he sleeps well,” while aching hearts bewail his missing voice.\n\n”Peace; come away the song of woe\n\nBe after all an earthly song;\n\nPeace; come away; we do him wrong,\n\nTo weep so wildly; let us go.”\n\nColorado Citizen, October 18, 1888, page 3\n\nGregory, Mary (Hewit)\n\nOBITUARY.\n\nIt would be impossible to condense in a few lines the many virtues which adorned the character of Mrs. Mary Gregory, who departed this life in the full enjoyment of her Christian faith, in the city of Georgetown, on the 27th day of Feb., 1884. She was born in Adair county, Ky., July 15th 1818, moved to Marion county, Mo., with her parents (Francis and Sallie Hewit) at the age of ten; joined the M. E. Church at seventeen; was married to Umbleton Gregory in the year 1844, and moved with her husband to Fayette county, Texas, in the year 1845. My acquaintance with the family began in 1846 and has been a source of enjoyment and many blessing to me and mine. A short time before she died she requested that I should write her obituary, saying: -”Brother Charlie Thomas, has known me a long time, and knows how I have lived, having been my pastor for several years during that time:” Her superior in all that constitutes a perfect Christian character, we expect not to see; her equal in all womanly grace and Christian charity would be a benediction to any home. She passed through scenes of sore afflictions, but always trusted in God with an unwavering faith. At one time after her husband had been called from earth to heaven it was my sad duty to bury three of her sons in three successive days, yet she could rest in the promise of Christ “my grace is sufficient for you.” But although her faith never falterered[sic], yet her many trials began to tell on her physical constitution, and her health had been declining for some time, and on the 21st, day of Dec., 1883, she was compelled to take her bed, which proved to be the bed of death. Her daughter writes to me, “Our dear mother has gone to a better world, she was fully prepared to go; she suffered the most agonizing pains to the hour of her death, but through all her sufferings she never forgot Jesus. It was always Jesus blessed Savior, and she never got the least impatient with any one, and was thankful for the least favor; she talked to her children and advised them how to live and trust in the Lord; she was such a kind loving mother, she was perfectly conscious to the last. A short time before her death I saw her lips moving, and I stooped over and asked her if she wanted any thing, and she said ‘I want to pray,’ then after awhile she said ‘now Jesus come help me across the river,’ and then she pointed upward and her calm and peaceful and beautiful look, in death, proved to me that she was with the king in his beauty. She left nine children and quite a number of grandchildren, who were very much attached to her, she loved and cared for the little ones, was ever kind and loving in her family, had a kind and loving word for every one. She was such a dear good little mother. It was hard to have to give her up and how we miss her, sweet mother.” I have copied part of her daughter’s letter to me, feeling that it is better than anything that I could have written, We mourn her departure, but we are comforted with the assurance that she is forever with the Lord. Memory reverts with pleasure to the many campmeetings, where-Brother and Sister Gregory pitched their tent and spread their table and labored for the Salvation of souls and the glory of God. Their influence and efforts formed a large factor in one of the best revivals that ever occurred at Fayetteville. I can not refrain from saying to their children and to all who may read this brief notice, “ Follow them as they followed Christ.” [Place of interment unknown]\n\nC. W.

The funeral took place at the colored people's burying ground [Paradise Gardens] west of town the following day.

His funeral was largely attended.\n\nWeimar Mercury, January 9, 1920, page 1\n\nGrobe, Albert J.\n\nMany hearts throughout this section were bathed in sorrow Saturday afternoon when the news was flashed in that Mr. A. J. Grobe had succumbed to the inevitable and was no more. Mr. Grobe had been in ill health for several years past, but rallied a few months ago and paid visits to his children at various points in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. Returning to the home of his son, Mr. Chester Grobe in the New Bielau settlement, the first of the year, his vitality seemed to wane and he gradually began to decline and it was soon realized that the end for this truly good man and citizen was not far away. Everything that loving hands could do for him was done, but it was without avail and the poor, tired spirit passed peacefully onto its Creator. Funeral arrangements were made and the body tenderly laid to rest Monday afternoon by the side of his beloved wife, who had preceded him to the grave some years ago. Rev. J. C. Wilson, Methodist pastor conducted the funeral services assisted by Rev. A. I. Townsley of Columbus and Rev. C. E. Dearman of this city. The funeral was largely attended, there being many out of town visitors here for the sad occasion.\n\nMr. A. J. Grobe was born in the town of Brazoria, this state, May 9, 1852. He was the son of Henry and Johanna Grobe. Early in life he located in Galveston, engaged in the printing business, which profession he followed in various offices in that city, and on the Texas Christian Advocate. Ill health later in life forced him to give up his chosen profession, and with his mother and family he moved to the vicinity of Oakland, this county, where he engaged in farming which calling he pursued up to a few years ago, when a stroke of paralysis rendered him unable to further continue this work. Mr. Grobe was married to Miss Eliza Allen Nov. 22, 1882, and ten children were the result of this union. Of this number four died in infancy. The six living children are Mrs. D. J. Wilson of Edna, Mrs. J. H. Hightower of Odem, Mrs. P. H. Goesling of Magdalena, N. M., C. A.Grobe of near Weimar, Miss Ollie Grobe and Fulton Grobe of near Wicksburg, Ariz. One brother, C. R. Grobe, esq. of Columbus and three sisters, Mrs. Ida Bock of Oakland, Mrs. Minnie Woolsey of Bay City and Mrs. A. B. Cornilius of Lockhart also survive.\n\nMr. Grobe had been a consistent and devout member of the Methodist Church since the early 80's. He was a typical Southern gentleman, hospitable to a fault, true as steel to his friends, a man whose word was accepted as readily as his bond, and one in whom all had confidence. He was honest, upright, a devoted husband and father, the best of friends and neighbors, and one whom it was an honor to call friend. He possessed the friendship and esteem of everyone who knew him and his death is deeply and sincerely deplored. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to his bereaved ones.\n\nWeimar Mercury, February 1, 1924\n\nTranscribed by Judy Talkington\n\nGrobe, Chester Allen\n\nRites Today For C.A.
