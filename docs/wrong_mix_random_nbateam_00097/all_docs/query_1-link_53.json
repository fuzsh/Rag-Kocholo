In 2014, Richard was inducted into the Books for a Better Life Hall of Fame.\n\nHis interest is in his clients’ long-term success, and he is dedicated to helping them create relationships with the very best partners in publishing and beyond. As a result, he has helped them sell millions of books, inspire and entertain millions of readers, and establish careers that last lifetimes.\n\nKimberly Witherspoon\n\nKimberly Witherspoon, at age 26, founded her own literary agency, which quickly became one of the most prestigious and successful agencies in Manhattan, with clients who are frequently published around the world. Over the past 15 years, she has represented critically acclaimed and bestselling authors of both fiction and nonfiction, including: José Andrés, Kate Atkinson, Anthony Bourdain, David Chang, Cindy Crawford, Janine di Giovanni, Lena Dunham, Amity Gaige, Gabrielle Hamilton, Martin Hagglund, Eloisa James, Neil Jordan, Sophie Kinsella, Dean Koontz, Yotam Ottolenghi, Peter Meehan, Julie Orringer, Ivy Pochoda, Jason Rezaian, Arundhati Roy, Kathryn Schulz, Lionel Shriver, Lalita Tademy, Christina Tosi, and David Vann.

As a literary agent, he represents authors in both the adult and young reader spaces and he’s particularly excited about high-quality fiction with a strong sense of plot. His clients include British Fantasy Award winner and national bestseller Paul Tremblay (A Head Full of Ghosts and The Cabin at the End of the World, recently adapted into the #1 film in the country, “Knock at the Cabin”); seven-time New York Times bestselling author as well as screenwriter Lauren Oliver (Before I Fall); international bestseller Clémence Michallon, whose debut thriller The Quiet Tenant was published by Knopf as well as in 30 foreign territories; New York Times bestseller and Newbery Medal winner Laura Amy Schlitz (Splendors and Glooms, Amber & Clay); National Book Award finalist Lisa Graff (A Tangle of Knots), and award-winning children’s author Minh Lê (Drawn Together), among others. In his role as agent for media company Storygiants, Stephen has additionally represented high-profile titles from celebrities such as Krysten Ritter, Hannah Brown, and Jessica Jung. While selective in taking on new clients, Stephen remains excited to discover great new writers and would be thrilled to find a novel that hits big on an emotional level or, if nonfiction, changes the way he thinks about the world.\n\nLyndsey Blessing\n\nLyndsey Blessing started her career in publishing in 1995 as an intern in the subsidiary rights department of Grove/Atlantic. She has since worked at the literary scouting agency Maria B. Campbell Associates, rising to Senior Scout and Deputy Director, a position she held for four years. There she worked closely with publishers from around the world, recommending American books for translation. She also lived in Europe for a number of years, working freelance in publishing in Paris and Berlin and teaching English for three years at Berlitz in Berlin. Lyndsey is a graduate of the University of Virginia where she received a BA in English and American Studies. She joined InkWell Management in 2009 as Co-Director of Foreign Rights.\n\nCatherine Drayton\n\nCatherine Drayton graduated from the University of Sydney with a BA in English Literature and a Bachelor of Laws. After graduating from the University of NSW with a Master of Laws she worked as a litigation lawyer specializing in copyright and libel law at a major international law firm. But novels, not legal precedents, were always top of her reading pile so in 1998, after a brief stint as a literary scout, she joined Arthur Pine Associates which subsequently became InkWell. She represents a wide range of fiction from around the world for both adults and children as well as some non-fiction on subjects that intrigue her. Her bestselling and award-winning clients include Markus Zusak, Beth Hoffman, John Flanagan, Becca Fitzpatrick, Gavriel Savit, Cath Crowley and Karen Foxlee. Many of her clients are published in multiple territories and sold for film. She particularly loves working with debut authors and is looking for writing that is memorable and enduring. Catherine is InkWell’s Sydney affiliate and when she isn’t reading, she can be found swimming, surfing, hiking and cooking for family and friends.\n\nClaire Friedman\n\nClaire Friedman joined InkWell in 2016. Originally from Salt Lake City, Claire spent three years working for her local indie bookstore, The King’s English, before moving to New York to attend Columbia University. Claire graduated with dual degrees in English and History, and continues to have stress dreams about the core curriculum. Claire is actively seeking upmarket and commercial fiction in the adult and YA categories, with a special focus on book club fiction, thrillers and suspense, romance, and anything with a speculative edge. More on what Claire is looking for can be found at: https://www.manuscriptwishlist.com/mswl-post/claire-friedman/.\n\nCharlie Olsen\n\nCharlie Olsen started his publishing career at InkWell in 2007 and has been building his client list since. He is interested in fiction, children’s books, graphic novels and illustrated works, and compelling narrative non-fiction. Prior to Inkwell, Charlie studied print journalism at Rider University, covered a beat at a newswire in the District of Columbia, and wrote for two newspapers in New Jersey. He works with award-winning graphic novelists, including New York Times bestseller Matt Kindt, New York Times bestseller Jeff Lemire, and National Book Award finalist ND Stevenson; distinguished children’s book authors including New York Times bestseller Andrea Robertson, Amy Ewing, and Gus Gordon; and also represents non-fiction—both illustrated and traditional prose—like Whisk(e)y Distilled by Heather Greene (Viking, 2014); a book about the seven would-be assassins of Queen Victoria called Shooting Victoria by Paul Thomas Murphy (Pegasus,2012); and The Warren Commission Report: A Graphic Investigation into the Kennedy Assassination by Dan Mishkin, Ernie Cólon, and Jerzy Drozd (Abrams, 2014).\n\nGideon Pine\n\nGideon is interested in representing writers in the nonfiction space with a focus on historical narrative nonfiction, true crime, health and wellness, and long form investigative journalism. He is also looking for voice-driven debut novels, including but not limited to the following genres: thriller, mystery, horror, or literary fiction. Whether a book is destined to be the next book club bestseller or a cult classic that will live on forever, he wants to read it. Gideon has a B.A in Political Science from Indiana University. Prior to working in publishing, he worked in commercial production and advertising.\n\nEliza Rothstein\n\nA native of St. Louis, Eliza Rothstein began her career in publishing at The Susan Golomb Literary Agency after studying Comparative Literature and Art History at the University of Pennsylvania and attending the Columbia Publishing Course. At InkWell, she represents memoir, literary and commercial fiction, and a wide range of journalists and non-fiction authors who seek to generate deep conversations, inspire social and systemic change, or advance our understanding of our minds and bodies. In addition to finding publishers for their books, she helps writers expand their reach by placing essays and journalism in publications ranging from The New York Times and The Atlantic to National Geographic and Sports Illustrated. She is particularly interested in the intersection of narrative writing with topics of psychology, medicine, science, food, technology, business, humor and pop culture. She is also drawn to literary fiction that explores diverse communities or intergenerational stories, commercial fiction that crosses genre borders, and fiction from Latinx and Spanish-speaking writers.\n\nDavid Hale Smith\n\nDavid Hale Smith is looking for mind-blowing commercial fiction and compelling nonfiction. Prior to joining InkWell in 2011, he operated his eponymous literary agency in Texas, which he started just a few years after graduating from Kenyon College. His fiction list includes thriller phenom Matthew FitzSimmons, Gary Phillips (writer for hit FX series Snowfall), Chad Zunker and The New York Times Bestselling novelists Greg Rucka (creator of ABC’s Stumptown, and the #1 Netflix smash hit The Old Guard, starring Charlize Theron) and Blake Crouch, author of the smash genre-benders Recursion, Dark Matter and the multi-million selling Wayward Pines trilogy (adapted into the FOX television show). In nonfiction, Smith represents Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch, co-authors of the classic Intuitive Eating; Jordan Mackay, Rajat Parr, Daniel Vaughn and Robert Sietsema; Top Chef stars John Tesar and Isaac Toups; and New York Times Bestsellers Skip Hollandsworth and barbecue superstar Aaron Franklin. Smith enjoys developing projects from concept to finished book, and is active in selling film and television rights for his clients, making numerous annual trips to the West Coast to pitch projects to managers, agents and producers. He lives in Dallas, Texas and commutes to New York."
