        "text": "üí° What‚Äôs your impact? üí° We talk about impact, purpose, and meaning more and more in business. As it often happens, someone, somewhere (probably in America ;-)) has chosen these ‚Äúnew‚Äù words to label or better define what, in truth, is a basic human need: the need to leave a mark on this world. As I embark on a big change soon, I was reflecting on my personal purpose and, more concretely, on my personal impact over the last 3 years (the post-big job, ‚Äúpost‚Äù Covid era). So, I put together a sort of personal impact report. Much of it is deeply personal, but there are some general points that make me proud and sum up my values, as well as the person I want to be. So here they are, without some of the more intimate details. Thank you for indulging my Simon Sinek moment: ‚úÖ I was a good friend: As you grow through life, friendships can be real lifelines, and I am grateful for having been on the receiving end of that several times in the past. In the last 3 years, though, I have had the honor of being at the giving end and had the chance to have a tangible impact on more than one friend‚Äôs life. ‚úÖ I became a better me: What doesn‚Äôt kill you makes you stronger. The lessons I have learned in the last 3 years have refocused priorities onto me in order to be there for my family, my loved ones, and the planet as a better version of myself. ‚úÖ I can make difficult choices: The only constant is change, and I feel much more at ease with it now. I had made many changes before, but this was either because life brought me there (and I had the courage or the naivet√© to jump), OR they were taken with a lot of self-doubt. I finally get to the point of not fearing to jump towards a new adventure and trust that I have the resources to make it work or the humility to fail and learn. Voil√†! ‚ö† N.B.: An important caveat is that these 3 points are nowhere near true every day. Sometimes I have been a rubbish friend or I have not been there for loved ones. BUT the important thing is that I feel that these ring true most of the time, and I work at it every day. ‚ö† Life is about movement, change, and constant learning, so we need to keep trying every single day. üí° And you?
