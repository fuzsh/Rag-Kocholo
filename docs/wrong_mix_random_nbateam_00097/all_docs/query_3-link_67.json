        "text": "May 14, 2024\n\nOURS program sets students up for success in graduate school and beyond\n\nMelanie Aldridge has always been interested in how medicine works. Driven by her online studies as a biochemistry student in ASU’s School of Molecular Sciences and her dedication to help others, Aldridge sought to pursue graduate school and gain the necessary research experience that would prepare her for a successful career.\n\nThrough ASU’s OURS program, she completed two internships: one in memory and attention control research, simulating neurological memory impairment studies, and another in cancer biology and evolutionary theory through the ACE Scholars Program. Through her involvement, Aldridge received five units of research credit on her transcripts, presented at five research symposiums, won a poster prize in cancer studies and is actively producing a manuscript detailing vulnerabilities in cancer communication.\n\nJanuary 23, 2024\n\nASU researchers develop DNA nanodevice for targeted cancer, disease treatment\n\nSixty years ago, the famous physicist Richard Feynman outlined his vision for the field of nanotechnology in his landmark lecture \"There is plenty of room at the bottom.\" Feynman foresaw new exciting applications for nanoscale devices, even conjecturing, \"Although it is a very wild idea, it would be interesting in surgery if you could swallow the surgeon.\"\n\nToday, that idea isn’t so wild. A research team led by professor Hao Yan from the School of Molecular Sciences and the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University has moved the field closer toward Feynman's vision; they have developed a DNA nanodevice that can selectively target cancer cells and deliver specific intracellular treatments.\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nASU launches cutting-edge chemistry labs\n\nThis spring semester, more than 3,500 students now have access to a dozen newly remodeled laboratories outfitted with advanced technology, interactive teaching tools and increased capacity for collaboration.\n\nA ribbon-cutting event on Jan. 11 celebrated the grand opening of Arizona State University’s School of Molecular Sciences’ newly remodeled chemistry and biochemistry labs, and the dedication of the Scott and Barbara Dow Lab — ASU’s newest analytical and physical chemistry teaching facility outfitted with nearly $1 million of cutting-edge industry instrumentation.\n\nSeptember 26, 2023\n\n4 ASU undergraduates spent summer in Berkeley National Lab\n\nFour ASU undergraduate Native American students, under the ASU-Berkeley Lab STEM Pathways program from ASU’s School of Molecular Sciences, had the transformative opportunity to intern at the prestigious Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Led by Gary Moore, an associate professor affiliated with the Biodesign Center for Applied Structural Discovery, this initiative seeks to provide enriching STEM experiences for Indigenous students and address systemic barriers in the field. The program, highlighting the potential of diverse scientific minds, is a testament to ASU’s commitment to fostering equitable opportunities in STEM.\n\nJune 28, 2023\n\nEminent ASU scientist Alex Navrotsky to be honored at conferences throughout the year\n\nAlex Navrotsky, esteemed scientist and director of the Navrotsky Eyring Center for Materials of the Universe, is being recognized at international conferences in Boston, France, and Panama, as colleagues celebrate her distinguished career and 80th birthday, highlighting her significant contributions to materials science and her unwavering dedication to scientific advancement.\n\nApril 5, 2023\n\nASU-led team defends molecular oxygen findings\n\nWhen did molecular oxygen, the gas that all large and complex forms of life on Earth today require to function, first appear on Earth? For more than 15 years, work by a team of scientists led by Ariel Anbar has advanced the case that this biologically critical gas first appeared at least 2.5 billion years ago. Beginning with a pair of studies published in 2007, the team analyzed the chemistry of sedimentary rocks laid down on the ancient seafloor.\n\nFebruary 3, 2023\n\nNavrotsky named Regents Professor for groundbreaking work in materials science\n\nNavrotsky started her independent career in 1969, in what was then ASU’s Department of Chemistry, left for Princeton in 1985, moved to UC Davis in 1997 and rejoined ASU in 2019.She has been described as the world’s leading scientist in the field of thermochemistry of minerals and solid-state materials. Her discoveries have been of fundamental importance in solid-state chemistry, geochemistry, materials science and engineering, exoplanetary chemistry and materials for space exploration."
