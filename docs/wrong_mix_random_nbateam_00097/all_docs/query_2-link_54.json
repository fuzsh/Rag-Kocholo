Reverend Phillip Jones will officiate with burial following in the church cemetery. The family will be receiving friends one hour prior to the service in the church fellowship hall.\n\nThe family is meeting at the home of Laura & Wade Harris – 521 Amerson St. Hartsville, SC 29550.\n\nMemorials may be made to Pine Ridge Holiness Church at 3524 W. Bobo Newsom Hwy. Hartsville, SC 29550.\n\nNorton Funeral Home & Crematory is honored to be serving the Sorise family."
