In 1699, at age 21, Waser was appointed by Count Wilhelm Moritz von Solms-Braunfels as court painter to his castle Braunfels an der Lahn in Hessen. But her promising career ended when she had to take care of her ailing her mother, and run the family household.

Ironically, she was later forced out after refusing to admit male students to her advanced women’s studies classes, which violated university policy and its interpretation of Title IX, even though she did allow men in her introductory class, and tutored male students separately who wanted to take advanced classes; noted for her second book, Beyond God the Father.\n\nOctober 16, 1928 – Sehadete Mekuli born, Albanian gynecologist, professor, and lecturer who worked to improve the health education of girls. She became a public figure when she gave medical treatment to injured students at the University of Pristina during the Kosovo protests in the spring of 1981, which began when a few students started demonstrating against having to wait in line for hours for poor-quality food, but escalated as police cracked down harshly, and made dozens of arrests. Albanian students began demanding more autonomy for Albanians within the Yugoslavian federation, and the demonstrations spread to other ethnic Albanians, launching a nationalist and egalitarian movement. The Yugoslavian government declared a state of emergency in Pristina and Kosovska Mitrovica, which led to rioting. The unrest was suppressed by a large police intervention that caused numerous casualties, and a period of political repression followed. Because of her treatment of the students and her ethnic background, Mekuli was accused of “showing too much zeal” in treating the wounded and of siding with the students. She was denied a full professorship at the University of Pristina School of Medicine, then forced into early retirement in 1988. In 1996, she opened a gynecology and obstetrics clinic, where she enlisted other gynecologists in Kosovo to work with her in treating women.

The garment, called an exploration extravehicular mobility unit (xEMU), is designed for exploring the lunar surface, specifically the Moon’s south pole – target for NASA’s next crewed lunar landing. The other new spacesuit is an orange pressure suit, the Orion crew survival system, to be used by astronauts when they launch into space on the Orion capsule and return to Earth.

The woman brought her colleagues a round of coffees every workday from a bar near their office. On October 6, 2017, Alice Bordon, the plot’s target, recalled: “Usually I would just sip it, but on that day I drank it all in one gulp.” Shortly after, she lost her balance as she walked towards her desk. “Everything was black, I felt like I was floating.” Bordon was taken to a hospital where she was tested for a possible stroke, but the tests were negative. Other incidents followed, including Bordon crashing her car into a wall. But it wasn’t until Christmas that year that Bordon suspected that the coffee was the problem. The colleague took a few days off, and during that time Bordon was fine. She stopped drinking the coffee. Later, she accepted another cappuccino from her co-worker, but only sipped part of it, then put some in a test tube, and had it analyzed. It contained ten times the normal dose of the tranquillizer. The colleague was then caught red-handed by police as she was putting the medicine into Bordon’s cup.\n\nOctober 16, 2021 – The body of Christina Nance, a 29-year-old African-American, reported missing 12 days earlier, was found inside an unused police transport van parked outside the Huntsville Public Safety Complex in Alabama. The van was not locked on the outside in spite of department policy that vans should be locked when parked. However, the van is designed so the prisoner section would be automatically locked from the inside when the doors are closed. Her heartbroken family is demanding answers, and wants a full, unedited copy of the surveillance video of the parking lot. Both the police department and the state medical examiner have already said there are no signs of foul play in Nance’s death, but the medical examiner said there would be further testing, including a toxicology report. As of March, 2022, the autopsy results revealed that she had been dead for eight to ten days before her body was discovered, but the cause of death remained uncertain. In April, 2022, her family filed a civil lawsuit.\n\n____________________________\n\nOctober 17, 690 – Wu Zetian ascends to the throne of the Tang dynasty, proclaiming herself ruler of the Chinese Empire; she is the sole officially recognized Empress Regnant of China (690-705) in over two millennia.

The more dramatic the movement, the more dramatic the recovery should be.\n\nOctober 17, 1900 – C.

Botella ordered Donosteve to reinstate the woman.

In an interview, she said her life had a very rough start. After giving birth to a daughter instead of the son her husband demanded, her mother was severely depressed, and put Fawzia on her first day of life outside in the sun to die. But her mother changed her mind after a few hours, and brought her daughter back in the house. Koofi became an exceptional student, and was at university when the Taliban came to power in 1996. She was forced to leave school, along with all other Afghan females, who were banned from leaving their homes to go to school or to work. But after U.S. forces toppled the Taliban in 2001, Koofi completed her education, and ran for parliament. She became her country’s first woman deputy and first woman deputy speaker, then Vice President of the National Assembly. She also worked with UNICEF as a Child Protection Officer to combat the abuse and exploitation of children. In 2020, she was one of four women selected as part of the 21-member delegation for peace talks with the Taliban, after Afghan feminists lobbied hard to have women represented in the negotiations. Koofi nearly didn't make it to the peace talks, held in Qatar, because gunmen fired at her car before the talks started. She was shot in the arm, but the assailants got away. It was not the first assassination attempt made on her. Koofi said just being at the negotiations was an achievement, because it forced the Taliban to deal with women, even if some of them were so conservative that they refused to even look at her. She wanted respect for rights of the women of Afghanistan, but she also talked about the future of her country, about a cease-fire, “about everything that actually matters for my people.” Koofi stayed for two weeks after the Talban retook control of the government, but when she was placed under house arrest, she decided she would be more effective outside the country. She escaped, and is now in exile in London, still speaking out for the women of Afghanistan.\n\nOctober 17, 2021 – Heather Barr, Associate Director of the Women’s Rights Division of Human Rights Watch, expressed grave concern about UNICEF, UNDP, the United Kingdom, Turkmenistan, and at least nine other countries and four other humanitarian organizations sending all-male delegations to meet with the Taliban Administration in Kabul. The devastating roll-backs of the rights of Afghan women and girls continue: girls secondary schools remain closed, and women are banned from universities; most women are barred from working outside the home; almost all women with government jobs were fired, the Ministry of Women’s Affairs was abolished, and replaced by a revival of the notorious Ministry of Vice and Virtue. They banned women’s sports, dismantled the system to protect women and girls fleeing violence by closing women’s shelters, ignoring the 2009 Law on the Elimination of Violence Against Women, and closing the specialized courts and prosecution units set up to enforce it. Most of Afghanistan’s women doctors, scientists, and journalists are forced to stay at home. The Taliban has met with the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative in Afghanistan Deborah Lyons. Heather Barr says when delegations or representatives are all male, it tacitly confirms the bias against women, and when male outsiders raise concerns about violations of women’s rights, and attempt to find “common ground” on the issue, it rings hollow. Representatives from other countries and organizations responsible for facilitating humanitarian assistance and development should demonstrate for the Taliban that having women on the team — every team — is simply how the world works, just about everywhere. The Taliban’s Foreign Affairs Ministry posts photos of these men-only meetings on Twitter. In 2023, the Taliban told UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohamed that she should not be there without her mahram – a husband, father, or brother. The Taliban desperately need humanitarian and developmental aid to keep their regime from collapsing– but when outside agencies send only male representatives to meet with them, it legitimizes and reinforces their patriarchal view of the world.\n\n____________________________\n\nOctober 18, 1523 – Anna Jagiellon born, last Polish ruler of the Jagiellonian dynasty; Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania (1575-1587), after the death of her brother, King Sigismund II Augustus, the last Jagiellon male, in 1572. She had never married, but now her hand was sought by pretenders to the Polish throne. She chose Stephen Báthory of Transylvania, who was ten years her junior, and they married in 1576, when she was 52 years old. He was crowned as co-ruler with her, but it was a dynastic arrangement, and they were never close. Her husband was preoccupied with the Livonian War against the Tsardom of Russia, so she took on local administrative matters, and oversaw several notable construction projects, including reconstruction of the Royal Castle, and a city wall in Warsaw to protect access to the Sigismund Augustus Bridge which crossed the Vistula River, the longest wooden crossing in Europe at the time, and one of the greatest engineering works of the Polish Renaissance. When Báthory died in 1586, Anna could have claimed her right to be sole ruler, but instead promoted her nephew Sigismund III Vasa as the next ruler (1587-1632), establishing the House of Vasa on the Polish throne until 1668. Anna died in Warsaw in 1596 at age 72, the last Jagiellon.\n\nOctober 18, 1587 – Lady Mary Wroth born, English Renaissance poet, one of the first woman to achieve an enduring reputation in literature; wrote Urania, the first known/surviving prose romance written by an English woman, the sonnet sequence Pamphilia to Amphilanthus, and Love’s Victory, a pastoral closet drama (reader’s theatre piece for private performance).\n\nOctober 18, 1775 – Poet Phillis Wheatley, a black slave in Boston, is freed upon the death of her master John Wheatley.\n\nOctober 18, 1872 – Melinda Scott born in Cheshire, England; she moved with her family the U.S., and Scott became a hat trimmer. She believed that more skilled and disciplined American-born women made better candidates for unionization, an argument she used to encourage the women she worked with to join the suffrage movement with her. Scott thought joining as many unions and groups as possible would maximize efforts to gain suffrage and equal rights for women. She joined the Neckwear Makers to further her involvement in the women's suffrage movement. Scott was known for her intelligence and eloquence when she spoke, and quickly became a business agent for the Neckwear Makers. In 1911, the Neckwear Makers joined the National Women's Trade Union League (WTUL). With input from Scott, the Neckwear Makers won better wages and conditions for the hat trimmers by January of 1912. The agreement promised a shorter work day, better wages, and offering full work to employees before it was offered to external contractors. This success motivated her to continue joining unions and fighting for women's rights. She gave a speech advocating for women's rights at the Wage Earner's Equal Suffrage League mass meeting in April 1912, responding to a statement by a senator from New York that referenced Roman history to define women. Scott emphasized the terrible conditions women faced at work and the squalid slum housing that also affected their children. She closed her speech by saying \"I want the ballot to be able to register my protest against the [working] conditions that are killing and maiming [workers].\" Scott's speech was referred to as \"inspiring\" by both women and men in attendance.\n\nOctober 18, 1874 – Christine Murrell born, English medical doctor, first woman member of the British Medical Association's Central Council; woman suffragist, chair of the WWI Women’s Emergency Corps; president of the Medical Women’s Federation (1926-1928).

It was the fifth spacewalk for Koch, but Meir’s first as the 15th woman to walk in space. Christina Koch is an electrical engineer, while Jessica Meir’s doctorate is in marine biology.\n\nOctober 18, 2020 – The Prado Museum in Madrid was under fire for its exhibition Invitadas no invitadas (Uninvited Guests) featuring artwork bought by the Spanish state between 1833 and 1931 depicting women, as painted by men in the first half, with paintings by women brought together specifically for this show in the second half. According to curator Carlos G. Navarro, the exhibit aims to explain “how the state – and the middle classes – came to fix on and publicly value certain images, prototypes and clichés that eventually became a collective imagination in which women were always represented in certain ways.” The paintings on the women’s side chronicle how women managed to invite themselves into the art world by working in less threatening roles as miniaturists, copyists, and painters of still lifes and flowers. But efforts to go further than that and paint what they wanted often met resistance. Aurelia Navarro’s 1908 “Female Nude” won much admiration and an award at that year’s national exhibition. But the attendant publicity and family pressure eventually led Navarro to abandon art and enter a convent. Embarrassingly, one of the paintings had been misattributed to a woman, and had to be removed when it was pointed out it was actually painted by a man. The final painting in the exhibition is a self-portrait by María Roësset (1882-1921), who looks over her shoulder directly at the viewer. Some women artists and academics accused the museum of echoing the very misogyny it was seeking to expose because 70 of the paintings are by men, and only 60 are by women. Navarro argues that Uninvited Guests is partly an act of self-criticism by the Prado over its complicity in ignoring so many female artists in the 19th century. He points out that the exhibition is intended to provide social, historical, and artistic context, and isn’t a stand-alone showcase for female artists. He said, “For me as a curator, the biggest problem female artists had in the 19th century was how they were treated by a state that protected, promoted and indulged male artists, and left them totally passed over. It reduced them to decorative elements like still-life painters and flower painters.” Navarro hoped to provoke discussion, “... what do we do with the pictures of the girls, or the ones of the slaves? Our stores are full of these kinds of images so what should we do with them? Which of the pictures in this exhibition should be on permanent show? That’s what I’d like people to debate because that’s the feedback museums need.”\n\nOctober 18, 2021 – On World Menopause Day, Carolyn Harris, Labour MP for Swansea East, said she was told to take a cup of tea and sent out of the room when her mother and aunties began talking about “the change” – “I was 36!” she exclaims, and that she asked her mum, “What did you think you were protecting me from? It was always going to happen to me too.” With typical frankness, she said in an interview, “You don’t get change unless you ask for it, and you demand it, or you put people in a position where they’re going to look like right bastards if they don’t do something about it. I want to be in a position where the government can’t say no and where companies won’t say no.” Two years ago, she began pushing for a bill demanding free prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy in England – already available in Scotland and Wales. In 2021, over 13 million English women were experiencing menopause or perimenopause, and research estimated that 14 million work days a year are being lost by the UK due to menopause-related issues. One in four women who experience menopausal symptoms – many at the top of their career – consider leaving their job. Harris’s own experience with menopause was brutal. Twenty years after losing her eight-year-old son in a road traffic accident she blamed herself for not processing her grief when she was hit by a deep depression. “It took me six years, having conversations with women, for me to realise I was going through the menopause,” she says. Now she uses her voice in parliament to speak up for those who she says are often just too tired to fight. “There’s a hell of a lot of women my age, working in supermarkets [or] in shops and they are exhausted,” she says. “A lot of those women are going through the menopause but they are not being treated, because in 2021 there is still not enough understanding about a condition that affects 51% of the population.”\n\n____________________________\n\nOctober 19, 879 – Shulü Ping born, Empress Yingtian of the Khitan Liao dynasty; in 916, her husband Yelü Abaoji, after consolidating his power over the Khitan tribes, declared himself Emperor Taizu and Shulü Ping as Empress. Described by contemporaries as brave, resolute and full of strategies, she often advised the Emperor in military matters. Once, when he was away fighting the Dangziang tribe, and the Empress was left in charge, two Mongolian tribes decided to raid the Khitan. The Empress heard of their plans, and had her army ambush them, a crushing defeat for the tribesmen. When the Emperor was urged to take advantage of coups in neighboring domains, she opposed the operation, and was proved right when the Khitan army was defeated and forced to withdraw. After Emperor Taizu died in 926, as Empress Dowager, she advised her son, Emperor Taizong, including arranging his marriage, but also arranged the executions of troublesome officials and courtiers. In traditional Khitan society, women were expected to sacrifice themselves, and Empress Dowagers were to wield their influence quietly behind the scenes, but Shulü Ping provided an alternative role model for high status women during the rule of two emperors.\n\nOctober 19, 1825 – Jeanette Granberg Stjernström born, Swedish writer, playwright, feminist, and translator. She sometimes used the pseudonym “Georges Malméen.” She wrote plays for the popular Mindre teatern (“smaller theatre”) in Stockholm. Known for Läsarepresten (The Reading Priest), and Tidningsskrifvaren (The Newspaper Clerk). In 1854, she married the actor Edvard Stjernström, founder of the Swedish Theatre (Stockholm). Jeanette died in 1857. After her death, her husband married her sister, Louise Granberg, a theatrical director who also wrote plays. Jeanette Granberg was considered a rising dramatic talent, and expected to become a major playwright. Her death at age 31 was a great loss for the theatre.\n\nOctober 19, 1850 – Annie Smith Peck born, American mountaineer, teacher, feminist, author, and lecturer; first woman to attend the American School of Classical Studies at Athens; taught archeology and Latin at Purdue University and Smith College; her tunic and trousers worn with boots when she climbed the Matterhorn in 1895 caused a serious hullaballoo in the press, and prompted public debate on what woman can and should do. She was the first woman to climb Huascarán in Peru (22,204 feet/6768 meters) when she was 57 years old, then climbed Coropuna (20,922 feet/6.377 meters) in 1911 and planted a “Votes for Women” banner at the summit; she continued to climb mountains until she was 82 years old.\n\nOctober 19, 1868 – Bertha Knight Landes born, high school teacher who married geologist Henry Landes in 1894, and they moved to Seattle. She became president of the Washington State chapter of the League of Women Voters. In 1921, as president of the Seattle Federation of Women's Clubs, she orchestrated a week-long Women's Educational Exhibit for Washington Manufacturers. Staffed by over 1,000 clubwomen, and showcasing the technological innovations of 130 manufacturers, it bolstered the spirits of the business community during a period of severe recession, and symbolized the emergence of Seattle as a sophisticated, modern metropolis. The mayor promptly appointed her as the only woman member of a commission studying ways to relieve unemployment. She served as a Seattle city councilwoman (1922-1924) – she and Kathryn Miracle were the first two women on the city council. Landes became the first woman mayor of a major American city, when she was elected Seattle’s mayor (1926-1928). In spite of her record of cleaning up corruption, and putting the city’s finances in order, she was defeated in her run for a second term by Frank Edwards, after a concerted effort to get out the male vote. In 1931, Edwards was recalled by the voters, 125,000 votes to 15,000, because he was believed to be in cahoots with corporations trying to get City Light, the municipal power company, privatized. Landes continued her civic activism until her health began to decline around 1939. She died in 1943, at age 75.\n\nOctober 19, 1879 – Emma Bell Miles born, American short story writer, poet, and artist; published The Spirit of the Mountains in 1905, a collection of stories, travels narratives, memoir, and cultural analysis of Southern Appalachia. The section of her book on Appalachian music first appeared as an article in Harper’s Monthly in 1904, probably the first printed in a popular magazine. Her journals have also been published.\n\nOctober 19, 1909 – Marguerite Perey born, French physicist and chemist, a student of Marie Curie. Noted for her discovery of the element francium; in 1949, she chaired a new nuclear chemistry department at the University of Strasbourg. In 1962, she was the first woman elected to the French Académie des Sciences, an honor denied to her mentor. She died in 1975 of cancer caused by radiation.\n\nOctober 19, 1917 – During WWI, Salvation Army Ensign Helen Purviance and Captain Margaret Sheldon, two of the first eleven Salvation Army women to arrive in France, were stationed behind the American fighting lines at Monte-sur-Soux, France. They rigged a make-shift system to provide doughnuts for the soldiers. Purviance had to get on her knees to work the tiny stove, and they had no way to make holes in the first batch of 150 “doughnuts,” which were received with overwhelming enthusiasm by the troops. Purviance improvised the tools they needed, using a wine bottle as a rolling pin, and getting a French blacksmith to combine an empty evaporated milk can, a shaving cream tube, and a block of wood into a dough cutter so their doughnuts had holes and were more symmetrical. The doughnuts were in such demand, they had to upgrade their equipment, and production increased to over 2,000 doughnuts a day. The “Doughnut Girls” often received thank you notes on scraps of paper, but they wanted to do more. In January, 1918, in spite of General Pershing’s reservations about women in a combat zone, Helen Purviance and three other “Doughnut Girls” were admitted to the front lines, equipped with gas masks, steel helmets, rubber blankets, and army revolvers. They suffered freezing cold, artillery bombardment, and all the other hardships which the soldiers faced except combat, and carried out their mission until the end of the war in November, 1918. Purviance estimated she cooked over one million doughnuts. She came home a national heroine, and used her celebrity to promote the Salvation Army, helping to set up Salvation Army posts in her hometown of Huntington, Indiana, and in Oswego, New York. By 1924 she was on the teaching staff at the Salvation Army’s training school in the Bronx, New York. In 1936, she became dean of the training college. She continued to make speeches, and often demonstrated making doughnuts at events, generating more positive press for the Salvation Army. Doughnuts surged in popularity in the U.S. Though she dreaded another war, when the U.S. entered WWII, Brigadier Helen Purviance trained the Salvation Army recruits for work in the field. A new treat was developed, the “All-American Cookie,” which could be made and packaged in Salvation Army kitchens at home, then shipped overseas.\n\nOctober 19, 1923 – Ruth Carter Stevenson born, American art patron and collector; founded the Amon Carter Museum of Art in Fort Worth, Texas, noted for its collection of American Western Art.

After the U.S. Department of Labor ruled in her favor, she began law school and volunteered for NOW. She advocated extensively for the rights of poor women, gays and lesbians, and African-American women. She campaigned for electing female candidates, and trained people to defend clinics from anti-choice protesters around the United States; author of What Women Want.\n\nOctober 19, 1954 – Deborah Blum born, American journalist, science writer and director of the Knight Science Journalism program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); author of The Poisoner’s Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York and The Poison Squad; she wrote a series for the Sacramento Bee called “The Monkey Wars” which won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Beat Reporting.\n\nOctober 19, 1958 – Carolyn Browne born, British diplomat, British Ambassador to Kazakhstan (2013-2018); Ambassador to Azerbaijan (2007-2011); and a Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the European Union (2002-2005).\n\nOctober 19, 1960 – Susan Straight born, American author, essayist, and short story writer; won the 2008 Edgar Allan Poe Award for her short story “The Golden Gopher.”\n\nOctober 19, 1967 – Amy Carter born, American human rights and diplomatic solutions activist; daughter of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter; as a student she campaigned against apartheid in South Africa and CIA recruitment on college campuses.

I don’t think there’s a woman out there who doesn’t know what that feels like.”\n\nOctober 19, 2019 – In the UK, the Centre For Women’s Justice (CWJ) brought a super complaint about the “boys’ club” culture within certain police forces that allows officers to abuse their spouses or partners without fear of arrest or prosecution, including 19 cases where women made allegations of domestic abuse and sexual violence against an officer or staff, only for the case to be dropped. “The police service is a traditionally male environment, where female officers remain in the minority, and also has a strong tradition of solidarity and loyalty between officers,” the complaint states. “This setting creates the potential for the seriousness of abuse to be downplayed and for a primary loyalty given to the male insider.” The CWJ complaint recommends appointing an external force to investigate police domestic abuse cases, “There is a real risk of lack of integrity and manipulation of police processes. We consider that the only way to address this is to create a physical separation between the investigation and the parties,” adding that this could help victims feel more confident in the process. Nogah Ofer, the CWJ solicitor who wrote the complaint, said: “We have been contacted by over 40 women who have felt severely let down by the police service after they reported domestic abuse and sexual offences committed by police officers and staff.” The three policing bodies who deal with complaints – the Independent Office for Police Conduct, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, and the College of Policing – will now decide whether to investigate further the CWJ’s complaint. In January 2023, the CWJ published a 12-point plan to tackle police perpetrated domestic abuse and restore women’s trust in policing. Nogah Ofer wrote, “When we published our police super complaint three years ago, police perpetrated domestic violence was barely known about … [Since] that time the murderer Wayne Couzens and the serial rapist David Carrick have demonstrated the sense of impunity and escalation of violence that results when police turn a blind eye.”\n\nOctober 19, 2020 – Joyce Chen, associate professor of development economics at Ohio State University, was working on multiple research projects, and on track for a promotion to full professor when Covid-19 put the brakes on, after four years of hard work as an associate professor. Chen was part of a small group of accomplished women academics in the field of economics. But Chen, a mother of three, became one of millions of moms sidelined by the pandemic because of the overwhelming needs of their families at home. While working fathers weren’t spared in the pandemic, data collected by the U.S. Labor Department shows it was largely mothers who dealt with children who weren’t in school full time. In September, 2020, 865,000 women dropped out of the workforce — four times the number of men who did. Countless others like Chen struggled to get anything done. For highly educated, high-income women, the \"mom penalty\" can be severe. Slowing down puts promotions, future earning power, and their roles as leaders at risk. Ironically, in fall 2019, Chen co-authored a study on the gender pay gap at Ohio State. She took on the project after fighting and winning her own pay equity case, resulting in a 20% bump in her salary. Chen found that female professors at the university earn 11% less than their male counterparts, translating to a loss of close to $18,000 a year. In 2020, because of the pandemic, Chen missed out on grant opportunities and had to turn down collaborations. She didn’t submit any papers for publication. Her research was on indefinite hold. \"That's something that's going to ripple out through your entire career,\" Chen says. The unequal division of household labor in families gives rise to not just the \"mom penalty\" but the \"dad premium.\" Driven by the biological clock, women take time off or cut back on their hours just as their careers are taking off, while men carry on their work and move up.\n\nOctober 19, 2021 – U.S. Assistant Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine made history when she was promoted, the first openly transgender four-star officer in any of the eight U.S. uniformed services. Levine, already the nation's most senior transgender official, said she was \"honored to take this role for the impact I can make and for the historic nature of what it symbolizes,\" adding, \"I stand on the shoulders of those LGBTQ+ individuals who came before me, both those known and unknown. May this appointment today be the first of many more to come, as we create a diverse and more inclusive future.\" Levine, a pediatrician, previously served as Pennsylvania's health secretary, and has addressed issues like the opioid epidemic, maternal mortality, and childhood immunization.\n\n____________________________\n\nOctober 20, 1740 – Isabelle de Charrière born, aka Belle van Zuylen, Dutch Enlightenment author who never married; noted for novels and letters, but also penned pamphlets, plays, and music; corresponded with writers like James Boswell and Benjamin Constant; her first novel, Le Noble, a satire against the nobility, was published anonymously when she was 43 years old, but her identity was soon discovered, and her parents withdrew the work from sale.\n\nOctober 20, 1832 – Ellen Hardin Walworth born, author, lawyer, historic preservationist, early advocate for establishing the U. S. National Archives. One of the first women in New York State to hold a position on a local board of education, a role she used to bolster the call for women's suffrage.\n\nOctober 20, 1862 – Maud Nathan born, social worker, advocate for working women, stalwart suffragist, and notable speaker much admired for her sense of humor. She was a co-founder and second president (1897-1917) of the Consumers’ League of New York. In 1912, she headed the women’s suffrage committee of Theodore Roosevelt's National Progressive Party Bull Moose campaign. She frequently clashed with her sister, Annie Nathan Meyer (a founder of Barnard College), who advocated for higher education for women, but was as much against women winning the right to vote as Maud Nathan was in favor of it. They were cousins of poet Emma Lazarus, and of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo. Both sisters tried to influence Cardozo.\n\nOctober 20, 1862 – Nellie McClung born, Canadian politician, activist, Liberal member of Legislative Assembly of Alberta (1921-26), one of Canada’s ‘Famous Five’ in the Persons’ Case.\n\nOctober 20, 1873 – Frances Alice Kellor born, American social reformer, investigative reporter, and sociologist, who studied prisons, immigration, and the treatment of women in education and the workforce. She did field work in women’s prisons, at Hull House in Chicago, and in educational institutions. Her works include Experimental Sociology: Descriptive and Analytical; Athletic Games in the Education of Women; Immigration and the Future; and The Federal Administration and the Alien. Her articles appeared in both academic journals and popular publications like the Atlantic Monthly and The New York Herald. She was chief investigator for the Bureau of Industries and Immigration of New York State (1910-1913), and worked on Theodore Roosevelt’s 1912 presidential campaign, using her expertise on immigration to help formulate the Progressive Party’s platform. She had a long-term relationship with Mary Dreier, another social reformer, until Kellor’s death at age 72 in 1952. They are buried side-by-side in a Brooklyn cemetery.\n\nOctober 20, 1901 – Adelaide Hall born, African American jazz singer, pioneer in scat singing, musician, and dancer. Born in Brooklyn, she became a notable figure in the Harlem Renaissance, including making recordings of “Creole Love Call” and “Chicago Stomp Down” with Duke Ellington and his orchestra, and appeared on Broadway with ‘Bojangles’ Robinson in Blackbirds of 1928. In the 1930s, she was in Chocolate Soldiers, a revue at the Apollo Theater, and The Cotton Club Parade at Harlem’s famed Cotton Club. After a national tour of the U.S., she arrived in Paris in 1935, and opened her own nightclub, La Grosse Pomme (The Big Apple), where she appeared until 1938, then moved to London to star in The Sun Never Sets at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. She was so popular there that she remained in London from then on, and was still performing in 1992. In 1993, Hall died in London at age 92. She was buried next to her mother in a Brooklyn cemetery.\n\nOctober 20, 1904 – Enolia Pettigen McMillan born, African American high school teacher and principal, civil rights activist, and community leader; President of Maryland’s State Colored Teachers’ Association; first woman to chair the Morgan State University Board of Regents; first woman president of the NAACP (1984-1990).\n\nOctober 20, 1927 – Joyce Brothers born, American psychologist, author, television personality; columnist for Good Housekeeping magazine for almost 40 years.\n\nOctober 20, 1937 – Byllye Avery born, African American women’s healthcare and reproductive justice activist and advocate. In 1974, she was a co-founder of the Gainesville Women’s Health Center, the first abortion and gynecological care clinic in the city, which offered services at low cost, and specific services for black women, like sickle cell anemia testing. In 1978, Avery helped to found Birthplace, an alternative birthing center in Gainesville, where certified nurse-midwives assisted women with deliveries. In 1984, she initiated, and was a founder, of the National Black Women’s Health Project (now the Black Women’s Health Imperative). NBWHP was the first national organization to focus exclusively on the health and wellness of black women and girls. Along with prominent African-American leaders like Shirley Chisholm, Maxine Waters, Dorothy Height, and Faye Wattleton, she signed a public statement, \"We Remember: African American Women for Reproductive Freedom” in 1989. The statement supports reproductive freedom (including the right to have children, the right to access to contraceptive services, and to reproductive health information, and the right to health care as well as safe and legal abortions). The statement connected racism, poverty, and violence to negative reproductive health outcomes for African American women.\n\nOctober 20, 1942 – Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard born, German developmental biologist; she was co-winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her work on identifying genes involved in embryonic development, which revolutionized the field of developmental genetics.

They were initially introduced as part of the broader Women’s Equality Agenda long championed by the New York Civil Liberties Union. NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman stated, “We applaud Governor Cuomo for signing into law eight bills that provide important protections for the equal rights of women. These bills include provisions that promote pay equity, prohibit certain forms of housing discrimination, and protect against pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. By closing significant loopholes in the existing legal framework for women's rights and affirming our state’s commitment to equality, the bills signed today lay the foundation for further, future reforms. We have more work to do to ensure that New York’s women can participate fully and equally in society. As states around the country turn back the clock and deny women reproductive rights, it is more important than ever that New York acts as a leader and stands up for progress by updating our abortion law and unequivocally protecting women's fundamental rights to decide to end a pregnancy under Roe v. Wade. Women’s equality also requires statewide paid family leave, so that new mothers are not forced to choose between taking time off from work to care for a newborn and being able to pay the bills. The legislation signed into law today will provide New York’s women with additional tools to assert their rights.” In August, 2021, Andrew Cuomo resigned from office as governor amidst multiple accusations of sexual harassment.\n\nOctober 20, 2019 – English poet Fiona Benson’s second collection, Vertigo & Ghost, won the prestigious £10,000 Forward prize for best poetry collection.

Next employs 15,000 store workers in over 400 stores in the UK and Ireland. The original 330 shop workers involved in the claim, who are mostly women, argued their work is no less demanding than that of their male colleagues in the warehouses who, on average, earn between £2 and £6 more per hour. By August, 2021, the number of shop workers involved in the appeal grew to over 400, and Next conceded the two types of roles can be compared, the first step in a three-step process for equal pay claims. The retailer needed to show that the jobs are not of equal value, or if they are of equal value, there is a reason other than gender why the two groups of workers are not paid equally. The legal action against Next began in 2018 when a claim was filed with the conciliation service Acas. In May 2023, store employees, now 4,000 strong, won their second stage in the legal battle when the Employment Tribunal ruled unanimously that their store jobs are equal to those of warehouse workers. For the third and final hearing, which will probably take place in March 2024, Next must provide a compelling reason other than gender why store staff should not be paid on the same scale as warehouse workers.\n\nOctober 20, 2021 – Dr. Tlaleng Mofokeng, UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health, reminded Member States in the General Assembly that sexual and reproductive health rights are human rights. “Millions of women globally had limited or no access to maternal and new-born healthcare, some 14 million women lost access to contraception, and specialized services for victims of gender-based violence became inaccessible, when they were needed most,” she said, pointing out that lockdowns, movement restrictions, and diversion of funds due to COVID-19 have “jeopardized access to essential sexual and reproductive health services.” In her presentation on the pandemic’s effect on mental and physical health services worldwide, she spoke of “new measures and laws in place across regions, further restricting access to safe abortion, a component of sexual and reproductive services encompassed in the right to health.” She called on States to rebuild and strengthen health systems: “Governments must remove obstacles and ensure full access to quality services, including maternal health care, contraception and abortion services, screening for reproductive cancers, and comprehensive sexual education.” She added, “Patriarchal oppression is universal, permeates all societies and is at the very origin of the erosion of autonomy and the control of girls and women’s bodies and sexuality to the detriment of their enjoyment of sexual and reproductive rights … Colonialism has permeated patriarchy across regions and its legacy continues today through laws, policies, and practices that deny or restrict sexual and reproductive rights, and criminalize gender diverse identities and consensual adult same-sex acts.”\n\n____________________________\n\nOctober 21, 1854 – Florence Nightingale and a staff of 38 nurses leave Britain for Scutari, in the Ottoman Empire, to tend sick or wounded British soldiers during the Crimean War.\n\nOctober 21, 1896 – Esther Shumiatcher-Hirschbein born in Belorussia, Canadian Yiddish poet, playwright, and screenwriter; after her marriage in 1918 to New York Yiddish playwright Peretz Hirschbein, she moved to New York, where she published two children’s plays intended for use in the Yiddish secular schools.

I thought people would be kind of bustling in and out as I try to read poetry because, as I'm sure most people know, it's hard to get an audience for poetry at the best of times.” After she recited her poem, “Nursing the Nation” the entire stadium leapt up and gave her a standing ovation.

Loujain campaigned to end Saudi Arabia’s ban on women driving, and the system of male guardianship which effectively relegates women to the legal status of minor children, requiring permission from male relatives who act as lifelong guardians for many activities and decisions. She was arrested in a crackdown against women’s rights activists in May, 2018, ironically just before the ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia was lifted. Her sister Lina charges little has changed since her sister’s arrest, saying: “The only thing that has changed is Saudi Arabia’s image in the West. There is no place for reform at all. All the reformers are behind bars and my sister is one of them. What Saudi Arabia wants is to whitewash all the rights violations.” In December 2020, Loujain was sentenced to five years, 8 months after being found guilty of “spying with foreign parties and conspiring against the kingdom.” The court suspended two years and 10 months of her sentence, and backdated the start of her jail term to May 2018, so she had three months left to serve. Loujain al-Hathloul was finally released from prison after a total of 1,001 days of captivity, but the court imposed three years of probation, during which she cannot speak her mind or return to activism without risking being returned to prison, plus a five-year ban on travel outside Saudi Arabia.
