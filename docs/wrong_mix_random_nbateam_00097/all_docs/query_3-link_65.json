        "text": "A long-time member of the Tribe men’s soccer program, Chris Norris heads into his 34th season overall at the College and his 21st as the program’s head men’s soccer coach in 2024. A 1995 graduate of William & Mary, Norris has significantly impacted the program’s history of success.\n\nDuring Norris’ time as a player, assistant and head coach, the Tribe owns six of its eight Colonial Athletic Association Championships (1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2010, 2017) and 13 of the program’s 16 NCAA Tournament appearances (1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2008, 2010, 2013, 2017).\n\nNorris has guided the Tribe to the NCAA Tournament four times as head coach (2008, 2010, 2013, 2017), including a berth in the Sweet Sixteen in 2010. He has led the Green and Gold to winning seasons in eight the past 14 seasons, including 12 and 11 victories in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Norris’ program won CAA Championships in both 2010 and 2017. Norris owns a CAA Coach of the Year honor, a Region Coach of the Year accolade and two Virginia Sports Information Directors (VaSID) State Coach of the Year nods.\n\nIn his 20 years at the helm of the Tribe, Norris has coached 66 All-Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) honorees and 25 CAA All-Rookie team selections. In 2009, Andrew Hoxie became the first player to be name CAA Player of the Year under the tutelage of Norris. In 2013, Norris helped guide Will Smith to CAA Defensive Player of the Year honors.\n\nIn 2017, the Tribe captured its eighth CAA Championship, upending UNCW, 4-2, in the title match. W&M put together a 10-match unbeaten streak (7-0-3) at the end of the season, the longest since a school-record 18 in 1996. The Tribe also downed a pair of ACC opponents in N.C. State and Virginia Tech, both of which qualified for the NCAA Tournament. Norris earned the VaSID State Coach of the Year in 2010 as well. The Tribe hosted a first round NCAA Tournament at Martin Family Stadium for the fourth time in the last 10 years and finished the campaign at 11-5-5.\n\nAntonio Bustamante was a consensus All-American along with being named the CAA and VaSID State Player of the Year. A total of three players have earned All-American during Norris' tenure. Bustamante produced two hat tricks, including a school-record four goals vs. Hofstra in the quarterfinals, to earn the Most Outstanding Performer of the CAA Championship.\n\nThe Tribe produced an Academic All-American for the sixth time under Norris as Ryder Bell earned third-team honors in 2018. Bell excelled on the pitch as well as the field, earning All-CAA First Team and All-Midwest Region Third Team distinction.\n\nW&M reeled off an exciting finish to the 2016 season as the Tribe won five of its last six matches and advanced to the 2016 CAA title match. The Green and Gold won 12 matches, the most since 2010, and had a pair of five-match winning streaks. W&M started CAA Tournament play with a 1-0 win at Elon, before, topping top-seed and host Hofstra 3-1 in the semifinals. Individually, W&M had seven players honored with All-CAA awards, led by Bustamante, who was a first-team selection. William Eskay (third-team) and Bell (third-team) and Bustamante (first-team) earned NSCAA All-Region honors.\n\nThe 2015 season will go down as the foundation for the future success of the program. The Tribe returns 21 of the 24 players from last year's team. Despite being young, W&M still held its own again against nationally ranked competition defeating No. 10 Elon 4-1 and tying No. 4 North Carolina on the road. The Tribe finished 7-8-2 on the season, but saw six players earn nine all-conference awards. Berry led the way as he was named CAA Rookie of the Year and to the league's second-team. The Tribe returns four of its six all-conference honorees for the 2016 season. Following the season, Jackson Eskay, who was an All-CAA Second-Team selection, inked a professional contract with the Richmond Kickers.\n\nIn 2014, Norris earned his 100th career win as the Tribe's head coach in a 1-0 victory at Northeastern on Oct. 25. Under his guidance four Tribe players earned All-Colonial Athletic Association honors, including senior Michael Teiman, who was tabbed to the second team.\n\nAfter a tough 2012 season, Norris and the Tribe men’s soccer program rebounded with a huge 2013 campaign. The Green and Gold posted a seven-win turnaround, finishing the season with an 11-5-3 mark, an appearance in the CAA Title game, and hosted an NCAA Tournament against George Mason. W&M returned to the national rankings, getting as high as No. 21. W&M’s nationally ranking and at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament were sparked by three victories over top 25 teams, including No. 1, twice, in a 10-day span in September. Following the regular season, Will Smith was named CAA Defensive Player of the Year, while Smith and Marcus Luster earned First-Team honors. Four other players received all-conference honors following the season.\n\nIn 2011, the Tribe posted its fifth-consecutive winning season under the direction of Norris as it finished the year with a record of 10-9 and mark of 7-4 in the CAA. The College started the season ranked 13th in the nation and climbed to to 8th in the country after defeating No. 5th-ranked SMU, 3-2, on Aug. 27, in Dallas, Texas. Under the watch of Norris, Nicolas Abrigo was selected to the CAA First-Team, while Will Smith garnered second-team accolades. Freshmen Marcus Luster and Michael Teiman were selected to the league all-rookie team under the guidance of Norris in 2011.\n\nThe 2010 season was a fantastic one for the Tribe and Norris, as the College advanced to the third round of the NCAA Tournament. Norris also guided the Tribe to the CAA regular season and tournament titles. In 2010, Norris led the Tribe to a 15-3-2 overall record with a mark of 8-1-2 in conference play. The 15 victories in 2010 were the most for the College since the 2002 season, while the CAA championship was the seventh in school history. The Tribe's advancement to the third round of the NCAA Tournament marked the eighth time that the College had reached the Sweet Sixteen in school history, the first since the 2002 campaign.\n\nFor his efforts, Norris was named not only the CAA Coach of the Year in 2010, but he was also honored as the NSCAA South Atlantic Region Coach of the Year. Both accolades are the first for Norris in his coaching career. Norris' South Atlantic Region Coach of the Year honor is the fourth in the history of the program and Norris becomes just the second Tribe coach to earn the award. Former head coach Al Albert was a three-time region coach of the year honoree.\n\nAlso in 2010, Norris saw two of his players earn impressive individual honors. Senior Nat Baako was honored as a Second-Team All-American by the NSCAA and also became the first player in William and Mary history to be named the NSCAA Senior College Men's Scholar All-America National Player of the Year. Classmate Alan Koger had a great season in 2010, culminating with him being taken by the New England Revolution in the third round of the 2011 MLS SuperDraft.\n\nThe 2009 season was a memorable one for Norris and the Tribe, as the College finished the season with a 13-5-1 record overall and a mark of 8-2-1 in the CAA, tying the Green and Gold for second in the league. The Tribe reached the national rankings in October, reaching the 25th spot in the NSCAA poll after starting the season 8-3, including a win over #20 Old Dominion at Albert-Daly Field. The 13 wins was the most for the Tribe since the 2002 season, and the eight conference victories matched the school record set back during the 1996 season. Individually, Andrew Hoxie was named the CAA Player of the Year, the first Tribe player to earn the accolade since Wade Barrett in 1997. Among numerous honors, Hoxie was named a Third-Team All-American by the NSCAA and in the winter, was drafted in the third round of the MLS SuperDraft. Joining Hoxie on All-CAA teams were Nat Baako (1st), Roger Bothe (2nd), Alan Koger (2nd), Price Thomas (3rd), and Caleb Thomas (Rookie).\n\nIn 2008, the Tribe had a fantastic campaign that saw the College finish the year with a 11-7-3 record and a 6-4-1 record in the CAA. With its record W&M earned the No. 2 seed in the conference tournament, the highest the Green and Gold have ever been seeded under Norris. Despite losing in the semi-finals of the CAA tournament, the College earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, marking the 13th time William and Mary had earned an invite to the tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Tribe hosted Winthrop and soundly defeated the Eagles, 3-1, advancing to the second round of the championship for the sixth time in the program’s history. The College would then travel to take on No. 1-seeded and defending national champion Wake Forest. The Tribe played the Deacons valiantly before falling to the eventual national semi-finalist in overtime.\n\nThe 2007 season saw the Tribe turn in some impressive performances, further validating the program’s high expectations for the future. Despite starting five freshmen for the majority of the 2007 campaign, W&M posted its best CAA league record since 2002. The Tribe finished the year at 6-4-1 in league play and advanced to the CAA Quarterfinals after missing out the previous two years. The Tribe also posted back-to-back ties against national and ACC powers North Carolina, 0-0, and Virginia Tech, 1-1, during the month of September. The Hokies went on to finish the year with a No. 3 national ranking after advancing to the NCAA College Cup semifinals. W&M started a school-record six freshmen on a pair of occasions in 2007 and set a program-best mark for shutouts in CAA play with six.\n\nIt is not the first time the Tribe have reached new heights under Norris’ direction, as W&M posted the program’s first ever victory over a No. 1-ranked opponent in 2004. Norris took over the post as head coach at the College following the retirement of long-time, legendary coach Al Albert. Norris spent nine seasons as a Tribe assistant and four years as a standout defender for the Green and Gold before being named head coach on Jan. 23, 2004.\n\nThe Tribe rebounded from a tough 2005 campaign to post a 8-8-3 mark during the 2006 season. W&M won the ODU Stihl Soccer Classic with victories over No. 29 UNC Greensboro, 5-1, and Loyola (Md.), 2-1. It marked the first time since the 1998 season the College had captured the event crown. The Tribe also posted a pair of ties against nationally-ranked foes in No. 22 George Mason, 0-0, and No. 23 James Madison, 2-2, during the 2006 ledger.\n\nThe 2006 season also saw a Tribe appearance on television. The College’s contest against Old Dominion on Oct. 26 was part of the NSCAA/Fox Soccer Channel College Game of the Week. It was the first Tribe game on TV since the 1996 season.\n\nDuring Norris’ first season leading the Tribe, the team extended its streak of consecutive winning seasons to 30, which ranks sixth in NCAA Division I history. W&M went 5-1-3 in its first year at Albert-Daly Field. In just the program’s second game at the facility, Norris guided the Tribe to a 1-0 victory over then-No. 1 and eventual College Cup semifinalist Maryland on Sept. 22. The shutout was one of only two Maryland suffered during the 2004 season that saw the Terps finish the year ranked fifth nationally in scoring offense.\n\nAfter dropping the season opener in Norris’ first year at the helm in 2004, the Tribe went unbeaten over its next seven contests (5-0-2), including the victory over Maryland. The unbeaten streak was the longest for the College since the 1999 squad won eight-straight contests from Oct. 23 through Nov. 14.\n\nThe Green and Gold allowed opponents to score just 21 goals in 2004, the fewest since 1999, resulting in a 0.99 goals against average for the team. Four W&M players earned All-Colonial Athletic Association honors, including first-team selection Pat Scherder, who also earned all-state and second-team all-region accolades.\n\nNorris joined the Tribe soccer staff in 1995 after a solid playing career at the College. He made the transition from the field to the sideline and played a major role in helping former head coach Al Albert develop one of the premier soccer programs in America.\n\nDuring his time as an assistant, the Tribe compiled a 128-62-16 (.660) record with seven NCAA Tournament appearances, four CAA tournament championships and three CAA regular season crowns. Norris also saw 32 players earn All-CAA honors, 30 earn all-state accolades, seven All-America honors, two CAA Players of the Year, one CAA Defensive Player of the Year, one CAA Rookie of the Year and five Major League Soccer draft picks. Of those five players selected to play at the highest level in the United States, three were first round selections, including Steve Jolley, Wade Barrett and Adin Brown, all of which have gone on to long and distinguished professional careers.\n\nA captain his senior year, Norris was the team’s defensive leader, starting all four seasons (1991-94). During his career, W&M compiled an impressive 1.04 goals against average, including two seasons (1992 and 1994) with a team GAA of less than 1.00. During both the 1992 and 1994 seasons, Norris led the Tribe to the top of the CAA regular season standings.\n\nHe was a two-time All-CAA performer and was also selected to the VaSID All-State squad and the All-South Atlantic second team in 1994. The team’s Most Valuable Player as a junior, Norris received the Coaches’ Award in 1992 and earned W&M Rookie of the Year honors in 1991. Norris also earned the team’s Freshman Academic Achievement Award in 1991 and graduated from the College with a degree in kinesiology.\n\nPrior to his return to William and Mary, Norris served as junior varsity boys’ soccer coach at Lafayette High School in Williamsburg. Along with his coaching duties for the Tribe, Norris is involved in coaching with the Virginia Legacy Soccer Club and serves as the director of the Colonial Kicks Soccer Camp. He holds a National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) premier diploma and serves as an associate staff member for the NSCAA.\n\nThe Norris File\n\nAlma Mater: William and Mary, 1994\n\nHometown: Fairfax, Va.\n\nEducation: 1995, Bachelor’s in kinesiology from W&M\n\nProfile\n\nAs a Player\n\n• Played in 84 games with 81 starts from 1991 through 1994\n\n• Scored three goals and 16 assists in career as a defender\n\n• Team compiled a 56-20-11 (.707) record and a 1.04 GAA in four years\n\n• Led team to a then-school record 18 wins in 1994\n\n• NCAA Tournament appearances in 1992 and 1993\n\n• First-Team All-CAA (1993 and 1994)\n\n• First-Team all-state (1994)\n\n• Second-Team All-South Atlantic Region (1994)\n\n• W&M Most Valuable Player (1993)\n\n• W&M Coaches Award (1992)\n\n• W&M Best Rookie and Freshman Academic Achievement Awards (1991)\n\nAs an Assistant Coach\n\n• Helped lead W&M to a 128-62-16 (.660) record over nine seasons (1995-2003)\n\n• Four CAA titles\n\n• Seven NCAA Tournament appearances\n\n• In 1996 the team set a school record for wins (20) and winning percentage (.854), recorded the only perfect season in CAA history (8-0-0) and reached the quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament\n\nAs a Head Coach - since 2004\n\n• Led W&M to a 159-149-55 (.514) record in his 20 seasons\n\n• Guided the Tribe to a pair of CAA Championships in 2010 and 2017\n\n• Named CAA Coach of the Year and NSCAA South Atlantic Region Coach of the Year in 2010\n\n• Led the Tribe to the Sweet Sixteen in 2010, ending the season ranked No. 9 in the country\n\n• Led the Tribe to four NCAA Tournament appearances (2008, 2010, 2013, 2017)\n\n• Has coached three All-Americans, two CAA Players of the Year, one CAA Defensive Player of the Year, one CAA Rookie of the Year, 22 All-Region selections, 66 All-CAA players, and 25 all-rookie selections\n\n• Academically, Norris-coached players have earned seven Academic All-America honors and his team own eight United Soccer Coaches Team Academic Awards"
