        "text": "Unconditionally Loving Ourselves and Others is Heroic\n\nOfficially: I’m a licensed professional counselor supporting individuals in healing and thriving. I guide people in reconnecting to their innate wisdom and strength to heal from traumas, including neglect, abuse, assault, loss, and other challenging life experiences. Unconditionally loving ourselves and others includes setting healthy boundaries and expressing one’s truth.\n\nBottom Line: I believe you are whole, vital, powerful, and wise. I know you have everything within you that you need to thrive. While I do have an assortment of techniques and tools, you are the one doing the powerful and intense work. While it can be intense, the rewards are absolutely worth the investment. It’s very similar to training for a race, as trainings can be intense, yet before you know it, you are crossing that finish line or are more deeply loving and accepting yourself and thriving.\n\nHow I work with clients: I work collaboratively with you, utilizing trauma informed, experiential, and mindfulness approaches. I offer a complimentary consultation session, where I want us both to interview each other. I encourage all people seeking professional support to interview their providers and make sure they resonate with the person and their approach. If you email me at Laura@CirclesEdge.Life, I will send you my guide on interviewing providers.\n\nPsychedelic Integration Therapy: Psychedelics are powerful tools, and experiences include profoundly inspiring to terrifying. No matter what arose for you in the psychedelic space, I believe it arose for you as you have the strength and capacity to handle it now. You may have vividly relived repressed memories and felt the terror in your body or you may have felt more peace and love than you thought possible. After these intense experiences you may have found it easier to leave behind substances that provide a numbing effect like alcohol or opioids, or you may find yourself craving numbing substances even more. Processing and integrating psychedelic experiences can be easier with experienced support, and I’m here to support you along this journey.\n\nHappy Thursday!\n\nHere’s a weekly dose of forethoughts; four ideas I’m believing may benefit our future. Thank you for being a close friend of mine and interested in this content! I’d love to hear your thoughts about what you like and what’s useful to you, and even more importantly, let’s stay connected. You all rock! Sending you each love.\n\nGifting (one of the 10 Principles of Burning Man): The way gratitude is shared after receiving a gift at Burning Man made a massive impact on me. People shared such joy after biting into a peach that we had hand picked from an orchard. The gratitude the psychedelic peer support sitters shared with me after I had served as a team lead and I did my best to provide them balance, calm, and connection during their volunteer experience. I’m incorporating ways to continue gifting in my life and also increasing the gratitude I feel and share after receiving a gift. What are gifts you’ve received or given that have made a massive impact on you? How can we incorporate the felt experience of gifting into our daily lives?\n\nJohn Hopkins Opens New Center for Psychedelic Research: Psychedelics, a medicine traditionally used for it’s healing properties for probably close to 5,000 years, has now gained enough science research for donors to contribute $17 million, including Tim Ferriss, to support “psychedelic medicine” gain a long-sought foothold in the scientific establishment. The article has some great stories in how it’s impacted people.\n\nQuote I’m pondering: “Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite powers of our light” by Brene Brown. Our society seems to be significantly more adept at supporting the healing of those that have been harmed, while having less know-how to support those that have harmed or are thinking about harming others. I’ve recently embarked on some journeys to heal the parts of me that have harmed others. It’s been intense work, and I connected to some dark places in me that felt completely powerless and in darkness. I also felt a connection to the void that people who’ve caused a lot of pain to others may be in. Exploring and healing our darkness may be some of the most important work we can do.\n\n3 Group Therapy Check-In Exercises– This is part of my 12 subject series I’m releasing on group therapy skills. If you’re a therapist looking for additional group therapy tools or an individual wanting to build emotional fitness, check out these three videos on exercises for when clients appear “challenging”: 3 Chair, Free Will, The Work by Byron Katie\n\n********************************************************************************************\n\nWhat I’m Doing Now (with thanks to Derek Sivers)\n\nAfter Burning Man, I was able to spend a few days near Crater Lake integrating what my partner and I wanted to take away from Burning Man. I’ve discovered that after peak learning opportunities, such as therapist trainings, personal development workshops, or events like Burning Man, when I’m able to take several hour to a day or two to reflect upon and write about the experience it seems to substantially benefitting my life years later. When I immediately jump back into a busy work and life schedule, I seem to not remember what I learned from these experiences. When possible, taking the time to reflect and integrate these experiences may deeply enhance growth.\n\n********************************************************************************************\n\nReady to get your group warmed up and willing to dive into doing deep work?

These concepts will be around the topic of emotional well-being. Please let me know your questions and or ideas! I would love to cover them in a future issue.\n\nThe First Psychedelic Assisted Psychotherapy TED Talk – While you may have heard me speak a lot about the efficacy of psychedelic assisted psychotherapy, this talk is by Rich Dublin. For 30 years, he’s been heading the science into getting psychedelic assisted psychotherapy accepted by the western scientific model. It’s a great talk, check it out if you or loved ones are affected by trauma, anxiety, or depression.\n\n3 Group Therapy Check-In Exercises – This is part of my 12 week video series I’m releasing on group therapy skills. If you’re a therapist looking for additional group therapy tools or an individual wanting to build emotional fitness, check out these three videos: Keys, Environment, Toys\n\nTrauma and Leadership – A recent paper stated “Collective traumas and the development of leader values is a currently omitted, but increasingly urgent, research area”. Trauma, both small and large, separates us from ourselves and others, and has a substantial impact on teams. It’s vital that we support everyone, including our leaders, in healing trauma.\n\nQuote I’m Pondering: “What if we stopped celebrating being busy as a measurement of importance? What if instead we celebrated how much time we had spent listening, pondering, meditating, and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives?”\n\nA Navy SEAL slogan is “Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.”\n\nI’ve been working on this lesson for awhile. I was sedentary the first 20+ years of my life; I avoided physical discomfort at all costs. Then in my 20’s, I started getting physically fit, yet the pendulum swung too far. I realized I could push myself through discomfort, yet also pushed myself through the warning pains from my body. I spent years in recovery going to different specialists to relieve the pain from damage.\n\nI recently picked up running again on a trip to Hawaii. I felt so amazing after the first few runs, and I wanted that amazing feeling to stick around. Though pain from previous injuries started coming up on the following runs. This time I listened, even though a piece of me didn’t want to. On several runs, I switched to walking, took frequent stretch breaks, or turned around early. A couple weeks of listening to my body and I’m quicker than I was when I started. I’m allowing myself to deeply let in the message that slowing down and listening to my body allows me to go do the things I desire.\n\nI believe slowing down can allow so many things to flourish, especially relationships, whether it’s your relationship with self or others.\n\nIn what way could you slow down to flourish?"
