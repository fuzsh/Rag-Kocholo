        "text": "Presidency of Laura Montez January 20, 2017 – January 20, 2021 Vice President Unknown Election 2016 ← Selina Meyer • Selina Meyer → Seal of the President\n\nThis article is part of a series about\n\nLaura Montez President of the United States\n\nPresidency (Timeline)\n\nInauguration • Independence of Tibet • Nobel Peace Prize • Hughes Supreme Court nomination • 2018 government shutdown Vice presidential campaigns\n\n2016 (Selection, Contingent election) Presidential campaigns\n\n2020 (Chinese interference)\n\nFor a chronological guide to this subject, see Timeline of the Laura Montez presidency.\n\nThe presidency of Laura Priscilla Montez lasted from January 20, 2017 to January 20, 2021. Laura Montez became president after the tied 2016 presidential election and the tied vote in the House that resulted from it.\n\nDuring her tenure as president, Montez reached across party lines to fulfill a Supreme Court vacancy, nominating former president Stuart Hughes to succeed the late Justice Tenny. Montez was also able to navigate the 2018 government shutdown, wherein a coalition of congresspeople known as the Jeffersons struck down a debt-ceiling bill and demanded that the government eradicate daylight savings. Montez's presidency also boasted a flourishing economy.\n\nMontez was awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize after the freeing of Tibet earlier that year when it was actually Selina Meyer who had negotiated Tibet's independence. Meyer's role in the mediations weren't revealed until October 2018, wherein Montez was condemned for assuming credit for the negotiations she had no participation in. This controversy likely had a large impact on her unsuccessful re-election bid in the 2020 presidential election, which she lost to Meyer.\n\nPresidential election of 2016[]\n\nSee also: 2016 United States presidential election\n\nMontez was selected in the summer of 2016 to serve as Arizona Senator Bill O'Brien's running mate in the 2016 presidential election. On November 8, 2016, the Electoral College gridlocked at a 269-269 tie between O'Brien and President Selina Meyer. The O'Brien-Montez ticket narrowly won the national popular vote by a margin of less than 10,000 votes.\n\nThe 2017 contingent election failed to elect a president between O'Brien and Meyer. The Senate vice presidential vote on January 5 elected Laura Montez to become the vice president-elect, and because of the presidential vacancy, the de facto president-elect.\n\nInauguration[]\n\nSee also: Inauguration of Laura Montez\n\nThe inauguration of Laura Montez was held on January 20, 2017, at the U.S. Capitol. During Montez's inaugural address, CNN reported that China had officially freed Tibet. This was considered to be one of the first successes of the Montez administration even though it was Meyer who negotiated Tibet's independence.\n\nAdministration[]\n\nCabinet[]\n\nThe Montez Administration Office Name Term President Laura Montez 2017–2021 Vice President Unknown 2017–2021 Secretary of State Andrew Doyle 2017–2021 Secretary of the Treasury Charlie Baird 2017–2021 Chief of Staff Candi Caruso 2017–2021 Personal Aide John Corbin 2017–2021 Personal Secretary Sue Wilson 2017–2021\n\nSoon after winning the Senate vote on January 5, Montez announced that Andrew Doyle, vice president under Selina Meyer, would become Secretary of State. The deal was orchestrated behind the scenes, as Doyle maneuvered the Senate vote in exchange for Secretary of State, as an act of revenge when Meyer offered Secretary of State to opposition Congressman Paul Graves.\n\nOn January 19, 2017, MSNBC reported that Charlie Baird, a banker who briefly dated President Meyer in late 2016, was tapped by Montez to become the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nJudicial appointments[]\n\nSee also: Stuart Hughes Supreme Court nomination\n\nJustice Tenny died in late February/early March 2018. Tenny's funeral was held on March 5 in Washington, D.C. After the funeral, Meyer's associate Mike McLintock piqued the interest of the press when he implied Meyer was under consideration for the vacant Supreme Court seat.\n\nOn March 7, 2018, President Montez delivered a press conference where she announced her intention to reach across the aisle to nominate a justice. On March 13, CBS This Morning reported that Montez had selected former president Stuart Hughes to fulfill the Supreme Court vacancy. Hughes was confirmed by the Senate and assumed his position on the Supreme Court.\n\n2018 government shutdown[]\n\nSee also: 2018 United States federal government shutdown\n\nPresident Montez held a meeting in the Oval Office with House Speaker Jim Marwood and Minority Leader Roger Furlong and others on July 11, 2018. The three amicably reached a deal to get a bill signed to raise the debt ceiling. Meanwhile, Congressman Jonah Ryan, bitter that he didn't get an invitation to former President Selina Meyer's portrait unveiling, wanted his coalition of Jeffersons to do something bold to get the attention of the political elite. On July 13, the Jeffersons voted against the bill agreed to by both Marwood and Furlong to raise the debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Charlie Baird declared a government shutdown that day.\n\nThe shutdown lasted 25 days. On August 6, 2018, President Montez made a deal with Congressman Clarence Clark and his newly formed \"Libertonians\" to end the shutdown. The Libertonians contained members of the Jeffersons, sans Ryan.\n\nTibetan independence controversy[]\n\nSee also: Independence of Tibet\n\nDuring Montez's inaugural address on January 20, 2017, CNN reported that Montez had brokered a deal with the Chinese government to free Tibet. In actuality, former president Selina Meyer had spent weeks negotiating Tibet's independence. Montez accepted the credit for the independent Tibet and accepted the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize in December 2017.\n\nIn October 2018, reporter Leon West broke a story featuring leaked journal entries from Meyer's archivist Mike McLintock outlining the extent of Meyer's involvement in the Tibet negotiations. The revelation that Montez had nothing to do with the negotiations yet accepted credit hurt her popularity going into the 2020 presidential election.\n\nElections during the Montez presidency[]\n\n2018 midterm elections[]\n\nSee also: 2018 United States elections\n\nUnusual for midterm elections, Montez's held on to control in the House of Representatives in the 2018 congressional elections, and considering the closeness of the 2016 congressional elections, likely gained seats in the House.\n\n2020 presidential election[]\n\nSee also: 2020 United States presidential election\n\nMontez sought re-election in the 2020 presidential election. The Chinese government was interfering in the 2020 election to ensure a Montez presidency, until Selina Meyer offered the return of Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. The Chinese then assisted Meyer's presidential campaign against Montez's re-election bid. On November 3, Montez was defeated by former president Meyer and her running mate Jonah Ryan.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nInauguration\n\nOmaha\n\nLibrary\n\nGeorgia\n\nJustice\n\nChicklet\n\nQatar\n\nBlurb\n\nJudge\n\nA Woman First\n\nGroundbreaking\n\nIowa\n\nDiscovery Weekend\n\nPledge\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSuper Tuesday\n\nOslo\n\nVeep (episode)"
