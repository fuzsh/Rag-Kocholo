        "text": "2017 Nobel Peace Prize ← 2016 • Nobel Peace Prize • 2018 →\n\nThis article is part of a series about\n\nLaura Montez President of the United States\n\nPresidency (Timeline)\n\nInauguration • Independence of Tibet • Nobel Peace Prize • Hughes Supreme Court nomination • 2018 government shutdown Vice presidential campaigns\n\n2016 (Selection, Contingent election) Presidential campaigns\n\n2020 (Chinese interference)\n\nThe 2017 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to United States President Laura Montez for her work in the 2017 freeing of Tibet. Montez accepted the prize in Oslo in December 2017 where she delivered a speech.\n\nMontez is the fourth president of the United States to have won the Nobel Peace Prize (after Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Jimmy Carter, with Carter's honor happening after leaving office).\n\nControversy[]\n\nWhen Tibet was freed on January 20, 2017, the assumption was that it had been because of the Montez administration. In actuality, Montez's predecessor, Selina Meyer, had been negotiating with Chinese President Lu Chi-Jang to free Tibet. Montez had done nothing with the negotiations. Despite this, Montez made no effort to give Meyer any credit and accepted the Nobel Peace Prize later that year.\n\nIn October 2018, Meyer's archivist Mike McLintock's diary was leaked by reporter Leon West. McLintock's diary extensively detailed every day of Meyer's time as president from 2016 to 2017. While the diary went into detail about the Medileaks scandal and the Families First Bill, it also revealed to the world Meyer's large role in the freeing of Tibet. On April 15, 2020, Meyer was awarded the Peace Summit Award from the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates.\n\nMontez's fraudulent acceptance of the Peace Prize likely hurt her in the 2020 presidential election, which she lost to Meyer.\n\nSee also[]"
