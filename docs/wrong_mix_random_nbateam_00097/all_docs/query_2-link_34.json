        "text": "The Mind of a Day\n\nWhen you sit looking from a porch\n\nthrough the mind of a day,\n\nyou see rain and sun bestowed by sky,\n\non each leaf and tree,\n\non the whole sea of living green,\n\nclouds massing and vanishing,\n\nbreezes winging the scent of freshly-ripe lilacs,\n\nneon-green grass blades\n\nnot yet cut this season.\n\nYou hear raindrops begin again,\n\neach one separate from the other,\n\nas a sky turns silver-grey,\n\nradiant circles of light\n\ngrowing in a rain puddle,\n\nas a wind rises, rustling your hair,\n\nequally with new-budding leaves—\n\nthe maple over your head, elm\n\nacross the street, the whole small town\n\namong woods—so much to see,\n\nwhen everything else falls away\n\nand you’re free to look\n\nthrough the mind of a day.\n\nSally and Pat\n\nSally lay in bed, refusing food,\n\nwaiting to be taken, in her upstairs room,\n\nby the end she’d chosen.\n\nThe day before,\n\nshe’d thrown her dirty clothing in the wash,\n\nexclaimed with glee: My last load!\n\nA week later, Pat lay dying in a hospital room.\n\nI sat by her bed, held her hand, read a book\n\nto her and Mulberry, the man she loved,\n\nthe one she knew was a Roman chariot driver,\n\ncome back to court her.\n\nNo wonder he likes Nascar.\n\nA year later, I dream\n\nI hold a baby in my arms,\n\nstill feel the baby’s weight on waking,\n\nunderstand it’s Pat, come back.\n\nThey say it takes a year or so.\n\nNow, I wait for Sally in my dreams.\n\nIn New York Harbor\n\nThough Catholic,\n\nmy father chose fire,\n\nhis ashes dispersed in saltwater—\n\nno grave, no bones, no body\n\nto lie beside his mother, father.\n\nAs the tide drove us seaward,\n\nI didn’t expect the shadow\n\nof the bronze statue,\n\ntorched and barely visible,\n\nrising through the waves—\n\nnor the motion of the silent craft,\n\nengine stopped, cross-currents\n\npulling us back through ashes,\n\nas if we or they were a sieve—\n\nsure I heard his laughter.\n\nGravity\n\nWhen it’s windy and the waves rise up,\n\nwe kick our legs, as our arms,\n\nthrough plash of water, plunge deep,\n\nbeating a steady rhythm\n\ntoward a shore we cannot see,\n\nlike sledding, but with less gravity,\n\nthe swoosh of snow in our faces\n\nas its force speeds us downhill,\n\nas we shift our weight left or right,\n\nas we reach our gloved hands into snow,\n\nas the sled carries us careening\n\naround a steep hairpin descent we barely see,\n\nat night with our flashlight,\n\na tiny beam leading us\n\nthrough Earthly darkness—\n\nhow we enjoy it,\n\neven reaching the shallows,\n\nheld by gravity again.\n\nIn the Village Store\n\nAs a woman and I wait\n\nin a snaking long line to pay,\n\na man cuts in front,\n\nand she catches him, insists he retreat,\n\nbut he, angry, I assume,\n\nfrom last week’s election,\n\nthe President’s drubbing,\n\nsnarls: You’re one of the damn Dems,\n\nand Not a lady, assuming, I presume,\n\nthat she wants to embody\n\nsuch an antiquated state,\n\nwhile my nose twitches like a rabbit,\n\ncaught napping in a coyote den,\n\nwondering if I must choose\n\na side to leap to, as a chasm opens\n\nbetween the chocolate aisle and the cheese,\n\nas she points her finger like a light saber—\n\nscreeching his ass is as big as Trump’s,\n\nfat, I might judge,\n\nfrom his eating too much beef,\n\nas she displays her blue-jeaned posterior\n\nlike a peacock’s tail, firm and toned,\n\nI assume, as she pats it,\n\nfrom dieting and yoga,\n\nhere in Vermont,\n\nwhere he likely presumes\n\nwe all vote for Bernie the socialist—\n\nNew Age heathens in want of evangelical saving,\n\nwhile we profess enlightenment,\n\nbut sometimes act like orangutans\n\nsquabbling over bananas\n\nin the wilds of Borneo.\n\nhttps://liveencounters.net/le-poetry-writing-2019/03-march-pw-2019/laura-foley-the-mind-of-a-day/?fbclid=IwAR1MBedvvLMgf5ODcWIFO0g_cAURaxtU8gpey2cFSodN6hTv3nngAAUFnOM\n\nIt Is Time\n\nby Laura Davies Foley\n\nIt is time to gather sticks of wood\n\nso we can cook the sap that we have drawn from the earth.\n\nWe will bore holes into the maple trees,\n\ncollect buckets, stir the froth as it boils.\n\nThen we’ll finish it on the stove in the barn.\n\nWe will do this together,\n\nbalancing the heavy iron vat,\n\npouring the hot syrup,\n\ntasting the sweetness.\n\nWe did it through the pregnancies, the births.\n\nLet’s do it once again.\n\nAnd then we will cultivate the honey bees\n\nand tend to the alfalfa in the fields.\n\nIt will be the best of times once more,\n\nfourteen loads of fresh hay,\n\nand my hair will be long and we will collect raspberries,\n\nand make a pie.\n\nThe garden will yield a bumper crop of beets and basil,\n\nand we will split wood all fall,\n\nand stack it,\n\nand be ready for the winter,\n\nwhen you will weave a blanket on your loom\n\nwith dog hair and horse hair and my hair\n\nand some dyed wool too.\n\nAnd I will nurse the babies by the fire,\n\nand neither of us will grow older,\n\nand we will never forget,\n\nand nothing will ever die.\n\nWe need to gather sticks now\n\nand build a fire quickly,\n\nbefore the season passes on,\n\nbefore the field,\n\nwhere you are sleeping,\n\nblossoms.\n\n“It Is Time” by Laura Davies Foley from Mapping the Fourth Dimension. © Harbor Mountain Press, 2006.
