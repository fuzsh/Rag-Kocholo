Laura has taken over, and before I know it, we‚Äôre chatting about my husband, my new home, and my overzealous Nigerian uncles. She‚Äôs even busy taking in my surroundings: ‚ÄúIs that a Kehinde Wiley?‚Äù she asks, pointing at the baroque painting of my then-toddler son on the wall behind me. Yes, it is. ‚ÄúBefore I became an actress,‚Äù Laura says, ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd be a curator.‚Äù Okay, fine, so she is kind and inquisitive and has an eye for art‚Äîis there literally anything this woman can‚Äôt do?\n\nHer body of work would indicate that no, there is not. Following a stint as a teenage catalog model (which she categorizes as ‚Äúnot glamorous; I was not like the Bellas and Kendalls of the world‚Äù) and a pivot to soap operas, she‚Äôs spent the past near-decade crafting a TV and film career that spans award winners and action flicks alike alongside the biggest names in the industry. She‚Äôs also, because of course, what one might unironically refer to as a ‚Äúfashion darling,‚Äù with a ambassadorship and campaigns for Louis Vuitton, , , and under her belt. And with every move, she‚Äôs out to prove that she‚Äôs more than a genetically blessed ingenue: ‚ÄúI have always been ambitious and driven,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt enter this business with any connections or related to anybody.‚Äù\n\nShe‚Äôs equally driven to be honest about the issues she and all of us face, especially in light of her platform and the responsibilities that attend it. But before we dive into all that, let‚Äôs talk about her own killer new crib. Because‚Äîfinally!‚ÄîI have an opening to ask.\n\nSaint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello dress. Fernando Jorge earrings and necklace.\n\nYou sold your home earlier this year.‚Ä¶You once said that you wanted your previous pad to ‚Äúlook like it was owned by a rich lady in the ‚Äô70s who just got divorced and is maybe gonna throw an orgy.‚Äù\n\n[Laughs.] I was too honest with that answer.\n\nI want the same level of honesty. Describe the current aesthetic of your new home.\n\nThe current aesthetic is the same vibe, except it‚Äôs the ‚Äô20s in Paris. That‚Äôs where my head is at now. I‚Äôm really looking toward more classic European pieces. Interior design and architecture are a passion and a creative outlet that I really love.\n\nAny orgies involved?\n\nI want to clarify that orgies are not a real thing in my life. No shade to people who are into that, but that is not what‚Äôs actually happening in my house.\n\nJudging from your Instagram, the past few months of your life have still been pretty amazing though. You‚Äôve taken the phrase ‚ÄúWe back outside‚Äù to a whole new level.\n\nI‚Äôve been outside. I‚Äôm not going to lie. I‚Äôm very grateful I‚Äôve been able to travel this summer. I‚Äôve been in Europe, bopping around mainly in France and Italy. I was in Marrakech for the Saint Laurent show.\n\nCasual.\n\nExactly. You get invited, you must show up, right? Now I‚Äôm on a little island called Pantelleria, which is off Sicily.\n\nAre you hanging out solo? Are you there with someone?\n\nI‚Äôm here with my significant other.\n\nAnd how significant is that other? Because I‚Äôve heard through the grapevine that that other is very, very significant now.\n\nYeah. We did get engaged recently, which I‚Äôm very excited about.1\n\nLaura‚Äôs fianc√©, Sam Jarou, a dashing Parisian who splits his time between France and Los Angeles, is a freelance creative consultant who‚Äôs worked with the likes of Supreme and Stussy. The two met at a dinner in L.A. in 2019 and keep their relationship notoriously private, so yeah, this is kind of a big deal (!).\n\nCongratulations! Walk me through when, where, and how it happened?\n\nIt was really simple and sweet in Paris. I never wanted one of those big showy public engagements. That‚Äôs just not my personality.\n\nHow did you know you were ready for something as life-changing as marriage?\n\nThe clich√© of when you know, you know. I never really believed it until that happened to me. It‚Äôs a funny feeling when you just find peace and calm.\n\nI also really do believe that you need to be ready within yourself before you can find somebody else to be with, which I also always thought was a clich√© until I felt secure within myself and the person I am and where I‚Äôm at in life.\n\nI know you don‚Äôt want to talk much about your fianc√©, but last question: He‚Äôs in fashion and you‚Äôre an actor. That‚Äôs a lot of creative energy in one house. Do you collaborate on projects, or could you, potentially?\n\nMm. He‚Äôs the first man I‚Äôve dated where I‚Äôll actually listen when he gives me outfit advice. So is that a collab?\n\nYes. That‚Äôs a start.\n\nOn that note.\n\nOn that note, I won‚Äôt ask about children.\n\nNo. No. You‚Äôre not getting me, girl. [Laughs.]\n\nThat is a collab, right?\n\nThat‚Äôs a different sort of collab than what we‚Äôre talking about. The biggest collab.\n\ndress. Gianvito Rossi heels. necklace. Fernando Jorge rings.\n\nSpeaking of collabs, you and Zendaya became friends after meeting on the set of Spider-Man: Homecoming. What would people be surprised to learn about her?\n\nJust how she is a fun, down-to-earth person, despite being stunningly gorgeous and good at everything and stupidly talented and one of those people that you almost want to hate but you can‚Äôt because they‚Äôre just cool and nice.2 She‚Äôs a special person for sure.\n\n2. This is also, it must be said, how some people‚Äîincluding me‚Äîwould describe Laura.\n\nFolks on Twitter were recently discussing Zendaya and Keke Palmer and the role that colorism has played in their respective careers. Some argued that Zendaya has enjoyed more mainstream success than Keke because she‚Äôs closer to a Eurocentric ideal of beauty. Do you think colorism is still an issue in Hollywood? Do you think that lighter-skinned actresses have an advantage?\n\nSome of the most successful actresses of color tend to be on the lighter side and that‚Äôs definitely not okay. There are so many facets to the Black experience. There are so many ways that Black people look, and only having one narrow view is something that I think is ultimately putting everybody at a disadvantage‚Äîwe‚Äôre only shortchanging ourselves when we don‚Äôt show a diverse range of stories and a diverse range of people onscreen. I do think it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs slowly starting to change, but even when we were doing Spider-Man, I would get called ‚ÄúZendaya‚Äù all the time. People wouldn‚Äôt even take the time to differentiate us.\n\nYou don‚Äôt look anything alike.\n\nNo, not at all. It got to the point where we would joke about it a lot. What else are you going to do but laugh because it‚Äôs so completely ridiculous.\n\nI know that we‚Äôre seeing more women of color in front of the camera. What are things like behind the scenes? Have you noticed a shift in how women, particularly women of color, are being treated?\n\nYeah. I‚Äôve definitely seen it on both sides, which is really exciting and promising. Within the past few years, I‚Äôve noticed a lot more female showrunners, female directors, female writers in ways that I was not seeing at the beginning of my career. It was so rare to walk on a set and see women, especially women of color, even people of color in general. The sets in Hollywood have been so white-male dominated for such a long time. I have seen that change recently, which is really cool and exciting.\n\nI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre inundated with scripts. How do you go about deciding if a project is right for you?\n\nI look at the character first and foremost. Is this a person that I feel like I could portray in an interesting way? Is this something that I haven‚Äôt done before? Does this feel different and new? Right now, I‚Äôm really interested in showing different facets of myself.\n\nIn addition to Entergalactic,3 you‚Äôre also starring in the remake of White Men Can‚Äôt Jump. What can you tell me about it and about working with rapper Jack Harlow?\n\nThis was his first time acting. He‚Äôs very charismatic and I knew he‚Äôd be able to play the part, but he really impressed me. Our chemistry is great together. It felt natural and easy with him. And I think it‚Äôs going to be a cute movie.\n\n3. The TV special is the brainchild of actor and rapper Kid Cudi, who executive produces and stars in it as well, so naturally, a slew of music‚Äôs and Hollywood‚Äôs coolest kids make up the cast, from Timoth√©e Chalamet and Jaden Smith to Vanessa Hudgens, Teyana Taylor, and Ty Dolla Sign.\n\nCute movies are what we need right now, a place to mentally escape to during these angst-inducing times. How do you balance staying informed with knowing when to turn it all off?\n\nIt‚Äôs so important to know what‚Äôs happening in the world and to be active and to use your voice for the greater good and for causes that you believe in. But sometimes doing that can really take a toll. Sometimes I have to not read the news, not check my New York Times app, turn off Instagram because these are really tough times that we‚Äôre living in. And it‚Äôs easy to get so caught up in the collective anxiety of the world that you can forget that you also need to protect yourself and protect your own wellness. I don‚Äôt think that you can make a change and help other people if you‚Äôre not taking care of yourself.\n\nSchiaparelli bodysuit, hat, and gloves. tights.\n\nWhat strategies do you turn to for taking care of yourself?\n\nI‚Äôve learned tools through therapy. I really am a big advocate for therapy and for mental health care, especially in the Black community. That‚Äôs something that‚Äôs really improved my life and really helped me in significant ways, especially with dealing with my anxiety and panic attacks.\n\nThere‚Äôs this notion historically that Black people don‚Äôt go to therapy. We go to church and we pray the pain away. Are you noticing a shift in the Black community when it comes to taking care of one‚Äôs mental health as you would your physical health?\n\nI love that you said that. I definitely believe that mental health care should be prioritized just as much as physical health. There‚Äôs been such a long history of ignoring mental health problems, of saying, ‚ÄúOh, just suck it up‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a strong Black woman. That doesn‚Äôt happen to me.‚Äù All of these tropes that we‚Äôve been taught over generations, when actually, I think given generational trauma, of course there are a lot of mental health issues within the Black community. I‚Äôve been working with a really amazing Los Angeles‚Äìbased organization called BEAM, which stands for Black Emotional and Mental Health Collective. They help people find resources, therapists, and also natural care, like Reiki.\n\nDi Petsa top and skirt. heels. earrings and rings.\n\nDo you work any of those remedies into your own mental health tool kit?\n\nI try to meditate. I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm the best with my track record of doing it every day, but I try to at least do some deep breathing. I noticed I literally forget to breathe, which sounds wild, but sometimes I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúWait, I haven‚Äôt taken a real breath all day,‚Äù and just taking 30 seconds to sit and do deep belly breathing is a game changer. Also, I think it‚Äôs so common to talk only about self-care as meditation, yoga, and working out, which are all important, but sometimes self-care is having a glass of wine with your best friend and laughing and watching shitty reality TV. Watching The Bachelor and drinking wine with my girls is awesome. Sometimes that‚Äôs the self-care that you need.\n\nWhat other reality shows are on your list of self-care watches?\n\nDo we want to go down this rabbit hole? It‚Äôs so bad.\n\nI do. Let‚Äôs go.\n\n90 Day Fianc√© is my addiction. The amount of hours I feel like I‚Äôve spent in life watching this show is‚Ä¶.And there are so many spin-offs: 90 Day Fianc√©: The Other Way, 90 Day Fianc√©: Before the 90 Days.\n\nI feel like I‚Äôve learned more about the immigration system watching 90 Day Fianc√© than I‚Äôve learned reading august publications like the New York Times or The Atlantic.\n\nOh, I one hundred percent agree with you, and also, now being engaged to a non-American, I feel like all my facts are like, ‚ÄúOh no, we can‚Äôt do that, babe. On 90 Day, their visa got rejected.‚Äù All my information is based on this show.\n\nIn addition to bad TV, I‚Äôm also a huge fan of a big, deep, ugly cry. It‚Äôs like an emotional enema.\n\nHolding emotion in is not only not good mentally but not good physically. Physical manifestations of stress are very real. I‚Äôve had weird little skin things or backaches and it‚Äôs like, Okay, what is the actual root cause of this? Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm super stressed or upset and I‚Äôm not dealing with it?\n\ndress and boots.\n\nWhen is the last time you felt angry?\n\nI feel very angry about our current political system, about these abortion bans, about this war on women‚Äôs bodies. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs making me really angry. I feel enraged and really scared about the future and other rights that can be rolled back.\n\nNow that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, there‚Äôs a real risk that other rights, like gay marriage and interracial marriage, could be decimated as well. As the product of an interracial marriage, that must be particularly horrifying for you, that your parents‚Äô union could be outlawed.\n\nJust hearing those words‚Ä¶it‚Äôs such a clear breach of human rights and what people fought for and died for in our country. It‚Äôs really upsetting and very scary. We need to use our collective voices and do everything that we can to fight against these things, because clearly the justices on the Supreme Court don‚Äôt want to just stop at Roe v. Wade.\n\nYou mentioned the war on women‚Äôs bodies. What do you think is motivating this? Is it a fear of women‚Äôs power? Is it a fear that women are now more empowered than they‚Äôve ever been?\n\nThat‚Äôs definitely a factor. We obviously know that these bans are going to disproportionately affect Black and brown women as well as women with lower socioeconomic status. I don‚Äôt think these people are concerned about protecting fetuses, but I think they really are interested in keeping people in a cycle of poverty so that they can remain in power and remain in control, because they‚Äôre scared, because minorities are moving up, because we are gaining more power, and they want to keep the status quo.\n\nWhen speaking so candidly about such hot-button issues, have you ever worried about backlash, worried about people saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an actor, act‚Äù?\n\nWell, I would say that I‚Äôm not coming at these topics as an actress. I‚Äôm coming at these topics as Laura, as a woman of reproductive age who‚Äôs affected by Roe v. Wade. I‚Äôm affected by Black Lives Matter issues because I‚Äôm a Black person in America, because that‚Äôs my family, because that‚Äôs my little brother walking down the street that I worry about. It‚Äôs not because of my job that I care about these issues. It‚Äôs because of my humanity that I do. To people who would say that, I would encourage them to look at their own humanity and ask themselves, ‚ÄúWhy do I not care more?‚Äù I don‚Äôt really worry about backlash because if I don‚Äôt get a job because I believe that women should have access to abortion, then that‚Äôs not a job that I want.\n\nSpeaking of jobs, I want to talk about your role in Mike as Robin Givens, who was famously married to Mike Tyson for one year in the ‚Äô80s. How did you prepare to play someone so iconic?\n\nI wanted to tell this story as honestly and truthfully as I could. Both were so misrepresented in the media. It was really shocking looking back at these articles from the ‚Äô80s and seeing the way that people villainized her in legitimate publications. I wanted to come at it from a place of compassion but also a place of objectivity.\n\nDo you think their marriage, and Robin Givens specifically, would be viewed differently today?\n\nI‚Äôd hope it would all be viewed differently today. Given the events of the past few years, given the Me Too movement, I really hope that had this happened now, people would have a lot more compassion for her. I can‚Äôt say that people would automatically believe her even now, because as we‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs still very difficult for survivors to be believed.\n\nMike Tyson has been quite vocal about his unhappiness with Hulu‚Äôs decision to air this fictionalized account without his consent.4 Did the fact that he wasn‚Äôt involved in any way impact your decision to be a part of it?\n\nI wanted to be part of this project because more than telling Mike Tyson‚Äôs life story specifically, this is a real commentary on so many American stories. We‚Äôre talking about racial inequality, socioeconomic inequality, rape culture, the Me Too movement. This story was looking at all those things through the lens of this incredibly famous man.\n\n4. Tyson recently lashed out at the streaming network, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt support their story about my life. It‚Äôs not 1822. It‚Äôs 2022. They stole my life story and didn‚Äôt pay me.‚Äù\n\nOn a brighter note, the ‚Äô80s ensembles are fabulous.\n\nWe were giving.\n\nSaint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello dress. Fernando Jorge earrings and necklace.\n\nYou were Givens and you were definitely giving.\n\nThank you! I loved the wardrobe. The ‚Äô80s were such a time of excess and extravagance. I had major Chanel suits with the miniskirts and the little pumps. It was full glam, full-on, all the time, which is so different from my personal aesthetic. I like to find characters through wardrobe and through hair and makeup. When I put on that wig and the full beat and the nails, it just came out of me.\n\nI hear the vintage shopping in L.A. is spectacular.\n\nIt is. I have one place in L.A. that I love that I‚Äôm not going to share because I don‚Äôt want people to steal all my stuff. It‚Äôs tough out here. I got into an argument with a girl at that store recently because she tried to steal my dress.\n\nHow did you resolve that argument? Is she alive?\n\nIt was very silly. She put the dress away, then I took the dress. Then she said she changed her mind and she still wanted it. I said, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that. That‚Äôs not how this works. You put it away. It‚Äôs my dress now.‚Äù She got very upset. It‚Äôs a great 2000 Roberto Cavalli. I wore it to a wedding the other day. So sorry, girl.\n\nBlue look: dress, bra, briefs, socks, boots, necklace, and belt. ring."
