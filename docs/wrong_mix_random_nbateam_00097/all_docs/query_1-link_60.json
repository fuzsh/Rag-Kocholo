While growing up, he lived in tents and sod teepees in his homelands, which many term “trapline.” Today, Sam is currently building an energy-efficient home that will be cool in the summer and warm during the winter months. The new home will harness energy from the sun, wind, and water. This is an essential element for the green economy concept.\n\nCurrently, Sam lives in the remote Cree community of Peawanuck, Ontario, in the middle of Polar Bear Provincial Park. He grew up in the wilderness and practices traditions regularly. Being in a remote community, he isn’t totally dependent on his survival skills; however, he chooses to live his life that way, as that is what makes him happiest.\n\nSam has a lifetime of stories to tell, from being born in a tent to being dragged out of his tent by a polar bear. He was forced to attend residential school as a child, where he would later lose his brother. At the age of 14, he started taking tourists out to see polar bears, earning him the nickname “Polar Bear Guide.” There are so many stories that he usually tops the last one each time he gets together with family and friends.\n\nSam mentors youth with trips to the wilderness and is very interested in bringing in outside programming mentors to teach science, climate change, adaptations, and visual arts. Sam understands the benefits of mentoring young people. Stories of teens whose lives have been changed by a mentoring adult are powerful.\n\nWalter Jetz, Scientific Chair, E.O.
