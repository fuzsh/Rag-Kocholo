        "text": "The latest:\n\nThe Washington Post: Graduates get plenty of advice as they prepare to leave the nest and move on in life. This one’s for their parents, with love. “Into that teenager-size hole in your heart, you must put something exciting for you, and you should proactively plan it now.”\n\n– The Graduation Speech Parents Need\n\nThe New York Times Book Review: A review of the joint memoir by mother-daughter legends Diane Ladd and Laura Dern — all about the craft of acting, the strange experience of fame, and the infinite doubts and compromises of motherhood. “Emboldened by each day’s revelations and driven by their abiding love for each other, they wade into deeper confessions. The book is at its most memorable and affecting when they work up the courage to excavate heavy, sharp-edged emotional artifacts.”\n\n– Book Review: Honey, Baby, Mine by Laura Dern and Diane Ladd\n\nThe New York Times Book Review: A review of the new memoir by Rob Delaney, which explores the actor’s shattering experience of losing his two-year-old son, Henry, to brain cancer. “A Heart That Works may be a tribute to a lost son and the family who survives him; it may be a hand outstretched to bereaved parents who feel alone on their planet of grief; but most of all, it is a hopeful plea to people everywhere to make choices, large and small, guided by love. What a world it would be if we did.”\n\n– Book Review: A Heart That Works by Rob Delaney\n\nThe Washington Post: An excerpt from Bomb Shelter, depicting the before-and-after moment when a mother finds her son unconscious and calls for help. After a close call comes within a breath of taking what we love the most, can we ever be the same — or is everything changed?\n\n– The Night Time Stopped\n\nThe Atlantic: An adapted excerpt from Bomb Shelter, telling a surprising story and contemplating the fact that while we can’t protect our loved ones forever, love is never futile. “The extraordinary doesn’t wipe out the ordinary. People get married in wartime. Babies are born during pandemics. My mom drew water for my bath and flung wet clothes into the dryer and taught me to tie my shoes while my father did test runs for the end of the world.” – The Most Haunting Truth of Parenthood\n\nMore Book Reviews\n\nNew York Times Book Review: The Crane Wife by CJ Hauser\n\nWashington Post Book World: Left on Tenth by Delia Ephron\n\nThe Week: Six All-Time Unforgettable Books\n\nWashington Post Book World: A Conversation with Nobel Prize Winner Kazuo Ishiguro\n\nEssays & More\n\nThe New York Times\n\nFor Those We Can’t Always Protect\n\nThis Togetherness Is Temporary\n\nI’m So Excited for 40th Grade\n\nThe Great Fortune of Ordinary Sadness\n\nTo the Type-A Person Having a Meltdown\n\nHard Knock Life: What Are The Turtles Telling Me?\n\nShopping for a Car — And a Teenager’s Future\n\nMy Adventures in Accountability\n\nSing, O Muse, of the Mall of America\n\nWishing Away the Wish List\n\nThe Power of Place\n\nHow to See More Of Your Best Friends?
