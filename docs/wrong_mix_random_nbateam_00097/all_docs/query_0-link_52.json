        "text": "Connie.\n\nMy Dad paid for college and grad school. I was a princess, what can I say? Though I always worked and provided my own spending money. I really just wanted to post to see if my gravatar thingie works.\n\nHmmm, wonder what happened to that post.\n\nJust looking for my gravatar, my posts must be piling up somewhere.\n\nThank you for lovely compliment Brian.\n\nIt probably would have got on my nerves on day one. I have no desire to visit to LV, but if I did it would be to see Bette Midler's show and a Cirque show. I remember as a teenager walking around Reno with my family and being astonished that there were all these places you could pay to leave your kids while you went gambling. Had a lovely day at Butler U on Saturday, attending an awards ceremony for the College of Lit, Sci, Arts. My kid not only won an award, she was selected to introduce the professor who spoke. She ended her intro by saying \"the dude abides, may I present Professor....\" Maybe a quarter of the audience chuckled and the rest were clearly clueless. Would you have chuckled? Also did a family pic with the big concrete bulldog, and bought a few final four t-shirts. Go Butler! I guess next year I'll be having to say, Go IU, which is going to be really really hard for us.\n\nI was in the other room as my husband was watching Treme, and I clearly heard those classic Ashley words, FYYFF.\n\nMy daughter's summer job includes identifying invasive species in various Indy parks. I was dismayed to learned that all that honeysuckle that lines the freeways in central Indiana is considered seriously invasive. But I am really just posting to see what my new gravatar looks like when it is tiny.\n\nYo Paddyo, as soon as I read the word Sominex that jingle was jingling in my brain, nice to know I'm not the only one. I have said before, I know all the words to all the songs. Or at least old pop, anything MItch Miller sang along with, and hymns. This is not always a good thing. My husband set up a facebook account three years ago when our kid spent a semester in Europe and was posting her photos. I've been logging in as him, but have finally been convinced to set up my own. One of these days. Ever since then we've said the reason for parents to be on facebook is to stalk their own children.\n\nDespite my liberalism, I will claim a couple of past Repub reps with whom I was happy. Jerry Ford was my rep all through my childhood, he regularly came to visit all the small towns in his district in a trailer office which he parked next to my dad's office. We all felt that we actually knew him. I was also happy to have Lee Hamilton as my rep for many years, and somewhere I have a photo of the two of us standing at a podium together. The Democrat who replaced him long after I moved away was a friend, and our girls played on the soccer team, so here's for Baron Hill. He had been a great state rep who was always willing to listen. These days I have Joe Donelly, wish he weren't so blue doggy, but I'm mostly OK with him. I am less than half a mile from the line between Donnelly and Souder's district, so am glad to be on the Donelly side. Chris Chocola (R) was in that position prior to Donnelly, and in the last redistricting the line was purposely redrawn so that Chocola lived half a mile outside his district. Didn't seem to bother him or those who continued to vote for him.\n\nMy MSU days (two years before our hostess's college days) were pretty hippie-ish, and greek just wasn't in. Although as a freshman I was contacted by several slightly older sorority girls from my home town to invite me over. One of my most drunken memories involves a date to a party at Beta Phi Mu, which at MSU was all business majors. We were dressed in 50s outfits, and drinking orange punch. I found out later they had overspent their budget on the vodka, so instead of buying mixers they mixed in a large bottle of Tang. Actually for the getting back to the dorm part there is no memory at all. Just waking up in the morning and seeing my date, still in his 50s outfit, passed out on my roommate's bed. I had a friend from home at Delta Tau Delta, just down the street from my dorm. Now that was Animal House in a fun way. The drinking age was 18 during my MSU days, so we were all legal. My newly graduated kid tells me Butler is totally Greek, and then there is her gang.\n\nThe recent Butler graduation I attended was more than three hours long, and it was shivering cold in Hinkle Fieldhouse. My kid tells me that all the capped and gowned grads spent the whole time texting, unless of course they were in line and headed across the stage. My HS class was 176.\n\nDexter, I too paused a moment on learning of John Wooden's death. Spring Break 2001 we took our daughter back to Minnesota to visit her friends, after having moved to Indiana the year before. My husband and I had a weekend to ourselves and headed north to the Mall of America. Not knowing it was the Saturday of the NCAA Final Fours being held in Minneapolis. Mountain Dew had taken over the mall and we got lots of goodies, including the very first release of their new product Code Red. We came around a corner and realized we were seeing the end of a very very long line. Curious, we walked all the way to the next corner to find the head of the line, where John Wooden was autographing his new book. Had to be a thousand or more in that line. Hoosiers will remember that for many years the state basketball championships were held in Hinkle Fieldhouse. The very first state championship game to be held there was in 1928. John Wooden was the captain of the losing team. (Martinsville.) I have now managed to mention Hinkle twice in this thread, each for entirely unrelated reasons.\n\nOur Glen Lake cottage has an artesian well, a pipe that sticks up a couple of feet right at the shoreline. Clear, cold spring water, and very handy during the occasional power outage. I believe the whole lake is filled by underwater springs.\n\nHolly, I have been going to Glen Lake since I was a kid, and was a young teenager when my father bought the first place there. Our place is like 6 houses east of the Dairy Bar, look for the Land of Oz sign. House is across the street from the Lake frontage, it's just a little old place, part of which is log cabin under the siding. My oldest memories are pre-National Park, when the scenic drive was a privately owned business, and the dune climb and campground were part of a state park. I remember the old red dune buggies with the big tires, and my grandmother tying her hair up just right in a scarf before we rode them. The Dairy Bar had a gas pump, and the same teenagers that scooped the ice cream pumped the gas. As to the Totem Pole, everyone's kid needs a rubber spear. My husband bought our kid so many inappropriate things there in years past. My least favorite was the bell for the three year old, and there is actually a whip down the basement too. In recent years my thing about the Totem is that they sell Seafoam, my favorite hard to find candy. Sue and I have had this conversation several times, I take it she is your sister. And in my gravatar photo I am watching the sunset from the top of the dune by the scenic drive Overlook. Empire Beach is my other favorite place for watching sunsets.\n\nWe know LAMary is the champion when it comes to celebrity sightings, but I did once ride an elevator with Helen Thomas. And with Maya Angelou too. In both cases I was on the way to a banquet for which each was the speaker. Doesn't beat being held back by security while trying to get to a meeting at the Indianapolis Marriott on Shadeland. I was forced to wait until Frank Zappa exited the hotel and got in his limo and left.\n\nbasset, love the Michigan highway page. There are my favorite highways, M22 and M109. I have an M22 sticker on my car, and I believe Sue has referred to her M22 t-shirt. I fondly remember M209, decommissioned in 1997, but at .37 miles, once known as the shortest designated highway in the state. (Sue and Holly, this is the road to Glen Haven Beach.) I have fond memories of all the small towns on US 31 we used to go through on our trips up north. We were heading south of Manistee once, and got stuck behind a long slow funeral procession. We thought it was so funny when the procession turned at the sign pointing to Freesoil. My hometown highway was M21, which lost its highway designation when it become the 196 business route. The last stretch of 196 was built during my high school years, and several of my high school friends lost their homes and farms to it. The summer after my senior year a large group of us took a bike trip on the soon to be opened freeway.\n\nBrian, I have lived and voted in Michigan, Ohio, and Minnesota, and while things may have changed, Indiana is the only place I have been required to declare a party.\n\nBrian, you may be remembering what I think of as the great Indianapolis earthquake of 1987. In some prev. thread Jeff tmmo and I discovered we had each experienced that earthquake at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis. We took shelter earlier this evening from what I believe were the same storms Deb was worrying about in Chicago in an earlier comment. Tornadoes to the south of us, tornadoes to the north of us, just thunderstorms through the center. I enjoyed the part where the weather guy wondered why his 55 mph storm had quit moving across his screen, checked a few other radar sources, and then was informed that lightning had taken out the National Weather Service radar tower in Kosciusko County.\n\nJulie, from our house when the wind is right we can hear the Concord Band practicing. We moved here just in time for jr high, and the whole marching band competition thing was a completely new concept. We enjoyed our four years as marching band parents and were glad when it was over and we could have our Fall Saturdays back. The Concord Band made the state final competion all four of those years and in Class B took second, first, second and first. Made it even more fun to having a winning band. I was surprised to see Hermine on the hurricane list. Might I be the only person who has actually known someone named Hermine? I've know two, one of them my aunt. Though now that I think about it the other was actually Hermina. LAMary, do you think it is a Dutch name?\n\nAll of our dogs have found us. Our current miniature schnauzer and our late Shih Tzu both came to our home because we had put out the word to friends and family that we were looking for a dog. Both were free with owners thankful to have found us. I have not been to a Wal-Mart in 8 yrs. An hour or so of rain this a.m. seems to not have had an effect on temp or humidity. Pool is almost too warm, and has not had the solar cover on it yet this year.\n\nBasset, I have a 1947 Singer Featherweight, given to me by my Mother in Law, who tells me she bought it at Uncler Merle's Singer shop in Cadillac when she was pregnant with my husband. I also have all the attachments including the buttonhole maker. But not the table, upon which she keeps her current machine. She says I can have it when she dies. She's 88, healthy and feisty so I am not holding my breath. Speaking of Cadillac, hordes of us will descend on the old family farm outside Cadillac on Pleasant Lake next weekend for a reunion. Many are camping, but I, being a princess, have a motel room booked. This is the farm where my late father in law grew up. The only thing grown there in recent years is Christmas trees.\n\nSue, I remember that as well, and that the potheads got the porch. Basset, the Cadillac farm has frequent deer sightings and recently had its first bear sighting. My husband's cousins own The Pines for what it is worth.\n\nI think keeping the languages you studied has a lot to do with how much you really get to use and experience the language. Four HS and two college years of German were seriously reinforced by a summer exchange program in Germany. My grammar may not be very good, but I can still hold a conversation. Unlike my 3 semesters of college Russian which left me with little more than Dosvidanya tovarits. And since no one says comrade anymore any true Russian speaker will laugh at you if you say it. All those weeks of studying the cyrillic alphabet, and it is just gone. I did have a nightmare in German once. I was falling down an elevator shaft and couldn't figure out whether to scream \"Hilfen Sie mich\" or \"Hilfen Sie mir.\" Ah, grammatik.\n\nMany many years ago my dad, then in his late 30s, had the first quadruple bypass performed in Grand Rapids. They kept him in the hospital for six weeks, and in a hospital bed at home for another six weeks. Now he is a grumpy 78 year old who received stents two years ago, and has a continuous and not pleasant anemic response to the Plavix all stent receivers must take.\n\nAh, diversity. At the family reunion this weekend my 88 year old mother in law talked about how she felt compelled to call out her church group and senior center friends on their expressed bigotry. She says, It makes me sad that I didn't hardly notice it before I gained a wonderful African-American grandson in law, and a mixed race great grandchild. I just tell them that I have a mixed race family and their comments are out of line. Good for her. I love northern Michigan and fresh fruit season makes it even better. We pigged out on blueberries, raspberries and black sweet cherries. Peach season any day.\n\nIf you go to the Middlebury Public Library you are likely to see Amish men using the computers. It's the only way to get Indiana unemployment benefits. Around here Meijer's and Walmart have buggy hitches in their parking lots.\n\nYo, Alex, when I saw Tony and Tina's Wedding in San Fran, all I got was Grandma asking me to show her baby pictures. Although the very big and busty bridesmaid did try to pick up my husband. Just back from a lovely week in Leelanau County. You newspaper folks might be interested in the job ad I saw: Editor for the Leelanau Enterprise, supervises two reporters, copy editing experience preferred. I have been reading the Enterprise for years and have always thought they do an excellent job of covering local government (townships!), politics, business, and news. And you know what they say: \"Live by the Bay on half the pay.\"\n\nJust found this great sounding tomato recipe on Salon: Summer tomato pasta with greens and onion. http://www.salon.com/food/eyewitness_cook/index.html?story=/food/francis_lam/2010/07/30/summer_tomato_pasta\n\nMitch Miller is one of the reasons I can claim I know all the words to all the old songs. As a kid the records at our house were limited to Mitch and musical sound tracks. Jeff, tmmo, I know where that BSA camp is. My daughter had several friends that worked there, and she and her girl friends often went to the Friday night camp fire.\n\nLand grant here too, MSU to be specific. Not all state schools are land grant colleges, I believe each state has only one. You can figure it out by looking for the big ag school, which means, OSU, MSU and Purdue in these regions. I was always amazed by the existence of the big MSU rodeo. And always bought the Dairy Club's cheese packages at Xmas.\n\nAt last I can beat - or at least tie - LAMary. I have been quoted by name in Rolling Stone. Right under \"Kurt Cobain recovers from suicide attempt\" which tells you how long ago it was. I was quoted in a story about efforts to ban Rolling Stone from the library in John Mellencamp's hometown.\n\nI've put 130,000 on my Dodge Grand Caravan, and yesterday it took part in the kid's move to Bloomington for grad school, though roomie's rented Penske truck took most of it. Always amazing how much it can carry with the seats out.\n\nSaw the face first and thought it was Frankenstein.\n\nfave bronze sculpture of my childhood: http://www.city-data.com/picfilesc/picc25326.php . Great part was that a real kid could climb up and sit in his lap too.\n\nI love runny eggs. I've noticed in the last year or so that if you order Eggs Benedict in a restaurant the egg will be poached \"well\", with no runniness. Kind of defeats the whole point as far as I am concerned. My mother's famous chocolate frosting recipe contains a raw egg. My cousins and I continue to make it any way, so there. Though cousin Katie's husband refuses to eat it.\n\nMany moons ago my husband and I were travelling from our home in southern Indiana to San Francisco. We began the trip with the long drive to Flint in order to leave our then five year old with her aunt for the week. We got to Bishop airport to learn our quick flight to Detroit Metro was cancelled, and the airline's new plan was to fly us to Indianapolis - which we had driven past the day before - from which we were in first class to San Francisco, very nice. Unfortunately the return flight was a nightmare. We were delayed for hours in the SF airport and finally arrived at Detroit Metro at 2 a.m., one of the two times I have been there when it was virtually empty. At one point in the craziness in the SF airport I turned to the mother of several small children seated near us and said \"Give me that baby, you're overwhelmed.\" She did. And I remember that Dad was a clarinet player for the SF Orchestra.\n\nDorothy, my husband's bday is the day of the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald. Kind of a bummer to see bad events reviewed on the news on your bday every year. Mine is Friday.\n\nMy birthday is also militarily significant, let's see, 1939, I think the invasion of Poland. But the best thing about my birthday is it has its very own rock and roll song: It was the third of September, a day I'll always remember, cause that was the day that my daddy died. Papa was a rolling stone....\"\n\nNone for me thanks.\n\nI swore off roller coasters etc after cracking my tailbone on the log ride at the Mall of America.\n\nMy weekend plan: enjoy my daughter's visit, hear about her first week of grad school, make something from those peaches, con someone else into cleaning the kitchen floor.\n\nI just finished The Looming Tower and found it not only authoritative and impressive but also absorbing, as if the story it told were a compelling novel. I read it through in two days without a single fiction break. Read Laura's new book last week and enjoyed it as well.\n\nJoe, where to eat in Cadillac: we like the Timbers, on 115 a mile or two north of the state park, the Pines on M55 just off 115 is owned by my husband's cousins and has great pizza. Enter in the back. Lakeside Charlies sort of across the street from the Pines has good steak. Avoid Da Dawghouse. And the Waterfron -115 south of the state park, across from the Sands, has a good breakfast buffet and a nice patio. Basset is steering you downtown, I am steering you out west to tourist/state park country.\n\nYes, Basset, softball diamonds are out back of the Pines. Building and half of softball diamonds are in the county, other half of softball diamonds and the parking lot are in the city limits. Makes for strange confusion when police are called for fights, drunks, car thefts, etc. Picture city cops and county cops figuring it out in a huddle in the parking lot.\n\nI've just finished, and will recomment \"Zoo Story: Life in the Garden of Captives\" by Thomas French. It is the story of the triumphs and tribulations of Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo, and demonstrates on a kind of personal level that issues currently under discussion in the zoo, animal conservation, and animal rights worlds. I bring this up however, because as I browsed the bibliography there was The Looming Tower. Hmm, Al Quada and the Tampa Zoo. Then I realized he had told the story of the last two living animals in the Kabul Zoo. Connections.\n\nIf you believe in free expression is it hypocritical to oppose \"Burn a Quran Day\" Great discussion at http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2010/09/am_i_a_hypocrite.php#more .\n\nI heard the interview between the Waco tea party leader and the guy from the American Family Association. He essentially was trying to co-opt the tea party meeting for their social issues - right to life, sanctity of marriage, etc., and she was having none of it.\n\nIn other news I have accepted a job in my home state of Michigan. We will be living in the Lakes area of southwest Oakland County, I will be about 40 miles north/northwest of Nancy Nall headquarters. As I posted on my facebook page, Moving home to Michigan! Go Green! Go Blue! Go Lions! And still and probably always, Go Butler!\n\nMichaelG, Exactly one week after my wedding I gave myself a black eye with a broom, while vigorously sweeping dirt off the sidewalk after planting tulip bulbs. Quite the thing for a newlywed to show up to work with. I still remember laying on the sidewalk seeing stars. My big fall this summer was off the edge of my friend's patio, where I failed to get my arms up and landed on my nose in the grass. Bent my glasses all to bits and my nose throbbed for days. Plus 3 witnesses.\n\nIndiana Republican Pence wins Value Voters 2012 Poll: http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/09/18/5135006-pence-wins-values-voter-2012-straw-poll-?ocid=twitter Palin came in a distant fifth.\n\nMichigan State beats Notre Dame! Last week Michigan did the same! Sometimes having two alma maters is good.\n\nWe've visited the Lincoln Birthplace several times, in conjunction with Mammoth Cave visits when we lived in southern Indiana and could do it in one long day. We found it very odd. This massive marble building with columns and grand steps. Then you step inside and the only thing in there is this tiny little log cabin that may not actually be authentic. Brian, we did a family trip to that southwestern part of Indiana some years ago, and I would add Angel Mounds State Park and the old riverfront in Newburg. We crossed the river at Evansville and had a lovely day heading east on the Kentucky riverfront roads. Cross back over at Tell City to eat at the amazing Overlook Restaurant. http://www.theoverlook.com/ Update: Corrected Mounds to Angel Mounds.\n\nBrian, I have to agree with you about seeing your own country before Europe. I was lucky to see much of the west on a month long RV trip with my family at 14. Conferences have brought me to the wonderful cities of Seattle, Portland, Or, New York twice, San Francisco thrice, New Orleans twice, and finally and at last to Boston (you must take the tour of the USS Constitution) and to the not so great cities of Dallas and Atlanta. Except for Boston I've never been to New England, and except for a teenaged flight to Daytona and those trips to New Orleans and a former Cajun sister in law in Lafayette La, I've never seen New England or the south. And someday I will go back to the west, where I want to visit Custer Battlefield. And I am hoping to visit Philadelphia for the first time for a 2011 conference. Yes, and then London, Paris, and Amsterdam, where my brother and his wife are currently vacationing, staying on a houseboat instead of in a hotel.\n\nShe's still Cajun, but a former SIL.\n\nHey Nancy, did you hear about the bad behavior of your alma mater's mascot? Ohio University apologized this morning for the shocking incident of mascot-on-mascot crime which occurred on Saturday, as Rufus the Bobcat viciously tackled and molested the Ohio State mascot, Brutus Buckeye, just prior to the meeting between the two teams at the Horseshoe. http://outofbounds.nbcsports.com/2010/09/post-781.html.php Somehow the phrase mascot-on-mascot crime cracks me up.\n\nHey Brian, museum lady claims the odd tool - a froe?- my husband is holding in his hand once belonged to Abraham Lincoln. http://aroundgoshen.blogspot.com/2010/09/froe.html\n\nI always wondered why in the world Alton Brown's pizza dough recipe called for a chewable vitamin c tab. Sorry to have missed yesterday's wonderful word discussion while on my third and certainly not final trip to greater Detroit. All right, like 50 miles west. Where I have leased a house. And must add to the already posted sites and cites, you forgot, it is sites, cites and sights! Then there is wallah! Tell me you haven't run into this version of voila on the web. The discussion about gays and churches spurs me to share the story that is the lastest of the many last straws in my long gone relationship with the Dutch Reformed Church. The President of one of the two seminaries, (the husband of one of my long ago HS teachers) was fired and defrocked after quietly going to Massachusetts to conduct a lesbian wedding ceremony. For his own daughter in a state where it is legal.\n\nBasset, neither do they go to the license branch in Michigan but rather to the Secretary of State's office. Of which there many.\n\nI'm not much for zombie movies, but will heartily recommend the book \"World War Z, an Oral History of the Zombie Wars,\" by Max Brooks, son of Mel. Done in the most straightforward manner and seriously entertaining.\n\nI also find baseball boring, but still love it. I grew up going to Tiger games in the Al Kaline/Micky Lolich years, and as a tween had Denny McLaine's (sp?) Sports Illustrated cover on my bedroom wall. My uncle was a GM bigwig, and most of my Tiger Stadium memories are seen from GM's great seats on the 3rd base line. I also enjoyed living in a city with a Northwoods League team, a summer collegiate league. The Rochester Honkers had huge community support and filled up Mayo Field night after night. Private efforts are underway to build a field and bring a Northwoods League team to Elkhart. And hey, badmouth AMerican Idol all you want, but Dancing With the Stars is so ludicrously strange and wierd I can't stay away. It's the only reality show I've ever watched. Week one just ended. David Hasselhoff was sooo bad, he cha cha'd like a man wearing a back brace, and has joined the infamous ranks of \"stars\" sent home week one. Which includes Tucker Carlson and Kenny Maine. Kenny Maine has been far better doing deadpan Dancing commentary while wearing sparkling eye shadow, than he was during his one week as a dancer. So there, baseball and Dancing, all together now. And with all the NFL and NBA players that have done Dancing, where is MLB?\n\nThe I.M. Pei designed library building in Columbus, IN was a disaster. Probably still is. After it opened the lower level flooded every time it rained. They finally build an expensive I.M. Pei designed addition to stop the flooding. The lights on the Main floor do not provide enough light for me to read by. And can not be changed or upgraded because they are committed to the architectural integrity of their building. On the other hand the huge Henry Moore sculpture on the library plaza is a joy. I love the story of its trip to Columbus. Barge to Jeffersonville, then a special truck for which I 65 was closed - I think overnight on a Sunday, because it was beyond wide load and the truck could only go about ten miles an hour. I've been involved in the architect interview process for years. My number one goal is that the architect design my building, not his building. Some years ago I was involved in interviews for which the Michael Graves firm made a proposal in partnership with an Indianapolis firm. Most of the arch. firms we interviewed talked about communication and partnership. The Graves firm talked about how famous we would be if we built a Michael Graves building. We selected a different firm, and designed a lovely building that was never, will never be built, mostly due to acquisition problems with the river front brownfield property we planned to build on. The property was foreclosed upon by a last resort financer in Chicago, and while our agreement to purchase was still valid, the environmentals turned out to be so much worse than we had expected (after seeing a year old Level 1 report) that we walked away from the property. In fact just now six years later the City has purchased the property and torn down the asbestos laden foundry building, but done nothing yet about the lead and arsenic contamination on the land.\n\nJohn Scalzi did a great piece on the whining professor to whom Jeff Borden refers. See it at http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/09/21/why-not-feeling-rich-is-not-being-poor-and-other-things-financial/ . Today he links to a story about a young New York lawyer who hates her job but isn't sure she wants to take up a great job offer at only $120,000 because she doesn't want to feel poor. http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/09/24/new-rule-for-the-internets-six-figure-income-division/\n\nMichigan's high school sport is football, Indiana's is basketball. My old high school is now a middle school. Only one of the two buildings I remember remains, and it was completely wrapped in new construction when my youngest brother was there. My other younger brother (referred to as my big brother as he is 6'3\")goes to homecoming every year, as he sings in the Alumni madrigal choir for the event. He's the only one of us that still lives there. I am 4th generation, all of whom lived in that small town. My generation is the first without a business on Main St. I wouldn't live there for anything. I consider myself an escaped Dutch girl.\n\nYeah, LSSI has been around for a long time, and is not well thought of in the general library community. And highly paid professional employees with years of seniority get laid off and then rehire offers at lower pay scales. Here in Indiana -which I am about to leave- Our Man Mitch has had the goal for sometime of forcibly merging all of Indiana's public libraries into county systems. Word is he has been talking to LSSI about managing that process when it happens. OMM claims he will have control of both houses come fall and will be able to forcibly make this happen. His talk is all about reducing overhead by sharing it. This past year LSSI lobbied against a state rule in some other state, I believe Florida, which required any public library receiving state aid to have an MLS holding Director. LSSi claimed the sole reason for the rule was to keep them out of the state. They lost. Indiana's relatively new property tax reform process is having a large negative impact on public library revenue in the state. Indianapolis-Marion County PL is having a tough time, and lost much of its community support as a result of the construction screw ups and total cost of the new Main that opened a few years ago. When they are covered in the Indy Star the comments are ferocious. My new library as of Oct. 11, was founded from scratch five years ago after years of the municipal govt paying three nearby communities for library access. It has a generous millage, part of it permanent. Indiana folks and others, a millage is a tax rate voted on by the citizen/residents. The municipal board is looking for fast growth and total remodeling/renovation of a building that is currently only partly used. People love their libraries. Except for the Chamber types who hate taxes. Many communities have demonstrated successfully against LSSI to keep their libraries public\n\nWhen I lived in Jackson County in southern Indiana it was standard practice to pay an annual fire fee to the local volunteer fire department. I remember it as $10. Homeowners received one letter, then a follow up visit from a fire fighter. We always paid, never needed the fire department, but did have the experience of a water truck wrecking part of our yard while going to a pasture fire next door. We just fixed it. Better put out the pasture fire next door then see where it might go.\n\nThis morning there was a sandhill crane standing outside the window of my new office.\n\nWhen it comes to leaves etc. we are fans of our mulching mower. Whips those leaves into invisibility.\n\nI've just moved to Oakland County Michigan, the next county north of Detroit's Wayne County. (I am in the western edge, known as the lakes district.) And just got cable installed. The network shows are filled with nasty ads, from unidentifiable organizations. My library is distributing the Oakland County LWV election guide, which appears to cover every election coming up, including tax millages, library boards, township boards, and more more. Having been here not quite two weeks I feel I know a heck of a lot about an election that I will not be able to vote in. Our facebook page has a link to the online version of the LWV voter guide, http://www.facebook.com/pages/Commerce-Township-Community-Library/170243933848\n\nIt's a little early for those \"gales of November\", Edmund Fitzgerald sunk on November 10. I know this because, as I have told you before, it is my husband's birthday.\n\nTrue about Indiana. The State Historical Society magazine (Traces?) recently did an article on that shameful chapter in the state's history. And Parke County oddly enough was where most of those considered unfit were living.\n\nWell, we all learned that Jon Stewart can't sing.\n\nBought no candy, kept the lights off. Have done so ever since my kid left for college, and wasn't there to help with the door.\n\nNews blast! Keith Olbermann suspended by NBC for not reporting political donations as required.\n\nI think I am the only person who has actually seen the movie Man in the Moon, starring Jim Carrey as comedian Andy Kaufman. Courtney Love played Kaufman's wife in an uncredited appearance, and I thought she was beautiful and luminous. According to imdb.com Courtney Love was in Sid and Nancy, playing a character named Gretchen.\n\nAs a child I could hear the Holland Lighthouse fog horn on foggy nights, and always found it very comforting.\n\nAlso my Dad's 79th, must remember to call. And Cute Overload just makes me crabby.\n\nI thought it was Red Bull and Jaegermeister. (sp?) My kid's last roommate's boyfriend was a marketing rep for Red Bull and he was even handing out small sample bottles of Jaegermeister. We ended up with one, and laughed as neither of us has ever had a Red Bull.\n\nThe previous occupant of my desk left behind a Henry the Hatter business card. You can check them out at http://www.henrythehatterdetroit.com .\n\nIf you have a septic tank you shouldn't put anything down the disposal. My new house has septic and NO disposal so I don't have to worry. And I have the coolest kitchen faucet of all time. I love Dancing With the Stars, though there is no one to root for this season. And I always tivo it, just to be able to skip the commercials, and the really bad guest artists on results night. Plan for Saturday is an early trip to Eastern Market. Will I see you there Nancy?\n\nPerfect timing cooz, there's Broder at number 4.\n\nThe wilderness of Fishers? And here I thought it was the fastest growing suburban community in the state.\n\nMy aren't we a quiet bunch. Still recovering from your turkey OD? Anyone willing to admit to shopping today? I made a mid day visit to Dick's Sporting Goods and Trader Joe's at my visiting daughter's request. Counting lunch at PEI WEI spent just under $100. Tomorrow is Ikea with visiting friends. I have been wondering how to pronounce that restaurant's name.\n\nWow. Exactly 24 hours between comments, to the minute.\n\nWe headed there early this a.m. Missed a free way interchange and ended up on Grand River for most of the trip, then lost in downtown Detroit. Took us two hours to make what should have been a 40 minute trip. Just as we pulled in to the market our anticipated guests called to say they were going to be earlier than expected. They got to our house about 15 minutes before we got home. Looks like a cool market, I am looking forward to going again when I can stay a while.\n\nDexter, if you want to know how cold it really is look here: http://thefuckingweather.com/\n\nOur house looked a little like that as well. Our daughter connected our WII to her Netflix account which has been kind of fun. Went to Ikea as well, after all those multi hour trips to Chicago area Ikea stores it is kind of amazing to have one 20 minutes down the freeway.\n\nHallelujah Chorus flash mobs: http://www.etiquettehell.com/?p=1699 I liked the second one best.\n\nJust read “The Warmth of Other Suns” by Isabel Wilkerson about the great migration of black Americans out of the South into the North, Midwest and West. I heard the author interviewed by Terry Gross on Fresh Air and also read the book. That southern migration of blacks and of white southerners is a big part of the history of Michigan cities like Detroit, Flint, and Saginaw. For a fictional view of the white migration I recommend the wonderful novel \"The Doll Maker\" by Harriet Arnow.\n\nLAMary, noting on your calendar is so yesterday. Schedule a recording on your DVR/TIVO instead.\n\nThe \"Storage Wars\" review makes it sound like everything is junk. Remember though, that someone once bought most of Martin Luther King's papers in one of those storage auctions.\n\nI took Valtrex for a while some years ago in an effort to put a stop to recurring attacks of shingles. It worked. So Valtrex doesn't always mean genital herpes. Although in Paris' case......\n\nWell Deborah I must still be in the boring part. Although the Stones are just getting started.\n\nSpectator's Bar and Restaurant in Saugatuck has the butt washer/dryer toilet in the women's handicapped stall, and we stand in line to use it even though the other stalls are vacant. Among your options are front wash, rear wash, and blow dry. There is a big ad about how you can get your own on the inside of the door.\n\nGoogle has addressed the issue of bad publicity leading to higher rankings: http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/12/02/5567082-google-sucker-punches-online-retail-bully .\n\nOn the subject of contacting your representatives: my daughter recently contacted her state rep to ask him to support the Sunday liquor sales bill. She says she received a canned reply that made it clear that Sunday liquor sales were immoral and so was anyone who supported it. This is a kid with lots of lobbying experience from her two year internship with the Indiana Wildlife Federation. She was quite horrified by the response.\n\nI hear gunfire here quite regularly as I drive by the Detroit Gun Club regularly and on weekends the gun blasts are constant. The pic of the google house is side on so it's hard to judge the size. But probably not as large as the total garage space.\n\nRana, I once had a car that farted. Worse than a dog fart for sure.\n\nOK Sue, snow, the quiet lake, Christmas glimmers, be happy the Christ child comes. My Christmas songs in German are, the familiar, Oh Tannenbaum, Oh Tannenbaum, wie treu sind deine Blätter, Du grünst nicht nur zur Sommerzeit,Nein auch im Winter, wenn es schneit.O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum,etc. Und this one: Oh Ihr Kind­er­lein, kom­met, o kom­met doch all, zum Bethlehem komm zu den manger and the stall. Whoops ran out of German.\n\nSalt person here. I can tell if you didn't put enough salt in your potato boiling water. My best friend is a pepper person. I find it hard to eat her soup.\n\nPeter, my understanding is that the under 30 degrees thing applies only to the concession areas, and they have already brought in heaters. The real question is: Will there be beer? I enjoyed the story of hundreds of volunteers coming out to help shovel the field.\n\nIn 1996 I spent $90 for a sixth row seat to see Julie Andrews in Victor/Victoria on Broadway. In 2003 I spent $90 for a front row seat at Lion King in Toronto. In both cases the most I ever spent on a ticket to anything. And in both cases well worth it. Not sure I would spend the same amount for Spider Man. I see Mary Poppins is currently in Detroit, wonder how much those tickets are? EDIT: Main floor tickets are $345 and $408. Cheapest back row balcony tickets are $100. Majority of tickets seem to be in the $118 and $135 levels.\n\nPeter, I found those prices by searching \"mary poppins\" and detroit on google.\n\nSue, one of my best high school experiences was being in \"Fiddler on the Roof\". We did one musical, one drama and one comedy a year.\n\nMy brother has a deep bass voice, which he says means he can only be the bad guy in community theater musicals. Most recently Caiaphas in Jesus Christ Superstar and Bill Sykes in Oliver, and multiple times as Jud in Oklahoma. He enjoyed playing Eddie in Pump Boys and Dinettes as Eddie never says a word onstage but is still a great character.\n\nWhen my daughter was in London a couple of years ago they went to the theatre a lot. They had learned that if you showed up at the last minute with a student ID you could get really cheap tickets. I know that they saw Wicked, Billy Elliott and Les Miz, each multiple times. In looking up ticket prices in Detroit for Mary Poppins I did learn that Les Miz will be passing through town in the new year.\n\nMy husband and daughter are so anxious to see True Grit that I expect them to be standing in the drive with their coats on ready to go when I get home from work. I am looking forward to The King's Speech.\n\nMerry Christmas to all. Gifts are opened, showers have started, and we will soon be off to the inlaws. Across the state to see my side tomorrow. My dear husband got me a gift certificate to the restaurant he's been wanting to try. Among other fine things. A new lap top and a new netbook were discovered under the tree.\n\nThe only real fabric store I have found since moving to west metro Detroit is in downtown Royal Oak. The only quilt shop I have found is in Milford. Yes, there is a Joanne's. Yes there is a hobby lobby, but I no longer patronize them after visiting their web page. Let's just say the prolife message scattered among the hobby crap seemed so so out of place that I went away and didn't come back.\n\nWe've talked about Indianapolis earthquakes before. As I recall Jefftmmo and I were both in Methodist Hospital in Indy for the 1987 earthquake. He was a chaplain. I was a pregnant woman held prisoner for 11 weeks. Sorry about your loss Scout, two years ago I held my old man Shih Tzu as he took his last breath. So tough.\n\nTook advantage of yesterday's decent temperature and scattered sunshine and took an exploring ride in our new neighborhood where we discovered the Detroit Finn Cooperative Summer Camp Association on the shores of Loon Lake. It snuck up on us. Suddenly the woods on either side of the gravel road were filled with tiny ancient looking cabins, with shutters in lieu of windows. A little further down we found several larger buildings, and a nice beach and picnic area. We still had no clue, and then we saw the historical marker - which was not in English! A little more exploring brought us to the other side of the marker - the English side - where we discovered what it was. Founded in 1925, the dance hall was built in 1927. And the most amazing thing: nothing about the Association in Wikipedia! I knew there had been Lithuanian family camps in the Three Rivers area. We are looking forward to checking it out during the summer, when they celebrate the Finnish midsummer festival. Or so the marker told us.\n\nLAMary, only bad guacamole has mayonaisse in it.\n\nEggs aren't dairy? We learned long ago not to order anything listed on the menu as guacamole dip.\n\nI knew that. It's just that in the grocery store they're dairy. Sort of. And along with dairy not eaten by vegans.\n\nIs it a tmi day or is it just me?\n\nHaving been the first person I knew who didn't change her name upon marriage, lo these 30some years ago, I call it my life name. And if you had a unique ethnic name with a Z in it you probably would have kept yours too!\n\nMini skirts for me too LAMary, with fishnets.\n\nProspero, I'm sorry I looked. The Santa creeped me out. Myst be that Calvinist Dutch Reformed childhood.\n\nWe were younger then, Del.\n\nBad news here. Mitch Albom got the big above the fold cover story on the front page of today's Free Press. It's about Michigan football of course.\n\nI too have the house dream. I recently read \"Life would be perfect if I lived in that house\" and she too had the dream. Until I read her comments and the stuff about her house dream research, I thought I was alone. My favorite dream house turned out to have a canoe rental business operating out of the other side with a long porch on a river.\n\nI was writing this comment on yesterday's post when today's post appeared so I put it here even though it is irrelevant. During the Haley Barbour news uproar last week one of the news articles I read mentioned a book by Willie Morris called \"Yazoo\" which looked at the 1970 integration of the Yazoo MS schools. I just finished it and it was a very different story than the one Barbour told. Morris was then the editor of Harper's and himself a graduate of Yazoo schools. N word appeared regulary, when quoting casual conversation. One of the things Morris said was it isn't the kids, it's the parents. When this generation grows up I am hopeful things will be different. Well all these years later it is and it isn't. This depressed me because I have been saying the same thing about my daughter's generation. My library is part of a large catalog cooperative that includes many if not most of two county's worth of metro Detroit. This 1971 publication was owned by only one of the libraries in the group, and an early computer produced catalog card was pasted inside the cover to be used as a pocket. This was as interesting to me as the book itself. Which I do recommend.\n\nI've done the bra fit thing, only to find that bras are not made in my size. Once you know your size try Just my Size at JMS.com which carries a huge assortment of hard to find sizes. And let's just say there are few As and Bs available after 38.\n\nDeborah, I feel the same way about being around these wonderful writers. And Prospero, my daughter had a terrible fear of clowns. Once in downtown Indy we took her, then aged two, to the once thriving Union Station. On the way in we walked past clowns doing balloons. We sat down in the restaurant and she grabbed her nose and wouldn't let go until we got back to the car. We finally got her to tell us \"clowns going to get my nose.\"\n\nJeff tmmo, a small wicked grin? Mine was a little bigger and included a whoop.\n\nJeff(tmmo) the current issue of National Geographic has an article on the mounds in Missouri, and some horrifying pictures of the destruction of a mound located in St. Louis.\n\nThis week's Entertainment Weekly review of Chua's books essentially says the reviewer is looking forward to reading the daughter's memoir some day.\n\nI slice my fingernails regularly. Then there was the wooden spoon that got pulverized in the blender when making guacamole for a Super Bowl party. Can you say strainer? You guys make me feel like a bad unsophisticated eater. I love green bean casserole. I love kool whip. Oh well.\n\nHell week? In the college bookstore world, in which I was long ago employed, it's called Rush Week.\n\nBut in Indiana you are required to publicly declare your party when voting in the primaries. You can be informally questioned if you request the primary ballot for a party other then that for which you previously voted. When I first moved to Indiana I was horrified to learn they kept track.\n\nSue, back in 08 the South Bend polls turned away a large group of retired nuns because they didn't have ID.\n\nSome years ago Time magazine did an issue that looked at all the gun deaths in this country on a certain day. In my vague memory there were suicides, there were murders, there were accidents. They told the story with photo of each person.\n\nI remember the bottle of locally pressed olive oil you saw at Eastern Market. Wasn't that worth $75??\n\nI quit reading the comments at Pioneer Woman some time ago. They all say, \"sounds great, I can't wait to make it.\" Actually I quit reading the blog as well. But did buy the first book.\n\nWow. Good bye Keith O. I would like to know the behind the scenes story.\n\nIf you seek a pleasant peninsula look about you. Through the fog and snow. During my Indiana years I always appreciated that Indiana had a song, and people actually sang it. I don't think \"Back Home Again\" is an official state song, but many times it seemed as though it was.\n\nThe big storms I remember are the Blizzard of 78 when I was snowed in in Ann Arbor, and the famous Minneapolis Halloween Blizzard of 91, which I spent in the downtown Hyatt Regency. Seems odd that grocery madness would occur in the Detroit metro area today when the storm isn't actually going to hit us until tomorrow evening.\n\nJeff(tmmo) my training session scheduled for Thursday, to be held a few miles down the road, has already been cancelled. No snow yet.\n\nI've got a snow day tomorrow, everything is starting to shut down, even though the snow isn't quite here yet. Kid tells me Indiana University has shut down due to ice.\n\nDeborah, according to The Weather Channel there is a spun out bus in that lane on Lake Shore and all traffic is now in the northbound lane. They also just pointed out the thunder and lightning in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin which seems to mean this is really a serious storm. The worst is yet to get to us.\n\nDuke Energy is updating their outage numbers in Indiana on Facebook. http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.duke-energy.com%2Findiana%2Foutages%2Fcurrent.asp&h=a948f Starting yesterday here and continuing on today these are the new words for snow storm I have learned: Snowmageddon! Snowpocalypse! Snowtorious BIG! Snowicane! Blizzaster! Got any more. I mean if all we're going to talk about is the weather....\n\nCatherine, when there is a snow day there is bread baking at our house. Wheat came already ground.\n\nDisappointment here too, a few inches, light snow now. About to do some bread dough in my continuing experiments with the recipe from the book \"Artisan Bread in 5 minutes a Day.\" I can hear the snow blower running in my driveway. Thanks honey.\n\nI had ice on the inside of my windshield this morning. Oh, I miss my attached garage.\n\nHad to share. I have just discovered http://regretsy.com , where really bad stuff available on etsy is highlighted. Have been giggling for some time, so is you need a giggle...\n\nWe had catalytic converter issues with a Pontiac 6000 which we still refer to as \"the farting car.\" Of course it was also probably the only Pontiac 6000 in the world with Pirelli tires. (My brother is in the high end tire business. Here's hoping that Alan's car problems are fixed and that it's not farting.\n\nDidn't see them all last night, but watched the Chrysler commercial on the Freep page and loved it. I also got a big kick out of the Bridgestone ad in which the beaver returns the favor.\n\nSick here too, shaking with fever. Just ate my first meal since Monday evening and it was only toast and a tangerine. I just don't get vegan. Vegetarian yes, but vegan? If you read the labels on those frozen not meat products they appear to be made from mystery chemicals. Chemicals good, meat bad? On yesterday's subject of creationism in biology class I would refer you to http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/ . If you click back a month or two you can read about the writer's own experience with creationism in his kid's biology class and how he dealt with it in an appropriate and civil manner.\n\nNancy, are these the French ruin porn photographers you hosted around town a while back? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kisa-lala/detroit-the-ruins-of-an-e_b_810688.html\n\nI see millions of typos all the time. Although the wierdest one, recently I read one where the author kept referring to girls wearing berets. And I thought he meant, well, berets. Realized half way through he meant barrettes. Which in southern Indiana are brets. I have access to a lot of ARCs, advance reading copies, and they have big notices in them that this is not a final proofread copy and only the final copy should be used for quotes.\n\nGreat story in the Freep today about the making of that Chrysler ad: http://www.freep.com/article/20110208/BUSINESS01/102080380/Chrysler-Super-Bowl-ad-How-all-came-together\n\nI remember seeing Broadcast News in an East Lansing theater with my boyfriend, now husband. At some point he stood up and said very loudly \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to watch this movie any more. I'll wait for you in the lobby.\" I have no idea why. The only other movie I remember walking out on is Barry Lyndon in the same theater. We thought it had ended and we heaved a huge sigh of relief. As we stood up to leave up flashed the words \"End of Part One.\" We didn't stay for part two.\n\nFor Brian, from boing-boing: If you are not already reading Disunion—the New York Times' amazing blog about the American Civil War and everything that led up to it—then I pity you. Both because you've been missing out on a fascinating look at American history and cultural analysis that goes far beyond anything you learned in school, and because you're about to waste your entire Thursday reading through the archives. http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/disunion/\n\nI found a link to the Enquirer's Boehner story on Americablog: http://www.nationalenquirer.com/john_boehner_house_speaker_sex_scandal_two_women/celebrity/70110\n\nI will say the same thing Deborah said: \"I’m still home from work sick, that’s why I’m commenting so much today.\" But I bet you didn't get a shot like mine today. The not in the arm kind. Weird headlines of the day, both from MSNBC: Viagra demand surges before Valentine's Day and Trump will decide by June on presidential bid. Trump? Trump? Are you kidding? Brian, my daughter talks about going to visit Oxford with her genetics professor and he had tears in his eyes seeing Darwin's journals up close. For each one, something.\n\nWhat happened to this morning's expectations re Egypt? Now there will be an explosion of anger. I've always hated TVs in the doctor's waiting room, but not today.\n\nDidn't the Tin Caps used to be the Mad Ants? I was sorry they changed it, but I guess you had to be sort of local history cognizant to get it. And Dorothy, I've seen several Johnny Appleseeds. I like the Mark Twains better. I went several times to an Indiana Humanities Council thing where they showcased performer programs available for educational programs via grants. And I absolutely hate all those James Whitcomb Rileys. After I sat through my sixth or seventh Riley after dinner speech, not all the same James, and I swore I'd NEVER NEVER NEVER put myself through that again. And whose the cartoonist from Nashville IN? No, I will stop right there.\n\nDeborah, my daughter saw Les Miz three times in her semester in London and loved it. And I have bought a few of those Ball U shirts over the years. Usually for my brothers, who thought they were so cool. And Jen, thanks for the correction on the Mad Ants and it is such a great Fort Wayne name.\n\nIn college I worked with a student named Karla Hunsucker. Last I saw her she was excited to be marrying a Smith.\n\nJeff(tmmo) answer is nope. I found it: For twenty-five years, from 1905-1930, \"Abe Martin\" was the mouthpiece for Kin Hubbard's daily quips in The Indianapolis News, which, accompanied by sketches of Abe and his friends in action, were syndicated across the nation. I think the imitator I saw was doing the character, not the cartoonist. The Brown County State Park has the Abe Martin lodge. Know any more buildings named after a cartoon character?\n\nHarry Baals made Boing-Boing. Comments are fun. http://www.boingboing.net/2011/02/11/fort-wyane-is-about.html\n\nFWIW, \"I am Number Four\" is an excellent YA novel.\n\nAs to the ebook reader - Public libraries are adding downloadable ebooks to their downloadable audio programs, all in the standard epub format used by every device except, you guessed it, the Kindle. Will you want to be able to use your library's free ebook checkouts?\n\nYou're OK Jolene. I will admit to a pack of cheese and crackers from the machine. Otherwise it's toast with cheese or bagel with cream cheese at home, with whatever fruit I've got. One last clementine.\n\nMcDonald's \"oatmeal\" has 11 weird ingredients, more sugar than a Snickers. http://www.boingboing.net/2011/02/25/mcdonalds-oatmeal-ha.html\n\nI was very aware when I posted the boingboing link that yes, we had already discussed Bittman's rant on McD's oatmeal. My point, which I obviously failed to make, was Hey Nance, you're ahead of boingboing on this one. Cool.\n\nKeith Olbermann is back: http://foknewschannel.com/\n\nI skipped the Oscars as usual as well, though did go online to check out the red carpet and see who won. I only went to one movie last year. And it won best picture!\n\nOur daughter brought us a bottle of Sriracha sauce over the holidays, and it quickly became a staple. Sriracha and brown sugar mixed is a great stir fry sauce.\n\nMy parent's wedding pictures from 1953 including one of those tiny spouse pictures - groom standing on hand of bride while she shook her finger at him - so it's not just a photoshop thing.\n\nMy husband and I did a Sheen or Quaddafi quiz last night and got two right out of eight. That's worse than hit or miss!\n\nMajor Pettigrew was wonderful. And got my vote for best cover of the year. And Moe99 if Amazon has enabled library lending for the Kindle they haven't got around to telling libraries about it. And right now libraries are signing on for every e-book service they can find. Harper Collins has just announced that all library e-book versions of their titles will now cease to exist after 26 checkouts.\n\nLibrary e-book programs are controlled by a license. We don't actually buy and own the e-book, we license the right to it. In the largest program, Overdrive, the one shared by a large consortium of libraries in the Detroit Metro area, and available to Fort Wayne/Allen County library users as well, only as many copies as you have purchased of the e-book can be out at one time, so you may find yourself on a waiting list for the digital version. And yes it will disappear after two weeks or whatever is the designated check-out. Other programs such as NetLibrary have more generous licensing regulations, at least with their audio books, and will allow multiple simultaneous downloads. It was hard to miss last week's announcement by publisher Harper Collins that as of this week new titles licensed through Overdrive would be limited to 26 checkouts and would either be no longer available after 26 or would need to be repurchased. I understand their point in terms of revenue and author's rights, but it still seems, well stupid to me to not allow multiple simultaneous uses of a digital product. These products provide e-books in the \"standard\" epub format which can be read on any reader except for the Kindle. And for your ipad you will need an app. Overdrive also has a resident user restriction which makes sense to me. If you want to come to my library's web page to download epubs you must enter the appropriate library card number which is verified against our user database. No reciprocal privileges for electronic resources. Our pricing is based on population served. I have just signed the contract to add music downloads to our e-book and audio-book download selection. This is a product called Freegal and makes available mostly Sony music product. And yes all Overdrive e-book products are protected by DRM.\n\nI loved \"Major Pettigrew\" and it also wins my personal award for best cover of 2010.\n\nSuzanne, I also have that despairing feeling that my lifetime profession is dying off. I discouraged my own daughter from considering a library/information science master's program. Though whether that IU SPEA Master's in Public Policy/Environmental Policy she is currently half way through will serve her better? I have no idea. It is getting her to Oxford for the summer though, which is cool, even though I have to babysit her very hairy dog.\n\nDid the best I could for Mardi Gras. I am wearing my Mardi Gras beads in the office. Purple ones.\n\nDorothy, I've used a binder with plastic sleeves for my personal cookbook for many years. It has old recipe cards taped in it, and photocopies with holes punched. If I see a recipe I like in a book I just photocopy it. Every couple of years I have to switch a bigger binder, and I think I've reached my max!\n\nReductions in Michigan state aid will have a huge negative impact on the regional library cooperatives, which already took a 40% hit a couple of years ago. In my region it will hurt if not destroy the delivery system that allows libraries in two metro counties to share books, as well the delivery component of melcat, the statewide shared catalog. OTOH We are thankful that the budget includes a specific line for the MEL's shared databases. Probably due to the power of the college/university lobby is what I hear.\n\nThe circuit breaker tax reform in Indiana had a huge negative impact on all local government in Indiana including public libraries. And as libraries were dealing with the impact the State implemented new, more difficult to meet, rules regarding staff certification and library standards.\n\nPictures of post-earthquake libraries in Japan. http://togetter.com/li/110567 I did hit the let Google translate button and enjoyed the oddness of the translations.\n\nI'm not the least bit Irish either. As one of Dutch heritage I am wearing my touch of Orange. Go William of Orange! Oh, and Go Butler!\n\nOh man, another buzzer beater. Go Butler. Good thing I'm the boss, though the rest of you can watch your team's game online at work too as long as you keep the volume down and read something work related.\n\nYes to Butler. They got all my money and they got my heart. The two games so far this year and every game in the NCAAs last year are what I call heart attack games. Last second every time. Last night's game was unbelievable. My Butler grad may be an IU student but we both will root for Butler, probably for the rest of our lives.\n\nHappy Birthday Brian! I can claim to have met this fine gentleman, for a quick lunch at a Taco Bell in downtown Fort Wayne. He was fine company, and I love your writing voice.\n\nI still have my Russian textbook from MSU as well, wonder if it is the same. (It's red. Librarians hate it when you say that.) Since all my books are still in boxes I can't even check. I do find these days that if you say to a Russian Speaker, dosvadanya tovaritch, they will laught. Because no one says comrade anymore. Except perhaps those of us who learned our Russian (what little I remember) during the Cold War. And as to yesterday's comments, I think of Chicago as the sound track to my senior year. Homecoming theme: Color My World. Prom theme: Saturday in the Park.\n\nGood student discounts work all the way through college, just keep sending your agent those report cards. These days that means printouts thereof. State Farm has a safe teen driver discount program which involves a driving log, a dvd, and a brief test by the agent. Only good until your kid gets her first speeding ticket.\n\nI for one am quite pleased to be full of whit.\n\nI have recently seen in the news the same no taxes paid for Bank of America and BP. Go Butler!\n\nGo Butler! (Sorry Dorothy)\n\nMarkH, Butler lost last year's top player, Gordon Hayward, to the NBA draft. He would have been a junior, plays for Utah. Today there was a freshman whose name escaped me, (Hopkins?) who played several times and made a great showing including a 3 pointer. Only two seniors in the starting line-up, so a chunk of the team will return next year. Brian, my daughter sent me a picture of the Bulldog captioned (in the LOLcats way) I haz broke your bracket. Ha!\n\nDexter, there's a facebook event on Friday: Wear glasses to show your support for Brad Stevens and Butler.\n\nI am very happy with the low flow toilet in my rental house. The water softener however isn't working and there's a lot of mineral in the well water. The dishwasher is a mineral mess, as is my Oneida stainless.\n\nBasset's parents used to drive to Illinois to load up on phosphated detergent. Mine used to go to Illinois to stock up on liquor, as Michigan did not allow sales. And no, my parents weren't serious drinkers, they were serious party givers. The suits and serious dresses kind of party.\n\nTurns out the so-called birth certificate Trump showed wasn't one. It was the commemorative certificate the hospital issues to the family. Love this snarky bit from Ben Smith at Politico: \"Trump's mother, it should be noted, was born in Scotland, which is not part of the United States. His plane is registered in the Bahamas, also a foreign country. This fact pattern -- along with the wave of new questions surrounding what he claims is a birth certificate -- raises serious doubts about his eligibility to serve as President of the United States.\"\n\nI just read nn.c on the taxpayer's time. When I saw the DutchDay headline I thought it would be something special for your resident \"Dutch girls\" LAMary and I. Oh well. Elmore Leonard will do.\n\nDorothy, if you go to SF, ask me about fabric shops before you go.\n\nYou won't need a car. There is a phenomenal high end fabric store just off Union Square in the central city, and the BART train will take you right under the bay to within a block of Stone Mountain and Daughters in Berkeley. And Chez Panisse is almost across the street but make your reservation as soon as you can.\n\nI saw the Dr. Doolittle circus scenes being filmed in San Francisco. Circus was next to Fisherman's Wharf. For great seafood I recommend Scoma's, http://www.scomas.com/?, several piers down from Fisherman's Wharf. Actually all of my SF seafood experiences have been excellent. And the best late night bar view in town is the restaurant at the top of the Grand Hyatt near Union Square.\n\nI will add my vote to Muir Woods. We did it on a Grey Line bus tour. Also don't miss Alcatraz. Partly for the sight of the silent touring crowd in their audio headphones following the audio directionr, in a most amusing kind of \"wave.\" Britex is the fabric store of which I could not remember the name. I remember an ALA conference in SF in June at which everyone I knew went out to buy a coat.\n\nStephen Colbert Sings \"Friday\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU1v_XKgEPc EDIT: Just saw your link to this facebook Nancy. After I posted, just so you know. Go Butler.\n\nHydroponic supplies about to open up near us as well.\n\nYes, Butler. And by more than 2 points this time.\n\nLove this story. It's all about the bulldog. http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/story/14893284/with-discipline-butler-has-done-the-impossible\n\nMy ultra straight grad student daughter told me several of her friends smoked pot and in her opinion the only thing it did was make them stupid. My husband and I did note once that she would not have hung out with us in high school. (It was the late 60s for him and the early 70s for me.) I've been told that at the Grand Rapids marijuana clinic the doctor visit costs $200 and you are guaranteed your medical marijuana card. Go Butler!\n\nOddly enough there always assorted hemostats for sale in the vendor mall at big quilt shows. Can be used as a quilting or sewing tool.\n\nThe Mennonite thrift shop we frequented in Goshen had men's undies nicely displayed -- on hangers. No women's though.\n\nThanks MarkH. It was a good run, but it was a truly ugly game. Butler is my team.\n\nI got that Epsilon breach email from Citibank. Who I do not believe actually has my email address. No personal financial data was included in the breach. According to them. And one last time, Go Butler. It was an ugly game, but hey, they're my team. I have two degrees from two Big Ten schools, but it will always be Butler for me, win or lose.\n\nMy brother in law works at the GM Proving Grounds and gets a car for a weekend once a month. Says the next one will be a Volt, perhaps we'll get him to cruise over for a visit.\n\nCorrection to earlier post. I received a letter from Citibank, not an email. They really don't have my email address.\n\nHave never seen Sex in the City in any form, have no desire to. Did buy a Kobo e-reader the other day. Haven't bought anything for it, I've been downloading e-books from my library.\n\nWe are having a Tiger's Home opening day hot dog lunch today at the township hall. We are supposed to wear Tiger shirts. I am wearing the only team shirt I actually own. Go Butler!\n\nBrian that would be Lake Macatawa, generally referred to as Lake Mac. I once got to do a fireworks cruise there courtesy of my bff who worked at Squirt before it was sold to Dr. Pepper and moved to Texas.\n\nDo check out today's Goodle logo which honors today's anniversary of \"first man in space\" Yuri Gugarin, sp?\n\nWell Alex down there in Fort Wayne, it has always been my understanding that Hot Browns can be ordered only in the greater Louisville area. So where were you going to order that Hot Brown? Just wondered.\n\nI lived just north of Louisville for years, and they certainly claim the Hot Brown as theirs, invented at the Brown Hotel in Louisville. I've only walked through but did attend a wonderful performance of Zap Mama at the renovated Brown Theater.\n\nLAMary, my daughter will be in Oxford this summer. I already told her to bring me the tackiest royal wedding souvenir she could find. Want me to tell her to get you a tea towel?\n\nMy only complaint is that the previous and next post are no longer shown at top and bottom of page. I liked the one at the bottom because I could refresh the comments and could tell if there had been a new post. Up early this morning for a 7 a.m. meeting with a service club for which I was the speaker. I am feeling like a person who got up in the middle of the night. I was in the office last night till after 9 p.m. due to another meeting, so it seems like I just got out of here a few minutes ago.\n\nI've seen Jesus Christ Superstar on stage twice, once as a high school kid when it was new, and more recently a fully staged version that included my big voiced brother as the High Priest Caiphus. That was done in a sort of hippy punk style, the Roman soldiers were dressed in black and wearing gas masks, and the various crowds around Jesus included skate boarders and BMX bikes. And the death scene went on forever and was way overdone. Judas' suicide was by overdose. As kids we all took organ lessons and bought the sheet music for JCS. I could probably still sit down and play Herod's Song. EDIT: Like the change in the no longer scrolling scroll on the side.\n\nROGirl, I'm a library director in Oakland County. The update I received from the Troy Director stated only that they would remain open until the May date on which the City Council will once again consider the library budget. If that meeting does not result in further funding the library will still close in May with the time until the current budget year ends at the end of June to be used for an orderly shutdown as originally planned. That city council is allowed by law to levy a one mill library tax at any time but has chosen not to do so. Even if they do so now I do not believe they will collect any of the new tax until 2012.\n\nI will join Scout in saying \"Sparrow\" is one of my best reads of all time. For those who care, Hugo nominees were just announced.\n\nSenator Caswell gets worst person of the day: http://foknewschannel.com/worst-persons-for-april-25/#more-337 . Brian that Meijer's story gave me the creeps.\n\nSounds a lot like those porn names. If I am Lady Agnes Hans-Winterhalder I must be one of those German relatives.\n\nI scrolled through the White House easter egg hunt pictures and was delighted to see President Obama reading one of my very favorite children's books of all time \"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom.\" \"A called b, and b called c, I'll meet you at the top of the coconut tree. Chicka chicka boom boom, will there be enough room?\" It is probably stuck in my brain forever.\n\nJack Lessenbury, Michigan Radio's political commentator, was just talking about Americans aren't getting important news from Canada. He noted that yesterday's Canadian elections greatly changed the political landscape and what the impact might be on Michigan. He noted that the Detroit Free Press' front page did not address the Canadian news, but did feature \"a sports columnists blog about what he thinks about Obama bin Laden.\" You go, Jack.\n\nAccording to the Indy Star earlier today Trump has chosen to step out of the Pace Car thing. It was not revoked. He cited the time commitment for practice and his burgeoning political involvement, thus driving the Pace car perhaps not appropriate.\n\nJust checked Russell's Doc out myself. But nothing she has done since comes anywhere near The Sparrow. My grad student daughter got home late Tuesday night and left this a.m. for Detroit Metro. Sometime early tomorrow she will arrive in Frankfort for 6 weeks of classes, two weeks free to bum around, and then six weeks at Oxford. I am a dog foster parent for the summer. I even have a power of attorney that says so. Not sure why I needed the POA.\n\nAs to prohibition: we visited Holly Michigan the other day. It is the home of Battle Alley, to which Carrie Nation once took her ax. Another story from the past.\n\nSo Dexter, you got a problem with honoring the great author of \"Mr. Tickle?\"\n\nAlbom's sappy column does a good deed. I ran into a blog post today that is thankful for Albom's column about a homeless veteran that died recently. His column helped a group of longtime online friends figure out what happened to one of their group. I followed the various links and comments and was saddened by the story. http://feralgenius.blogspot.com/2011/05/lifes-joy-that-has-to-end-john-hannah.html\n\nNote that comments are turned off in the later post.\n\nJeff Borden, Erik Prince is not only from Michigan, He's from my home town and our fathers lived together at Dutch House while grad students at U of M. My half carat was $400 in 1978 at an odd custom jewelry place in Ann Arbor. Yup, soon to be 33 years. Pros, of course I've read Riddley Walker. I spent much of my day at the Metro Detroit Book and Author Society Luncheon. The speakers were Sebastian Junger, you know him best for The Perfect Storm, though he thinks of himself as a war reporter, Diane Ackerman, best known for the Zookeeper's Wife, Erik Larson, author of Devil in the White City and his new \"In the Garden of Beasts,\" Karl Marlantes, author of last year's bestselling VietNam novel \"Matterhorn\", John Gallagher, author of \"Reimagining Detroit.\" I spent $40 on two books and stood in long lines for autographs from Larson and Marlantes. Food was crappy banquet chicken, speeches were great.\n\nBasset, I recommend the unwraps and the pub chips. Actually I would recommend anything I've ever tried at Mad Anthony's.\n\nJoe, why bother to shop? You can't take it with you.\n\nI agree with Alex. Saturday nights? The Muppet Show.\n\nI had a brief conversation earlier this week with Erik Larson, author of \"Devil in the White City\" and newly released \"Beasts in the Garden.\" I told him I had heard him on Fresh Air the previous week. He told me that 1) His Fresh Air appearance had an immediate and amazing impact on sales, and 2) Terry Gross never ever has her guests in her own studio. Which, having heard the raunchy provocative interview with Gene Simmons a few years ago I was relieved to hear.\n\nAs Nancy noted here it is rain, rain, and more rain. So what is it with Oprah? Am I the only person in the world who has never watched her show and just doesn't care?\n\nGreat story on \"All Things Considered\" about Detroit techno and Movement.\n\nI got hard lenses at the age of 9 and my optometrist said I was the only kid with them he knew of. Switched to gas perms as an adult, added readers, and finally gave up about ten years ago as I just couldn't keep them clean. My claim to contact lense fame is being the kid for whom they had to turn on the lights in the coal mine at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. Found the lens once they did.\n\nHeather, my glasses scrip is -10. That means coke bottles, one of the reasons I wore contacts for like 40 years. Vanity, vanity.\n\nLocal news: Dr. Kevorkian died this a.m.\n\nMe neither.\n\nWell Jeff, you missed the reward that makes you forget all the pain.\n\nWell in my case it was the shot of synthetic morphine directly into my IV tube that made me say wheee! when I was in labor. Actually what I said was \"\"whee, give everyone some of this and we'll have a party!\" Had my lovely baby girl an hour or two later. And in reality you know I meant the baby. Now 23.\n\nGuys, I just have no interest in a picture of your boehner or your weiner. Cute buns, maybe but I got my own cute guy at home.\n\nPart of the ongoing bridge shenanigans. The Ambassador Bridge from Detroit to Windsor is privately owned. The governor and Canadian officials want to build another bridge. The owner doesn't want the governments to do it, and is spending his millions lobbying against it. He wants to build and own the second bridge. In addition to the eviction notices to which Jeff referred,he has somehow fenced off a Detroit city park that butts up against the base of his bridge and covered the fence with fake homeland security signs. An activist group broke the park open recently. http://michiganmessenger.com/49648/people-tear-down-fence-in-detroit%E2%80%99s-riverside-park EDIT: Here's a blog post with more info. http://joelontheroad.com/?p=6948\n\nTurns out Weiner's wife is pregnant.\n\nI was never a Kiss fan, but I did enjoy halloween in the MSU dorms the year all the guys dressed up in Kiss make up. Hundreds, thousands, or so it seemed. That dates me right there.\n\nTry again Dexter, Pontiac no longer has its own police force. They are one of the three cities and 1 school district being \"ruled\" by emergency financial managers. They have disbanded their police force and all city law enforcement is now handled by the sheriff's office. In the last few days the state gave them permission to cancel the dispatcher's union contract. There were no police left to dispatch after all.\n\nKaline, Stanley, Northrup, the Tidgers I grew up with. Sorry Dexter, I'm like 20 miles west southwest of Pontiac, been here less than a year. Good thing someone else knew how to answer your question.\n\nOn the subject of male waxing, did we not discuss Andrew Sullivan's video of his man parts wax experience? I once asked my salon why there was one private waxing room with a recliner type thing in it. It was for man waxing. I looked at all those lovely young women that worked in the salon and thought \"no way.\"\n\nNancy said: The only people qualified to judge a marriage are the people in it. I say every marriage has its own dynamic and who are we to think we understand it.\n\nHad the same uproar in Elkhart a few years ago regarding wearing marine uniforms to graduation. My town's exchange student scandal: I was in middle school when a Swedish high school exchange student was sent home pregnant. No boys were punished because she couldn't name names, she could only name the football team. Typical of the times back then.\n\nWell Brian, I guess you could say I'm a public official, and have been for most of my adult working life, though employed, not elected. Sometimes it's a struggle, and sometimes it's mostly pleasant like now. One of the worst parts is reading the nasty comments in newspaper forums, where I learned over and over again that I have wasted millions of your tax dollars. Not an issue here where the local news is weekly and the daily news is the Detroit Free Press who could care less about western Oakland County. And while I've never been an Apple person, tonight the township board decided the township would replace their 7 year old laptops with ipads, and that the seven top level managers - including me - would get ipads as well. So cool. And it's not even coming out of my budget.\n\nNancy's comment about the school pool reminds of a millage election when I was in high school. It was to include a pool. A letter to the editor opposing the pool stated \"I learned to swim in a ditch and so can they.\" After several failed millages the school expansion with pool opened in time for my 8 years younger brother to attend. And for Indiana folks, I mentioned working for a township earlier. Townships in Michigan are real governments similar to cities, unlike the almost useless townships in Indiana (assessments and poor relief.) Also in Michigan local municipalities handle their own assessing, tax bills, etc., whereas in Indiana all that is handled by the county.\n\nI would buy something like that if it were Eliot's Prufrock. Or more correctly \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.\" I took a college poetry class in which most of our time was spent on Prufrock. And now I notice and recognize the many references to and quotes from Prufrock in news, modern fiction, and other places, attributed or not. So next time you are listening to NPR and someone says \"the evening is spread against the sky like a patient etherized upon a table\" think Prufrock. My NPR count for that one line is up to five. Or \"in the room the women come and go talking of Michelangelo\", \"do I dare to eat a peach\", \"I grow old … I grow old … I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\" I will close with this, for the entire thing see: http://www.bartleby.com/198/1.html Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. I do not think that they will sing to me. I have seen them riding seaward on the waves Combing the white hair of the waves blown back When the wind blows the water white and black. We have lingered in the chambers of the sea By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown Till human voices wake us, and we drown.\n\nAs a former college book store employee responsible for the used book end of things here is the deal. The college bookstore will pay you 50% of retail if the book is going to be used for a class next semester. They will sell it to you for 75% of retail. If it is not going to be used for a class the bookstore will give you whatever they can sell it to a wholesale distributor for. It can be worth your while to wait to sell, if for example, a book is only used in fall semester.\n\nJohn C, love the Bedrock version of Prufrock.\n\nPrufrock got mentioned on Fresh Air today, in discussion of the Woody Allen movie. Headline right now on msnbc.com: Gingrich wife at center of campaign woes, sources say\n\nmoe99: yup, ick.\n\nLAMary, I looked at the picture at your link and my reaction was \"that's a big bunch of old white men.\"\n\nEnjoyed the hats. I'll take the green one with colored feathers. Note how many wearers are clutching their hats. And what's with the one that looks like Marie Antoinette's hair? That's just wierd. My husband walks the community trails daily and has an ever growing collection of found hats. This one is my favorite, though it doesn't really show the deer hunter orange color. Tell me where you would wear this hat, cause I haven't a clue. http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CG-UyfVDOzs/TfffgPOhFSI/AAAAAAAAAxA/hQW6A_qULlI/s1600/foundhat061311-739298.jpg\n\nI'm not sure I'd call it tasty linkage. My daughter's commentary on traveling in Europe and finding new ways to tell time without a cellphone in her pocket. http://iwannabeelmoresnet.blogspot.com/2011/06/my-woes-keeping-time.html#comments\n\nBlue Lake Fine Arts Camp? My brother went there for voice long ago, though he is a bassist in all ways: voice, upright and guitar.\n\nThe big news about that airplane crash here is that the injured surviving son is an incoming UM basketball recruit. http://www.detnews.com/article/20110627/METRO/106270350/U-M-recruit-Hatch-in-a-drug-induced-coma-after-surviving-2nd-plane-crash\n\nMade my first visit ever to a Whole Foods just the other day. Only because it was right there across the street from Trader Joe's. Never saw so much gluten free food in one place. Bought blueberries and salted caramels, and a bottle of shiracha. Probably won't go again. Can buy shiracha/shiraga at Trader Joes.\n\nWe're neighbors, I am still in the 11th. My rep is Thaddeus McKotter, who appears to be campaigning in Iowa this week. I find it interesting that the \"lost\" congressional district comes out of the Detroit metro area.\n\nI hit the Mall of America during what turned out to be NCAA Final Four weekend in Minneapolis (who knew?) and the autograph line for John Wooden went all the way around the mall. We had to track to the beginning just to find out why. And Butler Fans? The first Indiana high school championship basketball game to be played in Hinkle Fieldhouse in 1927 or 28 - captain of the losing team was John Wooden.\n\nBrian, we are having our second summer with no child at home at all, and it still seems weird. Even though we moved away and this is not really her home, and she's a grown up grad student. Kid news is good, she seems to be enjoying her summer, first in Germany, has moved on to Oxford for the rest of the summer, and ran into Hugh Grant in a pub the other night.\n\nFrom what I've heard it was a busy crowded Oxford pub and he was there in the crowd and she even brushed up against him. So I got an \"I touched Hugh Grant\" message, but she wasn't near as excited as the 2008 \"I shook Obama's hand\" message. My daughter just spent 3 weeks wandering Europe on her own after her six weeks at Speyer University, (Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Leipzig,) and I wasn't too worried. She is self possessed and in charge, a one time athlete and weightlifter, an experienced lifeguard, and could handle Hugh Grant if necessary. We do feel like we are stalking her on Facebook.\n\nHad my own couple of nasty hours on I75 yesterday, I had forgotten the once familiar going north on Friday or Saturday in Michigan traffic. Worst traffic was the last ten miles on 115 into Cadillac, bumper to bumper at 10 mph. Aah, the things we do to get up north. Greetings from Pleasant Lake in Cadillac.\n\nPharyngula trashes Mitch Albom. Comments dislike Mitch even more than NNc commenters do. http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/07/look_to_the_skies_america.php\n\nThanks for the picture link, I enjoyed seeing Prince Willem of the Netherlands, for whose Queenly mother I once got to do the receiving line thing. My daughter is named after his grand mother, and when I was a kid I thought she was our queen as my grandmother talked about the queen in the old country.\n\nI agree with Sue, while I had issues living in a southern Indiana small town, we loved living just under an hour from both Louisville and Indianapolis. Currently we are in the far west end of metro Detroit, 45 minutes from downtown, and it's like living in the country out here, with lakes and public land all around us. My husband's favorite trail is at Haven Hill State Rec Area which used to be Edsel Ford's summer home.\n\nI for one will be glad to have Casey Anthony off the news, and could care less what the verdict is. What made this one case worth multiple years of national news? Hear me Nancy Grace?\n\nThe Troy Public Library will make one more attempt to pass a tax millage to fund the library on August 2. A very active group is opposing them and is scheduling a book burning party for after the election. It's creepy. Here is their facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/BookBurningParty?sk=info\n\nThanks Sue, fixed. My face is red.\n\nBob(notgreene), the spirited discussion among the area Library Directors today includes your point of view, perhaps this is a bizarre campaign to support the millage vote.\n\nMy daughter has never been able to read my cursive, she is 23. And can barely write it as well. She learned what was then called keyboarding in 4th grade though so we thought it was a fair exchange. They teach math differently these days as well, we were surprised when she needed a scientific calculator for high school math. The world changes. I try not to be an old fuddy duddy about this stuff, but it's hard. Speaking of old fuddy duddy's you should hear my dad whenever he sees her pierced lip. Actually just below the lower lip. I finally had to tell him to quit making his grownup granddaughter cry at family get togethers.\n\nKids that age don't tell time the way us old folks do either. We say quarter after five. They say five seventeen.\n\nBrian, you are now an Indiana band dad! Having been an Indiana band mom (Yup that's what we call it) I hope you find as interesting, strange, and fun as we did. I can point out the nearest BBQ ribs place to most of the major competition venues when you get going this fall, that was a tradition for our gang of band parents in places like Carmel, Chesterton, etc. I would say hope you make it to the Dome like we did (4 times, Class B, 2nd, 1st, 2nd, 1st) but the dome is gone. Will Indiana marching ever be the same. And do link up with IndianaMarching.com to keep track of results, standings etc. Have fun!\n\nThe Amway thing is ubiquituous if you live in west Michigan. My best friend in Holland lives near the Amways folks various Lake Macatawa summer homes. Many years ago they tore down a lovely house to build a mansion. They have now torn down the mansion, bought additional property and are building an even greater mansion complete with a guest house larger than most of the other houses on the lake. The Amway Grand is built on and around a classic old hotel called the Pantlind. Did you see the restaurant called \"The Bank\" \"The Bank\" was once a night club space at which my senior prom took place. My aunt was director of the Grand Rapids Convention and Visitors Bureau when the Amway Grand was built, and I remember her saying it would change what her office could accomplish for the city. You should have stayed at the new Gold LEED certified all green hotel in downtown Holland.\n\nProspero, the west side of lower Michigan is filled with van names like Vandersloot. Not an uncommon name there it all, so why is it untrustworthy. Oh, and there are VanderSliks as well. And those who do Amway don't call it that, they are part of an upline group that has its own name, the one I am most familiar with is Quixtar. Amway is only the product. The multi-level marketing is independent. A good friend of mine did it for quite some time, and it always seemed to me to be about buying motivational tapes and attending motivational seminars rather than about selling product. And the \"Pitch\" is always about getting rich like so and so - who is the way upline founder of this group, the one who sells the tapes, puts on the seminars, and gets a percentage of every product sold by the all downline people.\n\nI still have an ancient copy of Pet Bracken's book and I still use her simple but unusual pork chop recipe.\n\nA week or two ago every news source I watch/read be it national, local or our local weekly did a story on the dangers of children drowning in pools. I wondered at that time what set something like that off. I am back from a lovely but hot week at Glen Lake/Sleeping Bear. Sue and Holly you must check out the new board walks at the beach at Glen Haven. They appear to have turned a formerly quiet beach into a bustling popular place. We even saw three tour busses turn in as we were leaving.\n\nYes Sue, by the cannery complete with new parking, a walkway up to and around the old boat, and a wonderful foot wash faucet. The beach was much busier than previously.\n\nI moved to Michigan last fall, my Michigan driver's license came in the mail last week. It took me five trips to the Secretary of State's office to get it. Birth certificate, social security card, multiple proofs of address. It should have only taken 4, but they entered my address and the license they sent me was returned and shredded, or so they assume, because they don't keep track of those. It also took my husband five tries, failed with a birth certificate photocopy, then couldn't come up with enough address proofs. They finally accepted my address proofs plus an original with seal copy of our 33 year old marriage certificate. They didn't take away my Indiana license but they did punch a hole in it.\n\nHere's more info on the Oz movie prequel currently being filmed in metro Detroit: http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011107220329 . Stars include James Franco, Mila Kunis and Michelle Williams.\n\nOne of the boingboing guys is at Maker Faire Detroit and has posted several bits about it. http://boingboing.net/ The whole make movement impresses me, all those hipsters learning to solder, weld, etc.\n\nFollowing up on an earlier question about the OZ movie currently being filmed in metro Detroit. http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011107220329 . Stars are ames Franco, Mila Kunis and Michelle Williams. When Demi Moore and Miley Cyrus were filming in the area last year, Demi lived in my neighborhood. I will start watching for stars at the grocery store.\n\nMy brother posted this on facebook and I just had to share: Comparing Gabby Giffords to the Tea Party I'd never guess which one has a hole in their head. Over the last couple of days I have twice posted a link to Free Press story about the local filming of the OZ movie and never saw the comment show up. Stars are James Franco, Mila Kunis, James Franco as Oz, Rachel Weisz, and Michelle Williams as Glinda. When Miley Cyrus and Demi Moore filmed in the area last year, word is Demi lived in my neighborhood. So I will watch for them all at the grocery store.\n\nBrian this blonde is sorry to hear you prefer brunettes. :-)\n\nTHanks for the compliment Brian, our lunch was a pleasure, as was my lunch with Alex the following day.\n\nAfter 9/11 there was a lot of federal money available for local law enforcement that was spent on things like that tank. Elkhart County got itself a serious SWAT command post trailer kind of thing.\n\nMy stepmother's previous married name was DuBois and she and her sons all pronounce it DuBoyz. Baldheadeddork, I was surprised by the B'ton Herald Times link, as their web page has always been closed to non-subscribers. Have they changed their mind or does your link somehow invisibly include your subscriber cookie? My husband will be in Bloomington this weekend to move our daughter from her apartment to a house. She won't be back from IU at Oxford until the following week. Cabela's canceled an about to start construction project outside Indianapolis (Greenwood) when the economy went south. We went to one in Minnesota and enjoyed the taxidermy scenes. I enjoyed getting to look up close at all the pistols I had read about in mystery novels. But once was enough. And Brian we have just decided we have to get to the Henry Ford Museum before the Civil War Exhibit ends on Labor Day.\n\nIndiana also has a Versailles (ver-sales). And a tiny town called Houston (House ton). And moe99, as one who can pronounce Lou uh vuhl like a homey, I think you mean insider. Outsiders say Lou ee vill.\n\nMy first thought was mestizo which turns out to mean A person of mixed racial ancestry, especially of mixed European and Native American ancestry.\n\nMuskellunge is also a lake in the UP. Muskellunge Lake State Park sits between Muskellunge Lake and Lake Superior. I had a fine camping trip there many years ago. Back when I was willing to sleep on the ground.\n\nMy husband has had a short trimmed beard for most of our married life, our daughter has never seen his chin. My husband scanned some old slides recently recently and posted on facebook a 1972 picture of my dad in profile with the beard he grew for the Zeeland 125 years beard contest. My dad insisted it was not him. We all said look at the house behind you, you still have the dining chairs we can see through the window. My daughter said \"Grandpa used to have red hair?\" I would have said strawberry blonde, but yup the beard was red.\n\nFound one of those great spell check errors in Anne River Siddons new book \"Burnt Mountain\" : character refers to someone having lots of something, \"up the kazoo\". As for the book, her usual southern sweetness. Pros, I just finished Padgett's new book \"State of Wonder\" and it was wonderful.\n\nKwame's book is being published by a very small vanity publisher in the south, and metro area libraries have discovered it is almost impossible to buy. Originally the publisher took only online orders using paypal. The many phone calls from metro area libraries finally convinced her to accept checks in the mail for orders. Not that we really want to buy it, but hey we buy Ann Coulter and Glenn Beck and it's local interest. Publisher web page states we'll provide the ghostwriter and split the profits with you 50/50. http://www.creativepublishingconsultants.com/ Though it sounds like Kwame's profits are going for restitution.\n\nMy kid notes on facebook that there is some rioting in Oxford and that her crew is not in the area and are committed to staying home tonight for safety. Just what a mother wants to hear. Let's just fast forward to metro airport Sunday night.\n\nI was always told that default onstage phrase was \"watermelon, watermelon.\" Sounds like walla wall though.\n\nSalon had an excellent review for \"The Help.\" I am the only person in the world who couldn't finish the book. I couldn't finish \"Room\" either. Bad librarian. Speaking of librarians I had just shared \"Useful things to remember about librarians\" on facebook. Great minds? Weather has broken at last. Lovely out, sun is shining and IT IS NOT HUMID!!\n\nBeen there too Alex, tough and hope you have support. I've been a librarian a smidgen longer than Linda has, and the change from then to now is mindblowing. In that time I have spent a couple of million dollars on computers, tech, software, etc. Having been ten years in a tough blue collar town and now in somewhat upscale rural suburbia it is still all about tech. Linda's comment about old folks getting email to be in touch with grandkids is so true. Indiana's requirement to file online once a week in order to receive unemployment benefits overwhelmed public libraries across that state. My inner city branch was overwhelmed every Sunday with filers wanting to file on the first day of the filing week. Having a hundred or so unemployed (mostly) men waiting for computers did not lend itself to family time at the library. I'm glad to be back home in Michigan. And even given the above it is still about books, though they are just as likely to be ebooks as hardcovers. Summer is a joy at the library because kids are excited about Summer Reading Club and excited about their books. As a librarian I get advance reading copies and I am currently reading \"When She Woke\" by Hillary Jordan, a near future religious America vision that is sort of a cross between \"Scarlet Letter\" and \"Handmaid's Tale\" Coming out in October and highly recommended. Because you needed another book on your list and after all, I'm a librarian.\n\nCheck out fiverr, http://fiverr.com/, The place for people to share things they're willing to do for $5. My current fave: I will make a tarzan style ringtone yodelling your name for $5.\n\nTwice I've had the vet say to me, \"you'll know when it's time.\" And I always did, but that doesn't make it any easier. We have been taking care of our daughter's dog since she left for Europe on May 1 and he has wormed his way into our hearts. She comes back Sunday and has made it very clear to me I can't keep him. We'll be sad to see him go, though my husband will be relieved to go back to walking just one. And he'll come back to visit on the holidays.\n\nI've had a Kobo for a while (Border's cheap nook) and mostly used it for library downloads and other free downloads. I had just bought a really cheap Cruze android based ereader tablet when my employer unexpectedly decided to buy all high level managers (me!) an ipad 2. So I've had the ipad like two weeks and am still figuring it out, but no problems downloading library ebooks on it. I bought the Cruze because I wanted a reader with a lit screen for night time. It's still in the box it was shipped in untouched, anyone want a cheap deal? I thought about buying the ebook version of Game of Thrones. Kobo lists it at 29.99 and Barnes and"
