James “Wade” Baker, 71, went to be with his Lord and Savior on Friday, October 6, 2023, after a battle with Liver Disease. He, with help from his wife Laura, fought this terrible illness valiantly.

Wade was born in Pittsburgh, PA on August 19, 1952, and was raised in Princeton, KY. He was a long time resident of Owensboro. Wade attended Georgetown College and is a graduate of the Louisiana State University Graduate School of Banking. His first career was in banking, in a variety of positions prior to his retirement. His second career was as a realtor, serving the Owensboro area. Both career choices suited him well, as anyone who knew Wade knew he loved people and socializing and being active in his community. One of Wade’s passions was scuba diving, and he visited many Caribbean islands to explore the reefs. Wade also was a staunch UK fan, never missing a game, whether in person or televised. Wade was a wealth of knowledge about his community and current events. If you hadn’t seen the news, or the sports stats, he could catch you up. He loved spending time with his friends and family.

Wade met the love of his life, Laura (Dodge), in 2002, marrying her in 2004.They loved travelling. The beach was their favorite destination. They loved walking on the beach, bicycling, and enjoying the sunset from the balcony. Wade was so proud of his 2 daughters, Mary Beth and Olivia, always enjoying and participating in their school and life events.

Wade was preceded in death by his father, Gary Baker. He is survived by his wife Laura, his 2 daughters, Mary Beth Baker and Olivia Marcum, as well as his mother, Nancy and brothers Bryant (Libby), Joe (Lisa) and sister Gary Beth (Nicky) Baker, as well as many nieces and nephews.

His was a life well lived.

A celebration of his life will take place at 2 PM Sunday, October 15 at Glenn Funeral Home and Crematory . Visitation will be from 1 PM until the time of the service.
