        "text": "Former teen pop stars Aly & AJ have grown up and rebranded themselves: now in their early 20s, the sister duo has changed their name to 78Violet. “Hothouse,” their first single under their new moniker, will be released on July 8, with an album to follow.\n\nThe duo will also perform live for the first time in five years when they take the stage for special shows at the Roxy Theater in Los Angeles on June 26 and the Gramercy Theater in New York on July 9.\n\n“We couldn’t be more ready or excited to introduce our amazing fans to the new and evolved sound behind 78Violet,” says Aly and AJ Michalka in a press statement. “These two upcoming shows will allow us to share a small taste of the alternative pop vibe that you’ll hear on the album in an organic and up close and personal setting.”\n\nThe sisters came onto the scene in 2007 with their debut album “Into the Rush,” which has sold 839,000 copies to date, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The girls are best known for singles “Rush” and “Chemicals React,” which both cracked the BHot 100. “Insomniatic,” their last album under the name Aly & AJ, was released in 2007 and peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nSince leaving Hollywood Records in 2009, the duo has been active in film and television. Aly starred in the cancelled CW drama “Hellcats” and will appear in the upcoming film “Grown Ups 2,” while AJ had small parts in “Super 8” and “The Lovely Bones.”\n\nThe newly refreshed duo have been working on material for an upcoming album, which is “soon to be released,” according to a press blast. “Hothouse” was produced by David Kahne, and its music video will also be released on July 8."
