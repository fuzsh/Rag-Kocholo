        "text": "ONTD Original: 2005, A year of one hit wonders\n\n2001: One Hit Wonders\n\n2003: One Hit Wonders\n\n2004: One Hit Wonders\n\nJust 11 years ago, artists like Howie Day, D.H.T, and The Click Five were topping the charts. Many of the artists who created their major 2005 hits were never able to replicate the success. However, it's always fun to revist the past and bring back the nostalgia. Let's take a look at some of the best one hit wonders of 2005!\n\nHowie Day - Collide\n\nThis song was recorded in 2003, released in 2004 but did not peak until the summer of 2005 at no. 20. \"Even the best fall down sometimes\" was everyone's AIM Away Message in 2005. Howie Day ended up falling and staying down. During his success, this guy was arrested for locking a fan in his tour bus bathroom and suddenly he wasn't shit.\n\nGorillaz - Feel Good Inc.\n\nThis song and video has a creepy vibe to it but it was considered \"different\" at the time. The virtual group, that many will disagree with as labeleing a one hit wonder, has had several charting singles across the globe. However, ‘Feel Good Inc.’ has been their one true hit. This song peaked at no. 14 in the summer of 2005.\n\nBrooke Valentine - Girlfight\n\nBrooke Valentine did that! This was the soundtrack to my 8th grade when I was beating hater's asses. Backed by a then-relevant Lil Jon & Big Boi, the song peaked at no. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"We bout to throw them bows, we bout to swang them thangs,\" remains an iconic lyric and words to live by.\n\nNatalie - Goin' Crazy\n\nNatalie was 2005's INOJ, serving us this gentle bop. This song peaked at no. 13 in the summer of 2005. The good sis was never to be heard of again. Probably thanks to Cassie!\n\nTeairra Mari - Make Her Feel Good\n\nTeairra was another one of Jay-Z's puppets and delivered a strong debut single. Teairra was criticized for being high-sexualized at such a young age. The good sis had a parental advisory on her album at just 17. Soon after, she was dropped from Jay's label and hasn't seen a hit since. Luckily, she still has this top 40 hit to looks back on.\n\nPapa Roach - Scars\n\nTo some, they may not be a one hit wonder but they only had one hit. 2000's \"Last Resort\" may be considered a One Hit Wonder by many, but none of this band's singles have topped Scars. The song peaked at no. 15 in the summer of 2005.\n\nD.H.T - Listen To Your Heart\n\nThis group was here one day & gone the next. I feel like I couldn't escape this song for a while & the remix is what helped the song's popularity. The Group peaked at no. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 2005.\n\nTrillville - Some Cut\n\nAny one who turns ppl having sex on a bed into a beat is a winner in my book! This song still goes imo. Trillville peaked at no. 14 in the Spring of 2005. 13 yr old me probably shouldn't have been pussy poppin' to this but....\n\nThe Click Five - Just The Girl\n\nI guess this was 2005's one direction? They were rocking the hair of every white male student this year and this song still annoys me like it did back in the day. But ofc, it was a hit. The song peaked at no. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and then the band faded into obscurity.\n\nTrina - Here We Go\n\n\"Here We Go\" is Trina's most successful single to date, and one of the highest charting songs for Rowland as a solo artist on the US Billboard Hot 100 until her 2011 hit, \"Motivation\". This song peaked at no. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December of 2005 and remained the bop of that winter.\n\nWhat were you doing & bopping to in 2005, ONTD?\n\nSource | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHey Arnold Jungle Movie 100% Confirmed, ALL Original Voice Actors Returning\n\nCliffnotes:\n\n-The title is officially Hey Arnold: The Jungle Movie\n\n-All of the original children VAs will be returning, though will be playing different roles (duh)\n\n-Arnold and Gerald will now be voiced by Mason Vale Cotton (Mad Men) and Benjamin Flores Jr. (Game Shakers), respectively\n\n-The villain will be voiced by Alfred Molina\n\nSource\n\nRead up on the tumultuous history of the movie here, it's pretty fascinating\n\n↧\n\nLife With Derek's Michael Seater and Ashley Leggat reveal they ship Dasey\n\nMichael Seater and Ashley Leggat recently reunited for a movie he directed and were interviewed by MTV. They admitted they ship Derek/Casey and see \"nothing wrong\" with the ship. Both have read a lot of (X-rated) fic over the years. There were supposed to be a spin-off series that wasn't picked up but Michael says it started with Dasey in bed together and won't give any context for it. Ashley wants the fans to \"keep on shipping it\" and \"never give up\".\n\nSource\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: 2006, A year of one hit wonders\n\nPrevious Posts: 2001 / 2003 / 2004 / 2005\n\nJust 10 years ago, artists like Daniel Powter, Cassie, and Paris Hilton were topping the charts. Many of the artists who created their major 2006 hits were never able to replicate the success. However, their songs remain boppable and always bring back the nostalgia. Let's take a look at some of the best one hit wonders of 2006!\n\nDaniel Powter - Bad Day\n\n'Bad Day' was used as the send-off song on the fifth season of \"American Idol,\" making it the biggest single of 2006. Daniel Powter's hit peaked at no. 1 in the spring of 2006. Powter hasn’t had any other top 100 songs on the U.S. Billboard since Bad Day, but has had 3 top 25 songs in Canada.\n\nSnow Patrol - Chasing Cars\n\nProbably one of the most controversial entries, many will protest that Snow Patrol has other hits, and that this does not deserve a one-hit wonder classification. However, in the U.S., \"Chasing Cars\" was their only chart topper. But follow-up or not, what Snow Patrol did was something fresh, haunting, and inescapable. This unforgettable song peaked at no. 5 in the fall of 2006.\n\nJibbs - Chain Hang Low\n\nJibbs made it when labels were looking for the next Nelly, the next J-Kwon, etc. His career was short lived, though, reduced to this 2006 ringtone song. The tune lifted its main melody from \"Turkey in the Straw,\" a popular minstrel-show tune that dates all the way back to the 1800s. Most people recognized it as the song the ice cream man plays when he drives around. Which may have helped score points with the kids, while turning off most adults. This song peaked at no. 7 in the fall of 2006.\n\nCassie - Me & U\n\nCassie showed a ton of promise with her icy R&B sound on breakout hit \"Me & U,\" but despite many follow-up attempts, it hasn't parlayed into another hit or even another album. She's still signed to Bad Boy Records, owned by Diddy, and she's still remained an ever-present socialite with a big underground following. \"Me & U\" peaked at no. 3 in the summer of 2006.\n\nFor Minor - Where'd You Go\n\nThe hip hop-leaning side project of Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda, Fort Minor had a huge hit with their somber \"Where'd You Go\" single that introduced the world to Skylar Grey (at the time going by Holly Brook). The song peaked at no. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 2006. The collective only lasted two years after their album, The Rising Tied, failed to make waves.\n\nGnarls Barkley - Crazy\n\nCee-Lo Green struck gold teaming up with Danger Mouse on 2006's \"St. Elsewhere\" with its delectable hit \"Crazy.\" The song peaked at no. 2 in the summer of 2006. With a driving bass borrowed from a Spaghetti Western, \"Crazy\" celebrates the theory that despair and lunacy can be things to be enjoyed. Whatever the reason, music lovers have celebrated this funky groove at all levels of sanity.\n\nJames Blunt - You're Beautiful\n\nJames Blunt's \"You're Beautiful\" led to a huge year for the British singer-songwriter and his Back to Bedlam album. He peaked at no. 1 in 2006 with this hit. While he never found another hit in America, Blunt is still making music today and his singles chart quite well in U.K., with three more Top 10 hits under his belt post-\"You're Beautiful.\"\n\nNick Lachey - What's Left of Me\n\nIn May 2006, sympathetic fans helped Nick Lachey go to No. 6 with his post-98 Degrees solo single, \"What's Left of Me,\" a song about his dissolved relationship with Jessica Simpson. But when the drama cooled, fans stopped caring; later that year his next song, \"I Can't Hate You Anymore\" -- his second-biggest -- only climbed to No. 87.\n\nD4L - Laffy Taffy\n\nIn news that shocked very few, this rap quartet couldn't follow-up their ridiculous \"Laffy Taffy\" banger with anything nearly as inescapable. The group released their gold-certified Down for Life album in late 2005 and \"Laffy Taffy\" topped the charts in 2006, but the group called it quits in just three years.\n\nParis Hilton - Stars Are Blind\n\nYes, this heiress does, in fact, have a hit to her name.

I don't even know. He asked for a hug at the end and Jade kissed his bald head.\n\nsources: 1, 2, 3\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: 2007, A year of one hit wonders\n\nPrevious Posts: 2001 / 2002-2003 / 2004 / 2005 / 2006\n\nJust 9 years ago, artists like Shop Boyz, Hellogoodbye, and Paula Deanda were topping the charts. Many of the artists who created their major 2007 hits were never able to replicate the success. However, it's always fun to revist the past and remember what we were doing when we were listening to these songs back in the day. Let's take a look at some of the best one hit wonders of 2007!\n\nShop Boyz - Party Like A Rockstar\n\nThe Shop Boyz cashed in on a particular moment in rap when there was a renewed interest in what other genres were doing-namely rock n' roll. A mix of crunk with a wailing lead guitar line drove this song to No. 2 on the Hot 100. But it was mostly written off as a novelty tune, and the Atlanta-based group quickly faded into obscurity.\n\nRich Boy - Throw Some D's\n\nRich Boy released several albums after his self-titled debut, but none received the attention his solo created. But his hit made it to no. 6 on the Hot 100 and became one of the biggest rap songs of the year.\n\nHuey - Pop, Lock & Drop It\n\nLike J-Kwon before him, Huey seemed to have sprung from the Kansas City rap scene overnight. \"Pop, Lock & Drop It\" was ringtone rap personified, and became a staple on 106 & Park. There was a follow-up single and even two albums from Huey, but nobody remembers him for anything except this one song which peaked at no. 6 on the Hot 100.\n\nHurricane Chris - Ay Bay Bay\n\nLouisiana's Hurricane Chris climbed to No. 7 on the Hot 100 with \"A Bay Bay\" in July 2007. He cat-called \"Halle Berry\" on his next-biggest single with far less success; the song only went to No. 52 in 2009.\n\nFeist - 1234\n\nFeist is a pretty talented artist. But, she can thank apple for the ipod commercial that made her an instant one-hit wonder in 2007. The iPod promo helped her hit peak at no. 8 on the Hot 100. 1234 is fun, catchy and custom-fit for one-hit wonder status.\n\nHellogoodbye - Here (In Your Arms)\n\nDefinitely one of the biggest one-hit wonders of the year, “power-pop” group, Hellogoodbye, had listeners jumping up and down and longing for someone to be in their arms to lock lips and brush cheeks with. Since peaking at no. 14 on the Hot 100, hellogoodbye has been out of the spotlight. They did just that with this one hit wonder, a hello and goodbye.\n\nAly & AJ - Potential Breakup Song\n\nIt’s hard to transition smoothly from acting to singing for a lot of people, but sister act Aly & AJ proved they had the chops to do it with their catchy “Potential Breakup Song.” The song peaked at no. 17 on the Hot 100 but the Michalka ladies haven’t put out anything that received a lot of airplay since then. The duo have since renamed their band to 78Violet and have taken on a more folk-tingled sound.\n\nPaula Deanda - Walk Away (Remember Me)\n\nI'm already waiting on all the comments that will yell at me and claim Paula is not a one hit wonder. But, you know the deal already. This song was the highest she's ever charted even though it seems like she was all over the place in 2007. This song peaked at no. 18 on the Hot 100 in '07 and soon after it seemed like Paula fell off the face of the earth. She resurfaced in 2014 when she auditioned for The Voice and competed for a little while on Blake's team. #Justice4Paula\n\nKat Deluna - Whine Up\n\nWhere were you in summer 2007? Probably listening to this song as you whined them hips. But then fall happened and everyone forgot about the song and who sang it. Luckily, this cabbage-patch-faced popstar has a no. 29 hot 100 hit under her belt. Kat Deluna continues to do music but has yet to make the same splash as her one and only hit.\n\nThe Red Jumpsuit Apparatus - Face Down\n\nThe Red Jumpsuit Apparatus made waves with their progressive debut single \"Face Down\" that tackled domestic abuse and promoted female empowerment. The song peaked at no. 25 and the band was beloved in the pop-punk scene, but couldn't find much traction with follow-up releases despite staying together for more than a decade.\n\nAugustana - Boston\n\nLike Gavin DeGraw, Augustana owes One Tree Hill a huge thanks for kickstarting their career. After Lucas and B. Davis danced to \"Boston\" in the show's third season finale, the song peaked at no. 34 on the Hot 100. Maybe Augustana moved to Boston just never returned..\n\nIgrid Michaelson - The Way I Am\n\nThanks to this song, Ingrid helped secure the song a sweet gig as the soundtrack to an Old Navy commercial. Because of this, Ingrid scored her first and only top 40 Billboard hit, peaked at no. 37 in 2007. Although Ingrid never matched the success of this song again, she still remains active in music and fans will not agree with this one-hit-wonder title. But as long as there are primetime TV dramas and retai, she’ll not go hungry.\n\nWhat were you bopping to/doing in 2007, ONTD?\n\nSource | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original™: The 30 Year old ONTD'ers life, a movie retrospective. Part 1!\n\nI’m BACK! Movies were an important aspect of my life growing up, so I decided to make a definitive list of iconic movies/actors that helped define specific time periods of my childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. This is the first of a 3 part series of posts. Each time period will contain 10 highlights, in no particular order, that I felt best fit my experience. So sit back, relax, and relive your youth.\n\nThis post goes out to the middle 80's babies (84-86).\n\nElementary/Middle/Junior High School\n\nKids sports films\n\nI was heavily involved in sports activities my entire childhood, so naturally I was drawn to those types of movies. There was absolutely no shortage of sports films for kids during this time. Many of these movies gave us incredibly quotable lines like “Rocky loves Emily” and “FOOORRRREEEVVVVVVEEEEEERRRRRR”. Little Giants and Lady Bugs were a perfect mix of cute boys, girl power, and heartwarming life lessons-90s style. I really loved how the girls were central to the storyline and showed that we could be just as athletic is boys.\n\nLittle Giants (1994)\n\nCast: Ed O’Neill, Rick Moranis, Shawna Waldron, Devon Sawa\n\nLady Bugs (1992)\n\nCast: Rodney Dangerfield, Jackée Harry, Jonathan Brandis, Vinessa Shaw\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: The Sandlot, The Mighty Ducks, 3 Ninjas\n\nFashion Forward\n\nKnee socks, knit skirts, baby tees…Oh my! Movies certainly set and echoed the fashion trends in the 90s. You weren’t cool unless you looked like a Clueless clone. From “Whatever” to “Loser”, it was such a cultural/fashion phenomenon. But the fashion wasn't always sugar and spice. Grunge looks were very popular for the alternative music crowd. I also appreciated the looks from The Craft which were darker and more appropriate for the tone of the film. They gave off a “goth-lite” feminine vibe.\n\nClueless (1995)\n\nCast: Alicia Silverstone, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash\n\nThe Craft (1996)\n\nCast: Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Rachel True, Neve Campbell\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Empire Records\n\nRated R\n\nEvery kid had that ONE movie that they were dying to see, but weren’t old enough to get into. Mine was Scream. Word of mouth from older kids made it seem like the best movie to ever grace the silver screen. It had gore, sex, scares, and amazing tunes. Everyone kept gabbing about the twist beginning & ending, which made 12 year old me finally decide to stop being a goody two-shoes and sneak in to see it. Another rated R flick that had me dying to see it in theaters was I Know What You Did Last Summer. While it was a little more tame than Scream on the blood and gore aspect, it made up for with its blatant casting of teen heartthrob types, popular TV starlets, and amazing soundtrack.\n\nScream (1996)\n\nCast: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Skeet Ulrich, Drew Barrymore\n\nI Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)\n\nCast: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Fear, Kids, Disturbing Behavior\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nThere really isn’t much to say about this one. Leo sparked my awakening as a tween. He had boyish good looks AND he could act. He was everywhere from magazine covers to box office hits. Titanic made him an international superstar. If you didn’t see that movie 3+ times in the movie theater…I don’t know what you were doing with your life. Peak Leo for me will always be in Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet. The fish tank and balcony scene were on repeat when I snagged my hands on this VHS. I bought the movie version of the play and MEMORIZED all of Juliet’s lines. I also bought both the soundtracks and played them non-stop.\n\nRomeo & Juliet (1996)\n\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo, Harold Perrineau\n\nTitanic (1997)\n\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Basketball Diaries, What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?\n\nAnimal Instincts\n\nIt wasn’t a 90s family movie if it didn’t include some kind of animal. Dog, cat, ape, you name it…they were all a part of the family! Beethoven was actually one of my fav movies growing up, 1) b/c I didn’t have any pets and 2) I loved watching that crazy St. Bernard wreak havoc on that poor family’s house. My favorite part of this 90s gem is the fact that the eldest daughter’s name was Ryce…RYCE. Toss in an evil plot to steal the dog and you have yourself a perfect animal shenanigans movie. Another animal centric family movie is Jumanji. I absolutely loved Robin Williams (RIP) as Alan Parrish, the man who disappeared while playing the mysterious board game as a child. It was such a fun fantasy film to watch especially the scenes with the monkeys.\n\nBeethoven (1992)\n\nCast: Charles Grodin, Bonnie Hunt, Nichole Tom, Stanley Tucci\n\nJumanji (1995)\n\nCast: Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bonnie Hunt, Jonathan Hyde\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Homeward Bound, Air Bud (and its 30 unnecessary sequels)\n\nBased on books\n\nWhile I typically don’t have too much time to read now, I really enjoyed myself a good children’s book back in the day. It was always fun seeing the characters come to life on the big screen. Harriet the Spy made me want to be a detective when I grew up. The movie adaptation was funky and a treat to watch. I also appreciated the movie version of The Indian in the Cupboard. I wondered how they were going to pull off making the toy come to life, and little me was not disappointed with the results.\n\nHarriet the Spy (1996)\n\nCast: Michelle Trachtenberg, Gregory Smith, Vanessa Lee Chester, Rosie O’Donnell\n\nThe Indian in the Cupboard (1995)\n\nCast: Hal Scardino, Litefoot, Lindsay Crouse, Richard Jenkins\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: A Little Princess, The Babysitter’s Club, Tom and Huck\n\nAction/Adventure for the Family\n\nJurassic Park and Independence Day were HUGE, HUGE movies at the time. I remember seeing the trailer for Independence Day at the movies and people sitting with their mouths open and cheering. These movies were unlike anything that had been released at the time. The special effects were top notch (although it seems very dated now) and to me these were the first 2 big budget 90s hits that everyone was clamoring to see opening weekend. Fun Fact: Jurassic Park was the 1st movie to use DTS sound format.\n\nIndependence Day (1996)\n\nCast: Will Smith, Vivica A Fox, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman\n\nJurassic Park (1993)\n\nCast: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Men in Black, Terminator II: Judgement Day\n\nLifetime Movies\n\nEveryone loves a cheesy lifetime movie. They were really cranking them out in the 90s and there are definitely some classics. Their cautionary tales had me hooked when I was a youngster. It was always a pleasure to see popular TV actors at the time star in these made for TV movies about heavy subject matter. They basically employed the casts of Saved by the Bell and Beverly Hills 90210 in their off-time. Lifetime movies tackled rape, child abuse, adultery, kidnapping…you name it. Even though I was very young, it was nice to see that the world was not always cartoons and roses.\n\nShe fought Alone (1996)\n\nCast: Tiffani Amber Theissen, Brian Austin Green, David Lipper, Maureen Flannigan\n\nIndecent Seduction/For My Daughter’s Honor (1996)\n\nCast: Nichole Tom, Gary Cole, Alyson Hannigan, Sara Rue\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: She Cried No (Freshman Fall), No One Would Tell\n\nAnimated Films\n\nWhile I didn’t watch too many Disney/animated films when I was little, I do have fond memories of the few that I actually remember. I even had an Aladdin sleeping bag. Every 90s kid is familiar with Buzz, Woody, and the Toy Story gang. The animation in that film was groundbreaking and the story will never get old. Little Mermaid had me combing my hair with a fork and singing “Part of your World” out the car window to whoever would listen. Now I watch these movies and cry like a baby because the nostalgia is overwhelming.\n\nToy Story (1995)\n\nCast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney\n\nThe Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nCast: Jodi Benson, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Samuel E. Wright, Pat Carroll\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Beauty and the Beast, 101 Dalmations\n\nOlder sibling suggestions\n\nBeing the youngest in my family, I was always watching movies/TV Shows with my brother and sisters. My siblings were 4+ years older than me and into more mature films about HS and College. While most, if not all of the content went over my head as child, I grew to appreciate them the older I got. I still stop and watch these movies EVERYTIME they are on basic cable. Kid N’ Play’s Class Act still remains one of my fav movies with its anti-drug & anti-bully rhetoric. Wedge is one of the best HS bully portrayals in a teen movie IMO. Speaking of HS bullies, Matt “SSSHHH” Wilson from Encino Man is still used in memes to this day. This movie helped catapult the career of Brendan Fraser and helped Sean Astin transition from child star to successful adult actor.\n\nClass Act (1992)\n\nCast: Christopher Reid, Christopher Martin, Karyn Parsons, Doug E. Doug\n\nEncino Man (1992)\n\nCast: Brendan Fraser, Sean Astin, Pauly Shore, Megan Ward\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Friday, School Ties, Higher Learning\n\nVIDEO SOURCE 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.\n\nSOURCE 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.\n\nWhat are some of your movie memories, ONTD?

Part 2!\n\nI’m BACK! Movies were an important aspect of my life growing up, so I decided to make a definitive list of iconic movies/actors that helped define specific time periods of my childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. This is the second of a 3 part series of posts. Each time period will contain 10 highlights, in no particular order, that I felt best fit my experience. So sit back, relax, and relive your youth.\n\nThis post goes out to the middle 80's babies (84-86).\n\nHigh School/College\n\nShakespearean Influence\n\nAfter the success of Romeo + Juliet in 1996, screenwriters realized that teenagers could digest the works of Shakespeare a little bit easier if it was tailored to their modern life. None did it better than 1999's 10 Things I Hate About You. An adaptation of \"Taming of the the Shrew\", the film centers around Bianca and her buzzkill sister Kat. The film was so well done that many teens didn't realize that it was Shakespeare inspired. A more literal adaptation of The Bard's great work \"Othello\" was 2001's O. This movie fucked me up. It was super dark for a teen-centric movie. Mekhi Phifer was brilliant as the main character Odin James...while Josh Hartnett played the twisted Hugo.\n\n10 Things I Hate About You(1999)\n\nCast: Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordan Levitt, Larissa Oleynik\n\nO (2001)\n\nCast: Mekhi Phifer, Julia Stiles, Josh Hartnett, Cult Leader Andrew Keegan\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Get Over It (A Midsummer Night's Dream), She's the Man(Twelfth Night)\n\nThe Frat Pack\n\nThe 50s gave us the Rat Pack, the 80s the Brat Pack, and in the early 00s Will Ferrell and his camp were dubbed the Frat Pack. Almost every comedy that came out between 99-06 had atleast 1 or 2 members of the FP. Most of their movies centered around ridiculous outlandish plots and involved juvenile humor. It was strange seeing men in their 30s and 40s acting like teenagers, but yet it was equally hillarious. While there were scripts for these movies, a good portion of the dialogue was improvised. Pop culture was blessed with lines such as \"I love lamp\" and \"KELLY CLARKSON!\".\n\nAnchorman (2004)\n\nCast: Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Christina Applegate, Steve Carell\n\n40 year old virgin (2005)\n\nCast: Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Dodgeball, Wedding Crashers, Old School, Zoolander\n\nDance Movies\n\nAn interesting trend in the early 00s was the surge of teen dance movies. They often included a fish out of water story or a kid with something to prove. All of these dance flicks were accompanied with stellar soundtracks and had fans trying to learn the choreography. The acting in the movies was usually subpar as the cast consisted of professionally trained dancers and not actors. No one seemed to care however because the only scenes people watched were the dance sequences. You Got Served is a perfect example of this. I couldn't really tell you the plot to this day, but I do know that the dance scenes blew my mind. I had never seen dancing like that before. It wasn't always street style dancing though, as some movies focused on more traditional types of dance such as ballet. Center Stage was a huge hit when it was released in 2000. It showed the trials and tribulations of students at a competitive Dance school in New York and spawned several sequels.\n\nYou Got Served (2004)\n\nCast: Omarion Grandberry, Marques Houston, Jennifer Freeman, Meagan Good\n\nBonus K-Fed clip:\n\nCenter Stage (2000)\n\nCast: Amanda Schull, Zoe Saldana, Susan May Pratt, Peter Gallagher\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Step Up, Stomp the Yard, Save the Last Dance\n\nTroubled Teens\n\nNot all teen movies in the late 90s early 00s were about parties and getting laid. A new type of teen film emerged that showed that teenagers could be twisted, unwell, confused, etc. One of the best examples of the troubled teen was Cruel Intentions. Sebastian and Katherine were rich, latch-key teens who grew bored with their privileged life and tortured their peers for entertainment. Most if not all the teens in this film dealt with serious complex issues that even some adults do not grapple with. One of the weirder offerings during this time was Donnie Darko. It was creepy, funny, & poignant. I had to watch it several times to even understand what the hell was going on.\n\nCruel Intentions (1999)\n\nCast: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Selma Blair, Ryan Phillippe, Reese Witherspoon\n\nDonnie Darko (2001)\n\nCast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jenna Malone, Patrick Swayze\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: The Virgin Suicides, American Beauty\n\nDawson's Creek Cast\n\nDawson's Creek was a huge hit for the WB network. Naturally, the cast branched off into their own projects in their downtime. I would argue that Joshua Jackson had the best career post DC. He played many diverse characters, but my favorite was Luke McNamara in The Skulls. This movie had everything: secret societies, privilege, murder, cover-ups, duels...you name it. Another great film from a Creek alumni was 1999s Varsity Blues. James Van Der Beek plays a back up quarterback who is thrown into the spoltlight when the starter, Paul Walker, injures himself. I can attest that High School Football in Texas is a HUGE deal, and I loved that they didn't shy away from the harsh realities that many of these players face.\n\nThe Skulls (2000)\n\nCast: Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker, Leslie Bibb, Hill Harper\n\nVarsity Blues (1999)\n\nCast: James Ven Der Beek, Paul Walker, Amy Smart, Jon Voight\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Teaching Miss Tingle, Gossip, The Rules of Attraction\n\nThis is College\n\nBooze. Parties. Drugs. Sex. Life Lessons. These are the ingredients to your typical college movie. They often deal with the pressures of getting good grades, finding a job after graduation, or facing the harsh realities of the real world. Sorority Boys follows 3 young men who are framed by a fraternity brother and accused of stealing $$$. In the process of trying to get back into the good graces of the fraternity they befriend the D.O.G sorority across the street and realize how terrible they had treated them in the past. I love this movie for the fact that the frat realizes the error of their ways and turned things around in the end. How High is a ridiculous college comedy about 2 inner city men who smoke the ashes of their genius dead friend and somehow end up in Harvard. The remainder of the film shows the duo trying to stay in Harvard and woo 2 lovely ladies.\n\nSorority Boys (2002)\n\nCast: Barry Watson, Michael Rosenbaum, Harland Williams, Melissa Sagemiller\n\nHow High (2001)\n\nCast: Method Man, Red Man, Lark Voorhies, Essence Atkins\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Roadtrip, Accepted, Van Wilder\n\nHorror for a New Generation\n\nMainstream horror of the 90s and early 00s was a mish-mash of jump scares and torture-porn. Every movie tried to top the next in terms of shock value (IE: SAW). Very few films were focused on building the tension and atmosphere to create fear in the viewer. The remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a beautifully shot film. It's hard to top the original, but they sure came close. Another horror movie that I was pleasently surprised by was Joyride. The premise is ridiculous, but the writers & actors did a good job making the story of 2 brothers being stalked by a psycho truck driver named Rusty Nail seem real. It also had just the right amount of comic relief with Steve Zahn in the cast.\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)\n\nCast: Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, Mike Vogel, Eric Balfour\n\nJoyride (2001)\n\nCast: Paul Walker, Leelee Sobieski, Steve Zahn, Jessica Bowman\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Cabin Fever, Hostel, Jeepers Creepers\n\nMindless Comedies\n\nThe early 00s was a great time for the mindless comedy. The plots were basically non-existent, they included random fantasy like sequences, and often included heavy drug and alcohol use. These were the movies that you would turn your brain off to watch or ones that can lift your spirits even in the worst of situations. The fact that they made an entire movie out 2 guys driving to White Castle is mindblowing and it did not disappoint. Another favorite of mine is Eurotrip. The cast may not have been very well known, but I laughed from start to finish. The cameos from Matt Damon and Lucy Lawless put this film at the top of my list.\n\nHarold and Kumar Go to White Castle (2004)\n\nCast: Jon Cho, Kal Penn, David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas\n\nEurotrip (2004)\n\nCast: Scott Mechlowicz, Jacob Pitts, Michelle Trachtenberg, Travis Wester\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: American Pie, Half Baked, Super Troopers\n\nTeenage Sports Films\n\nThey just don't make teen sports movies like they used to. They ranged from corny to gritty and were usually based on true stories. Being a cheerleader in HS, I related HARD to Bring it On. It showed the many personalities that were often found on squads as well as the hard work that actually went into going to Nationals/competing. But you can't bring up teen movies without mentioning Remember the Titans. On top of it being a sports film, it also tackled (pun intended) segregation and the racism that plagued the South in the 60s and 70s. I laughed, I cried, I cheered. This was a perfect film from start to finish in my book.\n\nBring it On (2000)\n\nCast: Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Gabrielle Union, Jesse Bradford\n\nRemember the Titans (2000)\n\nCast: Denzel Washington, Wood Harris, Will Patton, Ryan Hurst\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:Friday Night Lights, Radio, Coach Carter\n\nThis is High School\n\nHigh School was shitty for just about everyone. There were bullies, crushes, failed tests, and peer pressure. I was already in college by the time that Mean Girls was released, but boy did I recognize many of the characters in that movie. To me this was a very realistic portrayal of the complicated dynamics between teenage girls/frenemies and it did a good job of showing the other side of the mean girls. The exact opposite of realistic: Taking an already good looking \"nerd\" and performing a half ass makeover in an attempt to gain favor with the popular crowd. Coupled with middle aged looking students and a love story, She's All That is a High School must see. My favorite part of the film was Matthew Lillard's character Brock, who stole literally every scene he was in.\n\nMean Girls (2004)\n\nCast: Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lizzy Caplan, Amanda Seyfried\n\nShe's All That (1999)\n\nCast: Rachel Leigh Cook, Freddie Prinze Jr., Paul Walker, Gabrielle Union\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Can't Hardly Wait, Drive Me Crazy, The Girl Next Door\n\nBONUS\n\nThis was a hard list to make because there were so many movies that I loved during this time in my life.

Many of the artists who created their 2008 smash hits were never able to replicate the success. However, their songs always take us back in time. Let's take a look at some of the best one hit wonders of 2008!\n\nYael Naim - New Soul\n\nNaim served in the Israeli air force as part of the orchestra and was able to take what she had learned musically to apply deep layers of orchestral music to the lilting melody of “New Soul.” The song became a hit when it was used in a commercial for Apple but we didn't hear much else from her since. The song peaked at no. 7 on the Hot 100 in February 2008.\n\nBuckcherry - Sorry\n\nBuckcherry is best known for their 2005 song, \"Crazy Bitch,\" an overplayed trailer trash local bar anthem. But the group did not see any mainstream success until their 2008 hit, \"Sorry.\" The song peaked at no. 9 on the Hot 100 in March 2008.\n\nEstelle - American Boy\n\nBritish singer Estelle's sweet grooves and vocals stole the show in 2008. The UK artist was challenged to come up with a song about an American boy, and with plenty of material to draw from her past, this funky pop gem peaked at no. 9 on the Hot 100 in the fall of 2008.\n\nMetro Station - Shake It\n\nMiley Cyrus' horse-faced brother Trace briefly appeared to be rivaling Miley's popularity when his dance-rock outfit Metro Station's chart-conquering hit \"Shake It\" first appeared. The song peaked at no. 10 on the Hot 100. However, three years later, Metro Station called it quits, with only one self-titled album to their name.\n\nJennifer Hudson - Spotlight\n\nJennifer Hudson has a Grammy, Golden Globe, and an Oscar, so there is no doubt that this woman is extremely talented. However, when it comes to radio success, her only top 40 single was her fantastic 2008 “Spotlight” which charted at No. 24 on the Hot 100.\n\nDuffy - Mercy\n\nIn 2008, soulful singers like Adele and Amy Winehouse were just bursting onto the scene. Duffy was among them. “Mercy” was a jazzy tune with a great hook, and Duffy’s distinctive voice made this a memorable tune that stood out in the midst of the brief neo-soul revival. This cachy song peaked at no. 27 on the Hot 100 in the spring of 2008.\n\nGavin Rossdale - Love Remains The Same\n\nGavin Rossdale is no stranger in music and has been around for decades, but nothing has been as successful as his 2008 solo-hit \"Love Remains the Same.\" The song peaked at no. 27 on the Hot 100 in September 2008.\n\nShawty Lo - Dey Know\n\nShawty Lo almost tasted success when D4L hit it big with \"Laffy Taffy.\" But despite being in the group, he was in jail at the time the song was recorded, and thus wasn't featured on the track. Lo hit the studio and dropped his slow flow on \"Dey Know.\" The song peaked at no. 31 on the Hot 100. Lo had some other hits but none saw the same success.\n\nSaving Abel - Addicted\n\nReleased in March 2008, the song was later that year certified Gold by the RIAA and charted at no. 3 on the Billboard US Mainstream Rock charts, and peaked at no. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band has since released more albums but none have seen the same success.\n\nFlyleaf - All Around Me\n\nI, personally, think of their 2005 song \"I'm So Sick\" when I think of Flyleaf but the band didn't reach their peak until the summer of 2008 with their top 40 hit, \"All Around Me.\" The song peaked at no. 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the band never saw a hit again.\n\nWhat were you bopping to in 2008, ONTD?\n\nSource | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10\n\n↧\n\nWill Smith Chose Suicide Squad over Independence Day 2\n\n-Emmerich said that when the new screenwriters came on board, Smith's character went from having a central father-son role in the movie to the sidelines since the rewrite emphasized the new generation more.\n\n-Smith himself said straight out in an interview months ago that it was more about timing. “It was one of those things — I had a couple of films lined up, I had Concussion and Suicide Squad, and so it was a decision, timing-wise, between Independence Day and Suicide Squad,” the actor said.\n\n“The world is in a place of nostalgia right now,” he added. “Specifically in entertainment, there’s such a pull for nostalgia, so it was just the perfect opportunity and it didn’t work out.”\n\nsource\n\n↧\n\nDigimon Adventure Tri is coming to America!\n\n- Being done by Eleven Arts, Toei Animation, and Studiopolis.

I think that many of the people who were complaining were actually lovers of the [original] movie, not haters of women.”\n\nHe also thinks that some of the backlash came from the first trailer.\n\n“I think we got off to a bad start. It wasn’t so much that the trailer was bad or terrible. In its minute and a half, it couldn’t represent what the movie actually is.”\n\nHe gives the film his personal stamp of approval.\n\n“How wonderful those four women are together? Individually and together, they’re as unique as Bill Murray and [Dan] Aykroyd and [Harold] Ramis and [Ernie] Hudson were. They look like they should be together.

Movies were an important aspect of my life growing up, so I decided to make a definitive list of iconic movies/actors that helped define specific time periods of my childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. This is the last of a 3 part series of posts. Each time period will contain 10 highlights, in no particular order, that I felt best fit my experience. So sit back, relax, and relive your youth.\n\nThis post goes out to the middle 80's babies (84-86).\n\nPart 1. Part 2\n\n20’s/adulthood\n\nThe Slacker Pack\n\nFollowing in the footsteps behind the Frat Pack of the last post, is the slacker pack. These young 20 and 30 somethings have DOMINATED comedy in the late 00s & early ‘10s. While the plots range from end of the world to unplanned pregnancy, rest assured that marijuana or binge drinking is heavily featured. As the slacker pack gets older, they have begun to weave typical adulthood rite of passages into their movies such as marriage, children, sickness and death. One can only wonder what the next generation of the “pack” will look like…\n\nPineapple Express (2008)\n\nCast: Seth Rogen, James Franco, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson\n\nThis is the End (2013)\n\nCast: Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Knocked Up, Superbad\n\nSaturday Night Live Cast\n\nThe 00s spawned a very likable and funny SNL cast consisting of Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Kristin Wiig, Jason Sudeikis, Bill Hader, Andy Samberg, and Will Forte. They brought a different brand of humor to the show, and gave us instant classics like their SNL shorts. Some of the funniest movies in the late 00s & early ‘10s were based on SNL sketches or included 2 or more members of this newer cast. Hate all you want, but Macgruber is still one of the funniest movies I’ve ever seen in my life. It was just so ridiculous and dumb that you couldn’t help but laugh. They kept the humor simple which I feel worked in their advantage. Another SNL cast classic is Bridesmaids. I totally related to this movie as I was at the age when all of my friends were starting to get married and plan their lives, but I was out partying and keeping a total of $24 in my checking account. For me the standout in this movie was Melissa McCarthy, who has since gone on to score her own starring roles in blockbuster films.\n\nMacgruber (2010)\n\nCast: Will Forte, Kristen Wiig, Ryan Phillippe, Val Kilmer\n\nBridesmaids (2011)\n\nCast: Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: 7 days in Hell (TV Movie), Hot Rod, Baby Mama\n\nTV to Big Screen\n\nIt is very difficult to take shows on the small screen and turn them into hits on the big screen. Many have tried and failed (see: Sex and the City, Miami Vice). When I heard they would be doing a 21 Jumpstreet movie starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill…I was scratching my head in confusion. 1: this was an odd pairing and completely out of left field, 2: they couldn’t have thought of different show to turn into a movie? We were wrong, we were all wrong. This movie had comedy, it had action, & it had romance. It perfectly showed the disconnect of 2 late 20 something adults returning to High School and their trouble navigating the reversal of roles in a teenage setting. A TV show turned movie franchise reboot that I was very excited for was Star Trek. I grew up watching it and its spin offs. JJ Abrams did a lovely job with the casting, especially with Zachary Quinto as Spock.\n\n21 Jumpstreet (2012)\n\nCast: Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Dave Franco, Brie Larson\n\nStar Trek (2009)\n\nCast: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Eric Bana., Leonard Nimoy\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Veronica Mars, The Simpsons Movie, Transformers\n\nSuperhero Movies\n\nBefore the over saturation of superhero tales, a comic book character getting a film adaptation was thrilling and exciting. When RDJ was announced to play Ironman, the general consensus was that it would either be a huge hit or fail with disastorous results. After seeing the movie for the first time, it was clear to many viewers that RDJ was born to play this role. This film ushered in the 12+(I’m probably forgetting some) Marvel films to date. Every person my age remembers Batman ala Tim Burton. It was creepy, corny, dark, and just about everything in between. While I love those movies, it was nice to see a more modern and serious take on the caped crusader. While I do find that I like Batman Begins more than The Dark Knight, I can’t argue with literally everyone else on the planet’s taste. Heath Ledger WAS the Joker and I think his performance will live on as one of the best in a superhero movie.\n\nIron Man (2008)\n\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwenyth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\n\nCast: Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Aaron Eckhart\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Deadpool, The Avengers, X-Men: First Class\n\nMovie Fads\n\nMovies in the late 00s & early ‘10s usually fell into 1 of 3 categories: 3D, shaky cam/found footage, & everything else. You could not escape these fads. Movies that had no business being in 3D were being produced at an alarming rate. Usually the 3D was lacking and very unnecessary. The first movie that I can remember in the 00s being marketed with the 3D emphasis was My Bloody Valentine. I remember seeing a commercial for it and being excited to go to the theater and get my 3D glasses and enjoy. Now they have 3D TVs for our viewing pleasure. The other annoying fad that took prominence in the 00s was the found footage/shaky cam. Almost every cheap horror film was presented as a story that was captured by the victims on their own cameras. The one I found the most terrifying was Quarantine. I only watched it once…but that was enough for me.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine 3D (2009)\n\nCast: Jensen Ackles, Jaime King, Betsy Rue, Kerr Smith\n\nQuarantine (2008)\n\nCast: Jennifer Carpenter, Steve Harris, Jay Hernandez, Johnathon Schaech\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: As Above So Below, Tron Legacy, Paranormal Activity\n\nCrazy Twists\n\nWho doesn’t love a good twist? M. Night Shyamalan made bank in the 90s and early 00s on his twist ending movies that left most viewers saying “WTF?”. Sometimes the twists are boring and predictable, other times they are way out of left field. One twist that I felt was great was Gone Girls. Finding out that the wife had planned her own kidnapping just to spite her piece of shit husband was vindictively delicious. I also enjoyed the ~kinda~ twist in Cabin in the Woods where the teens are basically on a appease the gods or doom the world game show that was controlled by a secret corporate entity. I feel these endings gave the stories more depth that added to meat of the story.\n\nGone Girl (2014)\n\nCast: Rosemund Pike, Ben Affleck, Kim Dickens, Neil Patrick Harris\n\nCabin in the Woods (2011)\n\nCast: Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Jessie Williams, Fran Kranz\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: The Visit, Shutter Island, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\n\nDecent Remakes\n\nIt is becoming more apparent that Hollywood is running out of ideas. From unnecessary sequels to rebooting franchises, movies these days are all too familiar. The new trend of the moment is remakes of classic films. While the result is usually terrible and a slap in the face of the original…there have been some remakes that are easy to stomach, and often improving on the 1st film. I very much enjoyed the remake of Fright Night which told the story to a modern teenage audience. It’s a shame it wasn’t a bigger hit in theaters because I felt this movie was very stylish and well done and it included an excellent cast. Another great remake was 2013’s Evil Dead. It captured the zany moments and amplified the gore. It also made the lead, kick-ass character a woman and that is A-OK in my book.\n\nFright Night (2011)\n\nCast: Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell, Imogen Poots, Toni Collette\n\nEvil Dead (2013)\n\nCast: Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Jessica Lucas, Lou Taylor Pucci\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Total Recall, True Grit, The Last House on the Left\n\nLifetime Movies: Part 2\n\nLifetime continued their reign of excellent programming with their “ripped from the headlines” format and good & terrible biopic movies with awful casting choices. Fab Five is one of my fav newer generation lifetime movies because I live very close to the high school where this took place and it was front page news for months. Ashley Benson stars as the Principal’s daughter and leader of the Fab Five…a rogue group of asshole, spoiled teenagers who torment their peers, teachers, and cheerleading coach (played by Jenna Dewan-Tatum). Another Lifetime film that garnered major press was Liz & Dick starring the infamous Lindsay Lohan. The viewing post for this film was legendary.The acting was laughable, but it did create many gifable moments.\n\nFab Five: The Texas Cheerleader Scandal (2008)\n\nCast: Jenna Dewan Tatum, Ashley Benson, Tatum O’Neal, Ashlynn Ross\n\nLiz & Dick (2012)\n\nCast: Lindsay Lohan, Grant Bowler, Theresa Russell, David Hunt\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: The Brittany Murphy Story, A Deadly Adoption, The Unauthorized Saved by the Bell Story\n\nIt’s all in the past\n\nSome of my favorite movies are ones that do not take place in present time. I especially like films that take place in the past. The costumes are fascinating and the set pieces make you feel as if you have actually stepped back in time. Sherlock Holmes was a good example of this. The dialogue was great and I felt completely immersed in the story even though it was taking place 100+ years before my time. It was great seeing him use 1800's technology to solve the case. Another 19th century flick I enjoyed was Django Unchained. It was brutal and honest about the horrors of slavery…and it was done in a very Tarantino-esque way. My favorite scene was the inept KKK mob who dilly dallied by arguing about the quality of the masks they were given.\n\nSherlock Holmes (2009)\n\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Rachel McAdams, Jude Law, Mark Strong\n\nDjango Unchained (2012)\n\nCast: Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: The Help, Palm Trees in the Snow, Straight Outta Compton\n\nMind-Bending Sci-Fi\n\nI love Sci-Fi movies….especially those that I have to watch numerous times to understand and/or hit up the imdb.com message boards for explanations & fan theories. Inception was a beautiful film that dealt with dreams and reality. It also gifted us with JGL in a fancy suit. I enjoyed the open ending with the top spinning as well. Another film that I had to read up on was Looper. Time travel movies always get to me and my head often hurts from the amount of theories and paradoxes that can arise from these types of plots. JGL was transformed into a younger Bruce Willis with prosthetic nose, chin, and lip enhancements. Emily Blunt was also fantastic as the mother of the young boy who befriends Gordon-Levitt’s character.\n\nInception (2010)\n\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy\n\nLooper (2012)\n\nCast: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, Paul Dano\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Interstellar, The Edge of Tomorrow, Prometheus (Loved it…IDGAF), Lucy\n\nVIDEO SOURCE 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.\n\nSOURCE 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.\n\nWhat are some of your movie memories, ONTD?\n\nThe Music Retrospect posts here: Part 1Part 2Part 3\n\n*DISCLAIMER: I welcome any and all “pathetic grandmas can’t let go of the past comments”*\n\nHi, Buzzfeed!\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: 2009, A year of one hit wonders\n\nPrevious Posts: 2001 / 2002-2003 / 2004 / 2005 / 2006 / 2007 / 2008\n\nIn the final entry of the '00's One Hit Wonder series, let's take a trip back to 7 years ago, when artists like Asher Roth, The Veronicas and Ester Dean were topping the charts. Many of the artists who created their 2009 smash hits were never able to replicate the success. However, their songs always take us back in time. Let's take a look at some of the best one hit wonders of 2009!\n\nShinedown - Second Chance\n\nThis song was quite the hit, and continues to be played on rock radio stations all the time. It charted at no. 1 on several Billboard charts, and peaked at no. 7 on the Hot 100 chart. The band has released four albums in total, and have sold over 6 million albums worldwide—though no single of theirs has yet managed to top “Second Chance”.\n\nAsher Roth - I Love College\n\nAsher skyrocketed to no. 12 on the Hot 100 with this instant hit. He served us a great value brand Eminem and white college kids rejoiced nation wide. After winning unnecessary hip hop and new artist awards, Roth faded into obscurity where he belonged.\n\nKristina DeBarge - Goodbye\n\nKristina DeBarge peaked at no. 15 on the Hot 100 with her hit. After her 15 minutes were up, she attempted to release another album but has not been able to create another hit since.\n\nThe Veronicas - Untouched\n\nAlthough this bop was released in 2007, the Veronicas did not hit success with this song until 2009 when the song peaked at no. 17 on the Hot 100. The sisters continue to make music but have not seen success on this level since.\n\nRon Browz - Pop Champagne\n\nThere really is something to be said about new artists with stage names and songs that refer to a high class lifestyle—they often wind up doing the exact opposite of what they suggest. His party song hit no. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100, but then his work after that went flat.\n\nDorrough - Ice Cream Paint Job\n\n“Yeah buddy rolling like a big shot, chevy tuned up like a NASCAR pit stop.” Dorrough had everyone rapping his song “Ice Cream Paint Job.” The hit peaked at no. 27 on the Hot 100 but this was the last time we heard anything from Dorrough.\n\nEster Dean - Drop It Low\n\nEster Dean has written for many artists and does well for herself in that musical area. However, Dean is a one hit wonder when it comes to her solo music career. Drop it Low peaked at no. 38 on the Hot 100. Ester Dean still continues to make music and act.\n\nThe Ting Tings - That's Not My Name\n\nWhile this single was a legit smash hit – reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart in May 2008 and peaking at no. 39 on the Hot 100 in 2009 – they’ve been unable to replicate anywhere near the same level of success in the handful of singles and studio albums since.\n\nJessie James - Wanted\n\nThis bargain basement Christina Aguilera peaked at no. 40 on the Hot 100 with this annoying song. I think Jessie still has a career in country music but who knows, and who cares tbh.\n\n90's One Hit Wonders coming soon!\n\nSource | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original™: A Pop(Culture) Odyssey '90-'00\n\nWhether you like it or not, the 90's are back. Certain trends are revived by newer generations, while others(thankfully) are left in the past. Some people may cringe when they think of the fads from 20-25 years ago, but I really have grown to appreciate their kitschiness. Here is a look back at some of the biggest things to happen in pop culture from '90-'99.\n\nFashion/Beauty\n\nJNCO Jeans\n\nI was never caught up in the JNCO trend, but many of my friends caved and bought themselves a pair of the super wide leg jeans. They also started smoking in the bathroom at school...but that's a tale for another time. From goth kids to skater kids...almost everyone fell for the JNCO aesthetic. There were deep pockets, a loop for your sweet wallet chain, and they came in a range of colors.\n\nThe Rachel\n\nYoung women everywhere were running to their nearest salon begging for \"The Rachel\". A particularly ugly haircut, The Rachel was made famous by Jennifer Aniston's character, Rachel Green, in NBC's \"Friends\". Not since Felicity cut her long locks has a character's hair affected the masses to this extent.\n\nWWJD bracelets\n\nYa'll. YA'LL. I wasn't even religious, but I had to have a WWJD bracelet in every color & Pattern available. I didn't even wear them, I put them on my backpack. I'm sure the makers of the bracelet had good intentions, but they became a must have fashion accessory and pretty much lost all of it's original meaning.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Jellies, Grunge-look, scrunchies\n\nToys\n\nPogs\n\nWhen I think back about Pogs, the more ridiculous they sound. Cheap ass milk caps that you stack and try to slam? These CEOs made bank off this nonsense. Nonetheless, I wanted pogs with my fav TV characters, pretty colors, and funny sayings.\n\nTamagotchi\n\nThis was the toy that every kid had to get to show their parents they could actually care for that real life puppy they so desperately wanted. Very few succeeded. Your Tamagotchi pet was probably dead within a couple weeks. I did have a friend whose Tama actually survived being hung up on her bedroom doorknob for months. I recently looked into buying an original Tamagotchi but the prices have skyrocketed into the $250-$300 range for the most basic model.\n\nFurby\n\nThis spike from Gremlins lookin' demon toy used to scare the crap out of me when I was a kid. They would randomly say things in the middle of the night and even say words you swear you never taught them. Most kids were probably just repeating cuss words to their Furby, with the hope that it would become a foul mouth mimic.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Beanie Babies, Skip-it, Glo-Worm\n\nFood\n\nCrystal Pepsi\n\nyou would think by that commercial that Pepsi found the cure for cancer or achieved world peace right? NAH, they just took the brown color out of their sugary beverages. From what I remember Crystal Pepsi tasted exactly like regular Pepsi, although some people swore that it was different. Pepsi recently re-released the Crystal version to far less fan-fare.\n\nCandy Cigarettes\n\nIt's hard to believe that at one time, companies were marketing cigarettes to kids in the form of candy. They came in very believable packaging and would emit \"smoke\" when children blew threw them. I loved these as a kid and I thought I looked cool with the smoke coming out. Thankfully, most countries placed restrictions or outright banned this desensitizing candy.\n\nBubble Tape\n\nI love bubblegum and it was super fun having gum that you could pull out like tape. I also enjoyed the commercials for this candy because they made the gum seem way less basic then it actually was. It's amazing how changing one thing about the packaging & presentation of a product can completely change people's perception of it.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Pop Rocks, Fun Dip, Ring Pop\n\nCeleb Scandals\n\nMilli Vanilli Lip Sync Scandal\n\nWhere were you when Milli Vanilli was caught lip synching during their MTV performance? The repeat of \"Girl You Know it's\" over and over again before they ran off stage was quite the scandal. Pre-dating Ashlee Simpson's embarrassing hoe down, this was the first time that I could recall that a major recording artist was caught red handed on stage in such a public manner. Can you say \"REMIX!\"? Eventually it was discovered that they were imposters who didn't even sing any of their own songs and were forced to give back their Best New Artist Grammy award. YIKES.\n\nCelebs caught in compromising positions\n\nPee-Wee Herman caught masturbating in an adult movie theater. Eddie Murphy caught with a prostitute who he was just \"giving a ride home\". Hugh Grant also caught with a prostitute. These were the days before celebs every move was tracked by social media and paparazzi. It somehow made the news more shocking, but it was also easily forgotten. Now with the introduction of the 24 hour news cycle, it's rare for celebs to live down incidents like these and continue to have lucrative careers.\n\nBritney Spears Nipplegate\n\nI remember perching my 15 year old self up to the TV to watch Britney Spears perform on the Nickelodeon Awards in 1999. After her performance was over, all I could think of was \"NIPPLES\". It appeared that overnight, our beloved Brit-Brit had matured into buxom young woman who had seemingly forgotten to wear a bra with adequate padding/coverage. While it seems trivial now, everyone was scandalized at her \"display\" during a kid's award show performance. Was it cold outside? was it on purpose? Was everyone overreacting?\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Tommy Lee and Pamela Sex tape, Nancy Kerrigan clubbing incident, Heidi Fleiss\n\nIconic TV Characters\n\nSteve Urkel\n\nFamily Matters introduced the world to everyone's favorite nerd, Steve Urkel, who became a household name with his thick rimmed glasses and his suspenders. People were shouting \"Did I do that?\" from the rooftops and wishing that Laura Lee Winslow would give in and finally date him. I particularly enjoyed his suave alter ego, Stefan Urquelle.\n\nBuffy Summers\n\nKicking vampire ass and taking names. Buffy somehow managed to keep Sunnydale safe from plunging into the depths of hell hole, graduate from High School, and always look cute while charming the pants off of local bad boy vamp turned good guy, Angel. She did get tons of help from her crew of teenage misfits including Willow and Xander. This show was so good, and her character is ICONIC even to this day.\n\nHomer Simpson\n\nDoh! While he may not win Dad of the Year, Homer has given us plenty of LOL moments. He has worked 20+ years at the Nuclear Power Plant groveling under the thumb of the decrepit, Mr. Burns. Although he strangles his son and has an obsession for donuts, his love for his family and his willingness to do anything for them will leave him forever immortalized in the minds of those who lived through and loved the 90s.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Ally McBeal, Frasier, Eric Cartman\n\nSOURCE 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.\n\nDo you wish it was the 90s again, ONTD?\n\nHi, Buzzfeed!\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: Hottest 15 Male Power Rangers.\n\nAll the actors that ever played a Ranger have a few things in common: Pretty faces, nice bodies, questionable acting skills and DOA careers. Here's the Top 15 imho.\n\n15. Carter (Sean CwJohnson)\n\nRed Ranger, Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue\n\nProbaby one of the most vanilla rangers, but also a cute one. He was the typical good guy who happened to be a republican, lived in the suburbs, admired Paul Ryan, only made love to his wife in missionary but also liked to be dominated by a man whore. He was one of the few rangers that came back for the 20th anniversary episode and he was looking OK.\n\n14. Troy (Andrew M. Gray)\n\nRed Ranger, Power Rangers Megaforce\n\nOne of the most recent Rangers. His acting makes Rihanna feel like an Oscar winner and his whining about his dad was a turn-off, but he kept me hooked when he took his shirt off and morphed into past rangers.\n\n13. Chase (James Davies)\n\nBlack Ranger, Power Rangers Dino Charge\n\nThe character is supposed to be some aussie class clown, but he's just pretty enough to look at. His instagram is filled with enough selfies to give Kim K. a run for her money. Probably BJ'd his way to the role.\n\n12. Adam (Johnny Yong Bosch)\n\nGreen Ranger, Power Rangers Zeo\n\nAdam was one of the few rangers that went through many generations, but he looked his bet at the beginning of Zeo. Everything went to hell when he let his hair grew. He came back for the 15th anniversary special and is aging like fine wine.\n\n11. Flynn (Ari Boyland)\n\nBlue Ranger, Power Rangers RPM\n\nI haven't seen RPM, but saw a vid of him in a convention and looks nice. He's probably the first gay ranger, and he has a severe case of pretty gay face. I'd gladly bang.\n\n10. Wes/Alex (Jason Faunt)\n\nRed Ranger, Power Rangers Time Force\n\nDuring Time Force he played two roles: Wes the immature ranger and Alex, Jen's dead husband, and i just wanted to be in the middle of that Jason Faunt sandwich. He came back during Super Megaforce's final battle and is still looking mighty fine.\n\n9. Cole (Ricardo Medina Jr.)\n\nRed Ranger, Power Rangers Wild Force\n\nCole loved to be shirtless and was kinda dumb, basically Channing Tatum's ranger. His latest credits include the 11 o'clock news where he appeared after being charged for killing a man. Don't worry, he won't go to jail. You can enjoy his talent in RandyBlue.com in a couple months probably...\n\n8. Jack (Brandon Jay McLaren)\n\nRed Ranger, Power Rangers SPD\n\nOut of all the Power Rangers, he's probably one of the few who managed to get a decent career after being a Ranger with big roles in Falling Skyes, The Killing and Graceland. He's still packing a greaaaaaaaat bod that will make you call SPD EMERGENCYYYY!!!\n\n7. Koda (Yoshua Sudarzo)\n\nBlue Ranger, Power Rangers Dino Charge\n\nAnother of the newest Saban/Nick rangers. irl the actor is a cosplayer and quite into sci-fi/fantasy. I think he would've been a damn great Magnus Bane for Shadowhunters, but still, that role of 'zombie #15' in the Walking Dead won't play itself.\n\n6. Tommy (Jason David Frank)\n\nBlack Ranger, Power Rangers Dino Thunder\n\nTommy was always loved by everyone, kids adored him, moms wanna have him, girls wanna have him, guys wanna be him and gays wanna be in him. He was just loved by everyone but he looked his best when he came back many seasons later for Power Rangers Dino Thunder. He's been known for whoring around and will probably beg for a cameo in the new PR movie. Oh and he's an MAA fighter now so he's got a very nice bod.\n\n5. Mike (Hector David Jr.)\n\nGreen Ranger, Power Rangers Samurai\n\nProbably one of the rangers with the prettiest eyes. He was one of the few reasons that kept me hooked when the show came back in Nick.\n\n4. Jason (Austin St. John)\n\nRed Ranger, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\n\nAhhhh. one of my first crushes.... Jason. Right before Tommy came he was the reason i wanted to be Kimberly. you just know they were fucking in the Angel Grove Youth Center's basement while Ernie was watching. i just wanted him to bow so i could have a bite of that magnificent ass.\n\nAnd no, he's not Brock from Seancody and is not doing gay porn yet.\n\n3. Nick (Firass Dirani)\n\nRed Ranger, Power Rangers Mystic Force\n\nScratch what i said. This guy has the pretties eyes any Ranger ever had. And he's had a decent career in some Aussie dramas right after PR. Also, probably the one who bottom'd his way to the role.\n\n2. TJ (Selwyn Ward)\n\nBlue Ranger, Power Rangers in Space\n\nOften overlooked, TJ was one of the hottest rangers, and probably a better leader than Jason, Tommy and Rocky. With a goddamn smile that made me swoon. I just wanted him to play with my ass like this:\n\n1. Leo (Danny Slavin)\n\nRed Ranger, Power Rangers Lost Galaxy\n\nYes. He was charming, he had a great body, and was a different kind of leader than previous ones (way better than flop Andros anyway). Also, i fapped til i dislocated my hand to this iconic scene where he was taken hostage and bound, and ended up getting shirtless:\n\nYASSSS PAPI!!! The show was aware of his appeal so unlike previous seasons, they had him on a tight top during the credits:\n\nHe'll always be remembed as the sexiest ranger... although funny enough, he just did Power Rangers to pay for his education. Now he's an associate in a law firm.\n\nSource: Me and 22 years wasted seeing Power Rangers.\n\nONTD, do you agree? who's missing?\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original™: A Pop(Culture) Odyssey '01-'10\n\nThe 2000's...the millennium. The future was here. I spent most of my formative years in the 00's from age 16-26. It was full of tacky, technology, and tastiness. While we haven't experienced a revival...yet, Let's take a trip back thru the pop culture of the 00's.\n\n90's post.\n\nFashion/Beauty\n\nPencil Thin Eyebrows\n\nFor some reason, women everywhere began to pluck and wax their eyebrows to oblivion in the 2000s. Even men got into the action when they started man-scaping. My eyebrows still haven't recovered from my over plucking in the early 00's which is a bad thing since full eyebrows are now in style.\n\nTrucker Hats\n\nFrom Ashton Kutcher to Britney Spears, everyone was sporting trucker hats in the early to mid 00s. I too fell victim to this horrible trend. While I couldn't afford the Von Dutch hats, I did buy myself some cheapo hats with explicit/funny sayings on them.\n\nBedazzled Men's shirts\n\nIt was a dark time for men's fashion. The clubs & bars were full of gross dudes trying to buy you drinks whilst wearing their bedazzled skull baby tees. YUCK! to make matters worse, Jersey Shore on MTV really made this nonsense popular. Ed Hardy & Affliction were the top choice for douche bags across the world.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Chunky highlights, Juicy Tracksuits, Kitten Heels\n\nToys\n\nSilly Bands\n\nI was well into my mid 20's when silly bands became popular among children. The only reason I know of their existence is because I worked with small children in an after school program. I watched them fight and cry over trading/losing their silly bands. I even went as far as banning them from my classroom.\n\nBratz Dolls\n\nAgain, I was little too old for these dolls, but I distinctly remember the commercials with these stupid dolls. They looked like club Barbies with too much make up on. I'm still not sure what their appeal was.\n\nNintendo Wii\n\nNintendo Wii came out my senior year of college and me and my friends used to buy a box of wine and play tennis and boxing. SO many TVs were destroyed by people throwing their controllers on accident. Wii faded out just as fast as it got popular.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:Nintendo DS, PS3, XBOX\n\nFood\n\nFour Loko\n\nSHIT. I remember the first time I had a four loko. I was drunk after just 1 can. I blacked out after 2. This was what you would drink when you really wanted to get wasted. We would often play Edward Four Loko Hands (taping 2 four lokos to your hands with duct tape and trying to finish it without passing out) The energy drink part of it made you think that you weren't that drunk, but the alcohol drink of it made you want to fight even the very best of friends. They eventually had to pull the product due to teenagers dying, but they relaunched it without the caffeine portion of it.\n\nColored Ketchup\n\nGross. I don't know what the Heinz executives were thinking. I love ketchup, but I prefer that it be red. There was just something unsettling about having purple and green ketchup. The product ended up flopping, before being revived in the '10s.\n\n30 Minute Meals\n\nI used to skip classes in college and lay in bed and watch 30 minute meals. There was something about Rachel Ray that was enthralling. All the food looked delicious and it was done in 30 minutes. I always wondered what happened to all the extra food that she cooked on the show...\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: South Beach Diet, Cosmos, KFC Double Down\n\nCeleb Scandals\n\nBritney Spears Shaves her Head\n\nEveryone knows where they were when the pictures were released of Britney shaving her head. She had been spiraling for quite some time before this incident and it was weird to watch it happen in real time. It only got worse from there with her 5150 hospitalization and disastrous MTV performance.\n\nSuperbowl Nipplegate\n\nMy College roommate and I actually ended up taping this performance because we wanted to go to the dining hall before it closed for the night. Good thing we did because we caught the nipple heard round the world. At first we didn't even realize what we were seeing. This was such a big deal at the time and members of ONTD still bring this incident up to this day.\n\n1 night in Paris\n\nThe whole socialite explosion of the early 00s was such a weird thing to experience first hand. Internet gossip sites were just starting to become a thing and all they ever talked about was Paris this and Paris that. Her sex tape made waves when it was released and catapulted her into a whole new realm of fame.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Winona Ryder is a klepto, Anna Nicole Smith death, MJ trial\n\nIconic TV Characters\n\nVeronica Mars\n\nOne of my favorite TV characters of all time, Veronica Mars served us sass, savvy, and sarcasm. She always stood up for what she believed in even if it was the unpopular thing to do. Her supporting cast was excellent as well. If I could resurrect any TV show today...this would be the one.\n\nDave Chappelle as...\n\nPrince. Samuel L Jackson. Rick James. Lil Jon. Every character/person that Dave Chappelle played on his show was absolutely hilarious. You could not escape him in the early to mid 00's. It's a shame he left his show in the middle of the 3rd season, because I feel like he could have been successful for another 10 seasons.\n\nLieutenant Horatio Caine\n\nI mean. What is there to say. I loved this stupid show and I loved Horatio Caine's stupid one liners. I still say them when I put on my sunglasses till this day. He is the best character to come out of the CSI franchise...quote me on that.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Tony Soprano, Jack Bauer, Stewie Griffin\n\nSOURCE 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.\n\nAre you ready for the 00s revival, ONTD?\n\nHi, Buzzfeed!\n\n↧\n\nColton Haynes is an N'Sync/JC stan.\n\nColton Haynes bought a shitload of NSYNC memorabilia and took snapchat to show his new treasure. Obviously he's obsessed with JC but get in line bitch, he's mine!.\n\nSource\n\nONTD. Do you think they were fucking? NSYNC POST?!!!\n\n↧\n\nOriginal Blue Ranger Accuses Bryan Cranston of Homophobia\n\nAmy Jo Johnston (original pink ranger) asked David Yost (original Blue Ranger) what he thought of Cranston's casting. Yost is not happy.\n\nIn an interview from 2009 with IGN, they asked Cranston about his former ties with the franchise since he did some voicework for the show. This lead to the following exchange.\n\nCranston: One of my jobs as a young actor starting out was voiceover. I also did dubbing. A lot of dubbing and a lot of voiceover. [...] I had already been there for a number of years, just as a freelance guy coming in and coming out. [...] So I had been there for awhile already and then the Power Rangers came in . They actually named one of the Power Rangers after me.\n\nVince Gilligan: Yeah?!\n\nCranston: The Blue Power Ranger's last name is Cranston.\n\nIGN: [Laughs] Wow, that's pretty funny.\n\nVince Gilligan: That's an awesome story!\n\nCranston: He's the fey one, that's the problem.\n\nIt's the last line of the interview so there's no follow-up, and it's essentially used as a \"punchline\" for the end of the article. Yost's problems with it are understandable given his own history wrestling with his sexuality, and the treatment he received on the set of the show because of it.\n\nWhen IGN reused the excerpt about him doing voicework in a 2013 article, that last line was omitted.\n\n----\n\nIn other Power Rangers news, instead of just admitting he got some nice, fat check to play Zordon, Bryan Cranston said the script is what won him into signing onto the film. He was initially reluctant because he remembered it as \"kind of farcical and silly and ‘pow’ and ‘zow’ — weird movements and things like that.”\n\n\"I wasn’t really high on it until I talked to the producer and read the script and talked to the director. After that I went, ‘This is different. This is as different a reimagining as the ‘Batman’ television series as it became the [Nolan Batman] movie series. You can’t compare those two, and nor can you compare this movie version of the ‘Power Rangers’ to that television series. It’s unrecognizable for the most part. There are tenets of the folklore that you hold onto for sure, but the inspiration is different, and the sensibility of it, and the approach to the film making is completely different.\n\n\"So the appropriateness of that, and real teenage life, and going through high school and the cliques and the popularity or lack thereof, and the bullies and all the different sections and sub-sections of high school life, and the insecurities of these kids and things like that — hopes and dreams — and you embrace all of that into a retelling of the ‘Power Rangers.’ And what you would get is this new version, this new reimagined version.\"\n\nHe clarifies that he doesn't think it'll be quite as dark as The Dark Knight since you're dealing with teenagers.\n\nsource:1/2/34\n\nhe tweeted about this last week, but sites are just picking up on it now\n\n↧"
