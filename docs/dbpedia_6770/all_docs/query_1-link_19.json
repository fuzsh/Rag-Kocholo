        "text": "OMG our favorite sister duo, Aly & AJ, just dropped a brand new single! “Take Me” is a perfect Summer pop song and the first listen of the new music that Aly & AJ Michalka have been working on. It’s their first release of new music as “Aly & AJ” since they dropped one of our all time favorite pop albums, “Insomniatic,” in 2007. The sisters had been recording as 78Violet in recent years, playing shows in New York and LA.\n\nAly & AJ are set to release an EP later this Summer and we can’t wait for more! Listen to “Take Me” on Spotify now!"
