        "text": "Just like summer, there’s been some hot celeb gossip dropping in Hollywood. And as always, we’ve got the scoop on the most important celeb news this week. This week’s drama proves that, just like us—well maybe not just like us—our fave stars are experiencing the highs and lows of life. Keep reading to find out what’s going on.\n\nTry\n\nIt’s no secret that in today’s society, Photoshop is used on pretty much everything and women are highly criticized on their looks. Singer Colbie Caillat finally had enough of this and made a music video to show how she truly feels. Not only is Colbie’s song “Try” amazing, but the video she released this week sends out an important message about being yourself. Bravo!\n\nSelena Slams an Insta bully\n\nWe don’t always think about it, but it’s something celebs have to deal with on a daily basis: Random people being mean to them for no reason. When a girl posted an absurd comment on one of Sel’s pics this week (the comment & Instagram user’s account have since been deleted), reportedly saying that she should “burn in [h@#l] with cancer,” she wasn’t gonna stand for it. So what did she do? Selena commented on one of the girl’s Instagram pics saying, \"The comment you left about cancer was absurd. How distasteful of a young woman. You won't be winning 'anyone's' heart that way.”\n\nThe star went on to write, “Educate yourself a tad more. God bless love. Be an amazing woman. You're beautiful.\" We’re glad Selena is sticking up for herself. She then posted a screen grab of the comment onto her account and wrote, \"Honestly, I don't speak up much because it's simply *always* taken out of context. But I don't take bullying well. I have seen too much to not say anything.\" You go, girl!\n\nAly Michalka is engaged\n\nFormer Disney Channel star (and GL cover girl) Aly Michalka just got engaged to BF Stephen Ringer! The 78violet singer confirmed her engagement by posting a pic of her ring this week on none other than Instagram. “Hmmm….no one’s noticed yet. #Lookcloser,” Aly wrote. We’re pumped for this adorable couple and something tells us her big day will be boho chic amazingness and sis AJ will be the maid of honor.\n\nBlake Lively’s starting her very own lifestyle website\n\nOur fave gossip girl has been hard at work on her very own lifestyle site—and now we know the name. A source told E! this week that the site’s gonna be called “Preserve” and it’s set to launch next week! The insider says, \"Preserve will focus on artisans and products, many hand-made one-of-a-kind items all selected by Blake. Items will be available for purchase through the site.” We bet B’s blog will be just as chic as Serena van der Woodsen.\n\nDisney Channel Stars do Frozen\n\nWhat do we love more than Disney Channel? Frozen. So what happens when you put the two together? Amazingness, obvi. We learned this week that the channel is dedicating this whole weekend to the movie and they’re having 26 of their talent (including Rowan Blanchard and Dove Cameron) sing the flick’s popular songs. The Disney Channel fam's pop cover of \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\" premieres on Radio Disney today and the music video will premiere this Sunday on Disney Channel. You better free up your weekend sched because this is not to be missed."
