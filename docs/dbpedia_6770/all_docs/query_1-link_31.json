        "text": "DROP DEAD DIVA: 2.06 “Begin Again”\n\nSorry I didn’t write about last week’s episode, folks. I had it on while doing fifty things at home, so it didn’t have my full attention. I didn’t feel it was fair to write about something I half-watched.\n\nBut this week’s episode did have my full attention. Perhaps it’s the pop-lover in me (and yes, there’s some shame in that title), but the fact that Jane was representing pop stars really grabbed my attention. But something seemed a little off.\n\nI don’t know about you, but when I think of blonde teenage pop stars that are a sister duo and can also act, I naturally think of Aly & AJ Michalka, who are now called 78Violet. It just seemed like a good match for the show. The two would have gotten their own publicity by being on the show, but also, the show might’ve grabbed more viewers because their fans might’ve tuned in. Heck, they could have even included some of Aly & AJ’s original music! Doesn’t that all add up to great?\n\nI’m not saying that the girls who did play the popstar sisters were bad. They were fine. But it just seemed strange to have unrecognizable guest stars when you could have had the real deal–especially since Aly & AJ have acted before. Who knows? Maybe they were offered the gig and they didn’t want to portray alleged murderers. But in the end, we saw that wasn’t true anyway. Hey, that’s all just my opinion.\n\nThe girls were fine enough, even though we barely saw one of them. Do you think you could rat out you sister just to make sure you got less time in jail? I guess when you’re facing a lifetime in jail, eight years doesn’t seem like all that much, but that sure seems like a pretty big heap of years for a crime neither girl committed.\n\nI do lament that any time a celebrity character–not a guesting celebrity, but a character that is a celebrity in the world of Drop Dead Diva–is on the show, it feels a little like Legally Blonde. Unfortunately, this is something the show has run into before. This time, though, instead of hiding lipo or a secret identity, they were hiding the citrus diet. “I know day three!” It just seemed familiar. At least this time it didn’t come down to a perm.\n\nAs for the Grayson/Jane dynamic, I’m glad we’re seeing that Jane isn’t over Grayson yet, but I do miss Tony. I think it would work a little better if they were both in their own happy place, but Jane was still looking from afar, only to have Tony realize her heart wouldn’t ever be his. Sure, it would be a bit predictable, but we’d get Tony back in the show, and we wouldn’t have Jane looking so…pathetic? Is pathetic the right word? All this sounds just about the same as when she realized Grayson’s interest in Kim, so it too seems a little familiar.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I enjoyed the episode. I have to say that it’s hard to write about such a good show. In the end, I find myself nitpicking more than anything else. And I think that’s what I have here, just a few nitpicks.\n\nI don’t really post on news or music, but hey, these two kids have acted. One’s a Disney Channel brat, and shortly after, they both appeared in a Disney Channel movie. So they count. They can be on my blog.\n\nAnd since I’m doing the summer music idea (Is this only CD #2 I’ve mentioned? Must get on that), well, that’s more ammunition to the fire.\n\nI think these two are cute. Their songs are poppy. They fit good, wholesome teen movies. I am really attached to their Christmas music because they keep it traditional for the most part and don’t sing stupid songs about bubble gum clouds and marshmellows (think the Cheetah Girls). And since they’re not as over-the-top and overplayed like Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus, you can’t hate them.\n\nI’m someone who listens to pop music to brighten my mood. So they’re not bad for that purpose.\n\nSo what’s new? Well, for one thing, their name.\n\nThey announced today (in a statement and on Twitter) that the duo is changing their name to 78violet. Yes, that’s right. 78violet. As they said it, “This is how you spell ‘our new name’ 78violet. No spaces. All lower case letters. Love you all…”\n\nHere’s the thing: Why?\n\nSee, here’s something silly. Their names are Aly and AJ (or Alyson and AJ). People know them as that. In fact, it’s not even anything stifling like a made-up Disney Channel character that defines your music like Hannah Montana. It’s just…your names.\n\nSo why the change? No clue. What does it mean? Well, not sure why they chose “violet,” but they chose the 78 because…they released the statement on July 8 (get it? 7/8). Good thing it wasn’t June 9. Or April 20. Wait, maybe that would have been better.\n\nI can’t quite understand the reasoning. Maybe they just feel like since they’re growing, some things have to change. Does anyone else remember the good ol’ days when people used to just evolve their music and not their personas?\n\nWhat’s in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet…\n\nPerhaps like violets. Wait…no…"
