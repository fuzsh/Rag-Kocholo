        "text": "Aly & AJ Michalka, collectively known as 78violet, have signed with Jonathan Shank and Bruce Flohr at Red Light Management. The duo have been working on their first record in 6 years with producer David Kahne. ”We’re thrilled to introduce 78violet (formerly know as “Aly & AJ”) under Redlight Management. We’re honored to be represented by such a successful and forward thinking firm aimed towards artistry and longevity,” the duo said. They have also produced a video for their forthcoming single “Hothouse’ to be released later this summer under their production company “Violet House”.\n\nBoth girls have recently been featured in high profile film & tv projects with Aly starring in Bandslam, Easy A, and the hit CW show Hellcats, as well as costarring in the feature The Roommate. AJ has also been busy and co-starred in The Lovely Bones, Secretariat and Super 8. In 2013, AJ stars in the Lionsgate feature Grace Unplugged as well as the indie film Jesus In Cowboy Boots. This year Aly will star in the indie films Sequoia and Killing Winston Jones. She also makes a cameo appearance in Grown Ups 2.\n\nTheir last release, “Insomniatic,” sold over 2 million copies worldwide and spawned their platinum single, “Potential Breakup Song,” which to date has garnered over 45 million views on Youtube. Since becoming 78violet, they’ve managed to accumulate a significant social media footprint. This will be their first record released under the 78violet moniker. Aly & AJ continue to be represented by CAA and Principato-Young Entertainment. They currently reside in Los Angeles where they were born and raised."
