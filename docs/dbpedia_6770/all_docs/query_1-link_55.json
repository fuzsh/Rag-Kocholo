Aly and AJ, began their singing career almost simultaneously with their acting career. But music took a back seat for several years, and it wasn’t until 2017 that they re-emerged with an EP, Ten Years.

And we’ve gained some new fans who were introduced to us through Ten Years.”\n\nRaised in Torrance, California, the sisters started their show business careers with Disney. Aly was first, getting a role in 2004 in the show Phil of the Future, but in 2006 both appeared in the Disney Channel original movie Cow Belles.\n\nMeanwhile, the pop duo signed to the entertainment company’s Hollywood Records label and released their debut album, Into the Rush, in 2005. The success of that album (certified gold in the U.S.) led to two more for Hollywood, including 2007’s Insomniatic, before they left the label. They pursued their acting careers, with Aly starring for five seasons in the now-defunct shot-in-Vancouver series iZombie, while AJ appeared in the ABC sitcom The Goldbergs. During that period they released a single and flirted with a name change (78violet) but it wasn’t until 2017 that Aly and AJ re-emerged with the self-released Ten Years.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“We stayed engaged with our fanbase, and we were in the public eye because of our acting careers,” AJ said, explaining their connection to early admirers.\n\n“I think our fans ended up seeing that we released new music and thought, ‘Wow, I grew up with this material for so many years, it’s my duty to embrace this act again.’ They stuck with us for that long and we can’t thank them enough.”\n\nTheir latest release is another EP, Sanctuary. Released in May, it features eighties-inspired synth-pop tracks like Church (the first single) and Don’t Go Changing, and represents an evolution in the group’s lyrical concerns.\n\n“It was really important to create a body of work that felt different from what we released last year,” AJ said. “So much of what we hear on the radio is about makeups and breakups and everything in between. It was time for us to depart from relationship albums and make something more reflective. The Sanctuary EP has hit a new level of depth with our fans that I think they needed to hear.”\n\n“Ultimately at the end of the day AJ and I just wanted to connect with our fans on a personal level,” Aly said. “Songs like Sanctuary and Church are incredibly personal to us, and I know our fans look at those songs as mini-anthems for themselves. We didn’t want to waiver too far that we had created on Ten Years, but we also knew we wanted to create something different. It wasn’t just, Let’s put out our five favourite songs or five hookiest songs. They were intentional in subject matter as well.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNaturally, their next move is to make another full-length album.\n\nAlyson and Amanda Michalka, a.k.a.
