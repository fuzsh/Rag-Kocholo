        "text": "Rose McGowan is an American actress and director, known for her contribution to independent film. Since the age of nineteen, she has appeared in acclaimed films by Gregg Araki, Wes Craven, Brian De Palma, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. In 2014, her directorial debut Dawn (2014) was nominated for the Short Film Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Rose Arianna McGowan was born on September 5, 1973 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, to American parents Terri and Daniel Patrick McGowan. She is the second eldest of six siblings, and has Irish, French, and English ancestry. As a young child, she was raised within the Italian chapter of the Children of God. During the early 1980s, her family severed ties with the community and migrated to Eugene, Oregon, USA. Following the divorce of her parents, Rose relocated to Gig Harbor, Washington, to live with her grandmother. At age 14, McGowan was accused of drug use by a family friend and committed to rehabilitation. She has consistently maintained the decision was unjustified. Upon release, she spent a year without a home and was emancipated from her parents by the age of 15. McGowan's career as an actor began with Generation der Verdammten (1995). Originally intended for Jordan Ladd, the character of Amy Blue was, coincidentally, awarded to McGowan by an associate of director Gregg Araki. For her performance, she was nominated at the 1995 Independent Spirit Awards for Best Debut Performance. Subsequently cast in Wes Craven's Scream - Schrei! (1996), she experienced further success when the project defied expectations to become one of the highest grossing films of the year. The innovative career of McGowan was overshadowed throughout much of the 1990s by her high-profile relationship with musician Brian Warner (aka Marilyn Manson). Strong performances in Der lange Weg der Leidenschaft (1997), Lewis & Clark & George (1997), Southie (1998) and Der zuckersüße Tod (1999) were largely unseen by the general public. When the relationship ended between Rose and Manson in 2001, she remarked: \"There is great love, but our lifestyle difference is, unfortunately, even greater\". Rose continued to work solidly, appearing in a string of soft-sounding studio and independent films. Performances from this period included: a political activist in Showtime's Killing Yard - Mörderischer Auftrag (2001), a grifter in Strange Hearts (2002) and a factory worker in \"Stealing Bess\" (aka Vacuums (2003)). She was re-introduced to the mainstream as Paige Matthews in Aaron Spelling's Charmed: Zauberhafte Hexen (1998), a popular television series for which she devoted five consecutive years. When \"Charmed\" finished its run in 2006, McGowan emerged in top form. Critics praised her efforts in Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror (2007), and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof - Todsicher (2007). In several interviews, McGowan has expressed a general apathy and disdain for Hollywood. Despite this, her work ethic remains strong. Following her recent marriage to LA-based artist Davey Detail, the actress has resolved to purse further projects as a director.\n\nSince melting audiences' hearts at the age of just six in E.T. - Der Außerirdische (1982), Drew Barrymore has emerged as one of the most beloved and singularly gifted actresses of her generation. Born in Culver City, California to John Drew Barrymore and Jaid Barrymore, the clutches of fame were near inescapable for young Drew, her father being a member of the esteemed showbiz dynasty fronted by stage star Maurice Barrymore, his thespian wife Georgiana and their three children: Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore, and John Barrymore.\n\nTailgating a turbulent adolescence that saw her grapple with insobriety, substance abuse, and cutthroat media vitriol, a diligent Barrymore threw herself into her career throughout the early-mid nineties, first with a succession of 'bad girl' parts in cultish B-pictures like Poison Ivy - Die tödliche Umarmung (1992), Guncrazy - Junge Killer (1992) and - fittingly - Bad Girls (1994); then warmly received turns in prestige vehicles such as Kaffee, Milch & Zucker (1995), Woody Allen's Alle sagen: I love you (1996), and Wes Craven's game-changing Scream - Schrei! (1996). Equal portions of goofball - Eine Hochzeit zum Verlieben (1998), Ungeküsst (1999), 3 Engel für Charlie (2000) - and gravitas - Unterwegs mit Jungs (2001), Donnie Darko (2001), Geständnisse - Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) - came next, with a Golden Globe-grabbing pièce de résistance - her divine incarnation of Edith Bouvier Beale in Die exzentrischen Cousinen der First Lady (2009) - confirming that her skill set was every bit as forceful and far-reaching as imagined.\n\nHaving already set in motion a bunch of lucrative projects via production house Flower Films (co-est. with Nancy Juvonen in '95), Barrymore fastened an additional string to her bow when she spearheaded the sports dramedy Roller Girl (2009), her glowingly appraised directorial debut. Fresh off a healthy run of movie parts at the launch of the 2010s, her star turn as zombified suburban realtor Sheila Hammond - a tour de force at once dizzy and detailed - on Netflix's Santa Clarita Diet (2017) saw her step with trademark resolve into newer territory still: the flourishing world of small screen entertainment, a metamorphosis she continues to espouse with her role as compère of spirited daytime staple The Drew Barrymore Show (2020).\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt was born in Waco, Texas, to Patricia Mae (Shipp), a speech-language pathologist, and Herbert Daniel Hewitt, a medical technician. She has English, Italian, French, Scottish, and German ancestry. She got her first name from her older brother Todd Daniel Hewitt (b. November 8, 1970), who picked the name after a little blonde girl on whom he'd had a crush. Her mother selected Jennifer's middle name, Love (which she goes by offstage), from her best college friend. Her parents separated when she was six months old and her mother raised her in Killeen, Texas.\n\nHewitt made her official performing debut at age 3 when she sang at a livestock show. At age 5, she was taking tap, jazz, and ballet lessons, which led to her joining the Texas Show Team, who toured the Soviet Union and Europe. When she was 10 her family moved to Los Angeles with encouragement from talent scouts, while Todd stayed behind to finish high school in Texas Jennifer quickly found commercial work and a role on Disney's Kids Incorporated (1984) in 1989. She went through a series of television flops before finally hitting it big on Party of Five (1994) in 1995.\n\nAnnaLynne McCord is an American actress, writer, director and former model. Known for playing vixen-type roles. McCord first gained prominence in 2007 as the scheming Eden Lord on the FX television series Nip/Tuck: Schönheit hat ihren Preis (2003), and as the pampered Loren Wakefield on the MyNetworkTV telenovela American Heiress (2007).\n\nIn 2008, she was the second actress to be cast in the CW series 90210 (2008), portraying anti-heroine Naomi Clark. Initially, the part of Clark was conceived as a supporting role. By the end of the first season, however, various media outlets had begun referring to McCord as the series' lead. For the role of Naomi Clark, she was nominated for a Teen Choice Award and received the Hollywood Life Young Hollywood Superstar of Tomorrow award in 2009. In 2010, she won a Breakthrough of the Year Award in the category of \"Breakthrough Standout Performance\".\n\nIn 2011, she was nominated for VH1's \"Do Something\" Award in the category of \"TV Star\". Her turn as a disturbed and delusional teenager in the 2012 film Excision (2012) was widely acclaimed. For her role in Excision, McCord won \"Best Actress\" at the Malaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema in 2012. Also for her role in Excision, she earned second place for \"Best Actress\" at the Fangoria Chainsaw Awards in 2013.\n\nApart from acting, she has also contributed to charities in her free time.\n\nEmmy Award-winning Sarah Michelle Gellar was born on April 14, 1977 in New York City, the daughter of Rosellen (Greenfield), who taught at a nursery school, and Arthur Gellar, who worked in the garment industry. She is of Russian Jewish and Hungarian Jewish descent.\n\nEating in a local restaurant, Sarah was discovered by an agent when she was four years old.

Her breakthrough came with the television series Swans Crossing (1992). In 1997, she became known to the cinema audience when she appeared in two movies: Ich weiß, was du letzten Sommer getan hast (1997) and Scream 2 (1997). But she is most commonly known for her title role in the long-running television series Buffy - Im Bann der Dämonen (1997). She also won an Emmy Award for her performance as Kendall Hart on the soap opera All My Children (1970).\n\nSarah has since starred in many films, including Einfach unwiderstehlich (1999), Eiskalte Engel (1999), and the live-action Scooby-Doo (2002) movies as the lovable Daphne Blake.

They have been married since 2002, and have two children.\n\nWhen the heads of the World Wresting Entertainment (WWE) industry began a search for the sport's next \"Diva\" in 2006, they did not know what they had in store for them. Scouring the United States with camera crews in tow, the WWE set out with the Diva Search competition. Out of 20,000 girls they didn't anticipate a beautiful, French speaking, fashion model to quickly become the sport's femme fatale, earning almost instantaneous one-name fame usually reserved for pop singers. Nobody saw Maryse coming but she's definitely here.\n\nMaryse Ouellet was born January 21st in Montreal, Canada to a well known master chef and a compassionate nurse, but something in her genes destined her to become the planet's toughest beauty.

At age 15 she competed and won a mini marathon beating over 2000 adults and taking the honor of being the youngest winner in the history of the competition. Swimming was another passion, gaining her a position as a lifeguard at an aquatic park while still in high school, but it was then that her focus changed from sports to fashion. Maryse attended Collège Montmorency de Laval obtaining a degree in Business Administration.\n\nMaryse began her modeling career as a beauty pageant contestant, winning Miss Hawaiian Tropic Canada in 2003 and finishing second at the International Finals of Miss Hawaiian Tropic 2004.

Standing at an impressive 5'8\" and holding a black belt in martial arts, the stunning blonde stood out amongst her counterparts. Maryse arrived in Los Angeles to audition for the show with a dream and no understanding of the English language. Although eliminated early in the 2006 Diva Search competition, Maryse left an impression on the producers and they recruited the Montreal native for intensive training in combat sports. Joining dozens of other WWE hopefuls Maryse trained with the best and brightest in the field of entertainment wrestling. In those two years she learned English and perfected her famous finishing moves known as the \"French Kiss\" and the \"French TKO\".
