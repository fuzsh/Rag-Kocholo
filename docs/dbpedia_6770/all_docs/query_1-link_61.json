        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - \"Grace Unplugged,\" a Christian movie movie filmed mostly in Alabama last summer, hits theaters nationwide on Friday, Oct. 4.\n\nTrussville Cinema 16, Patton Creek 15 in Hoover, Summit 16, AmStar Stadium 14 in Alabaster and Lee Branch 15 are among the Birmingham-area theaters showing the movie, which prominently features locations from around the city. Some theaters, including Lee Branch, Patton Creek, Summit, Valley Bend Stadium 18 in Huntsville, AMC Festival Plaza 16 in Montgomery, Hollywood 16 Cinemas in Tuscaloosa and Wynnsong 16 in Mobile will offer special Thursday night showings.\n\n\"Grace Unplugged\" stars former Disney child star A.J. Michalka as the daughter of a worship minister played by James Denton, of \"Desperate Housewives\" fame.\n\nMichalka plays the character Grace Trey, a teen church singer who strikes out on her own to land a record deal in Los Angeles. She cuts off contact with her parents, including her father, a former rock star turned worship leader at a small town Alabama church.\n\n''As soon as I read this, I felt Grace was a part of who I am,'' Michalka said. ''I connected with her immediately when I read the script.''\n\nMichalka, 22, has appeared in the movies ''Secretariat,'' ''Super 8,'' ''The Lovely Bones'' and ''Jesus in Cowboy Boots.'' She sings in the group 78 Violet with her sister, Aly Michalka. The sisters previously performed as Aly and AJ and were featured stars on the Disney Channel. ''We grew up singing in church, leading worship,'' Michalka said.\n\n''That's how I started,'' Michalka said during a break in filming a scene at Liberty Park Baptist Church. ''I feel like I'm back in church.''\n\nDenton, who was a worship leader at a church before he became a professional actor and a star on ''Desperate Housewives,'' plays Johnny Trey. \"AJ's great,\" said Denton. \"She's so talented. I saw her in 'Secretariat.' I knew she could act. But you never know until you go eyeball to eyeball with someone.\"\n\nDenton grew up in Goodlettsville, Tenn., and after college in 1986-87 he was minister of music at Westmoreland United Methodist Church in Westmoreland, Tenn. He later worked at a Christian radio station before going into community theater in Chicago, where he was discovered and became a television actor. Denton said he was raised Southern Baptist and remains a committed Christian. That's why he wanted to be involved in the project, which explores Christian themes and focuses on the father-daughter relationship.\n\nBoth Michalka and Denton sing and play guitar in the movie. \"We all just fell in love with the script,\" Denton said. \"It stands alone without having to be called a Christian movie.\"\n\nWriter-director Brad Silverman said he loved that both Michalka and Denton were real-life church singers. ''It's really exciting when you get art imitating life,'' said Silverman, between takes of scenes shot at WorkPlay last summer.\n\nSilverman and Russ Rice, a producer, previously worked together on another Christian movie, ''No Greater Love.'' The storyline of ''Grace Unplugged'' was inspired by Rice's own life.\n\n''I have a daughter who did this - she ran away from home at 18,'' Rice said. ''We're not preaching in this. We're trying to tell a universal story.''\n\n''To do a film like this for the Lord is something I don't get to do often,'' said Michalka, who brought her beloved poodle, Willow, in a baby stroller to the set.\n\nThe movie was shot in Alabama to take advantage of tax incentives and rebates on filming expenditures established in 2009 when the state adopted the Entertainment Industry Incentive Act.\n\n''The reason we got pushed here was for the tax rebate,'' Rice said. Much of the crew comes from Alabama and Georgia. There's only a handful of crew from LA, Rice said.\n\n''Grace Unplugged' follows a stream of low-budget, high-profit Christian movies including ''Fireproof'' and ''Courageous.''\n\n''It's a growing genre that has found a receptive market,'' said ''Grace Unplugged'' producer Chris Zarpas, former vice president of production for Jeffrey Katzenberg at Disney and former CEO of Scott Free, the production company of directors Ridley Scott (''Gladiator'') and the late Tony Scott (''Top Gun'').\n\nZarpas said ''Grace Unplugged'' was filmed with a budget of less than $2 million and is distributed by Lionsgate.\n\nThe cast includes veteran comedian and character actor Kevin Pollak and Shawnee Smith, who stars in the FX show ''Anger Management'' with Charlie Sheen. The whole cast hit a home run, Rice said.\n\n''AJ's just off the charts,'' Rice said. ''She's a Christian. She's an incredibly talented girl, an incredible actress. James Denton was a worship leader before he broke into acting. He really identified with the part. They've been great to work with.''\n\nMichalka said she enjoyed sharing the stage with Denton playing her father.\n\n''It's a great role for him and for me,'' Michalka said. ''It's the first time I've performed with a male singer. It's always been my sister and I. The songs that have been written for the film have blown me away.''\n\nBoth Michalka and Denton felt comfortable filming scenes in church.\n\n''It was just so cool,'' Michalka said. ''It's so crazy how life comes back full circle.''\n\nOne scene was shot at The Club, with an overview of the city lights of Birmingham doubling as Los Angeles. Another scene was shot at the Alabama Theatre, which required 2,000 extras in the audience. Filming started in mid-August of 2012 in Birmingham and wrapped up on Sept. 7.\n\n''Moviemaking is a business and the goal is to make money,'' said Zarpas. ''This isn't just about that. We're not just selling popcorn. We're sharing the gospel.''\n\n''It's about redemption and reconciliation,'' Rice said.\n\nFor a full list of theaters showing the movie, click here.\n\nFor more news on Christian movies made in Alabama, see:"
