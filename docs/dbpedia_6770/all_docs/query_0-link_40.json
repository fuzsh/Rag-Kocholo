Chris blurs the lines between theater, singing, and dance as skillfully as she plays with the concepts of gender, sexuality, and identity. Influenced by the theatrical pop of David Bowie and Laurie Anderson, as well as the choreography of Michael Jackson. she often combines her atmospheric music with computer-based multimedia presentations. Christines's 2014 debut album, Chaleur Humaine, which explored her turbulent adolescence as a queer woman, announced her as a distinctively vulnerable talent on the strength of the singles \"St. Claude\" and \"Tilted.\" She delved even deeper on 2018's Chris, an examination of gender stereotypes set to '80s R&B sounds that underscored her commitment to making listeners think, feel, and move. Born in Nantes France to a teacher and English professor, Christine grew up in an artistic, literary household and took piano and dance lessons at an early age. Later Christine studied theater at École Normale Supérieure de Lyon (ENS Lyon) and moved to Paris in 2010. Following a bad breakup, Chris created the persona of Christine and embarked on a music career, taking the Christine and the Queens moniker as an homage to the drag queens who danced with her while she performed. She released her debut EP, Miséricorde, in 2011, and followed it with 2012's Mac Abbey. That year, Christine and the Queens' dynamic stage shows won the Best Discovered Act award at Le Printemps de Bourges festival and the Premières Francos award at another festival, Les Francofolies de La Rochelle. With 2013's Nuit 17 a 52 EP, Letissier made her debut on the French albums chart SNEP. In 2014, Letissier delivered Christind and the Queens' debut full-length album, Chaleur Humaine, a set of songs inspired by her teenage years that featured the single \"Saint Claude.\" Early in 2015, Letissier won the Victoires de la Musique for 2014's Best Female Artist; later that year, Chaleur Humaine was reissued on Atlantic in the United States as Christine and the Queens, and featured the English-language single \"Tilted.\" The album was also reissued as a deluxe edition in the U.K. in 2016, a year that saw Christine and the Queens cover Beyonce's \"Sorry\" and the BBC choose Letissier as one of its 100 Women of the Year.Letissier wrote and produced the project's second album, Chris, a set of songs that incorporated tougher, '80s funk and R&B influences and lyrics that questioned traditional gender roles. Featuring the Dam-Funk collaboration \"Girlfriend,\" the album arrived in French and English versions in September 2018.\n\nJohn Mayer - New Light (Premium Content!)\n\n​\n\nAh ah ah\n\nAh\n\nI'm the boy in your other phone\n\nLighting up inside your drawer at home all alone\n\nPushing 40 in the friend zone\n\nWe talk and then you walk away every day\n\nOh, you don't think twice 'bout me\n\nAnd maybe you're right to doubt me, but\n\nBut if you give me just one night\n\nYou're gonna see me in a new light\n\nYeah, if you give me just one night\n\nTo meet you underneath the moonlight\n\nOh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough\n\nI wanna know the real thing about you\n\nSo I can see you in a new light\n\nTake a ride up to Malibu\n\nI just wanna stay to look at you, look at you\n\nWhat would it matter if your friends knew?\n\nWho cares what other people say anyway\n\nOh, we can go far from the end\n\nAnd make a new world together baby\n\n'Cause if you give me just one night\n\nYou're gonna see me in a new light\n\nYeah, if you give me just one night\n\nTo meet you underneath the moonlight\n\nOh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough\n\nI wanna know the real thing about you\n\nSo I can see you in a new light\n\nAy, ay\n\nAy, ay\n\nAy, ay\n\nAy, ay\n\nAy, ay\n\nAy, ay\n\nAy, ay\n\nAh ah ah ah ah\n\nYeah, if you give me just one night\n\nYou gonna see me in a new light\n\nYeah, if you give me just one night\n\nTo meet you underneath the moonlight\n\nWhat do I do with all this?\n\nWhat do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you\n\nWhat do I do with all this?\n\nWhat do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you\n\nWhat do I do with all this?\n\nWhat do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you\n\nWhat do I do with all this?\n\nWhat do I do with all this, oh yeah\n\nSource: LyricFind\n\nSongwriters: Charlotte Day Wilson / Ernest Dion Wilson / John Clayton Mayer / Matthew Adam Tavares\n\nNew Light lyrics © BMG Rights Management, Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd., Reach Music Publishing\n\nJohn Clayton Mayer is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. Famous for his special skills in guitar and his artistic pursuit for classy pop-rock songs, he has earned major chart success in the US and other countries. Known for both his solo career and his career with the ‘John Mayer Trio’ group, the knowledgeable musician has millions of fans across the globe. He picked up a guitar at the age of 13 and took lessons for two years. Then through his strong perseverance and determination, he started a career in music. His big break came when he performed at the ‘2000 South by Southwest Music Festival’ in Austin following which Aware Records signed him . The winner of seven Grammy Awards, he at times changed his musical styles and became successful across genres, establishing himself in contemporary rock and broadening his scope to incorporate the blues. TIME applauded him for his “vigorous voice texture, and emotional fearlessness”. Most of his albums are commercially successful and have been accredited multi-platinum.\n\nJohn Clayton Mayer was born on October 16, 1977 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He grew up in Fairfield. His father Richard was a high school principal, and his mother Margaret Mayer was a middle school English teacher.

Fox's guitar performance in a movie, and he fell in love with blues music after he heard a Stevie Ray Vaughan cassette.\n\nWhen he was 13, his father rented a guitar for him. He started taking lessons, and got so engrossed in it that his concerned parents took him to a psychiatrist, who declared him healthy.

Inc.\n\n\"Flames\" is a song by French DJ and record producer David Guetta and Australian singer-songwriter Sia. The song was released on 22 March 2018 by What a Music, as the third single from Guetta's seventh studio album, 7 (2018). It was written by Sia Furler, Guetta, Christopher Braide, Giorgio Tuinfort and Marcus van Wattum, with production handled by the latter three. The song became the seventh collaboration between Guetta and Sia after the pair have previously collaborated on the tracks \"Titanium\", \"She Wolf (Falling to Pieces)\", \"Wild One Two\", \"Bang My Head\", \"The Whisperer\" and \"Helium\". In a press release, Guetta opened up about the pair's history and his excitement at the prospect of getting back in the studio with her. \"'Titanium' is still one of the tracks I am proudest of and Sia is one of my favorite artists to work with. She's a great songwriter and has an amazing voice. I'm just super excited that we get to release another track together.\" At the ARIA Music Awards of 2018, \"Flames\" earned Sia a nomination for Best Female Artist. The song is performed in the key of F minor with a tempo of 94 beats per minute in common time. The chorus of the song follows a progression of Cm–E♭–Fm–D♭, and Sia's vocals span from B♭3 to C5. A lyric video for \"Flames\" was released on 22 March 2018. It was directed by Joe Rubinstein. The official music video for \"Flames\" was released on 5 April 2018 on Guetta's YouTube channel. The video emulates 1970s wuxia films and features three women (Lauren Mary Kim, Courtney Chen and Erin Wu) training with their martial arts master (Danny Trejo). The training includes chopping a block of wood, balancing wooden buckets, and catching a fly with chopsticks, but suddenly they are ambushed by a group of ninjas, and the master allows himself to be killed. The three are then captured and taken to the palace, where they encounter the emperor (Guetta). Then the three break free and fight all the ninjas, but the emperor defeats them by throwing fireballs. The master then reappears in ghostly form, and encourages them to fight back. Eventually, the three defeat the emperor by forcing his fire-casting hands down to his crotch hence burning him to the ground in a rather painful way, ending with the master watching them from above happily. The video was directed by Lior Molcho. The song was well received by music critics. Roisin O'Connor of The Independent said: \"The track is classic Sia, starring her incredible voice and a big, emotive chorus; it's an uplifting, low-key banger that shows off the maturity Sia has brought to previous Guetta tracks, along with his talent for an infectious beat.\" Dean Chalkley of edm.com said: \"Once again, Guetta showcases his skills in providing a massive pop-house hybrid ready to take over the radio stations all over the world, offering a perfect foundation to Sia's distinctly powerful and unique voice. With a bit slower tempo, a new pop ballad is just what one could expect from the duo.\" Mike Nied from Idolator called it \"an inspiring anthem complete with a rousing production and another of the 'Chandelier' siren's jaw-dropping vocal lines.\" Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone described the song as \"uplifting\": \"On the song, Guetta goes for a less clubby sound than usual. The song is more earnest as Sia offers words of encouragement to a loved one weathering a tough time.\"\n\nNiall Horan - On The Loose (Official) -\n\n​\n\nI know what she's like\n\nShe's out of her mind\n\nAnd wraps herself around the truth\n\nShe'll jump on that flight and meet you that night\n\nAnd make you tear up the room\n\nYeah, she loves when everybody's watching\n\nShe knows the way her body moves\n\nShe loves the way they all crawl back when she says\n\nThat she loves nobody else but you\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming)\n\nShe's coming for you\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)\n\nShe'll dance in the dark\n\nA real work of art\n\nHer eyes could burn down the room\n\nSo get out while you can\n\nYou don't understand\n\nShe doesn't know how to lose\n\nYeah, she loves when everybody's watching\n\nShe knows the way her body moves\n\nShe loves the way they all crawl back when she says\n\nThat she loves nobody else but you\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming)\n\nShe's coming for you\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)\n\nShe'll run with your mind and pull you in tight\n\nThen trade you in for something new\n\nI know what it's like, I fell for it twice\n\nAnd now I'm just warning you\n\nShe loves when everybody's watching\n\nShe knows the way her body moves\n\nShe loves the way they all crawl back when she says\n\nThat she loves nobody else but you\n\nShe loves when everybody's watching\n\nShe knows the way her body moves\n\nShe loves the way they all crawl back when she says\n\nThat she loves nobody else but you\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming)\n\nShe's coming for you\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)\n\nShe's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nSource: LyricFind\n\nSongwriters: John Ryan / Julian C Bunetta / Niall James Horan\n\nOn The Loose lyrics © Downtown Music Publishing, Peermusic Publishing, BMG Rights Management, Words & Music A Div Of Big Deal Music LLC\n\nNiall James Horan born 13 September 1993) is an Irish singer and songwriter. He rose to prominence as a member of the band 'One Direction'. In 2010, Horan auditioned as a solo contestant for British singing competition 'The X Factor'. After being eliminated as solo performers, Niall, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, and Harry Styles were put together in a band. Following the band's hiatus in 2016, Horan signed a recording deal as a solo artist with Capitol Records. His singles \"This Town\" and \"Slow Hands\" from his debut studio album 'Flicker' (2017) reached the top 20 in several countries. The album debuted at number one in Ireland and the United States, as well as charting within the top three in Australia and the UK. He embarked on the 'Flicker Sessions tour' (2017) and the Flicker World Tour (2018) to support the album. Niall James Horan was born on 13 September 1993 in Mullingar, Ireland. He has an older brother, Greg Horan. His parents, Bobby Horan and Maura Gallagher, divorced when he was five years old, so he and his brother, Greg, lived with their mother for a year. After spending a year apart from their father, they later decided to move in with him. He had asthma as a child. He attended St. Kenny's National School, a primary school, and Colaiste Mhuire, a Catholic boys school, which are both located in Mullingar. Horan tried to play the guitar that his brother got for Christmas, but was not able to play it. Horan, then aged 11, taught himself how to play the guitar by following YouTube tutorials. His aunt discovered his talent one day when she was in the car with Niall as he started singing. She originally thought the radio was on. As a teenager, he performed at the Mullingar Arts Centre during a fund-raiser for the local football team, the Shamrocks. He was also bagging a support slot with former X Factor contestant Lloyd Daniels at the Academy club in Dublin. Horan's solo debut album was described as being on the \"folkier side of pop\", incorporating elements of folk music as well as pop, rock, and country music. In an interview with Digital Spy, Horan cited 'Michael Buble as one of his biggest influences because they had similar life histories, as he was discovered by his aunt and the same thing happened to Bublé, except he was discovered by his father. Horan enjoyed playing a number of sports while growing up, including golf, football, and Gaelic football. In the summer of 2010, while playing football with friends, he injured his knee and was diagnosed with a floating kneecap. The problem recurred several times over the next couple of years, including a 2013 incident where he dislocated his knee onstage during a concert in Antwerp, Belgium. Horan went to the United States for major reconstructive surgery in January 2014, after the tour ended. After the surgery, he was invited to do physical therapy with Chelsea by their manager, Jose Mourinho. Horan went through more than seven weeks of physical therapy with the members of the team and their physical therapist at their training ground in Surrey. Horan is a supporter of Football League Championship side Derby County. In 2016, Horan was actively involved with the Drive, Chip, and Putt initiative that encourages and supports children golfers. Horan also helped promote the Northern Ireland Open. In April 2018, Horan opened up on his diagnosis of mild OCD and his anxiety. As a former member of One Direction, Horan was involved in the Action 1D campaign that \"aims to end extreme poverty, tackle inequality and slow down climate change with the help of their millions of fans\". The band also supported Comic Relief.\n\nThree hundred million year old volcanoes have been discovered under the midlands. A low flying aircraft using the latest mapping technology has uncovered the 330 million-year-old rock formations on the Westmeath/Offaly border south of Mullingar. The discoveries were made in the latest part of the Government’s Tellus programme. Flying at 90metres, aircraft use technology to see through Ireland’s deep glacial deposits and extensive peat cover. Researchers said the sites will be of interest to companies on the look out for mineral deposits. Ray Scanlon, principal geologist at the Geological Survey of Ireland, said: “Tellus continues to reveal extraordinary new detail in Ireland’s geological landscape buried beneath our feet, building upon existing data gaps and developing natural resource opportunities. “An understanding of Ireland’s geology is vital for environmental, health and economic reasons and the data will be welcomed by a broad range of stakeholders for agricultural, radon prevention, groundwater protection and mineral exploration purposes.” Tellus aims to complete a geological jigsaw of the island of Ireland and hopes to have half the country covered by the end of 2017.\n\nOne Direction star Niall Horan will never have to pay for a round of golf in his native Mullingar again after he was made an honourary lifetime member of his hometown club. As he picked up the award in front of a packed Mullingar Golf Club on Saturday night, Niall joked that pal Rory McIlroy would be jealous of the honour, as he is a big fan of the parkland course. Niall said he and McIlroy were playing a round of golf in Australia a few weeks ago when they found themselves reminiscing about the Mullingar parkland course, remembering particular holes and obstacles on them. \"We were joking as to who could hit a shot over the big trees on the tenth hole,\" Niall told members of the club as he picked up his lifetime free pass. \"He was picking out trees on the tenth that he likes to play over and I was thinking to myself 'Holy God, this is a good golf club'\". Horan said he and McIlroy were in agreement that Mullingar was one of the finest courses they have played, but McIlroy will have to pay next time he's in Westmeath, something that Horan laughed about on Saturday. \"I said to him the other day that you don't have this and you're the best golfer in the world!\" When Niall joined the club aged 12 he paid a Junior Sub, and the 21 year old singing star has been happy to pay green fees every time he has played in recent years. Indeed, earlier this year, between Croke Park shows, big-hearted Niall hosted a pro-am classic which raised thousands for local charities. Mullingar is home to the Scratch Cup, the top Irish tournament for amateurs which McIlroy won in 2006 having been beaten in a play off the year before. Other golfers to have won the Scratch Cup included Darren Clarke, Des Smyth, Philip Walton, Paul McGinley, Shane Lowry and Padraig Harrington, who is also an honourary member along with local GUI official Albert Lee, one of the men man who discovered McIlroy all those years ago. Bestowing the honour upon Niall Horan was Club Captain Michael Duffy and Lady Captain Una Stephens. Noting how Horan started off in Mullingar as a junior golfer in 2006 on a handicap of 80 they said he would currently be ranked as one of the best players in the country, having gotten himself down to a handicap of 11. Niall has been out an about in Mullingar throughout the Christmas and was spotted in Finns Bar and Joe Dolan's nightclub 'Mojos'. The singer's mother Maura Gallagher and father Bobby Horan were with him as he received the honour at the golf club.\n\nImage Above - Belvedere House and Gardens -\n\nInteresting facts about Mullinger Ireland.\n\nMullingar is home to some outstanding sporting stadiums.

They started in 2004 and are still active today. They were under the Hollywood Records label until they left the label in 2010. In 2009, Aly & AJ renamed themselves 78violet and officially announced their departure from Hollywood Records the following year. In 2013, the sisters released their first single in five years, \"Hothouse\". The duo had planned to release a full-length album in 2014, which was later leaked onto the internet during summer 2014. On December 9, 2015, the duo announced they had decided to return to their original name, Aly & AJ. In August 2017, they released the single \"Take Me\" as the lead single from their EP, Ten Years. On March 29, 2019, the pair released the single \"Church\" as the lead single from their EP Sanctuary, which was released on May 10, 2019. On June 26, 2008, an Ohio man named Rex Mettler was arrested for stalking the duo. The Lancaster man \"obtained contact information for the acting and singing duo and made threats online, by phone and handwritten notes\" as stated by the police. The duo was scheduled to perform in Cincinnati on June 27, 2008, where the man was present, after which the police could not confirm that any of the threats involved the Ohio show. The police later stated that \"the charge against Mettler stems from incidents that began December 15, 2007\" and that \"Rex displayed a pattern of activity over that time that reflected multiple attempts, if not numerous attempts, at stalking these females.\" Two years later, on June 17, 2010, Caesar Brantley was arrested on suspicion of stalking the duo. He pleaded not guilty. Aly claimed Brantley is an \"obsessed fan\" who is determined to marry her \"no matter what\" in filings for the restraining order.Another court hearing was scheduled on June 30th. Aly & AJ, who are both very open about their faith, were significant in the Christian music rock scene. \"Never Far Behind\" was only released on Christian rock radio. It went to No.1 on Radio & Records (R&R) Christian CHR. The duo does not wish to be labeled as Christian music artists. In an interview with Blender magazine in June 2006, Aly & AJ said that their music comes from a Christian perspective. \"We don't ever wanna preach or shove anything down people's throats, but we want our music to be inspiring.\" AJ added, \"If we have a Muslim fan or an atheist fan, that's their thing – I'm gonna love them no matter what.\" In a 2006 interview with Blender magazine, the two expressed their disbelief in evolution. In 2018, Aly & AJ stated in an interview with AWAL that they do believe in evolution. The pair later reiterated their pro-evolution-theory stance in response to a fan on Twitter, writing: \"Yes to evolution...thank God for the glow up in not just body but mind\".\n\nMain Tours\n\n2005: Mini Mall Tour\n\n2006: Living Room Tour\n\n2006: Holiday Season Tour\n\n2007: Nextfest Summer Tour (Co-headlining with Corbin Bleu, Drake Bell and Bianca Ryan.\n\n2008: Insomniatic Tour\n\n2008: Mini Summer Tour\n\n2018: Promises Tour\n\n2019: Sanctuary Tour\n\nStudio Albums\n\nInto the Rush - 2005\n\nAcoustic Hearts of Winter - 2006\n\nInsomniatic - 2007\n\nSamantha Fox - 'Hot Boy' Official Video\n\nDid you think you could keep your cool\n\nOn a night like this\n\nCan't you feel the fever, in the air\n\nHear my voice callin' out for you\n\nAnd you can't resist\n\nWhen you taste the passion we could share\n\nCause you know\n\nOne touch from you could make sparks fly\n\nI've got a secret that I can't hide\n\nHold on baby and you will see\n\nHotHot for you\n\nOoh, you got me burnin' up\n\nHotHot for you\n\nFeel my body turnin' so\n\nHotHot for you\n\nCome and get it while it's hot\n\nYou should know not to stand too close\n\nWhen you play with fire\n\nBoy, I got a hunger you can't tame\n\nTell me now will you let your love\n\nCool my desire\n\nBefore it all goes up in flames\n\ncause you know\n\nhotHot for you\n\nOoh, you got me burnin' up\n\nHothot for you\n\nFeel my body turnin' so\n\nHotHot for you\n\nI never get enough\n\nSource: LyricFind\n\nSongwriters: Eric S.

They first hit the charts as the featured singer on the 2012 Disclosure song \"Latch,\" and released their first single, \"Lay Me Down,\" soon after. In 2014, Smith released In the Lonely Hour, their heartfelt debut full-length album. It contained the smash hit \"Stay With Me,\" a radio staple over the course of the entire year. For their work on In the Lonely Hour, Smith was awarded four Grammys, among them Song of the Year and Record of the Year. In 2019, Smith announced that they prefer to use non-binary pronouns. Smith was born on May 19, 1992, in London. A natural singer, Smith began performing as a child, but the first real press they got came in 2009, when their mother, a successful banker, was fired after allegedly promoting her 15-year-old son’s singing career while on company time. Smith had only recorded two songs at that point and it would be a few years before they left their mark on the musical world. Throughout their teenage years, Smith studied music while hitting the books at St. Mary's Catholic School in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire. They looked for inspiration in such soulful artists as Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder while keeping a close eye on their future in the music business. Smith’s first moment in the spotlight would come when the dance/electronica duo Disclosure released its 2012 song “Latch,” to which Smith lent their vocals. The track featured the singer’s melodic falsetto over Disclosure’s electronic beat. \"Latch,\" featuring a stripped-down sound that made the listener take notice of Smith’s vocal work, resonated in a big way with music fans and critics alike and laid the groundwork for their future success in the UK and beyond. \"Latch\" reached the top of the UK singles chart when Smith was just 21, and they soon released their own single, “Lay Me Down.”\n\nSmith’s next hit was again via a featured role on another artist’s song: Naughty Boy’s Bollywood-inspired \"La La La.\" With Smith's lead vocal, the song became an instant No. 1 single in the UK in the spring of 2013. In the fall, Smith released their first EP, Nirvana, on which listeners were treated to an acoustic version of \"Latch.\" A few months later, in February 2014, Smith was again at the top of the UK singles chart with \"Money on My Mind,\" and in May 2014, their full-length debut, In the Lonely Hour, was released in the UK. The same month that In the Lonely Hour was released, Smith told the world they were gay. They also revealed that despite the album being full of love songs, they've never experienced it firsthand. “I've never been in a relationship before,” they said to the magazine Fader. “In the Lonely Hour is about a guy that I fell in love with last year, and he didn't love me back. ... I was in a very dark place.”\n\nThat dark place has taken Smith to some very exciting, rewarding arenas. At the 2015 Grammy Awards, Smith and their record took four awards: Best New Artist, Best Pop Vocal Album, Record of the Year and Song of the Year (“Stay With Me”). \"Before I made this record I was doing everything to try and get my music heard,\" Smith said during one of his four acceptance speeches. \"It was only until I started to be myself that the music started to flow and people started to listen.\" Smith continued to keep busy in 2015, releasing a re-recorded version of \"Lay Me Down\" as a duet with soul singer/songwriter John Legend. The track went to No. 1 on the UK pop charts while raising money for the charity initiative Comic Relief. Smith then contributed lead vocals on the sleek \"Omen,\" one of the first singles from Disclosure's sophomore album, Caracal. Smith has since joined the James Bond canon of movie vocalists with his orchestral single \"Writing's on the Wall\" for Spectre. Co-written with Jimmy Napes, the song became a No. 1 single in the UK. \"Wall\" received both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award in 2016, with Smith dedicating his Oscar win to LGBT communities across the globe. In September 2017, Smith released the first track, \"Too Good at Goodbyes,\" from their sophomore album The Thrill of It all. Three more singles followed from the album, which hit No. 1 in the UK and U.S. Smith enjoyed more commercial success via their collaborations with Calvin Harris on \"Promises\" and with Normani on \"Dancing with a Stranger,\" before resuming solo work for the summer 2019 release of \"How Do You Sleep?\" In 2019, Smith announced that they were going to begin using the non-gender, non-binary pronouns they/them. \"After a lifetime of being at war with my gender I’ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out. I’m so excited and privileged to be surrounded by people that support me in this decision but I’ve been very nervous about announcing this because I care too much about what people think,\" they wrote on Instagram.\n\nMaroon 5 - What Lovers Do ft.
