        "text": "Have you ever had one of those times were you watching a movie/TV show and you liked it but couldn’t stand the characters in it? Well on YouTube, I took a trip down memory lane and watched a few cartoons from the late 1990s/early 2000s. I laughed, I was sad, I sat stone faced when I got the adult jokes that I didn’t get when I was younger. Some episodes annoyed me by how some of the characters were acting. I wish I could go back up in time and slap the writers across their pasty faces.\n\nHere in no particular order is a top three list of cartoon characters that have always annoyed me.\n\n1. Dodie Bishop from As Told By Ginger.\n\nDodie was a complete social climbing, selfish wench, who at many times expected Ginger to stand by her even if she was wrong gave horrible advice, In the episode Next Question, she convinced Ginger that their teacher had a crush on her, and is a complete carbon copy of her mother. If you see any episode of As Told by Ginger, more specifically the episode, Lunatic Lake, you’ll know where Doodie gets this behavior from.\n\n2. Arnold from Hey Arnold\n\nOk, I know Arnold is the protagonist of the show and gives all this great advice to his classmates and is so kind and nice to others, but being kind, smart and caring gets old pretty fast. I thought the protagonist was supposed to undergo some kind of change. Yes Arnold and his friends had their whole arguments but learned a lesson at the end of the day, yet he was usually the one to serve as the peacemaker. Please tell me how someone could be that nice and optimistic all the time when he never knew what happened to his parents, his grandma has dementia and a girl in a pink bow and dress emasculates him on a regular basis.\n\n3. DJonay Jones from The Proud Family.\n\nAs a child, I enjoyed the Proud Family. There won’t and still aren’t a lot of children’s television that has the main character being African-American. Looking back at the show, I realized that the show had a cast of characters that played off of racial stereotypes, the smart Asians, the exotic Hispanic girl that\n\nAll the guys liked and the African-American boy that has dreams of becoming a rapper and is always trying to earn quick money. D’joney was the worst portrayal of African-American girls in the media I’ve ever seen. Greasy lips, pudgy, loud and obnoxious to be blunter she was just ghetto with her blonde hair and pack of brothers and sisters. I’m still left wondering why Penny would stay friends with her, when the going gets tough, she would ditch Penny in a minute. >\n\nNow I’m not saying you shouldn’t watch these shows. They have great storylines and are very entertaining, but just be prepared with a stress ball when some particular episodes come on.\n\nI’M not an expert on trends and what is currently in right now. But walking through the halls in school, I’ve noticed that many girls have been sporting plaid shirts, vans, and combat boots. Keep this in mind, these are the types of girls that have Vera Bradley backpacks, wear Daisy Duke Shorts and have $85 Victoria’s Secret’s Pink glitter hoodies. Now I’m all for changing up your style and experimenting with different pieces, but it’s a bit off putting to me when I see a gaggle of sophomore girls talking about how hyped they are about next year’s basketball season (Go Leopards… yet they didn’t even make it to states or the championship game) in their combat boots with ruffles and their Nirvana crop tops. After praising the basketball players for being the shallow and arrogant jerks that they are, they begin to asset each other’s outfits.\n\nGirl 1# Where did you get that shirt? I want to get a tee with just a picture of the leader singer of Nevera on it and a pair of fishnets.\n\nGirl 2# Hot topic. I’m going to the mall again next week to get more shirts cuz Nevera is like my favorite band now.\n\nMe:- Face palm-\n\nMy advice is if you are going to take on a subculture like Indie/Hipster, Hip-Hop, or Punk at least dress like you’re not trying too hard and PLEASE BE ABLE TO PRONUNCE THE BAND YOU HAVE ON SHIRT CORRECTLY!\n\nA prime example of doing the grunge look justice is taking a cue from television shows, movies, and of course rock music back in the 90s. The 1990s/ late 1980s were after all, when grunge bands became mainstream in music.\n\nSo here is a guide to how to look grunge.\n\nTip 1: The thrift store is your best friend. Look for oversized flannels, jean jacket, blue jeans, and worn out boots. Flannels are very versatile, you can style them with a pair of shorts, a mini dress or just a band t-shirt. There are endless possibilities for a jean jacket. For guys, you can cut the sleeves and make it a vest and wear it over a hoodie. For girls, you can add patches and rub sandpaper on it or spilling a little bit of bleach on it to give it the distressed look. With jeans try picking a cut that is baggy on you and cut a hole through the one of the knees. Just because grunge is highly associated with combat boots, doesn’t mean that has to be the consistency of your wardrobe, Doc Martens and Converse look great with flannels or tights. Just make sure when picking a shoe, they don’t look straight out of the box, brand new but not beat up and worn out till the point where you are duck taping them.\n\nTip 2: Layer your clothes. I guess this could go with tip 1 but try layering band tees (you can find loads of those at flea markets , the salvation army and Rockabillia.com if you’re not into wearing pre-worn clothes) on top of long sleeve shirts, the ones with dark stripes on the sleeve look good. The same goes with shorts, stick with denim shorts paired with ripped tights. No fishnets or colored leggings, you want to look edgy not like you’re going trick or treating.\n\nTip 3: Don’t do much with your hair. Try not to brush it as much. It’ll give you that just woke up out of bed but effortlessly chic look.\n\nTip 4: I know it may be tempting to put on five pounds of eyeliner, but to get the rocker look, try just having a layer or two of mascara and eyeliner and occasionally a coat of red or dark lipstick. If you are feeling brave, sleeping in you makeup will give it a more natural smeared look. Remember less is better since grunge is about looking lazy and natural.\n\nTip 5: If you are going to dress the part, brush up on your taste in music. Listen to bands like, The Stranglers, Deluxx Folk Implosion, Peal Jam, and of course Nirvana.\n\nThis may seem overwhelming. You may be thinking um.. I don’t want to be a part of the Grunge subculture, I just want a few edgier pieces of clothing that are grungy looking. No problem here is a few staple pieces to add a bit of kick to any mall rat’s wardrobe.\n\nthere were a lot of hits and misses when it came to fashion. One frequent fashion staple was made out of denim, could be worn with any type of shirt, ranging from flannels to button ups and could also serve as proper attire for farming/agricultural work. You guess it. They’re overalls.\n\nSome stars that rocked overalls were Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bell Air. Will, a street smart teen from West Philadelphia gave overalls a colorful and urban look. He usually had light bleach washed overalls with one strap unbuckled and a printed button up shirt paired with his signature fade haircut and a pair of sneakers.\n\nThe Olsen twins, most famously known for their roles of Michelle Tanner from Full House, gave overalls a cute and playful look with patches of flowers and insects sewn on and completely their look with scrunchies and white sneakers that look like they have never stepped foot outside. It kind of reminds me when I was a little tyke back in 1998/99 when not only have I had pink overalls but I had matching pink barrettes and pink and white Barbie shoes.\n\nPersonally, I’m not sure that I could pull off the trend but I think it works well when paired with the right pieces. If you want to get into the overall trend that is coming back, here are a few links below of stores that you can find them at.http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=25682154\n\nSo for the overall verdict, I believe overalls have become a hit not only in the 90s but are coming becoming a bigger hit today.\n\nDuring the 90s,\n\nI can’t go a week without my friends bombarding about the crazy dreams they had last night. I of course pretend to listen by doing the usual routine of nodding my head and saying really and aha between pauses. But when I’m drifting off and questioning the choices I’ve made in life, thinking about how to loose twenty pounds, yet thinking about my favorite foods, I get slapped in the face with jealousy. Why can’t I have semi interesting dreams? I want to have a dream where I’m being carried off by whales to explore the lost city of Atlantis. I want to have one of those dreams where I wake up at 3 am screaming because I was a baby bird and a hawk took me away from my nest and was just about to swallow me whole. Anything would be better than just darkness and waking up with a stiff neck.\n\nTo make up for the absence of dreams and to add some fantasy to my life, I will be creating a micro fiction series about three kids from 1994 who are part of the Alius society, which is a special society for people with supernatural powers. The main characters are Michael who is fifteen years old but is only 4’11 and has telekinetic powers, which comes useful when fighting off bullies but dangerous since no one must know about the Alius society in fear of capture, rejection, or harm from the normal human world. There is Sarah Lauren who is 17 and unlike Michael stands at 6’2 who is very shy and bullied at school for her squeaky voice and frumpy clothes and has the ability to bend the elements. The last character is Pedro who is 15 and is an illegal immigrant from Mexico and was in the Mexican Alius society. He is able to read minds and understand any language, including communication with animals. All three teens are misfits at school and also at home since they must hide their powers from their parents.\n\nI’m not much of a fiction writer especially a fantasy fiction writer, comments about what you think so far about the premise would be greatly appreciated. I’ll be posting the first draft on Teen Ink which I will link below and more details about the story on Good Reads, which will also be linked below. And yes there will be 90s references.\n\nSometimes I wonder what would happen if cartoon characters were real. What would their occupations be in the real world? Who would they be friends with? What would they be like as adults? Here is a list of celebrities that at least in my mind resemble cartoon characters from the 90s/early 2000s.\n\nChina Anne McClain as Penny Proud from The Proud Family. China Anne McClain known for Tyler Perry’s TV show House of Payne and the move Daddy’s Little Girl’s would be perfect for the role of as the confident and head strong protagonist with an over protective father and questionable friends. Not only does China Anne McClain’s character on House of Payne has similar traits to Penny from the Proud Family, being that they are both intelligent and are outspoken, but with some pig tails and a burgundy sweater, she would bare an uncanny resemble to Penny Proud.\n\nAmanda Michalka as Clover from Totally Spies. Amanda Michalka known for being a Disney channel starlet, her most well-known works is being a member of the pop rock duo Aly and Aj aka 78 violet and the Disney Channel original movie Cow bells. Playing the role of Clover from Totally Spies would not only help Amanda step out of the shadow of her older sister Aly Michalka, it could really jump start her career. I mean who wouldn’t want to see a Beverly Hills blond living a lavish lifestyle by day and fighting super villains and saving the world in a tight orange jumpsuit and pumps.\n\nMichael Cera as Doug from Doug. If I had to describe Michael Cera in one word, it would have to be awkward. Just look at his filmography. In Juno he played Paulie Bleeker who sleeps in a race car bed, wears short yellow shorts with the matching just as bright sweatband and somehow manages to get a girl pregnant. In Super bad, his character Evan, never even had a girlfriend and was determined to lose his virginity before he goes off to college. In the end, his goals are not exactly accomplished. To make things short, Fogell aka McLovin had more game than him. Both Doug and Michael Cera have very little luck with the ladies and it doesn’t help that Michael Cera goes around saying “wizard” and just being all quirky with his skinny self. And look at Doug, chasing Patty Mayonnaise and was the male version of Ginger from As Told By Ginger, always writing in his diary. To top things off his superhero costume was him wearing his undies on the outside of his shorts and a belt tied on his head.\n\nA few weekends ago I suffered a horrible lost that cost me almost two hours of my life and a few brain cells. My mother dragged me to see Tyler Perry’s Temptation. The movie was basically like all his other movies and TV shows; him preaching about how African-American people should live their lives in order to be good “Christians.” That means 1. You must live in a small southern town and be having a religious and protective mother that makes you go to church more than once a week. Apparently bigger and more metropolitan cities are filled with the devil and his minions while small southern towns are very wholesome and just the bees knees. 2. No and absolutely No premarital sex. Ok I can see his point here I think that is a great tool to not only prevent teenage pregnancy but to decrease the spread of STDs and HIV. But what Mr. Perry fails to recognize is that its 2013 and in our society more and more young people are becoming sexually active. (There was a girl at my school who had a baby at 12) My point is that he shouldn’t be looking down on people who don’t practice abstinence but he should just be stressing the use of protection. 3. All men are dogs. Either they are A.) Abusers or.) B) Homosexuals.\n\nYou would Tyler Perry being a man; an African-American man to be exact would not portray African-American men in a bad light.\n\nSorry that I went on a bit of a rant. How does Tyler Perry even relate to the 90s you’re probably wondering by now if you’re still reading? (I won’t be mad if you stopped and got bored. I could rant on Tyler Perry till my fingers are bruised and numb.) A character seen in the majority of his films is Madea. If you don’t know who Madea is, she is this overweight grandma and ex-stripper who totes a gun has been to jail many times and smokes weed. It seems like Tyler Perry modeled Madea after the character Sugar Momma from The Proud Family. Both women are not afraid to fight, are sassy, and sometimes serve as the voice of reason. People say copying someone is the best form of flattery. Obviously Tyler Perry didn’t do it well since although Sugar Momma is very tough, she loves her family. If Madea was an actual real person no one would take her seriously since really who takes someone seriously when they smokes weed and is always in jail. I think the term respect for your elders goes a bit too far in his movies and films.\n\nOne of my favorite TV shows back in the 90s/early 2000s was Hey Arnold. Hey Arnold is about the adventures of a football- headed fourth grader who lives in a boarding school with his grandparents and diverse and eccentric boarders. My absolute favorite character from the show is Helga Pataki. Helga is a bossy and tough tomboy who had a unibrow and wore her trademark pink dress and bow and who had a love hate relationship with Arnold. Although the creators intended for Arnold to be the protagonist of the show, I thought Helga was more of a protagonist. Here we have this angry young girl who bullies her classmates and bosses her only friend around to the point where she is like a slave (Season 4 Phoebe Breaks a Leg) but when she goes home every day after school, she is ignored by her father who is this successful beeper salesman who can’t even remember her name and usually refers to her as Olga, which is Helga’s older sister who gets all the attention and is deemed to be “perfect.” Helga also has an alcoholic mother, (something I didn’t realize when I was younger) who sleeps all day and can hardly talk in coherent sentences because she is too doped up on anti-depressants. (another fact I didn’t know until I looked back and watch the re runs.) So it pretty much explains why Helga is so harsh and mean to others. But she isn’t your average schoolyard, in many episodes she is seen interacting and playing sports with her fellow classmates , has a very high intelligence level (In the episode the Aptitude Test she received a perfect score.) and writes poetry dedicated to her secret love for Arnold. Helga is defiantly more of a round character compared to Arnold who is just this nice, smart, and caring kid who is always positive and likes to give others advice. Don’t get me wrong, I think Arnold is a great character but throughout the seasons, Helga defiantly evolved more and became a more thoughtful and mature person compared to how she was in the first season. My favorite Helga episode was “Helga On the Couch,” which was about Helga talking to the school’s therapist and reminiscing about her life when she was in preschool and first met the people she goes to school with now specifically Arnold. There’s been talk about a spin off show centering on Helga in high school and her family titled the Patakisi. Nickelodeon declined to air the show since it would be too dark for a kids show and MTV also declined for unknown reasons. Since it doesn’t seem like there would be a Hey Arnold spin off soon, I guess Hey Arnold fan fiction will have to be enough."
