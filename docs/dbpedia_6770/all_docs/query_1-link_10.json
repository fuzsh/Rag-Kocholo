        "text": "Here are some names you probably haven't heard in a while, Aly & AJ. OK, well, unless you're me or Sarah Kinonen, one of Allure's digital editors. Both of us still listen to their Insomniatic and Into the Rush albums on Spotify when we're feeling nostalgic. The musical Michalka sisters who made their start on the Disney Channel have been focusing on acting these days. Aly, who's now 28, is a regular on iZombie. (If you haven't watch that show yet, I suggest binging on it ASAP.) AJ, 26, has been on The Goldbergs as Lainey Lewis since 2014. Now, they're returning to music as Aly & AJ once again. (In case you forgot, they called themselves 78violet for a brief period of time back in 2009.) Their first track in ten years,\"Take Me\", just dropped.\n\nI recently chatted with Aly & AJ about all things beauty. Turns out, they've seamlessly transitioned from polished Disney stars to natural beauty enthusiasts. Their love for Glossier, dewy skin, and dry shampoo runs deeper than their aesthetically pleasing Instagram accounts lead on. Keep reading to find out how they evolved their beauty routines over the years and which products they can't live without.\n\nOn how their hair and makeup has changed since the Disney days.\n\nAly: “I think our motto is definitely ‘less is more’ now. I don’t think it was when we started. I think it was definitely more of a trend to wear heavier makeup in the early 2000s, in general. I kind of love that being natural has become something that is now really embraced by so many women.”\n\nAJ: “There’s a freedom now to our beauty regimes that we didn’t have before. When you’re younger, trying to prove yourself and growing up fast, and you’re in a certain industry where a lot of girls are rapidly growing up, you feel like you have to keep up a little bit, and it’s so not the case. You look back later and think, ‘Wow, I would have done so much differently.’ But it’s fine. You learn, and now, I really think there’s a beauty to literally just washing your face, getting up, and going to the gym.”\n\nOn specific changes they would have made.\n\nAJ: “Certain ways we had our hair.”\n\nAly: “Oof.”\n\nAJ: “For us, it was like hair extensions, the bigger the better. Looking back, it kills me because I never would have hair extensions now. I’m not into over-producted hair.”\n\nAly: “We also had this weird, almost pale china doll face happening that was so white and powdered down because we didn’t want to sweat off our makeup. It ended up being a shade too light for our skin.”\n\nOn their current skin-care routines (because, let's be real, their skin looks so good lately).\n\nAly: “It’s funny because AJ and I are actually the exact opposite. I do nothing like a terrible person, which probably drives people insane when they do find that out. I literally use Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads or\n\nPremoistened facial-cleansing cloths\n\n, and that’s really it. I’ll also use the Glossier Priming Moisturizer Rich, but that’s it. AJ has more of a regimen that she does every morning and night.”\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAJ: “Well, Aly just never really dealt with breakouts as much. Because I went through a stage where I did deal with breakouts more, I became really anal about my routine. Every morning and every night, it’s a matter of prescription cleanser, and I see a dermatologist regularly. It’s not just effortless and you wake up this way all the time. I’m really anal about using sunscreen every day on my face. I re-apply. I’m really fair, so for me, I really have to be careful about burning. I use an oxygenated liquid before bed. I just definitely gone a little over-the-top lately, but I’m really good with routine.\"\n\nOn how they really feel about injectables:\n\nAJ: \"Not to say that I’m against it for other people, but personally, I don’t want to use injections or Botox. I’d rather use really great skin care to avoid having to do that, so I’m kind of ahead of the curve, hopefully. I’m just more into the natural look. It’s more of a personal preference. I wouldn’t really want to put anything in my face, especially being an actor. One thing goes wrong, and all of a sudden you can’t move your forehead. Maybe that’s me just being ignorant about how the process works, but we use so much expression on our faces as artists that anything that has to do with injectables really scares me. Like I said, I’m not against it. I know women who swear by them, and I think that’s great. I think it’s liberating that people have the option, but personally, I’d rather use a great laser and not ever touch anything that inserts into my skin.”\n\nOn trends they'd never try:\n\nAly: “Oh my gosh, that weird eyebrow trend, [feather brows], where people are parting their brows in the middle is so crazy. It’s absolutely insane — hell no. That and the overly defined eyebrow. People have become so obsessed with eyebrows, and I’m super against a heavy, defined eyebrow. I love when it looks natural and you can kind of see your hair follicles — not where it’s completely filled in.\n\nOn the inspiration behind AJ’s recent negative space liner look:\n\nAJ: “Sometimes, I’m like, I hate doing this because other people are doing it. But at the same time, other people are doing everything. It’s not even about copying anymore. It’s just about inspiration. Emma Watson had done that eye, and it was so pretty that it wasn’t about copying. I appreciated what this makeup artist did, and I wanted to take it on in my own way. [My makeup artist] Amy [Strozzi] kind of made it her own thing, and we recreated it.”\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOn my theory that Aly only has blonde hair when she's making Aly & AJ music:\n\nAly: “It’s not on purpose, but that’s a good point. I wanted to experiment with going back to blonde because I hadn’t been blonde in, like, five years. I just figured, hey, why don’t I just go back to blonde during this hiatus where I don’t need to be a brunette for iZombie for six months. It was fun for time being, but I don’t feel like myself as much when I’m blonde. Being as dark as I was for 78violet stuff was a fun change up, but I kinda like being right in the middle. I like being considered a brunette — but a light brunette. I’m now back to being brunette but a little bit on the lighter side — not really dark and super dyed looking. It looks kind of like what my natural hair color would be.”\n\nOn AJ’s blonde hair maintenance:\n\nAJ: “I just let my hair grow out as long as I can get away with. Then, [the colorist] will go in with highlights. But I don’t go in that often. I’m also religious about using Olaplex. I do that once or twice a week, which is such a great at-home treatment. The No.3 has really saved my hair.”\n\nOn what rainbow color they would dye their hair if they had to:\n\nAly: “I would do a blue like Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.”\n\nAJ: \"I would probably do purple. I have really green eyes, and I think purple and green complement each other really well. I would never have the guts to do it, but I think purple would be really pretty.”\n\nOn their top five go-to beauty products:\n\nAly:\n\nGlossier Haloscope highlighter: \"It's a must.\"\n\nArmani Smooth Silk Eye Pencil: \"It has a little tip at the other end of the pencil where you can smudge it. I love that pencil so much.\"\n\nGlossier Balm Dotcom: \"It’s fantastic and doesn’t dry your lips out, which I think a lot of lip balms do.\"\n\nMaybelline Great Lash Mascara: \"It’s super cheap, but it does the trick. I love that it’s not too thick of a mascara brush.\"\n\nSt. Tropez Self Tan: \"It’s super natural and doesn’t turn your skin orange. People always say, ‘You look so tan,’ and I’m like, ‘This is fake.’ That’s so much better than actually damaging your skin.\""
